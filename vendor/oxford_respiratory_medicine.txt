CHAPTER 1

Breathlessness

Clinical assessment and causes
Physiological mechanisms of breathlessness
Dyspnoea refers to the abnormal and uncomfortable awareness of
breathing. Its physiological mechanisms are poorly understood; possible afferent sources for the sensation include receptors in respiratory
muscles, juxtacapillary (J) receptors (sense interstitial ﬂuid), and chemoreceptors (sensing iCO2 and dO2).

Clinical assessment
All patients need a full history and examination. Key points in the assessment are:
• Duration and onset of breathlessness. The box opposite groups the
causes of breathlessness by speed of onset, although in practice some
variability and overlap exists. Patients often underestimate the duration
of symptoms—enquiring about exercise tolerance over a period of
time is a useful way of assessing duration and progression
- Severity of breathlessness. Assess the level of handicap and disability by
asking about effects on lifestyle, work, and daily activities
- Exacerbating factors. Ask about rest and exertion, nocturnal symptoms,
and body position. The timing of nocturnal breathlessness may provide
clues to the likely cause: left ventricular failure causes breathlessness
after a few hours of sleep, and resolves after about 45 min; asthma
tends to occur later in the night; laryngeal inspiratory stridor causes
noisy breathlessness of very short duration (<1 min); and Cheyne–
Stokes apnoeas result in breathlessness that is recurrent and clears
each time in less than 30 s. Orthopnoea is suggestive of left ventricular
failure or diaphragm paralysis, although it is also common in many
chronic lung diseases. Breathlessness during swimming is characteristic
of bilateral diaphragm paralysis. Trepopnoea refers to breathlessness
when lying on one side as a result of ipsilateral pulmonary disease
- Associated symptoms, such as cough, haemoptysis, chest pain, wheeze,
stridor, fever, loss of appetite and weight, ankle swelling, and voice
change. Wheeze may occur with pulmonary oedema, pulmonary
embolism, bronchiolitis, and anaphylaxis, in addition to asthma and
COPD
- Personal and family history of chest disease
- Lifetime employment, hobbies, pets, travel, smoking, illicit drug use,
medications
- Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Observe
the pattern and rate of breathing. Assess for signs of respiratory distress. Look for paradoxical abdominal movement if the history suggests
diaphragmatic paralysis. A useful bedside test is to exercise the patient
(e.g. by stepping on and off a 15–20-cm block) until their breathlessness
occurs, and then measure oximetry immediately on stopping when the
ﬁnger is still; a fall in oxygen saturation is expected with organic causes
of dyspnoea.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND CAUSES

Investigations
Initial investigations typically include resting oximetry, peak ﬂow and
spirometry, CXR, and ECG. Further tests depend on clinical suspicion;
options include full PFTs with measurement of lung volumes lying and
standing, gas transfer and ﬂow-volume loop, bronchial hyperresponsiveness or reversibility testing, maximal mouth or inspiratory sniff pressures,
ABGs (with measurement of A–a gradient, see p 793), exercise oximetry,
ventilation perfusion scanning and CTPA, HRCT, blood tests (full blood
count and TSH), echo, exercise ECG, and cardiac catheterization.

Causes of breathlessness grouped by speed of onset
Instantaneous
- Pneumothorax
- Pulmonary embolism.
Acute (minutes–hours)
- Airways disease (asthma, exacerbation of COPD, upper airways
obstruction)
- Parenchymal disease (pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary
haemorrhage, acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis)
- Pulmonary vascular disease (pulmonary embolism)
- Cardiac disease (e.g. acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, valvular
disease, tamponade, aortic dissection)
- Metabolic acidosis
- Hyperventilation syndrome.
Subacute (days)
- Many of the above, plus:
• Pleural effusion
• Lobar collapse
• Acute interstitial pneumonia
• Superior vena cava obstruction
• Pulmonary vasculitis.
Chronic (months–years)
- Some of the above, plus:
• Obstructive airways disease (COPD, asthma)
• Diffuse parenchymal disease (including idiopathic pulmonary
ﬁbrosis, sarcoidosis, bronchiectasis, lymphangitis carcinomatosis)
• Pulmonary vascular disease (chronic thromboembolic disease,
idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, veno-occlusive disease)
• Hypoventilation (chest wall deformity, neuromuscular weakness,
obesity)
• Anaemia
• Thyrotoxicosis.

Distinguishing cardiac and respiratory causes of
breathlessness
This can be difﬁcult. Many of the clinical features of left heart failure are
non-speciﬁc and easily confused with respiratory disease (e.g. orthopnoea, wheeze). In chronic cardiac failure, crackles on auscultation and
radiological features of pulmonary oedema may be absent even when the
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is signiﬁcantly raised (due to adaptive changes from vascular remodelling). The presence of emphysema
may also render crackles inaudible and lead to atypical CXR appearances
of pulmonary oedema. Chronic left heart failure commonly leads to a
restrictive ventilatory defect and reduced gas transfer on PFTs, and may
also result in pulmonary hypertension. HRCT features of left heart failure
include septal and peribronchovascular interstitial thickening, ground-glass
shadowing, pleural effusions, and cardiomegaly. Resting ECG is useful—in
practice, a cardiac cause of breathlessness is unlikely in the setting of a
completely normal ECG. Exercise ECG, echo, and cardiac catheterization
may be required. Measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a
recent development that may be of value in the diagnosis of cardiac failure;
in patients presenting as an emergency with breathlessness, a serum BNP
level <50 ng/L makes cardiac failure very unlikely. Cardiac and respiratory
diseases can, of course, coexist.

CHAPTER 2

Chest pain

The majority of patients with chest pain referred to the respiratory team
have either acute pleuritic pain or persistent, well-localized pain. Cardiac
pain rarely presents in this manner, although it should be considered in exertional pain or in the presence of risk factors for ischaemic heart disease.
Within the respiratory system, pain may arise from the parietal pleura,
major airways, chest wall, diaphragm, and mediastinum; the lung parenchyma
and visceral pleura are insensitive to pain. Processes involving the upper
parietal pleura cause a pain localized to that part of the chest. The lower
parietal pleura and outer region of diaphragmatic pleura are innervated
by the lower six intercostal nerves, and pain here may be referred to the
abdomen. The central region of the diaphragm is supplied by the phrenic
nerve (C3, 4, and 5), and pain may be referred to the ipsilateral shoulder tip.
Tracheobronchitis tends to be associated with retrosternal pain.

Acute pleuritic chest pain
- Pleuritic pain is sharp, well-localized, worse on coughing and inspiration,
and the subsequent limitation of inspiration often leads to a degree of
breathlessness
- Causes of acute pleuritic chest pain include:
• Pulmonary infarction (following embolism)
• Pneumonia
• Pneumothorax
• Pericarditis
• Pleural infection (empyema, tuberculous)
• Autoimmune disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
arthritis)
• Musculoskeletal
• Fractured rib
- In addition, consider atypical presentations of serious conditions such
as myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, oesophageal rupture, and
pancreatitis. Consider angioinvasive fungi, such as aspergillus, as a cause
of chest pain in the immunocompromised
- Diagnosis is typically based on ‘pattern recognition’ of clinical features
followed by selected investigations. Initial investigations typically include
CXR, ECG, ABGs, serum inﬂammatory markers, and D-dimers. Further
investigations may include V/Q scanning or CT pulmonary angiography,
pleural aspiration, and measurement of serum autoantibodies
- Pulmonary embolism (p 401) commonly presents with pleuritic pain
and exclusion of this diagnosis is the usual reason for referral. Assess
risk factors for thromboembolic disease. Normal oxygen saturations
and PaO2 in the ‘normal’ range do not exclude the diagnosis; calculate
the A–a gradient (p 793). The presence of a pleural rub is a nonspeciﬁc sign that occurs with pleural inﬂammation of any cause
- In young adults, pneumococcal pneumonia may present with acute
onset pleuritic chest pain, although systemic symptoms such as fever
usually predate the pain by hours

CHRONIC CHEST PAIN

- The pain from pericarditis is pleuritic, but central, and relieved on
leaning forward; there may also be a pericardial rub, characteristic ECG
features, and a small pericardial effusion on echo
- Musculoskeletal pain may occur as a result of cervical disc disease,
arthritis of the shoulder or spine, a fractured rib, or costochondritis
(Tietze’s syndrome), which often follows a viral infection
- The presence of chest wall tenderness does not invariably indicate a
benign, musculoskeletal cause; tenderness may be seen in malignant
chest wall inﬁltration and sometimes following pulmonary infarction
- Other features besides pleurisy that may suggest a diagnosis of systemic
lupus erythematosus include rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, arthritis,
pericarditis, renal or neurological disease, cytopenia, positive ANA, and
dsDNA.

Chronic chest pain
- Persistent chest pain that is well localized is typically caused by chest
wall or pleural disease. Causes include:
• Malignant pleural disease or chest wall inﬁltration
• Benign musculoskeletal pain
• Pleural infection (empyema, tuberculous)
• Benign asbestos pleural disease
• Autoimmune disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
arthritis)
• Recurrent pulmonary infarction (emboli, vasculitis)
- Pain from malignant chest wall inﬁltration is often ‘boring’ in character,
and may disturb sleep; it is frequently not related to respiration. Causes
include primary lung cancer, secondary pleural malignancy, mesothelioma, and rib or sternal involvement from malignancy (including
myeloma and leukaemia)
- Chronic thromboembolic disease tends to present with breathlessness;
when chest pain occurs, it is usually episodic, rather than persistent
- As with acute pleuritic pain, investigations are directed by initial clinical
suspicion. Consider CT chest, bone scan, serum autoantibodies, full
blood count and ﬁlm, serum electrophoresis. CXR may appear normal
in malignant chest wall disease.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic cough and normal CXR

Aetiology and clinical assessment
Cough is a frequent symptom of many respiratory diseases and is often
associated with underlying lung pathology and an abnormal CXR. Cough
can occur in otherwise healthy people and is often a self-limiting symptom.
Persistent coughing can be a socially disabling and distressing symptom,
for which help is often sought. Cough syncope is loss of consciousness
following violent coughing, a Valsalva type manoeuvre, which impairs
venous return to the heart and provokes bradycardia and vasodilatation
(similar to an ordinary faint). Important as car drivers must cease driving
until liability to cough syncope has ceased, conﬁrmed by medical opinion;
commercial drivers must cease driving and have no cough syncope or presyncope for 5 years if they have a chronic respiratory condition, including
smoking. If they have asystole due to cough, driving can be considered
after pacemaker insertion.
• Acute cough = cough lasting less than 3 weeks, usually due to viral
upper respiratory tract infection. May linger for 3–8 weeks as a
‘post-viral cough’
• Chronic cough = cough lasting more than 8 weeks
• Patients with a normal CXR and persistent cough are often grouped
under the heading ‘chronic cough’
• It can sometimes be difﬁcult to determine the underlying cause
• Susceptible individuals have a heightened cough reﬂex
• Investigation is warranted, but successful response to therapeutic trials
may aid determination of the underlying cause. Centres vary in their
approach to this
• Specialist cough clinics suggest they achieve diagnosis and effective
treatment in over 80% of patients referred with chronic cough.

Aetiology In practice, over 90% of cases of chronic cough with a normal
CXR are caused by one or more of:
• Cough variant asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis
• Gastro-oesophageal reﬂux disease
• Post-nasal drip, due to perennial or allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis,
or chronic sinusitis.
In clinic: full history can be unhelpful. Although cough is most commonly
due to asthma, reﬂux, or post-nasal drip, there may be no speciﬁc symptoms
to suggest these diagnoses.
• Duration of cough
• When it tends to occur—night or early morning, after exertion, on
exposure to dust, pollen, or cold air (asthma), after meals or on sitting
or bending over (GORD), nocturnal (post-nasal drip and asthma)
• Non-productive or productive and, if so, how much sputum and colour.
Signiﬁcant amounts of sputum usually indicate a primary lung pathology
• Haemoptysis
• Fever

AETIOLOGY AND CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

• Associated symptoms:
• Shortness of breath or wheeze
• Throat clearing or sensation of post-nasal drip
• Chest pain
• Ankle swelling/orthopnoea/paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea
• Dyspepsia
• Previous respiratory disease, such as childhood asthma, eczema, or hay
fever
• History of sinus disease or perennial rhinitis
• History of previous severe respiratory infections, such as whooping
cough, that may have caused bronchiectasis
• Known cardiac disease or valvular heart disease
• Drug history ?ACE inhibitor
• Occupation ?Workplace irritants
• Pets/birds
• Smoker
• Use of recreational drugs.

Examination can also be unhelpful, as it is usually normal. Look for
signs of underlying lung disease or other medical conditions, such as heart
failure, neurological disease (particularly bulbar involvement).
Investigations
Initially
• Ensure CXR is normal
• Spirometry may indicate restrictive or obstructive defect. Performance
of spirometry may provoke cough and bronchospasm
• Methacholine provocation test (p 769) provides the best positive
predictive value for cough due to asthma. A lack of response suggests
cough variant asthma is extremely unlikely. PC20 is normal in eosinophilic
bronchitis
• Serial peak ﬂow recordings twice daily for 2 weeks. Greater than
20% diurnal variation suggests asthma. Can be normal in cough variant
asthma
• Induced sputum examination, if available, for eosinophil count, to
suggest either asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis. Usually a research
tool.
Later
• Consider chest HRCT if any features suggestive of lung cancer or
interstitial lung disease, as a small proportion may present with a
normal CXR (central tumour)
• Consider ENT examination if predominantly upper respiratory tract
disease, resistant to treatment. Consider sinus CT
• Consider bronchoscopy if foreign body possible, or history suggestive
of malignancy, small carcinoid, endobronchial disease. Perform after
CT to help guide bronchoscopist
• Consider oesophageal pH monitoring.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic cough and normal CXR

Treatment
The initial treatment of patients with a chronic cough is determined by
what the most likely underlying cause is, based on the history and investigations. The key is to give any drug treatment at a high enough dose, and
for a long enough time (such as 3 months), to be effective.
Symptomatic treatment for cough
Over the counter medicines may provide relief, although there is little
evidence of a speciﬁc pharmacological effect. Below is a list of possible
treatments:
• Honey and lemon—home remedies
• Dextromethorphan—a non-sedating opiate. Component of many
over the counter cough remedies. Dose response, with maximum
cough reﬂex suppression at 60 mg. (Benylin® preparations, Actifed®
preparations, Vicks Vaposyrup® preparations, Sudafed Linctus®,
Night Nurse®)
• Menthol—short lived cough suppressant (Benylin® preparations, Vicks
Vaposyrup® preparations)
• Sedative antihistamines—suppress cough, but cause drowsiness.
Good for nocturnal cough
• Codeine or pholcodine—opiate antitussives—codeine requires
prescription. No greater efﬁcacy than dextromethorphan and greater
side-effect proﬁle
• Opiates—prescription. Low dose morphine sulphate 5–10 mg
showed signiﬁcant improvement in patients with intractable cough in
RCT (Morice AH et al Am J Crit Care Med 2007). Side-effect proﬁle of
opiates, so should be used with caution.

CAUSES OF COUGH (WITH OR WITHOUT CXR ABNORMALITY)

Causes of cough (with or without
CXR abnormality)
Respiratory
• Infection: viral upper and lower respiratory tract infection, bacterial
pneumonia, TB, pertussis
• Chronic bronchitis
• Obstructive airways disease: COPD, asthma
• Cough variant asthma
• Eosinophilic bronchitis
• Obstructive sleep apnoea (nocturnal only)
• Lung cancer
• Bronchiectasis, cystic ﬁbrosis
• Interstitial lung disease
• Airway irritants: smoking, dusts and fumes, acute smoke inhalation
• Airway foreign body.
Mediastinal
• External compression of trachea by enlarged lymph nodes
(e.g. lymphoma, TB)
• Mediastinal tumours/cysts/masses.
Cardiac
• Left ventricular failure
• Left atrial enlargement (e.g. severe mitral stenosis).
ENT
• Acute or chronic sinusitis
• Post-nasal drip due to perennial, allergic, or vasomotor rhinitis.
GI
• GORD
• Oesophageal dysmotility, stricture, or pharyngeal pouch causing
repeated aspiration
• Oesophago-bronchial ﬁstula.
CNS
Neurological disease affecting swallowing causing repeated aspiration,
such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, or Parkinson’s
disease.
Drugs
• ACE inhibitors
• Some inhaled preparations can cause cough—particularly ipratropium.
Other
• Idiopathic
• Ear wax (vagal nerve stimulation)
• Psychogenic/habitual.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic cough and normal CXR

Causes of chronic cough: asthma, GORD
Asthma or ‘cough variant asthma’, ‘cough predominant asthma’. This
represents one end of the asthma spectrum, with airway inﬂammation,
but may have minimal bronchoconstriction. There is not always a typical
asthma history, but ask about wheeze, atopy, hay fever, or childhood
asthma or eczema. Cough may be the only symptom. Cough is typically
worse after exercise, in cold air, or in the mornings.
• Spirometry may be normal, without evidence of airﬂow obstruction.
There may be typical asthmatic diurnal peak ﬂow variability of >20%, or
peak ﬂows may be stable.
• Methacholine challenge should be positive. If negative, other causes of
cough should be sought.
• Treatment should be for at least 2 months, with high-dose inhaled
steroids. Response may take days or weeks. Bronchodilators may make
little difference. If inhaled steroid therapy has been tried unsuccessfully,
ensure inhaler technique is optimal and a high dose has been used.
Alternatively prescribe a 2-week course of oral prednisolone
30mg/day and assess response. If the cough improves, high-dose inhaled
steroids should be continued and slowly reduced after about 2 months.
• Eosinophilic bronchitis Airway eosinophilia, rarely with peripheral blood
eosinophilia, causing heightened cough reﬂex, but no bronchial
hyperresponsiveness/wheeze or peak ﬂow variation. Diagnosis based
on negative asthma investigations and induced sputum eosinophilia.
Improves with inhaled corticosteroids, usually after 2–3 weeks, or
trial of oral prednisolone. Sputum eosinophil count also reduces with
treatment. If there is no response, the cough is unlikely to be due to
eosinophilic airway inﬂammation.
Gastro-oesophageal reﬂux disease (GORD)
Cough may be related to distal reﬂux at the lower oesophageal sphincter
(LOS) or due to micro-aspiration of acid into the trachea. There may be
associated oesophageal dysmotility. LOS reﬂux is often longstanding and
is associated with a productive or non-productive daytime cough, and
minimal nocturnal symptoms. It is worse after meals and when sitting down,
due to increased intra-abdominal pressure being transmitted to the LOS.
Micro-aspiration is associated with more prominent symptoms of reﬂux
or dyspepsia, although these are not always present. Patients may have an
intermittent hoarse voice, dysphonia, and sore throat. Cough may be the
only symptom.
Laryngoscopy may reveal posterior vocal cord inﬂammation, but this is
not a reliable sign.

CAUSES OF CHRONIC COUGH

A trial of treatment for both is recommended. This is with a high-dose
proton pump inhibitor for at least 2 months, although longer treatment
may be required to control cough. H2 receptor blockers are also effective and pro-kinetics like metoclopramide may help. Other reﬂux avoidance measures should be carried out: avoiding caffeine, wearing loose ﬁtting
clothes, sleeping with an empty stomach (avoid eating <4 h before bed),
sleeping propped up.
Investigation, if required, due to either treatment failure or because of diagnostic uncertainty, is with 24 h ambulatory pH monitoring, which determines
the presence of reﬂux events. These may not necessarily be responsible for
the cough, so it is not a very speciﬁc or sensitive test. Oesophageal manometry can be used to measure the LOS pressure and oesophageal contractions after swallowing to determine the presence of oesophageal dysmotility.

17

18

CHAPTER 3

Chronic cough and normal CXR

Causes of chronic cough: rhinitis,
post-infectious, ACE inhibitors,
idiopathic
Rhinitis and post-nasal drip
Rhinitis is deﬁned as sneezing, nasal discharge, or blockage for more than
an hour on most days for either a limited part of the year (seasonal) or
all year (perennial). Rhinitis may be allergic (e.g. hay fever), non-allergic, or
infective. The associated nasal inﬂammation may irritate cough receptors
directly or produce a post-nasal drip. These secretions may pool at the
back of the throat, requiring frequent throat clearing, or drip directly into
the trachea, initiating cough. A history of facial pain and purulent nasal
discharge suggests sinusitis, which can also predispose to post-nasal drip.
Symptoms of cough can occur on lying, but can be constant, regardless of
position.
ENT examination may reveal swollen turbinates, nasal discharge, or nasal
polyps.
Treatment Nasal preparations should be taken by kneeling with the top
of the head on the ﬂoor (‘Mecca’ position) or lying supine with the head
tipped over the end of the bed.
• Non-allergic rhinitis Trials suggest the best results are with an initial
3 weeks of nasal decongestants with ﬁrst-generation antihistamines
(which have helpful anticholinergic properties) and pseudoephedrine.
Alternatives are nasal ipratropium bromide or xylometazoline. This is
then followed by 3 months of high-dose nasal steroids, which are
ineffective when used as ﬁrst-line treatment. Second-generation
antihistamines (i.e. non-sedating) are of no use in non-allergic rhinitis
• Allergic rhinitis Second-generation antihistamine and high-dose nasal
steroids for 3 months at least
• Vasomotor rhinitis Nasal ipratropium bromide for 3 months.

Sinusitis is an infection of the paranasal sinuses, which may complicate an
URTI and is frequently caused by Haemophilus inﬂuenzae or Streptococcus
pneumoniae. It causes frontal headache and facial pain. Chronic sinusitis
may require further investigation with CXR or CT, which shows mucosal
thickening and air-ﬂuid levels. Surgery may be indicated.
• Chronic sinusitis Treat as for non-allergic rhinitis, but include 2 weeks
of antibiotics active against H. inﬂuenzae, such as doxycycline or
co-amoxiclav.

CAUSES OF CHRONIC COUGH

Post-infectious Respiratory tract infections, especially if viral in nature,
can cause cough. This may take weeks or months to resolve spontaneously,
although most settle within 8 weeks. The cough is related to a heightened cough reﬂex. Associated laryngospasm can occur, which is a sudden
hoarseness, with associated stridulous inspiratory efforts and a sensation
of being unable to breathe.
Treatment with antitussives, such as codeine linctus, may ease the symptoms. Inhaled steroids have been tried, but there is no trial evidence that
these work.

ACE inhibitor cough occurs with any ACE inhibitor and is related to
bradykinin not being broken down by angiotensin-converting enzyme, and
accumulating in the lung. Occurs in 10% of people on ACE inhibitors; more
frequent in women. Can occur 3–6 months after starting the drug; the cough
may be initiated by a respiratory tract infection, but persists thereafter.
Cough usually settles within a week of stopping the drug, but may take
months. Avoid all ACE inhibitors thereafter and may need to change to an
angiotensin receptor antagonist. Stop ACE inhibitor in any patient with a
troublesome cough.

Idiopathic cough accounts for 20% of referrals to a specialist cough
clinic. It is diagnosed after a thorough assessment. Typically, there is lymphocytic airway inﬂammation, but there may also be a history of reﬂux
cough.

Critically ill patient with
respiratory disease

21

22

CHAPTER 4

Critically ill patient

Patients often present critically ill to the Emergency or the Acute Medical
Department with respiratory disease. This may be due to a deterioration
or exacerbation of an existing condition, a ﬁrst presentation of a previously undiagnosed disease, or respiratory involvement of an acute systemic disease. As with any critically ill patient, standard management is
required initially to stabilize, with the focus moving to diagnosis and treatment. Often these need to take place in parallel. Depending on the presence of any pre-existing respiratory disease and the nature and severity of
this, it may be important to determine disease-speciﬁc treatment and/or
treatment limitations, and senior physician input should be sought for this.

1. Initial assessment
Airway—is the patient maintaining their airway? Is there snoring or gurgling? Tilt head, lift chin, use suction if good views. Is an airway adjunct
necessary? Consider inserting Guedel airway or nasopharyngeal airway if
GCS reduced <8 (p 741). Consider calling ITU if intubation and ITU care
likely to be necessary, or if the patient is rapidly deteriorating/peri-arrest
and full assessment has not yet been possible (p 689).
Breathing—cyanosis? What is the SaO2 and associated FiO2?
• Exclude tension pneumothorax clinically (p 382).
• What is the respiratory rate?
• Has a blood gas been taken and what does it show? (p 791)
• Oxygenation adequate? If not, likely to need increased FiO2 (p 704), or
if this is already maximal, need ventilatory support—involve ITU
• Is the CO2 low? If hyperventilation, already working hard breathing to
maintain O2 at current level. May need to increase FiO2, or if already
maximal, need ventilatory assistance—involve ITU
• Is the CO2 high (p 791)? Hypoventilating, tiring, or CO2 narcosis in
COPD—consider ventilatory support
• Request an urgent portable CXR.
Circulation—what is pulse rate, BP, rhythm on cardiac monitor/ECG?
What is ﬂuid balance status? Aim to optimize. Ensure IV access secured
and blood tests sent. Look at BP, JVP, urine output, peripheral perfusion
(capillary reﬁll time). If they are hypotensive, are they underﬁlled?
Consider ﬂuids (crystalloid). If they are euvolaemic/over ﬁlled but hypotensive with poor urine output, they may need inotropic support. Likely
to need central venous access to enable CVP monitoring, and this will aid
drug administration.
Disability—Conscious level: GCS or AVPU (alert, responsive to verbal
commands, responsive to pain, unresponsive). Are they confused? Check
blood glucose, temperature, pupils, signs of acute neurological disease—
neck stiffness, plantar reﬂexes, tone.
Examination—temperature, sputum, asterixis, chest signs (pneumothorax, wheeze, silent chest, effusion, consolidation, pulmonary oedema),
cardiac murmurs, palpable abdominal organomegaly, skin/nail signs, rash
Investigations—immediate tests include FBC, clotting screen, CRP, U&E,
blood cultures before antibiotics.

CRITICALLY ILL PATIENT WITH RESPIRATORY DISEASE

2. Consider underlying cause
If known respiratory disease, this will enable more targeted therapy.
Try and obtain recent hospital notes. Ask patient or their relatives about
disease severity, current treatment, plans of clinicians for long-term care
(immunosuppression, transplant list, home NIV, advanced directive, lasting
power of attorney, etc.). What is their usual current health status—exercise
tolerance, activities of daily living? What has caused this deterioration—a
potentially reversible process (e.g. infection, drugs, pneumothorax, PE) or
gradual progression of underlying disease? Review CXR and compare with
old ﬁlms if possible.
• For more details regarding exacerbations of chronic lung diseases, see
p 128 (asthma), p 714 (COPD), p 565 (CF), p 176 (bronchiectasis), p 216
(IPF), p 154 (lung cancer), p 264 (sickle cell).
If no known respiratory disease, full history required to obtain diagnosis.
The patient’s cardiovascular status and illness severity will determine how
brief/full this is. Ask about recent symptoms, travel, contact illness, risk
factors for immunocompromise, usual health status, drugs.
For presentation-based differential diagnoses and initial investigation
plans see p 3 (breathlessness), p 8 (chest pain), p 40 (haemoptysis), p 67
and p 79 (immunocompromise), p 91 (unexplained respiratory failure), p 29
(diffuse lung disease), p 25 (diffuse alveolar haemorrhage), p 45 (pleural
effusion), p 61 (pregnancy), p 57 (post-operative), p 419 (pneumonia), p 401
(pulmonary embolism), p 373 (pneumothorax), p 593 (toxic agents), p 639
and p 642 (upper airway disease and anaphylaxis), and p 300 (SVCO).

3. Determine treatment aims
In patients with known severe respiratory disease, with poor premorbid state (e.g. very limited exercise tolerance, comorbidities, severe
dementia), intubation and invasive ventilation may not be appropriate.
The patient may have their own views on this or have made a living will/
advanced directive. Old notes should be reviewed if possible, and this
decision should be discussed with their respiratory consultant or the consultant on call. Non-invasive ventilation (p 693) may be appropriate.
In patients with known respiratory disease, with an acute exacerbation
(infective or non-infective), respiratory and organ support may be indicated
to enable them to survive this episode. This should be discussed with their
respiratory consultant or the consultant on call and ITU.
In patients with no known respiratory disease, respiratory and organ
support may well be indicated to enable them to survive this episode. This
should be discussed with the consultant on call and ITU. If they have signiﬁcant pre-existing comorbidity from a non-respiratory disease (severe
cardiac failure, severe dementia), the details of this should be ascertained
and discussed with their usual consultant if possible.
If there is any doubt about a patient’s usual health status, or no previous
history or notes available, or they are deteriorating before full assessment can
be made, they should be considered for full ventilatory and organ support.

CHAPTER 5

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage
A triad of:
• diffuse alveolar inﬁltrates
• haemoptysis (although not always present)
• a fall in haemoglobin or haematocrit.
Bleeding into the alveoli is often a feature of a small vessel vasculitis of the
lungs. This blood tends to remain in the lungs and is not expectorated.
Patients with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage may have a background history
of vasculitis over the preceding weeks to months. They can present with
slowly progressive dyspnoea with haemoptysis, or be acutely unwell with
hypoxia. They may require ventilatory support.

Presentation Abrupt onset haemoptysis is the most common symptom,
although this is not present in one-third of cases. Also cough, dyspnoea,
low-grade fever, weight loss, arthralgia, myalgia. There may be a history of
chronic sinusitis (Wegener’s).

Examination May be non-speciﬁc, or may have signs of underlying
vasculitis with skin rashes, nail fold infarcts, digital gangrene. Episcleritis,
corneal ulceration, epistaxis, nasal crusting, or deafness may be present.
Neurological signs including mononeuritis multiplex should raise the possibility of vasculitis. Patients may be breathless. Haematuria and proteinuria
on urine dip.

Investigations
• May be hypoxic—check SaO2 ± ABG
• FBC—?falling haemoglobin
• CXR showing bilateral alveolar inﬁltrates—difﬁcult to distinguish from
pulmonary oedema or infection
• Consider chest HRCT
• Raised kCO as increased intra-alveolar haemoglobin is available to
combine with carbon monoxide. Abnormal if raised by more than
30%. If breathless at rest, they will not be able to perform this test as it
requires breath-holding of an air, carbon monoxide, and helium mixture
for 10 s. This test can be used to monitor disease progress
• BAL shows bloodstained lavage, which becomes sequentially more so
with each washing. Cytology shows haemosiderin-laden macrophages
• Renal involvement: blood and/or protein in the urine, red cell casts,
raised urea and creatinine
• Send blood for urgent ANA, ANCA (PR3 and MPO), anti-GBM,
dsDNA, and rheumatoid factor
• Consider biopsy of lung, kidney (if acute glomerulonephritis present),
or other affected site if well enough to make a tissue diagnosis.
Transbronchial biopsy specimens are usually insufﬁcient to make a
diagnosis of vasculitis and a surgical lung biopsy is required. Capillaritis
(a neutrophilic vasculitis of capillaries and venules), haemorrhage, or
diffuse alveolar damage with haemorrhage seen on lung biopsy.

DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HAEMORRHAGE

3 Management of alveolar haemorrhage
• Admit to hospital
• Supportive treatment, with intravenous ﬂuids, blood transfusion, and
oxygen if necessary
• Monitor, paying particular attention to oxygen saturations and keeping
them above 92% with oxygen therapy. May need respiratory support
with intubation and ventilation or CPAP. Monitor haemoglobin and
transfuse if necessary. Monitor urine output and renal function
• Aim to establish the underlying diagnosis, usually with tissue biopsy
• Treatment with plasma exchange, high dose steroids and cyclophosphamide, and dialysis if required.

Key questions
• Is this isolated lung disease?
• Is there accompanying renal disease?
• Are there other features of an underlying disease?—ENT, joints, etc.

CHAPTER 6

Diffuse lung disease

Causes
Diffuse lung disease is common and its diagnosis is frequently challenging.
This chapter describes a diagnostic approach based on clinical features,
imaging, and other investigations; more detailed descriptions of the diseases themselves are presented later in the book. The term ‘diffuse lung
disease’ is used here to describe any widespread pulmonary disease
process. Patients typically present with breathlessness and bilateral CXR
shadowing. The rate of onset and severity of breathlessness are extremely
variable, however, and presentations range from an asymptomatic patient
with longstanding radiological changes to an acute onset of breathlessness
over a period of days, leading rapidly to respiratory failure and death.

Anatomy of diffuse lung disease
An understanding of lung anatomy is helpful when considering the causes
of diffuse lung disease and their appearance on HRCT. Many diffuse lung
diseases primarily affect the interstitium (‘interstitial lung disease’, also
described as ‘diffuse parenchymal lung disease’), a poorly deﬁned term that
refers to the connective tissue ﬁbrous framework of the lung. Centrally,
connective tissue surrounds bronchovascular bundles (each consisting
of a bronchus and its accompanying pulmonary artery) that originate at
the hila. Peripherally, these connective tissue sheaths are in continuity
with ﬁbrous interlobular septa, which organize the lung into units called
‘secondary pulmonary lobules’, polyhedral structures with approximately
2-cm sides (see diagram p 817). Interlobular septa, which deﬁne and
separate secondary pulmonary lobules, contain lymphatics and venules.
A secondary pulmonary lobule contains around 5–12 acini, and is supplied
at its centre by a bronchiole and pulmonary arteriole.
The term ‘interstitial lung disease’ is confusing because many primarily
interstitial processes also involve the airways, vasculature, and alveolar
airspaces. Disease processes that primarily affect the airways (e.g. bronchiectasis), vessels (e.g. vasculitis), or airspaces (e.g. pneumonia) may also
present with diffuse CXR shadowing and so are included in this chapter.

Causes
There are several hundred causes of diffuse lung disease, and it is useful to
divide these into groups based on their rate of onset and aetiology/disease
mechanism (see Table 6.1).

CHAPTER 6

Diffuse lung disease

Clinical assessment and imaging
History Clinical features may provide useful clues to the underlying diagnosis. Key points in the history are:
Presenting symptoms
• Breathlessness is the most common symptom, and its rate of onset may
be useful diagnostically (see Table 6.1)
• Causes of truly episodic breathlessness/diffuse CXR shadowing include
eosinophilic pneumonia, vasculitis, Churg–Strauss syndrome, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and pulmonary oedema
• Cough may occur, although its diagnostic value is uncertain; it may
be a prominent symptom in lymphangitis carcinomatosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, sarcoid, and
eosinophilic pneumonia. Chronic production of purulent sputum suggests bronchiectasis. Bronchorrhoea (production of large volumes of
sputum) may occur with bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma. Haemoptysis
suggests alveolar haemorrhage, malignancy, or pulmonary venous
hypertension
• Wheeze may occur in asthma associated with eosinophilic pneumonia
or Churg–Strauss syndrome
• Weight loss and fever are non-speciﬁc symptoms associated with many
diffuse lung diseases.
Other medical conditions e.g. malignancy, connective tissue disease, HIV
infection, other immunosuppression. Ask about old CXRs, which may be
helpful in assessing disease duration.
Drugs
• See Table 6.1 for common drug causes of diffuse lung disease
• Delays of months or even years may occur between starting the drug
and developing lung involvement
• Illicit drug abuse (crack cocaine or heroin—pulmonary oedema,
eosinophilic pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, interstitial
pneumonia; intravenous drug use—IV talcosis, septic emboli)
• Oily nose drops (lipoid pneumonia).
Occupation, lifestyle, hobbies, and pets
• May involve inhalation of inorganic or organic dusts. Document lifelong
employment history, including probable exposure levels, use of protective
equipment, and names of employers
• Inorganic dusts associated with development of diffuse lung disease
include asbestos, silica, cobalt, beryllium, aluminium, isocyanates, copper
sulphate, iron, tin, barium, and antimony
• Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may result from inhalation of organic
dusts such as Thermoactinomycetes in mouldy hay (farmer's lung), avian
proteins or feathers (bird fancier's lung), mushroom compost, mouldy
cheese, cork or sugar cane, and isocyanates
• Risk factors for immunocompromise (opportunistic infection, LIP,
lymphoma)

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND IMAGING

• Smoking history (Langerhans cell histiocytosis, respiratory bronchiolitisassociated interstitial lung disease, desquamative interstitial pneumonia,
and Goodpasture’s syndrome are more common in smokers).
Evidence of extrapulmonary disease Manifestations of connective tissue
disease, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, e.g. arthralgia, skin rash, ocular symptoms,
muscular pain and weakness, Raynaud’s, nasal/sinus disease, haematuria.
Infertility in males (immotile cilia syndrome, cystic ﬁbrosis).
Travel Tuberculosis, pulmonary eosinophilia from parasites (tropics), histoplasmosis (north and central United States, parts of South America and
Africa), hydatid disease (Middle East, Australasia, Mediterranean).
Family history A1-antitrypsin deﬁciency, rare familial forms of UIP and sarcoidosis.

Examination
• Cyanosis and signs of cor pulmonale in severe disease
• Clubbing (usual interstitial pneumonitis, asbestosis, bronchiectasis)
• Basal crackles (usual interstitial pneumonitis, asbestosis, connective
tissue disease, pulmonary oedema, lymphangitis, drugs); crackles in
bronchiectasis are characteristically coarse
• Absence of crackles despite a signiﬁcant CXR abnormality may be
suggestive of sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
or Langerhans cell histiocytosis
• Squeaks suggest the presence of bronchiolitis
• Skin, joint, and eye disease (connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis,
vasculitis).

Imaging
CXR is an essential test and is diagnostic in at least 50% of cases. Up to 10% of
patients with biopsy-proven diffuse lung disease have a normal CXR, however.
Previous CXRs are helpful in assessing disease duration and progression.
High-resolution CT (HRCT) chest is more sensitive and speciﬁc than CXR
for diagnosing diffuse lung disease (see following page and Appendix 4).
HRCT is often in itself diagnostic and should always precede biopsy in
the investigation of diffuse lung disease. HRCT also enables assessment
of disease extent, and optimal biopsy site if required. HRCT appearance
correlates to some extent with disease activity in the interstitial pneumonias: a predominantly ‘ground-glass’ appearance may signify a steroidresponsive inﬂammatory state, whereas reticulation and honeycombing
are often associated with ﬁbrosis, poor response to treatment, and a
worse prognosis.

33

CHAPTER 6

Diffuse lung disease

HRCT diagnosis
HRCT (and to a limited extent CXR) appearances can be classiﬁed
according to the pattern and distribution of disease, and the presence of
additional features (see also Appendix 4).

1. Imaging pattern
Reticular (or linear) pattern Causes include:
• Interstitial pulmonary oedema
• Usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP; reticular shadowing is typically
patchy, subpleural, and basal; other features include loss of architecture
of secondary pulmonary lobules, honeycombing, ground-glass change,
traction bronchiectasis)
• Asbestosis (similar features to UIP, often with pleural plaques)
• Connective tissue disease associated ﬁbrosis (similar features to UIP)
• Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (often associated with regions
of ground-glass change, air-trapping on expiration, and centrilobular
micronodules)
• Drug-induced ﬁbrosis
• Sarcoidosis.
Nodular pattern consists of numerous discrete, round opacities 0.1–1 cm
in diameter.
• Interstitial processes result in nodularity within interlobular septa,
around bronchovascular bundles, and subpleurally (e.g. sarcoidosis,
which may demonstrate associated perihilar reticular shadowing and
lymphadenopathy)
• Airspace diseases may lead to affected acini becoming visible as nodules
(e.g. hypersensitivity pneumonitis, miliary TB, COP, malignancy).
Ground-glass change is an increase in lung density through which pulmonary vasculature is still visible (compare the lung density with that of air
within the bronchi). May occur as a result of airspace or interstitial disease,
and may be patchy or diffuse. Causes include:
• Pulmonary oedema or haemorrhage, ARDS
• Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
• Drugs
• Certain idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (NSIP, RB-ILD, DIP, AIP)
• PCP
• Sarcoidosis
• Bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma
• Alveolar proteinosis.
Ground-glass appearance may be artefactual, the increased density resulting
from breath-holding during expiration. It may also be confused with
‘mosaic perfusion’, where densities vary in different regions of the lung
as a result of variable perfusion, e.g. in chronic thromboembolic disease,
small airways disease.
Consolidation (or airspace shadowing) is an increase in attenuation
characterized by air bronchograms (air-ﬁlled bronchi superimposed against
opaciﬁed alveoli) and the loss of visibility of adjacent vessels. It occurs as

HRCT DIAGNOSIS

disease processes inﬁltrate and ﬁll alveolar airspaces, for example, with
water, blood, pus, malignant cells, or ﬁbrous tissue. Causes include:
• Pneumonia
• Pulmonary oedema or haemorrhage, ARDS
• Drugs
• Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)
• Bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma, lymphoma
• Other rare conditions (e.g. eosinophilic pneumonia, alveolar proteinosis).
Cystic change refers to well-deﬁned air spaces with a thin wall. Causes
include:
• Langerhans cell histiocytosis (bizarrely shaped cysts and nodules, apical
predominance)
• Usual interstitial pneumonitis (subpleural honeycombing)
• PCP
• Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia
• Septic emboli
• Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (thin-walled cysts, otherwise normal lung)
• Centrilobular emphysema may simulate cystic disease, but there is
absence of a well-deﬁned wall.
Interlobular septal thickening occurs as a result of processes affecting the
lymphatics or venules within interlobular septa, such as:
• Pulmonary oedema (smooth thickening)
• Lymphangitis carcinomatosis (irregular, nodular thickening of interlobular
septa and bronchovascular bundles, no architectural distortion)
• Sarcoidosis
• Usual interstitial pneumonitis.

2. Imaging distribution
• Upper zone: silicosis, pneumoconiosis, chronic sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, ankylosing spondylitis, tuberculosis, Langerhans cell
histiocytosis
• Lower zone: UIP, connective tissue diseases, asbestosis
• Mid-zone: sarcoidosis, pulmonary oedema, Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia
• Peripheral: UIP, eosinophilic pneumonia, drugs (amiodarone), COP
• Sharp borders: radiation pneumonitis.

Additional imaging features
• Lymphadenopathy: sarcoidosis, lymphoma, malignancy, infection, silicosis,
berylliosis, LIP
• Pleural effusion/involvement: pulmonary oedema, connective tissue
diseases, infection, malignancy, asbestosis, drugs, LAM.

CHAPTER 6

Diffuse lung disease

Further investigations
Urine and blood tests
Consider the following investigations:
• Urine dipstick and microscopy for detection of renal disease associated
with vasculitis/connective tissue disease
• ESR, CRP, FBC (look speciﬁcally at the eosinophil count), renal and liver
function, calcium (increased in >10% of patients with sarcoidosis)
• Autoantibodies (including anti-Jo-1, occurs with myositis-associated
interstitial pneumonia; positive rheumatoid factor or ANA may occur in
infection, malignancy, and UIP as well as in connective tissue disease)
• ANCA (vasculitis), anti-GBM (Goodpasture’s syndrome)
• Serum precipitins (to antigens in hypersensitivity pneumonitis; poor
speciﬁcity)
• Serum ACE levels may be increased in sarcoidosis, but this is a nonspeciﬁc and relatively insensitive test and is unhelpful diagnostically.

Sputum
• Cytology may be diagnostic in bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma
• Induced sputum may be useful in the diagnosis of PCP and TB.

Pulmonary function tests
• Useful in assessing severity of disease and response to treatment, but
often unhelpful diagnostically
• Typically show restrictive pattern with reduced vital capacity and
transfer factor. Normal values do not exclude mild, early lung disease
• Obstructive pattern rare, but may be seen in sarcoidosis, Langerhans
cell histiocytosis, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis; may see mixed
picture if coexisting COPD
• Transfer factor may be increased transiently (days) in alveolar
haemorrhage. Reduced transfer factor with preserved lung volumes in
scleroderma is suggestive of pulmonary vascular disease (such as
pulmonary arterial hypertension or vasculitis)
• Disease progression and response to treatment are best assessed by
serial measurements of vital capacity and transfer factor
• Check oxygen saturation and consider ABGs. A fall in oxygen saturation
on simple exercise may be performed in the clinic setting, and is a useful
clue to underlying lung disease in patients with normal saturation and
lung function at rest and an unremarkable CXR.

Cardiac investigations
• ECG Conduction abnormality in sarcoidosis; cardiogenic pulmonary
oedema is unusual in the presence of a completely normal ECG
• Echocardiography Assess left ventricular and valvular function if cardiac
pulmonary oedema suspected, and measure pulmonary arterial pressure
in scleroderma and suspected pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.

Bronchoalveolar lavage
• Most useful in diagnosis of opportunistic infection (bacterial or fungal
pneumonia, tuberculosis, PCP), malignancy, alveolar proteinosis,
eosinophilic pneumonia, and alveolar haemorrhage
• BAL differential cell counts usually unhelpful diagnostically.

FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS

Lung biopsy
Which patients need a lung biopsy?
In cases of uncertain aetiology, despite clinical assessment and HRCT, lung
biopsies often provide a deﬁnitive diagnosis. Ideally, they should be taken
before treatment is started. The decision to biopsy varies amongst clinicians,
and should take into account the individual patient’s clinical condition and
wishes, and the likely beneﬁt of a deﬁnitive diagnosis in terms of predicting
treatment response and prognosis. Some take a pragmatic approach when
a diagnosis (or group of diagnoses with the same treatment) is likely, but
not biopsy-proven, and treat empirically. In some cases, the patient may
be too unwell for biopsy and require empirical treatment. Biopsy of endstage ﬁbrosis is unhelpful in eliciting an underlying aetiology.

Biopsy techniques
Transbronchial biopsy provides small samples, but relatively high diagnostic yield in diseases with a ‘centrilobular’ distribution, e.g. sarcoidosis,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, malignancy, infection (fungi, tuberculosis),
and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Take 4–6 samples. Additional blind
endobronchial biopsies may be diagnostic in sarcoidosis.
Open lung biopsy via thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic
(VATS) biopsy provide larger samples than TBB and have diagnostic yields
of at least 90%. Both require general anaesthesia. VATS probably has a
lower morbidity and is generally preferred in stable patients; open biopsy
is required in ventilator-dependent patients.
Open or VATS biopsy (rather than TBB) is required for diagnosis
of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, vasculitis, lymphoma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
Percutaneous image-guided biopsy may be useful in the diagnosis of welllocalized and dense peripheral inﬁltrates. A cutting needle biopsy technique is best and, if the lesion(s) abuts the pleural surface, pneumothorax
is uncommon.

CHAPTER 7

Haemoptysis

Clinical assessment and causes
Haemoptysis is a common and non-speciﬁc feature, and can be a sign of
signiﬁcant underlying lung disease. In up to one-third of cases, no cause
is found. An early assessment of the likely underlying cause needs to be
made and investigated accordingly.

Diagnostic approach to haemoptysis Small volume haemoptysis is
a commonly encountered problem in the out-patient department. It can
be safely and efﬁciently investigated as an out-patient. Massive haemoptysis is usually encountered in the accident and emergency department or
in a patient already on the ward with known underlying lung disease. The
approaches to small volume and massive haemoptysis are different.
History
Past history of lung disease?
Document volume of blood and whether old (altered) or fresh
Time course (intermittent, constant)
Deﬁnitely from the airway, and not from the nose or mouth, or
haematemesis? (haemoptysis may be swallowed and then vomited)
• Presence of systemic features—associated infection, symptoms consistent with underlying malignancy or vasculitis?
•
•
•
•

Examination May be normal or show signs of underlying lung disease,
e.g. bronchiectasis, bronchial carcinoma, or symptoms of circulatory
collapse.
In practice the usual differential diagnosis lies between:
•
•
•
•

Malignancy
Bronchiectasis
Tuberculosis/infection
PE.

Causes of haemoptysis
Common
• Bronchial tumour (benign, e.g. carcinoid or malignant).
Haemoptysis is a common presenting feature of bronchogenic
malignancy, indicating endobronchial disease, which may be visible
endoscopically
• Bronchiectasis. Small volume haemoptysis is a common feature of
bronchiectasis, particularly during exacerbations. It can be a cause
of massive haemoptysis from dilated and abnormal bronchial artery
branches that form around bronchiectatic cavities
• Active tuberculosis. Haemoptysis occurs in cavitating and
non-cavitating disease, active disease and inactive disease (e.g. from an
old bronchiectatic cavity, which might contain a mycetoma)
• Pneumonia (especially pneumococcal disease)
• Pulmonary thromboembolic disease
• Vasculitides/alveolar haemorrhage syndromes, e.g. Wegener’s
granulomatosis, SLE, Goodpasture’s syndrome
• Warfarin with any of the above.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND CAUSES

Rare
• Lung abscess
• Mycetoma
• Fungal/viral/parasitic infections
• Fat embolism
• Arteriovenous malformation, e.g. in hereditary haemorrhagic
telangiectasia (HHT) (see p 618)
• Severe pulmonary hypertension (see p 385)
• Mitral stenosis (rare)
• Congenital heart disease
• Aortic aneurysm
• Aspergillus—invasive fungal disease (intracavity mycetoma) can be a
cause of massive haemoptysis
• Coagulopathy, including disseminated intravascular coagulation
• Endometriosis
• Pulmonary haemosiderosis
• Iatrogenic, e.g. lung biopsy, bronchoscopy.

CHAPTER 7

Haemoptysis

Investigations
The investigation of haemoptysis can often be carried out as an out-patient,
but patients with signiﬁcant bleeding or a likely serious underlying cause
should be admitted if there are concerns.
NB. Beware of the apparently small bleed, which is a sentinel/herald
bleed for massive bleeding. This is fortunately rare.

Out-patient investigations and management
First-line investigations
• Blood tests FBC, clotting, group and save. If systemic vasculitis is
suspected, renal function and a urine dip and microscopy for casts are
necessary, as well as autoantibodies—ANCA, anti-GBM, and ANA
• Sputum cytology and M, C, & S and AFB if infection suspected
• CXR may show mass lesion, bronchiectasis, consolidation, or an AVM
• CT chest should be done prior to bronchoscopy, as prior knowledge
of the site of abnormality leads to increased pick-up rates at bronchoscopy. Similarly, a deﬁnitive diagnosis, e.g. AVM, may be made from the
CT, obviating the need for further investigations. This depends on local
resources CT may miss an upper airway abnormality, but bronchoscopy
should not
• Bronchoscopy to visualize the airways and localize the site of bleeding.
May also be therapeutic, for example if a bleeding tumour can be
injected with a vasoconstricting agent (adrenaline) or a catheter
inserted for tamponade (see massive haemoptysis)
• Transbronchial biopsies—if vasculitis suspected.
Second-line investigations
Usually done if ﬁrst-line investigations fail to demonstrate a cause.
• CTPA to exclude PE
• Bronchial angiogram Diagnostic and therapeutic. Rare for the actual
bleeding site to be identiﬁed; more often the bleeding site is assumed
from visualizing a mesh of dilated and tortuous vessels, e.g. around a
bronchiectatic cavity. Usually done during an episode of bleeding to
maximize the chance of identifying the site of bleeding
• Bronchial artery embolization Therapeutic approach to embolize the
bleeding artery, usually with coils or glue (specialist centre only). There
is a small risk of paraplegia (<1%) if the anterior spinal artery originates
from the bronchial arterial circulation
• ENT review The source of the bleeding may be the upper airway
• Echocardiogram Moderate/severe PHT can cause haemoptysis,
especially in a patient on anticoagulants.

Cryptogenic haemoptysis In around one-third of cases, despite
appropriate investigations as above, no cause for the haemoptysis can
be found. This has a good prognosis. Often the haemoptysis will settle
without treatment and will become less worrying to the patient over time,
especially as investigations have failed to determine the cause. Massive
haemoptysis (100–600 mL blood in 24 h) is a life-threatening emergency,
with a mortality of up to 80%.

INVESTIGATIONS

22 Management of massive haemoptysis
Massive haemoptysis (100–600 mL blood in 24 h) is a life-threatening
emergency, with a mortality of up to 80%. It is extremely distressing
for the patient, relatives, and medical staff, but is fortunately rare.
Investigations will follow treatment, which may be difﬁcult, and is often
unsuccessful. In some cases, active treatment may be inappropriate, and
palliative treatment with oxygen and diamorphine may be warranted.
• Airway protection and ventilation
Protection of the non-bleeding lung is vital to maintain adequate gas
exchange. This may involve lying on the bleeding side (to prevent blood
ﬂowing into the unaffected lung), or intubation with a double lumen
tube. If intubation is not needed, or not appropriate, give high ﬂow
oxygen.
• Cardiovascular support:
• large bore/central intravenous access
• clotting factors, group and save
• ﬂuid resuscitation 9 transfusion
• reverse anticoagulants
• inotropes
• Nebulized adrenaline (5–10 mL of 1 in 10,000)
• Oral tranexamic acid (500 mg tds, not if in severe renal failure)
• CXR 9 chest CT (depending on stability of patient)
• Early bronchoscopy—diagnostic and therapeutic
• Rigid bronchoscopy (with general anaesthesia) is preferable. May
allow localization of the site of bleeding; balloon tamponade with a
Fogarty catheter
• Bronchial artery embolization—therapeutic approach to embolize
bleeding artery, usually with coils or glue (specialist centre only)
• Surgery—resection of bleeding lobe (if all other measures have failed).

CHAPTER 8

Pleural effusion

Clinical assessment
Pleural effusion is a common presentation of a wide range of different
diseases.
Commonest causes in UK and USA (in order): cardiac failure, pneumonia,
malignancy, pulmonary embolism.
Priority is to make a diagnosis and relieve symptoms with minimum number
of invasive procedures. The majority of patients do not require a chest
drain and can be managed as out-patients. Procedures such as therapeutic
thoracentesis may be performed readily on a day unit. Consider admission
and chest drain insertion for:
• Patients with malignant effusions who are candidates for pleurodesis
• Empyema or parapneumonic effusion with purulent ﬂuid or a pleural
ﬂuid pH <7.2 (the majority of these effusions are unlikely to resolve
without drainage and antibiotics)
• Patients who are unwell with an acute massive effusion.
Key steps in the management of the patient with a pleural effusion (see
also abbreviated algorithm in following section).

1. History, examination, CXR (PA and lateral).
2. Does the patient have heart failure? If so, this should be treated,
with no need for pleural tap unless atypical features (such as very asymmetrical bilateral effusions, unilateral effusion, chest pain, or fever) or fails
to respond within 3 days (75% of cardiac failure effusions resolve following
48 h of diuresis).

3. Thoracentesis (= ‘pleural tap’ or pleural ﬂuid aspiration) may be
diagnostic and/or therapeutic, depending on the volume of ﬂuid removed.
See p 782 for procedure details, and pp 52-55 for pleural ﬂuid analysis.
Following diagnostic tap:
• Note pleural ﬂuid appearance
• Send sample in sterile pot to biochemistry for measurement of protein
and LDH
• Send a fresh 20-mL sample in sterile pot to cytology for examination
for malignant cells and differential cell count
• Send samples in sterile pot and blood culture bottles to microbiology
for Gram stain and microscopy, culture, and AFB stain and culture
• Process non-purulent heparinized samples in arterial blood gas
analyser for pH
• Consider measurement of cholesterol and triglycerides, haematocrit,
glucose, and amylase, depending on the clinical circumstances.
If the patient is breathless they may beneﬁt from removal of a larger
volume of ﬂuid (therapeutic tap, p 783).

4. Is the pleural effusion a transudate or exudate? Helpful in
narrowing the differential diagnosis. In patients with a normal serum
protein, pleural ﬂuid protein <30 g/L = transudate and protein >30 g/L
= exudate. In borderline cases (protein 25–35 g/L), or in patients with

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

abnormal serum protein, apply Light’s criteria—effusion is exudative if it
meets one of following criteria.
• Pleural ﬂuid protein/serum protein ratio >0.5
• Pleural ﬂuid LDH/serum LDH ratio >0.6
• Pleural ﬂuid LDH >two-thirds the upper limit of normal serum LDH.
These criteria are very sensitive in the diagnosis of exudative effusions,
although may occasionally falsely identify transudates as being exudates,
e.g. patients with partially treated heart failure on diuretics may be misidentiﬁed as exudates.

5. Further investigations if the diagnosis remains unclear:
• CT chest with pleural contrast (ideally scan prior to complete ﬂuid
drainage, to improve images of pleural surfaces; useful in distinguishing
benign and malignant pleural disease, p 346).
• Repeat pleural ﬂuid cytology
• Further pleural ﬂuid analysis (p 54), e.g. cholesterol, triglyceride,
haematocrit, glucose, amylase, fungal stains
• Pleural tissue biopsy for histology and TB culture (ultrasound- or
CT-guided, closed Abrams’, or thoracoscopic biopsy; image-guided
biopsies are superior to Abrams’ for malignant disease; use Abrams’
biopsy only in cases when tuberculosis is suspected; thoracoscopy is
‘gold-standard’; biopsies have sensitivity of 90% for malignancy and
allow therapeutic talc pleurodesis at the same time)
• Reconsider pulmonary embolism and tuberculosis
• Consider thoracoscopy if persistent undiagnosed pleural effusion.
Bronchoscopy has no role in investigating undiagnosed effusions unless
the patient has haemoptysis or a CXR/CT pulmonary abnormality. Pleural
ﬂuid may compress the airways and limit bronchoscopic views, and so if
bronchoscopy is indicated it is best performed following drainage of the
effusion.

TRANSUDATIVE PLEURAL EFFUSIONS

Transudative pleural effusions
Mechanisms involve either increased hydrostatic pressure or reduced
osmotic pressure (due to hypo-albuminaemia) in the microvascular
circulation.

effusion, chest pain, fever); frequently
complicated by pulmonary embolism
(up to one-ﬁfth of cases at autopsy)

Atelectasis

Common on ITU or post-operatively; usually
small effusion, may be bilateral; rarely needs
investigation

Less common

May be unilateral or bilateral

Hypothyroidism

May be transudate or exudate; pleural effusions
occur most commonly in association with
ascites, pericardial effusion, and cardiac failure,
although may be an isolated ﬁnding

Meigs’ syndrome

Unilateral (often right-sided) or bilateral pleural
effusions and ascites; occurs in women with
ovarian or other pelvic tumours; resolves

Urinothorax

Effusion ipsilateral to obstructed kidney with
retro-peritoneal urine leak, resolves after
treatment of obstruction; pleural ﬂuid smells
of urine, pH usually low; pleural ﬂuid creatinine
>serum creatinine is diagnostic

Malignancy

Up to 5% are transudates

Treatment of transudative effusions is directed at the underlying cause;
consider further investigation if fails to respond.

Other, rare causes

Include yellow nail syndrome, cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia, amyloidosis, familial Mediterranean fever

Treatment of exudates involves treatment of the underlying cause,
as well as measures to improve breathlessness and remove pleural
ﬂuid, e.g. therapeutic thoracentesis (p 783), intercostal drainage (p 760),
and pleurodesis (p 776).

CHAPTER 8

Pleural effusion

Pleural ﬂuid analysis 1
‘Routine’ pleural ﬂuid analysis comprises assessment of:
• Pleural ﬂuid appearance
• Biochemistry (protein and LDH)
• Cytology (for malignant cells and differential cell count; ideally fresh
20-mL sample)
• Microbiology (Gram stain and microscopy, culture, and AFB stain and
culture; inoculation of blood culture bottles with pleural ﬂuid may
increase yield)
• pH
Although considered routine, some of these investigations may be
unnecessary and even misleading, depending on the clinical picture (e.g.
microbiological analysis on patients suspected as having transudates).
Additional pleural ﬂuid investigations such as measurement of cholesterol
and triglycerides, haematocrit, glucose, and amylase may be helpful in
certain clinical circumstances.

CHAPTER 8

Pleural effusion

Pleural ﬂuid analysis 2
Pleural ﬂuid pH and glucose Pleural ﬂuid pH may be measured
using an arterial blood pH analyser. The sample should be appropriately
heparinized, e.g. aspirate a few mL of pleural ﬂuid into a pre-heparinized
blood gas syringe. Frankly purulent samples should not be analysed—it is
unnecessary, and might damage the machine.
Normal pleural ﬂuid pH is about 7.6. An abnormally low pH (<7.3)
suggests pleural inﬂammation and is often associated with a low pleural
ﬂuid glucose (<3.3 mmol/L or pleural ﬂuid/serum glucose ratio <0.5). The
mechanism probably involves increased neutrophil phagocytosis, and bacterial or tumour cell breakdown, resulting in the accumulation of lactate
and carbon dioxide.
Causes of low pH and low glucose effusions
• Parapneumonic effusion and empyema (pH <7.2 indication for drainage
of pleural space, as unlikely to resolve spontaneously)
• Rheumatoid pleuritis (glucose <1.7 mmol/L in 66% and <2.8 mmol/L in
80% of cases)
• Malignant pleural effusion (associated with advanced disease and poor
survival, higher sensitivity of pleural ﬂuid cytological analysis, and failure
of pleurodesis)
• Tuberculous pleural effusion
• Oesophageal rupture
• Lupus pleuritis.
Urinothorax is the only transudative effusion that can cause a pH <7.3.
An abnormally high (alkaline) pH may rarely occur in the setting of Proteus
pleural infection.

Pleural ﬂuid triglyceride and cholesterol Measure in turbid or
milky effusions or where chylothorax is suspected.
Chylothorax occurs following disruption of the thoracic duct, and pleural
ﬂuid may appear turbid, milky, serous, or blood-stained. The presence of
pleural ﬂuid chylomicrons or a pleural ﬂuid triglyceride level >110 mg/dl
conﬁrms the diagnosis. Causes of chylothorax:
• Malignancy (particularly lymphoma)
• Trauma
• Following thoracotomy
• Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
Pseudochylothorax occurs due to cholesterol crystal deposition in chronic
effusions, most commonly due to rheumatoid pleurisy or tuberculosis, and
may cause a milky effusion; raised pleural ﬂuid cholesterol (>200 mg/dl)
and cholesterol crystals at microscopy distinguish it from chylothorax.

PLEURAL FLUID ANALYSIS 2

Pleural ﬂuid amylase Abnormal if pleural ﬂuid amylase > upper
normal limit for serum amylase, or if amylase pleural ﬂuid/serum ratio
>1.0. Causes include:
• Pleural malignancy and oesophageal rupture (both associated with
raised salivary amylase)
• Pancreatic disease (acute and chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst;
associated with raised pancreatic amylase).
NB. May be normal early in the course of acute pancreatitis or oesophageal
rupture.

Post-operative
breathlessness

57

58

CHAPTER 9

Post-operative breathlessness

The respiratory physician is often asked to see patients post-operatively
who have become dyspnoeic following an operative procedure. The risk
of pulmonary complications is greatest with thoracic or upper abdominal
surgery, when a degree of pulmonary dysfunction and consequent breathlessness due to atelectasis is inevitable. Always rule out upper airway
obstruction.

The four most likely common causes are:
•
•
•
•

Infection/atelectasis
Pulmonary emboli
Left ventricular failure (ﬂuid overload)
Exacerbation of underlying lung disease, such as COPD or UIP.

Points to consider when assessing these patients
• Is the patient acutely unwell, needing immediate resuscitation and
ventilatory support?
• Comorbid disease and past medical history, especially pulmonary,
cardiac, or thromboembolic disease
• Type of surgery
• Thoracic surgery: consider lobar gangrene (torsion of the remaining
lobe causing vascular occlusion) leading to pulmonary infarction
with fever and haemoptysis, bronchopleural ﬁstula, often associated
with an infected pleural space, leading to sepsis and failure of the
underlying lung to re-expand
• Time since surgery:
• Early complications (hours) related to residual anaesthetic effect not
adequately reversed, atelectasis, respiratory failure, hypovolaemic
shock, infection, PE, fat embolism, air embolism, left ventricular
failure and ﬂuid overload, myocardial ischaemia
• Later complications (hours–days) related to PE, ARDS, infection,
myocardial ischaemia.

Initial tests to consider performing in these patients
• Oxygen saturations and arterial blood gas breathing room air and on
oxygen
• ECG
• CXR—compare with pre-operative CXR, if available
• Full blood count and clotting screen
• U&E and bicarbonate
• See if they had pre-operative oximetry and spirometry performed.
There should be a record of the oxygen saturation in the anaesthetic
room.
A D-dimer level is unhelpful as it will be raised by many different intra- and
post-operative mechanisms.
CRP and WCC are also largely unhelpful as these are frequently raised
post-operatively.

POST-OPERATIVE BREATHLESSNESS

Table 9.1 Assessment of dyspnoea
Possible cause of dyspnoea

Management options

Basal atelectasis (commoner in
smokers and following abdominal or trans-thoracic procedures. Mucus in bronchial tree
causes small airway obstruction, subsequent alveolar air
reabsorption, and collapse
of lung segments); collapsed
lobe—mucus plugging

Adequate analgesia to encourage expectoration,
nebulized saline, chest physiotherapy, deep
breathing. If lung does not reinﬂate, consider
bronchoscopy to suction out secretions

If fever and chest signs, give antibiotics for
hospital-acquired pneumonia (see p 436),
adequate analgesia to encourage expectoration,
chest physiotherapy
Thromboembolic disease
Oxygen as required. Measure A–a gradient
on blood gas. Start treatment dose of
unfractionated heparin (if not contraindicated
by the operation), arrange VQ scan or CTPA,
check D-dimers (although unhelpful unless
negative). If in extremis consider urgent CT or
echocardiogram and thrombolysis (see p 401)
Respiratory failure
Opiate overdose or anaesthetic agents causing
neuromuscular block not reversed. Undiagnosed
respiratory muscle weakness
Metabolic acidosis
Check U&E, look for underlying problem, such
as renal failure or sepsis
Myocardial ischaemia
Oxygen, check cardiac enzymes and 12-h
troponin. Sublingual or IV glyceryl trinitrate if
required for pain. Start prophylactic heparin
(if not contraindicated by the operation)
Myocardial infarction or
Thrombolysis likely to be contraindicated by
recent surgery, so consider referral for primary
acute coronary syndrome
angioplasty. Consider aspirin, clopidogrel, low
molecular weight heparin
Cardiac failure/ﬂuid overload Oxygen, IV furosemide, central line, and ionotropes
if required. Echocardiogram to assess left ventricle
ARDS
Supportive, likely to need mechanical ventilatory
assistance (see p 101)
Phrenic nerve damage causing Diagnose on lung function tests, CXR, and
clinically decreased diaphragm movement. Advise
diaphragmatic paralysis. May
occur with thoracic operations to tilt whole bed (head up) when sleeping.
Phrenics may recover, but can take 2+ years
such as CABG
Oxygen, IV ﬂuids, supportive care
Fat embolism following long
bone fracture, especially with
reaming and manipulation
Laryngeal spasm
Reassurance, oxygen if required
Anaemia
Cross-match and transfuse. Identify if ongoing
bleeding source
May need intubation and ventilation. Stop all
Myasthenia gravis crisis
anti-cholinesterases. Consider plasma exchange
precipitated by anaesthetic
and IV immunoglobulin. Urgent neurology input

Pregnancy and
breathlessness
Causes 62
Investigations 64

CHAPTER 10

Pregnancy and breathlessness

Causes
Normal physiological changes of pregnancy
• Elevated serum progesterone levels stimulate respiratory drive and
lead to an increased tidal volume and raised minute ventilation, with
only a modest increase in oxygen consumption. The subsequent fall
in maternal pCO2 facilitates fetal CO2 transfer across the placenta;
any cause of maternal hypercapnia leads quickly to fetal respiratory
acidosis. Respiratory rate is unaffected by pregnancy. Elevation of the
diaphragm occurs due to the enlarging uterus, leading to a reduced
functional residual capacity, although diaphragm function is normal
and vital capacity is unaffected. Peak ﬂow and FEV1 are unaffected by
pregnancy
• Increased cardiac output occurs due to an increase in heart rate
(by about 15 beats/min) and stroke volume; peripheral resistance falls.
Blood pressure is reduced in the ﬁrst and second trimesters by
10–20 mmHg, but is normal at term. Peripheral pulses tend to be
increased in volume. Dependent oedema is common. Third heart
sound and ejection systolic murmurs are commonly heard. May hear
venous hums in the neck
• Raised levels of coagulation factors and impaired ﬁbrinolysis,
combined with venous stasis, result in a 5-fold increased risk of venous
thromboembolism
• Upper airway oedema, particularly in the setting of pre-eclampsia,
may predispose to upper airways obstruction during sleep, but rarely
frank obstructive sleep apnoea. OSA tends to occur in obese women,
and may be associated with impaired fetal growth and pre-eclampsia.
Snoring in pregnancy is a poor predictor of OSA.

Causes of breathlessness in pregnancy
Causes are listed in the box opposite. In general, breathlessness may be
due to:
• Normal physiological changes of pregnancy. Up to 75% of pregnant
women experience a degree of breathlessness, perhaps as a result of
the increase in ventilation. Tachypnoea is a useful sign, as it is abnormal
in pregnancy and suggests an underlying disease process
• New disease process. Pulmonary embolism is the commonest and is a
major cause of maternal death. Other rare, but serious, causes include
amniotic ﬂuid embolism and ARDS
• Exacerbation of chronic respiratory or cardiac disease. Asthma is the
commonest. Unsuspected underlying disease may present for the ﬁrst
time in pregnancy, e.g. structural heart disease such as mitral stenosis,
lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Pulmonary hypertension is associated
with a particularly poor prognosis during pregnancy. Patients with
interstitial lung disease and vital capacity <1 L should also consider
avoiding pregnancy. In patients with cystic ﬁbrosis, the presence of
pulmonary hypertension or FEV1 <50% predicted are associated with a
poor outcome.

CAUSES

Causes of breathlessness in pregnancy
Pulmonary
• Exacerbation of pre-existing lung disease, e.g. asthma (p 140), cystic
ﬁbrosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis
• Pneumonia (p 419)
• Bacterial: usual organisms, including tuberculosis (p 502) and aspiration (p 442)
• Viral: particularly varicella, inﬂuenza (p 538, 532)
• Fungal: particularly coccidioidomycosis (p 483)
• Aspiration pneumonitis
• Pulmonary metastases from choriocarcinoma (very rare).
Pleural
• Pneumothorax (p 373), particularly during labour
• Small asymptomatic effusions post-partum
• Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (very rare).
Vascular
• Pulmonary embolism (p 401)
• Amniotic ﬂuid embolism (p 416)
• Air embolism (p 416)
• Pulmonary hypertension (p 385).
Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema
• Exacerbation of pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g. mitral stenosis
• Peripartum cardiomyopathy.
Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema
• Iatrogenic ﬂuid overload
• Tocolytic therapy (ß-agonists used to inhibit uterine contractions in
preterm labour)
• ARDS due to pre-eclampsia, sepsis, massive haemorrhage, amniotic
ﬂuid embolism.
Other
• Anaemia
• Oesophageal rupture
• Hemidiaphragm rupture.

CHAPTER 10

Pregnancy and breathlessness

Investigations
Liaise with your obstetrics team, as well as with paediatricians and anaesthetists, if delivery is approaching. Management of speciﬁc conditions is
discussed in the individual disease chapters in Part 2.
The following investigations may be affected by the pregnancy itself:
• ABGs. Normal maternal pO2 >13.3 kPa and pCO2 3.7–4.3 kPa.
A compensatory fall in serum bicarbonate (to 18–22 mmol/L) occurs,
resulting in an average pH of 7.44. During the third trimester, perform
ABGs in an upright position, as pO2 may be 2.0 kPa lower when supine.
A–agradient is unaffected during pregnancy, except when supine near
term
• Blood tests. In normal pregnancy, WCC, platelets, ESR, D-dimers,
and ﬁbrinogen are usually raised, and serum creatinine levels reduced.
CRP is not signiﬁcantly affected. D-dimer is increased from about
6 weeks gestation to 3 months post-partum
• CXR may show increased pulmonary vasculature due to normal
increase in cardiac output. Required for diagnosis of pneumonia and
pneumothorax. With abdominal shielding, the radiation doses to
mother and baby are very small and CXR should be performed if
clinically necessary. Lateral CXR carries a greater radiation exposure
and should be avoided
• Ventilation–perfusion scans are considered relatively safe in
pregnancy, and are the investigation of choice if pulmonary embolism is
suspected (although some experts suggest performing leg vein
ultrasound ﬁrst; if an asymptomatic DVT is conﬁrmed in the setting
of clinical features suggestive of pulmonary embolism, then treatment
may be started without the need for radiation exposure from further
imaging). If V/Q is non-diagnostic, consider pulmonary angiography;
the radiation exposure from the combination of CXR, V/Q, and
angiography is not thought to be associated with fetal injury.
CT pulmonary angiography carries a greater radiation dose and, in the
setting of the hormonal changes within the breast during pregnancy,
leads to an increased risk of breast cancer in the mother.

Pre-operative
assessment

65

66

CHAPTER 11

Pre-operative assessment

The respiratory physician may be asked to assess a patient prior to elective
or emergency surgery. These patients are usually those with pre-existing
respiratory disease, such as COPD.
• The usual functional status of the patient should be determined
• Their respiratory function should be optimized if possible, with medication changes where appropriate.
These patients may require ventilatory support post-operatively. Ultimately
the decisions regarding ﬁtness for surgery rest with the surgeon and the
anaesthetist.

Assessing the pre-operative patient
• Usual functional state and exercise tolerance (those with an exercise
tolerance of <5 m will not come off a ventilator)
• Oxygen saturations on air and after exertion, such as walking or
climbing up and down a step for 2 min
• Arterial blood gas on air, if saturations <94%. Risk of surgery increases
as the CO2 increases
• Spirometry, with bronchodilator reversibility testing. Risk of surgery
increased if FEV1 <0.8 L
• CXR—if 65+ and no CXR in last year, or if acute respiratory symptoms
• History of snoring or OSA
• ECG
• Echocardiogram, if cardiac function compromised.

Options for management of the pre-operative patient
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Regular inhaled or nebulized bronchodilators, if air ﬂow obstruction
Regular inhaled steroid, if evidence of steroid reversibility
Pre-operative course of oral steroids, if evidence of steroid reversibility
Pre-operative course of antibiotics, if evidence of infection
Consider pulmonary rehabilitation
Consider chest physiotherapy with deep breathing exercises
Referral for CPAP if OSA present
Optimize nutrition
Lose weight
Advise to stop smoking—ideally 8 weeks prior to surgery; reduces
post-operative complication rate.

Risk factors for peri-operative complications

CHAPTER 12

Pulmonary disease (non-HIV)

Clinical assessment
Respiratory disease is a signiﬁcant cause of morbidity and mortality in the
immunocompromised, and its diagnosis and management are challenging.
In the UK this is encountered most commonly in the setting of immunocompromise secondary to cytotoxic chemotherapy, haematological
malignancy, immunosuppression post-transplant (particularly renal and
haematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT, including bone marrow, fetal
cord blood, and growth-factor-stimulated peripheral blood transplantation]), prolonged corticosteroid use, and AIDS (p 79).
Most pulmonary diseases present in a similar manner in the setting
of immunocompromise, with fever, dyspnoea, dry cough, chest pain, and
often hypoxia. This non-speciﬁc clinical presentation, combined with the
large number of possible causes, makes reaching a precise diagnosis difﬁcult; the diagnosis remains unclear in up to 10% of cases even at autopsy.
There is limited evidence to demonstrate that obtaining a deﬁnitive diagnosis leads to an overall improvement in mortality, although, in subgroups
such as patients with respiratory infection, early identiﬁcation and treatment of pathogens has been shown to improve outcome.
Causes of pulmonary inﬁltrates in the non-HIV-infected immunocompromised are presented on p 72, and treatment on p 76. Speciﬁc conditions are described separately (e.g. invasive aspergillosis, p 470; PCP,
p 476).
Key steps in the management of these patients are as follows.

Clinical assessment In the history, the underlying cause of immunocompromise and the timing and location of respiratory disease onset may
provide clues to the diagnosis. The rate of disease onset may also suggest
possible causes:
• Acute onset (<24 h) Bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonitis (e.g. CMV),
pulmonary oedema or haemorrhage, pulmonary emboli, ARDS
• Subacute onset (days) Fungi (e.g. Pneumocystis, Aspergillus), bacteria
(e.g. Nocardia, Legionella), viral (e.g. CMV), drug-induced pneumonitis
• Chronic onset (weeks) Malignancy, mycobacteria, fungi.
Chest examination may suggest the extent of pulmonary involvement,
although this can be misleading and there are often no abnormal signs
(e.g. PCP, or bacterial pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia). Assess
ﬂuid status; pulmonary oedema is common following transplantation.
Extrapulmonary involvement may be helpful in suggesting a pathogen, e.g.
cutaneous lesions (herpes simplex and varicella-zoster; necrotic lesions
from Pseudomonas and other Gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, and
fungi; subcutaneous abscesses in Staphylococcus aureus and Nocardia),
central nervous system involvement (Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus,
Nocardia, mycobacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae,
varicella-zoster).

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

Initial investigations
• CXR appearance is very variable; may be normal or show consolidation,
nodular inﬁltrate, or diffuse shadowing. CXR is of limited diagnostic
value, as appearances are non-speciﬁc and atypical presentations are
common; the ‘ﬁrst-choice’ diagnosis based on CXR is correct in only a
third of cases. CXR may, however, be helpful in monitoring disease
progression and response to treatment
• Blood and pleural ﬂuid (if available) sampling for microscopy and
culture. Consider viral serology (e.g. CMV following transplantation),
urinary Legionella antigen
• Sputum examination is often of little diagnostic value in immunocompromised patients, with the possible exceptions of invasive aspergillosis
and tuberculosis. Send sputum for acid-fast stain and mycobacterial
culture, fungal stain, and culture. Induced sputum has a low yield for
PCP in non-HIV patients
• The degree of hypoxia is often not appreciated; measure oxygen
saturations and consider ABGs. Severe hypoxia tends to be more
commonly associated with infection due to bacteria, viruses, or
Pneumocystis than with mycobacteria or fungi.

Is immediate antibiotic treatment required? Immediate empirical
treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to further investigation
should be considered, depending on the nature of immunological defect
and local hospital policy. In general, neutropenic patients with fever are
at signiﬁcant risk of developing overwhelming sepsis, and should receive
prompt antibiotic cover, irrespective of the CXR appearance and presence or absence of respiratory symptoms/signs. More invasive diagnostic
procedures can then be reserved for patients who deteriorate or fail to
improve within a period of observation (e.g. 2–3 days). In non-neutropenic
patients, depending on the clinical circumstances, it is often possible to
withhold treatment until deﬁnitive investigations have taken place.

CHAPTER 12

Pulmonary disease (non-HIV)

Further investigations
More invasive diagnostic techniques are usually required for a deﬁnitive
diagnosis.

CT chest
• Speciﬁc indications not yet deﬁned. Probably not needed in typical
cases of bacterial pneumonia or PCP
• Useful in identifying the location and extent of pulmonary disease, and
aiding invasive sampling procedures
• Often detects pulmonary disease in the presence of a normal CXR—
consider if respiratory symptoms or unexplained fever, but normal
CXR
• May be diagnostic, e.g. pulmonary embolism (CTPA), lymphangitis
carcinomatosis, invasive aspergillosis (‘halo’ and ‘air crescent’ signs).

Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage
• First-line investigation; consider early in management. Diagnostic in
about 60% of patients overall; up to 70% of patients with infection. Results
in change to treatment in around 50% of cases overall. Complications
are rare
• Useful in the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia, PCP (sensitivity
80–90%), cytomegalovirus (sensitivity 85–90%), aspergillosis (sensitivity
50%), tuberculosis, malignant disease, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, and
alveolar proteinosis
• BAL ﬂuid analysis—routine microscopy and culture for bacteria;
additional stains and culture for fungi, mycobacteria, Nocardia; silver or
immunoﬂuorescence stain for Pneumocystis; cytology, including ﬂow
cytometry, for malignant cells; viral serology; haemosiderin-laden
macrophages if alveolar haemorrhage suspected
• Consider additional tests on BAL ﬂuid, such as Cryptococcus antigen
detection or CMV PCR. Aspergillus antigen detection or PCR and
Toxoplasma gondii PCR are less well validated
• Transbronchial biopsy has a slightly higher sensitivity than BAL for the
diagnosis of infection, but carries a risk of bleeding and pneumothorax,
which can be serious complications in this patient group; it is not
usually performed at initial bronchoscopy, although may be considered,
e.g. if lymphangitis is suspected.

Lung biopsy Consider as a second-line investigation if BAL is nondiagnostic. Options include:
• Repeat bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy is useful in the
diagnosis of malignancy, mycobacteria, fungi, organizing pneumonia, and
drug-induced lung disease
• VATS or open lung biopsy has a greater diagnostic yield than TBB,
although it is unclear if this can be directly translated into an improved
survival. Results in change to treatment in <50% of patients and
complications may be serious
• Percutaneous image-guided ﬁne-needle aspiration or biopsy for
investigation of peripheral nodules.

CHAPTER 12

Pulmonary disease (non-HIV)

Causes
Causes of pulmonary disease in the immunocompromised can be broadly
divided into infectious and non-infectious; multiple disease processes are
common. The nature of immunosuppression may provide clues to the
cause(s) of pulmonary disease—solid organ (kidney and liver) transplants
are further discussed on p 74, lung transplantation on p 317, HSCT on
p 75, and HIV on pp 79-83.

Infectious causes (>75% of cases) Infection is the commonest cause of
respiratory disease in the immunocompromised. The nature of immunological defect may provide clues to the likely infectious agent:
• Neutropenia or impaired neutrophil function (e.g. secondary to
leukaemia or cytotoxic treatment) Bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, Klebsiella, H. inﬂuenzae, Nocardia), fungi
(Aspergillus, Candida, Mucormycosis)
• Impaired T-lymphocyte function (e.g. secondary to transplantation,
cytotoxic treatment, high-dose steroids, lymphoma, AIDS) Fungi
(PCP, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida, Histoplasma, Coccidioides,
Blastomyces), viruses (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, varicellazoster), bacteria (mycobacteria, Listeria, Legionella, Nocardia), parasites
(Toxoplasma gondii)
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia or impaired B-lymphocyte function (e.g.
secondary to myeloma, acute and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,
lymphoma) Encapsulated bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. inﬂuenzae).
It should be noted, however, that considerable overlap exists between
immune deﬁciencies, and the pattern of infection will be further modiﬁed
by prophylactic treatment, e.g. CMV and PCP prophylaxis.

Non-infectious causes (<25% of cases) Often present with similar, if
not identical, clinical and radiological features to infection, and signs such
as fever do not reliably differentiate between them. Causes include:
• Pulmonary oedema Particularly following renal or HSCT transplant
• ARDS e.g. secondary to sepsis, drugs (e.g. cytarabine, gemcitabine,
OKT3 antilymphocyte antibodies, interleukin-2), massive blood transfusion, transfusion-related acute lung injury, aspiration, ‘engraftment
syndrome’ (coinciding with neutrophil engraftment) following HSCT
• Drug-induced disease Causes include all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA),
antithymocyte globulin, azathioprine, bleomycin, busulfan, carmustine,
chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea,
liposomal amphotericin B, melphalan, mitomycin, methotrexate, sirolimus
• Respiratory involvement from the underlying disease e.g. lymphoma,
leukaemic inﬁltration, lymphangitis carcinomatosis, connective tissue
disease, leucostasis with very high leucocyte counts in leukaemia
• Pulmonary embolism Often complicated by secondary infection;
clinical/radiological features may be confused with invasive aspergillosis;
may be more common after kidney transplant
• Radiation-induced pulmonary disease Pneumonitis (dyspnoea;
clear margins on CT; typically follows lung radiotherapy) or organizing
pneumonia (cough; extends beyond radiation ﬁeld on CT; typically
follows breast radiotherapy)

CAUSES

• Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage not uncommon complication of leukaemia, and allogeneic or autologous HSCT; similar clinical presentation to that of pneumonia; haemoptysis is rare; multilobar CXR/CT
inﬁltrates; proposed diagnostic criteria include exclusion of infection,
progressively bloodier returns from BAL of three different subsegmental bronchi (although limited sensitivity and speciﬁcity), and ≥20%
of alveolar macrophages haemosiderin-ﬁlled (although may require
several days to appear); reported mortality ranges 30–100%
• ‘Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome’ following allogeneic or autologous
HSCT; breathlessness with hypoxia and multilobar CXR/CT inﬁltrates;
infection excluded with BAL and ideally a second later investigation
(e.g. repeat BAL or lung biopsy); diffuse alveolar damage or interstitial
pneumonitis on biopsy; mortality >70%
• Engraftment syndrome comprises fever, ARDS, and erythematosus rash
during marrow recovery post-HSCT
• Chronic airﬂow obstruction (bronchiolitis obliterans) following allogeneic HSCT (from non-identical sibling or unrelated individual; occurs
only extremely rarely following autologous procedure); typically associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); gradual onset dry
cough, dyspnoea, wheeze, obstructive spirometry; CXR often normal;
air-trapping and bronchial dilatation on HRCT; TBB low sensitivity; may
be complicated by Aspergillus infection; variable course
• Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease most common following
lung transplant (p 317); may also follow other solid organ or allogeneic
HSC transplant
• Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (p 630)
• Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease
• Pulmonary metastatic calciﬁcation may complicate chronic renal failure
and rarely progress after transplantation; usually asymptomatic, rarely
causes restrictive ventilatory defect; CXR shows single or multiple
nodules or patches of consolidation, may not appear calciﬁed;
CT typically diagnostic, although biopsy occasionally needed
• Right hemidiaphragm dysfunction is common after liver transplant, and
usually not relevant clinically.

Multiple disease processes About 30% of patients have two or more
disease processes accounting for their respiratory involvement. Secondary
infection with a different infectious agent (commonly Aspergillus or
Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas) may complicate either a
primary respiratory infection or a non-infectious process such as pulmonary embolism. Secondary infection is associated with a poor prognosis;
consider particularly in patients who deteriorate after an initial response
to treatment, and in patients who are neutropenic.
Pleural effusion Differential diagnosis in non-HIV immunocompromised patients includes cardiac failure and ﬂuid overload, pulmonary
embolism, drug-related, parapneumonic (bacterial including Nocardia,
fungal, e.g. PCP), or related to underlying disease (e.g. leukaemic inﬁltrates,
lymphoma, chylothorax, myeloma). Pleural effusions are common after
liver transplant: usually right-sided or bilateral transudates and resolve by
third week; may require drainage if symptomatic.

CHAPTER 12

Pulmonary disease (non-HIV)

Treatment
Antimicrobials Depending on the clinical circumstances, antimicrobials
may need to be started prior to deﬁnitive investigations (see p 69), although
blood cultures should always precede antibiotic treatment. Choice of antimicrobial depends on the underlying condition and local hospital policy.
• In general, most neutropenic patients are treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics providing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative cover, e.g.
piperacillin (4.5 g IV qds); antifungals are considered if slow response to
treatment or subsequent deterioration. Consider vancomycin if MRSA
is a possibility
• Treatment for CMV and PCP is associated with signiﬁcant side-effects,
and ideally should be based on a deﬁnitive diagnosis. In unwell patients
who are strongly suspected to have PCP, treatment (p 478) can be
started immediately, as BAL Pneumocystis jiroveci stains remain positive
for up to 2 weeks
• Antituberculous treatment should only rarely be administered in the
absence of a microbiological diagnosis.

Diuretics Fluid overload and pulmonary oedema are common following
renal and HSCT transplantation, and typical clinical and radiological signs
may be disguised; consider a trial of diuretics.
Steroids Despite a lack of randomized controlled trials, prednisolone
(1–2 mg/kg/day PO, or up to 2 g methylprednisolone IV daily) is often
considered in the treatment of drug- or radiation-induced lung disease,
engraftment syndrome, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, and idiopathic
pneumonia syndrome following HSCT. Ideally exclude underlying infection
prior to starting steroids. Prednisolone (40–80 mg daily PO) is recommended for the treatment of PCP in patients with respiratory failure.
Bronchiolitis obliterans following allogeneic HSCT is usually treated with
increased immunosuppression.

Supportive treatment Administer oxygen to maintain saturations
>95%. Respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients is associated
with a poor outcome: mortality following intubation and mechanical ventilation ranges 60–100%. Early intermittent use of non-invasive ventilation
in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary inﬁltrates and hypoxia
(deﬁned as breathlessness, respiratory rate >30/min and PaO2/FiO2 ratio
<200) has been shown to reduce the need for intubation and improve
mortality. Before NIV is commenced, a decision regarding suitability for
intubation and mechanical ventilation should be made.
Surgery Surgical wedge resection or lobectomy may be considered in
the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, either acutely for lesions adjacent
to pulmonary vessels that are judged to have a signiﬁcant risk of massive
haemoptysis, or at a later date for residual lesions at risk of reactivation
with further chemotherapy.

CHAPTER 13

Pulmonary disease (HIV)

Clinical assessment
Widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and antimicrobial prophylaxis in HIV has resulted in a longer survival, as well as
changes in the nature of respiratory involvement. Respiratory disease
remains common in the setting of HIV, and patients should be managed in
consultation with an HIV specialist.
Causes of respiratory disease in the HIV-infected patient are listed
on p 83. Speciﬁc conditions are described separately (e.g. PCP p 476,
TB p 487). Key steps in management are as follows.

Clinical assessment
• As with other causes of immunocompromise, clinical features of
respiratory disease in HIV-infected patients are non-speciﬁc: breathlessness, cough, fever, weight loss, and fatigue are common, although chest
symptoms are not always present
• Ask about treatment and compliance with HAART and PCP prophylaxis
• Source of HIV infection may be relevant: Kaposi’s sarcoma occurs
particularly in homosexual men, and in African men and women; tuberculosis and bacterial pneumonia are more common in IV drug users
• Travel history may be useful: infection with ‘endemic mycoses’ (e.g.
histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis) is well recognized in
the USA, but rare in the UK
• Careful examination may provide clues to the respiratory condition.
Pulmonary Kaposi’s sarcoma is unusual in the absence of disease elsewhere; palatal Kaposi’s sarcoma in particular is predictive of pulmonary
involvement. Extrapulmonary mycobacterial disease is common, and
may involve the liver, lymph nodes, pericardium, and meninges.

Investigations
CXR
• CXR changes are relatively non-speciﬁc
• PCP classically appears as bilateral perihilar inﬁltrates that progress
to alveolar shadowing; more unusual patterns include small nodular
inﬁltrates or focal consolidation. CXR is normal in 10% of cases.
Pneumothorax is suggestive of PCP
• Appearances of bacterial pneumonia are often atypical, e.g. diffuse
bilateral inﬁltrates mimicking PCP
• Pleural effusion or hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy are unusual in
PCP, and are more suggestive of mycobacterial infection or Kaposi’s
sarcoma. CXR cavitation is unusual in tuberculosis occurring late in the
course of HIV.
CD4 count Useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Bacterial infection,
including tuberculosis, occurs at any stage of disease, although infection
is more severe at lower CD4 counts; PCP and atypical presentations of
tuberculosis occur most commonly at CD4 <200 × 106/L; non-tuberculous
mycobacteria, Kaposi’s sarcoma, and lymphoma occur late in the disease
(CD4 <50 x 106/L). A recent increase in CD4 count (following the introduction of HAART) may suggest an immune reconstitution inﬂammatory
syndrome (IRIS, see opposite).

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

Blood cultures should be taken prior to antimicrobial treatment. Bacteraemia
is relatively common with bacterial pneumonia in HIV, particularly with
S. pneumoniae infection. Bacteraemic tuberculosis may occur in advanced
disease.
Other blood tests Raised inﬂammatory markers are a non-speciﬁc ﬁnding.
Sputum Induced sputum may assist the diagnosis of PCP and mycobacterial disease. Induced sputum has a sensitivity of about 60% for the diagnosis of PCP. Tuberculosis is more likely to be smear-negative in the setting
of HIV, as cavitation in these patients is less common. Induced sputum
should ideally be obtained in a negative-pressure room.
Other cultures Consider sampling urine, stool, lymph node, or bone
marrow in suspected mycobacterial disease, as extrapulmonary disease
is common.
CT chest is useful in looking for evidence of respiratory disease in patients
with symptoms but a normal CXR, and may be helpful in directing invasive
diagnostic procedures. CT is also of beneﬁt in the diagnosis and staging of
Kaposi’s sarcoma and lymphoma.

Immune reconstitution inﬂammatory syndrome (IRIS) [immune
restoration disease (IRD) or paradoxical reaction] is a fairly poorly deﬁned
clinical syndrome resulting from restored immunity to infectious or noninfectious antigens, following the introduction of HAART. The mechanism
is uncertain, but probably includes partial recovery of the immune system
or an exuberant host-antigen response with host genetic susceptibility.
It is more likely in the context of current infection due to mycobacteria,
herpes, varicella, and CMV. The clinical features are variable and diverse,
and depend on the underlying infectious or non-infectious agent. A clinically silent infection may be ‘unmasked’ as the CD4 count rises, and may
be associated with an excessive inﬂammatory response.
The commonest clinical features are fever, lymphadenopathy, and worsening respiratory symptoms. New pulmonary inﬁltrates and pleural effusions are common. TB-IRIS tends to develop within 2 months of the start
of HAART, and CNS TB-IRIS is reported up to 10 months after HAART
initiation.
Corticosteroids seem to be effective although no RCT data exist.
Various regimes are suggested, including methylprednisolone 40 mg bd
and prednisolone 20–70 mg od for up to 7 weeks. Infectious agents must
also be treated and, in the very unwell, this may mean empirical treatment for PCP and TB, and high-dose steroids, whilst awaiting conﬁrmatory
microbiology.

81

82

CHAPTER 13

Pulmonary disease (HIV)

Further investigations and treatment
Bronchoscopy and BAL
• Bronchoscopy and BAL are safe and frequently diagnostic in this patient
group, and should be considered early in management, particularly in
the presence of a diffuse CXR abnormality or following non-diagnostic
induced sputum analysis. BAL should also be considered in patients
with a localized CXR abnormality that has not responded to a trial of
broad-spectrum antibiotics
• BAL ﬂuid analysis: routine microscopy and culture for bacteria;
additional stains and culture for fungi, mycobacteria, Nocardia; silver or
immunoﬂuorescence stain for Pneumocystis; cytology, including ﬂow
cytometry for malignant cells; viral serology. Consider additional tests
such as Cryptococcus antigen detection or CMV PCR
• Both Nocardia and Rhodococcus equi stain weakly acid-fast, and may be
confused with mycobacteria
• Kaposi’s sarcoma appears as ‘raised bruises’ in the trachea or bronchi
on bronchoscopy; routine biopsy is not recommended, as diagnostic
yield is low and signiﬁcant haemorrhage may occur.

Lung biopsy If bronchoscopy and BAL are non-diagnostic, consider
repeat bronchoscopy with TBB or surgical lung biopsy. TBB has a greater
sensitivity than BAL, but potentially serious complications, such as pneumothorax or haemorrhage are signiﬁcantly more common.

Treatment
• Consider broad-spectrum antibiotics and empirical treatment for PCP
(high-dose co-trimoxazole, and steroids if the patient is in respiratory
failure p 478). BAL Pneumocystis stains remain positive for up to
2 weeks despite treatment, and so empirical treatment for PCP should
not be delayed if the patient is unwell and this diagnosis is
suspected
• Further antimicrobial treatment can be directed at speciﬁc pathogens
isolated from BAL or biopsy. CMV is commonly isolated from BAL
ﬂuid, but rarely, if ever, causes lung disease in the setting of HIV and the
value of antiviral treatment in such cases is unknown
• Supportive therapy with oxygen; consider NIV. ITU admission for
invasive ventilation may be required. PCP is the commonest cause of
respiratory failure requiring ITU admission in HIV-positive patients.
Mortality from PCP requiring mechanical ventilation is about 60%,
although it may be signiﬁcantly higher in patients with low CD4 counts
• Steroids may be effective in the treatment of non-speciﬁc interstitial
pneumonitis and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis.

CHAPTER 14

Sleep and ventilation

History
The problem Sleep apnoea and related problems are now a common
reason for referral to many respiratory units. This is due to a much better
recognition of the syndromes and the increasing prevalence of obesity
in the general population. Most respiratory units with sleep services are
seeing patients primarily for possible obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and,
therefore, most patients tend to be sleepy and referrals for insomnia are
not usually encouraged.
Patients arrive at a respiratory sleep unit for several different reasons.
They are commonly:
• Concerns that the patient may have sleep apnoea, with or without a full
house of symptoms
• Loud snoring, with the patient or spouse seeking advice about noise
reduction
• Referrals from the ENT department who may be considering offering
surgery for snoring and wish to exclude OSA ﬁrst
• Excessive daytime sleepiness, diagnosis unclear, might just be OSA,
might be narcolepsy, etc.
• Assessment pre bariatric surgery as prevalence of OSA very high
• Other nocturnal symptoms such as sleep walking, panic arousals, etc.
Thus in sleep out-patients the issues revolve around making the correct
diagnosis of the excessive daytime sleepiness or nocturnal symptoms (and
referring on if appropriate), offering simple advice for snoring, or putting
the patient through the nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
induction programme.
Some units perform a sleep study ﬁrst on the basis of an appropriate
referral letter as it is more efﬁcient, others see the patient ﬁrst and then
book a sleep study if indicated. For the purposes of this account it is
assumed that the patient is seen ﬁrst.

History A clear history of the exact presenting complaint is obviously
necessary, concentrating on the following points when OSA is suspected
(a full discussion is available in the section on OSA, p 567).
• Sleepiness: how severe, what does it interfere with, over how long
has it been coming on, and does it reduce quality of life? The Epworth
sleepiness scale is useful to assess this (see p 89). This is scored out
of 24; 0–9 is considered normal and >9 excessively sleepy. It is only a
guide and should be interpreted with the overall history
• Important to differentiate sleepiness (tendency to nod off, due to
inadequate sleep) from tiredness (feelings of exhaustion due to many
causes, often without a tendency to nod off )
• Snoring and apnoeas. Best assessed from a witness: how loud,
continuous, intermittent, and are there recognized ‘stopping breathing’
or choking episodes during sleep?
• Other OSA symptoms, such as nocturia and restless sleep
• History of weight and neck size increases over the last 5–10 years
(recent weight gains common)

HISTORY

• History of nasal or other ENT surgery (previous palate surgery
increases discomfort of CPAP)
• Previous medical history (certain risk factors such as mandibular
surgery, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, Down's, Prader–Willi, etc.)
• Previous cardiovascular/cerebrovascular history and hypertension
history (may inﬂuence decision to treat)
• Alcohol and smoking history
• Occupation and shift working
• Driving issues, such as sleepiness while driving and ‘near misses’ or
actual sleep-related accidents
• Does the patient drive for a living and what kind of vehicle or licence?
If OSA seems unlikely, then other causes of sleepiness need to be considered, concentrating on the commonest.

Alternative diagnoses for excessive daytime sleepiness
• Depression, often missed
• Lifestyle issues—alcohol, late night working, shift work, caffeine
abuse, family circumstances, etc.
• Drugs—some of the antihypertensives (e.g. B-blockers) and psychoactive drugs (e.g. antidepressants and anxiolytics) can provoke
sleepiness
• Narcolepsy—e.g. associated with cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle
tone in response to excitement or anticipation), sleep paralysis
(frightening paralysis on wakening for a few seconds or minutes), and
proliﬁc vivid dreaming, often at sleep onset or during daytime naps
• Periodic limb movements during sleep (associated with restless legs
during the day, especially in renal failure)
• Post-severe head injury or cranial irradiation (hypothalamic damage)
• Post-infectious (e.g. Epstein–Barr virus)
• Idiopathic (sometimes hereditary)
• Certain neurological disorders such as myotonic dystrophy,
Parkinson’s, and previous stroke
• Simply being at the sleepier end of the normal spectrum
• The symptom may really be tiredness, such as in ‘ME’ or insomnia,
when the ESS is usually low
• Blind insomnia/sleepiness—circadian problem when 24-h cycle not
linked with the real world through blue light exposure and melatonin
production.

CHAPTER 14

Sleep and ventilation

Examination and investigations
Examination of these patients is often relatively unhelpful.
In OSA the main features to look for are:
• Neck circumference (best measure of the obesity contribution to the
cause of OSA, >17 in) and BMI
• Oropharynx, usually crowded with boggy mucosa, with perhaps large
tonsils
• Teeth, crowding suggests retrognathia/micrognathia (and mandibular
advancement devices require sound teeth)
• Nasal patency (how easy will nasal CPAP be?).
Also:
• Assessment of respiratory function, signs of cor pulmonale, FEV1/VC
ratio and SaO2 (COPD increases likelihood of being in type II ventilatory
failure, so-called ‘overlap syndrome’)
• Blood pressure (may inﬂuence decision to treat OSA)
• Evidence of endocrine abnormalities: hypothyroidism, acromegaly,
Cushing’s, diabetes.
It may also be appropriate to look for:
• Evidence of a neuromuscular disorder, including a previous stroke
• Evidence of heart failure (central sleep apnoea, or Cheyne–Stokes
respiration, which can produce overnight oximetry traces similar to
those of OSA).

Clinic tests to perform
• Blood gas estimation if respiratory failure suspected (these OSA
patients require more urgent treatment)
• Thyroid function (hypothyroidism not always clinically obvious) plus
other hormones if indicated
• Routine haematology and biochemistry (prevalence of type II diabetes will be high in this overweight population)
• Some would recommend a fuller cardiovascular risk assessment
including cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, glucose, and folate since
these patients are often in a high risk group (untreated 10-year cardiovascular event risk typically predicted to be about 35%).

Other scenarios If it is known already from a prior sleep study that
the patient has OSA, then the clinic appointment will revolve around a
joint decision between the doctor and the patient as to whether a trial of
treatment is indicated (usually nasal CPAP). This will depend mainly on the
severity of symptoms vs. the perceived inconvenience of the treatment.
An abnormal sleep study is not a reason in its own right to prescribe
CPAP. Weight loss is important, but rarely achievable, and other treatable
causes of OSA must not be missed (e.g. hypothyroidism, tonsillar hypertrophy) simply because nasal CPAP is available.

EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATIONS

If the patient has come via ENT and is being considered for pharyngeal
surgery, then the respiratory physician’s role is to dissuade the patient from
this route as the objective success rate is poor and the hazards signiﬁcant. The presence of signiﬁcant OSA is a contraindication to surgery. All
other approaches to snoring, such as the use of mandibular advancement
devices, should be considered ﬁrst, and pharyngeal surgery regarded as
the last resort of the totally desperate.

CHAPTER 15

Unexplained ventilatory failure

Causes
Deﬁnition Ventilatory failure is conventionally divided into type I
(hypoxia only, PaO2 <8 kPa) and type II (hypoxia and hypercapnia, PaCO2
>6 kPa): they are conceptually quite different. Type I is an increased alveolar-to-arterial (A–a) oxygen gradient (implying increased ventilation/perfusion mismatch, V/Q), with adequate alveolar ventilation to maintain a
normal PaCO2. The number of causes is vast, including most of respiratory
medicine, and requires the usual ‘history, examination, and investigations’.
A more difﬁcult, less common, clinical scenario is an unexplained rise
in PaCO2 (>6 kPa, type II), with no obvious cause following a standard
assessment. This may occur in the out-patient, ward, A&E, or ICU setting.

Pathophysiology A rise in PaCO2 can be due to V/Q mismatch with
inadequate compensatory hyperventilation, e.g. overwhelming asthma,
when there will also be a large A–a gradient indicating this increased V/Q
mismatch. However, it can also be due to inadequate ventilatory drive,
or primary ventilatory pump failure, where the A–a gradient will usually
be normal. The list below contains mainly the causes that might not have
been suspected from the initial assessment, but for completeness also
includes more obvious causes. The conditions with asterisks are the ones
most commonly discovered when the cause is not immediately obvious.
Failure of drive
Brainstem abnormality
• Polio and post-polio syndrome* (exact mechanism unclear)
• Brainstem stroke (involvement of respiratory centres bilaterally)
• Arnold–Chiari malformation—herniation of cerebellum into foramen
magnum compressing the brainstem
• Syringobulbia—expansion of a ﬂuid compartment in the middle of
the spinal cord extending up into the medulla (can be associated with
Arnold–Chiari malformation)
• Surgical damage during operations for Arnold–Chiari and syringobulbia
• Encephalitis
• Brainstem tumour
• Congenital—usually presents soon after birth, can be later;
abnormalities of neural crest development due to increased number
of ‘alanine repeats’ in one of the homeobox genes (PHOX2B)
Suppression
• Sedative drugs, including alcohol, opiates, etc.*
• Metabolic alkalosis (hypokalaemic alkalosis, diuretic-induced, prolonged
vomiting)

CAUSES

Pump failure
Neurological (particularly if diaphragm involved)
• Myopathies
• Acid maltase deﬁciency (Pompe’s), diaphragm paralysis commonly
occurs early on*
• Duchenne muscular dystrophy
• Myotonic dystrophy
• Several other very rare primary or secondary myopathies, e.g. limb
girdle, hypothyroid, drugs (hydroxychloroquine)
• Neuropathy
• Motor neuron disease (MND)* can affect diaphragm early on
• Bilateral diaphragm paralysis*, e.g. trauma, bilateral neuralgic
amyotrophy (also known as ‘brachial neuritis’, inﬂammatory damage
to nerves of lower brachial plexus—cause unknown)
• Guillain–Barré
• Spinal muscular atrophy, autosomal recessive, spinal cord motor
neurons
• High cord transection
• Neuromuscular junction abnormalities
• Myasthenia gravis*
• Lambert–Eaton Myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)
• Anti-acetylcholine esterase poisoning (usually from organophosphate insecticides)
• Mixed
• Post- ITU (‘critical care neuropathy’), post muscle relaxant drugs*
• Chest wall
• Obesity*
• Scoliosis*
• Post thoracoplasty (usually ‘three stage’, many ribs caved in starting
from the top down—done for tuberculosis prior to effective
chemotherapy)
• Flail chest
• Pneumothorax/large effusion
• Severe ankylosing spondilitis
• Airways obstruction/mixed
• Unrecognized COPD/severe asthma*
• Obstructive sleep apnoea and additional COPD/obesity/muscle
weakness*, sometimes called ‘overlap syndrome’.
The ventilatory loading effects of obesity, COPD, and OSA can summate to
produce ventilatory failure, when on their own they would not be regarded
as of sufﬁcient severity. Estimating the contribution each is making to an
individual’s ventilatory failure can inﬂuence therapy, and expectations of
success: e.g. if OSA dominant (>4% SaO2 dips/h >30) the ventilatory failure
is likely to respond to CPAP; dominant COPD (FEV1 <25% predicted) will
need maximal lower airways dilator therapy (thresholds only for general
guidance); but the likely poor response of the lower airways obstruction
will mean that even limited additional weight reduction, and/or treatment
of milder OSA, may be useful in the latter situation.

CHAPTER 15

Unexplained ventilatory failure

Clinical presentation
Slow onset
In several of the above conditions, e.g. acid maltase deﬁciency, MND, and
scoliosis, the onset of ventilatory failure can be insidious and include:
• General fatigue and/or hypersomnolence
• Headaches on awakening
• Morning confusion
• Morning cyanosis
• Ankle oedema (ﬂuid retention, cor pulmonale, from the hypoxia).
• Dyspnoea standing in the swimming pool (this usually indicates
diaphragm paralysis, as pressure of water, even at 1 m depth, pushes
unopposed diaphragm further up into the chest)
• Swallowing difﬁculties (often MND), or other evidence of a more
generalized proximal neuromuscular problem.
Rapid onset
Sometimes the signiﬁcance of these symptoms is missed for a while and a
relatively trivial respiratory tract infection tips the balance and the patient
goes into severe ventilatory failure with coma. These individuals will end
up ventilated on ICU and may be difﬁcult to wean, or present again with
ventilatory failure a few weeks after discharge.

CHAPTER 15

Unexplained ventilatory failure

Clinical assessment and management
History, examination, and investigations
History Carefully taken history, e.g. symptoms of subtle weakness prior
to presentation, episode of shoulder pain (neuralgic amyotrophy), past
history of polio, orthopnoea (diaphragm weakness), drug history. Often
this is not available as the patient may present unconscious.
Examination Thorough examination, particularly neurological, e.g. fasciculation, diaphragm weakness (inward drawing of abdomen on inspiration or
snifﬁng—masked if on positive pressure ventilation), myotonia, as well as
rarer signs seen in some of the conditions listed previously.
Blood gases taken breathing air (following >20 min off extra O2)
• Degree of CO2 retention
• Presence of a base excess indicating chronicity of CO2 retention
• Calculate A–a gradient to detect any V/Q mismatch (p 792)
• In pure hypoventilation there should be no signiﬁcant A–a gradient
(<2 kPa), unless there is associated basal atelectasis from poor lung
expansion and/or obesity.
Pulmonary function tests (p 827)
• Presence of unexpected severe airways obstruction
• Reduced vital capacity (neurological or chest wall)
• Further fall of VC (>20% deﬁnitely abnormal) on lying down—
indicative of diaphragm paralysis. A supine VC of <25% predicted is
most predictive of this being the main cause of the raised PaCO2.
• Mouth pressures, sniff pressures, or trans-diaphragmatic pressures; not
much more helpful than lying and standing VC.
Speciﬁc tests—for some of the conditions listed above such as:
• EMG studies–MND, myotonia
• MRI–Gadolinium enhanced: Arnold–Chiari, brainstem lesion, syrinx
• CPK–Some myopathies
• Sleep study–E.g. (i) REM hypoxia (early marker of ventilatory failure
when supine VC usually has dropped below 60% predicted normal),
(ii) continuous nocturnal hypoventilation (when supine VC has dropped
below 40% predicted), and (iii) obstructive sleep apnoea
• Blood ﬁlm for abnormal lymphocyte cytoplasmic vacuolation (mainly
acid maltase deﬁciency)
• Muscle biopsy–acid maltase deﬁciency (glycogen-containing vacuoles
and low enzyme levels).

Management of the underlying condition, if available, is paramount.
Weak expiratory muscles and weak laryngeal adduction prevent effective
coughing with an increased incidence of serious chest infections. Clearing
retained secretions can be a major problem. Physiotherapists can help
teach patients and their carers sputum clearance techniques. Increasing
the lung volume with positive pressure devices (e.g. the Bird device) and
‘breath stacking’ allows a higher expiratory ﬂow with improved clearance.
Mechanical insufﬂator/exsufﬂator devices are available that both increase
inspiratory volume and speed expiratory ﬂows. Their role is still being
evaluated.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT

Lying down and sleeping with the whole bed tipped head up by about
20* greatly improves ventilation in the presence of bilateral diaphragm
paralysis. Just elevating the top half of the bed, leaving the abdomen and
legs horizontal, does not work. The abdominal contents have to descend
into the pelvis to effectively ‘ofﬂoad’ the diaphragm. This posture will also
improve the ability to wean from assisted ventilation.
In the situation of irreversibility, the decision will need to be taken as to
whether non-invasive ventilation is appropriate (p 693).

CHAPTER 16

Acute respiratory distress syndrome

Pathophysiology and diagnosis
Deﬁnition and epidemiology ARDS (previously shock lung) is not
a single entity, but represents the severe end of a spectrum of acute lung
injury due to many different insults. Essentially it is:
• Acute, persistent, lung inﬂammation, increased vascular permeability
• Bilateral and extensive inﬁltrates on the CXR
• Very poor oxygenation despite PEEP with variable ways of deﬁning the
severity of this. PaO2/FiO2 ratio <27 using kPa, or <200 using mmHg.
• e.g. PaO2 only 10 kPa on 0.60 (60%) O2, ratio = 16.7, therefore <27
• Not due to clinical left ventricular failure or associated with a wedge
pressure of over 18 mmHg (i.e. non-cardiogenic)
• Most commonly seen on the ITU where about 10% of such patients will
have ARDS depending on the deﬁnition.
The Murray lung injury score, grading ARDS, is based on plain CXR
ﬁndings, oxygenation, PEEP level, and respiratory system compliance (see
p 105).

Pathophysiology Inﬂammatory damage to the alveoli, either by locally
produced pro-inﬂammatory mediators, or remotely produced and arriving
via the pulmonary artery. The change in pulmonary capillary permeability
allows ﬂuid and protein leakage into the alveolar spaces with pulmonary
inﬁltrates. The alveolar surfactant is diluted with loss of its stabilizing effect,
resulting in diffuse alveolar collapse and stiff lungs. This leads to:
• Gross impairment of V/Q matching with shunting causing arterial hypoxia and very large A–a gradients. There are usually enough
remaining functioning alveoli such that a degree of hyperventilation
maintains CO2 clearance; thus hypercapnia is infrequently a problem
• Pulmonary hypertension will develop secondary to the hypoxia, but
this is probably helpful (aids V/Q matching), rather than deleterious
• Reduced compliance (stiff lungs) due to loss of functioning alveoli
(alveolar collapse, ﬁlled with ﬂuid and protein) and hyperinﬂation of
remaining alveoli to their limits of distension.
There are many causes of pro-inﬂammatory mediator release sufﬁcient to
cause ARDS and there may be more than one present. Common causes in
order of prevalence:
• Sepsis/pneumonia; secondary risk factors for developing ARDS, when
septic, are alcoholism and cigarette smoking
• Gastric aspiration (even if on a proton pump inhibitor, indicating that a
low pH is not the only damaging component)
• Trauma/burns, via sepsis, lung trauma, smoke inhalation, fat emboli, and
possibly direct effects of large amounts of necrotic tissue.
Less common causes
• Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), caused by any blood
product (possibly due to HLA/white blood cell antibodies, commoner
with older blood products, >6 units); usually occurs within a few hours
of transfusion. No speciﬁc therapy or evidence of steroid response
• Transplanted lung—worse if the lung poorly preserved

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS

•

•

•
•

Post-bone marrow transplant as bone marrow recovers
Drug overdose, e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, cocaine, aspirin
Acute pancreatitis
Near drowning
Following upper airway obstruction; mechanism unclear
Acute form of UIP/CFA. Also called AIP and used to be known as acute
Hamman–Rich syndrome (p 272).

The course of ARDS is fairly characteristic
Phase 1 is the early period of alveolar damage and hypoxaemia with pulmonary inﬁltration.
Phase 2 develops after a week or so as the pulmonary inﬁltrates resolve,
and on histology seems to be associated with an increase in type II pneumocytes (surfactant producers), myoﬁbroblasts, and early collagen formation.
Phase 3 if the patient survives, is the ﬁbrotic stage that leaves the lung with
cysts, deranged micro-architecture, and much ﬁbrosis on histology.

Clinical features ARDS should be considered in any patient with a predisposing risk factor who develops severe hypoxaemia, stiff lungs, and a
widespread diffuse pulmonary inﬁltrate. Approximately 1–2 days following
the clinical presentation of the precipitating cause (sepsis, aspiration,
etc.), there is rapidly worsening dyspnoea (9 a dry cough) and hypoxaemia, requiring rapidly escalating amounts of supplemental oxygen up to
100% via a non-rebreathe system (p 704). Coarse crackles in the chest.
Intubation and ventilation are nearly always required, although initiating
CPAP via a face-mask at 5–10 cmH2O with 100% O2 can improve oxygenation temporarily.

Diagnosis There are no speciﬁc tests that allow a conﬁdent diagnosis,
and exclusion of other more speciﬁcally treatable diagnoses is required.
The cause for the ARDS needs to be established and prevented from continuing or reccurring if possible. The CXR or CT show diffuse alveolar
inﬁltrates and air bronchograms, similar in appearance to cardiogenic
pulmonary oedema or diffuse pulmonary haemorrhage. Left ventricular
failure may be excluded on clinical grounds or by echocardiography, but
conﬁdent exclusion requires a wedge pressure measurement less than
18 mmHg. Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage can occur in Goodpasture’s,
Wegener’s, and SLE; clues will include a drop in haemoglobin, blood in the
airways and pulmonary secretions, and other clinical features of one of
these disorders. Some pulmonary infections (e.g. mycobacteria, Legionella,
PCP, viral pneumonia) may mimic ARDS and lavage ﬂuid may reveal these.
Some centres advocate lung biopsy to exclude alternatives, although the
diagnostic yield is very low if a lavage is negative. Occasionally, cancer and
lymphangitis carcinomatosa can also mimic ARDS, and these will show
on a lung biopsy.

CHAPTER 16

Acute respiratory distress syndrome

Management and complications
Management The essential aspects of management are to treat the precipitating cause, provide best supportive care with adequate oxygenation,
and avoid further damage from barotrauma, hyperoxia, and nosocomial
infections. Mechanical ventilation with PEEP and high inﬂation pressures
are almost always required to maintain oxygenation (%SaO2 values in the
low 90s are entirely adequate). There is some evidence that high inﬂation
pressures may worsen ARDS directly (micro-barotrauma); therefore, try
to maintain plateau pressures <30 mmHg.
Many special ventilation techniques have been tried to reduce the high
inﬂation pressures that result from the stiff lungs (low compliance). For
example, using low tidal volumes to reduce inﬂation pressures (6 mL/kg
ideal body weight compared with 12 mL/kg) reduces mortality by 10%.
Reducing the minute ventilation and allowing the PaCO2 to rise (permissive
hypercapnia), also reduces the inﬂation pressures.
Prone ventilation has been tried in an attempt to improve V/Q matching
and initial increases in PaO2 are observed, but with no apparent effect on
survival.
Several different artiﬁcial surfactants have been tried to try and improve
lung compliance, although good delivery to the abnormal areas is unlikely.
Although effective in animal models, the RCTs have been negative in
humans.
Different degrees of hydration have been compared, with reduced ﬂuid
balances improving gas exchange, but again with no impact on survival
(but no harm either).
High-dose steroids have been used, but there is evidence of harm
as well as beneﬁt, and minimal evidence of overall improved survival.
A recent meta-analysis concluded there was no overall signiﬁcant beneﬁt,
but certain subgroups may do slightly better and others worse: e.g. steroids
are possibly beneﬁcial during the ﬁrst 14 days, but detrimental thereafter.
A recent RCT (total n = 91) on prolonged methylprednisolone infusion
(1 mg/kg/day) for early ARDS (<72 h) showed improvement in a number of
outcomes and halved mortality.
Extracorporeal oxygenation/CO2 removal will buy time and allow the
lung to ‘rest’, but these techniques are very expensive and it is difﬁcult to
demonstrate any long-term beneﬁt.
Complications of ARDS include:
• The high ventilation pressures lead to barotrauma: pneumothorax,
surgical emphysema, pneumomediastinum. Pneumothorax may be
lethal, but difﬁcult to detect on a CXR in the supine patient
• Nosocomial infections occur in about half the patients, making
surveillance bronchoalveolar lavage important
• Myopathy associated with long-term neuromuscular blockade, high
steroid doses, and poor glycaemic control
• Non-speciﬁc problems of venous thromboembolism, GI haemorrhage,
inadequate nutrition.

MANAGEMENT AND COMPLICATIONS

Prognosis has improved over the last 20 years, probably due to improvements in supportive care rather than an ability to modify the inﬂammatory
process and its subsequent repair. Prognosis is worse with intra-pulmonary causes. Early deaths are usually due to the precipitating condition,
and later deaths to complications. Over half the patients will survive with
varying residual lung damage, although the pulmonary function tests often
show only minor restrictive abnormalities (and reduced kCO), indicating
the considerable capacity of the lung to recover.
Future developments
• The optimal level of PEEP in a particular patient is difﬁcult to predict.
Inadequate PEEP allows more atelectasis, but too high PEEP contributes
to over-distension of remaining alveoli and further barotrauma when
there are no more ‘recruitable’ alveoli. Ways to estimate the best PEEP
are under investigation. High-frequency ventilation has been around a
long while, but its place in ARDS is still unclear. More recently, liquid
ventilation with perﬂuorocarbons has been tried. These dense oxygencarrying liquids reduce the heterogeneity of ventilation by nullifying the
requirement for surfactant, thus recruiting the collapsed alveoli. There
are improvements in oxygenation but no evidence yet of increased
long-term survival.
• Nitric oxide (NO) has been tried with clear improvements in oxygenation, but very little effect on survival. The mode of action is not clear
and may be more than just vasodilatation. Inhaled prostacyclin is similarly unconvincing. Anti-inﬂammatory and anti-oxidant therapies are still
very much in the experimental phase. There are current trials looking
at low-dose inhaled carbon monoxide as an anti-inﬂammatory.
• Biomarkers from either blood or bronchoalveolar lavage are being
investigated as to their potential to predict steroid responsiveness
(e.g. procollagen).
• ‘Off the shelf’ artiﬁcial lung systems are now becoming clinically useful
to buy time while the lungs recover. The Novalung is an example, but
such therapy is very expensive.

CHAPTER 17

Asbestos and the lung

Asbestos
Asbestos consists of a family of naturally occurring hydrated silicate ﬁbres
that may be subdivided into two groups:
• Curly serpentine ﬁbres, of which chrysotile (white) is the only ﬁbre
currently in commercial use
• Straight needle-like amphiboles, which comprise crocidolite (blue),
amosite (brown), anthophyllite, tremolite, and actinolite
Fibres differ in their lung clearance kinetics and pathogenic potential;
amphibole ﬁbres clear more slowly from the lung and are more carcinogenic than chrysotile. Whilst asbestos usage in developed countries is
restricted, the use of chrysotile asbestos in developing economies continues to rise.

Mechanisms of exposure
Occupational exposure accounts for the majority of cases of asbestosrelated disease and includes:
• Mining, milling, and transport of asbestos
• Use of asbestos products, e.g. in construction and demolition, ﬂoor
tiling, insulation, ﬁreprooﬁng, textiles, friction materials (brake linings),
ship building, pipeﬁtting, electrical repair, boiler ﬁtting and lagging,
carpentry, plumbing, and welding.
Domestic exposure may include:
• Relatives of asbestos workers exposed to ‘carry home’ asbestos in hair
or clothes
• Following remodelling or renovation in contaminated buildings
• Local geological exposure from natural deposits, e.g. areas of central
and south-east Turkey, north-west Greece, and Corsica
• Urban environment (although undisturbed and non-friable asbestos
building insulation is not considered hazardous).
A complete occupational history is essential if asbestos-related disease
is suspected, and should include the method of exposure with dates and
names of employers. This information may be of medico-legal importance
and ideally should be elicited during the ﬁrst consultation.

Asbestos-related lung disease comprises:
• Benign asbestos-related pleural disease
• Pleural plaques
• Benign asbestos-related pleural effusion
• Diffuse pleural thickening
• Rounded atelectasis
• Asbestosis
• Mesothelioma
• Lung cancer.
Other diseases linked to asbestos exposure include pericarditis and,
perhaps, head and neck, and gastrointestinal cancers. Whether asbestos
exposure truly leads to an increased risk of lung cancer in the absence of
asbestosis remains controversial.

ASBESTOS

Asbestos-related disease typically exhibits a long latency period of
20–40 years from exposure. Peak industrial asbestos use in the UK
occurred in the early 1970s, and asbestos-related disease is likely to remain
common for at least the next 20 years. The incidence of mesothelioma is
forecast to peak in 2015–2020 in Europe.
All deaths should be notiﬁed to the coroner if asbestos-related disease
is suspected or proven.

CHAPTER 17

Asbestos and the lung

Benign asbestos-related pleural disease
Pleural plaques
• Most common manifestation of asbestos exposure
• Discrete areas of white or yellow thickening on the parietal pleura; may
calcify
• Bilateral and occur particularly on the posterolateral chest wall, over
the mediastinal pleura, and on the dome of the diaphragm
• Develop 20–30 years after exposure; incidence (but not the extent of
plaques) increases with longer duration of exposure; found in up to
50% of asbestos-exposed workers and may also occur after low-dose
exposures
• Usually asymptomatic, although if extensive may be associated with
mild breathlessness due to pleural restriction
• Effect on pulmonary function is uncertain: most studies have failed to
demonstrate abnormal lung function, although otherwise unexplained
mild airways obstruction or restriction has been described in some
populations of asbestos workers with pleural plaques—the mechanism
of this is unclear, although it may reﬂect asbestos-induced small airway
disease or early interstitial ﬁbrosis, respectively
• HRCT is more sensitive than CXR in detecting pleural plaques
• There is no evidence that plaques are pre-malignant
• No longer eligible for compensation (p 118)
• Tuberculosis, trauma, and haemothorax may each cause single pleural
plaques; multiple plaques are highly suggestive of asbestos exposure,
however.

Benign asbestos-related pleural effusions
• Relatively early manifestation of asbestos pleural disease; usually occurs
within 10 years of exposure
• Development is considered to be dose-dependent, although can occur
after minimal exposure
• Typically small and unilateral, and may be asymptomatic or occasionally
associated with pleuritic pain, fever, and dyspnoea
• Usually resolve spontaneously over a few months, although some recur
• The pleural effusion is an exudate, often bloodstained, with no
characteristic ﬁndings on pleural ﬂuid analysis
• Diagnosis depends on a history of asbestos exposure and the exclusion
of other causes, including mesothelioma
• Benign asbestos pleurisy may precede the development of diffuse
pleural thickening; there is no clear association with mesothelioma
• Treat symptomatically, with pleural aspiration for breathlessness and
NSAIDs for pain.

• Consists of extensive ﬁbrosis of the visceral pleura with areas of adhesion with the parietal pleura and consequent obliteration of the pleural
space
• Unlike pleural plaques, its margins are ill-deﬁned, and it may involve the
costophrenic angles, apices, and interlobar ﬁssures
• Development appears to be dose-related and may follow recurrent
asbestos pleurisy
• On CXR, it may be deﬁned as a smooth uninterrupted pleural opacity
extending over at least a quarter of the chest wall, with or without
obliteration of the costophrenic angles; on CT, the pleural density
extends more than 8 cm craniocaudally, 5 cm laterally, and is more than
3 mm thick
• Symptoms are relatively common and comprise exertional breathlessness and chest pain, which can be chronic and severe
• May lead to signiﬁcant restrictive pulmonary function impairment,
especially if the costophrenic angle is obliterated; hypercapnic
respiratory failure has been described
• Pleural biopsy may be required to distinguish it from mesothelioma
• Treatment is difﬁcult; decortication often fails to result in clinical or
functional improvement
• Patient may be eligible for compensation (see p 118).

Rounded atelectasis
(also known as folded lung, Blesovsky syndrome, or shrinking pleuritis
with atelectasis)
• Develops as contracting visceral pleural ﬁbrosis; ensnares and then
twists the underlying lung, resulting in the distinctive radiological
appearance of a rounded or oval pleural-based mass of 2.5–5 cm in
diameter
• Asbestos exposure is the most common cause, although any cause of
pleural inﬂammation may result in rounded atelectasis
• CT is often diagnostic, demonstrating a ‘comet tail’ of vessels and
bronchi converging toward the lesion, adjacent thickened pleura, and
volume loss in the affected lobe
• An atypical appearance may require biopsy to exclude malignant
disease
• Typically asymptomatic, although breathlessness or dry cough may
occur
• Usually stable or slowly progressive, and no speciﬁc treatment is
required
• Surgical decortication may improve symptoms, but frequently results in
reduced lung volumes and is not generally recommended.

CHAPTER 17

Asbestos and the lung

Asbestosis
Deﬁnition Chronic interstitial ﬁbrosis resulting from asbestos inhalation.
Causes Factors affecting disease development include:
• Degree and length of asbestos exposure—a clear dose–response
relationship exists; usually seen in workers with many years of high
exposure, although may follow a very high exposure of short duration,
resulting in a shorter latency period
• Fibre type—amphibole ﬁbres are probably more ﬁbrogenic than
chrysotile, although most exposures are mixed ﬁbre types
• Cigarette smoking increases the severity and rate of progression of
asbestosis.
Latency period from ﬁrst exposure to clinical disease is usually at least
15–20 years and may be >40 years.

Clinical features Insidious onset of breathlessness, dry cough. Bibasal
late-inspiratory crackles, clubbing in 40% of cases. May progress to respiratory failure, cor pulmonale.

Differential diagnosis includes other causes of interstitial ﬁbrosis,
particularly usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP).

Investigations
• CXR Bilateral symmetrical reticulonodular pattern, primarily affecting
the lower lobes peripherally, which may extend upwards to involve the
mid and upper zones; may progress to honeycomb lung. Massive bilateral upper lobe ﬁbrosis (without lower lobe involvement) is rare, but
well described. Associated pleural thickening or plaques may be seen,
and suggest a diagnosis of asbestosis, rather than UIP. Classiﬁcation is
based on size, thickness, and profusion of opacities. CXR insensitive to
early disease; may be normal in 15–20% of symptomatic biopsy-proven
asbestosis
• HRCT is more sensitive than CXR and is abnormal in 10–30% of cases
with a normal CXR. Features include basal ‘ground-glass’ opacities
(seen early in the disease), parenchymal bands, subpleural curvilinear
lines and opacities, interlobular septal thickening, and signs of ﬁbrosis
(traction bronchiectasis, loss of lobular architecture, honeycombing in
advanced disease)
• PFTs are classically restrictive with reduced lung volumes and transfer
factor, although obstructive or mixed patterns may also occur (perhaps
reﬂecting asbestos-induced small airway disease)
• Positive gallium scan may be seen with normal CXR; correlates poorly
with lung function
• Analysis of sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage may demonstrate
asbestos bodies, although sensitivity is limited. The ﬁnding of interstitial
ﬁbrosis in the absence of asbestos bodies on lung biopsy makes
asbestosis unlikely. Analysis of material for asbestos bodies is only very
rarely indicated, usually for research or litigation purposes.

ASBESTOSIS

In general, CXR and HRCT show only limited correlation with physiological disease severity.

Diagnosis Gold standard is pathological demonstration of ﬁbrosis with
mineralogical quantiﬁcation of asbestos bodies; in practice this is rarely
required and a diagnosis can be made on the basis of a history of signiﬁcant
asbestos exposure with appropriate delay between exposure and disease,
and radiographic evidence of ﬁbrosis.

Treatment
• No pharmacological treatment is of proven beneﬁt
• Supportive management, including supplementary oxygen as required,
inﬂuenza and pneumococcal immunization, smoking cessation, compensation if exposure was occupational (p 118).

Prognosis varies widely. After removal from exposure, progression
occurs in 5–40% of patients over 10 years; progression is faster following
greater exposure, although rapid progression over 1–2 years is unusual
and more in keeping with UIP. Fewer CXR opacities after exposure are
associated with better prognosis. Increased risk of developing lung cancer.

CHAPTER 17

Asbestos and the lung

Mesothelioma: diagnosis
Deﬁnition Malignant tumour of serosal surfaces (most commonly the
pleura) usually resulting from asbestos exposure.
Causes Asbestos is the major single cause and there is a history of occupational asbestos exposure in up to 90% of cases. All types of asbestos
can cause mesothelioma—amphibole is the most potent, but also evidence for chrysotile. Mean latent interval between ﬁrst exposure and
death is around 40 years; cases with latency <15 years are rare. Not doserelated (unlike asbestosis or bronchogenic cancers) and no evidence for
a threshold asbestos dose below which there is no risk, although the risk
at low exposure levels is small. No signiﬁcant association with smoking.
The mechanism through which asbestos ﬁbres result in mesothelioma is
unclear; possibilities include direct irritation of the parietal pleura, disruption of mitosis, generation of toxic oxygen radicals, and stimulation of
mitogen-activated kinases leading to proto-oncogene activation.
Other causes of mesothelioma include non-asbestos ﬁbres, such as
erionite, which is found in rocks in Cappadocia, Turkey—mesothelioma
accounts for up to a quarter of all adult deaths in local villages. Evidence
for simian virus 40 (contaminated polio vaccine in 1950s/60s) is limited.
Rare cases of mesothelioma caused by ionizing radiation or chest injury are
described. ‘Spontaneous’ mesothelioma in children is also documented.
Clinical features of pleural mesothelioma:
• Chest pain (typically dull ache, ‘boring’, diffuse, occasionally pleuritic),
breathlessness; a small proportion are asymptomatic. Profuse sweating
may occur
• Consider in any patient with a pleural effusion or pleural thickening,
particularly if chest pain is present
• Rarely may present with persistent chest pain and a normal CXR
• Weight loss and fatigue uncommon at presentation (<30% of cases)
• Clubbing is very rare (<1%)
• Chest wall invasion may be seen (especially at thoracentesis sites)
• Bilateral pleural involvement is unusual at presentation
• Paraneoplastic syndromes are described, e.g. disseminated intravascular
coagulation.

Differential diagnosis includes benign asbestos pleural effusion, diffuse
pleural thickening, and adenocarcinoma involving the pleura.
Investigations
1. Pleural ﬂuid aspiration typically reveals an exudative straw-coloured
or bloody effusion. Cytological analysis may provide the diagnosis (sensitivity ranges 32–84%), and is often useful in excluding other pathology,
e.g. adenocarcinoma. Pleural ﬂuid glucose and pH may be low in extensive
tumours. Mesothelioma may track through the chest wall along thoracocentesis sites; avoid repeated pleural aspiration if the diagnosis is suspected, and ‘tattoo’ aspiration sites with indelible ink to guide subsequent
prophylactic radiotherapy.

MESOTHELIOMA: DIAGNOSIS

2. Imaging CXR and CT features include:
• Moderate to large pleural effusion, usually with pleural nodularity and
enhancement following pleural contrast and involvement of mediastinal
pleura
• Localized pleural mass or thickening without free ﬂuid
• Uniform encasement of lung resulting in small hemithorax
• Local invasion of chest wall, ribs, heart, mediastinum, hilar nodes, and
diaphragm; transdiaphragmatic spread and invasion of contralateral
pleura
• Associated pleural plaques or interstitial ﬁbrosis in a minority of cases.
The role of MRI is unclear—it may provide additional information in some
cases, e.g. chest wall invasion, although is rarely required. PET may have a
role in distinguishing benign and malignant pleural disease as well as identifying lymph node spread for staging, although it is not widely used.
3. Biopsy The diagnosis should be conﬁrmed histologically except when
the patient is too unwell or too frail for biopsy. Ultrasound- or CT-guided
cutting needle biopsy and thoracoscopic biopsy of pleural masses have a
high diagnostic yield and should be used in preference to blind (Abrams’)
biopsy techniques. Early use of thoracoscopy may both provide a diagnosis
and enable treatment of large effusions with talc pleurodesis, thereby
avoiding repeated non-diagnostic procedures with attendant problems of
needle-track spread.

Histological subtypes
• Epithelioid (50% of cases; may be confused with adenocarcinoma;
better prognosis)
• Sarcomatoid (or ﬁbrous)
• Mixed (biphasic).
Immunohistochemistry is key to making the diagnosis. Positive staining for
calretinin indicates mesothelial origin (as opposed to adenocarcinoma),
and staining for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA, also called CA15-3
and mucin-1) in a peripheral distribution strongly suggests mesothelioma.
CEA staining is almost always negative in mesothelioma. Electron microscopy of histopathological specimens may also help to distinguish mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma.

Staging No widely accepted staging system. Proposed schemes include
Stage I–IV scheme and TNM classiﬁcation; surgery is required for ﬁnal
staging. Poor prognostic features include transdiaphragmatic muscle
invasion and involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes, male gender, poor
performance status, and sarcomatoid histology.

CHAPTER 17

Asbestos and the lung

Mesothelioma: treatment and outcome
Treatment
Management of pleural effusions Talc pleurodesis is the treatment of
choice, and early pleurodesis is preferable to repeated pleural aspirations.
This can be achieved either medically or at thoracoscopy, depending on
local resources. Pleurodesis is not possible if the lung does not re-expand
following drainage of pleural ﬂuid (‘trapped lung’), and the resulting recurrent pleural effusions are difﬁcult to manage; indwelling pleural catheters
allow ﬂuid drainage without needle aspiration and are useful in this situation. The value of pleuroperitoneal shunts remains uncertain.
Radiotherapy Prophylactic radiotherapy appears to reduce chest wall
invasion by tumour following pleural aspiration or biopsy: three fractions reduced the risk of tracking from 40% to 0 in a randomized study of
40 patients, although a more recent study failed to demonstrate a beneﬁt.
Recurrence may follow delayed prophylactic radiotherapy, so it is usually
administered within 4 weeks. Palliative radiotherapy provides pain relief in
a proportion of patients with chest wall pain, but is less useful in the treatment of breathlessness or SVCO.
Surgery There are currently no reported randomized controlled trials
assessing the outcomes of radical surgery, and its use is controversial.
It should be considered only in centres with experience and if there is a
ﬁrm diagnosis of epithelioid mesothelioma, the patient is otherwise ﬁt,
and there is no radiological evidence of lymph node involvement. Avoid
chemical pleurodesis in such cases. Operative mortality is approximately
6%. Trimodality therapy (extrapleuropneumonectomy followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy) may have a role; trials are pending.
Chemotherapy Patients with good performance status should have the
option of discussing chemotherapy with an appropriate specialist. Studies
have suggested limited beneﬁts with two different regimes. Pemetrexed
(an inhibitor of certain DNA synthesis proteins, e.g. thymidylate synthase)
plus cisplatin has an objective response rate (tumour shrinkage of >50%)
of 41% and appears to convey a survival advantage of just under 3 months
when compared with cisplatin alone; pemetrexed has recently been
approved by NICE, although it is expensive and ongoing treatment of an
individual may be dependent upon objective metabolic responses based
on CT-PET scanning. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin led to objective response
rates of 33 and 48% in two trials, with quality-of-life beneﬁts. Trials are
ongoing.
General management Early involvement of a pain relief and palliative care
service is required. Ensure adequate analgesia: opiates and NSAIDs for chest
wall pain; consider carbamazepine or sodium valproate for neuropathic
pain (from intercostal nerve or vertebral involvement); nerve blocks or cordotomy may be required. Breathlessness may be multifactorial, e.g. pleural
effusion, lung compression, chest wall restriction, pericardial involvement,
anaemia, pain, anxiety, and fear. Liaise with GP, specialist nurse, palliative
care teams. Remind GP that all deaths have to be reported to the coroner.
Discuss compensation issues (p 118).

MESOTHELIOMA: TREATMENT AND OUTCOME

Clinical course Median survival is 9–12 months from diagnosis. Typically
progresses by local extension, sometimes leading to involvement of the
contralateral lung or peritoneum, SVCO, cardiac tamponade, or spinal
cord compression. Distant metastases are common (50% at autopsy),
although occur late and are rarely clinically apparent.
Peritoneal mesothelioma is rarer than pleural mesothelioma, and
may be associated with more prolonged asbestos exposure. Remains
intra-abdominal in most cases. Clinical features include abdominal discomfort, weight loss, ascites, and in some cases organ involvement (e.g. intestinal obstruction). Fine-needle aspiration of omental masses may provide a
diagnosis, although laparoscopy is often required. Prognosis is worse than
for pleural mesothelioma, with median survival 7.4 months. No treatment
is of proven beneﬁt.
Mesothelioma has also been described affecting other serosal surfaces,
such as pericardium and tunica vaginalis.

Future developments
• Measurement of serum mesothelin-related protein (SMRP; a soluble
product of the surface protein mesothelin) may have a diagnostic role:
SMRP is frequently raised in patients with mesothelioma, but only very
rarely in healthy controls or patients with other malignant or inﬂammatory lung or pleural disease
• Microarray studies of gene expression in tumour samples may prove
to be useful in both distinguishing mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma
and in predicting prognosis
• Novel therapeutic strategies using immunotherapy (e.g. recombinant
interferon-alpha), gene therapy, anti-angiogenic agents, and photodynamic therapy are in development. Combinations of immunotherapy
with chemotherapy appear particularly promising.

CHAPTER 17

Asbestos and the lung

Compensation for asbestos-related
diseases
Identiﬁcation of asbestos exposure is essential for the patient to be able
to claim compensation. Patients are not eligible for compensation if their
exposure occurred whilst they were self-employed. There are two principal sources of compensation.
From the Government: apply to the Beneﬁts Agency (Department of Social
Security) for industrial injuries disablement beneﬁt, using form BI100PN.
Available for the following diseases:
• Diffuse pleural thickening
• Asbestosis
• Lung cancer associated with diffuse pleural thickening or asbestosis
• Mesothelioma.
There must be a clear history of asbestos exposure at work. Compensation
is not available for pleural plaques alone. If successful, may then apply for
a single payment from the government under the Pneumoconiosis, etc.
(Worker’s Compensation) Act 1979. The value of compensation reﬂects
the degree of disability from which the patient is considered to suffer and
their age at diagnosis. Next-of-kin may also claim within 6 months posthumously. The War Pensions Scheme may provide compensation for disease
resulting from asbestos exposure with HM forces (form WPA1).
From the Courts: Common law compensation directly from a previous employer. Can be claimed from the employer’s insurer, even if the
employer is now out of existence. Advise patient to seek advice as soon
as possible from a solicitor with relevant experience. Claims must be initiated within 3 years of the individual’s ﬁrst awareness that they have an
asbestos-related disease attempts to initiate claims after 3 years may be
statute barred. Inform the patient of this and document the conversation
in the medical notes. A Court of Appeal ruling in March 2006 concluded
that pleural plaques alone should now no longer be considered an indication for compensation, and a subsequent appeal failed to overturn this
ruling in the House of Lords. Awards for asbestosis range from £15,000
to £50,000, depending on symptoms and the degree of disability; such
patients may accept a greater ‘once and for all’ award and forego their
right to further claims in the event of mesothelioma developing. Typical
awards for mesothelioma are £45,000–£50,000 and additional amounts
may be claimed for care and future loss of wages; total compensation may
exceed £100,000. Successful claims have also been made for mesothelioma
occurring in relatives who were exposed to asbestos whilst washing work
clothes.

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Deﬁnition, epidemiology,
pathophysiology, aetiology
Deﬁnition There is no universally agreed deﬁnition; it is usually a clinical
diagnosis—a chronic airway inﬂammatory disorder with inﬂammation
due to complex interactions between inﬂammatory cells, mediators, and
airway cells. This is characterized by airway hyperreactivity to a variety
of non-speciﬁc stimuli, leading to a variable degree of airway obstruction,
some of which may become irreversible over many years.
In susceptible individuals this leads to recurrent episodes of wheeze,
chest tightness, breathlessness, and cough (particularly at night).
• The disease is associated with widespread and variable airﬂow obstruction, which may reverse spontaneously or with treatment
• Airway inﬂammatory changes lead to increased bronchial responsiveness to a variety of non-speciﬁc stimuli

Epidemiology It is the commonest chronic respiratory disease in the
UK, with a prevalence of 10–15%. There is a wide variation in disease prevalence, with highest levels seen in English-speaking countries (where there
is also a high prevalence of sensitization to common aeroallergens). The
reason for the increasing worldwide prevalence over the last few decades
is unclear.
Pathophysiology Best described as chronic eosinophilic bronchitis/
bronchiolitis. Airway inﬂammation is seen, with cellular inﬁltration by T
helper-2 (Th2) cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells. There is
large and small airway involvement, and cytokine production (platelet activating factor and leukotrienes).
Airway obstruction occurs due to a combination of:
• Inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration
• Mucus hypersecretion with mucus plug formation
• Smooth muscle contraction
This may become irreversible over time due to:
• Basement membrane thickening, collagen deposition, and epithelial
desquamation
• Airway remodelling occurs in chronic disease, with smooth muscle
hypertrophy and hyperplasia. This is now recognized as increasingly
important in the pathophysiology of the most difﬁcult to treat chronic
asthma

Aetiology This is due to a combination of genetic and environmental
factors, with many different genes identiﬁed.
Immunological mechanisms A subgroup of asthmatics are atopic, and
therefore react to antigen challenge by producing speciﬁc IgE from B lymphocytes. This leads to the formation of IgE–antigen complexes that bind
to mast cells, basophils, and macrophages, leading to the release of preformed mediators, such as histamine, and eosinophil chemotactic factor.
These factors cause bronchoconstriction and airway oedema.

DEFINITION, EPIDEMIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AETIOLOGY

Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, kinins, and platelet activating factor (PAF),
are all important secondary messengers involved in the inﬂammatory
response.
A subgroup of asthmatics (up to 25%) are now recognized to have noneosinophilic disease, which may be associated with a poorer short-term
response to inhaled corticosteroids, and is associated with neutrophilic
airway inﬂammation and innate immunity.
Genetic factors A hereditary component to asthma and atopy is well
established, and a number of chromosomes and linkages are implicated.
The multiple mechanisms and second messengers involved in asthma
make the contribution of the effects of speciﬁc genes difﬁcult to determine. Established susceptibility loci include the genes ADAM33, GPRA
(G-protein related receptor for asthma), and ORMDL3, a member of a
gene family that encodes transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum proteins.
The latter was very recently identiﬁed by a genome-wide screen, and its
function and role in the pathogenesis of asthma is not yet clear.
Hygiene hypothesis This suggests that early life exposure to endotoxin
switches off the allergic response (by reducing Th2-mediated responses),
leading to reduced allergen sensitivity later in life, therefore reducing
allergen-driven diseases such as asthma. Large epidemiological studies
support this hypothesis.
Environmental factors The increasing prevalence of asthma appears to be
associated with a rising standard of living worldwide, and not just in westernized societies. This has implicated a number of environmental factors.
A number of explanations are speculated (but not proven), including
dietary changes, a reduction in childhood infections, increased immunization, or a combination of all three.
Phenotypic differences It is increasingly recognized that ‘asthma’ is likely to
represent a number of different ‘diseases’ or subphenotypes, rather than
one disease with a unifying pathological mechanism. Subphenotypes may
differ in underlying pathophysiology, clinical features, and disease course,
and research aimed at clearly identifying such disease groups (for example,
through the use of biomarkers or the host genetic proﬁle) is ongoing.

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Clinical features
•
•
•
•

Cough
Shortness of breath
Wheeze
Chest tightness.

Classically these are variable, intermittent, worse at night, associated with
speciﬁc triggers, e.g. pollens, cat and dog dander, and non-speciﬁc triggers,
e.g. cold air, perfumes, and bleaches, due to airway hypersensitivity. Asthma
may be labelled ‘cough variant’ or ‘cough predominant’, when cough is the
major symptom.

Examination
•
•
•
•

May be entirely normal
Classically expiratory wheeze is heard
Chest deformity/hyperinﬂation - longstanding/poorly controlled asthma
Severe life-threatening asthma may have no wheeze and a silent chest.

Diagnosis
This is often a clinical diagnosis but should be supported by objective
measurements. Important to:
• Identify provoking factors, e.g. cold air, bleach, perfume, and environmental aeroallergens (grasses, pollen, hay), and any occupational
exposures
• Assess disease severity. Longitudinal studies show greater decline in
lung function in asthmatics than non-asthmatics—greater still in asthmatics who smoke.
Don’t forget to look for/ask about:
• Nasal symptoms–obstruction, rhinorrhoea, hyposmia
• Atopic dermatitis/eczema/hay fever
• Allergies including food allergy
• Reﬂux/GORD disease (treating reﬂux may improve asthma control)
• Laryngo/pharyngeal reﬂux (hoarse voice, throat clearing, acid in throat)
• Triggers—including exercise, menstruation
• Social situation/stresses
• Aspirin sensitivity (associated with later onset asthma and nasal polyps)
• Family history.

CLINICAL FEATURES

The diagnosis is based on the presence of:
• Symptoms (cough, wheeze, breathlessness)
• Day-to-day peak ﬂow variability (>15% variability or reversibility to
inhaled B2 agonist)
• Airway hyperresponsiveness.

Consider the diagnosis of asthma in:
•
•
•
•
•

Recurrent cough, episodic breathlessness, and wheeze
Chest tightness
Isolated or nocturnal cough
Exercised-induced cough or breathlessness
Hyperventilation syndrome (p 255).

Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA)
Deﬁned as chronic rhinoconjunctivitis, nasal polyps, and asthma
Asthma is precipitated by ingestion of aspirin or other NSAIDs
Occurs in up to 20% of asthmatics, and is commoner in women
The mechanism is thought to be via aspirin inhibition of the
cyclo-oxygenase pathway, with excess leukotriene production via
the lipo-oxygenase pathway
• BAL and urine in AIA patients show excess leukotrienes post aspirin
exposure
• Loss of anti-inﬂammatory prostaglandin E2 may also be important.
•
•
•
•

Oral allergy syndrome
A subset of patients sensitized to aeroallergens, such as tree and grass
pollens, develop localized lip angioedema after ingestion of speciﬁc fruits
that share cross-reactive epitopes with pollen allergens. The reaction
occurs immediately after ingesting the fruit. Cooked fruit is usually tolerated, presumably because the culpable proteins are denatured with
cooking. Birch pollens cross-react with apples, hazelnuts, and potato.
Ragwort shares epitopes with melon and bananas.

125

126

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Investigations
The number of investigations required depends on the certainty of the
diagnosis from the history, simple spirometry, and peak ﬂow recordings.
Most patients referred for a respiratory opinion will already have completed home peak ﬂow recordings and have had a CXR. Repeating PEFs
may still be of beneﬁt. Objective evidence of asthma is important before
starting long-term therapy with potentially harmful drugs, such as inhaled
steroids.
Essential investigations (on which the diagnosis is based)
• Peak ﬂow recording/simple spirometry to look for variability and
response to treatment. Airway obstruction leads to decreased peak
expiratory ﬂow rate (PEFR) and forced expiratory volume in one
second (FEV1), but these may be normal between episodes of
bronchospasm. If they are persistently normal, the diagnosis must be in
doubt. The diagnosis is certain if:
• 20% diurnal PEF variation on >3 days per week, in a week of peak
ﬂow diary measures
• FEV1 >15% decrease after 6 min exercise
• FEV1 >15% (or 200 mL) increase after 2 week trial of oral steroid
(30 mg prednisolone od)
• Bronchodilator reversibility testing FEV1 >15% (or 200 mL) increase after
short-acting B2 agonist therapy (e.g. salbutamol 400 µg by MDI with
spacer or 2.5 mg by nebulizer)
Non essential/optional investigations
• Blood tests
• FBC (eosinophilia—question the diagnosis if high total eosinophil
count; consider Churg–Strauss syndrome)
• IgE (associated atopy, i.e. positive skin prick tests to common
allergens, often with associated allergic rhinitis and eczema)
• Aspergillus precipitins (Aspergillus sensitivity, ABPA) see Chapter 41
• Speciﬁc IgE if other environmental triggers suspected
• CXR if atypical symptoms. May show hyperinﬂation or evidence of
localized abnormality simulating wheeze, e.g. adenoma (rare)
• Skin tests to deﬁne atopic constitution, or identify potential triggers
• Metacholine/histamine challenge measures bronchial
hyperresponsiveness (BHR) as a PC20, the dose of agent provoking a
20% fall in FEV1.
• Asthma is suggested by a PC20 below 8 mg/mL. Normal subjects have a
PC20 >16 mg/mL. The absence of BHR virtually excludes the diagnosis
of asthma; however, the presence of BHR does not prove asthma.
• Bronchial provocation tests aim to demonstrate bronchospasm to an
inhaled agent, usually occupational. The response to an aerosolized
sample of a suspected agent may be useful if the diagnosis of
occupational asthma is suspected, but PEF recordings at home, work,
and on holiday may be more useful. Should only be carried out in a
tertiary referral centre, under expert supervision

INVESTIGATIONS

• Sputum analysis Sputum eosinophilia may help conﬁrm the diagnosis
• Laryngoscopy/ENT examination Useful if concerns about nasal
symptoms or obstruction, e.g. from polyps, or to exclude upper airway
obstruction, or a vocal cord abnormality
• Bronchoscopy Rarely needed. Its main use is to exclude an obstructing
airway tumour, e.g. carcinoid
• Lung biopsy is very occasionally needed in those in whom no adequate
explanation for persistent and minimally reversible air ﬂow obstruction
is seen, to exclude another cause, e.g. bronchiolitis obliterans
• Biomarkers Studies support the use of exhaled NO to determine
optimum inhaled corticosteroid dose in moderate asthma. This may
also be useful in diagnosis.

Main differential diagnoses in asthma
Consider especially if unusual features in the history, or poor correlation between objective measures and symptoms, or poor treatment
response:
• Upper airway obstruction (breathlessness, noisy, stridulous breathing,
low peak ﬂows out of proportion to FEV1)
• Foreign body aspiration
• Tumour, especially tracheal (but can respond to steroids)
• CCF (young patient with a murmur)
• Vocal cord dysfunction
• Hyperventilation syndrome
• Chronic thromboembolic disease or primary pulmonary hypertension
• Interstitial lung disease
• Churg–Strauss syndrome (and other eosinophilic lung diseases)
• Bronchiolitis (p 159)
• Gastro-oesophageal reﬂux disease.

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Acute severe asthma
Most asthma deaths occur outside hospital and are:
• In patients with chronic severe disease
• In those receiving inadequate medical treatment
• In those who have been symptomatically deteriorating and may have
already sought medical help
• Associated with adverse behavioural and psychosocial factors.
Fatality in asthma is due to cardiac arrest secondary to hypoxia and
acidosis—reversal of hypoxia is paramount
Give high ﬂow oxygen

Risk factors for fatal or near fatal asthma
• Previous near fatal asthma, e.g. previous ventilation or respiratory
acidosis
• Three or more classes of asthma medication
• Repeated A&E attendances
• Large B2 agonist use
• Adverse psychosocial features
• Brittle asthma.
Brittle asthma—appears to be a particular subtype or ‘phenotype’
• Type 1—wide PEF variability (>40% diurnal variation for >50% of the
time over >150 days), despite appropriate therapy
• Type 2—sudden severe attacks on background of apparently good
control.

Severity of acute asthma
Moderate
• Increasing symptoms
• PEFR 50–75% predicted or best
• No features of acute severe asthma
• One hour following treatment in A&E, patients with PEF >75% predicted or best may be discharged home with appropriate changes to
their asthma medication in the absence of concerns, e.g.
• Signiﬁcant ongoing symptoms
• Compliance concerns
• Living alone
• Psychological problems or learning difﬁculties
• Previous near fatal or brittle asthma
• Nocturnal presentation
• Pregnant
• Exacerbation despite adequate oral steroid pre-presentation.

ACUTE SEVERE ASTHMA

Severe asthma
Deﬁned as any of:
• PEFR 33–50% predicted or best
• RR >25
• HR >110
• Inability to complete sentence in one breath.
Life-threatening asthma
Any one of:
• PEFR <33%
• SaO2 <92% (NB needs ABG)
• PaO2 <8 kPa
• Normal CO2 (4.6–6 kPa)
• Silent chest
• Cyanosis
• Poor respiratory effort
• Bradycardia/arrhythmia/hypotension
• Exhaustion
• Confusion
• Coma.
Near fatal asthma
• Raised PaCO2 and/or
• Needing mechanical ventilation with raised inﬂation pressures.

22 Hospital treatment of acute asthma
Airway—ensure no upper airway obstruction
Breathing—give high ﬂow oxygen
Circulation—gain IV access

Monitoring
• Record PEF on arrival in A&E, 15–30 min after starting treatment, and
regularly thereafter according to response
• Record O2 saturation and maintain ≥92%
• ABG for pH and PaCO2 if saturation <93% or other severe features
• Record and document heart rate and respiratory rate
• Measure glucose and potassium
• Oxygen—high concentration (40–60%) and high ﬂow mask, e.g.
Hudson
• CXR to exclude infection/pneumothorax.
NB CO2 retention following administration of high-ﬂow oxygen is not a
problem in acute asthma. A high CO2 indicates a life-threatening attack and
should precipitate urgent ITU review for ventilatory support, not controlled
oxygen therapy. CO2 is often low (due to hyperventilation). A normal
CO2 may indicate a tiring patient.

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

22 Hospital treatment of acute asthma (cont.)
Treatment
B2 agonist—inhaled or nebulized, e.g. nebulized salbutamol 2.5–5 mg,
driven by oxygen.
Give repeated doses, or continuous, e.g. 5–10 mg per hour.
Use IV only if inhaled therapy cannot be used reliably (rarely the case).
NB risk of hypokalaemia with B2 agonist and steroids.
Anticholinergic—nebulized ipratropium bromide added to B2 agonist
therapy may improve bronchodilatation in acute severe asthma, if poor
initial B2 agonist response.
Steroids—the earlier given in an attack, the better the outcome.
Oral is as effective as intravenous.
Dose 40–50 mg oral prednisolone, continuing for at least 5 days or until
recovery. There is no agreed deﬁnition of recovery, but sensible to continue oral steroids until peak ﬂow is maintained for 5–7 days. The dose
can be stopped abruptly (assuming the patient continues on inhaled
steroid). This does not apply to patients on repeated doses, or long-term
steroids, where a longer course may be appropriate.
Inhaled corticosteroids should be continued (or started as soon as
possible) as part of the chronic disease management plan.
IV magnesium sulphate—immediately if very severe, and if poor response
to above therapies, 1.2–2 g IV infusion over 20 min. The safety and efﬁcacy of repeated doses has not been assessed. Recent data suggest
nebulized magnesium may also be of beneﬁt, though must be adequately
diluted. Further data are awaited.
IV aminophylline—some patients may respond, give if poor response to
initial therapy, in acute severe or life-threatening disease.
Dose 5 mg/kg loading dose over 20 min, followed by continuous infusion
of 0.5–0.7 mg/kg (500 mg in 500 mL normal saline or 0.5% dextrose at
(0.5 x body weight in kg) mL/h). If on maintenance therapy, do not give
loading dose but start continuous infusion.
NB Needs therapeutic drug monitoring. Side-effects: nausea, arrhythmias, palpitations.
Antibiotics—only if infective element to the exacerbation. Most exacerbations are due to viruses, especially the common cold. C. pneumoniae
and M. pneumoniae are also implicated.
IV ﬂuids—patients are often dehydrated. Hypokalaemia (due to B2 agonists) must be corrected.
IM adrenaline—may be useful if near arrest, whilst waiting for ITU support.

ITU referral
Liaise with ITU early! Better to discuss early a patient who does not
subsequently need ITU input, than to ﬁnd you and your patient in difﬁculty, with no ITU bed.
There is no evidence to support the use of NIV in the management of
asthma. Hypercapnic respiratory failure in acute severe asthma is an urgent
indication for endotracheal intubation.

HOSPITAL TREATMENT OF ACUTE ASTHMA

When to discuss with ITU
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Worsening PEF despite treatment
Worsening hypoxia
Hypercapnia
Falling pH
Exhaustion/poor respiratory effort
Drowsiness/confusion

Discharge
Consider discharge when:
• Reduced B2 agonist dose
• Off nebulized drugs and on inhalers ≥24 h
• PEF ≥75% predicted or best
• Minimal PEF diurnal variation
• Appropriate education has been given.
Prior to discharge consider
• Reason for the exacerbation. Could it have been avoided?
• Check patient’s self-management plan/asthma action plan
• Check inhaler technique (p 686)
• Book an appointment with GP or practice nurse for within 24 h
• Book chest clinic appointment.

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Chronic asthma: management
Aim to minimize symptoms and prevent exacerbations, prevent the potential consequences of longstanding airway inﬂammation leading to airway
remodelling and chronic unresponsive airway obstruction, and improve
quality of life.
The emphasis should be on education, self-management, and personal
asthma action plans. Aim for:
• Minimal day and night symptoms
• No exacerbations
• Normal lung function and prevention of lung function decline with the
development of ﬁxed airﬂow obstruction
• No limit to physical activity
• Minimum steroid dose.
Treatment is based on disease severity using a step up/step down
approach, starting treatment at the level appropriate to disease severity,
based on the history, spirometry, and medication usage.

The main aims during out-patient review are:
• Ensure the diagnosis is correct and that symptoms are due to asthma
and not coexistent/alternative pathology (e.g. reﬂux, hyperventilation
syndrome, etc.)
• Aim for no symptoms/normal lung function on minimal treatment
• Ensure an action plan is in place for exacerbations
• Identify patients at risk of an adverse outcome.

Pharmacological management
British Thoracic Society Guidelines for the Management of Asthma
Step 1—mild intermittent asthma
• Short-acting B2 agonist
• Check compliance, inhaler technique (including Volumatic or other
spacer), and eliminate potential triggers
• 10 puffs per day (2 or more canisters/month) is a marker of poorly
controlled disease.
Step 2—regular preventer therapy
• Start at 400 µg/day beclomethasone (BDP) in a twice daily dose
• Titrate steroid dose to symptoms, aiming for lowest effective dose
• Local steroid side-effects only (oral candida, dysphonia) from BDP
≤ 800 µg per day
• Possible dose-related bone density effects at this dose or above
• Fluticasone (Flixotide®) provides equal clinical activity to budesonide
(e.g. Polemicist®) at half dosage. Mometasone (Asmanex®) is a new
inhaled steroid; the current limited evidence suggests it is equivalent to
twice the dose of BDP. Ciclesonide (Alvesco®) is another new inhaled
steroid. It is a pro-drug, and the available evidence suggests it may have
fewer local oropharyngeal side effects and less systemic activity than
conventional inhaled steroids. The clinical beneﬁt and efﬁcacy to safety
ratio data have not been fully established.

CHRONIC ASTHMA: MANAGEMENT

• Qvar® (beclomethaosne diproprionate) has a smaller particle size
and may be of beneﬁt in some, 400 µg bd is as effective as ﬂuticasone
500 µg bd
Step 3—add on therapy
• If taking 200–800 µg/day inhaled steroid, consider long-acting B2 agonist.
A combination preparation may be appropriate
• If there is no response to a LABA, stop it and increase the inhaled
steroid
• The combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and LABA is now
licensed as maintenance and reliever therapy, if a rapid onset LABA,
e.g. formoterol (Oxis®) is used, in the context of a personal asthma
action plan. It is not clear if this is superior to more conventional doses
of inhaled steroid and LABA.
Step 4—Poor control on moderate dose inhaled steroid and add on
therapy: addition of fourth drug
• Ensure deﬁnite beneﬁt is obtained from any of these subsequent drugs
before continuing
• Leukotriene receptor antagonist—about a third of patients respond.
May be useful if atopic or for exercise-induced asthma. Trial for 1 month
and stop if there is no response. Also indicated in allergic rhinitis—so
consider if this is present as well
• Theophylline (has side-effects, e.g. nausea, and needs therapeutic drug
monitoring)
• Slow-release oral B2 agonist.
Step 5—Continuous or frequent use of oral steroids
• NB Risk of side-effects if on oral steroids for >3 months or 3–4 courses
per year
• Warn patient of potential side-effects (hypertension, diabetes, cataracts,
gastric erosions) and ask GP to monitor. Start osteoporosis prophylaxis
with calcium and vitamin D, or a bisphosphonate. Document baseline
bone densitometry in those receiving prednisolone for more than
3 months (see p 678). See www.rcplondon.ac.uk
• Aim for the lowest possible dose steroid.

133

134

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Chronic asthma: additional treatment
options
Steroid-sparing drugs, e.g. methotrexate, oral gold, and ciclosporin—may
be useful if other treatments are unsuccessful. They may reduce long-term
steroid requirements, but all have side-effects and need haematological
surveillance. There are very few data to support their use, and signiﬁcant
variability in response. Guidelines suggest a 3-month trial, once other drugs
have proven unsuccessful, with treatment in a centre with experience of
their use.
Continuous subcutaneous terbutaline infusion via a portable syringe driver
may be useful. Standard dose is 5 mg over 24 h, but up to 15 mg/24 h may
be given. Use terbutaline nebulizer solution (2.5 mg/mL) e.g. for 10 mg/24 h,
use 4 ml of nebulizer solution, with 6 ml of saline, infuse the 10 ml over
24 h. Beneﬁcial effects have been reported in severe asthma, but safety
and efﬁcacy have not been assessed in RCTs. Best responders may be
those with marked PEFR variability (‘type 1 brittle asthmatics’) to allow
steroid reduction.
Omalizumub Recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against
IgE has been shown to reduce early and late asthmatic responses after
allergen challenge, and is now licensed for atopic individuals with difﬁcult
to control disease, in combination with other standard treatments. The
drug removes circulating and tissue IgE by promoting loss of high afﬁnity
IgE receptors on mast cells, basophils, and dendritic cells, leading to
reduced airway inﬂammation. Compared with placebo, it has been shown
to reduce exacerbation rates, with improvement in asthma symptoms and
quality of life scores, but with no overall change in lung function. Metaanalyses suggest a reduction of around 100 µg of inhaled corticosteroid is
achieved per day compared with placebo.
Omalizumub is given as a subcutaneous injection every 2–4 weeks.
The dose depends on the patient’s weight and serum IgE concentration;
the peak response is at 12–16 weeks and two-thirds of patients respond.
The serum IgE should be 30–700 IU (there is a high risk of anaphylaxis at
higher IgE levels).
There is some debate as to whether the high cost of the drug can be
justiﬁed. The 2007 NICE guidelines suggest its use for severe persistent
allergic asthma, which is unstable despite optimized standard therapy, and
should be used for a trial period of a maximum of 16 weeks, ceasing if
there is no clinical response.
Additional points
• Regular review—to ensure patients are on appropriate treatment for
their disease severity, and are maintained on the lowest possible inhaled
steroid dose. Step down treatment if patient stable for 3 months or
more. Step down inhaled steroid by reducing dose by 25% at 3-monthly
intervals.

CHRONIC ASTHMA: ADDITIONAL TREATMENT OPTIONS

• Asthma action plan—all patients with severe asthma should have an
agreed written asthma action plan (self-management plan), their own
peak ﬂow meter, and regular checks on compliance and inhaler
technique. A self-management plan should include speciﬁc advice
about recognizing loss of asthma control and action to take if asthma
deteriorates. Patients on low dose inhaled steroids (200 µg) should
have their dose increased ﬁve-fold at the start of an exacerbation. This
should not be extrapolated to higher inhaled steroid doses. The
previous recommendation of doubling the dose of inhaled steroid
at the start of an exacerbation is unproven.

Monitoring morbidity—the 3 RCP questions
In the last week or month:
• Have you had difﬁculty sleeping because of your asthma symptoms
(including cough)?
• Have you had your usual asthma symptoms during the day (cough,
wheeze, chest tightness, or breathlessness)?
• Has your asthma interfered with your usual activities (e.g. work,
housework)?

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Non-pharmacological management
Allergen avoidance may reduce severity of disease in sensitized individuals. House dust mite control measures need to be comprehensive—
there is no current evidence to support it, although trials are ongoing. Pet
removal may be useful, if the history is suggestive, and sensitivity has been
demonstrated by skin prick testing or raised speciﬁc IgE levels.
Smoking cessation may reduce asthma severity. Current and previous
smoking reduces the effect of inhaled steroid; these individuals may need
higher steroid doses.
Complementary therapies No current evidence exists.
Dietary manipulation No consistent evidence and none supported
by interventional trials. Low magnesium intake is associated with increased
asthma prevalence. Fish oils may be beneﬁcial.

Weight reduction in obese asthmatics leads to improved control.
Immunotherapy Desensitization using allergen-speciﬁc immunotherapy
may be beneﬁcial in a small subgroup of patients.

Buteyko breathing technique is a series of breathing exercises that
mimic yoga breathing techniques. One study showed a reduction in the
use of inhaled bronchodilator and steroid use in asthmatics carrying out
these exercises, with no change in lung function or bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Cochrane review of breathing exercises concluded that there
was no evidence of improvement in lung function, but improved quality
of life scores.

NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT

Future developments
New steroids Research for ‘dissociated steroids’ is ongoing. These are
steroids in which the useful anti-inﬂammatory effects (mediated by transcription factor inhibition) are dissociated from the side-effects (mediated
via glucocorticoid DNA binding). Safer steroids, e.g. ciclesonide, a new
once-a-day inhaled steroid, appear to have an improved side-effect proﬁle.
Ciclesonide is a pro-drug, activated by airway esterases, with fewer sideeffects due to high degrees of protein binding.
Eosinophil inhibitors A variety of approaches to inhibit eosinophil recruitment are under investigation, including adhesion molecule inhibition and
eosinophil chemotactic receptor inhibition.
Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors New generation phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 inhibitors, e.g. roﬂumilast, are being investigated in clinical trials. These
drugs have a broad anti-inﬂammatory action, with neutrophil inhibitory
effects. Early clinical trial data looks promising.
Cytokine modulators Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)–alpha plays an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Anti-TNF antibodies have been
beneﬁcial in the treatment of inﬂammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid
arthritis. Anti-TNF may be useful in the treatment of severe asthma, as it
may block other important leukotrienes, e.g. IL-13.
Bronchial thermoplasty This is the application of controlled radiofrequency energy to the airway wall, using a specialized catheter at bronchoscopy. It heats the tissue to about 65°C, reducing muscle mass in the
small and medium-sized airways, with several airways treated under direct
vision at each session. Three separate sessions are required to treat all
accessible airways. This has been assessed in a small non-randomized
study and is well tolerated. Improved asthma quality of life scores, reduced
airway hyperresponsiveness, and reduced oral steroid doses are reported,
with no reduction in hospital admissions. The mechanism of action is
unlikely to be improved airway contractility alone, and neurohumoral
effects are postulated. A small placebo controlled trial in 32 patients has
shown signiﬁcantly worse initial symptoms and side-effects, but a small
longer-term improvement at 22 and 52 weeks.

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Difﬁcult/refractory asthma
Patients with refractory asthma are a small subgroup of asthma patients
(5–10%). They have difﬁcult to treat disease, reﬂected by high maintenance
medication requirements, or persistent symptoms and air ﬂow obstruction, with multiple exacerbations, despite high medication use. They have
high numbers of admissions, and cause signiﬁcant anxiety to their families
and medical staff. There is a wide range of disease severity, including those
with highly labile disease and those with severe, more chronic air ﬂow
obstruction. No consensus deﬁnition.

The disease is usually ‘deﬁned’ on the basis of:
• Medication requirements (typically continuous or near continuous oral
steroids)
• Asthma symptoms
• Frequency of exacerbations
• Severity of airﬂow limitation
Patients exhibit the features of asthma, and it is thought that the airﬂow
obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and PEF diurnal variability are
more severe in refractory disease, though the physiological reasons for
this remain unclear.
These patients typically fail to completely reverse their airﬂow obstruction following a 2-week course of oral prednisolone and demonstrate a
poor bronchodilator response to inhaled B2 agonists.
The pathological mechanism is likely to be ongoing airway inﬂammation,
with increasing airway ﬁbrosis, but this is not proven. Other possibilities
include steroid resistance (see opposite), B2 receptor down-regulation, or
a different disease process altogether. Whether they represent a different
asthma ‘phenotype’ is unclear.

Diagnosis of refractory asthma
• Conﬁrm the diagnosis is correct—this will mean going back through
the notes and retaking a thorough history
• Conﬁrm reversible airﬂow limitation now or in the past (as for nonrefractory asthma; see p 126)
• Consider other diagnoses for cough, breathlessness, and wheeze, and
investigate for potential exacerbating diseases:
• COPD/smoking
• Bronchiectasis/cystic ﬁbrosis
• Sinus disease—consider ENT review
• Churg–Strauss syndrome/eosinophilic syndromes—consider ANCA
• Systemic disease—thyroid disease or vasculitis
• Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis—consider Aspergillus
precipitins/skin tests/IgE
• Vocal cord dysfunction—consider laryngoscopy
• Hyperventilation syndrome
• Gastro-oesophageal reﬂux—consider OGD/24 h pH
• Upper airway obstruction—consider CT or bronchoscopy
• Obstructive sleep apnoea—consider sleep study
• Obesity
• Cardiac dysfunction—consider echo and/or cardiological opinion

DIFFICULT/REFRACTORY ASTHMA

• Psychiatric/emotional issues/depression/secondary gain—consider
psychiatry or psychology review
• Functional wheeze by breathing near residual volume

Refractory asthma
Before labelling a patient as ‘refractory’, compliance must be conﬁrmed.
This may be by checking pharmacy prescription records, using inhaler
devices monitoring medication usage, or by measurement of plasma prednisolone or early morning cortisol levels.
Treatment is that of non-refractory asthma, with inhaled long-acting B2
agonists and high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (see pp 132–136). Ensure
treatment trials are adequate and adhered to.
• In patients unable to tolerate a prednisolone dose <20 mg per day,
corticosteroid pharmacokinetic studies may be useful. However, <25%
of patients with severe asthma show clinically signiﬁcantly increased
prednisolone clearance (usually a speciﬁc reason can be identiﬁed, such
as concomitant use of enzyme inducing medication). IM steroid, e.g. triamcinolone 120 mg, may be useful if compliance is a major problem.
• Nebulized budesonide (Respules®, 1–2 mg bd) may be of beneﬁt.
• Inﬂammatory markers, e.g. sputum or plasma eosinophil counts
or exhaled nitric oxide levels, may be useful to assess medication
response, although no trials have demonstrated their use clinically in
this group of patients.
• Anti-inﬂammatory and immunomodulating drugs (specialized centre
only). Include methotrexate, cyclosporin, oral gold, and intravenous
gammaglobulin. None of these have been studied in a randomized
controlled trial in this group of patients and none have demonstrated
improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness.
• Macrolide antibiotics have anti-inﬂammatory and immune modulatory
effects, reducing airway reactivity, and eosinophilic inﬂammation, and
have been shown to reduce oral steroid requirements. Persistence of
airway infection by C. pneumoniae and Mycoplasma is increasingly
recognized as a contributory factor in persistent airﬂow obstruction,
and recurrent exacerbations and macrolide antibiotics may act in this
situation to clear persistent infection. Use, e.g. azithromycin, 250 mg, on
alternate days, or 3 times a week, or 500 mg twice weekly. Six-weekly
LFT monitoring is required. Risk of hearing loss.
‘Steroid-resistant’ asthma This subgroup of patients represents a very small
proportion of refractory asthma patients. Middle-aged obese women,
often with other additional diagnoses, are overrepresented in this group.
They require supportive treatment, without high doses of glucocorticoids.
Diagnoses other than asthma are likely and investigation should be
directed towards these. Whether they represent a further ‘asthma phenotype’ is not clear.

Asthma in pregnancy
•
•
•
•
•
•

Pregnancy can affect asthma
Asthma can affect the outcome of pregnancy
Prognosis—1/3 worsen, 1/3 improve, 1/3 no change
Asthma course is likely to be similar in successive pregnancies
Severe asthma is more likely to deteriorate than mild asthma
Most exacerbations occur late, in the second and third trimester, and
are due to viral infections and non-adherence to inhaled corticosteroid

Pre-pregnancy counselling
•
•
•
•

Asthmatics must continue normal asthma medication
Give smoking cessation advice
Monitor the pregnant asthmatic closely
Severe exacerbations in pregnancy are associated with low birth weight
infants, an effect similar to maternal smoking in pregnancy

Acute asthma in pregnancy
• Risk to fetus of uncontrolled asthma outweighs any small risk of drugs
• Asthma medications are generally safe in pregnancy
• Steroids should be continued
• Drug therapy as for non-asthmatics, including inhaled and oral corticosteroids
• Maintain oxygen saturation >95%
• Continuous fetal monitoring for acute severe asthma
• Liaise with obstetrician if acute severe asthma
Leukotriene receptor antagonists
Limited safety data available for use in pregnancy and it is recommended
not to start using whilst pregnant. Continue in women who have previously
demonstrated signiﬁcant improvement in disease control prior to pregnancy.
Management during labour
• Acute asthma is rare in labour (probably due to high sympathetic drive)
• Close liaison between the respiratory and obstetric teams is paramount, with close fetal monitoring
• Management should be as for non-pregnant individuals, see pp 132–136),
maintaining the oxygen saturation >95%. There is no RCT data for
magnesium sulphate, although it is used in eclampsia
• Regional anaesthetic blockade is preferable to general anaesthesia
• Prostaglandin E2 may be safely used for induction of labour
• Prostaglandin F2 alpha (for post-partum bleeding) may cause
bronchospasm
• Give parenteral hydrocortisone 100 mg 6–8-hourly during labour if on
oral prednisolone at >7.5 mg daily for >2 weeks prior to delivery

ASTHMA IN PREGNANCY

Breast-feeding
• An asthmatic mother may reduce the chance of atopy in her child by
breast-feeding; current opinion is divided
• Prednisolone is secreted in breast milk, but the infant is exposed to
only tiny and clinically irrelevant doses.

142

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Occupational asthma
• This is asthma due to speciﬁc workplace sensitizers and may account
for 10% of adult onset asthma
• The diagnosis is often difﬁcult to make
• Early diagnosis is important, as earlier removal from the workplace in
affected individuals leads to a better outcome
• It is different to asthma exacerbated by irritants in the workplace, and
can occur in individuals with or without prior asthma.
• Agents induce asthma through immunological and non-immunological
mechanisms. Immunological disease appears after a latency period of
exposure; thus it is necessary for the worker to be sensitized to the
casual agent (e.g. acid anhydride—baker's asthma). Non-immunological
disease is characterized by the absence of a latent period and occurs
after accidental exposure to high concentrations of a workplace irritant. This is irritant induced asthma (previously named reactive airways
dysfunction syndrome), usually caused by exposure to, e.g. smoke,
vapours, or fumes, with a strong temporal relationship between irritant
exposure and the development of asthma type symptoms.
• The latency between ﬁrst exposure and symptom onset can be long,
and depends on the sensitizing agent—an accurate history therefore
includes current and past exposures
• Once sensitized, re-exposure to very low concentrations can provoke
symptoms
• May be associated with rhinitis and urticaria
• Improves away from work, but can take several days to settle.

Risk factors
• Atopy
• HLA type (e.g. HLA-DQB1*0503 associated with isocyanate allergy)
• Smoking (especially for high molecular weight agents).

Diagnosis
• Conﬁrm the diagnosis of asthma
• Conﬁrm the relationship between asthma and work exposures
• Find the speciﬁc cause
There are two useful screening questions:
• Is your asthma worse when at work?
• Does your asthma improve when away from work or on holiday?
Document lung function deterioration in the workplace, usually by
serial peak ﬂow recording at work, at home, and on holiday.
Bronchial provocation/challenge testing using suspected agent—only in
specialized centres, but difﬁculties with testing and producing a valid test
substance mean that a negative speciﬁc bronchial challenge in a worker
with otherwise good evidence of occupational asthma is not sufﬁcient to
exclude the diagnosis.
Skin prick testing/speciﬁc IgE for certain sensitizers (although a positive
test only indicates sensitization which can occur with or without disease).

Management of occupational asthma
Identify the cause
Remove the worker from exposure
Continue employment if at all possible
Early diagnosis and removal from exposure are important factors for a
good outcome
• Improvement in FEV1 may be maintained for one year following last
exposure, and for up to 2 years for non-speciﬁc responsiveness
• The decision to remove the patient from the workplace should not be
taken lightly, and should be made by a consultant with experience of
occupational lung disease.
• The employee may be eligible for Disablement Beneﬁt (no proof of
negligence is required).
•

•
•

Latex allergy is seen in up to 18% of health care workers, and is the
leading cause of occupational asthma in this group due to the widespread
use of latex gloves. It is potentially serious, with avocado, bananas, kiwi,
and chestnuts cross-reacting to give a similar clinical picture. Treatment
is absolute avoidance; those affected should wear a MedicAlert bracelet
and always use non-latex gloves.

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Vocal cord dysfunction
A proportion of patients labelled as having severe asthma, will have symptoms originating from the upper airway. This can be due to vocal cord
dysfunction (VCD) and/or so-called ‘upper airway hyperresponsiveness’;
these are different, but overlap. VCD is likely to arise from interrelationships between laryngeal hyperresponsiveness and autonomic imbalance,
with inputs from potential aetiological/aggravating factors, such as reﬂux,
psychological stress, hypocapnia (hyperventilation). Increased laryngeal
hyperresponsiveness can occur following respiratory tract infections and
possibly asthma itself. Upper airway hyperresponsiveness may include
more than just the larynx, but this is not clear.
Patients will typically present with asthma symptoms, with associated
triggers, e.g. odours, cold air. They typically have no reduction in peak ﬂow
or response to asthma medications (though this is possible).
A careful history will reveal shortness of breath that is of short duration,
worse on inspiration, and extremely sudden in onset, with symptom-free
periods.

Pathogenesis

•
•

Recent URTI, may take months to settle
Post-nasal drip/chronic sinusitis
Gastro-oesophageal reﬂux disease with micro aspiration
Chronic laryngitis
Hyperventilation in association with anxiety/panic
It is postulated that the origin of the vocal cord closure may stem from
a reﬂex airway protective mechanism.

Diagnosis is based on excluding other causes of cough and breathlessness. It may be suggested by hearing a more stridulous noise and lack of
basal wheeze. The gold standard is visualization of abnormal vocal cord
movement at laryngoscopy, where there is excessive adduction of the
anterior two-thirds of cords with the creation of a posterior ‘glottic chink’;
although this ﬁnding may not always be present at the time of study. The
ﬂow volume loop should show inspiratory ﬂow limitation, with ‘stuttering’
of the ﬂow.

Treatment (for which there are no randomized controlled trials)

CHAPTER 18

Asthma

Allergic rhinitis (hay fever)
This is the syndrome of nasal discharge or blockage with nasal and/or eye
itching, and sneezing. It is often associated with post-nasal drip, cough, fatigue,
and with signiﬁcant morbidity. Allergic rhinitis is deﬁned as perennial if the
symptoms occur year round and seasonal if occurring at a particular time of
year. The prevalence is increasing and affects up to 15% of the UK population.
Up to 30% of patients with persistent allergic rhinitis have asthma.

Aetiology The lining of the nose is in continuum with the lower respiratory tract, and inﬂammation of the upper and lower airways often coexists. Common aeroallergens provoking seasonal allergic rhinitis are tree
pollen in the spring, and grass pollen in the summer months. Perennial
rhinitis usually reﬂects allergy to indoor allergens, such as house dust mite
(the provoking allergen is a digestive enzyme that is shed in the faeces), cat
salivary protein, cockroaches, or animal dander.

Pathophysiology Symptoms occur following the inhalation of allergen
to which the subject is sensitized, and against which they have IgE antibodies. These antibodies bind to mast cell IgE receptors, with the release
of mediators, including tryptase and histamine, causing symptoms immediately after exposure.

Diagnosis is usually made from the history, which should identify the
triggers to the disease. The main differential diagnosis is with sinusitis
due to bacterial infection and upper airway involvement due to vasculitis.
Asthma is common in association with rhinitis and treatment of rhinosinusitis in association with asthma leads to improved asthma control.
Up to 50% of asthma patients will have allergic rhinitis.

Treatment
• Allergen avoidance This may be easier said than done. It can take up to
20 weeks to remove cat allergen from a house. Keeping car and house
windows shut and wearing sunglasses may help avoid pollen. Pollen
counts are highest in the afternoon and early evening
• Non-sedating antihistamines, improve sneezing and itching, but have no
effect on nasal blockage
• Topical intranasal steroid, e.g. budesonide triamcinolone
• Topical anticholinergics, e.g. ipratropium, may be useful for rhinorrhea,
if uncontrolled with topical nasal steroids
• Topical sodium cromoglycate may be beneﬁcial, particularly for allergic
conjunctivitis
• Decongestants, e.g. oxymetazoline, may help, but rebound nasal
blockage and tachyphylaxis are a potential problem if used regularly.
• Leukotrene receptor antagonists (e.g. montelukast) may be beneﬁcial.

CHAPTER 19

Bronchiectasis

Epidemiology, pathophysiology,
and causes
Deﬁnition Irreversible abnormal dilatation of one or more bronchi,
with chronic airway inﬂammation. Associated chronic sputum production,
recurrent chest infections, and airﬂow obstruction.
Epidemiology The prevalence of bronchiectasis is unknown, but is
probably falling due to vaccinations and the improved and earlier treatment of childhood infections. However, the advent of HRCT scanning
may now lead to the diagnosis of more subtle (and possibly subclinical)
disease.
Pathophysiology An initial (usually infectious) insult is needed to
damage the airways. Disordered anatomy leads to secondary bacterial
colonization, perpetuating inﬂammatory change and damaging the mucociliary escalator. This prevents bacterial clearance and leads to further
airway damage. Major airways and bronchioles are involved, with mucosal
oedema, inﬂammation, and ulceration. Terminal bronchioles become
obstructed with secretions, leading to volume loss. A chronic host inﬂammatory response ensues, with free-radical formation and the production
of neutrophil elastase, further contributing to the inﬂammatory process.
Bronchial neovascularization occurs with hypertrophy and tortuosity of
the bronchial arteries (which are at systemic pressure), which may lead to
intermittent haemoptyses.
Aetiology The causes of bronchiectasis are many and varied (see
Table 19.1). In general, the aetiology is either a one-off infectious insult, or
an underlying immune deﬁciency. Determining the aetiology of the condition may lead to different management if, for example, the underlying
cause is found to be cystic ﬁbrosis or an immune deﬁciency. The cause is
idiopathic in around 50% of cases and these are likely to be due to an (as
yet unidentiﬁed) impairment in host defence.
The most important cause to exclude is cystic ﬁbrosis (see p 205). Even
relatively mild bronchiectasis diagnosed in middle age can be due to CF.
The diagnosis can alter management, with:
• Involvement of the multidisciplinary CF team
• Attention to other potential problems, e.g. gastrointestinal disease,
sinus disease, diabetes
• Inheritance (relevant to the rest of the family)
• Fertility issues.
Consider genotyping for CF if:
• Predominantly upper lobe disease
• Haemophilus inﬂuenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization
• Malnutrition ± malabsorption, diabetes
• Family history of cystic ﬁbrosis or bronchiectasis
• Associated subfertility or infertility.
A normal chloride sweat test does not exclude CF, as some mutations are
associated with normal sweat chloride levels. The test is also difﬁcult and
subject to a number of technical errors. Only 90% of CF sufferers have a
recognizable gene defect (there are over 1000 CFTR mutations).

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease (see p 248)
Chronic sinusitis

CHAPTER 19

Bronchiectasis

Clinical features and diagnosis
Suspect bronchiectasis in a patient with recurrent episodes of ‘bronchitis’
over several years prior to presentation.

The clinical picture is one of:
• Symptoms
• Cough
• Chronic sputum production (typically tenacious, purulent, and
daily)
• Intermittent haemoptyses
• Breathlessness
• Intermittent pleuritic pain (usually in association with infections)
• Lethargy/malaise.
• Signs
• Coarse inspiratory and expiratory crackles on auscultation
• Airﬂow obstruction with wheeze.

Diagnosis is usually made clinically, with high resolution CT chest for
conﬁrmation.

Investigations are aimed at:
• Conﬁrming the diagnosis
• Identifying a treatable underlying cause for the bronchiectasis (possible
in about 40%)
• Optimizing management to prevent exacerbations and further lung
damage

Essential investigations
• CXR sensitivity is only 50%, classically shows ‘ring shadows’ and
‘tramlines’—indicating thickened airways, and the ‘gloved ﬁnger’
appearance. consolidation around thickened and dilated airways
• HRCT chest is 97% sensitive in detecting disease. Expiratory scans
may be useful to demonstrate post-obstructive air trapping, indicative
of small airways disease. Typically shows airway dilatation to the lung
periphery, bronchial wall thickening, and the airway appearing larger
than its accompanying vessel (signet ring sign). If the bronchiectasis is
localized to a single lobe, CT is useful to determine whether a central
obstructing lesion is present. Contiguous 3-mm slices are needed
to exclude a central airway lesion if there is associated haemoptysis.
Symptoms correlate with wall thickening and mucous plugging on
CT scan. Traction bronchiectasis seen in UIP is airway dilatation
secondary to airway distortion, seen with chronic severe interstitial
ﬁbrosis
• Sputum microbiology Standard M, C & S (including for atypical
organisms), acid-fast bacilli, and Aspergillus
• Pulmonary function tests with reversibility testing
• Immunoglobulins A, M, E, G (including IgG subclasses, if total IgG is low)
• Aspergillus precipitins See p 467.

CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS

Second-line investigations
• CF genotyping (see p 206)
• Autoantibodies (ANA, RhF, dsDNA) if associated arthritis/connective
tissue disease
• Vaccination response to tetanus, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, and pneumococcal antibodies, if underlying immunosuppression suspected
• Skin tests/RAST to identify speciﬁc sensitizers (usually Aspergillus)
• Detailed immunological investigation (including neutrophil and
lymphocyte function studies)
• Bronchoscopy to exclude a foreign body if suggested by CT; obtain
microbiological samples if unusual clinical presentation, or failure to
respond to standard antibiotics
• Nasal brushings/biopsy (in tertiary centre) to assess ciliary beat
frequency with video microscopy
• Saccharin test The time for saccharin to be tasted in the mouth after
deposition of a 0.5-mm particle on the inferior turbinate of the nose.
Normal is less than 30 min. A poor man’s cilial function test
• A1-antitrypsin levels if deﬁciency is suspected
• Barium swallow/oesophageal imaging if recurrent aspiration
suspected.

CHAPTER 19

Bronchiectasis

General management
The main aims of management are:
• Treatment of any underlying medical condition
• Prevention of exacerbations and progression of underlying disease by
physiotherapy. The options for airway clearance include:
• Postural or autogenic drainage
• Active cycle of breathing technique—this involves breathing control
with forced expiration (hufﬁng) using variable thoracic expansion
• Cough augmentation—using ﬂutter valves/cough insufﬂator/
high-frequency oscillation
• Exercise regimes—important to prevent general deconditioning
• The physiotherapist is also vital during admission for exacerbations
to help clear tenacious sputum
• Nebulized hypertonic saline may improve airway clearance, although
there is no RCT data to support its use
• Reduction of bacterial load and prevention of secondary airway
inﬂammation and damage, with antimicrobial chemotherapy
• Supportive treatment—treatment of associated airﬂow obstruction
• Optimize nutrition
• Refer for surgery if necessary—localized resection of affected area
• Refer for transplantation if indicated.

Antimicrobial chemotherapy
• This may be intermittent for exacerbations only (for mild disease) or
long term for more severe disease. Antibiotics may be oral, nebulized,
or intravenous
• Regular sputum surveillance will ensure the likely colonizing organism
is known
• In vivo sensitivity may be different to in vitro sensitivity
• Patients need a higher antibiotic dose and for a longer time period
(usually 2 weeks minimum) than people without bronchiectasis
• Antibiotic treatment choice depends on the severity of the underlying
disease
• Treatment response is usually assessed by a fall in sputum volume, and
change to mucoid from purulent or mucopurulent sputum, with an
improvement in systemic symptoms, spirometry, and CRP
• Pseudomonas-colonized patients have more frequent exacerbations,
worse CT scan appearances, and a faster decline in lung function.

Progressive bacterial colonization Different bacteria colonize the
airways at different stages of the disease, and their attempted eradication and suppression is vital to the treatment of bronchiectasis. The usual
order of colonization is:
• Staphylococcus aureus
• Haemophilus inﬂuenzae
• Moraxella catarrhalis
• Pseudomonas species.

GENERAL MANAGEMENT

Exacerbation treatment An exacerbation is usually a clinical diagnosis, with an increase in sputum volume and tenacity, with discoloration.
It may be associated with chest pain, haemoptysis and wheeze, and systemic upset—fevers, lethargy, and anorexia. The CRP may be elevated.
Treatment depends on the potential pathogens and resident ﬂora.
Nebulized bronchodilators and regular physiotherapy (as an in- or outpatient) may also be needed.
Exacerbation of mild bronchiectasis
• Antibiotics for exacerbations only (tailored to the colonizing organism)
• 2-week course of oral ciproﬂoxacin at 750 mg bd if Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized
• If early relapse, with a return to purulent sputum within 6–8 weeks,
consider long-term oral antibiotics, e.g. amoxicillin 500 mg bd or
doxycycline 100 mg od. If treatment failure, change to appropriate
intravenous antibiotics, until clinical improvement.
Exacerbation of more severe bronchiectasis
Chronic suppressive antibiotics aim to prevent progression of disease,
by reducing bacterial load and preventing ongoing inﬂammation, thereby
reducing morbidity and improving quality of life.
• Antibiotics are usually given for at least 2 days after the sputum has
cleared—often for 2 weeks
• If oral antibiotics fail, intravenous treatment is required. This may mean
in-patient admission, or could involve long-line insertion, patient education in self-administration of intravenous antibiotics, and involvement of
a home care team.
First isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (see also p 211)
• Initial treatment is often aggressive with a 4–6 week course of oral
ciproﬂoxacin 500–750 mg bd, and concurrent nebulized aminoglycoside,
such as colistin 1–2 mega units bd
• If this fails and the patient still has Pseudomonas on sputum culture,
intravenous antibiotics, usually an aminoglycoside and anti-pseudomonal
penicillin (minimum 2 weeks), is required
• Consider long-term therapy with regular nebulized aminoglycoside to
reduce levels of Pseudomonas and reduce subsequent exacerbations
and airway inﬂammation.
Macrolide antibiotics have both anti-bacterial and immunomodulatory
properties and have greater immunosuppressive effects than corticosteroids. They decrease mucous production, alter inﬂammatory mediator
release, and inhibit Pseudomonas virulence factors and bioﬁlm formation.
Five small trials have reported beneﬁcial effects of macrolides in bronchiectasis, with reduced sputum volume, improved lung function, and
symptoms. The drugs are well tolerated, though concerns have been
raised about non-tuberculous mycobacterial resistance with long-term
use. Azithromycin 250 mg on alternate days or 3 times weekly, or 500 mg
twice weekly (with LFT monitoring) are possible regimes. Risk of hearing
loss. See p 162 (bronchiolitis).

155

156

CHAPTER 19

Bronchiectasis

Further management
• Self-management plan—patients need an individual plan for
exacerbations, which usually involves having a supply of home
antibiotics
• Treatment of associated airﬂow obstruction/wheeze with inhaled
steroids and/or bronchodilators
• There is no speciﬁc treatment for abnormalities of mucociliary
function, although B2 agonists may enhance airway clearance
• Nebulized DNase (Dornase alpha)—no evidence for the use of this in
non-CF bronchiectasis, but it may be useful in severe exacerbations
if the sputum is very tenacious and expectoration is difﬁcult
• Nebulized hypertonic saline (7%) may aid sputum clearance
• N-acetylcysteine
• Annual inﬂuenza and pneumococcal vaccinations
• Osteoporosis prophylaxis (if on long-term steroids)
• Reﬂux treatment if aspiration
• Immunoglobulin replacement therapy Patients found to have
immunoglobulin deﬁciency should be referred to an immunologist for
further assessment. Intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy
is usually given once or twice monthly, as a day case
• Surgery This is the only potential curative treatment, with resection of
a single chronically infected lobe occasionally being of beneﬁt. It is less
commonly needed now, as the incidence of single-lobe disease related
to previous severe childhood pneumonia is falling. Surgery may be
indicated for life-threatening haemoptysis
• Transplant is most commonly performed for CF bronchiectasis, but
referral may be warranted for severe non-CF-related disease.

Complications of bronchiectasis
• Infective exacerbation
• Haemoptysis—small volume haemoptysis (increasing during exacerbations) is common
• Massive haemoptysis (usually from tortuous bronchial arteries around
damaged lung, e.g. bulla) is a life-threatening emergency (see p 40)
• Pneumothorax
• Respiratory failure
• Brain abscess (now very rare)
• Amyloidosis.

FURTHER MANAGEMENT

Bronchiectasis and Aspergillus
• Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)—excessive immune
response to environmental fungus Aspergillus (most commonly
Fumigatus species); may be the cause of bronchiectasis (suspect
particularly if upper lobe disease), as mucus plugs become impacted in
distal airways, causing airway damage and subsequent dilatation.
See p 468
• Aspergilloma—Aspergillus may colonize damaged airways with formation
of a fungus ball (mycetoma) within a previously formed cavity. This is
extremely difﬁcult to treat. Most commonly it causes systemic upset
and haemoptysis. See p 474.

CHAPTER 20

Bronchiolitis

Pathophysiology and causes
Deﬁnition and epidemiology Bronchioles are small airways of
diameter <2 mm, lined by bronchial epithelium and with no cartilage in
their walls. Terminal bronchioles lead to alveoli. Many bronchioles need
to be affected by disease before a patient becomes symptomatic, when
there will be increased airway resistance unresponsive to B2 stimulants.
Bronchiolitis is poorly understood and is a mixture of conditions.
Disease seems to affect bronchioles in two main ways:
• Affecting the bronchioles in isolation, with non-speciﬁc injury causing
subsequent epithelial damage and inﬂammation, e.g. viral bronchiolitis
• As a bronchiolitis associated with other airway disease, where the
bronchiolitis may be more of an incidental ﬁnding along with other
pathologies, e.g. COP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, RB-ILD, Langerhans
cell histiocytosis

Pathophysiology is unclear. There is probably an initial injury to the
epithelium of the bronchioles with subsequent inﬂammation. Adjacent
alveoli are often also involved. There are two main pathological patterns
of bronchiolitis. Both can exist in the same patient.
• Proliferative bronchiolitis More common of the two patterns.
Non-speciﬁc reaction to bronchiolar injury, with organizing exudate
within the bronchiolar lumen. Proliferation of intraluminal ﬁbrotic buds,
called Masson bodies, seen in bronchioles, alveoli, and alveolar ducts.
Associated alveolar wall inﬂammation and foamy macrophages in alveolar
spaces. May completely or partially resolve. Tends to be more responsive
to steroids. The pathology merges with that of COP (see p 270)
• Constrictive bronchiolitis Less common. Concentric narrowing of the
bronchiolar wall due to cellular inﬁltrates 9 smooth muscle hyperplasia,
which may cause extrinsic compression, obliteration, distortion, mucus
collection, peribronchiolar ﬁbrosis, and scarring. Patchy in distribution.
Typically progressive and unresponsive to steroid therapy. Usually leads
to respiratory failure and death.
In practice, these are the commonest situations in which a diagnosis of
bronchiolitis is useful:
• Viral bronchiolitis (RSV)
• Post-lung transplant (obliterative bronchiolitis)
• Post-bone marrow transplant
• Connective tissue disease (usually rheumatoid arthritis)
• In association with interstitial lung disease and airways disease
• Diffuse panbronchiolitis (including Japanese panbronchiolitis).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CAUSES

Causes of bronchiolitis
Proliferative bronchiolitis (associated with organizing pneumonia)
Commoner causes
• COP (see p 270)
• Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (see p 249)
• Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (see p 232)
• Connective tissue disease—rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis,
dermatomyositis (see p 185)
• Post bone marrow, heart, and lung transplant
• Organizing acute infection—mycoplasma, Legionella, inﬂuenza, CMV,
HIV, PCP.
Rarer causes
• ARDS (see p 101)
• Vasculitides, including Wegener’s granulomatosis (see p 649)
• Drug-induced reactions, such as L-tryptophan, busulfan, cocaine
• Chronic thyroiditis
• Ulcerative colitis
• Radiation or aspiration pneumonitis
• Distal to bronchial obstruction
• Common variable immunodeﬁciency syndrome.
Constrictive bronchiolitis
Commoner causes
• Connective tissue disease, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, especially
women in their 50s and 60s, with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis
May be related to penicillamine therapy
• Infection—viral (adenovirus, RSV, inﬂuenza, para-inﬂuenza),
mycoplasma.
Rarer causes
• ‘Chronic rejection phenomenon’ in heart, lung, bone marrow
transplants—affects up to 65% of lung transplant patients after 5 years
post-transplant and is the primary cause of late death, bronchiolitis
obliterans syndrome (see p 328). Patients taking statins posttransplant have a lower incidence of this; reasons unclear
• Diffuse panbronchiolitis (including Japanese panbronchiolitis).
• Following inhalation injury: mineral dusts, such as asbestos, silica, iron
oxide, aluminium oxide, talc, mica, coal, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen
oxide, ammonia, chlorine, phosgene—may develop cough days to
weeks after exposure
• Drug reaction
• Hypersensitivity reactions
• Ulcerative colitis
• Cryptogenic. Rare, mostly women >40. Cough and dyspnoea. PFT:
progressive airﬂow obstruction and air trapping. KCO decreased, no
bronchodilator response.

161

162

CHAPTER 20

Bronchiolitis

Management
Clinical features Insidious onset of cough and dyspnoea over weeks to
months. There may be an associated medical history, such as a transplant,
connective tissue disease, or vasculitis, or a history of mineral dust or drug
exposure. Possible history of recent viral illness.
Investigations
• PFTs Obstructive defect may be found, with no bronchodilator
reversibility, particularly in constrictive bronchiolitis. Proliferative
bronchiolitis can cause a restrictive or mixed defect
• CXR can be normal or may show hyperinﬂation, especially with constrictive bronchiolitis, diffuse inﬁltrates with proliferative bronchiolitis,
which may be migratory
• HRCT is helpful and may be performed prone in full expiration. (Prone
CT is used to minimize any gravity-dependent changes.) Normal
bronchioles are too small to be seen; indirect signs of disease may be
hyperinﬂation, air trapping, causing a mosaic pattern and subsegmental
atelectasis. Bronchioles with thickened walls due to inﬂammation
and dilatation may be seen. CT is also useful to assess for signs of
associated interstitial lung disease
• Open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy may be required to make the
diagnosis, as transbronchial biopsies are usually inadequate. The small
airways need particularly carefully examination.

Management
• Treat any underlying disorder
• Cough suppressants
• Long-term macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin 200–600 mg/day
may improve symptoms, lung function, and mortality, especially in those
with diffuse panbronchiolitis and cryptogenic bronchiolitis. Erythromycin
lowers the neutrophil count by an unknown mechanism and reduces
the number of lymphocytes
• Steroids are effective in cases of proliferative bronchiolitis and can
treat the associated organizing pneumonia. They may also be beneﬁcial
in bronchiolitis due to inhalation injury, both in early and later stages.
Relapses of the bronchiolitis may occur on stopping the steroids.

Bronchiolitis: speciﬁc conditions
Diffuse panbronchiolitis/Japanese panbronchiolitis This is a distinct condition and used to be thought of as rare outside Japan. Described 30 years
ago in Japan, it is recognized there as a condition involving both the upper
and lower respiratory tracts, with bronchiolar inﬂammation and chronic
sinusitis. An infectious aetiology was postulated as the cause of this disease,
but no particular organism has been consistently found. It can be familial
and is associated with HLA-B54 (speciﬁc to East Asians) and A11. More
prevalent in men, mean age at presentation 45, occurs particularly in nonsmokers, and chronic sinusitis can precede the chest symptoms often by
years. More recently, a very similar clinical condition has been increasingly
described outside Japan and where sinusitis is less commonly found. This
diffuse version is also an idiopathic inﬂammatory and suppurative disorder

MANAGEMENT

of the respiratory bronchioles causing progressive and severe airways
obstruction. It is presumably very similar to the Japanese variety and probably under-recognized. Most of these patients have a productive cough with
purulent sputum, exertional dyspnoea, wheeze, and weight loss. There may
be signs of progressive respiratory failure and cor pulmonale with crackles
and wheezes on auscultation.
• PFTs are obstructive, although may show a mixed pattern, with minimal
airway hyperresponsiveness. kCO is reduced
• CXR and CT may show diffuse ill-deﬁned nodules (sometimes ‘treein-bud’), bronchiectasis, and air trapping
• Sputum cultures may repeatedly show growths of Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and less commonly Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Staphylococcus aureus. These
should be treated, but can be hard to eradicate
• Cold agglutinins may be positive, mycoplasma tests are negative
• BAL shows marked neutrophilia
• Open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy, although this may not be considered necessary in areas where panbronchiolitis is prevalent. Bronchiolar
histology is characteristic, although not pathognomonic, with transmural
inﬁltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and foamy macrophages. The
intraluminal exudates may be organized to form a polypoid plug.
Treatment with low-dose erythromycin 400–600 mg/day for 2–6 months,
and in some Japanese studies over 2 years, confers a signiﬁcant survival
beneﬁt, most likely related to its anti-inﬂammatory and immunomodulatory effects (inhibits many cytokines), as well as reducing mucin secretion,
rather than through its antibacterial effects. Untreated, 50% 5-year mortality. Azithromycin 250 mg three times a week may be a suitable alternative. Relapses occur, but usually respond to macrolides again.
Acute bronchiolitis This is a seasonal epidemic infective illness, common
in infants <1 year, who present with coryza, low grade fever, cough,
wheezing, tachypnoea, respiratory distress, hyperinﬂation, and tachycardia.
It is most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but also
adenovirus, inﬂuenza, para-inﬂuenza, rhinovirus, human metapneumo
virus, mycoplasma, and Chlamydia. In adults, acute bronchiolitis is caused
by the same organisms, but is less severe.
• CXR may be normal or show hyperinﬂation, occasionally with patchy
opacities, consolidation, and collapse
• Histologically there is acute and chronic inﬂammation of bronchioles,
with necrosis, sloughing, oedema, and inﬂammatory exudates in the
bronchiolar lumen.
Treatment is supportive, with oxygen, ﬂuids. Steroids and bronchodilators
may be given if severe, but systematic reviews in children show no signiﬁcant outcome beneﬁt.

CHAPTER 21

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Deﬁnition, aetiology, pathology, and
clinical features
COPD is common and is mostly due to smoking. Patients with COPD
represent a large proportion of in-patient (approximately 12% of all
general medical admissions) and out-patient work for the chest physician.

Deﬁnition
•
•
•
•

Fixed airﬂow obstruction
Minimal or no reversibility with bronchodilators
Minimal variability in day-to-day symptoms
Slowly progressive and irreversible deterioration in lung function,
leading to progressively worsening symptoms.

Aetiology 95% of cases are smoking-related, typically >20 pack years.
COPD occurs in 10–20% of smokers, indicating that there is probable
genetic susceptibility. COPD is increasing in frequency worldwide, particularly in some developing countries, due to high levels of smoking. It can
also be caused by environmental and occupational factors such as dusts,
chemicals, and air pollution.
Pathology
• Mucous gland hyperplasia particularly in the large airways, with
mucous hypersecretion and therefore a chronic productive cough.
Other mucosal damage from smoke:
• Squamous metaplasia Replacement of the normal ciliated columnar
epithelium by a squamous epithelium
• Loss of cilial function This leads to impairment of the normal functioning of the mucociliary escalator, another reason for the chronic
productive cough
• Chronic inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis of small airways, characterized by
CD8 lymphocyte, macrophage, and neutrophil inﬁltration, with release
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines. Recurrent infections may perpetuate
airway inﬂammation
• Emphysema due to alveolar wall destruction causing irreversible
enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchiole (the acinus),
with subsequent loss of elastic recoil and hyperinﬂated lungs
• Panacinar emphysema can occur with dilated air spaces evenly
distributed across acinii
• Centriacinar or proximal emphysema can occur with dilated air
spaces found in association with the respiratory bronchioles
• Periacinar or paraseptal emphysema can occur with dilated air
spaces at the edge of the acinar unit and abutting a ﬁxed structure,
such as the pleura or a vessel
• Thickened pulmonary arteriolar wall and remodelling occur with
hypoxia. Leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary
hypertension, and impaired gas exchange.
The cause of the increase in airways resistance and hence expiratory ﬂow
limitation is multifactorial. Small airway inﬂammation reduces the airway
lumen. Emphysema destroys the radial attachments to the small airways,
which normally hold them open and resist dynamic compression.

DEFINITION, AETIOLOGY, PATHOLOGY, AND CLINICAL FEATURES

COPD is increasingly being recognized as having features not only of
pulmonary, but also systemic inﬂammation and this may be the cause of
the comorbidities found in patients with COPD. Daily activities are often
modiﬁed to avoid dyspnoea, which can lead to deconditioning, muscle
weakness, and wasting, meaning standing and walking become even harder.
This leads to a vicious cycle of inactivity.

CHAPTER 21

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Investigations
Pulmonary function tests
• Obstructive spirometry and ﬂow-volume loops
• Reduced FEV1 to <80% predicted (FEV1 is the measurement of choice
to assess progression of COPD, but it correlates weakly with the
degree of dyspnoea. Changes in FEV1 do not reﬂect the decline in a
patient’s health)
• FEV1/FVC <0.7
• Minimal bronchodilator reversibility (<15%, usually <10%) and minimal
steroid reversibility (how to perform these, see p 175). It is not necessary to test these in most patients, but is useful if there is diagnostic
uncertainty or if the patient is thought to have both COPD and asthma
• Raised total lung volume, FRC, and residual volume because of emphysema, air trapping, and loss of elastic recoil
• Decreased TLCO and kCO because presence of emphysema decreases
surface area available for gas diffusion.
CXR is not required for diagnosis and repeated CXR is unnecessary unless
other diagnoses are being considered (most importantly lung cancer or
bronchiectasis).
• Hyperinﬂated lung ﬁelds with attenuation of peripheral vasculature—
‘black lung sign’. More than 7 posterior ribs seen
• Flattened diaphragms (best CXR correlate of post-mortem degree of
emphysema)
• More horizontal ribs
• May see bullae, especially in the lung apices, which if large can be mistaken for a pneumothorax due to the loss of lung markings (CT can
differentiate).
Consider checking α1-antitrypsin levels (see p 182), FBC to ensure not
anaemic, TFT if unduly breathless. CRP is slightly increased in COPD,
but decreases after steroid treatment. It may be related to the presence
of comorbidities and may aid the assessment of the systemic effects of
COPD, particularly in the research setting.

Diagnosis is based on the history of smoking and progressive dyspnoea,
with evidence of irreversible airﬂow obstruction on spirometry. Asthma
is the most important differential diagnosis. Asthma is steroid and bronchodilator responsive. Nearly all patients with COPD will have a smoking
history; this is not universal in asthma. Symptoms are common under the
age of 35 in asthma; rare in COPD. Chronic productive cough is common
is COPD and uncommon in asthma. Breathlessness is progressive and
persistent in COPD, but variable in asthma. In asthma there is signiﬁcant
diurnal or day-to-day variability of symptoms, and night-time waking with
SOB or wheeze are common; these symptoms are uncommon in COPD.
Some patients have both.

This is a simple multidimensional grading system for COPD, using BMI,

variables. It has been shown to be better than FEV1 at predicting risk of
hospitalization and death in patients with COPD. Patients are scored as
having a BODE index of between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating a
higher risk of death. It is being widely used, particularly in research studies
(Celli BR et al. NEJM 2004; 350: 1005–12).

CHAPTER 21

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Non-pharmacological management of
stable COPD
Aims of COPD management should include:
• Ensuring the diagnosis is correct
• Stopping smoking
• Optimizing treatment by minimizing symptoms where possible
• Helping the patient maintain their quality of life.
Management should be delivered by a multi-disciplinary team.
No treatment has yet been shown to modify disease progression in the
long term, except for stopping smoking.

Smoking cessation is the only intervention that is proven to decrease
the smoking-related decline in lung function. All patients with COPD who
smoke should be encouraged to stop at every opportunity. Figure 21.1
shows the accelerated decline in FEV1 in susceptible smokers and the
delay in this acceleration from stopping smoking; susceptible smokers,
however, never regain the original curve. Nicotine replacement therapy
should be used to aid smoking cessation (see p 730).

Education can improve ability to manage illness and stop smoking.
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary programme, with RCT
evidence that it improves exercise tolerance, quality of life, and reduces
hospital admissions. Muscle mass, particularly in the lower limbs, is reduced
in people with COPD compared with age-matched healthy controls. This
is an independent predictor of mortality and disability, independent of the
severity of the underlying lung disease and may reﬂect the systemic nature
of COPD. The mainstay of rehabilitation is graded exercise to improve
muscle function, but also includes breathing techniques and education.

NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF STABLE COPD

Programmes vary, but are usually run on an out-patient basis over several
weeks, with multidisciplinary involvement (see p 723). Should be made
available to all appropriate patients with COPD.

Diet Weight loss is recommended if the patient is obese, to minimize
respiratory effort. If the patient is very breathless, caloriﬁc intake may be
low and a catabolic state may exist. A low BMI is associated with impaired
pulmonary status, decreased diaphragm mass, lower exercise capacity
and increased mortality rate compared with people with a normal BMI.
Nutritional supplementation may therefore be necessary. Maintaining
body weight and muscle mass correlates well with survival.
Psychosocial support Practical support at home, day centres; car disability badge; assess for signs of anxiety and depression.

CHAPTER 21

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Pharmacological management
of stable COPD
Pharmacological management aims to relieve symptoms and reduce exacerbations, but will not modify disease. Increase treatment in a stepwise
fashion. Exacerbations require additional therapeutic support (see p 176).

Bronchodilators Simple pulmonary function testing may not show signiﬁcant bronchodilator reversibility of FEV1, but bronchodilators provide
therapeutic beneﬁt in the long term by reducing dyspnoea, perhaps by
decreasing chest hyperinﬂation.
• Initially prescribe short-acting β2-agonists as required for symptom relief
• If the patient remains symptomatic, prescribe short-acting β2-agonist
with short acting anti-cholinergic
• If symptoms persists, try therapeutic trial of regular long-acting bronchodilator, with or without an anti-cholinergic. Stop if no beneﬁt
(expensive). Continue if the patient has 2 or more exacerbations per
year, as there is evidence for a reduction in exacerbation frequency and
hence decreased health resource utilization
• Oral methylxanthines, such as theophyllines, can be used as a maintenance therapy and may improve symptoms. Add after inhaled bronchodilators and trial of inhaled steroids; continue only if symptoms
improve. Their method of action is unclear, but they may have an
anti-inﬂammatory effect. Take care regarding therapeutic/toxic levels,
especially in elderly patients
• Inhaler therapy provides adequate bronchodilator doses for most
patients, especially when used with a spacer device. It is important to
check the patient’s inhaler technique
• Nebulizer therapy is indicated if the patient is unable to use inhalers, or
if they are disabled or distressed with breathlessness despite maximal
inhaler therapy. Only those with a clear response, with reduction in
symptoms or improvement in activities of daily living, should continue
with long-term domiciliary nebulized treatment (usually with salbutamol and ipratropium), as there is a signiﬁcant placebo effect.

Inhaled steroids should be prescribed to all patients with an FEV1 ≤60%
predicted, who have had 2 or more exacerbations per year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids. Clinical trials of inhaled steroids
have shown a reduction in exacerbation frequency and severity in severe
COPD, but no slowing in the decline in lung function. Warn patients
regarding steroid side-effects and document. Use in combination with
bronchodilator.

Oral steroids are not recommended as a maintenance therapy in COPD.
It may, however, be difﬁcult to withdraw them in patients with severe
COPD following an exacerbation. If so, keep the dose as low as possible
and prescribe osteoporosis prophylaxis if indicated. Warn regarding
steroid side-effects and document.
Oxygen can be administered via a cylinder for short burst oxygen therapy
as required for symptomatic relief, such as after climbing stairs (there is

PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF STABLE COPD

little trial evidence to support this use—only continue if improvement in
breathlessness documented), or as long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) via
an oxygen concentrator. The latter is for patients in respiratory failure,
with a PaO2 <7.3 kPa or PaO2 of 7.3–8 kPa with any of secondary polycythaemia, peripheral oedema, or pulmonary hypertension present, to use
for a minimum of 15 h per day (including sleep). Additional ambulatory
cylinders can be provided. Low ﬂow oxygen, such as 2–4 L/min via nasal
prongs, is usually adequate. Small changes in CO2 retention with oxygen
administration can be tolerated if asymptomatic and no respiratory acidosis.
Associated OSA is a risk factor for CO2 retention. (For further information on prescribing oxygen, see p 703.)

Vaccination Inﬂuenza vaccine annually and pneumococcal vaccine.
Meta-analysis showed a decrease in exacerbations occurs 3 weeks after
receiving inﬂuenza vaccine and there is no evidence of an earlier increase
in exacerbations due directly to vaccination.

Antibiotics No trials of antibiotic prophylaxis have been done. Many
respiratory physicians prescribe low-dose rotating antibiotics, particularly
over the winter. Trials are urgently required. It is likely that this strategy
would be more effective than inhaled steroids.
Mucolytics (carbocisteine, mecysteine hydrochloride) may beneﬁt some
patients with chronic productive cough to facilitate expectoration by
reducing sputum viscosity. Prescribe for a 4-week trial period and only
continue if there is evidence of improvement. Meta-analyses show mucolytics cause a signiﬁcant decrease in the number of COPD exacerbations
and decrease the number of days of disability, although the beneﬁt may
only apply if the patient is not taking inhaled steroids. Worth trying in
those with moderate to severe COPD, with frequent or prolonged exacerbations, or those repeatedly in hospital with COPD exacerbations.
Caution if known peptic ulcer disease.

Palliative care/respiratory sedation Use of low-dose sedatives, such
as morphine sulphate solution 10 mg as required or diazepam 2 mg bd,
can be used as a palliative measure (see pp 720–21), aiming to relieve
the sensation of dyspnoea and associated anxiety, in those with severe
COPD. Dose may need to be titrated against any rise in CO2 (surprisingly
uncommon).

New anti-inﬂammatory drugs
Erdosteine is a thiol compound with effects on bacterial adhesiveness as
well as anti-oxidant and mucoactive properties. RCT in moderate COPD
showed decreased exacerbations vs. placebo over 8 months, no loss of
lung function, and improved health-related quality of life.
Roﬂumilast and cilomilast are phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, which
elicit anti-inﬂammatory effects. RCT of roﬂumilast in moderate to severe
COPD showed a signiﬁcant improvement in FEV1 over 24 h vs. placebo
and a reduction in the rate of mild exacerbations. Long-term studies are
required to evaluate its efﬁcacy and role further. Cilomilast has shown
similar results.

CHAPTER 21

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

An approach to COPD in the out-patient clinic
• Establish diagnosis and severity—pulmonary function tests, CXR
• Ensure there are no other causes for symptoms, e.g. anaemia, pulmonary emboli, heart failure, interstitial lung disease, thyroid dysfunction,
pneumothorax, large bulla, arrhythmia, depression
• Encourage the patient to stop smoking
• Review current treatment—optimize bronchodilatation and inhaled
steroids
• Assess whether there is any need for a nebulizer
• Check oxygen saturation and perform blood gas if <92%. Consider
LTOT
• Consider pulmonary rehabilitation
• Check vaccinations are up to date
• Involve respiratory nurse specialist for input in the community if
appropriate
• Follow up in clinic if ongoing medical issues, including whether patient
may be a lung transplant candidate (see p 318). Otherwise discharge
back to GP
• Inform GP of all the above decisions.

PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF STABLE COPD

How to perform a steroid trial to help distinguish asthma
from COPD (if diagnosis unclear)
Measure FEV1 and slow VC before and after:
• either a high-dose inhaled steroid for 6–8 weeks
• or a 2-week course of oral prednisolone, 30 mg/day
>15% increase in FEV1 implies steroid reversibility and patient is likely
to have asthma.
>15% increase in slow VC suggests signiﬁcantly reduced air trapping and
may indicate signiﬁcant asthma. May occur with a signiﬁcantly smaller
change in FEV1.
Document results of trial clearly in notes.

Testing for bronchodilator reversibility to help distinguish
asthma from COPD
• Check FEV1. Give patient a short acting B2 agonist, either
nebulized or inhaled via spacer. 15–30 min after this, recheck
the FEV1.
• Subtract the pre-test value from the post-test value, divide the difference by the pre-test value, and express as a percentage increase
from baseline. >15% increase or >200 ml indicates bronchodilator
reversibility
• Avoid short-acting bronchodilator in the preceding 6 h, a long-acting
bronchodilator in the preceding 12 h, or a long-acting anticholinergic
or slow release theophylline in the preceding 24 h.

175

176

CHAPTER 21

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

COPD exacerbations
Exacerbations may cause mild symptoms in those with relatively preserved
lung function, but can cause considerable morbidity in those with limited
respiratory reserve. It has been increasingly recognized that signiﬁcant
numbers of patients do not regain their premorbid lung function or quality
of life following an exacerbation, and those with frequent exacerbations
experience a more rapid FEV1 decline than those with fewer exacerbations.
Exacerbation frequency increases with COPD severity. Exacerbations are
50% more likely in winter (possibly viruses survive better in the cold and
people crowd together indoors). An exacerbation is essentially a clinical
diagnosis.

Causes may be infective organisms, either viral or bacterial, or non-infective
causes, such as pollution or temperature fall. Common bacterial pathogens
are Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella
catarrhalis, and the commonest viral pathogens are rhinovirus, RSV, inﬂuenza, coronavirus, and adenovirus. Consider the possibility of PE or pneumothorax.
Symptoms include increased sputum volume and/or purulence,
increasing dyspnoea or wheeze, chest tightness, ﬂuid retention.
Pathophysiology There is increased airway resistance due to bronchospasm, mucosal oedema, and increased sputum. This worsens expiratory ﬂow limitation and expiration takes longer. Shallow rapid breathing
further limits the time for expiration. This promotes dynamic hyperinﬂation and this itself causes mechanical compromise within the lung and the
airway. Maximal recruitment of the accessory muscles is required and
thoraco-abdominal dysynchrony is often present.

COPD EXACERBATIONS

22 Management summary: acute exacerbation of COPD
• Assess the severity of the exacerbation by measuring respiratory
rate, oxygen saturations, degree of air entry, tachycardia, BP,
peripheral perfusion, conscious level, mental state
• Exclude a pneumothorax clinically
• If hypoxic, give controlled 24–35% oxygen via Venturi facemask to aim
for SaO2 88–92%, salbutamol nebulizer, establish venous access
• Check blood gas
• Request a CXR
• Perform ECG
• Check bloods for WCC, CRP, potassium, etc.
• Optimize volume status
• Take a brief history if possible. Important to know what patient’s
normal functional status is like, such as exercise tolerance and the
need for help with activities of daily living. Old hospital notes are
helpful regarding severity of disease, and whether previous decisions
have been made regarding ventilation or resuscitation
• Nebulized bronchodilators—salbutamol 2.5–5 mg and ipratropium
500 µg on arrival and 4–6-hourly. Run nebulizer with air not oxygen
• Continued oxygen therapy, aiming to maintain saturations between
80% and 90%. Repeat blood gases after 60 min to ensure improvement
if hypoxic or acidotic. Repeat if clinical deterioration
• Consider antibiotics
• Oral steroids
• Consider intravenous aminophylline if not improving with nebulizers
• Consider intensive care—ideally consultant-led decision with the
patient, their family, and ITU regarding invasive mechanical ventilation.
Document in the medical notes. Consider resuscitation status
• Consider non-invasive ventilation—pH 7.3 or less, hypoxia,
hypercapnia, conscious. Decide if this is the ceiling of therapy
• Consider doxapram if NIV not available or not tolerated
• DVT prophylaxis
• Early mobilization
• Nutrition.

CHAPTER 21

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Management of exacerbations
• Assess the severity of the exacerbation: increase in dyspnoea,
tachypnoea, use of accessory muscles, new cyanosis, pedal oedema,
or confusion
• Exclude alternative diagnoses, such as pneumothorax, PE, pulmonary
oedema)
• Can the patient self-care and self-medicate? In the presence of severe
symptoms, with possible comorbid disease and decreased functional
activities, the patient is likely to need hospital management
• Investigate with CXR, ABGs, ECG, FBC, and U&Es. Admission
arterial pH is the best predictor of survival. A pH <7.25 is
associated with a rapidly rising mortality. A raised pH may imply an
alternative diagnosis, not associated with worsening airways obstruction.
Check theophylline level if patient is taking regularly; consider sending
sputum for culture if it is purulent.

Treatment
• Antibiotics if sputum purulent, pyrexial, high CRP, new changes on CXR
• Systemic steroids for all patients with exacerbations of COPD who
are admitted to hospital or are signiﬁcantly more breathless than
usual. Give prednisolone 30 mg/day for 1 to 2 weeks, unless there are
speciﬁc contraindications. Optimum dose and length of steroids not
established. This improves FEV1, improves symptoms, and shortens
recovery time. Long-term steroid treatment should be avoided due to
side-effects. If the patient has a longer course of steroids, or repeated
courses due to repeated exacerbations, the dose will need to be tailed
off slowly
• Inhaled or nebulized bronchodilators Breathless unwell patients may
beneﬁt from nebulizer therapy in the acute period to reduce
symptoms and improve airﬂow obstruction
• Controlled oxygen therapy 24–35% via Venturi facemask, with oximetry,
arterial blood gases, or capillary gas monitoring. Guidelines suggest
maintaining saturations between 88% and 92%, balancing hypoxia,
hypercapnia, and pH. Too little oxygen causes anaerobic metabolism
and metabolic acidosis (probably SaO2 >80% would prevent this); too
much oxygen (SaO2 >92%) can cause hypercapnia and a respiratory acidosis. A deteriorating pH to below 7.25 has a much poorer prognosis.
Make sure your instructions to the ward staff are clear as to the need
to keep the SaO2 within this window by changing the % O2 delivered as
necessary. Falling conscious level is the best clinical marker of signiﬁcant
CO2 retention and acidosis
• Intravenous aminophylline Evidence is lacking regarding the effectiveness of IV aminophylline, but it may be beneﬁcial, particularly if the
patient is wheezy and has not improved with nebulizers alone. Give
a loading dose, unless the patient is on regular oral aminophylline,
followed by a maintenance infusion. Need to monitor aminophylline
levels daily. Main side-effects are tachycardia and nausea.

MANAGEMENT OF EXACERBATIONS

• Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) Effective in supporting patients during an
exacerbation, when maximal medical treatment has not been effective.
Appropriate for conscious patients with ongoing respiratory acidosis
(pH 7.35 or less), hypoxia, and hypercapnia. May avoid intubation.
Ceiling of treatment should be determined before its use (See p 693.).
• Doxapram Intravenous respiratory stimulant. Can be used to drive
respiratory rate (if below 20 /min) and depth in COPD exacerbation
and hence improve hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis, particularly when induced by oxygen therapy. It can overdrive breathing to
the point of respiratory muscle fatigue, collapse, and death, and causes
metabolic acidosis, agitation, and cardiac arrhythmias. It should only
be used at the lowest possible dose (0.5–3 mg/min) in the short term
(usually 24–36 h), aiming to reduce PaCO2 (and raise pH) by only a
small amount. Its use has largely been replaced by NIV, but may be used
if NIV is not available or not tolerated.
• Acetazolamide generates a metabolic acidosis by reducing the kidney’s
ability to secrete [H+] into urine (blocks carbonic anhydrase that interconverts CO2 and H+/HCO3–). There is only one situation in which
provoking a metabolic acidosis might be appropriate: following a transient period of hypoventilation (perhaps due to pump failure/increased
airways obstruction) or after permissive hypercapnia on the ICU, the
previous appropriate compensatory rise in blood [HCO3–] can now
be too high for the improving PaCO2. This generates a blood alkalosis
(pH>7.4), which itself depresses ventilation, and delays the return
of PaO2 and PaCO2 to normal. The judicious use of a few doses of
acetazolamide (250 mg OD), but only safe when the pH is alkaline, can
hasten the recovery.
• Intubation/intensive care If the patient is not responding to medical
therapy, a decision regarding invasive mechanical ventilation needs
to be made. This may be considered to be appropriate if the patient
usually has a good functional status, with minimal other comorbidity.
These decisions should ideally be discussed with the patient, their
family, their consultant, and the ITU consultant, and documented in the
medical notes. Resuscitation decisions should also be made.
• Early rehabilitation to prevent muscle wasting and deconditioning
• Nutrition
• Acute respiratory assessment service (ARAS)/‘Hospital at home’
Respiratory nurse-led service supporting early discharge of COPD
patients after hospital assessment and providing ongoing respiratory
care at home. CXR, SaO2, and baseline spirometry (if this is ﬁrst
presentation) should be performed prior to discharge. Reduces length
of in-patient stay and hence is an economic alternative. Unsuitable
patients are those with impaired GCS, acute confusion, pH<7.35, acute
changes on CXR, concomitant medical problems requiring in-patient
stay, insufﬁcient social support (including living far from the hospital and
not having a telephone), new hypoxia with SaO2 <90%, and unable to
provide oxygen at home.

CHAPTER 21

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Surgical treatment
Lung transplant In young patients (below 60–65) with severe disease,
often due to α1-antitrypsin deﬁciency, single lung transplant may be an
option. Local transplant teams will advise regarding local criteria.
Bullectomy Suitable for selected patients who are breathless, have
FEV1 <50% predicted, and isolated large bulla seen on CT. Improves chest
hyperinﬂation.

Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) Resection of areas of
bullous emphysema to reduce chest hyperinﬂation and improve diaphragmatic function, elastic recoil, physiology of the lungs, and hence functional
status of the patient. Patients who may be considered are those with FEV1
20–30% predicted, with symptomatic dyspnoea despite maximal medical
therapy, and with upper lobe predominant emphysema on CT, giving
target areas to resect. PaCO2 should be less than 7.3 kPa and TLCO >20%
predicted. Pre-operative assessment: PFTs, 6 min walk test, quality of life,
and dyspnoea indicators. Surgery is performed in specialist centres via
median sternotomy or by thoracoscopy. Usually the upper lobe is stapled
below the level of the emphysema and then removed. Improvements are
seen in FEV1 and RV, dyspnoea, and quality of life scores. These effects are
maximal between 2 and 6 months post-surgery. Symptomatic improvement is sustained for about 2–4 years. Post-operative complications: persistent air leak >7 days in 30–40%, pneumonia in up to 22%, respiratory
failure in up to 13%. Post-operative mortality 2.4–17% reported.
The National Emphysema Treatment Trial (Michigan, USA) randomized
1218 patients to receive medical treatment or LVRS. Mean airﬂow limitation of the subjects was 27% predicted. The most recent analysis, published after 4 years of follow-up, has shown LVRS demonstrates an overall
survival advantage compared with medical therapy alone. Improvements
in maximal exercise and health-related quality of life were also found
over 3 and 4 years, respectively. The greatest survival beneﬁts, improved
exercise and symptoms over 5 years, were in those with both low exercise capacity and upper-lobe-predominant emphysema. Those with high
exercise capacity and upper-lobe-predominant emphysema obtained no
survival advantage, but exercise and health-related quality of life improved.
Interim analysis had shown increased mortality from LVRS for patients
with FEV1 or TLCO <20% predicted, or with homogeneous emphysema.
Surgery is not, therefore, recommended for these groups.
Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction is under evaluation, with one-way
valve implants placed within the segmental and sub-segmental bronchi
that supply the hyperinﬂated lobes. It is a minimally invasive variation on
lung volume reduction surgery, with the aim of improving lung function
and quality of life. Pilot studies in end-stage emphysema (mean FEV1 30%
predicted) have shown the procedure to be safe, although a small subset
of patients developed pneumothorax and one death (in 98 patients) has
been reported. Signiﬁcant improvements in RV, FEV1, FVC and 6 min walk
were found at 30 and 90 days. A multi-centre RCT (the VENT trial) has been
completed of best medical care (including pulmonary rehabilitation) vs.

SURGICAL TREATMENT

best medical care plus unilateral endoscopic bronchial valve. Early presented
results (ERS 2007) of 321 patients after 6 months of follow up (220 in the
valve group) showed a signiﬁcant improvement in FEV1 and 6 min walk test
in the valve group. Knowledge and skill is improving in this area and further
studies are planned.
Airway bypass aims to improve respiratory mechanics by creating new exit
pathways for air trapped in emphysematous lungs. The wall of a segmental
bronchus is punctured under bronchoscopic guidance and a stent is
inserted, creating an internal bronchopulmonary communication for expiration. Hence, hyperinﬂation decreases and lung mechanics are improved.
This is at an early stage of research.

CHAPTER 21

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

a1-antitrypsin (a1-AT) deﬁciency
This is an inherited condition that is associated with the early development
of emphysema. It is common (estimated 1 in 2000–5000 individuals) and is
probably under-diagnosed, as it is often asymptomatic in non-smokers.

Pathophysiology A1-AT is a glycoprotein protease inhibitor produced

by the liver. It is secreted via the bloodstream into the lungs and opposes
neutrophil elastase, which destroys alveolar wall connective tissue. Elastase
is produced in increased levels by pulmonary neutrophils and macrophages in response to smoking and lung infections. If A1-AT is deﬁcient, the
elastase cannot be opposed, and subsequently basal emphysema develops.
The disease is worse in smokers and can cause COPD at a young age
(40s and 50s). There may also be associated liver dysfunction, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatoma, as abnormal protein secretion accumulates
in the liver. Predisposition also to skin disease (panniculitis) and vasculitis
(especially ANCA +).

Genetics A1-AT deﬁciency is inherited as an autosomal co-dominant dis-

order. So far more than 100 different alleles have been identiﬁed for this
gene (SERPINA 1) on the long arm of chromosome 14. The commonest
alleles are the M allele (normal), the partially defective S allele, and the
almost fully defective Z allele (lysine is substituted for glutamic acid at
position 342, leading to abnormal folding, preventing post-translational
processing with retention within cells), commonest in Scandinavia.
• MM, the normal phenotype. Background population risk of emphysema
• MS, MZ have 50–70% of normal A1-protease inhibitor (Pi) levels. Background risk of emphysema
• SZ, SS have 35–50% of normal levels. 20–50% risk of emphysema
• Homozygous ZZ has only 10–20% of normal levels. 80–100% risk of
emphysema

Screening for the defect should be carried out especially in patients
<40 with COPD. Also patients with unexplained liver disease should be
screened. Send blood for A1-AT concentrations and genotyping if levels
are low. Siblings should be screened and the particular importance of
not smoking and avoiding passive smoking emphasized. Non-smokers are
usually asymptomatic.

Treatment includes usual therapy for COPD. Speciﬁc treatment is
known as augmentation therapy, with weekly/2-weekly/monthly infusions of
puriﬁed A1-AT from pooled human plasma. This raises concentrations in
serum and epithelial-lining ﬂuid above the protective threshold. It appears
to be safe, with minimal side-effects. A large cohort study showed reduced
mortality amongst infusion recipients, with a slowing of lung function
decline (by 27 ml/year, p = 0.03) in a subgroup with moderate emphysema.
An RCT showed no signiﬁcant differences between augmentation and
control groups, although there was a trend towards slower loss of lung
tissue on CT scan in the augmentation group (p = 0.07). It has, however,
been recommended as a treatment by groups including the ATS and ERS

A 1 -ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY

for those with moderate (FEV1 35–60% predicted) emphysema due to
A1-AT deﬁciency, but not those with mild or severe disease or those post
lung transplant for A1-AT deﬁciency, except during episodes of acute
rejection and infection (when inﬂammation causes free elastase activity).
It is expensive and its cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per year of life
saved is high. It is, however, the only speciﬁc therapy available at present.

Future developments Inhaled A1-AT may provide a way of delivering

the enzyme to the lower respiratory tract to have its action locally and
potentially reduce inﬂammation. Gene therapy is under development, ﬁnding
ways of delivering the A1-AT gene into the cell. Other strategies include inhibition of hepatic polymerization of A1-AT, promotion of hepatic secretion,
inhibition of neutrophil elastase by synthetic inhibitors to avoid the use of
human plasma, and pegylation of A1-AT to prolong its serum half-life.

CHAPTER 22

Connective tissue disease and the lung

Differential diagnosis and
standard tests
Patients with connective tissue diseases can develop pulmonary complications, for which they might be referred to a chest physician. Patients
typically present with symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, fever, or chest pain.
They may often be on immunosuppressive drugs.

Differential diagnosis
In practice, the main differential diagnosis lies between:
Opportunistic pulmonary infection
• May be in those on immunosuppressive drugs, or functionally immunosuppressed from underlying disease
• Any usual organism, also TB, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, PCP, fungi,
cytomegalovirus
• Often acute onset with non-speciﬁc features of low-grade fever,
productive cough, raised inﬂammatory markers
• Can be very unwell and need full supportive treatment with ITU.
Original connective tissue disease now affecting the lung
• Often inﬂammation or ﬁbrosis
• Usually more indolent presentation, with dry cough and dyspnoea, but
can become acutely unwell with background of chronic lung disease
• Fine inspiratory crackles on auscultation
• Consider development of pulmonary hypertension in patients with
systemic sclerosis.
New pulmonary pathology
• Unrelated to the original condition, including pulmonary thromboembolic
disease.
Drug side-effects
• Methotrexate—pneumonitis occurs in 5% of patients receiving
methotrexate. Potentially life-threatening. Mortality 15–20%. Cough,
fever, dyspnoea, widespread crackles, restrictive defect, and pulmonary
inﬁltrates on CXR and CT. Peripheral eosinophilia in 50%. BAL
lymphocytosis. Usually subacute onset, but may be sudden. Usually
within 4 months of starting methotrexate. Non-speciﬁc histological
ﬁndings. No more common in those with pre-existing lung disease.
Treatment: stop the drug, commence steroids, and avoid methotrexate
in the future. Can be reversible. Can get mild intractable cough with
methotrexate
• Gold—alveolar opacities seen on HRCT, with associated fever and
skin rash. BAL lymphocytosis. Treatment: stop the drug and commence
steroids. Usually reversible
• Penicillamine—causes obliterative bronchiolitis in rheumatoid arthritis.
Can also cause a hypersensitivity pneumonitis and a pulmonary–renal
syndrome causing alveolar haemorrhage. May respond to stopping the
drug.

CHAPTER 22

Connective tissue disease and the lung

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
• Persistent deforming symmetrical peripheral arthropathy
• Pulmonary disease is commoner in men and occasionally occurs before
the development of joint problems
• Pneumonia is a common terminal event, causing 15–20% of rheumatoid
arthritis deaths

Pleuritis Frequent, occurring in more than 30% of patients and usually
mild. Pleuritic pain, with no obvious other cause.
Pleural effusion Usually asymptomatic. Fluid is typically exudative with
a low glucose and low pH and usually a lymphocytosis. Need to exclude
other causes for effusion, such as empyema or malignancy. If problematic,
may require drainage and steroids. (See p 360.)
Pulmonary ﬁbrosis Minor pulmonary ﬁbrosis found in up to 60% of
patients in lung biopsy studies, but CXR changes only seen in 1–5%. Hence
symptomatic disease is unusual. Tends to occur in patients who have multisystem disease, including vasculitis, and those with nodules, seropositive
disease, and high ANA titres. More common in men, and smoking is a risk
factor for ﬁbrosis development.
• Presents with progressive dyspnoea
• Examination: clubbing and bilateral basal crepitations
• PFTs: low kCO, restrictive pattern
• Radiologically and histologically similar to usual interstitial pneumonitis
(UIP), with subpleural basal reticular pattern, but can be like nonspeciﬁc interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP)
• Treatment: steroids or immunosuppressants do little to change the
course, but should be tried
Acute pneumonitis also recognized, which presents with rapidly deteriorating dyspnoea and development of respiratory failure, or acute deterioration on a background of chronic ﬁbrosis. Acute pneumonitis tends to be
more steroid responsive.

Pulmonary nodules occur in less than 5% of patients with RA. Usually
found incidentally on CXR. Only occur in seropositive disease, and patients
may have other nodules elsewhere, such as elbows and ﬁngers. Single or
multiple; may measure up to 7 cm. May cavitate and cause haemoptysis
or pneumothorax. Mostly asymptomatic. Main differential diagnosis is lung
cancer. Usually followed on CT to ensure they are of stable size. They typically show mild uptake on PET, consistent with other benign lesions. May
need biopsy to exclude malignancy.
Bronchiectasis is often subtle with minimal clinical features, but may
be found in 30%. May be seen in association with pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
Diagnosis made on HRCT.
Organizing pneumonia The clinical syndrome of pneumonia with
fever, dyspnoea, and multifocal consolidation, which do not respond to
antibiotics. Can be disease- or drug-induced (gold), or have no obvious
cause, and is then known as cryptogenic (see p 270). Conﬁrmed by transbronchial or open lung biopsy showing acini ﬁlled with loose connective

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

tissue and a variable inﬂammatory inﬁltrate. Often a dramatic response to
steroids. May need long-term immunosuppression.

Obliterative bronchiolitis Rare. Terminal bronchioles progressively
obliterated by inﬂammatory connective tissue.
• May present with dyspnoea and hyperinﬂated chest, with basal crepitations
• PFTs: irreversible obstructive pattern
• CXR: hyperinﬂation, no inﬁltrates
• HRCT: mosaic pattern
• Biopsy shows destruction of terminal bronchiolar wall by granulation
tissue, effacement of the lumen, and replacement of the bronchiole by
ﬁbrous tissue. Irreversible pathology, usually unresponsive to treatment
• May be rapidly progressive
• Can give trial of oral steroids, continuing with high-dose inhaled steroids if any response. Consider transplant. Penicillamine was thought to
be a causative factor, but the evidence for this is now weaker.
Vasculitis and rarely pulmonary haemorrhage.
Cricoarytenoid arthritis Seen in studies in up to 75% of patients with
rheumatoid arthritis by ﬁbre-optic laryngoscopy and HRCT, but rarely
symptomatic. Unrelated to lung ﬁbrosis. Can cause sore throat, hoarse
voice, upper airways obstruction with stridor, or OSA. Flow–volume loop
may be abnormal. This may need tracheostomy and steroids—oral and
joint injection.

Caplan’s syndrome Rheumatoid arthritis, single or multiple chest
nodules, and coal-worker's pneumoconiosis.

CHAPTER 22

Connective tissue disease and the lung

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
• Multi-organ autoimmune disease, mainly affecting women
• Double-stranded DNA antibodies present in high titres and these may
be the causative agent
• Can also get a drug-induced lupus syndrome, which improves when the
drug is stopped
• Pulmonary disease often seen and may be a presenting feature of the
disease

Pleural disease Most common manifestation of pulmonary disease.
Often asymptomatic, but may have pain due to pleuritis. Pleural effusions
found in 50% of patients, which cause breathlessness. These are often bilateral and exudative, with a neutrophilia or a lymphocytosis if the effusion
is chronic. Can be haemorrhagic. Pleural biopsy ﬁndings are non-speciﬁc.
Need to exclude other causes for effusion, such as empyema or malignancy.
If symptomatic, may need treatment with non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs or steroids.
Atelectasis associated with pleurisy or effusion.
Diffuse lung disease Occurs in up to 70% of patients, but usually mild
and asymptomatic. Radiologically similar to rheumatoid lung ﬁbrosis. Only
5% develop clinical disease similar to UIP with dyspnoea, cough, and basal
crackles. May be associated with pleuritic pain. PFTs show restrictive
defect with reduced kCO. Rarely, progressive and severe.

Acute lupus pneumonitis In <2%, severe illness with high mortality rate of over 50%. Cough, dyspnoea, fever, pleuritic pain, hypoxia.
Widespread crackles. CXR shows inﬁltrates, which may be widespread.
Histologically non-speciﬁc. Need to exclude infection, pulmonary oedema.
Treatment with steroids and cytotoxic drugs may be necessary and may
have dramatic response. Can progress to chronic interstitial pneumonitis.
Bronchiolitis obliterans See p 161.
Pulmonary nodules See p 312.
Pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary vasoconstriction, rather
than pulmonary vasculitis. Commoner in those with Raynaud’s phenomenon. Associated with poorer prognosis: 50% 2-year mortality. Diagnosed
on echocardiography. Need to exclude pulmonary emboli as a cause,
especially in those with antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment as for idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (see p 394).

Pulmonary emboli Commoner in the 20–30% with antiphospholipid
antibodies.

Shrinking lung syndrome Dyspnoea caused by reduced lung volumes
and poor respiratory reserve due to diaphragmatic muscle weakness.
Small lungs on CXR. Normal lung parenchyma on CT. Restrictive lung
function tests, with high kCO. May improve with steroids.
Alveolar haemorrhage Rare. May be life-threatening. Can have associated glomerulonephritis. Acute dyspnoea with inﬁltrates on CXR. Raised
kCO. Treat with high-dose steroids + cyclophosphamide.

CHAPTER 22

Connective tissue disease and the lung

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis
These are two separate disorders:
• Polymyositis is an inﬂammatory myopathy, causing symmetrical
proximal muscle weakness
• Dermatomyositis is an inﬂammatory myopathy with a characteristic rash
Creatine kinase levels raised up to 50 times normal. Antinuclear and
myositis speciﬁc antibodies positive (Jo-1). Dermatomyositis is frequently
associated with underlying malignancy, including lung, oesophagus, breast,
colon, and ovary, so therefore needs thorough investigation. Pulmonary
complications are a common and frequent cause of death and occur in
both conditions.

Pulmonary ﬁbrosis in 20–30%. Patients present with dyspnoea. Mostly
there is basal ﬁbrosis—usually similar to UIP, but can develop a more acute
pneumonitis resembling acute interstitial pneumonia (p 272).
• HRCT shows patchy consolidation and peripheral reticular pattern
• Histology may show features of organizing pneumonia and ﬁbrosing
alveolitis, and therefore may have better response to treatment
• Lung involvement frequently associated with antisynthetase antibodies
• May require treatment with steroids or cyclophosphamide

Ventilatory failure due to intercostal and diaphragmatic muscle weakness. Restrictive defect on PFTs.

Organizing pneumonia Poorer prognosis if associated with features
of ﬁbrosis.

Pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease.
Pulmonary vasculitis causing haemoptysis or, rarely, alveolar
haemorrhage.

Aspiration pneumonia in 20%, associated with marked increase in
mortality. Caused by dysphagia and pharyngeal muscle weakness and
regurgitation.

POLYMYOSITIS AND DERMATOMYOSITIS

Criteria for diagnosis of poly/dermatomyositis
• Symmetrical proximal muscle weakness developing over weeks or
months
• Elevated serum muscle enzymes, creatine kinase, and aldolase
• Typical EMG ﬁndings:
• Myopathic potentials (low amplitude, short duration, polyphasic)
• Fibrillation
• Complex repetitive discharges
• Typical muscle biopsy ﬁndings—endomysial inﬂammation
• Dermatological features of dermatomyositis:
• Gottron’s papules, involving ﬁngers, elbows, knees, and medial
malleoli
• Heliotrope sign around the eyes
• Erythematous rash around back, shoulders, upper chest, and face

CHAPTER 22

Connective tissue disease and the lung

Systemic sclerosis
This disease affects women more than men (4:1), and often presents in the
ﬁfth decade. It is a clinical diagnosis and there are 4 types:
• Limited cutaneous (formerly known as CREST). Accounts for 60% of
systemic sclerosis cases. Patients often have longstanding Raynaud’s,
and develop non-pitting oedema of the ﬁngers, which become ‘sausageshaped’. Develop thick shiny skin after few weeks–months. Later they
can develop skin changes on the hands, face, and neck, microstomia,
digital and facial telangectasias, intra- and subcutaneous calciﬁcation,
and oesophageal dysmotility (74%). Patients can also develop
pulmonary ﬁbrosis (26%), pulmonary hypertension (21%), cardiac (9%)
and renal disease (8%), but less commonly than in diffuse cutaneous
disease
• Diffuse cutaneous Abrupt onset disease, with widespread symmetrical
itchy painful swelling of ﬁngers, arms, feet, legs, and face, and associated
constitutional symptoms. There is oedema, which is replaced by tight
shiny skin, bound to underlying structures, within a few months. There is
cutaneous thickening, as well as hypo- or hyperpigmentation. Raynaud’s
phenomenon is present, as well as skin sclerosis on the trunk and upper
arms, arthropathy, renal disease (18%), pulmonary ﬁbrosis (41%),
pulmonary hypertension (17%), and cardiac (12%) and GI disease (68%)
• Overlap syndromes, or mixed connective tissue disease, have features
of systemic sclerosis together with those of at least one other
autoimmune rheumatic disease, such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis,
polymyositis. Over time other organ involvement may develop and
evolve into a more deﬁned disease
• Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma Vascular or ﬁbrotic visceral features
without skin scleroderma. May or may not have Raynaud’s phenomenon.
May develop interstitial lung disease, oesophagitis, arrhythmias, malabsorption, pseudo-obstruction, renal failure. Less than 2% of cases.
Systemic sclerosis pulmonary disease is the most common cause of death
in patients with systemic sclerosis.

Pulmonary ﬁbrosis is seen at post-mortem in up to 75% of patients.
Antinuclear antibody is positive in 60%, of speckled or nucleolar type.
Pulmonary involvement is seen particularly if Scl 70 antibody is present.
Anticentromere antibodies, however, are associated with reduced risk.
• Present with dyspnoea and a history of Raynaud’s
• Examination Signs of systemic sclerosis, ﬁne bibasal crepitations
• PFTs show restrictive defect and reduced kCO. Rapidly falling kCO is a
poor prognostic sign. HRCT is performed if PFTs are abnormal. Mostly
non-speciﬁc interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) pattern on HRCT, but can
be UIP pattern. May need open lung biopsy to conﬁrm diagnosis
• Treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide. A randomized
controlled trial of oral cyclophosphamide vs. placebo in patients
with active alveolitis and scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease
showed a modest but signiﬁcant effect on FVC, dyspnoea and quality of
life (Taskin DP et al. NEJM 2006; 354: 2655–66)

SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS

• Prognosis Systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease has
better prognosis than pure UIP. This may be related to slower disease
progression, rather than any greater response to immunosuppressive
treatment. 15% of patients have progressive and severe disease.
Associated increased risk of lung cancer.

Pulmonary hypertension May be isolated or secondary to interstitial
lung disease. Isolated pulmonary hypertension is characteristic of limited
cutaneous disease, especially in those with cutaneous telangectasias and
anticentromere antibodies. Pathologically similar to primary pulmonary
hypertension. Sub-intimal cell proliferation, endothelial hyperplasia, and
the obliteration of small intrapulmonary vessels.
• Present with dyspnoea, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right heart
failure
• Diagnosis by echocardiography
• Treatment as for PPH (see p 392). May respond to prostacyclin
infusions, or may need transplant
• Prognosis better than for those with PPH.

Chest wall limitation by skin scleroderma over chest (‘hide-bound
chest’).

Organizing pneumonia See p 270.
Aspiration pneumonia Uncommon and due to oesophageal dysmotility.

195

196

CHAPTER 22

Connective tissue disease and the lung

Sjögren’s syndrome
• Inﬂammation and destruction of primarily the salivary and lachrymal
glands
• Keratoconjunctivitis sicca or xerostomia (dry eyes and dry mouth)
is evidence of primary disease, but when associated with connective
tissue disease, especially rheumatoid arthritis, is secondary Sjögren’s
• Classical Sicca Syndrome includes dry eyes and mouth, and parotid or
salivary gland enlargement
• Pulmonary involvement occurs in about 25%.

Pleurisy
Airways inﬂammation Bronchial hyperresponsiveness, chronic
bronchitis, and small airways disease. Mild abnormalities on PFTs, rarely
signiﬁcant.

Dry cough Atrophy of mucus gland in trachea and bronchi and lymphoplasmocytic inﬁltrate (xerotrachea). Possibly a higher incidence of chest
infections. Treatment: nebulized saline, physiotherapy.
Organizing pneumonia Rare.
Diffuse lung disease Often asymptomatic, but may have cough, dyspnoea,
and crackles on examination. PFTs show a restrictive defect and lymphocytic
interstitial pneumonia (LIP) or UIP pattern on CT.

Lymphoma Unusual, but is 40 times more common in Sjögren’s syndrome, especially in patients with high levels of immunoglobulins, autoantibodies, and cryoglobulins. Usually B-cell lymphoma. Can mimic organizing
pneumonia.

ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS

Ankylosing spondylitis
• Chronic inﬂammatory disease causing spinal ankylosis with sacroiliac
joint involvement
• 90% of Caucasian patients are HLA B27 positive.

Pulmonary ﬁbrosis occurs in 2%, especially those with advanced
disease. Typically bilaterally in the upper lobes. May develop cysts/cavities
and become colonized with Aspergillus, which can require treatment.

Pleural involvement Pleuritis and apical pleural thickening.
Restrictive defect Due to ﬁxed deformity of the thorax, limiting breathing
and leading to respiratory failure due to nocturnal hypoventilation.
Nocturnal NIV may be indicated.

CHAPTER 22

Connective tissue disease and the lung

Behçet’s syndrome
• Systemic vasculitis involving arteries and veins of all sizes with recurrent oral ± genital ulceration and chronic relapsing uveitis, which can
cause blindness
• Marked geographical distribution, with greatest prevalence in Turkey,
Iran, and Japan
• Musculoskeletal, skin, neurological, GI, and major artery and vein
involvement.

Pulmonary arterial aneurysms, arterial and venous thrombosis, and
pulmonary infarcts in <5%. Recurrent haemoptysis is the main manifestation. This can be massive and fatal. Pulmonary aneurysms are seen as
non-cavitating shadows on CXR and conﬁrmed by CT. These are associated with DVT, therefore making anticoagulation difﬁcult due to possible
haemoptysis from the aneurysm.

Pleural effusion rare.

Cor pulmonale

201

202

CHAPTER 23

Cor pulmonale

Deﬁnition Cor pulmonale is the traditional term for changes in the cardiovascular system resulting from the chronic hypoxia (and usually hypercapnia) of chronic lung disease, mainly pulmonary hypertension and ﬂuid
retention. It does not include similar changes seen in some left-sided
disorders such as mitral incompetence.
Causes and pathophysiology Cor pulmonale can occur in most situations where there is chronic hypoxia.
• Most often in the setting of hypoxic and hypercapnic COPD
• Hypoventilation syndromes (scoliosis, neuromuscular diseases)
• Much less common when there is no associated rise in PaCO2 (e.g.
with interstitial lung diseases).
Cor pulmonale is often also referred to as ‘right heart failure’, which is
misleading as the cardiac output in cor pulmonale is usually normal or
high with increased peripheral perfusion (hence, the ‘bounding pulse’ of type II
ventilatory failure). The right ventricle (RV) can cope with much higher pressures than usually occur in cor pulmonale, such as in idiopathic pulmonary
arterial hypertension, if allowed time to adapt. In true right heart failure
the RV fails to develop an adequate cardiac output, e.g. following rightsided MI, or pulmonary emboli that occlude a large proportion of the
pulmonary vascular bed. This also produces a raised JVP, but in contrast
there will be a low cardiac output and poor peripheral perfusion.

Cor pulmonale results from the following sequence
of events
• Lung disease causes hypoxia with cyanosis and often polycythaemia
• Hypoxia is sensed both within the kidney and via the carotid body,
generating increases in sympathetic activity and renal vasoconstriction
• Increased sympathetic activity (and other mechanisms) leads to renal
retention of salt and water
• This extra salt and water is mainly held in the capacitance vessels (the
large veins) often with a raised JVP
• If vascular permeability rises (particularly when the PaCO2 rises, producing peripheral vasodilatation and an increase in capillary pressure),
extra ﬂuid accumulates in dependent tissues, mainly the ankles
• A raised JVP and ankle oedema in this setting are NOT due to
impaired right ventricular function, but to ﬂuid overload and
increased vascular permeability.
Patients often present with their ﬁrst episode of ankle swelling during an
exacerbation of their COPD, when for the ﬁrst time the PaCO2 rises and
the PaO2 falls far enough to provoke the above events. Body weight may
not actually rise suddenly with the onset of ankle oedema; however, the
extra salt and water retained leading up to the exacerbation moves into
the subcutaneous tissues, probably from the CO2-induced vasodilatation
raising mean capillary hydrostatic pressure.
The hypoxia also raises the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), but to modest
levels for which the RV can easily compensate, particularly if it builds
up slowly. Loss of pulmonary vascular bed from emphysema will also
raise PAP. The ECG often shows right ventricular hypertrophy. During an

exacerbation, extra hypoxia will produce further rises in PAP with which
the RV usually copes, helped by the raised JVP providing a larger pre-load
to increase RV ﬁlling. Excessive diuresis can lead to a true fall in right-sided
output due to inadequate ﬁlling of the RV.

Clinical features
• The underlying disease causing the hypoxia, e.g. COPD/bronchiectasis
• Easily visible veins and a raised JVP
• Cyanosis and a suffused conjunctiva (polycythaemia and vessel dilatation
from the raised CO2)
• Peripheral vasodilatation with a full ‘bounding’ pulse
• Ankle swelling and pitting oedema
• Right ventricular hypertrophy (sternal heave uncommon, masked by
hyperinﬂated lung between heart and chest wall; more often seen with
the higher pressures of IPAH)
• Tricuspid incompetence (not usually severe).

Investigations
CXR—enlarged pulmonary arteries/underlying lung disease
FBC—may have associated polycythaemia
Oximetry—cor pulmonale is unlikely if awake SaO2 over 92%
Blood gases—cor pulmonale progressively more likely as PaO2 drops
below 8 kPa (equivalent SaO2 8 91%), and PaCO2 rises above 6 kPa
• ECG—may indicate right axis deviation, p pulmonale (right atrial hypertrophy), and right bundle branch block
• Echo—dilated or hypertrophied RV, tricuspid regurgitation, estimate of
PAP, and exclude other diagnoses such as a patent ASD
• Overnight oximetry—to reveal unexpected degrees of hypoxia,
e.g. from OSA or diaphragm paralysis.
•
•
•
•

Management Minimal ankle oedema needs no treatment. ‘Trimming’ the
ankles to normal is unnecessary and may reduce RV output by reducing
ﬁlling. If the oedema is more substantial then the following may help:
• Treat underlying condition to raise PaO2 and lower PaCO2
• Raise PaO2 through added oxygen, provide long-term oxygen at home
• In hypoventilation syndromes, home overnight NIV likely to be the
correct management
• Promote a limited diuresis with judicious use of diuretics
• Always elevate legs when sitting.
In general, ‘cor pulmonale’ is over-treated. It is usually a relatively harmless
by-product of hypoxia, rather than a problem in its own right. Treating the
blood gas disturbance, and making it easier for the patient to get his shoes
on, are the main therapeutic aims. The long-term oxygen trials showed
that improving the PaO2 was useful, not that lowering the pulmonary artery
pressure was important.

CHAPTER 24

Cystic ﬁbrosis

General principles
Deﬁnition and pathophysiology
• Multisystem disease due to mutations in the gene encoding for the
cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a
complex chloride channel
• CFTR is essential for regulating salt and water movement across
membranes
• Faulty regulation causes viscous secretions
• In the lungs, these secretions result in colonization with pathogenic
bacteria, causing a massive inﬂammatory response, including elastase
release. This contributes to lung damage and subsequent development
of irreversible bronchiectasis
• In the pancreas, the exocrine ducts become blocked by secretions,
leading to pancreatic enzyme insufﬁciency, pancreatic destruction, and
diabetes mellitus.

Genetics
• Autosomal recessive
• Gene found on the long arm of chromosome 7
• Carrier frequency of this gene in Caucasians 1 in 25. 1 in 2500 UK live
births have cystic ﬁbrosis
• CF is rare in Afro-Caribbeans, but is seen in patients of Asian origin in
the UK and USA
• Heterozygote advantage through resistance to E. coli diarrhoea and
cholera has probably led to persistence of CFTR mutations, despite the
lethal homozygous form
• More than 1500 different mutations in the CFTR gene are recognized
to cause clinical disease
• The most common mutation is ZF508, which accounts for around
67% of CF alleles in the UK and northern Europe. This is a deletion of
3 nucleotides resulting in the omission of a single amino acid,
phenylalanine, at the 508 residue
• 13 other mutations have a frequency of greater than 1%, accounting for
85% of CF alleles altogether. These can be effectively screened for.
They include G542X (3.4%), G551D (2.4%), W1282X (2.1%), and
3905insT (2.1%)
• Different mutations may be associated with particular clinical subgroups. The phenotype–genotype relationship is closest for pancreatic
disease
• Non-CFTR ‘modiﬁer’ genes (such as TNFA, mannose binding lectin,
and A1-antitrypsin), as well as environmental factors, probably further
inﬂuence the clinical picture and account for phenotypic variation.

Screening In the UK, neonatal heel-prick for immunoreactive trypsin
measurement is now offered routinely as part of a new national screening
programme. Prenatal second trimester fetal ultrasound may identify presence of echogenic bowel, which can occur in CF. These babies are then
screened at birth. Those with relatives with CF are advised to have preconception CF genotyping, as are the partners of a patient with CF.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Diagnosis Patients are usually diagnosed with CF as neonates or children
(genetic screening, family history, failure to thrive, meconium ileus, rectal
prolapse, cough, recurrent chest infections). Diagnosis is based on compatible clinical ﬁndings, with biochemical or genetic conﬁrmation. The sweat
chloride test is an important laboratory test, particularly in children. Some
patients are diagnosed with CF in adult life. They usually have different
alleles leading to a milder phenotype.
Management The ongoing care of CF patients moves to the adult CF
centre around the age of 16–18 (often when the patient leaves school),
although a period of transitional care may occur between ages 14–16.
A multidisciplinary team approach is recommended, consisting of respiratory physician, specialist nurse, physiotherapist, pharmacist, dietician,
and psychologist, with regular additional input from gastroenterology and
endocrine teams.
This transition can be a difﬁcult time, as the patient begins to take
more responsibility for their care and treatment. Some may have periods
of rebelling, not taking medications or performing physiotherapy, despite
recognizing the need to do so.
Improved treatment and nutrition of CF patients has led to an increase
in median survival, to around 30 years. The predicted lifespan for a baby
born with CF now is 42 years.
The main management issues for the adult CF patient are:
• Lung disease
• Maintaining lung function
• Monitoring lung bacteriology, including screening for multi-resistant
and transmissible organisms
• Consideration of referral for heart–lung or liver transplant, if and
when appropriate
• Nutrition
• Nutritional support, weight, enzyme replacement, vitamins
• GI
• Annual screening for biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension
• Endocrine
• Annual screening for CF-related diabetes (CFRD)
• Annual screening for osteoporosis
• Fertility advice
• Ensuring psychosocial well-being.

CHAPTER 24

Cystic ﬁbrosis

CF pulmonary sepsis: aetiology
Chronic pulmonary sepsis and its complications cause much of the morbidity
and mortality in CF. The airways of a CF patient are chronically colonized
by pathogenic bacteria from an early age. Bronchiectasis is usually established by a young age (around 5 years).
• Patients commonly expectorate variable volumes of purulent sputum,
even when well
• When organism levels are high, patients may feel generally unwell or
more tired, or have anorexia, weight loss, temperature >38°C
• They may have symptoms of dyspnoea, increased volume of more
purulent sputum, haemoptysis, wheeze, and chest ache
• Examination and CXR can be unchanged from normal
• FEV1 levels are a reliable marker of infection and tend to decrease
by ≥10%
• With effective antibiotic treatment, FEV1 levels should rise to the
pre-infection normal. If they do not, further antibiotics may be necessary,
and other diagnoses or unusual organisms should be considered
• In practice: the FEV1 is the best marker of disease progression and can
be used to assess overall decline, as well as to determine an exacerbation and response to treatment (as PEFR would be used in asthma).

Organisms Airway colonization changes over time, with increasing age
and organisms become more resistant to antibiotics. Goals of management
should be initially to prevent infection, then to eradicate it, and ﬁnally to
control the infection. Material for culture should be collected; most commonly sputum, but BAL if necessary. Polymicrobial infection is common.
Typical progression of organism colonization with time is:
• Staphylococcus aureus
• Haemophilus inﬂuenzae
• Pseudomonas aeruginosa worsens lung function and CXR appearance.
Most patients with CF are chronically infected with Pseudomonas by
their early teens. Non-mucoid species colonize initially and these may
be asymptomatic or intermittent. These can be eradicated. Mucoid
species then follow and permanent eradication is rare. Decreasing the
Pseudomonas load produces clinical beneﬁt.

Other organisms
• Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Gram-negative bacteria, often with
multiple antibiotic resistance
• Burkholderia cepacia complex There are at least 10 different strains, or
genomovars, of Burkholderia cepacia. Some are associated with a worse
clinical outcome and some are not. These organisms are resistant
to many antibiotics. It is crucial that Burkholderia cepacia colonized
patients are separated from non-colonized patients, as the organism is
highly transmissible. This means separate clinics, separate spirometers,
and side rooms on a different ward are necessary. ‘Cepacia syndrome’
is the severe worsening of pulmonary infection with septicaemia,

CF PULMONARY SEPSIS: AETIOLOGY

which can be rapidly fatal. This is caused by one strain, genomovar III,
or Burkholderia cenocepacia. CF patients infected with this strain are
usually not accepted for transplant, as studies have shown they do less
well.

CHAPTER 24

Cystic ﬁbrosis

CF pulmonary sepsis antibiotics: 1
Antibiotic courses in patients with CF need to be longer and at higher
doses than in non-CF patients. The choice of antibiotics is based on clinical
response more than in vitro resistance patterns, but recent sputum culture
results will also guide therapy. If Pseudomonas has previously been isolated,
it may need to be covered in the current antibiotic regime.
• In practice, be guided by the last sputum culture result
• It is usually appropriate to give the patient the same regime they had
during their last exacerbation, provided there was a good clinical
response
• Microbiology advice should be sought if necessary.
Staphylococcus aureus A signiﬁcant pathogen causing exacerbations.
Prevention and eradication are important, even if the patient is asymptomatic. In adults, a minimum of 2 weeks of treatment should be given
when Staphylococcus aureus is cultured, with ﬂucloxacillin, erythromycin if
penicillin-resistant, tetracycline, sodium fusidate, rifampicin, or clindamycin.
There is no published evidence that long-term treatment in adults has any
additional beneﬁt.
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae When isolated (usually in young children) should
be treated with amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, second-generation cephalosporin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol (toxicity risk), even if the patient
is asymptomatic.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
• Oral antibiotics The Pseudomonas colonized patient who develops a
mild exacerbation should receive 2 weeks of an oral quinolone (such as
ciproﬂoxacin), as well as their usual nebulized colistin. There are
problems with resistance, so therefore should not be used more
frequently than every 3 months.
• IV antibiotics Should be used when oral and nebulized treatments
have failed, or patient is unwell. An aminoglycoside plus a B-lactam
are given, which have a synergistic effect when used in combination.
Treatment should be for a minimum of 10 days. Once or twice a day
aminoglycoside dosing is used in many centres (5–7 mg/kg), rather than
tds, providing high efﬁcacy and fewer toxic effects (Nicolau DP
et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1995; 39: 650–5).
Drug levels should be checked before and 1 h after the third dose, and
adjusted if necessary. Bacterial toxicity is achieved by the high peak and
safety is ensured by low trough. Renal function should also be checked
during the IV course. Local policies may vary on frequency of checking.
Some centres, especially in northern Europe, recommend that patients
with chronic Pseudomonas colonization should receive 2 weeks of IV antibiotic therapy every 3 months routinely. This policy is not widely adopted
in the UK, although, as the threshold for starting treatment is low, the
number of antibiotic courses is similar using both regimes.
• Aerosol anti-pseudomonal antibiotics Once the patient is chronically
Pseudomonas colonized, twice daily nebulized colistin is used long-term
(1–2 mega units bd in 3–4 mL saline after physiotherapy) to try and
minimize Pseudomonas levels. If colistin causes wheezing, it can either
be given in 6 mL saline or reconstituted with 3–4 mL water for injection

CF PULMONARY SEPSIS ANTIBIOTICS: 1

or salbutamol added. The nebulizer used should have a one-way valve
in the exhaust tubing and this tubing should be vented to the outside.
If colistin is not tolerated or is ineffective, aminoglycosides designed
for IV injection can be tried (e.g. gentamicin 40 or 80 mg bd, made up
with saline to 4 ml). Neither gentamicin or tobramycin are licensed for
this use. A new preservative-free form of tobramycin (TOBI) has been
developed and licensed for nebulization; it has been found in studies
to improve pulmonary function and increase weight gain. Although it
is expensive, it is becoming established in long-term management of
CF patients in the UK. Administer all via nebulizer with exhaust tubing
vented to outside as above.
• First isolate of non-mucoid Pseudomonas should be treated aggressively with 4–6 weeks of oral ciproﬂoxacin 750 mg bd and concurrent
6 weeks of nebulized colistin 1 mega unit bd. 80% of newly infected
patients have Pseudomonas eradicated by this regime. If this is not
successful, they should have IV therapy with 2 drugs and nebulized
colistin.

Satisfactory aminoglycoside levels

Blood concentration mg/L

• od regime: trough <1 mg/L and repeat in the ﬁrst week
• tds regimes:
• gentamicin/tobramycin: pre 1–2 mg/L, post 9–12 mg/L
• amikacin: pre <10 mg/L, post 28–32 mg/L
Any reports of dizziness or balance problems may suggest early ototoxicity.
This must be taken seriously as there is a cumulative dose effect. The
aminoglycoside should be stopped and ENT referral made for middle ear
testing.

CHAPTER 24

Cystic ﬁbrosis

CF pulmonary sepsis antibiotics: 2
Burkholderia cepacia is characteristically resistant to antibiotics, including
colistin and aminoglycosides. Conventional IV therapy may be effective.
Should be treated with combination of 2–3 IV antibiotics, such as ceftazidime
and an aminoglycoside. Possible synergistic combinations are chloramphenicol and minocycline, chloramphenicol and ceftazidime, or a quinolone
with a B-lactam/carbopenem. Co-trimoxazole also used.
MRSA is not more pathogenic than Staphylococcus aureus. Nebulized
vancomycin can be used for persisting sputum colonization, but IV vancomycin or teicoplanin are required for MRSA exacerbations. Oral rifampicin,
sodium fusidate, or linezolid may be beneﬁcial.
Macrolides have additional anti-inﬂammatory effects, as well as antimicrobial effects. They do not exhibit intrinsic anti-pseudomonal activity,
but there is in vitro synergy between macrolides and anti-pseudomonal
antibiotics. They also seem to improve clinical status compared with
placebo or other antibiotics. This is seen with erythromycin, but especially azithromycin, which decreases sputum viscoelasticity and affects the
bioﬁlm formed by Pseudomonas. It is administered either once daily or
three times a week, e.g. at dose of 250 mg/day with LFT monitoring, and
has been found to improve FEV1 and decrease exacerbations when used
over 6 months. Larger trials are needed to assess its long-term effects.

CHAPTER 24

Cystic ﬁbrosis

IV antibiotic administration
• If patients are unwell or if they are commencing a new antibiotic, they
should be admitted to hospital. Otherwise the majority of IV antibiotic
courses can be administered at home, after an initial assessment and
with home support from nursing staff. Many patients are relatively well
during courses of IV antibiotics and are able to continue attending
work or college, although it can take them considerable extra time to
administer the antibiotics
• Courses of IV antibiotics are often administered prophylactically before
surgery
• Most antibiotic regimes involve two weeks of IV antibiotics. This may
require the siting of an intravenous cannula with a microbiological ﬁlter
(to make it last longer), or preferably a long-line
• Many patients have an indwelling port-a-cath that can be accessed
when required
• Review patients after 1 week of treatment to ensure there is adequate
clinical progress. If there is no improvement, review microbiological
sensitivities and change treatment as appropriate.

Port-a-caths
• Inserted in patients with difﬁcult IV access, or those needing frequent
courses of IV antibiotics
• Usually accessed/needled by a trained nurse, patient, or family member.
Should be accessed only with a Huber point needle of the appropriate
length; do not use standard needles, which may damage the port
• Should be ﬂushed with 5–10 mL of 100 u/mL heparin monthly and with
5 mL of 10 U/mL heparin at the end of each IV dose
• Avoid taking blood from port-a-cath as this increases the risk of
blockage and infection. Other complications include venous
obstruction, tip dislocation, and leakage
• If port-a-cath blocks: inject 20–50 mL heparinized saline; gently
alternating between irrigation and aspiration may clear small occlusions.
Urokinase 25 000 units in 3 mL 0.9% saline instilled into port may help
a blockage
• Infected or fractured lines need removal by surgeons.

Antibiotic desensitization Antibiotic sensitivity is a major problem
in patients with CF as repeated antibiotic courses are associated with
the development of allergic reactions, especially to B-lactams. Rashes
are common, but anaphylaxis can occur. Document any drug reactions,
provide an adrenaline pre-ﬁlled syringe, and give ﬁrst doses of a new antibiotic in hospital. Desensitization regimes can be helpful and are used for
speciﬁc antibiotics that have previously caused an allergic reaction. Such
regimes need to be given at the start of the antibiotic course each time it
is used, and during the course if doses are missed for more than one day.
Give a dilute antibiotic dose over 20 min, followed by slightly stronger
concentration, and repeat for 7 concentration strengths until full antibiotic
strength is given. Takes 3–4 h. Stop infusion if any side-effects are noted.
Local policy may advise another desensatization regime.

Management of an exacerbation
Diagnose an exacerbation on 2–4 of the following:
• Increase in productive cough or dyspnoea
• Change in appearance or volume of sputum
• New signs on auscultation
• New CXR signs
• Decreased appetite
• Fall in respiratory function
• Fever
• 10% fall from baseline FEV1.

CHAPTER 24

Cystic ﬁbrosis

Other pulmonary interventions
Physiotherapy Dedicated CF physiotherapists aim to teach effective
airway clearance. This improves secretion clearance, decreases airﬂow
obstruction, and improves ventilation. Patients should do this themselves
twice daily on a long-term basis. Several techniques are used: active cycle
of breathing control (tidal volume breathing, then deep inspiration, and
passive expiration, followed by forced expiration to mobilize secretions
prior to coughing/hufﬁng), autogenic drainage, with percussion if patients
are not clearing their chest well, ﬂutter devices, and positive expiratory
pressure mask. More intensive physiotherapy is administered during exacerbations, by family and/or physiotherapist. Physiotherapists also have
important role in assessment of functional ability with exercise testing and
evaluating treatment and encouraging aerobic exercise.
Recombinant DNase (dornase alfa or pulmozyme), a nebulized mucolytic that cleaves DNA from dead neutrophils, decreasing sputum viscosity
and aiding its clearance. It is recommended in patients with an FVC >40%
predicted, to improve pulmonary function. It is used once daily 2500 U
via a speciﬁc nebulizer. It is only continued in patients who gain objective beneﬁt, with improved lung function; for example, 10% improvement
in spirometry and shuttle walk test. It is expensive and only effective in
30–40%.
Hypertonic saline Use of regular inhaled hypertonic saline has been
found to increase mucociliary transport and hence decrease exacerbations
and improve lung function. It is re-emerging as a therapeutic aid to
expectoration.
Respiratory support Respiratory failure and cor pulmonale can occur
with later stage disease. Home oxygen may be required. Nocturnal noninvasive ventilation may be necessary as a bridge to transplant if the
patient has chronic respiratory failure. If support is needed for acute deterioration related to infection with a major reversible component, this may
be non-invasive initially, but the patient may need intubation and ventilation. Such decisions should be made with the patient, their family, and their
CF consultant. These decisions can be difﬁcult and factors, such as being
on the transplant list, may be relevant.
Steroids Short oral courses seem to improve lung function, but sideeffects, such as growth impairment, osteoporosis, diabetes, and cataracts,
are signiﬁcant. They are used in ABPA, severe unresponsive exacerbations,
and occasionally in terminal care to improve the sense of well-being in a
patient.

Immunization Annual inﬂuenza, as well as pneumococcal vaccination.
Transplant The role of transplantation in patients with CF is well established. Patients should be considered for transplant when their life expectancy is less than 2 years and their quality of life is severely impaired, despite
optimal medical therapy.

OTHER PULMONARY INTERVENTIONS

• FEV1 ≤30% predicted or FEV1 >30% with rapid progressive deterioration, e.g. increasing number of admissions, rapid fall in FEV1, massive
haemoptysis
• Hypoxia (PaO2 <7.3 kPa) and hypercapnia (PaCO2 >6.7 kPa) are associated with <50% survival at 2 years without transplantation, and so are
useful guidelines, but patients should be referred for assessment on the
basis of FEV1 criteria even in the absence of severe hypoxia/hypercapnia
• Young female patients with rapid deterioration have a poor prognosis
and should be considered for early referral.
Some patients do not want a transplant and full psychosocial assessments
are necessary. Whilst on the transplant waiting list, the patient should have
optimal nutrition and physical care. Average waits are around 1 year and
some patients will inevitably die on the waiting list. Bilateral lung transplant is usually the procedure of choice. Living-donor lobar transplantation
is also performed, particularly in children and small adults. Following transplantation, the main immediate problems are infection and acute rejection.
Later, 40% of patients go on to develop bronchiolitis obliterans (see p 328).
One-year survival following transplant is around 58%.

219

220

CHAPTER 24

Cystic ﬁbrosis

Other pulmonary disease
Pneumothorax The risk of spontaneous pneumothorax increases with
age. It occurs in around 20% of male CF patients and slightly fewer females.
It is associated with a poor prognosis. It should be managed according
to the standard pneumothorax guidelines (p 381), with initial aspiration if
patient is not breathless and chest tube if this fails. The lung may take some
time to reinﬂate, and require prolonged drainage and suction. Continue
physiotherapy during this. Persistent air leak may require surgical input,
ideally with a limited procedure, such as local abrasion. Pleurodesis should
be avoided if possible in those for whom future lung transplant is an option,
as this can lead to increased bleeding when the pleura is dissected, but this
is not an absolute contraindication. Liaise with the transplant centre, as
the transplant surgeon may want to perform the pleurodesis.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (see p 466) Difﬁcult to
diagnose in CF as nearly 50% of CF patients have Aspergillus hypersensitivity with positive skin prick tests and 25% have positive precipitins.
The incidence is around 10%. Screened for annually and advised to avoid
compost heaps and hay/stables. ABPA is indicated by:
• Asthma-like symptoms with new CXR changes
• Raised IgE >500 IU/L or IgE RAST
• Eosinophilia >500/mm3 or
• Hyphae in sputum.
Treatment should be with oral steroids for 2 weeks and, if there is a
clinical improvement, these should be continued at decreasing doses for
2–3 months. Intensive physiotherapy is also an important part of the treatment regime. There is some trial evidence that antifungal agents, such as
itraconazole 200 mg bd for 4 months, should be used in addition and may
have a steroid-sparing role. Itraconazole can cause liver dysfunction, so
monitor LFTs.

Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (see p 518) Signiﬁcance is unclear
and treatment may not produce a clinical beneﬁt. Should be screened for
annually. If culture positive, repeat twice and consider 12–18-month course
of antibiotics.

CF ‘asthma’ Some CF patients have coexisting asthma and some have
asthma-like symptoms of prolonged exhalation, wheeze, and crackles due
to underlying lung inﬂammation. This is difﬁcult to diagnose, as these symptoms and a variable PEFR are found in most CF patients, due to bronchial
hyperreactivity. Occurs in 2–37% of patients. Bronchial hyperreactivity is
found in at least 40% of patients with CF. There may be bronchodilator
responsiveness, also bronchoconstriction after exercise or nebulized
hypertonic saline. Treat with the standard asthma stepwise treatment:
short-acting bronchodilator, inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting B2 agonist,
theophyllines (which may aid mucociliary clearance), leukotriene receptor
antagonist (limited evidence in CF, but may decrease eosinophilic inﬂammation), oral steroids.

OTHER PULMONARY DISEASE

Haemoptysis Small volume haemoptysis is common, especially with
concurrent infection and advanced disease. Check clotting and platelets;
consider group and save. Stop NSAIDs, give IV antibiotics, vitamin K 10 mg
od, and tranexamic acid 15–25 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses.
Massive haemoptysis (see p 43) >500 mL blood. Usually reﬂects bronchial artery bleeding and can be fatal. Needs in-patient support and
monitoring. Cross-match blood. Sit upright and give ice-cold drink to
cause pulmonary vasoconstriction. Nebulized adrenaline (5–10 mL of
1 in 10 000). Bolus dose of octreotide 50 µg over 15 min, then octreotide
infusion 400 µg in 20 mL 5% dextrose at 2.5–5 mL per h. May require bronchial artery embolization, bronchial artery ligation, or surgical resection.

221

222

CHAPTER 24

Cystic ﬁbrosis

Non-pulmonary disease
Nutritional management The maintenance of good nutrition correlates with survival. Nutrition is more problematic as respiratory disease
progresses (raised basal metabolic rate, increased work of breathing,
ongoing infection, and inﬂammation). Dietician input is crucial. High
calorie, high protein diets are encouraged. Patients may need dietary supplements or, if necessary, supplemental overnight feeding via nasogastric
tube or gastrostomy. Perform weight and body mass index measurements
at the annual review. Aim for BMI >20.
• Pancreatic enzyme supplementation to avoid high faecal fat/energy
loss. The smallest dose of pancreatin, containing lipase, required to
control steatorrhoea should be used. Typical preparations are Creon®
(contains lipase, protease, and amylase) 10 000, 25 000, or 40 000, taken
pre-meals. Typically patients take 10–20 tablets per day. The dietician
can educate patients to adjust the dosage according to the fat and
protein content of each meal. Constant re-education is often required
to optimize enzyme supplementation. High strength pancreatic enzyme
preparations have been found to be associated with the development
of colonic strictures, or ﬁbrosing colonopathy; hence maximum levels
of lipase of 10 000 units/kg/day have been recommended
• Vitamins Fat-soluble vitamins are not absorbed well in patients with
CF and these need replacement. Vitamins A, D, and E should be started
when pancreatic insufﬁciency is diagnosed and vitamin K if there is
evidence of liver disease, with prolonged prothrombin time. Vitamins
should be taken at meal times with pancreatin. Vitamin levels should be
checked at annual review
• Salt tablets in hot weather, due to excessive losses in sweat.
Gastrointestinal disease
• Distal intestinal obstructive syndrome (DIOS)/abdominal pain
(meconium ileus equivalent). Bloating, abdominal pain, possible palpable caecal mass, and complete or incomplete intestinal obstruction.
Abdominal X-ray shows empty colon and ileal distension with air-ﬂuid
levels. Occurs secondary to dehydration, or rapidly increased doses of
pancreatic enzymes. Rarely needs surgery. Medical treatment with
senna and oral acetylcysteine 200 mg tds and gastrograﬁn® 50–100 mL
tds for 5 days is usually adequate. If not, perform gastrograﬁn® enema
to determine site of obstruction. This can be therapeutic. Oral intestinal lavage with Kleen Prep® solution and up to 10 L of ﬂuid over 1–2
days can also be given. The treatment is considered to have worked
when ﬂuid is passed from the rectum and symptoms have resolved. If
not resolving, may need further imaging to rule out intussusception
• Reﬂux More common in patients with CF than the general population.
Symptoms may occur during physiotherapy, which require changes
to positioning/tipping. May require treatment with a proton pump
inhibitor to prevent development of Barrett’s oesophagus
• Pancreatitis Can occur in those patients who are pancreas-sufﬁcient.
Seen in up to 15% adults with CF. May present as severe acute
attack or chronic recurrent abdominal pain. Not usually as unwell as

NON-PULMONARY DISEASE

non-CF patients with pancreatitis. Raised amylase and abnormal USS/
CT. Treat with bowel rest, protein pump inhibitor, IV rehydration.

Liver and biliary disease
• Liver screening—cirrhosis, portal hypertension Reduced bile production
and deranged bile acid composition leads to biliary obstruction, portal
tract inﬂammation, and eventual ﬁbrosis and focal biliary cirrhosis.
Cirrhosis affects 2–25% of CF patients. Annual screening liver USS is
performed, as blood tests can be unhelpful (although ALP most sensitive).
Biopsy unhelpful as patchy disease. Established cirrhosis can lead to variceal
bleeds, so annual screening endoscopies are performed in those with
cirrhosis. Cirrhosis may need treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, portosystemic shunts, and sclerotherapy. Liver transplant may be necessary.

Metabolic disease
• CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is becoming increasingly common as the
median age of survival with CF increases. Pancreatic damage in CF (due
to ﬁbrosis) causes decreased insulin secretion. Approximately 50% of
30-year-olds will have CFRD. Presents insidiously and non-speciﬁcally,
with weight loss or fall in lung function, and not with ketoacidosis.
Screening glucose tolerance test or random/fasting glucose should be
performed annually and more frequently in those on overnight enteral
feeds or those with clinical symptoms suggestive of diabetes. Once diabetes is diagnosed, patients should not be managed on a hypoglycaemic
diet. Lower doses of insulin are usually required than in IDDM. There is
no indication for oral hypoglycaemics. Microvascular complications can
occur and annual screening for these should be performed
• Osteoporosis Several studies have conﬁrmed an increased incidence of
low bone mass in CF and increased fracture risk, particularly ribs. Risk
factors include malabsorption of vitamin D and calcium, low body mass
index, decreased physical activity, delayed puberty, steroid use, diabetes.
Treatment is with calcium and vitamin D supplements to maintain
vitamin D levels, weight-bearing exercises, hormones for delayed
puberty (ethinylestradiol or testosterone), bisphosphonates.

Other organ systems
• Arthropathy and CF vasculitis Acute or subacute arthritis occurs
in around 5% of patients with CF. It often responds to NSAIDs.
Sometimes arthritis is associated with skin lesions, such as purpura or
erythema nodosum. Up to 40% may be ANCA positive. Purpuric
vasculitis is associated with more severe lung disease
• Nasal polyps and sinusitis Nasal polyps occur in 30% and can cause
nasal obstruction. Treatment with topical or systemic steroids and
decongestants is usually not helpful and polypectomy may be required,
often more than once. Asymptomatic sinusitis is common and can
cause mucosal swelling. Consider sinus CT if problematic
• Stress incontinence occurs in both men and women, caused by
coughing. It has been recognized as an increasing problem. Pelvic ﬂoor
exercises can be taught by physiotherapists.

CHAPTER 24

Cystic ﬁbrosis

Other issues
Fertility
Women with CF are usually subfertile. When planning a pregnancy, their
physical state should be optimized with antibiotics and nutrition. The
outcome of a pregnancy is improved by optimizing and maintaining pulmonary function and weight gain during the pregnancy. Close monitoring
throughout is required. Pregnancy does not affect survival when compared
with the entire adult female CF population, but impaired pulmonary function with FEV1<60% predicted is likely to be the main predictor of worse
maternal and fetal outcome. Breast-feeding is possible, but intensiﬁes the
nutritional strain put on the mother. Most CF antibiotics are safe to use in
pregnancy, but avoid ciproﬂoxacin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and
IV colistin. Care with aminoglycoside levels.
Men are infertile due to failure of the normal development or blockage
of the vas deferens, seminal vesicle, ejaculatory duct, and body and tail of
epididymis. Testicular histology is normal and hence one option is surgical
sperm retrieval for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) into an egg,
performed by fertility clinics.

Genetic counselling and screening should be offered to patients
with CF and their partners.

Psychosocial support Trained psychologists offer personal and family
support regarding education, employment, ﬁnancial beneﬁts, burden of
treatment, and adapting to progressive disease. Pre-transplant psychological assessment is carried out, as well as terminal care and bereavement
counselling. Also treat depression, anxiety, and emotional difﬁculties, with
referral to psychiatric services if necessary. Social worker involvement to
help with beneﬁt entitlements, travel insurance, disabled car badge.

Care of the dying CF patient When all acknowledge that there are
no further treatment options, the focus of care should adjust to being palliative, with an emphasis on symptom relief, at home or in hospital.

Future developments Gene therapy. Replacing CFTR function to
prevent progressive airways disease. Work is focusing on ﬁnding a suitable
vector for delivery, such as nebulizer and airway epithelial implantation.
Progress so far has been disappointing, but work is ongoing.

CHAPTER 25

Eosinophilic lung disease

Eosinophilic lung disease
Deﬁnition Pulmonary eosinophilias are disorders classically associated
with CXR inﬁltrates and a raised blood eosinophil count, although eosinophilic inﬁltration of the lung can occur without blood eosinophilia.
• Eosinophils are phagocytes that are produced in bone marrow and
circulate for up to 10 h before localizing in tissues
• Their blood levels are usually tightly regulated
• In health they accumulate in the GI tract mucosa, but they may be
attracted to other tissues by chemoattractant mechanisms, including
mast cell activation and complement activation
• Eosinophils can survive in the tissues for weeks if appropriate cytokines
are present
• Persisting high eosinophil levels cause tissue damage, due to their
pro-inﬂammatory effects
• Eosinophils accumulate in allergic or hypersensitivity disease, parasitic
infections, and cancer
• Steroids and severe sepsis both decrease eosinophil levels
• Asthma can cause a raised eosinophil count, especially if there is
associated eczema, but an absolute eosinophil count of >1 x 109/L is
very unusual and raises the possibility of an alternative diagnosis, such
as Churg–Strauss syndrome
• Normal eosinophil counts are below 0.4 x 109/L (1–3% of peripheral
WCC)
• Counts of 0.4 x 109/L upwards can be seen in pulmonary eosinophilia.

CHAPTER 25

Eosinophilic lung disease

Causes of eosinophilic lung disease 1
Asthma and ABPA (see p 468)
• Fever or worsening asthma symptoms may be caused by type 1 and 2
hypersensitivity reactions to Aspergillus fumigatus
• Untreated can cause central bronchiectasis
• CXR shows ﬂeeting shadows
• Blood eosinophilia
• Aspergillus skin prick test is positive and serum aspergillus IgG
precipitins are positive. IgE levels are raised
• Treatment is with steroids and antifungal agents may be necessary.

Simple pulmonary eosinophilia (Löfﬂer’s syndrome)
• Caused by parasitic infection, usually Ascaris lumbricoides, but also
Strongyloides and Ankylostoma
• Occurs worldwide, especially in SE Asia, Africa, Central and South
America
• The eggs of the parasite are found in the soil and are ingested. After
10–14 days, larvae migrate from the intestine via lymph and blood to
the liver and lung. From the lung, they pass up the bronchial tree to be
swallowed, to develop into roundworms in the gut
• The passage of larvae through the lung causes an allergic reaction.
This may be asymptomatic, but may cause cough, malaise, anorexia,
rhinitis, night sweats, low-grade fever, occasional wheezing, and
dyspnoea. The illness lasts around 2 weeks
• CXR shows transient bilateral shadows that are discrete and perihilar.
They disappear usually between 6 and 12 days, but can take up to
1 month
• Sputum also contains eosinophils and larvae
• Blood eosinophilia at a low level
• Stool examination reveals parasites, but only 2–3 months later when
the adult worms are passed
• Treatment is with an antihelminth agent, such as mebendazole for
3 days or levamisole as a single dose. Steroids may be necessary if the
pulmonary manifestations are severe.

Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia
• Hypersensitivity to migrating larvae of ﬁlarial worms Wucheria bancrofti
and Brugia malayi, similar to Löfﬂer’s syndrome
• Occurs in the Indian subcontinent, SE Asia, and the South Paciﬁc islands
• Insidious onset of cough, wheeze, sputum, dyspnoea, and chest pain,
with associated fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Symptoms last for weeks
to months, with remissions and relapses
• Examination reveals crepitations
• CXR shows bilateral uniform mottling of the lung ﬁelds, especially
in the middle and lower zones. There may be cavitation and pleural
effusion
• Sputum and BAL contain eosinophils
• PFTs may be obstructive initially, but can become restrictive in
longstanding untreated cases

CAUSES OF EOSINOPHILIC LUNG DISEASE 1

• Histology shows eosinophilic bronchopneumonia and eosinophilic
abscesses
• Blood eosinophil count is raised. IgE is raised
• Filarial complement test is positive
• Treatment is with a ﬁlaricide, diethylcarbamazine, for 3 weeks. This
rapidly improves symptoms.

Drug-induced pulmonary eosinophilia
• Pulmonary shadowing develops within hours to days of starting the
drug and resolves usually within 1 week of stopping it
• It is due to an allergic reaction in the pulmonary vessel wall caused by
the drug and occurs again on drug re-challenge
• There may be an associated skin reaction
• The drug should be avoided in the future and steroids given if necessary
• Severity of illness varies, from mild to severely unwell, with cough,
dyspnoea, fever, hypoxia. May occur in those with concomitant asthma
• Tissue eosinophilia, but may not have blood eosinophilia
• Possible drugs include ampicillin, carbamazepine, chlorpropamide,
cocaine (inhaled), diclofenac, inorganic chemicals such as nickel, methotrexate, nitrofurantoin, penicillin, phenytoin, sodium aminosalicylate,
sulphonamides, tetracycline.

CHAPTER 25

Eosinophilic lung disease

Causes of eosinophilic lung disease 2
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia
• Unknown cause
• Women:men = 2:1. Occurs in middle age
• Insidious onset over weeks to months, with cough, sputum, possibly
haemoptysis, dyspnoea, recent onset asthma, weight loss, night sweats,
and high fever. Differential diagnosis includes TB
• Diagnosis is usually clinical and radiological, but may need BAL or open
lung biopsy
• CXR shows peripheral dense opacities with ill-deﬁned margins
(photographic negative of pulmonary oedema)
• CT shows peripheral air space inﬁltrates
• Sputum eosinophilia
• BAL eosinophil count high
• Blood eosinophilia may not occur. ESR is raised
• Treatment is with steroids, such as prednisolone 30–40 mg/day, and
improvement is usually rapid, with the CXR clearing within 2–3 days
and normal in 2 weeks. Decrease steroid dose once stable, but
continue for 6 months
• Relapses common when steroids stopped and they may need further
courses.

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia Unknown cause, occurs in any age
or sex. Presents with fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia.
Diagnostic criteria:
• Acute febrile illness of <5 days duration
• Hypoxic respiratory failure
• Interstitial or alveolar CXR inﬁltrates
• BAL eosinophils >25%
• No parasitic, fungal, or other infection
• Prompt and complete response to steroids
• Failure to relapse after stopping steroids.
May be unwell and hypoxic, requiring ventilatory support. No peripheral
blood eosinophilia. High-dose steroids should be given until the respiratory failure resolves and then the dose can be tapered over 2–4 weeks.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome
•
•
•
•

Unknown cause. Rare
Most common in men aged 30–40
Present with fever, weight loss, night sweats, cough, and pruritus
Diagnosis based on:
• Marked blood eosinophilia of >1.5 x 109/L for 6 months or more
• Signs and symptoms of eosinophilic tissue inﬁltration on histology
• No evidence of another cause of eosinophilia

CAUSES OF EOSINOPHILIC LUNG DISEASE 2

• Pulmonary involvement with interstitial inﬁltrates and pleural effusions
on CXR. Cardiovascular involvement also occurs, with myocarditis,
endocardial ﬁbrosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, valvular damage,
and mural thrombus formation. These may cause considerable
morbidity and mortality. Skin may be involved with urticaria and
angioedema; CNS involved with encephalopathy, arterial and venous
embolism, peripheral neuropathy, or mononeuritis multiplex; GI tract
with gastritis, nausea, diarrhoea, alcohol intolerance and hepato- or
splenomegaly; joints with effusions and Raynaud’s. Kidney and muscles
can also be inﬁltrated by eosinophils. Can be fatal
• Blood eosinophil levels may be as high as 70%. IgE levels are high
• Treatment is with high-dose steroids (e.g. 60 mg prednisolone), which
improves about 50% of cases. May need to use other immunosuppressants, such as cyclophosphamide, hydroxyurea, azathioprine, or
interferon alpha. Treatment should be tapered according to falling
eosinophil counts and end-organ improvement.

Churg–Strauss syndrome (see p 660)
• Severe asthma, blood eosinophilia, and pulmonary inﬁltrates occur as
part of a small and medium vessel vasculitis
• There may be eosinophilic tissue inﬁltration
• ANCA usually, but not always positive
• Treatment with steroids and immunosuppression.

CHAPTER 26

Extreme environments: ﬂying, altitude

Lung disease and ﬂying
Problems Flying presents problems for three reasons:
• Extra hypoxia
• Volume changes in gas compartments
• Closed environment and disease transmission
Extra hypoxia Some aeroplanes may be pressurized to the equivalent
of about 5000 ft (1500 m). This gives an atmospheric pressure of about
85 kPa and an FiO2 of about 18 kPa, compared with 21 kPa at sea level.
In normal subjects this causes inconsequential falls in PaO2 and SaO2.
However, some companies pressurize to the minimum allowed, 8000 ft
(2400 m, same as some of the lower ski resorts in Colorado), FiO2 16 kPa
(equivalent to breathing 15% O2 at sea level), and even in normal subjects
the SaO2 may fall to 90% or so. The new Airbus 380 is pressurized to only
8000 ft, but the new Boeing 787, built from largely carbon ﬁbre, will apparently allow greater pressurization and humidity levels.
Patients with lung disease and a degree of hypoxia will be nearer the
steep part of the haemoglobin dissociation curve, and will experience
bigger proportional falls in oxygen carriage by the blood. The estimated
PaO2 at 8000 ft (the lowest cabin pressurization likely to be encountered)
is estimated by the formula:
Estimated PaO2 at 8000 ft = (0.24 x PaO2 at sea level) +
(2.7 x FEV1/VC) + 3
e.g. sea level PaO2 = 8 kPa, FEV1/VC = 0.40, estimated PaO2 = 6 kPa.
This is a rough approximation, and will vary considerably from patient
to patient, particularly due to differences in hypoxic drive. An alternative
is to give the patient a hypoxic mixture to breathe for 15 min minimum
and measure the PaO2/SaO2. This is most easily achieved by feeding a 40%
Venturi mask with 100% nitrogen, which simulates a little under 8000 ft
(equivalent to 16% O2). Even this will not necessarily predict that a patient
will or will not run into trouble. Empirically, oxygen is often prescribed
if the in-ﬂight PaO2 at 8000 ft, estimated from the above equation or by
experimentation, is less than 7 kPa or 86% SaO2. This is not evidencebased, so a simple recommendation based on sea level oximetry measurements is likely to be as valid.

Simple recommendations for oxygen when ﬂying
Sea level SaO2
SaO2 >92%
SaO2 90–92%
SaO2 <90%

No oxygen required
Perform challenge test
Recommend oxygen

These are not quite the same as the BTS guidelines, which are more
complex and consider comorbidities. 2 L/min via nasal cannulae, or 28%
Venturi mask, is usually sufﬁcient to raise the SaO2 to sea level equivalent. Airlines vary as to whether they charge for this and at least a month
should be allowed to arrange it. A MEDIF form or equivalent will require

LUNG DISEASE AND FLYING

completion by the GP or specialist. Occasionally patients are allowed to
bring their own oxygen on board as hand luggage. Some airlines prohibit
using oxygen during take-off and landing.

Volume changes in gas compartments Ascent to the equivalent of
5000 ft will increase gas in trapped compartments by 20%, and ascent to
8000 ft by nearly 40%. A pneumothorax or non-communicating bullae will
therefore increase by this amount. Therefore, it is advised that patients
with current pneumothoraces should not ﬂy. In addition, it used to be
advised not to ﬂy within 6 weeks of a pneumothorax because of the
slightly higher chance of a recurrence and the lack of adequate emergency
medical treatment on board. This has recently been changed to 1 week
after full radiographic resolution or 2 weeks in the case of traumatic pneumothorax. The same arguments are applied to patients having had recent
thoracic surgery (for whatever reason) who are now advised not to ﬂy for
2 weeks after surgery. None of this is really evidence-based and the risks
of ignoring these guidelines are not known. It is probable that the risk of
a second pneumothorax within this period is only high enough to worry
about in patients with pre-existing lung disease.

Closed environment Patients with infectious diseases such as TB
should not ﬂy. There seems to be a signiﬁcant risk of infecting others.

CHAPTER 26

Extreme environments: ﬂying, altitude

Altitude sickness
Deﬁnitions of acute mountain or high altitude sickness are not precise,
but include several symptoms provoked by the hypoxia.

Pathophysiology Some of the pathophysiology is well understood
and explains some of the symptoms and signs. These largely fall into two
categories, minor and major.
Minor, due to hyperventilation provoked by the hypoxia, and include:
• Light-headedness/fatigue
• Numbness/tingling of extremities
• Nausea/vomiting and anorexia
• Headache
• Insomnia/sleep disturbance
• Periodic ventilation during sleep.
These symptoms are common, develop over 6–12 h after arrival, and affect
at least a quarter of those ﬂying to Colorado for a skiing holiday (altitude
2400–3400 m, ~10 000 ft, barometric pressure 70 kPa, inspired oxygen
tension 14.5 kPa, average SaO2 on arrival 89–90%). Most of the symptoms
are due to a respiratory hypocapnic alkalosis and resolve as the kidney
retains [H+] and excretes [HCO3–], returning pH towards normal. This
allows further hyperventilation and the rise in SaO2 helps resolve any of
the symptoms due to the hypoxia itself. This scenario tends to be common
in those with a higher hypoxic drive (measured at sea level, as it encourages greater hypocapnia and alkalosis). Confusingly, these symptoms may
also indicate the early development of the more major category.
Major, those due to the hypoxia itself. These are more serious, can develop
rapidly, and tend to occur more in those with a lower hypoxic drive. There
is also a genetic component inﬂuencing susceptibility, related to the ACE
gene. In high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) the hypoxia provokes a
non-uniform pulmonary vasoconstriction, raising pulmonary artery pressure
(PAP); hence some pulmonary capillaries are unprotected and receive the
full rise in PAP. Fluid leakage into alveoli, pulmonary oedema, and capillary damage (with pulmonary haemorrhage) produce clinically apparent
disease. The dominant symptoms/signs are:
• Extra breathlessness/cough
• Cyanosis
• Blood tinged frothy sputum
• Crackles on auscultation/raised JVP.
In high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) hypoxia also causes increased
cerebral blood ﬂow, cerebral oedema, retinal haemorrhages, cerebral
thrombosis, and petechial haemorrhages. The dominant symptoms are:
• Ataxia (may be the ﬁrst sign)
• Confusion/disorientation/hallucinations/behavioural change
• Severe headache/reduced conscious level
• Papilloedema.
Both HAPE and HACE are potentially fatal.

ALTITUDE SICKNESS

Management Risk factors are mainly the rate and degree of altitude
attained. Keep ascent to ≤300 m/day and rest every third day. The minor
form of altitude sickness is likely to resolve spontaneously over a few
days with simple symptomatic treatment, analgesics, and plenty of hydration. However, prophylaxis, or early treatment on symptom appearance,
with acetazolamide, is very effective, as are limiting further ascent and
encouraging descent. Acetazolamide provokes a mild metabolic acidosis
(by reducing [H+] availability for excretion in the distal tubule) and ‘preacclimatizes’ the subject to allow greater hyperventilation in response to
hypoxia without the usual alkalosis. It is recommended when rapid ascent
to altitudes ≥2500 m is unavoidable (such as a package ski trip to Aspen).
500 mg per day (slow release) for the 2 days prior to ascent is probably
adequate for most subjects (or as treatment after symptoms develop).
The commonest side-effect is a harmless and reversible tingling of the
extremities. Temazepam has been shown to reduce the periodic breathing
at night (by reducing the arousals that help maintain the periodicity) and
does not appear to worsen the hypoxia or reduce vigilance levels the
following day.
The best predictor of severe altitude sickness is a prior episode. It may
be possible to predict likely problems based on sea level estimates of a
poor hypoxic response, but this has not been fully validated.
The management of the more severe forms of altitude sickness that
tend to occur with rapid ascent to over 4000 m, pulmonary and cerebral
oedema, is urgent.
Management of severe altitude sickness
• Increase inspired oxygen tension by rapid descent, extra inspired
oxygen, or a local pressurized environment (e.g. a portable hyperbaric
chamber such as the Gamow bag)
HAPE
• Sit upright and keep warm
• Nifedipine (20 mg bd up to qds + loading dose, 10 mg sublingually) to
reduce PAP
• Acetazolamide may help by also reducing PAP, as well as increasing the
effective ventilatory response to altitude hypoxia
HACE
• Dexamethasone (4 mg qds + loading dose, 8 mg) to reduce cerebral
oedema.
Improvement is usually rapid once the inspiratory oxygen tension is raised.
Prophylaxis for this more severe form of altitude sickness is more controversial, but graded ascent is important, acetazolamide probably helps, and
nifedipine is used by some, particularly if there is a history of a previous
episode.

CHAPTER 26

Extreme environments: ﬂying, altitude

Diving
Problems Increased recreational diving has raised the awareness of
respiratory problems at depth. These can essentially be divided into ﬁve:
• Barotrauma, e.g. ruptured bullae and pneumothorax
• Worsening of pre-existing disorder whilst at depth, e.g. asthma
• Nitrogen gas evolved from solution in body ﬂuids
• Breath-hold diving and ascent hypoxia
• Pulmonary oedema.
Pathophysiology
Barotrauma (second commonest cause of death in SCUBA divers after
drowning) During descent, any air-containing cavity in the body will be
compressed by the rise in external pressure. If there is any communication
with the airways (e.g. middle ear, lung bullae) then gas will slowly move
into the air space. On ascent the airspace will expand and, if air cannot
escape quickly enough, may lead to rupture, of the eardrum or the bullae,
for example. A tension pneumothorax can be rapidly fatal in this situation.
Obstructive lung diseases in general can predispose to ruptured alveoli. In
addition to pneumothoraces, the escaped air can produce a pneumomediastinum, causing chest pain, and a radiolucent band (air in the pericardium) along the cardiac border on CXR. Breathing 100% O2 will clear the
air more quickly. Air emboli can also occur and produce a wide range of
symptoms; hyperbaric oxygen may be required.
Pre-existing lung disease The onset of asthma during a dive can be disastrous and may be provoked by the dry gases breathed from SCUBA gear
(self-contained underwater breathing apparatus). See BSAC recommendations
on asthma and diving (opposite). Many lung diseases, such as cystic ﬁbrosis,
COPD (FEV1 <80% predicted), ﬁbrotic lung disease, previous pneumothorax (with no pleurodesis), and lung bullae are considered contraindications to diving. However, recently, BSAC has adopted the pragmatic approach
of accepting that in individuals with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax,
who have had no pneumothorax for 5 years, the risk of pulmonary barotrauma is small and not signiﬁcantly greater than for many in the general
population, e.g. smokers. Such individuals may dive provided that a CT scan
of the chest and lung function tests (including ﬂow–volume loops) show no
reason to suggest that there is signiﬁcant residual lung disease.
The bends or caisson disease (caisson are underwater air chambers in
which people work). During periods of high pressure, extra nitrogen dissolves into the blood and other tissue ﬂuids. This takes many minutes.
On ascent this nitrogen literally bubbles off. If the amount coming out
of solution is too great, nitrogen bubbles act as emboli and limit blood
ﬂow. This produces micro-infarction with activation of inﬂammatory and
clotting cascades and damage to several organs, e.g. joints, spinal cord,
brain. Limited diving times and slow ascents reduce this problem, as do
breathing mixtures containing helium, rather than nitrogen. Severe cases
require treatment in hyperbaric chambers.
Breath-hold diving During breath-hold diving, increased pressure on the
chest elevates alveolar and arterial PO2. This extends breath-hold time,
particularly with prior hyperventilation to reduce PaCO2. During the dive,

DIVING

O2 is used and PO2 falls. On ascent, with rarefaction of the thoracic gas,
PO2 falls quickly with possible loss of consciousness and drowning.
Pulmonary oedema has been reported whilst SCUBA diving in cold water,
but the mechanism is not clear.

British Sub Aqua Club (BSAC) recommendations re asthma
• Asthma may predispose to air-trapping leading to pulmonary barotrauma
and air embolism, which may be fatal. An acute asthma attack can also
cause severe dyspnoea that may be hazardous or fatal during diving
• These theoretical risks should be explained fully to the asthmatic
diver. There is little, if any, evidence that the mild controlled,
asthmatic that follows the guidelines below is at more risk
• Asthmatics may dive if they have allergic asthma, but not if they have
cold-, exercise-, or emotion-induced asthma
• All asthmatics should be managed in accordance with British Thoracic
Society Guidelines
• Only well-controlled asthmatics may dive
• Asthmatics should not dive if needed a therapeutic bronchodilator in
the last 48 h, or have had any other chest symptoms.
Control of asthma
• The asthmatic should not need more than occasional bronchodilators, i.e. daily usage would be a disqualifying factor, but inhaled
steroids/cromoglicate/nedocromil are permissible
• During the diving season he/she should take bd peak ﬂows. A deviation
of 10% from best values should exclude diving until within 10% of
best values for at least 48 h before diving
• The medical examiner should perform an exercise test such as the
18 in (43 cm) step test for 3 min, or running outside (not a bicycle
ergometer) to increase the heart rate to 80% (210 minus age).
A decrease in PEFR of 15% at 3 min post-exercise should be taken as
evidence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and, hence, disbars.
The patient should be off all bronchodilators for 24 h before the test
• A B2 agonist may be taken pre-diving as a preventative, but not to
relieve bronchospasm at the time.

CHAPTER 27

Gastrointestinal disease and the lung

Hepatic hydrothorax and
hepatopulmonary syndrome
Hepatic hydrothorax Predominantly right-sided pleural effusion
occurring in patients with liver disease and no cardiorespiratory disease,
often with minimal ascities. The ascitic ﬂuid accumulates in the chest as a
result of diaphragmatic defects. Occurs in 5–12% of patients with cirrhosis
and portal hypertension. Spontaneous bacterial empyema can occur and is
associated with mortality of 20%. Diuretics are rarely effective. The deﬁnitive treatment is liver transplantation.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is the triad of:
• Chronic liver disease and portal hypertension
• Abnormal intrapulmonary peripheral vascular vasodilatation with
decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (right to left shunt) and
subsequent ventilation–perfusion abnormalities
• Arterial hypoxia.
It occurs in 4–29% of patients with chronic liver disease. The mechanism is
thought to be related to the release of vasoactive mediators from portal
hypertension causing altered bowel perfusion, which in turn leads to
pulmonary vascular dilatation, with the formation of vascular spider naevi
on the pleura. Patients with cirrhosis who develop hepatopulmonary syndrome have a worse prognosis.
Presentation is with progressive dyspnoea and cyanosis. Examination
reveals clubbing and telangiectasia, with associated stigmata of chronic
liver disease.
Diagnosis
• Hypoxia on blood gases <8.6 kPa on air, at rest and upright. Platypnoea
and orthodeoxia are present, that is, breathlessness and desaturation
on sitting upright, caused by preferential perfusion of basal pulmonary
vasculature. Lying ﬂat relieves this. These changes may be seen in other
lung diseases, but in the presence of liver disease is suggestive of HPS.
Hypoxia is poorly reversed with 100% oxygen, due to the pulmonary
shunting
• Contrast-enhanced echocardiogram is positive. Contrast/saline bubbles
are injected peripherally, and are normally seen only in the right heart
and are then ﬁltered by the pulmonary bed. In the presence of
intrapulmonary shunts, these are seen in the left ventricle. (Falsepositive results occur if right-to-left cardiac shunt present, which can be
excluded during echocardiogram)
• Pulmonary technetium-99 perfusion scan assesses the shunt fraction.
Normally, the radiolabelled albumin is trapped in the pulmonary
capillary bed. In the presence of intrapulmonary or cardiac shunts,
there is signiﬁcant uptake of radiolabelled albumin in the brain or
spleen. A shunt index fraction of >20% indicates severe
hepatopulmonary syndrome
• CT chest is performed to rule out other pulmonary comorbid disease

HEPATIC HYDROTHORAX AND HEPATOPULMONARY SYNDROME

Treatment
• Oxygen if PaO2 <8 kPa
• Avoid vasodilators. There is minimal evidence for pharmacological
intervention
• Mainstay of treatment is liver transplantation, which reverses the
condition. Hypoxia may take months to improve. Severe hypoxia
(PaO2 <6 kPa) is associated with increased mortality post-transplant,
as there is increased risk of hepatic ischaemia
• Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is ineffective
• Coil embolization can be tried in selected cases with AV communications.
Prognosis is poor, with a mortality of 40% in 2.5 years.

CHAPTER 27

Gastrointestinal disease and the lung

Portopulmonary hypertension
Portopulmonary hypertension (POPH) is pulmonary artery
hypertension occurring in association with portal hypertension. It occurs
in an estimated 2–5% of patients with cirrhosis and is present in around
16% of those referred for liver transplant. The mechanism is unclear,
but probably relates to a hyperdynamic circulation, high cardiac output,
cytokine release, and possible pulmonary emboli.
Deﬁned as:
• Elevated pulmonary artery pressure (>25 mmHg at rest, >30 mmHg
during exercise)
• Increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to pulmonary vasoconstriction and obliterative vascular remodelling (>120 dyn/s/cm5)
• Abnormal left ventricular end diastolic/wedge pressure (<15 mmHg)
• In the setting of portal hypertension (portal pressure >10 mmHg).
Presentation Dyspnoea on exertion, possibly syncope, chest pain, fatigue,
palpitations, haemoptysis, and orthopnoea. There may be signs of volume
overload with raised JVP and pedal oedema. P2 may be loud, with pulmonary and tricuspid regurgitation, as well as stigmata of chronic liver
disease. It is usually diagnosed 4–7 years after the diagnosis of portal
hypertension.
Diagnosis
• Hypoxia on blood gases, but less so than in hepatopulmonary syndrome
• CXR may be normal or show prominent pulmonary arteries and
enlarged right heart
• ECG shows RVH, RBBB, RAD, and sinus tachycardia
• kCO may be decreased
• Echocardiography is the main screening test and is diagnostic if the right
ventricular pressure is >50 mmHg
• Exclude other causes of pulmonary hypertension
• Right heart catheterization with vasodilator studies is performed
• The changes in the vessels in POPH are the same histologically as those
seen in IPAH (see p 388).
Treatment Options are the same as for patients with IPAH, with vasodilators, prostacyclin, and endothelin antagonists (see p 394). Avoid B-blockers,
so manage varices with banding. Anticoagulation is not advised due to
the risk of variceal bleeding. LTOT if PaO2 <8 kPa. Liver transplantation
may reverse mild to moderate POPH, although symptoms may take
weeks to months to resolve. Severe POPH is not reversed and is associated with signiﬁcant intra- and post-operative morbidity and mortality.
A few cases of heart–lung–liver transplants have been reported.
Prognosis is poor in severe POPH, with a median survival after diagnosis of
6 months, without transplant.

CHAPTER 27

Gastrointestinal disease and the lung

Inﬂammatory bowel disease, coeliac
disease, and pancreatitis
Inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) Pulmonary involvement tends
to occur after the onset of the IBD, but can predate it. Pulmonary involvement is found in up to a quarter of patients, but this is usually subclinical.
Patients can develop a variety of clinical syndromes, including airway
inﬂammation, subglottic stenosis, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and
chronic bronchiolitis. Bronchoscopy may reveal inﬂammatory tissue within
the large airway walls, which on biopsy shows mucosal ulceration, basal cell
hyperplasia, basement membrane thickening, and submucosal inﬂammatory
cell inﬁltration. IBD is also associated with the development of interstitial
lung disease, such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), pulmonary
inﬁltrates with eosinophilia, or neutrophilic necrotic parenchymal nodules.
Pulmonary involvement tends to be steroid-responsive. Inhaled steroids
can be tried for chronic bronchitis, but oral or intravenous steroids
may be required for worsening lung involvement. Note that drugs used
in the treatment of IBD may also cause lung disease, such as sulfasalazine
(alveolitis), mesalazine, or inﬂiximab (both: pulmonary inﬁltrates and
eosinophilia; inﬂiximab: reactivation of latent TB).
Ulcerative colitis Pulmonary involvement is usually asymptomatic or may
be associated with dry cough. Minimal interstitial change may be suggested
by abnormal pulmonary function tests. Restrictive, obstructive, or reduced
kCO defects may be seen. Usually normal CXR and CT. No speciﬁc treatment indicated.
Crohn’s disease Pulmonary involvement less common than in ulcerative
colitis, but similar changes found.
Coeliac disease May be associated with idiopathic lung ﬁbrosis, causing
restrictive defect. Also may be at increased risk of asthma, bird fancier’s
lung, and haemosiderosis. Increased risk of lymphoma and malignancy in
GI tract.

Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is frequently associated with exudative
pleural effusion. Raised amylase in the pleural ﬂuid is suggestive (see p 55).
Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may develop, which requires
supportive care and mechanical ventilation (see p 101).

CHAPTER 28

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis

Causes
Deﬁnition Group of lung diseases caused by inhalation of organic antigen
to which the individual has been previously sensitized. Hypersensitivity
pneumonitis (HP; previously termed extrinsic allergic alveolitis) is often
divided into ‘acute’ and ‘chronic’ forms based on the time-course of presentation. Acute HP often follows a short period of exposure to a high
concentration of antigen, and is usually reversible. Chronic HP typically
follows a period of chronic exposure to a low antigen dose and is less
reversible. These two presentations may overlap and ‘subacute’ forms of
the disease are recognized.
Epidemiology Exact prevalence unknown. At least 8% of budgerigar and
pigeon keepers and up to 5% of farmers may develop HP. Hypersensitivity
pneumonitis is thought to be more common in non-smokers (mechanism
unclear; may reﬂect inhibition of alveolar macrophage function by smoke).
Causes Many different antigens have been reported to cause HP, ranging
from the relatively common (bird-fancier’s lung and farmer’s lung in the
UK; summer-house HP in Japan) to the more unusual and exotic (shell
lung—proteins on mollusc shells; pituitary snuff-taker’s disease; sericulturist’s lung—silk worm larvae proteins; sax lung—yeast on saxophone
mouthpieces). Important examples are listed in Table 28.1.

CAUSES

Pathophysiology Pathogenesis of HP is not fully understood, and may
involve T-cell mediated immunity and granuloma formation (type IV hypersensitivity) and/or antibody–antigen immune complex formation (type
III hypersensitivity). It is not an atopic disease, and is not characterized
by a rise in tissue eosinophils or IgE (type I hypersensitivity); this may, in
part, be due to the small particle size of offending antigens, which tend
to be deposited more distally in the air-spaces than the larger particles
associated with asthma. Lung histology specimens typically reveal an interstitial inﬂammatory inﬁltrate, often with accompanying bronchiolitis and
organizing pneumonia. Non-caseating granulomata are often present, and
typically are ill-deﬁned and single (cf. sarcoidosis, where granulomata are
well-deﬁned and are grouped subpleurally or near bronchi). Chronic HP
is characterized by ﬁbrosis, and often the absence of granulomata and
airways involvement, particularly if antigen exposure has ceased.

CHAPTER 28

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis

Diagnosis
Clinical features
Acute HP
• Breathlessness, dry cough, and systemic symptoms (fever, chills,
arthralgia, myalgia, headache) occur 4–8 h after exposure to antigen
• Examination: crackles and squeaks on auscultation, fever
• In the absence of ongoing exposure, symptoms settle spontaneously
within 1–3 days. Episodes may be recurrent.
Chronic HP
• Progressive exertional breathlessness, dry cough, sometimes systemic
symptoms (weight loss) over the course of months–years. May be
history of acute episodes
• Examination: crackles and squeaks on auscultation, clubbing rare, may
be features of cor pulmonale.

Investigations
• Imaging: acute HP
• CXR Diffuse small (1–3 mm) nodules or inﬁltrates, sometimes
ground glass change, apical sparing. Normal in up to 20% of cases
• HRCT Patchy ground-glass change and poorly deﬁned nodules. Areas
of increased lucency (enhanced on expiratory HRCT) occur due to
air trapping from bronchiolar involvement
• Both CXR and HRCT appearances may quickly normalize following
removal from antigen exposure
• Imaging: chronic HP
• CXR Typically upper- and mid-zone reticulation
• HRCT Diffuse well-deﬁned centrilobular nodules, ground-glass
change, increased lucency from air trapping. May mimic IPF
• PFTs Typically restrictive pattern with reduced gas transfer and lung
volumes; mild obstruction is also sometimes observed. Hypoxia may
occur
• Bloods Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis associated with neutrophilia
but not eosinophilia. Inﬂammatory markers often increased
• Serum antibody (IgG) precipitin results are presented either as an
ELISA or as a number of precipitin lines, referring to the number of
different epitopes an individual responds to. Precipitins to organic
antigens are found in 90% of patients, but are also present in up to 10%
of asymptomatic farmers and 50% of pigeon breeders. Precipitin levels
often fall in the absence of ongoing antigen exposure
• BAL lymphocytosis (>40% of cells) is a typical ﬁnding, but not in itself
diagnostic
• Transbronchial or surgical lung biopsy may be required in cases of
diagnostic uncertainty. TBB may provide insufﬁcient tissue for
adequate histological analysis
• Inhalation antigen challenge may be unpleasant, and is not
recommended routinely

DIAGNOSIS

Diagnosis is based on the combination of history of antigen exposure
and typical clinical and HRCT features. The most diagnostically useful
clinical features are an onset of symptoms 4–8 h after exposure, a history
of recurrent episodes of symptoms, the presence of weight loss, and the
ﬁnding of crackles on examination. An absence of serum precipitins is very
unusual but described. Atypical presentations require further investigation to support the diagnosis, such as BAL lymphocytosis or characteristic
histological features on lung biopsy.
Differential diagnosis
Atypical pneumonia
Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (particularly IPF and COP)
Sarcoidosis
Vasculitis
Occupational asthma (e.g. from isocyanates)
Drug-induced lung disease (including pesticides)
Organic dust toxic syndrome (follows very high levels of exposure to
agricultural dusts, symptoms transient, benign course)
• Silo-ﬁller’s disease (variable respiratory manifestations following
exposure to nitrogen dioxide in silos; ranges from mild bronchitis to
fatal bronchospasm)

CHAPTER 28

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis

Management
Management centres on antigen avoidance, which is frequently difﬁcult.
If complete removal from antigen is unrealistic (e.g. farmers), measures to
reduce exposure may be of beneﬁt (such as respiratory protection with
high performance, positive pressure masks; avoidance of particularly heavy
exposure; improved ventilation and use of air ﬁlters; drying of hay prior
to storage).
In acute HP, symptoms typically resolve following cessation of antigen
exposure and treatment is usually not required. Removal from exposure
may also result in symptomatic and physiological improvement in chronic
HP, although this is less certain and established pulmonary ﬁbrosis is often
irreversible.
When treatment is required, corticosteroids are frequently used
although there is a lack of randomized controlled evidence to support
this. Steroids may hasten the resolution of impaired pulmonary function in
acute HP, although their effect on long-term outcome is unclear. A typical
regimen is prednisolone 40–60 mg daily for up to a month, and then slowly
reduce dose over several months. Inhaled steroids have not been studied
in detail, although may be of some beneﬁt.
Prognosis Highly variable. Prognosis is usually excellent following
removal from antigen exposure in acute HP, although progression to respiratory failure and death may very rarely occur after short-term exposures
of very high intensity. Recurrent episodes of acute HP do not necessarily
progress to chronic HP and ﬁbrosis, and chronic HP may develop in the
absence of previous acute HP episodes. Development of chronic HP
with ongoing exposure may eventually lead to cor pulmonale and death,
although again this is variable and many patients do not exhibit disease
progression despite chronic exposure. Persistent low-dose exposure (e.g.
budgerigar in the house) may be more likely to progress to the chronic
ﬁbrotic form of HP than intermittent high-dose exposure (e.g. pigeon
fanciers), which predisposes more to episodes of acute HP.

Hyperventilation
syndrome

255

256

CHAPTER 29

Hyperventilation syndrome

Deﬁnition Poorly deﬁned, and the term is falling into disfavour, dysfunctional breathing being the alternative. Most respiratory physicians still use
hyperventilation syndrome to describe breathlessness and over-breathing
associated with fear, stress, and anxiety, in the absence of any demonstrable physiological abnormality.
Usually part of a spectrum of physical symptoms (e.g. chest pain,
palpitations/tachycardia, fatigue, dizziness, parasthesiae, headache, diarrhoea,
inappropriate sweating, etc.) from an anxiety or panic disorder. Other
specialties may have been consulted due to the mixed symptomatology.

Pathophysiology Hyperventilation syndrome can occur de novo, or
follow a respiratory disorder that has resolved—such as an attack of mild
asthma. It appears to be based on a heightened awareness of breathing, and
concerns as to what the shortness of breath signiﬁes. The PaCO2 is intermittently low, with a respiratory alkalosis. Recordings of breathing pattern
often show a rather chaotic pattern.

Clinical features
• Intermittent episodes of breathlessness largely unrelated to exercise,
although can be worsened by exercise
• May be associated with symptoms of respiratory alkalosis, such as
numbness, tingling of the extremities, feelings of impending doom, and
light-headedness, occasionally to the point of losing consciousness
(cerebral vasoconstriction due to the hypocapnia)
• Sensation of not being able to take a satisfactory breath
• No history suggestive of an alternative current respiratory disorder,
although there may have been one previously
• History of some stressful situation in the patient’s life
• Previous episodes.

Diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion, but with additional conﬁrmatory ﬁndings.
• No evidence of a cardiac cause for the breathlessness
• No evidence of a respiratory cause, i.e. normal lung function, normal
CXR, and normal SaO2 at rest and on exercise to the point of breathlessness (SaO2 may even rise on exercise)
• Irregular breathing pattern at rest and on exercise
• No evidence of pulmonary hypertension
• No evidence to support pulmonary emboli
• No evidence of hyperthyroidism
• Low PaCO2, raised pH, on blood gases (and a normal A–a gradient)
• No metabolic acidosis on blood gases (e.g. ketoacidosis, lactacidosis)
• Unresolved psychological issues, or social phobia/agoraphobia.

HYPERVENTILATION SYNDROME

Differential diagnosis Important pathological causes to exclude are:
• Subtle interstitial lung disease with a normal CXR: consider HRCT
• Mild asthma with normal basic PFTs: consider PEFR monitoring, exercise provocation, or bronchial reactivity testing
• Pulmonary hypertension/thromboembolic disease: consider cardiac
echo or CTPA
• Hyperthyroidism
• Unexpected acidosis: e.g. renal failure, lactacidosis, ketoacidosis.

Management It is important not to dismiss the patient’s symptoms,
implying it is ‘all in the mind’. The patient has a real symptom, which
requires a real explanation. There are no controlled trials of management,
but most clinicians will offer an explanation based on an ‘over-awareness’
of respiratory sensations, heightened by anxiety. It is important to explain
that the associated symptoms of tingling and light-headedness are well
recognized and harmless.
Old recommendations to rebreathe into a paper bag have not stood
the test of time and are rather impractical in the middle of a supermarket.
Because cold peripheries often accompany an episode (vasoconstriction),
placing the cold palms on to the cheeks can help suppress the desire to
breathe, thought to be related to the diving reﬂex: again, this is an untested
remedy.
Careful explanation may be enough. A short period on an anxiolytic
(e.g. diazepam 2–5 mg bd) may be helpful, to demonstrate that the symptoms can be controlled. Management of the psychological problem may be
possible. Some experienced respiratory physiotherapists can help patients
control their symptoms and divert the anxiety away from breathing.
Failure to respond should always prompt a reconsideration of whether
an underlying disorder is gradually progressing to the point where an investigation becomes abnormal. On the other hand, repeated investigations will
conﬁrm the patient’s concern that 'the doctors think there is something
wrong.’
Prognosis Some patients improve quickly with explanation. Some tend
to relapse at times of stress. Some prove resistant to any treatment and
probably should be seen in the clinic regularly, but infrequently, to reduce
their likelihood of involving other medical services with another pointless
round of investigations.

CHAPTER 30

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias

Overview
Deﬁnition The IIPs comprise a group of diffuse lung diseases of
unknown aetiology that primarily involve the pulmonary interstitium—
the area between the alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium, as
well as the septal and bronchovascular tissues that make up the ﬁbrous
framework of the lung. These primarily interstitial processes, however,
also frequently involve the airways, vasculature, and alveolar airspaces. The
underlying pathological process is one of varying degrees of inﬂammation
and ﬁbrosis.
The terminology used to describe the IIPs may be confusing; these
conditions have been subject to much reclassiﬁcation, reﬂecting the lack
of understanding of their underlying aetiology and pathogenesis. Idiopathic
pulmonary ﬁbrosis (IPF; previously termed cryptogenic ﬁbrosing alveolitis)
is the commonest IIP and is characterized by the histological pattern of
usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). The other IIPs are distinct disease entities and are all rare. They all represent a subgroup of interstitial (or diffuse
parenchymal) lung diseases.
Diagnosis Made from a combination of clinical, HRCT, and histological
features—distinguish from other causes of diffuse lung disease (see
Chapter 6). Histological patterns are the most speciﬁc and form the basis
for the current classiﬁcation of IIPs. Surgical lung biopsy is recommended
for most cases of suspected IIP with the exception of patients exhibiting
typical clinical and HRCT features of IPF. Transbronchial biopsies have
a very limited role due to the generally patchy distribution of the IIPs,
although they may be useful in the diagnosis of acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP) and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), as well as the
exclusion of other causes of diffuse lung disease (e.g. sarcoidosis).

Treatment The optimal treatment of many of the IIPs is poorly established, and there is a lack of supportive data from randomized controlled
trials. Steroids and immunosuppression are the mainstay of treatment, but
these are often ineffective and have signiﬁcant side-effects. Treatment may
alter both the HRCT and histological pictures, and if possible should be
delayed until a diagnosis has been made.
The conditions currently included within the classiﬁcation of idiopathic
interstitial pneumonias, together with their key clinical, imaging, and histological features and prognosis, are presented in Table 30.1 opposite and
discussed in detail in the remainder of this chapter. They are listed in order
of frequency.

lung. This occurs as different areas of lung are in varying stages of evolution of the pathological process. The histological appearance of idiopathic
pulmonary ﬁbrosis (previously known as cryptogenic ﬁbrosing alveolitis) is
usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).

Epidemiology Prevalence ﬁgures vary from 6 to 14/100 000, although
prevalence may be 175/100 000 in patients >75 years old. Slightly more
common in males. Mean age at presentation 67. Familial form well
described, but very rare.
Causes and pathophysiology The development of ﬁbrosis was previously thought to reﬂect a response to chronic inﬂammation resulting from
an unknown initial injury. This key role of inﬂammation in the pathogenesis
of IPF has been questioned, however, based partly on the observations
that inﬂammation is not a major feature of pathological specimens, and
that responses to ‘anti-inﬂammatory’ treatment with steroids are often
poor. An alternative theory is that repeated alveolar epithelial injury leads
directly to wound healing and ﬁbrosis, and this concept of ‘ﬁbrosis without
inﬂammation’ has been demonstrated both in animal models and other
human diseases. The nature of the lung injury remains obscure: postulated
triggers include inhalation of metal dust and wood dust, smoking, or exposure to the Epstein–Barr virus. Cytokine production (e.g. plasminogen activator inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinases, transforming growth factor B)
by alveolar epithelial cells may play an important role in the development
of ﬁbrosis. Host genetic factors are also likely to be important in modifying the wound-healing response.

Clinical features
• Typically presents with gradual onset exertional breathlessness and
cough; average of 9 months of symptoms prior to presentation
• 5% of patients are said to be asymptomatic, although this is likely to be
an underestimate
• Arthralgia occurs in about 20%
• Fine basal late inspiratory crackles
• Clubbing in up to 50%
• Cyanosis and cor pulmonale in severe disease.

Investigations
• Blood tests Raised ESR and CRP and mild anaemia may occur; positive
rheumatoid factor and/or ANA may occur at low titres in the absence
of associated connective tissue disease
• PFTs Typically restrictive pattern with reduced vital capacity and
transfer factor; smokers may exhibit coexisting obstructive defect.
Oxygen saturations are frequently reduced, particularly on exertion;
ABGs may demonstrate type I respiratory failure

IPF: DIAGNOSIS

• CXR Peripheral and basal reticular shadowing, may extend to other
zones, sometimes with honeycombing; rarely may be normal
• HRCT features include bilateral, peripheral, and subpleural reticulation,
with honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis, architectural distortion,
and minimal or no ground-glass change. Predominantly basal initially,
more extensive later in disease course. Extent of disease on CT correlates with physiological impairment. Predominant ground-glass appearance suggests an IIP other than IPF—consider lung biopsy
• BAL is not routinely required and is rarely helpful. Typically shows neutrophilia, sometimes mild eosinophilia. Marked eosinophilia (>20%) or
lymphocytosis (>50%) should raise possibility of alternative diagnosis
• Lung biopsy (via VATS or thoracotomy) if there is diagnostic doubt
• Gallium and DTPA scanning are seldom of use in clinical practice.

Histology Usual interstitial pneumonia, a ﬁbrosing pattern characterized by temporal and spatial heterogeneity: patches of active ﬁbroblastic
foci (reﬂecting acute injury) are interspersed with honeycombing/architectural distortion (reﬂecting chronic scarring) and areas of normal lung,
reﬂecting varying stages of evolution of the disease process in different
areas of lung. Interstitial inﬂammation is minimal. Signiﬁcant inter-observer
disagreement between expert pathologists regarding the presence of a
UIP pattern on lung biopsy has been reported, however, and an overall
diagnosis taking into account clinical, radiological and histological features
is recommended.
Diagnosis can be conﬁdently made in most cases on the basis of clinical
and HRCT ﬁndings. Lung biopsy is not generally required in patients with
typical clinical and HRCT features of IPF, but should be considered in the
presence of unusual features (e.g. predominant ground glass/nodules/
consolidation/upper lobe involvement on HRCT, or young patient). When
required, biopsies should be obtained at VATS or thoracotomy; transbronchial biopsies provide smaller samples, which rarely give diagnostic information due to the patchy distribution of disease.
Differential diagnosis
• Left ventricular failure (a common clinical misdiagnosis in IPF, and
patients are often prescribed inappropriate diuretics)
• Asbestosis (may mimic clinically and radiologically; occupational history
and presence of pleural plaques may suggest this diagnosis)
• Connective tissue disease (may mimic clinically and radiologically, and
precede extrapulmonary manifestations of disease)
• Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (suggested by typically upper/
mid-zone predominance, micronodules, ground glass, areas of reduced
attenuation)
• Drug-induced lung disease.

CHAPTER 30

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias

IPF: management 1
Treatment choices are hindered by a lack of large well-conducted placebocontrolled trials. There is currently no evidence that any drug treatment
improves survival or quality of life. Drugs should not be used routinely,
but may be considered in a closely observed trial of therapy. They may be
of beneﬁt in patients with other IIPs misdiagnosed as IPF. Drug treatments
include:
• Oral corticosteroids Prior to the reclassiﬁcation of IIPs, studies
suggested that corticosteroids may improve lung function (in around
20–30% of patients) and symptoms (in around 50%). However, these
studies probably included patients with conditions other than IPF
that are associated with a better treatment response and prognosis
(e.g. NSIP). Signiﬁcant side-effects may affect at least a quarter of
patients (e.g. hyperglycaemia necessitating insulin, osteoporosis,
myopathy, peptic ulcer disease, cataracts, raised intraocular pressure,
psychosis). Consider routine septrin prophylaxis (960 mg 3 times/week)
against PCP
• Azathioprine in combination with prednisolone may improve survival
compared with prednisolone alone; again this may reﬂect studies
undertaken on individuals with IIPs other than IPF. Side-effects appear
to be uncommon. Use of azathioprine alone has not been investigated
• Cyclophosphamide does not appear to improve survival and sideeffects are common
• Colchicine appears to have a comparable effect to prednisolone and
may be better tolerated
• Penicillamine and ciclosporin have not been studied in detail.

Management protocol The following recommendations are adapted
from the BTS guidelines. In all cases they should be considered in the
context of the individual patient’s clinical condition, comorbidity, and wishes,
particularly in view of the often unpredictable disease course, unknown
efﬁcacy of treatment, and high frequency of serious side-effects.

Initial assessment and decision to treat On presentation, all
patients should have full clinical assessment, pulmonary function tests,
and HRCT chest. In general, decisions regarding treatment are based
on severity and rate of progression of symptoms, changes in pulmonary
function, and HRCT appearance. Predominant ground-glass appearance
on HRCT suggests an IIP other than IPF, and may be associated with
steroid responsiveness—consider lung biopsy prior to starting treatment.
Predominantly reticular patterns are usually less steroid-responsive.

Indications for trial of treatment
• Severe or rapidly progressive symptoms
• Predominantly ground-glass appearance on HRCT (consider biopsy)
• Consider in the context of a reticular pattern on HRCT if lung function signiﬁcantly impaired or patient requests treatment.

IPF: MANAGEMENT 1

If mild/moderate symptoms or a long history, and without predominant
ground glass on HRCT (i.e. a reticular/mixed pattern), consider withholding
treatment and follow-up within 3 months. If stable on follow-up, review
3-monthly for at least 1 year and regularly thereafter; consider trial of
treatment if lung function deteriorates or symptoms worsen.

Monitoring Disease progression and response to treatment are best
assessed by serial measurements of VC and TLCO; document them at
each clinic attendance. Changes in VC or TLCO of 10–15% or more are
considered signiﬁcant in terms of assessing treatment response or disease
progression. Changes in symptoms such as exercise tolerance and cough
frequency/severity may also be useful.
Recommended treatment Oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg) is the
mainstay of treatment. Consider IV methylprednisolone in very ill patients.
Reassess lung function after 1 month (some recommend treating for a longer
period before response to therapy is formerly assessed, e.g. 3–6 months):
• Improvement (increase in VC or TLCO by 10–15% or more) or stable:
slowly reduce prednisolone dose (e.g. reduce by 5 mg weekly to
20 mg and review—if no worse, reduce by 5 mg a month to maintenance dose of 10 mg and continue at 10 mg for 1 year, and consider
further reduction after this). Consider combination treatment with
azathioprine (regimens vary; an example is initial daily dose of 50 mg
for 4 weeks, then increase by 50 mg each week to maximum of
2–3 mg/kg, although do not exceed 150 mg daily; check WCC weekly
until established on maximum dose for 2 weeks, then check WCC and
LFTs every 6–8 weeks). Azathioprine is used less frequently in patients
with a predominantly ground-glass HRCT appearance, who may be
treated with prednisolone alone
• Deterioration (decrease in VC or TLCO by 10–15% or more): quickly
reduce prednisolone dose (e.g. reduce by 10 mg weekly to 10 mg
daily, and more slowly after this). Supportive treatment (see below).
Consider lung transplant referral.

Patients who are unable to tolerate treatment
• Consider trial of azathioprine alone if prednisolone is not tolerated
• Colchicine may be tried as an alternative to prednisolone alone.

CHAPTER 30

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias

IPF: management 2
Supportive treatment Consider use of home oxygen if very limited
by breathlessness and in respiratory failure. Use of oxygen during exercise may improve exercise tolerance. Encourage pulmonary rehabilitation
programme, if no contraindications. Cough may be troublesome; consider
oral codeine. Opioids are frequently required for palliation of severe
breathlessness.
Lung transplantation Patients with IPF are often referred for consideration of transplantation too late and most die whilst on the waiting list
(which is around 12 months in the UK). Single lung transplant in IPF leads
to an 80% survival at 1 year and 55% at 3 years. Guidelines recommend
referral of all suitable patients with histological or radiographic evidence
of UIP, irrespective of vital capacity and without delaying for trials of treatment. These are not widely applied in the UK, and, in practice, referral is
often considered following failure of ﬁrst-line treatment in symptomatic
patients aged <65 years, with TLCO <40% predicted, fall in FVC ≥10% over
6 months, oxygen desaturation <88% on 6-min walk, and/or honeycombing
on HRCT.

Causes of acute deterioration in patients with previously
stable IPF
• Accelerated decline of IPF—an important cause of death in even
mild–moderate, apparently stable IPF; mechanism poorly understood;
biopsy often shows diffuse alveolar damage
• Pneumothorax—collapsed lung is often relatively resistant to
re-expansion, making treatment difﬁcult
• Infection (especially if immunocompromised), e.g. PCP
• Pulmonary embolism
• Acute deterioration may also occur post-operatively following major
surgery, e.g. cardiac or orthopaedic—the reasons behind this are
unclear.

Prognosis is variable: some decline rapidly, others remain stable or
decline slowly over years. Several studies have demonstrated a median
survival of 2.5–3.5 years, although prognosis is difﬁcult to predict for individual patients. One study has shown oxygen desaturation <88% during
6-min walk, whilst breathing air is associated with 35% 4-year survival
(compared with 69% in patients who do not desaturate below this level).
More extensive ﬁbroblastic foci on lung biopsy have also been shown to
correlate with shorter survival. Death is commonly due to respiratory
failure and/or infection. Risk of developing lung cancer is increased.

Future developments Therapeutic agents currently under evaluation
include:
• Pirfenidone (antiﬁbrotic, inhibits collagen synthesis and reduces
ﬁbroblast proliferation). No improvement in primary end-point
(desaturation during 6-min walk) compared with placebo, although
possible beneﬁt in secondary end-points (vital capacity and prevention
of acute exacerbation of IPF).

IPF: MANAGEMENT 2

• Interferon G-1b (antiﬁbrotic, inhibits ﬁbroblast proliferation and
down-regulates transforming growth factor B). A large study of IPF
patients unresponsive to corticosteroids showed no difference from
placebo in disease progression or functional deterioration, and a trend
towards improved survival with interferon G-1b (particularly in the
mild-to-moderate disease group with FVC>62% predicted). A further
larger study (INSPIRE) is ongoing.
• Anticoagulation A placebo-controlled study suggested a possible
survival beneﬁt from anticoagulation in addition to prednisolone,
particularly following acute exacerbations of IPF, but the study was
small, open label, and with differential drop-out between groups;
further studies needed
• Oral co-trimoxazole as a disease-modifying agent; pilot studies have
been promising
• Oral N-acetylcysteine (an antioxidant, increases lung glutathione levels)
at a high dose (600 mg tds) in combination with prednisolone and azathioprine appears to confer a small improvement in lung function when
compared with prednisolone and azathioprine alone (no effect on
mortality). The combination of prednisolone and azathioprine has not
in itself been compared with placebo, however-they may be more toxic,
and so this ‘triple combination’ cannot be recommended at present
• Bosentan (endothelin receptor 1 antagonist). Studies are ongoing
• Etanercept (TNF-A blockade). Studies are ongoing
• Imatinib (PDGF receptor antagonist and c-Abl tyrosine kinase
inhibitor). Studies are ongoing
• Sirolimus (or rapamycin, a macrolide and immunosuppressant).
Studies are ongoing.

CHAPTER 30

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias

Non-speciﬁc interstitial
pneumonia (NSIP)
Deﬁnition The term NSIP is a description of a histological pattern
rather than a speciﬁc clinical entity. This form of IIP is poorly understood,
and may be subject to further reclassiﬁcation in the near future. Patients
with NSIP on lung biopsy have a generally better prognosis and greater
response to steroids when compared with patients with IPF. NSIP may be
idiopathic or occur in association with other systemic conditions, most
notably connective tissue diseases.

Epidemiology Typically affects younger patients than IPF, with age of
onset 40–50 years. May rarely affect children.

Causes/associations
• Idiopathic
• Connective tissue disease (NSIP may be the ﬁrst manifestation of
disease)
• Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
• Drugs
• Infection
• Immunodeﬁciency (including HIV, post bone marrow transplant,
chemotherapy)

Clinical features There are few speciﬁc clinical features that help
distinguish NSIP from other IIPs. Described features include:
• Breathlessness, cough
• Weight loss is common
• Onset gradual or subacute, typical symptom duration before diagnosis
varies 0.5–3 years
• Crackles at lung bases, later more extensive
• Clubbing in a small proportion of patients

Investigations
• HRCT frequently shows diffuse symmetrical ground-glass change, with
or without reticulation and traction bronchiectasis. The conﬂuent and
homogeneous appearance contrasts with the patchy heterogeneous
distribution seen in IPF. Honeycombing is rare
• PFTs typically restrictive pattern, but impaired gas transfer in only 50%.
Desaturation on exertion is common
• BAL lymphocytosis common
• Lung biopsy
• Investigations to exclude underlying disease (see above)

Histology Variable, ranging from a predominantly ‘cellular’ pattern
(mild–moderate interstitial inﬂammation, no ﬁbrosis) to a ‘ﬁbrotic’ pattern
(interstitial ﬁbrosis, more homogeneous appearance than in UIP and lack
of ﬁbroblastic foci or honeycombing, lung architecture may be relatively
preserved). NSIP may be subclassiﬁed based on the relative proportions

NON-SPECIFIC INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIA

of inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis: NSIP 1 (primarily inﬂammation), NSIP 2
(inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis), and NSIP 3 (primarily ﬁbrosis). Features of
both NSIP and UIP are sometimes seen on biopsies from the same individual—in such cases, the diagnosis is considered to be IPF (indicating a
poor prognosis).

Diagnosis Clinical and HRCT features are non-speciﬁc and surgical
lung biopsy is required for diagnosis. Consider the presence of associated
diseases (see list above).
Management Treatment is with corticosteroids (see p 265 for example
of protocol). Additional immunosuppressive treatments may be considered
in patients who fail to respond to corticosteroids alone (see p 265).
Prognosis Variable. Most patients improve or remain stable on treatment. ‘Cellular’ pattern on biopsy is associated with a good prognosis.
Disease progression to death occurs, but is unusual.

CHAPTER 30

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias

Cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia (COP)
(formerly bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, BOOP)

Deﬁnition Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) is a disease of
unknown cause characterized by ‘plugging’ of alveolar spaces with granulation tissue that may also extend up into the bronchioles. In addition to the
‘cryptogenic’ form, organizing pneumonia may also occur in the context of
other diseases (see below). Use of the name BOOP is no longer recommended, as it erroneously suggests a primarily airways disease and is easily
confused with bronchiolitis obliterans, a distinct disease entity.
Epidemiology More common in non-smokers. Mean age of onset
55 years, although can affect any age. Males = females.
Causes of organizing pneumonia
• Cryptogenic (COP)
• Organizing pneumonia secondary to:
• Infection (including pneumonia, lung abscess, bronchiectasis)
• Drug reaction or radiotherapy
• Connective tissue disease (particularly myositis, rheumatoid
arthritis, Sjögren’s)
• Diffuse alveolar damage
• Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
• Eosinophilic pneumonia
• Inﬂammatory bowel disease
• Post bone marrow transplant
• Lung malignancy or airways obstruction
• Pulmonary infarction.

Clinical features
• Typically short (<3 months) history of breathlessness and dry cough,
often with malaise, fevers, weight loss, and myalgia. Often presents as
a ‘slow to resolve chest infection’, frequently after several courses of
antibiotics
• Breathlessness is usually mild, although a minority of patients experience severe breathlessness, and rapid onset of respiratory failure and
sometimes death
• Examination may be normal or reveal crackles. Clubbing is absent.

Investigations
• Blood tests Raised CRP and ESR, neutrophilia
• PFTs Mild–moderate restrictive pattern is typical, although mild
airways obstruction may also be seen in smokers. Mild hypoxaemia
is common
• CXR classically shows patchy consolidation, sometimes with nodular
shadowing. May present as a solitary mass on CXR

CRYPTOGENIC ORGANIZING PNEUMONIA

• HRCT Areas of consolidation with air bronchograms, sometimes with
associated ground glass or small nodules. Often basal, subpleural, and
peribronchial. May migrate spontaneously. Reticulation may suggest
poor response to treatment. Less common appearance is as a solitary
mass that may cavitate and that is often mistaken radiologically for a
lung cancer. Septal thickening may occur
• TBB often conﬁrms diagnosis, but there is concern that the relatively
small samples may not effectively exclude associated diseases. Usually
adequate in patients with typical clinical and HRCT features who are
subsequently followed up closely. Surgical lung biopsy (at VATS) is
otherwise required
• BAL if performed, shows lymphocytosis, neutrophilia, and eosinophilia.

Histology Alveolar spaces ‘plugged’ with granulation tissue (ﬁbrin, collagencontaining ﬁbroblasts, often with inﬂammatory cells), sometimes with extension up into the bronchiolar lumen. Patchy. Lack of architectural distortion.
Examine for evidence of underlying cause, e.g. infection, vasculitis.
Diagnosis Usually made on the basis of clinical and HRCT features and
transbronchial biopsy. Surgical lung biopsy may be required in atypical
cases or if an underlying disease is suspected. Remember that the histological ﬁnding of ‘organizing pneumonia’ is non-speciﬁc, and search for
secondary causes (see list above). Lung cancers may be surrounded by
patches of organizing pneumonia, and biopsy of these areas in patients
with a solitary lung mass may give misleading results.

Differential diagnosis
•
•
•
•

Infective consolidation
Connective tissue disease, vasculitis
Lymphoma, alveolar cell carcinoma
Lung cancer (when COP presents as lung mass).

Management Steroids are the mainstay of treatment. Optimal dose and
duration unknown. Typical initial dose of oral prednisolone is 0.75 mg/kg
daily. Slowly taper the dose over a period of several months (see p 264, for
example). Additional treatment with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide may
be considered in patients with minimal response to steroids; intravenous
pulses of cyclophosphamide may be tried in addition to steroid treatment
in critically ill patients.
Prognosis Generally good. Most patients respond to steroids, and improve
within a week of starting treatment. Consider alternative diagnosis (e.g.
lymphoma) if no improvement on steroid doses >25 mg/day. Relapse is common on reduction of steroid dose, and treatment courses of 6–12 months
are usually required. A minority improve spontaneously. Lack of steroid
response and progressive respiratory failure and death are rare, but welldocumented.

CHAPTER 30

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias

Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP)
Deﬁnition Rapidly progressive form of interstitial pneumonia characterized histologically by diffuse alveolar damage. May be considered as an
idiopathic form of ARDS. Formerly known as Hamman–Rich syndrome.
Epidemiology Poorly described. Mean age of onset is 50, but may occur
at any age. Patients often previously healthy.
Clinical features
• Often preceded by ‘viral’-type illness, with systemic symptoms, e.g.
fevers, tiredness, myalgia, arthralgia
• Rapid onset (over days) of breathlessness; usually presents <3 weeks
after symptom onset
• Widespread crackles on examination.

Investigations
• CXR Bilateral diffuse airspace shadowing with air bronchograms,
progressing to widespread reticulation and ground glass; often spares
costophrenic angles, heart borders, and hila
• HRCT Bilateral diffuse ground glass and patchy airspace consolidation
in early stages; later traction bronchiectasis, cystic change, reticulation
• PFTs Restrictive, reduced gas transfer. Often profound hypoxia and
respiratory failure
• BAL Increased total cells, red blood cells, and haemosiderin.
Non-diagnostic, but may be useful in excluding infection
• Lung biopsy required for diagnosis. Transbronchial biopsy may be
diagnostic; the risk of pneumothorax is higher in mechanically
ventilated patients (about 10%), although serious complications are
rare. Surgical lung biopsy is otherwise required.

Histology Diffuse alveolar damage: hyaline membranes, oedema, interstitial inﬂammation, and alveolar septal thickening, progressing to organizing
ﬁbrosis and sometimes honeycombing.
Diagnosis based on lung biopsy and exclusion of causes of ARDS.
Differential diagnosis
• ARDS (ARDS is of known cause, whereas AIP is idiopathic; often
otherwise indistinguishable on clinical and histological grounds)
• Accelerated decline of IPF (with diffuse alveolar damage on biopsy)
• Connective tissue disease (causing diffuse alveolar damage)
• Diffuse infection (community-acquired pneumonia, PCP, CMV)
• Drug-induced pneumonitis
• Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis
• Acute eosinophilic pneumonia
• Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema
• Pulmonary haemorrhage/vasculitis.

ACUTE INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIA

Management No treatment demonstrated to be of beneﬁt. In practice,
treat infection (including consideration of unusual organisms) and consider
steroids (often given at high dose, e.g. intravenous methylprednisolone).
High ﬂow oxygen. ITU admission and mechanical ventilatory support usually
required.

Prognosis Overall mortality at least 50%, although difﬁcult to predict in
individuals. Survivors may stabilize, develop chronic progressive interstitial
lung disease, or experience recurrent exacerbations.

273

CHAPTER 30

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias

Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated
interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD)
Deﬁnition ‘Respiratory bronchiolitis’ is a pathological term referring
to the accumulation of bronchiolar pigmented macrophages in cigarette
smokers, and is asymptomatic in nearly all cases. A minority of smokers with
respiratory bronchiolitis, however, develop a form of interstitial lung disease
known as respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease
(RB-ILD). The exact relationship between RB-ILD and DIP is unclear—
they may be considered as different forms of the same underlying disease,
with DIP associated with a more extensive accumulation of macrophages
throughout alveolar spaces.
Epidemiology Invariably occurs in current or previous smokers, typically >30 pack years. Male:female 2:1. Usual age of onset 30–40 years.

Clinical features
• Usually mild breathlessness and cough
• Small proportion have severe dyspnoea and respiratory failure
• Often crackles on examination.

Investigations
• PFTs often show restrictive or combined obstructive and restrictive
picture, with mildly impaired gas transfer
• CXR Thick-walled bronchi, reticular or ground-glass change, may be
normal
• HRCT Centrilobular nodules, ground-glass change, thick-walled airways,
often with associated centrilobular emphysema
• BAL typically reveals pigmented alveolar macrophages.

Histology Accumulation of pigmented brown macrophages in terminal
bronchioles. Patchy bronchiolocentric distribution. These ﬁndings are
frequently incidental in smokers, and so the diagnosis of RB-ILD requires
consideration of clinical and imaging features in conjunction with histology.

Management Smoking cessation is the mainstay of treatment. Corticosteroids are occasionally used, with uncertain beneﬁt.

Prognosis Available data are limited; prolonged survival is common,
although improvements in symptoms or physiology appear to occur in
only a minority of patients.

CHAPTER 30

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias

Desquamative interstitial
pneumonia (DIP)
Deﬁnition Interstitial lung disease that occurs in smokers and is associated with the pathological ﬁnding of abundant pigmented macrophages
located diffusely throughout alveolar air spaces. It may represent a more
extensive form of RB-ILD, in which macrophages are restricted to peribronchiolar regions. The term DIP is misleading, as desquamation of epithelial cells is not responsible for the histological ﬁndings as previously
thought; a more accurate term is ‘alveolar macrophage pneumonia’,
although this is not in widespread use.

Epidemiology Very rare. Majority of patients are smokers, although
may also occur following inhalation of inorganic dusts, including passive
inhalation of cigarette smoke. Typically occurs aged 30–50.
Clinical features Onset of breathlessness and cough over weeks–
months is typical. Clubbing is common.
Investigations
• PFTs Mild restrictive pattern common, sometimes with reduced gas
transfer
• CXR may be normal, or may demonstrate reticular or ground-glass
pattern particularly affecting lower zones
• HRCT Ground glass seen in all cases, typically lower zone or peripheral predominance. Reticulation and honeycombing may be present,
although tend to be mild
• BAL Increase in pigmented macrophages.

Histology Diffuse accumulation of pigmented macrophages in alveolar
air spaces. Changes are uniform.

Diagnosis Clinical and HRCT features are non-speciﬁc and surgical lung
biopsy is required for diagnosis.
Management Smoking cessation. Corticosteroids are often used,
although their efﬁcacy has not been studied.
Prognosis Usually good prognosis. Improvement in ground glass on HRCT
may correlate with response to treatment. Survival 70% after 10 years.
Fluctuating course with remissions and relapses may occur.

CHAPTER 30

Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias

Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP)
Deﬁnition Interstitial pneumonia characterized by diffuse lymphoid inﬁltrates and often lymphoid hyperplasia. Previously considered to be a
precursor to pulmonary lymphoma, and difﬁcult to distinguish from lymphoma histologically, it is now considered a distinct entity and is thought
to only rarely undergo neoplastic transformation.
Epidemiology Very rare. Commoner in women. May occur at any age.
Causes/associations
• Idiopathic
• Connective tissue disease—particularly Sjögren’s syndrome, also rheumatoid arthritis, SLE
• Immunodeﬁciency, e.g. HIV
• Infection, e.g. PCP, hepatitis B
• Autoimmune disease, e.g. haemolytic anaemia, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,
pernicious anaemia, chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis,
myasthenia gravis
• Drugs.

Clinical features Gradual onset breathlessness and cough over several
years. Fever, weight loss may occur. Crackles may be heard on examination.

Investigations
• Blood tests Mild anaemia may occur; poly- or monoclonal increase in
serum immunoglobulins is common
• CXR Lower zone alveolar shadowing or diffuse honeycombing
• HRCT Predominant ground-glass change, often with reticulation and
sometimes honeycombing and nodules
• BAL Non-clonal lymphocytosis
• Investigations to identify underlying cause (see above).

Histology Diffuse interstitial lymphoid inﬁltrates, predominantly
involving alveolar septa, sometimes with lymphoid hyperplasia or honeycombing. Cellular NSIP, follicular bronchiolitis, and lymphoma may give
similar appearances.
Management Steroids are frequently used and often appear to improve
symptoms.

Prognosis Progression to extensive ﬁbrosis occurs in around one-third
of patients.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Epidemiology and types
Epidemiology
• Nearly 38, 000 new cases diagnosed per annum in the UK
• Commonest cause of cancer death in men and women in the UK
• 2:1 male:female, but numbers decreasing in men, increasing in women,
because of increasing smoking
• More women die from lung cancer than from any other cancer,
including breast
• 90% smoking-related
• Stopping smoking decreases the risk, but the risk remains higher
than in non-smokers
• Risk of lung cancer may be increased by asbestos exposure, arsenic
and heavy metal exposure, and coexistent idiopathic pulmonary
ﬁbrosis (IPF).

Types of lung cancer In practical terms, lung cancer is divided into two
groups, which inﬂuence management and treatment decisions.
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
• Accounts for 75–80% of all lung cancers
• Squamous cell carcinoma is the commonest histological type. Usually
presents as a mass on CXR, but may cavitate and look radiologically like
a lung abscess. Rarely, there may be multiple cavitating lesions. Patients
with hypercalcaemia are most likely to have squamous cell carcinoma
• Adenocarcinoma may not necessarily be smoking-related. Can occur in
scar tissue or sites of ﬁbrosis. Can be a lung primary or a secondary
from adenocarcinomas at other sites, especially if causing pleural
inﬁltration and subsequent pleural effusion
• Alveolar cell carcinoma is rare. It can rarely cause copious sputum
production (bronchorrhoea). Typically causes ﬂuffy air space shadowing
on CXR.
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
• Accounts for 20–25% of all lung cancers
• Most aggressive of lung cancer subtypes
• Usually disseminated by the time of diagnosis (haematogenous spread)
• Frequently metastasizes to liver, bones, bone marrow, brain, adrenals,
or elsewhere
• Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)
with hyponatraemia is common in small cell lung cancer
• Surgery usually not appropriate
• Chemo- and radiosensitive
• Untreated extensive stage small cell lung cancer is rapidly progressive
and has a median survival of 6 weeks.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Clinical features
Smokers and ex-smokers with chest symptoms, especially those aged
over 50, need investigation.

Symptoms and signs
These may be due to local tumour effects, metastatic tumour effects,
or paraneoplastic manifestations. Many patients have no speciﬁc signs.
In some, the lung cancer may be an incidental ﬁnding on CXR performed
for another reason.
Local tumour effects
• Persistent cough, or change in usual cough
• Haemoptysis
• Chest pain (suggests chest wall or pleural involvement)
• Unresolving pneumonia or lobar collapse
• Unexplained dyspnoea (due to bronchial narrowing or obstruction)
• Wheeze or stridor
• Shoulder pain (due to diaphragm involvement)
• Pleural effusion (due to direct tumour extension or pleural metastases)
• Hoarse voice (tumour invasion of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve)
• Dysphagia
• Raised hemi-diaphragm (phrenic nerve paralysis)
• SVCO (see p 300)
• Horner’s syndrome (meiosis, ptosis, enopthalmos, anhidrosis) due to
apical or Pancoast’s tumour
• Pancoast’s tumours can directly invade the sympathetic chain, brachial
plexus, and rib. Cause weakness of small muscles of the hand—C5/6,
T1 motor loss, and shoulder pain
Metastatic tumour effects
• Cervical/supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (common, present in 30%,
and may be an easy site for diagnostic biopsy)
• Palpable liver edge
• Bone pain/pathological fracture due to bone metastases
• Neurological sequelae secondary to cerebral metastases (median survival of NSCLC with brain metastases is 2 months)
• Hypercalcaemic effects (due to bony metastases or direct tumour
production of parathyroid-hormone-related peptide or parathyroid
hormone) see p 304
• Dysphagia (compression from large mediastinal nodes)
Paraneoplastic syndromes
Endocrine syndromes are due to the ectopic production of hormones or
hormonally active peptides. Neurological syndromes are due to antibody
mediated CNS damage.
• Cachexia and wasting
• Clubbing (up to 29% of patients; any cell type, more common in
squamous and adenocarcinoma)
• Gynaecomastia
• SIADH (mainly SCLC) in up to 15% of patients see p 306

CLINICAL FEATURES

• Ectopic ACTH (Cushing’s syndrome, but due to rapid development;
biochemical changes predominate, mainly SCLC) in 2–5% of patients
• Hypertrophic pulmonary osteo-arthropathy (HPOA, often in association with clubbing, any cell type; more common in squamous and
adenocarcinoma)
• Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (or LEMS)—with SCLC. Affects
proximal limbs and trunk, with autonomic involvement (dry mouth,
constipation, erectile failure) and hyporeﬂexia (although reﬂexes return
on exercising the affected muscle group), and only a slight response to
edrophonium. Symptoms may predate lung cancer by up to 4 years.
Caused by auto-antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Decreased acetylcholine release at motor nerve terminals leads
to the proximal weakness. Diagnosis made by auto-antibody detection
on radio-immunoprecipitation assay. EMG shows increased amplitude
of muscle action with high frequency stimulation and repeated muscle
contraction may lead to increasing strength and reﬂexes. Treatment
of underlying SCLC causes neurological improvement. If weakness is
severe, IV immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis may give short-term
beneﬁts. 3,4-Diaminopyridine may increase muscle strength in 85%
of patients. Prednisolone alone or with azathioprine or ciclosporin
can increase muscle strength and provide long-term control in
non-responders
• Cerebellar syndrome (usually SCLC)
• Limbic encephalitis (SCLC, also breast, testicular, other cancers. Occurs
within 4 years of diagnosis of cancer. Personality change, seizures,
depression, sub-acute onset confusion and short-term memory loss.
Diagnosed by pathological or radiological involvement of limbic system.
Anti-Hu antibodies positive in 50% if associated with lung cancer.)
• Glomerulonephritis.

Lymphangitis carcinomatosa Inﬁltration of pulmonary lymphatics
by tumour. May be due to lung cancer or breast, prostate, stomach, or
pancreatic malignancies. Causes shortness of breath, cough, and is often
associated with systemic signs of advanced malignancy. May be visible on
CXR as ﬁne linear shadowing throughout both lung ﬁelds. Septal lines
present. May look like pulmonary oedema. Easily diagnosed on CT. Oral
steroid treatment and diuretics can give symptomatic relief, but it is usually
a short-lived response. Often part of a rapid decline.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Investigations
Patients should be referred under the ‘2-week cancer wait’ scheme and
should be seen within 14 days of referral. The aim of the investigations is
to reach a histological diagnosis and tumour stage, in order to determine
the most appropriate treatment. Current government guidelines recommend patients should receive treatment without undue delay: within 31 days
of the decision to treat and within 62 days of their urgent referral.

In out-patients
• History and examination, including smoking and occupational histories
• Spirometry pre-biopsy or surgery
• CXR (PA and possibly lateral)—location of lesion, pleural involvement,
pleural effusion, rib destruction, intrathoracic metastases, mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. CXR can be normal
• Blood tests, including sodium, calcium, and liver function tests.
Check clotting if biopsy planned
• Sputum cytology only indicated in patients who are unﬁt for bronchoscopy or biopsy
• Diagnostic pleural tap, if effusion present
• Fine-needle aspiration of enlarged supraclavicular or cervical lymph
nodes.

Radiology
• CT chest, liver, adrenals (contrast-enhanced) to assess tumour site and
size Lung cancers frequently metastasize to the mediastinal lymph nodes,
liver, and adrenals. CT can locate lesions amenable to biopsy (either
the primary tumour or a metastasis). Assesses size of local and regional
lymph nodes. Poor at assessing whether enlarged nodes are reactive
(inﬂammatory) or represent metastatic spread (79% sensitive,
78% speciﬁc). Can assess tumour invasion to mediastinum and chest wall
• Ultrasound scan of neck or liver may provide information about
enlarged lymph nodes or metastases suitable for biopsy
• MRI Used to answer speciﬁc questions relating to tumour invasion/
borders. Good for assessing brachial plexus involvement. No role in
nodule assessment
• Bone scan Indicated if any suggestion of metastatic disease, such
as bony pain, pathological fracture, hypercalcaemia, raised alkaline
phosphatase. Highly suggestive of bony metastases if multiple areas of
increased uptake. Solitary lesion may require further evaluation
• CT head Only indicated if any neurological evidence of metastatic
disease, such as persistent vomiting, ﬁt, focal neurological signs,
headache, unexplained confusion, or personality change, especially if
aggressive local treatment is considered for primary tumour
• Positron emission tomography (PET scanning) Imaging technique,
where metabolically active tissues such as tumours take up more of
a radiolabelled 18-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG) molecule. They then
show as a ‘hot-spot’. Improves the rate of detection of local and distant
metastases in patients with NSCLC. Useful for assessing regional and
mediastinal lymph nodes (88% sensitive, 93% speciﬁc). This is increased

INVESTIGATIONS

if abnormal nodes are identiﬁed on CT. Becoming more widely used
and should be interpreted with the CT. Perform in:
• All patients considered for radical therapy to look for involved
lymph nodes and distant metastases
• Patients with N2–3 disease on CT of uncertain signiﬁcance, who are
otherwise surgical candidates
• Candidates for radical radiotherapy
• Limited stage SCLC staged by standard staging methods to
identify metastases, as SCLC avidly takes up FDG
PET positive nodes that would exclude a patient from surgery should
be conﬁrmed as malignant with a biopsy, unless the pre-test probability
of malignancy is high. PET may reveal a distant abnormality other than
the primary lung cancer, which could be a solitary metastasis or a second
cancer. It is important therefore to biopsy isolated PET abnormalities
before determining that a patient’s cancer is not resectable
False negatives occur in tumours with a low metabolic activity (such
as bronchoalveolar cell, carcinoid), small nodules, and hyperglycaemic
patients. False positives occur in patients with benign pulmonary nodules
with a high metabolic rate, such as infective granulomata.
Patients fast 4 h before the test and if they have diabetes, glucose should
be within the normal range

Multidisciplinary team (MDT)
Should include a chest physician, radiologist, thoracic surgeon, oncologist,
pathologist, lung cancer nurse, and palliative care specialist, who meet regularly in order to discuss patients and plan the most appropriate course
of management.
The Department of Health in the UK has produced guidelines for
performance in lung cancer care. These encourage access to the MDT in
decision making for the treatment and investigation of all patients with
lung cancer.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Diagnostic procedures
Investigations are performed to obtain a tissue diagnosis and to stage
cancer in order to determine the most appropriate treatment. Aim
to achieve diagnosis and staging with as few procedures as possible.
Establishing diagnosis and presence of metastatic spread at a single test is
desirable if possible. Aspects of further investigation may be inappropriate
if the patient has advanced disease, is frail with comorbid conditions, or
does not want to pursue diagnosis. This should be documented in their
notes, to aid audit and cancer service evaluation.

Bronchoscopy Method of obtaining histological and cytological specimens. Suitable for central tumours. Tumours can be washed, brushed,
and biopsied. Bronchoscopic samples are more likely to be histologically
positive if there is:
• An ill-deﬁned lesion on the CXR
• An endobronchial component to the tumour
• Tumour less than 4 cm from the origin of the nearest lobar bronchus
• A segmental or larger airway leading to the mass.
Greater diagnostic yield if performed after CT scan, as radiologically
abnormal areas can be targeted. Tumour position bronchoscopically may
contribute to operative decisions: tumour conﬁned to a lobar bronchus
may be resectable with lobectomy, tumour <2 cm from the main carina
requires pneumonectomy, left vocal cord paralysis indicates inoperability
due to tumour inﬁltration of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, and a
splayed carina occurs secondary to enlarged mediastinal nodes.

Transbronchial needle aspiration of lymph nodes can be performed
to aid staging at the time of bronchoscopy. Also EUS-FNA (endoscopic
ultrasound guided ﬁne-needle aspirate) or endoscopic bronchial ultrasound (EBUS)—all may reduce need for mediastinoscopy/otomy and are
less invasive (see p 754).
CT/USS-guided biopsy of tumour or of an enlarged lymph node,
especially in the neck, or of a metastasis (see box opposite). 85–90% sensitivity in lesions >2 cm. Biopsy of a metastasis gives valuable staging information as well as also diagnosing the primary.

Mediastinoscopy Biopsy of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes to
determine whether they are inﬂammatory or have malignant invasion.
Suprasternal notch incision under general anaesthetic, blunt dissection,
palpation, and endoscopic visualization and biopsy of nodes: paratracheal,
prevascular, tracheobronchial, and anterior subcarinal. 93% sensitivity, 96%
speciﬁcity. Technically more difﬁcult if SVCO. Bleeding in <0.3%, left recurrent laryngeal nerve injury in 1%, pneumothorax, mediastinal emphysema,
infection, oesophageal perforation (all rare). Repeat mediastinoscopies
have lower positive yield and higher complication rate.
Mediastinotomy Biopsy of aorto-pulmonary, sub-aortic, phrenic, or
hilar nodes. Metastatic involvement of these nodes does not necessarily
preclude curative surgical resection with a pneumonectomy. Also can
assess direct tumour invasion of central pulmonary artery or thoracic
aorta, which would preclude curative surgery. Right or left parasternal

DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES

incision, blunt dissection, palpation, and endoscopic visualization and
biopsy of nodes.

Thoracoscopy may be required to determine whether a pleural effusion
contains malignant cells or is inﬂammatory, for example, due to pneumonia caused by an obstructing lesion. Malignant effusions are evidence
of T4 disease and hence are a contraindication to surgery.

Operative It is sometimes difﬁcult to obtain deﬁnitive cytology or histology pre-operatively. If there is a high suspicion of malignancy, surgery
can be performed regardless. Patients undergoing surgery are given a
pathological stage, which is sometimes different to the clinical stage. This
is because resection margins, lymph nodes, and the pleura can be sampled
histologically.
Radiologically guided lung biopsy
Indications
• New or enlarging mass, not amenable to bronchoscopy
• Multiple chest nodules in patient not known to have malignancy
• Persistent undiagnosed single or multiple focal inﬁltrates
• Hilar mass.
Pre-biopsy preparation
• Discuss with MDT
• Recent spirometry, with FEV1 >35% predicted
• Check APTT and PT ratios <1.4 and platelets >100 000/mL. If not,
discuss with haematologist to determine whether it is safe to proceed
• Recent imaging available
• High risk patients should have overnight admission following biopsy
• Written information for patient, with informed signed consent.
Biopsy preparation
• Perform without sedation if possible
• Use USS if possible
• Local anaesthetic to skin and subcutaneous tissue
• Perform at least two passes, may use FNA or cutting needle. FNA
high diagnostic yield for malignant lesions (95%), but less for benign
(10–50%). Cutting needles as good for malignancy and better for
benign diagnoses. Operator decision.
Post-biopsy
• Observation by staff for 1 h in case of complications
• Erect CXR 1 h after biopsy and reviewed by doctor
• Manage any pneumothorax according to BTS guidelines (p 373). Small
pneumothoraces often resolve spontaneously, but may need
in-patient admission if there are concerns.
Complications
• 20% chance of pneumothorax, 3% require chest drain
• Haemoptysis 5%, death 0.15%.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Staging
Clinical and radiological tools categorize tumour size, location, regional
and distant spread, and aid determination of most appropriate treatment.
They can also therefore give prognostic information.
• Small cell lung cancer is staged as:
• Limited conﬁned to ipsilateral hemi-thorax and supraclavicular
lymph nodes. Median survival with treatment 12 months, without
treatment 12 weeks
• Extensive everything else. Median survival with treatment
8 months, without treatment 6 weeks
• Non-small cell lung cancer is commonly classiﬁed using TNM
staging system (see box opposite). Frequency of patient stage at diagnosis:
• I and II—20%
• III—35%
• IV—45%.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC): surgery
Much of the investigation of lung cancer is to determine whether a
patient has disease that is potentially curable by surgery. Other treatment
options include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and best supportive care,
i.e. symptom-based conservative management. The MDT decides the most
appropriate choice of treatment which is then discussed with the patient.

Surgery
The aims of surgery for lung cancer are to completely excise the tumour
and local lymphatics, with minimal removal of normal functioning lung
parenchyma.
• Stages I and II non-small cell lung cancers are usually amenable to
surgery if the patient is ﬁt enough (see below). This has a high chance
of cure in stage I (70% in IA), and a reasonable chance in stage II.
10–20% of NSCLC patients undergo resection
• In stage IIIA tumours, surgery alone is unlikely to be curative, but
adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy can improve survival rates.
These patients should be recruited to clinical trials
• Stages IIIB and IV are inoperable
• Stages 0/tumour in situ often will have no deﬁned primary lesion
amenable to resection. The natural progression of these tumours is still
unknown; they may progress or regress with time.
Resectability of a tumour implies likelihood of complete removal by
surgery; this is different from patient operability, which is determined by
the patient’s ﬁtness for surgery.
Fitness for surgery
• Age is not a contraindication, but increasing age is associated with an
increased peri-operative morbidity. Higher mortality risk if over 80
and if pneumonectomy, rather than lobectomy (14% mortality vs 7%,
respectively). Right pneumonectomy has higher mortality than left
pneumonectomy (more lung removed). 2-year post-operative survival
similar to that of other age groups
• Lung function FEV1 >1.5 L post-bronchodilator for lobectomy, >2 L
post-bronchodilator for pneumonectomy or more than 60% of predicted. Borderline cases may require further lung function assessment
(arterial saturations, full PFTs including TLCO, isotope perfusion
scan, exercise testing) in order to calculate whether predicted postoperative FEV1 >40% in association with TLCO >40%
• Cardiovascular Postpone surgery if patient has had MI within
6 weeks. Cardiology opinion if patient has had MI within 6 months.
Echo if they have heart murmur. Pre-operative ECG for all
• CNS If any history of TIAs, strokes, or carotid bruits: need carotid
Doppler studies and vascular surgeon opinion if necessary
• Nutritional Requirements should be optimized, with advice from a
dietician if necessary. Patients presenting with a pre-operative weight
loss of 10% or more ± performance status ≥2 are more likely to have
advanced disease or comorbidities. Therefore require careful staging
and search for evidence of comorbidity.

NSCLC: SURGERY

Types of surgery Lobectomy or bi-lobectomy for localized tumour, or
pneumonectomy for tumour involving more than one or two lobes. If hilar
nodes are inﬁltrated by tumour a more radical lobectomy or a pneumonectomy is required. The local lymph nodes are removed in each procedure
for pathological staging. Wedge excision removes only the tumour with
minimal surrounding lung parenchyma, and may be performed for a localized peripheral lesion with clear regional lymph nodes, especially if the
post-operative respiratory function is predicted to be borderline: there
is a higher local recurrence rate, however (up to 23%). Sleeve resections
involve a lobectomy and the removal of a section of bronchus affected by
tumour, forming an anastomosis between the airway proximal and distal
to it. This may avoid a pneumonectomy. Resection margins should be
macroscopically free from tumour. If there is limited local tumour invasion
to the chest wall, this can be resected with a 5-cm margin. Reconstruction
with prosthetic material may be necessary if 2 or more ribs are resected,
aiming to preserve the chest wall function.
Post-operative complications Bronchopleural ﬁstula, respiratory failure,
infection, phrenic nerve damage causing diaphragmatic paralysis, recurrent
laryngeal nerve damage causing hoarse voice, prolonged chest wall pain.
Mortality: 1–3.5% for wedge excision, 2–4% for lobectomy, 6–8% for pneumonectomy. Risk increases with increasing age, associated ischaemic heart
disease, impaired respiratory function, and poor performance status.
Following surgery Patients are often followed up by the chest clinic
on a 6–12-monthly basis for CXR review for 5 years (although there
is no clear evidence on the necessity of such prolonged follow up in
lung cancer). This is to ensure they are radiologically clear of tumour
recurrence, and there is not a second primary tumour. They should also
be advised to seek earlier review if they have symptoms of persistent
haemoptysis or new cough, weight loss, new chest pain. If histology
shows incomplete resection margins, post-operative radiotherapy would
be given to try and improve local disease control.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

NSCLC: chemotherapy
Consider in patients with stage III–IV disease, WHO performance status
0–2 (see p 295), even if they are asymptomatic from their cancer (greater
toxicity in those with poorer performance status). 40% respond temporarily. Small improvement in symptom control and quality of life compared with best supportive care shown in RCTs. Limited survival gains,
6–7 weeks compared with best supportive care. Median survival with
chemotherapy in stage IV lung cancer: 10 months (Ps0), 7 months (Ps1),
4 months (Ps2).
Combination chemotherapy (the use of more than one drug) is
superior to single agent chemotherapy, improving survival rates when
compared with single agent at 6 and 12 months (51% vs. 49% and 25% vs.
22%, respectively).
• Commonly used ﬁrst-line regimens include gemcitabine or vinorelbine
plus a platinum-containing drug (carboplatin or cisplatin), usually given
for 4 cycles
• Side-effects Nausea, myelosupression, ototoxicity, peripheral
neuropathy, nephropathy if dehydrated. No alopecia
• Patients are monitored during chemotherapy with repeat CT, usually
after 2 cycles, to establish whether they have partial response, stable
disease, or progressive disease, despite chemotherapy. This CT
inﬂuences decisions regarding further chemotherapy
• Second-line treatments can be given in patients who relapse and are of
good performance status. Taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) are the most
commonly used agents. These cause alopecia.

Adjuvant therapy is the use of radiation or chemotherapy following
complete surgical resection to improve survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy
has been found to have signiﬁcant survival advantages compared with
surgery alone in recent trials, including International Adjuvant Lung Cancer
Trial and Japan Lung Cancer Research group. Those with stage IB or stage
II disease had a 69% 5-year survival vs. 54% in those treated with surgery
alone. This treatment is now offered to patients with completely resected
stage IB, II, and IIIa NSCLC. Adjuvant radiotherapy trials have shown no
evidence of a survival beneﬁt, except possibly in those with N2 disease.
Should only be given in the context of a trial.

Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy uses a non-surgical therapy (radiotherapy/chemotherapy) as the initial treatment. Pre-operative chemotherapy has been shown in the recent multi-centre LU22 trial to downstage
a third of patients, but with no improvement in survival vs. surgery alone.
Post-operative complications and quality of life were no worse in the
chemotherapy group. A subsequent meta-analysis suggested a 12% survival
beneﬁt when compared with surgery alone, equivalent to 5% improvement in 5 year survival. It is important, however, not to delay surgery and
it is unclear as yet whether these results will change current practice.
Chemotherapy may also be given in the context of a trial, if surgery is not
initially feasible due to stage IIIa disease, aiming to downstage the tumour
and allow resection. Unclear survival beneﬁts thus far.

NSCLC: CHEMOTHERAPY

EGFR inhibitors EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is an
important mediator of cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is overexpressed in 40–80% of NSCLC patients. New EGFR inhibitors include:
• Geﬁtinib (Iressa) Oral preparation used vs. placebo in patients refractory
or intolerant of their latest chemotherapy. No signiﬁcant difference in
median survival time between the two groups
• Erlotinib (Tarceva) Shown to signiﬁcantly improve survival in patients
with previously treated stage IIIB or IV NSCLC vs. placebo (6.7 vs.
4.7 months, p = 0.001). No beneﬁt shown in combination with chemotherapy as a ﬁrst-line treatment. Used as second- or third-line therapy
in NSCLC, but funding issues in UK.

Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST)—
method of measuring response of a tumour to treatment
(particularly in chemotherapy trials)
Target lesion = all measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions
per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs.
Record and measure sum of their longest diameter.
Non-target lesions = all other sites of disease, which are recorded at
baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but presence
or absence of each is noted during follow-up.

Evaluation of target lesions
• Complete response (CR)—disappearance of all target lesions
• Partial response (PR)—at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the
longest diameter of target lesions
• Progressive disease (PD)—at least a 20% increase in the sum of the
longest diameter of target lesions
• Stable disease (SD)—neither sufﬁcient shrinkage to qualify for PR,
nor sufﬁcient increase to qualify for PD.

Evaluation of non-target lesions
• Complete response (CR)—disappearance of all non-target lesions and
normalization of tumour marker level
• Incomplete response/stable disease (SD)—persistence of one or
more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumour marker
level above the normal limits
• Progressive disease (PD)—appearance of one or more new lesions
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

NSCLC: radiotherapy
May be given for:
• Curative intent (high dose)
• Palliative control (high dose)
• Symptom relief (low dose).
Radiotherapy has no beneﬁt following complete primary tumour surgical
resection.
CHART (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy) is highdose radiotherapy given with curative intent.
• Recommended for patients with localized chest disease <5 cm, stage
I–II with performance status 0–1, who are resectable, but unﬁt for
surgery or do not want surgery
• Small radiation doses tds for 12 days (54 Gy in 36 fractions over
12 days)
• Patients are often in-patients for the duration of their therapy to
facilitate their frequent radiotherapy sessions
• Less morbidity than conventional radical radiotherapy
• A large randomized control trial has shown an improvement in 2-year
survival from 20% with conventional radical radiotherapy to 29% with
CHART. The largest beneﬁts were in patients with squamous cell
carcinoma. Overall 75% 1 year survival, 55% 2 year survival, 18% 5 year
survival.
• Severe dysphagia more likely with CHART in the ﬁrst 3 months than
with conventional radiotherapy
• Need PFTs including lung volume and TLCO before CHART.FEV1
should be ≥1.5l
• Not performed in all UK centres; lack of radiographers may limit
availability.
High-dose palliative radiotherapy is given to patients with symptomatic
disease, good performance status, no evidence of metastases, and who
will be able to tolerate a high-dose regime. An example of such a regime
would be 36–39 Gy in 12–13 fractions over 6 weeks. Improves median
survival by 2 months.
Low-dose radiotherapy is given for symptom relief in patients who would
be unable to tolerate high-dose palliative radiotherapy or those with
evidence of metastases. Symptoms palliated include pain, haemoptysis,
breathlessness, or cough.
Urgent radiotherapy is used in combination with oral steroids for relief of
superior vena cava obstruction by tumour, although stenting performed
via CT angiography is now the treatment of choice, where possible.
Radiotherapy takes approximately 10 days to be effective.
Chemoradiotherapy is used to improve tumour radiosensitization for
localized disease. There may be some additional advantages with treatment of potential distant micrometastases. Some early survival beneﬁts
have been shown, and further studies are ongoing.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Small cell lung cancer: treatment
Surgery Limited stage small cell lung cancer may be appropriate for
surgical resection if there is no evidence of metastases. This is rare. It
requires further assessment with brain and bone scanning ± bone marrow
biopsy if there is an unexplained abnormal FBC. The patient should also be
considered for post-operative combination chemotherapy for treatment of micro-metastases, especially if histology was only determined at
operation.

Chemotherapy
Combination chemotherapy is used for limited and extensive SCLC.
• Etoposide with either cisplatin or carboplatin is the standard regime
• Given 3 weekly, commonly for 6 cycles
• Different regimes are selected according to performance status
• Patients with performance status 3 may beneﬁt from less intensive
out-patient chemotherapy on a 3 weekly basis
• Patients are carefully assessed and, if there is no sign of a response to
treatment based on CXR or CT scan, they are switched to second-line
agents, such as single agent topotecan or combination cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine
• 80–90% response if limited disease; 60–80% if extensive disease
• Chemotherapy may increase median survival to 12 months in limited
disease.

Radiotherapy
• Patients with limited stage disease who are reasonably well should have
consolidation radiotherapy to the chest disease, either with the ﬁrst
or second cycle of chemotherapy or after completion if they have a
response or partial response
• Prophylactic cranial radiotherapy is advised at completion of
chemotherapy for those with limited disease or those with extensive
disease and good prognostic factors. This improves survival by 5.4%
• In patients with extensive disease, including cerebral metastases, or
poorer performance status, chemotherapy is given ﬁrst. If there is a
good response, palliative thoracic radiotherapy may be given
• Of beneﬁt to symptomatic bone metastases, cord compression, SVCO.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Lung cancer: emerging areas
Radio-frequency ablation (RFA) applied via a probe inserted into a nodule/
tumour under CT guidance with sedation. Barbs/tines extrude from needle
once in the tumour and cause tissue death by thermal necrosis. Lesions
initially increase in size and density, and may cavitate, but then become
ﬁbrotic scar tissue. May become a tool to treat patients with primary
lung cancer unsuitable for curative surgery/radiotherapy due to comorbid
disease, used with radiotherapy. The size of the cancer that can be treated
is limited (maximum 5 cm, best results with <3 cm). Peripheral lesions
are easier to access. Side-effects of therapy: pleuritic chest pain, pneumothorax, haemoptysis, haemorrhage, low grade fever. FEV1 should ideally
be >1 L. Tumour follow-up with contrast-enhanced imaging as ablated
tissue does not enhance. Used currently mainly in pulmonary metastases
from gastrointestinal or renal cell cancers, or sarcomas, which are not suitable for surgical resection, but also some data for primary NSCLC. In 153
patients with primary or metastatic medically inoperable lung cancer, 78%
1-year survival rate, 57% 2-year, 27% 5-year (Simon CJ et al. Radiology 2007;
243: 268–75). No long-term RCT reported.
Biological therapies such as oral thalidomide acting as an angiogenesis
inhibitor are being tried. These may offer medium-term survival beneﬁts in
both SCLC and NSCLC.
Targeted molecular therapy Lung cancer is said to be at the leading edge
of targeted molecular therapy, which may become more effective than
using traditional cytotoxic agents. The presence or absence of these
molecular target molecules seems to determine response to traditional
treatments. The cellular targets under investigation include epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), protein kinase C, vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclo-oxygenase 2, plus expression of various genes,
including excision repair cross complementation protein gene, which has a
role in DNA repair. Gene expression proﬁling may be used to determine
the prognosis and response to therapy and to identify the mechanisms of
tumour biology. In the future, lung cancer staging may also address the
molecular biology of a tumour.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Superior vena caval obstruction
(SVCO): aetiology and clinical
assessment
Obstruction of the ﬂow of blood in the superior vena cava results in the
symptoms and signs of SVCO. It is caused by two different mechanisms
(which may coexist): external compression or invasion of the superior vena
cava by tumour extending from the right lung (four times more common
than the left lung), lymph nodes, or other mediastinal structure; or due to
thrombosis within the vein.

Aetiology The commonest cause is malignancy. Lung cancer and lymphoma
together cause 94% of SVCO.
Malignant causes
• Lung cancer Up to 4% of lung cancer patients will develop SVCO at
some point during their disease. Up to 10% of small cell lung cancers
present with SVCO
• Lymphoma Up to 4% of lymphoma patients will develop SVCO, most
commonly in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. This usually occurs due to
extrinsic compression of the SVC by enlarged lymph nodes
• Other malignant causes Thymoma, mediastinal germ cell tumours,
tumours with mediastinal metastases (commonest is breast cancer).
Benign causes include granulomatous disease, intrathoracic goitre, and
central venous lines, port-a-caths, and pacemaker wires (causing thrombosis). In the past SVCO was commonly due to untreated infection,
e.g. syphilitic thoracic aortic aneurysm or ﬁbrosing mediastinitis (due to
actinomycosis, tuberculosis, blastomycosis, or Aspergillus). These are all
now rare.

Clinical features
• Facial and upper body oedema with facial plethora, often with
increased neck circumference, and a cyanotic appearance
• Venous distension of the face and upper body. SVCO due to malignancy
usually develops over days to weeks, so an adequate collateral circulation does not have time to develop. Pemberton’s sign—facial plethora,
distress, and sometimes stridor after lifting the arms above the head for
a few minutes—may suggest the diagnosis
• Breathlessness
• Headache—worse on bending forwards or lying down
• Cough/haemoptysis or other signs of an underlying lung malignancy
• Hoarse voice
• Dysphagia
• Syncope/dizziness (reduced venous return)
• Confusion.

Diagnosis is usually made clinically from the signs of facial and upper
body swelling, with distension of superﬁcial veins across the chest wall,
neck, and upper arms.

SVCO: AETIOLOGY AND CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

Investigations The investigation and treatment of SVCO was previously
considered a medical emergency. SVCO is now not considered to be
immediately life-threatening, making treatment less urgent and allowing a
deﬁnitive diagnosis to be made prior to treatment. The exception to this
rule is the patient who presents with stridor or laryngeal oedema, which
is a medical emergency.
• CXR Up to 85% have an abnormal CXR (as lung malignancy is the
commonest underlying disorder). Mediastinal widening is common
• CT chest with contrast can stage the underlying malignancy and image
the venous circulation and collateral blood supply
• Tissue diagnosis Usual practice is to obtain a tissue diagnosis of the
underlying disease before starting treatment, as the underlying diagnosis can alter treatment markedly. Symptomatic obstruction will have
been developing for some weeks prior to presentation and, in the
clinically stable patient, a delay of 24–48 h whilst the correct underlying
diagnosis is obtained is warranted. Radiotherapy prior to biopsy can
lead to problems making a subsequent histological diagnosis, and,
similarly, high-dose steroids can make the diagnosis of lymphoma
difﬁcult
• Cytological diagnosis may be obtained from:
• Pleural ﬂuid
• Ultrasound guided biopsy of an extrathoracic lymph node
(e.g. supraclavicular or cervical nodes—low risk)
• Bronchoscopy, or mediastinoscopy if no endobronchial disease, may
be needed, depending on CT features. There may be increased risk
of bleeding post-biopsy because of venous congestion, and
anaesthesia is theoretically more risky because of possible
associated tracheal obstruction or pericardial effusion (potentially
leading to haemodynamic compromise due to cardiac tamponade),
though these can be anticipated from the CT scan
• Sputum
22 SVCO: management
This is usually in two phases.
• Initial general treatment: oxygen, analgesia, sitting the patient up (to
reduce venous pressure), and steroids (in some)
• Followed by treatment of the underlying disease causing the SVCO,
dependent on the tissue diagnosis. The major differential in terms of
treatment is small cell carcinoma (initial chemotherapy), non-small
cell carcinoma (initial radiotherapy), and lymphoma (chemotherapy).
The presence of SVCO usually means that surgical resection of a
NSCLC is not possible.

301

302

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

22 SVCO: management (cont.)
Steroids Limited trial data to support the use of steroids in SVCO, prior
to deﬁnitive treatment, but most would start them fairly promptly (e.g.
dexamethasone 8 mg bd, avoid in the evening as affects sleep). They
may reduce oedema and improve symptoms. Ideally a tissue diagnosis
should be obtained before commencing steroids, but may not always
be possible. The problem arises where the underlying diagnosis is
lymphoma, where steroids may alter the histology, making a deﬁnitive
diagnosis more difﬁcult. In an older smoker, with an obvious CXR mass
(in whom the diagnosis is likely to be lung cancer), steroids can probably
be started without risk to the underlying histology.
Radiotherapy 90% of patients are oedema-free by 3–4 weeks. In those
with a poor response to radiotherapy, only 25% survive 1 year.
Intraluminal stents are used for malignant SVCO, and may be a ﬁrst-line
treatment whilst radiotherapy is planned. Successful in 90% of cases, with
relief of symptoms in most patients within 48 h. They do not preclude subsequent radiotherapy or chemotherapy. In SCLC, however, chemotherapy
will improve SVCO rapidly, so stent insertion may not be necessary.
It is not clear whether post-procedure anticoagulation is required.
Some centres advocate the use of low-dose warfarin anticoagulation
(i.e. 1 mg/day), aiming for an INR of <1.6. Thrombosis in the SVC is not a
contraindication to the procedure, as clot can be dispersed mechanically
or with thrombolysis at the time of the procedure.
Stent complications Stent migration is the major complication, but most
patients do not live long enough for this to be a major problem.
Anticoagulation Some recommend prophylactic anticoagulation in the
presence of SVCO. Small increased risk of intracerebral bleeding, but
the beneﬁts of SVCO treatment may be limited by subsequent SVC
thrombus if anticoagulation is not started. This is controversial.
SVCO due to thrombosis is usually in association with central venous
lines or pacemaker wires. If the clot is less than 5 days old (as judged by
symptoms) thrombolysis is warranted. Subsequent oral anticoagulation
may reduce recurrence.

Prognosis depends on the underlying disease, and is unrelated to the
duration of SVCO at presentation. The majority of SVCO is due to mediastinal spread of carcinoma of the lung, so the overall prognosis is generally
poor, but depends on the patient’s performance status, stage and extent of
disease, and the cell type.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Hypercalcaemia
Deﬁnition and aetiology A serum calcium level over 2.75 mmol/L
is considered abnormal; borderline values need repeating. In malignancy,
a raised calcium is due to increased osteoclast activity, either from bony
metastases or the production of parathyroid-hormone-related protein.
A serum level over 3.25 mmol/L is rare outside malignancy, although can
occur in sarcoidosis.

Clinical features Values over 3 mmol/L are usually symptomatic.
Common symptoms are confusion, weakness, nausea, reduced ﬂuid intake,
and constipation. There may be a short QT interval on ECG and renal
failure.
Investigations Exclude other causes of hypercalcaemia and identify the
tumour, although in most patients with malignant hypercalcaemia the diagnosis of malignancy will already be known. The parathyroid hormone (PTH)
will be suppressed in malignant hypercalcaemia, but raised in hyperparathyroidism. The phosphate will tend to be low in hyperparathyroidism and
hypercalcaemia due to ectopic PTH, and low/normal in sarcoidosis, metastatic bone disease, and with excess vitamin D. Check for renal failure.

22 Management of hypercalcaemia
• Isotonic saline infusion (250 ml/h initially, to reverse dehydration,
but avoid ﬂuid overload, reducing to 150 ml/h) with furosemide to
increase calcium excretion
• Steroids help, but less so than in sarcoid-associated hypercalcaemia,
partly through reduced intestinal absorption.
In addition to this initial management:
• Reduce bone reabsorption with bisphosphonates (takes a few days
for maximum effect). The bisphosphonates can also reduce the
pain of secondary bony deposits and may reduce pathological
fracture rate.
• Intravenous preparations Disodium pamidronate, 10 mL vial of
3 mg/mL, or 10 mL vial of 6 mg/mL infused over 2 h. Works for
several weeks. Sodium clodronate, 300 mg (1 x 5 mL vial of 60
mg/mL) daily for 7 days or 1.5 g single dose (5 x 5 mL vials of 60
mg/mL). Zoledronic acid, 4 mg vial reconstituted in water and
given over 2 h, repeated monthly if required
• Oral preparations Sodium clodronate, one 800 mg tablet bd.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Syndrome of inappropriate secretion
of ADH (SIADH)
Deﬁnition and aetiology Excessive retention of water relative to electrolytes due to inappropriate production of ADH. Hence there is hyponatraemia (<135 meq/L), hypo-osmolality, a urine osmolality >100 mosmol/kg,
a urine sodium concentration usually above 40 meq/L, normal acid–base
(and potassium), and usually a low plasma urea concentration. Diureticinduced hyponatraemia will be accompanied by evidence of dehydration,
e.g. raised urea. Causes of SIADH include:
• Drugs, e.g. carbamazepine, ﬂuoxetine, high-dose cyclophosphamide
• Post major surgery
• Pneumonia
• HIV infection
• CNS disorders, e.g. stroke, infection, psychosis
• Small cell lung cancer, either ectopic ADH production or stimulation of
normal ADH production (poor prognostic factor).
Clinical features Lethargy and confusion often when sodium levels fall
below 130 meq/L and nearly always when below 120 meq/L.
Investigations A low sodium in the presence of a low urea and an
appropriate clinical setting may be adequate to make a diagnosis. If sodium
depletion/water overload are a possible alternative cause of hyponatraemia, they should be accompanied by a urine osmolarity <100 mosmol/
kg (or a speciﬁc gravity <1.003 or a urine sodium <40 meq/L). Therefore,
values increasingly above this are suggestive of SIADH (unless the patient
is on loop diuretics when, of course, the urinary sodium concentration
will be higher).

22 Management of inappropriate ADH secretion
• Fluid restriction (0.5–1.0 L/day) will help, but is often unpleasant for
the patient
• Demeclocycline (450 mg bd, tetracycline derivative) blocks ADH
action at the distal renal tubules and can be used long term
• Salt tablets/extra-dietary salt
• May resolve over a few weeks following chemotherapy
• Hypertonic saline is rarely indicated and can provoke brainstem
damage (demyelination) through rapid changes in osmolality.

Future developments
New drugs speciﬁcally blocking the ADH receptor in the distal tubule are
under investigation.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Spinal cord compression
This is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment within 24 h to
prevent irreversible paraplegia and loss of bowel and bladder function.

Deﬁnition and aetiology Spinal cord compression occurs commonly
in patients with metastatic cancer (in about 5% of all cancer patients,
particularly breast, lung, and prostate cancer). It may be the ﬁrst presentation of cancer, but often occurs in patients with a known primary tumour.
Cord compression is commonly caused by direct spread from a vertebral metastasis into the extradural space or, less commonly, from pressure
on the cord from a primary tumour in the posterior mediastinum or the
retroperitoneum, or by pressure from a mass of retroperitoneal nodes.
It is unusual to have a metastasis within the cord itself, although meningeal spread can occur. Spinal cord compression causes interruption of the
arterial supply to the cord and subsequent infarction.

Clinical features Patients frequently experience back pain initially,
due to associated vertebral collapse. This precedes any neurological signs.
Pain is not, however, universal. Neurological signs may be non-speciﬁc:
weak legs, constipation, urinary incontinence. Leg weakness develops
over hours–days, with associated sensory loss. Loss of bladder and bowel
sensation is a late sign and usually heralds irreversible paraplegia within
hours or a few days. Examination reveals bilateral upper motor neuron
signs in the legs, with increased tone, weakness, brisk reﬂexes, and
extensor plantars. There may be sensory loss in the legs, particularly with
a loss of proprioception and a sensory level on the trunk. Sensory loss in
the saddle area, with decreased rectal tone, suggests a cauda equina lesion.
The bladder may be palpable.

Investigations
Have a low threshold for investigating a patient with known cancer with back
pain
• MRI of the spine is the investigation of choice to demonstrate the level
of the cord compression
• CT is less reliable, but can also be helpful, if MRI is not available
• Plain spine XR may show vertebral metastases, but this is usually
unhelpful, as there is no imaging of the spinal cord. Time should not be
wasted in obtaining a plain XR
• Bone scan shows vertebral metastases, but again does not image the
spinal cord. Earlier scans showing bony metastases may alert the
physician to the possibility of future cord compression
• If patient is not known to have underlying malignant disease, a search
for a primary tumour should be performed, but must not delay
treatment of the spinal cord compression. Take full history (weight loss,
anorexia, speciﬁc symptoms) and perform full examination, CXR,
blood tests, PSA, and myeloma screen.

SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION

22 Management of spinal cord compression
This depends on tumour type and overall prognosis. Discuss with oncologist and/or neurosurgeon to determine which deﬁnitive treatment(s)
are the most appropriate for the patient.
• High-dose steroids (dexamethasone IV 4 mg/6 h). These should be
started whilst waiting for MRI scan, if the clinical picture suggests
cord compression
• Radiotherapy to the metastasis or tumour causing cord compression,
particularly if there are multiple sites of cord compression or if
surgery is not advised
• Surgical decompression of the cord, reconstruction, and stabilizing
the spinal column
• Catheter if in urinary retention
• Care for pressure areas
• DVT prophylaxis
• Consider chemotherapy, if appropriate, for underlying cancer causing
the spinal cord compression, once the initial treatment has taken
place
• Rehabilitation, ideally in unit with spinal cord expertise.
Early referral to physiotherapists and occupational therapists with
oncology expertise.
A recent Dutch study showed 66% of patients with metastatic cord
compression (from all cancers) admitted to rehabilitation centres were discharged and the average survival post-discharge was 808 days. 52% were
alive at 1 year.

Prognosis Patients who are mobile at presentation have the best prognosis and are likely to have preserved neurological function following
treatment. If there is some preserved motor function, 25% will be able to
walk post-treatment. If paraplegia is present pre-treatment, less than 10%
will be able to walk afterwards. Loss of bladder function for more than
24–48 h cannot be reversed.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Pulmonary carcinoid tumours
These are uncommon primary lung tumours, comprising 1–2% of all
lung tumours. Equal male/female incidence; typical age at presentation is
40–50 years. They are a form of neuroendocrine tumour and can have
similar histological appearances to small cell lung cancer.

Pathophysiology Although typically slow growing benign tumours,
more aggressive subtypes exist, with metastatic potential. Commonly they
are located endobronchially, but can also be located peripherally in the
lung parenchyma.
Clinical features
• Endobronchial carcinoids can cause isolated wheeze, dyspnoea,
infection, haemoptysis, or persistent lobar collapse
• Parenchymal carcinoids are often asymptomatic, being detected on
routine CXR
• Carcinoid syndrome, with ﬂushing, tachycardia, sweats, diarrhoea,
wheeze, and hypotension, occurs in 1% of pulmonary carcinoid
tumours
• Carcinoid tumours can also be associated with Cushing’s syndrome,
due to ectopic tumour ACTH production.

Investigations
• CXR may reveal a well-deﬁned tumour, which should be further
characterized on CT. Tumourlets is the description given to multiple
endobronchial or parenchymal carcinoid tumours. PET has decreased
sensitivity for detecting carcinoid tumours compared with NSCLC
(75% in one study)
• Bronchoscopy is performed for accessible endobronchial carcinoid
tumours. They typically appear to be intraluminal, cherry red, and
covered with intact epithelium. Bronchial brushings may be adequate
for a histological diagnosis. Bronchial biopsy can be associated with
brisk or torrential bleeding, so care should be taken. Some avoid biopsy
altogether and proceed to surgical resection based on a clinical
diagnosis. CT-guided biopsy may be preferred for peripheral tumours
• Histological diagnosis can be difﬁcult as the appearances can be similar
to those of small cell lung cancer. Special stains and immunohistochemistry are used to help differentiate between the two. Clinically,
however, these tend to be quite different conditions and clinical details
can aid pathological diagnosis. Carcinoid tumours are characterized as
being typical or atypical. They each have a characteristic pattern:
• Typical carcinoids have no necrosis, occasional nuclear pleomorphism, and absent or late mitoses. Distant metastases are rare and
metastasis to lymph nodes occurs in 5–15% of cases. The 5-year
survival is 100% and 10-year survival is 87%
• Atypical carcinoids may show focal necrosis and often have nuclear
pleomorphism. There is increased mitotic activity. They have distant
metastases in 20% and metastasize to the lymph nodes in up to 48%
of cases. The 5-year survival is 69% and 10-year survival is 52%

PULMONARY CARCINOID TUMOURS

Management
• Patients with isolated pulmonary carcinoid tumours should be
considered for surgical resection. Resection is ideally limited, removing
minimal amounts of normal lung parenchyma. Tumour resection is
associated with resolution of any features of the carcinoid syndrome
• If the tumour is atypical or close to the resection margin, patients
should be followed up with repeat CXR on an annual basis.
Radiotherapy is not performed
• Tumour size does not relate to the presence of lymph node metastases
and therefore local lymph nodes should be sampled peri-operatively
• In the 1% with carcinoid syndrome, serotonin antagonists, such as
octreotide, can be used for treatment. Isolated liver metastases can
be treated with arterial embolization. Metastatic aggressive carcinoid
tumours can be treated with chemotherapy, such as etoposide,
cisplatin, 5-ﬂuorouracil, and streptozotocin.

CHAPTER 31

Lung cancer

Pulmonary nodules 1
Deﬁnition These are focal, round, or oval areas of increased opacity
in the lung, measuring less than 3 cm in diameter. They are detected on
CXR or CT. Greater use of CT and thinner slice spiral CT scanning has
led to increased detection rates. CT allows the precise localization of a
nodule and reliable determination of its features. It has a high sensitivity
of detecting nodules of >5 mm in diameter. Volumetric analysis using
CT-aided software means that a 3D nodule can be simulated, to aid nodule
characterization and assess whether its volume has increased over time.

Solitary metastasis

Bronchial adenoma
Benign hamartoma (developmental abnormality,
containing cartilage, epithelium, and fat. Can contain
smooth muscle. Slow growing. Can be seen at any
age, especially 40+; often calcify.)

• The majority of pulmonary nodules are benign, although exact numbers
depend on the characteristics of the population screened
• 20–30% of patients with lung cancer may present with a solitary
pulmonary nodule
• Of the nodules detected on CT in smokers with a normal CXR,
between 1% and 2.5% will be malignant
• The Early Lung Cancer Action Project screening programme in the
USA used CT scans in over-60-year-olds, with at least a 10-pack year
history of smoking, and found non-calciﬁed nodules in 23%, which were
seen on CXR in 7%. 11% of these nodules were malignant on biopsy
• Early detection of these malignant nodules might alter the management
of the patient, with surgical resection of a stage 1 cancer.

PULMONARY NODULES 1

Management options for patients with pulmonary nodules
Observation Baseline CT scan showing nodule ≥ 4 mm, then repeat after
an arbitrary time interval, such as 3 and 12 months, or 3, 6, and 12 months.
If the nodule has increased in size or shows features of malignancy, consider biopsy or proceed straight to surgical resection. PET scan may be
helpful in combination with CT if the nodule is indeterminate or increasing
in size, but cannot be biopsied.
CT-PET scan useful in lesions >7 mm
Biopsy Difﬁcult on small nodules <7 mm, and those behind a rib or
scapula.
Resection If nodule has features of malignancy and biopsy not possible.
Local practice varies.
Chemotherapy or radiotherapy If nodule proven to be malignant, but surgical treatment is not indicated due to performance status.

Stable or decreasing size for 2 years
Nodule resolves during follow-up
Non-smoker
Lack of enhancement with contrast
Smooth, well-deﬁned margins (although 21% of smooth nodules may

Benign pattern of calciﬁcation: central, diffuse solid, laminated, or
‘popcorn like’—related to prior infections or calciﬁcation in a hamartoma
Intranodular fat—likely hamartoma
Cavitation with thin smooth walls
Younger age
Resident in histoplasmosis endemic areas, such as North America.

Pulmonary nodule with extrathoracic malignancy
In a patient with pre-existing malignancy, a pulmonary nodule could be a
metastasis, new lung cancer, or benign disease. The histology of the extrapulmonary neoplasm and the patient’s smoking history inﬂuence this.
These cases need discussion within the cancer MDT to determine whether
nodule biopsy or treatment of the underlying primary cancer would be the
most appropriate management.
One study determined the likelihood of a pulmonary nodule being a
new primary or metastasis based on the site of the original cancer:
• New lung primary more likely if the primary tumour is head and neck,
bladder, breast, bile ducts, oesophagus, ovary, prostate, stomach
• Metastasis more likely if the primary tumour is melanoma,
sarcoma, testes
• Either new primary or metastasis possible if the primary tumour
is salivary gland, adrenal, colon, parotid, kidney, thyroid,
thymus, uterus.

Lung cancer

Lung cancer screening
This is an area that is currently under investigation. Screening programmes
are based on the premise that the early detection of lung cancer and any
subsequent intervention will improve the patient’s survival. There is no
evidence yet of reduction in lung cancer mortality from screening studies.
To be detectable on CXR, a lung cancer needs to be 1 cm diameter, and
3–4 mm diameter to be detectable on CT.

Screening studies
• Four previous CXR screening studies in the 1970s were negative, of
which the Mayo Lung Project has been the most studied. This
compared 4-monthly CXR and sputum cytology for 6 years in smokers
45 years old or older of 20+ per day, with infrequent or no screening in
a control group. 206 cancers were found in the study group and 160 in
the control group, but all-cause mortality was not affected by screening,
even at 20 years
• More recent studies have used low-dose spiral CT scanning. The Early
Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP) in New York recruited 1000
symptom-free volunteers aged 60+ with a 10 pack-year history of
smoking, who would be ﬁt for a thoracotomy. There was no control
group. Baseline CXR and CT were performed. Non-calciﬁed nodules
were present in 23% of patients at baseline on CT. Repeat CT was
performed for nodules <5 mm; nodules >6 mm were biopsied and
nodules >11 mm received standard care. 2.7% of all the patients
entered had malignant nodules with stage 1 disease in 2.3%. All but one
patient had their cancer surgically resected
• International ELCAP screened 31 567 asymptomatic over-40-year-olds
at risk for lung cancer between 1993 and 2005. The median age was 61.
13% had a positive result requiring follow-up at baseline CT and 5% at
annual CT. Lung cancer was diagnosed in 1.5% of people (85% stage 1),
with 411 having resection and 57 having radiotherapy ± chemotherapy.
There was no non-treatment randomized control group, so it is still
difﬁcult to interpret whether the earlier diagnosis and intervention led
to longer survival. (Henschke CI et al. NEJM 2006;355:1763-71)
• Further research is needed to demonstrate a clear detection survival
beneﬁt, before national screening programmes are instituted.
• Large randomized studies of CT vs. CXR are ongoing and the results
are awaited. The role of PET in screening also needs to be evaluated.

CHAPTER 32

Lung transplantation

Patient selection
Lung transplantation was ﬁrst performed successfully in the early 1980s,
and since then the number of candidates for transplantation has increased
signiﬁcantly. However, there is a signiﬁcant shortage of donor organs, and
so an increasing number of patients (up to 10–15%) die on the waiting
list. There are ﬁve transplant centres in the UK: Hareﬁeld, Papworth,
Birmingham, Manchester, and Newcastle. Approximately 100 lung transplants and 50 heart–lung transplants are carried out in the UK annually.
Average waiting times in the UK are around 12 months for lung transplantation and 16 months for heart–lung transplantation. Matching is
carried out according to size and major blood groups; HLA matching is
not carried out.

Underlying conditions Most common diagnoses, in order:
COPD (including A1-antitrypsin deﬁciency)
Cystic ﬁbrosis
Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis
Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
Pulmonary hypertension secondary to congenital cardiac disease
(Eisenmenger’s syndrome)
- Others, including sarcoidosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Langerhans’
cell histiocytosis, collagen vascular disease-related lung disease,
bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma (successful transplantation has been
carried out, although tumour recurrence in the donor lung is common).

-

Indications Referral for transplant assessment should be considered
in patients with chronic end-stage lung disease despite maximal medical
therapy, whose life expectancy is 2–3 years or less (so that transplantation
would be expected to prolong their survival). Candidates should be functionally disabled but still able to walk, with no signiﬁcant cardiac, renal,
or hepatic impairment. Suggested age limits are 55 years for heart–lung,
60 years for bilateral lung, and 65 years for single lung transplant.
General referral criteria for lung transplantation
-

Normal renal function, with creatinine clearance >50 mL/min
Normal left ventricular function and normal coronary arteries
Preserved liver synthetic function
No osteoporosis
No systemic sepsis
BMI >17
No psychiatric disorder
No history of malignancy within 5 years.

PATIENT SELECTION

Contraindications
Absolute
- Severe extrapulmonary organ dysfunction (including renal, hepatic, and
cardiac disease)
- Active cancer or recent history (within 2 years) of cancer with substantial
likelihood of recurrence; a 5-year disease-free interval is recommended
(excluding cutaneous squamous or basal cell carcinomas)
- Severe psychiatric illness or non-compliance with treatment/follow-up
- Incurable chronic extrapulmonary infection (including HIV, active
hepatitis B and C)
- Active or recent (6 months) substance addiction (cigarette smoking,
alcohol, narcotics)
- Signiﬁcant chest wall/spinal deformity
Relative
- Age >65 years
- Chronic medical conditions that are poorly controlled or associated
with target-organ damage (hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery
disease)
- Severe or symptomatic osteoporosis (risk of post-transplant fractures
and poor quality of life; start treatment prior to transplant)
- Daily requirement for >20 mg prednisolone
- Severe obesity (BMI >30) or malnutrition (BMI <17)
- Inability to walk, with poor rehabilitation potential
- Mechanical ventilation (excluding NIV) or acute critical illness
- Extensive pleural thickening (from infection or prior surgery,
e.g. pleurodesis)—procedure is technically more difﬁcult
- Active collagen vascular disease
- Pre-operative colonization of the airway with pan-resistant bacteria, fungi,
or mycobacterium in cystic ﬁbrosis: there are no clear data to support
exclusion of pan-resistant Pseudomonas, although it remains a relative
contraindication in some centres. B. cepacia colonization (particularly
with genomovar III), however, is high risk and an absolute contraindication
in many centres
Contentious
- Non-tuberculous mycobacterium, especially M. chelonae
- Aspergilloma (ABPA is not generally a contraindication, though patients
would not be transplanted during an exacerbation, and would be
treated with prophylactic voriconazole)
- Portal hypertension (prophylactic variceal sclerotherapy may be
offered).

CHAPTER 32

Lung transplantation

Speciﬁc conditions
Timing of referral This can be difﬁcult; life expectancy should be <2–3
years, but patients must be ﬁt for the procedure during a waiting time of
up to 16 months. The decision should not be based on a single factor;
instead, a combination of clinical, laboratory, and functional assessments
should be considered. Patients with CF and IPF have particularly high
waiting list mortalities, suggesting inappropriately late referral for these
conditions. Disease-speciﬁc guidelines for referral:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- BODE index (incorporating BMI, FEV1, degree of dyspnoea, and 6-min
walk; p 169) >5
- History of hospitalization for exacerbation associated with acute
hypercapnia (PaCO2 >6.7kPa; 49% 2-year survival)
- Pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale, despite oxygen therapy
- FEV1 <20% predicted and either TLCO <20% or homogeneous
distribution of emphysema (median survival 3 years with medical
therapy)
- Patients should be on maximal medical therapy, have completed
pulmonary rehabilitation, have stopped smoking for at least 6 months
(if in doubt, check urinary cotinine levels), and ideally <60 years old
Cystic ﬁbrosis
- Deﬁning referral criteria is especially difﬁcult for patients with CF, due
to considerable inter-individual variation in course and prognosis
- FEV1 ≤30% predicted or FEV1 >30% with rapid progressive deterioration,
e.g. increasing frequency of exacerbations, rapid fall in FEV1
- History of ITU admission for pulmonary exacerbation
- Oxygen-dependent respiratory failure, hypercapnia, or pulmonary
hypertension
- Severe recurrent haemoptysis despite embolization
- Refractory and/or recurrent pneumothorax
- Young (<20 years) female patients with rapid deterioration have a poor
prognosis and should be considered for early referral
- Invasive ventilation is a contraindication in most centres
Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis
- Given the poor prognosis and high waiting-list mortality associated
with IPF, guidelines recommend referral of all suitable patients with
histological or radiographic evidence of UIP, irrespective of vital
capacity and without delaying for trials of treatment; these are not
widely applied in the UK
- TLCO <40% predicted, fall in FVC ≥ 10% over 6 months, oxygen
desaturation <88% on 6-min walk, honeycombing on HRCT (each
associated with high mortality)

SPECIFIC CONDITIONS

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
• New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV, rapidly
progressive disease/failing medical therapy, low (<350 m) or declining
6-min walk test, mean right atrial pressure >15 mmHg, cardiac index
<2 L/min/m2.

321

322

CHAPTER 32

Lung transplantation

Investigations and surgical approaches
Investigations prior to referral Consult transplant referral centre
for details and avoid repetition of investigations. Important investigations
include full PFTs, tests of exercise performance (e.g. 6-min walk), sputum
microbiology, ECG, echo, HRCT chest, LFTs, viral serology (e.g. HIV, CMV,
hepatitis B and C), 24-h creatinine clearance, stress echo, and/or coronary
angiography. If on waiting list, inform transplant centre of changes in clinical
condition. Remember that the referring physician remains responsible
for continuing regular medical care of the patient, to ensure they remain
optimally treated during the waiting period, with particular attention to:
- Maintenance of nutrition (may require PEG feeding)
- Avoidance of obesity
- Maintenance of mobility, continuing exercise and rehabilitation
- Monitoring comorbid disease: heart, kidney, liver, bones. Optimize
treatment of diabetes, systemic hypertension, osteoporosis, peptic
ulcer disease, gastro-oesophageal reﬂux and sinus disease
- Early NIV if indicated
- Avoiding intubation, if possible.
Surgical approaches for transplant
Single lung (50% of procedures)
- Technically easier, allows two recipients from one donor
- Used successfully in all patients except CF and bronchiectasis
- Over-distension of the compliant native lung in emphysema is
uncommon, but may be problematic
Bilateral sequential (25%)
- Sequential right and left single lung transplants at one time
- Selective lung ventilation may render cardiopulmonary bypass
unnecessary
Heart–lung (25%)
- Indicated in Eisenmenger’s syndrome, or advanced lung disease with
concurrent LV dysfunction or coronary disease
- Cor pulmonale is not in itself an indication, as right ventricular hypertrophy resolves rapidly following lung transplantation alone
- Certain patients without cardiac disease may undergo a ‘domino’ procedure, where they receive a combined heart–lung transplant, because
this is technically easier, and their healthy heart is then used for a
patient needing a heart transplant
Living lobar transplantation
- Bilateral grafting of lower lobes from two living adult donors to replace
lungs of child or small adult
- Appears to be safe for the donor, with lung volume reductions of
about 15%, but potential for 300% overall mortality (2 donors and
one recipient)
- Not widely performed in the UK

CHAPTER 32

Lung transplantation

Follow-up
Patients are usually discharged about one month after transplant, following
post-transplant bronchoscopy with BAL and biopsy. They will be followed up closely by their transplant centre, but may also attend general
respiratory clinics intermittently between transplant centre visits. Be
alert to possible complications (pp 326–9). Spirometric values are generally very stable from 3 months after transplantation, and sustained falls
≥10–15% warrant further investigation. Remember drug interactions
(particularly ciclosporin and tacrolimus) if new medications are added.
Check immunosuppressant drug blood levels and perform routine blood
tests according to the local transplant centre policy.

Outcomes
Survival
- Survival rates: 85% 1-year, 63% 3-year, 50% 5-year. Median survival is
4.5 years
- Compared with patients on the waiting list, lung transplant conveys a
survival beneﬁt to patients with CF and IPF, but not emphysema
- Rate of death is highest in ﬁrst year (infection, primary graft failure)
- Risk factors for early death are pre-existing pulmonary hypertension,
ventilator dependence, recipient age >50, donor age >50
- No survival difference between single- and double-lung transplant.
Functional
- Lung function usually normalizes after bilateral transplant and markedly
improves following single-lung transplant. In COPD, FEV1 increases to
50–60% of predicted value after single-lung transplant
- Arterial oxygenation rapidly normalizes
- 6-min walk distance typically doubles; most patients resume active lifestyle although fewer than 40% of patients return to work
- Limited data on quality of life: initial improvement suggested, but effects
after 1 year are unclear.

Routine surgery after lung transplant
Routine surgery >3 months after transplant can be carried out locally, but
inform the transplant centre. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is adequate;
there is no increased risk of SBE. The morning dose of calcineurin inhibitor
(ciclosporin, tacrolimus) should be omitted, as there is a risk of nephrotoxicity with hypovolaemia.

Future developments are likely to address both the shortage of
donor organs (e.g. living lobar transplantation, the ‘non-heart beating
donor’, xenotransplantation, and further research in lung preservation)
and the development of more effective treatments for chronic rejection
(new immunosuppressive drugs, induction of immune tolerance).

326

CHAPTER 32

Lung transplantation

Complications 1
Early graft dysfunction
- Characterized by pulmonary inﬁltrates, hypoxaemia, and diffuse alveolar
damage or organizing pneumonia on biopsy; not uncommon during
ﬁrst few days after transplant. Clinical severity ranges from very mild
acute lung injury to acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Presumably related to preservation and ischaemia–reperfusion injury
- Exclude other causes, e.g. volume overload, pneumonia, rejection,
occlusion of venous anastomosis, aspiration
- Treatment is supportive (mechanical ventilation)
- High mortality (40–60%).

Airway complications
- Anastomotic stenosis most common and typically occurs weeks–
months after transplant; suggested clinically by localized wheeze,
recurrent pneumonia, or suboptimal lung function. Treat with stent
placement via bronchoscopy
- Complete dehiscence of bronchial anastomosis now rare, and requires
immediate surgery or retransplantation
- Partial dehiscence is managed conservatively: drain pneumothorax,
reduce steroid dose.

Infection
Bacteria
- May occur early (ﬁrst month after transplant) or late (associated with
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome)
- Most commonly due to Gram-negative organisms, particularly
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- Recipients with cystic ﬁbrosis are not at greater risk than other patients;
an exception is B. cepacia colonization, which is associated with a high
risk of often lethal postoperative infections.
CMV
- CMV-seronegative recipients from seropositive donors are at particular
risk of severe infection, including pneumonitis; this is usually treated
successfully with ganciclovir
- Increases risk of bacterial or fungal superinfection
- Ganciclovir prophylaxis probably results in later, less severe infection.
- CMV infection may be a risk factor for development of bronchiolitis
obliterans syndrome.

COMPLICATIONS 1

Aspergillus
- Aspergillus frequently colonizes the airways after lung transplant, but
clinically apparent infection develops in only a minority of patients
- Peak disease incidence at 2 months after transplant
- Sites of disease include airways (may lead to mucosal oedema,
ulceration, and pseudomembranes; usually responds to itraconazole,
voriconazole, or amphotericin B), fresh bronchial anastomosis, lung
parenchyma, and disseminated aspergillosis (associated with high
mortality).

Drug-related Immunosuppressive drugs must be taken lifelong following
transplantation. Agents used include ciclosporin or tacrolimus, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. They are associated
with many drug interactions and side-effects, particularly nephrotoxicity
and osteoporosis. Ciclosporin and tacrolimus blood levels need to be
closely monitored.

CHAPTER 32

Lung transplantation

Complications 2
Acute rejection
- Very common, particularly within 3 months of transplant. Rare after
12 months
- Asymptomatic, or may be associated with malaise, fever, dyspnoea,
cough, hypoxia. May present similarly to pneumonia or COP
- CXR may be normal or show non-speciﬁc inﬁltrates
- Common ﬁnding is fall in spirometry >10%, although this does not
distinguish from other complications, particularly infection
- Refer back to the transplant centre if these problems develop within
3 months of the transplant
- Ideally conﬁrm histologically: transbronchial biopsies are safe and
typically show perivascular lymphocytic inﬁltrates. Routine surveillance
transbronchial biopsies are increasingly used to detect acute rejection
prior to falls in lung function.
- Treatment IV methylprednisolone pulses. The majority of patients
respond quickly; consider switch in immunosuppressive agent from
cyclosporin A to tacrolimus if ongoing or recurrent acute rejection
- Acute rejection is the main risk factor for the development of chronic
rejection
- Acute rejection is an uncommon cause of breathlessness after
3 months and other common causes of SOB should be considered.

Chronic rejection
- A signiﬁcant problem, accounting for poor long-term prognosis
following lung transplant
- Uncommon in ﬁrst 6 months, but prevalence subsequently increases
steadily, affecting 50–60% of patients at 5 years
- Pathogenesis incompletely understood, likely involves immune-mediated
injury to epithelial and endothelial cells, possibly with an environmental
trigger; risk factors for development include previous episodes of
acute rejection, CMV pneumonitis, presence of anti-HLA antibodies
pre-transplant, and perhaps gastro-oesophageal reﬂux, community
respiratory virus infection, and medical non-compliance
- Clinically Insidious onset of breathlessness and cough, and progressive
airﬂow obstruction on spirometry
- Manifest histologically as bronchiolitis obliterans, a ﬁbroproliferative
process affecting small airways. Histological conﬁrmation is difﬁcult:
transbronchial biopsies have a low sensitivity, so a clinical diagnosis of
‘bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)’ is deﬁned as an unexplained
and sustained (≥3 weeks) fall in FEV1 to <80% of peak value posttransplant. ‘Potential BOS’ is deﬁned as FEV1 81–90% of baseline and/or
forced mid-expiratory ﬂow (FEV25–75%) to ≤75% of baseline, and
indicates the need for close monitoring/further investigation
- CXR unhelpful; HRCT may show expiratory air trapping and peripheral
bronchiectasis
- P. aeruginosa colonization is common, with recurrent purulent
tracheobronchitis

COMPLICATIONS 2

- Treatment is challenging, and involves either modiﬁed or increased
immunosuppression (e.g. switch ciclosporin to tacrolimus; high-dose
steroid pulses and antilymphocyte antibodies; inhaled cyclosporin
may have a role), and if effective this acts only to reduce the rate of
disease progression. Infection is investigated and treated aggressively,
sometimes with reductions in immunosuppression. Azithromycin is
often used for deteriorating BOS. Gastro-oesophageal reﬂux is treated,
sometimes with surgery. Total lymphoid irradiation is sometimes
recommended when other immunomodulatory treatments have failed
- Prognosis is poor: mortality is 40% within 2 years of diagnosis; the rate
of decline is very variable between individuals
- Retransplantation is the only deﬁnitive treatment and is controversial.

Recurrence of primary disease Documented in sarcoidosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, giant cell interstitial pneumonitis, diffuse pan-bronchiolitis,
and bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma.
Malignancy Increased risk of certain malignancies, e.g. lymphoma (and
other EBV-related post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases), skin, lip,
vulval, and perineal carcinomas, in situ cervical cancer, and Kaposi’s sarcoma.
- Most lymphomas appear within the ﬁrst year, and the lung allograft
is the most common site of involvement, with pulmonary nodule(s)
± mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Lymphocyte aggregates from acute
rejection may mimic the appearance of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease on small transbronchial biopsy specimens. Lymphomas
presenting after the ﬁrst year are more commonly disseminated or
intra-abdominal (e.g. presenting with tonsillar enlargement, peripheral
lymphadenopathy, skin nodules, or bowel complications such as intussusception). Patients should be referred back to the transplant centre
for treatment, rather than the local haematologist. The usual treatment
is a reduction in immunosuppression or rituximab (monoclonal antibody against CD20 on B cells)
- Lung cancer occurs in patients with COPD and IPF. Unclear if transplantation itself increases the risk of lung cancer. May progress unusually
rapidly, mimicking infection.
Differential diagnosis of CXR nodules following
lung transplant
-

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease
Infection (Pseudomonas, Nocardia, aspergilloma, TB)
Disease recurrence
Primary lung cancer.

CHAPTER 33

Mediastinal abnormalities

The mediastinum is the area within the centre of the chest containing the
heart, great vessels, nerves, lymph nodes, trachea, oesophagus, and thymus.
Two-thirds of mediastinal masses are benign. Age 20–40, presence of symptoms and anterior location of a mass are all associated with an increased
likelihood of malignancy. Common symptoms of mediastinal disease include
cough, chest pain, and dyspnoea, as well as symptoms relating to any structure being compressed, such as dysphagia, stridor, or SVCO. Mediastinal
disorders can also be asymptomatic. They may be found incidentally following a CXR.

Anatomy
Anterior mediastinum The area behind the body of the sternum and in
front of the ﬁbrous pericardium. Contains the thymus, which also extends
superiorly.
Posterior mediastinum The area in front of the vertebral bodies and behind
the ﬁbrous pericardium. Contains the spinal nerve roots, the descending
aorta and oesophagus, the azygos and hemiazygos veins, the thoracic duct,
and vagus and splanchnic nerves.
Superior mediastinum The area located between the thoracic inlet superiorly, the manubrium of the sternum anteriorly, by the superior 4 thoracic
vertebrae posteriorly and inferiorly where a horizontal plane would cross
through the sternal angle. It contains the aortic arch and its large branches
and the upper half of SVC. It also contains the trachea, the oesophagus,
the thoracic duct, and the phrenic, vagus, cardiac, and left recurrent laryngeal nerves.
Middle mediastinum The area containing the heart and pericardium, the
ascending aorta, the lower half of the SVC, part of the azygos vein, the
pulmonary arteries and veins, the tracheal bifurcation, phrenic nerves, and
the IVC.
These areas are easily seen on a lateral CXR.

333

334

CHAPTER 33

Mediastinal abnormalities

Mediastinal abnormalities 1
Neural tumours mostly occur in the posterior mediastinum. 75% are
benign in adults.
- Schwannomas and neuroﬁbromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath
tumours. They may be multiple. Usually asymptomatic, although
can cause segmental pain. Slowly enlarge and, rarely, can cause cord
compression, with dumb-bell shaped tumours straddling the
intervertebral foramen. Can be surgically excised
- Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours or neurosarcomas include
new malignant growths and benign neuroﬁbromas that have undergone
malignant change. They may cause systemic features of malignancy and
can invade locally and metastasize
- Autonomic nervous system tumours including neuroblastomas and
ganglioneuromas, range from benign to malignant. Surgical removal is
the treatment of choice, with radiotherapy and chemotherapy if the
tumour is malignant.
Thymoma Tumour of epithelial origin arising in the thymus. May contain
functioning thymic tissue. M = F. Rare below age 20. Myasthenia gravis is
present in 30–40% of patients with a thymoma; this is often unimproved
after thymectomy and may even develop after the thymoma is removed.
20% of patients presenting with myasthenia gravis are found to have a
thymoma, particularly if patients are over 50 and male. This group is likely
to have positive acetylcholine receptor (AChR) autoantibodies, which
bind to AChRs at the postsynaptic motor endplate, decreasing available
acetylcholine binding sites, causing nerve fatigability.
Patients with thymomas are usually symptomatic with pain, dyspnoea,
dysphagia, or myasthenia gravis symptoms. Thymomas contained within
the thymic capsule tend to be benign, although they do have malignant
potential; those that have extended outside the capsule are malignant, and
may involve local structures or metastasize. Diagnose with CT and treat
with surgical excision of the thymus, avoiding prior FNA or biopsy as this
may cause tumour seeding outside the capsule. Consider post-operative
radiotherapy and chemotherapy for invasive tumours, especially those not
completely excised. Thymectomy is indicated in patients with myasthenia
gravis even without thymoma, as it may lead to symptomatic improvement.
This gives best results in those with detectable AChR antibody levels and
younger patients early in the disease course, particularly those with severe
disease.

Thymic cyst may be congenital or acquired secondary to inﬂammation.
Asymptomatic unless large and causing symptoms of compression. Benign,
but usually treated with surgical excision, as diagnostic certainty may be
difﬁcult.

Thymic carcinoid Not associated with myasthenia gravis and behaves
aggressively, with local recurrence and metastasis. May be associated with
Cushing’s syndrome. Treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or octreotide.
Also: thymic carcinoma, thymic lipoma, and thymic hyperplasia.

MEDIASTINAL ABNORMALITIES 1

Germ cell tumours Arise from immature germ cells, which fail
to migrate during development. Tend to be in an anterior and mid-line
location.
- Mature cystic teratomas represent 80% of germ cell tumours. These
are benign and occur in young adults. M = F. Often asymptomatic, but
can erode surrounding structures and cause symptoms. CXR shows
well-deﬁned mass, which may contain ﬂecks of calciﬁcation. Treatment
is by surgical excision
- Seminoma occurs in men age 20–40 years. Mediastinal seminomas are
malignant and almost always arise within the thymus and are
histologically indistinguishable from those occurring in the testes.
Can be primary mediastinal tumour or metastasis from testicular
tumour; therefore always examine testes. Patients frequently present
with chest pain. CXR shows non-calciﬁed lobulated anterior
mediastinal mass, conﬁrmed with CT. Serum AFP is normal and this aids
diagnosis. Diagnose with surgical biopsy. Surgical excision is not
recommended as is usually incomplete. Treatment is with cisplatinbased chemotherapy initially, which can cause infertility and therefore
patients may wish to consider sperm banking before treatment.
Tumours are radiosensitive, so radiotherapy used if they are bulky.
Long-term survival expected in 80%. Better prognosis than
non-seminomatous germ cell tumours
- Non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (including choriocarcinoma,
teratocarcinoma, and yolk sac tumours) are all malignant and occur in
men in their 30s. They are symptomatic due to local invasion and they
metastasize. CXR shows mediastinal mass and diagnosis is with surgical
biopsy. BHCG and AFP are raised. Treatment is with cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. BHCG and AFP are markers of disease and fall with
tumour response.

Thyroid Retrosternal goitre occurs, especially in older women. Usually
asymptomatic unless large and compressing the trachea, causing dyspnoea
and stridor. May be seen on plain CXR. CT and radioactive iodine isotope
scans are helpful in diagnosis. Flow–volume loops are abnormal if there is
tracheal compression. Surgery is recommended if there is airway compromise, but can lead to tracheomalacia afterwards.
Also: parathyroid adenoma

335

336

CHAPTER 33

Mediastinal abnormalities

Mediastinal abnormalities 2
Lymphoma The mediastinum is frequently involved in patients with
Hodgkin’s lymphoma. CT scan is necessary to assess the extent of this and
to assess response to treatment. To establish the histological diagnosis of
lymphoma, an adequate tissue sample is required; this should be from a
biopsy, rather than a ﬁne-needle aspirate. This may be best achieved surgically, via mediastinoscopy. Examine patient for peripheral lymph nodes, as
these may be easier to biopsy. Treatment is with chemotherapy initially.

Enlarged lymph nodes
- Metastases from breast, lung, and oesophageal cancer
- Castleman’s disease Giant lymph node hyperplasia. Rare. Two forms:
• Angio-follicular hyperplasia causing mediastinal or hilar lymph node
mass. Often asymptomatic or may cause cough or wheeze due to
localized compression. Non-progressive. May have fever and raised
ESR. Nodal biopsy shows follicles of pericapillary lymphocytes and
proliferation of the plump and eosinophilic capillary endothelial
cells. Removal of nodes may improve symptoms. Can also occur on
pleura
• Multicentric Castleman’s disease is a more aggressive disease that
may occur in association with HIV infection. Lymphoproliferative
disorder with prominent systemic symptoms, as well as generalized
lymph node enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly, paraproteinaemia,
and skin rash. Biopsy shows prominent plasma cell inﬁltration.
Related to IL-6 over-production and human herpes virus-8 infection.
Treatment is with steroids ± chemotherapy (doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide), but prognosis is poor. Can progress to
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Rapidly fatal without treatment
Also: lymphangioma

Cysts
- Foregut duplications or bronchogenic cysts can be related to the
oesophagus or the airways, especially near the carina. Lined by respiratory epithelium. Often diagnosed in childhood, as they cause dyspnoea,
stridor, or cough due to limited space to expand. Seen on CXR and CT
and treated with surgical excision
- Pleuropericardial cysts mostly occur at the cardiophrenic angles and
can measure up to 25 cm diameter. M = F. Usually asymptomatic, but
may cause chest pain. CXR shows smooth round shadow abutting the
heart. Excision can be carried out at thoracoscopy, but conservative
management is favoured. Also known as springwater cysts.

MEDIASTINAL ABNORMALITIES 2

Inﬂammation
- Mediastinitis occurs after oesophageal perforation or rupture, due
to malignancy, instrumentation, or vomiting (Boerhaave’s syndrome).
Patients are ill, with pain and fever. CXR may show widened mediastinum or air in the mediastinum. Pneumothorax or pleural effusion
may also be seen. Treatment includes repairing the defect, parenteral
feeding, and antibiotics. High morbidity and mortality
- Mediastinal ﬁbrosis Rare idiopathic condition that occurs in middle age.
Symptoms depend on which aspects of the mediastinum are involved,
but may include dyspnoea, wheeze, haemoptysis, hoarse
voice, dysphagia, pulmonary hypertension, SVCO. CXR shows a
widened mediastinum. Diagnosis made on biopsy, particularly to
exclude malignancy. Treatment is supportive; steroids and surgical
debulking ineffective. Prognosis variable, depending on sites involved.
May be associated with retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis, radiotherapy, methysergide, auto-immune disease, or infection with TB, histoplasmosis,
Aspergillus, or Nocardia.

Mediastinal emphysema or pneumomediastinum. Can be caused by
sneezing, straining, Valsalva manoeuvres, vomiting, substance abuse, parturition, positive pressure ventilation, instrumentation, or trans-bronchial
biopsy. Usually symptomless, but occasional pain. Hamman’s sign may be
present (click with each heart beat on auscultation over lung). Treat with
high-ﬂow oxygen. Resolves spontaneously.

Vascular Aortic aneurysms are usually asymptomatic, but symptoms
relate to compression of adjacent structures. May diagnose on CXR as a
widened mediastinum. This is best imaged via CT or MRI. Surgery should
be considered to prevent death from rupture.

CHAPTER 34

Paediatric lung disorders

This chapter concentrates on pulmonary conditions that occur in childhood and may become increasingly relevant to adult practice.

Chronic lung disease of prematurity
Chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD), formerly known as
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Advances in neonatal medicine have
led to the improved survival of premature babies with immature lungs and
respiratory disease. Babies born at lower gestational ages are surviving
into adulthood, due to therapy with antenatal steroids to prevent respiratory distress syndrome and the use of artiﬁcial surfactant to decrease the
surface tension of the neonatal alveolar membrane. There have also been
improvements in ventilatory techniques. CLD usually occurs in babies who
have been mechanically ventilated.
Usually caused by barotrauma from prolonged ventilation, high-pressure
ventilation, and/or ventilation with high oxygen concentrations.
Typical presentation is a premature baby who remains oxygen-dependent
after 36 weeks post-conceptional age. It is now infrequent in those born
at 30+ weeks and weighing more than 1200 g. Mortality of 25–30% with
severe CLD. May require prolonged home oxygen therapy, up to 1 year or
beyond. 50% of infants with CLD will need hospital re-admission during
their ﬁrst year with respiratory infection. Some may have signiﬁcant pulmonary sequelae during childhood and adolescence, with chronic hypoxia and
pulmonary hypertension, but the majority of children with CLD do not have
signiﬁcant ongoing respiratory symptoms. Children may have disabilities
associated with prematurity, such as cerebral palsy or learning difﬁculties.
Pathology Cytokine-mediated scarring and repair. Early inﬂammatory
phase: bronchial necrosis, alveolar destruction, capillary permeability, and
associated obliterative bronchiolitis. Subacute ﬁbroproliferative phase: type
II pneumocyte hyperplasia, bronchial and bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy, and interstitial and peri-alveolar ﬁbrosis. Chronic ﬁbro-proliferative
phase airway remodelling for up to 1 year. Prior to surfactant use, these
changes were more severe.
PFTs Functional respiratory abnormalities persist with increased airway
resistance and airway hyperresponsiveness. RV and RV/TLC are raised,
indicative of air trapping. Air trapping improves over 3–4 years as lung
growth occurs; however, small airway abnormalities persist, at least until
the age of 10.
Chest radiology Persisting mild to moderate abnormalities, with multi-focal
areas of reduced lung attenuation and perfusion, bronchial wall thickening,
and decreased bronchus:pulmonary artery diameter ratios on CT. These radiological abnormalities correlate with physiological evidence of air trapping.
Adulthood There are few longitudinal studies beyond childhood and it is
unclear what the signiﬁcance of CLD of prematurity is to adult lung disease.

CHAPTER 34

Paediatric lung disorders

Viral wheeze and asthma
A controversial area. Wheezing is common in infants and toddlers, and
is often due to viral respiratory tract infections, causing a viral-induced
wheeze. This has been found to be associated with passive cigarette
smoke exposure, contact with other children, and not being breast-fed.
This transient early wheezing is distinct from childhood asthma. The
children are not atopic and have no family history of such. The wheeze
has resolved usually by the age of 3, although they may persist in having
airway hyperactivity for many years. Children with asthma tend to
have a family history of eczema with concomitant atopic dermatitis
and develop their symptoms at any age, but usually slightly later (by the
age of 5). Half of them have mild symptoms, which regress by puberty.
Those with more severe disease, requiring regular inhaled steroids, often
have disease that persists into adult life. Treatment for young children is
based on persistent symptoms and atopy. Drugs which may be effective
include inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists.

CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES

Congenital abnormalities
Tracheomalacia Floppy trachea, usually associated with oesophageal
atresia. Rarely will require intubation or tracheostomy.
Congenital lobar emphysema Over-inﬂation of a lobe due to localized bronchomalacia or bronchial obstruction. May cause wheeze or
produce chest deformity. Often resolves spontaneously.
Diaphragmatic hernia A diaphragmatic defect, causing bowel to be
present in the chest. This may cause respiratory distress soon after birth
and may have been detected during the antenatal period by USS, or it may
be completely asymptomatic and found incidentally on CXR, with bowel
seen in the chest. There are two types. Bochdalek hernia is the congenital
absence of posterolateral part of diaphragm, with associated hypoplastic
lung due to bowel limiting growth. Treatment is with surgical repair of
the diaphragmatic defect, but survival rate is only 50% due to underlying lung problems. Morgagni hernia is anteromedial herniation through
the foramen of Morgagni, which is more commonly found in adulthood.
It may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms of fullness, tightness, or pain
in the anterior chest; it does not cause intestinal obstruction. CXR shows
a cardiophrenic angle density. Surgical repair is difﬁcult and is usually not
necessary.
Cystic adenomatoid lung Excessive overgrowth of bronchioles with
multiple cysts occurring in a section of lung. Commonly affects left lower
lobe. Can be diagnosed antenatally. Can present in the same way as congenital lobar emphysema. May be mistaken for diaphragmatic hernia.
Treatment is by resection of the affected lobe, but there may be spaceoccupying effects of the abnormal lobe that can cause morbidity and mortality, e.g. due to vena cava obstruction.

Pulmonary sequestration/sequestrated segment Segment of lung
parenchyma with no bronchial connection that is unventilated. May be supplied by aberrant artery from the aorta and have anomalous pulmonary
drainage to the right atrium. Can be intralobar, sharing pleura with the rest
of the lung, or extralobar, which is separated from the lung by a lining of
pleural tissue. Mostly left-sided; 75% are situated between the diaphragm
and left lower lobe. Associated with other congenital abnormalities in 60%
of cases. Can be a chance ﬁnding on CXR at any age, when cystic change
may be seen in this area. Contrast CT or MRI may aid diagnosis. Surgical
resection may be necessary if there is repeated infection in this segment.

MacLeod’s syndrome Focal hyperlucency of lung or lobe, due to
parenchymal and vascular maldevelopment, following a childhood bronchitis or bronchiolitis. Usually asymptomatic, and is diagnosed on CXR,
which shows a hypertranslucent lung with reduced vascular markings and
a small pulmonary artery.

CHAPTER 35

Pleural effusion

Clinical features and imaging
A pleural effusion results from the accumulation of abnormal volumes
(>10–20 ml) of ﬂuid in the pleural space. Pleural effusions are common
and are associated with many different diseases; see Chapter 8 for a stepby-step approach to the diagnosis of a patient with a pleural effusion,
differential diagnosis of transudates and exudates, and details of pleural
ﬂuid analysis.

Clinical features
- May be asymptomatic, or associated with breathlessness, dry cough,
pleuritic chest pain (suggesting pleural inﬂammation), chest ‘heaviness’,
and sometimes pain referred to the shoulder or abdomen
- Signs on examination include reduced chest expansion, reduced tactile
vocal fremitus, a stony dull percussion note, quiet breath sounds, and
sometimes a patch of bronchial breathing above the ﬂuid level.
A friction rub may be heard with pleural inﬂammation.

Imaging
CXR
- Sequential blunting of posterior, lateral, and then anterior costophrenic
angles are seen on radiographs as effusions increase in size
- PA CXR will usually detect effusion volumes of 200 mL or more; lateral
CXR is more sensitive and may detect as little as 50 mL pleural ﬂuid
- Classical CXR appearance is of basal opacity obscuring hemidiaphragm,
with concave upper border. Massive effusion may result in a ‘white-out’
of the hemithorax, with mediastinal displacement away from the
effusion; lack of mediastinal shift in such cases raises the possibility of
associated volume loss due to bronchial obstruction from a primary
lung cancer
- Other CXR appearances include rounded or lentiform shadowing in
loculated interlobar effusions, and diffuse shadowing throughout the
hemithorax on supine ﬁlms
- CXR appearance may suggest the underlying diagnosis, e.g. bilateral
effusions with cardiomegaly in cardiac failure; massive effusions are
most commonly due to malignancy.
Ultrasound is extremely sensitive at detecting ﬂuid volumes of 100 mL
or more, and is useful for distinguishing pleural ﬂuid from pleural masses
or thickening, and for demonstrating loculation.
CT chest with pleural contrast is useful in distinguishing benign and
malignant pleural disease: nodular, mediastinal, or circumferential pleural
thickening are all highly speciﬁc for malignant disease. CT may also reveal
evidence of extrapleural disease, e.g. lymphadenopathy or parenchymal
change, which may suggest a diagnosis such as cancer or tuberculosis.
Role of MRI is unclear; it may have increasing role in distinguishing benign
from malignant pleural disease.

CLINICAL FEATURES AND IMAGING

Pleural thickening
- Pleural ﬁbrosis and thickening may follow previous episodes of pleural
inﬂammation. Causes include previous empyema, tuberculous pleuritis,
rheumatoid pleuritis, haemothorax, thoracotomy, and asbestos
exposure (diffuse pleural thickening, p 111)
- May be asymptomatic or cause breathlessness
- CXR features include blunting of the costophrenic angle or apices,
sometimes with associated calciﬁcation
- Ultrasound or CT may be required to distinguish from a pleural
effusion
- Treatment is difﬁcult and usually unnecessary; decortication may be
considered.

Pleural effusion

Malignant pleural effusion: causes and
investigations
Epidemiology Commonest cause of exudative pleural effusion in
patients older than 60 years. About 40 000 cases of malignant effusion
each year in the UK.

Causes Most malignant effusions are metastatic, with lung and breast the
most common primary sites (Table 35.1).

Other, rarer tumours include sarcoma, melanoma, leukaemia, and
myeloma; almost any malignant tumour may spread to the pleural cavity.
Mesothelioma is an important cause of malignant effusions and is discussed on p 114.

Clinical features Breathlessness is the main symptom; chest pain,
cough, weight loss, and anorexia may also be present. A small proportion
of patients are asymptomatic. Effusions may be unilateral or bilateral, and
are frequently large volume.
Differential diagnosis Consider other potential causes of pleural effusion
in patients known to have cancer, e.g. due to pneumonia, pulmonary
embolism, radiotherapy, pericardial disease, or drugs.

Investigations A strategy for investigating the patient with an undiagnosed pleural effusion is detailed on p 48. Key investigations in patients
suspected to have a malignant effusion are:
1. Pleural ﬂuid cytology Sensitivity for malignancy is about 60%; yield is
increased by analysis of a second, but not a third sample. Immunostaining of
malignant cells may provide clues as to the likely primary site. Visualization
of monoclonal cells in ﬂuid on ﬂow cytometry may support a diagnosis of
lymphoma.
2. CT chest with pleural contrast Nodular, mediastinal, or circumferential
pleural thickening on CT are highly speciﬁc for malignant disease. May also
demonstrate extrapleural disease, e.g. lymphadenopathy.

MALIGNANT PLEURAL EFFUSION: CAUSES AND INVESTIGATIONS

3. Pleural biopsy histology Required in cytology-negative cases. Options:
- CT-guided cutting needle biopsy has been demonstrated to be a more
effective diagnostic test for malignant pleural disease than Abrams’
pleural biopsy (sensitivity 87% in CT-guided biopsy group vs. 47% in
Abrams’ group)
- Ultrasound-guided needle biopsies are also effective and relatively
straightforward to perform
- Thoracoscopy is an extremely useful investigation allowing direct visualization of the pleural space with a high sensitivity (90%) for
biopsies. Therapeutic talc poudrage (talc is ‘puffed’ directly on to the
pleural surfaces) may be performed at same time, with a
pleurodesis success rate >80%. Can be performed under general
anaesthesia, although well tolerated with sedation and local
anaesthesia. Complications (such as empyema) are rare.
Serum tumour markers (CEA, CA19–9, CA15–3, CA125, PSA) may be
helpful in the investigation of patients with malignant effusion of unknown
primary, although their diagnostic and prognostic value are limited.
Prognosis Median survival 3–12 months from diagnosis; shortest in lung
cancer, longest in mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. Pleural ﬂuid pH <7.3
tends to be associated with shorter survival (median survival 2.1 months)
and decreased success of pleurodesis.

CHAPTER 35

Pleural effusion

Malignant pleural effusion:
management
Key points inﬂuencing the management of malignant effusions are:
- Symptoms, performance status, and wishes of the patient
- Sensitivity of the primary tumour to chemotherapy, e.g. small cell lung
carcinoma, lymphoma, ovarian and breast carcinoma may respond to
chemotherapy, although in some cases pleural effusions remain
problematic and require additional treatment
- Extent of lung re-expansion following effusion drainage.

Treatment options
Observation and follow-up if asymptomatic.
Therapeutic pleural aspiration of 1–1.5 L pleural ﬂuid to improve breathlessness. Can be performed at the bedside as a day-case procedure,
avoiding hospital admission. Useful in the palliation of breathlessness in
patients with a poor prognosis and in rare cases where effusion reaccumulates very slowly. Most effusions recur within 1 month of aspiration, and
these patients should be considered for pleurodesis; repeated aspiration
may be inconvenient and uncomfortable for the patient, and carries a risk
of complications such as empyema, pneumothorax, and tumour seeding
(in mesothelioma).
If the breathlessness does not improve following ﬂuid aspiration, then
there is little to be gained by repeated aspiration and other causes of
breathlessness should be considered, e.g. lymphangitis carcinomatosa, pulmonary embolism.
Intercostal chest drainage and pleurodesis The aim of pleurodesis is to
seal the visceral pleura to the parietal pleura with adhesions to prevent
pleural ﬂuid accumulating. The success of pleurodesis depends on the
degree of apposition of the visceral and parietal pleura, which depends
on the degree of lung re-expansion following drainage of the effusion.
‘Trapped lung’ occurs when tumour encases the visceral pleura and prevents lung expansion. Lung expansion may also be inhibited by a proximal
airway obstruction or by a persistent air leak (e.g. after tearing of a friable
tumour-inﬁltrated lung on re-expansion). Trapped lung may also be caused
by non-malignant, ﬁbrotic processes, e.g. rheumatoid pleuritis, haemothorax, tuberculosis.
The patient should be admitted and the effusion drained with an intercostal tube. If lung fully re-expands on CXR, proceed to pleurodesis (see
p 775). If lung fails to re-expand fully (trapped lung; CXR shows a pneumothorax or hydropneumothorax), consider chest drain suction, which
may encourage lung expansion and allow pleurodesis.

MALIGNANT PLEURAL EFFUSION: MANAGEMENT

Treatment options for trapped lung or failed pleurodesis
- Pleurodesis may be successful despite only partial lung re-expansion and
should still be considered. It may be repeated if unsuccessful initially
- Repeated therapeutic pleural aspiration
- Intrapleural ﬁbrinolytics (e.g. streptokinase 250 000 IU) may be of beneﬁt
in the management of multiloculated effusions resistant to drainage and
pleurodesis, encouraging free ﬂuid drainage and in some cases enabling
successful pleurodesis. Haemorrhage is a theoretical complication,
although it appears to be uncommon
- Thoracoscopy enables the disruption of pleural adhesions and may have a
role in facilitating pleurodesis in select patients with trapped lung
- Long-term in-dwelling pleural catheter may be beneﬁcial in patients with
trapped lung and frequent accumulation of symptomatic effusions, and
avoids the need for recurrent pleural aspiration. The most frequent
complications are tumour seeding around the drain site and pleural
space infection. Can be inserted as a day-case procedure. Needs additional out-patient support (e.g. trained district nurse or respiratory
specialist nurse), although most patients perform the drainage themselves after education
- Pleuroperitoneal shunts are effective in patients with trapped lung or
failed pleurodesis, in the absence of multiple loculations. Shunting of
ﬂuid may occur spontaneously, at high pressures, or may require manipulation of a percutaneous pump chamber, inserted at thoracoscopy or
mini-thoracotomy. Main problem is shunt occlusion, which occurs in
at least 10% of cases and necessitates shunt removal. Malignant spread
may also occur
- Surgical parietal pleurectomy may be performed as VATS (video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery). The procedure is effective in the management
of refractory malignant effusions. May be useful in a minority of patients
with good performance status and prognosis. Not suitable for patients
with heavily diseased visceral pleura and trapped lung; consider in
patients who have failed pleurodesis
- Palliative care team involvement should also be considered.

CHAPTER 35

Pleural effusion

Parapneumonic effusion and empyema:
deﬁnition and clinical features
Deﬁnition and pathophysiology Pleural effusions occur in up to 40%
of patients with pneumonia. An initial sterile exudate (simple parapneumonic effusion) may in some cases progress to a complicated parapneumonic effusion and eventually empyema (Fig. 35.1).
Simple parapneumonic Exudative stage
effusion
Clear sterile fluid with normal pH, glucose, LDH
Frequently resolves with antibiotics alone
Drainage not usually required
Complicated
Fibrinopurulent stage
parapneumonic effusion
Fibrin deposited and septations occur
Fluid infected but not yet purulent; appears clear or
cloudy/turbid
pH< 7.2, glucose < 2.2 mmol/L and LDH > 1000IU/L
Gram stain/culture may be positive
Drainage required
Empyema

Pus in pleural space
May be free-flowing or multiloculated
Gram stain/culture may be positive
Drainage required
Eventually, fibroblast growth may result in development
of thick pleural peel (organizing stage). Treatment
at this stage is difficult and decortication may be required

Fig. 35.1 Parapneumonic effusion and empyema: deﬁnition and clinical features.

Pleural infection may also occur in the absence of a preceding pneumonic
illness (‘primary empyema’)

Clinical features
Common
- Consider the diagnosis particularly in cases of ‘slow to respond’
pneumonia, pleural effusion with fever, or high-risk groups with
non-speciﬁc symptoms such as weight loss
- Similar to clinical presentation of pneumonia: fever, sputum production,
chest pain, breathlessness
- Anaerobic empyema may present less acutely, often with weight loss
and without fever.

PARAPNEUMONIC EFFUSION AND EMPYEMA

Rare
- Infected pleural ﬂuid may spontaneously drain through the chest
wall (empyema necessitatis) or into the lung, leading to a
bronchopleural ﬁstula and severe pneumonia
- History of atypical chest pain, vomiting, or oesophageal instrumentation
suggests possible underlying oesophageal rupture (measure pleural
ﬂuid amylase)
- History of a recent sore throat may suggest Lemierre’s syndrome
(acute oropharyngeal infection with Fusobacterium species leads to
septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and subsequent
metastatic infection and abscess formation, commonly in the lungs
and pleura; consider ultrasound of internal jugular vein if suspected);
see p 446.

Risk factors for developing empyema include diabetes, alcohol abuse,
gastro-oesophageal reﬂux, and intravenous drug abuse. Anaerobic infection
is associated particularly with aspiration or poor dental hygiene. Empyema
may rarely occur following bronchial obstruction from a tumour or foreign
body. Many patients, however, have no apparent risk factors.
Differential diagnosis includes malignancy, tuberculosis (when the
pleural ﬂuid is usually lymphocytic), and rheumatoid pleuritis.

353

354

CHAPTER 35

Pleural effusion

Parapneumonic effusion and empyema:
bacteriology and investigations
Bacteriology
- Community-acquired infection (% of cases):
• S. milleri (28%)
• Anaerobes (19%)
• S. pneumoniae (14%)
• Staphylococci (12%)
• Other less common organisms include other streptococci, enterobacteria, H. inﬂuenza, Pseudomonas, TB, and Nocardia. Legionella may
very rarely cause empyema
- Hospital-acquired infection (% of cases):
• MRSA (27%)
• Staphylococci (22%)
• Enterobacteria (20%)
• Enterococci (12%)
• Others include streptococci, Pseudomonas, and anaerobes.
Gram-negative organisms may occur in mixed growths with other
Gram-negatives or with anaerobes.

Investigations
- Diagnostic pleural tap is essential if pleural infection is suspected.
Frankly purulent or turbid/cloudy pleural ﬂuid, organisms on pleural
ﬂuid Gram stain or culture, or pleural ﬂuid pH <7.2 are all indications
for chest tube drainage. 40% of pleural infections are culture-negative.
Identiﬁcation of anaerobes is improved following inoculation of blood
culture bottles with pleural ﬂuid
- Ultrasound typically shows echogenic effusion that may be septated,
and is useful in guiding pleural tap in patients with small or loculated
effusions or following an unsuccessful ‘blind’ tap. Very small effusions
(<10 mm maximal thickness on ultrasound) probably do not require
tapping and can be observed
- Contrast-enhanced CT may be useful both in supporting the diagnosis
and visualizing the distribution of ﬂuid. Empyema is associated with
pleural enhancement and increased attenuation of extrapleural subcostal fat. The displacement of adjacent lung by empyema may help
to distinguish from a parenchymal lung abscess. Empyemas frequently
appear lenticular and may exhibit the ‘split pleura’ sign of enhancing
separated visceral and parietal pleura. Absence of pleural thickening on
CT is unusual in empyema. CT may also sometimes identify a proximal
endobronchial obstructing lesion
- Blood cultures positive in only 13% of cases, but in these cases they are
often the only positive microbiology
- Bronchoscopy is only indicated if a bronchial obstructing lesion is
suspected

CHAPTER 35

Pleural effusion

Parapneumonic effusion and empyema:
management and outcome
Management
1. Antibiotics All patients with pleural infection should be treated with
antibiotics; refer to local hospital prescribing guidelines. Typical choices:
- Community-acquired empyema—second-generation cephalosporin (e.g.
cefuroxime) plus metronidazole as anaerobic cover. Ciproﬂoxacin and
clindamycin together may be appropriate. Add macrolide if Legionella is
suspected
- Hospital-acquired empyema—cover Gram-positive and Gram-negative
organisms and anaerobes. MRSA infection is common. Consult with
microbiology team. One option is meropenem and vancomycin.
Rationalize with culture and sensitivity results (although note that anaerobes
are frequently difﬁcult to culture and may coexist with other organisms).
Avoid aminoglycosides, which penetrate the pleural space poorly.
Switch to oral antibiotics when apyrexial and improving clinically.
Co-amoxiclav is a useful single agent with anaerobic cover (not if penicillin
allergic). Optimal duration of antibiotic treatment unclear, although likely
to be at least 3 weeks.
2. Chest tube drainage

Indications for chest tube drainage
- Frankly purulent or turbid/cloudy pleural ﬂuid
- Organisms on pleural ﬂuid Gram stain or culture
- Pleural ﬂuid pH <7.2
Consider earlier chest tube drainage in the elderly and patients with
comorbidity, and loculated effusions, as these are associated with a worse
outcome.
Drain insertion should ideally be carried out under ultrasound or
CT guidance, as effusions are frequently loculated. Ideal chest tube size
remains subject to debate. Small (10–14 French) ﬂexible tubes are more
comfortable and have been demonstrated to be as effective as large drains
in the management of empyema. Usually apply suction (–20 cm water)
and ﬂush regularly (e.g. 30 ml normal saline every 6 h) to prevent occlusion. Consider drain removal when clinical improvement occurs. If there is
no indication for drainage, give antibiotics and monitor closely. If slow to
improve or deteriorate, re-sample the effusion and consider chest drain.
3. Intrapleural ﬁbrinolytics Current evidence suggests that intrapleural
streptokinase has no effect on mortality, need for surgery, or hospital stay,
and the routine use of ﬁbrinolytics is therefore not recommended.

PARAPNEUMONIC EFFUSION AND EMPYEMA

4. Nutritional support Dietician review, consider supplementary nasogastric feeding. Intravenous feeding may be required.
5. Surgery Consult with thoracic surgeon if there are ongoing features of
sepsis and residual pleural collection after 7 days despite tube drainage
and treatment with antibiotics. Surgical techniques include:
- Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) allows the
breakdown of adhesions and drainage of residual collection, but it is
frequently unsuccessful in chronic empyema with very thickened
visceral pleura
- Thoracotomy and decortication Removal of ﬁbrinous and infected tissue
from the pleural space: a major surgical procedure
- Open thoracic drainage Resection of segments of several ribs adjacent
to the empyema and insertion of large-bore drains into the cavity: a
more minor procedure that can be performed under local anaesthesia,
but results in open chest wound for long period (typically around 5
months).

Difﬁculties in management
Chest drainage ceases despite residual pleural collection
- Attempt to ﬂush drain with normal saline
- Ensure that drain is not kinked at skin insertion site or lying
subcutaneously
- Consider CT to assess extent of residual collection and drain position
- Remove drain if persistently blocked
- Consider further image-guided chest drain(s), surgery
Failure to clinically improve despite antibiotics and chest drain
- Review microbiology results and ensure appropriate antibiotics
- CT to assess extent of residual collection and drain position
- Surgical referral
- Options if unﬁt for surgery:
• Further image-guided small-bore drains into loculated effusions
• Large-bore drain
• Surgical rib resection and open drainage under local anaesthesia

Outcome About 15% of patients require surgery. Empyema 1-year mortality is about 15%. Increased age, renal impairment, low serum albumin,
hypotension, and hospital-acquired infection are associated with a poor
outcome. CXR may remain abnormal despite successful treatment of
empyema, with evidence of calciﬁcation or pleural scarring or thickening.

CHAPTER 35

Pleural effusion

Tuberculous pleural effusion
Deﬁnition and epidemiology Tuberculous pleural effusion usually
develops from a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to mycobacteria
released into the pleural space. It is a common manifestation of primary
tuberculosis in regions with a high prevalence, affecting children and young
adults; it may also be associated with reactivation of tuberculosis in older
individuals. May occur more commonly in the setting of HIV co-infection.
Rarely, tuberculosis may present as pseudochylothorax or tuberculous
empyema.

Clinical features
- Clinical features are similar to those of pulmonary tuberculosis, i.e.
fever, sweats, weight loss, and dyspnoea, although it may present acutely
with pleuritic chest pain and fever, mimicking pneumonia
- Effusions are typically small–moderate in volume, although can be
massive

Investigations
- Associated parenchymal inﬁltrate on CXR in less than one-third of cases
- Tuberculin skin tests positive in two-thirds of cases
- Pleural ﬂuid lymphocytosis, exudative effusion, pH and glucose
moderately depressed, mesothelial cells rare. Pleural ﬂuid acid-fast
bacilli (AFB) smears are positive in around 5–10% of cases; pleural ﬂuid
cultures are positive in 25% of cases and take 2–6 weeks
- Blind Abrams’ pleural biopsy alone has a sensitivity of 75%, but this
increases to nearly 90% when histology and culture of both the ﬂuid
and biopsy are analysed
- Thoracoscopic biopsies have a sensitivity of nearly 100%
- Measurement of adenosine deaminase (an enzyme released by macrophages after phagocytosis of mycobacterium) in pleural ﬂuid may be of
beneﬁt in regions where tuberculosis is highly prevalent; a raised value
is very sensitive for pleural tuberculosis, but is non-speciﬁc and may
also occur in empyema and malignancy
- PCR for mycobacterial DNA in the pleural ﬂuid may be useful diagnostically, but is not widely available
- Induced sputum for acid-fast bacilli may have a diagnostic role in
high-risk patients with lymphocytic effusions, even in the absence of
parenchymal disease on CXR

Treatment and outcome
- Tuberculous pleural effusions resolve spontaneously in the majority of
cases, but two-thirds of untreated patients go on to develop pulmonary
tuberculosis within 5 years and so treatment is recommended
- Treatment is the same as for pulmonary tuberculosis (p 494)
- Pleural ﬂuid volumes may increase during effective treatment and
therapeutic thoracentesis is often required
- Steroids may reduce ﬂuid volumes, but do not affect long-term outcome
- Pleural thickening and calciﬁcation are common long-term
consequences of tuberculous pleural effusion.

CHAPTER 35

Pleural effusion

Other causes
Pleural effusion due to pulmonary embolism
- Fourth commonest cause of pleural effusion in the USA
- Consider in all patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion, particularly
if there is a history of pleuritic chest pain or of breathlessness/hypoxia
out of proportion to the size of the effusion
- Frequently complicates other disease processes, e.g. occurs in one-ﬁfth
of patients with cardiac failure and pleural effusions
- Effusions are usually small (<one-third of hemithorax) and unilateral,
although may be bilateral
- Pleural ﬂuid analysis is non-diagnostic; appearance varies from clear to
bloody, 80% are exudates and 20% transudates. Bloodstained pleural
ﬂuid is not a contraindication to anticoagulation
- Imaging investigations, such as CTPA of the chest, are required to make
the diagnosis; these should be performed prior to thoracentesis if
pulmonary embolism is strongly suspected.

Rheumatoid arthritis-associated pleural effusion
- Pulmonary changes may be the ﬁrst manifestation of rheumatoid
arthritis
- Rheumatoid pleurisy is more common in men (70% are in men)
- Pleural ﬂuid may be yellow-green, serous, turbid, or bloody
- May be unilateral or bilateral
- Pleural ﬂuid glucose level is frequently low (<1.6 mmol/L), and
progressively falls in chronic effusions
- Pleural ﬂuid pH is commonly reduced (<7.3)
- Low pleural ﬂuid complement levels (C4 <0.04 g/L) may also favour the
diagnosis
- Elevated pleural ﬂuid rheumatoid factor titre is found, but it is not
more diagnostically helpful than serum rheumatoid factor
- Typically persist for months to years, although duration may be several
weeks
- Some cases may respond to treatment with steroids

Haemothorax
- Haemothorax is deﬁned as a pleural effusion with a haematocrit >50%
of peripheral blood haematocrit
- Causes include trauma, iatrogenic, malignancy, pulmonary infarction,
benign asbestos-related pleural effusion, pneumonia, post-cardiac injury
syndrome, pneumothorax, thoracic endometriosis, and aortic rupture
- Massive haemothorax deﬁned as >1500 cm3 of blood in hemithorax,
and is most commonly due to trauma. Traumatic haemothorax is said
to require a chest drain and sometimes thoracotomy; all cases should
be discussed immediately with the cardiothoracic surgical team
- Large volumes of residual blood in the pleural space will clot and may
lead to pleural thickening, empyema, or trapped lung. Tube drainage is
difﬁcult and thoracoscopy or thoracotomy with decortication are often
needed. However, undrained cases can resolve without intervention

OTHER CAUSES

Pleural effusion after coronary artery bypass grafting
- Small, typically left-sided pleural effusions occur in the majority of
patients post-CABG, and most resolve spontaneously
- Larger (>25% of hemithorax) effusions can be subdivided:
• Pleural effusions occurring within 30 days of surgery. Classically
bloody and eosinophilic exudate, with high LDH; probably related
to post-operative bleeding into pleural space
• Pleural effusions more than 30 days after surgery. Typically clear and
lymphocytic exudate; cause unknown, perhaps immunological or a
form of post-cardiac injury syndrome
- Main symptom in each case is breathlessness; chest pain and fever are
unusual
- Management consists of repeated therapeutic thoracentesis to alleviate
breathlessness. Recurrent effusions after 1 year are rare and may be
difﬁcult to treat; NSAIDs, prednisolone, or thoracoscopy and pleurodesis may be considered
- Differential diagnosis of pleural effusion post-CABG includes pulmonary embolus, cardiac failure, pleural infection, post-cardiac injury
syndrome, chylothorax.

Pleural effusion following asbestos exposure
The main differential diagnosis is between benign asbestos pleural effusion
(p 110) and mesothelioma (p 114).

CHAPTER 36

Pneumoconioses

Overview and causative
mineral dusts
• Pneumoconioses are non-neoplastic pulmonary diseases caused by the
reaction of the lung to the inhalation of mainly mineral, but also organic,
dusts
• Inhaled particles of dust size <5 µm reach the terminal airways and
alveoli and settle on the epithelial lining. From here they are slowly
cleared by macrophages or alveolar cells. They may pass into the
lymphatic system, be cleared via the airway, or remain in the alveolus
• The dust particles can lead to an inﬂammatory reaction within the lung,
depending on their physical and chemical properties
• The inﬂammation causes characteristic alterations in pulmonary
structure and radiological abnormalities
• Of the diseases caused by inhalation of mineral dusts, many are
becoming less common in the UK, due to improved protection of
workers from dusts and decreasing levels of mining. Newer industrial
nations may see increasing numbers of cases of pneumoconiosis
• Organic dusts causing hypersensitivity pneumonitis and extrinsic asthma
are discussed on p 249 and 142. Asbestos-related diseases are
discussed separately on p 107.

OVERVIEW AND CAUSATIVE MINERAL DUSTS

Types of mineral dust exposure
Non-ﬁbrous mineral dusts
• Silica
• Coal dust
• Mixed mineral dusts containing quartz: slate, kaolin, talc, non-ﬁbrous
clays.
Fibrous mineral dusts
• Asbestos
• Other mineral ﬁbres.
Metal dusts and fumes
• Iron, aluminium, beryllium, cobalt.

Chest disease in coal miners It was recognized many years ago that
coal miners had higher levels of respiratory disease than the general population. Coal miners can get any or all of:
• Chronic bronchitis
• COPD
• Pneumoconiosis.
They may be eligible for compensation for all of these. It has been difﬁcult
to establish the independent effects of coal dust due to high smoking rates
amongst miners. However, it is now thought that coal dust contributes to
the COPD and bronchitis caused by smoking, because:
• Miners have an increased prevalence of cough, sputum, and decreased
FEV1 when compared with non-miners. The risk of cough increases
with increasing dust exposure
• FEV1 declines in proportion to the amount of dust exposure
• In smokers the response to dust is probably different to that of nonsmokers, with worse disease at a given level of exposure.
In the past, tuberculosis has also been a major problem amongst miners
and their families, relating to their socio-economic conditions.
SWORD is the Surveillance of Work-related and Occupational
Respiratory Disease scheme run in the UK to monitor the numbers of
patients with occupational lung diseases. Patients with a clinical diagnosis
of an occupational lung disease are conﬁdentially reported by respiratory or occupational health physicians.

CHAPTER 36

Pneumoconioses

Coal-worker’s pneumoconiosis
This is the condition caused by the deposition of coal dust within the lung
and its associated inﬂammatory reaction.
There are two types:
• Simple pneumoconiosis, which can progress to
• Complicated pneumoconiosis, also known as progressive massive
ﬁbrosis (PMF).
These are common diseases amongst coal miners who work in poorly
ventilated conditions. The risk of pneumoconiosis varies with different
compositions of coal from different geographical areas, but the larger the
amount of dust to which the miner is exposed, the greater the risk of
developing pneumoconiosis. It is now rare for miners under the age of 50
to be diagnosed with pneumoconiosis in the UK.

Pathology
Simple pneumoconiosis Coal dust is inhaled into the alveolus and is
engulfed by macrophages, forming a black stellate lesion, the coal macule.
This causes cytokine release and subsequent inﬂammatory cell recruitment, leading to ﬁbroblast activation. These coal macules are found
throughout the lung, especially in the upper zones of the upper and
lower lobes, and often associated with surrounding bronchiolar dilatation.
They are not palpable. Regional lymph nodes also become blackened. In
time, larger nodules develop, containing reticulin and collagen between
the macrophages, and associated bronchiolar dilatation leading to focal
emphysema is seen.
Progressive massive ﬁbrosis occurs on this background, but with aggregation of the ﬁbrotic nodules to form larger lesions, 2–10 cm diameter.
Macroscopically, these look like large black scars, extending from the lung
parenchyma to the chest wall. The central area of these nodules may be
necrotic and the outer rim is ﬁrm and collagenous. It is not understood
what causes the progression of small nodules to PMF, although continued
exposure to coal dust in the presence of simple pneumoconiosis makes
this development more likely.

Clinical features
Simple pneumoconiosis is usually asymptomatic with no associated clinical
signs. This is a relatively benign disease.
Progressive massive ﬁbrosis is usually associated with cough, productive of
mucoid or blackened sputum, and breathlessness, particularly on exertion,
and may in time lead to the development of cor pulmonale. Examination is
unremarkable, with no clubbing and no crepitations audible (the presence
of crepitations suggests a different diagnosis).

COAL-WORKER’S PNEUMOCONIOSIS

Investigations
• CXR In simple pneumoconiosis there is nodular shadowing, with nodules
of varying size, up to 10 mm, particularly in the upper and middle
zones. Pneumoconiosis can be graded according to the number of
different sized nodules, p = <1.5 mm, q = 1.5–3 mm, and r = 3–10 mm.
Nodule numbers increase with increasing dust inhalation and usually
stop forming when the miner has left the work environment. PMF is
diagnosed when one or more opacities of >1 cm diameter are present,
on the background of simple pneumoconiosis. These lesions are often
located in the upper lobes and enlarge, becoming increasingly radiodense and clearly demarcated with time. They may distort the adjacent lung and cause emphysema. The lesions continue to progress out
of the work environment
• HRCT of simple pneumoconiosis shows parenchymal nodules
1–10 mm in size, with upper zone predominance. In PMF, nodules of
>1 cm are seen, with irregular borders and associated parenchymal
distortion and emphysema. Larger lesions may have cavitation and
necrosis. They may also have areas of calciﬁcation
• PFTs Simple pneumoconiosis: FEV1 and FVC are normal, although
TLCO may be slightly decreased. PMF: signs of airway obstruction due
to emphysema, and restriction due to loss of lung volumes. TLCO is
reduced.

Management Minimization of dust exposure with improved mine ventilation, respirator provision, and monitoring of dust levels. Miners have
CXR every 4 years and are moved to less dusty work if they show signs
of pneumoconiosis, to prevent the development of PMF. Miners with signs
of coal worker’s pneumoconiosis are entitled to industrial injury beneﬁts
from British Coal. No increased risk of lung cancer with pneumoconiosis
or PMF.
Caplan’s syndrome Miners with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis or
positive serum rheumatoid factor can develop large well-deﬁned nodules.
These occur on a background of simple pneumoconiosis and in those
with a relatively low coal dust exposure. They may be multiple and may
cavitate. They cause no signiﬁcant functional impairment and have no
malignant potential.

367

368

CHAPTER 36

Pneumoconioses

Silicosis
This is a chronic nodular densely ﬁbrosing pneumoconiosis, caused by the
prolonged inhalation of silica particles.
• Long lag time of decades between exposure and clinical disease
• Insidious onset, progressive
• Larger radiological opacities than those seen in coal-worker’s pneumoconiosis and more rapid progression
• The pattern of disease depends on the level and duration of the
silicone dust exposure.
Silica is present mostly as crystalline quartz, which is mined and quarried,
and used in industries such as ceramics, brick-making, and stone masonry.
It is becoming less prevalent in Western societies, due to changes in silica
working conditions.

Pathology Quartz and cristobalite forms of crystalline silica cause silicosis. When they accumulate within the airways, lymphocytes and alveolar
macrophages engulf the particles and are removed into the lymphatic
system. Any remaining silica dust causes focal aggregations of macrophages, which are, in time, converted into ﬁbrosing nodules. Silica dust can
cause surfactant secretion from the alveolus due to local irritation. This
leads to further macrophage recruitment. Large nodules are formed by
the aggregation of smaller nodules.

Different types of silicosis There are four types, and the distinction
is often not clear.
• Acute silicosis is caused by intense exposure to ﬁne dusts, such as those
produced by sand blasting. It may become apparent in workers within
a few months to a year of starting work. Rapid deterioration over 1–2
years, with treatment being ineffective. Rare now, due to regulation of
silica levels in the workplace
• Clinically dry cough, shortness of breath, and a feeling of tightness
on breathing deeply. Rapid deterioration over a few weeks. Fine
crepitations are heard over the lower zones bilaterally. Respiratory
failure
• CXR Patchy bilateral lower air space consolidation, which may look
like pulmonary oedema
• Pathology Irregular ﬁbrosis adjacent to alveolar spaces ﬁlled
with a lipoproteinaceous exudate, similar to that found in alveolar
proteinosis.
• Subacute silicosis This is the classic picture of silicosis, which is now
quite rare. Dry cough, gradual onset of shortness of breath
• CXR Upper and mid-zone nodules are present, measuring between
3 and 5 mm diameter. Initially indistinct, but become clearer with
time. Nodules coalesce and calcify and can progress to progressive
massive ﬁbrosis (PMF). Associated calciﬁed hilar lymphadenopathy
(egg shell calciﬁcation) and possible pleural thickening. Nodules
continue to develop with continued exposure, but due to long lag
time will also develop when patient stops being exposed. In some
cases with heavy exposure to silica, patients may develop progressive
upper zone ﬁbrosis with sparse nodularity

SILICOSIS

• PFTs Slow decline, including TLCO, with mild restrictive pattern,
unless the silicosis has caused emphysema, when obstructive or
mixed picture is seen
• Pathology Dust particles within the alveoli are phagocytosed by
macrophages. They are removed to the lymphatics, where they
lodge and cause diffuse inﬂammatory change. Layers of collagen are
deposited around the dust particle. Nodules are found within the
secondary pulmonary lobule, where they cause ﬁbrosis
• Chronic silicosis occurs with lower dust concentrations than those seen
in active silicosis
• CXR A few upper and mid-zone nodules occur, which become
calciﬁed after 10 years or so. There is no associated parenchymal
distortion. There may be associated hilar lymphadenopathy.
If there is further silica exposure, this disease may progress, with coalescence of nodules.
• Silicotuberculosis Increased likelihood of active TB infection in people
with silicosis, most likely due to the reactivation of quiescent lesions.
Silica within the lung is thought to affect the efﬁcacy of the macrophage
at clearing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB can be difﬁcult to diagnose,
due to multiple pre-existing CXR nodules. Cavitation may occur,
which does not occur with silicosis alone. Haemoptysis, fever, and
new soft CXR opacities should prompt sputum examination and BAL.
Conﬁrmed TB should be treated with the usual 3 or 4 drug regime.
Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection is also more common.

Management Prevention of silicosis by monitoring and minimizing dust
levels with adequate ventilation. Masks can be useful for short-term use,
if the high levels of dust are transiently unavoidable. Disability beneﬁts
available from the Department for Work and Pensions. Small increased
risk of lung cancer with silicosis and associated PMF.

CHAPTER 36

Pneumoconioses

Berylliosis
Beryllium is a light, strong industrial metal. It is mined and often used as an
alloy in the manufacture of ﬂuorescent tubes for lighting and televisions,
radiological equipment, in atomic reactors, and in heat-resistant ceramics.
Cases of berylliosis are now rare, as beryllium levels have been tightly
regulated to avoid sensitization. However, due to the long latent period
between exposure and granuloma formation, as well as accidental beryllium exposure, cases are still occurring. There are two types of disease.
• Acute beryllium disease is an acute alveolitis due to the direct effects
of high-dose inhaled beryllium fumes. There is subsequent widespread
airway oedema and pulmonary oedema, which causes dyspnoea,
cyanosis, and widespread inspiratory crepitations. CXR shows pulmonary oedema. It may be self-limiting if mild, but if severe is usually fatal.
Corticosteroids may prevent progression, but the patient is often left
with residual pulmonary impairment
• Subacute and chronic berylliosis is a hypersensitivity-type skin or
pulmonary disease that occurs a long time after beryllium exposure
in a minority of individuals. It can be clinically indistinguishable from
sarcoidosis. It has also been seen in the wives of beryllium workers and
those who live near beryllium reﬁneries. Inhalation of beryllium or the
exposure of beryllium to a skin abrasion causes initial sensitization in
2–19% of exposed individuals. Only low levels of exposure are required
for this. There is a cell-mediated immune response, with the production of numerous inﬂammatory cytokines, which cause granulomatous
inﬂammation. Following a long latent period, which may be months to
10 years plus after exposure, non-caseating granulomatous tissue
reactions occur in the lungs or on the skin. Similar to sarcoidosis. There
is a genetic predisposition to the response to beryllium exposure and
it is HLA-mediated (HLA-DPB1(Glu69)). HLA status could be used to
identify workers at high risk of berylliosis (but is not routinely used at
present).

Clinical features of chronic berylliosis
• Symptoms Cough, dyspnoea. Macular skin lesions, which do not
spontaneously resolve
• Signs No clubbing or crepitations in early disease, but both occur with
established ﬁbrosis. Hepato/splenomegaly and macular skin lesions.
Do not get uveitis or erythema nodosum.

Investigations
• CXR Fine reticulonodular appearance throughout both lungs. Finer
nodules than those seen in sarcoidosis. Progression to irregular interstitial ﬁbrosis, with irregular linear opacities seen in the lung bases. Hilar
lymphadenopathy can occur, but always in association with interstitial
lung disease
• HRCT Subpleural micronodular change, thickened interlobular septae,
traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing. There may be ground-glass
shadowing
• BAL High levels of T-lymphocytes
• PFTs Restrictive defect, with decreased KCO

BERYLLIOSIS

• Pathology Non-caseating granuloma. May be indistinguishable from
sarcoidosis. May develop irregular ﬁbrosis with bulla and cyst formation
No single test to distinguish berylliosis from sarcoidosis.

Management Corticosteroids to try and prevent disease progression.
Continue indeﬁnitely as few patients gain complete resolution of symptoms, CXR or PFTs. Annual screening of beryllium-exposed workers with
CXR. If they develop breathlessness or skin rashes, this may be an indication to start oral steroids to delay progression to interstitial ﬁbrosis.
Prognosis Progressive disease, although those with very low exposure
who develop CXR changes may ﬁnd they resolve. Associated delayed
skin sensitivity (anergy) to tuberculin. Granulomata do not spontaneously
resolve, although can be excised if causing problems, such as troublesome
lesions on the skin. Interstitial ﬁbrosis occurs in the lungs, which is progressive and leads to cyanosis and death. Other complications include
pneumothorax, hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis.
Differential diagnosis
• Sarcoidosis
• Tuberculosis.

In clinic
• Ask patients with suspected sarcoidosis about possible exposure to
beryllium
• Monitor PFTs and CXR to assess disease response or progression.

CHAPTER 37

Pneumothorax

Clinical features and investigations
Deﬁnition A pneumothorax is air in the pleural space. May occur with
apparently normal lungs (primary pneumothorax) or in the presence of
underlying lung disease (secondary pneumothorax). May occur spontaneously or following trauma.
Epidemiology
• Annual incidence of primary pneumothorax is around 9 per 100 000
• Primary pneumothoraces occur most commonly in tall thin men aged
between 20 and 40. They are less common in women (male : female
5: 1)—consider the possibility of underlying lung disease (e.g. lymphangioleiomyomatosis, catamenial pneumothorax)
• Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for pneumothorax, increasing
the risk by a factor of 22 in men and 9 in women. The mechanism is
unclear; a smoking-induced inﬂux of inﬂammatory cells may both break
down elastic lung ﬁbres (causing bulla formation) and cause small
airways obstruction (increasing alveolar pressure and the likelihood of
interstitial air leak)
• May rarely be familial.

Causes and pathophysiology
Primary
Pathogenesis is poorly understood; they are presumed to occur following
an air leak from apical bullae, although small airway inﬂammation is often
also present and may contribute by increasing airways resistance.
Secondary
• Underlying diseases include: COPD (60% of cases), asthma, interstitial
lung disease, necrotizing pneumonia, tuberculosis, PCP, cystic ﬁbrosis,
Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Marfan’s
syndrome, oesophageal rupture, lung cancer, catamenial pneumothorax,
and pulmonary infarction
• Pneumothorax may be the ﬁrst presentation of the underlying disease.

Clinical features
• Classically presents with acute onset of pleuritic chest pain and/or
breathlessness. Breathlessness is often minimal in young patients and is
more severe in secondary pneumothorax
• Signs of pneumothorax include tachycardia, reduced expansion,
hyper-resonant percussion note, and quiet breath sounds on the
pneumothorax side. These are frequently absent in small pneumothoraces. Hamman’s sign refers to a ‘click’ on auscultation in time with the
heart sounds, due to movement of pleural surfaces with a left-sided
pneumothorax
• May feel ‘bubbles’ and ‘crackles’ under the skin of the torso and neck if
there is subcutaneous emphysema
• Presents in ventilated patients with acute clinical deterioration and
hypoxia or increasing inﬂation pressures.

CLINICAL FEATURES AND INVESTIGATIONS

Investigations
• CXR is the diagnostic test in most cases, revealing a visible lung edge
and absent lung markings peripherally. Blunting of the ipsilateral
costophrenic angle due to bleeding into the pleural space is common.
Pneumothoraces are difﬁcult to visualize on supine ﬁlms: look for
a sharply delineated heart border, hemidiaphragm depression, and
increased lucency on the affected side
• Width of the rim of air surrounding the lung on CXR may be used
to classify pneumothoraces into small (rim of air <2 cm) and large
(≥2 cm). A 2-cm rim of air approximately equates to a 50% pneumothorax in volume
• Tiny pneumothoraces that are not apparent on PA CXR may be
visible on lateral chest or lateral decubitus radiographs
• CXR appearance may also show features of underlying lung disease,
although this can be difﬁcult to assess in the presence of a large
pneumothorax
• CT chest may be required to differentiate pneumothorax from bullous
disease, and is useful in diagnosing unsuspected pneumothorax
following trauma and in looking for evidence of underlying lung disease
• ABGs frequently show hypoxia and sometimes hypercapnia in secondary pneumothorax

Prognosis
• Average of 30% (range 16–54% in studies) of primary pneumothoraces
recur, most within 2 years. Continued smoking increases the risk of
recurrence. Risk of recurrence increases with each subsequent
pneumothorax: risk of recurrence is around 30% after a ﬁrst pneumothorax, about 40% after a second, and >50% after a third
• Mortality of secondary pneumothorax 10%
• Recurrence of secondary pneumothorax occurs in 39–47%, and is associated with age, pulmonary ﬁbrosis, and emphysema. Recurrence rates
may be as high as 80% in patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis or
lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

CHAPTER 37

Pneumothorax

Initial management
There is considerable variation amongst clinicians regarding optimal pneumothorax management. The treatment algorithms presented on pp 380–1
follow the BTS guidelines.

General management points
• Management is determined by the degree of breathlessness and
hypoxia, evidence of haemodynamic compromise, the presence and
severity of any underlying lung disease, and to some extent the
pneumothorax size
• Severe breathlessness out of proportion to pneumothorax size may be
a feature of impending tension pneumothorax
• Secondary pneumothorax has a signiﬁcant mortality (10%), and should
be managed more aggressively. Treat also the underlying disease.

Aspiration
• Procedure described on p 779
• Halt the procedure if painful, or if the patient coughs excessively; do
not aspirate >2.5 L of air, as this suggests a large air leak and aspiration
is likely to fail
• Ideal timing of repeat CXR following aspiration is unknown; it may be
advisable to wait several hours before performing the CXR, in order to
detect slow air leaks
• Aspiration is successful if the lung is fully or nearly re-expanded on
CXR
• If initial aspiration of a primary pneumothorax fails, repeat aspiration
should be considered (unless ≥ 2.5 L has already been aspirated). At
least one-third of patients will respond to second aspiration, although
the optimal timing of repeat aspiration is unclear.

Chest drainage
• Procedure described on p 757
• Associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and even mortality, and not
required in the majority of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax
• Small (10–14F) drains are sufﬁcient in most cases; consider large-bore
(24–28F) drain in secondary pneumothorax with large air leak, severe
subcutaneous emphysema, or in mechanically ventilated patients
• Never clamp a bubbling chest drain (risk of tension pneumothorax)
• When air leak appears to have ceased, clamping of the drain for several
hours followed by repeat CXR may detect very slow or intermittent
air leaks, thereby avoiding inappropriate drain removal; this is controversial, however, and should only be considered on a specialist ward
with experienced nursing staff. Addition of washing-up liquid to water
in underwater seal bottle aids visualization of bubbling in very slow air
leaks.

INITIAL MANAGEMENT

• If drain water level does not swing with respiration, the drain is kinked
(check underneath dressing, as tube enters skin), blocked, clamped, or
incorrectly positioned (drainage holes not in pleural space; check CXR)
• Heimlich ﬂutter valves (or thoracic vents) are an alternative to underwater bottle drainage, and are being used increasingly in some centres.
They allow greater patient mobilization, and sometimes out-patient
management of pneumothorax.

Oxygen
All hospitalized patients should receive high ﬂow (10 L/min) inspired
oxygen (unless CO2 retention is a problem). This reduces the partial pressure of nitrogen in blood, encouraging removal of air from the pleural
space and speeding up resolution of the pneumothorax.

Persistent air leak
• Deﬁned as continued bubbling of chest drain 48 h after insertion
• Consider drain suction (–10 to –20 cmH2O), insertion of large-bore
drain, and/or thoracic surgical referral
• Check that persistent bubbling is not the result of ‘outside’ air being
sucked down the drain, e.g. following drain displacement such that a
hole lies outside the pleural cavity, or, if enlargement of the drain track
occurs, allowing outside air to enter and then be released down the
drain.

Discharge
Prior to discharge, discuss ﬂying and diving (see p 378), and advise to
return to hospital immediately if breathlessness worsens. Document this
in medical notes.

377

378

CHAPTER 37

Pneumothorax

Further management
Out-patient follow-up
• Repeat CXR to ensure resolution of pneumothorax and normal
appearance of underlying lungs
• Discuss risk of recurrence and emphasize smoking cessation,
if appropriate
• Ascent to altitude with a pneumothorax is potentially hazardous.
Guidelines recommend that patients should not ﬂy for at least one
week from the resolution of spontaneous pneumothorax on CXR. This
time interval is arbitrary, however, and patients should understand that
there is a high initial risk of recurrence that falls with time, and they
may wish to avoid ﬂying for a longer period, e.g. 1 year
• Advise never to dive in the future, unless patient has undergone a
deﬁnitive surgical procedure.

Surgical management
Indications for cardiothoracic surgical referral
• Second ipsilateral pneumothorax
• First contralateral pneumothorax
• Bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax
• Persistent air leak (>5–7 days of drainage)
• Spontaneous haemothorax
• Professions at risk (e.g. pilots, divers) after ﬁrst pneumothorax.
Note that these are guidelines only, and patient choice will also inﬂuence
the decision for surgical intervention.
Surgical treatments aim to repair the apical hole or bleb, and close the
pleural space. Options:
• Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) Recurrence rates are higher
than for open thoracotomy (4% vs. 1.5%), although less invasive procedure and probably shorter hospital stay. Pleural abrasion (rather
than talc poudrage) is usually favoured for closure of the pleural space.
Often the procedure of choice in young patients with primary pneumothorax
• Open thoracotomy Apical bleb resected, pleural space closed by pleural
abrasion or parietal pleurectomy. Effective procedure with a recurrence
rate <1%, but probably prolonged recovery rates compared with VATS
• Transaxillary minithoracotomy uses a relatively small axillary
incision and may be a less invasive alternative to open thoracotomy.

FURTHER MANAGEMENT

Chemical pleurodesis
• Talc or tetracycline most commonly used; procedure described on p 775
• Can be performed via intercostal drain or at VATS
• Failure rates around 10–20%, and some concern about the long-term
safety of intrapleural talc; therefore not recommended in younger
patients
• Consider pleurodesis via intercostal drain only as a last resort in older
patients with recurrent pneumothorax in whom surgery would be high
risk (e.g. patients with severe COPD)
• Likelihood of successful pleurodesis in the setting of an incompletely
re-expanded lung with a persistent air leak remains uncertain, although
it may be attempted if surgery is not an option.

CHAPTER 37

Pneumothorax

Speciﬁc situations
Tension pneumothorax
• Pneumothorax acts as a one-way valve, with air entering the pleural
space on each inspiration and unable to escape on expiration. The
progressive increase in pleural pressure compresses both lungs and
mediastinum and inhibits venous return to the heart, leading to
hypotension and potentially cardiac arrest
• Occurrence is not related to pneumothorax size, and tension can
occur with very small pneumothoraces in the context of air trapping in
the lung from obstructive lung disease
• Typically presents with acute respiratory distress, agitation, hypotension, raised jugular venous pressure, and tracheal deviation away from
the pneumothorax side. Reduced air entry on affected side
• May present with cardiac arrest (pulseless electrical activity), or with
acute deterioration in ventilated patients.

3 Management of a tension pneumothorax
• If strong clinical suspicion, give high-ﬂow oxygen and insert large-bore
cannula into second intercostal space in mid-clavicular line on side of
pneumothorax
• Do not wait for a CXR if patient seriously compromised or cardiac
arrest has occurred
• Do not wait for a CXR if the diagnosis is clinically certain
• Hiss of escaping air conﬁrms diagnosis
• Aspirate air until the patient is less distressed and then insert chest
drain in mid-axillary line, leaving cannula in place until ﬁnished and
the underwater seal is bubbling satisfactorily.

Iatrogenic pneumothorax
• Causes include transbronchial biopsy, transthoracic needle lung biopsy,
subclavian line insertion, mechanical ventilation, pleural aspiration,
pleural biopsy, external cardiac massage, and percutaneous liver biopsy
• Presentation may be delayed, even several days after procedure
• Most cases do not require intervention and improve with observation,
although aspiration is sometimes required
• Drainage is seldom needed, although is more commonly required in
patients with COPD. The exception is mechanically ventilated patients,
who will require an intercostal drain in the majority of cases.

Traumatic pneumothorax
• Up to half may not be clinically apparent or visible on CXR; chest CT is
required for diagnosis
• Majority of patients require intercostal drain. Ensure adequate analgesia;
intercostal nerve block may be required
• Consider VATS early if persistent air leak.

SPECIFIC SITUATIONS

Subcutaneous (or ‘surgical’) emphysema
• Occurs as air tracks below skin under pressure from the pleural space
• May result from large air-leaks, particularly in the presence of underlying lung disease, such as COPD. Also may occur if chest drain is
blocked or displaced so that holes lie subcutaneously
• Harmless in majority of cases, although rarely may result in signiﬁcant
respiratory compromise from upper airway compression
• Treat with high-ﬂow (10 L/min) inspired oxygen (unless CO2 retention
a problem). Check that the drain is patent (swinging, bubbling)
• Management if unwell: oxygen, large-bore chest drain on suction. If the
airway is compromised, consider anaesthetizing and incising areas of
affected skin, and ‘milking’ out subcutaneous air; subcutaneous drains
are sometimes used, and in rare cases tracheostomy is required.

Pneumothorax in HIV
• Most commonly occurs as a result of PCP. Empirical treatment of PCP
is advised (see p 478)
• Use of nebulized pentamidine may increase the risk of pneumothorax
• Consider early intercostal drainage and surgical referral.

Pneumothorax in cystic ﬁbrosis
• Associated with severe underlying lung disease
• Subsequent ipsilateral and contralateral pneumothorax common
• Manage as for secondary pneumothorax, although intercostal drainage
frequently required
• Give course of intravenous antibiotics
• In cases of persistent air leak despite suction, discuss management with
cardiothoracic surgical team at local transplant centre. Partial pleurectomy
is effective in preventing recurrence. Pleurodesis renders later transplant
technically more difﬁcult, but it is not an absolute contraindication to
transplantation.

Catamenial pneumothorax
• Pneumothorax occurring at the same time as menstruation
• Usually recurrent
• Pathogenesis is unknown; possibilities include pleural endometriosis or
transfer of air into pleural spaces through a diaphragmatic defect from
the peritoneal cavity at menstruation
• Treatment options: VATS, pleurodesis, ovulation-suppressing drugs.

Re-expansion pulmonary oedema
• Occurs in up to 14% of cases following treatment, and causes breathlessness and cough with evidence of oedema in the re-expanded lung
(and sometimes both lungs) on CXR
• More common in young patients with large primary pneumothoraces,
and may be associated with late presentations to hospital
• May be precipitated by early use of suction (<48 h)
• Self-resolving in most cases, although may rarely be fatal.

CHAPTER 38

Pulmonary hypertension

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial
hypertension (IPAH)
Deﬁnition Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), previously called primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), is a rare disease of
uncertain aetiology. It is deﬁned as a mean pulmonary artery pressure
>25 mmHg at rest (or >30 mmHg on exercise) with a pulmonary capillary
or left atrial pressure <15 mmHg. By deﬁnition there is no demonstrable
cause. The presence of resting pulmonary hypertension is signiﬁcant, as
more than 70% of the vascular bed must be lost for the pulmonary arterial
pressure to rise.
Epidemiology The incidence of IPAH in Europe and the USA is 1–2 cases
per million population per year. The mean age at diagnosis is 36, with a
female preponderance of about 2:1. Although rare, it is important to diagnose, as it affects a young age group and has an extremely poor outcome
without treatment.
Pathophysiology Vasoconstriction and secondary thickening of peripheral ‘resistance’ blood vessels in association with smooth muscle cell and
endothelial cell proliferation and thrombosis lead to raised pulmonary
vascular resistance. The mechanism for this is poorly understood, but the
identiﬁcation of a mutation in BMPR2, which is present in 70% of familial
cases of PAH, has improved understanding. BMPR2, bone morphogenetic
protein receptor type II, is a receptor in the transforming growth factor
beta (TGFB) receptor superfamily and is an important regulator of apoptosis and proliferation. It is hypothesized that defective signalling via this
pathway may result in abnormal endothelial proliferation and cell growth
in response to various insults, with an inability to terminate the proliferative response to injury. Due to incomplete disease penetrance in the
presence of a mutation in BMPR2 (15–20%), it is thought that the genetic
abnormality may have to be accompanied by some additional environmental factor, e.g. hypoxia to cause PAH. Allelic variations in the serotonin
transporter have also been identiﬁed.
An imbalance between prostacyclin (a potent vasodilator and platelet
inhibitor) and thromboxane A2 (a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet
agonist) has been identiﬁed in PAH. Unfavourable imbalances between
other regulators of vascular tone and smooth muscle cell growth, including
endothelin-1, nitric oxide, and serotonin have also been implicated in the
disease.
Acute hypoxia causes reversible changes in vascular tone, with chronic
hypoxia inducing structural vascular remodelling, which can add signiﬁcantly to morbidity in certain lung diseases.

IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (IPAH)

Aetiology
• Idiopathic IPAH This is a disease for which, strictly speaking, no cause
is found, although a number of risk factors have been identiﬁed, and
BMPR2 mutations may be present in up to 25%. The identiﬁed risk
factors for IPAH have in common an ability to damage the pulmonary
endothelium, which may provoke an excessive proliferative response,
progressing to IPAH.
• Familial IPAH A familial predisposition is seen in 6–10% of IPAH cases,
where the disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion.
Incomplete penetrance and anticipation are seen, with presentation at
a younger age in successive generations. The responsible gene has been
localized to chromosome 2 (locus 2q 31–32). Abnormal cardiovascular
responses to exercise have been demonstrated in asymptomatic carriers of BMPR2.
• Associations
• Anorexigens are associated with the development of PAH, with an
increased incidence with longer duration of use. A raised PAP can
occur after only 4 weeks of drug use.
• CNS stimulants Cocaine and methamphetamine are associated with
the development of PAH.
• Scleroderma Post mortem studies show histological changes consistent with PAH in up to 80% of patients with scleroderma spectrum disease, including SLE, mixed connective tissue disease, and
RA. The reported lifetime incidence of PAH in scleroderma varies,
but may be about 15%. In all of these diseases there is a strong
association between PAH and Raynaud’s phenomenon, suggesting
pathological similarities between these two conditions.
• HIV PAH is found in HIV infected individuals, regardless of the route
of infection. The incidence is about 0.5%, 6–12 times higher than
the general population. The development of PAH is independent
of CD4 cell count, but is associated with duration of infection. The
mechanism is unclear.
• Portal hypertension PAH is seen in up to 5% of patients with portal
hypertension, increasing with duration of liver disease. The mechanism is uncertain, but it appears that cirrhosis without portal hypertension is insufﬁcient for the development of PAH.
• Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia PAH occurs in around 15%
of patients with HHT, an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia.
Mutations in the ALK-1 receptor (also in the TGFB receptor superfamily) are implicated.

Prognosis is variable, depending on haemodynamic compromise with
cardiac index, right atrial pressure, and mean pulmonary artery pressure at presentation being linked to prognosis. The median survival in
NYHA functional class 3 (symptomatic on mild exertion) is 2.8 years and
6 months in NYHA class IV (symptomatic at rest) without treatment.

CHAPTER 38

Pulmonary hypertension

IPAH: clinical features
The symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension are
non-speciﬁc, leading to an average delay in diagnosis of 3 years from ﬁrst
symptoms.

Presenting features
• Exertional breathlessness, due to the inability to increase cardiac
output with exercise
• Chest pain (right heart angina)
• Syncope, due to a fall in systemic blood pressure on exercise
• Palpitations
• Oedema, or other signs of right-sided ﬂuid overload.

Examination Signs consistent with right heart ﬂuid overload and right
ventricular hypertrophy are associated with advanced disease and include:
• Raised JVP, with giant V waves
• Right ventricular heave
• Wide splitting of S2 with loud P2
• Murmur of tricuspid regurgitation
• Hepatomegaly
• Ascites
• Peripheral oedema
• Cyanosis.

Investigations These are aimed at making a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension by excluding possible underlying causes for
the pulmonary hypertension. In 85% of patients presenting with symptoms
caused by established pulmonary hypertension, a CXR and ECG will be
abnormal.
• CXR may show enlarged pulmonary arteries and an enlarged cardiac
silhouette, with pruning of peripheral vessels
• ECG Right atrial hypertrophy, right axis deviation, and RVH
• Arterial blood gas Hypoxia and hypocapnia (correlating with disease
severity), with a fall in oxygen saturation on exercise
• Pulmonary function tests The lung volumes may be normal, or show a
mild restrictive or obstructive defect with a reduced TLCO (late in the
disease course)
• HRCT chest to exclude underlying lung disease
• Ventilation–perfusion scanning/CTPA to exclude chronic thromboembolic disease as a cause. V/Q is more sensitive than CTPA
• Echocardiography The most useful diagnostic test in pulmonary hypertension. Typically shows enlargement of right-sided cardiac chambers
with paradoxical interventricular septum movement, and tricuspid
regurgitation. The systolic pulmonary artery pressure can be estimated
from the velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet, using Doppler techniques, and the estimated right atrial pressure from the IVC calibre.
Pericardial effusions may be present and represent a poor prognosis

IPAH: CLINICAL FEATURES

• Right heart catheterization to conﬁrm the pulmonary artery pressure,
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac output (with a Swann–
Ganz catheter, by thermodilution or Fick). Vasodilator testing (usually
with inhaled nitric oxide) should be performed to identify patients who
will respond to calcium-channel blockers. Also needed to exclude a left
to right intracardiac shunt.
• Selective pulmonary angiography is rarely required as CTPA and
V/Q can detect nearly all cases of thromboembolic disease
• Blood tests Routine tests, including autoantibodies (anti-centromere
antibody, anti SCL-70, and RNP) if connective tissue disease suspected
as a cause, HIV, TSH, thrombophilia screen, serum ACE.

CHAPTER 38

Pulmonary hypertension

IPAH: general management
The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is made when
all other causes have been excluded. The management in this section
applies to IPAH.

General management
• Anticoagulation All patients with pulmonary hypertension are at risk of
venous thromboembolism and in situ pulmonary arterial thrombosis,
and therefore should be on life-long warfarin. A small thrombus can
have catastrophic effects in a patient who is already severely
compromised. Studies show an increased survival with warfarin in
IPAH, which may reﬂect reversal of an underlying pro-thrombotic state,
as well as the prevention of in situ thrombus formation. Additional
beneﬁcial effects are seen when combined with a vasodilator. There is
no published data on the use of warfarin in other causes/associations of
pulmonary hypertension
• Long-term oxygen Hypoxaemia is due to reduced cardiac output, ventilation/perfusion mismatching, and right–left shunting through a patent
foramen ovale. Added oxygen may reduce any further rise in PAP
resulting from additional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
• Diuretics and digoxin Diuretics may be useful for the treatment of
oedema, but excess preload reduction may limit their usefulness.
Digoxin has been shown to improve cardiac output acutely in IPAH,
though its longer-term effects are not known
• Immunization Annual inﬂuenza and one-off pneumococcal vaccination
• Contraception may be required, as pregnancy is poorly tolerated in
IPAH with a 30–50% mortality.
A National Pulmonary Hypertension Service was set up in the UK
in 2001 to coordinate diagnosis and treatment in ﬁve regional centres,
recognizing the need to provide best care (with complex interventions)
and optimize funding for expensive treatments. The ﬁve UK centres are:
• London—Hammersmith Hospital (general)
• Royal Brompton Hospital (adult congenital heart disease)
• Royal Free Hospital (connective tissue disease)
• Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (children)
• Cambridge—Papworth Hospital
• Shefﬁeld—Royal Hallamshire Hospital
• Newcastle—Freeman Hospital
• Glasgow—Western Inﬁrmary
Recent guidelines suggest referral to a specialist centre after CXR, ECG,
simple spirometry, and echocardiogram (but not cardiac catheterization,
as this should be done in parallel with a vasodilator study in a specialist
centre).

CHAPTER 38

Pulmonary hypertension

IPAH: disease-targeted therapy
In IPAH there is impaired production of the vasodilators nitric oxide and
prostacyclin, and over-production of the vasoconstrictor endothelin by the
pulmonary endothelium. Imbalance of these factors also leads to vascular
remodelling. Vasodilator responsiveness is measured during right heart
catheterization with incremental doses of a short-acting vasodilator, such
as inhaled nitric oxide, or intravenous epoprostenol or adenosine. A positive vasodilator response is deﬁned as a drop in mean pulmonary arterial
pressure by more than 10 mmHg to less than 40 mmHg with an unchanged
or increased cardiac output. Only about 5-10% of patients are responders.
Vasoresponders should be considered for ﬁrst-line therapy with calciumchannel blockers. Non-responders should receive prostacyclin analogues,
endothelin receptor antagonists, and/or phosphodiesterase inhibitors.

Calcium-channel blockers (CCBs)
• High-dose nifedipine (30–240 mg daily) and diltiazem (120–900 mg
daily) are recommended in patients with a positive acute vasodilator
response. They should then be followed to determine if they are longterm CCB responders (about 2/3). This group has an excellent prognosis (>90% 10-year survival). CCBs should not be used in those with a
negative vasodilator challenge, as they may increase mortality.
• Side-effects include hypotension and oedema, which may limit use
• Amlodipine has more selective vasodilating properties, and at doses of
2.5–5 mg daily may be useful in those intolerant of the other agents, or
if right ventricular function is impaired
• Calcium antagonists should be started in hospital and titrated with
careful monitoring
• Verapamil is not used, because of its negative inotropic effects.

Prostacyclin analogues Prostacylin is a potent vasodilator. It inhibits
platelet aggregation, and has antiproliferative and cytoprotective properties. Side-effects include jaw pain, diarrhoea, and arthralgias.
• Epoprostenol This potent vasodilator acts via increasing intracellular
cAMP. It is a prostacyclin analogue (PGI2). It is the only drug shown to
improve survival in a randomized controlled trial. It probably has its
effects as a selective pulmonary vasodilator, and potentially through
vascular remodelling and platelet adhesion. It also improves exercise
capacity and haemodynamics. It is inactive within the circulation after
5 min and therefore needs to be given by continuous intravenous infusion via a portable pump and Hickman line. Pump failure can be lifethreatening. Side-effects include jaw pain, diarrhoea, headache, ﬂushing,
and nausea and are usually dose related
• Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue that can be given as a continuous
subcutaneous infusion, as it has greater in vivo stability than epoprostenol. It improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and pulmonary haemodynamics. Pain at the infusion site is the major side-effect
• Beraprost is the ﬁrst orally active prostaglandin analogue, with a half-life
of about 40 min. A qds dose has been shown to increase 6-min walk
distance, without improvement in pulmonary haemodynamics, but
initial improvements have not been maintained at 9 and 12 months, and
it is not used in the UK

IPAH: DISEASE-TARGETED THERAPY

• Iloprost is a prostacyclin analogue and is more potent than epoprostenol. It has a half-life of 25 min and can be given by continuous intravenous infusion or nebulizer (6–9 times a day)
• Even though patients may be vasodilator non-responders, they may
beneﬁt from long-term treatment with disease-targeted therapy
• Prostaglandin treatment doubles the time on the lung transplantation
waiting list, and improves transplantation outcomes. Improved haemodynamics may lead to some patients coming off transplant waiting lists
• Failure to show improved exercise capacity following one month’s
treatment with prostaglandin therapy is often considered an indication
for lung transplantation
• Tolerance develops to intravenous prostaglandin therapy, with
increasing dose requirements over time. The mechanism for this is
unclear.

Endothelin receptor antagonists Endothelin is a powerful vasoconstrictor and pro-inﬂammatory mediator, and causes smooth muscle cell proliferation. Plasma levels raised in some forms of pulmonary hypertension.
• Bosentan is an oral endothelin receptor A and B antagonist that has
been shown to improve exercise capacity, haemodynamics, and time to
clinical worsening. It is the ﬁrst oral therapy approved for the treatment
of IPAH and PAH related to connective tissue disease. Side-effects
include liver enzyme abnormalities. Three-year survival for a cohort of
mainly WHO functional class III patients starting on bosentan is greater
than 85%. The major side-effect is reversible liver transaminitis, causing
discontinuation in approximately 3%
• Sitaxentan is a selective endothelin type A receptor antagonist. The type
B receptor on the endothelium clears endothelin from the circulation,
but also contributes to vasoconstriction on the smooth muscle cell.
There is no clear evidence for superiority over the dual blockade of
bosentan, although liver side-effects may be lower
• Ambisentan is another selective type A blocker, with a different structure from sitaxentan and bosentan, giving it a better liver safety proﬁle.
It has not yet received a UK licence.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors e.g. sildenaﬁl augment the vasodilatory effects of nitric oxide and improve exercise capacity and haemodynamics in IPAH in patients in functional classes II and III.
Current practice Start patients with a negative vasodilator response
on one of the above three classes of drug. Unwell patients in NYHA functional class IV will usually start on an infusion of epoprostenol, but if unable
to cope with the practicalities of a continuous infusion, will be considered
for other treatment modalities. Functional class III patients usually start
on an endothelin-receptor antagonist, given the long-term data available
for these agents. Functional class II patients may be considered for sildenaﬁl or endothelin receptor antagonists. As in many other diseases, such
as asthma or systemic hypertension, when patients are failing on monotherapy, other therapies may be added. Data for various combinations are
available from case series and some randomized studies, but larger studies
are needed to show unequivocal beneﬁt.

CHAPTER 38

Pulmonary hypertension

IPAH: surgical treatments, end of life
care, and future developments
Surgical treatments
Atrial septostomy Creation of a right–left shunt by balloon atrial septostomy aims to increase systemic blood ﬂow by bypassing the pulmonary
circulation, particularly in patients with syncope or severe right heart
failure. It is a palliative procedure and can be used for symptom control
prior to transplantation, with the defect being closed at the time of transplant. Arterial desaturation occurs following the procedure, but is normally
offset by the increased cardiac output seen with increased oxygen delivery.
It is not indicated in severe left heart failure or in patients with impaired left
ventricular function.
Transplantation Improves survival and quality of life in patients with pulmonary hypertension. In those with preserved left ventricular function, lung
transplant is the procedure of choice. Return of normal right ventricular
function is found after transplantation.
• As for all diseases needing transplantation, timing of referral and
operation is crucial, as organ availability is limited
• The incidence of obliterative bronchiolitis appears to be higher
post-transplantation for IPAH than in transplantation for other
diseases, although the reason for this is uncertain.

End of life care Palliative care may be warranted to improve symptoms
such as fatigue, breathlessness, abdominal bloating, nausea, and pain (see
p 713).

Future developments Combination therapies are likely to be used
more frequently in the future. A number of agents are currently being
investigated, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and drugs with
anti-proliferative effects such as simvastatin, imatinib, and rapamycin.

CHAPTER 38

Pulmonary hypertension

Non-idiopathic pulmonary
hypertension: causes
The majority of patients with pulmonary hypertension seen by a respiratory specialist will have PHT due to chronic hypoxic lung disease, such
as COPD. In this case, the pulmonary hypertension is often an incidental
ﬁnding in a patient with a chronic respiratory disease.

Chronic hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction and in the longer
term vascular remodelling.
• A signiﬁcant proportion of COPD patients will develop PHT, possibly
up to 25%. The level of PAP in these patients is much lower than that
seen in patients with IPAH
• COPD with pulmonary hypertension has a much poorer prognosis
than COPD without pulmonary hypertension. In patients with a PAP
<25 mmHg, the 5-year survival is >90%. In those with a PAP >45
mmHg, the 5-year survival is <10%. Whether this is due to the pulmonary hypertension itself, or whether the pulmonary hypertension is a
marker of worse hypoxia and disease severity is unclear
• PHT in COPD was thought to be due to hypoxia and emphysematous
destruction of the vascular bed, but neither of these factors correlates
well with PAP. Cigarette smoke may have a direct effect on the intrapulmonary vessels, with the up-regulation of mediators leading to aberrant
vascular structural remodelling and physiological changes in vascular
function

Alveolar hypoventilation, e.g. due to neuromuscular disease. Both
alveolar hypoxia and hypercapnia produce pulmonary vasoconstriction,
thereby increasing pulmonary artery pressures.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
is a frequent cause of pulmonary hypertension. Recent data suggest that
CTEPH occurs in up to 4% of cases of acute non-fatal pulmonary embolism, higher than previously thought. Pathogenesis is uncertain, with no
consistent defect in ﬁbrinolytic activity demonstrated. Natural history
of pulmonary thromboemboli is resolution or near total resolution
of clot, with restoration of normal pulmonary haemodynamics within
30 days in 90% of patients. Right-sided pressures return to normal in most
patients by 2 weeks. In CTEPH, thromboemboli do not resolve, forming
endothelialized ﬁbrotic obstructions of the pulmonary vascular bed. In situ
thrombosis and vascular remodelling of small distal pulmonary arteries
also contribute. Peripheral IPAH-like vasculopathic changes are also seen,
which has led some to suggest that IPAH and CTEPH are a continuum of
disease; in situ thrombosis in IPAH can be extensive, and it is possible that
in situ, rather than embolic, thrombus may be more important in CTEPH.
Neovascularization from bronchial and intercostal arteries develops
through residual adhesions between the chest wall and visceral pleura. The
clinical deterioration parallels the loss of right ventricular functional capacity.
Risk factors for CTEPH include increasing age, idiopathic PE, and a
larger perfusion defect. Splenectomy is associated, possibly by inducing
a pro-thrombotic state due to loss of ﬁltering function of the spleen.
Antiphospholipid antibodies are present in 10–20% of patients. The

NON-IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY HYPERTENSION: CAUSES

diagnosis is not usually made until advanced pulmonary hypertension
is present. Progressive pulmonary hypertension seems to result from
changes in the small peripheral resistance vessels in the vascular bed, as
opposed to being due to progressive pulmonary events. Secondary hypertensive changes, probably induced by high pulmonary artery pressures,
lead to incremental increases in right ventricular afterload, with increasing
pulmonary hypertension, ultimately leading to right ventricular failure.

Collagen vascular disease PAH develops in about 15% of patients
with scleroderma, and is most frequently seen as an isolated phenomenon
in patients with limited cutaneous disease. Also occurs secondary to interstitial lung disease with a very poor prognosis. Life expectancy is <1 year
in patients with collagen vascular disease, isolated pulmonary hypertension, and a gas transfer of <25% of normal. Obliteration of the alveolar
capillaries and arteriolar narrowing is induced by both the primary vascular disease and any interstitial ﬁbrosis. Other connective tissue diseases,
including rheumatoid arthritis and SLE, can also lead to secondary pulmonary hypertension. There is an association with Raynaud’s phenomenon and
a female predominance is seen.
Drugs and toxins Damage to the pulmonary artery endothelium can
be caused by drugs, e.g. anorectic agents such as fenﬂuramine, dexfenﬂuramine, cocaine, and amphetamines. The clinical syndrome can be
indistinguishable from IPAH. A careful history must therefore be taken.
The absolute risk for pulmonary hypertension with anorectic agents is
28 cases per million person-years of exposure. Pulmonary hypertension
can develop within weeks of starting the drug.

Pulmonary arteritis PHT secondary to Behçet’s or Takayashu’s
arteritis is associated with systemic arteritis in the supra-aortic trunk.
Typical lesions are seen at pulmonary angiography, with in situ thrombosis
and false aneurysms.

HIV infection Pulmonary hypertension is seen in up to 1 in 200 people
who are HIV positive, in the absence of AIDS. It is hypothesized that HIVinfected macrophages release vasoactive cytokines that lead to endothelial
damage and proliferation. Antiretroviral drugs may have a beneﬁcial effect
on pulmonary haemodynamics.
Congenital heart disease and shunts Pressure overload caused
by systemic to pulmonary shunts, e.g. ventricular septal defect and patent
ductus arteriosus, lead to PAH. The role of atrial septal defects in the
development of PAH is uncertain, with some suggesting they may be
bystanders in IPAH.
Portal hypertension Porto-pulmonary hypertension, seen in patients
with portal hypertension (of whatever cause), is probably due to the
failure of the liver to remove vasoactive substances from the portal circulation, with their resultant accumulation and presentation to the pulmonary
arterial endothelium.

Hyperthyroidism is also recognized as a cause.

CHAPTER 38

Pulmonary hypertension

Non-idiopathic pulmonary
hypertension: management
In this group of patients the diagnosis is usually made from echocardiography, and the treatment is optimal management of the underlying lung
disease, with the addition of oxygen and diuretics. Recent guidelines on
the management of pulmonary hypertension suggest that the management
protocol for patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (see
p 392) may also be suitable for patients with secondary hypertension, but
there is no evidence for most of these treatments in this context. In particular, evidence for treating pulmonary hypertension in hypoxic COPD,
other than with long-term oxygen therapy, does not exist. Current studies
will establish if agents such as bosentan or sildenaﬁl are of beneﬁt in
patients with secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension.

Disease-speciﬁc management
• Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension Patients with
chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension have a 5-year survival
of <10%, if the PAP >50 mmHg. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy
is the treatment of choice for proximal obstructive disease. This is the
surgical removal of organized thrombotic material, and aims to strip
away the pulmonary arterial endothelium, starting proximally and
extending out to remove all clot in the subsegmental levels. It is done
on cardiopulmonary bypass with circulatory arrest. The PAP usually
falls within 48 h of surgery. Operative mortality is <10% in experienced
hands
• Scleroderma Very few patients with scleroderma-associated PAH have
a positive vasodilator response and the signiﬁcance of it, when present,
is uncertain. These patients are treated similar to vasodilator nonresponder IPAH algorithms. Patients with systemic sclerosis should be
screened annually for pulmonary hypertension, even if no symptoms
are present
• Pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease should not
be treated with pulmonary vasodilators as these will increase ﬂow to
an already overloaded left heart. Treatment should be aimed at the
left-sided cardiac abnormality.

CHAPTER 39

Pulmonary thromboembolic disease

Epidemiology and pathophysiology
Deﬁnition A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a clinically signiﬁcant obstruction
of part or all of the pulmonary vascular tree, usually caused by thrombus
from a distant site.

Epidemiology
• The overall annual incidence is 60–70/100 000, with a UK annual death
rate of 100/million. The estimated overall population incidence of DVT
is 0.5 per 1000 person years
• PE may account for up to 15% of all post-operative deaths. It is the
commonest cause of death following elective surgery, and the
commonest cause of maternal death
• Post mortem studies have consistently shown a frequency of 7–9%, and
large in-patient studies have shown a frequency of around 1%, with a
mortality of 0.2%. The mortality is much higher in patients with serious
underlying comorbid disease
• The incidence is likely to be stable, but improved diagnostic methods
mean that it is probably reported more frequently.

Pathophysiology
• 75% of thrombi are generated in the deep venous system of the lower
limbs and pelvis, probably initiated by platelet aggregation around
venous valve sinuses. Activation of the clotting cascade leads to
thrombus formation, with Virchow’s triad (venous stasis, injury to the
vessel wall, and increased blood coaguability) predisposing to thrombus
formation. Venous stasis is increased by immobility and dehydration, and
leads to local accumulation of platelets and clotting factors. In addition,
coagulation factors may be altered in various disease states, e.g. in the
acute phase response, malignancy, and autoimmune disease
• 20% of leg thrombi embolize, with a higher incidence in above than
below knee clots. Large clots may lodge at the bifurcation of the main
pulmonary arteries, causing haemodynamic compromise. Smaller clots
will travel more distally, infarcting the lung and causing pleuritic pain.
These are more commonly multiple and bilateral, and are found most
often in the lower lobes, where blood ﬂow is greatest
• Thrombi can also develop in the right heart following myocardial
infarction
• Septic emboli are found in endocarditis, in association with intraventricular septal defects (paradoxical emboli), AV shunts, or central
venous access.

Haemodynamic effects of PE depend on the size of the clot and
which area of the pulmonary vascular tree it subsequently obstructs, as well
as the pre-existing state of the myocardium and pulmonary parenchyma.
• As the pulmonary vasculature in a healthy lung has a large capacitance,
the mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) does not rise until at least
50% of the vascular bed has been occluded
• As the PAP rises, right ventricular afterload increases, with a resulting
increase in right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

• The right ventricle will start to fail acutely as the PAP reaches over
40 mmHg
• This causes a reduction in pulmonary blood ﬂow, leading to reduced
left ventricular ﬁlling and a reduction in systemic blood pressure
• Adequate blood volume for right-sided heart ﬁlling is vital. The
secondary effects are much worse if right-sided ﬁlling cannot be
maintained, e.g. if the patient is dehydrated, hypovolaemic, or erect
• Hypoxia results from reduced cardiac output, low mixed venous PaO2
and higher perfusion to the remaining alveoli, leading to ventilation/perfusion mismatching in the unaffected lung
• Hypoxia will be worse if there is a larger premorbid V/Q spread, e.g. in
the elderly and in those with pre-existing lung disease. It is therefore
possible for a young healthy person to have a normal PaO2 and
A–a gradient following a PE
• A patient with a PAP of ≥40 mmHg cannot have acute PE as this
pressure cannot be achieved acutely. In this setting, the raised PAP
raises the possibility of chronic thromboembolic disease, pulmonary
hypertension, or another cause.

CHAPTER 39

Pulmonary thromboembolic disease

Aetiology
Risk factors can be divided into major and minor factors. This division is
important for an assessment of clinical probability.

Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE)
Major risk factors (relative risk x 5–20)
Surgery

Major abdominal/pelvic surgery
Orthopaedic surgery (especially lower limb)
Post-operative intensive care

Obstetrics

Late pregnancy (higher incidence with multiple births)
Caesarean section
Pre-eclampsia

Malignancy

Pelvic/abdominal
Metastatic/advanced

Lower limb problems

Fracture, varicose veins

Reduced mobility

Hospitalization
Institutional care

Previous proven VTE

Minor risk factors (relative risk x 2–4)
Cardiovascular

Congenital heart disease
Congestive cardiac failure
Hypertension
Central venous access
Superﬁcial venous thrombosis

Oestrogens

Oral contraceptive pill (especially third-generation
higher oestrogen containing)
Hormone replacement therapy

Miscellaneous

Occult malignancy
Neurological disability
Thrombotic disorders
Obesity
Inﬂammatory bowel disease
Nephrotic syndrome
Dialysis
Myeloproliferative disorders
Behçet’s disease

AETIOLOGY

Risk of malignancy Occult cancer will be present in 7–12% of patients
presenting with idiopathic venous thromboembolism (VTE). Malignancy
may be detected by careful clinical assessment, routine blood tests, and
chest radiography. Screening for malignancy in these patients is not recommended, unless suspected clinically. These patients are more likely to
have a poor prognosis, because of regional spread or distant metastases
at diagnosis.

Inherited thrombophilias
• 25–50% of patients with VTE have an identiﬁable inherited thrombophilia, e.g. antiphospholipid syndrome, deﬁciency of antithrombin III,
a prothrombin gene defect, protein C or protein S deﬁciency
• These usually need to interact with an additional acquired risk factor
to cause VTE
• Factor V Leiden deﬁciency is present in 5% of the population and
20% of patients presenting with thrombosis
• Current recommendations do not advocate routine screening for
inheritable thrombophilias, unless in speciﬁc circumstances (see below),
as the number needed to test to prevent an episode of VTE would be
very high. In addition, detecting a heritable thrombophilia does not
predict a signiﬁcantly higher rate or earlier occurrence of VTE in the
absence of a secondary risk factor
Thrombophilia testing is recommended in:
• Patients with recurrent venous thrombosis
• Patients <40 with venous thrombosis with no obvious risk factors
• First venous thromboembolism with a clear family history in ﬁrstdegree relatives
• Thrombosis secondary to pregnancy, oral contraceptive pill, hormone
replacement therapy
• Thrombosis at an unusual site—cerebral, mesenteric, portal, or hepatic
veins
All but factor V Leiden deﬁciency and the prothrombin gene mutation
need to be tested for when the patient is off anticoagulants.

‘Economy class syndrome’ refers to thromboembolic disease association with long distance sedentary travel, with an increasing incidence of
disease with increasing distance travelled. A 2001 study of 135.29 million
passengers showed an incidence of PE of 1.5 cases/million for travel over
5000 km, compared with 0.01 cases/million for travel under 5000 km. For
travel over 10 000 km, the incidence increased to 4.8 cases/million.

CHAPTER 39

Pulmonary thromboembolic disease

Clinical features
Acute PE typically presents in four main ways.
• Pulmonary infarction and haemoptysis (in 60%) ± pleuritic pain.
Arterial blood gases may be normal, and ECG changes uncommon.
Localizing signs may be present, e.g. pleural rub
• Isolated dyspnoea (in 25%) Deﬁned as acute breathlessness in the
absence of haemorrhage or circulatory collapse. The thrombus is more
likely to be central, with hypoxia on blood gases. The patient may have
sudden onset and unexplained breathlessness, in the presence of risk
factors for VTE
• Collapse, poor reserve (in 10%) May be due to a small PE, often in an
elderly patient with limited cardiorespiratory reserve. These patients
can rapidly decompensate with even a relatively small PE. The clinical
ﬁndings may be non-speciﬁc and reﬂect the underlying disease process,
rather than the PE itself
• Circulatory collapse in a previously well patient Hypotension ± loss of
consciousness in 1%. Usually due to extensive pulmonary artery
occlusion from massive PE causing marked hypoxia and hypocapnia
(due to hyperventilation) and acute right heart failure, with chest pain
due to right heart angina, raised JVP, and fainting on sitting up. ECG may
be normal, show sinus tachycardia or right heart strain. Echocardiogram
shows pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure. These
patients have the highest mortality, up to 30%.
Chronic thromboembolic disease This typically presents with more
insidious onset breathlessness over the course of weeks–months due to
increasing load of recurrent small volume clot. See p 398.
Dyspnoea and tachypnoea (a respiratory rate >20) are the commonest
presenting features and are absent in only 10% of patients.
Consider PE in the differential diagnosis of:
• Unexplained shortness of breath
• Collapse
• New onset atrial ﬁbrillation
• Signs consistent with right heart failure
• Pleural effusion

CHAPTER 39

Pulmonary thromboembolic disease

Diagnosis of acute PE
The diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism can be difﬁcult and involves a
clinical assessment of probability. This takes risk factors, clinical presentation, and clinical signs into account. Investigations are then performed, that
may add weight to the clinical decision, rather than being stand-alone diagnostic tests. Therefore the estimation of the pre-test clinical probability of
PE is of vital importance in interpreting the results of the tests performed.

Pre-test clinical probability scoring systems One example is the
BTS pre-test clinical probability scoring system, shown in the box below.
A standard assessment of pre-test clinical probability might include:
• (a) Patient has clinical features compatible with PE:
• raised respiratory rate
• ± haemoptysis
• ± pleuritic chest pain
• Plus 2 other factors:
• 1. Absence of another reasonable clinical explanation
• 2. Presence of a major risk factor (see box, p 426)
• (a) plus 1 and 2: HIGH pre-test clinical probability
• (a) plus 1 or 2: INTERMEDIATE pre-test clinical probability
• (a) alone: LOW pre-test clinical probability
The Wells and Geneva pre-test probability scores are similar to the
above, but include separate scores for clinical features such as heart rate,
haemoptysis, and blood gas estimates (Geneva). Local scoring systems
may be in place. These scoring systems should always be used with the
D-dimer result.

D-dimer has an important role in diagnosing and excluding PE, and
should only be used with a pre-test clinical probability assessment following
careful clinical evaluation by an experienced clinician. D-dimers are sensitive for thromboembolism, but not speciﬁc. They are rarely in the normal
range in cases of acute thromboembolism, but are not a valid screening
test for PE alone. D-dimers are generated as a result of ﬁbrinolysis, which
occurs in many clinical situations, including sepsis, post surgery, pneumonia,
neoplasia, inﬂammatory disease, pregnancy, and advanced age.
• Only a normal result (which excludes PE) is of clinical value
• An abnormal result (however high) does not necessarily imply a
signiﬁcantly increased probability of PE
• The sensitivity ranges from 87% to 99%, depending on the assay used
(ELISA (Vidas) or red cell agglutination (SimpliRED)). Speciﬁcity is
poorer, around 60–70% (so a large number of false positives)
• The different assays have different performance characteristics and
these should be known before incorporating them into diagnostic
algorithms

DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE PE

• D-dimer testing for excluding PE has been validated as an out-patient
test, but not in in-patient groups
• A low or intermediate pre-test clinical probability score, combined
with a negative D-dimer has a 92% sensitivity at excluding PE

D-dimer test interpretation
• A negative D-dimer test reliably excludes PE in patients with a low
(SimpliRED) or intermediate pre-test clinical probability (Vidas).
These patients do not need further imaging
• A negative test is unhelpful in those with a high clinical probability
and therefore should not be done in this situation
• A positive result needs further investigation, but does not necessarily
imply PE
• The D-dimer becomes less useful the longer the period spent in
hospital (i.e. increasing false positives), due to clot formation at venepuncture sites, venous stasis due to bed rest, etc.
Assessment and documentation of pre-test clinical probability in PE is
paramount. This enables accurate clinical assessment, and may obviate the
need for imaging.
An alternative explanation should be sought when PE is excluded.

409

CHAPTER 39

Pulmonary thromboembolic disease

Investigations
• ECG Non-speciﬁc changes are frequent. Most commonly sinus
tachycardia. Atrial ﬁbrillation, right bundle branch block, anterior
T-wave inversion (indicating R ventricular strain) are common.
The S1Q3T3 pattern is uncommon
• CXR A good quality departmental CXR is required. No speciﬁc features are characteristic in PE, but it may reveal another pathology. Small
effusions are present in 40% (80% are exudates, 20% transudates).
Focal inﬁltrates, segmental collapse, and a raised hemi-diaphragm
can also occur
• Arterial blood gas may be normal, especially in the young and healthy.
Hypoxia and hypocapnia, due to hyperventilation, with an increased
A–a gradient are more common
• D-dimer (see p 408)
• Troponin and natriuretic peptides are sensitive markers of right ventricular dysfunction and early data suggest a raised troponin predicts
poorer prognosis
• CTPA is the gold standard investigation, and is now recommended as
the initial imaging technique in suspected non-massive PE. It has a
sensitivity of >95%, and may enable an alternative diagnosis to be
made if PE is excluded. Advances in imaging mean that a 16-slice
multi-detector row scanner can image the entire chest with resolution
approaching 1 mm, requiring a breath-hold of less than 10 s. Emboli can
be detected in sixth-order pulmonary vessels, which are so small that
their clinical relevance is uncertain. CTPA should be performed within
1 h in suspected massive PE, and within 24 h of suspected non-massive
PE. The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of CTPA depends on the location of
the emboli, with lower sensitivity for clot conﬁned to the segmental
or sub-segmental pulmonary vessels compared with more central clot.
CTPA needs specialist reporting.
In those with a high clinical probability but negative CTPA the options are:
• PE has been excluded, stop anticoagulation, or
• Perform further imaging (leg ultrasound, conventional pulmonary
angiogram, venous phase CT to include the legs)
In one large prospective multicentre study, with all patients investigated
with CTPA and leg ultrasound, those with negative tests and low or
intermediate clinical probability were not anticoagulated. Only 0.2% had
a deﬁnite PE after 3 months of follow-up. Those with negative tests but
high clinical probability were investigated further, and PE was identiﬁed in 5%
(Musset D et al. Lancet 2002; 360: 1914).
A volume of 100–150 ml contrast media is required for CTPA, which
poses a substantial risk of nephropathy (in patients with renal insufﬁciency
and diabetes) and sometimes ﬂuid overload (patients with impaired left
ventricular function). In these patients, leg ultrasound and/or isotope lung
scanning might be safer ﬁrst line investigations.

INVESTIGATIONS

• Isotope lung scanning (ventilation/perfusion or V/Q scan)—mostly now
superseded by CTPA. Some units may just perform the Q (perfusion)
part of the scan. May be useful as a ﬁrst-line imaging investigation in
patients with a normal CXR and with no concurrent cardiopulmonary
disease, in whom a negative scan can reliably exclude a PE. Scans are
reported as low, intermediate, or high probability, and the report’s
meaning must be interpreted in light of the pre-test clinical probability
score. Further imaging is necessary for those in whom:
• The scan is indeterminate
• There is a discordant scan result and clinical probability.

The clinical signiﬁcance of the V/Q scan report is:
• Normal = no PE
• Low or intermediate pre-test clinical probability plus low probability
scan = PE excluded
• High pre-test clinical probability plus high probability scan = PE diagnosed
• Any other = need further imaging.

Other imaging techniques
• Leg ultrasound—around 70% of patients with a proven PE have a
proximal DVT; hence leg imaging can be used as an alternative to lung
imaging in those with clinical DVT. A single examination is not adequate
to exclude subclinical DVT (venography is more sensitive). It is safe to
withhold anticoagulation in patients with suspected DVT and a single
negative leg ultrasound, but these data cannot yet be extrapolated to
those presenting with suspected PE. If a leg ultrasound is positive in a
patient with clinical features of PE, this excludes the need for further
imaging. Up to 50% of patients with a clinically obvious DVT will have a
high-probability V/Q scan
• Conventional pulmonary angiogram is available in a few specialist
centres only, where catheter fragmentation of large clots may be of
therapeutic beneﬁt. Now mostly superseded by CTPA
• CT venography is an emerging area. It can be combined with CTPA to
image the pelvic leg veins simultaneously
• Echocardiogram is diagnostic in sub-massive and massive PE. The
transoesophageal route is more sensitive, enabling visualization of
intrapulmonary and intracardiac clot. May give prognostic information
• Transthoracic ultrasound is used uncommonly. May show peripheral
infarcts with peripheral pulmonary emboli.

CHAPTER 39

Pulmonary thromboembolic disease

22 Management of acute massive PE
Acute massive PE has a mortality of 20%.
1. Oxygen—100%, via non-rebreathe mask
2. IV access. Send baseline bloods, including clotting. Perform ECG
3. Analgesia if required; consider opiates
4. Management of cardiogenic shock—ﬂuids and inotropes may be
required in sub-massive or massive PE to maintain right ventricular
ﬁlling
5. Start IV heparin unless active GI bleeding or intracerebral
haemorrhage:
• Bolus dose 5000–10 000 units or 80 IU/kg
• Maintenance infusion of 1300 IU/h or 18 units/kg/h
• Adjust infusion rate until APTT is 1.5–2.5× control. Check APTT4–
6 h after initial bolus and 6–10 h after any dose change. When
APTT is in the therapeutic range, check it daily
6. Investigation to conﬁrm PE depends on the clinical state of patient.
Ideally perform urgent echocardiogram and if this is non-diagnostic,
perform a CTPA, but not delaying for more than 1 h. It may, however,
be unwise to move a sick patient to the radiology department for a
CTPA. If there is circulatory collapse and the patient is peri-arrest
and PE is the most likely cause, conﬁrmation of the diagnosis should
not be sought, but treatment prioritized. Remember aortic dissection, cardiac tamponade, and acute MI can mimic PE
7. Thrombolysis if collapsed or hypotensive, if no active GI bleeding or
intracerebral haemorrhage:
• Alteplase 100 mg over 2 h given peripherally
• Or streptokinase 250 000 units in 30 min with 100 000 units/h for
24 h (plus hydrocortisone to prevent further circulatory instability)
• Or urokinase 4400 IU/kg in 10 min and 4400 IU/kg/h for 12 h
• Stop the heparin during thrombolysis and restart afterwards
• In cardiac arrest due to suspected massive PE, 50 mg IV alteplase
immediately may be life-saving
8. Consider liaising with cardiothoracic centre to consider embolectomy,
particularly if thrombolysis is contraindicated.
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is as effective as standard unfractionated intravenous heparin, and should be given to patients with intermediate or a high pre-test clinical probability prior to imaging.
Unfractionated heparin should be considered in massive PE (faster onset of
action) as a ﬁrst dose bolus prior to commencement of LMWH.
Oral anticoagulation should only be commenced once PE is proven, after
initial heparin treatment. Target INR 2.0–3.0 (when achieved, heparin can
be stopped). Some centres now advocate out-patient anticoagulation for
PE, as well as DVT. Recent data suggest that this is as safe as in-patient
anticoagulation, in a carefully selected population, in centres with a wellestablished out-patient DVT service.
Length of warfarin anticoagulation
• Temporary risk factor: 4–6 weeks. This is an area of some debate
• First episode of idiopathic PE: 3 months is currently recommended,
though some still advocate 6 months warfarin treatment

INVESTIGATIONS

• Recurrent idiopathic PE: no guidelines exist; length of treatment
depends on individual circumstances, with risk of bleeding balanced
with risk of recurrent event, and often long-term anticoagulation
• Persisting risk factors: lifelong anticoagulation may be recommended
Side-effects
• The risk of bleeding increases with age and concurrent illness
• Higher bleeding rate with concomitant aspirin use, and previous
gastrointestinal bleed
• Risk of bleeding relates to duration and intensity of anticoagulation.

Thrombolysis There is emerging evidence to support the use of thrombolysis in certain subgroups of patients with PE; however, this is a controversial area, and the risk/beneﬁt analysis of this treatment must always be
carefully considered.
Massive PE causing circulatory collapse. Current BTS guidelines (2003)
support the use of early thrombolysis in massive PE. In practice, thrombolysis is usually given to the acutely unwell/peri-arrest patient, when the
history and physical ﬁndings are suggestive of massive PE, in the absence of
another reasonable explanation. There is rarely time for imaging or investigations in this situation.
Non-massive PE is more controversial. Some evidence now supports the
use of intravenous alteplase in addition to IV heparin in the treatment of
haemodynamically stable submassive PE, in association with pulmonary
hypertension or right ventricular dysfunction. Current BTS guidelines recommend thrombolysis only for patients with clinically massive PE. Increasing
evidence suggests that individuals with a large clot volume, in the absence
of haemodynamic compromise, have better clinical outcomes with thrombolysis. This is due to the prevention of chronic thromboembolic disease, as
larger clot volume is a risk factor for this. More data is required.
Contraindications None absolute; rarely a consideration in the lifethreatening situation. Risk of major haemorrhage is 3–4 times that of
heparin, with a higher incidence of bleeding in the elderly. Active bleeding
or recent intracerebral bleed are contraindications.
Embolectomy Rarely done, and only in life-threatening massive PE.
Options include surgical embolectomy (few regional centres only) and
mechanical clot fragmentation via right heart catheterization.

IVC ﬁlter placement There is little evidence to show improved survival
or reduction in recurrent PE rate with IVC ﬁlters, and changing to low
molecular weight heparin may be as effective. IVC ﬁlters may, however, be
indicated in:
• Acute VTE in patients with an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation
• Patients with massive PE who survive (a second PE may be fatal)
• Recurrent VTE despite adequate anticoagulation
• Post-pulmonary thromboendarterectomy in pulmonary hypertension.

CHAPTER 39

Pulmonary thromboembolic disease

Special circumstances
Pregnancy and thromboembolic disease
• The incidence of DVT ± PE in pregnancy is 1 in 1000, rising to 2 in 1000
in the puerperium. The risk of PE in pregnancy is greater with increasing
maternal age and with increasing gestational age. More PEs occur
during pregnancy than after delivery. There is a 20–30 times increased
risk with Caesarean section, compared with normal vaginal delivery.
PE is one of commonest causes of maternal death in pregnancy
(1/100 000 pregnancies)
• D-dimers are raised in the normal pregnancy and so are usually
unhelpful in the investigation of thromboembolic disease
• The CTPA whole-body radiation dose is 2–4 mGy, with an absorbed
dose to the fetus of 0.01 mSv. This equates to a risk of fatal cancer to
age 15 of <1 in 1 million. The absorbed dose to the breast is 10 mSv
(higher in pregnancy). CTPA increases the lifetime breast cancer risk in
premenopausal women from 10% to 11.4%, with an even higher risk in
pregnancy
• The V/Q scan whole-body radiation dose is 1.5–2 mGy, with an
absorbed dose to the fetus of 0.12 mSv. This equates to a risk of fatal
cancer to age 15 of 1 in 280,000. The absorbed dose to the breast is
0.28 mSv
• The overall radiation risk depends on the gestation of the fetus and the
metabolic activity of the pregnant breast tissue. There is considerable
debate as to which imaging technique is best in pregnancy, in terms of
radiation risk to both the mother (including breast tissue) and the fetus.
The lowest overall risk favours a Q scan as the ﬁrst-line
investigation, especially as this young healthy population are likely to
have normal lungs. Some experts suggest a leg ultrasound ﬁrst (see p 64)
• In those with antenatal thromboembolic disease, low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH) is used. Close to delivery, this is changed to unfractionated heparin, as it is easier to monitor and to reverse its effects. It is
unclear whether heparin should be stopped or the dose reduced at the
time of delivery. LMWH levels can be monitored with anti-Xa levels
• There are case reports of successful thrombolysis, catheter-directed
thrombolysis, and embolectomy in massive PE, but no relevant trials
• Warfarin is teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnancy, although it
is safe in breast-feeding
• Anticoagulation should be continued for 6 weeks after delivery or
3 months following initial episode, whichever is longer.

SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

Thromboembolic disease and the oral contraceptive
pill/HRT
• The OCP, pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
increase the risk of PE, but the incidence of fatal PE is low—estimated
at 1/100 000 OCP users, with a median age of 29
• Risk of fatal PE is twice as high amongst those taking
third-generation pills
• Previous history of DVT or PE is a contraindication to the OCP
• Meta-analyses show a relative risk of VTE of 2.1 in HRT users, which is
highest in the ﬁrst year of use.

Flight prophylaxis for thromboembolic disease
• For patients with high risk of a PE, i.e. previous VTE, within 6 weeks of
surgery, or current malignancy, the 1997 BTS Guidelines recommend
low-dose aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, or formal anticoagulation (INR 2–3) prior to ﬂying
• For those with moderate or low risk, graduated or compression
stockings with or without pre-ﬂight aspirin is suggested.

Future developments
Thrombolysis Further research is ongoing regarding the use of thrombolysis in non-massive PE and more data are likely in the next few years.
Low-intensity warfarin therapy A reduced target INR of 1.5–2.0 may be
used. A study of a cohort of patients treated for up to 4.3 years, following
6 months of standard warfarin therapy for idiopathic venous thromboembolism, led to a 48% reduction in recurrent VTE, major haemorrhage, or
death compared with placebo (Ridker PM et al, NEJM 2003; 348: 1425).

CHAPTER 39

Pulmonary thromboembolic disease

Rare causes
Air embolism Air is found within the arterial or venous circulation.
Small amounts of air can be tolerated, but large amounts can lodge in the
pulmonary vasculature and cause mechanical obstruction and death. This
is rare.
Causes Neck vein cannulation, intrauterine manipulations (such as criminal
abortion, where a frothy liquid is passed under pressure into the uterus),
bronchial trauma, or barotrauma causing air to enter the pulmonary
vein and left heart. Air in the left ventricle causes impairment to venous
ﬁlling and subsequent poor coronary perfusion as air enters the coronary
arteries.
Diagnosis Arterial air emboli may cause dizziness, loss of consciousness,
and convulsions. Air may be seen in the retinal arteries or from transected
vessels. Venous air emboli may cause raised venous pressure, cyanosis,
hypotension, tachycardia, syncope, and a ‘mill-wheel’ murmur over the
praecordium.
Treatment Patients should lie on their right side, with head down and feet
up, to allow air to collect and stay at the cardiac apex. From here it can be
aspirated via thoracotomy.

Amniotic ﬂuid embolism is estimated to occur in 1 in 25 000–80 000
live births. It is the third commonest cause of maternal death, and the
most common cause of death in the immediate post-partum period.
Usually catastrophic, 80% of women die, 20–50% of these in the ﬁrst hour.
An anaphylactic-type response to amniotic ﬂuid entering the circulation
is seen. Amniotic ﬂuid enters the circulation because of torn fetal membranes, which can occur in Caesarean section, uterine or cervical trauma,
or uterine rupture. It has a thromboplastic effect, causing disseminated
intravascular coagulation and thrombi to form in pulmonary vessels.
Not all women react in this way to amniotic ﬂuid. It is more common in
older multiparous mothers, who have had short tumultuous labour, often
involving uterine stimulants.
Clinically presents with sudden onset respiratory distress, hypoxia, bronchospasm, cyanosis, cardiovascular collapse, pulmonary oedema, convulsions, coma, and cardiac arrest. Coagulopathy with intractable uterine
bleeding and uterine atony is seen.
Diagnosis is clinical. Fetal debris/cells can be identiﬁed in blood sampled
from the maternal pulmonary artery, but this is not pathognomonic.
Treatment is supportive, whilst the thrombi clear from the maternal lungs.
Maintain the circulation with ﬂuids and inotropes. Respiratory support
with oxygen and ventilation may be needed. Correct coagulopathy with
fresh frozen plasma and packed cells. Control placental bleeding.

RARE CAUSES

Fat embolism Common pathological ﬁnding following long bone
fractures. Occurs especially with lower limb fractures—pelvis and femur.
Commoner in fractures that have not been immobilized. Can also occur
after prosthetic joint replacement, cardiac massage, liver trauma, burns,
bone marrow transplant, rapid high-altitude decompression, and liposuction.
Generally occurs in the young and previously healthy. Presents 24–72 h
post-fracture. Marrow fat enters the circulation and lodges in the lungs,
causing mechanical obstruction.
Classically presents with hypoxia, coagulopathy, with a transient petechial
rash on the neck, axillae, and skinfolds, and neurological disturbance, such
as confusion, disorientation, or sometimes coma. Stable patients may
deteriorate with low-grade fever, petechial rash, hypoxia, and confusion.
Jaundice and renal dysfunction are possible.
Diagnosis is usually made clinically in a patient with a lower limb fracture
presenting with tachypnoea and hypoxia. Fat globules can be identiﬁed in
the urine. CXR shows bilateral alveolar inﬁltrates. ARDS can develop.
Treatment is with early immobilization of fracture, ﬂuid replacement,
oxygen, and supportive care.

Septic, hydatid, and tumour emboli are also causes. Uterine leiomyosarcoma has vascular tropism and can invade the inferior vena cava
and obstruct the pulmonary arteries. Teratomas can invade the IVC and
pulmonary arteries.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
Community-acquired pneumonia is a common disease, associated with
signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality.

Deﬁnition A syndrome of infection that is usually bacterial with symptoms and signs of consolidation of part(s) of the lung parenchyma. This is
different to bronchitis (see p 647).

Epidemiology
• CAP is the commonest infectious cause of death and the 6th leading
cause of death in the UK and USA (with age-adjusted death rates of
between 1 and 24/100 000)
• Up to 40% of UK adults with CAP require hospital admission. Hospital
mortality varies between 5% and 12%
• A BTS multicentre UK study showed that 5–10% of patients with CAP
require ICU admission
• Mortality is up to 50% in those admitted to ICU
• CAP managed in the community has a mortality of 1%.

Pathophysiology The lung and tracheobronchial tree are usually sterile
below the level of the larynx, so an infecting agent must reach this site via
a breach in host defences. This may be by micro-aspiration (which occurs
in around 45% of healthy individuals overnight), haematogenous spread,
direct spread from an adjacent structure, inhalation, or activation of previously dormant infection.
Aetiology Broadly similar pathogens are seen in patients managed in the
community and in hospital. A single pathogen is identiﬁed in 85% of cases.
The proportion of cases with more than one pathogen is unknown.

Risk factors for CAP
• Aspiration Typically caused by anaerobes and Gram-negative organisms
• Alcoholism and diabetes Typically associated with bacteraemic
pneumococcal pneumonia. Anaerobes and mixed infections are more
common in alcoholics
• Oral steroids/immunosuppression Legionella infection may be more
common
• Cigarette smoking is the strongest independent risk factor for invasive
pneumococcal disease in immunocompetent patients
• COPD Haemophilus inﬂuenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are more
common, and COPD is more common in those with bacterial pneumonia
• Nursing home residents have an increased frequency of CAP, with
aspiration, Gram-negative organisms, and anaerobes more common
than in age-matched elderly people. Haemophilus inﬂuenzae is the most
common causative organism. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella
are less common.

COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA

Organisms causing community-acquired pneumonia
• Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) —the most
frequently identiﬁed organism, commonest in winter, accounting for
two-thirds of all cases of bacteraemic pneumonia. Previous epidemics
in the UK have been associated with overcrowding, e.g. in prisons—
these are now very rare.
• Legionella pneumophilia—most common in the autumn. 52% are
travel-related. Epidemics occur related to water-containing systems in
buildings, typically in the Mediterranean
• Staphylococcus aureus—commonest in winter months. Coincident
inﬂuenza infection in 39% of those requiring hospital admission and
50% of those admitted to ICU
• Inﬂuenza—annual epidemics in the winter months, complicated by
pneumonia in 3% of community cases. 10% of those admitted to
hospital have coincident Staphylococcus aureus infection
• Mycoplasma pneumoniae—epidemics occur every 4 or 5 years
in the UK
• Chlamydia pneumoniae—epidemics in the community; whether it has
a direct pathogenic role, or is an associated infectious agent, is not
clear
• Chlamydia psittaci—infection acquired from birds and animals, with
20% of cases having a history of bird contact. Human-to-human
spread may occur. Uncommon
• Coxiella burnetii (Q fever)—epidemics in relation to animal sources
(usually sheep), but occupational exposure only present in 8%.
Uncommon.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

CAP: clinical features
•
•
•
•
•
•

Fever
Cough
Sputum
Shortness of breath
Pleuritic chest pain
Non-speciﬁc features in the elderly. May present ‘off legs’ or with
confusion, in the absence of fever.

Examination
• Raised respiratory rate (may be the only sign in the elderly)
• Tachycardia
• Localizing signs on chest examination. Reduced chest expansion on
the affected side, with signs consistent with consolidation (reduced air
entry, with bronchial breathing, reduced percussion note, increased
vocal resonance) and crackles. A normal chest examination makes the
diagnosis unlikely.

Diagnosis of CAP is made on the basis of:
•
•
•
•
•

Symptoms and signs of an acute lower respiratory tract infection
New focal chest signs
New radiographic shadowing, for which there is no other explanation
At least one systemic feature (e.g. sweating, fevers, aches, and pains)
No other explanation for the illness.

Most helpful in diagnosis
• Fever, pleuritic pain, dyspnoea, and tachypnoea
• Signs on chest examination.

Speciﬁc clinical features of pathogens The aetiological agent
cannot be accurately predicted from the clinical features alone, although
some features are more statistically likely with one pathogen than another.
The exception to this is the presence of chest pain or fever (>39°C) in
those admitted to ICU, which predicts a higher likelihood of streptococcal
pneumonia.
• Streptococcus pneumoniae Increasing age, comorbidity (especially
cardiovascular), acute onset, high fever, and pleuritic chest pain
• Bacteraemic Streptococcus pneumoniae Alcohol, diabetes, COPD, dry or
no cough, female
• Legionella Younger patients, smokers, absence of comorbidity, more
severe infection, neurological symptoms, evidence of multisystem
disease (e.g. abnormal liver enzymes and raised creatine kinase)
• Mycoplasma pneumoniae Younger patients, prior antibiotics, less
multisystem involvement, but extrapulmonary involvement including
haemolysis, cold agglutinins, hepatitis, skin and joint problems
• Staphylococcus aureus Recent inﬂuenza-like illness
• Chlamydia psittaci Longer duration of symptoms prior to admission,
headache.

CAP: CLINICAL FEATURES

• Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) Dry cough, high fever, headache, male. animal
exposure e.g. sheep and goats
• Klebsiella pneumoniae Low platelet count and leucopenia, male.
Rare causes
• Acinetobacter Older patients, history of alcoholism, high mortality
• Streptococcus milleri Dental or abdominal source of infection
• Streptococcus viridans Aspiration is a risk factor.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

CAP: severity assessment
• CAP has a wide range of severity. An assessment of severity enables the
most appropriate care to be delivered in the most appropriate clinical
setting
• Early identiﬁcation of patients at high risk of death allows early
decisions about hospital admission and possible need for assisted
ventilation to be made
• Assessment of disease severity depends on the experience of the
clinician; a number of predictive assessment models have been trialled.
These severity models should be regarded as adjuncts to clinical
assessment, and regular reassessment of the disease is needed.

Poor prognostic factors Those with two or more adverse prognostic
factors are at high risk of death and should be managed as for severe CAP.
• Age (≥65)
• Coexisting disease—including cardiac disease, diabetes, COPD, stroke
• Respiratory rate ≥30/min—this is one of the most reliable predictors of
disease severity
• Confusion—abbreviated mental test score ≤8
• Blood pressure—systolic ≤90 mmHg and/or diastolic ≤60 mmHg
• Hypoxaemia—respiratory failure with PaO2 <8 kPa and the need for
assisted ventilation predicts mortality
• Urea ≥7 mmol/L
• Albumin <35 g/L
• White cell count—a WCC >20 or <4 x 109/L are both predictive
• Radiology—bilateral or multilobe involvement. In patients admitted to
ICU, progression of CXR changes is a poor prognostic marker
• Microbiology—positive blood culture, whatever the pathogen isolated.
A commonly used severity assessment score is CURB or CURB-65, which
aims to predict morbidity and mortality in CAP. The Pneumonia Severity
Index (PSI) is an alternative, which may be more sensitive, but is much
more complicated, and includes information on comorbid disease and
laboratory tests before stratifying patients into 5 risk classes. Ewig’s score
is another severity assessment score.
CURB-65 score core factors
• Confusion—new mental confusion deﬁned (AMTS ≤ 8)
• Urea—≥7 mmol/L. Some scores omit this
• Respiratory rate raised ≥30/min
• Blood pressure—systolic BP ≤90 and/or diastolic BP ≤60
• 65 age ≥65
The presence of the 4 ‘core’ CURB factors correlates with mortality:
• 4 factors present gives a mortality of 83%, 3 factors 33%, 2 factors 23%,
8% with one, and 2.4% in the presence of no core factors

CAP: SEVERITY ASSESSMENT

• Low risk of death: age <50, no coexisting disease, CURB score zero
patients may be suitable for home treatment
• Pneumonia severity scores aim to contribute to, rather than supersede,
a clinical judgement; they include a potential over-emphasis on age.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

CAP: investigations
General investigations are aimed at conﬁrming the diagnosis, assessing
disease severity, guiding appropriate treatment, assessing the presence
of underlying disease, enabling identiﬁcation of complications, and monitoring progress.
• Oxygenation assessment Those with an oxygen saturation of <92% on
admission or with features of severe pneumonia should have arterial
blood gases measured. The inspired oxygen concentration must be
documented
• CXR
• Consolidation, most commonly in the lower lobes. Also interstitial
inﬁltrates and cavitation
• Multilobe involvement, more common in bacteraemic pneumococcal infection
• Pleural effusion, more common in bacteraemic pneumococcal
infection
• Lymphadenopathy, uncommon, but most likely with mycoplasma
infection
• Multilobe involvement, cavitation, or spontaneous pneumothorax
suggest Staphylococcus aureus infection
• Upper lobe preponderance suggests Klebsiella
• CT chest Unlikely to add additional information. May be useful if the
diagnosis is in doubt or the patient is severely ill and failing to respond
to treatment in order to exclude abscess formation, empyema, underlying malignancy, or other interstitial disease process.
• Blood tests
• FBC—a white cell count (WCC) >15 x 109 suggests bacterial
(particularly pneumococcal) infection. Counts of >20 or <4 indicate
severe infection
• Deranged renal and liver function tests can be indicative of severe
infection, or point to the presence of underlying disease. LFTs may
be abnormal, particularly with right lower lobe pneumonia. A raised
urea is a marker of more severe pneumonia
• Metabolic acidosis is associated with severe illness
• C-reactive protein may be useful in management, with high levels
being a more sensitive marker of infection than the white cell count
or temperature. Serial measures may be useful in assessing response
to treatment.
Microbiological investigations The microbiological cause for CAP is
not found in 25–60% of patients and therefore often does not contribute
to patient management. Microbiological investigations can help to aid
selection of optimal antibiotics, hence limiting antibiotic resistance and the
possible problems of Clostridium difﬁcile associated diarrhoea. They also
inform public health or infection control teams, aiding in the monitoring of
pathogen trends causing CAP over time.

CAP: INVESTIGATIONS

• Blood cultures Recommended for all patients with CAP, ideally before
antibiotics are started. About 10% of patients with CAP will have
positive blood cultures. The early availability of blood culture results
(within 24 h of admission) improves outcome.
• Sputum culture and sensitivity Useful for those patients who have
failed to improve with empirical antibiotic treatment, and in those with
non-severe pneumonia admitted to hospital who are expectorating
purulent samples and have not received prior antibiotics. Also useful
in severe pneumonia. Not routinely recommended for those treated
in the community. Sputum examination is recommended for possible
tuberculosis in those with weight loss, a persistent cough, night sweats,
and risk factors for TB, e.g. ethnic origin, social deprivation
• Pleural ﬂuid (if present) for M, C, & S and pH to exclude empyema
(see p 354)
• Viral and atypical pathogens In severe CAP only
• Serological testing Paired samples (from within 7 days of the onset
of the illness, repeated 7–10 days later) should be tested together, in
those with severe CAP, and in those unresponsive to B-lactam antibiotics. They are unlikely to guide initial treatment though.

Speciﬁc serological tests
• Pneumococcal pneumonia
• Urinary antigen (SpUA) has a sensitivity of 100% and speciﬁcity of
60–90% for invasive pneumococcal disease, and should be tested in
all patients with severe CAP
• Legionnaires’ disease A number of immunological tests exist to aid in
the prompt and accurate diagnosis of Legionella pneumophilia:
• Urinary antigen detection is about 70% sensitive and about 90%
speciﬁc for serogroup A, and rapid results can be obtained early.
A positive urinary antigen test correlates with subsequent ITU
admission
• Direct immunoﬂuorescence tests (DIF)—Legionella pneumophilia
can be detected on bronchial aspirates
• Culture is 100% speciﬁc (sputum, endotracheal aspirate, BAL,
pleural ﬂuid, lung)
• Serology—antibody levels and PCR are also available
• Mycoplasma pneumonia
• The complement ﬁxation test (CFT) is the commonest serological
assay and is regarded as the gold standard. Culture of Mycoplasma
pneumoniae is not generally available
• Chlamydia
• Chlamydial antigen can be detected by DIF in respiratory samples
or by CFT
• Others
• Inﬂuenza A and B, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus. Coxiella
burnetii indirect immunoﬂuorescence antibody test

427

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

CAP: management
General management
• Oxygen Hypoxia is due to V/Q mismatching, as blood ﬂows through
unventilated lung. Aim for oxygen saturation >92%. If there is severe
concomitant COPD, controlled oxygen therapy and close monitoring
of blood gases are mandatory. A rising CO2 in a patient without prior
respiratory disease may indicate they are tiring, and need respiratory
support—discuss with ITU early
• Non-invasive ventilatory support A number of studies demonstrate
beneﬁcial effects of NIV in severe CAP. However, following initial
improvement in physiological parameters, >50% of patients subsequently deteriorate, requiring intubation. A higher initial respiratory rate (>30) is associated with failure of non-invasive ventilatory
support (CPAP or bi-level ventilation). NIV may have a place in
the management of severe CAP, but should only be used in a high
dependency setting, with very close observation
• Fluids Assessment of volume status by JVP (with or without central
venous access) and blood pressure is paramount. Encourage oral ﬂuids.
Intravenous ﬂuids may be needed if volume depleted and severely
unwell. Monitor urine output
• Analgesia Paracetamol or NSAIDs initially if required. Paracetamol also
has an antipyretic role
• Nutrition Nutritional status is important to the outcome, and nutritional supplements may be of beneﬁt in prolonged illness. Poor nutritional status may increase the risk of acquiring pneumonia
• Physiotherapy is of no proven beneﬁt in acute pneumonia.

Additional treatments
Bronchoscopy May be helpful, especially after intubation on ITU, to suction
retained secretions, particularly if these are causing lobar collapse, to obtain
further samples for culture, and to exclude an endobronchial abnormality.
Steroids There is some evidence that these are of beneﬁt in severe bacterial
pneumonia.

Monitoring Temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure,
mental status, oxygen saturation, and inspired oxygen concentration
should be monitored twice daily, and more often in the severely ill.
ICU admission Those fulﬁlling criteria for severe CAP on admission,
or who fail to respond rapidly to treatment, should be considered for
transfer for close monitoring, either to a high dependency unit or to ICU.
Persisting hypoxia (PaO2 ≤8 kPa), acidosis, hypercapnia, hypotension, or
depressed conscious level, despite maximal therapy, are indications for
assisted ventilation. CPAP may be of beneﬁt whilst awaiting for the arrival
of the anaesthetist (although this may just be a more effective way of delivering 100% oxygen).

CAP: MANAGEMENT

When to discuss patient with CAP with ITU
• Always sooner rather than later
• Respiratory failure (PaO2 <8 kPa) despite high ﬂow oxygen
• Tiring patient, with a rising CO2
• Worsening metabolic acidosis, despite antibiotics and optimum ﬂuid
management
• Hypotension despite adequate ﬂuid resuscitation.

429

430

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

CAP: antibiotics
• Most antibiotics are used empirically at diagnosis of CAP in the
absence of microbiological information. The clinical scenario also guides
antibiotic choice, such as the addition of anaerobic cover in an alcoholic
who has a high chance of aspiration
• Severity assessment guides antibiotic therapy and the method of
antibiotic administration
• Local protocols and antibiotic resistance patterns may also guide
choice. Liaise closely with microbiologist.

General points
• Early administration of antibiotics is associated with an improved
outcome
• Antibiotics given before admission can inﬂuence the results of
subsequent microbiological investigations, but this should not delay
antibiotic administration in the community if the patient is unwell
• It is vital that there is no delay in the administration of the ﬁrst
antibiotic dose in patients admitted to hospital. The admitting doctor
should oversee its administration.
IV antibiotics will be needed in 30–50% of patients admitted to hospital.
Consider IV antibiotics if:
• Severe pneumonia
• Loss of swallow reﬂex
• Impaired absorption
• Impaired conscious level
Oral antibiotics should be used in those with community-managed
pneumonia, or those with non-severe hospital-managed pneumonia,
with no other contraindications.
• Add anaerobic antibiotic cover, e.g. metronidazole if possible aspiration
pneumonia in an unconscious patient, or if suspicion of a lung abscess
on CXR/CT
• Switch from IV to oral antibiotics as soon as possible, usually when a
patient has shown clear response to treatment, with a normal
temperature for 24 h
• A switch to oral co-amoxiclav, and not an oral cephalosporin is
recommended after treatment with IV cephalosporin
• For those treated with benzylpenicillin plus levoﬂoxacin, a switch to
oral levoﬂoxacin ± oral amoxicillin is recommended

Length of treatment
There is no evidence to guide treatment length, but consensus suggests
• 5–7 days—non-severe, uncomplicated pneumonia
• 10 days—severe microbiologically undeﬁned pneumonia
• 14–21 days—if Legionella, staphylococcal disease, Gram-negative
suspected
• Consult local antibiotic guidelines; concern regarding increasing rates
of Clostridium difﬁcile has lead to reduced antibiotic course length and
alternative empirical antibiotic choice in some centres. There is no evidence that any speciﬁc antibiotic (other than clindamycin) is more likely
to cause C. difﬁcile than any other

New ﬂuoroquinolones Moxiﬂoxacin is licensed in the UK for the treatment of non-severe CAP. It is not available for IV use. It has equivalence to
the other oral antibiotics used in CAP, but is not recommended for ﬁrstline treatment for CAP for community use, given the current low level of
pneumococcal resistance in the UK. Levoﬂoxacin is available in oral and
IV preparations, and is licensed for severe CAP. In the future, other ﬂuoroquinolones, e.g. gemaﬂoxacin and gatiﬂoxacin, are likely to extend the
choice of oral antibiotics for CAP when they are licensed in the UK. The
ketolides (e.g. telithromycin) are novel macrolides, with efﬁcacy against
penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant pathogens.

Antibiotic resistance Surveillance studies suggest that the UK prevalence of penicillin resistant S. pnemoniae is now about 20%. Macrolide
resistant organisms may be as high as 25–30%. Worldwide prevalence of
pneumococcal resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones is low, at <2%, though this
has increased substantially in some countries (e.g. Hong Kong) in recent
years (because of the spread of a ﬂuoroquinolone resistant clone).

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

CAP: treatment failure
A CRP that does not fall by >50% at 4 days suggests either treatment
failure, or the development of a complication such as a lung abscess or
empyema.

Causes of failure to improve
• Slow clinical response, particularly in the elderly patient
• Incorrect initial diagnosis
• Pulmonary thromboembolic disease
• Pulmonary oedema
• Bronchial carcinoma
• Bronchiectasis
• Also consider eosinophilic pneumonia, foreign body aspiration,
alveolar haemorrhage, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, vasculitis
or connective tissue disease, drug-induced lung disease
• Review the history, examination, and radiology
• Consider repeat imaging, e.g. CT chest
• Secondary complication
• Pulmonary, e.g. parapneumonic effusion (occurs in 36–57%, most
resolve spontaneously, thoracentesis is recommended), empyema,
abscess formation, ARDS
• Extrapulmonary, e.g. septicaemia, metastatic infection (e.g. meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis), sequelae of initial insult, e.g. renal
failure, myocardial infarction
• Inappropriate antibiotics or unexpected pathogen
• Review dose, compliance, and route of administration. Send further
microbiological specimens
• Review microbiological data, exclude less common pathogens, e.g.
Legionella, Mycoplasma, staphylococcal disease
• Pathogen may be resistant to common antibiotics; 10% of CAP will
have a mixed infection
• Consider tuberculosis, fungal infection
• Impaired immunity
• Systemic, e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia, HIV infection, myeloma
• Local, e.g. bronchiectasis, aspiration, underlying bronchial carcinoma
• Overwhelming infection

CAP: follow-up
CXR resolution Radiographic improvement lags behind clinical
improvement. There is no need to repeat a CXR before hospital discharge
in those who have made a satisfactory clinical recovery.
• In one study of CAP, complete radiographic resolution occurred after
6 weeks in 74% of patients, but only in 51% at 2 weeks
• Radiographic resolution is slower in the elderly, those with multilobe
involvement at presentation, smokers, and hospital in-patients
• Legionella and pneumococcal pneumonia are slower to resolve (may
take 12 weeks or more).
CXR follow-up is recommended around 6 weeks after CAP:
• In all patients with persisting symptoms or clinical signs
• In all patients at higher risk of underlying lung malignancy, i.e. smokers
and those over the age of 50.
This is to exclude an underlying condition that may have led to CAP,
such as lung cancer. Further investigations, such as bronchoscopy, should
be considered at this time in patients with persisting symptoms and/or a
persistently abnormal CXR.
• One study showed lung cancer is diagnosed on follow-up in 17% of
smokers aged over 60 treated for CAP in the community
• Other studies have shown a prevalence of lung cancer of 11% in
current and ex-smokers aged over 50, who are in-patients with CAP
and who undergo bronchoscopy prior to discharge.

Vaccination
Inﬂuenza vaccination This reduces hospital deaths from pneumonia and
inﬂuenza by about 65% and respiratory deaths by 45%. It also leads to
fewer hospital admissions.
Recommended for ‘high-risk’ individuals
• Chronic lung disease
• Cardiac, renal, and liver disease
• Diabetes
• Immunosuppression due to disease or treatment
• Those aged over 65
• Long-stay residential care
• Health care workers
• Contraindicated in people with hen egg hypersensitivity (the virus is
cultured in chick embryos).
The vaccination contains both A and B subtype viruses and provides
partial protection against inﬂuenza illnesses. It is modiﬁed annually, based
on recent viral strains. The protection rate from inﬂuenza by vaccination
is over 75% for inﬂuenza A and 51–97% for inﬂuenza B. Antibody levels
appear to reduce about 6 years after vaccination.

CAP: FOLLOW-UP

Pneumococcal vaccination
Recommended for:
• Asplenic individuals (including coeliac disease and sickle cell disease)
• Chronic renal, cardiac, and liver disease
• Diabetes
• Immunodeﬁciency or immunosuppression (due to disease, including
HIV infection, or drugs).
It should not be given during acute infection or in pregnancy. Re-immunization
is contraindicated within 3 years.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Hospital-acquired pneumonia:
clinical features
Deﬁnition New radiographic inﬁltrate in the presence of evidence of
infection (fever, purulent sputum, leucocytosis) with onset at least 72 h after
hospital admission. It represents around 15% of hospital-acquired infections. Most occur outside the ICU, but those at highest risk are mechanically ventilated patients. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is expensive and
prolongs the hospital stay. It requires different antibiotic treatment to
community-acquired pneumonia, and is the leading cause of death from
hospital-acquired infection. It is also known as nosocomial pneumonia.

Pathophysiology Hospital-acquired pneumonia occurs from haematogenous spread of organisms, aspiration of infected upper airway secretions,
or from the inhalation of bacteria from contaminated equipment.
Aspiration is thought to be the most important cause. Around 45%
of normal people aspirate during sleep, and this is increased in hospital
in-patients (who may be more frail) and in those with chronic disease.
These patients’ upper airways become colonized with Gram-negative bacteria (in up to 75% within 48 h of admission) and this proportion is even
higher in those who have received broad-spectrum antibiotics. In addition, the severely ill may have impaired host defences, making them more
susceptible to hospital-acquired pneumonia. Alteration in the gastric pH
with illness, and various drugs, means that the gastrointestinal tract is no
longer sterile, thereby providing a potential source of bacterial infection. A
cerebrovascular event and reduced conscious level are the major risk
factors for aspiration.
Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Age >70
Chronic lung disease and/or other comorbidity (especially diabetes)
Reduced conscious level/cerebrovascular accident
Chest/abdominal surgery
Mechanical ventilation
Nasogastric feeding
Previous antibiotic exposure
Poor dental hygiene
Steroids and cytotoxic drugs.

HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: CLINICAL FEATURES

Risk factors for speciﬁc organisms
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus inﬂuenza Increased risk in
trauma.
Staphylococcus aureus Increased risk in ventilated neurosurgical patients
(especially closed head injury), blunt trauma, and coma.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Increased risk with intubation >8 days, COPD,
prolonged antibiotics.
Acinetobacter spp. Increased risk with prolonged ventilation and previous
broad spectrum antibiotics.
Anaerobic bacteria Increased with recent abdominal surgery, aspiration.

Clinical features It presents typically with:
•
•
•
•
•

Fever
Productive cough
Raised inﬂammatory parameters
New CXR inﬁltrate
Deterioration in gas exchange.

Diagnosis is often a clinical one, and identiﬁcation of the infecting agent
can be difﬁcult, especially if the patient has already received broad spectrum
antibiotics.
Investigations
•
•
•
•
•

CXR usually shows a non-speciﬁc inﬁltrate
Blood, sputum, and pleural ﬂuid should be cultured
Arterial blood gas to determine severity
Renal and liver function tests to assess other organ dysfunction
Serological tests are of little use in nosocomial pneumonia.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Hospital-acquired pneumonia:
management
Severity assessment The CURB or CURB-65 pneumonia severity
score (see p 180) for community-acquired pneumonia has not been validated in hospital-acquired pneumonia, but may be useful in guiding the
treatment needed.

Microbiology
• About 50% are mixed infections
• 30% are due to aerobic bacteria alone (most commonly Gram-negative
bacilli and Pseudomonas)
• Anaerobes alone are found in about 25%
• Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are common causes
• Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacteroides, and Bacteroides species are
commonly isolated, as well as Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Serratia
marcescens, Klebsiella, and Proteus spp.
• Acinetobacter is a new emerging pathogen
• MRSA is increasing in prevalence
• Viruses are recognized as causes.

Management
• Patients developing pneumonia within 48 h of arrival in hospital can be
treated with standard community-acquired pneumonia antibiotics (see
p 430), as the pneumonia is likely to be due to bacteria acquired in the
community
• Patients developing pneumonia more than 48 h after hospital admission
need antibiotics to cover different organisms
• Intravenous, prolonged treatment is usually needed, with cover for
Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. This is best done by using a
second-generation cephalosporin, e.g. cefuroxime 750 mg–1.5 g tds,
with an aminoglycoside, e.g. gentamicin 7 mg/kg od (unless renal
impairment), with levels at 8–12 h, to determine dose interval
• Supportive treatment is also required, with oxygen, ﬂuids, and ventilation if necessary
• In penicillin-allergic patients clindamycin or ciproﬂoxacin can be used
(as long as Streptococcus pneumoniae is not thought to be the infecting
agent). Levoﬂoxacin has better pneumococcal cover
• Complications of nosocomial pneumonia are the same as for
community-acquired pneumonia, including lung abscess and empyema.
Drug fever, sepsis with multi-organ failure, and pulmonary embolus with
secondary infection are all more common in nosocomial pneumonia
• In this situation, chest ultrasound (to look for empyema) or
CT scanning may demonstrate abscess, underlying tumour, or infection
at extrathoracic sites.

HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: MANAGEMENT

Prognosis It has a high mortality, ranging between 20 and 50%.
Prevention Meticulous hygiene and hand washing by medical staff, in
addition to careful infection control measures have been shown to reduce
hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Post-operatively, early mobilization, careful cleaning and maintenance
of respiratory equipment, and pre-operative smoking cessation reduce
infection rates. Some intensive care units use antibiotics to selectively
decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract of Gram-negative bacilli. This has
been shown to reduce infection rates, but there is no proven effect on
mortality or length of ITU admission.

439

440

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP)
Deﬁnition Pneumonia in a mechanically ventilated patient, which
develops 48 h after intubation. It has a prevalence of up to 65% in some
units. It is an independent predictor of mortality, and is the commonest
nosocomial infection in ITU. Up to two-thirds of patients requiring
mechanical ventilation for >48 h will develop VAP. It has a mortality of
15–50%, increasing the length of ITU stay by an average of 6.1 days.
The major cause is bacterial contamination of the lower respiratory
tract from the aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, which is not prevented by cuffed endotracheal tube or tracheostomy.

Diagnosis is suggested by
• New or progressive CXR inﬁltrate
• Associated with fever, high WCC, and purulent secretions
There are many non-infectious causes of fever and CXR inﬁltrate in ITU
patients, so the diagnosis is not always straightforward.

Differential diagnosis of fever and CXR inﬁltrate in ITU
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Chemical aspiration without infection
Atelectasis
ARDS
Left ventricular failure
PE with lung infarction
Pulmonary haemorrhage
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)
Drug reaction
Tumour
Lung contusion.

Investigations
• CXR often shows a non-speciﬁc inﬁltrate, with air bronchograms being
the best predictor of the disease
• Airway sampling for microbiology
• Bronchoscopic sampling Protected specimen brush (PSB) samples
(with the tip of the bronchoscope placed opposite the oriﬁce of
an involved segmental bronchus, and the PSB advanced through
its protective sheath into the airway) or BAL samples (from a subsegmental bronchus, with the end of the bronchoscope wedged
into the airway, ideally >150 mL saline wash) are the best methods
to obtain lower airway samples with minimal contamination. VAP is
diagnosed when an arbitrary threshold of organisms
is grown on a BAL or PSB sample. The usual cut-offs are 1000
colony-forming units/mL (cfu/mL) for PSB samples, and >10,000 cfu/mL
for BAL samples. The thresholds will vary from unit to unit, and the
threshold for starting treatment will also vary. Quantitative
culture of bronchopulmonary secretions leads to reduced antibiotic
use, and is associated with improved outcomes. Airway neutrophil
counts may also aid in making the diagnosis

VENTILATOR-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (VAP)

• Non-bronchoscopic airway sampling, e.g. blind bronchial sampling of
lower respiratory tract secretions, is less sensitive and speciﬁc than
bronchoscopic sampling. It does not need an expert operator, and
is cheaper
• Serial sampling is favoured in some units. Regular non-invasive serial
airway sampling may aid early diagnosis of VAP. It needs careful
interpretation, as the microbiology of the respiratory tract changes
over time in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients
• Tracheal aspiration samples are easy to obtain, but non-speciﬁc in
diagnosing VAP, as upper airway colonization is very common
• Additional sources of fever are common in ventilated patients, including
infected lines, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, and pseudomembranous
colitis, and may warrant further investigation.

Antibiotic treatment Problems with the emergence of resistant
bacteria mean that empirical treatment with antibiotics is used less commonly. Local policies are often in place and advice should always be sought
from microbiology. The most common drug resistant pathogens are
P. aeruginosa, MRSA, Acinetobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Delay in commencing antibiotics is associated with a poorer outcome.
Risk factors for resistant organisms include:
Hospitalization in the previous 90 days
Nursing home residence
Current hospital admission >5 days
Mechanical ventilation >7 days
Prior broad-spectrum antibiotic use (e.g. third-generation cephalosporin)
• High frequency of local antibiotic resistance.
•
•
•
•
•

Antibiotics should be chosen on the basis of:
• Recent antibiotic treatment
• Local policy and known local ﬂora
• Culture data.
Antibiotics should cover anaerobes and MRSA, Legionella (if long hospital
stay), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter.
Length of treatment depends on the clinical response. Patients with
P. aeruginosa infection have been shown to have a greater risk of recurrence following discontinuation of antibiotics at 8 days. Failure to respond
should lead to a change of antibiotics, and a search for additional infection
or another cause for the radiographic inﬁltrate. Further cultures should
be sent.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Aspiration pneumonia
Deﬁnition Pneumonia that follows the aspiration of exogenous material
or endogenous secretions into the lower respiratory tract.

Epidemiology Aspiration pneumonia is the commonest cause of death
in patients with dysphagia due to neurological disorders and is the cause
of up to 20% of pneumonias in nursing home residents. It occurs in about
10% of patients admitted to hospital with a drug overdose.

Pathophysiology Micro-aspiration is common in healthy individuals,
but for an aspiration pneumonia to occur, there must be compromise
of the normal defences protecting the lower airways (i.e. glottic closure,
cough reﬂex), with inoculation of the lower respiratory tract of a signiﬁcant
amount of material. Most pneumonias are a result of aspiration of microorganisms from the oral cavity or nasopharynx.
Situations predisposing to aspiration pneumonia
• Reduced conscious level (cough reﬂex and impaired glottic closure)
• Alcohol
• Drug overdose
• Post-seizure
• Post-anaesthesia
• Massive CVA
• Dysphagia
• Motor neuron disease
• Following a neurological event; those with impaired swallow reﬂex
post-CVA are seven times more likely to develop a pneumonia than
those in whom the gag reﬂex is unimpaired
• Upper gastrointestinal tract disease
• Surgery to the stomach or oesophagus
• Mechanical impairment of glottic or cardiac sphincter closure,
e.g. tracheostomy, nasogastric feeding, bronchoscopy
• Pharyngeal anaesthesia
• Increased reﬂux
• Large volume vomiting
• Large volume nasogastric feed
• Feeding gastrostomy
• Recumbent position
• Nursing home residents
• The risk of aspiration is lower in those without teeth, who receive
aggressive oral hygiene
• There is a higher incidence of silent aspiration in the otherwise
healthy elderly
• High correlation between volume of aspirate and the risk of
developing pneumonia.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Aspiration pneumonia: clinical features
Three pulmonary syndromes result from aspiration. The amount and
nature of the aspirated material, the site and frequency of the aspiration,
and the host’s response to it will determine which pulmonary syndrome
occurs.

1. Chemical pneumonitis
This is aspiration of substances toxic to the lower airways, in the absence
of bacterial infection.
This causes a chemical burn of the tracheobronchial tree causing an
intense parenchymal inﬂammatory reaction, with release of inﬂammatory
mediators, that may lead to ARDS. Animal studies show that an inoculum
with a pH <2.5, of relatively large volume (about 25 mL in adults) is
needed to initiate an inﬂammatory reaction. Animal models show rapid
pathological changes within 3 min, with atelectasis, pulmonary haemorrhage, and pulmonary oedema. (This was ﬁrst described by Mendelson,
referring to the aspiration of sterile gastric contents and its toxic effects.
The original case series was in obstetric anaesthesia.)
Clinical features
• Rapid onset of symptoms, with breathlessness (within 1–2 h)
• Low-grade fever
• Severe hypoxaemia and diffuse lung inﬁltrates involving dependent segments
• CXR changes within 2 h.
Treatment
• If aspiration is observed—suction and/or bronchoscopy to clear
aspirated secretions or food. This may not prevent chemical injury from
acid, which is similar to a ﬂash burn
• Support of cardiac and respiratory function—with intravenous ﬂuids,
oxygen ± ventilation
• Steroids—controversial. No beneﬁt has been shown in human studies,
but there is some evidence to support their early use in ARDS
• Antibiotics—usually given, even in the absence of evidence of infection,
because secondary bacterial infection is common, and may be a
contributing or primary factor in the aspiration. Acid-damaged lung is
more susceptible to the effects of secondary bacterial infection; up to
25% will develop secondary bacterial infection. Activity against
Gram-negative and anaerobic organisms is needed, e.g. cefuroxime plus
metronidazole, or penicillin plus clindamycin.

2. Bacterial infection Aspiration of bacteria normally resident in the
upper airways or stomach. The normal bacterial ﬂora are anaerobes, in a host
susceptible to aspiration, and less virulent than the bacteria causing CAP.

ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA: CLINICAL FEATURES

Clinical features depend on the infecting organism:
• Cough, fever, purulent sputum, breathlessness
• The process may evolve over weeks and months, rather than hours
• May be more chronic, with weight loss and anaemia
• Absence of fever or rigors
• Foul smelling sputum
• Periodontal disease
• Involvement of dependent pulmonary lobes
• Anaerobic bacteria are more difﬁcult to culture, so may be present, but
not identiﬁed in microbiological culture
• May present with later manifestations, e.g. empyema, lung abscess.
Major pathogens are Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium nucleatum,
Prevotella, and Bacteroides spp. Mixed infection is common.
Treatment
• Antibiotics, to include anaerobic cover, e.g. co-amoxiclav or metronidazole plus penicillin
• Swallow assessment/neurological review if no obvious underlying cause
found.

3. Mechanical obstruction Aspiration of matter that is not directly
toxic to the lung may lead to damage by causing airway obstruction or
reﬂex airway closure. Causative agents include:
• Saline
• Barium
• Most ingested ﬂuids, including water
• Gastric contents with a pH >2.5
• Mechanical obstruction, such as occurs in drowning, or those who are
unable to clear a potential inoculum, e.g. neurological deﬁcit, impaired
cough reﬂex, reduced conscious level
• Inhalation of an object, with the severity of the obstruction depending
on the size and site of the aspirated particle. This is commoner in
children, but does occur in adults, e.g. teeth, peanuts.
Treatment
• Tracheal suction
• No further treatment is needed if no CXR inﬁltrates.

445

446

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Lung abscess: clinical features
Deﬁnition A localized area of lung suppuration leading to necrosis of
the pulmonary parenchyma, with or without cavity formation.
Lung abscesses may be single or multiple, acute or chronic (>1 month),
primary or secondary. They may occur spontaneously, but, more commonly an underlying disease exists. Lung abscess is now rare in the developed world, but has a high mortality of 20–30%. They are most common
in alcoholic men aged >50.

Pathophysiology Most are the result of aspiration pneumonia.
Predisposing factors for abscess are those for aspiration pneumonia (p 442).
• Dental disease
• Impaired consciousness—alcohol, post-anaesthesia, dysphagia
• Diabetes
• Bronchial carcinoma (with bronchial obstruction)
• Secondary to pneumonia (cavitation occurs in about 16% of
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia)
• Immunocompromise—abscesses due to Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP),
Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodococcus species, and fungi in HIV positive
patients
• Septic embolization (right heart endocarditis due to Staphylococcus
aureus in intravenous drug abusers).
The bacterial inoculum reaches the lung parenchyma, often in a dependent
lung area. Cavitation occurs when parenchymal necrosis leads to communication with the bronchus, with the entry of air and expectoration of
necrotic material, leading to the formation of an air ﬂuid level. Bronchial
obstruction leads to atelectasis with stasis and subsequent infection, which
can predispose to abscess formation.
Presentation
•
•
•
•
•
•

Often insidious onset
Productive cough, haemoptysis
Breathlessness
Fevers
Night sweats
Non-speciﬁc feature of chronic infection—anaemia, weight loss, malaise
(especially in the elderly)
• Foul sputum or purulent pleural ﬂuid.
Lemierre’s syndrome (necrobacillosis) Jugular vein suppurative thrombophlebitis. This is a rare pharyngeal infection in young adults, most commonly
due to the anaerobe Fusobacterium necrophorum. It presents with a classical history of painful pharyngitis, in the presence of bacteraemia. Infection
spreads to the neck and carotid sheath, often leading to thrombosis of
the internal jugular vein. This may not be obvious clinically (neck vein USS
or Doppler may be needed). Septic embolization to the lung with subsequent cavitation leads to abscess formation. Empyema and abscesses in
the bone, joints, liver, and kidneys can complicate.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Lung abscess: diagnosis
The diagnosis is usually made from the history along with the appearance
of a cavity with an associated air-ﬂuid level on CXR.

Investigations
• Microbiological culture, ideally before commencing antibiotics. Useful
to exclude tuberculosis
• Blood cultures
• Sputum or bronchoscopic specimen (BAL or brushings rarely
needed)
• Transthoracic percutaneous needle aspiration (CT- or ultrasoundguided) may provide samples. Risk of bleeding, pneumothorax, and
seeding of infection to pleural space, if abscess not adjacent to the
pleura
In practice, blood cultures and sputum microbiology usually sufﬁce.
Samples are usually only obtained by more invasive means if appropriate
antibiotics are not leading to an adequate clinical response.
• Imaging—exclude aspirated foreign body, underlying neoplasm, or
bronchial stenosis and obstruction
• CXR may show consolidation, cavitation, air-ﬂuid level (if the patient
is unwell, the CXR is likely to be taken in a semi-recumbent
position, so an air-ﬂuid level may not be visible). 50% of abscesses
are in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, or the apical
basal segments of either lower lobe
• CT is useful if the diagnosis is in doubt and cannot be conﬁrmed
from the CXR appearance, or if the clinical response to treatment
is inadequate. It can also help to deﬁne the exact position of the
abscess (which may be useful for physiotherapy, or if surgery is being
considered—rarely needed)
CT also is useful to differentiate an abscess from a pleural collection—a
lung abscess appears as a rounded intrapulmonary mass, with no compression of adjacent lung, with a thickened irregular wall, making an acute angle
at its contact with the chest wall. An empyema typically has a ‘lenticular’
shape and compresses adjacent lung, which creates an obtuse angle as it
follows the contour of the chest wall.
CT can determine the presence of obstructing endobronchial disease,
due to malignancy or foreign body, and may be useful in deﬁning the extent
of disease in a very sick patient who has had signiﬁcant haemoptysis. Even
with CT, differentiating an abscess from a cavitating malignancy can be very
difﬁcult (no radiological features differentiate them).

LUNG ABSCESS: DIAGNOSIS

Microbiology Commonly mixed infection, usually anaerobes.
• The most common organisms are those colonizing the oral cavity
and gingival crevices—Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Bacteroides, and
Fusobacterium spp
• Aerobes—Streptococcus milleri, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp.,
Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Nocardia
• Non-bacterial pathogens are also reported—fungi (Aspergillus,
Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces) and Mycobacteria
Opportunistic infections in immunocompromised—Nocardia, Mycobacteria, Aspergillus.

an air-ﬂuid level

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Lung abscess: management
Antibiotics to cover aerobic and anaerobic infection, including β-lactamase
inhibitors, e.g. co-amoxiclav and clindamycin. Long courses are needed. Risk
of Clostridium difﬁcile diarrhoea.
• Infections are usually mixed, therefore antibiotics to cover these
• Metronidazole to cover anaerobes
• No data to guide length of treatment. Common practice would be
1–2 weeks intravenous treatment, with a further 2–6 weeks oral
antibiotics, often until out-patient clinic review.
Drainage Spontaneous drainage is common, with the production
of purulent sputum. This can be increased with postural drainage and
physiotherapy.
• No data to support use of bronchoscopic drainage
• Percutaneous drainage with radiologically placed small percutaneous
drains for peripheral abscesses may be useful in those failing to respond
to antibiotic and supportive treatment. These are usually placed under
ultrasound guidance (though are rarely indicated).

Surgery is rarely required if appropriate antibiotic treatment is given. It is
usually reserved for complicated infections failing to respond to standard
treatment after at least 6 weeks of treatment.
May be needed if:
• Very large abscess (>6 cm diameter)
• Resistant organisms
• Haemorrhage
• Recurrent disease
• Lobectomy or pneumonectomy is occasionally needed if severe
infection with an abscess leaves a large volume of damaged lung that is
hard to sterilize.
Complications Haemorrhage (erosion of blood vessels as the
abscess extends into the lung parenchyma). This can be massive and lifethreatening (see p 43), and is an indication for urgent surgery.
If slow to respond, consider:
• Underlying malignancy
• Unusual microbiology, e.g. mycobacterium, fungi
• Immunosuppression
• Large cavity (>6 cm) may rarely require drainage
• Non-bacterial cause e.g. cavitating malignancy, Wegener’s
granulomatosis
• Other cause of persistent fever, e.g. Clostridium difﬁcile diarrhoea,
antibiotic-associated fever.

Prognosis 85% cure rate in the absence of underlying disease. Mortality
is reported as high as 75% in immunocompromised patients. The prognosis
is much worse in the presence of underlying lung disease, with increasing
age and large abscesses (>6 cm) with Staphylococcus aureus infection.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Nocardiosis
Deﬁnition Nocardia are Gram-positive, partially acid-fast, aerobic bacilli
that form branching ﬁlaments. They are found in soil, decaying organic
plant matter, and water, and have been isolated from house dust, garden
soil, and swimming pools. Infection typically follows inhalation, although
percutaneous inoculation also occurs. The Nocardia asteroides species
complex accounts for the majority of clinical infections.
Consider Nocardia infection when soft tissue abscesses and/or CNS
manifestations occur in the setting of a pulmonary infection. The combination of respiratory, skin, and/or CNS involvement may lead to a
misdiagnosis of vasculitis, and the respiratory manifestations may mimic
cancer, tuberculosis, or fungal disease.

Epidemiology Nocardia occurs worldwide and the frequency of subclinical exposure is unknown. Clinically apparent infection is rare, and usually
occurs in patients with immunocompromise (haematological malignancy,
steroid therapy, organ transplant, diabetes, alcoholism, and HIV infection,
especially IV drug users) or pre-existing lung disease (particularly pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, tuberculosis). Infection also occurs in apparently
healthy people (10–25% of cases). Nosocomial infection and disease outbreaks have been reported.

Clinical features
Pulmonary disease
• The lung is the most common site of involvement
• Patients typically present with productive cough, fever, anorexia, weight
loss, and malaise; dyspnoea, pleuritic pain, and haemoptysis may occur,
but are less common
• Empyema occurs in up to a quarter of cases, and direct intrathoracic
spread causing pericarditis, mediastinitis, rib osteomyelitis, or SVCO is
also reported
Extrapulmonary disease
• Dissemination from the lungs occurs in 50% of patients
• Central nervous system is the most common site of dissemination,
occurring in 25% of pulmonary nocardiosis cases. Single or multiple
abscesses occur, and may be accompanied by meningitis
• Other sites include the skin and subcutaneous tissues, kidneys, bone,
joints and muscle, peritoneum, eyes, pericardium, and heart valves.

Investigations
• Identiﬁcation by smear and culture is the principal method of diagnosis.
Nocardia grow on routine media usually within 2–7 days, although more
prolonged culture (2–3 weeks) may be required
• Direct smear of appropriate specimens (e.g. aspirates of abscesses,
biopsies) is highly sensitive and typically shows Gram-positive beaded
branching ﬁlaments, which are usually acid-fast on modiﬁed ZN stain.
Examination of BAL ﬂuid may also be diagnostic

NOCARDIOSIS

• Sensitivity testing of isolates and identiﬁcation to species level is done
by reference laboratories
• Biopsies typically show a mixed cellular inﬁltrate; granulomata occur
rarely, and may result in misdiagnosis as tuberculosis or histoplasmosis
• CXR and CT may demonstrate parenchymal inﬁltrates, single or
multiple nodules (sometimes with cavitation), or features of pleural
infection
• Sputum smear is usually unhelpful. Sputum culture has a greater yield,
but Nocardia growth may be obscured in mixed cultures. The signiﬁcance of Nocardia growth on sputum culture in asymptomatic patients
is unclear; it may represent contamination or colonization in the setting
of underlying lung disease
• Blood cultures are almost always negative, although Nocardia bacteraemia may occur in the setting of profound immunocompromise
• Consider MRI of the brain to exclude asymptomatic CNS involvement
in patients with pulmonary nocardiosis.

Management
• Discuss treatment with an infectious diseases specialist
• Drug treatment choices include sulphonamides/co-trimoxazole, minocycline, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or amikacin. Sulpha drugs,
in particular co-trimoxazole, have traditionally been the mainstay of
therapy. Imipenem and amikacin combination therapy has been shown
to be active in vitro and in animal models, and is recommended for
pulmonary nocardiosis and for very ill patients. Extended spectrum
cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have the advantages
of good CNS penetration and low toxicity
• Optimal treatment duration is unclear: typically given for 6 months in
non-immunocompromised patients, and for 12 months or longer for
CNS involvement or immunocompromised patients
• Surgery may be required for abscess drainage.

Prognosis Clinical outcome is dependent on the site and extent of
disease and on underlying host factors. Disease remissions and exacerbations are common. Cure rates are approximately 90% in pleuropulmonary
disease, and 50% in brain abscess. Mortality of Nocardia infection is generally low, although it approaches 50% in cases of bacteraemia.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Actinomycosis
Deﬁnition Actinomycosis is caused by a group of anaerobic Grampositive bacilli, of which Actinomyces israelii is the commonest. These
organisms are present in the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina.
Clinical infection may follow dental procedures or aspiration of infected
secretions. Infection is slowly progressive and may disseminate via the
bloodstream or invade tissue locally, sometimes resulting in sinus tract
formation.
Consider this diagnosis particularly in patients with pulmonary disease
accompanied by soft tissue infection of the head and neck. The diagnosis
of actinomycosis is often unsuspected, and the clinical and radiological
features may mimic cancer, tuberculosis, or fungal disease.

Epidemiology Actinomycosis is rare. It can occur at any age, and is
more common in men. Predisposing factors include corticosteroid use,
chemotherapy, organ transplant, and HIV infection.

Clinical features
Thoracic disease Thoracic disease occurs in about 15% of cases. Symptoms
of pulmonary involvement are non-speciﬁc, and include cough, chest pain,
haemoptysis, fever, anorexia, and weight loss. Chest wall involvement may
occur, with sinus formation or rib infection, and empyema is common.
Mediastinal involvement is documented.
Extrathoracic disease Soft tissue infection of the head and neck, particularly the mandible, is the commonest disease presentation (about 50% of
cases). Discharging sinuses may form. Other extrathoracic disease sites
include the abdomen (particularly the ileocaecal region), pelvis, liver, bone,
and CNS (manifest as single or multiple abscesses).

Investigations
• CXR and CT appearances are variable, including masses (sometimes
with cavitation), parenchymal inﬁltrates, consolidation, mediastinal
disease, and/or pleural involvement
• Diagnosis is based on the microscopy and anaerobic culture of
infected material. Warn the microbiology laboratory if the diagnosis
is suspected, as speciﬁc stains and culture conditions are required.
Examination of infected material may reveal yellow ‘sulphur granules’
containing aggregated organisms. Sample sputum, pleural ﬂuid, and pus
from sinus tracts; inoculate into anaerobic transport media, and rapidly
transport to lab. Endobronchial biopsies have a low sensitivity. Most
infections are polymicrobial, with accompanying aerobic or anaerobic
bacteria.

ACTINOMYCOSIS

Management
• Discuss treatment with an infectious diseases specialist
• Drug treatment choices include penicillin, amoxicillin, clindamycin, or
erythromycin. Administration should initially be intravenous. Optimal
treatment duration is unclear (typically given for 6–12 months)
• Surgery may be required for abscess drainage
• Monitor response to treatment with serial CT or MRI scans
• Treat any associated periodontal disease.

Prognosis Disease relapse is common if prolonged treatment is not
administered.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Anthrax
Deﬁnition and epidemiology
• Bacillus anthracis is an aerobic Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium
that causes human disease, principally following either inhalation or
cutaneous contact. Spores can survive in soil for many years. Personto-person transmission does not occur
• Considerable recent interest has focused on the use of anthrax in
bioterrorism: ﬁve envelopes containing anthrax spores were sent
through the US postal service in 2001 and there were 11 conﬁrmed
cases of inhalational anthrax (including 5 deaths) and 7 conﬁrmed cases
of cutaneous anthrax. A previous outbreak occurred in Sverdlovsk in
the former Soviet Union in 1979, following the release of spores from a
biological weapons plant, and resulted in 68 deaths
• Anthrax infection also occurs very rarely in association with
occupational exposure to Bacillus anthracis in animal wool or hides.
The majority of occupational cases result in cutaneous disease, and a
diagnosis of inhalational anthrax strongly suggests a bioterrorist attack.

Clinical features
Inhalational anthrax
• Incubation period is variable, although in the USA in 2001 it typically
ranged 4–6 days following exposure from opening mail
• Patients typically experience a prodrome of ﬂu-like symptoms such
as fever and cough. Gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhoea,
abdominal pain), drenching sweats, and altered mental status are often
prominent symptoms. Breathlessness, fever, and septic shock develop
several days later. Haemorrhagic meningitis is a common complication
• Large haemorrhagic pleural effusions are a characteristic feature.
Cutaneous anthrax
• Initial symptoms include itch and development of a papule at the infection site. A necrotic ulcer with a black centre and often surrounding
oedema subsequently develops. Systemic symptoms such as fever and
sweats may be present.

Investigations
• Bacillus anthracis grows on conventional media, and is readily cultured
if sampling precedes antibiotic treatment; a deﬁnitive diagnosis requires
specialized laboratory tests, however
• Blood tests typically reveal leucocytosis
• Blood cultures are positive in nearly all cases of inhalational anthrax
when taken prior to antibiotic treatment. Staining and culture of pleural
ﬂuid may be diagnostic
• CXR in inhalational anthrax classically shows a widened mediastinum;
pleural effusions and pulmonary inﬁltrates may be present. CT may also
demonstrate mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy
• Gram stain and culture of the ulcer is usually diagnostic in cutaneous
anthrax, although biopsy is sometimes required.

ANTHRAX

Management
• Discuss with infectious diseases and public health specialists if the
diagnosis is suspected
• Antibiotic treatment should be administered immediately after taking
blood cultures. Recent recommendations are for initial treatment
with either ciproﬂoxacin or doxycycline IV, in combination with
1–2 additional antibiotics (choices include clindamycin, vancomycin,
meropenem, or penicillin). Subsequent treatment should be with either
ciproﬂoxacin or doxycycline orally for 60–100 days. Oral treatment
alone may be sufﬁcient in cases of mild cutaneous disease
• Corticosteroid treatment should be considered in patients with meningitis, or severe neck or mediastinal oedema
• Supportive care, including ventilatory support, treatment of shock with
intravenous ﬂuids and/or inotropes, and chest tube drainage of large
pleural effusions may be needed.

Prognosis Inhalational anthrax is associated with a high mortality: 5 of
the recent 11 cases in the USA died. The mortality of previously documented cases has been even higher, perhaps reﬂecting a delay or lack of
antibiotic treatment.
Prophylaxis Recent USA recommendations advise prophylaxis with
oral ciproﬂoxacin or doxycycline for individuals considered to have been
exposed to anthrax spores in contaminated areas. A vaccine is available,
although its value in post-exposure prophylaxis is unknown.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Tularaemia
Deﬁnition and epidemiology Tularaemia is a rare zoonosis caused
by infection with the Gram negative bacteria Francisella tularensis. Two
major subspecies are described: biovar tularensis (type A) is highly virulent
and found in North America; biovar palaeartica (type B) is less virulent,
and found in Europe and Asia. Small mammals (particularly rabbits and
hares) acquire infection from arthropod bites and act as reservoirs; human
infection follows inhalation, direct contact with infected rodents, ingestion
of contaminated food, or arthropod bites. Tularaemia is most frequently
encountered in rural areas, following activities such as farming and hunting,
although laboratory workers are also at risk. There has been considerable
interest in the development of F. tularensis as a biological weapon, and
more recently concerns have arisen as to its possible use in bioterrorism.
Clinical features Typically abrupt onset of fever, headache, dry cough
and malaise. Development of a tender ulcer and regional lymphadenopathy (‘ulceroglandular tularaemia’) around an infected arthropod bite is
common. Tularaemia pneumonia following infection with type A is characterized by cough (productive or dry), breathlessness, and sweating, with
often minimal signs on examination; may progress rapidly to respiratory
failure and death. Symptoms of pneumonia are milder after infection with
type B.
Investigations
• Serology is the principal method of diagnosis, although PCR-based
techniques are increasingly used
• F. tularensis may be identiﬁed in culture of wound specimens, although
the laboratory should be warned—type A is sufﬁciently virulent for
some laboratories not to perform culture. Sputum cultures may be
diagnostic
• CXR may demonstrate parenchymal inﬁltrates, often progressing to
lobar consolidation. Pleural effusions, hilar lymphadenopathy, and lung
abscess may occur.

Management
• Discuss treatment with an infectious diseases specialist
• Drug treatment choices include streptomycin or gentamicin for
10 days. Doxycycline or chloramphenicol are alternatives, although
treatment failure rates are higher and a course of 14 days is
recommended
• In the setting of a large-scale outbreak (e.g. following use in
bioterrorism), doxycycline or ciproﬂoxacin may be used for treatment
or following exposure.

Prognosis Mortality is 1–2% from type A; type B is benign in humans.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Melioidosis
Deﬁnition and epidemiology Melioidosis is caused by Burkholderia
pseudomallei, a Gram-negative bacillus that is found in soil and water in
Southeast Asia, northern Australia, China, and India; clinical disease is particularly common in Thailand, where it may account for up to a third of all
pneumonia deaths. Infection is thought to follow entry via skin abrasions
or inhalation, and pneumonia is the most common clinical presentation.
Most cases represent recent infection; reactivation of infection is rare but
can occur many years after exposure. Risk factors for melioidosis include
diabetes, alcohol excess, renal disease, and chronic lung disease (including
cystic ﬁbrosis).
Consider melioidosis in returning travellers from Asia or Australia with
community-acquired pneumonia or a subacute/chronic ‘tuberculosislike’ respiratory illness.

Clinical features include:
• Acute septicaemic melioidosis Patients present acutely unwell with a
severe pneumonia and widespread nodular consolidation on CXR, may
progress rapidly to death
• Localized subacute melioidosis Subacute cavitating lobar (often upper)
pneumonia, mimicking tuberculosis
• Chronic suppurative melioidosis Chronic lung abscess ± empyema;
suppurative infection may involve other organs, including skin, brain,
joints, bones, liver, spleen, kidney, adrenal, prostate, lymph nodes

Diagnosis
Identiﬁcation by culture is the principal method of diagnosis. Blood cultures may be diagnostic; alert the laboratory to the possibility of this infection. ELISAs are relatively insensitive.

Management
• B. pseudomallei is resistant to multiple antibiotics. Treat with high-dose
IV ceftazidime or meropenem for at least 10–14 days (longer if severe
pulmonary disease or organ abscesses), then oral antibiotic (e.g.
co-trimoxazole alone or in combination with doxycycline) for at least
12 weeks to ensure eradication.
• Supportive care, with ITU admission for septic shock or severe pneumonia.

Prognosis Documented mortality rates range 19–46%.

CHAPTER 40

Respiratory infection: bacterial

Leptospirosis
Deﬁnition and epidemiology Leptospirosis is a zoonosis transmitted from water or soil contaminated with urine of infected animals
(e.g. rats, dogs, cats, pigs, cattle, hamsters, bats) through skin abrasions or
mucosa. Present worldwide, more common in tropical countries, but well
described in UK. Individuals most at risk in the UK include farmers, vets,
sewage workers, returning travellers from the topics, military personnel,
and canoeists. Incidence peaks in spring/summer. In the tropics, epidemics
may occur following storms or ﬂoods.
Consider leptospirosis in all patients with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage,
and in at-risk individuals with pneumonia or ARDS.

Clinical features Disease manifestations are highly variable, ranging
from asymptomatic infection to multi-organ failure, pulmonary haemorrhage, and death. Patients may present solely with pulmonary haemorrhage, without other features of Weil’s disease. Manifestations include:
• Acute (anicteric) leptospirosis Self-limiting ﬂu-like illness; myalgia, rash
and aseptic meningitis may occur
• Weil’s disease (icterohaemorrhagic fever) Classic form of leptospirosis.
Features include fever, myalgia, conjunctival haemorrhage, rash, jaundice/
hepatic failure, renal failure, coagulopathy and thrombocytopaenia,
shock, myocarditis/cardiac arrthymias
• Pulmonary disease Occurs in at least a third of hospitalized patients
with acute leptospirosis or Weil’s disease. Manifestations include mild
symptoms/signs (cough, wheeze, and crackles), pneumonia, pulmonary
oedema secondary to myocarditis, and ARDS or fulminant alveolar
haemorrhage syndrome.

Investigations
• Serology conﬁrms the diagnosis and is performed in a single Leptospira
Reference Unit in the UK. Both ELISA and microscopic agglutination
tests may be performed
• CXR and CT typically demonstrate patchy consolidation and groundglass shadowing, commonly bilateral with lower lobe predominance.

Management
• Discuss treatment with infectious diseases and renal specialists.
Antibiotic choices include penicillin, ceftriaxone, or doxycycline
• Ventilatory support required for alveolar haemorrhage and ARDS
• Ensure adequate hydration; blood products may be required
• High-dose glucocorticoids are occasionally used, although there is no
convincing evidence of beneﬁt. Plasma exchange and desmopressin
infusions have been tried.

LEPTOSPIROSIS

Prognosis Acute leptospirosis typically resolves spontaneously after
about 14 days. Severe pulmonary disease can progress very rapidly (over
hours), with reported mortality rates approaching 50%.

CHAPTER 41

Respiratory infection: fungal

Aspergillus lung disease: classiﬁcation
Types of disease Aspergillus fumigatus and other Aspergillus moulds are
ubiquitous fungi that can be isolated from the air in most houses, and this
increases with increasing indoor humidity. Inhalation of spores (conidia)
can produce a range of diseases, some of which are related to each other,
and some of which are not. The ﬁnding of fungal hyphae (rather than just
spores) in the sputum should provoke an assessment.

Classiﬁcation
1. IgE-mediated allergic asthma from inhaled Aspergillus spores.
One of many common antigens provoking airway inﬂammation and
bronchospasm
2. Exuberant IgE and IgG reaction to Aspergillus in the airways of (usually)
asthmatics provoking mucous plugging with distal consolidation that
may ﬂit from area to area. This is one of the causes of pulmonary eosinophilia
3. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (APBA) A probable evolution and progression of (2) in (usually) asthmatics with inﬂammatory
damage to the airways and resultant bronchiectasis (but no actual
invasion of Aspergillus into the airway walls)
4. Invasive Aspergillus pneumonia due to invasion of Aspergillus into lung
tissue secondary to immunosuppression. This can be a multisystem disorder with Aspergillus invading almost any part of the body
5. Semi-invasive aspergillosis, a much lower grade process than
invasive aspergillus pneumonia, usually seen in older individuals with no
apparent immunosuppression, but usually some underlying chronic lung
disease
6. Aspergilloma, where Aspergillus lives and grows as a separate ball of
fungus in a pre-existing lung cavity. There is usually an inﬂammatory
response to limited hyphae invasion into the tissue walls of the cavity
7. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (or extrinsic allergic alveolitis) due to an
immune inﬂammatory reaction to inhalation of large numbers of spores
(see p 249).
The presentation and clinical setting of these various Aspergillus-related
disorders are clearly different and thus are detailed separately.

ASTHMA AND POSITIVE IgG PRECIPITINS TO ASPERGILLUS

Atopic allergy to fungal spores
Approximately 10% of asthmatics are skin prick positive to Aspergillus
species, compared with about 70% to house dust mite. It is assumed that
this allergy contributes to allergic inﬂammation in the airways but, in the
few relevant studies, symptoms have not always correlated with exposure.
However, in some studies asthma admissions to hospital correlated better
with fungal spore counts than with pollen counts. Fungal spore release
may explain an association between thunderstorms and asthma attacks.
Particularly high exposure results from working with mouldy vegetable
matter, e.g. in compost heaps during late summer/early autumn.

Asthma and positive IgG precipitins to
Aspergillus
Deﬁnition Asthmatics with IgE responses to Aspergillus can also develop
IgG antibodies (precipitins). Why this happens is not clear. Aspergillus
hyphae can sometimes be isolated from the sputum and it has been suggested that Aspergillus spores are able to germinate and grow in the
mucous within the airways. This may explain the mucous plugging and ﬂitting areas of pulmonary consolidation.

Clinical features and investigations
Associated features may include:
• Serum IgE >1000 ng/mL
• Blood eosinophilia >500/mm3
• Skin prick +ve to Aspergillus
• IgG precipitins to Aspergillus (many different allergenic proteins)
• Long history of asthma, perhaps recently deteriorated.
Therefore suspect this development in:
A patient with long-term asthma whose control deteriorates, with CXR
changes, lgE & lgG to Aspergillus, eosinophilia, and perhaps hyphae in the
sputum.

Management may only require an increase in inhaled steroids. However,
there is a suggestion that courses of oral steroids are particularly effective and may prevent progression to bronchiectasis (see next section).
Steroids limit the host’s immunological response but do not seem to
lead to Aspergillus invasion of the tissues. Poorly documented evidence of
improvement with antifungal agents such as itraconazole.

467

468

CHAPTER 41

Respiratory infection: fungal

Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
Deﬁnition This condition is probably an extension of (2), where the
inﬂammatory response to the Aspergillus in the airways provokes a
more exuberant response, with damage to the bronchial walls and bronchiectasis. Some authors reserve the use of the term ABPA for when
bronchiectasis is present; others may include (2), and subdivide into ABPA-S
(seropositive only), and ABPA-CB (central bronchiectasis).
The prevalence of ABPA in asthmatic populations has varied considerably
between studies, and clearly will depend on whether the deﬁnition includes
bronchiectasis or not. It probably occurs in about 1–2% of asthmatics.
A related condition occurs in patients with cystic ﬁbrosis where it appears
about 7% have evidence of colonization and potential ongoing damage.

Pathophysiology The factors promoting the evolution from atopic
asthmatic to ABPA are not known. A particular HLA association has
been shown, with the suggestion that a CD4/Th2 response to a particular
Aspergillus antigen (Asp f1 antigen) with release of IL-4 and IL-5 may be
critical. Proteolytic enzymes are released by Aspergillus as part of its exophytic feeding strategy and these enzymes may damage airway mucosa.
However, most believe that the damage results from host defence mechanisms. Hyphae (rather than just spores) may be visible in the mucus and
grown from sputum, but there does not appear to be actual invasion
of the bronchial mucosa. This immune inﬂammatory activity produces
mucoid impaction in the airways, eosinophilic pneumonitis, and bronchocentric granuloma formation.
Main criteria for diagnosis (the ﬁrst four are the most important)
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Long history of asthma
Skin prick/IgE +ve to Aspergillus fumigatus
IgG precipitins to Aspergillus fumigatus
Central (proximal) bronchiectasis
Blood/sputum eosinophilia
Total serum IgE >1000 mg/mL
Lung inﬁltrates—ﬂitting.

Other clinical features
•
•
•
•
•
•

Long-standing asthma, recent deterioration
Recurrent episodes of mucous plugging
Fever/malaise
Expectoration of dark mucous plugs, sometimes as casts of the airways
Eosinophilia (sputum and blood)
Occasional haemoptysis.

The major complication is poorly controlled asthma that requires repeated
courses of oral steroids.

BRONCHOPULMONARY ASPERGILLOSIS

Investigations
Spirometry—degree of airways obstruction
Skin prick sensitivity to Aspergillus (IgE)
Sputum—Aspergillus hyphae and eosinophils
Blood
• IgG precipitins
• IgE RAST to Aspergillus
• Total serum IgE
• Eosinophil count (suppressed if on steroids)
• CXR
• Flitting inﬁltrates
• Bronchiectasis, mucous impaction (gloved ﬁnger shadows)
• CT Central (proximal) bronchiectasis with upper lobe predominance
•
•
•
•

Management The management is essentially that of severe chronic
asthma, but with generous use of courses of oral steroids. Several randomized controlled trials have shown courses of itraconazole (200 mg bd for
4 months) are well tolerated, reduce steroid requirements, and improve
exercise tolerance. There appears to be a sustained effect after the itraconazole is stopped, suggesting at least temporary eradication of the Aspergillus.
Response and relapse can be monitored with IgG precipitins to Aspergillus.
Itraconazole can cause liver dysfunction, so LFTs need monitoring.
Differential diagnosis This list revolves mainly around the pulmonary
inﬁltrates and eosinophilia.
• Acute/chronic eosinophilic pneumonia
• Churg–Strauss syndrome
• Various parasites (e.g. ﬁlariasis, ascaris; Löfﬂer’s syndrome)
• Drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia.

CHAPTER 41

Respiratory infection: fungal

Invasive aspergillosis
Deﬁnition The term ‘invasive aspergillosis’ is reserved for the situation
where Aspergillus hyphae actually invade tissue (hyalohyphomycosis). This
usually occurs with severe immune suppression, particularly neutropenia
and steroid use. The port of entry is probably the lungs, but spread can
be to almost any area of the body. The species most commonly seen
are Aspergillus fumigatus, ﬂavus, terreus, and niger. Mortality is very high.
The source of Aspergillus is unclear, but has been found in hospital water
supplies.

Pathogenesis Alveolar macrophages probably normally destroy
Aspergillus spores. Macrophage failure may allow more spores to germinate and any subsequent invasion with hyphae seems to be prevented by
neutrophils. Inadequate neutrophil function allows invasion across tissue
planes and into vessels, with infarction and further spread throughout
the body. There is some evidence that CMV may inactivate macrophages,
allowing spores to germinate. The fungal digestive proteases do the
damage rather than the host’s limited immunological responses.
Clinical features
Typical setting
Fever, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, and pulmonary inﬁltrate in
a neutropenic patient failing to respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Risk factors
• Following chemotherapy, particularly provoking severe neutropenia
(<100 cells/µl)
• Bone marrow suppression for allogeneic stem cell transplants
• Advanced HIV infection and AIDS
• Immune suppression following transplant
• Inﬂiximab (or other anti-TNFα) therapy
Spread can occur anywhere with the following well recognized:
• Sinuses (paranasal) and spread into the brain
• Endocarditis
• Eyes
• Skin (papular, ranging to ulcerative, lesions).
Careful examination and particular investigations may be needed to detect
spread to these areas.

INVASIVE ASPERGILLOSIS

Investigations
• Isolate Aspergillus hyphae from respiratory tract by:
• Sputum
• Expressed sputum (3% saline via nebulizer)
• Bronchoalveolar lavage
• Transbronchial biopsy
(Hyphae may be present when not the primary cause of the inﬁltrate)
• Biopsies from other sites (most convincing when acute-angle branching,
septated non-pigmented hyphae are seen)
• Circulating levels of galactomannan, an exo-antigen of Aspergillus
(commercial EIA kit not universally available, and not found so useful by
all groups on account of low sensitivity and false positivity due to
presence of certain antibiotics, piperacillin and tazobactam). Serial sampling is recommended
• CXR/CT CXR changes are usually non-speciﬁc. CT may show a halo of
low attenuation surrounding a nodular lesion early on. An ‘air crescent’
sign may develop on CXR with air appearing at the edge of an area of
consolidation. Usually occurs when neutrophil count rising, and probably represents gradual containment of the infection into a cavity, not
unlike an aspergilloma
Ultimately, it is the clinical picture that dominates the diagnosis.

Management Prompt use of antifungals is essential.
• Intravenous amphotericin B (only about 35% response rate)
• Intravenous lipid-based amphotericin (less nephrotoxic, but very
expensive)
• Itraconazole IV: 200 mg bd for 2 days, then 200 mg od for 12 days
• Voriconazole (recently available, less experience, but probably better
than itraconazole, and safer than amphotericin, very expensive)
• Caspofungin (recently available, less experience, very expensive)
Some centres use oral itraconazole as prophylaxis when commencing
substantial immune suppression.

Differential diagnosis
The differential will be the large number of other opportunistic infections
seen in immunosuppressed patients. Another invasive mycosis, Candida
albicans, is now less common due to its susceptibility to ﬂuconazole.

CHAPTER 41

Respiratory infection: fungal

Semi-invasive aspergillosis
(also known as chronic necrotizing aspergillosis, or chronic pulmonary
aspergillosis)

Deﬁnition This entity is poorly deﬁned but it is clear that a low-grade
chronic invasion of Aspergillus into airway walls and surrounding lung can
occur. In the original descriptions, some cause of mild immuno-incompetence was present, such as diabetes, steroid therapy, chronic lung disease,
poor nutrition, etc. Previous asthma is not usually present, unlike ABPA.

Pathogenesis It is assumed that this form of aspergillosis results from
lowered immunity in those without a tendency to make Th2, eosinophilic,
responses to antigens. There is inﬁltration of hyphae into lung tissue,
ranging from minor patchy consolidation to multiple cavities. There is
little, if any, angio-invasion. It is assumed that the fungal digestive proteases
gradually do the damage, rather than the host’s immunological response.
Clinical features

•

Middle-aged
Reason for mild immunosuppression
A pre-existing chronic lung disease
Fever
Productive cough
Patchy indolent CXR changes.

Investigations
• Sputum samples may allow isolation of hyphae
• CT will show an airway-centred type of picture with ‘tree in bud’
appearance. With increasing severity this gives way to denser areas and
small cavities that occasionally may contain a fungus ball
• Likely to have IgG precipitins to Aspergillus, but not always.

Management On the assumption that mild immune suppression is the
dominant cause, steroids are not usually recommended for fear of further
immune suppression. This is in contrast to ABPA where the damage is due
to the host’s immune defence mechanisms. Oral antifungals, such as itraconazole, are recommended. Fluconazole has been used with apparent
success in case series only.

CHAPTER 41

Respiratory infection: fungal

Aspergilloma/mycetoma
Deﬁnition The term aspergilloma is used to describe a ball of fungal
hyphae within a cavity in the lung. It is assumed that this is colonization
of a prior cavity, rather than arrested invasion. Aspergillomas can occur in
other organs, including the pleural space.

Pathogenesis Cavities can occur in the lung following a variety of insults
such as tuberculosis, sarcoid, ordinary pneumonia/lung abscess, treated
tumours, and cystic ﬁbrosis. Fungal spores entering the cavity germinate and survive in a relatively protected environment. The ball consists
of hyphae, inﬂammatory cells, ﬁbrin, and debris. Around the cavity is an
intense inﬂammatory response, often with considerable extra vascularization from bronchial arteries and occasional fungal hyphae.
Clinical features Aspergillomas are often asymptomatic. Up to 75%
will present with haemoptysis, assumed to come from damaged vessels on
the inner surface of the cavity wall, via a communication with a bronchus.
Sometimes there are systemic symptoms, malaise, and fever, as well as
chest pain. Superadded infection may provoke exacerbations.
Investigations
• CXR apical cavity with ball within that changes position if CXR is
performed decubitus
• CT obvious cavity with fungus ball, and possible invasion into
surrounding lung (uncommon)
• Sputum culture
• Aspergillus IgG precipitins. Often higher levels than seen in other
Aspergillus diseases.

Management
• May not require treatment
• Systemic symptoms of fever and malaise may be hard to ascribe to a
mycetoma and require a therapeutic trial of itraconazole
• The most signiﬁcant complication is life-threatening haemoptysis.
The emergency management of haemoptysis is described on p 43
• Itraconazole will not eradicate the fungus, but seems to reduce cavity
size and lessen the tendency to haemoptysis. It is assumed that it kills
any fungus in the walls and inhibits growth in the cavity. The place of
newer agents such as voriconazole is not known.

ASPERGILLOMA/MYCETOMA

General approach to chronic haemoptysis
• Tranexamic acid (must be taken during clot formation as binds to
ﬁbrin to prevent action of endogenous ﬁbrinolytics)
• Treat associated bacterial infections.

Speciﬁc to aspergilloma
• Itraconazole
• Arterial embolization
• Surgical resection.
• Bronchial arteriograms should reveal a leash of vessels supplying part
of the cavity wall that can be embolized, even if not actively bleeding.
Short-term success rate is good; long-term, less good
• Surgery can be difﬁcult, as mycetomas may be stuck to the chest wall.
Problems of seeding the pleural space are seen less often than in the
past, probably due to better antifungal agents
• A few case reports exist of successful reduction of haemoptysis with
radiotherapy
• Older approaches involving intracavity injections of amphotericin are
rarely used now, although a recent case series of 40 patients seemed
promising.

Overview of Aspergillus lung disease
The essential differences between the Aspergillus lung diseases depends on
whether the damage to the lung is mediated by host defence mechanisms
(atopic asthma, ﬂitting consolidation, ABPA, possibly aspergilloma) or by
the fungus’s own digestive proteolytic enzymes (invasive aspergillosis,
semi-invasive, aspergilloma). These two disease states are clearly different,
but there probably exists a continuum between each of the subdivisions
within each group, and the dominant mechanism in aspergilloma is not
entirely clear. Therefore it is likely that patients with mixed and transitional
features will be encountered.

Future developments
• New antifungals—voriconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole (the triazoles), caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin (the echinocandins)
• Combination therapy
• Antifungal action of older drugs—ﬂucytosine, rifampicin, ﬂuconazole
• Place of early surgery
• Place of prophylaxis
• Value of galactomannan and β-D-glycan blood levels in diagnosis.

CHAPTER 41

Respiratory infection: fungal

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP):
diagnosis
Deﬁnition Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is the clinical syndrome of
pneumonia resulting from infection with the fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci
(previously termed Pneumocystis carinii). Pneumocystis jiroveci is widespread in the environment and most people are infected by the age of
2 years; PCP is thought, however, to follow new infection rather than
reactivation of latent infection. Most cases of infection are likely to be
person-to-person airborne transmission rather than environmental.

Causes Risk factors for PCP include HIV infection (particularly with CD4
count <200 x 106/L), treatment with chemotherapy (especially ﬂudarabine), corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents, and malnutrition in children. Neutropenia does not appear to be a particular risk factor.
PCP occurring in the setting of AIDS is associated with both a greater
number of organisms and fewer inﬂammatory cells in the lungs when compared with infection associated with other causes of immunocompromise.
PCP is much less common following the routine use of co-trimoxazole
prophylaxis in HIV and post-transplantation, although cases still occur,
e.g. in patients presenting with advanced HIV or in those non-compliant
with prophylaxis. The threshold steroid dose for predisposition to PCP
is unclear, although a dose equivalent to 16 mg prednisolone or greater
for 8 weeks appears to signiﬁcantly increase risk; the risk is likely also to
reﬂect the underlying condition, e.g. PCP may develop in patients with
haematological malignancy taking as little as 5 mg prednisolone daily. PCP
often appears to present as immunosuppressant drug doses are tapered
or increased.
Clinical features Gradual onset of dry cough and exertional breathlessness, sometimes with retrosternal tightness. Fever and tachypnoea may
occur; chest examination is typically normal. May present with pneumothorax. Extrapulmonary disease is very rare.
Investigations
• CXR pattern is classically of bilateral perihilar inﬁltrates that progress
to alveolar shadowing. Less common patterns include small nodular
inﬁltrates or focal consolidation. CXR is normal in about 10%. Pleural
effusions are very rare. CT is not routinely required except in cases
of a normal CXR, when it may demonstrate a bilateral ground-glass
pattern or cystic lesions
• Hypoxia is common. Desaturation on exercise may suggest the diagnosis in at-risk individuals with normal saturations at rest
• White blood count is usually normal. Serum lactate dehydrogenase is
typically raised (sensitive, but non-speciﬁc)
• Induced sputum (see p 769) has a diagnostic yield of about 60% in HIV
infection, but is much less sensitive when performed in the setting of
non-HIV immunocompromise, where the organism burden is lower. It
should not be performed on the open ward or out-patient
department

DIAGNOSIS PCP

• Bronchoscopy with BAL is the diagnostic investigation of choice in
non-HIV-infected patients and in patients with HIV in whom induced
sputum analysis is non-diagnostic. BAL with silver or immunoﬂuorescent
staining has a speciﬁcity of nearly 100% and sensitivity of 80–90%. This
sensitivity is lower in non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patients,
reﬂecting their lower pathogen loads
• Transbronchial lung biopsy has a slightly higher sensitivity (around 95%),
but is associated with an increased risk of complications, so is reserved
for cases where BAL is non-diagnostic. Surgical lung biopsy may be
required for diagnosis in a minority of HIV-negative patients.

477

478

CHAPTER 41

Respiratory infection: fungal

PCP: treatment
Antimicrobial
• Liaise with infectious diseases or HIV specialist
• High-dose co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole)
remains the drug of choice. Administer 120 mg/kg daily in 4 divided
doses PO or IV (dilute 480 mg ampoules in at least 75 mL 5% dextrose;
infuse over 60 min). Use IV route initially and then PO during clinical
improvement; PO may be used initially in mild cases. Side-effects (e.g.
rash, nausea, vomiting, blood disorders) are common, particularly in
HIV-infected patients. Consider routine use of anti-emetics
• Second-line choices if intolerant or unresponsive to co-trimoxazole
include intravenous pentamidine, clindamycin and primaquine, dapsone
and trimethoprim, atovaquone, trimetrexate
• All treatments should be for 2–3 weeks
• If PCP is strongly suspected and the patient is unwell, treatment can
be started immediately, as BAL pneumocystis stains remain positive for
up to 2 weeks. Empirical treatment is also required in the occasional
situation where the diagnosis is suspected but bronchoscopy is nondiagnostic or not tolerated
• In cases of HIV presenting with PCP, subsequent early introduction
of HAART may rarely be associated with acute respiratory failure,
perhaps due to an aggressive inﬂammatory response to residual
pneumocystis; consider steroid trial or temporarily withholding further
HAART.

Steroids
• High-dose steroids (prednisolone 40 mg twice daily PO, or IV hydrocortisone) are recommended for all patients in respiratory failure. Treat
at high dose for 5 days; taper dose over 1–3 weeks (e.g. prednisolone
40 mg daily for days 6–11, then 20 mg daily for days 12–21).

Supportive therapy
• Hypoxia is common: administer supplementary high-ﬂow oxygen, and
consider use of CPAP. Mechanical ventilation, if considered appropriate,
may be required; make this decision prior to initiating CPAP
• Respiratory isolation is not recommended at present.

Outcome
• Mortality <10% in the setting of AIDS, but >30% in patients with
other forms of immunocompromise, probably reﬂecting the adverse
consequences of the greater pulmonary inﬂammatory response to
pneumocystis which is observed in non-HIV immunocompromise.
Mortality from PCP requiring mechanical ventilation in HIV-infected
patients is about 60%, although may be signiﬁcantly higher in patients
with low CD4-counts.

PCP: TREATMENT

• Relapse rate in AIDS is high (60% in one year), so secondary
prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole is recommended. Primary prophylaxis
is offered to HIV-positive patients with CD4 count <200 x 106/L. The
indications for prophylaxis in non-HIV patients are less well deﬁned;
consider prophylaxis for patients who are likely to receive high doses of
prednisolone for prolonged periods

Future developments
• The effect of co-infection with CMV on the outcome of PCP in HIVinfected patients is unclear. In patients with severe PCP treated with
steroids, the presence of CMV in BAL ﬂuid is associated with a worse
outcome; the role of anti-CMV therapy such as ganciclovir in such cases
is unknown
• The use of PCR to detect pneumocystis may further increase diagnostic
sensitivity, although in a proportion of cases detection using PCR is not
accompanied by evidence of clinical infection and appears to represent
colonization. It is unclear if asymptomatic carriage precedes infection in
such patients, and the consequences of carriage in immunocompetent
individuals are also unknown
• Pneumocystis is one of only a handful of cells known to be unable to
synthesize the metabolic intermediate molecule S-adenosylmethionine
(AdoMet), and as a result must scavenge this molecule from its host.
In a small study, lower plasma levels of AdoMet were demonstrated in
PCP when compared with healthy controls and individuals with other
pulmonary infections, suggesting a possible role for AdoMet in diagnosis.
This ﬁnding has not yet been replicated in a larger study, however.

CHAPTER 41

Respiratory infection: fungal

Endemic mycoses
Several types of dimorphic fungi are known to commonly cause pulmonary
disease in endemic regions, particularly in North America: histoplasmosis,
blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Endemic
fungi can rarely present in non-endemic areas, and diagnosis is often
delayed because of their non-speciﬁc and varied clinical features and the
failure to obtain a detailed travel history. Fungal infection may mimic other
diseases such as tuberculosis and lung cancer, often leading to inappropriate investigations and treatment. Fungal infections can also cause granulomata on lung biopsy, which sometimes results in diagnostic confusion
(e.g. with sarcoidosis).
Infection in immunocompetent individuals is usually either asymptomatic
or mild and self-limiting, although severe infection may rarely occur in
apparently immunocompetent individuals. Outbreaks of disease may occur,
as well as sporadic cases. Unlike invasive candidosis and aspergillosis, where
neutrophils are the key host defence mechanism, T-cell-mediated immunity
is essential for defence against the endemic mycoses. Patients with impaired
T-cell-mediated immunity (e.g. AIDS, lymphoma, steroid use) are therefore
at particular risk of developing severe or disseminated infection.

Histoplasmosis
Epidemiology Histoplasma capsulatum is found in bird and bat dropping
contaminated soil in the mid-west and south-east USA, particularly the Ohio
and Mississippi valleys, as well as in Mexico and parts of South America. The
mycelial form is inhaled and subsequently develops into the yeast form
(‘dimorphism’) within the lung, before spread via the lymphatics and the activation of T-cell-mediated immunity with granuloma development.

Clinical features Manifestations of infection are highly variable.
• Asymptomatic infection occurs in the majority of cases. CXR may be
normal or demonstrate single or multiple nodules, which may calcify
in a characteristic ‘target lesion’ pattern. Lymphadenopathy may occur
with eggshell calciﬁcation
• Acute symptoms may follow heavy or recurrent exposure (e.g. pigeon
fanciers, cavers). Range from a self-limiting ﬂu-like illness of fever, cough,
and malaise to fulminant disease with respiratory failure. CXR may be
normal or show consolidation, bilateral alveolar shadowing, multiple
small nodules, and sometimes lymphadenopathy
• Chronics progressive lung disease occurs particularly in patients with
underlying COPD; lung cavitation is common, sometimes leading to an
incorrect diagnosis of tuberculosis or cancer
• Disseminated disease may affect the immunocompromised (particularly
AIDS) and the elderly. Presentation may be acute or chronic, and
manifestations include fever, weight loss, and diffuse lung involvement,
although almost any organ system may be affected; other features may
include hepatosplenomegaly, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache and
meningism, cytopenias, endocarditis, and adrenal failure

HISTOPLASMOSIS

• Other unusual manifestations include broncholithiasis, mediastinal
ﬁbrosis (with compression of large airways, oesophagus, or superior
vena cava), or isolated extrapulmonary disease (e.g. arthritis, pericarditis, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme)

Diagnosis
• Smears or culture of infected material, e.g. sputum or BAL ﬂuid (for
chronic pulmonary disease, insensitive for acute disease), blood, urine,
or bone marrow (for disseminated disease). May take several weeks
• Serology in acute disease—typically negative at presentation, and
becomes positive after several weeks. A variety of serological tests are
in use, including:
• Complement ﬁxation, designed to detect antibodies to Histoplasma
mycelial antigen or Histoplasma yeast antigen. A positive result
(serum titre ≥ 1: 16 for mycelial antigen, ≥ 1: 32 for yeast antigen)
for either antigen, in a compatible clinical setting, is considered
diagnostic of active disease
• Immunodiffusion may distinguish active disease from previous
exposure, but is less sensitive than complement ﬁxation, and a
negative result does not exclude the diagnosis
• Serum or urine Histoplasma polysaccharide antigen test—useful for
diagnosis of disseminated disease and also pulmonary disease. Positive
in 85–95% cases in AIDS patients. Antigenuria is seen in 90%, and
antigenaemia in <50% of non-AIDS patients

Treatment
• Infection in immunocompetent individuals is typically self-limiting, and
symptoms usually resolve within 2–4 weeks without treatment
• Indications for antifungal treatment are:
• Persistent symptoms (usually lasting > 1 month)
• Progressive disseminated disease
• Heavy exposure leading to ARDS
• Infection in the setting of immunocompromise
• Oral itraconazole is appropriate for persistent symptoms in mild–
moderate disease and for disseminated disease, including patients with
AIDS who have mild disease. Treat for 6–12 weeks in acute
histoplasmosis, and for 1–2 years in chronic disease. In the setting of
AIDS, treatment should be lifelong or until CD4 count >200 for at least
6 months after starting HAART. Check itraconazole drug interactions
and monitor liver function (ideally monthly) if taking for >1 month.
Hypokalaemia may be associated with long-term use
• Intravenous amphotericin B should be used to treat severe infection in
the setting of ARDS or immunocompromise.

481

482

CHAPTER 41

Respiratory infection: fungal

Blastomycosis
Epidemiology Infection with Blastomyces dermatitidis follows the inhalation of spores from contaminated soil, and clinical infection may follow
outdoor activities. Blastomycosis is endemic in a distribution similar to
that of histoplasmosis in the USA, although extending further north: it is
endemic in the south-east USA, and the Mississippi, Ohio, and St Lawrence
river valleys. Blastomycosis also occurs in Africa, India, and the Middle East.
It is signiﬁcantly less common than histoplasmosis.
Clinical features Clinical presentation is variable, and may mimic other
diseases such as bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. Clinical
manifestations include:
• Asymptomatic in at least 50% of those infected
• Acute presentation is typically with fever, cough, productive of mucopurulent sputum, and sometimes pleuritic chest pain; misdiagnosis as
bacterial pneumonia is common. Acute presentation of fulminant respiratory disease with ARDS may occur. Other acute presentations include
a ﬂu-like illness with fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and erythema nodosum
• Chronic presentation may occur with fever, productive cough, and
weight loss
• Disseminated disease occurs in a minority of patients (especially in the
immunocompromised), and most commonly involves the lungs, skin,
bone, joints, and CNS.

CXR Airspace inﬁltrates are the most common ﬁnding, but a very wide
range of appearances are seen, including nodular pattern, lobar consolidation, diffuse inﬁltrates, or large peripheral masses (often with air bronchograms). Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions may rarely occur.

Diagnosis
• Diagnosis is by the staining or culture of infected material. A pyogenic
inﬂammatory response to the fungus is common (unlike in histoplasmosis)
and facilitates diagnosis
• Culture of sputum has a high yield and is diagnostic in most cases
of acute pulmonary disease. Multiple specimens may be required,
however. A drawback of sputum culture is that several weeks may be
required before the fungus is identiﬁed. Cytological examination of
sputum may provide a rapid diagnosis if the examiner is trained
appropriately and alerted to the possible diagnosis
• Bronchoscopy has a similar diagnostic yield to sputum culture (92%
in one study), and is recommended for patients with negative sputum
results; note that lidocaine may inhibit the fungal growth and minimal
concentrations should be used
• More invasive procedures such as surgical lung biopsy or thoracoscopy
are only rarely needed. Histological specimens require particular stains
(e.g. silver stain) to facilitate identiﬁcation of the fungus
• Currently available serological tests lack sensitivity and are rarely helpful.

Treatment is usually with itraconazole for at least 6 months. Observation
without treatment is not generally recommended, although this is controversial and symptoms are usually self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals. Amphotericin B should be used to treat very ill patients.

PARACOCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS

Coccidioidomycosis
Coccidioidomycosis is endemic in parts of south-west USA (Arizona,
California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada), northern Mexico, and
Central and South America. Infection follows inhalation of Coccidioides
immitis spores from soil. Manifestations of infection are variable, including:
• Asymptomatic infection, which appears to be common in endemic
regions
• Acute pulmonary disease. Presents in a similar manner to bacterial
pneumonia, with fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain, and often skin rash
(e.g. erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme). Eosinophilia may be
present. CXR appearance is variable, and may show areas of consolidation, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion, or be normal. The disease
is self-limiting in most cases; a minority progress to ARDS or chronic
disease
• Chronic pulmonary disease. Uncommon, may be asymptomatic. CXR
typically shows single or multiple nodules that may cavitate; upper lobe
inﬁltrates similar to those seen in tuberculosis may develop
• Disseminated disease. Rare, occurs particularly in the immunocompromised. Presentation may be acute or chronic. Pulmonary disease occurs
in association with involvement of the skin, bones, joints, genitourinary
system, or CNS.

Diagnosis is with stains or culture of infected tissues. Sputum cultures
are often positive in cavitating disease. BAL ﬂuid culture and lung biopsies
may also be diagnostic. Serological tests are also available.
Treatment is not required in the majority of patients, who have mild
self-limiting disease. Fluconazole is the antifungal of choice, when required.

Paracoccidioidomycosis
• Paracoccidioidomycosis is endemic in parts of Central and South
America and Mexico
• Typically presents as chronic pulmonary disease, although acute
disseminated disease may occur in the immunocompromised
• Diagnosis is made on culture of sputum or BAL ﬂuid, or following
staining of lung biopsy samples
• Treatment is with itraconazole, and long courses of up to 6 months
may be needed.

483

484

CHAPTER 41

Respiratory infection: fungal

Other fungi: cryptococcosis
Epidemiology
• Cryptococcus neoformans is found worldwide in bird droppings.
Following inhalation, yeasts propagate within the alveoli without usually
causing symptoms. Migration to the central nervous system may then
occur, and meningoencephalitis is the most common clinical manifestation of infection
• Patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity (e.g. AIDS, sterioid use,
lymphoma) are particularly vulnerable to cryptococcal infection

Clinical features
• Clinically evident cryptococcal lung disease is rare but well described,
even in HIV-negative patients. Symptoms are non-speciﬁc, including
fever and cough, and presentations may be acute or chronic. The CXR
nods to interstitial or pleural involvement
• Pulmonary involvement is often associated with meningitis, and clinical
signs of meningism are characteristically absent. CT head (to exclude a
space-occupying lesion) followed by lumbar puncture should therefore
be considered in all patients with pulmonary cryptococcal disease.

Diagnosis Diagnostic techniques include:
• India ink stain on CSF, or latex agglutination test for capsular antigen in
BAL or pleural ﬂuid, blood, or CSF
• Stains and culture of sputum, blood, urine, or BAL ﬂuid. Positive culture
from sputum may indicate colonization rather than active disease, and
should be interpreted in the clinical context
• Serum cryptococcal antigen test is extremely sensitive and speciﬁc for
the diagnosis
Treatment of cryptococcal infection in the immunocompromised is
with amphotericin B IV and ﬂucytosine IV for 2–3 weeks, followed by ﬂuconazole. The natural history of disease in immunocompetent patients is
poorly understood, and observation alone is often recommended; disseminated disease may occur, however, and some experts advise treatment
with ﬂuconazole.

CANDIDAL PNEUMONIA

Candidal pneumonia
• Candida occurs as part of the normal human ﬂora, and is found in the
gastrointestinal tract and on the skin. Invasive disease may occur in the
immunocompromised, particularly in neuropenic patients. Prophylaxis
with ﬂuconazole is used following bone marrow transplantation
• Candida is often isolated from respiratory secretions, but very rarely
causes respiratory disease. Seeding of the lungs leading to inﬁltrates or
enlarging nodules may occur with disseminated candidal infection
• Risk factors for candidaemia include immunocompromise, central
venous lines, parenteral nutrition, and gastrointestinal surgery. In lung
transplant recipients a positive donor tracheal culture for Candida is a
marker for post-transplant candidal infection
• The clinical and radiological features of pulmonary involvement are
non-speciﬁc. Extrapulmonary manifestations of infection are common,
e.g. skin, eye, hepatic, or CNS involvement. Candidaemia is typically
associated with a high fever
• Deﬁnitive diagnosis of pulmonary disease requires identiﬁcation of
tissue invasion by Candida on TBB or surgical lung biopsy
• Treat with amphotericin B 0.7 mg/kg/day IV or ﬂuconazole 400 mg/day
PO, and remove any central lines
• Candidaemia carries a mortality of 30–40%.

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

Tuberculosis: epidemiology and
pathophysiology
Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading infectious cause of death worldwide (after AIDS), killing around 2 million people per year, despite being a
potentially curable disease. Rising rates of HIV and immigration mean that
TB remains a large proportion of the workload for respiratory physicians
in some parts of the UK. The disease is a great mimicker and should often
be considered as a differential diagnosis.

Epidemiology The highest incidence is in sub-Saharan Africa (290 cases
per 100 000 population). High population density countries in Asia (India,
China, Pakistan, and Indonesia) account for half the global burden. The
countries comprising the former Soviet Union have rapidly increasing rates
because of economic decline and failing health services, with around 10%
multi-drug resistance in this area. Globally, around 11% of TB cases are
co-infected with HIV, with this number increasing to 38% in sub-Saharan
Africa, and less than 1% in India and China.
In the UK, 37% of TB cases are in Caucasians (usually over the age of
50), with 60% in people born abroad (median age of 30). At least 3% of
cases are co-infected with HIV. TB is concentrated in the major cities, with
40% of cases in London.

Pathophysiology The disease is spread by airborne droplets containing
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Droplets can remain airborne for
hours after expectoration, because of their small size. Infectious droplets
are inhaled and become lodged in the distal airways.
MTB is taken up by alveolar macrophages, with either successful
containment of the infection, or progression to primary disease (primary
progressive TB).
MTB replicates following ingestion by alveolar macrophages, with spread
via the lymphatics to hilar lymph nodes. Cell-mediated immunity leads
to granuloma formation by activated T lymphocytes and macrophages,
which limits further bacterial replication and disease spread. Unless
there is a deﬁciency in cell-mediated immunity, active disease may never
occur.
Active disease occurs when the host’s immune response is unable to
contain MTB replication, occurring most often in the lung parenchyma
and hilar lymph nodes. It can occur in any organ, from haematogenous
spread. This is most common in young children and in immunosuppressed
adults.
Many factors inﬂuence whether or not infection leads to active disease,
including age, host immunity, and time since infection. The estimated
lifetime risk of clinical disease of a child newly infected with MTB is
about 10%.
Most disease in adults is due to reactivation of childhood disease,
so-called ‘post primary disease’, from activation of latent TB lying dormant
in the lung Gohn’s focus.

TUBERCULOSIS: EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Main risk factors for active TB in the UK
1. Place and date of birth:
• Caucasian population, increasing prevalence with age (M >F)
• Black immigrants, highest prevalence in the young (M = F)
• Indian subcontinent, highest prevalence in middle age (M = F)
2. HIV/AIDS
3. Poverty—1 in 50 homeless people in London have TB
4. Medical factors—diabetes, renal disease, malignant disease, systemic
chemotherapy, steroids and new TNFA antagonists e.g. inﬂiximab. Also
smoking and vitamin D deﬁciency (a relationship between the vitamin
D receptor and interleukin-1 levels is postulated)
Smear positive TB
Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) seen on sputum smear (Ziehl–Neelsen stain),
potentially infectious. Patient may need to be isolated.
Culture positive TB
AFB not seen on smear. TB grown on culture (may take up to 9 weeks).
Much less infectious.

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

TB: pulmonary disease
Symptoms
Most cases present with pulmonary disease, classically:
• Productive cough
• Haemoptysis
• Breathlessness
• Systemic symptoms—weight loss, night sweats, and malaise
• Chest pain

Haemoptysis is more common with cavitatory disease, and up to
two-thirds will be smear positive. Most haemoptysis is small volume.
Massive haemoptysis is rare, and is most common as a consequence of
destruction of a lobe, with consequent bronchiectasis formation (possibly
with secondary aspergillus infection or mycetoma in a healed TB cavity).
This is seen in those untreated in the pre-chemotherapy era. Most haemoptysis will resolve with antituberculous chemotherapy.
Signs are often non-speciﬁc.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Examination may be normal
Lymphadenopathy (particularly cervical)
Crackles
Signs of a pleural effusion
Signs of consolidation (with extensive disease)
Signs of weight loss/underlying immunocompromise
Look for evidence of extrapulmonary disease, e.g. skin, joints, CNS,
retina, and spinal disease

Complications Long-term sequelae of inadequately treated infection
include:
• Bronchiectasis, bronchial obstruction, and airway stenosis (uncommon)
may result from endobronchial disease, though this is much less
common in the post-chemotherapy era. It is more common in the presence of extensive parenchymal disease, and is associated with lymph
node enlargement with compromise of airway size
• Pleural disease is due to either primary progressive disease or reactivation of latent infection. It probably represents an increased immune
response—a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction to mycobacterial
antigens, rather than a diminished one, which is the case in other forms
of TB infection. Culture is more likely from pleural tissue than ﬂuid
(where the organism burden is lower). See p 294
• Pneumothorax is rare (<1% in the developed world) and results from
the rupture of a peripheral cavity. Can lead to the formation of a
bronchopleural ﬁstula
• Draining abscess
• Right middle lobe syndrome—compression of the right middle lobe
bronchus by hilar lymph nodes leads to lobar collapse
• The previous treatment with thoracoplasty can lead to respiratory
failure in later life due to compromised vital capacity

TB: EXTRAPULMONARY DISEASE

TB: extrapulmonary disease
Extrapulmonary disease is seen in about 20% of HIV seronegative patients.
This proportion is higher in HIV positive patients.
The tuberculin skin test (see p 492) is more frequently positive in extrapulmonary disease, as this most commonly represents reactivation disease,
and less commonly primary disease. Anergy is more likely in those with
poor nutritional status, underlying disease (including HIV), and the elderly.
CNS disease This is the most serious manifestation, and includes meningeal involvement and space-occupying lesions (tuberculoma) that lead to
cranial nerve lesions. The clinical manifestations are due to the presence
of MTB, and the host’s immune response to it.
TB meningitis presents with headache, fever, altered conscious level, and
focal neurological signs, including cranial nerve palsies. Fits are common.
CSF contains lymphocytes, high protein, and low glucose. PCR of CSF
may be useful, but is not 100% sensitive.
Pericardial TB The yield is low from pericardial ﬂuid and biopsy. 85% have
a positive tuberculin test. A large effusion may lead to cardiac tamponade,
and may need to be drained.
Spinal disease can affect any bone or joint; spine involvement (Pott’s
disease) is most common in the thoracic spine. Surgery may be needed if
there is evidence of cord compression or instability.
GU disease from seeding during haematogenous spread. Involvement of
the renal and genital tracts is uncommon.
In men—may cause prostatitis and epididymitis.
In women—genitourinary TB is a cause of infertility. Sterile pyuria
(white and red blood cells in the urine, in the absence of bacterial infection) may indicate TB infection.
Peripheral cold abscess can occur at almost any body site.
Disseminated disease is more common in immunosuppressed individuals.
Pulmonary disease is typically a miliary (millet seed) pattern, but pulmonary disease is not universal in disseminated disease. This has a higher
mortality than localized disease.

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

TB: investigations
The diagnosis is usually made in one of three ways: sputum (or other
sample, e.g. pus, CSF, urine, a minimum of three samples) smear or culture,
or the identiﬁcation of tissue caseating granulomas.
• CXR classically shows upper lobe inﬁltrates with cavitation.
• May be associated with hilar or paratracheal lymphadenopathy
• May show changes consistent with prior TB infection, with ﬁbrous
scar tissue and calciﬁcation
• HIV infected patients typically have less ﬂorid CXR changes, and
are less likely to have cavitatory disease. Miliary pattern is more
common in later stages of AIDS
• All patients with non-pulmonary TB should have a CXR, to exclude
or conﬁrm pulmonary disease
• Sputum Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) stain and culture is required for deﬁnitive
diagnosis, and is vital for drug resistance testing. ZN is only 50–80%
sensitive
• Smear negative disease accounts for about 20% of disease transmission;
smear positive cases are more infectious
• Induced sputum is as effective as BAL, especially if the CXR shows
changes consistent with active disease (but should not be used for
potential MDR-TB, due to the danger to health workers)
• Conventional culture takes 6 weeks or longer
• Nucleic acid ampliﬁcation techniques and DNA ﬁnger printing may
be used to conﬁrm mycobacteria serotype and drug susceptibility.
May also be useful in elucidating the epidemiology of TB outbreaks
• Non-mycobacterial TB (opportunistic mycobacteria) tend to be
present in much lower concentrations than MTB, and are therefore
seen on a smear much less commonly, but many grow much faster,
and are therefore seen on culture much earlier
• Tuberculin skin test is only useful if strongly positive (suggesting active
disease) or if negative. The skin test must be interpreted with the clinical
picture, and with knowledge of the patient’s ethnic origin, exposure,
and BCG vaccination history. Novel immune-based rapid blood tests
for the diagnosis of latent TB are probably more sensitive and speciﬁc
and some now favour their use (p 510)
• Bronchoscopy may be needed to obtain BAL samples if there is a high
index of clinical suspicion, but a non-productive cough or unhelpful
sputum culture. In extensive disease, macroscopic bronchoscopic
abnormality may be present, with erythematous or ulcerated airways.
Granulation tissue or enlarged lymph nodes may be visible. Nodes can
perforate or protrude into the bronchial lumen, extruding caseous
material into the airway. This is rare in the developed world
• Biopsy from extrapulmonary sites, e.g. neck lymph nodes, or mediastinoscopy may be warranted. Lymph node biopsy samples, pleural
biopsies, and pus aspirated from lymph nodes should be transported to
the laboratory in a dry pot (not formalin). Bone marrow or liver biopsy
may aid diagnosis in miliary TB. The bone marrow culture yield is higher
in pancytopenia

TB: INVESTIGATIONS

• Gastric washings reﬂect TB swallowed overnight. Rarely performed if
bronchoscopy is readily available. Used more commonly in children
• Blood tests Baseline FBC, renal, and liver function tests. Useful to document normal baseline levels before starting antituberculous chemotherapy. HIV test is mandatory in all
• Urine Early morning urine (EMU) if renal disease suspected
• CT scan is more sensitive than CXR, especially for smaller areas of
disease. It may show cavitatory disease, and signs of airway disease—
the ‘tree in bud’ appearance, useful for differentiating between active
disease and non-active old disease. Less commonly needed.
A tuberculoma is an encapsulated focus of reactivated TB. These lesions
rarely cavitate, and the differential diagnosis is wide, including malignancy
and vasculitis. Diagnosis may only be possible by percutaneous biopsy as,
in the absence of a main airway component, cultures may be negative.

Skin tests
• Mantoux
• Read at 48 h
• Intradermal. Use 0.1 mL of 1 in 1000 (= 0.1 mL of 100 TU/mL = 10
tuberculin units)
• Graded:
<5 mm
negative
5–14 mm
positive
>15mm
strongly positive
• Heaf test. This has been phased out in the UK. Mantoux testing is the
method of choice
• Read at 1 week
• 100 000 TU/mL (multipuncture)
• Graded:
• Grade 0 no reaction
• Grade 1 4–6 small dots
• Grade 2 coalesces, normal skin in centre
• Grade 3 coalesces, central skin ﬁlled (5–10 mm wide)
• Grade 4 solid induration >10 mm 9 vesiculation or ulceration
• An excessive response can be treated with topical betnovate
(PPD is dead material)

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

TB: management 1
Treatment aims to cure disease without relapse, prevent transmission, and
prevent emergence of drug resistance.
Long-term treatment with a number of drugs is required as, before
treatment is started, TB can remain dormant for long periods, making the
emergence of naturally resistant mutants possible.
• Never treat with a single drug
• Never add a single drug to a failing regime
• Send material for bacteriological diagnosis prior to initiating treatment.
The majority of patients can be treated as out-patients.
Smear-positive HIV-negative patients should become smear-negative
within 2 weeks of starting treatment (this does not apply to MDR-TB).
These patients should be isolated either at hospital (if they are admitted)
or at home for this time period.
Notiﬁcation All new cases must be notiﬁed (including those diagnosed
after death), as this initiates contact tracing. In some districts notiﬁcation triggers specialist nursing input. The doctor making the diagnosis has
a legal responsibility to notify. It also provides epidemiological and surveillance data, enabling treatment and screening services to be planned.
A patient can be denotiﬁed if the mycobacterium cultured turns out to be
an opportunistic mycobacterium, for example.

Drug treatment It is vital to send material for laboratory diagnosis if
possible (to allow for subsequent drug susceptibility testing) prior to the
initiation of treatment. In practice, if there is a high clinical suspicion of
TB, treatment should be started before culture and full sensitivities are
available.
Drug treatment is usually in 2 phases:
Initial intensive phase (designed to kill actively growing bacteria), followed
by a continuation phase (designed to eliminate residual bacteria).
• The intensive phase (8 weeks) shortens the duration of infectiousness
At least three drugs are needed, e.g. isoniazid (bactericidal), rifampicin
(bacteriostatic), and pyrazinamide (bacteriostatic/partially bacteriocidal).
Three drugs reduces the treatment time from 9 to 6 months
• Ethambutol added if there is a likelihood of drug resistance
(in practice this is standard therapy for non-Caucasian patients, who
are more likely to have come from an area with a high prevalence of
resistance)
• The continuation phase is usually with two drugs. Fewer bacteria are
present at the start of this phase, and there is therefore a lower chance
that drug-resistant mutants will emerge, making drug resistance less of
a problem.
Compliance is of major importance and all patients should have a risk assessment for treatment adherence. If the clinical response is not satisfactory,
check sputum 2 months before the end of the planned treatment period.

TB: MANAGEMENT 1

Compliance can be monitored with urine colour testing (turns red
with rifampicin) and tablet counts. If concerns about compliance, consider
directly observed treatment (DOT). Every TB patient should have a key
worker, who should be easily contactable.
From September 2007 there are no prescription costs for TB drugs in
the UK.

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

TB: management 2
Directly observed therapy (DOT) aims to increase compliance, by
nurse-supervised and observed daily or weekly tablet swallowing. This
has been shown to increase treatment completion, reduce relapses, and
reduce development of drug resistance, as the ingestion of each dose is
witnessed. This is recommended for patients unlikely to comply, including
alcoholics, drug abusers, the homeless, those with serious mental illness,
and those with MDR-TB. Consider other incentives to improve adherence
such as providing food and transport costs.
Compulsory detention under Sections 37 and 38 of the Public Health
Act (England) is allowed for infectious pulmonary TB, but compulsory
treatment is not allowed. This is only used in extreme circumstances to
protect public health.

Standard treatment regimes (see p 498)
• The standard regime is for 6 months—four drugs in the initial 2-month
phase (rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H), pyrazinamide (Z), and ethambutol (E)
(or streptomycin) and 2 drugs in the last 4 months (rifampicin and isoniazid) in patients with fully sensitive organisms
• If drug sensitivity is unavailable at 2 months, continue the 4-drug regime
until it is available (even if this is for more than 2 months)
• The fourth drug (usually ethambutol) can be omitted in those at low
risk of isoniazid resistance (non-previously treated, HIV-negative,
UK-born Caucasians, with no drug-resistant contacts). There is a higher
risk of isoniazid resistance in ethnic minority groups, immigrants,
refugees, those who have had previous treatment, and those who are
HIV positive. This depends on local policy and the ethnic make-up of
the local area. If in doubt, start treatment with 4 drugs
• Other treatment regimes are also effective (e.g. daily for 2 months, then
2 or 3 times weekly for 4 months, or 3 times weekly for the whole
6 months), though are used less commonly
• Check baseline renal and liver function in all patients. If normal, and not
at high risk of adverse drug reaction, they do not need to be
re-checked
• Dosages are weight dependent, and may need to be changed for weight
loss or gain during the treatment course
• A 6-month treatment course is effective for all other forms of
non-CNS extrapulmonary TB (including lymph node and spinal
disease), with the same drugs as for respiratory disease. Surgery may
be needed in addition, for spinal disease
• CNS disease needs a 12-month treatment course
• Steroids may be useful for large pleural effusions, pericardial effusions
(60 mg/day for constrictive pericarditis), and CNS disease, especially if
associated with neurological impairment. Steroids may also be indicated
in ureteric disease, and to suppress hypersensitivity reactions to the
TB drugs.

TB: MANAGEMENT 2

• Peripheral lymph nodes may enlarge and abscesses may form during
treatment; this does not imply failure of treatment, but should prompt
a compliance check
• Pyridoxine is not required, unless subjects are at higher risk of
pyrazinamide-related peripheral neuropathy—in diabetes, renal failure,
HIV, and alcoholics.
Meningitis A 12-month course of rifampicin and isoniazid, with pyrazinamide and a fourth drug (e.g. ethambutol) for at least the ﬁrst 2 months, is
effective. If pyrazinamide not used, extend treatment period to 18 months.
Steroids may be needed for severe disease, equivalent to prednisolone 20–
40 mg OD if on rifampicin, otherwise 10–20 mg OD. Steroids can usually
be tapered after the initial 2–3 weeks of treatment. Ethambutol should
be used with caution in unconscious patients, as visual acuity cannot be
tested and there is a small risk of ocular toxicity.
Cerebral tuberculoma without meningitis 12-month regime.
Disseminated TB/miliary TB 6-month regime unless CNS involvement.
Exclude CNS disease in miliary TB with CSF examination, whether or
not symptoms are present. Start treatment even if LFTs are abnormal
(this may be due to intrahepatic granulomas). Seek advice if LTFs deteriorate signiﬁcantly on treatment. See p 505.
Bone and spinal TB 6-month standard regime. A CT or MRI should be
performed in patients with active spinal disease who have neurological
symptoms and signs. If there is direct spinal cord involvement (e.g. a spinal
cord tuberculoma), treatment should be as for meningeal TB. There is no
place for routine spinal surgery (e.g. anterior spinal fusion) in the absence
of spinal instability.
Pericardial TB standard 6-month regime. Steroids, e.g. prednisolone 60 mg
OD, tapered after 2–3 weeks of treatment may be required.
Peripheral lymph node TB standard 6-month regime, which should be
used even if the infected node has been surgically removed. Stop treatment at the end of the 6-month course, regardless of the appearance of
new nodes, residual nodes, or draining sinuses.
Patient advice to document on starting standard anti-TB chemotherapy
• Possibility of nausea and abdominal pain
• Persistent vomiting and/or jaundice—stop drugs immediately and
contact doctor
• Red urine with rifampicin
• Red contact lenses with rifampicin
• Contraception advice, if on the oral contraceptive pill as efﬁcacy
reduced
• Visual acuity (Snellen chart) (ethambutol)
• Visual disturbance (ethambutol)—stop drugs immediately and contact
doctor
• Potential drug interactions.

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

First-line antituberculosis drugs
Isoniazid (H) Bactericidal. Single daily dose, well tolerated. Major side-effect
is age-dependent hepatitis. Increased toxicity with alcohol. Peripheral neuropathy is uncommon; although increased risk with diabetes and pregnancy; reduce incidence with 10 mg pyridoxine daily
Rifampicin (R) Bactericidal. Single daily dose, well tolerated. Increases
hepatic microsomal enzymes; therefore increases clearance of hepatic
metabolized drugs, including prednisolone and the oral contraceptive pill,
thus the risks of pregnancy must be highlighted. Red discoloration of urine
and contact lenses also occurs, and GI upset.
Pyrazinamide (Z) Bactericidal. Single daily dose. GI upset common. Major
side-effect is hepatic toxicity. Renal excretion leads to hyperuricaemia.
Ethambutol (E) has some bactericidal effect, mostly bacteriostatic at
usual doses. Single daily dose, well tolerated. Side-effect—optic neuritis,
uncommon. Document visual acuity (Snellen chart) before starting.
Streptomycin Bactericidal. Given parenterally. Increased risk of ototoxicity in the fetus and the elderly.
Combined preparations
Riﬁnah® 150 (contains rifampicin 150 mg and isoniazid 100 mg), Riﬁnah®
300 (contains rifampicin 300 mg and isoniazid 150 mg).
Rifater® (contains 120 mg rifampicin, 50 mg isoniazid, and 300 mg pyrazinamide).

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

TB: in-patient admission
• This is rarely needed but, if necessary, patients with suspected
pulmonary TB should initially be admitted to a side room vented to
the outside air (until proven non-infectious)
• Patients with smear-positive non-MDR-TB should be managed as
infectious (in a side room, with face mask). This especially applies if
they are on a ward with immunosuppressed patients (who may be at
higher risk)
• A risk assessment (including an assessment of the immune status
of other ward patients) can be made once the infectiousness and
likelihood of drug resistance of the patient are known
• Patients with non-pulmonary TB can be nursed on a general ward
(but aerosol-generating procedures, e.g. abscess irrigation, may need
patient isolation)
• Staff should wear face masks if the patient is potentially infectious
• In-patients with smear-positive pulmonary TB should be asked to wear
a face mask whenever they leave their room, unless they have received
2 weeks’ drug treatment
• Barrier nursing is unnecessary for smear-negative non-MDR-TB
• Liaise closely with infection control/microbiology/public health
specialists
• If a patient on an open ward is found to have infectious TB, the risk
to the other patients is small. Patients whose exposure is considered
comparable to that of a household contact should be screened. Only
those in the same bay as a coughing infectious case, for at least 8 h, are
considered at risk. Exposure should be documented and the patient
and the GP contacted
• Non-MDR-TB HIV-negative patients usually become non-infectious
after 2 weeks chemotherapy. Any bacilli seen in smears after that time
are likely to be dead
• Patients with HIV and those with TB should not be nursed in close
proximity
• All patients with known or suspected MDR-TB should be admitted to
negative pressure ventilated side room. Staff should wear protective
face masks (FFP3)
• At discharge, a clear plan must be in place for the administration and
supervision of all chemotherapy; this is particularly important for
patients with MDR-TB, where close liaison with the infection control
team and consultant in communicable disease control is paramount.

Treatment failure/disease relapse
• This is usually due to poor compliance
• Drug resistance may have developed
• Never add a single drug to a failing regime. Add only 2 or 3, ideally
those to which the patient has not been previously exposed
• Assume drug resistance to all or some of the drugs in the failed regime
• Repeat cultures and sensitivity testing in this situation. Consider speciﬁc
molecular tests for rifampicin resistance. If found, then treat as for
MDR-TB (see p 508).

TB: IN-PATIENT ADMISSION

TB: treatment follow-up
• CXR is advised at the end of therapy for pulmonary disease
• Relapse is uncommon in those compliant with standard treatment
regimes in the UK (0–3%); therefore long-term follow-up is not
recommended
• Follow-up at 12 months after treatment completion is recommended
for patients treated for drug-resistant TB
• Relapse after good compliance is usually due to fully sensitive organism;
therefore treatment can be with the same regime again
• Relapse due to poor compliance needs a fully supervised regime.

MDR-TB follow-up
Prolonged follow-up is recommended; lifelong for HIV-positive patients.

501

502

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

TB in pregnancy
There is no increased risk of developing clinical disease in pregnancy.
Presentation is the same as in non-pregnant individuals, but the diagnosis
may be delayed by the non-speciﬁc nature of the symptoms in the early
stages of disease, with malaise and fatigue being common in the early
stages of pregnancy. A CXR is more likely to be delayed.
The tuberculin skin test result is not affected by pregnancy; this applies
to HIV positive and negative subjects. A negative skin test should not lead
to BCG vaccination, as live vaccines are contraindicated in pregnancy. In
this situation, the skin test should be repeated after delivery, and BCG
given then, after a second negative test.

TB outcome in pregnancy
• If diagnosed in the ﬁrst trimester, the disease has the same outcome as
for non-pregnant women
• If diagnosed in the second or third trimester, studies give more variable outcomes (some studies show a good fetal outcome; some show
higher rates of small-for-dates babies, pre-eclampsia, and spontaneous
abortion), but these effects tend to be related to late diagnosis and
incomplete drug treatment. Some studies also show a poorer fetal
outcome in extrapulmonary disease
• Late diagnosis of pulmonary TB can lead to a 4-fold increased
obstetric mortality and 9-fold increased pre-term labour in some
developing countries.

Treatment in pregnancy
• Isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol are not teratogenic, and can be
used safely in pregnancy. The ‘standard’ short course therapy is
recommended (i.e. 6-month treatment)
• Limited pyrazinamide data on the risk of teratogenicity
• Streptomycin may be ototoxic to the fetus
• Active TB must be treated in pregnancy, because of the risk of
untreated disease to the mother and fetus
• Reserve drugs may be toxic, and the risk/beneﬁt ratio of each case
must be assessed individually if second-line drugs are needed
• Babies of sputum-positive mothers, who have had less than 2 weeks
treatment by delivery, should be treated with isoniazid and have a
skin test at 6 weeks. If the skin test is negative, the chemoprophylaxis
should be stopped and BCG given 1 week later (as BCG is sensitive to
isoniazid)
• Congenital infection is very rare (less than 300 reported cases). The
child can be infected at delivery (this is rare).

TB IN PREGNANCY

Breast feeding
• Most antituberculosis drugs are safe. Isoniazid—monitor infant for
possible toxicity, as there is a theoretical risk of convulsions and
neuropathy. Give prophylactic pyridoxine to the mother and infant
• Concentrations of drugs reaching breast milk are too low to prevent or
treat infection in the infant

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

TB chemotherapy with
comorbid disease
Liver disease
• Drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal. A raised ALT is more common
in those who regularly consume alcohol, have viral hepatitis or other
chronic liver disease, take concomitant hepatotoxic drugs, are pregnant,
or are within 3 months post partum
• About 20% of those treated with isoniazid alone will have an asymptomatic transient rise in ALT. In the majority, this represents hepatic
adaptation. Acetylator status (fast or slow) may inﬂuence this
• Isoniazid-induced hepatitis can be symptomatic or asymptomatic
usually occurs within weeks or months of treatment, and is age related
• Isoniazid inhibits several cytochrome P450 enzymes, potentially
increasing the plasma concentrations of other hepatotoxic drugs
• Rifampicin can cause subclinical hyperbilirubinaemia without
hepatocellular damage. It can also cause direct hepatocellular damage
and potentiate the hepatotoxicity of other TB drugs
• Pyrazinamide should not be used in patients with known chronic liver
disease
• Decompensated liver disease—use a drug regime without rifampicin
• Baseline and regular monitoring of liver function is necessary (weekly
LFTs for the ﬁrst 2 weeks, then at 2-weekly intervals).

Renal failure
• Isoniazid and rifampicin have biliary excretion, so can be given in
normal doses in renal disease
• Pyrazinamide metabolites are renally cleared; the dose may need to be
less frequent in those with renal insufﬁciency
• Give pyridoxine in addition to isoniazid in those with severe renal
disease to prevent isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy
• Ethambutol can accumulate causing optic neuropathy; therefore use a
lower dose
• Dialysis patients should receive drugs after dialysis.

HIV infection
• Regimes are similar for HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients; give a
standard 4-drug regime. Liaise closely with HIV specialists
• Better outcome with regimes including rifampicin
• Death during tuberculosis chemotherapy is more common in
HIV-infected patients, who also have higher relapse rates than nonHIV-infected subjects
• Higher incidence of miliary disease in those with low CD4 counts
• Protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitors
should not be used with rifampicin (they interfere with each other’s
metabolism)
• Paradoxical worsening of disease (worsening fever, CXR inﬁltrates, or
new manifestations of the disease) at the initiation of HIV treatment
are more common in HIV-positive patients. This is probably due to

TB CHEMOTHERAPY WITH COMORBID DISEASE

immune reconstitution, and the increased recognition of mycobacterial
antigens with improvement of the subject’s immune response
• Patients co-infected with TB and HIV should be considered potentially
infectious at each admission, until proved otherwise, and should be
segregated from others. Review the immune status of other patients
and their likely drug resistances, and their potential infectiousness
• In HIV-infected individuals (in whom the HIV diagnosis is new), usual
practice is to start tuberculosis chemotherapy before HIV chemotherapy. Antiretroviral therapy is usually started later (but there is no
consensus as to when). Liaise closely with HIV specialists.

Diabetes
Increased risk of TB, and the disease may be more extensive. Rifampicin
reduces the efﬁcacy of sulphonylureas.

TB drugs and abnormal liver function tests
• Chronic liver disease—regular monitoring of LFTs, weekly for the
ﬁrst 2 weeks, then at 2-weekly intervals
• New drug-induced hepatitis
• Virological tests to exclude concomitant viral hepatitis
• AST/ALT rise 2× normal—monitor LFTs weekly for 2 weeks, then
2-weekly until normal.
• AST/ALT rise under 2× normal—repeat LFT at 2 weeks.
• AST/ALT rise 5× normal or bilirubin rise—cease rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide unless the patient is unwell. If the patient
is unwell, or sputum still positive, consider admission for parenteral
therapy, e.g. streptomycin and ethambutol with appropriate
monitoring
• Drug re-challenge once LFTs are normal:
• Re-introduce sequentially, in order:
Isoniazid: at 50 mg/day, sequential increase to 300 mg/day after
2–3 days if no reaction
Rifampicin: at 75 mg/day, increase to 300 mg/day after 2–3 days if
no reaction, then to maximum dose/kg
Pyrazinamide: start at 250 mg/day, increase to 1 g/day after 2–3
days, and to maximum dose/kg if no reaction
• Daily monitoring of LFTs and clinical condition
• If no further reaction, continue chemotherapy
• If there is a further reaction, exclude the offending drug, and change
to an alternative regime
• If intolerant of pyrazinamide, use rifampicin and isoniazid for
9 months, with ethambutol for 2 months.

505

506

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

TB: adverse drug reactions
These occur in around 10% of patients, often requiring a change of therapy.
Reactions are more common in those on non-standard therapy and in
HIV-positive individuals.
Isoniazid peripheral neuropathy can be prevented by pyridoxine 10 mg
daily (recommended in those at highest risk—diabetes, renal failure, alcoholics, HIV-positive).
Rifampicin causes shock, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia. Withdraw
and do not reintroduce the drug. Double maintenance steroid doses at
the start of treatment (because of enzyme induction).
Ethambutol causes rare optic toxicity; recommend baseline visual acuity
assessment with a Snellen chart. Use only in those with adequate visual
acuity, and those able to report changes in visual acuity or new visual
symptoms. Document that the patient has been told to cease the drug
immediately at the onset of new visual symptoms.
Check baseline renal function before starting ethambutol, and avoid in
renal failure.
HIV-positive patients Rifampicin and isoniazid lead to reduced serum
concentrations of antifungals. Ketoconazole can inhibit rifampicin absorption. Rifampicin may reduce drug levels of protease inhibitors (as they
are metabolized via the cytochrome P450 pathway, which is induced
by rifampicin). Rifabutin can cause a severe iritis. Liaise closely with
HIV specialist.

Drug resistance occurs in less than 2% of Caucasian cases in the UK,
with higher levels in ethnic minority groups.
• Isoniazid resistance is seen in up to 6% in patients of African and Indian
subcontinent origin.
• Increased drug resistance is seen in HIV-positive patients (fourfold
increased risk).
• Second-line drugs are generally more toxic and less effective than ﬁrstline drugs, and the treatment of drug resistance can therefore often be
complex and difﬁcult
• The regime must include at least three drugs to which the organism is
known to be susceptible. An injectible drug is often added, as this has
shown improved outcomes
• The initial regime will depend on the incidence of drug resistance in
the community, and should be altered depending on local drug susceptibility patterns
• In general, always add at least two drugs to which the MTB is susceptible
• Parenteral treatment is usually recommended when there is resistance
to two or more drugs.

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

Multiple drug resistant TB (MDR-TB)
Deﬁned as MTB resistant to two or more ﬁrst-line agents, usually isoniazid and rifampicin.
• Treatment is complex and time-consuming
• MDR-TB is not more infectious than other forms of TB, but the consequences of acquiring it are more serious
• Seek specialist advice; patients should be managed by experts with
experience of managing resistant cases, in a hospital with isolation facilities. The mdrtbcentre@ctc.nhs.uk email address, based in Liverpool,
can be used to seek advice from experts in the management of MDR
disease. An MDR-TB UK database is run from the Cardiothoracic
Centre in Liverpool
• Rapid molecular tests for rifampicin resistance should be carried out in
all patients suspected of having MDR-TB. Liaise closely with the reference laboratory
• Close monitoring (because of increased drug toxicity) is needed
• Compliance is paramount
• MDR-TB comprised 1.3% of all UK cases in 1998
• Start treatment with 5 or more drugs to which the organism is likely to
be susceptible. Continue until sputum cultures are negative. Continue
with at least 3 drugs to which TB is sensitive, for a minimum of 9 months,
sometimes for 24 months
• Surgery may be indicated.

Contacts of MDR-TB Chemoprophylaxis for contacts should include
at least 2 drugs. Base the drug choice on the sensitivities of the index case
for a minimum of 6 months (although there are no data to support this
treatment period). If there is extensive resistance, no regime may be suitable, and regular follow-up needed instead.

Risk factors for resistant disease
•
•
•
•
•
•

Previous anti-TB treatment, prior treatment failure
HIV infection
Contact with drug-resistant disease
Residence in London
Male gender, age 25–44
Treatment failure.

XDR-TB ‘extensively drug-resistant TB’ is disease resistant to at least
three classes of second line drugs. 347 infected patients are described
worldwide so far, and the disease appears to be emerging in regions with
high HIV prevalence, where it has a mortality of nearly 100%. 2004 data
estimates that 0.4% of the global burden of TB is XDR-TB, about 30 000 cases.
Genotyping data suggest the emergence of XDR-TB is due to the transmission of XDR strains between individuals, and is not a consequence
of previous unsuccessful treatment. 85% of South African XDR isolates
are from the KZN family of tuberculosis strains, which were mostly fully
susceptible when ﬁrst described in 1996.

If the drug choice is limited by drug resistance and intolerance, consider

must be carried out with concurrent treatment with 2 other drugs
(to minimize emergence of resistant strains).

Immunotherapy Additional treatments aimed at immunomodulation
may facilitate bacillary clearance and increase cure rates, particularly in
MDR disease. Small studies suggest that IL-2 and nebulized interferongamma may have some beneﬁt in this setting, and in patients with HIV
co-infection. A larger study in HIV-negative patients with pulmonary TB has
not shown improved bacillary clearance, suggesting that single cytokine
therapy in individuals with drug-susceptible TB is unlikely to improve the
outcome. In MDR-TB, however, there may be greater beneﬁts of treatment. Administration of M. vaccae has been postulated to enhance the
Th1 response and suppress Th2 responses to MTB, but clinical trials of
this agent have been disappointing, despite promising in vitro studies.

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

Latent TB infection
Deﬁned as a positive skin test, with a normal CXR and no symptoms.
This represents the presence of a small total number of bacteria.
Tuberculin skin test A positive skin test results from the development of
cell-mediated immunity against TB. The multiple puncture method (Heaf)
is being phased out. Mantoux testing is used more commonly in the UK.
Potential problems with skin testing:
• Low sensitivity in the immunocompromised, and cross-reactivity
with BCG
• The patient has to return to have the test read after 48–72 h
• Criteria for a positive test depend on the population in which it is being
used.
Interferon gamma tests Two blood tests (T-SPOT.TB, Oxford Immunotec
Ltd. and QuantiFERON-TB Gold, Cellestis Ltd.) are now commercially
available, and are based on the detection of IFNγ released by T cells in
response to M. tuberculosis speciﬁc antigens. The T-SPOT.TB test is an
ELISpot test, counting individual T cells producing IFNγ; the QuantiFERON
test is based on a whole-blood ELISA, and measures the IFNγ level in the
supernatant of the stimulated whole blood sample. Both assays use two
proteins (ESAT-6 and CFP10) encoded by a unique genomic sequence of
MTB, which is absent from M. bovis BCG and the majority of opportunistic mycobacteria. These proteins are the main targets for IFNγ-secreting
T lymphocytes in individuals infected with MTB. These tests have several
advantages over the tuberculin skin test: no return visit for test reading is
required, the result is available the next day, and repeated testing does not
cause boosting. With both tests, blood must be collected in a heparinized
tube, and processed within 6–8 h of venepuncture. The blood should be
transferred to the laboratory at room temperature. Validation of these
new tests has been difﬁcult in the absence of a gold standard, although
data suggest that the T-SPOT.TB test is more sensitive for the diagnosis
of latent TB than the tuberculin skin test, particularly in children and HIVpositive individuals, and is probably more sensitive than the QuantiFERON
test in the diagnosis of active TB.

Latent infection versus active disease
It is important to differentiate between active and latent disease.
Active disease is a positive skin test (usually), abnormal CXR, and symptoms.
Latent infection (small numbers of bacilli present) is usually treated with
chemoprophylaxis (see below). Treatment of latent TB reduces the risk of
subsequent development of active disease by about 90%.
HIV infection The tuberculin skin test may be falsely negative, and radiological changes may be atypical. Current guidelines recommend close
monitoring and no chemoprophylaxis, because of the difﬁculties in identifying active from latent disease, and because of the risk of emergence of
resistant strains. Exposure to smear-positive disease should lead to chemoprophylaxis in the absence of clinical disease. Recommended follow-up
is at 3 and 12 months for those not receiving chemophrophylaxis (but
who were eligible for it).

LATENT TB INFECTION

HIV-positive patients should receive long-term follow-up as part of their
ongoing HIV management.

Chemoprophylaxis is given to contacts with strongly positive Heaf
reactions, who have no radiological or clinical evidence of active disease.
The risk of developing disease after exposure depends on a number of
factors, including BCG and HIV/immune status, and whether infection was
recent. Younger patients must have had relatively recent infection, and
have a longer life expectancy from which to gain the beneﬁts of chemoprophylaxis. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for:
• Those with recent documented tuberculin conversion
• HIV-infected contacts of smear-positive cases
• Children aged <16 with a strongly positive Heaf (grade 2–4 if no prior
BCG, grade 3–4 if prior BCG)
• Individuals with HIV, injecting drugs, with haematological malignancy,
chronic renal failure or on dialysis, with silicosis, gastrectomy, solid
organ transplant or receiving anti-TNFA therapy have a higher risk of
developing active TB
Drug regimes
• Rifampicin and isoniazid daily for 3 months (3RH). Best compliance, but
slightly higher side-effect proﬁle
• Isoniazid daily for 6 months (6H). Lowest toxicity regime. Has a 60–90%
effectiveness in reducing progression of latent infection to clinical
disease
• 6H is recommended for people with HIV
• 6R is recommended for contacts of patients with isoniazid resistant
disease
• Individuals who decline chemoprophylaxis should be given the ‘Inform
and advise’ information leaﬂet, and have a CXR at 3 and 12 months.

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

TB and anti-TNFA treatment
Humanized monoclonal anti-TNFA antibody has recently been approved
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn’s disease, psoriatic arthropathy, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Etanercept (Enbrel) is a
fusion protein that binds free TNFA using a soluble portion of the TNFA
receptor, and is licensed for use in rheumatoid arthritis. Adalimumab
(Humira) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against TNFA,
also licensed for use in RA. Inﬂiximab (Remicade) is a human chimera
monoclonal antibody, licensed for the treatment of RA, Crohn’s disease,
and ankylosing spondylitis.
These drugs cause profound immunosuppression, and patients treated
with them have an increased risk of developing TB. Most TB cases have
been seen with inﬂiximab (242 at time of publication), with most occurring
within three treatment cycles (within a mean of 12 weeks of starting treatment). TB is the most frequently described opportunistic infection in this
context. 50% of the reported cases are extrapulmonary disease. The initial
high incidence of cases has now plateaued, presumably due to improved
assessment and awareness and the use of isoniazid chemoprophylaxis. The
calculated TB prevalence in etanercept/inﬂiximab-treated RA patients in
America is 41 per 100 000, 9 per 100 000 for Crohn’s disease. Overall,
there is an average 5-fold increased risk of developing TB with anti-TNFA.
All patients due to start anti-TNFA antibody treatment should
be screened for active and latent TB
• All patients should have a clinical examination, with history of previous
TB treatment and exposure carefully documented. All should have a
CXR and tuberculin test
• Those with an abnormal CXR consistent with previous TB or those
who have a history of extrapulmonary TB, who have received adequate
treatment (as assessed by an expert), can start anti-TNFA therapy, but
need monitoring every 3 months with a CXR and symptom assessment.
The onset of any new respiratory symptoms, especially within 3 months
of starting anti-TNFA therapy, should be investigated promptly
• Those with an abnormal CXR consistent with previous TB or those
who have a prior history of extrapulmonary TB, who have NOT had
adequate treatment, need to have active tuberculosis excluded by
appropriate investigations. They should receive chemoprophylaxis
before anti-TNFA therapy commences (assuming active disease is not
identiﬁed). If there is clinical concern because of the delay in starting
anti-TNFA treatment, a shorter course of chemoprophylaxis can be
given, but this may be more toxic
• Any TB diagnosed (pulmonary or extra-pulmonary) should be treated
with standard chemotherapy
• If active TB is present, patients should receive a minimum of 2 months
anti-TB chemotherapy before starting anti-TNFA therapy
• If the CXR is normal, the tuberculin test may be helpful if the patient
is not on immunosuppressants, and must be interpreted knowing the
BCG history. A tuberculin skin test is unhelpful if the patient is on
immunosuppressants. In this situation, an individual assessment should
be made: if the risk of drug-induced hepatitis is less than the annual risk
of developing TB, chemoprophylaxis should be given. However, if the

TB AND ANTI-TNFA TREATMENT

risk of hepatitis is greater, the patient should be monitored regularly
and any suggestive symptoms investigated promptly. See Table 42.6
No chemoprophylaxis regime is 100% effective: the protective efﬁcacy
of 6H is reported at 60 and 50% for 3HR
In those without previous BCG, Heaf grades 0–1 (Mantoux 1 in 10 000,
0–5 mm) are negative, and Heaf grades 2–4 (Mantoux 1 in 10 000, >6
mm) are positive and should lead to a risk assessment
In those with prior BCG, Heaf grades 0–2 (Mantoux 1 in 10 000, 0–14
mm) are negative, and Heaf grades 3–4 (Mantoux 1 in 10 000, >15 mm)
may represent either latent infection or BCG effect, and therefore need
further investigation
In general, all black African patients aged >15 and all South Asians born
outside the UK should be considered for chemoprophylaxis with
6 months isoniazid
If a patient develops TB, whilst on anti-TNFA therapy, treat with the full
standard course of antituberculous chemotherapy. The anti-TNFA can
be continued if indicated
Close liaison between the prescriber of the TNFA antibody treatment
and TB specialists is needed.

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

TB: screening and contact tracing
Immigrant screening Immigrants are screened, as ethnic minority
groups in the UK constitute 50% of TB cases. New entrants are screened
at port of arrival. The incidence of TB is highest in the ﬁrst few years
after arrival to the UK. Return visits to countries with a high background
prevalence are a risk factor for acquiring disease. Immigrants with symptoms suggestive of TB, and those who are asymptomatic with a grade 3 or
4 tuberculin skin test, should be referred to the local chest clinic for CXR
and assessment. BCG vaccination is recommended for tuberculin-negative
immigrants (but not in those who are HIV-positive, because of the risk of
generalized BCG infection).
Contact tracing identiﬁes those with TB, and those who are infected
but without evidence of disease. It also identiﬁes those suitable for BCG
vaccination.
Close contacts are usually those within the same household, sharing
kitchen facilities, and frequent household visitors.
Casual contacts usually include most occupational contacts. Examination is
usually only needed if the index case was smear-positive, or if the contacts
are at high risk. This also applies if more than 10% of the close contacts
have been infected, i.e. the index case is considered highly infectious.
• 10% of TB is diagnosed by contact tracing, with disease occurring in
about 1% of contacts
• Smear-negative patients are much less infectious, but contact tracing is
still recommended in these patients
• Contacts should be traced for the period the index case has been
infectious, or for 3 months prior to the ﬁrst positive sputum or culture,
if the time period is uncertain
• Most disease in contacts is found at the ﬁrst screening visit
• Subjects should be advised to report suspicious symptoms
• Follow-up is recommended at 3 and 12 months for those not receiving
chemoprophylaxis.
• School index cases. If a pupil is diagnosed with smear-positive TB, the
rest of the class and year group who share classes should be assessed
as part of routine contact tracing. If a school teacher is diagnosed with
smear-positive TB, the pupils in their class during the previous 3 months
should be assessed as part of routine contact tracing. The extension
of contact tracing to include non-teaching staff etc. will depend on the
infectivity and proximity of the index case, and whether the contacts
are likely to be especially susceptible to infection.
Airplane transmission Transmission rates are low, even on long haul
ﬂights. Contract tracing of passengers and crew is only necessary if the
index case was smear-positive and coughing during a ﬂight of at least
8 h. In this situation, screening is only recommended in those at high
risk—immunocompromised travellers and children, or if the index case
was unusually infectious or had MDR-TB.

TB: SCREENING AND CONTACT TRACING

M. bovis Cattle TB is due to M. bovis. Humans are at low risk, as the
majority of milk consumed is pasteurized. M. bovis is distinguishable from
M. tuberculosis in the laboratory, although initial diagnosis can be difﬁcult
(only distinguishable on culture, not using DNA or RNA testing). Around
40 cases are isolated per year. BCG is live attenuated M. bovis.
Extrapulmonary disease Contact screening is not recommended.
Contact examination This usually involves symptom enquiry, BCG vaccination status, Mantoux test, and CXR.
Contacts of smear-positive index case If symptoms are present, and if
the contact was not previously vaccinated, those with negative Mantoux
should be retested after 6 weeks to allow for tuberculin conversion.
If retesting is not possible, give BCG after the ﬁrst negative Mantoux.
HIV-infected contacts CXR is indicated, as a negative Mantoux test may
be due to anergy, and may therefore be a false negative. Mantoux testing
is not contraindicated in HIV (PPD is dead). BCG is contraindicated (it is
a live vaccine).
BCG vaccination
The UK national schools’ vaccination programme ceased in 2005 and
now aims to target vaccination to selected ‘at risk’ groups. Vaccination is
offered to:
• All infants whose parents or grandparents originate from a country
with a TB incidence of 40/100 000 or higher, or those living in areas
with a TB incidence of 40/100 000 or higher
• All Mantoux-negative contacts of patients with respiratory TB, if they
are previously unvaccinated and aged <35 years. Laboratory and health
care workers who are contacts meeting the same criteria should be
vaccinated if they are aged >36.
• All Mantoux-negative new entrants from high-incidence countries if
previously unvaccinated, if aged <16. If originating from sub-Saharan
Africa or a country with a TB incidence of 500 per 100 000, those aged
16 to 35 should also be offered vaccination
• All Mantoux–negative health care workers, irrespective of age, who
are previously unvaccinated and who will be exposed to patients and
clinical materials
• Mantoux-negative, previously unvaccinated individuals aged <35, if
potentially at risk of TB exposure because of their occupation,
including veterinary and abattoir workers, prison staff, staff in care
homes for the elderly, staff of accommodation for refugees and the
homeless, and those going to work in a high-incidence country for
more than one month
• BCG has an efﬁcacy of around 70% against TB in children, but difﬁculties with vaccine supply and regional policies have meant that not all
children in the UK have been vaccinated in the past. It is less effective in
adults, and is not used in America
• Adverse events include pain and suppuration at the injection site, and
localized lymphadenitis. A course of rifampicin and/or isoniazid for
3–6 months, depending on response, may be needed

515

516

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

Disseminated BCG infection (BCGosis)
Live attenuated BCG immunotherapy is the most effective intravesical
agent for the treatment and prophylaxis of superﬁcial bladder cancer.
It prevents tumour recurrence and prolongs disease-free survival, and may
be more effective than chemotherapy in this setting. BCG can penetrate
deep within the detrusor muscle and has been identiﬁed in pelvic lymph
nodes after instillation, so has a potentially much longer duration of action
than standard intravesical chemotherapy. BCG leads to a T-cell-mediated
immune response, which has anti-tumour activity. After intravesical instillation, live mycobacteria attach to the urothelial lining. BCG organisms
are internalized by bladder epithelial cells, leaving bacterial cell surface
glycoproteins attached to the epithelial cell membrane. These antigens are
thought to mediate the immune response.
• The standard treatment regime is 6 weekly instillations of 100 million
to 1 billion colony-forming units of BCG (cfu). Some advocate a further
3-week course, 6 weeks after cessation of the ﬁrst cycle. The dose–
response curve is bell shaped, with excess BCG probably promoting
increased tumour activity
• Local side-effects are common, with cystitis reported in around 90% of
patients; low-grade fever and malaise are frequent. Cystitis persisting
>48 h after treatment should be treated with a ﬂuoroquinolone or isoniazid 300 mg od, rifampicin 600 mg od should be added if the
symptoms persist at one week
• Breaks in the uro-epithelium are a risk factor for systemic infection, and
therefore patients with persistent cystitis or haematuria should have
their treatment delayed
• Signiﬁcant reactions are reported in around 5%, with high fever commonest. A high fever post treatment (>39°C) may represent the onset
of systemic BCG infection or hypersensitivity, and hospital admission is
recommended
• BCG sepsis is reported in around 0.4–0.7%, with 10 deaths attributed
to intravesical BCG to date. The major differential diagnosis is Gramnegative sepsis; thus patients should be treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics
• Later onset symptoms (at up to 8–12 weeks, though may occur much
earlier) including fever, malaise, arthralgia, and breathlessness may
represent systemic BCG infection, though there is debate as to
whether these sorts of systemic symptoms are due to systemic BCG
infection or hypersensitivity to BCG. Non-caseating granulomas can
be identiﬁed on lung and liver biopsy. Culture of organisms is rarely
reported, but tissue M. bovis can be identiﬁed by PCR
• Disseminated infection—treat with rifampicin 600 mg od and isoniazid
300 mg od for 6 months. Some advocate the addition of ethambutol.
Prednisolone 40 mg od may be added, and response to corticosteroids
is said to support the diagnosis of hypersensitivity. There are no trial
data to support these treatment regimes or length of treatment, but
M. bovis is susceptible to most anti-TB drugs, except pyrazinamide
and cycloserine. There is no evidence that isoniazid reduces the antitumour effects of BCG

DISSEMINATED BCG INFECTION (BCG OSIS )

• BCG hypersensitivity pneumonits is suggested by pulmonary inﬁltrates;
micronodular and miliary appearances are reported with or without
eosinophilia
• Granulomatous hepatitis is reported. Standard TB treatment (6 months)
is suggested, with prednisolone if symptoms of hypersensitivity
predominate
• Systemic BCG infection is reported in HIV-positive infants and infants
with severe immune deﬁciency, undiagnosed at the time of BCG
vaccination. Systemic BCG infection is reported after BCG injection
into melanoma.

Future developments in TB
• New TB vaccine (MVA85A)—heterogolous prime boost immunization
regimes have been shown to induce higher levels of cellular immunity
than homologous boosting with the same vaccine. Initial data on a BCG
prime-recombinant modiﬁed vaccinia virus Ankara, expressing Ag 85A,
are promising. This is now in clinical trials in the UK and Africa. The TB
Vaccine Cluster Project (EU funded) aims to provide novel vaccines for
human use, and boost BCG effect using modiﬁed BCG.
• Compound R207910 is a new antibiotic which has shown in vitro antiTB activity in mice models
• Nebulized gamma interferon used in the USA as additional treatment
in MDR-TB in those failing multiple agent chemotherapy.

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)
NTM is also called atypical mycobacteria, opportunistic mycobacteria, environmental mycobacteria, mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT).

Aetiology
• Found in the environment: in soil, water (including tap water), dust,
milk, animals, and birds
• Many different species. The four most important are Mycobacterium
avium complex (MAC), Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium malmoense, and Mycobacterium xenopi
• They are low-grade pathogens in humans
• Most commonly cause pulmonary infections in middle-aged and older
adults, and in those with pre-existing lung disease, such as bronchiectasis, CF, emphysema, or old healed TB, or in immunodeﬁciency
• Disseminated infection may occur, especially in the immunocompromised
• Lymphadenitis typically occurs in children aged 1–5 years. This presents
with enlarged non-tender cervical lymph nodes and a normal CXR.
The node should be surgically resected. Antibiotic treatment is only
required if there is recurrence. Large nodes may need antituberculous
chemotherapy to shrink the node prior to resection
• Local invasion may occur from skin lesion (e.g. M. marinum, M. ulcerans,
M. fortuitum, M. abscessus, M. chelonae, M. avium complex).

Clinical features The symptoms are generally non-speciﬁc, hence the
difﬁculty in diagnosis.
• Sub-acute illness with weight loss, productive cough, dyspnoea, fever,
and occasionally haemoptysis
• May present in a patient with known underlying lung disease, such as
COPD, in whom disease progression is atypical
• Colonization of abnormal lung may not cause symptoms, but can
progress to cause disease later
• May be similar to symptoms caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
• ‘Lady Windermere syndrome’ is habitual voluntary cough suppression, which may lead to failure to clear airway secretions, predisposing
to lingula or RML consolidation, bronchiectasis, and MAC infection.
Found in otherwise healthy middle-aged women (Reich JM, Chest
1992;101:1605–9).

Investigations
• CXR can be indistinguishable from that of MTB, with upper zone inﬁltrate with cavitation. Airway nodularity and associated bronchiectasis
are recognized. The CXR may be difﬁcult to interpret in the presence
of pre-existing lung disease. HRCT may help. It is impossible to identify which atypical mycobacterium is causing infection from the CXR
appearance

NON-TUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA

• Sputum samples Microbiology for ZN stain, culture, and further
testing. If there is growth of an atypical acid-fast bacillus:
• Where was the isolate from? Culture from lung biopsy, BAL, pleural
ﬂuid, or blood culture is more signiﬁcant than culture from sputum
• What is the isolate and what is the degree of growth?
• How many samples have been positive?
• A single isolate from a non-sterile site may not be signiﬁcant.
Contamination can occur, especially from bronchoscopes when BAL
is performed. Multiple isolates (>2) from non-sterile sites are needed
to establish disease, or >1 from a sterile site, especially if there is supportive histopathology. Liaise with microbiologists to help to determine
the signiﬁcance of a positive result
• May need lung biopsy to help differentiate
• No skin test is available.

Diagnosis Pulmonary disease is likely if:
• CXR is suggestive and 3 or more positive sputum cultures are obtained
1 week apart, with or without symptoms
• Or 1 positive culture from a sterile site, such as pleural ﬂuid or biopsy
• Or 2 positive cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage on separate occasions.
In the UK, pulmonary infection is most commonly caused by Mycobacterium
kansasii, Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium malmoense, and
Mycobacterium xenopi.

CHAPTER 42

Respiratory infection: mycobacterial

NTM: management
• The decision to treat is based on the likelihood of active infection
• No need to notify or contact trace as there is low risk of cross-infection
• De-notify if the MTB grown turns out to be an atypical mycobacterium,
and change treatment accordingly
• Treatment considerations according to BTS guidelines:
• M. kansasii—progresses without treatment. Treat with rifampicin
and ethambutol for a minimum of 9 months. A longer treatment
period is required if immunocompromised (2 years or until sputum
is clear of infection for 12 months). Good response to treatment.
Indeﬁnite treatment if non-compliant. 100% response rate, >90%
5-year cure, with <10% relapse with full compliance
• M. avium complex (MAC)—may be asymptomatic. Can be antibiotic
resistant. Treat with triple therapy: rifampicin with ethambutol with
or without isoniazid for 2 years. 50% response rate and 20% relapse
rate. Clarithromycin or azithromycin may be effective
• M. malmoense—treat with ethambutol and rifampicin for 18–24 months
• M. xenopi—often resistant. Disease may progress despite treatment.
Treat with ethambutol, isoniazid, and rifampicin for at least 2 years
• M. malmoense, and M. xenopi—90% response rate, and 10% relapse
rate at 2 years.
It is recognized that laboratory antibiotic sensitivities and resistance may
not correlate with the clinical therapeutic response. Antibiotic choice is
best judged on clinical response.

HIV is a risk factor for NTM
Mycobacterium avium complex is the cause of infection in 90% of cases
Infections may occur late in the disease, when CD4 count <50
Infections may develop during the ﬁrst 2 months of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART)
Disease is rarely conﬁned to the lungs. Lymphadenitis and disseminated
infection are recognized
Lung disease causes similar symptoms to those seen in the non-immunocompromised
CXR shows diffuse interstitial, reticulonodular, or alveolar inﬁltrates
A single isolate may represent colonization
If an organism is repeatedly isolated in the presence of symptoms and/
or an abnormal CXR, start treatment
Lifelong antibiotic treatment is recommended for pulmonary or disseminated disease, with a 3–4 drug regimen
Disseminated MAC incidence is decreased by antibiotic prophylaxis
(with azithromycin weekly) and HAART restoring immunocompetence
There are potential drug interactions between rifampicin, macrolides,
and protease inhibitors and NNRTIs.

CHAPTER 43

Respiratory infection: parasitic

A wide variety of parasitic organisms may infect the lungs, although clinical
disease is rare in the UK. In general, parasites may cause lung disease by
two different mechanisms:
• Hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. Löfﬂer’s syndrome and eosinophilic lung
disease, most commonly from helminths such as Ascaris, Toxocara, and
liver ﬂukes
• Direct infection and invasion, e.g. amoebic disease, pulmonary hydatid
disease.
Some of the more important examples are noted below.

Pulmonary hydatid disease
• Hydatidosis is the commonest parasitic lung disease worldwide
• Human infection follows ingestion of parasite eggs, with the adult worm
found in dogs, sheep, goats, horses, camels, and moose; infection is
common in sheep-raising regions, particularly Central Europe and the
Mediterranean, as well as Alaska and Arctic Canada
• Two main forms:
• Echinococcus granulosus, which causes cystic hydatid disease as the
larvae grow in the lungs. Common. Symptoms include cough (sometimes productive of cyst contents, ‘hydatidoptysis’), haemoptysis,
and chest pain. CXR shows rounded cysts, sometimes with calciﬁed
walls, most commonly in lower lobes; CT may show ‘daughter cysts’.
Cyst rupture may occur, with wheeze, eosinophilia, and bronchial or
pleural spread
• Echinococcus multilocularis, which leads to alveolar hydatid disease
following tissue invasion. Rare. Lung masses are less clearly delineated on CT than in cystic disease
• Diagnose from serology or sputum analysis. Serology is insensitive
for the diagnosis of pulmonary disease (around 50%). Demonstration
of liver cysts supports the diagnosis. Avoid needle aspiration of cysts,
which may result in hypersensitivity or dissemination
• Treatment is with surgical excision in most cases. Medical treatment
with albendazole if the patient is unﬁt for surgery or following cyst
rupture and dissemination.

STRONGYLOIDIASIS

Amoebic pulmonary disease
• Intestinal and liver infection is common, with lung involvement in a
minority
• Lung disease can develop either directly from the liver or via the bloodstream or lymphatics
• Pulmonary manifestations include right lower lobe consolidation,
empyema, lung abscess, or hepatobronchial ﬁstulae (resulting in large
volumes of brown or ‘anchovy’ sputum). May be associated pericardial
disease
• Diagnose using serology or following identiﬁcation of trophozoites in
stool, sputum, or pleural ﬂuid
• Treatment is with metronidazole plus iodoquinol or diloxanide.

Pulmonary ascariasis
• Distributed worldwide
• Lung involvement occurs during maturation of Ascaris lumbricoides, and
is typically manifest as a hypersensitivity reaction with cough, wheeze,
fever, CXR inﬁltrates, and peripheral eosinophilia
• Examination of stool for eggs may conﬁrm the diagnosis
• Usually resolves spontaneously after 1–2 weeks. Consider treatment
with mebendazole for gastrointestinal infection.

Strongyloidiasis
• Caused by Strongyloides stercoralis, found in Central and South America
and Africa
• Pulmonary involvement may lead to a Löfﬂer-type syndrome with
wheeze, skin rash, eosinophilia, and CXR inﬁltrate. In the setting of
immunocompromise, disseminated infection may occur leading to the
‘hyperinfection syndrome’. ARDS may develop, and secondary bacterial
sepsis is common
• Diagnose using serology or following microbiological analysis of stool
or duodenal ﬂuid
• Treatment is with thiabendazole.

525

526

CHAPTER 43

Respiratory infection: parasitic

Toxocariasis
• Caused by Toxocara canis, distributed worldwide. Dogs are the primary
host
• Ingestion of eggs from contaminated soil may result in visceral larva
migrans. Migration of larvae through the lungs results in an immune
response, with wheeze, cough, and eosinophilia
• Diagnosis may be made from serology
• Treatment often not required; steroids may be beneﬁcial in severe
cases.

Diroﬁlariasis
• Found in USA, Japan, South America
• Infection is caused by Diroﬁlaria immitis following mosquito transfer
from animals, especially dogs. Worms lodge in the pulmonary arteries
and elicit an inﬂammatory response, leading to a necrotic nodule
• Presentation is classically asymptomatic with a single peripheral nodule
on CXR, mimicking cancer. Patients may present with cough, chest pain,
and haemoptysis, presumably due to pulmonary infarction
• Deﬁnitive diagnosis requires lung biopsy. Serology lacks sensitivity and
speciﬁcity
• Treatment is not usually needed.

Schistosomiasis
• Found in the Middle East, South America, South-east Asia, Africa, and
the Caribbean
• Schistosoma species are carried by snails, and infection follows skin
penetration, often during swimming
• Pulmonary involvement may reﬂect acute tissue migration, causing
cough, wheeze, and CXR inﬁltrates, or chronic infection, leading to
interstitial inﬁltrates, pulmonary hypertension, or AV ﬁstulae
• Diagnosis from observation of ova in sputum, BAL, urine, or stool, or
from lung biopsy
• Treatment is with praziquantel.

TROPICAL PULMONARY EOSINOPHILIA

Paragonimiasis
• Caused by Paragonimus westermani, distributed in West Africa, the Far
East, India, and Central and South America
• Following ingestion, ﬂukes migrate to the lung or pleura. Clinical features may be acute or chronic, and include chest pain, pneumothorax,
pleural effusion, Löfﬂer’s syndrome, and recurrent haemoptysis. Serum
eosinophilia is common
• Diagnose with serology or observation of eggs in sputum, TBB, BAL, or
pleural ﬂuid
• Treatment is with praziquantel.

Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia
• Follows infection with Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi in the
tropics
• Pulmonary involvement is common and represents a hypersensitivity
reaction to the organism, with cough, wheeze, CXR inﬁltrates, and
raised serum IgE
• Treatment is with diethylcarbamazine.

CHAPTER 44

Respiratory infection: viral

Viral pneumonia: overview
• Viral upper respiratory tract infections are common, but typically selflimiting, and are usually managed in the community. Viral pneumonia
is much less common but is more serious and usually requires
hospitalization. Viral pneumonia in the immunocompetent is rare
and typically affects children or the elderly; inﬂuenza strains are the
commonest cause in adults
• Viruses may cause serious respiratory infection in the immunocompromised (particularly patients with depressed T-cell function, e.g. following
organ transplantation). CMV is the commonest serious viral pathogen
that affects immunocompromised patients. Inﬂuenza, parainﬂuenza,
RSV, measles, and adenovirus may also cause pneumonia in the immunocompromised, although diagnosis of these viruses is difﬁcult and
infection is commonly undetected
• The clinical and radiological features of viral pneumonia are nonspeciﬁc. Worsening cough and breathlessness following an upper respiratory tract infection suggest the development of pneumonia; wheeze
may accompany bronchiolitis. CXR typically shows non-speciﬁc diffuse
interstitial inﬁltrates, and hypoxia may occur. Secondary bacterial infection may complicate viral pneumonia
• A variety of diagnostic techniques are available, including viral culture
and immunoﬂuorescence staining (e.g. of BAL ﬂuid) and serology
• Treatment consists of supportive care and in some cases antivirals.
Infection with certain viruses may require isolation. Treat secondary
bacterial infection with antibiotics
• Speciﬁc features of the common and/or important viruses are noted in
the remainder of the chapter.

CHAPTER 44

Respiratory infection: viral

Inﬂuenza: diagnosis
• Commonest cause of viral pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. It
is transmitted via respiratory secretions and is extremely contagious.
Seasonal inﬂuenza is very well recognized in the UK, particularly during
the winter months, and recently outbreaks of H5N1 avian inﬂuenza
have occurred in many countries, raising fears of the development of
sustained human-to-human transmission and a new global pandemic
• Three pathogenic serotypes: A, B, and C. Type A causes more severe
disease and occurs in annual epidemics and intermittent pandemics.
Types B and C cause epidemics
• The surface antigens haemagglutinin and neuraminidase determine
inﬂuenza serotype. Genetic mutations may result in antigenic shifts
(major genetic rearrangements between strains, associated with pandemics) and antigenic drifts (more minor genetic variations associated
with epidemics). Genetic rearrangement of virus occurs in animal and
bird reservoirs, and the virus may then be transferred to humans
• Seasonal inﬂuenza may affect previously well individuals, although
it occurs more commonly in the elderly, particularly in the setting
of chronic heart or lung disease or immunocompromise. Pandemic
inﬂuenza differs in that it is also associated with signiﬁcant mortality in
younger adults.
Regularly updated information on seasonal, avian, and pandemic inﬂuenza
is available from the Health Protection Agency website:
http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/inﬂuenza
Additional guidelines are available for the management of suspected
inﬂuenza in the setting of a pandemic with UK Pandemic Alert Level 2
(cases of pandemic inﬂuenza identiﬁed in UK):
http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/PandemicFlu.html
http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/PandemicFlu/index.htm

Clinical and laboratory features Incubation period typically 1–4 days;
adults contagious for 7 days and children for 21 days from illness onset. The
clinical picture following infection is variable and may be inﬂuenced in part
by the inﬂuenza subtype. Features include:
• Asymptomatic infection
• ‘Flu’ (acute onset of fever, cough, headache, coryzal symptoms, myalgia,
sore throat)
• Complications include:
• Bronchitis/bronchiolitis
• Primary inﬂuenza viral pneumonia (onset typically within 48 h
of initial fever; cough dry or productive, haemoptysis may occur,
bilateral crackles and/or wheeze; may progress very rapidly to respiratory failure and death; described in majority of patients infected
with avian inﬂuenza H5N1, often associated with lymphopenia,
thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function, and multi-organ failure)

INFLUENZA: DIAGNOSIS

• Secondary bacterial pneumonia (signiﬁcantly more common
than viral pneumonia; onset typically 4–5 days after initial fever,
during early convalescence, although may occur earlier; pathogens
include S. pneumoniae, S. aureus—particularly associated with lung
abscess—and H. inﬂuenzae; mixed bacterial/viral pneumonia may
occur)
• Gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. watery diarrhoea; more frequently
described during avian inﬂuenza A H5N1 than seasonal infection)
• Otitis media (particularly in children), conjunctivitis; rarely parotitis
• Myositis (creatine kinase may be elevated; rarely myoglobinuria with
renal failure)
• Neurological (encephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, transverse myelitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome all rare; Reye’s syndrome
with encephalopathy and fatty liver following aspirin use is well
described in children and adolescents)
• Cardiovascular (ECG abnormalities common, myocarditis or pericarditis rare).

Imaging
• CXR typically shows bilateral mid-zone interstitial inﬁltrates in primary
viral pneumonia, although focal consolidation is also well described.
Lobar consolidation occurs in secondary bacterial pneumonia.

Differential diagnosis of ‘ﬂu-like’ illness includes adenovirus, RSV,
rhinovirus, parainﬂuenza, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella, Mycoplasma,
and S. pneumoniae. A very high fever is said to favour a diagnosis of
inﬂuenza. Consider SARS (p 542) in patients with an appropriate travel
history.
Diagnosis is often suggested by knowledge of a local outbreak. Diagnostic
investigations include:
• Virology (not routinely required if pandemic established with widespread infection across the UK—Alert Level 4—when diagnosis will be
clinical)
• Presentation <7 days after illness onset: nose and throat swabs in
virus transport medium (for direct immunoﬂuorescence, ELISA,
virus culture, and/or PCR)
• Presentation >7 days after illness onset: ‘acute’ serum and subsequently ‘convalescent’ serum after 7 days (for inﬂuenza serological
testing)
• Bacteriology (in patients with inﬂuenza-related pneumonia)
• Blood culture
• Pneumococcal and Legionella urinary antigen
• Sputum M,C&S (if purulent sputum and either no prior antibiotics
or failure to respond to empirical antibiotics)
• ‘Acute’ serum and subsequently ‘convalescent’ serum after 7 days
for inﬂuenza/other agents serological testing

533

534

CHAPTER 44

Respiratory infection: viral

Inﬂuenza: management
Severity assessment
• Patients with uncomplicated inﬂuenza do not require admission
• For inﬂuenza-related pneumonia, a CURB-65 score (p 424) of ≥3 indicates severe pneumonia and a high risk of death; patients with a score
of 0 or 1 may be considered for home treatment
• Bilateral CXR inﬁltrates consistent with primary viral pneumonia
should be considered as severe pneumonia, irrespective of CURB65 score.

Infection control
• Outside the setting of a UK pandemic, most suspected cases of inﬂuenza
are likely to be seasonal, although H5N1 avian inﬂuenza should be
seriously considered in patients with:
• Fever or history of fever and breathlessness or cough
• and travel in the previous 2 weeks to a region known to have cases
of H5N1 in birds (e.g. China, Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam,
many more; see Health Protection Agency website on p x for
updated list)
• and close contact (within 1 m) with live or dead poultry (not meat
or eggs) or other H5N1-conﬁrmed animal (e.g. pigs) within 7 days
of symptom onset
• Consider also in patients with febrile respiratory illness and contact
with sick, dying, or dead poultry in absence of travel history, and in
health care and laboratory workers with exposure to conﬁrmed or
possible avian inﬂuenza cases
In such cases, the patient should be assessed either at their home or in a
hospital side-room, with both patient and staff wearing surgical masks and
staff wearing gown and gloves. Immediately inform local Health Protection
Unit, as well as hospital infection control and occupational health. If hospitalization is required, patients should be in strict respiratory isolation,
preferably in a negative pressure room (although patients should not
be transferred for this reason alone), and staff should wear high ﬁltration mask (FFP3), gown, gloves, and eye protection (consider also cap and
plastic apron, depending on situation). Mark all laboratory samples as ‘high
risk’ and inform local laboratory of the sample status.

Treatment
• Supportive care: oxygen, intravenous ﬂuids, nutritional support.
Consider ITU/HDU admission for patients with one of more of:
primary viral pneumonia; CURB-65 score of 4 or 5; PaO2 <8 Kpa
despite high-ﬂow oxygen; progressive hypercapnia; pH <7.26; septic
shock. NIV may be used for patients with COPD and decompensated
type II respiratory failure, although infection control measures should
be in place and protective equipment worn by staff to minimize any
spread of infection from respiratory droplets

INFLUENZA: MANAGEMENT

• Antiviral treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors is indicated for
patients with an inﬂuenza-like illness and fever >38°C within 48 h of
symptom onset; consider also treating immunocompromised or very
elderly patients in the absence of fever, and severely ill or immunocompromised patients if >48 h from disease onset. Treat with oseltamivir
(Tamiﬂu) 75 mg bd for 5 days (75 mg od if creatinine clearance
<30 ml/min); anti-emetics may be needed for nausea. Antivirals appear
to reduce illness duration (by 1 day), hospitalization, and subsequent
antibiotic requirements; possible effects on mortality have not been
adequately studied, and the efﬁcacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in pandemic inﬂuenza is unknown. The neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir may
be given intravenously (e.g. for ventilated patients), but its effectiveness
in this situation is unproven. Antiviral prophylaxis may be considered
for health care workers caring for patients with suspected avian inﬂuenza, as well as the patient’s household contacts
• Treat inﬂuenza-related pneumonia with antibiotics according to
severity, e.g. oral co-amoxiclav, a tetracycline (e.g. doxycycline), or a
macrolide if non-severe; intravenous co-amoxiclav or cefuroxime or
cefotaxime together with a macrolide if severe.

Outcome Uncomplicated inﬂuenza typically resolves within 7 days, although
cough and malaise may persist for several weeks. The reported mortality
from primary inﬂuenza viral pneumonia is >40% and up to 24% from secondary bacterial pneumonia.
Vaccination
• The inﬂuenza inactivated vaccine is modiﬁed annually based on recent
viral strains, and provides partial protection against inﬂuenza illness,
hospitalization, and death. Vaccination if age >65, chronic comorbidity,
nursing home residents, or health workers. Vaccination will not protect
against H5N1 avian inﬂuenza, but may make simultaneous co-infection
with human and avian inﬂuenza less likely, and so reduce the likelihood
of viral genetic re-assortment
• Administration of oseltamivir 75 mg od to high-risk individuals
throughout periods of exposure may also prevent infection
• Live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccines are currently under investigation.

535

536

CHAPTER 44

Respiratory infection: viral

Cytomegalovirus pneumonia
Epidemiology
• CMV is the commonest serious viral pathogen in the immunocompromised, and is a particular problem following transplantation, where
prophylaxis is now widely used
• Individuals are described as ‘seropositive’ for CMV if they have evidence
of IgG antibodies indicating latent infection following previous exposure; seropositivity increases with age. Infection in transplant recipients
results from either transmission from a CMV-positive donor to a CMV
antibody-negative recipient (via the organ or a blood transfusion) or
reactivation of latent CMV in a seropositive recipient as a result of
immunosuppression
• Infection occurs most frequently during the ﬁrst 4 months following
organ or bone marrow transplantation, corresponding to the period of
maximal T-cell suppression. Graft-versus-host disease increases the risk
of CMV infection.

Clinical and laboratory features
• ‘Flu-like’ symptoms in immunocompetent patients
• Symptoms of CMV pneumonia in the immunocompromised are nonspeciﬁc: fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and malaise
• Extrapulmonary manifestations of CMV infection (e.g. gastro-oesophagitis; hepatitis) may suggest the diagnosis
• Hypoxia may occur. Leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal liver
function tests are characteristic.

Imaging
• CXR typically bilateral diffuse interstitial inﬁltrate, although lobar
consolidation and localized haziness also described; can be normal.
A nodular inﬁltrate may suggest co-infection with Aspergillus
• CT features include localized or diffuse ground-glass and nodular
shadowing that may progress to airspace consolidation.

Diagnosis Antibody tests are used to estimate risk following transplantation, but diagnosis of active disease requires evidence of either viraemia
(by antigen or PCR testing of blood) or tissue invasion (by biopsy). A
wide range of diagnostic tests are available, and the choice of tests varies
between centres—discuss with your local virologist. The nature of the
transplant and immunosuppression also inﬂuence the interpretation of
test results. Methods include:
• Early antigen ﬂuorescence test on BAL ﬂuid (high sensitivity, low speciﬁcity)
• Qualitative PCR on blood or BAL ﬂuid (highly sensitive, but unable to
differentiate between latent and replicating CMV; negative result practically excludes the diagnosis, positive result is unhelpful)
• CMV antigenaemia on blood (rapid, differentiates between latent and
replicating virus)
• Quantitative PCR on blood or BAL ﬂuid (rapid, differentiates between
latent and replicating virus).

CYTOMEGALOVIRUS PNEUMONIA

• Indirect immunoﬂuorescence with monoclonal antibodies to CMV in
BAL ﬂuid (rapid, highly sensitive, and speciﬁc)
• Histology of lung tissue from transbronchial or surgical biopsies (demonstrate CMV inclusion bodies—the ‘owl’s eye’ appearance—within
infected cells; considered gold standard investigation).
In some cases a deﬁnitive diagnosis is not possible, and treatment is
empirical.

Treatment Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV bd for 2–4 weeks (side-effects include
neutropenia, anaemia). Consider additional treatment with anti-CMV
hyperimmune globulin or prolonged oral valganciclovir in cases of severe
or relapsed disease. Foscarnet 60 mg/kg tds for 2–3 weeks is an alternative
to ganciclovir for resistant cases, but toxicity (nephrotoxicity, metabolic
disturbance) can limit treatment.
Complications
• Opportunistic infection (e.g. PCP, aspergillosis) due to further suppression of T-cell function by the CMV infection itself
• Increased risk of organ rejection, as allografts are more susceptible to
CMV infection than native organs.

Outcome The reported mortality from CMV pneumonia varies, although
may be as high as 85%. Relapse occurs in up to one-third of patients.

537

538

CHAPTER 44

Respiratory infection: viral

Varicella pneumonia
• Pneumonia occurs in a small proportion of adults with chickenpox or
shingles. Risk factors for its development include smoking, increased
number of skin spots (>100), pregnancy (third trimester), steroid treatment, and immunocompromise
• There is typically a history of recent exposure to a contact infected
with chickenpox or shingles. Chest symptoms tend to occur several
days after the onset of rash (erythematous macules progressing to
papules and then vesicles), although rarely may precede the rash.
Cough and breathlessness are common, and pleuritic pain and haemoptysis may occur
• CXR typically shows a diffuse small nodular inﬁltrate; hilar lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions may uncommonly occur. Nodules may
subsequently calcify and persist
• Multi-organ involvement may occur
• Diagnosis is usually suspected on the basis of the history of exposure,
presence of rash, and CXR features. Cytological examination of smears
from skin lesions, serology, or viral culture or PCR on BAL ﬂuid may
conﬁrm the diagnosis
• Treatment of varicella pneumonia is with early administration of aciclovir 10–12.5 mg/kg, IV tds for 7–10 days. Aciclovir is not licensed for
use in pregnancy, but does not appear to be associated with increased
fetal abnormalities and the beneﬁts of treatment almost certainly
outweigh any risk. Varicella is very infectious until lesions enter the
‘crusting’ stage; in-patients should be isolated. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/life support has been used successfully in individuals
with fulminant respiratory failure. Consider early administration of varicella-zoster immune globulin for immunocompromised and pregnant
patients exposed to varicella
• Most cases resolve spontaneously, but a minority progress to respiratory failure and death. Mortality may be signiﬁcantly higher in pregnancy.

MEASLES

Respiratory syncytial virus
• Very common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children. Role
in adult respiratory disease is more signiﬁcant than previously appreciated, and infection often goes unrecognized
• Adult infection occurs particularly in the setting of underlying cardiac
or respiratory disease or malignancy; outbreaks affecting adults in hospitals and nursing homes also occur. RSV may be a relatively common
viral cause of pneumonia in patients who have recently undergone
bone marrow transplantation
• Bronchoscopy with BAL is often diagnostic: detection of RSV antigen in
BAL ﬂuid has a sensitivity of nearly 90%. PCR-based diagnostic
techniques and serological testing may have a role
• Bacterial superinfection may be a frequent complication
• Treatment is principally supportive. Role of aerosolized ribavirin and
steroids in the treatment of severe disease in adults is unclear. Reports
of successful outcomes in bone marrow transplant recipients following
treatment with ribavirin and immunoglobulin.

Measles
• Very rare in adults. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia affect 50% of patients
infected with measles and are a common cause of mortality in children
• Symptoms of fever and upper respiratory tract infection are followed
by a diffuse maculopapular rash. Leucopenia is common
• CXR may show reticulonodular inﬁltrates, hilar lymphadenopathy, and
pleural effusions
• Secondary bacterial infection is common
• Treatment is supportive. Treat secondary bacterial infection with
antibiotics.

539

540

CHAPTER 44

Respiratory infection: viral

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
• First described following an outbreak in the south-western USA in
1993. Several different hantaviruses (e.g. Sin Nombre virus) have been
associated with this syndrome. Previously described hantavirus-associated diseases occurred more commonly in Scandinavia and northeastern Asia, and tended to cause haemorrhagic fever and renal failure
with relative sparing of the lung
• Very rare, and affected individuals are almost exclusively from the USA,
particularly from the Four Corners Region where Arizona, Colorado,
Utah, and New Mexico meet
• Disease develops following inhalation of aerosolized viruses from
rodent faeces, urine, or saliva
• Typically affects previously well young adults
• Common presenting symptoms are fever, chills, cough, myalgia, and
gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting and abdominal pain.
Breathlessness occurs later in the disease course, and is often quickly
followed by respiratory failure and the development of ARDS. Shock
may occur and is associated with a poor prognosis
• Laboratory testing classically reveals neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia, sometimes renal impairment and mildly abnormal LFTs
• CXR typically shows initially bilateral basal inﬁltrates that progress to
involve all regions of the lung; a minority are normal
• Diagnosis may be conﬁrmed using serology, PCR for the virus, or by
detection of viral antigen using immunochemistry
• Treatment is supportive within an intensive care unit. It is unclear
if person-to-person transmission occurs, and patients should be in
respiratory isolation. Intravenous ribavirin is commonly administered,
although it is unclear if this improves outcome
• Mortality 30–50%, with death usually occurring within several days of
presentation

CHAPTER 44

Respiratory infection: viral

Severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS): epidemiology and
pathophysiology
This rapidly progressive acute respiratory illness was ﬁrst recognized in
November 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China. By late February
2003 it had spread internationally. It was termed SARS by the World
Health Organization (WHO), whose involvement was (in association with
health authorities from the United States, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong,
and other Asian countries) to determine an aetiology, establish infection
control measures to prevent further spread, establish a laboratory test for
diagnosis, and evaluate treatments.
Epidemiology Cases of SARS were ﬁrst recognized in the Guangdong
province of China in November 2002, with 792 cases reported by February
2003. This ﬁrst outbreak mainly affected health care workers and their
contacts. The disease spread to Hong Kong via a Guangdong province
physician, who infected individuals in a Hong Kong hotel lift. The disease
rapidly spread to Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Canada via travellers
from Guangdong province and Hong Kong. Case numbers fell by mid May
2003, and by July 2003 the worldwide epidemic had ended. Further cases
have subsequently been reported. An isolated case of laboratory-acquired
SARS was reported in Singapore in September 2003. A further laboratory
outbreak occurred in March 2004, with serologically proven infection in
four individuals working at the same institute in Beijing.
A total of 8098 cases were reported to the WHO by August 2003, with
774 deaths, giving a case fatality rate of 9.5%. The fatality rate for those aged
≥60 was 43%. 29 countries on all ﬁve continents were affected. 83% of the
worldwide cases were in China and Hong Kong. No deaths occurred in the
United States or the UK. 41 deaths (of 251 cases) were in Canada.
Case deﬁnition The WHO deﬁned criteria for those presenting with
the disease after July 2004:
• Fever >38*C plus
• One or more symptom of lower respiratory tract illness (cough,
difﬁculty breathing, shortness of breath) plus
• Radiographic evidence of lung inﬁltrate consistent with pneumonia or
ARDS, or autopsy ﬁndings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia
or ARDS without identiﬁable cause plus
• No alternative diagnosis to explain the illness

Laboratory case deﬁnition
• A person with symptoms or signs suggestive of SARS plus
• Positive laboratory ﬁndings for SARS-CoV based on one or more of:
• PCR positive for SARS-CoV
• Seroconversion by ELISA or IFA
• Virus isolation
Testing should only be undertaken in a national or regional reference laboratory, as per WHO recommendations.

SARS: EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Pathophysiology A novel, previously undescribed coronavirus (SARSCoV) is thought to be the causal agent. It is still to be ascertained whether
microbiological and other cofactors enhance severity or transmissibility.
The complete genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV has now been determined. It is currently thought that animals act as the main reservoir.
SARS is mostly spread by large droplets and person-to-person contact.
There have been no reports of food- or water-borne transmission.
However, SARS-CoV is shed in large quantities in stool, and profuse watery
diarrhoea is a common symptom. Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV
has been a striking feature in most outbreaks. The use of aerosol generating procedures (endotracheal intubation, nebulization, bronchoscopy)
may amplify transmission.
Lung post mortem studies show diffuse alveolar damage, secondary
bacterial pneumonia, and interstitial giant cell and macrophage inﬁltration.
Pathological ﬁndings similar to those of bronchiolitis obliterans are recognized. There are no speciﬁc diagnostic features.
Incubation period is 2–10 days prior to the onset of the ﬁrst symptom,
which is typically fever.

543

544

CHAPTER 44

Respiratory infection: viral

SARS: clinical features and management
Clinical features The disease is a two-stage illness, commencing with
a prodrome of fever (>38*C), with or without rigors, with non-speciﬁc
systemic symptoms, e.g. malaise, headache, and myalgia.
The respiratory stage of the illness starts 3–7 days after the prodromal
phase with dry cough and breathlessness. Progression to respiratory failure
needing ventilation is well recognized. Up to 70% of patients develop large
volume watery diarrhoea without blood or mucus.
Destruction of lung tissue is thought to result from an excessive immune
response to the virus, rather than from the direct effects of virus replication. Peak viral load is at day 12–14 of infection, with virus shed not only in
respiratory secretions, but in faeces and other body ﬂuids.
Retrospectively devised but non-validated scoring systems show that
the presence of cough, myalgia, diarrhoea, and rhinorrhoea or sore throat
are 100% sensitive and 76% speciﬁc at identifying a patient with SARS.
Children experience a milder form of the disease, with a low death rate.

Investigations The illness is a symptom complex and the case deﬁnition is
broad. Diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical syndrome and absence
of positive bacteriology and virology. SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion.
Recommended investigations in a suspected case include
• Blood tests
• White blood count is normal or reduced, with a low total lymphocyte count (in 98% in the Hong Kong case series)
• Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are also recognized, with raised
creatine kinase (CK) and alanine transferase (ALT). A raised lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) is associated with a poorer outcome
• CXR ranges from normal to diffuse bilateral interstitial inﬁltrate. Areas
of focal consolidation, initially peripherally and lower zone in distribution, are also described. Cavitation, hilar lympadenopathy, and pleural
effusion are uncommon at presentation.
• CT may reveal areas of interstitial inﬁltrate, ground-glass opacities, and
interlobular septal thickening in those with a normal CXR. Spontaneous
pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subpleural ﬁbrosis, and/or cystic
changes can occur in later stages
• SARS-CoV can be detected by RT-PCR (sensitivity 70%, dependent on
specimen type and duration of illness). Useful specimens include nasopharyngeal aspirate, throat swab, urine, and faeces. An initial positive
result on PCR must be conﬁrmed by another clinical sample,
re-extracting and testing the original sample, and using assays that
target different parts of the genome. However, identiﬁcation of seroconversion on a whole virus immunoassay remains the gold standard
for the retrospective virological conﬁrmation of the disease. The antibody response peaks at 10–14 days after the onset of fever. Agreement
has been reached between international agencies to share specimens
and laboratory data to develop a diagnostic test as soon as possible.
Work to standardize PCR and ELISA testing for the SARS virus is
ongoing

SARS: CLINICAL FEATURES AND MANAGEMENT

Treatment
• There is no speciﬁc treatment for SARS other than general supportive
care. No RCT treatment data exists
• Some patients have been treated with oseltamivir and/or intravenous
ribavirin. Immunoglobulin, anti-TNFA, highly active retroviral therapy
(HAART), anti-platelet agents, and convalescence serum from SARS
patients have all been all tried
• Patients treated with Kaletra® (400 mg ritonivir and 100 mg lopinavir)
with ribavarin for 14 days had a lower incidence of ARDS and death,
and this combination should be considered early for SARS patients,
ideally in a randomized controlled trial
• Interferon B limits SARS-CoV replication in vitro, and patients treated
with interferon alfacon-1 with corticosteroid had a better clinical
course, with lower death rates
• Steroids lead to reduced fever, and improved oxygenation and CXR
appearance, but do not alter need for ITU, or the death rate at
3 weeks. Some data suggest that high dose IV methylprednisolone
(500 mg qds for 3–6 days) may be life-saving for patients with deteriorating radiographic consolidation and increasing oxygen requirements
(‘critical SARS’)
• A series from Toronto showed a trend towards worsening outcome
in those treated with ribavirin, due to elevated transaminases and haemolysis. There are no in vitro data to show any anti-SARS virus activity
of ribavirin
• Experimental animal models show reduced viral replication with
pegylated interferon A, and human studies using interferon and corticosteroids have shown no adverse effects
• Some studies show beneﬁt from therapy with high-dose methylprednisolone given in the later stages of the illness; however, randomized
placebo-controlled trials are awaited
• Vaccinations are being developed

Hospital admission Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV has been
a striking feature in most outbreaks. Infected and suspected cases should
be managed in negative pressure side rooms. Full protective clothing,
including protective eye wear and face masks, are recommended for all
visitors and health care workers. The use of aerosol generating procedures should be avoided where possible.

Prognosis Older age is associated with a poorer outcome. Diabetes and
other comorbid illness are independent risk factors for death.

Prevention focuses on avoidance of exposure and effective infection
control measures. Closure of hospitals and schools in affected areas and
the use of quarantine measures helped to limit the spread of the disease in
a number of countries.

CHAPTER 45

Sarcoidosis

Aetiology and pathology
Deﬁnition
• A multisystem inﬂammatory disorder of unknown cause, likely resulting
from the interplay of environmental and genetic factors
• Characterized by non-caseating granulomata and CD4 Th1-biased
T-cell response in affected organs
• Commonly involves the respiratory system, but can affect nearly all
organs
• 50–60% of people have spontaneous remissions; others may develop
chronic progressive disease

Aetiology Incidence varies with population studies, from 5 to
100/100 000, according to geographic distribution. UK incidence is about
5–10/100 000. Commoner in African-Americans, West Indians, and the
Irish. Commonly presents between ages of 20 and 40. Unusual in children
and the elderly. Typically more aggressive disease in Black populations than
in Caucasians—especially with skin disease, peripheral lymphadenopathy,
bone marrow, and liver involvement; higher relapse rates and worse longterm prognosis
Genetics Familial and ethnic clustering of cases suggest a genetic predisposition. Siblings of an affected person have a 5x increased risk of developing
sarcoidosis. Best evidence of HLA association comes from recent large
multicentre ACCESS study, showing HLA-DRB1*0301 is associated with
susceptibility to disease in Blacks and Whites. Also a genome-wide scan
for susceptibility genes in familial sarcoidosis has been performed, pointing
to a locus on chromosome 5 in African-Americans and chromosome 6 in
German Caucasians.

Pathology Sarcoidosis is caused by an immunological response:
• Unknown antigenic stimulus triggers CD4 (helper) T-cell activation and
expansion. This response is exaggerated and Th1-biased, with resultant
interferon gamma and IL-2 production from these T-cells
• Activated T cells proliferate and release mediators, attracting additional
inﬂammatory cells with concomitant macrophage activation and aggregation
• This leads to immune granuloma formation, which is enhanced by interferon gamma
• Granulomata themselves cause increased local ﬁbroblast stimulation
and hence ﬁbrosis
• Metabolic activity of macrophages causes raised ACE (angiotensinconverting enzyme) levels in serum, lung tissue, and bronchoalveolar
ﬂuid. Increase in T-cell activity causes B-lymphocyte stimulation, which
can cause raised serum immunoglobulins and immune complexes
• In most patients, response resolves over 2–5 years
Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions are depressed in sarcoidosis. This
is thought to be due to the migration of lymphocytes to the active compartment (lungs), with resultant peripheral blood lymphopenia. Seen as
a decreased response to tuberculin, mumps virus, and Candida albicans
antigens. This is not thought to be clinically signiﬁcant.

AETIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY

Sarcoid-like reactions are reported in association with malignancy and also
in HIV patients starting on antiretroviral therapy (very rare). Non-caseating
pulmonary granulomas are found, but there are no other symptoms or
signs of sarcoidosis.

CHAPTER 45

Sarcoidosis

Chest disease: clinical features
More than 90% of patients with sarcoidosis have thoracic involvement,
with an abnormal CXR. Pulmonary sarcoidosis can be an incidental CXR
ﬁnding in approximately 30% of patients. There is spontaneous remission
in two-thirds and 10–30% have a chronic course.

Clinical features There are probably at least 2 distinct clinical courses:
• Löfgren’s syndrome Mild acute disease, which is usually non-progressive. Presents with fever, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, erythema
nodosum, and arthralgia. Occurs particularly in Caucasians. Has a good
prognosis and resolves completely and spontaneously in 80% within
1–2 years. A minority may develop lung disease
• Persistent progressive inﬁltrative lung disease
Hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy May be asymptomatic or cause cough
or chest pain. Often bilateral and symmetrical, but can be unilateral and
asymmetrical. Can be associated with systemic symptoms of malaise and
arthralgia, which are helped by non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs.
Benign course.
Important to exclude other causes of lymphadenopathy, such as TB and
lymphoma. May need HRCT and lymph node aspirate or biopsy.
Does not require systemic steroid treatment.
Stage I: 85% resolve spontaneously over 2 years, 15% develop lung inﬁltrates. The average time for bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy resolution is
8 months
Interstitial lung involvement May be asymptomatic or cause morbidity and
mortality, with dyspnoea, cough, chest ache or frank pain, malaise, fatigue,
and impaired quality of life. Rarely have crackles or clubbing on examination. Pulmonary inﬁltrates on CXR. Can return to normal over time, or
progress to ﬁbrosis and respiratory failure. Lung function tests may be
normal, or may show a restrictive defect with reduced transfer factor.

Seeing a patient with possible sarcoidosis in clinic
• Make diagnosis—clinically, HRCT ± histology
• Assess extent/severity/presence of extrapulmonary involvement—
CXR, PFT, ECG, eyes, rash, renal function, serum calcium, liver
function, immunoglobulins, and ACE (latter two can be raised in active
sarcoidosis)
• Stable or progressive?—CXR, PFT (VC 9 KCO), oximetry, ACE, urea (if
renal involvement)

CHAPTER 45

Sarcoidosis

Chest disease: management
Diagnosis is based on a characteristic clinical picture, plus:
• Histological evidence of non-caseating granuloma in any tissue
• Characteristic picture on imaging (thoracic HRCT scan or gallium scan)
• Lymphocytosis on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
Other diseases capable of producing similar clinical and histological picture,
particularly tuberculosis and lymphoma, should be excluded.

Investigations
• HRCT Micronodules in a subpleural and bronchovascular distribution.
Fissural nodularity and bronchial distortion. Irregular linear opacities, ground-glass shadowing related to bronchovascular bundles, and
nodular or ill-deﬁned shadows. Air-trapping due to small airway granulomata common. Endobronchial disease in 55%. Possible honeycomb
lung. Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. CT-guided FNA of subcarinal or mediastinal nodes may be possible and yield a tissue diagnosis
• Bronchoscopy (transbronchial biopsy, TBNA, bronchial biopsy, or
bronchoalveolar lavage) may not be necessary if there is no diagnostic
doubt clinically and radiologically. Positive yield of bronchial biopsy
is 41–57%. Higher if visible abnormal mucosa. Positive yield of transbronchial biopsy is 40–90% (still high yield even if lungs appear normal
on HRCT). This is the initial procedure of choice in a patient with
suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis. Transbronchial needle aspiration
(TBNA) of the mediastinal lymph nodes will yield a diagnosis in 63–90%
of cases. Transbronchial biopsy and TBNA have a higher yield together
than either alone. Experience is limited in endoscopic ultrasound FNA
(EUS-FNA) in sarcoidosis. BAL in sarcoidosis shows a CD4:CD8 ratio
of >3.5. If this test is not available, a lymphocytosis of >2 × 105cells/mL
supports the diagnosis, but is not diagnostic. (Lymphocytosis is also
seen in UIP, COP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and smokers)
• Mediastinoscopy for central or paratracheal nodes or open lung
biopsy: 90% positive yield. May be necessary to exclude lymphoma.
Surgical biopsy is not usually necessary, but if other procedures have
not yielded a deﬁnitive diagnosis, it may be required. Lymph node ±
lung (usually via VATS) can be biopsied.
• Biopsy other affected areas such as skin, liver, etc. if indicated, as these
may be easier to biopsy in order to make a diagnosis
• Mantoux/Heaf test may show minimal reaction/grade 0 in sarcoid
(peripheral cutaneous anergy to tuberculin due to migration of T cells
to active sites of disease). A positive Mantoux or Heaf test therefore
make sarcoidosis less likely as a diagnosis, although does not necessarily
make tuberculosis more likely as the diagnosis. Heaf testing not widely
used now.
• Kveim test No longer performed clinically, due to risks of transmissible
diseases. It involved injecting homogenized splenic tissue from a patient
with sarcoidosis to see if a granulomatous reaction occurred.

CHEST DISEASE: MANAGEMENT

Monitoring disease There is no single measurement to assess all the
aspects of patients with sarcoidosis. Clinical examination and serial measurements are key.
• PFT Pulmonary sarcoidosis gives a restrictive defect with decreased
TLC and VC. TLCO provides the most sensitive measurement of
change, although a properly performed VC is probably adequate for
clinical purposes. Likely to improve with steroids. Airﬂow obstruction
may also occur
• CXR may improve with time or treatment
• ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) levels increased in up to 80%
of patients with acute sarcoidosis, although can be normal in active
disease. It may be a surrogate marker of the total granuloma burden.
Levels become normal as disease resolves. Can be useful to monitor
the clinical course, if activity is uncertain, but levels should not be used
in isolation to determine treatment. Levels suppressed by steroids and
when steroids are stopped levels usually increase, unrelated to sarcoidosis activity. This is not a speciﬁc test. False positives include TB
• Calcium may rise with active sarcoidosis or in the summer months.
This may cause renal impairment, so urea or creatinine should also be
checked
• BAL not performed routinely to assess progress of sarcoidosis, but
changes in proportions of cells seen in lavage would indicate improvement
• PET scan may be positive in areas of disease activity. Not reliable for
studying brain or heart. Limited studies of serial data
• Gallium scan rarely used now, as non-speciﬁc and expensive. Areas of
active inﬂammation are positive, with a classic ‘panda pattern’. Positive
areas soon become negative with steroid use. Bowel and liver positive
anyway, so disease cannot be charted in these areas.

553

554

CHAPTER 45

Sarcoidosis

General management
Most patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis do not require treatment.
Asymptomatic CXR inﬁltrates are usually monitored.

Indications for immunosuppressive treatment
• Increasing symptoms, deteriorating PFTs, and worsening CXR
inﬁltrates
• Cardiac sarcoidosis
• Neurosarcoidosis
• Sight-threatening ocular sarcoidosis
• Hypercalcaemia
• Lupus pernio
• Splenic, hepatic, or renal sarcoidosis.

Starting drug treatment
• When required, treatment is usually with steroids initially. Good evidence for short to medium term improvement in symptoms, respiratory function, and radiology, but long-term beneﬁts less clear
• Give high doses, such as 40 mg prednisolone/day, to control active
disease. Rarely need more than 40 mg/day. Usually give this high dose
for 4 weeks and then reduce if there has been a response
• Maintenance dose of around 5–20 mg, to control symptoms. Leave on
this dose for a few months and then slowly reduce steroid dose further.
Maintain on low dose of prednisolone (5–7.5 mg/day or alternate days)
for prolonged period of up to 12 months to consolidate resolution,
before considering complete withdrawal.
• Some patients, especially those with progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis,
may require longer treatment (years) of low-dose prednisolone to
prevent relapse
• Inhaled steroids are of limited efﬁcacy in sarcoidosis, but may be useful
if there is cough or bronchial hyperreactivity
• Relapses often occur when treatment is stopped and may require the
reintroduction of steroids, or the increase of steroid dose. Duration
and dose of steroids is dictated by site and response to treatment
• Avoid futile steroid treatment for end-stage disease, such as honeycomb lung
• If steroid treatment fails, or sarcoidosis is life-threatening, other immunosuppressive regimes may be indicated. Pulsed high-dose intravenous
methylprednisolone is an option, which can be particularly useful for
neurosarcoidosis
• In cases where prolonged immunosuppression is required, or if
steroid side-effects cannot be tolerated, other immunosuppressive
drugs should be considered. Possibilities include azathioprine and
methotrexate. There are limited data for their use in sarcoidosis
• Patients who have troublesome symptoms related to sarcoidosis, such
as arthralgia, skin disease, fever, sweats, ocular symptoms, systemic
symptoms such as fatigue, may require symptomatic steroid treatment.

GENERAL MANAGEMENT

Lower initial doses such as 20 mg/day are likely to be sufﬁcient to gain
symptomatic control and doses can then be reduced
• Prescribe gastric and bone protection with steroids when necessary

Other drugs used in sarcoidosis
(See p 601 for more information regarding immunosuppressive drugs.)
If there is progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis, refractory to steroids, consider:
• Methotrexate Given once/week 15–25 mg PO for 6-month trial. Use
instead of or in addition to low-dose prednisolone. Avoid if hepatic or
renal failure. Side-effects: GI upset, stomatitis, pneumonitis, myelosuppression. Teratogenic. Low oncogenic potential. Monitor FBC and
MCV, AST, ALT every 2 weeks for 3 months, then monthly. Do not use
for >2 years. Useful for chronic sarcoidosis and cutaneous disease
• Azathioprine Used in neurosarcoidosis and stage II/III pulmonary sarcoidosis with partial/no steroid response. 100–150 mg/day. Use instead
of or in addition to low-dose prednisolone. Side-effects: myelosuppression, GI upset, stomatitis, idiosyncratic reaction–fever, rash. Low
oncogenic potential. No gonadal toxicity. Check FBC every 2 weeks for
3 months, then monthly. TPMT (thiopurine methyltransferase) testing
should be performed prior to commencement (see p 678)
• Cyclophosphamide IV pulsed, for neurosarcoidosis unresponsive to
steroids. Toxicity proﬁle limits use. (See p 681)
• Anti-malarials Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg od/bd.
For skin and hypercalcaemia. Steroid sparing. Can be given with steroids
and other immunosuppressant in severe sarcoidosis. Side-effects: rarely,
ocular toxicity
• Others New unproven efﬁcacy: ciclosporin, thalidomide, TNFA
inhibitors (etanercept, inﬂiximab)

Prognosis There are no prognostic markers in sarcoidosis, apart from:
• Good prognosis Löfgren’s syndrome has complete resolution in 80% of
people
• Poorer prognosis with chronic disease Lupus pernio, nasal mucosa involvement, chronic uveitis, chronic hypercalcaemia, nephrocalcinosis, neural
involvement, age greater than 40 and Black race
• Prognosis according to CXR appearance:
• Stage II: 50% cases recover spontaneously in 2 years, 30–40% require
systemic steroids, 10–15% require long-term steroids
• Stage III: Worse prognosis. Only 30% show signiﬁcant improvement
with steroids

Transplant Consider if patient has end-stage lung disease, rapidly progressive disease despite treatment, or if they are oxygen dependent.
Sarcoidosis is a rare indication for lung transplant. Granulomata recur in
transplanted lung, but do not cause higher rates of graft failure.

555

556

CHAPTER 45

Sarcoidosis

Extra-thoracic disease 1
Varies according to ethnic origin and sex of patient.

Systemic symptoms are common, such as fever, sweats, loss of appetite,
weight loss, fatigue, malaise, chest pain, dyspnoea, and cough. Polyarthralgia
often affects the knees, ankles, wrists, and elbows, and can be improved by
NSAIDs.
Hypercalcaemia Granulomata convert vitamin D3 to active 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. This causes enhanced calcium absorption from intestine. Sunlight also increases levels of vitamin D and calcium. High calcium
may cause systemic effects and is often associated with renal damage and
hypercalciuria. Commoner in Caucasians and in men.
Treatment If mildly raised, limit dietary calcium intake, avoid sun exposure and drink plenty of ﬂuids. Otherwise, steroids, often low dose once
calcium level controlled (should be within 2 weeks—if not investigate for
other cause for hypercalcaemia). Decrease dose when calcium level satisfactory. Some patients may only need steroids during the summer months.
Hydroxychloroquine can also be used.

Skin 25% of patients have skin involvement. More common in women.
Erythema nodosum Raised papules, nodules, or plaques, usually on shins.
Also tender, indurated, or bruised appearance. Firm and often have shiny
appearance. Nodular change involving different tattoo colours recognized
and is characteristic of sarcoidosis. Sarcoid tissue may arise in old scars, or
cause scar hypertrophy.
Lupus pernio is a bluish tinge that occurs on nose, cheeks, and ears. It is
associated with chronic disease.
Diagnosis Usually easily biopsied
Treatment Initially with topical preparations. Lupus pernio should be
treated with systemic steroids. Hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate may
be necessary. Role of long-term tetracyclines for cutaneous sarcoidosis
under investigation

Eye Common, occurring in 25% plus of cases, especially women and
African-Caribbeans
Uveitis (acute or chronic), episcleritis, scleritis, glaucoma, conjunctivitis, and retinal
involvement can occur. May be asymptomatic, or cause painful red eye, with
photophobia, lacrimation, and blurred vision. Pupil irregular or constricted.
Untreated, can cause visual impairment.
Lacrimal involvement in sarcoidosis gives keratoconjunctivitis sicca—dry eye
with diminished tear secretion. Painful red eyes. Treat with artiﬁcial tears.
Diagnosis Assessment by an ophthalmologist with slit lamp examination if any ocular symptoms. Some recommend that all newly diagnosed
patients with sarcoidosis have slit lamp examination. Mild asymptomatic
eye involvement is common. May need conjunctival biopsy, if no evidence
of sarcoid elsewhere.
Treatment Local steroids are commonly used if there is no other indication for systemic steroids. However, if it does not respond, systemic steroids should be used.

EXTRA-THORACIC DISEASE 1

Heart Cardiac sarcoidosis occurs in 5% of patients with pulmonary
disease. Post mortem studies show cardiac sarcoidosis is present in 25%,
so is often undiagnosed. Patients may present with chest pain or, more commonly, are found to have conduction defects on the ECG. These may be
benign and asymptomatic, like ﬁrst-degree heart block, but more signiﬁcant
arrhythmias can occur, the ﬁrst indication of which may be sudden death.
Myocardial granulomata can occur in any part of the heart. Commonly
they occur in the interventricular septum, where they can affect nodal and
conducting tissue. The left ventricular wall can be affected, with ﬁbrosis
causing reduced compliance and contractile difﬁculties, leading to cardiac
failure. Aneurysms can form, and pericarditis can occur. Valvular dysfunction due to inﬁltration of the papillary muscles is rare. The clinical course
can be uncertain.
Diagnosis Echocardiogram may show signs of cardiomyopathy—usually
restrictive. MRI, technetium scan, or gallium scan show non-segmental
ﬁxed defects. Biopsy is diagnostic, but can be difﬁcult as sarcoidosis is
patchy. Not recommended in general. ECG and 24-h tape may be helpful
in investigation.
Treatment Must be treated with systemic steroids 20–40 mg prednisolone/
day, which improve symptoms and ECG and Echo features. These should
be slowly reduced, but intractable arrhythmias may need continued high
dosage. May need other immunosuppressants. Investigate with 24-h tape
if uncertain. Amiodarone, a pacemaker, implantable deﬁbrillator, or heart
transplant may be necessary.
In clinic Perform a screening ECG on all patients with sarcoidosis perhaps
every 6 months.

557

558

CHAPTER 45

Sarcoidosis

Extra-thoracic disease 2
Kidney A degree of renal involvement is found in 35% of patients with
sarcoidosis. Rarely can present with renal failure, obstructive uropathy,
nephrolithiasis, or urinary tract disorder. Nephrocalcinosis is a common
cause of chronic renal failure. Often associated hypercalcaemia or other
manifestation of sarcoidosis.
Diagnosis Renal biopsy with granulomata found in interstitium, but this is
rarely needed in this context. Search for pulmonary sarcoidosis.
Treatment Steroids ± hydroxychloroquine for hypercalcaemia.

CNS Involved in 4–18% of patients. Can affect any part of the peripheral
or central nervous system. Can present as a peripheral nerve or cranial
nerve lesion. Most common is lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy, with
optic nerve involvement being next commonest. Mononeuritis multiplex
recognized. May be less speciﬁc, with psychiatric features. Hypothalamic
granulomata may cause diabetes insipidus, appetite disturbance, or hypersomnolence.
Diagnosis Difﬁcult, but may be made easier if there is another sign of systemic sarcoidosis, for example bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Lumbar
puncture may show a raised CSF ACE and an increased lymphocyte count.
Conﬁrm with biopsy if possible—cerebral or meningeal tissue if no pulmonary involvement.
Treatment Must be treated with steroids, but often quite resistant to
treatment. May need to try further immunosuppressants.

Musculoskeletal Arthralgia is common in sarcoidosis, but arthritis is
unusual. Arthralgia commonly affects the ankles and feet, but also hands,
wrists, and elbows. A subacute proximal myopathy can occur, as well as
bone cysts, especially of terminal phalanges. The latter show little response
to systemic steroids.
Diagnosis Granuloma seen on muscle biopsy.
Treatment NSAIDs; steroids may be necessary.

GI 60% of liver biopsies on patients with sarcoidosis show granuloma.
Frequently asymptomatic. Hepatomegaly unusual, but can get portal ﬁbrosis
and cirrhosis. LFTs suggestive if 3× normal, especially ALP and GGT.
Diagnosis Biopsy.
Treatment Steroids—may reduce size of liver and improve LFTs.

EXTRA-THORACIC DISEASE 2

Haematological Splenomegaly can occur and may be massive, causing
abdominal discomfort. A massive spleen may require splenectomy to
avoid rupture. Associated anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.
Lymphopenia often seen.
ENT Nasal or laryngeal granuloma. Sinus invasion. Parotid and other salivary gland enlargement, dry mouth.
Rarely Breast disease, ovarian or testicular masses.

CHAPTER 46

Sickle cell disease

Overview
Background
Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive condition resulting in a substitution of a valine for glycine in the beta-globin subunit of haemoglobin (Hb),
forming HbS. HbS is less soluble under reduced oxygen tensions and
leads to deformation of red blood cells (sickling) when deoxygenated (for
example, in atelectatic lung), resulting in chronic haemolysis and vascular
occlusion with tissue infarction in individuals homozygous for the betaglobin gene mutation (sickle cell anaemia/disease). Haemoglobin electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in sickle cell
disease demonstrates HbS ~80–99% and no normal haemoglobin HbA;
anaemia Hb 6–9 g/dl is usual. Heterozygote carriers of the beta-globin
gene mutation are referred to as having ‘sickle cell trait’ and are largely
asymptomatic, although sickle crises may occur during extreme hypoxia
(e.g. during anaesthesia); HPLC analysis demonstrates HbS ~35–40% and
HbA (normal haemoglobin) ~50%. Sickle haemoglobin solubility testing
does not distinguish between trait and homozygous disease.

Pulmonary complications
• Obstructive airways disease and airway hyper-reactivity is often noted
on pulmonary function testing; pathogenesis unclear
• Nocturnal oxyhaemoglobin desaturation is common, pathogenesis
unclear—tonsillar hypertrophy is common, and OSA may be a contributing factor
• Pneumonia is more common, particularly from Chlamydia pneumoniae,
S. pneumoniae, H. inﬂuenzae, Mycoplasma, Legionella and respiratory
viruses; may precipitate acute chest syndrome. Invasive pneumococcal
disease is signiﬁcantly more common. Patients should take lifelong prophylactic penicillin, as functionally asplenic
• Pulmonary thromboembolism appears to be more common; may precipitate acute chest syndrome
• Acute chest syndrome
• Sickle cell chronic lung disease

CHAPTER 46

Sickle cell disease

Acute chest syndrome
Deﬁnition and clinical features Deﬁned as new pulmonary inﬁltrates on CXR, associated with symptoms such as fever, cough, chest pain
and breathlessness. A form of acute lung injury; may progress to ARDS.
Leading cause of death in sickle cell disease; occurs in up to half of all
patients during their lifetime. Risk factors include young age, high steady
state leukocyte counts and haemoglobin levels, and past history of acute
chest syndrome. May follow surgery and anaesthesia.

Causes may not be apparent, and include one or more of infection, pulmonary fat embolism (preceded by bony pain), in situ thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, atelectasis following hypoventilation (from acute painful
crisis of chest wall or excessive opiates), and possibly pulmonary oedema
due to excessive hydration. Each leads to hypoxia with increased sickling
and vascular occlusion, and initially mild disease can escalate rapidly to
ARDS and death. All patients with a painful vaso-occlusive crisis should
be monitored closely for the development of the acute chest syndrome;
routine use of incentive spirometry may help prevent its development in
these patients.
Investigations
• Blood tests Raised white cell count, anaemia; check HbS %
• Hypoxia is common and may be underestimated using pulse oximetry;
A–a gradient predicts clinical severity; consider ITU transfer if worsens
• Culture blood and sputum
• CXR shows multifocal pulmonary inﬁltrates, sometimes with pleural
effusion
• BAL may be considered in patients not responding to treatment.

ACUTE CHEST SYNDROME

3 Management of sickle cell acute chest syndrome
Supportive care on ITU may be required. Liaise with haematology team.
Treatment comprises:
• Oxygen to correct hypoxia; monitor ABGs
• Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics (including a macrolide)
• Rehydration (IV ﬂuids may be needed; care to avoid overhydration)
• Bronchodilators are often used; airﬂow obstruction is common, may
contribute to high airway pressures during mechanical ventilation
• Ensure adequate analgesia for bony pain (consider NSAIDs; IM or SC
opiates often required)
• Incentive spirometry and chest physiotherapy to prevent atelectasis.
Pain may limit their use, and CPAP may be better tolerated
• Simple and exchange blood transfusion both reduce the HbS
concentration and improve oxygenation in acute chest syndrome.
Indications for transfusion include persistent or worsening hypoxia,
severe disease, multilobar involvement, neurological complications,
multi-organ failure, or history of cardiac disease. Simple transfusion is
recommended if severely anaemic, although Hb should not be raised
above 10.5 g/dl as the increase in blood viscosity exacerbates sickling.
Exchange transfusion should be used in patients with a relatively high
Hb, aiming for HbS <20% and maintaining total Hb <14.5 g/dl
• Other treatments. Successful use of inhaled nitric oxide for the
treatment of a handful of refractory cases has been reported.
Corticosteroids may be of beneﬁt in children, but rebound pain crises
may occur and routine use of corticosteroids is not recommended.
Hydroxyurea increases fetal Hb and reduces sickling, and signiﬁcantly
reduces the incidence of acute chest syndrome; it is recommended
for patients with recurrent episodes.

Prognosis Approximately 13% of patients with acute chest syndrome
require mechanical ventilation; overall mortality 4–9%.

CHAPTER 46

Sickle cell disease

Sickle cell chronic lung disease
Sickle cell chronic lung disease is a poorly described entity, characterized by progressive breathlessness and abnormal pulmonary function,
sometimes with pulmonary hypertension. Thought to follow recurrent episodes of lung infarction/infection, although there may not be a history of
previous acute chest syndrome. Prevalence in sickle cell disease estimated
at 4%. Radiologically, characterized by multifocal interstitial inﬁltrate. PFTs
typically restrictive, although airways obstruction also described.
Severe pulmonary hypertension may occur in up to a third of patients
with sickle cell disease. Management is largely as for idiopathic pulmonary
arterial hypertension, with anticoagulation and vasodilators in a specialist
centre (p 392). Hydroxyurea reduces episodes of acute chest syndrome
and may be of beneﬁt. Inhaled nitric oxide may have a role; studies are
ongoing. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy may be considered in
patients with proximal pulmonary artery occlusion.

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
Deﬁnition and epidemiology OSA, or obstructive sleep apnoea/
hypopnoea (OSAH) are currently the preferred terms for the problem of
dynamic upper airway obstruction during sleep.
• OSA is part of a spectrum, with trivial snoring at one end and repetitive complete obstruction throughout the night (such that the patient
cannot sleep and breathe at the same time) at the other
• Along this spectrum is a point at which the degree of obstruction and
recovery fragments sleep enough to cause daytime symptoms
• Distinction should be made between the sleep study ﬁndings alone
(i.e. presence of sleep apnoea episodes), and an abnormal sleep study
plus the presence of symptoms (i.e. obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome,
OSAS).
Thresholds deﬁning ‘abnormality’ are arbitrary (e.g. 10 s to deﬁne an apnoea).
Numerical deﬁnitions of OSA, based on counting individual events during
a sleep study, are not very helpful. The current deﬁnition of the clinical
syndrome should be:
Upper airway narrowing, provoked by sleep, causing sufﬁcient sleep
fragmentation to result in signiﬁcant daytime symptoms, usually excessive sleepiness.
• Prevalence depends on the chosen thresholds for deﬁning both an
abnormality on the sleep study, and signiﬁcant symptoms
• 0.5–1% of adult men in the UK (and about a ﬁfth as many women) have
OSA syndrome sufﬁcient to be candidates for treatment with nasal
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment
• Prevalence ﬁgures depend on levels of obesity and will be higher in the
USA, and probably rise inexorably in the UK in the future
• The prevalence in women is thought to be lower due to their different
fat distribution. Upper body obesity (and thus neck obesity) is more a
male pattern
• OSA is the third most common serious respiratory condition after
asthma and COPD. In some respiratory units it has now become the
commonest reason for specialist referral

Pathophysiology and associated conditions Control of the upper
airway musculature is complex; upper airway patency depends on dilator
muscle activity. All postural muscles relax during sleep (including pharyngeal dilators); some narrowing of the upper airway is normal. Excessive
narrowing with the onset of sleep is due to the following factors.
Causes of a small pharyngeal size when awake (such that normal muscle
relaxation with sleep is enough to provoke critical narrowing).
• Fatty inﬁltration of pharyngeal tissues and external pressure from
increased neck fat and/or muscle bulk
• Large tonsils
• Subtle ‘abnormalities’ of craniofacial shape, e.g. minor micrognathia or
retrognathia
• Extra submucosal tissue, e.g. myxoedema, mucopolysaccharidoses

OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNOEA

Causes of excessive narrowing of the airway occurring with muscle
relaxation at sleep onset
• Mass loading from an obese or muscular neck may simply ‘overwhelm’
residual dilator action, as well as reduce the starting size
• Neuromuscular diseases with pharyngeal involvement may lead to
greater loss of dilator muscle tone, e.g. stroke, myotonic dystrophy,
Duchenne dystrophy, motor neuron disease
• Muscle relaxants, such as sedatives and alcohol
• Increasing age
Predisposing conditions OSA is found more commonly in certain conditions, such as acromegaly and hypothyroidism, but the reasons are not
well understood. It is unclear whether there need to be any other nonanatomical factors (such as unstable ventilatory control, or pharyngeal
sensory abnormalities) to provoke OSA. Most associated abnormalities
that have been described are likely to be secondary to long periods of
snoring and OSA, rather than primary causal factors.
Short-term consequences of OSA In severe OSA, repetitive collapse of the
upper airway, with arousal required to re-activate the pharyngeal dilators,
occurs approximately every minute throughout the sleeping period (60
events/h, or over 400 per night); they are usually attended by hypoxia and
hypercapnia that are corrected during the inter-apnoeic hyperventilatory
period. Obstructive events short of complete obstruction also provoke
arousal, as it is usually the compensatory reﬂex increase in inspiratory
effort, rather than the blood gas deterioration directly, that wakens the
brain. In this situation the drops in oxygen saturation may be very much
less and, in younger thinner individuals, almost imperceptible on oximetry
tracings. This is because the compensation afforded by the increased
inspiratory effort may be adequate, and the bigger oxygen stores in the
lungs of the less obese will buffer any brief hypoventilation.
• Recurrent arousals lead to highly fragmented and unrefreshing sleep
• Excessive daytime sleepiness results
• The correlation between the sleep fragmentation and the resultant
degree of sleepiness is not tight, with some patients being sleepy with
low levels of fragmentation, and vice versa
• This is thought to result partly from inter-individual differences in sensitivity to the effects of sleep fragmentation
• With every arousal there is a rise in blood pressure, often over
50 mmHg. It is unclear if these BP rises do any damage to the cardiovascular system. There is also a carry-over of hypertension (average of
3 mmHg) into the waking hours which falls after treatment at 1 month
• There is true nocturia, mechanism unclear; there may be raised atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels from increased central blood volume,
brought about by the subatmospheric intrathoracic pressures during
the obstructed breathing; or it may be simply a reﬂection of highly fragmented sleep preventing the normal reduction in urine ﬂow associated
with sleep.

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

OSA: clinical features
Chapter 14 (p 85) covers many of the essential features in the history and
discusses the differential diagnosis of excessive daytime sleepiness.
Most patients present with:
• Excessive sleepiness, measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale; >9
is considered abnormally sleepy (p 89)
• Loud snoring, and apnoeic episodes recognized by the bed partner
• The patient recognizes that he wakes up choking from time to time
• Poor concentration
• Unrefreshing sleep and waking unrefreshed
• Nocturia (true nocturia with reversal of the usual day/night ratio)
Less often there will be:
• Nocturnal sweating
• Reduced libido
• Oesophageal reﬂux
• Increasingly common are patients arriving with spouses worried by the
apnoeic pauses they have observed
Sleepiness
• Sometimes difﬁcult to assess: failure by the patient to recognize the
problem, or denial due to concerns over driving and licensing
• The Epworth scale (p 89) assesses tendency to fall asleep, rather than
perceived sleepiness per se, as some patients may regard their situation
as normal
• It is important to separate the symptom of tiredness from sleepiness
(p 86), the latter being much more typical of OSA, although sometimes
complained of (rather than sleepiness) by women with OSA
Examination and investigations
The examination (often unrewarding) and the investigations are detailed
in Chapter 14 (p 88). Look for the presence of additional lower airways
obstruction, with associated CO2 retention, so-called ‘overlap syndrome’.
CO2 retention in pure OSA is very uncommon (except in the very, very
obese). It appears that the additive effect of some lower airways obstruction (often not enough in its own right to precipitate CO2 retention) is
required, which perhaps limits the inter-apnoeic hyperventilation and thus
gradually encourages tolerance to raised levels of CO2.
The majority of patients with signiﬁcant OSA are male, tend to have a
combination of upper body obesity (neck circumference >17 in), and a
relatively undersized or set back mandible. Airway size can be assessed
with scoring systems, e.g. p 591.

Sleep study
The sleep study assesses if there is anything likely to be the cause of the
patient’s symptoms. The considerable grey area between normality and
abnormality means that sometimes it is unclear whether the symptoms
can be blamed on the sleep study ﬁndings. There is also considerable nightto-night variation in sleep study indices that further blurs the distinction
between normality and abnormality. In this situation it may be necessary
to undertake a therapeutic trial of nasal CPAP and let the patient decide if
the beneﬁts of treatment outweigh the disadvantages.

572

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

OSA: types of sleep study
• Overnight oximetry alone
• More than just oximetry, with other channels such as snoring, body
movement, heart rate, oronasal airﬂow, chest and abdominal movements,
leg movements: so-called ‘limited’ sleep studies, or ‘respiratory PSG’
• Full polysomnography, with EEG, EOG, and EMG, to stage sleep electrophysiologically, in addition to the channels listed above
There is no evidence that OSA diagnosis needs full polysomnography
(PSG with EEG) and it is not indicated for most patients. Oximetry will
identify most cases, allowing onward referral for CPAP treatment. Falsepositive oximetry occurs with Cheyne–Stokes breathing (heart failure,
post-stroke) and when there is a low baseline SaO2 (e.g. COPD); this
allows the SaO2 to oscillate more, with small changes in PaO2 due to the
increasing steepness of the Hb dissociation curve at lower SaO2. False
negatives, discussed earlier, can occur with younger and thinner patients.
With appropriate expertise, and recognition of its limitations, oximetry
alone is a very valuable tool in the diagnosis and management of OSA.
Limited sleep studies (respiratory PSG) are the usual routine investigation. Different units have expertise in interpreting different sorts of sleep
studies. Experience is more important than the particular sleep study
equipment used. Any system should assess the degree of sleep fragmentation and the degree of upper airway narrowing: this can be done using
many different direct and indirect techniques.

Management
Not all patients need treatment. The evidence for signiﬁcant treatment
beneﬁts rests on symptoms, which drive treatment, rather than the degree
of OSA on a sleep study. Treatment decisions require a close dialogue
between physician and patient.
Key features in making a treatment choice
• How sleepy is the patient? Does it affect quality of life? Is it critical to
the patient’s livelihood (e.g. HGV driving)? Are they motivated to do
anything about it?
• Has the patient underestimated the impact of their sleepiness or misled
the doctor because of concerns over driving issues?
• Is there any evidence of the ‘overlap’ syndrome, where additional lower
airways obstruction has contributed to pushing the patient into type II
ventilatory failure? If so, is this a stable state or part of an acute decline
with a respiratory acidosis?
• Is obesity the dominant risk factor or is there a surgically remediable
component (e.g. tonsillar hypertrophy)?
There is no RCT evidence that CVD, nocturnal angina, or poorly controlled hypertension should inﬂuence the decision to treat. Many, however,
would lower the treatment threshold. There is some evidence that
treating OSA when there is left heart failure improves ejection fraction
and possibly survival.

OSA: TYPES OF SLEEP STUDY

Simple approaches
• Weight loss. This is difﬁcult; slimming clubs have the best record for
non-surgical approaches
• Reduce evening alcohol consumption
• Sleep decubitus, rather than supine, and with the bedhead elevated
For snorers and mild OSA
• Mandibular advancement devices, assuming adequate dentition
• Pharyngeal surgery as a last resort (poor RCT data and what there is
suggests poor outcomes)
For signiﬁcant OSA
• Nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP)
• Bariatric surgery (e.g. gastroplasty or gastric bypass operations)
• Tracheostomy (rarely indicated)
• Mandibular/maxillary advancement surgery in highly selected cases
Severe OSA with CO2 retention
• May require a period of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
(NIPPV) prior to CPAP if acidotic
• Compensated CO2 retention may reverse with CPAP alone
If there are large tonsils then their removal may be appropriate, although
this seems to be much more successful in children than in adults. In reality
pharyngeal surgery is a poor option for either snoring or OSA; what little
evidence there is suggests that the outcomes are little better than placebo.
There is no place for alerting agents (such as modaﬁnil) in the routine
management of sleepiness in OSA. It is unclear if these drugs help; they
may reduce the perception of sleepiness more than the sleepiness itself,
and have only been studied in the residual sleepiness sometimes found in
patients, even when treated successfully with nasal CPAP.
Mandibular advancement devices
• Worn in the mouth at night, holding the lower jaw forward: similar to
‘jaw thrust’ in an unconscious patient
• Many designs, but essentially one half clips to the upper teeth and the
other half to the lower, and connected together with the lower jaw
misaligned forward by 5–10 mm
• Some give adjustable forward displacement; some are ﬁxed
• They need to be customized to match the patient’s dentition, which
usually requires the services of a dentist
• DIY devices exist that are heated and moulded to the teeth directly
• Control snoring and OSA at the milder end of the spectrum
• Side-effects include tooth pain and jaw ache, which often lessen
with time
• Long-term use may be associated with movement of the teeth and
alterations to the bite
• The initial cost (usually over £300) is similar to that of a CPAP machine
(£250) and they usually only last about a year.

573

574

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

OSA: nasal CPAP
Nasal CPAP consists of a blower/pressure generator that sits by the
patient’s bed and is connected to a mask by a length of large-bore tubing.
The masks are usually just nasal, but nose and mouth masks are also used.
The blower raises the pressure at which the patient is breathing (to about
10 cmH2O) and splints open the pharynx, preventing its collapse, sleep fragmentation, and the consequent daytime sleepiness. Nasal CPAP is a highly
effective therapy with resolution of the sleepiness and large gains in quality of
life. It is a sufﬁciently curious and initially uncomfortable therapy to require
a careful induction programme. Without this, the take-up and compliance
rates are poor. Most centres have found that a dedicated CPAP nurse or
technician is required. Many centres use special patient education aids, such
as video presentations, and provide help lines manned by previous patients
established on CPAP. The best method of establishing a patient on CPAP
and deriving the required mask pressure is not known, and many different
approaches appear to work. Recent innovations include CPAP machines that
automatically hunt for the required pressure, and do not require a formal
overnight titration with a technician present. New mask designs appear at
regular intervals with a slow improvement in their comfort and ﬁt (important to prevent air leaks). Patients require subsequent long-term follow-up
to maintain their CPAP equipment and attend to problems.
The commonest problems encountered include:
• Mouth leaks lead to increased air through the nose and out of the
mouth, with excessive drying of the mucosa, nasal congestion, rhinitis,
and sneezing. Use either a chin support to close the mouth or the addition of a heated humidiﬁer
• Pain and ulceration of the skin on the nasal bridge. Try different masks
or patient ‘interfaces’
• Claustrophobia. This usually settles but may require a different interface
• Temporary nasal congestion, usually during a cold. Try nasal decongestants for these short periods only, such as xylometazoline

Alternative diagnoses
Most patients who snore, are sleepy, and have an abnormal sleep study,
will have ordinary obstructive sleep apnoea and respond to nasal CPAP.
Sometimes, differentiating obstructive sleep apnoea from central apnoeas
(p 582) can be difﬁcult because some patients with Cheyne–Stokes
breathing, for example, may have a few obstructed breaths at the end of
each apnoeic cycle, even though the problem is primarily central. Poor
response to CPAP should at least prompt a reappraisal of the diagnosis.
Not all obstructive sleep apnoea is due to pharyngeal collapse; a very
small number of patients have laryngeal closure. This can occur with:
• Shy–Drager syndrome (multisystem atrophy). This causes laryngeal
abductor weakness with laryngeal closure during sleep, with stridulous
obstruction rather than the usual noise of snoring
• Rheumatoid arthritis can damage the larynx with resultant OSA
• Arnold–Chiari malformation can compress the brainstem and interfere
with the control of the larynx and pharynx, as well as the control of
ventilation, with mixed ﬁndings on the sleep study
• These forms of obstruction also respond to nasal CPAP therapy as the
larynx is also ‘blown open’ by raising airway pressure.

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

OSA: driving advice to patients
In UK law one is responsible for one’s vigilance levels while driving. We
know when we are sleepy and should stop driving. Driving while sleepy
has been likened to driving whilst drunk, and a prison sentence can result
from sleep-related accidents on the road. No one should drive while they
are sleepy, and the same applies to pathological causes of sleepiness.
Advice to all patients with OSA. Do not drive while sleepy; stop and have
a nap. On diagnosis, patients with OSA syndrome (i.e. with daytime hypersomnolence) should notify the DVLA who will send them a questionnaire.
If they admit to excessive daytime sleepiness their licence is revoked. If
already treated and the sleepiness has resolved, then the licence is not
revoked. It is the doctor’s duty to tell the patient of the diagnosis of OSAS
and of the requirement to inform the DVLA. Patients who are not sleepy
and only have OSA on their sleep study do not have OSA syndrome
(OSAS), and thus do not need to inform the DVLA. According to US
epidemiological studies, 1/20 men have OSA on a sleep study, which would
rather overwhelm the DVLA.
The doctor can advise the patient whether they should stop driving
entirely (wise if the patient is very sleepy and/or drives a heavy goods
vehicle or public service vehicle—class 2 licence holders), or to continue
driving only with extreme caution for short distances. The advice given to
the patient should be recorded in the notes.
Driving can be restarted as soon as the sleepiness has resolved and been
conﬁrmed by medical opinion, but in the case of class 2 licence holders the
success of the treatment must be veriﬁed by a specialist clinic. This means
a normal ESS and evidence of adequate nasal CPAP usage from the hour
metres built into most nasal CPAP machines. A minimum usage has not
been deﬁned, but 3 h per night on average is often the arbitrary threshold
used. Non-usage for even one night can lead to a return of sleepiness, so
patients have to continue to act responsibly.

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

OSA in children
Adult respiratory physicians interested in sleep apnoea may be asked to
investigate children with OSA due to poor sleep services for children.
• Mainly due to enlarged tonsils and adenoids; varying degrees of OSA
are present in up to 4% of children around the age of ﬁve; prevalence
tails off as tonsils atrophy
• These children present with snoring, restless sleep, and different
daytime symptoms to those of adults. Obvious sleepiness is less
common
• Sleep-deprived children tend to become hyperactive with reduced
attention spans, and be labelled as difﬁcult or disruptive
• Symptoms will ﬂuctuate with the size of the tonsils and this depends on
the presence of upper respiratory infections
• Mild intermittent sleep disturbance may not matter, but every-night
sleep fragmentation for months interferes with development in a
variety of ways
• The clinical decision is mainly whether to recommend removal of
tonsils, or a wait and see policy, remembering that there is a signiﬁcant
morbidity from adenotonsillectomy, and even the occasional death
• A halfway house is the use of nasal steroids, which can reduce tonsillar
size sufﬁciently to improve symptoms until natural tonsillar atrophy
occurs.

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

OSA: future developments
The old view that sleep apnoea requires polysomnography to diagnose
is rapidly being replaced with a more pragmatic and evidence-based
approach using simpler equipment. Simpler ways to establish patients on
CPAP are also evolving that will bring down costs further. Obesity surgery
is improving and in appropriate cases may become the treatment of choice.
Appetite suppressants are being developed that will greatly reduce the
prevalence of obesity and hence OSA. Pharmacological agents are being
tried that attempt to prevent the loss of tone in the pharyngeal dilators
during sleep, mainly serotonergic agents, although progress in this area
is slow (e.g. mirtazapine reduces OSA, but unfortunately causes sedation
and weight gain!). New pharyngeal operations are being devised all the
time, but none have been very effective when investigated properly: randomized controlled trials with objective outcome data are badly needed
in this area.
Whether OSA is truly an independent risk factor for vascular disease (e.g.
MI, strokes etc.) is hotly debated. Cross-sectional and non-randomized
data suggest so. However, it is difﬁcult to adequately control for confounding variables, such as visceral obesity, and non-randomized studies
carry important bias. RCTs show small beneﬁts to BP of treating OSA
with CPAP.

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

Central sleep apnoea (CSA) and
nocturnal hypoventilation
Deﬁnition and epidemiology ‘Central sleep apnoea/hypopnoea’, or
‘hypoventilation’, or ‘periodic breathing’ are said to occur when there is no
evidence of upper airway obstruction as the cause for the reduced ventilation during sleep. Compared with OSA it is much less common.
• Central sleep apnoea tends to be used as a term when there are actual
apnoeas, and referred to as Cheyne–Stokes breathing when there is
regular symmetrical waxing and waning, usually in the context of left
heart failure
• Periodic breathing is an alternative and can be used to describe regular
ﬂuctuations in breathing, with or without actual apnoeas
• The description nocturnal hypoventilation tends to be used when the
hypoventilation and hypoxaemic dips are not particularly periodic in
nature. However, these terms are imprecise and sometimes mixed
indiscriminately.

Pathophysiology
Central sleep apnoea, or hypoventilation, or periodic breathing, can occur
in a number of settings with different aetiologies (see also Chapter 15, p 92).
At one end of a spectrum is pure loss of ventilatory drive, while at the
other is pure loss of the ability to expand the chest adequately, with
dependence on accessory muscles of respiration. Many clinical presentations are mixtures of these two.
Patients with reduced ventilatory drive (e.g. following brainstem damage)
can often maintain adequate, or near adequate, ventilation whilst awake
as there is a non-metabolic ‘awake’ ventilatory drive equivalent to about
4 or 5 L/min. During non-REM sleep, this awake drive is lost and ventilation
becomes dependent on PaO2 and PaCO2. During REM sleep, an ‘awakelike’ drive sometimes returns partially and ventilation can improve again
(seen in congenital forms of absent drive where REM sleep can temporarily restore SaO2 levels).
In patients with impaired mechanical ability to ventilate, accessory muscles
of respiration become critically supportive (e.g. in many neuromuscular
disorders and obstructive/restrictive respiratory conditions). However,
during non-REM sleep, this reﬂex recruitment of accessory muscles is
attenuated and hypoventilation follows. During REM sleep the physiological paralysis of all postural muscles (REM atonia) can remove all compensatory mechanisms, leaving only the diaphragm working, and produce
profound hypoventilation or apnoea.
Chronic hypoventilation, often secondary to poor respiratory function
(e.g. as evidenced by CO2 retention in some patients with COPD or chest
wall restrictive disorders) can eventually force resetting of ventilatory
control mechanisms. This is an acquired blunting of ventilatory drive and
leads to sleep-related changes in ventilation, similar to those described in
the paragraphs above.

CENTRAL SLEEP APNOEA/NOCTURNAL HYPOVENTILATION

Unstable ventilatory control can lead to regular oscillations in ventilation,
e.g. as occurs in heart failure and at altitude. During REM sleep it is normal
to have ﬂuctuations in ventilation, sometimes with complete apnoeas.
Sometimes sleep studies can be misinterpreted and apnoeas, really of
obstructive origin, are mistakenly labelled as central. For example, if inspiratory muscles are very weak, their poor efforts during obstructive apnoeas
may be missed.

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

Causes and clinical features of CSA/
hypoventilation 1
Although there are many different causes, only four relatively common
clinical scenarios occur (but with overlap).

1. Absent or reduced ventilatory drive
Brainstem involvement from strokes, tumours, syringobulbia, surgical damage,
post-polio syndrome, congenital (Ondine’s curse—usually presents soon
after birth, can be later, abnormalities of neural crest development due
to increased number of ‘alanine repeats’ in one of the homeobox genes—
PHOX2B). Presents clinically with unexplained ventilatory failure, much
worse during sleep when the ‘awake’ drive is lost.
May be recognized early, cyanosis, morning confusion, ankle oedema.
May be recognized late, loss of consciousness and an emergency admission
to ITU for ventilation.
Lung function is often normal, with no evidence of respiratory muscle
weakness, indicating normal innervation from the voluntary motor system.
Arnold–Chiari malformation with brainstem compression can present like
this, but there is usually involvement of surrounding structures such as the
lower cranial motor nuclei supplying the larynx and pharynx (with associated obstructive sleep apnoea, p 570).
These patients will have no apparent neuromuscular or respiratory
cause for their hypoventilation, but may have a previous history of
brainstem stroke (or other form of brain damage). The congenital form
presents shortly after birth when the amount of REM sleep reduces and
is replaced by non-REM.
Post-polio syndrome is:
• Ill deﬁned syndrome—decline in function, decades after initial illness
• Return of weakness in previously affected areas (mechanism unclear)
• Late development of ventilatory failure is more likely if:
• Inspiratory muscles were affected in the original illness
• Additional scoliosis due to paravertebral muscle involvement (in
which case vital capacity will be reduced)
This may be due to premature ageing of the upper and lower motor
neurons due to their ‘over-use’. This could follow the original destruction
of some of the anterior horn cells to the inspiratory muscles, and the subsequent reinnervation by surviving neurons which then have to continuously supply more neurons than they were ‘designed’ for.

2. Weak or mechanically disadvantaged inspiratory muscles
with/without secondary reduction of awake ventilatory drive
Neuromuscular inspiratory muscle weakness will produce diurnal ventilatory failure in its own right, particularly when the supine vital capacity falls
below 20% predicted (approximately 1 L).
With increasing inspiratory muscle weakness, other accessory inspiratory muscles are recruited to maintain ventilation. When this is lost during
non-REM sleep, and more so during REM sleep, ventilation will fall much

CAUSES AND CLINICAL FEATURES OF CSA/HYPOVENTILATION 1

more than in normal subjects. Whilst metabolic ventilatory drive is
reasonably preserved, this will result in recurrent arousals to ‘rescue’ the
ventilation and consequent marked sleep disturbance.
As ventilatory drive becomes progressively blunted, following the hypoventilation forced on the system by weak muscles, extra sleep hypoventilation (from loss of ‘awake’ drive) is tolerated and profound hypoxaemia is
observed until there is ﬁnally an arousal that recovers the ventilation and
SaO2.
The above patients should have a history of a progressive neuromuscular disorder.
Chest wall restrictive diseases, such as scoliosis or post-thoracoplasty patients
(p 579), can behave in a similar way with gradual onset of ventilatory
failure, particularly when vital capacity <1 L. The muscles are not weak,
but operating at severe mechanical disadvantage.
The same situation occurs in COPD, when muscles are overloaded and
accessory muscles provide important support, but this too is reduced with
non-REM sleep and lost during REM sleep. Again, any secondary reduction
in ventilatory drive ampliﬁes the sleep-related falls in SaO2.
• Chest wall restrictive patients should have an obvious restrictive disorder with reduced VC to 1 L or below
• Increasing degrees of COPD will produce increasing degrees of sleep
hypoventilation (p 581)
• If the awake SaO2 is already low the sleep-related falls in ventilation will
produce dramatic dips in SaO2
• COPD and OSA together (overlap syndrome, p 570) provoke profound nocturnal hypoxic dipping (p 581), and probably a more rapid
progression to diurnal hypoventilation with CO2 retention, due to
extra blunting of ventilatory drive (see p 570).
The diaphragm is the only respiratory muscle working during REM sleep,
as all other postural muscles are profoundly hypotonic
• If the diaphragm is paralysed, then REM sleep is a particularly vulnerable time as there are no muscles of ventilation left working, producing
particularly profound falls in SaO2 during this period
• Patients with bilateral diaphragm weakness can present early with no
obvious weakness elsewhere. Diaphragm weakness is best detected
with the patient supine. Inspiration, particularly on snifﬁng, will provoke
a paradoxical indrawing of the abdominal wall. The vital capacity will
also fall on lying down, increasingly with greater degrees of paralysis
(often a >30% fall in VC with complete paralysis).
In a progressive neuromuscular disorder, such as motor neuron disease,
the above patterns will be variable between individuals, but will gradually
worsen. Predominant diaphragm weakness, as occurs sometimes in motor
neuron disease, spinal muscular atrophy, and particularly acid maltase
deﬁciency, can lead to ventilatory failure at a time when the patient is still
ambulant.

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

Causes and clinical features of CSA/
hypoventilation 2
3. Cheyne–Stokes breathing associated with LVF (p 575)
The raised left atrial pressure in left heart failure increases ventilatory
drive through stimulation of J receptors. This is in addition to ventilatory
stimulation due to any hypoxaemia from pulmonary oedema.
• This ventilatory stimulation lowers the awake PaCO2 producing a respiratory alkalosis
• In addition the use of diuretics may produce a mild metabolic alkalosis,
especially if there is hypokalaemia
• This extra J receptor ventilatory stimulation appears to reduce at sleep
onset. This, together with the loss of the awake ventilatory drive, allows
central hypoventilation or apnoea to occur
• This hypoventilation or apnoea will continue until the PaCO2 builds
up to drive ventilation again, or until the attendant hypoxaemia causes
arousal
• The return of ventilation itself may provoke arousal too. The arousal
itself then injects increased ventilatory drive, reducing the PaCO2 again
• Sleep returns, and once again the low PaCO2 and alkalosis cause
hypoventilation or apnoea
Thus a cycle is maintained that involves a ﬂuctuating sleep state with
arousals, and usually a ﬂuctuating SaO2. As with OSA, the patient may be
completely unaware of these arousals. The delayed circulatory time of left
heart failure may compound this instability by introducing a time delay
between any change in PaCO2 in the blood leaving the lungs and its arrival
at the carotid body or central chemoreceptors.

4. Cheyne–Stokes breathing associated with altitude
The acute hypoxia following ascent to altitude provokes increased ventilation. The degree is variable between individuals and hence the degree of
hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis varies (see p 238). With sleep onset,
with a lessening of the hypoxic drive, and removal of the awake drive, an
uncompensated alkalosis will allow hypoventilation and even apnoea—
similar to the situation described above for Cheyne–Stokes breathing. Again,
ventilation will restart either when the PaCO2 rises to a critical level, or the
hypoxia provokes arousal. Sleep is fragmented with complaints of insomnia,
but the cause of this is rarely recognized by the sufferer.
Skiing in Colorado, altitude 2400–3400 m (710,000 f), is high enough
to provoke signiﬁcant periodic breathing in about a ﬁfth of individuals.
It seems that this ﬁfth are the ones with the highest hypoxic ventilatory
response. This gives them the largest respiratory alkalosis and hence the
greatest tendency to sleep onset hypoventilation. In addition the tendency
to arouse with the resultant extra hypoxaemia may be greater too, thus
provoking large increases in ventilation on arousal and greater sleep disturbance. As the kidney excretes extra bicarbonate and produces a compensatory metabolic acidosis over a few days, the periodic breathing lessens.

CAUSES AND CLINICAL FEATURES OF CSA/HYPOVENTILATION 2

Two pharmacological approaches have been taken to reduce this sleeprelated periodic breathing.
• Pre-acclimatization with acetazolamide prior to ascent. This produces
a mild metabolic acidosis and maintains the ventilatory drive at sleep
onset, thus blocking the hypoventilation. Randomized controlled trials
show the efﬁcacy of this approach with doses between 250 and
500 mg/day, 1–3 days prior to ascent
• Hypnotics, such as temazepam, can reduce the degree of periodic
breathing by reducing the tendency to arousal with each return of
ventilation, and thus damping the system. Randomized trials suggest
beneﬁt for the early part of the night, with no impairment of nocturnal
hypoxaemia or daytime functioning.
See also pp 238–39 (altitude sickness).

587

588

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

CSA/hypoventilation: investigations
Simple pulmonary function tests will characterize weakness of inspiratory
muscles. Supine vital capacity is the best predictor of ventilatory failure as
it incorporates diaphragm weakness that is masked during erect testing.
Blood gases will reveal actual diurnal type II ventilatory failure and, if the
base excess is raised with a normal PaCO2 (therefore, a mild metabolic
alkalosis), then this may indicate nocturnal hypoventilation and incipient
ventilatory failure.

Sleep study
Examples on p 575, 579, 581.
Sleep studies in patients with suspected nocturnal hypoventilation or
central sleep apnoea are required to conﬁrm the diagnosis and to assess
the degree of nocturnal hypoxaemia. Limited sleep studies will reveal falls
in SaO2 in association with hypoventilation, but no evidence of obstruction and, in particular, no snoring. Oximetry tracings alone will show a
variety of patterns, often resembling OSA. The pattern in neuromuscular
weakness will vary from oscillations all the time (due to recurrent arousal)
to just REM sleep-related dips in SaO2. The same will be true for chest
wall restrictive disorders and COPD with only REM dips occurring initially,
and more extensive hypoxaemia developing once there is an element of
CO2 retention and diurnal hypoxaemia.
• In OSA there is a slow fall in SaO2 as oxygen is gradually removed
from the lung stores, followed by a rapid rise engendered by the ﬁrst
deep inspiration as the apnoea breaks (so-called saw tooth pattern),
p 571
• In Cheyne–Stokes of left heart failure the oscillations in SaO2 are often
more sinusoidal than in OSA as the pattern of breathing is usually more
a symmetrical waxing and waning of ventilation, p 575. However, if each
central apnoea is terminated by an arousal, rather than a smooth return
of ventilation, then the pattern will look more like OSA.
In COPD, the degree of hypoxaemia on the sleep study will depend very
much on the awake SaO2. Because of the shape of the haemoglobin dissociation curve, a low awake SaO2 makes it easier for the SaO2 to fall further
with a given reduction in ventilation. Thus during non-REM, with removal
of awake drive, there will be a fairly stable reduction in SaO2, but during
REM sleep there will be further more dramatic dips. It is important not to
diagnose OSA from just an oximetry tracing on the basis of SaO2 oscillations in the presence of a low baseline SaO2 and COPD. In this situation
a fuller sleep study is required to provide evidence of additional upper
airway obstruction. The combination of hypoxic COPD and OSA can
produce particularly dramatic traces (p 581).

Management Intervention in central sleep apnoea or hypoventilation or
periodic breathing, depends on symptoms. Better control of heart failure
may improve Cheyne–Stokes breathing, but often does not. Further
treatment will be required for two reasons: either to prevent the cyclical
breathing and restore sleep quality, or to globally improve ventilation overnight and reset the respiratory control mechanisms such that the daytime
respiratory failure reverses.

CSA/HYPOVENTILATION: INVESTIGATIONS

In situations where the hypoxia is playing a part in the pathogenesis
(e.g. heart failure) then raising FiO2 can help. There is limited literature
on other forms of treatment for the Cheyne–Stokes of heart failure,
although acetazolamide and benzodiazepines have been tried. The
unstable breathing in heart failure has been treated with CPAP, however
a large RCT has not conﬁrmed long-term beneﬁt. More recently, treatment has been tried with specially designed servo ventilators, but whether
these will provide better relief of symptoms than oxygen is not yet clear,
but preliminary evidence suggests they might. There is some data to
suggest that the recurrent arousal in Cheynes–Stokes may raise catecholamine levels and provoke deterioration of left ventricular function. Thus,
measures to reduce the arousals may improve cardiac function as well as
improve daytime vigilance.
Sedatives are contraindicated with a raised PaCO2, and extra oxygen
may increase the hypercapnia. In these situations, then overnight noninvasive ventilation, via either nose or face mask, may be appropriate. In
slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders, with either sleep fragmentation or diurnal type II respiratory failure (or both), the symptomatic and
physiological response can be dramatic. The use of non-invasive ventilation
in more rapidly progressive disorders is fraught with potential difﬁculties
and is very much a specialist decision. Increasing dependence on equipment, not designed to be immediately life-sustaining, being a particular
issue. In scoliosis there is rarely any question that treatment might not be
appropriate, and again responses are dramatic.

Future developments
• Treatment of LVF (acute and chronic, no evidence yet for the latter)
with overnight CPAP or non-invasive ventilation
• Introduction of overnight ventilation earlier in the course of a progressive neuromuscular disorder (such as motor neurone disease) to
reduce symptoms and possibly prolong life
• Use of overnight ventilation on patients with stable COPD and hypercapnia. This may reduce exacerbations, hospital admissions, and prolong
life. The evidence is inadequate yet to justify its wide use in this patient
group.

CHAPTER 47

Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation

Obesity-related respiratory problems
Levels of obesity (BMI>30) are rising in all ‘civilized’ societies. In 1993, 13%
of men and 17% of women in the UK (21% and 26% in the USA) had a
BMI >30. In 2000 this was 21% and 22% in the UK (29% and 36% in the USA).
This also has had many impacts on health care outside of respiratory medicine, particularly the components of the metabolic syndrome.
Obesity, particularly in conjunction with OSA and COPD, provokes ventilatory failure and cor pulmonale (see p 93). A common clinical scenario
is the obese smoker, with a history of snoring and sleepiness, arriving in
A&E with hypercapnia.
In addition to apportioning the relative contribution of obesity, COPD,
and OSA to the hypercapnia, and treating accordingly, there are other
obesity-related factors to consider:• Intubation The best predictor of a problematic intubation are neck
circumference and a Mallampati score of 3 or more
• Tracheostomy tubes are often too short and too curved to cope with
the increased distance between skin and trachea; tubes with adjustable
ﬂanges that allow customized intra tracheal lengths are useful here
• Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy is more difﬁcult and may have a
higher complication rate
• Low FRCs mean that the oxygen stores are limited, leading to rapid
falls in SaO2 during apnoeas of any cause
• Abdominal loading of the diaphragm is increased, but the extra work of
breathing can be reduced considerably by tilting the whole bed, head
up, by as much as 20–30°.
• Abdominal loading of the diaphragm reduces basal lung expansion.
Resultant basal atelectasis increases the A–a gradient. Raising the endexpiratory pressure during either invasive or non-invasive ventilation
improves this
• Abdominal loading may increase perioperative risk of aspiration
• DVTs and pulmonary emboli are probably more common in the obese.
It is not clear if DVT prophylaxis regimes need to be modiﬁed. Some
recommend higher doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH),
and this higher dose is more effective in patients undergoing bariatric
surgery. Weight-based regimes of LMWH for the treatment of DVT
and emboli appear satisfactory in the morbidly obese (BMI>40).
• Increased likelihood of failure to wean: non-invasive ventilation (inspiratory pressure 12, expiratory 4 cmH2O) has been shown to aid weaning,
post-open gastric-bypass surgery for obesity.
• Possible build-up of sedating anaesthetic agents in fat leading to prolonged half-life.

CHAPTER 48

Toxic agents

CHAPTER 48

Toxic agents

Drug-induced lung disease: examples 1
Amiodarone Iodinated benzofuran used to suppress supra- and ventricular tachycardias. Lung toxicity correlates loosely with total dose and
therefore usually occurs after a variable number of months. Seen in 10% of
subjects on >400 mg/day. Rare if <300 mg/day.
Risk factors
• Daily dose >400 mg
• Increasing age of patient
• Use for more than 2 months
• Pre-existing lung disease (although not a contraindication to its use)
• Recent surgical intervention or lung infection.
Diagnosis is usually one of exclusion, and response to cessation of drug
(which can take months). Inﬁltrative lung disease varying from acute
respiratory distress (rare) through to COP (cough, pleuritic pain, fever,
dyspnoea, asymmetric patchy inﬁltrates, effusion), and the most indolent,
chronic interstitial pneumonitis (cough, dyspnoea, weight loss, diffuse and/
or focal opacities).
On CT the liver, thyroid, and lungs will usually show increased attenuation, indicating a signiﬁcant amiodarone load. A baseline CXR is useful.
Lung biopsies exclude other diagnoses and provide compatible ﬁndings,
but there is dissent as to how diagnostic they are (except for the ﬁnding of
foamy macrophages in the airspaces, ﬁlled with amiodarone–phospholipid
complexes, but may occur in absence of lung toxicity). Mechanisms of
toxicity are unclear, and there are features to suggest hypersensitivity and
direct toxic damage.
Treatment Steroids are effective and required in severe disease. The halflife of amiodarone in the tissues is in excess of a month and response to
stopping the drug may be slow. Prognosis is good in the majority.

Anti-TNF agents (inﬂiximab and etanercept) represent a large step
forward in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease.
However, there is a small but important risk of reactivating TB, commonly
extrapulmonary - see p 512. Pneumonia and development of antibodies
are also more common; SLE develops only rarely.
Azathioprine Extensively used as an immunosuppressant but has
remarkably little pulmonary toxicity other than via opportunistic lung
infection. Case reports of pneumonitis only.
Bleomycin DNA-damaging glycopeptide used in the treatment of lymphomas, germ cell tumours, squamous carcinomas (cervix, head, neck, and
oesophagus). Pulmonary ﬁbrosis occurs in about 10%.
Risk factors
• Older age
• Those receiving total dose of >300,000 international units (1000 international units [or 1 old/USB unit] = 1.5-2.0 mgs)
• Increased FiO2, probably via increased superoxide/free radical formation. Pneumonitis may be precipitated by supplementary oxygen for
some time after drug administration—warn anaesthetist if surgery

DRUG-INDUCED LUNG DISEASE: EXAMPLES 1

planned in patients who have received bleomycin in previous
6-12 months
• Pulmonary irradiation, not just in the irradiated ﬁeld
• Renal failure decreases drug elimination and thus toxicity
• Associated use of cyclophosphamide.
Symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, chest pain, fever) develop 1–6 months after
bleomycin. There is hypoxia and a restrictive defect. Progressive basal subpleural shadowing, small lungs, and blunting of costophrenic angles.
Histology shows a dominant subpleural distribution of damage and repair
with ﬁbrosis; this appearance is non-diagnostic and common to many
drugs/disorders. Toxicity is probably due to DNA damage or oxidative
injury, with interindividual variation occurring due to differing activity of
the enzyme bleomycin hydrolase; only low levels of this enzyme exist in
the lung (and skin). A rare acute hypersensitivity form comes on within
days of administration. Other unusual presentations include pulmonary
nodules or organizing pneumonia.
Treatment
• Bleomycin must be stopped on suspicion of damage, and some units
use lung function tests (kCO) to detect early damage
• Steroids are used, but there is little evidence they alter long-term prognosis (in the acute hypersensitivity subgroup there is a clear beneﬁcial
effect)
• Use the minimum FiO2 to maintain an adequate SaO2 (85-90%)
• Over 50% may experience a relentless decline in lung function.

Busulphan DNA alkylating, myelosuppressive, agent mainly used to
treat chronic myeloid leukaemia, and prior to bone marrow transplantation, with a low rate of lung toxicity (4–10%) due to ﬁbrosis.
Risk factors
• Cumulative doses over 500 mg (mostly over 120 days)
• Concurrent administration of other alkylating agents
• Pulmonary irradiation.
Presents with cough and progressive SOB, often years after exposure
(usually about 4). CXR is typically unremarkable. Reduced kCO and
restrictive defect. Diagnosis is usually by exclusion. The place of steroids
is unproven.

Chlorambucil DNA alkylating agent mainly used to treat chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphomas, and ovarian cancer. It has additional
immunosuppressive actions, and is also used in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Low risk (1%) of pulmonary toxicity and conﬁned to those
who have received >2 grams. Similarly to busulphan, presentation may be
many years later. Presents with cough, dyspnoea, weight loss, and basal
crackles. CXR shows diffuse basal reticular shadowing. Non-speciﬁc histology. On suspicion, chlorambucil should be stopped; use of steroids is
unproven. Prognosis is poor (50% fatal).

597

598

CHAPTER 48

Toxic agents

Drug-induced lung disease: examples 2
Cyclophosphamide DNA alkylating agent mainly used to treat chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia, small cell lung cancer, and other solid tumours.
Particularly useful as an immunosuppressive agent in certain vasculitides
and nephropathies. Lung toxicity is rare.
Risk factors
• Pulmonary irradiation
• Oxygen therapy
• Concurrent drugs causing pulmonary toxicity, e.g. bleomycin.
Clinical presentation is usually within 6 months, with a short duration of
fever, cough, and fatigue. Reticular shadowing with ground-glass appearance
on CT. Later onset progressive pulmonary ﬁbrosis can also develop insidiously in those on therapy for many months with progressive SOB and dry
cough. The histology of the more acute type can be similar to any of the
acute interstitial pneumonias (e.g. COP, diffuse alveolar damage), whereas
the more chronic form is indistinguishable from UIP. Cyclophosphamide
is not itself toxic to the lung, but its metabolites are. There appears to be
genetic variation to susceptibility, as there is no obvious dose–response
relationship. Cessation of drug and steroid therapy is used successfully in
the acute form, but the chronic form seems to progress inexorably, in a
similar manner to UIP. Lung transplantation is an option. Note increased
risk of PCP whilst taking cyclophosphamide.

Gold Used in rheumatoid arthritis, >500 mg cumulative dose can produce
pneumonitis (possibly COP, obliterative bronchiolitis) with cough, dyspnoea, and basal crackles. Rare (1%), but associated with certain HLA types
and distinctive histological feature of alveolar septal inﬂammation. Good
prognosis following drug cessation; poor evidence for steroids.
Methotrexate Folic acid derivative, inhibiting cell division by blocking
dihydrofolate reductase and nucleic acid production. Mainly used in
leukaemia and as an immunosuppressive, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and
psoriasis. Commonly (4–10%) causes a variety of lung pathologies, not
associated with folic acid deﬁciency.
Risk factors
• Hypoalbuminaemia
• Diabetes
• Previous use of drugs that modify disease progress in rheumatoid
• Rheumatoid or other lung/pleural disease
• Not particularly dose-related; can occur at doses of <20 mg per week
• Daily rather than intermittent (weekly) therapy
• >60 years.
Presents both acutely (interstitial pneumonitis, fever, and eosinophilia) and
over very long time periods; however, the subacute form (within a year, dyspnoea, fever, cough, hypoxia, basal crackles, restrictive defect, and reduced
kCO) is commoner. Bilateral diffuse pulmonary inﬁltrates or mixed pattern
with alveolar shadowing on CXR, occasional effusions.

DRUG-INDUCED LUNG DISEASE: EXAMPLES 2

Histology more useful than in other drug toxicities, shows alveolitis, interstitial pneumonitis, epithelial cell hyperplasia, eosinophilic inﬁltration, and
granuloma formation in the more acute, hypersensitivity, form, and more
UIP-like changes in indolent form. Mechanism of damage unknown but
likely to be multifactorial.
Treatment consists of drug withdrawal and unproven use of steroids.
Anecdotal reports support use of steroids in the more acute, hypersensitivity form. Other methotrexate-related lung diseases include opportunistic lung infection (including PCP) and non-Hodgkin’s B-cell lymphoma,
which may regress with drug withdrawal, and may be associated with
Epstein–Barr virus.

Nitrofurantoin is used commonly for long-term prophylaxis against
urinary tract infections (UTIs). Acutely nitrofurantoin causes a hypersensitivity vasculitis, and, much less frequently, a chronic interstitial ﬁbrosis.
Most patients are women due to their much higher prevalence of chronic
UTIs. The acute form presents abruptly with fever, dyspnoea, dry cough,
rash, chest pain, hypoxia, crackles, and eosinophilia within a week or two
of starting, and is dose-independent. Lower zone diffuse patchy inﬁltrates
and sometimes unilateral effusions on CXR. Lung biopsy reveals vasculitis, eosinophilia, reactive type II pneumocytes, focal haemorrhage, and
some interstitial inﬂammation. Treatment consists of discontinuation and
improvement begins rapidly. Prognosis is good with or without steroids.
Oxygen Prolonged 80–100% oxygen therapy can provoke lung damage.
Penicillamine Used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, penicillamine may increase the prevalence of obliterative bronchiolitis. This
is dose-related but rare, with a subacute onset (after several months) of
dyspnoea and cough. There is a progressive obstructive pattern without
bronchodilator response. 50% mortality.

Sulphasalazine Used extensively in treatment of inﬂammatory bowel
disease (mainly ulcerative colitis). Rarely causes side effects but can cause
new onset dyspnoea and pulmonary inﬁltrates after any period of use.
Cough, fever, lung crackles and blood eosinophilia is the usual presentation. Prior allergy history, rash and weight loss also seen with eosinophilic
pneumonia the usual pathology. Withdrawal of drugs is usually successful
within weeks, and recovery can be hastened by steroids. Rare deaths when
the histology is more like usual interstitial pneumonitis and may be more
related to the condition requiring sulphasalazine.

Talc is commonly used for pleurodesis (p 776). Talc particles may be small
enough to enter the circulation after intrapleural instillation, being found
throughout the body at post mortem. They appear to provoke a systemic
reaction with fever, raised inﬂammatory markers, and hypoxia suggestive
of an ARDS-like pathology. Occasional deaths after talc pleurodesis have
been reported. Reﬁned talc with fewer smaller particles seems less toxic.

CHAPTER 48

Toxic agents

Paraquat poisoning
Deﬁnitions
Paraquat (Weedol®, Pathclear®, Gramoxone®) and related bipyridyl compounds are used as contact herbicides. They kill plants by inhibiting NADP
reduction during photosynthesis, which involves the production of superoxide radicals. The toxicity of paraquat in animals is also believed to be due
to the production of damaging superoxides. Most cases of poisoning are
deliberate, and the treatment should be commenced as soon as possible.
Serious poisoning is usually by ingestion (although paraquat is absorbed
through the skin and mucous membranes, including the conjunctiva and
bronchial mucosa).
• More than 6 g is always fatal
• Less than 1.5 g is rarely fatal
• Between 1.5 and 6 g, the mortality is 60–70%
• A mouthful of 20% Gramoxone® liquid (10 g/50 mL) is almost certainly
fatal
• Less than 1 sachet of Weedol® granules (1.4 g paraquat/57 g sachet) is
unlikely to cause death
• Usually fatal if blood level >0.2 mg/mL at 24 h.

Clinical features
• Oral and oesophageal ulceration shortly after contact, with later formation of a pseudomembrane
• Renal failure (reversible) within a few days, but delayed excretion of
paraquat prevents falls in blood levels
• Pulmonary oedema early on, evolving into ‘acute respiratory distress
syndrome’
• Death usually occurs within 1 to 2 weeks
• Pulmonary ﬁbrosis if the patient survives, with varying degrees of
recovery.

22 Management
• Gastric lavage with Fuller’s earth/bentonite/activated charcoal/
sodium resonium to reduce absorption
• Haemoperfusion (haemodialysis less effective) to reduce blood levels
• Lowest inspired oxygen tension possible (high concentrations probably increase superoxide formation)
• Supportive measures which may require intubation and ventilation
• Other treatments (e.g. immunosuppression, NO) are experimental.

RADIATION-INDUCED PULMONARY DISEASE

Radiation-induced pulmonary disease
Manifestations of lung injury following radiotherapy include:

Radiation pneumonitis
• Often asymptomatic, although may cause dyspnoea and chronic ventilatory failure
• Radiographic abnormalities more common than clinical disease.
Characteristically straight margins on CT inﬁltrate
• Pathological feature is of diffuse alveolar damage, with vascular intimal
ﬁbrosis
• Typically follows lung radiotherapy
• Treatment of symptomatic disease is with steroids (1mg/kg daily),
although minimal evidence to support their use. Amifostine or pentoxifylline (used in the treatment of extrapulmonary manifestations of
radiation-induced tissue damage) may be of beneﬁt, although unproven.

Radiation-induced organizing pneumonia
• Often presents with cough (rather than breathlessness, which is more
suggestive of radiation pneumonitis)
• Characterized by migratory patchy consolidation which always extends
beyond radiation ﬁeld on CT
• Typically follows breast radiotherapy
• Treatment is with steroids; often long courses are needed. Macrolides
may have a role.

Radiation-induced chronic eosinophilic pneumonia
• Possible association; few cases reported.

Toxic agents

Inhalational lung injury 1
Deﬁnition Agents damaging the lung and airways through direct toxicity. Much of the acute damage is common to many toxic agents including
pneumonitis/pulmonary oedema, mucosal damage/sloughing/airway debris.
Secondary infection is common due to breached defences.

Following acute exposure, supportive therapy is critical
Look for respiratory failure, stridor, or distress; may occur hours later
CXR (poor sensitivity until pulmonary oedema develops)
May need intubating/tracheostomy to bypass oedematous and
sloughing upper airway mucosa
Humidiﬁed oxygen:
• Raise SaO2 into low/mid 90s (higher levels may contribute to
oxidative damage)
• Raise PaO2 as high as possible if CO poisoning suspected
Treat cyanide poisoning if suspected (dicobalt edetate, little evidence)
Bronchodilators
Nebulized dilute heparin/acetylcysteine—variable opinions on value
Steroids and prophylactic antibiotics—variable opinions on value
Mechanical ventilation (low volume/pressure, permissive hypercapnia)
Fluid replacement, but not excessive as encourages pulmonary
oedema
Enteral feeding.

CHAPTER 48

Toxic agents

Carbon monoxide poisoning
Deﬁnition and epidemiology
• Carbon monoxide is a colourless odourless gas formed when carbon
compounds burn in limited oxygen
• It accounts for about 75 deaths per year in the UK, approximately 10%
of which are accidental
• Accidental poisonings are commoner in the winter when faulty heating
systems are in use
• Non-accidental deaths are mainly from car exhaust fumes
• Methylene chloride (industrial solvent, paint remover) is converted to
CO in the liver and may present as CO poisoning
• Up to one-third die following acute high level exposure and another
third may be left with permanent neurological sequelae
• Chronic low-grade CO exposure may present as non-speciﬁc ill health
and may affect thousands of individuals.

Pathophysiology and related conditions
• Carbon monoxide competes avidly with O2 (250 times greater) to
bind with the iron in haemoglobin, making it less available for oxygen
carriage
• The haemoglobin molecule is also distorted by combination with CO
that makes it bind more tightly to O2, shifting the O2 dissociation curve
to the left. The PaO2 at which the haemoglobin is 50% saturated (P50)
moves from about 3.5 to 2 kPa
• This further reduces oxygen delivery to the tissues: a 50% carboxyhaemoglobin level is far more dangerous than a 50% anaemia
• CO also binds to extravascular molecules such as myoglobin and some
of the cytochrome chain proteins interfering with energy production,
and in this respect is like cyanide
• Normal levels of carboxyhaemoglobin can be up to 3%, and up to 15%
in heavy smokers
• Fetal haemoglobin combines even more avidly with CO; thus the fetus
is especially vulnerable to CO poisoning of the mother.
Methaemoglobin
• Methaemoglobin is due to oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ thus preventing
O2 carriage. This is due either to inherited deﬁciencies of enzymes
(cytochrome b5 reductase) that reduce the Fe3+ back to Fe2+, or toxic
agents (e.g. nitrites (in ‘poppers’), chloroquine) that overwhelm this
reversal mechanism
• Methaemoglobin is slightly left shifted, but a 40% methaemoglobinaemia
may be asymptomatic apart from the typical grey/blue colour of the
patient, often mistaken for cyanosis.

CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING

Clinical features of CO poisoning
Immediate
• Nausea, headache, malaise, weakness, and unsteadiness
• Loss of consciousness, seizures, cardiac abnormalities (ischaemia,
arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema)
• No cyanosis, healthy looking ‘cherry red’ colour
• Suspect if several members of household present with these features
Delayed (approximately 1 to 3 weeks, can be longer)
• Cognitive defects and personality changes
• Focal neurology and movement abnormalities

Investigations
• Pulse oximetry will appear normal due to COHb having similar absorption spectra to oxyhaemoglobin
• Arterial PaO2 levels may be normal
• COHb levels can be measured on a Co-oximeter
• Breath CO measured with devices used for smoking cessation work
• Routine tests to rule out other diagnoses.

22 Management of CO poisoning
• CO is only removed from the body through displacement by O2;
therefore use high concentrations of oxygen, e.g. via CPAP masks
(p 732)
• Raise the PaO2 as high as possible, intubate and 100% O2 if necessary
• The half-life of COHb breathing air is about 6 h; breathing 100% O2
it is about 1 h
• Hyperbaric O2 more rapidly displaces CO and increases dissolved
O2. Reduces the frequency of delayed neurological symptoms from
46% to 25% following signiﬁcant exposure in one randomized controlled trial, but needs to be instituted early. Still controversial, recent
Cochrane report equivocal, and facilities poorly available.

Future developments Isocapnic hyperpnoea may further raise the
PaO2. Alkalosis must be avoided though, to prevent further left shift of
the Hb dissociation curve. Can be done voluntarily with 5% CO2 in O2 or
during intubation. Can double rate of CO elimination.

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

British Orphan Lung Disease
(BOLD) project
The British Orphan Lung Disease (BOLD) register was set up by the
British Thoracic Society in 2001 to facilitate research into rare lung diseases and improve clinicians’ knowledge of these conditions. It also aimed
to help establish patient support groups.
In continental Europe there have been registers of rare lung diseases
for many years. The term ‘orphan’ lung disease was coined because of
the feeling that these diseases have, in the past, tended to be neglected
because of their rarity, the limited knowledge of the conditions, and the
limited available data on which to base practice.
The reporting system works via a web-based registration form, where
consultants are encouraged to enter details of patients with any of the
listed conditions. The data is anonymized, and the patient must sign a form
(found on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk in the members
only section) consenting for their details to be held on a central database.
Interested parties are invited to submit research proposals, for which the
collected data will be used.

The BOLD register collects data on:

ALVEOLAR MICROLITHIASIS

Alveolar microlithiasis
This is a rare interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology, characterized
by the accumulation of numerous and diffuse calciﬁed microliths (calcium
and phosphate hydroxyapatite bodies) in the alveolar space. There is no
identiﬁable abnormality of calcium metabolism. Microliths are occasionally
identiﬁed in the sputum. At post mortem the lungs are heavy and rock
hard, often needing a saw to cut them. Fewer than 200 cases are reported.

Clinical features
• Typically presents in young adults, most commonly in the third and
fourth decades of life
• May be an incidental CXR ﬁnding in asymptomatic patients
• Familial tendency—probable autosomal recessive inheritance
• Equal sex distribution in sporadic cases, 2:1 female preponderance in
familial cases
• Usually slowly progressive, with progressive breathlessness, hypoxia,
respiratory failure, and death
• CXR and chest CT show ﬁne micronodular lung calciﬁcation, predominantly basally or around the hila. It may produce complete radiographic opaciﬁcation. There is no associated lymph node enlargement.
Progressive lung inﬁltration causes restriction of lung movement and
impairs gas exchange, leading to progressive respiratory failure.

Treatment
• There is no effective medical treatment
• Lung transplantation has been successful.

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

Amyloidosis: pathophysiology and
classiﬁcation
Deﬁnition Amyloidosis is the extracellular deposition of low molecular
weight protein molecules as insoluble ﬁbrils. More than 20 such proteins
have been described in different diseases and circumstances.
Pathophysiology The disease is one of abnormal protein folding, and
is classiﬁed by the origin of the precursor proteins that form the amyloid.
For example, AL amyloid forms from the light chains of immunoglobulins.
In familial forms, genetic missense mutations produce abnormal folding
of the protein. Little is known of the speciﬁc genetic and environmental
factors that lead to the development of this abnormal folding. Despite their
different origins, these protein molecules fold into alternative forms that
are very similar to each other: in the classic ‘B-pleated sheet’ structure,
ﬁbrils form in an ordered fashion, with uniformity of ﬁbril structure within
the sheet. Substitutions of particular amino acids at speciﬁc positions in
the light-chain variable region lead to destabilization of the light chains,
increasing the chance of ﬁbrillogenesis. In certain models, this abnormal
folding can be initiated by the addition of ‘amyloid enhancing factor’, rather
like the initiation of crystal formation in a supersaturated solution. Amyloid
deposits accumulate in the extracellular space, disrupting normal tissue
architecture and leading to organ dysfunction, both directly, and having
space-occupying effects. The ﬁbrils may be directly cytotoxic (possibly by
promoting apoptosis). The subdivisions of amyloid are largely based on the
origin of the amyloid protein and shown in the box opposite.

Epidemiology The epidemiology is difﬁcult to deﬁne accurately as the
disease is often un- or misdiagnosed. The age-adjusted incidence is estimated
to be 5.1–12.8 per million person years.
Future developments Anti-amyloid drugs are under investigation,
including drugs to stabilize the amyloid precursor proteins in their normal
conﬁguration and enhance ﬁbril degradation.

AMYLOIDOSIS: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION

Classiﬁcation of amyloidosis
• Primary/light chain amyloid (AL), from immunoglobulin light chain
fragments (λ or κ), usually monoclonal due to a plasma cell dyscrasia
(a subtype of lymphoproliferative disorders)
• 1 in 5000 deaths due to this type of amyloid
• Median survival is 6–15 months
• Frank myeloma is present in 20%, and a subtle monoclonal gammopathy in 70% (MGUS)
• Systemic form due to circulating monoclonal light chains, widespread organ involvement, particularly heart, liver, and kidneys
• Localized amyloid production by local clonal B cells; hence
heterogeneous organ involvement is seen, commonly in the upper
respiratory tract and orbit, with urogenital and gastrointestinal
involvement—virtually any organ (except the brain) can be
involved
• Secondary amyloid (AA)
• A complication of chronic disease with ongoing/recurring inﬂammation, e.g. rheumatoid, chronic infections
• The ﬁbrils are fragments of acute phase reactant, serum amyloid A
• Commonly renal, hepatic, and lower GI involvement, rarely neurological, lung, and cardiac involvement
• Median survival 5 years
• Only a small number of patients with chronic inﬂammation will
develop AA amyloidosis, and the time period for the development
of the disease is very variable
• Dialysis-related amyloid (DA), due to ﬁbrils derived from B2 microglobulin that accumulate in dialysis patients
• Inherited amyloidosis, e.g. due to abnormal pre-albumin (transthyretin, TTR), damaging neural and cardiac tissue
• Organ-speciﬁc amyloid, such as Alzheimer’s disease; plaques of the
B protein derived from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP).
Protein presumed to be generated locally.

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

Amyloidosis: lung involvement 1
Clinically signiﬁcant respiratory tract disease is almost always AL in type,
though the presence of a strong family history or chronic inﬂammatory
disease may suggest other types.
Laryngeal amyloidosis Amyloid causes up to 1% of benign laryngeal disease.
May present as discrete nodules or diffuse inﬁltration, and is usually
localized, though can be a rare manifestation of systemic (AL) amyloid.
Deposits are seen most commonly in the supraglottic larynx (presenting
with hoarse voice or stridor). May present with choking and exertional
dyspnoea that can be progressive or recurrent.
Tracheobronchial amyloid is rare (67 worldwide cases reported by the
mid-1980s). Macroscopically is either diffusely inﬁltrative or ‘tumour-like’.
It is associated with tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica (a disorder characterized by the deposition of calciﬁed submucosal airway nodules). It
presents after the ﬁfth decade with dyspnoea, cough, and rarely haemoptysis. Airway narrowing can lead to atelectasis or recurrent pneumonia;
solitary nodules may lead to investigation for presumed lung cancer.
Symptomatic disease is usually localized.
Parenchymal amyloid is the most frequently diagnosed amyloid respiratory
disease. It is usually divided radiologically into solitary/multiple pulmonary
nodules (usually localized AL amyloid) or a diffuse alveolar pattern (usually
a manifestation of systemic AL amyloid). Parenchymal amyloid lung nodules
are usually peripheral and subpleural, may be bilateral, and are more
common in the lower lobes, ranging in diameter from 0.4 to 15 cm. They
may cavitate or calcify. Clinical signs are non-diagnostic, PFTs may show a
restrictive defect with reduced transfer factor. The differential diagnosis
usually includes ﬁbrosis. Cardiac amyloid may coexist, and distinguishing
the contribution to the symptoms of the pulmonary and cardiac disease
can be difﬁcult. Median survival with clinically overt lung disease is about
16 months (similar to that of systemic amyloid).
Mediastinal and hilar amyloidosis are rarely associated with localized
pulmonary amyloidosis and their diagnosis should lead to a search for a
systemic cause of amyloid. Amyloid lymphadenopathy can also represent
localized AL deposition in association with B-cell lymphoma.
Other Rare reports of:
• Ventilatory failure due to diaphragm or other respiratory muscle
involvement
• Sleep apnoea from macroglossia due to amyloid
• Exudative pleural effusions.

Clinical features
• Dyspnoea and cough
• None—parenchymal disease may be an incidental ﬁnding on routine
radiography
• Consider the diagnosis particularly in patients with odd upper airway
symptoms and parenchymal involvement, or those with unexplained
congestive cardiac failure or nephrotic syndrome.

AMYLOIDOSIS: LUNG INVOLVEMENT 1

Diagnosis Histological conﬁrmation is usually required. Congo red stain
producing ‘apple green’ birefringence in crossed polarized light is the gold
standard. Positive histology must lead to immunohistochemistry to determine the ﬁbril type.
• Histology Transbronchial biopsy or occasionally open or VATS biopsy
(more likely if investigation for solitary pulmonary nodule).
• 123I labelled scintigraphy Radiolabelled serum amyloid P (SAP) localizes to amyloid deposits in proportion to the quantity of amyloid
present, therefore allowing identiﬁcation of the distribution and burden
of disease. It is most sensitive for solid organ disease, though in lung
disease is useful for determining the extent of disease in other organs.
It is, however, expensive and carries an infection risk, as the serum
amyloid P component is currently obtained from blood donors.
• HRCT may show nodules or parenchymal disease.
• Laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy may be needed to obtain samples for
histology, depending on the clinical presentation.
• PFTs to assess the effect of disease on respiratory function. May show
reduced transfer factor and a restrictive pattern. Tracheobronchial
involvement may lead to abnormal ﬂow–volume loops due to larger
airway obstruction.
• Systemic disease
• FBC, biochemistry, and urinalysis (?renal involvement)
• Investigate for underlying blood cell dyscrasia, e.g. myeloma,
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia (bone marrow examination, and
search for urine and serum monoclonal protein by immunoﬁxation—
the clonal proliferation underlying systemic AL amyloid is usually
very subtle, and its identiﬁcation may be difﬁcult)
• Echo for associated cardiac involvement (when congestive cardiac
failure is present, survival is 4–6 months)
• Thyroid/adrenal function are impaired in up to 10%.

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

Amyloidosis: lung involvement 2
Treatment There are limited clinical trials with which to guide management of respiratory tract amyloid. Management decisions are therefore
often made empirically.
• No treatment may be needed
• Local measures may be warranted for endobronchial disease, e.g. symptomatic laryngeal disease—endoscopic excision, carbon dioxide laser
evaporation (useful for small recurrent lesions), stenting. Steroids have
no effect on laryngeal amyloid
• Tracheobronchial amyloid—management depends on symptoms and
treatment may involve repeated endoscopic resection, YAG (yttrium–
aluminium–garnet) laser therapy, and surgical resection. Repeated
endoscopic procedures are thought to be safer than repeated open
surgery
• Chemotherapy may be warranted for diffuse parenchymal amyloid
if there is objectively measurable disease (prednisolone and
melphalan, to suppress the underlying blood cell dyscrasia). More
intensive chemotherapy has a better clinical response, but there are
few trials.

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia
(HHT; also referred to as Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome)
Prevalence: 1 in 5000–8000.

Deﬁnition
An autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of
abnormal dilated vessels in the systemic circulation, which may bleed
leading to:
• Recurrent epistaxis
• Gastrointestinal bleeding
• Iron deﬁciency anaemia
• Other organ involvement, e.g. hepatic (in 30%, commonly asymptomatic), renal, pulmonary, and spinal arterio venous malformation (AVMs)

Screening Careful questioning of family members (Does anyone in the
family have frequent nose bleeds?) and examination for telangiectasia
should reveal those in whom screening should occur.
All those with HHT should be screened for pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs),
and all of their offspring post-puberty and pre-pregnancy. There is increasing
penetrance with increasing age (62% at age 16, 95% at age 40). Similarly,
the detection of PAVMs in a patient should lead to screening for HHT in
family members.
There is no consensus regarding the best screening method, but a combination of the following tests may be used:
• CXR
• Supine and erect oximetry
• CT chest
• Shunt quantiﬁcation techniques, e.g. contrast echocardiogram, 100%
oxygen rebreathing
Screening should continue throughout life (every 5–10 years) and during
times of enlargement or development of AVMs—post-puberty and prepregnancy.

Management
• Usually involves liaison with ENT and gastroenterological colleagues for
symptomatic treatment
• Iron replacement, transfusions
• Asymptomatic hepatic AVMs—no treatment usually required
• Cerebral AVMs (in 15% of HHT patients)—some specialists argue
these should be treated prophylactically due to the risk of rupture and
bleeding (2% per year, often fatal).

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis
A rare disease of undetermined aetiology, characterized by recurrent episodes of alveolar haemorrhage and haemoptysis (in the absence of renal
disease), usually leading to iron deﬁciency anaemia.

Pathophysiology The alveolar space and interstitium contain
haemosiderin-laden macrophages, with variable degrees of interstitial
ﬁbrosis and degeneration of alveolar, interstitial, and vascular elastic ﬁbres,
depending on the chronicity of the condition. Electron microscopy shows
damage to the endothelial and basement membranes, but no consistent
or diagnostic features have been recognized.
No antibodies have been identiﬁed, though serum IgA levels are sometimes raised. With recurrent alveolar haemorrhage, the alveolar blood provokes a ﬁbrotic reaction, with the development of diffuse pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
Iron turnover studies show that the accompanying iron deﬁciency
anaemia is due to loss of iron into the lung through haemorrhage.

Aetiology is uncertain, but likely to be multifactorial. Possible associations include toxic insecticides (epidemiological studies in rural Greece),
premature birth, and fungal toxin exposure. The disease has an equal sex
incidence in childhood, with twice as many men affected in adulthood.
Most patients present in childhood, with 85% of cases having onset
of symptoms before 16 years. The actual prevalence is unknown, but a
cohort study of Swedish children in the 1960s described an incidence of
0.24 per million children. Familial clustering is reported.
Pulmonary haemosiderosis is associated with rheumatoid arthritis,
thyrotoxicosis, coeliac disease, and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, suggesting a potential autoimmune mechanism.

Clinical features The clinical course is very variable and ranges from
continuous low-level bleeding to massive pulmonary haemorrhage. The
latter may be fatal, but is fortunately rare.
• Continuous mild pulmonary haemorrhage leads to a chronic nonproductive cough with haemoptysis, malaise, lethargy, and failure to
thrive in children
• Iron deﬁciency anaemia is common, as are positive faecal occult blood
tests (due to swallowed blood)
• Generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are recognized.
• With an acute bleed, cough and haemoptysis may worsen, and
dyspnoea, chest tightness, and pyrexia may develop
• Chronic bleeding leads to chronic disabling dyspnoea, chronic anaemia,
and clubbing (in 25%). Cor pulmonale secondary to pulmonary ﬁbrosis
and hypoxaemia may develop.
Examination may be normal. Clubbing, basal crepitations, and cor pulmonale are all recognized, depending on the severity of the resulting lung
disease.

IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY HAEMOSIDEROSIS

Investigations The diagnosis is one of exclusion, with no evidence of
other organ involvement. The main differential diagnosis is Goodpasture’s
syndrome, Wegener’s granulomatosis, SLE, and microscopic polyarteritis.
• Blood tests Microcytic, hypochromic anaemia, with low iron levels.
ANCA, dsDNA, and anti-GBM antibodies should be negative
• CXR May show transient patchy inﬁltrates, which worsen during an
acute bleed. The apices are usually spared. Progressive disease leads
to the development of reticulonodular inﬁltrates, and a ground-glass
appearance that is typically perihilar or in the lower zones. Hilar lymphadenopathy may be seen
• PFTs kCO is transiently elevated during bleeding episodes (≥130%
is abnormal), but this is only useful acutely. A restrictive defect with
reduced kCO may develop with chronic disease
• CT chest The changes seen are fairly non-speciﬁc, showing a diffuse
bilateral inﬁltrate, with patchy ground-glass change
• BAL (if done) contain haemosiderin-laden macrophages.
Management
There is no speciﬁc treatment.
• Steroids and immunosuppressive drugs may be of beneﬁt during acute
bleeding episodes, but do not appear to affect the long-term outcome.
There are no published data to guide the optimal timing of treatment
during the course of disease
• The iron deﬁciency anaemia responds to replacement therapy, and
blood transfusion may be needed in severe bleeds.

At routine clinic appointments
• Check spirometry
• Measure haemoglobin and serum iron levels
• Ask about increases in SOB or haemoptysis.

Prognosis The prognosis is very variable, with some patients showing
spontaneous remission. The duration of disease in the literature ranges
from death within days following an acute severe illness, to survival with
cor pulmonale associated with chronic disease after 20 years.

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis
Deﬁnition Pulmonary Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis (LCH; previously
termed pulmonary histiocytosis X or pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma)
is a rare condition characterized by inﬁltration of the lung with histiocytes
(Langerhans’ cells). Pulmonary LCH overlaps with a number of other conditions with similar pathological ﬁndings but diverse clinical features. These
range from localized inﬁltration of a single organ (e.g. eosinophilic granuloma of bone) to systemic diseases affecting multiple organs (Letterer–
Siwe disease, a multi-organ disease affecting infants and elderly, associated
with poor prognosis; also Hand–Schueller–Christian syndrome). Although
the isolated pulmonary form most commonly presents to chest physicians,
pulmonary manifestations also commonly occur in the systemic forms of
the disease.

Epidemiology Rare, it tends to affect young adults aged 20–40 years.
The vast majority of cases occur in current smokers, usually heavy smokers.
May be more common in men, who tend to present at a younger age than
women.
Pathogenesis Langerhans’ cells are involved in antigen presentation,
and are characterized by the presence of well-demarcated cytoplasmic
organelles called Birbeck granules on electron microscopy. The Langerhans’
cells seen in LCH appear to be monoclonal, although it is unclear if this
represents a true neoplastic process. The antigen stimulus for activating
Langerhans’ cells in the lung is unknown, although cigarette smoke is a
possible candidate. Langerhans’ cells are typically organized into granulomata that are located in bronchiolar walls, and subsequently enlarge and
invade adjacent structures. This results in the radiological appearance of
nodules that at ﬁrst cavitate and then become cystic.
Clinical features Typically exertional breathlessness and cough, sometimes with systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, weight loss). Pneumothorax
occurs in at least 10% of patients and may be the presenting feature. Rib
lesions may also give rise to chest pain. Around 25% of patients are asymptomatic. Examination is usually normal.

Investigations
• CXR Typically diffuse reticulonodular shadowing, sometimes with cystic
change; upper and middle lobe predominance. May be normal
• HRCT Diffuse centrilobular nodules, sometimes with cavitation, and
thin and thick-walled cystic lesions, reﬂecting lesions of varying age.
These are interspersed with normal lung. Upper and middle lobe predominance; costophrenic angles are typically spared. Purely nodular or
purely cystic appearances may occur. Unusual manifestations such as
single nodules or large airways involvement are also described
• PFTs variable, ranging from normal to obstructive, restricted or mixed
patterns. Reduced gas transfer and exertional hypoxia are common
• TBB may yield diagnostic material, although is often unhelpful; risk of
pneumothorax is unknown although may be increased. Surgical lung
biopsy is often preferable

LANGERHANS’ CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS

• BAL Increased total cell counts and pigmented macrophages, reﬂecting
simply the presence of cigarette smoking. Use of antibodies (e.g. OKT6)
to detect Langerhans’ cells in BAL ﬂuid is limited by poor sensitivity
• Extrathoracic biopsy of involved sites (e.g. bone) may be diagnostic

Diagnosis Usually based on the combination of clinical and HRCT ﬁndings: typically a young adult smoker with cysts and nodules on HRCT.
Conﬁrmation by surgical lung biopsy may be considered in atypical
presentations, such as the ﬁnding of solely nodular or cystic disease on
HRCT. The appearance of purely cystic disease on HRCT may be confused
with emphysema (where cysts lack walls) or lymphangioleiomyomatosis
(where cysts are present uniformly in all regions of lung, including the
costophrenic angles).
Associations
• Severe pulmonary hypertension—may be seen in the absence of signiﬁcant parenchymal lung involvement; direct disease involvement of
pulmonary vessels has been described
• Manifestations of systemic LCH—particularly diabetes insipidus from
pituitary disease, skin involvement, lytic bony lesions, and rarely cardiac
or gastrointestinal disease
• Lymphoma—may precede, complicate, or coexist with pulmonary LCH
• Lung cancer—more common, probably as a result of cigarette smoking.

Management Treatment other than smoking cessation is often not
required. Oral corticosteroids may be tried in symptomatic disease,
although there is little evidence to support their use; they are usually
administered for at least 6 months. Lung transplantation should be considered in patients with severe respiratory failure or pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary LCH may recur in transplanted lungs. Experimental
treatments such as the use of IL-2 and anti-TNFA may be of beneﬁt in the
systemic forms of LCH seen in children.
Prognosis is variable. Spontaneous improvement is common, although
later reactivation of disease may occur. A minority of patients deteriorate rapidly with respiratory failure and death within months. Overall life
expectancy is reduced, with median survival 12–13 years from diagnosis.
Death is most commonly due to respiratory failure. Poor prognostic
factors include reduced FEV1, increased residual volume, and reduced gas
transfer.

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM):
clinical features
Deﬁnition and aetiology A rare disorder characterized by abnormal
proliferation of smooth muscle cells, affecting women of child-bearing age,
usually in their 30s. The disease is hormone-dependent, so can occur in
post-menopausal women on oestrogen replacement therapy.
• Incidence of 1 in 1.1 million population
• Unknown cause
• Not hereditary
• 40% of adult women with tuberous sclerosis (learning difﬁculties, subungal ﬁbromas, seizures, facial angioﬁbromas, autosomal dominant
inheritance or spontaneous mutation) develop pulmonary changes
identical to those of LAM.
Pathology Abnormal proliferation of atypical smooth muscle cells (LAM
cells) throughout the lung, airways, blood vessels, and lymphatics. There
is nodular inﬁltration, which is initially subtle. Progressive growth causes
lymphatic and airway obstruction, leading to cyst formation throughout
the lungs.
Clinical features
Common
• Secondary pneumothorax (in two-thirds of patients; occurs due to lung
cystic change; recurrence is common)
• Dyspnoea (in 42%)
• Cough (in 20%)
• Haemoptysis (in 14%)
• Chylothorax (in 12%, thoracic duct leakage as a result of lymphatic
obstruction by LAM cells, may be bilateral).
Less common
• Pleural effusion
• Chest pain
• Pulmonary haemorrhage (due to blocked blood vessels and increased
intraluminal pressure).

Other organs affected
Kidney Angiomyolipoma, a benign tumour, occurs in 50% of LAM patients.
Usually diagnosed on CT, these are mostly small and single, but can be multiple and larger in tuberous sclerosis. Smaller tumours are usually asymptomatic, but larger ones can cause ﬂank pain and bleeding into the renal tract.
Treatment options include tumour resection or embolization. Nephrectomy
is not usually required. Screening for these lesions is important as it allows
careful treatment planning in case they become symptomatic.
Abdomen Lymphadenopathy due to lymphatic obstruction. Occurs in onethird of patients and is usually asymptomatic.
Pelvis Lymphangioleiomyoma—a cystic mass that enlarges during the day
and causes fullness and bloating.

LYMPHANGIOLEIOMYOMATOSIS (LAM): CLINICAL FEATURES

Chylous ascites can occur in the absence of chylothorax.
Skin Cutaneous swellings, likely due to localized oedema.

Examination May be normal. There may be pulmonary crepitations or
signs of pleural effusion. Palpable abdominal masses may be present.

Investigations
• PFTs may be normal, or show a predominantly obstructive pattern.
Rarely restrictive. Decreased TLCO, with a normal or increased TLC
• CXR may be normal. Lungs may appear hyperinﬂated, with reticular
shadowing and septal lines due to obstructed lymphatics. There may
also be a diffuse interstitial inﬁltrate
• HRCT shows a characteristic appearance, with multiple cysts
throughout the lung of varying size, which are usually small (<1 cm) and
thin-walled. The adjoining lung parenchyma is normal. There may be
pleural effusions.
• CT abdomen to examine for presence of angiomyolipomas and other
lymphatic involvement.

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

LAM: diagnosis and management
Diagnosis Consider particularly in young or middle-aged women with:
• Recurrent pneumothoraces, especially those with pre-existing dyspnoea or haemoptysis
• Cystic lung disease, airﬂow obstruction, or chylous pleural effusions
• Angiomyolipomas or other retroperitoneal tumours
• Tuberous sclerosis and respiratory symptoms
The disease is easily missed in its early stages. The diagnosis can be
made on the characteristic CT appearances, or with open lung biopsy.
Transbronchial biopsies may not be diagnostic. Large retroperitoneal
abdominal lymph nodes can also be biopsied.

Management
• There are no controlled trials of treatment
• The course of LAM is variable. Treatment should be aimed at those
who are symptomatic and declining
• Diet Low-fat diet with medium chain triglyceride supplementation may
prevent chylothorax recurrence, but there is not strong evidence for
this. The diet is difﬁcult to adhere to
• Bronchodilators may improve airﬂow obstruction
• Hormonal manipulation with progesterone has been tried. It may
be beneﬁcial in reducing the decline in FEV1 and TLCO, particularly
in patients with progressive disease, but there are no large studies.
Tamoxifen and oophrectomy have also been tried
• Avoid oestrogens i.e. the oral contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy
• Contraception An increase in symptoms and accelerated disease
decline are reported in pregnancy. Use the progesterone-only pill
• Pleural aspiration when required for pleural effusions. For recurrent
effusions or chylothoraces, thoracic duct ligation or pleurectomy may
be effective. Pleurodesis can be performed, but this is relatively contraindicated if future lung transplant is an option
• Recurrent pneumothoraces Advise regarding ﬂying and diving. Thoracic
surgery may be necessary
• Avoid air travel if possible due to risk of pneumothorax
• Transplant Single (usually) or double lung, or heart–lung. LAM can
recur in the transplanted lung
• Stop smoking as this accelerates the rate of decline
• Inﬂuenza vaccine
• Liaise with a specialist centre if required (this is Nottingham City
Hospital in the UK).

LAM: DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT

Prognosis is very variable. The condition usually slowly progresses to
respiratory failure. At 10 years 55% of patients have MRC grade 3 dyspnoea, 23% are on LTOT, and 10% are housebound. Survival: 70% of patients
are alive at 10 years, 33% are alive at 15 years, and 25% are alive at 20 years.
Future developments Rapamycin may switch off the defect in LAM
cells and prevent their proliferation. Studies are ongoing.

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)
A rare genetic cause of chronic respiratory disease, usually encountered
in adult respiratory clinics as a cause of bronchiectasis. Cilia are found in:
• The whole length of the upper respiratory tract
• Brain ventricles
• Fallopian tube/ductus epididymis
They are made up of dynein arms, with outer and inner connecting rings,
and beat at 14 beats/s. Many gene defects have been identiﬁed in PCD,
causing a number of cilial abnormalities.
Abnormal cilia do not beat normally, leading to reduced mucociliary
clearance, microbiological colonization (which further inhibits cilial action),
chronic infection, and the development of bronchiectasis.
The main aim following diagnosis in childhood is the prevention of
chronic respiratory disease and bronchiectasis.

Clinical features
• Autosomal recessive, >200 phenotypes
• May present with neonatal respiratory distress
• Situs inversus (in about 30%, as cilia determine the side of the organs.
Random organ siting occurs with cilial dysfunction, hence the situs
inversus of Kartagener’s syndrome)
• Nasal blockage/rhinitis
• Persistent wet cough in childhood
• Hearing problems/history of glue ear/grommets in childhood
• Clubbing and signs of chest disease are rare in childhood
• Wheeze in 20%
• Infertility due to immotile sperm (sperm tails have same morphological
defect as the cilia and do not beat correctly)
• In adults the disease usually presents with the clinical signs of bronchiectasis: cough productive of purulent sputum, recurrent chest infections, intermittent haemoptysis.

Diagnosis Saccharin test (see p 153). Nasal NO is very low in PCD (possibly because NO mediates ciliary function); this is the most sensitive and
speciﬁc screening test. Cilial biopsy via the nasal route. Cilia are examined
by high-speed digital video, where their beat frequency and pattern can be
assessed, conﬁrming the diagnosis. Most cases of PCD are diagnosed in
childhood. There is an increased frequency in the children of consanguineous marriages.
Consider the diagnosis in:
•
•
•
•

Bronchiectasis
Situs inversus
Persistent upper and lower respiratory infection from early childhood
Infertility—males may present in infertility clinics.

PRIMARY CILIARY DYSKINESIA (PCD)

Management
A national service for the diagnosis of PCD was set up in 2007, with three
centres—London (Royal Brompton), Southampton, and Leicester.
In adults this involves the treatment of secondary bronchiectasis (see
p 154), with:
• Antibiotics
• Physiotherapy
• Vaccinations
• Management of haemoptysis.

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP):
pathophysiology and clinical features
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), also referred to as alveolar lipoproteinosis, is a rare alveolar ﬁlling defect affecting around 3 per million
people. There is a limited published literature: ﬁve reported case series of
≥10 cases, and only 410 total cases reported.

Pathophysiology PAP is due to failure of alveolar macrophages to
clear spent surfactant, leading to the ﬁlling of alveoli with a phospholipid
proteinaceous material. It is thought that the defect has an autoimmune
basis, due to the presence of antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), which cause inhibition of normal alveolar macrophage function, leading to abnormalities of surfactant homeostasis. Defects
in GM-CSF signalling have been identiﬁed in animal models. Congenital
disease is thought to be due to mutations in surfactant gene proteins. Other
mechanisms for surfactant accumulation have also been identiﬁed:
• Heavy dust exposure leads to surfactant hypersecretion, which exceeds the
lungs’ normal clearance mechanism. Animal models have shown that this
condition develops from endogenous lipoid pneumonia, with the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages, which break down to release surfactant
• Amphiphilic drugs e.g. amiodarone, chlorphentermine
• Lymphoma, leukaemia, and immunosuppression The mechanism is
uncertain, but it is thought that the lipoprotein may be generated from
degenerating alveolar cells.
Appearances similar to alveolar lipoproteinosis may also be seen in
endogenous lipoid pneumonia resulting from bronchial obstruction and
are described in surfactant-secreting alveolar cell carcinoma.

Histology The alveoli are ﬁlled with a granular acellular eosinophilic PAS
(periodic acid–Schiff) positive deposit. Cholesterol clefts and large foamy
macrophages may also be seen. The alveolar architecture is usually well
preserved. Surfactant protein can be identiﬁed using immunohistochemistry. Electron microscopy shows multiple osmiophilic bodies consistent
with denatured surfactant.
Epidemiology
•
•
•
•

Presents aged 30–50 (case reports in children and the elderly)
Male to female ratio of 4:1
Increased incidence in smokers
Rare familial cases reported.

PULMONARY ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS (PAP)

Clinical features
• Typically presents with breathlessness and a non-productive cough.
Examination may be normal, or crackles may be heard on auscultation.
Clubbing in one-third
• May present with superadded infection, causing an apparent acute
onset of symptoms in association with fever
• Median duration of symptoms before diagnosis is 7 months
• Opportunistic infection is the major complication, most commonly
Nocardia species, fungi, and mycobacteria. This occurs due to impaired
macrophage function and impaired host defence due to surfactant
accumulation.

631

632

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

PAP: diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of a characteristic CT appearance,
although other tests may also be useful.
• Raised serum LDH
• ABGs Hypoxia and increased alveolar–arterial (A–a) gradient
• PFTs Restrictive defect, with reduced lung volumes and transfer factor
• CXR Bilateral consolidation with thickened interlobular septa. Usually
bilateral. The pattern is very variable, and in up to 50% may be perihilar
(bat-wing appearance)
• CT appearance is characteristic, with airspace shadowing in a geographical distribution, alternating with areas of normal lung, the so-called
‘crazy paving’ pattern. This CT appearance is not speciﬁc to alveolar
proteinosis, but is also seen in lipoid pneumonia and bronchoalveolar
cell carcinoma
• BAL reveals milky washings. Identiﬁcation of antibodies to granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor in BAL washings is diagnostic.
Cytological examination shows a granular extracellular deposit with
foamy macrophages and cellular debris
• Transbronchial/open lung biopsies are occasionally needed if the CT is
not characteristic.
Treatment of choice is repeated therapeutic whole lung lavage, which
should be performed at a specialist centre. There are no randomized controlled trials of this treatment, but there is evidence of efﬁcacy in terms of
subsequent improvement of symptoms, physiology, and radiology.
• The indication for whole lung lavage is usually breathlessness limiting
activities of daily living
• The procedure is done under general anaesthesia using 100% oxygen,
and one-lung ventilation using a double-lumen tube. Repeated warm
saline lavage using a closed circuit continues until the bronchial washing
returns are clear—this may take up to 40 L lavage. One or both lungs
may be treated at a time
• The response is variable—some patients need only one treatment,
others may need multiple treatments, and about 10% fail to respond
• May be done on bypass if the patient is very hypoxic
• Characteristic milky lavage ﬂuid is obtained.
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (subcutaneous injections) is a novel
treatment option (only phase II studies, no RCT yet), which may prevent
progression of disease.
There is no beneﬁt from treatment with steroids, and they may exacerbate opportunistic infections.

Prognosis with whole lung lavage is generally good. Spontaneous remission occurs in one-third, one-third remain stable, and one-third progress
to respiratory failure and death. There are reports of progression to pulmonary ﬁbrosis (which may be a coincidental occurrence).

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

Pulmonary arteriovenous
malformations (PAVMs): aetiology and
diagnosis
Aetiology
• Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are abnormal blood
vessels replacing normal capillaries, making a direct low-resistance connection between the pulmonary arterial and systemic venous circulations. They vary in size from tiny clusters of vessels (telangiectasia) to
larger, more complex aneurysmal-type sacs
• The disorder is rare, affecting 1 in 15, 000–24 000
• Several genetic susceptibility loci have been identiﬁed on chromosomes
9 and 12. One identiﬁed mutation is in the endoglin gene. This modulates signalling via the transforming growth factor-B family of growth
factors. This gene is also implicated in the development of primary
pulmonary hypertension
• Subjects with signiﬁcant PAVMs have low pulmonary vascular resistance, a low mean pulmonary artery pressure, and a high cardiac
output—due to longstanding adaptive mechanisms to the effects of the
shunt, in addition to vascular remodelling effects
• Most patients present post-puberty, as AVMs probably develop at this
time. They probably grow throughout life, especially during puberty and
in pregnancy. They may rarely regress spontaneously.

Diagnosis
• Most patients present with an abnormal CXR, classically showing a
smooth rounded intrapulmonary mass, with draining or feeding vessels
• Mild hypoxaemia An AVM is a direct communication between the
pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein. Blood therefore bypasses the
pulmonary capillary bed, with reduced oxygenation, which poorly corrects with supplementary oxygen
• Orthodeoxia is desaturation on standing, due to an increase in blood
ﬂow in the dependent lung areas. 70% of PAVMs are basal; hence the
desaturation seen
• CT identiﬁes all AVMs, and can determine those suitable for embolization. Contrast is not required
• Patients may present with the complications of a PAVM, particularly
bleeding or peripheral abscess formation. The absence of a normal
ﬁltering capillary bed means small particles can reach the systemic
circulation, leading to sequelae, particularly in the cerebral circulation—strokes and cerebral abscesses. These abnormal vessels are also
at risk of rupture.

PULMONARY ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATIONS

Shunt quantiﬁcation
• 100% oxygen rebreathing study, a non-invasive method of shunt quantiﬁcation
• 99mTC perfusion scan, a tracer study; the size of the shunt can be
assessed from the proportion of radiolabelled macro-aggregates
reaching the systemic circulation compared with the total number
injected. In a normal study, aggregates accumulate in the kidneys
• Contrast echocardiogram to measure the circulatory transit time of
injected echocontrast
• Angiography at specialist centre only
• In normal individuals the anatomical shunt is <2–3.5% of the cardiac
output (due to post-pulmonary drainage of bronchial veins into pulmonary vein, and drainage into the left atrium).

Clinical features
• Asymptomatic (50%)
• Dyspnoea
• Haemoptysis (10%), probably due to additional bronchial telangiectasia,
which can also cause haemorrhage into bronchi or the pleural cavity
• Chest pain (12%); aetiology is uncertain
• Clubbing
• Cyanosis
• Orthodeoxia
• Vascular bruits
• Telangiectasia; 80% of PAVM patients have hereditary haemorrhagic
telangiectasia (HHT), and their families should be screened because of
the risk of stroke (see p 618)
• May present with acute stroke, with focal neurological signs

635

636

CHAPTER 49

Unusual conditions (BOLD)

PAVMs: management and complications
Management
Embolization is usually done with coils, which generate local thrombin,
leading to cessation of blood ﬂow in AVM feeding vessels. This results in
a reduction in the right–left shunt and improvement in hypoxaemia, and
should be done by an expert in a specialist centre only. The small risk
of neurological sequelae and angina/arrthymias is reduced with operator
experience.
60–70% of patients are left with a small persisting shunt following treatment, and retain a small risk of abscess formation. Patients are therefore
given prophylactic antibiotics for dental and surgical procedures (ensure
the patient has a MedicAlert card).
Surgical resection may be more appropriate than embolization in some
cases.
Anti-platelet therapy (rarely) in individual cases, if ongoing transient
ischaemic attacks.
Transplantation is not advised as there is no increased survival beneﬁt
over medical treatment.
Screening The majority of patients with PAVMs have HHT and so screening
of family members is important.
Follow-up All patients need regular follow-up with shunt assessment postsurgical resection or embolization, as removal of one shunt may unmask
or provoke the development of others.
Female patients should be advised to defer pregnancy until completion of
formal assessment, because of the risks of growth and rupture of PAVMs
in pregnancy (see below).

Complications
• PAVM patients never die of respiratory failure in the absence of additional respiratory disease
• All patients are at risk of stroke and cerebral abscesses
• Transient ischaemic attack/stroke (in 25%) due to rupture of abnormal
capillaries in aneurysms
• Abscess (in 10%) due to paradoxical emboli through the right to left
shunt, and the absence of a ﬁltering capillary bed
Pregnancy is associated with an increase in size of AVMs, and new ones
may develop, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Careful shunt
assessment is therefore needed prior to pregnancy, with contraceptive
advice prior to specialist assessment. Close liaison between the specialist
centre and obstetric team is paramount. AVMs may need embolization in
the third trimester to allow safe delivery.

RECURRENT RESPIRATORY PAPILLOMATOSIS

Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis
These are essentially warts of the upper respiratory tract, caused by the
human papilloma virus (HPV 6 or 11). The virus infects epithelial cells
and mucous membranes, similar to that seen in cutaneous and anogenital
infection. The infection is most commonly acquired during ororespiratory
exposure from the mother during vaginal delivery, and typically presents in
childhood from 6 months onwards, with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. It may also present for the ﬁrst time in adulthood.
It is associated with HLA DR3, and with sexual transmission in adults.
Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is rare (2 per 100 000), but oral HPV
infection is common.

Clinical course
This is variable.
• May remit spontaneously
• Progressive voice loss and airway obstruction
• Most cases are conﬁned to the larynx, although up to 25% of patients
subsequently develop extralaryngeal spread to the bronchial tree
• 1% have malignant change to squamous cell carcinomas

Management
• Surgical excision to maintain airway patency
• Laser therapy—but potential problems of thermal injury, stricture formation, and spread of papillomas
• Photodynamic therapy reduces recurrence rate, using oral or intravenous photosensitizing agent, then a laser to destroy photosensitive
tissue
• Microdebrider is now used more commonly
• Medical treatment—interferon, aciclovir, ribavirin, isoretinoin, and
methotrexate have all been tried
• Interferon-a as a daily subcutaneous injection leads to complete
remission in 30–50%, and partial resolution in 30%. One-third recur
when treatment is stopped. Adverse reactions are common: ﬂu-like
symptoms, deranged LFTs, leucopenia, and alopecia
• Cidofovir is a nucleoside monophosphate analogue and inhibits viral
polymerase. It is given as an intralesional injection. Potential sideeffects include nephrotoxicity and neutropenia.

CHAPTER 50

Upper airway diseases

Acute upper airway obstruction
Presentation Sudden respiratory distress with cyanosis and aphonia.
Airway obstruction can occur at any level within the airway. Partial airway
obstruction leads to noisy breathing, with stridor, gurgling, or snoring.
Complete airway obstruction is associated with distress and marked respiratory effort, with paradoxical chest and abdominal movement (‘seesaw
breathing’), and use of accessory muscles of respiration. This may be
followed by collapse with loss of consciousness, and progress to cardiorespiratory arrest. Look for chest and abdominal movements, and listen
and feel for airﬂow at the nose and mouth.
Causes
• Pharyngeal occlusion by tongue and other muscles, secondary to loss
of muscle tone. This may be secondary to drugs, alcohol, a neurological
event, or cardiorespiratory arrest
• Vomit or blood
• Inhaled foreign body, which may also cause laryngeal spasm
• Laryngeal obstruction due to oedema from burns, inﬂammation, or
anaphylaxis
• Excessive bronchial secretions, mucosal oedema, bronchospasm: may
cause airway obstruction below the larynx
• Infection, such as epiglottitis
• Any cause of chronic airway obstruction, such as an airway tumour or
extrinsic compression due to tumour or lymphadenopathy, may deteriorate precipitously.

ACUTE UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION

22 Management of upper airway obstruction
Call for senior anaesthetic help early
• Open the airway with backwards head tilt, chin lift, and forward jaw
thrust. In cases of trauma, do not tilt the head, but perform a jaw
thrust only
• If unsuccessful at restoring normal respiration, visually inspect the
mouth for obvious occlusion and remove it with a ﬁnger sweep.
Leave well-ﬁtting dentures in place
• If there is a witnessed history of choking, consider performing the
Heimlich manoeuvre to dislodge the particle (ﬁrm and rapid pressure
applied beneath the diaphragm in an upwards movement), or directly
visualize the airway with a laryngoscope and use McGill’s forceps
to remove the particle, or with bronchoscope and the use of biopsy
forceps
• If the patient is breathing, consider inserting an airway to maintain
patency: oropharyngeal (Guedel) or nasopharyngeal. Maintain oxygenation, using mask with reservoir bag, delivering 10–15 L/min. If
there is no spontaneous respiratory effort, insert a laryngeal mask
or endotracheal tube and deliver oxygen via self-inﬂating bag with
supplemental oxygen 10 L/min and reservoir bag. If they are not
breathing and cannot be ventilated, a cricothyroidotomy may be
necessary (p 763)
• Suction out secretions
• Maintain circulation with cardiac compression if necessary
• Seek deﬁnitive treatment for the cause of airway obstruction, as
appropriate.

Heliox Helium–oxygen mixtures can be used for patients with airway
obstruction, often due to tumour compression or invasion. Helium has
a lower density than nitrogen and can improve ventilation rapidly when
used with oxygen. It can be used as an interim measure until more deﬁnitive management is available, such as radiotherapy, or to allow time for
radiotherapy to take effect. The evidence relating to its use is mainly
case studies, with no randomized control trials.

Nebulized adrenaline may also be helpful in upper airway obstruction, especially laryngeal oedema. This is only a stabilizing measure to
buy time until deﬁnitive treatment is available.

CHAPTER 50

Upper airway diseases

Anaphylaxis
This is a potentially life-threatening medical emergency. Call for help

Causes IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to allergen.
Histamine release causes the clinical syndrome. Typical allergens include
bee or wasp sting, peanuts, ﬁsh, drugs, foods, latex, contrast media, muscle
relaxants, anaesthetic agents.
Presentation Varying severity of:
Angio-oedema
Urticaria
Dyspnoea
Wheeze
Stridor
Hypotension
Arrhythmias
Also rhinitis, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, sense of impending
doom
• May have had previous episodes of severe allergic-type reactions.
•

•

22 Management of anaphylaxis
• Remove likely allergen
• Cardiopulmonary resuscitation if necessary
• Airway and breathing Administer high-ﬂow oxygen through nonrebreathe mask. If airway obstruction present, consider tracheal intubation. Airway swelling may make this difﬁcult and cricothyroidotomy
may need to be performed (see p 763)
• Circulation Give adrenaline (epinephrine) IM 1:1000 solution 0.5 mL
(500 µg). Repeat after 5 min if no improvement or deterioration
• In those with profound shock and immediately life-threatening
anaphylaxis, such as during anaesthesia, or those with no pulse.
IV adrenaline can be given slowly, 100 µg per min or 1 mL of 1:10 000
solution/min. Stop as soon as there is a response. This can be
hazardous and needs cardiac monitoring
• IV ﬂuids if hypotension persists: 1–2 L rapidly infused
• Antihistamines, such as chlorphenamine 10–20 mg IV
• Consider steroids: 100–500 mg hydrocortisone IV
• Consider nebulized salbutamol or adrenaline if bronchospasm
• On discharge, provide epipen (IM self-administered adrenaline) and
advise on future episodes, MedicAlert bracelet, and card
• Consider immunology referral if allergen unknown.
• Consider C1 esterase inhibitor deﬁciency, especially if repeated
episodes.

ANAPHYLAXIS

Future developments Allergen immunotherapy aiming to desensitize to the allergen. Useful in those who cannot avoid allergen exposure.
Small amounts of the allergen are injected usually weekly, with slowly
increasing dose strengths until the maximum dose of the allergen is administered, which can take up to 12 months. Mechanism unknown, but probably
related to increased IgG binding to the allergen, falling allergen-speciﬁc IgE
levels, and decreased amount of circulating inﬂammatory cytokines. Can
protect against anaphylaxis for 3–5 years, but ‘top-up’ doses necessary.
Effective for dust, grass, tree, and weed pollen, mould spores, latex, and
insect venom, as well as some animal allergens. Side-effects of administration: anaphylaxis, bronchoconstriction, local reaction. Some centres may
not perform in people with chronic asthma because of the risk of death.

CHAPTER 50

Upper airway diseases

Upper respiratory tract infections 1
Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) include rhinitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and sinusitis.
Upper respiratory tract infections are the commonest cause of people
taking time off work in the United Kingdom. The majority are managed by
general practitioners and will not reach a respiratory specialist. They are
usually self-limiting and often do not require speciﬁc treatment.

Acute rhinitis Nasal congestion with rhinorrhea, mild malaise, and
sneezing. Most commonly due to viral infection (the common cold).
Topical decongestants may be useful. There is no evidence for the use of
antibiotics or antihistamines.
Candidiasis Oral candida infection is common in those who have
received antibiotics, are immunosuppressed, or on oral or inhaled steroids.
Seen as white plaque-like lesions on the tongue and pharyngeal mucosa.
Treat with oral nystatin or amphotericin lozenges, and with oral hygiene.
Severe infection can be debilitating, leading to difﬁculties with eating, especially in the elderly. Exclude underlying immunocompromise (e.g. HIV, leukaemia) in those with persisting infection despite treatment.

Acute epiglottitis (supraglottitis) is infection mainly localized to
the epiglottis and surrounding supraglottic structures. It is commoner in
children than adults, but a mortality of up to 7% is reported in adults.
This is due to upper airways obstruction from grossly oedematous upper
airway tissue.
• Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Streptococci, and Staphylococci are causative
organisms
• Acute epiglottitis typically presents with a sore throat and dysphagia.
Inspiratory stridor is less common, but it can also present with acute
upper airway obstruction and CXR inﬁltrates consistent with pulmonary oedema (due to high negative intrathoracic pressure)
• May need airway protection with an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy: liaise with ENT/anaesthetic colleagues early
• In severe infection, epiglottic swabs may be of diagnostic use, but
beware of precipitating airway obstruction. Treat with third-generation
cephalosporin for 2 weeks (to cover B-lactam producing H. inﬂuenzae).
Change to amoxicillin if sensitive
Sinusitis The sinuses are normally sterile. The paranasal sinuses communicate with the nose, and are therefore susceptible to infection from
this route. All the sinuses drain by means of the mucociliary escalator.
Blockage of free sinus drainage is a predisposing factor for bacterial infection. Sinusitis is a common cause of persistent cough (see p 18 ). Dental
sepsis may lead to maxillary sinusitis, by direct spread.
Acute sinusitis complicates 1 in 200 upper respiratory tract infections and
usually presents with fever, nasal congestion/discharge, and sinus pain which
is worse on leaning forward. It may be associated with systemic upset.
Respiratory viral infection interrupts normal defences of the mucosal
lining, producing mucous exudates, with secondary bacterial infection.
S. pneumoniae and H. inﬂuenzae are the commonest pathogens. S. aureus
and S. pyogenes are also causes, with Pseudomonas in cystic ﬁbrosis.

UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS 1

Mixed infections with anaerobes are seen in 10%. Speciﬁc diagnostic tests
are not usually needed. If symptoms persist, antibiotic treatment may be
indicated.
Chronic sinusitis by deﬁnition, if present for >3 months. The ciliated epithelial sinus lining is replaced by thickened stratiﬁed squamous lining,
with absent cilia, due to repeated infection. Anaerobic infection is more
common. Fungal infection is more common in atopic people with nasal
polyps. Sinus mycetoma is a rare complication in neutropenic patients, diabetics, and the immunocompromised.
Presents with frontal headache (frontal sinusitis), maxillary pain, pain over
bridge of nose (ethmoidal sinusitis), retro-orbital headache (sphenoidal
sinusitis), with purulent nasal discharge and blockage. Wegener’s granulomatosis may mimic the symptoms of sinusitis.
Investigations are not usually warranted, but a sinus radiograph may
show an air-ﬂuid level, with thickened mucosal lining, or sinus opaciﬁcation. CT is more sensitive, but not usually warranted unless surgical intervention planned or malignant disease suspected.
Treatment Analgesia, topical decongestants, antibiotics if severe infection (amoxicillin ﬁrst line, trimethoprim if penicillin allergic).
Surgery may be warranted if prolonged infection, anatomical abnormality,
or other complications, e.g. if infection has spread to the cranial cavity or
orbit. Spreading infection is uncommon if there has been prior antibiotic
treatment.

CHAPTER 50

Upper airway diseases

Upper respiratory tract infections 2
Acute pharyngitis and tonsillitis 80–90% are caused by viruses,
most commonly adenoviruses, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and inﬂuenza
viruses. Group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae may cause secondary infection. Mycoplasma and chlamydia are
seen less commonly.
• Pharyngitis and tonsillitis present with a sore throat, which is usually
self-limiting. May be associated with fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy,
conjunctivitis, headache, nausea, and vomiting
• Infectious mononucleosis (Epstein Barr Virus) is associated with pharyngitis in 80% of cases. Diagnose with Paul Bunnell test for heterophil
antibodies, and atypical mononuclear cells in peripheral blood
• Coxsackie A and herpes simplex cause ‘herpangina syndrome’—ulcerating vesicles on the tonsils and palate
• CMV can also cause pharyngitis associated with lymphadenopathy and
splenomegaly
• Lemierre’s syndrome (jugular vein suppurative thrombophlebitis) is a
rare anaerobic pharyngeal infection (see p 446).
Other causative agents
• Corynebacterium diptheriae in unvaccinated populations. A pharyngeal
membrane may form, with systemic symptoms, and ‘bull neck’ due to
cervical lymphadenopathy. Low-grade fever, with a relatively high pulse
rate. Treat urgently with diphtheria antitoxin
• Vincent’s angina is anaerobic infection in those with poor mouth
hygiene. Caused by Gram-negative Borrelia vincenti and other anaerobic
infections. Treat with penicillin
• Group A streptococcus may cause a more unpleasant illness, with systemic upset and dysphagia due to pharyngotonsillar oedema.
Treatment is usually supportive, but anti-streptococcal antibiotics may be
warranted if there is severe infection. There is no evidence that antibiotics
reduce the duration of symptoms, but they may reduce complications
(e.g. sinusitis, quinsy, and rheumatic fever, which is rare in the Western
world). Oral penicillin is the ﬁrst-line treatment (or a macrolide if penicillin allergic). Amoxycillin can cause a rash in infectious mononucleosis
and so should be avoided. Throat swabs for group A streptococcus may be
helpful in directing treatment.
Complications of untreated infection include peritonsillar abscess (quinsy),
retropharyngeal abscess, and cervical abscess. Treat with appropriate antibiotics. Surgical drainage is occasionally required.

UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS 2

Laryngitis This is usually part of a generalized upper respiratory tract
infection. Moraxella catarrhalis is the causative agent in up to 50%. It may
cause a hoarse voice or aphonia.
Other causes include inhaled steroids, occupational exposure to inhaled
chemicals, and gastro-oesophageal reﬂux disease. If a hoarse voice persists
in a smoker, a laryngeal or lung cancer (with recurrent laryngeal nerve
involvement) must be excluded. Other causes include tuberculous infection,
HSV, CMV, diphtheria, fungal infections, and actinomycoses.
Treatment Usually no speciﬁc treatment is required, as the illness is typically self-limiting.

Acute bronchitis, tracheitis, and tracheobronchitis Inﬂammation
due to infection can occur in any part of the tracheobronchial tree, and is
termed tracheitis, tracheobronchitis, or bronchitis depending on the anatomical site. It usually follows viral infection, especially of the common
cold type, and is commoner during inﬂuenza epidemics. Secondary bacterial infection is common, with H. inﬂuenza and S. pneumoniae commonest.
There is increased prevalence in the winter months.
Presents with a productive cough, small volume streaky haemoptysis, and
fever. Breathlessness and hypoxia are uncommon unless there is coexistent
cardiorespiratory disease, or a concomitant pneumonia. Retrosternal chest
pain is common in tracheitis. Examination is often normal.
Diagnosis is usually on the basis of the history. A persisting cough, especially in a smoker, may warrant further investigation.
Treatment is usually symptomatic, particularly in the previously well. Use
antibiotics for persistent cough productive of mucopurulent sputum, or if
there is coexistent cardiopulmonary disease.

CHAPTER 51

Vasculitis and the lung

Classiﬁcation
These are rare conditions, but are often seen in the specialist chest clinic
(see p 25 for an approach to diffuse alveolar haemorrhage). Clinical features can be non-speciﬁc and similar to those seen in other diseases and
diagnosis can therefore be difﬁcult. Vasculitides are great ‘mimickers’ of
other diseases, such as lung cancer or ARDS, and have a high untreated
mortality. There is considerable overlap between the different vasculitides,
which can make deﬁnitive diagnosis difﬁcult. Suspect a diagnosis of vasculitis if:
• Weight loss
• Low-grade fever
• Raised inﬂammatory markers
• Chest disease is not improving or responding to treatment as expected:
• Unexplained dyspnoea
• Hypoxia
• Unexplained desaturation on exercise
• Haemoptysis
• Sinus or nasal disease
• Wheeze
• CXR abnormalities/inﬁltrates
• Abnormal KCO
• Associated renal impairment or positive urine dip for blood or protein
• Raised autoantibodies
• No other clear diagnosis
The primary pathology in vasculitis is inﬂammation and necrosis of differing sized blood vessels. The pulmonary vessels are involved as part of a
multi-systemic vasculitis process.

Small vessel vasculitides are the most common to involve the lung.
Arterioles, capillaries, and venules located within the lung interstitium are
affected. Neutrophil inﬁltration and subsequent ﬁbrinoid necrosis causes
vessel wall destruction. Necrotizing pulmonary capillaritis can also occur:
characterized by a marked neutrophilic inﬁltration of the interstitium.
Interstitial capillaries become damaged, allowing red blood cells to enter
the alveolus; thus alveolar haemorrhage is a feature of many of the small
vessel vasculitides.

ANCA
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies react with cytoplasmic granule
enzymes in neutrophils and stain them in one of two ways:
• Diffusely cytoplasmic pattern or c-ANCA
• Perinuclear pattern or p-ANCA
These autoantibodies may have a direct role in pathogenesis as well as
being disease markers.
ANCA have 2 major speciﬁcities:
• Antiproteinase 3 antibodies (anti-PR3)—associated with c-ANCA
pattern
• Antimyeloperoxidase antibodies (anti-MPO)—associated with
p-ANCA pattern.
c-ANCA (anti-PR3) targets proteinase 3 and may suggest Wegener’s
granulomatosis (75% of cases are c-ANCA positive). Levels correlate
with disease activity and extent. Also found in patients with microscopic
polyangiitis (45% of those with clinical disease will be c-ANCA positive).
p-ANCA (anti-MPO) targets myeloperoxidase and has a wider range of
disease associations, including other vasculitides and autoimmune diseases, HIV, lung cancer, pulmonary ﬁbrosis, and pulmonary emboli.

CHAPTER 51

Vasculitis and the lung

Wegener’s granulomatosis: presentation
and diagnosis
Deﬁnition and epidemiology Necrotizing vasculitis affecting small
and medium size vessels, especially in the upper and lower respiratory
tract and also the kidneys. Associated granulomata.
• Unknown cause
• Male = female
• 3/100 000, 80–97% Caucasian
• Any age, but most common between 40 and 55 years

Clinical features
• ENT In 90%, upper airways involvement will be the ﬁrst presenting sign.
Nasal congestion and epistaxis, with inﬂamed crusty ulcerated nasal
mucosa. Nasal septum perforation. Late sign is a saddle nose deformity.
Sinusitis is common and may be painful. Otitis media. Subglottic stenosis, causing upper airway obstruction, dyspnoea, voice change, and
cough. Abnormal ﬂow–volume loops
• Lung Affected in 85–90% of patients. Haemoptysis, cough, dyspnoea.
Pleuritic chest pain
• Kidney Affected in 77% of patients. Haematuria, proteinuria, and red
cell casts. Only 10% have renal impairment initially, but 80% will have
involvement during their disease course. Characteristic progressive
deterioration of renal function
• Systemic Fever and weight loss
• Other organ systems (skin, eyes, joints, CNS) Vasculitic skin rash
with granulomatous involvement in 46%. Muscle and joint pains.
Conjunctivitis, scleritis, proptosis, eye pain, visual loss. Mononeuritis
multiplex and CNS disease.

Investigations
Consider:
• CXR Flitting cavitating pulmonary nodules, consolidation, or pulmonary
inﬁltrates, alveolar haemorrhage, parenchymal distortion, large and
small airway disease, pleural effusion, bronchiectasis. Can look like neoplasms, infection, or ﬂuid overload
• HRCT of chest
• Oxygen saturations
• FBC, U&E, CRP, ESR
• Serum ANCA, especially c-ANCA, is sensitive and fairly speciﬁc. Present
in 90% of patients with extensive Wegener’s and 75% with limited. pANCA positive in 5–10% of patients with Wegener’s. Combining indirect
immunoﬂuorescence with speciﬁc immunoassays for antibodies to PR3
and MPO increases sensitivity and speciﬁcity for Wegner’s and microscopic polyangiitis to over 90%. Remember ANCA can be negative,
especially in disease conﬁned to the respiratory tract. ANCA titres
rise prior to a relapse and are higher when disease is active, and this can
act as a guide to starting treatment. However, high ANCA levels in the
absence of clinical symptoms or signs may not represent active disease,

and therefore ANCA levels should not be used in isolation to determine treatment. Consider CRP ± ESR also
Urine dipstick and microscopy Red cell casts
Pulmonary function tests, including kCO
Image sinuses Bony destruction makes Wegener’s likely
Bronchoscopy May show inﬂammation and ulceration of larynx, trachea,
and bronchi. Scarring and stenosis may be seen. BAL is neutrophilic,
also with eosinophils and lymphocytes. Transbronchial biopsy is unlikely
to be diagnostic
Biopsy
• Respiratory tract and nose—granulomata in association with medium
and small vessel necrotizing vasculitis and surrounding inﬂammation.
Nasal biopsies are often non-speciﬁc and may not be diagnostic
• Renal biopsy—focal segmental or diffuse necrotizing glomerulonephritis. Pauci-immune and granulomata rare. Not speciﬁc for
Wegener’s
• Skin biopsy—leucocytoclastic vasculitis ± granulomata

Diagnosis Biopsy and ANCA are key to diagnosis. Biopsy whichever site
is affected. May be nasal, lung (open or thoracoscopic), skin, or renal. If
there is evidence on urine dip of renal vasculitis, this may be the best
and easiest biopsy site. Disease may be patchy in nature, requiring repeat
biopsies if the ﬁrst is negative. High c-ANCA and anti-proteinase 3 (PR3)
is highly suggestive of Wegener’s.
Differential diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis
Malignancy, TB, sarcoidosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,
Goodpasture’s disease (anti-glomerular basement membrane disease with
pulmonary haemorrhage and nephritis), SLE, microscopic polyangiitis, connective tissue disease.

CHAPTER 51

Vasculitis and the lung

Wegener’s granulomatosis:
management
Involve the renal team and share care of the patient. See p 675 for immunosuppressive drug details.
• Standard regimen for generalized or organ-threatening disease
(e.g. active/progressive pulmonary or renal disease or CNS disease):
• Induce remission with oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day, tapering
weekly to a dose of 15 mg or less daily by 3 months) and cyclophosphamide orally (2 mg/kg/day, up to 200 mg/day) or IV (pulses at 2- or
3-week intervals, 15 mg/kg) for 3–6 months. Reduce cyclophosphamide dose in elderly (e.g. reduce oral dose by 25% if >60 years, and
by 50% if over 75 years) and in setting of renal impairment. Taper
cyclophosphamide dose to maintain WCC>4 × 109/L and neutrophils >2 × 109, to reduce infection risk (see p 679 for more detail)
• The aim is to prevent irreversible tissue necrosis. There is evidence
that this regime induces remission in 80% of patients at 3 months
and 90% at 6 months
• After induction of remission (at 3–6 months), consider switch from
cyclophosphamide and prednisolone to maintenance therapy with
prednisolone and either azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day for 12 months,
then reduce to 1.5 mg/kg/day; check TPMT levels, p 678 ) or methotrexate (15 mg once/week, increase to maximum of 20–25 mg once/
week by week 12; p 680 ). This avoids the morbidity associated with
long-term cyclophosphamide use. Both azathioprine and methotrexate have been demonstrated to maintain remission, although the
evidence favours use of azathioprine
• Restart the regime if the patient relapses—this may occur in 50%
• For severe life-threatening disease (e.g. rapidly progressive renal
failure or massive pulmonary haemorrhage):
• Plasma exchange/plasmapheresis (7 x 4 L exchanges over 2 weeks)
has been shown to be more effective than methylprednisolone in
the treatment of Wegener’s granulomatosis. In patients with severe
pulmonary haemorrhage it is also effective and can be given along
with fresh frozen plasma
• In addition, treat with pulsed methylprednisolone (500–1000 mg/day
depending on body weight for 3 days) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg, reduce if elderly or renal impairment)
• Dialysis for renal failure
• After induction of remission (over 3–6 months), switch from cyclophosphamide to azathioprine or methotrexate with prednisolone as
maintenance therapy
• For localized disease or early systemic disease (without threatened
organ involvement):
• Prednisolone with either methotrexate or oral/pulsed cyclophosphamide. Use of methotrexate avoids cyclophosphamide-related
toxicity, but may be associated with a higher relapse rate. Localized
disease may still be serious (e.g. retro-orbital involvement), and in
these situations cyclophosphamide should be considered.

WEGENER’S GRANULOMATOSIS: MANAGEMENT

• Duration of treatment Maintenance therapy is recommended to continue for at least 24 months after initial disease remission, as relapses
are common. Some recommend continuing treatment for up to 5 years,
particularly if the ANCA remains positive
• PCP prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole is recommended (960 mg
3×/week) in patients receiving cyclophosphamide and prednisolone.
There is some evidence that co-trimoxazole alone may be effective in
the treatment of especially limited Wegener’s, although the reasons for
this are not clear—it may be due to suppression of nasal Staphylococcus
aureus carriage, the presence of which is associated with an increased
risk of relapse
• Osteoporosis prophylaxis should be considered
• Follow-up monthly for 3 months, then 3–6 monthly. Monitor FBC,
U&E, CRP, LFT, ANCA, CXR, and kCO. Rising ANCA titres are a poor
predictor of relapse; in the absence of other features of a relapse,
follow up more closely, but do not increase immunosuppression solely
on this basis. Withdrawal of immunosuppression in the setting of a
persistently positive ANCA is associated with relapse, however
• Relapses Treat minor relapses with an increase in the prednisolone
dose. Treat major relapses with cyclophosphamide and increasing
prednisolone; consider IV methyprednisolone, plasma exchange
• Refractory disease Liaise with specialist; consider alternative therapies
such as inﬂiximab, high-dose IV immunoglobulin, rituximab, anti-thymocyte
globulin, or CAMPATH 1H (alemtuzumab, anti-CD52). Mycophenolate
or leﬂunomide are alternatives to azathioprine or methotrexate.
Exclude underlying infection, malignancy, and non-compliance

Prognosis Limited disease with pulmonary but no renal involvement and
an often negative c-ANCA test has a better prognosis. However, this can
progress over time to extensive disease, with classical destructive sinusitis,
nephritis, and vasculitis and strong c-ANCA positivity, and is associated
with higher mortality. Untreated, 80% of people with extensive Wegener’s
will die in 1 year. Overall, 75–90% of patients can be brought into remission
with treatment, although 50% relapse in 5 years and long-term follow-up
is required.

CHAPTER 51

Vasculitis and the lung

Microscopic polyangiitis
At least as common as Wegener’s and may be hard to distinguish. Managed
in the same way.
• Incidence Male = female, mean age 50, mainly Caucasians
• Kidneys Main organ affected by a small vessel necrotizing vasculitis,
causing proteinuria, and haematuria. Renal biopsy shows focal segmental glomerulonephritis with ﬁbrinoid necrosis and sparse immune
deposits
• Pulmonary involvement occurs in 30–50% of patients, with pleurisy,
asthma, haemoptysis, and pulmonary haemorrhage. CXR may be suggestive of pulmonary haemorrhage
• p-ANCA positive, often c-ANCA also.

Treatment with immunosuppression: steroids and cyclophosphamide
(see previous page).
Future developments
It had been thought that anti TNFA agents were likely to have a role in
acute vasculitis and seemed to work best in granulomatous disease.
A randomized controlled trial of etanercept plus standard therapy for
Wegener’s granulomatosis showed no signiﬁcant effect on remission rates
(NEJM 2005; 352: 351–61). Further studies are ongoing of other antiTNFα agents.
B-cell depletion with the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. This
is used for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis. Encouraging
results in small studies of ANCA positive vasculitis, but no RCT as yet.
Mycophenolate for immunosupression in vasculitis to induce remission.
Used post-transplant. A large study vs. azathioprine is underway.

CHAPTER 51

Vasculitis and the lung

Goodpasture’s disease
Deﬁnition and epidemiology Linear deposition of IgG on the basement membranes of alveoli and glomeruli, which damages collagen and in
the lungs allows leakage of blood.
• Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies are detectable in blood
• Alveolar haemorrhage and glomerulonephritis
• Important differential diagnosis of pulmonary–renal syndrome
• Annual incidence of 1 case per million
• Male:female = 4:1
• Commonest age 20–30 years
• Second peak when women in their late 60s are affected by glomerulonephritis alone
• Cause unknown. Often a preceding viral infection. Smokers at greater
risk of pulmonary haemorrhage, but not of Goodpasture’s disease
• HLA DR2 association in 60–70%.

Clinical features
• Haemoptysis in 80–90%—more common in smokers
• Cough, dyspnoea, fatigue, and weakness
• Examination: inspiratory crackles common.

Investigations
• Serum electrolytes show impaired renal function and often renal failure
• FBC Iron deﬁciency anaemia
• Urine dip and microscopy Haematuria, proteinuria, granular and typically red blood cell casts. Occasionally macroscopic haematuria
• Anti-GBM and autoantibody screen
• CXR ± CT Diffuse bilateral patchy air space shadowing in mid and
lower zones. May see air bronchograms
• PFTs Restrictive defect with raised kCO if alveolar haemorrhage
present.

Diagnosis Renal biopsy usually shows diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. Linear IgG deposition detected by immunoﬂuorescence or
immunoperoxidase. Lung biopsy shows active intra-alveolar haemorrhage
with collections of haemosiderin laden macrophages. These are not speciﬁc
changes, but may also show linear immunoﬂuorescence staining of IgG.
Differential diagnosis Wegener’s granulomatosis, other pulmonary
renal syndromes.

Management
• Involve the renal team and share care of the patient
• Plasma exchange improves the speed of response to immunosuppression
• High-dose steroids and cyclophosphamide
• May need dialysis. Renal function may not improve and renal transplant
is only an option later if anti-GBM antibody levels become low
• Recurrence is uncommon once disease is controlled. It usually responds
to further immunosuppression. Residual defects in PFTs frequent.

Prognosis Rapidly progressive pulmonary haemorrhage and renal failure.
Usually fatal if not treated.

CHAPTER 51

Vasculitis and the lung

Churg–Strauss syndrome
Deﬁnition and epidemiology Asthma, blood eosinophilia, and an
eosinophilic granulomatous inﬂammation of the respiratory tract, with
necrotizing vasculitis affecting small and medium sized vessels.
• Rare, 2.4 per million population, but 64 per million of an asthmatic
population (who may have been misdiagnosed with asthma)
• Middle-aged adults
• 2 male:1 female
• Unknown cause. Montelukast was postulated as a possible cause, but
this is now thought unlikely. Development of Churg–Strauss syndrome
in people on montelukast probably related to their decreased steroid
dose ‘unmasking’ Churg–Strauss syndrome, or as part of an increasing
treatment regime in those with uncontrolled asthma, later diagnosed as
Churg Strauss syndrome.
Clinical features A diagnosis of Churg–Strauss syndrome can be made
if 4 of the following 6 criteria are present:
• Asthma—may have had for years, often maturity onset, difﬁcult to
control, associated with rhinitis and nasal polyps
• Blood eosinophilia >10%
• Vasculitic neuropathy, such as mononeuritis multiplex (occurs in 75%)
• Pulmonary inﬁltrates
• Sinus disease
• Extravascular eosinophils on biopsy ﬁndings.
(American College of Rheumatology criteria, 1990)
• Also may have:
• Myositis and cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery inﬂammation, pericardial effusion
• Eosinophilic inﬁltration of mesenteric vessels causing GI disturbance
• Alveolar haemorrhage
• Rarely, proteinuria caused by renal disease with focal segmental glomerulonephritis. Renal failure is rare
• Skin nodules and purpura
• Myalgia and arthralgia
• Fever and weight loss.
Typical pattern of disease has three phases: beginning with asthma, then
developing blood and tissue eosinophilia, then going on to systemic vasculitis. The asthma precedes the vasculitis, often by years (mean 8 years).

Investigations
• CXR Fleeting peripheral pulmonary inﬁltrates and bilateral multifocal
consolidation
• HRCT Ground-glass inﬂammation, pulmonary nodules, bronchial wall
thickening, or alveolar haemorrhage
• Bronchoscopy BAL: marked eosinophilia
• Pathology Extravascular tissue eosinophilia, necrotizing angiitis,
granulomata
• Serum markers Peripheral blood eosinophilia. p-ANCA and anti-MPO
positive in two-thirds. ANCA levels may not correlate with disease
activity, but blood eosinophilia is a good guide.

CHURG–STRAUSS SYNDROME

Diagnosis Predominantly a clinical diagnosis. Pathological conﬁrmation
of eosinophilic tissue inﬁltration or vasculitis desirable. Biopsy easiest site
affected, such as skin, kidney, or open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy.
Differential diagnosis Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, sarcoidosis, drug and parasitic causes of eosinophilic pneumonias, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome.
Management Depends on severity of disease at presentation.
• If isolated pulmonary disease, oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg (max 60 mg/
day) for 1 month or until no evidence of disease, then slowly decrease
over 1 year, with increases if symptoms recur
• If unwell, or with alveolar haemorrhage, pulsed methylprednisolone IV
for 3 days, followed by high-dose oral steroids, with or without cyclophosphamide (see p 678 and 680)
• In cardiac or GI disease, relapse, or life-threatening situations, such as
requiring organ support, cyclophosphamide should be added (see p 680)
• Plasma exchange is of no beneﬁt
• Treatment is aimed at reversing organ damage and reducing relapse
rate
• To maintain remission, prednisolone and one other immunosuppressant drug are usually required. Cyclophosphamide is often changed to
azathioprine after 4–6 months
• Prophylactic co-trimoxazole should be given (960 mg 3×/week) and
consider bone protection for steroids
• Follow-up: regularly, with checks on FBC and eosinophil count, CXR.

Prognosis Good prognosis if isolated pulmonary disease. Good response to
steroids. May continue to have asthma despite control of vasculitis, which can
be severe and difﬁcult to control. Poor prognosis associated with cardiac
disease and severe gastrointestinal disease, causing bleeding, perforation, or
necrosis. Untreated, 5-year survival rate is 25%. Also associated with worse
prognosis: proteinuria >1 g/24 h, renal insufﬁciency, CNS involvement. Cardiac

CHAPTER 52

Ethical issues

Background
Most ethical issues faced by doctors arise at the end of a patient’s life.
This particularly applies to respiratory physicians, where difﬁcult decisions
about the appropriateness of treatment and the prolongation of life in
patients with chronic underlying lung disease may need to be made. In
some situations artiﬁcial ventilation may prolong the dying process; life has
a natural end and the potential to prolong life in the intensive care unit
can sometimes cause dilemmas.
The General Medical Council (GMC) states that doctors have an obligation to respect human life, protect the health of their patients, and put
their patients’ best interests ﬁrst. This means offering treatments where
the beneﬁts outweigh any risks, and avoiding treatments that carry no net
gain to the patient. If a patient wishes to have a treatment that in the doctor’s considered view is not indicated, the doctor and medical team are
under no ethical or legal obligation to provide it, but the patient’s right to
a second opinion must be respected.
The discussion about resuscitation and formal ventilation is never an
easy one, but should ideally be taken with nursing staff, the patient, and
their next of kin, in advance of an emergency situation. In practical terms,
clearly this is not always possible. Ideally all decisions regarding resuscitation and the ceiling of treatment (particularly relating to ventilation)
should be documented in advance, and handed over to the on-call team.
Most possible outcomes can be anticipated.
Where it has been decided that a treatment is not in the best interests
of the patient, there is no ethical distinction between stopping the treatment, or not starting it in the ﬁrst place (though the former may be more
difﬁcult to do), and this should not be used as an argument for failing to
initiate the treatment in the ﬁrst place.
Some clinical scenarios are more commonly encountered by the respiratory physician. These are discussed on the next pages.

CHAPTER 52

Ethical issues

COPD
COPD is the 4th commonest cause of death in America, and most patients
die of respiratory failure during an exacerbation. A commonly encountered clinical situation is where a patient with COPD is admitted with an
exacerbation, and is in type II respiratory failure. Standard treatment does
not improve the respiratory acidosis, so non-invasive ventilation is commenced. Before starting NIV, a decision must be clearly documented as to
whether or not NIV is the ceiling of treatment. It may be, especially if the
patient has severe or end-stage COPD.
Formal ventilation in the intensive care unit may be appropriate in
certain speciﬁc situations; for example:
• In a relatively young patient (i.e. <65 years)
• A patient with a relatively new diagnosis of COPD, in whom the
episode is the ﬁrst or second admission
• In the patient in whom there is a very obviously potentially reversible
cause for the exacerbation, e.g. pneumonia
Sometimes in this situation, a deﬁned time period for intensive care input
may be decided, e.g. ventilation for 48 h (to allow treatments to work and
to allow time to assess for any improvement), with extubation after that
time period if no improvement has been made.
Decisions about formal ventilation and intensive care admission can
only be made with knowledge of the patient’s usual level of functioning
and previous quality of life. The difﬁculty in this situation is that quality of
life is a very subjective measure. Objective measures of usual functioning,
such as measures of daily activity, usual exercise tolerance, and whether
home care or assistance with activities of daily living is required are more
useful in guiding the appropriateness of escalating therapy. With particular
reference to the patient with COPD, the number of hospital admissions
and exacerbations, and the need for home oxygen or nebulizers will also
be useful. Helpful information may be obtained from the GP, especially if
the previous hospital notes are unavailable.
Neither the next of kin nor those with Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA)
have the legal right to determine any treatment; the responsibility remains
with the doctor and multidisciplinary team, occasionally involving the courts
of law. Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) replaced EPA from October 07.
This allows an appointed attorney to make decisions about personal
welfare, including giving or refusing consent to treatment, if the patient
loses their capacity.
Where limited information is available about the patient and therefore
uncertainty exists about the appropriateness of ventilation, it should be
started until a clearer assessment can be made. This may be relevant for a
patient attending the accident and emergency department, in whom little
information is available. The above point concerning the withdrawal of
therapy, should it subsequently be found to be inappropriate, also holds.

COPD

There are downsides to invasive ventilation: the risk of pneumothorax
is increased in those with end-stage emphysema, and the risk of ventilatoracquired pneumonia increases with time ventilated. Knowledge of the risk
of these adverse events helps the medical team to balance the argument
and make a decision about whether the risks of ventilation are likely to
outweigh its beneﬁts. The issue of limited resources should not inﬂuence a
decision about formal ventilation or ITU admission.
The average length of intubation of patients with COPD admitted
to ITU is 3.2 days. These patients have a 20–25% in-hospital mortality,
with 50% of patients surviving 1 year post-ITU discharge. About 50% will
be living independently 1 year post-hospital discharge. Clearly, only a very
selected subgroup of patients are admitted to ITU, but concerns about
prolonged periods of ventilation in this group of patients seem to be
unfounded. Patients in whom a clear cause for the exacerbation can be
identiﬁed (e.g. pneumonia) tend to do better, as there is a treatable cause
for the exacerbation and not just progression of the underlying disease.

669

670

CHAPTER 52

Ethical issues

Lung cancer and neurological disease
Lung cancer The use of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia in a patient
with advanced lung malignancy may be inappropriate in some circumstances. The stage and extent of disease, response to other treatments
(e.g. chemotherapy), and the patient’s wishes and quality of life are all paramount. This is another situation in which it might be appropriate to deﬁne
at the outset the treatments that are appropriate, e.g. 10 days total of
intravenous and oral antibiotics. Note that treatments such as antibiotics
can lead to improvement in symptoms (e.g. by reducing fever), without
necessarily prolonging life, and it may be kinder to continue antibiotics in
this situation.

Progressive neurological disease The decision about non-invasive
ventilation in a patient with a progressive neuromuscular disease can be difﬁcult. In this setting the clinical deterioration can usually be anticipated, and
in most situations, discussion should have taken place early on (unless the
patient presents in respiratory failure, for example, due to pneumonia, and
subsequent ventilator weaning is difﬁcult). Different centres, patients, and
their relatives will have differing views as to whether life-prolonging noninvasive ventilation in the face of progressive neuromuscular disability is
warranted. Some centres take the view that if the quality of life and higher
mental functioning are good, and the respiratory muscles are affected
early on (and other functions and mobility remain good), then NIV is warranted. Further decisions about withdrawal of treatment with progression
of the underlying neurological disease of course will still be needed. In,
for example, motor neurone disease with bulbar palsy, aspiration is a relative contraindication to non-invasive/mask ventilation. Aspiration in these
patients is a poor prognostic sign, and often a sign of imminent death.
Advance directive documents the patient’s wishes in the event of serious
illness. It will usually include a decision about resuscitation and other
potential life-prolonging treatments. The patient must understand the
implications of his/her decision.

CHAPTER 53

Financial entitlements

Patient ﬁnancial entitlements
Patients with chronic lung disease and their carers may be eligible for
ﬁnancial support. There are a large number of potential beneﬁts that can
be claimed, and the process is often time-consuming and complicated. The
best sources of information are:
• Beneﬁts Enquiry Line 0800 882200 (0800 220674 in Northern Ireland)
• Website www.dwp.gov.uk. Forms can be completed on-line
• The Citizens Advice Bureau www.nacab.org.uk
• The ward social worker is usually a good source of information

Patients who are unable to work may be eligible for:
Statutory sick pay (SSP) A doctor’s certiﬁcate is usually required for
more than 1 week’s sick pay. New rules now make the doctor’s certiﬁcate
the responsibility of the hospital consultant under whom the patient was
admitted, and it should be completed on discharge, to cover the advised
period off work. This also applies to patients needing time off work, but
not admitted to hospital. Nursing staff usually complete the forms for the
period during which the patient was in hospital.
Incapacity beneﬁt is more complicated and is paid to people not eligible
for SSP. It runs for up to a year. After 196 days (the ﬁrst period is usually
covered by a medical certiﬁcate) the patient may have to pass a personal
capability assessment to show they are incapable of work.
Severe disablement allowance
Income-related beneﬁt
Beneﬁt for the extra cost of disability
Disabled persons tax credit (DPTC) This is not a beneﬁt as such, but a tax
credit from the Inland Revenue (paid in addition to beneﬁts).
Severe disablement allowance if a test of 80% disablement is passed.
Disability living allowance or attendance allowance are beneﬁts for the
extra costs of disability and depend on age (>or <65 years)
Costs for care needs and mobility needs
Industrial diseases disablement beneﬁt. See pneumoconiosis p 363 and
asbestosis p 118.

PATIENT FINANCIAL ENTITLEMENTS

Reduced earning allowance
Form DS1500, the ‘special rules form’, is for more urgent beneﬁts for
patients with terminal disease, in whom life expectancy is not likely to
exceed 6 months. Patients with a terminal illness can also usually claim
attendance allowance, incapacity beneﬁt, and disabled living allowance
under ‘special rules’. This means that the claim is processed as a priority,
with no qualifying period, allowing higher rates of payment, and without
the individual having to prove how much care is needed. The application
can be made on behalf of the patient, who does not have to sign the form.
This may be appropriate if the patient has not been told the exact details
of their life expectancy.

CHAPTER 54

Immunosuppressive drugs

Patient advice and monitoring
Immunosuppressive drugs are used mainly in the management of pulmonary vasculitis, but also in asthma, sarcoidosis, and interstitial lung diseases.
Centres differ in their use of these drugs and local guidelines are often
available.

General advice for patients on immunosuppressive drugs
• Increased risk of infections and increased likelihood of severe infections. Check FBC if develop febrile illness
• May have atypical presentation of infections
• Avoid live vaccines, such as measles, mumps, rubella, BCG, yellow
fever, oral typhoid, oral polio
• If never had varicella zoster:
• Avoid contacts with chickenpox or shingles
• Consider passive immunization
• Immunoglobulin therapy if exposed
• Hospital treatment with close monitoring if develop chickenpox
• Avoid measles exposure. Prophylaxis with immunoglobulins if
exposed.

CHAPTER 54

Immunosuppressive drugs

Corticosteroids and azathioprine
Corticosteroids
• First-line treatment for suppressing inﬂammation. At high doses, also
cause immunosuppression. Ineffective as sole therapy for induction of
remission in systemic vasculitis
• IV methylprednisolone (500–1000 mg/day) for 3–5 days can be used for
aggressive induction of remission, e.g. Wegener’s granulomatosis, followed by maintenance oral steroids (prednisolone 30–40 mg/day)
• Usually taken in the morning as they may disturb sleep
• Dose should be slowly reduced when control of the disease is
achieved. Gastric and bone protection may be necessary as the patient
will be on high doses for some months. Also ensure BP and glucose are
controlled
• Ensure patients have steroid treatment card.
Side-effects include skin and hair thinning, obesity, cataracts, diabetes,
and aseptic bone necrosis. Inform patient of these and document. PCP
infection can occur secondary to steroid treatment, particularly with high
doses for prolonged periods. Some centres use PCP prophylaxis.

Steroids and osteoporosis
Current guidelines suggest patients being started on long-term steroids,
with one other osteoporosis risk factor (such as being over 65 or having
had a previous osteoporotic fracture), should also start on a bisphosphonate.
In other patients who will be on 7.5mg/day or more for more than
3 months, consider checking bone mineral density via DEXA scan of
hip and spine, and offer lifestyle advice and bisphosphonates if this is
reduced (T score –1.5 or lower).
(see Royal College of Physicians guidelines, www.rcplondon.ac.uk
and National Osteoporosis Society, www.nos.org.uk)

Azathioprine
• Mainly used as a steroid-sparing agent, or when vasculitis is under
control to enable cyclophosphamide to be stopped. Takes approx.
4 weeks to work
• Cytotoxic drug, less effective than cyclophosphamide. May be reasonable alternative if side-effects of cyclophosphamide are unacceptable
• Maximal effect on disease may not be evident for 6–9 months, but can
be used long term
• TPMT (thiopurine methyltransferase) testing should be performed
prior to commencement. TPMT breaks down azathioprine to an inactive product. 90% of the population have normal TPMT levels, 10% have
intermediate activity, so azathioprine should be given with caution; 0.3%
have no TPMT activity and azathioprine should be avoided

CORTICOSTEROIDS AND AZATHIOPRINE

• For vasculitis, start with 2 mg per kg/day after cyclophosphamide.
Maximum dose usually around 150–200 mg/day
• As steroid sparing regime: could start 50 mg od for 2 weeks, increasing
to 100 mg od for 2 weeks, if FBC satisfactory and increasing to 150mg
od (or 75mg bd) after further 2 weeks FBC satisfactory. Reduce prednisolone by 5 mg every 4 weeks
• Check FBC every 2 weeks for 6 weeks, then at 2 and 4 weeks after
each dose increase and thereafter monthly. Check LFTs monthly.
Stop treatment if WCC <3, platelets <100, or ALP and transaminases
3× normal. Restart when they recover.
Side-effects include sore mouth, ulcers, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea,
skin rash, alopecia (rare). Most respond to stopping the drug and restarting
at a lower dose. Interacts with allopurinol and leads to increased toxicity.

679

680

CHAPTER 54

Immunosuppressive drugs

Methotrexate and cyclophosphamide
Methotrexate
• Can be used as a second-line treatment
• Dose: 7.5–25 mg once/week. Usual starting dose is 10 mg. Can increase
after 6 weeks to 15 mg, in increments of 2.5 mg weekly
• Baseline CXR. Monitor FBC, U&E, and LFTs every 2 weeks for
3 months then monthly. Give folic acid 5 mg 3–4 days after dose, to
reduce toxicity.
Side-effects include mouth ulcers, skin rashes, nausea, macrocytosis, myelosuppression, pneumonitis (dyspnoea and dry cough). Avoid if signiﬁcant
renal or hepatic impairment, or if pleural effusions or ascites, as it can
accumulate in these ﬂuids. Stop if WCC <3, platelets <100, transaminases
3× normal, pneumonitis.

Cyclophosphamide
• The primary cytotoxic drug used for treating systemic vasculitis
• Causes immunosuppression without anti-inﬂammatory effects
• Used particularly if there are life- or organ-threatening features, e.g.
ventilation for lung vasculitis, systemic features, renal involvement
• Takes 12–14 days to work; hence is combined with high-dose steroids
at the beginning of treatment. When combined with steroids, it induces
remission of vasculitis in 90% of patients
• Perform a baseline urine dip for blood prior to treatment (although
note microscopic haematuria is common with active vasculitis). Check
routinely for macroscopic haematuria in patients receiving IV cyclophosphamide and, if it is present, stop drug and arrange cystoscopy
(rare if mesna is used, and rare with oral cyclophosphamide regimes)
• PCP prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole is recommended (960 mg
3×/week) in patients receiving cyclophosphamide and prednisolone
• Semen storage for men prior to starting treatment.
Usual treatment duration of cyclophosphamide is 3–6 months. Courses
longer than 6 months should generally be avoided; they are no more effective and carry the risk of side-effects from the cumulative dose. Induce
remission with cyclophosphamide and prednisolone and maintain remission with prednisolone and another immunosuppressant (azathioprine, or
methotrexate) for at least 2 years.
Side-effects Haemorrhagic cystitis is a potentially serious side-effect of
cyclophosphamide therapy. Risk of bladder cancer is increased (and is
greater with increasing cumulative dose), and indeﬁnite monitoring of
urinalysis 3–6-monthly after treatment with cyclophosphamide is recommended. Other side-effects include nausea, vomiting, infection (including
PCP), hair thinning or alopecia, bone marrow suppression (2%), leucopenia,
infertility, lymphoma (0.7%) and leukaemia, pulmonary and bladder ﬁbrosis.
Risk of cervical cancer may be higher—recommend annual cervical smear
for 3 years, and thereafter as per population screening programme.

METHOTREXATE AND CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE

Cyclophosphamide regimes
Oral cyclophosphamide is used if possible in active vasculitis, at a dose of
2 mg/kg (up to 200 mg/day). Reduce dose in elderly (by 25% if >60 years,
and by 50% if over 75 years) and in setting of renal impairment
Monitoring Check FBC and renal function weekly for the ﬁrst month,
2-weekly for the 2nd and 3rd month, and monthly thereafter.
• If WCC <4 × 109/L, neutrophils <2 × 109/L, stop oral cyclophosphamide and restart with dose reduced by at least 25 mg when WCC
recovered, and then monitor weekly for 4 weeks
• If prolonged (WCC <4 × 109/L, neutrophils <2 × 109/L for >2 weeks)
or severe (WCC <1 × 109/L, neutrophils <0.5 × 109/L) leucopenia/
neutropenia, stop cyclophosphamide and restart at 50 mg daily
when WCC recovered; then increase to target dose weekly, WCC
permitting
• If WCC is falling (<6 × 109/L and fall of >2 × 109/L since previous
count), reduce dose by 25%.
Pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide is given if patients cannot
take oral preparations, using doses of 15 mg/kg (reduced for age and
renal function, maximum dose 1500 mg) every 2 weeks for the ﬁrst
3 pulses and then at 3-weekly intervals. The lowest white cell count
occurs 10 days after a pulse. A randomized study has shown that pulsed
doses give a lower cumulative dose than oral regimes, but there is no
difference in remission rates between the two. The infection rate is
higher with oral regimes (European Vasculitis Study Group).
If giving IV cyclophosphamide, patients should be well hydrated before
(1 L normal saline) and after (3 L/day oral ﬂuids for 3 days), and given
mesna, which chelates with the urotoxic cyclophosphamide metabolite,
acrolein. Dose varies according to the cyclophosphamide dose and is
available on product literature. Give during cyclophosphamide infusion,
and also 4 and 8 h after. Prescribe anti-emetics.
Monitoring Check FBC and renal function on day of pulse or previous
day.
• If WCC <4 × 109/L, neutrophils <2 × 109/L, postpone pulse until
WCC >4 × 109/L, neutrophils >2 × 109/L, whilst checking FBC
weekly, and reduce dose by 25%
• After ﬁrst pulse, check FBC between days 10 and day of next pulse:
reduce dose of next pulse by 40% of previous dose if WCC nadir
1–2 × 109/L or neutrophil nadir 0.5–1.0 × 109/L
• Reduce dose of next pulse by 20% of previous dose if WCC nadir
2–3 × 109/L or neutrophil nadir 1–1.5 × 109/L
• Thereafter check FBC on day of pulse or previous day, unless dose
adjustment when checked additionally at day 10.

CHAPTER 55

Inhalers and nebulizers

Background
Inhalers
• There are many different inhaler devices that deliver drugs directly to
the airways
• Ideally patients should try a range of devices to choose the most
appropriate for them
• Patients should receive advice on techniques for inhaler use. Technique
should be checked regularly, and if patients cannot manage a particular
device, they should be switched to another
• The percentage of a drug delivered to the airway varies for each device
(from 15% to 60% according to the manufacturers) and depends on
good technique
• Spacer devices improve this delivery and are particularly useful for the
elderly, children, and those who ﬁnd it difﬁcult to coordinate inhaler
administration with breathing
• Try to use the same inhaler device for all the drug classes used by a
patient
• Advise the patient how to recognize when a device is empty: some
have dose counters; others are shaken to hear if they still have contents
• Titrate inhaler doses with clinical response.

Nebulizers are used by patients who gain greater relief from nebulized
therapy than from inhaled therapy. This may be during acute respiratory
illnesses, because of disease severity, or because they are unable to use
inhalers. Patients who are being considered for nebulizer therapy should
be referred to a respiratory physician. If antibiotics are being nebulized, a
more powerful nebulizer is required.
How to use Open the ampoule containing the drug solution and squirt
the solution into the nebulizer chamber. Salbutamol and ipratropium
bromide can be taken together, but nebulized budesonide or antibiotics
should be used separately. If ipratropium bromide only is being used, this
should be delivered via a mouthpiece, as it can lead to glaucoma if used
via a mask. Reattach the chamber to the nebulizer mask or mouthpiece.
Put the mask over nose and mouth, or position mouthpiece between the
lips in the mouth. Switch the nebulizer machine on. Breathe slowly in and
out. Continue until all the solution is gone. Switch off the machine. Rinse
the nebulizer chamber with hot soapy water after each use. If nebulization
takes more than 10 min, change the neb-set (mask, chamber, tubing—lasts
1–3 months). If no improvement, consider servicing the machine. If the
patient is using oxygen, this can still be used during nebulization, either via
nasal prongs under the nebulizer mask or by using oxygen tubing attached
directly to the nebulizer chamber to drive the nebulization; at home most
cylinders do not provide sufﬁcient ﬂow rates to allow this. Nebulizer
machines should be serviced annually.

CHAPTER 56

Intensive therapy unit (ITU)

Ideally communicate with ITU early, as it is much better that they know
about a potentially sick patient who may need ITU input, than to ﬁnd your
patient (and you!) in difﬁculty later on, with no ITU bed.
Scoring systems for the early recognition of sick patients are in use in
many hospitals, enabling doctors and nursing staff to readily identify and
assess a deteriorating patient. An example is shown on the opposite page.
The common situations in which ITU input may be required in relation to respiratory disease are principally those relating to decisions about
formal ventilation. Most commonly these will be:
• Respiratory failure (either type I or type II)
• Exacerbation of COPD (usually type II failure). Patients with COPD
admitted to ITU have a hospital mortality of 20–25%. Poor prognostic factors include low baseline FEV1, long-term oxygen use, low
sodium and albumin, low BMI, poor functional status, and comorbid
disease. Age does not add prognostic information
• Pneumonia (to maintain an adequate pO2—usually type I failure).
In this situation, ITU input may not necessarily lead to intubation, as
adequate oxygenation may be achieved by the proper use of a nonrebreathable mask or CPAP, with the additional beneﬁts of one-toone nursing. Altered mental state and difﬁculty clearing secretions
may make invasive ventilation necessary
• Upper airway emergencies
• ≥1 organ failure (not necessarily with respiratory failure)
• Sepsis requiring organ support
• Inotropic support.

PAR SCORING SYSTEM

CHAPTER 57

Non-invasive ventilation

Terminology
Ventilatory support may be invasive (via endotracheal tube or tracheostomy) or non-invasive (via nose mask or face mask). Non-invasive ventilation may be subdivided into positive or negative pressure ventilation.

Positive pressure ventilators (also NIV, bi-level, BiPAP (trade name))
deliver volume or pressure support; many different types are available. Bilevel pressure support devices are used extensively, and provide pressure
support between inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures
(IPAP and EPAP) that are selected by the prescriber. They function in several
modes, including patient-triggered inspiratory support with provision of an
underlying back-up rate that will cut in if the patient fails to breathe. Noninvasive positive pressure support may be provided by specialized portable
ventilators, or by standard critical care ventilators.

Negative pressure ventilators assist inspiration by ‘sucking out’ the
chest wall; expiration occurs through elastic recoil of the lungs. Includes
devices such as tank ventilators and chest ‘shell’ ventilators. Other devices
such as the rocking bed and ‘pneumobelt’ displace abdominal contents to
aid diaphragmatic contraction. Used extensively in the polio epidemics of
the 1950s; now only rarely used to manage chronic respiratory failure.
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) supplies constant
positive pressure during inspiration and expiration, and is therefore not
a form of ventilation. It provides a ‘splint’ to open the upper airway and
collapsed alveoli (thus improving V/Q matching). CPAP is used extensively
in the community to treat obstructive sleep apnoea, but also has a role in
improving oxygenation in selected patients with acute respiratory failure,
e.g. patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, pneumocystis pneumonia (p 476).

CHAPTER 57

Non-invasive ventilation

Indications
NIV may be used in an attempt to avoid invasive ventilation and its complications (e.g. upper airway trauma, ventilator-acquired pneumonia); alternatively, NIV may represent the ‘ceiling’ of treatment in patients deemed
unsuitable for intubation. NIV is not an alternative to invasive ventilation in
patients who require this deﬁnitive treatment.

Acute exacerbation of COPD
• Consider NIV in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD who
have a respiratory acidosis (pH <7.30) despite initial medical treatment
and controlled oxygen therapy
• Beneﬁts include reduced mortality and need for intubation, more rapid
improvement in physiological outcomes (respiratory rate, pH), and
symptomatic relief from breathlessness, when compared with standard
medical treatment
• NIV only assists ventilation; the pressures used are not enough to take
over ventilation due to the high airways resistance
• Invasive ventilation, if deemed appropriate, should be considered particularly in patients with a severe respiratory acidosis (pH <7.25), as
this is associated with treatment failure and increased mortality with
NIV
• High expiratory pressures (e.g. 6–8 cmH2O, PEEP) may help reduce
the work of breathing by offsetting intrinsic PEEP, but will lessen the
IPAP–EPAP difference, thus reducing the ventilation component.

Acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema
• Use of CPAP via face mask is effective and should be considered in
patients who fail to improve with medical management alone
• Bi-level NIV has not been shown to be superior to CPAP and there is a
suggestion of increased myocardial infarction rates following its use. It
may, however, have a role in patients who do not respond to CPAP.

Decompensated obstructive sleep apnoea
NIV is effective in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea and the
overlap syndrome (i.e. raised PaCO2, typically with associated obesity
hypoventilation or COPD, p 582 ) when CPAP alone fails to reverse the
CO2 retention. NIV is generally recommended as the ﬁrst choice over
CPAP when an acute respiratory acidosis is present, but conversion to
CPAP later may be possible.

Respiratory failure from neuromuscular weakness
• NIV is the treatment of choice for ventilatory failure resulting from
neuromuscular weakness or chest wall deformity
• The pressures used may be adequate to fully take over ventilation,
because the chest and lung compliance are often little impaired

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Immunocompromised patients
• Immunocompromised patients who develop acute respiratory failure
have an extremely high mortality following endotracheal intubation and
ventilation
• In immunocompromised patients with pulmonary inﬁltrates, fever, and
hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure, intermittent NIV results in lower intubation rates and hospital mortality when compared with standard treatment
• CPAP is effective in the treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia.

Community-acquired pneumonia
• Use of NIV may result in a reduction in need for intubation compared
with standard medical treatment, although no signiﬁcant differences in
hospital mortality or length of hospitalization have been shown
• CPAP may have a role in improving oxygenation in severe pneumonia
• In patients who would potentially be candidates for intubation, use of
NIV or CPAP should not inappropriately delay invasive ventilation, and
so should only be attempted in an ITU setting.

Other conditions
• There is no evidence to support the use of NIV in acute severe asthma
• There is no strong evidence to support the use of NIV in exacerbations
of bronchiectasis and cystic ﬁbrosis, although NIV may be useful as a
‘ceiling’ of treatment in patients with severe underlying disease who
would not be considered suitable candidates for invasive ventilation
• Bi-level NIV or CPAP may have a role in improving gas exchange
following trauma or surgery.

Contraindications
Relative contraindications to the use of NIV are listed below. They should
be considered in the context of individual patients; for example, severe
hypoxaemia may not be considered a contraindication for NIV in a patient
who is unsuitable for invasive ventilation.

CHAPTER 57

Non-invasive ventilation

NIV in acute respiratory failure:
practical use
The decision to start NIV should follow a period of initial standard medical
treatment including appropriate supplementary and controlled oxygen
therapy; a proportion of patients will improve and will no longer require
ventilation. Prior to commencing NIV a senior doctor should make a decision with the patient and their family regarding suitability for invasive ventilation should NIV fail and document this clearly in the medical notes.
If the patient is a candidate for invasive ventilation, care must be taken to
avoid inappropriate delays in intubation through the use of NIV or CPAP.
Liaise with ITU staff early.

Setting up NIV
1. Select an appropriate mask type and size for the patient. Masks may
be nasal or oronasal (full face). Nasal masks require clear nasal passages and may allow mouth leaks, particularly in the acutely breathless
patient, but they are more comfortable. Full-face masks avoid mouth
leakage and are generally favoured for initial use in acute respiratory
failure.
2. Allow the patient to hold the mask to their face prior to attaching
the head straps—this may increase conﬁdence and compliance. Mask
adjustments are often necessary to minimize air leaks, although some
leakage may have to be accepted. Avoid excessive strap tension; 1 or
2 ﬁngers should be able to ﬁt under the strap.
3. Set up the ventilator. Typical initial pressures for ventilating a patient
with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) would be EPAP 4 cmH2O and
IPAP 12 cmH2O, with a back-up rate of 15/min and inspiratory: expiratory ratio of 1:3 in spontaneous/timed mode. Increase the IPAP in increments of 2 cmH2O to a maximum of 20, as tolerated by the patient.
Similar settings can be used for patients with hypercapnic respiratory
failure resulting from neuromuscular weakness. Consider increasing the
EPAP (e.g. to 8 or 10 cm) in obese patients with an ‘overlap’ syndrome
of COPD and obstructive sleep apnoea.
Pressure support ventilators can also be set to provide CPAP by
equalizing the IPAP and EPAP; typical pressures range from 5 to 12.5
cmH2O. CPAP may improve oxygenation in selected patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema or pneumonia.
4. Supplementary oxygen concentration (FiO2) should be guided by the
underlying disease process and by oximetry monitoring. For many
hypercapnic patients with COPD, maintenance of oxygen saturations
between 88% and 92% effectively balances the risks of hypoxia and
hypercapnic respiratory acidosis.
5. Patient monitoring should involve assessment of comfort, respiratory
rate, synchrony with the ventilator, mask leaks, pulse rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturations.
6. Arterial or capillary blood gas analysis should be performed after 1 h
and again after 4 h if there has been no improvement. Improvement in
acidosis, and decline in respiratory rate after 1 and 4 h of treatment are

NIV IN ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE: PRACTICAL USE

associated with a better outcome. Repeat the blood gas analysis if the
clinical condition changes.
7. Lack of response may be indicated by a worsening acidosis or persistently abnormal arterial blood gases, or by a reduced conscious level
and clinical deterioration. Consider invasive ventilation, if appropriate.
The decision to halt NIV depends on the circumstances of the individual
patient, and should be made by a senior doctor.
8. Subsequent management depends on the patient’s response. Optimal
duration of NIV is unclear, but it is typically administered for up to
3 days in acute respiratory failure. NIV does not need to be continuous,
and the patient may have breaks for meals and nebulizers.

CHAPTER 57

Non-invasive ventilation

NIV in chronic respiratory failure
Chest wall deformity and neuromuscular weakness (p 582)
• NIV has a well-established role in the management of chronic respiratory failure due to chest wall deformity or neuromuscular weakness,
and has been shown to improve symptoms, gas exchange, and mortality
• Common underlying diagnoses include chest wall deformity and kyphoscoliosis, post-polio syndrome, motor neurone disease, spinal cord
injury, neuropathies, myopathies, and muscular dystrophies. The nature
of the underlying disease must inﬂuence the appropriateness of initiating ventilation: progressive conditions such as motor neurone disease
often result in increasing dependence on the ventilator, and the patient
and their care-givers should be made aware of this
• NIV is administered at home overnight and this improves daytime
gas exchange. The mechanism for this is unclear: it probably resets
the central respiratory drive, although respiratory muscle rest and
improved chest wall and lung compliance may also play a part
• Small portable positive pressure ventilators with either face or nasal
masks are used in the majority of cases; negative pressure or abdominal
ventilators may rarely have a role in patients who are intolerant of
masks, although their use may be limited by upper airways obstruction
• The decision to introduce overnight NIV is difﬁcult, and is based on
both symptoms (morning headaches, hypersomnolence, fatigue, poor
sleep quality) and evidence of ventilatory failure (daytime hypercapnia
(pCO2 >6.0 kPa) and/or nocturnal hypoventilation with O2 saturations
<88% on overnight oximetry). Daytime ventilatory failure, however, is
often a late feature, and is typically preceded by hypercapnic hypoventilation during sleep.
• A recent study in patients with myopathies demonstrated supine
inspiratory vital capacity to be an accurate predictor of respiratory
reserve: supine IVC <40% of predicted was signiﬁcantly associated with
hypercapnic hypoventilation and such patients should be considered
for treatment with NIV. Supine IVC <20% was typically associated
with daytime respiratory failure, whereas supine IVC >60% indicated a
minimal risk of respiratory complications. Other factors include signs of
cor pulmonale or hospital admission with respiratory failure
• Patients with excessive secretions may not be suitable for non-invasive
ventilation, although face mask ventilation is possible even in the setting
of bulbar weakness
• Regular follow-up of patients on overnight ventilation is important.
Ask about symptoms and compliance, and repeat arterial or capillary
blood gas analysis. Lack of improvement in gas exchange may reﬂect
non-compliance, excessive air leakage, inadequate pressure support, or
progression of underlying disease; consider repeating nocturnal oximetry monitoring. Patients with persisting severe hypoxia may beneﬁt
from long-term supplementary oxygen, although this may worsen CO2
retention.

NIV IN CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Sleep apnoea (p 574)
Overnight NIV may have a role in patients with central hypoventilation,
Cheyne–Stokes respiration, obesity hypoventilation, overlap syndromes of
obstructive sleep apnoea with coexisting COPD or obesity.

Cystic ﬁbrosis (p 218)
Overnight NIV may have a useful role as a ‘bridge’ to transplantation in
patients with cystic ﬁbrosis and chronic respiratory failure.

COPD (p 179)
Use of NIV in the management of chronic stable COPD is controversial.
Trials have shown conﬂicting results, although some possible beneﬁt in a
subgroup of patients with severe hypercapnia, extra nocturnal hypoventilation, and recurrent admissions for worsening ventilatory failure.

CHAPTER 58

Oxygen therapy

Acute oxygen therapy
Acute oxygen therapy is either ‘controlled’ or ‘uncontrolled’.
• Uncontrolled Use when extra O2 is required to raise the SaO2 above
92%, to ensure adequate O2 delivery to the tissues and where there
are no concerns that high PaO2 values will depress ventilatory drive to
the point that PaCO2 will rise, and pH fall, dangerously, e.g. pneumonia,
pneumothorax, pulmonary emboli, asthma, LVF, etc.
• Controlled Use when extra O2 is required, but ventilation critically
depends on hypoxic drive, e.g. exacerbations of COPD (particularly
when there has been a chronically raised PaCO2, as evidenced by a
signiﬁcant base excess), chronic ventilatory failure due to scoliosis,
neuromuscular disease, and any other cause of ‘pump’ failure.
• With stable type II ventilatory failure, ventilation still seems to be dominantly driven by PaCO2/pH, but in exacerbations (when PaO2 usually
falls), peripheral chemoreceptor drive from low PaO2 becomes dominant. Thus, O2 therapy must not raise PaO2 above 8 kPa (~92% SaO2)
as this will ‘turn off’ ventilatory drive, allowing hypoventilation, hypercapnia, acidosis, and potentially death. There is some evidence that high
alveolar PO2 also ‘turns off’ pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction. This
allows an increase in pulmonary blood ﬂow to poorly ventilated areas
and reducing CO2 excretion (accounts for ≈ 20% of the PaCO2 rise following excessive FiO2 in COPD exacerbations).
Delivering uncontrolled oxygen This can be done in many ways, essentially
by blowing O2 over the face, whilst limiting inhalation of surrounding air
or exhaled CO2.
• Standard O2 masks (sometimes called high-ﬂow masks). Set the O2
regulator to at least 4 L/min, much more if very breathless, to prevent
dilution by air drawn into mask by high inspiratory ﬂows via exit holes.
Can deliver about 50–60% O2.
• Nasal cannulae/prongs/catheters are uncontrolled and deliver unpredictable levels of O2 (depending on ﬂow rate, minute ventilation, and oral vs.
nasal breathing route). Titrate using an oxygen saturation monitor.
• Non-rebreathe reservoir masks can deliver FiO2 values over 60% by
means of a soft plastic bag between the end of the tubing and mask,
plus one-way valves between the bag and mask and on the mask exit
ports. This mechanism ensures that most of the inspired air is pure
O2. The ability of the reservoir to empty on inspiration brieﬂy allows
higher inspiratory ﬂows than the actual O2 regulator setting, and the
bag valve prevents inhalation of very much exhaled CO2; the mask exit
valves close, preventing air inhalation. The usual problem is kinking of
the junction between the mask and bag when the head tilts forward,
reducing the effectiveness of the reservoir.
• Very high FiO2 requires a tight seal, and is generally delivered with
CPAP masks (using pressures of about 5–7 cmH2O). This ensures no air
is entrained through blow off vents or leaks, as well as improving V/Q
matching by recruiting collapsed alveoli.
Delivering controlled oxygen therapy This requires the ability to reliably
control the FiO2 in order to keep the patient’s SaO2 less than 92% (some
suggest 90%), but high enough to prevent anaerobic metabolism. This lower

ACUTE OXYGEN THERAPY

acceptable level is debatable: 88% is generous, 85% is likely to be adequate,
and 80% may be acceptable if cardiac output is adequate.
• FiO2 is controlled through Venturi masks—O2 is directed through a
narrow nozzle and exits at speed, lowering the air pressure at this
point. This draws in surrounding air, diluting the O2
• A proper Venturi mask mixes O2 and air in the same proportion,
regardless of the oxygen ﬂow
• The minimum ﬂow setting of the regulator, written on the nozzle,
ensures adequate overall ﬂow to prevent air being drawn through the
exit holes during inhalation, e.g. a 28% Ventimask has a 1:10 entrainment
ratio, 1 L/min O2 entrains 10 L/min air (total ﬂow 11 L/min), 2 L/min O2
entrains 20 L/min (total ﬂow 22 L/min)
• Nasal cannulae are deﬁnitely not controlled O2 therapy and are in fact
the opposite. If nasal cannulae do deliver too high an FiO2, and ventilation decreases as a consequence, the proportion of the minute ventilation containing the ﬁxed ﬂow nasal oxygen will rise, increasing the FiO2
and hence PaO2 still further—a vicious cycle
• Controlled and very low ﬂow oxygen is also needed sometimes with
NIV when the patient is still required to trigger inspiration. Added O2
should be avoided if possible and rarely requires more than 1 L/min to
be entrained; again it should be titrated using the SaO2. When adding
too much oxygen, it is easy to be lulled into a false sense of security by
an SaO2 over 92%, while the PaCO2 gradually rises undetected.

Oxygen alert card should be given to all patients with a previous
episode of hypercapnic respiratory failure. This alerts ambulance crews
and medical staff to the potential risk of hypercapnia with high-ﬂow oxygen
and documents usual resting baseline SaO2. However, the ambulance staff
protocols are sufﬁciently rigid that they are not allowed to override them.
In some areas, letters from the patient’s consultant and head of the ambulance service must be with the patient.

Introduction
If you have a sudden worsening of your lung
disease (usually due to a chest infection) it is
essential that you do not receive too much or
too little oxygen, either can be dangerous.
Too much oxygen can cause a rise in the level
of carbon dioxide in your blood and this can
make you drowsy and slow your breathing.
Too little oxygen can also be dangerous.
Purpose of this card
The purpose of this oxygen alert card is to
make sure that the doctors or ambulance staff
involved in your care are made aware of your
special needs regarding oxygen therapy. The
card recommends the appropriate amount of
oxygen therapy for you based on your
previous blood gas tests.

Carry the card with you at all times
If you need to call the ambulance service
or attend the hospital accident and
emergency department, show this card
to the GP, paramedics, doctor or
emergency department staff looking
after you, as it provides them with
essential information regarding your
personal oxygen needs.

CHAPTER 58

Oxygen therapy

Home oxygen therapy
Home oxygen is delivered with essentially three different aims. First, to
reduce the long-term complications of chronic hypoxia such as cor pulmonale, usually called long-term oxygen therapy or LTOT. This requires ≥15 h
a day to be successful. Home oxygen can also be supplied for the relief
of breathlessness, usually called ‘short’ burst oxygen therapy or SBOT.
If SBOT is used for many hours a day, it is sometimes incorrectly called
LTOT, particularly by the oxygen supply companies. Oxygen can also be
supplied to ambulant patients so that they can leave the house and travel
(ambulatory oxygen).

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT)
Background and indications
Two landmark trials of LTOT in the 1980s: the British MRC Working Party
trial and the American Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (NOTT).
The MRC trial compared COPD patients receiving oxygen for 15 h/day
with controls receiving no oxygen. The NOTT trial compared continuous
daily oxygen (average 17.7 h/day) with overnight oxygen (average 12 h). The
patients in the MRC trial were on average hypercapnic (mean PaCO2 7.3
kPa), whereas those in the NOTT trial were on average normocapnic
(mean PaCO2 5.7 kPa). The main outcome in both trials was improved
survival in those patients receiving oxygen for at least 15 h/day, though
this improved survival was not seen in the MRC trial until after a year of
oxygen therapy.
The NOTT trial showed a reduced exercise pulmonary artery pressure
(PAP) after 6 months of continuous or nocturnal oxygen therapy. The 8-year
survival was related to the fall in mean PAP during the ﬁrst 6 months of
continuous oxygen use.
The MRC trial failed to show a fall in mean PAP with LTOT, but the mean
annual increase in PAP (3 mmHg) in patients in the control arm was not
seen in the oxygen treated group.
The reason for the improved survival with LTOT is not clear, and is
unlikely to relate to the small changes in pulmonary haemodynamics seen.
COPD is the disease for which LTOT is most commonly prescribed,
and the disease in which the original studies were completed. Subsequent
oxygen studies have shown improved exercise endurance in COPD
patients breathing supplemental oxygen, with improved walking distance
and ability to perform daily activities. FEV1 is the strongest predictor of
survival in COPD; LTOT does not inﬂuence the decline in FEV1.
Additional beneﬁts of LTOT include:
• Reduction of secondary polycythaemia
• Improved sleep quality, by reducing hypoxia-associated brain arousals
• Reduced cardiac arrthymias, and potentially reducing the risk of nocturnal sudden death
• Reduced sympathetic outﬂow leading to improved renal function, with
increased salt and water excretion, and reduced peripheral oedema

HOME OXYGEN THERAPY

Indications for LTOT in COPD patients
Criteria for prescription of LTOT in the UK are based on the clinical
parameters of patients showing improved survival in the two LTOT trials.
• PaO2 <7.3 kPa (55 mmHg) breathing air (i.e. a saturation on air ≤88%),
in a stable clinical state. Borderline results may need reassessment after
3 months, particularly if oximetry SaO2 <92%
• PaO2 7.3–8 kPa (56–59 mmHg, SaO2 89–90%) if pulmonary hypertension (i.e. symptoms and signs of cor pulmonale), polycythaemia, or additional nocturnal hypoxaemia (SaO2 ≤90% for at least 30% of the night).
There is no evidence that treating solely nocturnal hypoxaemia leads to
improved survival
• Clinical stability is the absence of an exacerbation for the previous
4 weeks. This is usually assessed twice, several weeks apart, to ensure
stability and ideally at least 6 weeks following an exacerbation
• LTOT is usually prescribed for those with FEV1 <1.5 L or <40% predicted. If the FEV1 is higher in the presence of hypoxia/hypercapnia, it
suggests an additional cause for the ventilatory failure, such as additional obstructive sleep apnoea; further investigations may be indicated
• Medical management of the disease must be optimized prior to the
prescription of LTOT
• PaCO2 does not inﬂuence the prescription of LTOT for COPD. There is
a small risk of precipitating worsening hypercapnia with LTOT in those
who are already hypercapnic, particularly if the patient has OSA or is
experiencing an exacerbation
• Blood gases should be checked on LTOT to ensure the absence of
worsening hypercapnia, if symptoms such as headache and confusion
suggest that this has occurred, and to ensure a satisfactory increase in
PaO2. Aim for PaO2 values of 8–9 kPa (60–65 mmHg, SaO2 90–92%)
• Patients should have stopped smoking: the beneﬁt of LTOT in
continued smokers is limited, and there is an increased risk of ﬁre.
However, most studies suggest that around 18% of patients on LTOT
continue to smoke; they should be warned of the risks.
Indications for LTOT in non-COPD patients
There is very limited evidence to support the use of true LTOT in these
patient groups and no data showing improved survival; the prescription
thresholds are therefore not evidence-based. Ensure optimal medical management ﬁrst. LTOT is a term best reserved when one is trying to ward off
complications of hypoxia, but is often confused with prolonged use of oxygen
for palliative purposes; even guidelines confuse the two. Consider in:
• Interstitial lung disease if PaO2 <8 kPa (SaO2 90%)
• Cystic ﬁbrosis if PaO2 <8 kPa (SaO2 90%)
• Pulmonary hypertension with PaO2 <8 kPa, in the absence of parenchymal lung disease
• Neuromuscular or skeletal disorders causing ventilatory failure.
Consider either oxygen alone (very rarely appropriate), or in combination with NIV (usually via a specialist centre)
• Chronic heart failure if PaO2 <7.5 kPa.
Guidelines also include the following, but this is not really LTOT, but prolonged SBOT.
• Palliative care—for the dyspnoea of lung malignancy, or other causes of
disabling dyspnoea due to terminal disease.

CHAPTER 58

Oxygen therapy

Indications for SBOT
• Short-burst oxygen therapy usually refers to intermittent supplemental
oxygen to relieve dyspnoea, for periods of 10–20 min, but the periods
may become much longer. Often the resting PaO2/SaO2 may be normal.
Some would argue there is a large placebo effect due to the cooling
effect of the oxygen on the face; a similar effect may be achieved by
using a fan. Traditionally used in the following situations, although very
little data exist to support its use in COPD, interstitial lung disease,
heart failure, etc.:
• Pre-oxygenation before exercise
• Recovery from exercise
• SOB at rest
• Palliative care
• Overnight to reduce sleep disruption of Cheyne–Stokes breathing in
heart failure.
Should only be prescribed if clear proven beneﬁt, preferably with objective
improvement in hypoxia and symptoms. It is expensive to prescribe, based
on a daily rate and hours prescribed, irrespective of actual usage. It is best
provided by using one or more oxygen cylinders placed strategically round
the house. Use of an O2 concentrator becomes more economical above
a certain h/day usage. To supply a cylinder to stay in the wardrobe ‘just in
case’ is now a very expensive placebo.

Indications for ambulatory oxygen
Ambulatory oxygen is oxygen delivered by portable equipment, and may
be suitable for:
• Patients on LTOT who are mobile
• Those with exercise desaturation, and who show an improvement in
exercise capacity or dyspnoea with oxygen; titrate oxygen to limit the
exercise desaturation, aiming for SaO2 >90%.
This indication is poorly researched and deﬁned. Ideally clear beneﬁt
should be demonstrated, and guidelines recommend laborious assessment, but facilities to do this often do not exist. It is up to the specialist
prescriber to decide whether to order through the oxygen supply
company, and then up to the supply company to decide on the best way to
deliver. A 2-month assessment is usually required, to determine the likely
number of hours of use. A reasonable initial prescription might be for 1–
2 h/day. Ideally usage should be regularly reviewed and withdrawn if of
no beneﬁt, or not being used. It is usually provided via portable cylinders,
although liquid oxygen is a more convenient option, providing 6 h use per
recharge.

CHAPTER 58

Oxygen therapy

Practical issues
• Home O2 should not be supplied to patients who still smoke, due to
added ﬁre risk, and probable reduced efﬁcacy by the increased HbCO
• LTOT is best provided by an oxygen concentrator, set at 1–4 L/min
depending on PaO2 or SaO2. Some concentrators can deliver 8 L/min.
Concentrators contain a molecular sieve containing zeolite, which
traps gas molecules depending on size and polarity. Can produce up to
96% oxygen, depending on ﬂow (the argon is also concentrated, to 4%)
• Patients can use nasal prongs or a ﬁxed concentration mask (uncontrolled or controlled oxygen, e.g. 24% and 28%) depending on physiological requirements and their preference. A back-up cylinder should
be prescribed in case of power cuts
• Oxygen humidiﬁcation is possible, but difﬁcult to arrange and rarely
necessary. Only works well above 4 L/min, and tube lengths <1.5 m
• LTOT should be used for ≥15 h/day in patients with COPD, although
survival improves when used for longer; therefore use should not be
restricted to 15 h/day
• Patient education in the use of LTOT and machine maintenance are
important. Specialist respiratory nurses may be involved with this
• If using SBOT at >3 oxygen cylinders/week, an oxygen concentrator is
more economical (the oxygen supply company decides on this).

How to organize home oxygen
• The UK-wide integrated oxygen service (2005) ensured that provision
of all modalities of domiciliary O2 is from one contractor in each area.
Prescription should, in theory, come from respiratory specialists only
(doctors, specialist nurses). Local arrangements are deﬁned by primary
case trusts (PCTs); in some areas almost anyone is deﬁned as a ‘respiratory specialist’, able to prescribe O2, with consequential escalation of
O2 costs
• The prescriber completes and signs a Home Oxygen Order Form
(HOOF), providing the oxygen supplier with the patient’s details and an
exact prescription of the oxygen required
• The HOOF is used for the prescription of LTOT, short burst, and
ambulatory oxygen; includes details of the oxygen ﬂow rate, % oxygen,
and delivery device/mask required
• The oxygen supplier will invoice the PCT (Local Health Board in
Wales); it is vital that this information is completed otherwise the
HOOF will be returned
• A Home Oxygen Consent Form (HOCF) form must be signed by the
patient, consenting for the disclosure of relevant medical information,
address, telephone number to the oxygen supplier and ﬁre brigade
• The HOOF and HOCF are faxed to the oxygen supplier, with copies to
the PCT, GP, and clinical lead for home oxygen services
• An LTOT prescription does not automatically include provision for
oxygen outside the home; a separate form must be completed
• The response time for the delivery of LTOT, short-burst oxygen, and
standard ambulatory supply is 3 days.

Follow-up is needed to ensure:
• Compliance; withdraw if not using despite support and explanation.
Home visit within 4 weeks by specialist nurse recommended

PRACTICAL ISSUES

• Conﬁrm the ongoing requirement for LTOT. Some patients improve
and no longer need LTOT. Arterial blood gas tensions at 3 months, and
then yearly monitoring (may be performed by specialist nurses)
• Cancellation with the O2 company as soon as a patients dies
• Inform O2 company of any changes in ﬂow rates/%O2
• Inform O2 company of any changes in patient address etc.
• Inform O2 company of admission to hospital for more than a week
(reduces cost).

Emergency supply is a separate category and should only be prescribed when the patient has no O2 at home. The supplier is required to
deliver this within 4 h of receipt of the order. It should not be ordered for
more than 3 days.

Portable oxygen options
• DD—460 L. Lightweight and easily portable. Lasts 3 h 50 min at
2 L/min
• F size—1360 L. Lasts approximately 11.5 h at 2 L/min
• PD—300 L. Much smaller, but heavier than DD. Lasts 2.5 h at 2 L/min
• E size—600 L. Lightweight and portable. Lasts 5 h at 2 L/min. (Not
available on the NHS.)
• Liquid oxygen
• Use O2 conserver devices (reduce O2 wastage during expiration).

CHAPTER 59

Palliative care

Palliative care is deﬁned by the World Health Organization as an approach
that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the
problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention
and relief of suffering by means of early identiﬁcation, impeccable assessment, and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial
and spiritual. Palliative care is moving away from being involved just at the
end of life, especially in developing countries when curative possibilities
are less readily available and palliative treatments may be the only option.
In the UK, patients may be under palliative care teams intermittently for
symptom control, respite care, etc., and may not see the service again for
months or years.
Within chest medicine, palliative care is most commonly considered
for patients with lung cancer and mesothelioma; many other patients with
progressive end-stage respiratory disease (such as COPD, CF, and ﬁbrotic
lung disease) also beneﬁt from speciﬁc palliative interventions. These two
areas are discussed separately below, although there is much overlap in
the management.

Lung cancer and mesothelioma
•
•
•
•

Involve the specialist palliative care team early
Treat symptoms promptly
Recognize problems are often mixed, complex and multiple
Recognize that delirium, dyspnoea, and decreased mobility often herald
the terminal phase of cancer.

Pain
• Aim to determine cause, type, and site
• Start with simple analgesia and increase according to the WHO analgesic ladder, moving from non-opioid analgesia through weak opioids to
strong opioids. Reassess repeatedly and regularly
• If moving to morphine from weak opioid, 5–10 mg should be adequate.
10–20 mg or more required to replace a strong opioid (60 mg codeine
qds is equivalent to 5 mg morphine 4-hourly. If pain was not previously
controlled, start at 10 mg morphine 4-hourly). If ﬁrst dose of morphine
no more effective than previous analgesia, increase next dose by 50%
• Prescribe analgesia as required for breakthrough pain (see box)
• Give drugs a chance to work at appropriate doses, particularly if they
have not had strong opioids before. Allows assessment of analgesic
effect and side-effects. Usually increase every 3rd day if required
• Once pain is reasonably controlled, morphine dose can be converted
to slow release morphine by dividing total amount by two and giving
that dose as modiﬁed release morphine 12-hourly. The breakthrough
dose is one-sixth of the total 24-h dose (e.g. 15 mg slow release
morphine bd, then 5 mg (immediate release morphine sulphate) for
breakthrough pain)

LUNG CANCER AND MESOTHELIOMA

• Treat drug side-effects, e.g. constipation, nausea. Prescribe prophylactic
laxatives with morphine. Warn people they may feel more drowsy
if starting morphine or having dose increase, but this usually settles
within a few days
• Patients with renal failure are more likely to develop opioid toxicity
(drowsiness, confusion, myoclonus) as they have difﬁculty excreting
morphine metabolites. They may need alternatives to morphine (e.g.
methadone, alfentanil, fentanyl) if their pain is not controlled on lowdose morphine
• The addition of an anti-inﬂammatory drug can be effective for bone
pain and for liver capsule pain if there are hepatic metastases
• Consider radiotherapy for localized pain in the chest related to cancer
• Pleuritic pain Consider PE, treat any infection. Consider non-steroidal
anti-inﬂammatory drug ± intercostal nerve block
• Bone metastases causing local tenderness Start a strong opioid. If there is
no improvement after 3 dose increases, add a non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug for a 1-week trial. If single site, consider
radiotherapy or intercostal nerve block. If multiple sites, consider
bisphosphonates (so long as not hypocalcaemic), e.g. 90 mg of
pamidronate IV every 4 weeks.
• Neuropathic pain can be treated with speciﬁc antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline 10–50 mg) or anticonvulsants (e.g. carbamazepine or sodium
valproate 200 mg/day, gabapentin)
• Consider referral to pain clinic or specialist centre for further intervention, such as a intercostal nerve block, transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation (TENS), cervical cordotomy, or complementary therapies.

Treatment of breakthrough pain
• If already on non-opioid analgesic: give one extra dose of the regular
analgesic
• If already on a regular oral opioid: give 4-hourly oral dose (= one sixth
of total 24 hour dose), e.g. 60 mg/day = 10 mg dose
• If on transdermal opioid patch: Fentanyl—give 1-hourly dose e.g.
25 µg/h patch, give 25 µg SC or sublingually. Buprenorphine—give
6-hourly dose, e.g. 35 µg/h patch = 200 µg SC or sublingually
• If already on continuous SC infusion of opioid: Diamorphine—give
4-hourly dose, e.g. 30 mg/24 h = 5 mg dose SC. Fentanyl—give
1-hourly dose, e.g. 500 µg/24 h = 20 µg dose SC
Consider increasing regular analgesic dose if the breakthrough pain
occurs before the next regular dose. If there is no response to the additional breakthrough pain treatment, repeat after 4 h if non-opioid or
1 h if opioid, with same dose. If still no response, consider changing from
non-opioid to weak opioid, or weak opioid to strong opioid.

715

716

CHAPTER 59

Palliative care

Conversions between opiates
More potent opioids or routes do not provide greater analgesic efﬁcacy,
but may provide an alternative route to ensure adequate absorption, or
if patient experiencing side-effects (usually toxicity and confusion)
• Oral morphine to subcutaneous morphine Conversion factor is ÷ 2, e.g.
60 mg/24 h oral morphine = 30 mg SC morphine
• Oral morphine to diamorphine infusion Conversion factor is ÷ 3, e.g.
60 mg/24 h oral morphine = 20 mg/24 h SC diamorphine
• Oral morphine to transdermal fentanyl (patch) Oral morphine in
mg/24 h÷ 3 = transdermal fentanyl in µg/h, e.g. 75 mg oral morphine
in 24 h = 25 µg/h transdermal fentanyl. Use transdermal fentanyl for
patients with stable pain.

Dyspnoea
• Consider possible causes (see box opposite). Dyspnoea may be due to
the underlying lung disease, or due to an additional pathology
• Dyspnoea is frightening and made worse by anxiety and panic
• Lung cancer and pulmonary metastases are associated with the sensation of shortness of breath, often due to stimulation of receptors by
malignant inﬁltration or lymphangitis carcinomatosis
• Optimize treatment of any underlying lung disease with bronchodilators and steroids if appropriate
• Treat concurrent chest infection
• Opioids (e.g. 2.5–5 mg morphine sulphate solution 4-hourly) relieve the
sensation of dyspnoea without affecting respiratory function
• Oxygen cylinders for intermittent short burst/prn use may help
symptoms
• Fan blowing cool air onto the face can be helpful
• Consider the need for tumour debulking by bronchoscopy or an airway
stent in a patient with lung cancer experiencing dyspnoea due to bronchial obstruction or compression with tumour
• If PE diagnosed, consider treatment with low molecular weight heparin
as warfarin can cause INR to be variable and difﬁcult to optimize
• Subcutaneous opiate infusion may relieve symptoms as death
approaches; use with haloperidol, midazolam or levomepromazine.

LUNG CANCER AND MESOTHELIOMA

Causes of breathlessness in patients with lung cancer
• Pneumonia
• Underlying chronic lung disease (e.g. COPD, UIP) or concomitant
cardiac disease
• Lobar collapse
• Pleural effusion
• Pneumothorax
• SVCO
• Upper airway obstruction
• Pulmonary emboli
• Lymphangitis carcinomatosis
• Chest wall inﬁltration
• Phrenic nerve paralysis
• Pericardial effusion
• Respiratory muscle weakness, due to cachexia, paraneoplastic
syndromes, steroid myopathy
• Anaemia
• Depression
• Anxiety and panic.

717

718

CHAPTER 59

Palliative care

Other symptoms
Anxiety
• Leads to dyspnoea, which in turn worsens anxiety
• Explain they will not suffocate, symptoms will pass
• Benzodiazepines (such as short-acting lorazepam 0.5–1 mg sublingually
8–12-hourly) are effective for respiratory panic.
• Acute panic may be helped by midazolam 2.5 mg IV, increased in increments of 1 mg, given in a controlled environment with oxygen
• Amitryptilline or citalopram may be effective longer-term treatments
• Relaxation exercises, diaphragmatic breathing training, and complementary therapies may help some patients.

Cough
Treat the underlying cause
Try simple or codeine linctus
Nebulized saline may help expectoration
Methadone linctus 1–2 mg nocte or bd may be of beneﬁt
Nebulized local anaesthetic may help, e.g. 5 mL 2% lidocaine 6-hourly
or bupivacaine 5 mL 0.25% 6-hourly (avoid in asthmatics, as it causes
bronchospasm). Pharyngeal numbness is likely to occur, so avoid ﬂuids
for 1–2 h afterwards.
• Consider radiotherapy if haemoptysis due to lung cancer. Consider
discontinuing antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants
• If massive haemoptysis, consider tranexamic acid, plus emergency
supply of opioids and benzodiazepines to ensure pain control and
reduction of fear by decreasing awareness.
•
•
•
•
•

Pleural effusion
• Drain if symptomatic and pleurodese early if recurrent, although not if
prognosis is poor (less than 3 months)
• Consider in-dwelling tunnelled catheter to drain ﬂuid if effusion is
symptomatic and pleurodesis has failed due to trapped lung.

Poor appetite
• Common symptom; may be primary due to cachexia–anorexia syndrome, or secondary due to mouth problems such as candidiasis,
nausea, hypercalcaemia, drugs, or depression
• May be improved in the short term (about 6 weeks) by a course of oral
steroids, such as prednisolone 20 mg daily
• Cachexia leads to decreased respiratory muscle strength and increased
shortness of breath
• Consider nutritional supplements.

Brain metastases
• Steroids relieve the cerebral oedema associated with brain metastases,
e.g. dexamethasone 4 mg bd–qds initially and then decrease
• Avoid steroid dosing in the evening, as sleep is affected
• Cranial radiotherapy may be considered if there is a good response to
steroids.

CHAPTER 59

Palliative care

Non-malignant respiratory disease
(COPD, CF, ﬁbrotic lung disease)
The main problems associated with severe non-malignant respiratory disease
are dyspnoea, hypoxia, immobility, and psychosocial problems, including
depression. End-stage COPD patients may have very frequent exacerbations for some years before a ﬁnal terminal event. One study has shown
those with end-stage COPD are more likely to have depression ± anxiety
than those with terminal cancer, but they are less likely to receive speciﬁc
treatment for their emotional problems or any targeted palliative care. It
may be appropriate therefore to shift the focus in patients with severe
end-stage respiratory disease away from management of acute exacerbations towards a more palliative approach to care.

Dyspnoea
• Dyspnoea is frightening and made worse by anxiety and panic
• Patients may decrease their mobility to avoid dyspnoea, and subsequently become more deconditioned.
• Dyspnoea may be due to the underlying lung disease or an additional
pathology (PE, infection, pneumothorax, cardiac failure)
• Sitting upright reduces airway obstruction and optimizes ventilation.
Relaxing and dropping the shoulders can improve ventilation, when
anxiety has caused patient to ‘hunch up’
• Calm gentle reassurance can decrease anxiety and reduce dyspnoea
• Fan blowing cool air onto the face can be helpful
• Optimize treatment of any underlying lung disease with bronchodilators and inhaled steroids
• Treat concurrent exacerbations with antibiotics and oral steroids
• Stop smoking
• Consider pulmonary rehabilitation, if appropriate
• Opioids (e.g. 2.5–5 mg morphine sulphate solution 4-hourly) relieve the
sensation of dyspnoea without affecting respiratory function
• Oxygen cylinders for intermittent short burst use may help symptoms.
Consider concentrator if multiple cylinders being used

Hypoxia
• SaO2 <92%
• LTOT may be appropriate (see p 706)
• Oxygen cylinders for intermittent or ambulatory use may help symptoms, but little data to support their use.

Anxiety and depression
May be due to fear and uncertainty over prognosis
Lead to dyspnoea, which in turn worsens anxiety
Explain they will not suffocate; symptoms will pass
Benzodiazepines (such as short-acting lorazepam 0.5–1 mg sublingually
8–12-hourly) are effective for respiratory panic
• Acute panic may be helped by midazolam 2.5 mg IV, increased in steps
of 1 mg, given in a controlled environment with oxygen
•
•
•
•

NON-MALIGNANT RESPIRATORY DISEASE

• Depression rates are high in patients with COPD. Consider antidepressant treatment and counselling. Amitriptyline or citalopram may be
effective at helping anxiety also
• Relaxation exercises, diaphragmatic breathing training, and complementary therapies may help some patients

Cough
• Treat the underlying cause
• Refer to physiotherapy to improve cough efﬁcacy, particularly if large
volume secretions
• Consider mucolytics, steroids, antibiotics
• Try simple or codeine linctus
• Nebulized saline may help expectoration
• Methadone linctus 1–2 mg nocte or bd may be of beneﬁt
• Oral local anaesthetics, such as benzocaine and lignocaine lozenges may
be useful for laryngeal, pharyngeal or tracheal irritation, but associated
risk of aspiration
• Nebulized local anaesthetic may helps, e.g. 5 mL 2% lidocaine 6-hourly
or bupivacaine 5 mL 0.25% 6-hourly (avoid in asthmatics, as it causes
bronchospasm). Pharyngeal numbness is likely to occur, so avoid ﬂuids
for 1–2 h afterwards.

CHAPTER 60

Pulmonary rehabilitation

Aims and patient selection
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a well-established multidisciplinary programme
of care for patients with chronic respiratory impairment. The programme
is individually tailored for each patient. Pulmonary rehabilitation is not
available yet in every centre, although it is probably the most cost-effective
intervention in COPD.

Aims of rehabilitation
• To reduce disability and handicap in people with chronic lung disease
• To improve quality of life and restore independence
• To diminish the health care burden of disease.
Early studies measured pulmonary function tests and found there was no
improvement after pulmonary rehabilitation. The ﬁrst positive study of
pulmonary rehabilitation measured functional status.
Meta-analysis of 14 RCTs using a variety of different style programmes has
conﬁrmed the beneﬁt of rehabilitation, with improvements in functional
exercise.
• Further UK RCT of patients with severe airﬂow obstruction showed
improvements in exercise, health status, and health economic advantages
• Patients who had completed rehabilitation courses had no fewer
hospital admissions for exacerbations than those who had not had
rehabilitation, but hospital stays were shorter (10 days vs. 21 days)
• Patients with COPD who have completed rehabilitation courses perform
better than controls on walking tests and have less subjective dyspnoea
• Rehabilitation programmes containing lower-extremity training are
better, when compared with controls, than those using just respiratory
muscle training
• Short-term programmes achieve overall similar outcome beneﬁts
across the spectrum of patient disability. A minimum programme length
of 6 weeks is recommended
• Decline in exercise tolerance and health status tends to occur between
6 and 12 months after completion of a course. Sustained improvement
with ongoing rehabilitation sessions has yet to be evaluated.

Candidates
• Anyone with chronic lung disease causing functional impairment
• The majority of candidates will have COPD, but also asthma, pulmonary
ﬁbrosis, and bronchiectasis
• Any stage of a lung disease, when symptoms are affecting a patient’s
activity. Ideally receiving optimum medical treatment
• Well-motivated patients seem to beneﬁt most
• Patients with poor lower limb mobility may beneﬁt from upper limb
exercise
• Oxygen therapy is not a contraindication to rehabilitation
• Stable ischaemic heart disease is not a contraindication to rehabilitation.
Candidates in whom rehabilitation may not be indicated
• Unstable ischaemic heart disease, severe valvular heart disease, cognitive
impairment, locomotor difﬁculties
• Poorly motivated people with geographical or transport problems
making attendance difﬁcult tend to do less well.

CHAPTER 60

Pulmonary rehabilitation

Programme
Programmes are usually run on an out-patient basis, but can be done in
the community, in the home, or as an in-patient. They are run by a multiprofessional team—physician, physiotherapist, occupational therapist,
dietician, nurse, pharmacist, social worker, and psychologist. A minimum
programme length of 6 weeks is recommended. Programmes should be
regularly audited by the department.
• Physical training The main component of the programme, with aerobic
exercise such as walking and cycling 2–3 times per week, with 2 supervised/class sessions. May include upper limb strength exercise with
weights. Individually prescribed exercise programmes, designed for
each patient to work to high intensity. Beneﬁt increases with training
intensity. Oxygen supplementation may be required if signiﬁcant desaturation occurs during exercise to below 80%
• Disease education
• Psychological and social intervention with advice on anxiety and
depression, smoking cessation, plus physiotherapy and occupational
therapy input
• Nutritional education to optimize body weight and muscle mass.

Pre-rehabilitation assessment
• Optimize medical treatment
• Oxygen saturation on exercise
• ECG may be warranted, especially if history of cardiac disease.

Outcome assessment measures
• Physical Often with shuttle walk tests (SWT) or 6-min walk test
(6MWT) to assess ability and progress (see box opposite)
• Health status Disease-speciﬁc questionnaires:
• Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ)
• St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire
• Generic questionnaires
• Short Form-36 (SF-36)
• Hospital Anxiety and Depression scores (HADS) are measured, but
are insensitive to change during pulmonary rehabilitation
• Practical Pulmonary Function Status–Dyspnoea Questionnaire
(PFS-DQ) may be used to measure performance and satisfaction
relating to activities of daily living.

PROGRAMME

Shuttle walk test (SWT)
10-m course between two points. Walking speed determined by external
audio-tape signals (‘beeps’), and the patient should pace their walk to
reach each point at a beep. The patient is required to incrementally
increase their speed as the beeps occur more frequently. Test ﬁnishes
when the patient needs to stop and distance achieved calculated.

6-min walk test (6MWT)
30-m course between two points on a hard ﬂat surface. Patients do as
many 60-m laps as they can around the 2 points in 6 min. They determine their pace and intensity of exercise. They are allowed to rest in the
time if they need to. Total distance walked in 6 min is counted. Results
vary according to mood and encouragement.

Future developments
• Determining which components of rehabilitation are the most valuable
to improvements in exercise: intensity of exercise programme, type of
exercise
• How to optimally maintain the improvements following a rehabilitation
programme
• Performance enhancement using oxygen, steroids, nutrition, creatine,
heliox, non-invasive ventilation.

CHAPTER 61

Smoking cessation

Aims and nicotine replacement therapy
Smoking is the main cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
lung cancer. The NHS spends £1.7 billion per year caring for people with
smoking-related conditions. Government targets have been set to reduce
the number of smokers in the UK and health authorities have been allocated funding for smoking cessation services.
• Approximately 31% of men and 29% of women in the UK smoke and
82% of smokers start as teenagers
• The incidence of smoking is increasing in developing countries
• Smoking is also associated with bladder, oesophageal, cervical, and renal
cancers, as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease
• Nicotine exerts its effects on the CNS and is very addictive
• Peak nicotine withdrawal time is 2–3 days
• 0.4% of smokers manage to stop each year
• Stopping smoking is associated with an average weight gain of 2 kg
• Government legislation in the UK banned smoking in the workplace
and public places from 1st July 2007 and increased the age for sale of
tobacco from 16 to 18 on 1st October 2007.

Aims of smoking cessation interventions In order to achieve the
goal of sustained abstinence, the aim is to reduce short-term cravings for
nicotine (nicotine and non-nicotine replacement therapy) and in the long
term to modify behaviour (counselling, telephone or group support (buddy
systems)). It is vital that the smoker is motivated to stop or attempts will
fail. It is important as a health professional to address smoking cessation at
all opportunities. Health professionals can trigger quit attempts by giving
brief advice to all smokers. This can lead to 1–3 out of 100 people stopping smoking for 6 months. Doctor advice often has the strongest impact.
People may be more receptive to smoking cessation advice during times
of concern for their own or their families health. A guide to approaching
the topic is:
• Ask how much a person smokes and document pack-years
• Advise on risks of continued smoking. Assess commitment to quitting
• Assist by offering behavioural therapy ± pharmacotherapy
• Provide self-help material and refer to stop smoking services
• Arrange follow-up.
Some hospitals or primary care trusts have smoking cessation counsellors.
The best results in terms of quit rates are achieved by combining counselling with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, or varenicline,
with regular support and follow-up. These can improve quit rates to around
25%. The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence has issued
guidance on the use of nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and
varenicline for smoking cessation. This advises pharmacotherapy should
only be for a smoker committed to a target stop date. Choice of therapy
is based on a patient’s likely compliance, availability of counselling, previous
experience of therapies, contraindications, and patient preference. Prescribe
2 weeks of NRT or 3–4 weeks of bupropion/varenicline and only give
further prescription if individuals show a continuing attempt to quit. If they
fail to quit, a second attempt within 6 months should not be funded.

AIMS AND NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) allows short- and mediumterm nicotine withdrawal symptoms to be minimized, by replacing nicotine. Should not be used whilst still smoking, as it is possible to overdose
on nicotine (symptoms: agitation, confusion, restlessness, palpitations,
hypertension, dilated pupils, SOB, abdominal cramps, vomiting). Can be
bought over the counter or be prescribed by general practitioner, and is
cheaper than cigarettes. Most NRT products are contraindicated in pregnancy, breast-feeding mothers, and children under 18, but are used under
supervision.
• Patches Give small amounts of nicotine via transdermal patch to
decrease cravings before they occur. Different strength patches (15, 10,
5 mg) according to how much is smoked. Use higher dose patch if
10+ cigarettes per day smoked. Convenient. Worn continuously
throughout day, but removed at night due to vivid nature of dreams.
Can get localized irritation at patch site. Patches should be used for
6–8 weeks at the higher dose, then weaned to a lower dose for
2–4 weeks. Available to buy over the counter
• Chewing gum Different strengths of gum that release nicotine as they
are chewed. (Smoke <20/day - chew one 2-mg piece slowly for 30 min
when urge to smoke occurs. Smoke >20/day or needing >15 pieces
of 2-mg gum daily—use 4-mg strength gum. Max 15 4-mg pieces/day).
Relieves cravings as they occur. When mouth tingles and has peppery
taste, should stop chewing and ‘park’ the gum inside the cheek.
Nicotine is then absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Should
not chew continuously or may become nauseated. Nicotine needs to
be absorbed through mouth and not swallowed in saliva. Therefore
don’t drink with gum. Physical act of chewing can relieve craving. Can
taste unpleasant and may need to use several packs of gum a day. Use
for 3 months, then reduce the strength and the amount of gum used.
Available to buy over the counter
• Sublingual tablets used on demand to help with cravings. Useful for
smokers wanting a discreet form of treatment. 1–2 tablets should be
placed under the tongue every hour when needed. Dissolve over
30 min. Licensed for use in pregnancy (1 tablet only). Use for 3 months
and then gradually reduce the number of tablets used a day. Available
on prescription
• Lozenges Available to buy over the counter
• Inhalator Cigarette style appliance giving small amounts of nicotine
when used. Useful for people who are habitual or ritualistic in when
they have a cigarette and want the ‘hand to mouth’ routine. Nicotine is
absorbed through the lining of the mouth, not via the lungs. Use for
2 months, and then gradually reduce. Available on prescription
• Nasal spray provides rapid relief of craving. Faster absorption than
other forms of NRT. May cause local irritation. Use for 2 months; then
reduce. Available on prescription.

CHAPTER 61

Smoking cessation

Non-nicotine replacement therapy
Drugs
Bupropion (Zyban®) is promoted as an aid to smoking cessation in combination with motivational support. It is an antidepressant that was found to
reduce the desire to smoke, regardless of whether people were depressed
or not. It weakly inhibits dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline reuptake
in the CNS. It counteracts nicotine withdrawal symptoms by increasing
these levels in the brain. It is suitable if people smoke 10 or more cigarettes
a day. Liver metabolism and 20 h half-life. Smokers start taking bupropion
1–2 weeks before their intended ‘quit day’. Continue taking it for 7–9
weeks after. Leads to improved abstinence rates compared with placebo
or nicotine patch if associated with counselling (30% 12-month abstinence rate with bupropion, 16% with nicotine patch, 15% with placebo,
35% with patch and bupropion). (NEJM 1999; 340: 685–91) Also thought
to lessen weight gain associated with stopping smoking. Contraindicated
in patients with epilepsy or at risk of ﬁts, those with a CNS tumour, those
acutely withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, pregnancy, those
with eating disorders and those on monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Reduce
dose if elderly or hepatic or renal impairment. Recognized adverse effects
include dry mouth, hypersensitivity, insomnia, seizures (1 in 1000 users) and
death. Prescription only.
Varenicline (Champix®/Chantix®) is a new drug, also promoted as an aid
to smoking cessation in combination with motivational support. It binds
to the A4B2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acts as a partial agonist.
Its binding alleviates symptoms of craving and withdrawal, and reduces
the rewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking by preventing nicotine
binding to the A4B2 receptors. Smokers start taking varenicline 1–2 weeks
before their intended ‘quit day’ and continue for 12–24 weeks. Starting
dose is 500 µg od for 3 days, 500 µg bd for 4 days, then 1 mg bd for
11 weeks, if tolerated. If smokers are abstinent after 12 weeks, they should
continue for another 12 weeks to avoid relapse. Avoid abrupt withdrawal.
Side-effects include nausea, vomiting, appetite change, change in taste,
headache, difﬁculty sleeping, abnormal dreams, dry mouth, tiredness. Use
with caution if breast feeding, history of psychiatric disease, renal impairment. RCTs have shown signiﬁcantly higher quit rates with varenicline
than with bupropion or placebo. Quit rates are higher with higher doses
(e.g. continuous quit rate for any 4 weeks: 48% with 1 mg bd (p = 0.01 vs.
placebo), 37% with 1 mg od (p = 0.01), 33% with bupropion (p = 0.02, 17%
with placebo), Drug-side effects leading to stopping treatment were lower
than with bupropion (Arch Int Med 2006; 166: 1561–8). Prescription only.

Hypnosis aims to improve will power in the subconscious state with
therapeutic suggestion. Anecdotal success, but Cochrane review of trials
showed no greater abstinence rate with hypnosis than with any other
treatment or placebo treatment.

Acupuncture/acupressure No evidence in favour of it over placebo
acupuncture.

NON-NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY

Future developments
• Increasing and improving hospital-based smoking cessation services
with links to community-based services
• Nicotine immunotherapy. Laboratory-based models to create a ‘nicotine vaccine’ to try and prevent abstinent smokers from re-starting
are in progress. Induce speciﬁc nicotine antibodies to prevent inhaled
nicotine from binding to nicotine receptors and causing neurological
stimulation.

Tracheostomy

735

736

CHAPTER 62

Tracheostomy

Temporary tracheostomy is most often performed as an adjunct to
assisted ventilation. Such patients are now often returned to respiratory
wards for ‘decannulation’.

Indications for tracheostomy on the ICU (no uniform agreement)
• Usually performed after a period of time following intubation with an
endotracheal tube
• Improved patient communication (with appropriate cuff deﬂation and/
or tube fenestration)
• Possible reduction in laryngeal damage. The evidence for this is very
limited
• Nursing care potentially easier
• Facilitation of weaning.
(There is no evidence for a reduced incidence of aspiration or pneumonia with
tracheostomy versus endotracheal tube.)
The usual practice is to convert from endotracheal tube to tracheostomy at 7 days if ventilation is likely to be needed beyond 14 days.
Conversion beyond 14 days is considered best practice and certainly by
21 days.

Percutaneous versus surgical tracheostomy Percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) can be performed on the ICU immediately once the decision is made and is quicker than conventional tracheostomy. There are a
variety of PT techniques: Griggs’ guidewire with dilating forceps, and the
Ciaglia multiple or single (Blue Rhino) dilator approach, preferably with
endoscopic veriﬁcation of placement. In the Blue Rhino system a curved,
cone-shaped dilator is slid over a guidewire and introduced into the
tracheal lumen between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings until the hole is
large enough to accept the required tracheostomy tube. This technique
requires controlled force and there is signiﬁcant potential for traumatic
damage. The ﬁt of the tracheostomy tube is tighter, with less stomal infection, less post-operative haemorrhage, but the long-term complications
of the two techniques are similar. However, units with prompt access to
surgical tracheostomy tend to use this whenever possible, due to the
potential traumatic damage from the PT approach. Humidiﬁcation of
the inspired gas is always required to prevent the build-up of thick viscid
mucus. Humidiﬁcation can only be withdrawn in long-term tracheostomy
patients after several weeks or months.

Decannulation Tracheostomy may still be required to administer intermittent ventilation, reduce ventilatory deadspace, aid respiratory secretion clearance, limit aspiration (when cuffed), and bypass any upper airway
obstruction. This is weighed against the consequences of a tracheostomy:
increased tendency to aspirate (because of a reduced ability to swallow),
reduced ability to talk, and the increased infection brought about from a
foreign body in the trachea and bypassing the upper airway. Thus, decannulation should be carried out as soon as:
• Adequate clearance of secretions, i.e. good cough and thin secretions
• No upper airway obstruction

TRACHEOSTOMY

• No signiﬁcant aspiration (can be checked by drinking methylene blue
and then suctioning), although a small amount is not an absolute
contraindication
• No need to continue ventilation for maintenance of gas exchange
• Conversion to non-invasive ventilation is possible, and has been demonstrated to work adequately.
The ability to cope adequately without the tracheostomy can be repeatedly determined (and for increasing periods) by capping the tube with the
cuff fully deﬂated and preferably with a fenestrated tube.
Once a tube has been removed, the stoma can close over very quickly
and make reinsertion difﬁcult. Introducing a ‘guidewire’, over which the old
tube is removed and the new can be inserted, is often useful (a suction
tube, with the connector cut off, will sufﬁce).
The ﬁnal decision to decannulate is often delayed unnecessarily. Sooner
rather than later is usually better.

Available tube options Tracheostomy tubes can be cuffed or uncuffed.
If ventilation is not necessary, and aspiration is not a problem, cuffs are not
required. Some patients can be adequately ventilated even with the cuff
down (or no cuff at all): this is usually in patients with normal lungs where
the compliance is good and inﬂation pressures therefore low.
Tracheostomy tubes can be either single or double (i.e. with an inner
and outer tube). Double tubes allow better cleaning and therefore reduce
the chance of the lumen obstructing, but the diameter of the lumen is of
course less for a similar sized external diameter.
Tracheostomy tubes can be fenestrated to allow exhalation via the larynx
to aid talking. The fenestration can be closed off with a non-fenestrated
inner tube, should intermittent ventilation still be required.
Speaking valves are available that ﬁt on the tracheostomy, allowing
inspiration via the tracheostomy, but close and allow expiration via the
larynx (if cuff down and/or fenestration open). They effectively maintain a
reduced deadspace, maintain access for suctioning, but allow talking.

CHAPTER 63

Airway management

Simple airway
3 Call for anaesthetic help early
Patients may require support of their airway and ventilation/oxygenation in situations when they are unable to adequately maintain these.
Such situations may be related to a Glasgow Coma Score of <8, which
can cause difﬁculties with airway maintenance, or related to respiratory
compromise or arrest in the critically ill patient.

Simple airway adjuncts are used to overcome backward tongue displacement in an unconscious patient.
Oropharyngeal airway (Guedel) A curved plastic tube with a ﬂanged end
that is inserted into the mouth. Size is estimated by holding it at the side of
the patient’s face and estimating required length from angle of the mouth
to angle of the jaw. Ensure the mouth is clear, then insert the airway ‘upside
down’, with the curved side towards the tongue. When it is in as far as the
soft palate, turn it around by 180° and push it in further, so the ﬂange is at the
patient’s mouth. If the patient has a gag reﬂex, remove the airway. Suction can
be performed through the airway and oxygen administered via a mask.
Nasopharyngeal airway A soft plastic tube with a bevelled end and a ﬂange
at the other end. Better tolerated in the semi-conscious, and should not
be used in those with base of skull fractures. Sizes 6–7mm are suitable for
adults. If necessary, insert a safety pin through the ﬂange. Lubricate it with
water-soluble jelly and insert the bevelled end into a nostril and gently push
back with a twisting action. Do not force if obstruction is encountered, but
remove and try in the other nostril. Nasal bleeding can be caused if the
mucosa is damaged. The safety pin ensures the airway is not dislodged into
lung. Oxygen can be administered through a mask.
Intubation
Endotracheal tube The optimal method of managing a patient’s airway and
providing airway protection from aspiration of gastric contents. Requires
training in tube insertion. The tube is bevelled at one end with an inﬂatable cuff and has a connector at the other end. The connector can be
removed if the tube needs to be cut, but can be replaced.
- Patient lies ﬂat, with neck ﬂexed and head extended (the ‘snifﬁng the
morning air’ position). A pillow is placed under the head, not the neck,
to aid this
- Pre-oxygenate with bag and mask ventilation
- Using the laryngoscope in left hand and standing behind the head, the
mouth is opened, and the laryngoscope placed over the right side of
the tongue and advanced
- It may be necessary to apply suction to clear the mouth of secretions
- When the epiglottis is seen, the laryngoscope is advanced into the vallecula, between the root of the epiglottis and the base of the tongue
Upward pressure in the direction of the laryngoscope handle is applied
to lift the jaw slightly and the cords should come into view, taking care
not to damage the teeth
- Slide the tube through the cords and then withdraw the laryngoscope
- Inﬂate the cuff

AIRWAY MANAGEMENT

- Conﬁrm adequate tube position by auscultating for breath sounds over
the chest bilaterally
- End tidal CO2 measurement should be used if available; 5 breaths
showing CO2 conﬁrm an adequate tube position
- If the tube is not in position, usually because it has been passed into the
oesophagus or the right main bronchus, deﬂate the cuff, remove the
tube, and re-oxygenate with the bag and mask, before trying again. Pull
the tube back slightly if the breath sounds are only on the right as this
suggests the tube is in the right main bronchus
- Secure the tube
- Administer oxygen with a self-inﬂating bag with oxygen and reservoir
bag
- CXR to conﬁrm correct tube position 2–3 cm above the carina
- Suction can be performed through the tube

Laryngeal mask airway
An alternative to formal intubation. A wide-bore tube with an inﬂated cuff
at one end, which is positioned over the larynx and inﬂated, hence forming
a seal; thus aspiration of gastric contents and gastric inﬂation are minimized.
It is easy to insert, and is used in anaesthetic practice and also used in
emergencies. Requires minimal head tilt, so is ideal for use in patients with
possible cervical spine injuries. Not suitable for patients with high airway
resistance, such as pulmonary oedema, bronchospasm, or COPD. Select a
size 4 or 5 tube and, after ensuring the cuff works, deﬂate it. Put watersoluble lubricating jelly over the cuff. The patient should be lying ﬂat, with
head extension if possible. Hold the tube like a pen and insert from behind
the patient’s head, with the point of the cuff positioned to the back of the
mouth. Advance along the roof of the mouth and then press it downwards
and backwards until resistance is felt. Inﬂate the cuff, which will cause the
tube to lift out of the mouth a little. Conﬁrm adequate airway position by
auscultating for breath sounds over the chest bilaterally. Secure the tube.

CHAPTER 64

Bronchoscopy

Indications and risks
Bronchoscopy is the procedure of passing a telescope or camera into
the trachea to inspect the large and medium-sized airways. It may be performed with a ﬂexible scope using local anaesthetic ± sedation, favoured
by physicians, or under a general anaesthetic with a rigid scope, used
mostly by surgeons. Airways can be visually inspected, samples taken, and
therapeutic procedures can be performed. This chapter focuses on ﬂexible bronchoscopy.

Indications for bronchoscopy
• Suspected lung cancer Patients who have a central mass <4 cm from
the origin of the nearest lobar bronchus, which is likely to be accessible
for biopsy at bronchoscopy
• Suspected pulmonary infection such as TB in a patient who is unable to
produce sputum, or in immunocompromised patients, with fever, cough,
hypoxia, or CXR changes (induced sputum with hypertonic saline may
be an alternative; see p 769)
• Suspected interstitial lung disease if a transbronchial biopsy will
provide an adequate sample for diagnostic purposes, such as in sarcoid.
Only indicated in a limited number of interstitial lung diseases, as more
adequate biopsies are often obtained through open lung biopsy, which
may be preferable
• Foreign body removal if this is located proximally
• Therapeutic indications include central airway obstruction, sputum
plugging, and possibly emphysema (endobronchial lung volume reduction, see p 180) and asthma (bronchial thermoplasty, see p 137).

Relative contraindications/take care
• If a patient has saturations below 90% on air at rest, or PaO2 less than
8 kPa, the risk of signiﬁcant hypoxia during bronchoscopy is increased
• FEV1 <40% predicted
• Blood clotting abnormalities, particularly platelet level <50 000/mm3
• Uraemia, pulmonary hypertension, SVCO, liver disease, and immunosuppression predispose to haemorrhage
• Recent myocardial infarction may be associated with cardiac ischaemia
during bronchoscopy. Wait until 4–6 weeks after.

Risks associated with bronchoscopy Flexible bronchoscopy is a safe
procedure, with reported mortality rates in large series being 0.01–0.04%
and major complications of 0.08–0.12%. Complications include respiratory
depression, pneumonia, pneumothorax, airway obstruction, laryngospasm,
cardiorespiratory arrest, arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema, vasovagal episodes, fever (especially following BAL), septicaemia, haemorrhage, nausea,
and vomiting.

INDICATIONS AND RISKS

Bleeding and bronchoscopy
• Bleeding occurs in approximately 0.7% of patients due to mechanical
trauma from the scope, suctioning, brushing, or biopsy, but is more
common with transbronchial biopsy (1.6–4.4%). Patients with malignancy, immunocompromise, or uraemia have an increased bleeding
tendency
• If bleeding does not stop spontaneously, the bronchoscope should be
wedged to tamponade the bleeding in the segmental bronchus. Use
minimal suction, to allow clot formation. 1 mL aliquots of 1:10 000
adrenaline solution are administered via the bronchoscope as near to
the bleeding point as possible, until it stops. Iced saline may be useful
• If massive haemorrhage occurs, the patient should be turned on to the
side of the bleeding to protect the other lung. Balloon tipped vascular
catheter may be used to tamponade the bleeding point. If bleeding continues, emergency or thoracic surgery may be indicated.

CHAPTER 64

Bronchoscopy

Patient preparation and procedure
Patient preparation
• Information Patients should be given written information about the
procedure ideally more than 24 h prior to the procedure. Provide an
information sheet for the patient to take home following the bronchoscopy, with advice about the effects of any sedation and possible complications, as well as telephone numbers in case help is needed
• Consent The physician performing the bronchoscopy should obtain
written consent, with a description of the procedure and its associated
risks
• Nil by mouth Patients should have no food for 4 h beforehand and
clear ﬂuids only until 2 h beforehand
• Blood tests Patients do not need routine pre-procedure blood tests,
unless there are speciﬁc concerns (uraemia, deranged LFTs, low platelets). Many physicians check platelet counts and clotting times prior to
transbronchial biopsy (platelets >75 000/mm3, PT, and APTT within 1–2
s of control) and warfarin/heparin/low molecular weight heparin may
be temporarily stopped
• Bedside tests Consider performing an ECG in patients with a history of
cardiac disease. Check blood sugar in patients with diabetes
• Prophylactic antibiotics recommended in those at risk of endocarditis,
i.e. asplenic, heart valve prosthesis, previous infective endocarditis:
amoxicillin 3 g PO 1 h pre-bronchoscopy, or if penicillin allergic,
clindamycin 600 mg PO or azithromycin 200 mg PO. Recent guidelines,
however, from British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy suggest
this is not necessary (Gould FK et al. J Antimicrob Chemother 2006; 57:
1035–42)
• In those with asthma, a nebulized bronchodilator should be given
before the bronchoscopy
• Those at high risk of infection (TB) should be last on the list.

Procedure
• Practices vary between centres. Some perform bronchoscopy with
the patient sitting up facing the operator; some from behind with the
patient lying ﬂat
• IV access should be present in all patients
• Nasal oxygen should be administered and oximetry measured
throughout
• Premedication may be given in addition for mild sedation, anxiolysis,
and anterograde amnesia. A benzodiazepine such as midazolam 2 mg,
with 1 mg increments as necessary, may be used with fentanyl. Some
patients and operators prefer not to use sedation, due to concerns
particularly in elderly patients, those with COPD, or those with cardiac
disease. Midazolam can make some patients more agitated. Premedication
with anticholinergics is not beneﬁcial during bronchoscopy

PATIENT PREPARATION AND PROCEDURE

• Lidocaine Local anaesthetic spray or gel is applied to the nostrils and
the vocal cords are anaesthetized by spraying local anaesthetic (lidocaine 10 mg/spray) to the back of the throat and allowing time to work.
Peak plasma levels occur after 15 min.
• Transcricoid injection may be used to administer 4% lidocaine
into the trachea, or this may be anaesthetized under direct vision
through the bronchoscope, when the vocal cords are open
• Aliquots of 1–2% lidocaine may be administered to right and left
main bronchi via the bronchoscope when it is passed through the
vocal cords into the trachea. Use the minimal dose required for
cough suppression. Peak plasma levels occur after 5 min via the
scope. Airway inﬂammation increases lidocaine absorption
• Maximum dose of lidocaine is 8 mg/kg (= 29 mL of 2% solution in
70 kg patient); 5 mg/kg if hepatic or cardiac insufﬁciency. Toxic
effects include seizures and arrhythmias
• The half-life of lidocaine is 1.5–2 h
• Most access the trachea via the nasal route, as this gives increased stability when taking biopsies and allows the patient to cough and spit out
secretions more easily. If this is not possible, a mouth guard is used and
access obtained through the mouth
• All sections of the bronchial tree should be visually inspected, including
the cords and trachea. CXR or CT may help localize the area of
concern so specimen site can then be targeted. This increases the
diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy in cases of suspected lung cancer
• Avoid unnecessary suction, as this can increase hypoxia.

CHAPTER 64

Bronchoscopy

Sampling techniques
Bronchial washings are taken by instilling about 10 mL of saline and
then collecting it in a pot/trap to obtain superﬁcial airway cells.
Bronchial brushings are taken by inserting a covered brush into a
bronchial segment, uncovering it, rubbing the bronchial wall, covering it,
removing it, and wiping it on a slide. The slide is then sprayed with a cell
ﬁxing solution.

Bronchial biopsies are taken with biopsy forceps. 5–7 should be taken
to optimize yield. These may be taken blindly or from a visibly abnormal
area, which gives a higher diagnostic yield than blind biopsies. They can be
placed in formalin or saline solution depending on whether they are for
histology or microbiology.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed by inserting 50–100 mL
of saline through the bronchoscope when it is wedged well in a small
airway. Ideally instil ﬂuid during inspiration and, after allowing the ﬂuid
to dwell for 10–30 s, aspirate back into the syringe during expiration or
collect in a trap. Best performed in the area of abnormality on CXR or
CT, or non-dependent lobes such as the right middle lobe or lingula. Poor
return if the patient is coughing excessively or if they have emphysema.
Can cause hypoxia proportional to amount of lavage ﬂuid used.
Transbronchial biopsy (TBB) Technique of passing transbronchial
biopsy forceps down a terminal bronchus until resistance is ﬁrst felt and
taking a sample of parenchymal tissue. Safe to perform if patient is taking
aspirin or on subcutaneous heparin, but omit clopidogrel for 5 days before
(as well as aspirin if taking both) and, if on warfarin, wait until INR <1.3.
Some perform with radiological screening.
Associated with a signiﬁcant risk of bleeding in 9% and pneumothorax
in 3.5%, but up to 14% if patient is mechanically ventilated. Half of all pneumothoraces require chest drains. Therefore perform on one side only and
minimize risk by performing TBB in the lower lobes, in dependent segments. Perform CXR 1 h after the bronchoscopy. Pneumothorax should
be managed according to standard guidelines (p 376). Small pneumothoraces often resolve spontaneously, but the patient may need admission
if there are concerns.

Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) (see p 286) is used to
sample mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes in suspected malignancy, TB, or
sarcoidosis. It is also useful in sampling extrabronchial masses or necrotic
endobronchial tumour. When added to other sampling techniques in lung
cancer, it increases the diagnostic yield by 18%.

When performing bronchoscopy
• Wear gloves, face mask and eye shields
• Use particulate (duck) masks if there are concerns about TB or HIV

CHAPTER 64

Bronchoscopy

Central airway obstruction
(see also upper airway obstruction, p 640)
Central airway = trachea and mainstem bronchi
Obstruction can be:
• Extrinsic, such as tumour pressing on airway causing obstruction
• Intrinsic, such as tumour occluding airway lumen
• Mixed, a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic
Symptoms and signs
• May be asymptomatic if obstruction is mild
• Productive cough, due to mucosal swelling and mucous production
• Wheeze, unilateral wheeze, positional wheeze
• Stridor
• Secondary atelectasis and pneumonia
• Dyspnoea
Investigations
• Flow–volume loops, FEV1
• CXR—may be normal
• CT chest + 3D airway reconstruction if possible
• Bronchoscopy to make tissue diagnosis of underlying disease
Treatment
• Secure airway
• Consider bronchoscopy – senior physician ± anaesthetist should
perform. Bronchoscopy itself can cause obstruction in a compromised
airway. Adrenaline administered via bronchoscope may be helpful
• Consider endobronchial treatment: core out tumour, dilate a stenosis,
or place a stent (see p 755)
• Consider heliox (see p 641)
Causes of central airway obstruction
• Malignant
• Primary endoluminal cancer, especially lung cancer or carcinoid
• Metastatic cancer
• Laryngeal cancer
• Oesphageal cancer
• Mediastinal tumour
• Lymphadenopathy, lymphoma

CENTRAL AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION

• Non-malignant
• Lymphadenopathy
• Relapsing polychondritis
• Tracheomalacia
• Papilloma
• Hamartoma

CHAPTER 64

Bronchoscopy

Interventional bronchoscopy
Used particularly in the diagnosis and palliative treatment of patients with
lung cancer and central airway obstruction due to local tumour growth,
where the relief of the obstruction will have symptomatic beneﬁts.

Diagnostic procedures
Transbronchial needle aspiration and endobronchial ultrasound allow
mediastinal node sampling without the surgical procedure of mediastinoscopy. Some lymph nodes are accessible for sampling in this way, which
cannot be accessed via mediastinoscopy.
Transbronchial needle aspirate (TBNA) Technique of inserting a biopsy needle
blindly through the bronchial wall into an enlarged lymph node or extrabronchial mass, and aspirating cells. Used to give additional staging information in lung cancer. Appropriate lymph nodes should be identiﬁed on CT
ﬁrst. Should be performed initially, so the bronchoscope is not contaminated with malignant cells from the airway, and start with the highest-stage
lymph nodes ﬁrst. Push sheath out through end of bronchoscope until the
hub is just visible. Extend the needle and then position over nodal position
and insert through bronchial wall. Subcarinal and right hilar nodes are the
easiest to sample. Aim for 5–7 needle passes.
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) Technique of visualizing the bronchial
wall and the immediate surrounding structures via an ultrasound probe
either incorporated into the tip of the bronchoscope or passed down the
scope. A balloon surrounding the probe is inﬂated with water, in order
to achieve close circular contact and view surrounding structures. Useful
to assess lymph node involvement in malignancy and to guide TBNA:
left and right paratracheal, carinal, subcarinal and some hilar nodes can
be assessed. Mediastinal structures or masses next to the airways can
be identiﬁed, the depth of bronchial wall tumour invasion assessed, or
masses within the lung localized for biopsy. RCT shows improved yield
compared with ‘blind’ TBNA. Oesophageal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
is an alternative strategy, which allows examination of the posterior
and inferior mediastinum, the liver, the coeliac axis, and the left adrenal
gland. It is more accurate at diagnosing mediastinal metastases than CT
and PET.
Autoﬂuorescent bronchoscopy (AFB) Technique to differentiate central
malignant areas from normal tissue, including dysplasia and pre-invasive
tumours in situ. However, the progression of these abnormalities is not
known, so the role of AFB is unclear. Used in conjunction with usual white
light bronchoscopy. Uses blue light to induce tissue autoﬂuorescence,
which means normal and abnormal tissues appear different colours when
viewed through a specialized bronchoscope. Airway trauma, however, can
also cause a different mucosal appearance and the test has low speciﬁcity.
It is being used in some centres as a surveillance tool following surgical
resection of lung cancer, or in patients with head and neck cancer suspected of having a lung primary, or following positive sputum cytology. Its
role is not, however, clear and advances in standard white light bronchoscopes (such as using narrow band imaging) may be found to be as good at
identifying abnormal mucosa.

INTERVENTIONAL BRONCHOSCOPY

Rigid bronchoscopy Visualize bronchial tree to level of segmental bronchi.
Can remove or core out endobronchial tumours, insert a stent, dilate tracheal
or bronchial stenosis, and manage massive haemoptysis. Useful to provide
information regarding resectability in lung cancer by measuring airway length.
Incidence of serious complications <5%: hypoxia, laryngospasm, pneumothorax, bleeding.

Therapeutic procedures
Bronchial laser resection, electrocautery, argon–plasma coagulation,
photodynamic therapy (PDT) and cryotherapy These are all procedures
that can be used to debulk obstructing endobronchial lesions or coagulate a bleeding point. Electrocautery is the use of an electrical current via
a probe to heat tissue, causing coagulational vaporization, which enables
cutting. Laser achieves the same effect. These are used predominantly for
obstructing malignant lesions, but may be used to remove benign lesions,
e.g. papilloma, or to treat benign stenoses, e.g. due to intubation, sarcoidosis, Wegener’s, trauma, etc. Avoid using FiO2 >40% with both laser
and electrocautery, to minimize the ﬁre risk. Shave skin on thigh if necessary before placing electrode for electrocautery and avoid placing it
over metal prosthetic joints. Argon–plasma coagulation is a non-contact
method using argon gas. These are all effective immediately. Cryotherapy
is the technique of freezing and then thawing an area with a probe in order
to destroy tissue, such as an endobronchial obstructing lesion. It takes
hours–days to have its effects. It can also be used to remove a foreign
body, as freezing attaches foreign body to the end of the probe.
Photodynamic therapy Intravenous administration of a photosensitizer
drug to the patient, followed by bronchoscopic exposure of the presensitized tumour to a light of speciﬁc matching wavelength in order to
cause tumour necrosis. Airways cleared of debris immediately after and
again a few days later.
Bronchial stent insertion via the bronchoscope to re-establish airway
patency if there is extrinsic compression. Self-expanding metal stents
used in cases of external compression, such as lung cancer, for palliation of breathlessness. These are inserted over a guidewire with ﬂexible
bronchoscopic visualization. Repositioning can be tricky after placement.
Retained secretions can cause stent blockage. Silicone stents are used in
mainly benign disease and are inserted via rigid bronchoscopy. They are
easily removed and manoeuvred, but can migrate and lead to problems
with retained secretions.
Brachytherapy Procedure of endobronchial irradiation using iridium-192
via bronchoscope for endobronchial and intramural tumours. The radioactive source can be implanted into the tumour. Delayed effect, requires
several sessions. Complementary to other bronchoscopic therapies. Can
cause ﬁstulas and haemorrhage.

CHAPTER 65

Chest drains

Indications, drain types, complications
Chest drain insertion is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality, and careful consideration should be given to the precise indication
for drainage. Ultrasound guidance may be required for small or loculated
effusions (e.g. empyema).

Indications
• Tension pneumothorax (following needle decompression)
• Symptomatic pneumothorax with failed aspiration or underlying lung
disease
• Complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema
• Malignant pleural effusion for symptomatic relief and/or pleurodesis
• Haemothorax
• Traumatic haemopneumothorax
• Rarely, for symptomatic effusions of other aetiology.

Contraindications
• Inexperienced operator
• Lung adherent to chest wall
• Bleeding tendency (a relative contraindication; routine measurement
of platelet count and clotting in the absence of risk factors is not
required)
• Post-pneumonectomy (not a contraindication, but discuss with cardiothoracic surgical team; imaging may be required for drain placement).

Types of chest drain Traditional trocar drains consist of a ﬂexible plastic
tube surrounding a metal rod with a blunt tip and are available in a variety
of sizes. When inserted incorrectly or with excess force by an inexperienced operator, they can cause signiﬁcant harm and even death. Blue
portex drains are inserted over a ﬂexible plastic introducer in a similar
manner to trocar drains; they are available in a range of sizes, up to 28F.
Newer Seldinger-style drains involve sliding the drain into the pleural
cavity over a guidewire. They are safer than trocar drains, but still require
experience and care to be inserted safely and comfortably. Small (10–14F)
drains are more comfortable and are adequate for the majority of situations. Large bore chest drains (28–32F) are only rarely required, e.g.
secondary pneumothorax with large air leak and/or surgical emphysema,
acute haemothorax.
Complications
• Pain—very common. Opiate analgesia frequently required
• Inadequate drain position—may require withdrawal or insertion of new
drain
• Surgical emphysema (in pneumothorax)—air leaks into subcutaneous
tissues. May occur if tube blocked or positioned with holes subcutaneously, or with very large air leaks. See p 383 for management
• Infection—empyema rate around 1%, perhaps higher in trauma patients
• Organ damage (e.g. lung, liver, spleen, heart, great vessels, stomach)—
particularly if sharp trocar used. Intrapulmonary placement results in
signiﬁcant continuous bubbling and bleeding; this may occur in up to

6% of all drain insertions. Drainage of gastrointestinal contents suggests
bowel perforation (or oesophageal rupture as the cause of the effusion)
Haemorrhage into drain—bloody pleural ﬂuid is a common ﬁnding (e.g.
in malignant effusions), but unexpected large volume drainage of frank
blood suggests damage to organs or intercostal vessels. Clamp the
drain and leave it in place. Urgent imaging and surgical referral
Re-expansion pulmonary oedema (p 383)
Vasovagal reaction
Sudden death due to vagus nerve irritation reported.

CHAPTER 65

Chest drains

Insertion technique
An assistant is required.
1. Discuss procedure with patient and obtain written consent (unless
emergency situation)
2. Insert IV cannula
3. Consider sedation (e.g. midazolam 2–5 mg IV or diamorphine 2.5–5 mg
IV) with oxygen saturation monitoring; be cautious in patients with
severe underlying lung disease or respiratory failure
4. Position patient lying with bed head at 30°, with insertion side of
trunk rotated about 45° upwards, and arm on insertion side behind
their head; stand behind the patient. Alternative position is with
patient sitting forward, leaning over a table
5. Double-check correct side from chest examination and CXR
6. Choose insertion site: ideally within ‘triangle of safety’, which avoids
major vessels and muscles (boundaries: anteriorly, anterior axillary
line, and border of pectoralis major; posteriorly, posterior axillary
line inferiorly, horizontal to level of nipple in man or ﬁfth intercostal
space in woman). More posterolateral approaches are safe, but
less comfortable for the patient when lying; avoid posteromedial
approaches close to spine, as intercostal artery drops medially to lie
in mid-intercostal space
7. Sterile skin preparation. Wear sterile gloves and gown
8. Inﬁltrate skin, intercostal muscle, and parietal pleura with 10 mL of
1% lidocaine. Aim just above the upper border of the appropriate rib,
avoiding the neurovascular bundle that runs below each rib. The subcutaneous fat lacks pain receptors and does not require anaesthetic.
The parietal pleura, however, is extremely sensitive; use the full
10 mL of lidocaine
9. Verify that the site is correct by aspirating pleural ﬂuid or air.
Occasionally, a green (21G) needle may be too short in obese
patients, and a longer needle is required. If unable to aspirate ﬂuid
or air, do not proceed with drain insertion; consider image-guided
drainage
10. Whilst waiting for anaesthetic to work, prepare drain and
connections. Assistant should prepare underwater seal
11. Insert drain:
• Trocar drains Small (1-cm) skin incision parallel to rib. Consider
horizontal mattress stitch across incision to facilitate later closure.
Dissect intercostal muscles with blunt forceps (e.g. Spencer–Wells)—
the ﬁbres can be teased apart by opening and then removing the
forceps; do not close forceps within the chest, this may damage
underlying structures. This blunt dissection may take some time.
Insert trocar and drain smoothly and gently—there should not be
any signiﬁcant resistance. Never apply force when inserting a chest
drain. Once the chest wall has been entered, withdraw the trocar a
few centimetres and insert the drain into the pleural cavity. Never
insert the trocar blindly into pleural cavity. An alternative approach
is to remove the trocar and grip the end of the chest tube with
blunt forceps, and use these to guide the tube into the chest. Aim
towards the apex for a pneumothorax, and the lung base for a
pleural effusion

(Note—in emergencies, or in patients with extreme obesity or
subcutaneous emphysema, it may be appropriate to make a larger
initial incision and insert an index ﬁnger to assist the drain track)
• Seldinger drains Gently insert the introducer needle and check
that air or ﬂuid can be easily aspirated through it with a syringe.
Remove syringe. Smoothly insert the guidewire through the
introducer needle. Remove introducer needle. Slide plastic dilator
around guidewire to enlarge the entry-track. Remove the dilator
and slide the drain into the pleural cavity over the guidewire. Do
not let go of the guidewire at any time. Remove the wire when the
drain is within the chest
Connect the drain to underwater seal bottle via a three-way tap
and tubing. If the drain is correctly positioned in the pleural space it
should swing in time with respiration, and drain air or ﬂuid
Stitch and tape the drain in place on the chest wall
Ensure adequate analgesia
Warn the patient not to disconnect the tubing or lift the underwater
bottle above the level of the insertion site on the chest; supply a
‘chest drain information leaﬂet’
Obtain CXR to check position. The ‘ideal’ tube position (apex for
pneumothorax, base for effusion) is not necessary for effective
drainage, so do not reposition functioning drains on this basis. CT
may be useful in conﬁrming drain position in certain circumstances.
Drains are often positioned in ﬁssures, but in most cases this does
not affect their functioning
Small drains may need regular ﬂush to ensure potency; prescribe
10 mL normal saline ﬂush to drain tds

CHAPTER 65

Chest drains

Drain management
General points
• Patients should ideally be managed on a specialist ward by experienced
nursing staff. ‘Chest drain observations’ should be charted regularly,
including swinging, bubbling, and volume of ﬂuid output
• If drain water level does not swing with respiration, the drain is kinked
(check underneath dressing, as tube enters skin), blocked, clamped,
or incorrectly positioned (drainage holes not in pleural space; check
CXR). Occluded drains may sometimes be unblocked by a 30 mL saline
ﬂush. Non-functioning drains should be removed (risk of introducing
infection)
• Suction is sometimes used to encourage drainage, although there is a
lack of evidence regarding its use. Consider in cases of pneumothorax
with persistent air leak, or following chemical pleurodesis. Suction
should be high volume/low pressure, typically starting at a level of 5 cm
H2O and increasing to 10–20 cm H2O. It is often painful and may not be
tolerated by the patient.

To clamp or not to clamp?
Never clamp a bubbling chest drain (risk of tension pneumothorax). Clamping
may be considered in two situations:
• To control the rate of drainage of a large pleural effusion. Rapid
drainage of large volumes may result in re-expansion pulmonary
oedema; clamping, e.g. for 1 h after draining 1 L, may prevent this
• To avoid inappropriate drain removal in cases of pneumothorax with
a slow air leak, when bubbling appears to have ceased. Clamping of
a drain for several hours followed by repeat CXR in such situations
may detect very slow or intermittent air leaks. This is controversial,
however, and should only ever be considered on a specialist ward with
experienced nursing staff. If the patient becomes breathless, the drain
should be immediately unclamped.
• Drain removal Quickly and smoothly remove the drain, whilst
patient is breath-holding in expiration (although opinions on this
differ—some recommend removal in maximal inspiration). Tie previously placed mattress suture, if applicable. Apply dressing. CXR to
document lung position.

Cricothyroidotomy

763

764

CHAPTER 66

Cricothyroidotomy

Indication
In some situations of upper airway obstruction or facial trauma, ventilation and tracheal intubation of a patient is impossible. It may therefore
be necessary to create an immediate surgical airway below the level of
obstruction.

Cricothyroidotomy
3 Call for anaesthetic and ENT help
• Extend the head, with the patient lying ﬂat. Place a pillow under the
patient’s shoulders, not their head
• Identify cricothyroid membrane: soft triangular area above cricoid
ring and below the thyroid cartilage. (Put your ﬁngers on the larynx
and move them down to the soft area below, where you are aiming
for). Clean with antiseptic swab
• Puncture the membrane in the midline with a large bore cannula
(18G or larger). Remove the needle, attach a syringe, and aspirate
air to conﬁrm correct position. Speciﬁc cricothyroidotomy kits are
available
• Angle the cannula downwards at 45° and advance. Ensure air can still
be aspirated and then connect to high-pressure oxygen supply, with a
Y connector if possible
• Occlude one limb of Y connector with a ﬁnger until chest rises and
then release to allow exhalation, ideally via larynx. Inﬂate for 1 s and
deﬂate for 4 s. Must allow air to be exhaled. If there is no Y connector, a hole is cut in the oxygen tubing, which can be intermittently
occluded
• Secure the cannula
• Perform a formal surgical cricothyroidotomy with ENT help, as
needle method does not allow adequate ventilation as the tube is
too small and the larynx is blocked. Vertical skin incision; press lateral
edges outwards to minimize bleeding. Transverse cricothyroid membrane incision, take care not to damage cricoid cartilage. Dilate tract
with tracheal spreader or scalpel handle, and insert a cuffed tube.

CHAPTER 67

Miscellaneous diagnostic tests

Skin prick tests
These may be useful in identifying speciﬁc allergens causing immediate
hypersensitivity reactions. They may inﬂuence management and guide
allergen avoidance. They are also used to help deﬁne atopy. Triggers in
contact urticaria, atopic eczema, and suspected food allergy may also be
identiﬁed. The results are available almost immediately (compared with
a RAST test for speciﬁc IgE) and correlate well with RAST test results.
They should be carried out by staff trained to read the tests and manage
adverse reactions.
The allergens tested should be identiﬁed from the history, and
usually include common aeroallergens, e.g. grass, house dust mite
(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), and cat dander.

Practical points
• Testing should be performed off steroids and anti-histamines
• There is a very small risk of anaphylaxis; adrenaline and resuscitation
equipment should be available. Particular care is needed with food and
latex testing
• Put a drop of allergen on the skin (usually the inside forearm). A range
of allergens are available commercially. Fresh produce should be used
for suspected fruit and vegetable hypersensitivity
• Lance the skin through the allergen drop using a needle (do not draw
blood). This should be with a calibrated lancet (1 mm), held vertically,
or a hypodermic needle held at 45° to the skin
• The positive control is usually histamine, and the negative control the
dilutent (usually saline)
• Read the test after 15 min
• A positive result is an itchy weal, which should be compared with the
controls, as some subjects react to the skin prick alone (dermatographism)
• Test solutions are standardized to give a mean weal diameter of 6 mm
• A weal of 3 mm or more is considered positive (indicating allergen
sensitization)
• A positive result does not prove that the clinical symptoms are due
to bronchial hyperresponsiveness to the tested allergen, but do raise
clinical suspicion. Positive results can occur in those without symptoms,
and false negatives do occur.

RAST or radio-allergosorbent blood tests are more speciﬁc, but less
sensitive and more expensive than skin prick tests, but give similar information. There is no risk of anaphylaxis and the patient does not need to
stop steroids or antihistamines for the test to be performed.
Unconventional tests Electrodermal allergy testing (using a Vegatest
machine) was developed as an aid to homeopathic prescribing, and is widely
used in complementary medicine to assess allergic status to food and environmental allergens. It is based on small changes in skin electrical impedance at acupuncture points, in response to allergens placed in an electrical
circuit. There are no RCT data to show that this method can identify atopic
from non-atopic individuals, as identiﬁed from skin prick tests.

METHACHOLINE CHALLENGE TESTING

Technique of induced sputum
• Used to investigate for infection (e.g. TB, PCP) or airway inﬂammation
• Patients rinse their mouth and clean their teeth to minimize oral contamination. Give inhaled salbutamol, to minimize bronchoconstriction
• Nebulized hypertonic (2.7–5%) saline is administered via a face mask.
Afterwards the patient expectorates sputum into a sterile pot
• If transmission of infection (e.g. TB) is likely, perform the test in a negative pressure room, with appropriate protection of staff and other
patients. Do not perform on the open ward or out-patient department
• Send sputum promptly to microbiology for staining and culture, and
direct immunoﬂuorescent testing for PCP (if indicated). Sputum for cell
counts is mixed with 0.1% dithiothreitol, diluted with saline, and then
ﬁltered and centrifuged.

Methacholine challenge testing
• Methacholine induces bronchospasm in people with hyperreactive
airways. Helpful if there is diagnostic doubt regarding the diagnosis of
asthma
• Should be performed by experienced personnel, with facilities to deal
with acute bronchospasm
• Increasing nebulized doses of methacholine are given systematically,
with the FEV1 measured after each dose
• If there is a 20% fall in FEV1, or if the highest dose of methacholine has
been given, the test is stopped
• The concentration of drug causing the 20% fall is known as the PC20
• Asthma is indicated by a PC20 < 8 mg/mL. Normal subjects have a PC20
>16 mg/mL.

Pleural biopsy

772

CHAPTER 68

Pleural biopsy

Indications for Abrams’ pleural biopsy
• Diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion
• Abrams’ biopsy is used for the diagnosis of malignant pleural disease in
many centres, although a recent randomized controlled trial has shown
that CT-guided cutting-needle biopsy has a greater sensitivity (sensitivity 87% in CT-guided biopsy group vs. 47% in Abrams’ group).

Technique
An assistant is required.
1. Discuss procedure with patient and obtain written consent
2. Insert IV cannula
3. Consider sedation (e.g. midazolam 2–5 mg IV, with oxygen saturations
monitoring)
4. Position patient sitting forward, leaning on a pillow over a table with
their arms folded in front of them
5. Double-check correct side from chest examination and CXR
6. Choose biopsy site: 1–2 intercostal spaces below upper level of effusion on percussion. Use posterior or lateral approach (although avoid
very posterior approaches close to spine, as intercostal artery drops
medially to lie in mid-intercostal space)
7. Sterile skin preparation. Wear sterile gloves and gown
8. Inﬁltrate skin, intercostal muscle, and parietal pleura with 10 mL of
1% lidocaine. Aim just above the upper border of the appropriate
rib, avoiding the neurovascular bundle that runs below each rib.
Anaesthetize area behind rib below the insertion point
9. Whilst waiting for anaesthetic to work, assemble Abrams’ reverse
bevel biopsy needle. The needle consists of an outer sheath with a
triangular opening (biopsy port) that can be opened or closed by
rotating an inner sheath
10. Verify that the insertion site is correct by aspirating pleural ﬂuid with
a green (21G) needle. If unable to aspirate ﬂuid, do not proceed
11. Make small (5 mm) skin incision; dissect intercostal muscles with
blunt forceps (e.g. Spencer–Wells)
12. Insert biopsy needle gently with biopsy port closed. Do not apply
force; the needle should slip into the pleural space without resistance.
When in the pleural cavity, ﬂuid can be withdrawn by attaching a
syringe to the needle and opening the biopsy port
13. To take a biopsy, attach a syringe to the needle. Open the biopsy port
and angle it downwards, and then pull the biopsy port ﬁrmly against
the parietal pleura on the rib beneath the entry point (6 o’clock position relative to entry point). Close the biopsy port, thereby pulling a
sample of parietal pleura into the needle
14. Remove the biopsy needle, open the biopsy port, and remove biopsy
sample
15. Repeat procedure 4–6 times in positions 4–8 o’clock, always sampling
below the insertion point (to avoid the neurovascular bundle beneath
the rib above)
16. Send biopsy samples in saline for analysis for tuberculosis and in formalin if malignancy is suspected

PLEURAL BIOPSY

17. Apply dressing to biopsy site. May require a single stitch
18. CXR to exclude pneumothorax.

Complications include pain, pneumothorax, haemothorax, and
empyema. Haemorrhage from trauma to an intercostal artery may necessitate emergency thoracotomy. Fatalities are well documented, but rare.

Pleurodesis
Chemical pleurodesis 776

775

776

CHAPTER 69

Pleurodesis

The aim of pleurodesis is to seal the visceral pleura to the parietal pleura
with adhesions to prevent pleural ﬂuid or air accumulating. Successful
pleurodesis is dependent upon two factors.
• Lung re-expansion following removal of pleural ﬂuid or air, which
allows the apposition of visceral and parietal pleura. This may be
encouraged by applying suction to an intercostal drain
• Inﬂammation of the pleural surfaces, which is required to produce
pleural ﬁbrosis and adhesions. This may be induced by a chemical sclerosing agent or by pleural abrasion at thoracoscopy.

Indications
• Recurrent and symptomatic pleural effusion (most commonly as a
result of malignancy, although pleurodesis is also rarely used in benign
recurrent effusions)
• Recurrent pneumothorax (due to concerns regarding the long-term
safety of intrapleural talc, surgical abrasion pleurodesis is usually the
procedure of choice in younger patients; chemical pleurodesis may be
used as a last resort in older patients who are unﬁt for surgery).

Chemical pleurodesis
Types of sclerosant Choice of sclerosing agents varies. The most commonly used agents are sterile talc, tetracycline, and bleomycin.
• Talc is the most effective (success rate about 90%), and can be administered either as a slurry via a chest drain or as a poudrage at thoracoscopy, but it carries a risk of inducing ARDS (see later)
• Tetracycline is successful in about 65% cases
• Bleomycin has success rates of only 60%, and is expensive.
Other rarely used agents include doxycycline, minocycline, interferon,
interleukins, cisplatin, or the patient’s own blood.
Corticosteroids may increase the failure rate of pleurodesis by inhibiting
the pleural inﬂammatory response and development of adhesions, and
should be discontinued beforehand. The effect of NSAIDs on the success
of pleurodesis is unclear.

Technique Most centres will have a written pleurodesis protocol,
usually involving premedication and intrapleural local anaesthesia. A typical
protocol is set out below.
1. Discuss procedure with patient and obtain written consent
2. Insert chest drain (p 760): small bore (10–14F) chest tubes are sufﬁcient for ﬂuid drainage and pleurodesis, and are more comfortable
than larger drains. Flush drain with 20 mL normal saline 6-hourly
3. Commence heparin 5000 IU bd as prophylaxis against thromboembolism (increased risk following pleurodesis, especially in patients with
malignancy)
4. Drain ﬂuid in a controlled manner. There is a small risk of re-expansion
pulmonary oedema if large effusions are drained too quickly; control
output by clamping drain; aim to drain a maximum of 1 L/h

CHEMICAL PLEURODESIS

5. CXR when drain output slows (<150 mL/day):
• Consider pleurodesis if ﬂuid removed and lung fully or partially
expanded on CXR (although success rates are much lower in the
setting of an incompletely expanded lung)
• Consider trial of suction if lung only partially re-expanded. Aim to
gradually increase pressure to –20 cmH2O. Use of suction may be
limited by pain.
For pleurodesis
6. Insert IV cannula and attach pulse oximeter
7. Pleurodesis is often extremely painful. Consider premedication with
opioid (diamorphine 2.5 mg IV), anti-emetic (metoclopramide 10 mg),
and benzodiazepine (midazolam 1–2 mg IV, titrate to conscious level;
care in elderly and in patients with respiratory failure). The patient
should be comfortable, but cooperative
8. Administer intrapleural local anaesthetic (e.g. lidocaine 3 mg/kg,
maximum 250 mg) via the chest drain, as intrapleural administration
of sclerosants is frequently painful. Clamp drain and wait several
minutes
9. Administer sterile talc slurry (4 g talc in 30 mL normal saline)
10. Flush drain with 20 mL saline
11. Further analgesia if required
12. Clamp drain for 1 h after administration of sclerosant. Then unclamp
drain and consider applying suction, –20 cmH2O. Restart drain ﬂushes
13. Monitor pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, and
oxygen saturations half-hourly for 2 h and then 6-hourly
14. Analgesia and antipyretics as required
15. Optimal duration of drainage following pleurodesis is unknown; consider drain removal within 12–72 h if there is adequate drainage of
ﬂuid and lung expansion on CXR. Can usually remove tube at 48 h
16. In cases of mesothelioma arrange prophylactic radiotherapy for
the drain site (total of 21 Gy in 3 fractions over 1 week). Malignant
seeding at drain sites in non-mesothelioma malignant effusions is
uncommon and prophylactic radiotherapy is not required.

Complications All sclerosants may cause chest pain and fever as sideeffects. Use of sterile talc may rarely (<1%) result in respiratory failure due
to adult respiratory distress syndrome, manifest as hypoxia and diffuse
pulmonary inﬁltrates within 48 h of pleurodesis. The risk appears to be
reduced with lower talc doses (<5 g). ‘Mixed’ talc (containing small particles) appears to be associated with greater systemic inﬂammation and
greater deterioration in gas exchange than ‘graded’ talc (which has small
particles removed), so routine use of graded talc is now recommended.
Future developments are likely to focus on more effective and safer
sclerosing agents for pleurodesis, for example, transforming growth factor-B,
which has been demonstrated to produce an effective pleurodesis in rabbits.

CHAPTER 70

Pneumothorax aspiration

Indications
• Primary pneumothorax Consider aspiration if patient breathless and/or
pneumothorax large (rim of air >2 cm on CXR)
• Secondary pneumothorax Consider aspiration if patient aged
<50 years, with small pneumothorax (rim of air <2 cm on CXR) and
minimal breathlessness.

Technique Refer to pp 380–1 for treatment algorithms.
1. Discuss procedure with patient and obtain written consent (unless
emergency situation)
2. Insert IV cannula
3. Position patient sitting upright, supported on pillows
4. Double-check correct side from chest examination and CXR
5. Choose aspiration site: second intercostal space in mid-clavicular line
on side of pneumothorax
6. Inﬁltrate skin, intercostal muscle, and parietal pleura with 10 mL of
1% lidocaine. Aim just above the upper border of the appropriate rib,
avoiding the neurovascular bundle that runs below each rib. Parietal
pleura is extremely sensitive; use the full 10 mL of lidocaine
7. Sterile skin preparation. Wear sterile gloves and gown
8. Whilst waiting for anaesthetic to work, connect 50 mL syringe to 3way tap, with tap turned ‘off’ to patient
9. Conﬁrm presence of pneumothorax by aspirating air with green
(21G) needle
10. Insert large bore (e.g. 16G) cannula over upper border of rib.
Remove inner needle, quickly connect cannula to three-way tap and
50 mL syringe
11. Aspirate 50 mL air with syringe, turn tap and expel air into atmosphere. Repeat until resistance felt, or 2.5 L of air aspirated (aspiration
of >2.5 L suggests a large air leak, and aspiration is likely to fail). Halt
procedure if painful or patient coughing excessively.
12. Remove cannula; cover insertion site with dressing
13. Repeat CXR. Ideal timing of CXR following aspiration is unknown; it
may be advisable to wait several hours before performing the CXR in
order to detect slow air leaks
14. Aspiration is successful if lung is fully re-expanded on CXR
15. If initial aspiration of a primary pneumothorax fails, repeat aspiration
should be considered (unless ≥2.5 L has already been aspirated). At
least one-third of patients will respond to a second aspiration.

CHAPTER 71

Thoracentesis

Thoracentesis (‘pleural tap’, or pleural ﬂuid aspiration) may be diagnostic
or therapeutic.

Diagnostic thoracentesis
Indication Undiagnosed pleural effusion.
There are no absolute contraindications to pleural aspiration, although
care should be taken if the patient is anticoagulated.

Technique
1. Explain procedure to patient
2. Position patient sitting forward, leaning on a pillow over a table with
their arms folded in front of them
3. Double-check correct side from chest examination and CXR
4. Choose aspiration site 1–2 intercostal spaces below upper level of
effusion on percussion. Use posterior or lateral approach (although
avoid very posterior approaches close to spine, as intercostal artery
drops medially to lie in the mid-intercostal space)
5. Sterile skin preparation and aseptic technique
6. Inﬁltrate skin, intercostal muscle, and parietal pleura with 10 mL of
1% lidocaine. Aim just above the upper border of the appropriate rib,
avoiding the neurovascular bundle that runs below each rib. The parietal pleura is extremely sensitive; use the full 10 mL of lidocaine
7. Aspirate pleural ﬂuid with a green (21G) needle and 50 mL syringe
8. Following diagnostic tap:
• Note pleural ﬂuid appearance
• Send sample in sterile pot to biochemistry for measurement of
protein and LDH
• Send a fresh 20 mL sample in sterile pot to cytology for examination
for malignant cells and differential cell count. Use of a 3.8% sodium
citrate tube may help preserve cells in cytology samples
• Send samples in sterile pot and blood culture bottles to microbiology
for Gram stain and microscopy, culture, and AFB stain and culture
• Process non-purulent heparinized samples in arterial blood gas
analyser for pH (consult biochemistry laboratory for local policy of
pH analysis beforehand; never put purulent samples in the arterial
blood analyser)
• Consider measurement of cholesterol and triglycerides, haematocrit, glucose (with paired blood sample), and amylase, depending on
the clinical circumstances
9. There is no need for a routine CXR following aspiration
If unable to aspirate ﬂuid, further attempts should be made with ultrasound guidance. Ultrasound guidance may also be required for small or
loculated effusions, or to distinguish ﬂuid from pleural thickening.

THERAPEUTIC THORACENTESIS

If mesothelioma is likely, ‘tattoo’ the aspiration site with India ink (to guide
prophylactic radiotherapy; pierce skin through ink) and perform aspiration
in mid-axillary line 6th–7th intercostal space (corresponding to the site of
thoracoscopy port, to minimize area of radiotherapy required).
Complications of thoracentesis include pneumothorax, cough, bleeding,
empyema, spleen or liver puncture, and malignant seeding down aspiration
site (particularly in mesothelioma).

Therapeutic thoracentesis
Indication Symptomatic relief of breathlessness due to a pleural effusion,
most commonly due to malignancy.
Technique In many cases, can be performed as a day-case procedure.
1. The initial procedure is identical to that of diagnostic thoracentesis
(steps 1–7 opposite). It is important to verify that the insertion site is
correct by ﬁrst aspirating pleural ﬂuid with a green (21G) needle. If
unable to aspirate ﬂuid, abort the procedure and ultrasound the chest
to check the presence and location of ﬂuid
2. Carefully advance a large bore intravenous cannula along the anaesthetized track
3. Remove the inner needle and attach the cannula to a 3-way tap
4. Aspirate ﬂuid from the chest with a 50 mL syringe via the 3-way
tap, and ﬂush the ﬂuid into a pot through extension tubing. Drain a
maximum of 1.5 L of ﬂuid in one sitting (risk of re-expansion pulmonary oedema following sudden removal of very large volumes). Stop
the procedure if resistance is felt, or the patient experiences discomfort or severe coughing
5. Apply dressing to aspiration site
6. Repeat CXR to document extent of improvement in effusion size and
to exclude pneumothorax or trapped lung

Thoracoscopy (medical)

CHAPTER 72

Thoracoscopy (medical)

Thoracoscopy is the procedure of examining the chest wall, parietal
pleura, visceral pleura, and diaphragm with a thoracoscope and taking
biopsies. Chemical pleurodesis can also be performed. Performed by chest
physicians using sedation and local anaesthetic.
There needs to be an adequate space into which the thoracoscope is
inserted without damaging the underlying lung. Patients suitable for thoracoscopy are therefore those who have an underlying pleural effusion or a
pneumothorax, where the lung is away from the instrument insertion site.

Indications for thoracoscopy
• Undiagnosed pleural effusion—usually an exudate (diagnostic sensitivity
of medical thoracoscopy is 95%)
• Suspected mesothelioma
• Staging of pleural effusion in lung cancer
• Treatment of recurrent pleural effusions with pleurodesis
• Pneumothorax requiring chemical pleurodesis, as an alternative to
surgery, e.g. the patient unﬁt for surgical thoracoscopy.

Contraindications/proceed with caution
•
•
•
•
•
•

Obliterated pleural space
Pleural adhesions, as these may tear when pneumothorax is induced
Bleeding disorder
Hypoxia <92% on air
Unstable cardiovascular disease
Persistent uncontrollable cough.

Risks associated with thoracoscopy
Mortality rates are low (<0.01% of cases)
• Haemorrhage—may need diathermy in the pleural space. Rare
• Pulmonary perforations. Rare
• Air or gas embolism during pneumothorax induction. Rare <0.1%
• Local wound infection
• Empyema
• Fever, ARDS with talc poudrage (see p 777).

Preparation of patient and consent
• Patient should have written information >24 h before the procedure.
Written consent taken by doctor performing procedure
• Check recent CXR and any CT scans available
• Check FBC, coagulation, U&E
• Send blood for group and save
• Nil by mouth for 4 h pre-procedure
• IV cannula in arm on the same side as the thoracoscopy to make
repeated sedative administration during the procedure easy
• Premedication with analgesia, such as a single dose of oral ibuprofen
800 mg, 1–2 h before. Also antibiotics, such as cefuroxime 1.5 g IV, for
infection prophylaxis
• Baseline oxygen saturations, pulse, BP, temperature. Measure oximetry
throughout.

THORACOSCOPY (MEDICAL)

Procedure The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position, with
the side of the pleural effusion uppermost. Sedation is administered and
allowed time to work. Oxygen (2–4 L/min) is administered via nasal cannulae. The skin is cleaned and local anaesthetic inserted, in the same way
as for a chest drain. The aspiration of ﬂuid or air from the pleural space
conﬁrms it is safe to proceed to thoracoscopy. An incision is made and
blunt dissection performed through the parietal pleura. The thoracoscope
port is then inserted. The pleural effusion is drained via a suction tube
through the thoracoscope port. Air is allowed to enter the pleural space
through this port so the lung does not re-inﬂate, and effectively a pneumothorax is created. The thoracoscope, with its light source, can then be
inserted through the port and the chest cavity inspected. A second smaller
incision allows forceps or other instruments to be inserted and biopsies
taken.
Thoracoscopic biopsies are usually large and yield good diagnostic
results. If the pleural surfaces have appearances consistent with malignancy, pleurodesis can be performed at the end of the procedure, using
talc inserted via an insufﬂator. There is no evidence that pleurodesis performed at thoracoscopy is more efﬁcacious than pleurodesis performed
via chest tube, but it may save the patient having a further procedure.
Post thoracoscopy care
• Monitor oxygen saturations, pulse, blood pressure, and temperature
• The patient will have a chest drain in situ. This should be on free
drainage initially, but continuous suction is required when the drain
stops bubbling
• Analgesia as required, such as IV diamorphine 2.5 mg, dihydrocodeine
30–60 mg PO, paracetamol 1 g
• DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin (increased coagulopathy
with talc pleurodesis)
• Mobile CXR on the morning after thoracoscopy
• Remove chest drain when the lung is re-inﬂated on CXR with minimal
ﬂuid or air drainage. Trapped lung occurs if the visceral pleura is too
thick to allow lung re-inﬂation (see p 350)
• If mesothelioma is diagnosed, refer for radiotherapy to thoracoscopy
and chest drain tract sites.

APPENDIX 1

Blood gases and acid–base balance

Interpretation of arterial blood gases: 1
Normal ranges
Breathing air: PaO2 > 12 kPa (>10 in normal elderly), PaCO2 4.6–5.9.

How to take
• Arterial blood gases Best taken from radial, rather than brachial,
artery due to dual radial/ulnar supply to hand. Use a heparinized
syringe, analyse immediately, or within 30 min if kept on ice.
Always record date, time and the % inspired O2
• Arterialized capillary sample An under-used technique. Uses small glass
pre-heparinized tube to draw up blood from a puncture on the end
of the ear lobe. Blood gas machine must take microsamples (most do).
PaCO2 levels are accurate enough for clinical practice, but good arterialization, with rubefacients (Algipan/Deep Heat) or heat and vigorous
rubbing, required for accurate PaO2: the latter is less important as
oxygenation can be assessed by oximetry. Can easily be performed by
nursing staff, to monitor response to NIV and O2 therapy.
The three main things blood gases tell you about gas exchange
• How much is the patient ventilating their alveoli? This is derived from
the PaCO2. PaCO2 ≥ 6 kPa = underventilating, PaCO2 ≤ 4.5 kPa =
over-ventilating
• Is the PaO2 high enough to adequately oxygenate tissues and prevent
anaerobic metabolism? PaO2 > 6 kPa (SaO2 ≈ 80%) is probably
adequate; PaO2 > 7 kPa (SaO2 > 87%) is deﬁnitely adequate
• Is there evidence of V/Q mismatch? Evidence of low V/Q units is
derived from the calculated alveolar to arterial (A–a) O2 gradient
The two main things blood gases tell you about acid/base balance
(see later section on acid–base balance)
• What is the respiratory component to an abnormal pH? This is derived
from the PaCO2
• What is the metabolic component to an abnormal pH? This is derived
from the standard base excess/deﬁcit.

The A–a gradient calculator graph sets out the graphical
representation of gas exchange
• Point ➊ = pO2 and pCO2 (virtually zero) of inspired air (atmospheric
pressure ≈ 100 kPa, air is 21% O2, and air is slightly ‘diluted’ by water
vapour pressure (7 kPa) following humidiﬁcation by upper airways).
21% of 100–7 = 20 kPa. (Point ➋ = pO2 and pCO2 when breathing
24% O2 via a Ventimask and point ➌ = pO2 and pCO2 when breathing
28% O2 via a Ventimask)
• Point➍ = theoretical pO2/pCO2 of inspired gas when breathing air, if all
the O2 removed and replaced by CO2 (equivalent to extreme hypoventilation and impossible!), when the respiratory quotient (RQ = CO2
produced/O2 consumed) is 0.8 (usual value)
• The line between ➊ and ➍with a gradient of 0.8 describes all possible
combinations of alveolar gas, moving towards ➊ if breathing more, and
towards ➍if breathing less, called the alveolar air line.

INTERPRETATION OF ARTERIAL BLOOD GASES: 1

• Point ➎ = area in which PaO2 and PaCO2 of arterial blood sit normally.
If lungs are perfect gas exchangers, then blood leaving the lungs
and entering systemic arterial circulation (➎) should be perfectly equilibrated with the alveolar gas (A).

Fig. A1.1 pCO2 vs pO2: alveolar air lines and A–a gradient calculator.

• Point ➏ = However, the mixed venous point (or the pulmonary arterial
blood) is well to the left of the alveolar air line. This is because capillary PO2 falls more kPa than the PCO2 rises during gas exchange in the
tissues (CO2 solubility curve is steeper than PaO2–SaO2 dissociation
curve).
• Thus, if the lungs fail to oxygenate mixed venous blood properly (e.g.
area of consolidation, or low V/Q due to asthma/COPD) then it is as if
mixed venous blood has bypassed the lung and leaked into the arterial
blood, which therefore moves the eventual arterial PaO2/PaCO2 point
to the left of the alveolar air line, point ➐

793

APPENDIX 1

Blood gases and acid–base balance

Interpretation of arterial
blood gases: 2
• The horizontal distance between the actual arterial point and the ‘ideal’
alveolar air line is called the alveolar to arterial (A–a) gradient and
is a measure of how efﬁciently mixed venous blood is equilibrated with
alveolar gas, i.e. it is a measure of V/Q mismatch, right-to-left shunts,
and very severe lung ﬁbrosis through reduced diffusion across the
alveolar-capillary membrane. As well as being read off the graph it can
be mathematically calculated as shown in Fig. A1.2.

Inspired PO2
Respiratory quotient
Fig. A1.2 Calculation of inspired PO2 breathing air or 24/28% O2:
Air, 21% of (100–7) ≈ 20 kPa (where 100 kPa is atmospheric pressure and 7 kPa
is water vapour pressure due to the inspired air being humidiﬁed); 24%, 24% of
(100–7) ≈23 kPa; 28%, 28% of (100–7) ≈26 kPa

In Fig. A1.1 the alveolar air line depends on the % inspired O2, and the two
extra lines, for 24% and 28% O2, are shown. In the calculation the PIO2 has
to be adjusted accordingly, (see Figure A1.2).
In normal lungs matching of V/Q is not totally perfect due to relative
under-perfusion of the apices and over-perfusion of the bases (gravity
effects on pulmonary arterial blood ﬂow, not fully compensated for by
hypoxic vasoconstriction of pulmonary arterioles). These imperfections in
V/Q, and direct drainage of some of the cardiac muscle venous blood into
the left ventricular cavity and thus systemic arterial circulation, lead to a
small A–a gradient, 1–2 kPa in the young and middle aged, and 2–3 kPa in
the elderly. Figures in excess of these values are abnormal and indicate
areas of low V/Q or increased shunt.

APPENDIX 1

Blood gases and acid–base balance

Use of A–a gradient diagram:
examples
Case 1 Consider point W in the pO2–pCO2 graph (Fig. A1.3), the blood
gases on air of a young non-smoker complaining of chest pain 7 days postoperatively. The PaO2 of 13 is normal. Does this reassure you or does it
provide supporting evidence for a pulmonary embolus? Ask the following
questions
• How much is the patient ventilating? PaCO2 = 2; therefore ≤4.5 kPa
and indicates hyperventilation
• Is the patient adequately oxygenated? PaO2 >7 kPa; therefore, OK
• Is there an abnormal A–a gradient? Read off graph, horizontal line
between W and alveolar line, or calculate:
20 – [13 + (2/0.8)] = 4.5 kPa
>2 kPa, hence yes; therefore the V/Q matching is not normal.
This provides supporting evidence for a pulmonary embolus, but could
just as well be due to consolidation from pneumonia, for example
• Remember, PaO2 cannot be used to assess V/Q matching in the lung
without an associated PaCO2 to tell you ‘what the PaO2 ought to be’.

Case 2 Consider point X on the pO2–pCO2 graph. These are the gases
on air from a young man following an overdose of methadone tablets.
• How much is the patient ventilating? PaCO2 = 11; therefore ≥6 kPa and
indicates hypoventilation
• Is the patient adequately oxygenated? PaO2 only 6 kPa; therefore not
enough and needs extra O2
• Has the patient got an A–a gradient?
20 – [6 + (11/0.8)] = 0.8 kPa
<2 kPa, hence no; therefore there is nothing wrong with the lungs, despite
the abnormal gases, this represents pure hypoventilation.
After a messy stomach wash-out he is sent to the ward and 24 h later is
febrile. Gases on 24% O2 are point Y on the graph; thus both PaCO2 and
PaO2 are better.
• How much is the patient ventilating? PaCO2 just ≥6 kPa; therefore is
still hypoventilating a bit
• Is the patient adequately oxygenated? PaO2 >7 kPa; therefore adequately oxygenated
• Has the patient got an A–a gradient?
23 – [11 + (6.5/0.8)] = 4.2 kPa
(remember, the PIO2 is 23 because he is on 24% O2)
>2 kPa hence, yes; therefore may have developed an aspiration pneumonia.

USE OF A–A GRADIENT DIAGRAM: EXAMPLES

Three things blood gases tell you about gas exchange
• How much is the patient ventilating their alveoli?—PaCO2
• Is the PaO2 high enough to adequately oxygenate tissues and thus
prevent anaerobic metabolism?
• Is there any evidence of a V/Q mismatch, assessed from the alveolar–
arterial (A–a) gradient for oxygen?

APPENDIX 1

Blood gases and acid–base balance

Acid–base balance
Normal ranges
pH 7.37–7.43 (H+ 37–43 nmol/L), PaCO2 4.7–5.9, base excess ±3 mmol/L.

Interpretation Acid–base relationships are best plotted as a PaCO2 vs.
pH graph, because these are the two primary measurements made by a
blood gas machine (everything else to do with acid–base balance is calculated). This is shown opposite.
Normal acid–base is the area labelled N, the pH between 7.37 and
7.43, the PaCO2 around 5 kPa. As ventilation is decreased or increased
(PaCO2 going up or down, respectively), the pH will change, the amount
depending on the buffering capacity of the blood (CO2 is an acid gas, combining with water to give [H+] and [HCO3¯] ions). Without buffering, the
pH would fall disastrously following small rises in PaCO2. This buffering
capacity depends mainly on haemoglobin and other proteins, producing
the normal buffer line running through N on the graph.
Therefore, acute hypoventilation and hyperventilation will move
the patient up and down this line, in the direction b or c, respectively. If
the hypoventilation at point b comes chronic (e.g. as it may in COPD),
then the kidney retains bicarbonate (by excreting hydrogen ions) to try
and correct the pH towards normal, and the patient moves onto a new iso
[HCO3¯] buffer line displaced to the right, e.g. the one labelled + 10 meq/L
(35 meq/L). The degree of displacement represents the metabolic component to the acid–base status, and in this case, because the [HCO3¯]
has risen, will be higher than the normal ﬁgure of about 25 meq/L. When
the raised ﬁgure is quoted relative to the normal 25 meq/L (by subtracting
25), this is called the base excess. Thus, buffer lines to the right of the
normal buffer line represent a metabolic alkalosis or base excess.
These ﬁgures are calculated assuming a normal or ‘standard’ PaCO2,
called the ‘standard bicarbonate’ (SBC on the blood gas machine printout),
or ‘standard base excess’ (usually BE). The other similar ﬁgures on some
printouts (usually HCO–3 and TCO2) are calculated at the patient’s actual
PaCO2 and are not much use.
Chronic hyperventilation (e.g. at altitude due to the hypoxia) produces
the opposite, a resorption of [H+] by the kidney, and the buffer line shifts
to the left giving a negative value for the ‘base excess’, a base deﬁcit. Thus,
a metabolic acidosis compensates for a respiratory alkalosis. Note that
these corrections rarely bring the pH back to normal as there needs to be
an error signal to keep the correction process going.
A metabolic acidosis (such as in ketoacidosis) will also move the line to
the left (a), producing a base deﬁcit (or negative base excess), followed by
hyperventilation to try and correct it (i.e. a respiratory alkalosis to correct
a metabolic acidosis). This pure ventilatory stimulation in the absence of
abnormal lungs often produces deep breathing with little increase in rate
and is called Kussmaul’s breathing. Thus, lines to the left of the normal
buffer line represent a metabolic acidosis or base deﬁcit. A metabolic
acidosis due to anaerobic metabolism (and hence lactic acid production)
can reverse the compensatory metabolic alkalosis secondary to chronic
hypercapnia during a severely hypoxic COPD exacerbation, removing the
evidence for chronic CO2 retention.

ACID–BASE BALANCE

Finally, a metabolic alkalosis, e.g. during hypokalaemia (when the kidney
is forced to use hydrogen ions instead of potassium ions to swap for the
sodium that needs resorbing from the tubular ﬂuid) moves the buffer line
to the right (d), but with only limited hypoventilation available to compensate, due to the inevitable ventilatory stimulation the attendant hypoxaemia produces.
Thus, the mixture of respiratory and metabolic contributions to a
patient’s acid–base disturbance can be established by plotting the PaCO2
and pH on the graph.

APPENDIX 1

Blood gases and acid–base balance

Anion gap
The anion gap [(Na+ + K+)–(Cl¯ + HCO3¯)] shows the amount of other
anions, apart from Cl¯ + HCO3¯, that exist, and helps differentiate the
cause of any metabolic acidosis. Depending on methods of measurement,
the normal value is between 8 and 16 mmol/L (or meq/L) and mainly due
to albumin. High anion gap indicates loss of HCO3¯ without a subsequent
increase in Cl¯. Electroneutrality is maintained by increase in anions such
as ketones, lactate, PO4¯, and SO4¯. Because these anions are not part of
the anion-gap calculation, a high anion gap results.
An acidosis with a normal anion gap will be a simple HCO3¯/Cl¯
exchange such as might occur, for example, in:
• Renal tubular acidosis
• Acetazolamide therapy
• HCO3¯ loss from profuse diarrhoea.
An anion gap is likely to be present, for example, when the metabolic
acidosis is due to:
• Diabetic, starvation, or alcohol induced ketoacidosis (ketones are acids)
• Renal failure (although can be in the normal range too)
• Lactic acidosis
• Salicylate poisoning
• Methanol poisoning
• Ethylene glycol (anti-freeze) poisoning.

Three things arterial samples tell you about acid–base
balance
• Is there a ventilatory/respiratory contribution from an abnormally
high or low PaCO2?
• Is there a metabolic component evidenced by a shift of the buffer line
to the left or right, numerically the base excess (or deﬁcit)?
• If there is an acidosis, is there an increased anion gap?

A fall in pH (more acidotic), or a rise in body temperature, will move
the dissociation curve to the right. This has the effect of making the PaO2
higher for any given SaO2, e.g. at pH 7.20 a measured saturation (e.g.
by oximetry) of 90% is equivalent to a higher PaO2 of 9.7 kPa (73 mmHg)
than the usual 7.7 kPa (58 mmHg): a rise in body temperature to 41°C will
do the same, and the effects of pH and temperature are additive.
Conversely, for a given PaO2, pyrexia and acidosis will lower the SaO2
and thus oxygen carriage to the tissues. A PaO2 of 7.7 kPa (58 mmHg) will
normally give a SaO2 of 90%, but if the temperature rises to 41°C, and pH
falls to 7.20, then the SaO2 falls to 70%. Increasing 2,3-DPG levels shift the
curve to the right, but levels ﬂuctuate unpredictably and any changes are
small.
Changes in body temperature are often the reason why measured pulse
oximetry saturations apparently ‘do not agree’ with the measured blood
gases (pH is taken into account in the theoretical calculation of SaO2 by
blood gas analysers, but the patient’s correct body temperature is rarely
entered and thus not taken into account). This is particularly important
in hypothermia when the curve is left shifted leading to impaired oxygen
unloading anyway. Furthermore, an apparently adequate oximetry reading
can mask a low PaO2, which will further lessen oxygen availability to the
tissues (although somewhat mitigated by the reduced metabolic rate of
hypothermic tissues).

APPENDIX 5

Lung function testing

Flow–volume loop 1
A good starting point to the understanding of lung function tests is the
ﬂow–volume loop. This plots inspiratory and expiratory ﬂow against lung
volume during a maximal expiratory and maximal inspiratory manoeuvre.

TLC

Inspiratory
flow
Fig. A5.1 Flow–volume loop.

At the beginning of expiration from a full breath in, the expiratory muscles
are at their strongest, the lungs at their largest, and hence the airways are
at their most open (A). Because the lungs are at their largest, the radial
attachments to the airways, effectively the alveolar/capillary membranes
and their connective tissue, are pulling the hardest and supporting the
airways against dynamic compression during the exhalation manoeuvre.
This means that the highest ﬂow rates are possible at the beginning of
the blow; hence, the sudden rise to a peak expiratory ﬂow rate in the ﬁrst
100 ms or so of the forced breath out (B). This is the peak ﬂow and is
essentially what a peak ﬂow meter measures.
As the lung empties and the lung volume drops, the dilatory pull on
the airways from the radial attachments of the surrounding lung tissue
reduces (C). Hence the airways narrow and become less supported, and
are less able to resist dynamic compression. This means that the maximal
airﬂow obtainable, regardless of effort, falls too.
Eventually, the expiratory muscles come to the end of their ‘travel’ and
cannot squeeze the chest anymore. Also, increasingly with age, the small
airways may actually close off, preventing anymore emptying (D). The
volume at which this begins to happen is called the closing volume.
As maximal inspiration starts, although the inspiratory muscles are at
their strongest, the airways are at their smallest. Thus, ﬂow rates start
low and increase as the airways open up. However, as the lung expands
the inspiratory muscles are approaching the end of their ‘travel’ and
are weakening; this means the ﬂow rates fall again, hence the different,
rounded appearance of the inspiratory limb of the ﬂow–volume curve.
Thus, normally the inspiratory and expiratory ﬂow rates depend on
lung volume and are termed ‘volume-dependent’. If there is a ﬁxed upper
airway narrowing, such as from a solid hard tumour partially blocking the
trachea, then the size of the airway at this point may become so narrow
that it now limits maximal ﬂows. However, its diameter will vary very little
with lung volumes and hence ﬂow will become ‘volume-independent’.
Figure A5.2 shows this.

FLOW–VOLUME LOOP 1

Expiration

D

A

E
Inspiration

Fig. A5.2 Volume-independent ﬂow.

At A, the rise in ﬂow will initially be normal, but at some point the
maximum ﬂow imposed by the upper airway narrowing will cut in (B).
From that point onwards the ﬂow rate will be ﬁxed at this maximum (C)
until at much lower lung volumes the lower recoil and narrowing small
airways again determine the maximum ﬂow (D). The ﬂow–volume curve
has been severely ‘clipped’ with a squarish appearance. The same clipped
appearance will be present on the inspiratory limb (E), giving rise to the
so-called ‘square box’ appearance.
Sometimes, such upper airways restriction may be variable, rather than
ﬁxed, and only obstruct during inspiration (e.g. paralysed and collapsing
vocal cords) due to the obstructing elements being sucked in, and then
blown open again on expiration.
• Thus, a square inspiratory limb, but normal expiratory limb, provides
evidence of a mobile extrathoracic upper airways obstruction.
Conversely, a mobile intrathoracic upper airway obstruction (e.g. soft
ﬂeshy tumour at the carina, or retrosternal thyroid) may obstruct more
during expiration (when the expiratory effort is compressing the lung),
compared with inspiration when the chest is being expanded.
• Thus, a square expiratory limb, but normal inspiratory limb, is evidence
of a variable intrathoracic upper airways obstruction.
Sometimes ratios of maximal inspiratory to maximal expiratory ﬂows are
used to characterize intra- or extrathoracic airway obstruction.

829

830

APPENDIX 5

Lung function testing

Flow–volume loop 2
The other, more common, causes of airway obstruction are due to narrowing of the lower airways (asthma, COPD). In these conditions the
airway calibre (and thus ﬂow rates) still remains dependent on lung
volume. Hence, the ﬂow rates decrease as the lung volume decreases,
but particularly so at low lung volumes. This is because resistance to
ﬂow is proportional to the airway radius raised to the power of 4 (r4)
and therefore most signiﬁcant when airways are already small. Hence,
increasing airﬂow obstruction produces expiratory ﬂow–volume curves
like those in Figure A5.3. This greater effect of small airways narrowing at
low lung volumes has led some units to report ﬂow rates at, for example,
25% expired lung volume, or averaged between 25% and 75% of the total
expired lung volume.

Expiration

RV
A

Fig. A5.3 Expiratory ﬂow volume curves–lower airways obstruction.

Airways can be so small so that during expiration they begin closing off
earlier than normal (the closing volume); hence a full breath out is not
possible, producing air trapping and a raised residual volume (RV) (A).
Sensitive tests of small airways narrowing have to concentrate on ﬂows at
low lung volumes, and peak ﬂow measurements are relatively insensitive.
• Note, however, that peak ﬂow measurements are the most sensitive to
upper airway narrowing and a good way to follow changes in upper
airway narrowing during, for example, radiotherapy for a central airway
obstructing lung cancer.

SPIROMETRY, PEAK FLOW MEASUREMENTS, AND CO TRANSFER

Spirometry, peak ﬂow measurements,
and CO transfer
• The ordinary spirometer (mechanical or electronic) records volumes
against time, rather than ﬂows against volume
• The two essential measures are FEV1 and VC.
The vital capacity (VC) is the maximum amount of air that can be blown
out completely. This will be reduced if the lungs are stiff (preventing a full
breath in), the inspiratory muscles are weak (preventing a full breath in),
or the airways are narrowed such that the small airways collapse during
expiration (preventing a full breath out).
The FEV1 is the amount (forced expiratory volume) that can be blown
out in 1 s. Because the value is taken over a second, much more ﬂow is
being captured during the breath out than the PEFR, but it is still occurring
when the airways are larger. It is less dependent on effort and generally
more robust. The ratio of the two ﬁgures (FEV1/VC) tells us about the
degree of airﬂow obstruction.
• A ratio of FEV1/VC of less than about 70–75% indicates airﬂow
obstruction.
This ratio is very useful because it is hardly affected by age, sex, height,
ethnic origin, etc.—it is self-normalizing. The individual measures of FEV1
and VC do need corrections for the above factors and are usually quoted
as % predicted. The range of normality is considerable, and it may not be
clear if results are simply at the bottom end of normal, or considerably
reduced from the patient’s normally much higher ﬁgures. Serial measurements indicating continuing deterioration may be the ﬁrst clue. If the
FEV1/VC ratio is normal, then the VC can be interpreted as to whether
there is a reduced total lung volume, such as from interstitial lung disease.
This is called a restrictive pattern, and a low FEV1/VC ratio is called an
obstructive pattern. The FEV1/VC ratio may actually be raised in interstitial
lung disease as the airways are better supported by the ﬁbrosed radial attachments, which reduces dynamic compression, improving expiratory ﬂow.
The slope of the volume–time plot from a spirometer is effectively the
ﬂow rate at any particular point: because ﬂow is dropping during expiration
the slope progressively ﬂattens off. However, if there is any ﬁxed upper
airways obstruction (as discussed above) the expiratory ﬂow rate will be
constant for a while, and hence the spirometer line will be straighter than
usual. An interesting index to detect possible upper airway obstruction,
the Empey index, has been described:
Empey Index = [FEV1 (mL)/PEFR (L/min)]
Because PEFR is clipped ﬁrst by the presence of upper airﬂow obstruction, relative to the FEV1, the above index gets larger with such a problem.
A ﬁgure over 10 is suggestive of upper airﬂow obstruction, but it is only a
pointer, and there will be false positives and negatives.
Although one-off measures of lung function can be made, more interesting information comes from serial measurements, e.g. in asthma, PEFR
will ﬂuctuate with characteristic morning ‘dips’.

831

832

APPENDIX 5

Lung function testing

Spirometry – how to do it
Everyone has their own way to do spirometry, but this is a way that works
for the authors. Say to the patient:- ‘This is a test of how big your lungs
are, and how fast you can empty them. What I would like you to do is
take an enormous breath in, the biggest you can manage, then seal your
lips around the tube, and blow as hard and as fast and as long as you possibly can’. Then demonstrate the manoeuvre yourself with a spare tube
(not connected to the spirometer) so that they can then mimic it. Whilst
they are blowing, say ‘Excellent, well done, keep blowing, come on, come
on, come on, keep blowing’. There are various recommendations as to
numbers of blow etc. These are the arguments.
Standing or sitting?

High intrathoracic pressure generated may cause the
patient to pass out. Therefore, sitting down is safer, but
better and more consistent ﬁgures are obtained standing.
Have a chair behind patient to sit on if dizzy.

Nose clip?

Prevents escape through the nose which would give falsely
low ﬁgures, but is uncomfortable. Vast majority of patients
do not need it, but if the line appears to fall off towards the
end of the blow, or inconsistent volumes, try a nose clip.

Best of 3 blows?

Need to demonstrate that maximal blow has been
achieved, usually by seeing two identical tracings. A device
showing the actual spirometer tracing is extremely helpful.
If two tracings are identical, this is probably enough, but may
need more if blowing is erratic, until satisﬁed it is maximal.

Keep going to end
Need to establish correct VC. Therefore if line still rising,
of page (6 s) or not? then VC not reached, but have to stop somewhere. In
restrictive disease, or normals, usually maximal by 3 s; in
obstructive disease may need to do slow VC to establish
real value.
Repeat with a
sub-maximal effort?

Sometimes useful to ask patient to repeat with slightly
less effort, when emphysema suspected. Will often give
better expiratory volume in 1 s, and VC, suggesting major
dynamic airways compression.

SPIROMETRY, PEAK FLOW MEASUREMENTS, AND CO TRANSFER

Carbon monoxide (CO) transfer
Usually done in the lung function laboratory and essentially measures the
amount of gas exchanging surface area available. A gas mixture containing
CO is inhaled, the breath held for 10 s, then exhaled. The amount of CO
that has disappeared (by crossing the alveolar capillary membrane and
being taken up by red cells) is calculated. A correction for the haemoglobin
concentration is required, as the amount of CO transferred will fall as the
available haemoglobin is reduced. The total amount of CO transferred is
the TLCO (total lung, TL). When divided by the total lung volume during
the breath hold, it is called the kCO, gas transfer per unit lung volume.
The total lung volume ‘reached’ by the CO is the amount breathed in plus
the amount of air already in the lung at the start of the breath in. This is
measured by including helium in the inhaled gas mixture that is diluted by
the air already in the lung; by comparing inspired helium concentration with
expired, this total lung volume can be calculated.
• The kCO is reduced most in emphysema when alveoli have been
destroyed
• The kCO is also reduced in interstitial lung diseases where the alveolar
capillary membrane may be thick enough to reduce CO passage
• The kCO may also be raised when lungs are poorly expanded by, say,
weak respiratory muscles, because the lung is ‘more concentrated’ and
transfers CO better when quoted per unit volume
• The kCO may also be raised for a few days when there has been
profuse lung haemorrhage, as can occur in, SLE, Wegener’s, and
Goodpasture’s. This is because the free red cells lining the alveoli take
up CO directly and ‘falsely’ elevate the ﬁgure. As the haemoglobin
is broken down, the kCO returns to normal, unless there is another
bleed. This helps to distinguish re-bleeding from other causes of lung
inﬁltrates such as infection
This test requires more cooperation than simple spirometry, as well as a
minimum inspired volume, and therefore cannot always be obtained.

833

834

APPENDIX 5

Lung function testing

Respiratory muscle function, body
plethysmography, and lung volumes
Respiratory muscle function
Respiratory failure and small VCs may be due to weak respiratory
muscles. It is therefore useful to be able to assess inspiratory and expiratory muscle power. There may be global weakness, or speciﬁc inspiratory
weakness, usually due to diaphragm paralysis. In the clinic the simplest test
is a lying and standing VC. If the diaphragm is paralysed then on lying down
the abdominal contents will push up the diaphragm and limit inspiration.
On standing the abdominal contents drop and aid inspiration.
• A fall in VC of less than 10% on lying down is probably normal
• A fall of 10–20% is suspicious of diaphragm paralysis
• A fall of more than 20% is abnormal and suggests signiﬁcant, usually
bilateral, diaphragm paralysis.
In the laboratory there are various ways to test respiratory muscle function.
The patient can blow against a pressure meter after a maximum inspiration,
and inspires against the meter after a full expiration. This is, of course,
highly effort dependent. A manoeuvre such as a sniff is very stereotypic
and patients can reproduce this. Measuring the inspiratory pressure produced at the nose during this manoeuvre is a reasonably reliable way of
screening for inspiratory muscle weakness. More accurate assessments of
inspiratory muscle function, particularly the diaphragm, can be obtained
using two oesophageal balloons placed above and below the diaphragm and
connected to pressure transducers. The transdiaphragmatic pressures during
maximal inspiratory efforts, snifﬁng, and breathing to TLC all provide
reproducible measures of diaphragm function, but depend on good cooperation and effort by the patient. Activating the phrenic nerve directly
with a superﬁcial electrical stimulator, or by using high-intensity magnetic
stimulation over the nerve roots of C3–C5, provides non-effort-dependent
ways to test diaphragm function.

Body plethysmography requires the patient to climb into an airtight
cabinet and breathe through a shuttered mouthpiece connected to the
outside world. It has two particular advantages over simpler lung function
tests. It is able to measure the total lung volume or capacity (TLC) in the
thorax, and it provides a measure of airways obstruction involving little or
no effort by the patient.
The other main method of measuring TLC involves helium dilution as
described during the TLCO measurement above. However, in the presence
of lower airways obstruction, the helium may not ‘reach’ all parts of the
lung during the 10 s breath hold, and the volume of dilution will therefore
be lower than the real TLC. The body plethysmograph relies on the pressure
changes that occur when all the air in the chest is alternately compressed
and expanded by the patient making breathing efforts against an airway
closed by a shutter at the mouth. The pressure changes produced in the
oral cavity versus in the box are then proportional to the volume of air
being compressed and rareﬁed, thus allowing calculation of the volume
in the chest at the time. Note that this volume will include any bullae
and the difference between the plethysmographic lung volume and the

RESPIRATORY MUSCLE FUNCTION

helium dilution volume will reﬂect the bullae volume, as well as areas not
reached by the helium due to increased airways resistance.
Measurement of airways resistance with the body box relies on a similar
principle. If there were no airways resistance, then breathing in and out
would not compress or rarefy the air in the chest. With increasing resistance, the air in the chest will be compressed during expiration and rareﬁed
on inspiration. It is this phenomenon that allows calculation of the airways
resistance during quiet breathing or panting (the latter ensures the vocal
chords are fully open and not contributing to the measured resistance).

APPENDIX 7

Radiological investigations

Different departments/countries will use different protocols, e.g. some will always do a standard
CT as well as an HRCT in case a malignant nodule is missed.
Radiation dose estimates are fraught with many assumptions and estimates, there is signiﬁcant
uncertainty in some areas.
1 mSy in the dose of absorbed radiation produced by exposure to 1 mGy of radiation
1 mSy=100 mrad absorbed dose (mSy includes quality factor (type of radiation and nature of
tissue), but for Xrays and most tissues, mSy and mGy are numerically identical (for alpha emitters
1 mGy causes 20mSy)).
Background radiation approximately 3 mSy/year (mainly from radiation in the home, and varies
across the country); transatlantic ﬂight = extra 0.03 mSy.

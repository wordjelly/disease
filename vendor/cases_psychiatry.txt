PREFACE
Mental health problems are not confined to psychiatric services. It is now well established
that significant mental health problems occur across all disciplines, in all settings and at
all ages. Doctors need to be equipped to recognise these difficulties, treat them where
appropriate and refer on as is necessary. All doctors need the knowledge and experience
to sensitively enquire about such difficulties, to avoid the risk of problems going untreated.
This book provides clinical scenarios that allow the reader to explore the limits of their
knowledge and understanding, and inform their learning. They do not provide an
alternative to meeting real people and their families first hand, which we would
thoroughly encourage. People with psychiatric illnesses should not be a source of fear or
stigma. These scenarios provide a vehicle where students and junior doctors can build
their confidence in assessment and management. They are written in a way that
encourages the reader to ask more questions, and seek the solutions to those questions.
We hope that this book compliments and adds an additional dimension to learning.

CASE 1:

HOW CAN YOU ASSESS MENTAL STATE?

History
A 42-year-old woman comes into hospital for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The
admitting doctor has concerns about her mental state. There are concerns about whether
she is healthy enough to cope with an operation and the recovery from it. The doctor
takes a psychiatric history.
Question
• In addition to the history what assessment will give more information about this
woman’s mental health, before a decision about whether to proceed with surgery or
whether to ask a psychiatrist to see her?

1

ANSWER 1
The mental state examination is equivalent to the physical examination in medicine or
surgery, but a different system is being examined. It takes place through observation and
through probing questions designed to elicit psychopathology. It is structured and follows
a procedure. It is put together with the history and investigations. The mental state
examination contributes to the formulation, which is a summary of the mental health
problems and their relation to other aspects of life. Formulation includes a diagnosis and
may include a multi-axial diagnostic understanding (see Cases 23 and 77). Formulation
uses information from the history and mental state examination to describe the three Ps:
predisposing factors, precipitating factors and perpetuating factors. The mental state
examination includes:
Appearance: assess this woman’s appearance. Look at hygiene, clothing, hair and make
up. Do the clothes suggest any subcultural groups? Are there any signs of neglect,
perfectionism or grandiosity?
Behaviour: observe behaviour throughout. Look for evidence of rapport or empathy. Are
movements slow or rapid? Is she agitated or is there psychomotor retardation? Each may
be a possible signal for disorder. For example, the latter may be a sign of depression,
hypothyroidism or Parkinsonism. Are there invasions of personal space seen in autism
spectrum disorders, mania, schizophrenia and personality disorder? Does the person sit
still or move about? Are they calm, or impulsive and distractible? Are they monitoring
or watchful of anything and if so what? A spider phobic may be looking out for spiders;
a schizophrenic may be listening to unseen voices; a person with obsessive compulsive
disorder may be carrying out rituals in relation to the environment; a person with autism
spectrum disorder may be examining environmental detail.
Speech: assess the volume, flow, content, pitch and prosody of speech. A person with
mania may be loud, have flight of ideas, pressure of speech and use puns. A person with
schizophrenia may be ‘ununderstandable’ if they have formal thought disorder. There may
be limited speech or short answers in depression, hypothyroidism or with negative
symptoms of schizophrenia. A person with autism spectrum disorder may have little
communication or may speak only on one subject at length with poor conversational
reciprocity.
Mood: assess what this is like subjectively and objectively. How does the person describe
their mood and is it congruent with what you see and experience in the room. This will
include questions about enjoyment, worthlessness, hopelessness, suicidality and risk (see
Case 32).
Thoughts: assess content and whether there is any formal thought disorder, or evidence of
rumination or intrusive thoughts. Do thoughts race as in mania? Are they negative as in
depression? Are they resisted as in obsessive compulsive disorder? Are they interfered with
as in the thought passivity of schizophrenia (see Cases 15 and 41)? Assess beliefs such as
delusions (see Case 15) which can occur in psychosis, dementia and organic brain damage.
Perception: assess perceptual experiences by observation and questioning. Is the person
responding to the visual hallucinations of delirium tremens or organic brain disorder, or
the auditory hallucinations of schizophrenia, organic illness or psychotic depression? Are
perceptions heightened as when abusing certain drugs or dulled as when abusing other
drugs? Are there pseudohallucinations as in bereavement? Hallucinations (see Case 15)
are important markers of mental illness.
2

Cognitive function should be carefully assessed (see Case 62) and will uncover organic
disorders or the pseudodementia of depression. Do they have capacity (see Case 71)?
Finally assess insight. What are their attributions? How do they see their problems and
the need for treatment?
KEY POINTS

• Mental state examination is the equivalent of an examination of a physical system,
but is an examination of the mind.

• It is more than a history. It requires careful observation.

CASE 2:

UNTREATED DENTAL ABSCESS

History
A 34-year-old woman attends the emergency department of a hospital with a dental
abscess. She leaves while waiting for a doctor to come and see her, but returns the same
evening. When the doctor arrives she explains that she has a terror of dentists and has
not seen one since she was 8 years old. She has several memories of pain while being
given fillings. She explains that she was allowed to eat unlimited sweets as a child and
that brushing her teeth was not part of a routine established by parents. She started
brushing her teeth when she was 14 and became self-conscious of her appearance. She
remembers needing to go to the dentist when she was 16 because of a painful tooth. She
became very worried for several days, being unable to sleep well and having episodes
when she became frightened and breathless. On that occasion she repeatedly refused to
see the dentist and was given antibiotics by her GP which settled the infection. On this
occasion she has made several appointments to go to the dentist but has either cancelled
them or not gone to the appointment. She realizes that she needs treatment and she is
clearly in pain but cannot overcome her fear.
Mental state examination
When the doctor arrives she is clearly ‘on edge’ and is sweating and shaking. Her pulse
when measured is 98 beats/min and her blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg. She is vigilant
to sounds and activity around her in the department. There are no thoughts of self-harm
and she is able to enjoy herself when at home or with friends and she is not in pain. There
is no evidence or history of thought passivity or psychotic phenomena.
Questions
• What disorder has hampered this woman’s ability to receive appropriate dental
treatment?
• What can you do to help?

5

ANSWER 2
This woman has a fear of dentists. This is more than a typical and appropriate anxiety
experienced by many people, since it leads to an untreated and potentially serious and
painful condition, an abscess.

!

Definition of a phobia

•
•
•
•

Persistent fear of a situation or object
Avoidance of feared situation or object
Presence of powerful anticipatory anxiety
Insight that the fear is irrational or out of kilter with the true risk of the situation

Phobias often have some element of understandable fear such as thunderstorms, dogs,
flying, heights, needles and dentists. Many of these can be risky in some situations,
although for the most part these experiences in our society are painless and harmless. The
fear in phobia is far in excess of that ‘usually’ experienced. Some phobias are instinctive
and are programmed through natural selection. These would include fears of spiders and
snakes. Some are associative such as blood (for example, associated with images of harm
or injury). Some have none of these factors (for example, buttons, cardboard, glitter,
wooden spoons) and may be related to negative early life experiences, for example, being
beaten as a child by a wooden spoon.
The best treatment for a phobia is desensitization or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).
The latter will usually include some elements of desensitization alongside
psychoeducational strategies. Medication (such as a benzodiazepine) is not usually used
in phobias unless it is part of a short-term strategy to enable CBT to start. Desensitization
involves exposure to a hierarchy of feared situations drawn up in conjunction with the
phobic person. The list is scored for fear, and exposure with support (and sometimes
rewards) is systematically worked through. For example, this woman may look at pictures
of dentists, videos of a normal dental health check and may visit the dental surgery
without any treatment. She may take home dental masks and mouthwash. She may watch
someone else having a check and may agree to sit in the dentist’s chair and have her
mouth examined with no treatment. Imaginary desensitization involves using imagined
scenarios in the hierarchy. Relaxation, hypnotherapy and autohypnosis may all give
feelings of control to the sufferer and reduce anxiety. Clearly none of this can happen
while she has an abscess and this needs to be treated in the first instance. An X-ray may
be part of a desensitization list with treatment being performed under general anaesthetic
or with sedation. Use of sedation at this point would be to treat the abscess not the phobia
and CBT would follow successful treatment of the abscess.
In this situation, most areas have specialist dentists (community dental officers) who are
used to dealing with phobias and it will be worth arranging an appointment. A
psychologist or community mental health nurse will be able to carry out the CBT.
KEY POINTS

• A phobia can lead to marked impact on functioning.
• Phobias can be effectively treated with CBT.

CASE 3:

GENERALIZED ANXIETY

History
A 40-year-old school teacher attends his general practitioner surgery with his wife with
complaints of feeling constantly fearful. These feelings have been present on most days
over the past 3 years and are not limited to specific situations or discrete periods. He also
experiences poor concentration, irritability, tremors, palpitations, dizziness and dry
mouth. He has continued to work, but his symptoms are causing stress at work and at
home. He denies any problems with his mood and reports that his energy levels are fine.
He admits that he is experiencing problems with his sleep. He finds it difficult to fall
asleep and states that he does not feel refreshed on waking up. He has been married for
15 years and lives with his wife and two sons aged 8 and 10. His parents live locally and
he has no siblings. His father has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia. He
remembers his mother being anxious for much of his childhood. He has no previous
medical or psychiatric history and is not taking any medication. He smokes 20 cigarettes
per day and drinks alcohol socially. He has never used any illicit drugs. He tends to hide
his symptoms and said that he was seeing his GP because his wife wanted him to seek
help.
Mental state examination
He makes fleeting eye contact. He is a neatly dressed man with no evidence of selfneglect. He appears to be restless and tense but settles down as the interview progresses.
He answers all the questions appropriately and there is no abnormality in his speech. His
mood is euthymic and he does not have any thoughts of self-harm. There is no evidence
of delusions or hallucinations. He is able to recognize the impact of his symptoms on his
social and occupational functioning and is keen to seek help.
Physical examination
His blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg and his pulse is regular and 110 beats per minute.
The rest of the physical examination does not reveal any abnormality.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you investigate and manage this patient in general practice?

7

ANSWER 3
This man is suffering with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). His predominant symptom
is a feeling of constant fear and insecurity. He also has symptoms of anxiety related to
autonomic arousal including tremors, palpitations and a dry mouth. These symptoms
have been present on most days for a period greater than 6 months. These symptoms are
constant and not limited to specific situations like fear of being embarrassed in public
(social phobia), fear of heights (specific phobia), discrete periods (panic attacks), or related
to obsessions (obsessive-compulsive disorder – OCD) or to recollections of intense trauma
(post-traumatic stress disorder – PTSD).

!

Differential diagnoses

• Depression: Anxiety symptoms are common in depression and co-morbid
•
•
•
•

depression is often seen with GAD. The type of symptom that appears first and is
more severe is conventionally considered to be primary.
Panic disorder: There is a discrete episode of intense fear with sudden onset and a
subjective need to escape.
Other anxiety disorders: They have the same core symptoms as in GAD but the
symptoms occur in specific situations as in phobic anxiety disorder, OCD or PTSD.
Substance misuse: Symptoms of alcohol or drug withdrawal may mimic those of
anxiety.
Physical illness: A host of medical conditions can mimic GAD – endocrine disorders
such as hyperthyroidism or phaeochromocytoma; neurological disorders such as
migraine; deficiency states such as anaemia or vitamin B12 deficiency; cardiac
conditions such as arrythmias and mitral valve prolapse, and metabolic conditions
such as hypoglycaemia and porphyria.

A detailed history and mental state examination is needed to rule out the differential
diagnoses listed above. Relevant blood tests like thyroid function tests, blood glucose and
complete blood count are needed to rule out the physical differentials. Additional tests
can be done in the context of other findings on history or examination.
Patients seen in early stages of GAD may respond to counselling offered in primary care.
Those with moderate to severe symptoms need cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), which
is the first line treatment. Chronic or severe cases may need referral to psychiatric
services, as in the case of this patient. Anxiety management provided by a community
mental health nurse is often effective and no other treatment is needed. Selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine or citalopram can be
useful but may cause paradoxical increase in agitation and reduce patients’ concordance
with treatment. Side-effects should be monitored carefully. Benzodiazepines carry a risk
of developing tolerance and dependence with continuous use and should only be used
very rarely and then for no more than 3 weeks.
KEY POINTS

• Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by a constant feeling of fear and insecurity.
• CBT is the treatment of choice. Benzodiazepines should be avoided.

CASE 4:

SICK NOTE

History
A 43-year-old medical representative attends the general practice surgery requesting a
sick note. She is due to deliver a presentation next week to the national team, upon which
hinges her hope of a promotion. She says that the thought of doing this presentation is
making her feel very panicky. She has always had stage fright and even the thought of
speaking in public makes her tremor worse. When asked to speak in public she develops
palpitations, sweating, dizziness and a feeling of butterflies in her stomach. She feels that
she will make a fool of herself in public and therefore goes to great lengths to avoid such
situations. When she has had to make presentations in the past to her local team, she has
used a ‘couple of drinks’ to calm herself. She is single and is also nervous about dating
and meeting senior doctors. She feels that her problems have worsened over the past 3
years since she was promoted to hospital representative. Since then she has tended to fret
about forthcoming presentations and her sleep has been quite poor. Over the last week
she has been extremely agitated and has found it hard to concentrate on anything, so
much so that she nearly had a serious road traffic accident. Fortunately, she escaped with
a dent in her car. She reiterates her request for a sick note, as it would be ‘impossible’ for
her to do the presentation. She would like to drive down to see her sister in Cornwall
instead. There is no evidence of recurrent sick notes in her medical notes.
Mental state examination
She is a well-dressed woman wearing make-up. She establishes a good rapport and is
cooperative. She appears very fidgety and restless. She is sweating profusely and keeps
fanning herself with a magazine. Periodically, she gets tearful and her voice becomes
tremulous. Her mood is clearly anxious and agitated. She does not have any formal
thought disorder or indeed any other psychotic symptoms. She is a little irritable and gets
upset when she feels that her request for a sick note is not being taken seriously. She has
good insight into her symptoms. She acknowledges that she has not sought help ‘all these
years’ but expresses her willingness to try any treatment that is likely to work.
Physical examination
Physical examination is unremarkable apart from tachycardia of 100/min.
Questions
• How will you deal with her request for a sick note?
• What advice do you give her in relation to her driving?

9

ANSWER 4
This lady is presenting with somatic and psychological symptoms of anxiety, which seem to
occur in specific social situations where she fears she will embarrass or humiliate herself. So
far, she has coped with these situations either by self-medicating with alcohol or by
avoidance of the anxiety-provoking situation. The most likely diagnosis is either social
phobia or panic disorder, although co-morbid depression needs to be ruled out, as does
alcohol misuse or endocrine problems.
Presently, she is very anxious about a presentation at work and is requesting a sick note.
Sick notes for physical illness are usually less problematic as objective evidence of illness
is often available. Stigma about psychiatric illness, both from the patient and the doctor,
can further create barriers to providing a sick note. The presence of drugs or alcohol in
the clinical narrative, as is the case here, can make one take a judgmental view. Parsons’
concept* of the sick role suggests that sick people get sympathy and are exempt from
social obligations such as work or school. In return, however, there is the expectation that
they will seek help and accept the offered treatment. This lady is likely to respond to
cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) but that may take weeks. Similarly, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine may be effective but are unlikely to help
her next week. Benzodiazepines can relieve anxiety in the short-term but carry the risk
of dependence as well as causing drowsiness and sedation. This lady has a clinical
diagnosis of an anxiety disorder and is willing to accept treatment. A sick note should
help reduce the stress she is experiencing. It is important, however, to ensure that the sick
note does not become an avoidance mechanism that tends to reinforce the underlying
anxiety. The sick note should therefore be time-limited and supported by efforts aimed at
helping her back to work and engaging with treatment.

!

DVLA
Anxiety or depressive disorders, unless severe, do not usually necessitate
suspension of driving. Effects of medication for these conditions or symptoms that
impair driving must however be judged on an individual basis. With psychotic
disorders (for example, schizophrenia or mania) the DVLA guidance requires
suspension of driving during the acute illness and for 3 months after complete
resolution of the acute episode. Return of the licence requires that the patient is
compliant with treatment, that treatment side-effects do not impair driving, that the
patient has regained insight, and has a favourable specialist report. Fitness to drive is
also usually impaired in dementia.

This lady has significant problems with concentration and agitation, which is impairing her
ability to drive. DVLA guidance requires her driving to cease pending medical enquiry with
resumption after a ‘period of stability’, which needs to be judged clinically. She should be
advised not to drive. If she refuses to heed this advice, GMC guidelines advise breaking
confidentiality and informing DVLA.
KEY POINTS

• Stigma about psychiatric illness may hamper return to work; sick leave relieves stress in
the short-term but prognosis improves with return to work.

• The DVLA needs to be informed if the patient continues to drive despite being unfit to
do so.

CASE 5:

OBSESSIVE RITUALS BUT DOES NOT WANT MEDICATION

History
A 27-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of increasing repetitive behavioural
routines. He is now unable to leave the house without undertaking lengthy repetitive
checking of locks, taps and switches. He is taking longer and longer so that he is often
late for work. He is worried about losing his job as other colleagues have been made
redundant. He had a similar episode when he was 19 around the time of his ‘A level’
examinations but that settled within a few weeks which is why he has delayed seeking
help. He wants to know what is wrong with him and what treatment options there are
that do not require medication.
Mental state examination
His eye contact is good. He is anxious and gently rubs his hands together without looking
at them. His mood is not low subjectively or objectively. His speech is normal. There are
no delusions or hallucinations and nothing else of note.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What are the treatment options?
• What are the key points about the therapy you would need to make sure the patient is
aware of?

11

ANSWER 5
The most likely diagnosis is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD can take many forms,
but, in general, sufferers experience repetitive, intrusive and unwelcome thoughts, images,
impulses and doubts which they find hard to ignore. These thoughts form the obsessional
part of ‘obsessive-compulsive’ and they usually (but not always) cause the person to perform
repetitive compulsions, which are an attempt to relieve the obsessions and neutralize the
anxiety. Often there is a thought about completing an action that is accompanied by a fear
that if they do not comply something dreadful will happen. They recognize that their fears
and anxious behaviours are irrational but they do not stop themselves acting on them.
Medication is not recommended as a sole treatment method but is often used as an
adjuvant treatment if the patient is willing. It will sometimes work by reducing the severity
of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms or by ‘taking the edge off’ some of the anxiety
precipitated by OCD, but cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) should always be the principal
method of treatment. CBT helps patients change how they think (‘Cognitive’) and what
they do (‘Behaviour’). CBT focuses on the ‘here and now’ problems and difficulties. It does
not seek to look at the past for causes for current behaviour and feelings.
In this case he will need to consider how
Situation
the obsessive thoughts lead to certain other
thoughts, sensations, feelings and actions.
CBT recognizes how these aspects interact
in reinforcing cycles. It can help change

CBT can be done individually or with a group of people. It can also be done from a selfhelp book or computer programme. CBT can be time consuming and needs motivation
and commitment from the patient. Treatment usually involves 5–20 sessions weekly or
fortnightly and sessions vary between 30–60 minutes. The problem is broken down into
separate parts. It is usual to keep a diary to help identify individual patterns of thoughts,
emotions, bodily feelings and actions. The relationship between these components is
explored and techniques devised to help change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours.
There is usually some ‘homework’ or ‘experiments’ between sessions and this may include
diaries. As an example, response prevention is practised where compulsions are not
carried out with discussion of thoughts, feelings, actions and outcomes. Meetings are used
to do cognitive work, carry out and plan experiments and review how the tasks were
undertaken and how further success can be built. CBT can be difficult to implement if
someone is acutely distressed as it does need a level of clear thinking. Depression is often
a co-morbid problem.
KEY POINTS

• CBT is the treatment of choice in OCD.
• CBT is a time consuming therapy that requires work and commitment from the patient
outside of the therapy sessions.

CASE 6:

HAVING A HEART ATTACK

A 36-year-old school teacher is brought in by the paramedics to the emergency
department. This is her fifth presentation in four weeks. She woke up from her sleep last
week drenched in sweat and experiencing an intense constricting chest pain. She reported
a racing heart, difficulty breathing and an overwhelming fear that she was about to die.
She called 999 who took her to the emergency department where all investigations were
normal. She was discharged with a diagnosis of ‘panic attack’ but she had a similar attack
two weeks later. On her third presentation she was referred to a psychiatrist. She had
another episode last week, which was managed by the paramedics.
Today, however, she said that the chest pain was far more severe and she was also feeling
dizzy, choking, with hyperventilation, numbness and tingling in her left arm, which
convinced her she was having a heart attack. The paramedics tried to reassure her but she
started screaming and flailing her legs and arms forcing them to take her to the
emergency department once again.
She tells you that she thinks she is dying or going mad. She is terrified of having another
attack and has insisted her husband take leave over the past week to be with her. She
refuses to go out anywhere without him. She is upset about having called 999 but says
the emergency doctors saved her life. She is avoiding her bedroom as four of the five
attacks have happened there. She is avoiding lying down and instead spends the night in
her armchair. Her husband is extremely concerned. He is particularly worried as her father
has a history of myocardial infarction and her mother has had a stroke. She has tried
cannabis a few times, the last time being 6 months ago. She smokes when she goes out
for a drink with her friends – usually once a month. They live in their own home, have
no children and have no financial worries.

Physical examination
She appears calmer but shaken. She is drenched in sweat and still tremulous. She has
tachycardia and tachyponea, but blood pressure (130/84 mmHg) is normal. There is no
other significant abnormality.
INVESTIGATIONS
Her ECG is normal. Random blood sugar, thyroid profile, serum calcium and urine drug
screen are also normal.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis and what are the likely complications?
• How will you explain the diagnosis and possible treatment to her and her husband?

13

ANSWER 6
This lady is presenting with a panic attack which is a discrete period of intense fear or
discomfort developing abruptly and peaking within 10 minutes. It is characterized by
palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, choking sensations, nausea,
abdominal distress, dizziness, fear of control or ‘going crazy’, fear of dying, tingling
sensations, numbness and chills or hot flushes. Derealization (feelings of unreality) and
depersonalization (feelings of detachment from self) may also be seen. She has recurrent
attacks with persistent fear of having another attack (fear of fear) and worry about the
implications of having the attack (fear of heart attack and death) suggesting a diagnosis
of panic disorder. She is anxious about sleeping at night and is avoiding her bedroom
and is engaging in the safety seeking behaviour of going to the emergency department
or of keeping her husband next to her. This suggests a diagnosis of panic disorder
with agoraphobia.
Medical conditions that need to be ruled out include hyperthyroidism,
hyperparathyroidism (serum calcium), phaeochromocytoma (hypertension with
headaches, tachycardia), hypoglycaemia and cardiac arrhythmias.
Phobic avoidance and agoraphobia are common complications in panic disorder and can
lead to the patient becoming housebound. Alcohol, substance misuse and depression are
other possible complications.
Reassuring her and her husband that there is no serious physical illness is important but
so is acknowledging the reality of her distress and the worry of her husband. Cognitive
behaviour therapy with her will explain the link between emotions (fear), cognitions
(belief that sleep may induce an attack) and safety (sleeping in the armchair) and how
this is crucial as an explanation of the vicious cycle. It creates a link between sense of
apprehension and physiological changes such as increased heart rate (see Figure 6.1).
These bodily changes are interpreted catastrophically with fear of something awful
happening (catastrophic misinterpretation) leading to more anxiety which leads to further
sympathetic response and somatic symptoms perpetuating the vicious cycle. This
explanation provides the basis for cognitive behaviour therapy which is the
recommended treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Recognizing
signs of a panic attack and understanding the stress response can abort a panic attack.
Cognitive therapy can be explained using the hot cross bun model pictured in Figure 6.2.
Short-acting benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and lorazepam reduce the frequency
and intensity of panic attacks but carry a high risk of dependence and are therefore not
recommended. Tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine are effective though SSRIs may induce
anxiety and agitation in the short-term.
KEY POINTS

• Repeated catastrophic presentation of anxiety symptoms in the absence of a medical
cause suggests panic disorder.

• Reassure patients and significant others, explaining the link between physical and
psychological symptoms.

CASE 7:

STEPPED CARE FOR DEPRESSION IN PRIMARY CARE

History
A 34-year-old bank manager attends the general practice surgery with her 8-year-old
son, who is suffering from asthma. She appears tremulous and becomes tearful while
talking about his problem. She says that she has been very worried about her son and has
not been sleeping very well for the past 5–6 months. She has been eating reasonably well
although she admits that she has felt more tired and demotivated than usual. She is still
going to work but has found it hard to concentrate on her work as well as before. She
worries that she might make a serious mistake at work. She says that she has managed
to cope with the support of her husband, who has been ‘a rock’. However, there have been
days when she has found it difficult to get out of bed. She feels she is going through a
bad patch and is hopeful that things will get better soon. She does not see a problem with
her self-esteem and finds her work enjoyable but exhausting. She completely dismisses
any idea of self-harm or suicide, saying she would never even think about it. She
apologizes profusely for becoming emotional and asserts that she is normally very calm
and composed but had been overcome by the stress of her son’s illness. She requests a
glass of water and takes a few deep breaths as her ‘heart was beating fast’.
She lives with her husband in their own 4-bedroom house. There is no family history of
any major medical or psychiatric illness. In particular, she denies history of any mood
episodes, either depression or hypomania. She drinks alcohol socially, never exceeding 10
units per week. She does not smoke or use any illicit drugs. She describes herself as a ‘gogetter’. She is a keen runner and runs 12–16 miles a week.

Physical examination
She agrees to a brief physical examination. She has a tachycardia of 108/min, her pulse
is regular and her blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg. Her palms appear cold and sweaty but
there is no other significant physical finding.
Mental state examination
She is pleasant, cooperative and establishes a good rapport. She is clutching her son
protectively but maintains good eye-to-eye contact throughout the interview. Her speech
is of normal rate and volume. Her mood is anxious and low. She does not have any
psychotic symptoms. She has a good insight into her symptoms. She does not wish to
take any medications but acknowledges that she needs to be ‘strong’ to be able to look
after her son. She does not have any ideas of self-harm.
Questions
• What are the possible diagnoses?
• How should this woman be managed?

17

ANSWER 7
This woman is presenting with a mixture of anxiety and depressive symptoms occurring
in the context of her son’s illness. She is feeling very stressed and has coped well with
her husband’s support. Diagnostic possibilities include:

• Mixed anxiety and depression. This is a common presentation in primary care
characterized by a mix of anxiety and depressive symptoms without clear
prominence of any one type and the presence of one or more physical symptoms
(typically tremor, palpitations, lethargy etc.) present for more than 6 months.
• Adjustment disorder with depressed mood or with mixed anxiety and/or depression.
This occurs in reaction to a stressful event or situation usually lasting less than 6
months with onset within 3 months of onset of a stressor. The symptoms are not
caused by bereavement and the symptoms do not persist for more than an
additional 6 months after cessation of the stressor.
• Depression. She does have the core symptoms (low/anxious mood, reduced energy)
and some other symptoms (reduced concentration, poor sleep) lasting more than 2
weeks suggesting a mild depressive episode.
• Other disorders that need exclusion include: generalized anxiety disorder or medical
causes of anxiety/depression. Dysthymia (characterized by depressed mood over 2
years and two or more from a list of: reduced or increased appetite, insomnia or
hypersomnia, low energy, low self-esteem, poor concentration and feelings of
hopelessness) can be excluded in this case due to the duration criteria. Bipolar
disorder needs to be excluded by asking about hypomanic/manic episodes.
Detailed history and mental state examination will be needed to establish the diagnosis.
Appropriate investigations to rule out any medical disorders will also be required. NICE
guidelines suggest that when depressive and anxious symptoms coexist, the first priority
should usually be to treat the depression. Psychological treatment for depression often
reduces anxiety, and many antidepressants also have sedative/anxiolytic effects.
A stepped care model approach would be well-suited to this situation. This woman has
mild mood symptoms and as per the stepped care model, these are best treated initially
in a primary care setting. ‘Watchful waiting’ (follow-up appointment within 2 weeks) with
reassurance is sensible, as symptoms may resolve spontaneously. If symptoms persist on
subsequent visits, brief psychological interventions may be provided by the practice
counsellor or primary care mental health worker. Computerized cognitive behaviour
therapy, healthy lifestyle advice about exercise and sleep hygiene are also helpful. Guided
self-help using manuals or self-help books are other options available in primary care. If
her symptoms worsen, treatment can be commenced taking into account her preference.
Psychological treatments such as CBT or antidepressant/anxiolytic medication such as
SSRIs can be effectively administered in primary care. Treatment-resistant cases,
psychotic symptoms, atypical symptoms or recurrent episodes should trigger a referral to
specialist services. At any stage, if risk profiles change rapidly and risk assessment
indicates a risk to self, others or of self-neglect a referral can be made to the crisis team
for consideration of in-patient treatment.
KEY POINTS

• Establish the diagnosis and severity of mood disorder.
• Manage mild/moderate cases in primary care using a stepped care approach.

CASE 8:

HANDS RAW WITH WASHING

History
A 37-year-old pharmacy assistant attends the GP surgery with a skin rash on his forearms
and his palms. He seems rather reluctant to talk much and is visibly tense. When asked
about allergies he says that he may have soap allergy. On direct questioning about
symptoms of anxiety he acknowledges feeling anxious. He says that he worries a lot at
work, specifically whether he has accidentally packed the wrong medicines. He works in
a supermarket pharmacy and has to regularly check if he has dispensed the correct
medicine in the correct dose. There are times when he has checked as often as 10 times
before handing the medicines over to the customer. When really anxious he experiences
palpitations, sweating and butterflies in his stomach. He feels better in himself after
‘checking it all out’, but the worry and fear that he has made a mistake returns a few
hours later in relation to another customer. This makes him very slow at work and he has
received two warnings from his boss. He frequently worries about handing the wrong
medicines to his customers and in the past week has called his boss at home to check this.
He admits that he washes his hands at least three times an hour when at work but often
more so at home where he uses undiluted washing up liquid to ‘make sure they are really
clean’. He started doing this two years ago when he was worried that he may have picked
up an infection visiting a friend in hospital. He continues to worry about the risk of
passing infection to his clients and ‘does not want to take any chances’. He admits it is
bizarre that he has such irrational thoughts, but says he cannot help worrying about it.
He has tried various strategies such as watching TV or listening to music to try and stop
these thoughts, but has had no success. Increasingly he has become concerned about
spreading infections and has spent thousands of pounds on pest control at home. Things
have worsened over the past few weeks at work and he is very ‘depressed’ at the prospect
of losing his job.
He does not have any previous medical or psychiatric history of note. He is not taking
any medication. He lives with his wife. They do not have any children. His parents and
his sister live locally. There is no family history of mental illness. He does not drink or
smoke and has never tried any drugs.

Examination
Physical examination reveals excoriations with a red scaly rash on palms and forearms.
There is no other finding of note on physical examination apart from mild tachycardia.
He is anxious but does not have any thought disorder. He is preoccupied with repetitive
thoughts of spreading infections which has slowed him down at work. He has tried to
control this fear by washing his hands repeatedly but that has made little difference to
his fear.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What interventions should you offer?

19

ANSWER 8
This man is presenting with a skin rash suggestive of contact dermatitis. However, it is
important to ask screening questions to rule out an anxiety disorder. He exhibits a range
of anxiety symptoms – both psychological (worry, fretting) and physical (palpitations,
sweating) indicating an anxiety disorder. The focus of anxiety is the repetitive, intrusive
thoughts of the fear of spreading infection. These are his own thoughts and he feels
compelled to push them out of his mind and resist them. These are the features of
obsessions. The most common obsessions are about contamination or involve
pathological doubt. Occasionally, the ruminations may be in the form of impulses or vivid
images rather than thoughts, usually with some disturbing content such as violence or
unacceptable sexual practice.
His anxiety is relieved by hand washing which is an obsessional ritual or compulsion
aimed at relieving tension or anxiety in this case by neutralizing the ruminations (an
obsession of contamination in this case). Rituals of checking and cleaning are most
common but compulsions for symmetry, hoarding and counting are also seen where they
relieve tension by preventing obsessions (worry about things not being ‘right’ or
something bad happening).
In the differential diagnosis other anxiety disorders should be considered. These include
generalized anxiety disorder where the anxiety is constant and there is no focus to the
anxiety symptoms, while in phobias, anxiety is triggered by the phobic situation (for
example, skyscrapers in fear of heights). In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) the
focus of anxiety is the past trauma while in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) the
obsessions generate anxiety relieved temporarily by compulsions. Depression is
commonly seen alongside OCD and other anxiety disorders. It is important to ask
screening questions about depression including low mood, reduced energy and lack of
interest in every case of anxiety disorder. Psychotic disorder can lead to ruminations and
rituals. This man says his thoughts are ‘bizarre’ and that he is getting ‘paranoid’ which
may arouse the suspicion of a psychotic disorder. In OCD, the thoughts are always
recognized as ‘own’ thoughts (i.e. not hallucinatory) and are recognized as being
irrational (i.e. not delusional).
Management of choice in OCD is cognitive behaviour therapy. This involves behaviour
strategies such as exposure to the trigger (for example, filling the medication box) and
response prevention (preventing or limiting checking). This is supported by challenge to
attributions using Socratic questioning* and exploration of beliefs aided by relaxation
techniques. The ‘flooding’ technique involves subjecting the patient to intense exposure
of the anxiety-provoking stimuli until the severity of the fearful emotion subsides. This
is not so commonly used in modern practice. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as
clomipramine and fluoxetine have also been found useful for OCD in conjunction with
CBT or behaviour therapy. Reassurance and support to patient and carers is important.
KEY POINTS

• Obsessions are one’s own thoughts, repetitive, intrusive and unpleasant.
• Compulsions are used to neutralize or prevent obsessions.
• Exposure and response prevention are key treatment strategies.

CASE 9:

UNRESPONSIVE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

History
A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his girlfriend in an
unresponsive state. His girlfriend provides the history. She left him in his bedsit last night
but found him lying unconscious this morning. She says that he has been an intravenous
heroin addict for the past 5 years but is certain that he never shares needles and has had
regular negative tests for HIV. In the past he has made several unsuccessful attempts to
quit heroin, the last one being as recent as a week ago. There is no significant medical or
psychiatric history. He is unemployed and lives on his own. His parents died when he was
young and he does not have any surviving relatives.
Examination
His pulse is 70/min regular, blood pressure 108/58 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 10/min.
He is in a hypotonic hyporeflexic coma but there are no focal neurological signs. There
is no verbal response though he groans in response to pain. His Glasgow Coma Score
(GCS) is 4/15. His sPO2 (percutaneous oxygen saturation) is 75%. He has pinpoint pupils.
His arms and legs reveal multiple scarred needle puncture sites. His consciousness
improves significantly (GCS of 15) following an intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg of naloxone.

Questions
• What is the immediate management?
• How will you manage him in the long-term?

21

ANSWER 9
This man has the characteristic combination of impaired consciousness, bradypnoea and
miosis indicative of opioid toxicity. Pin-point pupils may be observed in pontine lesions
or after local cholinergic drops, but history and examination suggest opioid overdose.
Naloxone is a specific opiate antagonist with no agonist or euphoriant properties. On
intravenous or subcutaneous administration it rapidly reverses the respiratory depression
and sedation caused by heroin intoxication, confirming the diagnosis, as in this case.
Immediate management involves securing the airway, stabilization of breathing and
circulation (ABC), providing supported ventilation and intravenous fluids. Naloxone is
administered at a continuous 0.3 mg/hour infusion aimed at keeping the GCS at 15 and
a respiratory rate over 12/min. He will need to be observed in an intensive care unit (ICU)
with naloxone infusion until all opioids are cleared from the system. Investigations
include blood and urine toxicology, full blood count for infections and arterial blood
gases to monitor oxygenation. Further investigations include liver function tests, rapid
plasma reagent (RPR), hepatitis viral testing, HIV testing in view of IV drug use and chest
X-ray to rule out pulmonary fibrosis.
Detailed history and mental state examination are needed to assess whether the overdose
was accidental or deliberate and to rule out psychiatric disorders such as depression. A
sermon listing the ill-effects of substance misuse is likely to be ineffective and, in an
acute setting, inappropriate. Motivational interviewing (MI) techniques have been shown
to be more effective. This is where the patient, rather than the doctor, lists the costs and
benefits of continued substance misuse. Key components of MI are:
1 Use of empathy to understand the patient’s point of view and reasons for using
opioids.
2 Allowing the patient opportunity to explore the discrepancy between positive core
values (for example, a desire to ‘be good’) and his unhealthy behaviours.
3 Tackling the inevitable resistance with empathy rather than confrontation.
4 Supporting self-efficacy and enhancing self-esteem.
Prochaska and Di Clemente’s stages of change* help identify the patient’s readiness to
engage in therapeutic change (see Figure 9.1).
The step-wise goals of treatment guide the patient through harm minimization strategies
up to the complete cessation of the addictive behaviour. These include: (1) reduce injecting;
(2) reduce street drug use; (3) maintenance therapy (MT) with heroin substitutes methadone
(long-acting μ receptor agonist) or buprenorphine (partial agonist); (4) reduction in
substitute prescribing; and (5) abstinence. An ongoing psychosocial care package with
cognitive or group therapy aimed at relapse prevention is vital. MT reduces illicit drug use,
criminal activity, risk of seroconversion for HIV, hepatitis B and C and improves
socialization. Methadone can be fatal in overdose and also has street value so medication
is dispensed in liquid form (rather than tablets that can be reconstituted for injection).

*Prochaska JO, DiClemente CC Stages and processes of self change of smoking: toward an integrative model
of change. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 51, 390–395.

22

KEY POINTS

• Opioid intoxication needs urgent treatment with naloxone, the opioid antagonist.
• Empathizing is more effective than sermonizing.
• Maintenance therapy reduces illicit drug use but must be supported with a full package
of care.

Stages of change
Precontemplation: The patient does not acknowledge the problem and is often
defensive about his substance misuse.
Contemplation: There is awareness of the consequences of substance misuse while
weighing up of the pros and cons of quitting. There is no decision made to change.
Preparation/determination: A commitment is made to change, involving research and
preparation for the consequences. Skipping this step and jumping to ‘action’ often
leads to ‘relapse’.
Action: Active efforts to change. It is boosted by external help and support.
Maintenance: Success in this stage involves avoiding relapse. This entails constant
adaptation and acquisition of new skills to deal with changes in the environment.
Relapse: This is common and so it is useful to encourage a return to contemplation and
re-entry into the cycle.

CASE 10:

BIPOLAR DISORDER

History
A 34-year-old call-centre manager attends her GP surgery with her boyfriend. She
complains of tiredness and a lack of enthusiasm for life. These complaints started a year
ago but have worsened over the past 2 months. She has been forced to take time off work
as she was constantly arguing with the senior manager and found it difficult to remain
calm and composed at work. She has also been irritable with her boyfriend, and gets upset
easily if he tries to ‘motivate’ her. She knows that he is well-meaning, but still finds it
very irritating and yet feels guilty for responding to him in this way. She has lost all
interest in sex or going out socializing and despite being offered a great deal of support
by her boyfriend, she constantly worries that he will leave her. Over the past 6 weeks
when she has been at home, she has spent most of her time in bed. She admits shamefacedly that there are days when she does not wash or even brush her teeth. She vacantly
watches the television, not able to take in anything. She feels ‘empty’ most of the time
and finds it upsetting that she cannot even react to her boyfriend’s efforts at reaching out
to her. She watches TV until late finding it difficult to sleep. In the morning, she feels
exhausted and tends to lie in bed till late. She has had thoughts of dying, but resists
acting on these as she does not want to punish her boyfriend or her mother, who lives by
herself.
She is an only child. She lives with her boyfriend in his flat. She is close to her mother
and visits her weekly. Her father died following a stroke last year. She is healthy and has
no medical problems. She does not drink or use drugs. She remembers being admitted to
a psychiatric unit on a section at the age of 19 as she had become ‘very high’. She
remembers taking lithium for a while, but now has been off it for years. The only other
psychiatric episode she can recall was on a holiday to Greece when she became quite
elated and was convinced that she was Venus, the goddess of love. She went to the local
market, topless, was arrested and admitted to a local psychiatric hospital. She was treated
as an in-patient for 2 weeks and was discharged with some medication. She has only hazy
memories of the episode, but remembers not taking the medication on her return to
the UK.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How will you manage this patient in the short and longer term?

25

ANSWER 10
This woman is presenting with a moderate to severe depressive episode with a past history
of two episodes of mood disorder, which appear to have been manic episodes (delusions
of grandeur, elated mood and disinhibition requiring admission to an in-patient unit). The
most likely diagnosis is bipolar disorder, with a current depressive episode.
To manage the current depressive element she should be referred to the mental health
team for an urgent assessment. Antidepressants may lead to a switch to mania, and
should therefore be avoided. This is particularly so in cases of rapid cycling illness (more
than four mood episodes per year) or in case of a recent manic episode. Psychotherapies
such as CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy) or quetiapine added on to prophylactic mood
stabilizing medication such as lithium or sodium valproate may offer an effective
alternative. Where antidepressants are unavoidable (severe depression or risk of suicide),
SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are preferred over TCAs (tricyclic
antidepressants) as they are less likely to cause a switch.
It is prudent to consider longer term management. She has had more than two acute
mood episodes, and therefore it is very likely that she will have further episodes of either
depression or mania. Prophylactic treatment is strongly indicated in this case as it reduces
the frequency and intensity of mood episodes. Lithium, sodium valproate or olanzapine
are recommended for prophylaxis; however, she is of childbearing age and therefore
lithium and sodium valproate should be avoided. Prophylaxis should be continued for at
least 2 years after an episode, but may need to be as long as 5 years if risk factors such
as severe psychotic episode, frequent relapses, co-morbid substance misuse, ongoing
stress or poor psychosocial support are present. A key ingredient for a positive prognosis
is early recognition of a relapse and prompt treatment. She is an ideal candidate for care
under the Care Programme Approach (CPA) with a care coordinator and multi-agency
input to help design and deliver a needs-based care plan. She and her boyfriend need to
be actively involved in developing a crisis plan as they will be in the best position to
identify early signs of relapse. Helping her with potential triggers such as shift work,
improving sleep hygiene and providing extra support at times of stress is important.
Advance directives can be useful in treatment planning for future episodes, as insight is
often impaired in manic episodes and in severe depression. A shared protocol of care
between primary care and secondary care is needed and she should be placed on the
Serious Mental Illness (SMI) register. Her physical health will require close monitoring in
view of the side effects of her prophylactic medication. Weight, blood glucose, lipids,
blood pressure, smoking and alcohol status should be monitored regularly. Her boyfriend
may benefit from a carer’s assessment and referral to a support group.
KEY POINTS

• Identification of bipolar depression is crucial as management is different from that in
unipolar depression.

• Psychoeducation with identification of a relapse signature is crucial in ameliorating
future episodes.

• Relapse prevention planning should be part of care for any major mental illness.
• Monitoring physical health is vital especially when prophylactic medication is prescribed.

CASE 11:

PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPY

History
A 36-year-old stockbroker attends the GP surgery requesting help with her mood. She has
been feeling very stressed and has been finding it difficult to cope with work. She is used
to working in a high-pressure environment but now feels burnt out and is worried that
she may lose her job. She broke up with her boyfriend of 6 years, 9 months ago and has
been single since then. She has little interest in dating but has been having casual sexual
relationships, which only make her feel worse about herself. She feels guilty for having
neglected her boyfriend on account of her work, but also feels angry with him for having
abandoned her. She cries to sleep every day and tends to wake up early. She has little
interest in anything, but forces herself to go to work though it leaves her feeling
exhausted so that she spends the weekend in bed. She hates herself physically, thinking
she is too fat. She says she hates her personality as she believes she is too dependent and
clingy.
She feels desperate about the future fearing that her biological clock is ticking away. She
feels very guilty about a medical termination of pregnancy that she had with her
boyfriend and feels that she can never forgive herself for having the abortion. There is
no significant medical history. She has never formally sought help for any mental health
problems, but feels that she has lacked in confidence for years.
She is close to her mother and visits her daily. She says that her father walked away from
the family when she was 13 years old. She has refused to meet him though her two
brothers have made peace with him. She feels that since then she became a gloomy
pessimistic person. She thinks that her friends and colleagues perceive her as a critical,
humourless person. She had a brief course of cognitive behaviour therapy in the past and
although she engaged she found it unsatisfying, because she felt it focused more on the
present, when she was wanting to talk about her father and other past issues, which she
felt were unresolved.
She lives on her own in her apartment. She drinks two bottles of wine over the weekend,
but does not see this as a problem. She does not smoke or abuse any illicit drugs.

Mental state examination
She is dressed smartly wearing subtle makeup. She establishes a good rapport and is very
deferential. She speaks articulately but starts sobbing when talking of her abortion. She
looks visibly upset when talking about her boyfriend. Her anger is evident when talking
about her father. She clearly describes ideas of hopelessness, guilt and worthlessness. Her
mood is low, but she does not have any ideas of self-harm. She has very good insight and
she understands the need to deal with her symptoms and the personality issues
underlying them. She is motivated to seek and to comply with any interventions.
However, she would prefer not to take medication and requests a talking therapy.
Questions
• What psychological therapy would you prescribe her?
• How would you explain the role of psychodynamic therapy in her case?

27

ANSWER 11
This woman is presenting with low mood, tiredness, ideas of hopelessness, guilt and
worthlessness with sleep disturbance of more than 2 years duration. This is superimposed
on longstanding traits of pessimism and low self-esteem. She may be suffering from a
moderate depressive episode although underlying dysthymia characterized by at least 2
years of low-grade depressive mood also needs to be considered. Depressive episode
superimposed on dysthymia is called double depression. NICE guidance recommends
cognitive behaviour therapy for depression. However, the guidelines do state that
‘psychodynamic psychotherapy may be considered for the treatment of the complex comorbidities that may be present along with depression’.
This woman has experienced a series of losses in her life: her father, her unborn baby, her
boyfriend and now possibly her job. She is motivated to change and is psychologically
minded, i.e. is demonstrating an awareness of the psychological issues underlying her
problems. This makes her a good candidate for psychodynamic therapy. The key feature
of psychodynamic therapy is to understand current symptoms in the light of past
experiences. The hypothesis is that unresolved conflicts arising from past relationships
(for example, in her relationship with her father in this case) create anxiety. In an effort
to prevent this anxiety, the unconscious mind devises strategies that ward off anxietyprovoking thoughts and emotions that are too difficult to be dealt with in the conscious
mind. These strategies are known as defence mechanisms. In moderation such strategies
can be effective (and can be very useful in the short-term) but when used excessively,
they can contribute to psychopathology. For example, the defence mechanism of denial
can prevent a person moving on developmentally or can mask other compensatory
problems such as alcohol misuse. Psychodynamic work involves making links between
past traumatic experience, defence mechanisms and current symptoms. This process is
helped by encouraging the patient to engage in free association, which involves the
patient talking freely without any censorship. Identifying obstacles to free association
helps identify defence mechanisms such as denial or suppression which have led to the
exclusion of painful material from the conscious mind. Analysis is also helped by an
understanding of transference, whereby the patient transfers, to the therapist, emotions
and beliefs about significant people in her own life. The therapist remains passive and
neutral, facilitating the patient to talk freely.
Psychodynamic therapy may be provided in an individual or group setting.
Psychoanalysis is an intensive therapy focused on developing detailed insight into the
unconscious processes underlying the symptoms leading to a modification of personality.
Sessions are conducted daily or several times a week and can last in excess of 2 years.
Brief psychodynamic therapy, on the other hand, is time-limited, often no more than 20
sessions, and focuses on a specific problem, for example, on the theme of loss in this case.
KEY POINTS

• Psychodynamic therapy is useful in the case of mood and anxiety disorders with
co-morbid complexities such as personality problems.

• It involves understanding current symptoms in the light of past experiences.
• Defence mechanisms are unconscious strategies evoked to prevent anxiety; however, in
the long-term they may worsen psychiatric symptoms.

Case 12:

NEVER FELT BETTER

History
A 33-year-old phlebotomist presents to the emergency department with his girlfriend to
get a repeat prescription of his antidepressant citalopram. He seems very restless, pacing
up and down the waiting room. He is mumbling to himself and intermittently starts
singing rather loudly. He is wearing bright clothes and lots of jewellery. The girlfriend
states that he used up 4 weeks’ worth of medication in 2 weeks. When the staff nurse
approaches him to calm him, he starts shouting and swearing loudly and becomes quite
intimidating and threatening.
He was first diagnosed with depression 5 years ago and responded well to citalopram
20 mg once a day, which was discontinued after a year. Six months ago he became
depressed once again and was again prescribed citalopram 20 mg a day. He has been seen
every four weeks at the GP surgery since then and has been quite well. On his last visit
2 weeks ago he complained of poor sleep and was prescribed temazepam 10 mg nocte.
He has been taking double the dose of his antidepressant of his own accord.
For the past 2 weeks he has had broken sleep, but despite that he feels full of energy. He
has been off work for the past week as he was working on a breakthrough invention ‘that
would revolutionize phlebotomy’. His girlfriend is concerned about him as he has been
very talkative and has been spending excessively and buying her vastly expensive gifts.
There is no adverse medical history and no other psychiatric history apart from the
depressive episodes. He lives with his girlfriend. His parents live locally, he is an only
child and there is no family history of mental illness. He smokes 15–20 cigarettes a day
and engages in social drinking using no more than 10 units a week. He uses cannabis
‘now and then’ and has abused cocaine in the past.

Examination
His eye contact is not good when you are talking but is intense when he is addressing
you. He is talking quite rapidly and claims to be the ‘Crown Prince of England’. He
answers in rhyming ditties and breaks down in sobs holding his girlfriend’s hand. He gets
angry that he is not addressed as ‘His Majesty’ and becomes quite agitated. There are no
hallucinations. He has little insight, but is willing to take antidepressant medication. He
does not have any ideas of self-harm. Physical examination is unremarkable.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you investigate and manage this patient in the emergency department?

29

ANSWER 12
This man is presenting with a manic episode. He displays irritable mood, grandiosity,
reduced need for sleep, psychomotor agitation and excessive spending reflecting poor
judgement for 2 weeks. His symptoms have caused him to miss work and he meets the
criteria for a current manic episode. He has had two episodes of depression and therefore
meets the criteria for bipolar disorder currently in mania. He has been using extra doses
of antidepressant medication and this may have precipitated the manic episode.

!

Differential diagnosis of manic episode

• Hypomania.
• Drug-induced manic episode. Apart from antidepressants, other medications such

•
•
•
•

as steroids and stimulants may cause manic episodes. Illicit drugs such as cocaine,
amphetamines and hallucinogen intoxication can cause manic episodes and
alcohol withdrawal may also mimic a manic episode.
Organic mood disorder. Manic episodes can occur secondary to neurological
conditions such as strokes, space occupying lesions or medical conditions such as
hyperthyroidism, or Cushing’s disorder.
Schizophrenia is characterized by mood-incongruent delusions, hallucinations and
prominent psychotic symptoms as opposed to mood symptoms.
Schizoaffective disorder. Mood symptoms and schizophrenia symptoms are equally
prominent.
Acute confusional state. The agitation and affective lability seen in acute
confusional states may mimic a manic episode.

INVESTIGATIONS

• Obtain collateral history from previous records and GP notes and detailed history from
girlfriend.

• Detailed mental state examination to rule out formal thought disorder, mood-incongruent
•
•

delusions and hallucinations suggestive of schizophrenia. A cognitive abnormality would
be suggestive of delirium (acute confusional state).
Urine drug screen to rule out intoxication with drugs such as amphetamines that may
cause a manic episode.
Blood tests such as whole blood count to rule out infection as a cause for delirium, urea
and electrolytes to exclude an electrolyte imbalance causing delirium, and thyroid
function tests to rule out hyperthyroidism.

He is demanding more antidepressants which probably precipitated his manic episode.
Discontinue his antidepressants and explain to him that they are likely to make him worse
not better. He is acutely agitated and grandiose and is displaying impaired judgement.
Agitation may be treated with a short-acting benzodiazepine such as lorazepam 1–2 mg
orally up to a maximum of 4 mg in 24 hours. If agitation is severe olanzapine 5–10 mg
orally can be used in addition. This man is exhibiting symptoms of a manic episode, he
should be referred for an assessment by the specialist psychiatric team. This would be
either the mental health liaison team, crisis team or the on-call psychiatrist. An acute
manic episode is typically treated with lithium or an atypical antipsychotic such as
olanzapine, risperidone or quetiapine. Management should involve the least restrictive
options appropriate to the situation and thus the crisis resolution home treatment team
30

should perform a risk assessment to consider whether home treatment is suitable. If not,
informal admission needs to be offered. If this is refused, admission under the mental
health act (MHA) needs to be considered. In this case, an admission under Section 2 of
the MHA would be considered.
KEY POINTS

• Antidepressants may precipitate a manic episode and should be stopped.
• A risk assessment would determine whether home treatment or informal admission to
hospital is appropriate. The Mental Health Act may be appropriate when risk to self or
others is present.

CASE 13:

ACHES AND PAINS AND LOSS OF INTEREST

History
A 52-year-old medical secretary visits her general practitioner surgery with a 3-month
history of back pain, generalized body ache and tiredness. She feels absolutely exhausted
and has found it difficult to go to work. She feels so tired and uninterested that she has
stopped her usual weekend visits to her daughter and grandchildren. The pain is located
in the lower back and is described as a constricting non-radiating pain, which seems to
be better when she is lying down. However, she has difficulty falling asleep and often
wakes up early in the morning. At times she continues to lie in bed until early afternoon.
The pain in her back and her body ache does seem to get better as the day goes along.
Her husband has been concerned about her as she is usually a ‘go-getter’. She feels
preoccupied with her pain, does not enjoy the taste of food and has lost weight, which is
one ‘silver lining to the cloud’. At work, she has again been slow and not as ‘efficient’ as
she normally is. She has taken paracetamol and ibuprofen without much benefit.
Physical examination
There is no localized tenderness or inflammation and systemic examination is normal.
Mental state examination
Her eye contact is within normal limits but her face is expressionless. She appears slow,
tired, takes a long time to answer questions and her voice is soft. She reports feeling
‘empty’ and lethargic with little interest in work or previously pleasurable activities. She
reports feeling guilty at not wanting to see her grandchildren. She has difficulty
concentrating but does not report a problem with libido. She does not have any thought
disorder. She does not report any periods of elevated mood or any symptoms of anxiety.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What factors will improve the likelihood of making the correct diagnosis?

33

ANSWER 13
This woman is presenting with multiple somatic symptoms of 3 months duration. While
ruling out an appropriate physical pathology is important (arthritis for example, in this
case), it is equally important to rule out depression, which is a treatable reversible
disorder.

!

Diagnostic criteria for depression

• Core symptoms – low mood, reduced energy and anhedonia (lack of interest and
enjoyment)

• Cognitive symptoms – reduced concentration, ideas of helplessness/hopelessness/
worthlessness, ideas of self-harm/suicide, reduced self-esteem

• Somatic symptoms – reduced sleep (especially early morning awakening), reduced
appetite or weight loss, reduced libido

• At least two of the core symptoms along with three other symptoms for at least a
2-week period suggest a diagnosis of depression

Somatic syndrome is a specific subtype of depression characterized by at least four of the
following: (1) loss of interest or pleasure; (2) lack of emotional reactivity to normally
pleasurable surroundings and events; (3) waking in the morning 2 hours or more before
the usual time; (4) depression worse in the morning (diurnal variation in mood); (5)
psychomotor retardation or agitation; (6) loss of appetite and/or weight (often defined as
5% or more of body weight in the past month); (7) marked loss of libido.
Less than a third of cases of depression are diagnosed in primary care. Knowledge of
depressive symptoms does not seem to be an issue. It may be that patients do not discuss
symptoms (feelings of hopelessness), feel it is embarrassing or stigmatizing (fear of labels,
medication or admission) or present with symptoms that redirect attention elsewhere (for
example, somatic presentation, alcohol or substance use, anxiety disorders or complicated
grief). Somatic presentation seems to be a key factor with diagnosis rates three times less
when there is no obvious psychological factor in the presentation, as in the case of this
woman. A simple rule of thumb is to ask screening questions for depression when there
are three or more somatic symptoms irrespective of their cause. Somatic presentations
have been reported to be more common in certain ethnic minorities; however, in primary
care somatic presentations are very common.
Diagnosis improves with good communication skills in the doctor: better eye contact;
open-ended questions; re-contextualizing physical symptoms to psychological causes
using questions such as ‘are you experiencing any stress?’ or ‘do you think these
symptoms may be due to stress?’ Allowing enough time is important and this patient
should be offered a longer appointment to explore her symptoms in depth.
KEY POINTS

• Depression may often present with somatic symptoms in primary care.
• Screen for core symptoms of depression when there are three or more somatic
symptoms present.

34

CASE 14:

CONSTANTLY TEARFUL

History
A 26-year-old woman complains of being constantly tearful for no clear reason that she
can identify. She feels that given she has just had her first baby she should be feeling on
top of the world. She reports that her recent pregnancy and birth were straightforward
and she had been looking forward to the arrival of the baby. She is married and has good
family support. The baby is fine although feeding has been difficult to establish.
Mental state examination
The woman looks red-faced and tired. She makes good eye contact. She is tearful. She
says that her thoughts are tending to focus on worry about the future and the baby, but
that she can also laugh and enjoy herself when she sees people she is close to. She can
smile at interview. She has no hallucinations or delusions and has no thoughts of harm
to herself or the baby. She believes her symptoms are present because she is exhausted.
Questions
• What further information do you need to make a diagnosis?
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How would you manage this case?

35

ANSWER 14
The main considerations are whether this is ‘baby blues’ or whether something more
serious is going on such as puerperal depression or puerperal psychosis. Establish how
long ago the woman gave birth and consider the symptoms of baby blues (below). Given
the symptoms and the absent history of depression it is most likely that this woman has
the ‘baby blues’. These are often linked to hormonal changes three or four days after
delivery as pregnancy hormones drop and milk production begins. Sleep deprivation and
exhaustion inevitably play their part. There are large emotional, social, family and
practical adjustments to be made when a very dependent baby arrives within a family,
and this may be very daunting. It is always important to exclude the more serious
postnatal depression especially if more time has elapsed since the birth of the baby (for
example, three or four weeks). You will find that a proportion of women with postnatal
depression will have also been depressed at some point in the last year when a good
history is taken.
Baby blues affect 60 to 80% of women usually appearing after the third day post-partum
and resolving within a week.

Some mothers have pains for which

Being unwell generally with no
apparent cause and symptoms

There may also be anxiety about being a mother and looking after the baby. These
feelings are within the range of normal feelings for women who have recently given
birth. They last only a few days but can still be quite frightening especially if they take
the woman by surprise.
No treatment is necessary other than reassurance, support from family and friends, rest,
and time. A mother who has the blues should get as much rest as possible. Affected
mothers may be over-sensitive about what is said to them by relatives and medical staff,
so reassurance and tact and empathy from the staff can be very beneficial at this time.
The tearfulness and anxiety will usually settle without any intervention. It is important
however that the situation is monitored as, if the symptoms do not settle or are
accompanied by suicidal thoughts, then the diagnosis may need to be reviewed. It is also
important to watch for any difficulties in looking after the baby’s needs. If the symptoms
are severe or persist beyond two or three weeks after the birth, more active treatment may
be warranted and the patient should be reassessed.
KEY POINTS

•

•
36

Baby blues are very common but are short-lived.
Reassurance and support is usually all that is required.
Reassessment is useful to monitor progress.
The baby’s welfare should be monitored.

CASE 15:

VOICES COMMENT ON EVERYTHING I DO

History
A 24-year-old man presents to casualty having got into a fight as he thought he was
being watched and felt threatened. He appears to have fractured his thumb but is
reluctant to let you examine him or order an X-ray. He looks suspicious and wary. When
asked about his concerns he says that over the last few months he has been carefully
monitored by government agencies. He has been hearing a voice out loud giving a
running commentary on his thoughts and these are being broadcast to the government.
Any machine enables the government to get inside his head and the voice is telling him
it would be unwise to face the X-ray machine. The voice is not one that he recognizes
and it is sometimes derogatory telling him he is stupid for giving his thoughts away for
free. Initially the voice came and went but over the last few weeks it is present almost
constantly and he cannot always sleep because even when he sleeps the voice comments
on what he is thinking. He is exhausted.
The man is absolutely convinced that the government is after him but he cannot explain
why. There is no previous history and he denies any substance use. Until a few weeks ago
he had been working as a kitchen assistant but was sacked for leaving jobs unfinished.
There is no family history of any psychiatric illness.

Mental state examination
The man looks unkempt. He is wary and looks quite frightened and agitated. His eye
contact is fleeting and he constantly looks around him in a perplexed manner.
His speech is rambling and he does not express himself coherently. He occasionally uses
words that you have not heard before and repeats them as though they have some
significance. He does not come across as depressed. He has delusions of persecution. He
has auditory hallucinations that provide a running commentary on every aspect of his
behaviour. He has thought broadcast and thought withdrawal. He is orientated in person,
but unclear about the time. He seems aware that he is in hospital but not quite sure why.

Questions
• What is the likely differential diagnosis in this case?
• What is the significance of the running commentary?
• What other symptoms may be commonly associated with this type of auditory
hallucination?

37

ANSWER 15
The differential diagnosis is schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-related
psychosis and organic medical conditions. To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the
symptoms and signs should be present for at least 1 month (as per ICD-10 criteria) and
impact upon social and occupational or educational functioning. The following are
usually present: delusions, hallucinations, formal thought disorder, ‘negative’ symptoms
and abnormal behaviour.
A delusion is a firmly-held idea that a person has despite clear and obvious evidence that
it is untrue. Common delusions in schizophrenia include:

• Delusions of control – belief that one’s thoughts or actions are being controlled by

•
•
•
•
•

outside, alien forces (passivity). Common delusions of control include thought
broadcasting where private thoughts are being broadcast or transmitted to others,
thought insertion (thoughts being planted in their heads) or thought withdrawal
(thoughts being taken from their heads). Thought passivity is the terminology used
to describe control of one’s thoughts.
Delusional perception – a real perception triggering a sudden delusional belief.
Delusions of persecution – belief that others are wanting to do the individual harm.
These persecutory delusions often involve bizarre ideas and plots.
Delusions of reference – a neutral environmental event is believed to have a special
and personal meaning. For example, a person with schizophrenia might believe an
innocuous phrase on TV is intended to send a message meant specifically for them.
Delusions of grandeur – belief that one is a famous or important figure or the belief
that one has unusual powers.
Somatic delusions are false beliefs about your body – for example, that a terrible
physical illness exists or that something foreign is inside or passing through the body.

Hallucinations can be experienced in any of the sensory modalities and include:

• Auditory hallucinations (hearing voices in external space that other people cannot
hear). Certain types of auditory hallucination are diagnostic of schizophrenia. These
include hearing voices providing a running commentary on the person’s behaviour
or thoughts, two or more voices conversing with each other in the third person
about the person, or if the individual hears his thoughts being echoed back.
• Somatic hallucinations (these suggest schizophrenia or an organic cause).
• Visual hallucinations (seeing things that are not there or that other people cannot see).
• Tactile, olfactory or gustatory hallucinations.
Formal thought disorder is a persistent underlying disturbance of conscious thought that
is usually seen through spoken and written communication. This involves fragmented
thinking experienced by the listener as being ‘ununderstandable’ or the train of thought
or associations between statements is disconnected. They may respond to queries with an
unrelated answer, start sentences with one topic and end somewhere different, speak
incoherently, or say illogical things. There may be ongoing disjointed or rambling
monologues in which a person seems to be talking to himself/herself or imagined people
or voices. People with schizophrenia tend to have trouble concentrating. Some use
neologisms, which are made-up words or phrases that only have meaning to the patient,
or they exhibit perseveration, which involves the repetition of words and statements.
Catatonic behaviour is sometimes present.
Negative symptoms reflect the reduction or absence of mental function and include
reduced motivation, reduced use of speech and affective flattening.
38

KEY POINTS

• Schneider’s first rank symptoms described in 1939 remain the cornerstone of the
diagnosis of schizophrenia. They include:
• Thought insertion, thought withdrawal and thought broadcasting.
• Running commentary, third person auditory hallucinations and thought echo.
• Delusional perception, passivity phenomena, delusions of control and somatic
hallucinations.

CASE 16:

I ONLY SMOKED A BIT OF CANNABIS AND TOOK
A COUPLE OF Es

History
A 21-year-old man presents in an extremely frightened state. He is absolutely convinced
that he has been followed and his life is at risk. When walking through town he was sure
people were watching him, talking about him and planning how to kill him. He can trust
no one including his friends. He has come to the hospital rather than go to the police
because he believes the police are behind the conspiracy. He believes they have installed
surveillance cameras in his flat and have been watching him. He feels others are jealous
of his talents and success. He is convinced he has special powers and that is how he found
out about the plots against him. He has had to start carrying a knife so he can protect
himself from all his enemies.
The man has had no previous contact with psychiatric services and he has no medical
history of note. All was well until the last few days. His sister recalls that about six weeks
ago her brother and a few friends went to a music festival. She is aware that his friends
have smoked cannabis and taken Ecstasy (E) but she thinks it is unlikely that her brother
joined them. He does not smoke and has no prescribed medications.
The man is about to begin his final year at university. He has been studying physics and
philosophy at university. He and his girlfriend finished their relationship just before the
music festival. It was a reasonably amicable break up, but had been a three year intense
relationship. His interests include music and computer games. He has a good group of
friends although over the last few days he has been avoiding them as he feels threatened
by them.

Mental state examination
He is clearly frightened and suspicious, constantly looking around and trying to check
what is going on. He makes intense eye contact when not looking elsewhere. He struggles
to focus on the interview. His speech is rapid and his thoughts are not coherent. He jumps
around from topic to topic. His mood is labile in that at times he seems to settle down
but then quickly becomes alert and appears to be overactive. He has delusions of
persecution and rather grandiose ideas about his own skills. He has auditory
hallucinations, which tell him that he should kill if he needs to. He thinks the cameras in
his house are being used to monitor his thoughts but he does not quite have thought
withdrawal. He does not have any self-harm ideation. He is orientated in person in that
he knows who he is, but he is not orientated in time or place. His short-term memory is
poor and his long-term recall is variable as he is easily distracted.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you manage this man?

41

ANSWER 16
The differential diagnosis includes organic psychosis (given his age and recent
circumstances drug-induced psychosis would be a high possibility), schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder. Brief reactive psychosis may also be worth considering. In a reactive
psychosis psychotic symptoms may arise suddenly in response to a major stress, such as
a death in the family or other important change of circumstances. Symptoms can be
severe, but the person makes a quick recovery in only a few days.
With the short time frame it is likely that he has drug-induced psychosis. The acute
management involves managing his risk. There is a moderate to high risk of him harming
someone given his persecutory delusions. The fact that he thinks he is being watched and
that his thoughts may be monitored means careful ongoing review is required to monitor
his mental state. Given his delusions and the level of risk, hospitalization would be likely
and medication may be necessary.
Using (or withdrawing from) drugs and alcohol can cause psychotic symptoms.
Sometimes these symptoms will rapidly disappear when the drug is out of the system and
the acute biochemical changes wear off. Psychotic symptoms usually occur during or
shortly after (within four weeks) the use the substance. For some individuals, a
predisposition to psychotic illness is triggered by the use of substances, particularly those
that make more dopamine available at receptor sites such as amphetamines. However a
range of other drugs may cause psychosis including alcohol, cannabis, LSD, cocaine,
MDMA (Ecstasy) and withdrawal from benzodiazepines.
Although substance misuse is very common, severe adverse reactions are much less
common. Those at risk of developing problems should abstain altogether.
KEY POINTS

• Drug-induced psychosis is usually brief but those who develop problems are at risk of
developing the same symptoms if use continues.

• Some people with a vulnerability to schizophrenia may precipitate psychotic symptoms
with substance use.

CASE 17:

UNUSUAL PERSECUTORY BELIEFS

History
A 23-year-old electrical goods salesman attends his general practitioner surgery with his
mother. He is very articulate but reluctant to talk insisting that only the police can really
help him. He explains that over the past 6 months his boss and his colleagues have
conspired against him. Initially this was to dismiss him from his job but over the past few
weeks to kill him. He feels that they have been monitoring his activities and have even
gone to the extent of bugging his flat and tapping his mobile phone. He is absolutely
convinced of this and shows you some marks on the phone as evidence of it having been
tampered with.
He insists, politely, that he will not allow a physical examination as this may present an
opportunity to implant a microchip. In fact he is very worried that an old dental filling
may be a transmitting device. He is preoccupied with these thoughts and is unable to
distract himself. At work he feels constantly bombarded by his colleagues’ nasty
comments about him. He can hear them clearly even across the showroom. On one
occasion he clearly heard derogatory voices from his manager’s office on the other side
of the building. He also knows that colleagues talk about him because of the way the
price labels are arranged. His work has been affected. His boss has given him a
performance warning and he sees this as further evidence of his boss’s antipathy towards
him. He feels that ‘direct action’ is now needed but he refuses to discuss this. He has
contacted the police who have spoken to his colleagues. His mother indicates that the
police say his colleagues admitted talking about him because his behaviour has been
strange, but according to the police the charges of conspiracy are baseless and they have
asked him to seek psychiatric help. His mother feels that his concerns are ‘over the top’
but does not feel that her son is ‘psychotic’. She feels that he is under a lot of stress
following a break-up with his girlfriend 6 months ago and pressure at work. His mother
requests medication for him. He flatly refuses, but says that he will consider it if you
‘endorse’ his letter to the local MP and the Prime Minister about the refusal of the local
police to help him.

Questions
• How do you establish the diagnosis?
• How do you deal with his request?
• What do you tell the mother?

43

ANSWER 17
This man has a fixed belief that his colleagues are trying to kill him. Establishing that this
idea is delusional involves proving that the belief is false or even if true held on false
grounds (for example, believing that colleagues are talking about him based on the
arrangement of price labels). The belief is fixed and firmly held despite provision of
evidence to the contrary and this is out of cultural norms. Gently challenging these ideas
by providing evidence that is contradictory is vital in establishing the delusional nature of
the belief. Providing alternative explanations, such as ‘could the marks on the phone be
accidental damage?’, is an important part of history taking. So is further elucidation – ‘I
find it difficult to understand how a dental filling could act as a transmitter?’ He has firm
conviction in the delusional idea. Assessment of other dimensions such as preoccupation,
interference with work and acting out reveal that he is preoccupied with these ideas and
that this is affecting his work and that he is planning to act in response to his delusional
ideas by ‘direct action’. He is also hearing the voice of his colleagues across the showroom.
Hallucinations have the quality of a true perception and occur in the absence of a real
stimulus. It will be important to discover whether these are true hallucinations by verifying
information about the showroom, the nature and content of the voices, and other
examples that may be more clear-cut, such as hearing voices from a distant room while
in the toilet. He has been experiencing culturally inappropriate and implausible delusions
and apparent persistent auditory hallucinations for more than a month and therefore meets
the diagnosis for schizophrenia.
His request involves colluding with his delusional ideas which may secure short-term
gains, but in the long-term it will betray his trust and damage therapeutic engagement.
Empathizing with the true distress he is experiencing on account of his symptoms and
offering to help him deal with his distress (even if there is disagreement about what is
causing that distress) is likely to secure a better therapeutic rapport. However, he has
mentioned ‘direct action’ and this will require a detailed risk assessment exploring both
ideas of self-harm and of violence. If this direct action is proposed against his colleagues,
the police should be informed even if it involves breach of confidentiality. In any case,
an urgent referral to the local psychiatry team is indicated.
His mother is very worried for him and is probably concerned about the label of
schizophrenia or psychotic illness. Providing education about the illness, providing
leaflets, signposting to a patients’/carers’ group or to a website such as
www.rcpsych.ac.uk or www.rethink.org are likely to reduce expressed emotion (excessive
hostility, criticism or over-involvement) in the mother. Expressed emotion is a known
negative prognostic factor and risk factor for relapse.
KEY POINTS

• Assessing delusions involves gentle challenging to establish firm conviction in the belief
and assessing other dimensions such as acting out.

• Collusion with delusional ideas damages therapeutic engagement.
• Psychoeducation and engagement with carers is important to reduce expressed emotion.

ABDOMINAL PAIN IN GENERAL PRACTICE

History
A 26-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with a complaint of abdominal
pain. She has recently registered with this practice and is not known to this GP. She says
that she has been experiencing discomfort in the epigastric region for the past 2 months
and also complains of being bloated and being ‘full of gas’. A year ago she had been referred
to the specialist by her previous GP. She was investigated and an ultrasound examination
of the abdomen revealed gallstones. She then underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic
cholecystectomy but has continued to experience the same pain. She says that the pain is
present all the time and is not related to any particular foods. She complains of fatigue and
breathlessness on minimal effort. She has been suffering from chronic back pain over the
past 6 years. She had been seen by an orthopaedic specialist and underwent a magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the spine but no abnormality was detected. She attends
regular physiotherapy sessions and has been using codeine phosphate 60 mg (up to four
times a day) over the last 5 years. She has also presented on several occasions with bilateral
knee pains and again investigations and specialist advice was that there was no serious
illness with a recommendation of normal exercise and good nutrition.
She is a single mother of two children aged 6 and 3 years. She lives in a two bedroomed
council flat, is unemployed and receives benefits. She has previously worked in a
supermarket, a factory and a pub but did not hold any of the jobs for more than 6 months.
Her relationship with the previous two partners (the fathers of the children) was volatile.
Both partners had alcohol problems and were abusive towards her. She does not have any
contact with her family and did not want to speak about them.
Examination of previous notes reveals that she has been a frequent attendee at her
general practice. She has been investigated for urinary tract infections on several
occasions but no evidence of infection has been found. She was referred to a
gynaecologist at age of 18 with complaints of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia and was
investigated for an ovarian cyst, and was given reassurance.
There is no previous psychiatric history. She smokes 20 cigarettes per day and drinks 10
units of alcohol per week. She has never used illicit drugs.

Mental state examination
She makes intense eye contact. She is dressed in bright clothes, talks about her symptoms
animatedly and describes them in great detail. She is preoccupied with her various
symptoms. She states that she feels low in her mood and admits that she finds it difficult
to cope with her children. She has no thoughts of self-harm or suicide. She believes that
the doctors have not been able to diagnose her problems and that she has been suffering
due to their incompetence. She wants to be referred to a specialist for her abdominal pain.
Physical examination
There is no guarding or rigidity but she winces visibly on palpation of the abdomen. No
other abnormality is detected.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?

45

ANSWER 18
This woman has symptoms suggestive of somatization disorder. She has multiple,
recurrent and frequently changing physical symptoms that have been present for more
than 2 years. She has undergone various investigations which have not been able to
account for her numerous physical problems. She is preoccupied with her symptoms and
has had multiple consultations with various health professionals. She has gastrointestinal
symptoms (abdominal pain), cardiovascular symptoms (dyspnoea), genitourinary
symptoms (investigations for urinary tract infection) and symptoms of pain. In patients
suffering from this disorder there is often a refusal to accept reassurance that there is no
medical reason for symptoms. Differential diagnoses to be considered include the
following:

• Medical illnesses: Illnesses that may explain the patient’s symptoms should always
be ruled out before a diagnosis of somatization disorder is made.

• Depressive disorders: Patients with depressive disorder may experience somatic
symptoms. This may particularly be a problem in people who have an inability to
express emotions (alexithymia).
• Anxiety disorders: Symptoms of anxiety related to autonomic arousal can be
mistaken for somatization. The autonomic nervous system itself can generate a
range of real physical symptoms.
• Hypochondriacal disorder: In hypochondriasis there is a preoccupation with the fear
of having a serious physical disease and often the patient refers to a particular
illness by name.
• Intentional production of physical or psychological symptoms for assuming a sick
role (factitious disorder/Munchausen’s syndrome) or for external purposes due to
economic or legal reasons (malingering).
Detailed examination of previous medical notes to check the frequency of contact with
health professionals and results of previous investigations help clarify the diagnosis.
Relevant investigations may be needed to rule out physical illnesses that might explain
the current symptoms. Patients should be dealt with in a sensitive manner without
apportioning blame. It is important to reassure her that somatization does not imply that
she is faking these symptoms. Some clinicians explain it as a close connection between
mind and body, where stress in one domain can be experienced readily as real symptoms
in another. A multidisciplinary approach would be required with emphasis on good
communication between various professionals. Further follow-up should be with a single
identified professional and it is important to discourage unscheduled appointments. The
goal should be to build a rapport with the patient so that she is able to gain more insight
into her symptoms and focus on any emotional triggers. The patient should always be
informed before making a referral to a psychiatrist. Co-morbid depressive disorder may
be treated with antidepressant medication and cognitive behaviour therapy may help with
depression, anxiety or somatization.
KEY POINTS

• Multiple somatic symptoms may indicate depression, anxiety or rarely somatization
disorder.

• Rule out medical illness, malingering and factitious disorder (Munchausen’s syndrome).
• Avoid over investigation and ensure all specialist reports are conveyed to all involved in
treatment.

CASE 19:

A DRINK A DAY TO KEEP MY PROBLEMS AT BAY

History
A 54-year-old man presents with abdominal pain for several days. The pain is a constant
dull ache which is central and radiates to the right. He has had some associated vomiting
but the vomit is usually bile as he has not been eating well. He has on a few occasions
vomited some blood (haematemesis) but says that this was after particularly heavy
consumption of alcohol. He is not aware how many units he drinks in a week but
reluctantly admits he drinks every day. His breakfast often consists of a drink as he feels
very shaky otherwise. Once he has had a drink he feels better able to manage the day
ahead. He lives alone in a bed sit and eats poorly.
He says he was sacked for taking time off work for physical complaints. He has been
separated from his wife for six months and no longer has regular contact with his
children who he says have turned against him. The marriage had been difficult for some
years because he was unable to hold down a regular job. He held a middle manager’s post
until he turned 50. Since then he has had a series of short-term junior posts. He believes
that this is as a result of changes in local government and not related to his drinking.

Physical examination
He has a ruddy complexion, several spider naevi on his face and red palms. He has a body
mass index of 32. He is slightly tender in the right hypochondrium and lumbar regions
and in the epigastric region of his abdomen.
Mental state examination
He smells of alcohol. He is reasonably well-dressed. He looks unwell and is clearly
uncomfortable. He has good eye contact. His speech is normal. He admits he has felt low
as his life has deteriorated over the last few months but says he is not ‘depressed’. He can
still enjoy himself and is reactive at interview. He does not have any self-harm ideation.
He has little hope for the future. There is no evidence of psychosis.
He is orientated in time, place and person. His short-term memory is poor but there are
no long-term memory problems.

Questions
• What might his LFTs show?
• What are questions associated with the CAGE questionnaire?
• What are the features of alcohol dependence?
• What are the physical complications of alcohol problems?
47

ANSWER 19
His liver function tests are likely to show:

• Elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) also known as alanine transaminase.
• Elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) also known as aspartate transaminase
(2 to 4 fold).

• ALT usually greater than AST (ratio of greater than 2 suggests alcoholic liver
disease).

• A switch to AST greater than ALT may indicate cirrhosis.
• Likely to be elevations of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline
phosphatase and ferritin.
LFTS in this man’s case were:

The CAGE questionnaire
This asks the following key questions:
1. Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?
2. Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
3. Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking?
4. Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get
rid of a hangover (eye-opener)?

The threshold for the CAGE suggesting potential problems is 2 out of 4. It is clear in this
case that this man has a significant problem. The following signs and symptoms strongly
suggest alcohol dependence syndrome:
1 Strong desire to take alcohol with a narrowed repertoire of drinking.
2 Dominance of drinking over other responsibilities.
3 Tolerance to alcohol, that is needing more and more alcohol to produce the same
effects.
4 Physiological withdrawal state if alcohol is reduced or ceased.
5 Use of alcohol to prevent withdrawal.
6 Preoccupation with alcohol use and compulsion to drink.
7 Return to drinking even after periods of abstinence.
8 Persistence of alcohol use despite the harmful effects (may be physical, social or
emotional).
There is often co-morbidity with other mental illnesses such as depression, social anxiety,
anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, other substance misuse and personality disorders.
The physical complications of alcohol misuse include liver disease such as fatty liver,
alcoholic hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis. High blood pressure and other cardiac problems
48

can occur especially if drinking is compounded by poor diet, low exercise and obesity.
There is increased likelihood of cancer of the liver, stomach, colon, rectum, lung,
pancreas, larynx and oesophagus. Pancreatitis, epileptic seizures and sexual dysfunction
are also common. Abrupt abstinence in someone with alcohol dependence syndrome can
lead to delirium tremens, which includes shaking, sweating, diarrhoea and seizures as
well as hallucinations and an acute confusional state (see Case 25). This requires urgent
medical attention as it can be life threatening.
Other physical signs in acute intoxication are slurred speech, dizziness, clumsiness,
unsteadiness, blackouts, collapse and somnolence. Weight loss can occur with poor
nutrition, or in end-stage disease. Peptic ulceration and pancreatitis can lead to
abdominal pain. The skin can often give tell-tale signs including redness in the face or
cheeks, rhinophyma, palmar erythema, hand ‘liver flap’ and numbness or tingling of the
fingers. Malnutrition and pseudo-Cushings can also create distinctive changes.
It is common for social problems and family dysfunction to go hand in hand with alcohol
dependence. This is clearly the case with this man.
KEY POINTS

• Alcohol misuse has a range of physical, social and psychiatric complications.
• Listen carefully to how the CAGE questions are answered as many may be less than
forthcoming.

• A significant number of acute medical admissions are directly or indirectly related to
alcohol (including in the elderly).

CASE 20:

PARACETAMOL OVERDOSE

History
A 24-year-old woman presents having taken an impulsive overdose of 30 paracetamol
tablets. Earlier in the evening she had been drinking and ended up in an argument with
her boyfriend. She returned home and thought about the evening. She felt very angry and
unhappy and impulsively took the overdose. She is sure she did not take anything else.
There is no suicide note and about half an hour after taking the overdose she called a
friend who called an ambulance. She regrets the overdose and up until the argument with
her boyfriend had not had any problems or issues that worried her. As a teenager she had
a spell when she used to cut herself but this has not happened for at least eight years.
She has not taken any previous overdoses. She is rather embarrassed and upset.
Mental state examination
Her eye contact is normal. She looks well. Her speech is normal. She has no thought
disorder. Her mood is stable and there is no current deliberate self-harm ideation. She
does not express any feelings of hopelessness. She can enjoy herself and she has plans
for the future. She has no evidence of any delusions or hallucinations. She has good
insight into what has happened.
Questions
• What investigations, if any, would you do?
• How would you manage her?

51

ANSWER 20
The key questions are:

• Is the patient presenting after a single or staggered overdose?
• What is the time of the ingestion?
• What are the blood tests showing?
An overdose of paracetamol (especially if greater than 7.5 g which is usually 15 tablets)
that presents within one hour is treated using charcoal, which reduces gastrointestinal
absorption. Early presentation of a paracetamol overdose is easier to manage than late
presentations. If presentation is between 1-4 hours a blood test is required after 4 hours
of ingestion to assess the levels of paracetamol. If there is any doubt about the drugs
taken, it is always safest to err on the side of caution. Emergency departments have charts
showing the relationships between blood levels and lengths of time since ingestion, and
thresholds for further treatment. Access to TOXBASE, the primary clinical toxicology
database of the National Poisons Information Service, is available online in all NHS
hospitals and can be consulted for all up to date protocols in managing cases of overdose
and poisoning.
Patients at increased risk of liver damage from lower blood levels of paracetamol include:

• Regular alcohol intake above recommended levels (14 units for women and 21
for men).

• Regular use of enzyme inducing drugs (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin).
• Conditions including glutathione depletion (such as HIV, cystic fibrosis, eating
disorders).
Hepatocyte damage can occur from metabolites of paracetamol breakdown including
N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, leading to liver failure. If the blood test after 4 hours
indicates the need for treatment or there is uncertainty about the time of ingestion and
or the amount taken, the treatment is intravenous N-acetylcysteine. This replenishes
glutathione, important in conjugating the damaging metabolites. Oral methionine can
also be used for the same purpose.
In this case, she will require a blood test and may need treatment with N-acetylcysteine.
A psychiatric assessment the day after overdose is common practice to plan any
supportive interventions that might be necessary. This may include simple medical
follow-up, individual therapy, group, family work or pharmacotherapy. One clear issue
for this woman relates to her coping ability under adversity. The opportunity to provide
supportive psychoeducation should not be missed.
KEY POINTS

• Paracetamol overdoses are the most common overdoses with many patients not
knowing the potential liver complications, including liver failure and death.

• It is always important to conduct a detailed mental state examination and consider
referral for psychiatric assessment if the reasons for the overdose appear trivial.

• Early presentation of paracetamol overdose is less complicated than late presentations.

52

CASE 21:

SPIDER PHOBIA

History
A 20 year-old woman comes to see her general practitioner saying that a fear of spiders
is causing her significant problems. When she sees a spider she becomes fearful. She
sweats, shakes and her heart rate increases. She needs to get out of the room very quickly
and requires family members to come and remove the spider. She cannot re-enter the
room until she is certain the spider is gone. She cannot sleep in a room if she has seen a
spider there and could not go on two school trips because of worries about encountering
a spider.
She has been offered a job in a hotel as an apprentice domestic supervisor. She is keen
to take it, but does not think she can do the job with her fears. She is also thinking of
committing to a new relationship and up until now her family have helped her solve her
problems. She has not revealed the extent of her difficulties to her boyfriend. She requests
diazepam tablets, because her aunt uses these for her fear of aeroplanes, and believes
them to be effective for phobias.

Mental state examination
When she comes in it is noticeable that she is on edge. She scans the room quickly and
explains later that this was to check for spiders and that she does this routinely. Once she
has done this she is relaxed and discusses her fears. She explains that they are ‘irrational’
and she knows that most spiders are harmless, but nevertheless experiences very intense
anxiety. She has no evidence of other mental illness and no symptoms or signs of
psychosis or depression.
Questions
• What do you say in reply to her request for diazepam?
• What is the treatment of choice?

53

ANSWER 21
Medication would not be used with spider phobia. Dependency is common with
benzodiazepines.
The treatment of choice for spider phobia is cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). This
involves desensitization where exposure leads to habituation. A hierarchy of feared
situations is built up, and client and therapist work their way through this hierarchy. This
may, for example, begin with pictures, plastic spiders, cartoons and videos, and move on
to dead and then live spiders. Different sized spiders can be used. At first these may be
in jars or Perspex boxes, then they may be put onto the table or into the therapist’s hands.
Many therapists will finish by putting a live spider on the table, teaching the client to
cover it with a jar, sealing the jar with a card and then depositing the spider outside. The
therapy can also lead to people touching live spiders, letting them run on their hands or
using a ‘spider hoover’ to catch and deposit them outside. The end goal is usually
mutually agreed and reviewed as it may change when therapy progresses.
Cognitively, the therapist may use psychoeducation explaining how humans are
genetically programmed to fear certain shapes (as part of natural selection). Discussion
about the purpose of fear and a systematic assessment of the dangerousness of spiders
compared to other creatures (bees, wasps, rats etc.) can help in the appraisal of threat.
Personification of the spider as vulnerable (as opposed to threatening) and an
understanding of how the human mind automatically interprets the body language of a
spider as threatening, can all help. A rational understanding of changes in fear after
habituation goes hand in hand with the behavioural strategies and desensitization.
Finally, the woman’s memories of not coping in the presence of spiders needs to be
replaced through therapy and supplemented with many new experiences of coping. Much
can be done in sessions, but homework also allows the client to see that they can cope
on their own without help. The therapy should provide plenty of healthy experiences of
coping with spiders that establish confidence.
KEY POINTS

• Spider phobia is common.
• Benzodiazepines can lead to dependence and are not usually used in most phobias.
• Cognitive behaviour therapy is the treatment of choice.

54

CASE 22:

DÉJÀ VU AND AMNESIA

History
A 32-year-old-man presents with a several month history of strange experiences. He
occasionally has a strange metallic taste sensation, which may last for a few seconds up
to about a minute. He then has experiences that are difficult to describe. He imagines it
is a bit like an out of body experience. There are times he has a feeling that everything
around him is a repeat but at other times even familiar people and features completely
baffle him. After some minutes he is himself again but is often slightly disorientated and
is often told that he has behaved rather oddly, for example, repeating automatic actions
such as lip smacking. He himself has no memory of this. There is a sense of something
having been lost but he is not quite sure what. These episodes are increasing in frequency
and his behaviour more strange during them, which is the reason for seeking help now.
Another feature that has worried him is that recently he has experienced auditory
hallucinations. The hallucination does not last long, but is frightening. He has now
become aware that the metallic taste and auditory hallucination precede the episodes and
behaviours he cannot remember. He has not been witnessed collapsing or having any
tonic or clonic type body movements. Over the last few months he has also had quite
severe headaches but these do not coincide with the episodes described earlier.
There is no previous medical history of note and he has not recently experienced any
trauma. He has no family history of psychotic experiences or seizures. He is not on any
medication of any sort.

Mental state examination and physical examination
He is well-presented and neither physical nor mental state examination reveal any
abnormalities.
Questions
• What is the most likely explanation in this case?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What investigation is likely to be the most useful?

55

ANSWER 22
The most likely explanation is temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with complex partial seizures.
The features of seizures beginning in the temporal lobe vary from patient to patient in
length and intensity but certain patterns are common. These auras are called simple
partial seizures and occur in about three quarters of people with TLE. They occur while
consciousness is maintained. There may be a mixture of different feelings, emotions,
thoughts, and experiences, which may be familiar (sense of déjà vu) or completely foreign
(jamais vu). Hallucinations of voices, music, people, smells, or tastes may occur. A simple
seizure or aura can evolve to more complex or generalized seizures, where consciousness
is impaired. Auras may last for just a few seconds, or may continue as long as a minute
or two. If they spread to local areas in the temporal lobes they become complex partial
seizures. About 40% to 80% of people with TLE perform repetitive, automatic movements
(called automatisms), such as lip smacking and rubbing the hands together. Some people
have only simple partial seizures and never have a change in consciousness. In about
60% of people with TLE, the seizures spread leading to a grand mal seizure. After the
complex partial seizure or secondarily generalized seizure, patients are often confused for
several minutes and then gradually recover.

!

Differential Diagnosis

• There are several other possible things to consider in differential diagnosis.

•

•
•

Consider, absence seizures. These have classical three per second spike and wave
patterns on EEG. They are shorter, have no aura, no post-ictal confusion and are
not associated with complex automatisms.
Frontal lobe complex partial seizures appear in clusters of brief seizures with
abrupt onset and ending. There is a minimal post-ictal state. They may cause
behavioural changes with vocalizations and complex motor and sometimes sexual
automatisms. In differentiating from TLE, there may need to be EEG localization.
Panic attacks can present in strange ways and need to be considered.
Occipital lobe epilepsy may spread to the temporal lobe and be clinically
indistinguishable from a temporal lobe seizure.

The temporal lobes are the most common location for the origin of partial seizures, which
start in one localized area. TLE can start at almost any age. Some follow a head injury or
an infection that affects the brain, such as meningitis, but for the vast majority the cause
is unknown. There may also be other underlying causes such as a tumour or vascular
malformation. EEG can confirm the diagnosis but false negatives are common. MRI can
help in localizing seizure focus.
Information and individual and family support to adjust is helpful. Medication is usually
required to treat the epilepsy and the majority do well on the following drugs:
carbamazepine, sodium valproate, topiramate, lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine. Surgery is
an option for intractable epilepsy.
KEY POINTS

• TLE may masquerade as psychosis or severe anxiety.
• Episodic illness should arouse strong suspicion of TLE.

56

CASE 23:

SELF-HARMING, SUBSTANCE MISUSE AND
VOLATILE RELATIONSHIPS

History
A 19-year-old woman with a 6-year history of self-harm attends the emergency
department. Her self-harm is usually in the form of cutting, but every few weeks when
she feels things are getting on top of her, she takes an overdose. The overdoses are usually
impulsive and precipitated by a row with her boyfriend or mother. The relationship with
the boyfriend is volatile and the police have been called out on more than one occasion
when things have become heated and violent. The woman has alleged domestic violence
but then retracts her allegations so that the police are unable to take action against her
boyfriend. There is also a long history of substance misuse, usually alcohol but she has
also dabbled in all sorts of illegal substances. When under the influence she has had
unprotected sex with men other than her boyfriend and has become pregnant on two
occasions. Both times she chose to end the pregnancy feeling that if she did not her
boyfriend would leave her. After each termination she had a period when she described
herself as ‘constantly suicidal’.
Mental state examination
Her eye contact is fleeting. She is distraught and shouting that she just wants to be left
alone so that she can kill herself. She is verbally abusive and threatening violence if she
is not given what she wants. She is irritable and agitated. She is unkempt and looks like
she has recently been in a fight. Her speech is rapid but coherent. Objectively her mood
is labile and subjectively she says that she is depressed and life is not worth living. She
says she is suicidal and wants to kill herself. She is angry as she feels she is being
thwarted in this. She says there is no point in living especially as her boyfriend has
broken up with her. There is no evidence of any psychotic features and she is orientated
in time place and person.

!

Personality disorder
People with personality disorders have experiences and behaviour that are markedly
outside their societal norms. This demonstrates itself in enduring ways impacting
upon relationships, interpersonal functioning, emotion regulation, affective
responses, impulse control, and attributions about self and others.

Questions
• Given the definition of a personality disorder above, does this person have a personality
disorder?
• What is the differential diagnosis?

57

ANSWER 23
The differential diagnosis is acute intoxication (alcohol/drugs), depression or emotionally
unstable personality disorder (EUPD), The most likely primary diagnosis is EUPD. An
alternative way of conceptualizing this involves the use of a multi-axial formulation that
considers not only diagnosis but psychosocial factors and development. It includes an
understanding of early life experiences and maladaptive coping and care seeking, as well
as any organic or intellectual factors. The rich explanatory power of multi-axial
classification systems makes them helpful for designing interventions. Very stressful or
chaotic childhoods are commonly reported (for example, physical and sexual abuse,
neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental loss or separation). This often means that the
features leading to the presentation are longstanding so long-term therapeutic
interventions may be helpful. Multi-axial systems used in adulthood and childhood are
slightly different (see Case 77).

!

Multi-axial classification (DSM)

•
•
•
•
•

Axis 1 – Clinical disorder
Axis 2 – Personality and intellectual
Axis 3 – Medical or physical condition
Axis 4 – Psychosocial and environmental
Axis 5 – Global functioning

This is slightly different from the multi-axial classification used in childhood
– see Case 77.

The first step in management involves calming her down so a proper assessment of such
factors can take place. A risk assessment is crucial because her safety is a concern. The
social support available will need exploration. Even if she is not actively suicidal,
admission may be unavoidable as there is a risk that she could harm herself in this
volatile state.
EUPD is a condition characterized by impulsive actions, rapidly shifting moods, and
chaotic relationships. There are two types (impulsive and borderline type). With both of
these there is:

• impulsivity without thought of the consequences (for example, unprotected sex or
dangerous substance abuse)

• lack of self-control with outbursts of intense anger or violence.
The impulsive type is characterized by emotional instability and an inability to control
impulses, with episodes of threatening behaviour and violence occurring particularly in
response to criticism by others.
The borderline type is also characterized by emotional instability. People with this type
of personality disorder may experience severe doubts about their self-image, aims and
sexual preferences that cause upset and distress. It is common to experience a strong and
debilitating sense of emptiness and this can lead to self-harm and suicide threats. They
are liable to become involved in intense but unstable relationships with regular emotional
crises. Completed suicide occurs in around 8–10% of individuals with this disorder, and
self-mutilation acts (for example, cutting or burning) and suicide threats and attempts are
very common. Recurrent job losses and broken marriages are common.
58

Co-morbidity with mood disorders, substance misuse, eating disorders (usually bulimia)
or PTSD is common. This disorder is more frequent in females than males.
Emotional instability and impulsivity are very common in adolescents, but most
adolescents grow out of this behaviour. Personality disorder diagnoses are not made in
adolescence because of the ongoing development of personality and the stigmatizing
nature of the diagnosis. It should therefore only be carefully and cautiously applied. This
disorder, like all personality disorders, is usually worse in the young adult years and
gradually decreases with age. Into the 30s and beyond, the majority of individuals have
attained greater stability in their relationships and working lives.
KEY POINTS

• The diagnosis of personality disorder requires detailed longitudinal history and should
not be made on the basis of one interview.

• This disorder often presents through self-harm and suicidal threats but impulsive
behaviour is common across various spheres of life.

• Individuals with this disorder have often had chaotic childhoods and have inappropriate
social supports and coping mechanisms. Interventions are best directed towards
remedying these limitations rather than with pharmacotherapy.

CASE 24:

MY HUSBAND WON’T LET ME GO OUT

History
A 23-year-old woman comes to see the general practitioner with her mother. She has
been married for four years. Her mother has brought her because she was in two minds
about whether to come. She is worried that it may make the problem worse. The GP
realizes quickly that he is going to need more than 10 minutes and has one other patient
left. He sees this other patient first in another consultation suite and returns in order to
give more time for the discussion. The woman is in tears when he returns and describes
that she loves her husband but that he is very possessive of her, and has never been happy
for her to go anywhere without him. He works on a computer during the day at a large
insurance firm. Despite having trained at college in Child Care she is not currently
working, mainly because her husband made it clear when they married that he wanted to
be the main breadwinner and did not wish for her to work. He likes to stay in and watch
television, and will usually drink a few cans of lager 3 or 4 nights a week. He does not
usually drink to excess.
She stopped her hobbies such as Salsa lessons and going out with friends when they
started seeing each other, about three months before they got married. He used to accuse
her of flirting if he ever saw her laughing or smiling with any other man and she began
to restrict who she spoke to as a means of avoiding this. She explains that about 6 months
ago her best friend, who he never really liked, began encouraging her to go out with a
group of four old school friends that meet at a Line Dancing group and go for a drink
and meal afterwards. Her husband was not keen, but let her go. When she returned he
was very suspicious and asked her numerous questions about what she had been doing
and whether she spoke to any other men. She considered not going any more, but with
the support of her best friend and mother, decided that she was doing no harm and that
he may get used to the idea. She went on four more occasions. On each occasion when
she returned he insisted on examining her underwear and was aggressive and abusive
calling her offensive names. After the most recent occasion he threw the contents of all
her drawers around the bedroom and forced her onto the bed shouting in her face. She
says she has never thought of involving the police.
She does not know what to do, because she feels that if she never goes out she will feel
trapped, but she cannot cope with his levels of suspicion and hostility. She thinks he
needs help but does not know what to do next. The woman’s mother says that she has
always been a quiet girl and endorses her daughter’s assertion that she has never been
nor would she ever be unfaithful. The mother says that her son-in-law can be sociable
and charming, but has always been controlling of her daughter. He has superficial friends
but no-one visits the house and he does not visit anyone else so far as they are aware.
He will sometimes have a drink with a work colleague on the way home, but never invites
his wife and has not brought this friend home.

Questions
• What are the possible causes and diagnoses?
• What might the GP suggest happens next?
• What treatments are available?

61

ANSWER 24
There are a few possibilities that should go through the GP’s mind. The first is that this
man has an alcohol problem and that over and above the drinking his wife sees he may
be secretly drinking a lot more. This would amount to alcohol dependence syndrome (see
Case 19). Alcohol-induced symptoms may also include psychotic symptoms such as
hallucinosis or alcoholic jealousy.
It is more likely that he has a dissocial or paranoid personality disorder.

!

Paranoid personality

•
•
•

•
•

Excessive sensitivity to setbacks
Tendency to bear grudges
Automatic tendency to see neutral events as negative
Tendency to centre on the self/narcissism
Recurrent unfounded suspicions of infidelity or betrayal
Tendency to see conspiracy where there is none

If of delusional intensity, pathological jealousy could be a delusional disorder (see Case 53).
This is characterized by a strongly held and persistent delusion. It is not the same as
schizophrenia since it is not accompanied by all the other first rank symptoms of
schizophrenia such as thought passivity, auditory hallucinations, thought disorder and
‘negative’ symptoms of schizophrenia. It would be important to exclude other disorders such
as psychosis, depression or an anxiety disorder but these do not stand out from the history.
It is possible he has undiagnosed Asperger syndrome, meaning he makes serious misjudgements
about the motivations of others and that this leads to misinterpretations and paranoia.
Finally, it would be important to ask about past history and physical symptoms to see if
there is any change in behaviour or symptoms and signs that might lead to consideration
of a physical illness such a space-occupying lesion. Again this is not a high possibility
but should be considered.
What happens next is not straightforward since the man in question is unaware that his
wife has visited the surgery. There are no grounds for breaking confidentiality at this
point although that may change in the future. The woman should be advised that were
he to become physically abusive it would be appropriate to call the police. She should be
given information about any local women’s refuges and any domestic violence services.
A confidential anonymised discussion with social services and other partners may be
helpful. Enquiries as to whether any trusted male members of the family may be able to
approach her husband and suggest he seeks help may also be helpful.
The woman herself may have mental health needs and these should be considered. Does
she need to see a counsellor who could support her to work out a way of tackling the
problem? Relate (local marriage guidance counselling) will often see individuals within a
marriage in the first instance as a first step in finding solutions to such difficulties. It is
possible she could find an appropriate time to suggest that they go together. While the
problem is essentially his own, this shared approach may help him develop insight.
Finally, the pertinent question: ‘What keeps you together as a couple?’ may be helpful by
promoting thoughts about whether she wishes to stay in a relationship that is currently abusive.

62

KEY POINTS

• If it is possible to find a way of positively engaging people with pathological jealousy
it can prevent long-term unhappiness for their victims.

• Facilitating a mechanism of support (for example, counselling) can be crucial as it
•

prevents isolation and allows a rational perspective to be taken outside the context of
the relationship.
Families can and should use the police if individuals are at risk.

CASE 25:

INTENSELY FEARFUL HALLUCINATIONS

History
A 44-year-old man is admitted to an orthopaedics ward with a fracture of the femur
following a car accident. He is treated surgically and there are no postoperative
complications over the next 2 days. On the third day of the admission there is rapid
change in his behaviour and he becomes verbally aggressive towards the nursing staff.
He has been advised bed rest but tries to get up from his bed and is agitated. He is
sweating, has tremors in both hands and is shouting at the nursing staff. The nurses try
to restrain him but he resists actively. He is screaming that he can see snakes in the room
and is terrified. He is disorientated and believes that he is in his office rather than in
hospital. He is not able to recognize any of the doctors or nurses and becomes startled
when the doctor’s bleep goes off. He has a history of heavy alcohol use over the past 15
years. He does not have any other medical or psychiatric history.
Mental state examination
His eye contact is not good. He appears distracted and looks across your shoulder and
around the room. He is jittery and sweating, and is confused and disorientated. He is
experiencing visual hallucinations which appear to be vivid and well-formed. He is
terrified apparently in response to these hallucinations. He is labile in his behaviour
which changes rapidly with periods of increased agitation and restlessness when he
attempts to get off the bed. He has little understanding of what is happening to him and
is unable to discuss this in any meaningful way.
Physical examination
He has a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg and a pulse of 130/min. His oxygen saturation
in air is 98%. He is febrile with a temperature of 38.4ºC. He has coarse bilateral hand
tremors and the extremities are cold and clammy and he is clinically dehydrated. He has
palmar erythema.

Questions

• How would you manage this patient?
65

ANSWER 25
The patient is suffering with delirium tremens (DT). Around 5% of patients admitted to
hospital with alcohol related problems have DT. There is a significant associated mortality
at around 5%, and this is usually due to co-morbid medical illnesses like infections,
electrolyte imbalance and impaired liver and kidney functions. It occurs when a patient
dependent on alcohol suddenly stops or greatly reduces the alcohol intake. The typical
symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are tremulousness, perceptual abnormalities like visual
hallucinations that can be vivid and intense, withdrawal seizures, and impairment of
consciousness. Tremors develop within 6–8 hours, hallucinations within 12 hours and
seizures within 24 hours of cessation of drinking alcohol. DT typically develops by 72
hours post-cessation of alcohol use but can develop anytime within the first week. The
full-blown symptoms of DT include tremors of the body, clouding of consciousness,
restlessness with vivid and intense visual hallucinations. Patients can also experience
auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Other symptoms include fever, excessive
sweating, palpitations, nausea and vomiting. It may present in a sudden and dramatic
way in patients admitted to hospital with a problem unrelated to alcohol abuse. The
symptoms typically get worse at night. Patients can represent a difficult management
problem in acute medical wards due to their unpredictable behaviour and the risk of
acting out on perceptual abnormalities.

!

Differential diagnosis

• Acute confusional states may be caused by infections (pneunomia, urinary tract
•
•

infections, encephalitis), endocrine abnormalities (hypoglycaemia), metabolic
abnormalities (electrolyte imbalance ) or head injuries.
Wernicke’s encephalopathy presents with a triad of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia and
mental confusion.
Alcoholic hallucinosis is a rare condition in which auditory hallucinations can
occur in clear consciousness. The hallucinations can begin as simple sounds
like a buzzing sound but can progress to well-formed voices. Most cases resolve
within a few days and respond well to antipsychotics.

Taking an alcohol history is an important part of any admission to enable planning and
prevention. Patients withdrawing from alcohol need to be monitored closely to prevent
progression to DT. They should be nursed in a well-lit and safe environment. Dehydration,
electrolyte and nutritional imbalance should be corrected by giving parenteral vitamins
and fluids. A long-acting benzodiazepine like chlordiazepoxide 20–30 mg (up to four times
a day) should be started. Chlordiazepoxide should be prescribed on a reducing regimen,
reducing the dose every 2 days with a view to stopping over 7 days. Antipsychotic
medication should be avoided as it is likely to reduce the seizure threshold and can
precipitate withdrawal seizures. Advice about lifestyle changes can be given once the acute
situation has settled. Motivational interviewing may be a helpful way to engage the patient
in a non-judgmental way that can lay the foundations for future change.
KEY POINTS

• Delirium tremens is characterized by tremulousness, withdrawal seizures, intense and
vivid visual hallucinations with fluctuating consciousness.

• Immediate management involves medical care including rehydration, detoxification and
sedation using benzodiazepines and parenteral vitamins.

CASE 26:

FLASHBACKS AND NIGHTMARES

History
A 28-year-old single woman presents to her general practitioner and explains that she
has been experiencing recurrent nightmares over the past 2 months. She was involved in
a road traffic accident 4 months ago. The car that she had been driving crashed on the
motorway killing a colleague who had been her passenger. She also sustained injuries
which required a 2-week stay in hospital. She works as a manager in a building company
and her job requires her to travel to different sites in her car. Since the accident she has
been off work. She says that the nightmares are related to the accident. She is unable to
get the memories of the accident out of her mind and can experience very vivid images
of the events even during the day. She struggles with persistent anxiety, has poor sleep
and concentration. She now stays at home most of the time and finds it difficult to travel
by car, even as a passenger. Her mood and behaviour can fluctuate rapidly during the day
and she has recently started self-harming by making cuts to her forearms. She lives alone
but has support from friends and family who live locally. There is no history of mental
illness in the family. She has no previous psychiatric or medical history apart from a
history of overdose with paracetamol 8 years ago. At that time she had split up with her
boyfriend and took the overdose while intoxicated with alcohol. She is a non-smoker and
has used cannabis in the past when she was at university. She does not use any drugs
now. She used to drink alcohol socially but recently has started drinking every day. She
says that she drinks one bottle of wine a day.
Mental state examination
She makes good eye contact. She appears to be anxious and has tremors in both hands.
She is reluctant to speak about the road traffic accident and starts shouting, becoming
verbally aggressive when questioned about the accident. There is no pressure of speech.
She describes experiencing the accident as recurrent intrusive imagery. She feels guilty
about surviving the accident and states that it would have been better if she had died
instead of her colleague. She has thoughts that life is not worth living, but states that she
would not commit suicide because of her family. Her mood is labile. There is no evidence
of delusions or hallucinations. She has good insight into her difficulties.
Physical examination
Physical examination is unremarkable.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you investigate and manage this patient in general practice?

67

ANSWER 26
This woman is presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is an intense
and prolonged reaction to severe trauma. Such trauma could be due to natural disasters
(earthquake, floods, tsunami), accidents (road traffic accidents, fires) or serious physical
harm/threat of harm (rape, torture, assault). This woman had an accident 4 months ago
and has been experiencing symptoms of hyper-arousal (anxiety, insomnia) as well as
recurrent and intrusive flashbacks. She has nightmares and has been avoiding situations
that remind her of the accident (unable to travel in a car). These symptoms have presented
within 6 months of the trauma and have been present for more than 1 month. She has a
maladaptive style of coping and has been using excessive alcohol.

!

Stress-related disorders – differential diagnosis

• Acute stress reaction is a transient disorder that occurs in response to a severely

•

•
•
•
•

stressful event. It starts within a few hours of exposure and usually resolves
within 2 to 3 days of the termination of the stress. Symptoms include those of
anxiety, feeling of numbness, depersonalization, poor concentration and
disorientation.
Adjustment disorders occur when stressors are not life-threatening or out of
normal human experience. Symptoms are depressive and/or that of anxiety, and
they can affect behaviour. Symptoms don’t usually persist for more than 6 months
and resolve spontaneously with conservative management.
Dissociative disorders, which are disruptions to awareness, perception or memory,
can occur after stress. Dissociative amnesia or depersonalization are examples.
Substance abuse: LSD users can experience flashbacks. Alcohol or drug intoxication
or withdrawal can present with similar symptoms.
Organic causes such as head injury can mimic or exacerbate symptoms of PTSD.
Conversion disorders occur when stress is thought to be internalized and
symptoms such as loss of power or sensation occur. Pseudoseizures may also occur.

Detailed history of previous traumatic experiences including the nature and duration of the
current symptoms, along with a detailed mental state examination, is needed to rule out the
above diagnoses. Urine drug screen helps rule out intoxication with illicit drugs. The
immediate management would be to support and encourage her to talk about the traumatic
event and to facilitate healthy emotional processing and coping. On account of the severity
of her symptoms and the development of secondary complications like self-harm and
alcohol misuse, she should be referred to specialist psychiatric services. She would benefit
with input from a community psychiatric nurse (CPN) who could monitor her mental state
and also offer help with practical issues. Trauma-focused psychological help in the form of
cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) or eye movement and desensitization reprocessing
(EMDR) are first-line treatments. Pharmacological treatments are second-line and include
paroxetine or mirtazapine, which can be used in primary care, or amitriptyline or
phenelzine, which can be only be prescribed by mental health specialists.
KEY POINTS

• PTSD follows an out of ‘normal human experience’ trauma. Characteristic symptoms
•
68

include recollection, nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance of places or events reminiscent
of trauma, and anxiety symptoms.
Trauma-focused psychological therapies are the treatment of choice.

CASE 27:

ATAXIA

History
A 50-year-old electrician presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of
an unsteady gait and double vision when looking to the right. He appears confused and
gives a history of severe vomiting over the past 10 days with significant weight loss over
the past few months. He has been abusing alcohol for 30 years and has been diagnosed
with alcohol dependence. He underwent partial gastrectomy for carcinoma of the stomach
12 years ago. He has no other previous medical or psychiatric history.
Mental state examination
His eye contact is variable. He is disorientated. He has poor orientation in time and does
not know where he is, but is able to recognize his wife who accompanies him. He is
drowsy, has poor concentration but is readily rousable. He scores 14/30 on Mini Mental
State Examination. A thorough mental state examination is difficult due to his condition
but he does not appear to be responding to any unseen stimuli. He has little insight into
why he is there.
Physical examination
A general examination reveals bilateral pedal oedema and icterus. His blood pressure is
90/60 mmHg and pulse is 120/min. Oxygen saturation on air is 96%. He has palmar
erythema and hepatomegaly. He has nystagmus. Neurological examination reveals
reduced power in both lower limbs. He has reduced sensation on pin-prick and 2-point
discrimination in both lower limbs. Deep tendon reflex at the ankle is reduced bilaterally.
He has an unsteady gait and is unable to stand without support.

69

ANSWER 27
This man is presenting with a triad of ataxia, nystagmus and confusion indicating a
diagnosis of Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE). This can present abruptly and is a medical
emergency. It is important to recognize and treat the condition early as it is potentially
reversible. This condition is related to thiamine deficiency. Thiamine is phosphorylated to
TPP (thiamine pyrophosphate). TPP acts as co-factor for enzymes like transketolase and
pyruvate dehydrogenase, which are essential for synthesis of myelin and also play a key
role in brain glucose metabolism. Chronic alcohol use is an important cause of the
condition as it impairs the absorption of thiamine from the gut. Other causes of
Wernicke’s encephalopathy include prolonged diarrhoea, vomiting, hyperemesis
gravidarum, severe malnutrition in anorexia nervosa, prolonged intravenous feeding and
carcinoma of the stomach.
Pathological lesions in WE involve mamillary bodies, thalamus, hypothalamus, medulla,
pons and cerebellum. With prompt treatment the condition is reversible and greatly
reduces the risk of subsequent cognitive impairment. WE is pathophysiologically related
to Korsakoff syndrome (KS). Many of the cases of WE can progress to KS, which is
characterized by poverty in the content of conversation and confabulation. There is
enduring cognitive impairment with loss of recent memory, anterograde amnesia and the
sufferer has little insight into their problem. In cases of established KS, the prognosis is
poor with very few patients improving even with continued thiamine treatment.

!

Complications of Wernicke’s encephalopathy

• Strict bed rest is required in the acute stages of presentation. There is a risk of
•

cardiovascular collapse. Sudden death can occur due to cardiac decompensation.
In patients with signs of cardiac failure, digitilization might be needed.
Thiamine should always be administered before carbohydrate or glucose
infusion as thiamine is required for glucose metabolism and glucose infusion can
rapidly deplete the thiamine stores and further aggravate the condition.

This patient needs to be given 50 mg of thiamine intravenously, given slowly over 10
minutes due to risk of anaphylactic reaction. This should be accompanied by IM injection
of 50 mg of thiamine. The IM thiamine should be continued for 5 days during which the
normal diet is resumed. Absorption of thiamine from the gastrointestinal tract can be
inconsistent and therefore oral administration is not reliable. Injection of Pabrinex, which
contains nicotinamide, riboflavine, pyridoxine and ascorbic acid along with thiamine, is
often preferable to thiamine alone as this will cover the possibility of other vitamin
deficiencies. The patient needs complete bed rest. Management would involve also giving
consideration to the possibility of infection, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Oral
thiamine 100 mg twice-daily should be continued for 6–12 months after acute illness has
resolved. Lifestyle advice and family support will be helpful.
KEY POINTS

• WE is characterized by a triad of ataxia, nystagmus and confusion. When suspecting WE,
always ensure thiamine is administered before giving glucose.

• WE may lead to Korsakoff’s psychosis, which is not a psychotic disorder, but is a
cognitive disorder with poorer cognitive prognosis.

CASE 28: UNEXPLAINED
WON’T GO AWAY

MEDICAL SYMPTOMS: THIS PAIN JUST

History
A 43-year-old woman has been coming to her GP for three years with pelvic pain. She
has seen two different gynaecologists in that time and has had numerous investigations,
but neither were able to identify a cause. She comes to the surgery again with the same
symptom saying that she is unable to have sex with her husband and feels a sharp pain
like a bone pushing inside her almost constantly. Prior to this she had right-sided
hypochondrial pain for a 2-year period and received a CT scan and two ultrasound scans
that showed no abnormalities, before the symptoms spontaneously remitted. In her notes
it shows that in her early thirties she was investigated for central chest pain and difficulty
swallowing. An endoscopy, CT scan of her chest and chest X-rays were all normal. She
has had irritable bowel syndrome since she was 16. She has intermittently been off work,
but has never been off long-term and enjoys her role as a receptionist at the local
hospital’s patient advice and liaison service.
When you ask her today about other symptoms she indicates that she has no heavy
periods although she sometimes bleeds for up to 9 days. For the last 6 months she has
had intermittent palpitations, dizziness and nausea. She is asking for a sick note and a
referral to the hospital, but she does not want to see either of the gynaecologists she has
seen before.
A brief scan of previous investigations shows that they have been numerous and normal.

Questions
• What diagnoses go through your mind?
• What do you decide to do?

71

ANSWER 28
It is important not to fall into the trap of automatically dismissing this woman’s
symptoms. However the history is fairly typical of somatization disorder. Malingering is
another possibility although the fact that she enjoys her work makes this unlikely.

!

Somatization disorder

•
•
•
•
•
•

Chronic single or multiple symptoms
Symptoms occurring across different body systems
Symptoms with no explanatory objective signs or investigations
Psychiatric disorder such as depression is often present
Numerous past investigations
Rejection of previous physicians

In essence the task of the general practitioner is to rule out physical causes and then to
seek some kind of help that will prevent long-term social, marital or occupational
handicap. The key to these situations is to know when to raise alternative courses other
than persistent investigation. Investigation is costly for several reasons. It engenders
anxiety in the individual about possible pathology. Studies examining case notes of
somatizing patients reveal very high lifetime costs to the health service often with little
or no benefit.
The best timing to discuss the possibility of somatization is when a tranche of
investigations have come back that are normal. It could be that the GP in this situation
discusses previous results or seeks a further referral and discusses with the consultant
concerned the importance of steering the woman towards alternative attributions about
the nature of her symptoms. Somatization disorder is not malingering in the sense that
symptoms are not feigned. Symptoms are experienced as real. If a patient is being told
that there is no physical explanation for their symptoms it is important not to imply that
they are in some way ‘making up’ their symptoms but instead, offer some explanation of
where they originate from. Clinicians may explain that the body’s nervous system is very
complicated and that sometimes pain or other symptoms can occur when there is no
physical treatable pathology. Some people experience pains or symptoms spontaneously
for no known reason and some experience them where stress or factors such as poor sleep
or poor diet affect nervous system function. Opening up this discourse allows the
clinician to make appropriate referrals to professionals such as a clinical psychologist or
liaison psychiatrist who can give support to these aspects of functioning. The focus may
not be on cure, but on coping. If the woman is not receptive to such a referral an
alternative pragmatic approach would be to discuss lifestyle changes, coping strategies or
holistic activities such as yoga or aromatherapy that focus on general wellbeing, not the
main symptom.
Finally screen for depression which is commonly present. If it is present appropriate
treatment may help.
KEY POINTS

• Somatization disorder should be considered if symptoms occurring across physical
systems are chronic and have resulted in repeated negative investigations.

• Treat depression if present.
• Successful treatment reduces unnecessary investigations and facilitates a better quality
of life.

CASE 29:

CAN’T CONCENTRATE AFTER HIS DAUGHTER DIED

History
A 32-year-old man attends the general practitioner surgery because after his 18-monthold daughter died 6 months ago he has been unable to concentrate. He went back to work
in an insurance firm after two weeks but finds it hard, and feels a strong emotional jolt
every time he signs his signature. He explains that his daughter had been born with a
heart defect, and that he had been the one who signed the consent form for her to have
the heart operation. He can’t get it out of his mind that it was like him signing her death
warrant. He feels angry with medical staff, although he says that they did nothing wrong
that he knows of. She died a day after surgery when she suffered disseminated
intravascular coagulation.
He has lost his appetite, his sleep is poor and he is drinking more alcohol than usual. He
can concentrate at home on television programmes. He feels a general lack of energy and
says that he has difficulty enjoying things any more (anhedonia). If he laughs he feels
guilty. Prior to his daughter’s operation he was happy, although understandably
concerned about his daughter’s health. He also regularly went out with friends, including
5-a-side football on a Friday night followed by drinks and a meal. He could laugh and
enjoy himself at this time. He has no history of depression or psychiatric or psychological
problems.
His wife is low in mood but has returned to work in a human resources department of a
large manufacturing firm. She values the support of her friends there and has accessed
ad hoc counselling through her occupational health department.
They have one other child, a boy aged 7 who is missing his baby sister. He is cheerful
much of the time but cries sometimes at night saying he misses their cuddles. He is well
cared for.

Mental state examination
He is well dressed in chinos and an ironed open-necked shirt. His eye contact is good. He
has no agitation or psychomotor retardation. His mood is low and he describes being
tearful about once per week. His thoughts are normal in flow, speed and content. He has
no thought passivity or hallucinations or delusions. He is not suicidal although he admits
that life seems a bit pointless. He says he would never kill himself because he loves his
son too much. He can’t see the point of going to work when his baby girl is dead, but
goes to ‘bring the money in’. He has insight into the fact that he is feeling this way
because of ‘grief’.
Questions
• What is the problem?
• How can you help?

73

ANSWER 29
It is important to consider the diagnosis of depression. However, this man’s mental health
was good prior to the death of his daughter. His current problems clearly occur in the
context of a bereavement, and many aspects represent appropriate responses. A diagnosis
of depression may unnecessarily pathologize him at a time when he needs support. The
best thing to do at this point is to record the symptoms of depression and monitor them
once you have provided bereavement support. A risk assessment would need to be carried
out to make sure that he poses no risk to himself. There are no early indications of
suicidal ideation in his case.
Normal bereavement can include low mood, sleep disturbance and tearfulness. Often such
symptoms abate with time. This varies but about four fifths will experience improvements
in these symptoms 4 months post bereavement. Theorists regard that certain emotions are
seen commonly in bereavement, which include numbness of emotion or even denial that
the event has occurred. Yearning and distress, sadness, preoccupation with the dead
person, reminiscing, acceptance and readjustment can all be part of the spectrum of the
bereavement response evolving over time. Experiences of ‘what if’ or ‘if only’ are
common. It should be remembered that ‘loss’ never disappears, memories can elicit both
positive feelings and regret for years. Visions of the person who has died can occur and
these are usually recognized as not ‘real’ and as such are pseudohallucinations (true
hallucinations are perceived as indistinguishable from actual perceptions). They usually
disappear with time.
Pathological grief is not a clearly defined concept. It has a lengthy and varied literature
which reflects the difficulty of attributing a ‘norm’ to a process determined by different
individual’s personalities and coping resources. It refers to situations where a person’s
grieving process is significantly hampered in some way and affects his or her functioning
beyond an expected range. The commonest example would be where it is prolonged and
severe. This man’s grief has lasted 6 months thus far and could not be described as
pathological. This label should only be applied if the clinician is clear that using such a
label may help.
The best thing to do in this situation is to make sure that this man has good support. Ask
about friends and family and what his sources of support are. Bereavement support can
come from many different places determined by the individual’s preferences. It may come
from religious advisors, family, friends, third-sector counsellors (for example, Cruse),
funeral director services or through general practice counsellors. Some areas run
bereavement groups which, although often focused around the needs of children, also
provide support to parents and carers. The needs and wellbeing of this man’s wife and
children should also be considered. Follow-up is necessary to monitor whether the
situation improves. If it doesn’t, a referral to a psychologist or local bereavement service
would be appropriate.
KEY POINTS

• Bereavement is not an abnormal experience.
• Family members can benefit from support after bereavement. This varies enormously
depending on personal preference.

74

CASE 30:

SOMETHING’S NOT QUITE RIGHT

History
A 24-year-old man’s parents bring him to see you. Up until a few months ago he seemed
to be doing well and there were no concerns. He was in the second year of his PhD, but
then apparently quite suddenly lost interest in his academic work and also stopped
socializing with his friends. He returned to live at home and has been increasingly more
withdrawn at home. He is speaking less and less and is becoming apathetic and rarely
shows any emotion or engagement with anyone including his family members with
whom he had been reasonably close. When asked how he is, the man insists he is fine
and he cannot understand his parents’ concern. When asked about what they think is
wrong, his parents cannot say what concerns them but they are sure something is
not right.
Mental state examination
His eye contact is variable and when he does make eye contact it is fixed but there is no
sense of rapport with you. He is a polite and reasonably cooperative man. He does not
appear anxious or agitated but appears rather flat in affect. He seems slightly detached
from his parents and does not look at them. His speech appears normal but he does at
times struggle to answer even quite basic questions and his responses are short. He
describes his mood as ‘fine’ and denies any self-harm ideation. He does not look
depressed but seems detached and in a world of his own. He denies any hallucinations or
delusions. There is no evidence of any thought disorder, although he says very little so
this is difficult to elicit. He is orientated in time, place and person. His serial 7 testing is
poor, but his parents say he has never been good at mathematics.
You then call his university tutor who reports that a few months prior to him leaving
university and returning home, it was brought to the tutor’s attention by his peers that
there had been episodes of strange and erratic behaviour. By the time the university
health service saw him, the episodes seemed to have settled, but it was suggested he
would benefit from a break.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you manage this case?

75

ANSWER 30
The man needs to be assessed and he will need to be seen alone. If he has capacity, his
consent is required to share information about his care with his parents. You will need to
ask about any changes in mood, any experience of perceptual abnormality, any evidence
of delusions, any changes in behaviour. A risk assessment is also needed.
The differential diagnosis will include depression, substance misuse, schizophrenia
presenting with negative symptoms, autistic spectrum disorder (extremely unlikely as
onset appears to be recent and ASD would have had features from before age three) and
possible organic causes.
The most likely diagnoses are depression or schizophrenia. This man appears to be
presenting with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but it is important not to jump
too quickly to conclusions as making this diagnosis has a number of weighty implications
for this man and his family. Make sure that other possibilities are excluded.

!

Negative symptoms and signs of schizophrenia

• Avolition and low energy – the person tends to sit around and sleep much more
than normal, they lack interest in life and have poor motivation.

• Affective flattening – a blank, blunted facial expression or less lively facial
•
•
•
•
•
•

movements, flat voice (lack of normal intonations and variance) or physical
movements and poverty of emotional expression compared to before.
Alogia describes poverty of speech.
Interest in others is reduced.
Inability to make friends or keep friends.
Social isolation.
Poor self-care.
Catatonia can present in a number of ways with profound effects on movement
and activity. There may be an apparent unawareness of the environment, near total
absence of motion and speech, aimless body movements and bizarre postures.

While there are no tests that can diagnose schizophrenia, simple blood and urine tests can
rule out other medical causes of symptoms. Brain imaging studies, such as an MRI or a
CT scan, can exclude other very rare problems such as space-occupying lesions. A
thorough history and blood screen could exclude any missed systemic illness such as
anaemia or hypothyroidism.
The management of this man would depend on the final diagnosis. Initial treatment may
focus on psychosocial interventions including information, activity scheduling, family
therapy, and cognitive behaviour therapy. Other aspects of treatment include the
development of coping strategies and helping him function the best he can whatever the
symptoms are. Depression would warrant antidepressants and a diagnosis of
schizophrenia would involve treatment with antipsychotic medication, although
compliance may be an issue as the man does not believe he is unwell. Psychosocial
interventions would allow a period of monitoring before deciding on medication.
Antipsychotics appear less effective in reducing negative symptoms than positive ones.
Educating and supporting the family is also an important component of care. It is very
important that patients stay in treatment even after recovery. Four out of five patients
who stop taking their medication after a first episode of schizophrenia will have a relapse.
Relapse prevention work is therefore a key part of any treatment programme.
76

KEY POINTS

• Antipsychotic medication is less effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia;
•

only with clozapine is there good evidence about significant effects on negative
symptoms.
Educating and supporting the family is a key component of care.

CASE 31:

TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT OVERDOSE

History
A 20-year-old law student attends the emergency department with her parents after
having taken an overdose of her mother’s antidepressant medication. She had a row
earlier in the day with her parents about her mobile phone bill. She says that, in a fit of
anger, she locked herself in the bathroom and swallowed a fistful of pills. She is carrying
the bottle labelled ‘dothiepin 75 mg’, which may have contained as many as 28 tablets.
She is very remorseful about the attempt and says it was impulsive. She has apologized
to her parents and has come to the emergency department at their insistence. She says
she feels fine and reports no symptoms apart from a slight pain in her abdomen. She
reports feeling drowsy and would like to go home to ‘sleep it off’. There is no past history
of any mental illness though her father says that she has always been a ‘moody girl’ and
has periods where she is very low, tired and feeling worthless about herself. At other
times, she can be vivacious, spending a lot of money, full of confidence and brimming
with ideas.
Mental state examination
She appears drowsy and her speech is slurred. She is constantly licking her lips and
sipping water from a bottle. Her mood is euthymic. She expresses remorse and denies any
ideas of self-harm. There are no psychotic symptoms. She appears a little disorientated
getting the time and date wrong, but there is no evidence of gross cognitive abnormality.
There is no evidence of any other psychopathology. She is willing to be examined but
refuses to be admitted.
Physical examination
She appears flushed and warm to touch. Her temperature is 38°C. Her pulse is 110/min
and irregular and blood pressure is 98/64 mmHg. Her pupils are dilated. There are no
focal signs on CNS examination. Abdominal examination reveals a distended bladder.
Question
• How will you manage this patient?

79

ANSWER 31
This woman is claiming to be fine but she is presenting with an overdose of tricyclic
antidepressants, which can potentially be fatal and is therefore a medical emergency. She
needs to be observed and investigated in a medical assessment unit for at least 6–8 hours
as symptoms may commence only 2 hours after the overdose with major complications
occurring typically within the first 6 hours. These can be very serious and require
treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU). If she lacks the capacity to refuse treatment, she
may need to be assessed and treated against her will using the Mental Capacity Act. This
assessment will need to be carried out by the emergency Consultant.
She is presenting with an anticholinergic syndrome – ‘Blind as a bat, Red as a beet, Hot
as a hare, Dry as a bone, Mad as a hatter’. However, toxic effects are also due to alphaadrenergic blockade (vasodilation, hypotension and cardiogenic shock), reuptake
inhibition of noradrenaline and serotonin (tachycardia and seizures) and sodium channel
blockade (slow depolarization of the action potential and prolonged PR, QRS and QT
intervals). Impaired cardiac conduction may lead to heart block, unstable ventricular
arrhythmias or asystole. Direct depression of myocardial contractility may also be seen.
INVESTIGATIONS

• Toxicology screen – to rule out co-ingestion of other substances. The regional toxicology
laboratory or TOXBASE may offer specific advice.

• Blood tests – including complete blood count (CBC), urea and electrolytes
•

•

(hypokalaemia often seen), renal function tests (impaired renal function prolongs
toxicity as TCAs are excreted by the kidneys).
Arterial blood gases – are vital as TCA toxicity leads to mixed acidosis due to respiratory
depression and hypotension secondary to myocardial depression and peripheral
vasodilation. The acidosis in turn decreases protein binding and increases plasma levels
of free drug.
ECG has diagnostic and prognostic significance – limb lead QRS >160 milliseconds and
R wave >3 mm in lead aVR are associated with increased risk of seizures and ventricular
arrhythmias and are better predictors than plasma TCA levels.

Securing ABC (airway, breathing and circulation) is necessary. Gastric lavage is effective only
within the first hour of ingestion. Reversing acidosis with sodium bicarbonate when pH <7.1
is vital. Antiarrythmics should be avoided. Hypoxia, hypotension and hypokalaemia should
be corrected while symptomatic treatment should be instituted for seizures (benzodiazepines)
and urinary retention (catheter). Prolonged resuscitation is known to be successful in patients
with cardiac arrest. She should be monitored for at least 24 hours after ECG returns to
normal. Psychiatric assessment is essential prior to discharge to assess further risk of selfharm. She has periodic fluctuations of mood, which should arouse suspicion of bipolar
disorder or cyclothymic disorder (periods of depressive symptoms alternating with
hypomanic symptoms >2 years not meeting criteria for depression or bipolar disorder). SSRIs
are safer than TCAs should she ever need an antidepressant.
KEY POINTS

• TCA overdose is a serious medical emergency needing cardiac monitoring.
• The Mental Capacity Act may be used if the patient lacks capacity to refuse treatment.
• SSRIs are safer than TCAs in overdose.

CASE 32:

SUICIDAL RISK ASSESSMENT

History
A 29-year-old man presents with his sixth deliberate self-harm episode in 4 months. He
has made four attempts to hang himself (including this one), jumped out of a building
and thrown himself in front of traffic. There is no evidence of any injury. He was brought
to the emergency department as he tried to hang himself outside his girlfriend’s house.
Each hanging attempt has been triggered by an argument with his estranged girlfriend.
He wants to ensure that she is aware of what he is doing and the extent to which he is
suffering because of her behaviour. There is some evidence that the relationship was
previously volatile. He has been charged with domestic violence in the past, but the
charges were subsequently dropped as she withdrew her complaint. There is no suicide
note and he has made no efforts to settle any of his affairs. He does not have any strong
ties to anyone in particular and most of his relationships tend to be fairly transitory as
he ends up falling out with people. He is quite charming to the female nurses and slightly
hostile with the male charge nurse. However, on finding out that he has to wait to be
assessed, he becomes very angry and starts threatening violence.
Questions
• What are the factors associated with completed suicide?
• What are the key questions that should be asked in an assessment of risk?

81

ANSWER 32
Most self-harm episodes do not result in suicide, but the risks are increased if there is comorbidity with a mental illness. Psychiatric diagnoses classically associated with
completed suicide include major mood disorders, schizophrenia, and addiction disorders.
Two or more psychiatric disorders may interact to greatly increase the risk of suicide
compared to a level that either diagnosis alone might carry, especially alcohol problems
and depression. Suicide notes and planned suicides without any intention of being
discovered (for example, not disclosing the attempt to anyone) are particularly worrying.
Males are more likely to use violent methods which may mean that impulsive attempts are
more likely to be fatal. Firearm availability is an independent suicide risk factor. Wellidentified demographic and biopsychosocial risk factors consistently associated with
completed suicide in the general population include male gender, older age, white race,
widowed status, poor health (especially if painful serious illness is present), and lack of
social support. Patients with previous serious attempts, a family history of completed
suicide, history of drug/alcohol dependence, history of psychiatric illness, history of
chronic or painful physical conditions, and emotional feelings of hopelessness are also at
significantly higher risk of killing themselves. In addition the severity of previous attempts
in a patient’s life history is predictive of future suicide risk. The two personality disorders
most frequently associated with completed suicide are emotionally unstable personality
disorder (EUPD) and dissocial personality disorder (DPD). This man may have DPD given
the history and may be at risk until the issues relating to the current girlfriend are resolved.
The woman concerned is also at risk from him. A risk assessment involves assessing risk
to others as well as self as a result of their mental state. The following are fairly standard
screening questions.

Useful questions in assessment of risk of harm to self
1 Have you ever felt that life is not worth living?
• How long do those feelings last? • Do they come and go or are they there all the
time? • Can you manage the feelings?
2 Have you thought about acting on the feelings?
3 Have you made any plans?
• How close have you come to acting on the thoughts? • What stopped you doing
anything? • Have you tried anything before? • How can I trust that you will be able
to keep yourself safe?
4 Do you feel unsafe?
If the feelings of self-harm are pervasive and there is an urge to act on them and plans
have been made, the risk is high.
Make sure that there is an assessment of risk of potential harm to others (see Case 41) and
risk of self-neglect. If there is any potential risk of him harming his girlfriend it is likely
that confidentiality will need to be breached. She and/or the police may need to be
informed to ensure her safety. Discuss and document these risks and decisions.
KEY POINTS

• Most people who present with self-harm do not go on to commit suicide; however one
presentation of self-harm increases the likelihood of further attempts.

• Risk assessment is a key skill that all doctors need to be able to undertake.
• A complete risk assessment would also include risk to others (including adults and
children, and risk of self-neglect or vulnerability to exploitation).

• Even patients who frustrate you or make you angry need a proper risk assessment.
82

CASE 33:

PARANOIA WITH MOVEMENT DISORDER

A 53-year-old supply teacher attends the psychiatric out-patient clinic with his wife. His
wife says that his personality has ‘changed completely’ over the past 2 years. He has
become increasingly suspicious and cantankerous. He often misplaces objects and then
accuses her of stealing from him and has made similar accusations against close friends.
Previously a placid person, he has now become irritable and aggressive. She feels that his
‘mood swings’ are now becoming intolerable. However, he says that his wife is making
an ‘unnecessary fuss’. He acknowledges being a ‘bit low’ after taking premature retirement
2 years ago, but does not feel that there is anything really wrong with him. He appears
twitchy displaying sudden jerky movements of his arms and neck. He dismisses them as
‘nervous tics’. His wife, however, feels that he is getting clumsy, dropping things and
occasionally even stumbling.
There is no previous psychiatric history although he says he took premature retirement
due to stress. There is no past medical history of note. His father died at the age of 60
following a ‘nervous breakdown’ in his final years but he cannot provide you with any
more details. There is no other significant family history. The couple has a son, 30, and
a daughter, 25, who live close by. They live in their own home.

Mental state examination
He is a tall, thin gentleman, who establishes a good rapport. His speech appears a little
slurred at times but is coherent and relevant. He displays sudden jerky movements of his
arms, shoulder and neck. There is no evidence of thought disorder. He is convinced that
his wife and his friends have stolen money and a few of his personal objects. He
acknowledges that there is no obvious motive but yet remains convinced about this. He
appears low in mood but does not have any ideas of self-harm or suicide. He has little
insight into his symptoms and blames it all on ‘stress’. On cognitive examination, he
appears a little confused about the date and time and is rather clumsy on motor tasks
such as writing. Mini Mental State Examination test reveals a score of 23/30 with losses
on tasks of orientation (3 points), tasks of concentration (2 points), 3 object recall (1
point) and construction (1 point).
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What investigations are indicated?
• How will you manage this patient?

83

ANSWER 33
Pre-senile onset of cognitive, emotional and behavioural changes associated with
movement disorder, in the presence of a family history, should arouse strong suspicion of
the progressive degenerative disorder, Huntington’s disease (HD). The disease usually
presents in the 4th or 5th decade, often presenting with psychiatric symptoms, most
commonly personality changes, emotional disturbance and paranoia. Paranoid ideas of
reference with frank delusions of persecution may be the earliest symptoms often
associated with depression and anxiety. Behavioural agitation, often associated with
aggression and violence, may be seen independently of choreiform movement disorder.
Choreiform movements are regular, uncontrollable, random, brief muscle jerks and
movements. These are different from athetoid movements, which involve writhing and
twisting movements. Choreiform movements may initially be very mild and may go
unnoticed for years but become florid and disabling as the disease progresses. Insidious
cognitive impairment ultimately leads to severe dementia. Initially, the clinical picture
resembles paranoid schizophrenia. Other psychiatric differential diagnoses include
psychotic depression, bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Other causes of
dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Wilson’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease and neuroacanthocytosis also need to be considered as do other conditions such
as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), neursosyphilis and druginduced cerebellar disorder.
A high index of clinical suspicion is needed to make the correct diagnosis as up to a third
of cases are wrongly labelled as schizophrenia. CT and MRI brain scans reveal dilated
ventricles with atrophy of the caudate nuclei and are therefore indicated in all first time
presentations of psychosis. Genetic testing is diagnostic with the identification of
multiple cytosine/adenine/guanine (CAG) repeats on the short arm of chromosome 4. The
normal gene shows 11–34 repeats while in HD 37–120 repeats are seen. Pre-test genetic
counselling is vital as the diagnosis of the disease has implications for his children with
a strong likelihood (50%) of one of them being affected. It is autosomal dominant.

Van Duijn E, Kingma EM, Van der Mast RC (2007) Psychopathology in verified Huntington’s disease
gene carriers. Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences 19, 441–448.

The disease is progressive and incurable with treatment directed towards palliation of
symptoms. Mean survival time is 15 to 18 years. Psychotic symptoms such as agitation,
delusions and hallucinations and movement disorders can be treated with atypical
(clozapine) or typical (haloperidol) antipsychotic medication and tranquillizers such as
clonazepam. Depressive episodes usually respond to serotonin reuptake inhibiting
antidepressants such as fluoxetine or sertraline. Manic features may need a mood
stabilizer (for example, lithium) in addition to antipsychotic medication. Obsessive rituals
may need treatment with anti-obsessional agents (for example, fluoxetine). Speech
therapy for dysarthria, physiotherapy for muscle rigidity and occupational therapy to
maintain and enhance activities of daily living are indicated. Support for carers and
84

signposting to support organizations such as the Huntington’s Disease Association is
helpful. Referral to social services is necessary to organize community care packages,
home adaptation or nursing home care.
KEY POINTS

• HD can often be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia or mood disorder and therefore CT/MRI
scans are indicated in first presentations of psychosis.

• Management involves genetic counselling and symptomatic treatment.

CASE 34:

MY NOSE IS TOO BIG AND UGLY

History
A 26-year-old woman presents saying she needs referral to a plastic surgeon as her nose
is too large. She feels that people constantly comment on her nose, behind her back. She
feels her facial disfigurement has prevented her from developing positive relationships as
she lacks confidence and never believes friends when they try to reassure her that her
nose is fine. She rarely goes out as she is convinced that everyone stares at her and talks
about her. She recently gave up her job as she was constantly late because it took her so
long to apply her makeup to hide the disfigurement. She was also reluctant to move from
the office to a receptionist role as she did not want to have to see people.
Mental state examination
Her appearance is healthy and there is no discernible abnormality with her nose. It is
neither extreme in shape nor size. The woman presents as affable and communicative.
She is however inclined to hide her face and especially her nose by using a leaflet even
though she is wearing a floppy hat which covers most of her face. Her eye contact is
variable. She appears somewhat nervous and her speech is rapid but only when she is
talking about her nose. She does not describe herself as low in mood and does not appear
depressed. She does not have active self-harm ideation and there is no evidence of
psychosis.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the treatment options?

87

ANSWER 34
This woman has body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). She is preoccupied with a defect in her
appearance that is imagined. For it to be a disorder it must lead to impairment in social
or occupational functioning, and cause significant distress. The individual’s symptoms
must not be better accounted for by another disorder, for example, thinking they are fat
in the context of an eating disorder, or a depressive delusion. The defect is not recognized
by other people. This dislike of the defect is more than the usual negative feelings that
most people have about the way they look from time to time, as it significantly impacts
on functioning, especially socially. The beliefs usually represent overvalued ideas,
although occasionally when insight is absent the beliefs may be delusional in quality. In
this case it is important to explore co-morbidities. Co-morbidity with other psychiatric
disorders is common with three quarters of people with BDD, in that they may have either
major depressive disorder, social phobia or obsessive-compulsive disorder at some point.
It has been suggested that individuals with BDD are more likely to have avoidant
personality disorder or dependent personality disorder which conforms to the introverted,
shy and neurotic traits usually found in individuals with the disorder. Body dysmorphic
disorder is sometimes called dysmorphophobia and is one of the hypochondriacal
disorders.

Common symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder
There are preoccupations and ruminations about a perceived defect in appearance, which
sometimes leads to obsessive or compulsive behaviours. Such behaviours might include
regular checking of the relevant body part or checking in the mirror, intense avoidance
of mirrors or images of themselves, attempts to hide the area of concern with make up
and clothing and prolonged grooming. All of these would be to an intense degree. Some
will withdraw from family or social life, becoming intensely self-conscious and often
develop low self-esteem. If these aspects intensify the self-consciousness becomes
paranoia that others are commenting on them, and the low mood and low self-esteem
graduates to depression and ideas of self-harm. The person may seek regular reassurance
from those close to them, regularly comparing themselves to others. Relationships and
work can suffer, and it may lead to major depression, generalized anxiety, alcohol or
drug abuse.
Many individuals with BDD repeatedly seek treatment from doctors as they attempt to
correct the perceived ‘disfigurement’. Initial surgery is unlikely to help as the patient is
rarely satisfied given that their concerns do not relate to genuine abnormal features. The
overvalued ideas about disfigurement often remain or subtly alter, leading to ongoing or
additional concerns. They usually accept psychiatric or psychological help reluctantly. It
is a difficult disorder to treat. Psychodynamic approaches to therapy have not proven to
be effective, but there has been some success with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help if there is a strong depressive component
or features of OCD, but it would ideally be used alongside CBT.
KEY POINTS

• BDD is a difficult disorder to treat and psychological treatments are usually reluctantly
accepted.

• Cognitive behaviour therapy is the treatment of choice.

88

CASE 35:

CAN I SECTION HER TO MAKE HER
ACCEPT TREATMENT?
History
A 38-year-old woman presents to the emergency department having taken an overdose
some 6 hours ago. She is refusing to give consent for her blood to be taken for tests. She
is also shouting ‘you’re not going to pump my stomach’. You are told that the psychiatrist
should be called so he can put her on a Section 5 (2) of the Mental Health Act (MHA) to
enable you to take bloods and enforce treatment.
She took the overdose after finding out that her husband of 15 years is leaving her. The
overdose was impulsive. She wrote no note. She has three children who were in the house
at the time of the overdose. She is adamant that there is no point in living, given she has
been betrayed by her husband. She is sure her family will look after her children. You
look up a handbook describing the Mental Health Act which outlines the main sections
as shown in the box below.

!

Main sections of the Mental Health Act

• Section 2 – An assessment order which allows compulsory detention for 28 days.
• Section 3 – A treatment order which allows detention for 6 months.
• Section 4 – An order than can be applied by a single clinician to admit a patient
•

while arrangements are made for further assessment. Detention is for up to 72
hours.
Section 5(2) – An order that allows detention of existing in-patients for 72 hours.

Questions
• What is the role of the psychiatrist in this case?
• What are the key issues that need clarification?

89

ANSWER 35
The psychiatrist can assess her mental state but cannot use Section 5 (2). This section
applies to hospital in-patients and authorizes the detention of an informal patient for up
to 72 hours allowing the doctor in charge of their care to make an assessment, which may
lead to an application for admission under Section 2 or 3 if necessary. It is used to prevent
the patient leaving in-patient care. A psychiatrist cannot apply a Section 5 (2) to a patient
in the emergency department (as they have not yet agreed to admission) and certainly not
for the purpose of taking blood without consent. A Section 5 (2) is not a treatment section
and cannot be used to give treatment. It is considered poor practice to use Section 5 (2)
twice consecutively on the same patient within a short period of time as a Section 2 or 3
would usually be applied after a Section 5 (2) if further assessment or treatment is
necessary. Treatment under Sections 2 or 3 of the MHA can be given for mental disorders,
but not physical conditions unless they are causing the mental disorder.
In this case it would be important to assess capacity but failing the capacity test does not
require or necessarily imply a psychiatric diagnosis. All doctors should be able to assess
capacity since it is essential for patients to be able to consent to investigations and
treatments. Although this woman is unlikely to have a mental illness, her acute distress
and current social context might make her temporarily incompetent from the point of
view of capacity. Her capacity to refuse treatment should initially be assessed by the
casualty doctor and if capacity is felt to be lacking she can be treated against her will
using the Mental Capacity Act. This application would have to be made by the Consultant
Physician in charge of her treatment.
If, however, she has a mental disorder and that disorder is posing a risk to her health, her
safety or to the safety of others she can be detained under the MHA even on a medical
ward. This will need an application by an Approved Mental Health Professional (usually
a social worker) based on recommendations made by two doctors (one is usually a
psychiatrist and the other usually the patient’s GP though in this case may be the treating
physician). Section 2 is mainly an assessment section though treatment may also be
provided under the Act. Section 3 is a treatment section and may not be appropriate in
this case, as any psychiatric diagnosis – if she has one at all – is still under assessment.
If the patient is deemed to have capacity but continues to refuse tests and/or treatment,
she cannot be forced to accept treatment. However it is important to keep a dialogue
going with her and to enlist the help of someone she trusts to try and persuade her to
change her mind. Taking blood against the patient’s wishes or restraining her when she
has capacity to refuse treatment is unlawful. In severe emergencies where treatment for
life-threatening conditions is necessary without consent (for example, an unconscious
patient) the doctor and team would need to be clear that any treatment is given in the
best interests of the patient, and where possible treatments would be discussed with next
of kin. Emergency treatment to save a life has never been criticized in the courts. If there
is no time to do more to assess capacity, and severe distress impairs the ability to make
a rational decision, treatment should be initiated to save her life even without consent. A
court of law is likely to be more critical of fatal inactivity than well-intentioned care.
However in most situations assessment of capacity is possible and doctors should be
conversant with the Mental Capacity Act.

90

KEY POINTS

• The Mental Health Act can be used to give treatments for medical conditions directly
•
•

causing a mental disorder, or if the medical symptoms are a manifestation of a mental
disorder.
The Mental Health Act allows for detention in hospital for assessment and treatment of
mental disorders.
If a patient has capacity it is unlawful to give them treatment against their wishes even if
the decision seems unwise.

CASE 36:

DISINHIBITED AND BEHAVING ODDLY

History
A 50-year-old part time gardener attends the GP surgery with his girlfriend. He
announces that he has no complaints but is attending at the behest of his girlfriend. She
tearfully says that over the past year, he has been behaving ‘very oddly’ and in a socially
embarrassing and tactless manner. He has openly flirted with other women in her
presence at times making lewd remarks about their breasts or legs. He has been sacked
from two weekend jobs for behaving ‘inappropriately’ but he says that he likes women
and sees no harm in ‘trying his luck’. He seems oblivious to the pain his actions are
causing his girlfriend. When she continues to sob, he turns to her and shouts at her
angrily, accusing her of being ‘silly’. He then breaks down in tears himself.
He is facing disciplinary action at work and has been off work for the past 3 weeks. He
has little motivation to return to work. His energy levels are good. He is sleeping well
though his appetite has decreased over the past 6 months and he has lost half a stone in
weight. He has had intermittent headaches but otherwise there is no significant medical
history. There is no history of any psychiatric illness. He smokes 20 cigarettes a day but
does not abuse alcohol or any illicit drugs. He lives with his girlfriend in a council
maisonette. He has debts worth £3000, but is not ‘bothered’ about it. Physical
examination is unremarkable.

Mental state examination
He seems irritable and it is difficult to establish a rapport. His speech is coherent, relevant
but slow. He displays psychomotor retardation. He does not have formal thought disorder
or any other psychotic symptoms. His mood appears labile varying from low to mildly
euphoric and irritable. He is orientated in time, place and person. His attention span and
concentration are impaired as evidenced by serial 7 test. When asked to name words
beginning with the letter ‘F’, he names 6 words in 1 minute (normal range 10–20 seconds)
indicating impaired verbal fluency. He is unable to perform reciprocal tasks (tapping once
when the examiner taps twice and tapping twice when examiner taps once) or alternating
tasks (alternately drawing triangles and rectangles).
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What are the differential diagnoses?
• How would you manage this patient?

93

ANSWER 36
This man is presenting with sub-acute onset of socially disinhibited behaviour, lack of
empathy, insensitivity, impaired judgement, poor motivation and lability of mood
representing a significant change in his personality. Organic disorders should always be
suspected in late-onset personality changes. Orbitofrontal lesions are characterized by
disinhibition, mood lability and impulsivity while frontal convexity lesions show apathy,
indifference and psychomotor slowing. In practice, a significant overlap is seen in frontal
lobe dysfunction, as is the case in this man. Cognitive examination showing impaired
concentration, impaired verbal fluency, and impaired frontal system tasks such as
reciprocal or alternate programmes further suggests frontal lobe pathology. A diagnosis
of organic personality disorder is most likely. A range of causes of frontal lobe pathology
must be considered including stroke, head trauma, cerebral tumors, epilepsy, Huntington’s
disease, multiple sclerosis, endocrine disorders, neurosyphilis and acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In this case, intermittent headaches and weight loss point in
the direction of a cerebral tumour. Other psychiatric differentials of frontal lobe
pathology or disinhibited behaviour need to be ruled out such as:

• Alzheimer’s dementia involving global deterioration in cognition and behaviour
rather than change mainly in personality.

• Pick’s disease, which is a fronto-temporal dementia.
• Manic episode including elated/irritable mood, psychomotor agitation, flights of
ideas, grandiosity, reduced sleep. There may be a previous history of mood episode.

• Mixed affective disorder is an intermix of manic and depressive symptoms in the
same episode. Again, a previous history of mood episode and an episodic course
point to this diagnosis.
In management the first step is to identify the underlying cause for which a further
history, blood screen and brain scan (CT/MRI) is essential. Comprehensive mental state
examination may occasionally need to be supplemented by expert neuropsychological
testing to differentiate medical from non-medical psychiatric pathology. If a
neurological/medical cause is identified, referral to the relevant department is indicated.
If psychiatric symptoms are predominant, as in this case, referral to and joint working
with the liaison psychiatry team is useful. Treating the underlying cause (if treatable) is
the key management strategy. Additionally symptomatic treatment may be indicated
where symptoms are distressing or disabling. In this case, he is displaying lability of
mood and agitation for which he can be prescribed an antipsychotic medication such as
quetiapine. Antidepressants may be needed if depression seems to predominate in the
clinical picture. His girlfriend is very worried and will benefit from a carer’s assessment
and subsequent support.
KEY POINTS

• Late-onset personality change is often associated with frontal lobe dysfunction; careful
cognitive testing is needed to establish this.

• Treating the underlying cause and symptomatic treatment is the key management
strategy.

CASE 37:

TRANSFERENCE AND COUNTER TRANSFERENCE

History
A 50-year-old married woman presents with poorly controlled diabetes. The woman
insists that she is putting all the advice given to her in place but that it is not helping her
diabetes. She wonders whether it would be better managed if she saw you weekly. She
also insists that she is not helped by seeing different members of the clinical team and
that it would be better if she just saw you. You find yourself struggling to understand
how the fairly straightforward dietary advice cannot be implemented by the woman as
she clearly understands what is required. She seems very competent but insists that
without your help she cannot manage. She is married, but has recently had problems with
her husband who has had considerable health problems of his own. She says that he does
not understand her health problems and is preoccupied with his own difficulties. You get
the impression she feels somewhat let down by him as she was by her father who left the
family when she was only eight and failed to maintain any regular contact. On one
occasion she leaves a message with the reception that says: ‘I need to see you urgently.
You are the only one that understands.’
Her need to be seen and approved by you makes you uncomfortable and you are
struggling with how to manage this and move forward.

Mental state examination
She is well-dressed and although her hair is not tidy, she has used a lot of makeup. She
makes good, and sometimes intense eye contact. She presents as over-familiar calling you
by your first name. She begins the appointment by presenting you with a cake she has
baked especially for you. When you hesitate to accept it, she urges you to take it as not
doing so will be too much for her to cope with. There is no evidence of speech or mood
disorder and she is not psychotic.
Questions
• What might be happening here?
• Why is it important to reflect on how you are feeling?

95

ANSWER 37
It may be helpful to reflect on this woman’s needs in terms of relationships.
Understanding the situation in terms of transference may be helpful. Transference is a
phenomenon described in psychoanalysis, which is characterized by the unconscious
redirection of feelings for one person to another. This transference projects feelings,
emotions or motivations onto another person without realizing that much of it emanates
from within the self (and past relationships).
Typically, the pattern projected onto the other person comes from a childhood
relationship. This may be from an actual person, such as a parent, or an idealized figure
or prototype. This transfers both power and also expectation with both positive and
negative outcomes. Exploring the situations and who we place our transference on can
identify our real motives and thoughts. What we read into other people reveals our secret
prejudices and our unfulfilled wishes. Transference occurs on a regular basis, but is
particularly useful as a therapeutic tool to promote self-understanding.
Counter transference is the response that is elicited in the recipient (therapist) by the
other’s (patient) unconscious transference communications. Transference also provides a
good idea of what the patient might be expecting from you. In this case scenario, the fact
that the patient wants to see you weekly may mean she depends on you in a way that
she wishes she could depend on her partner. That may in the longer term be a problem
because while she is investing in you, it may make it difficult for her to address the real
issues of her relationship with her partner. However, it can be useful because it may help
her understand that she is visiting you with relatively trivial complaints because she has
unmet emotional needs.
Feelings are easier to identify if they are not congruent with the doctor’s personality and
expectation of his or her role. Doctors may struggle with transference since they may
have a need themselves to feel needed. They may unwittingly encourage this and only
realize the impact once a degree of dependency has been created. This may only emerge
when several similar doctor–patient relationships have arisen. If they lack awareness they
may react emotionally with irritation, rather than consider the role they might also have
played in establishing this dynamic. Awareness of the transference–counter transference
relationship allows a more considered response. Being aware of the subconscious patient
agenda may help the doctor recognize some of the patient’s wishes and fears and address
these openly and sensitively. It may also help explain certain behaviours from both the
patient and doctor. Understanding this also means that the doctor is able to step back and
avoid feeling overwhelmed by excessive patient demand as they have greater awareness
of what might be happening.
KEY POINTS

• Transference happens in most relationships.
• Not recognizing transference and counter transference can have negative impact on the
doctor–patient relationship.

CASE 38:

DEPRESSION PROGRESSING TO MYOCLONUS AND

DEMENTIA
A 24-year-old engineering student attends the psychiatric follow-up clinic complaining of
sudden jerky movement of his limbs over the past 3 weeks. He was diagnosed with
depression 8 months ago and has been treated with fluoxetine 40 mg a day, without much
benefit. Three months ago he started becoming more withdrawn and suspicious. He was
referred to the Early Intervention in Psychosis Team who did not find any evidence of
psychosis but suggested schizoid personality with depression. Risperidone 3 mg a day was
added. He started developing mild dystonia; procyclidine 5 mg twice daily was commenced
but the jerks progressively became worse. Stopping the risperidone and procyclidine made
no difference. Presently, he also complains of funny sensations in his face and neck. His
girlfriend feels that he is progressively becoming clumsy, losing balance, and is also quite
forgetful. He lives with his girlfriend, does not abuse drugs or alcohol and has no previous
psychiatric or medical history. His Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score is 20 out
of 30 losing points on orientation, attention and memory.

QUESTIONS

97

ANSWER 38
This young man has presented with depression but has gone on to develop myoclonic
jerks, unsteady gait and cognitive deterioration. Family history should be taken for
Huntington’s disease. An absent trauma history and no CT scan findings make Wilson’s
disease, multiple sclerosis, trauma or vascular causes unlikely. Normal blood chemistry
and normal CSF should raise suspicion of a rare cause of dementia. Drug side effects may
cause some symptoms but not to this extent. This makes variant Creutzfeld Jacob disease
(vCJD) a possibility. vCJD is one of four human spongiform encephalopathies (so called
on account of spongy appearance of brain tissue on autopsy). These are prion diseases,
so called as the infective agent prion and a form of its protein called PrP (prion protein)
have been implicated in causation. The other types include sporadic CJD (commonest),
genetic CJD and iatrogenic CJD (caused by treatment with cadaveric derived human
growth hormone or the use of human dura mater graft in surgery or blood transfusion
from infected patients or the use of infected instruments in surgery). vCJD differs from
sporadic CJD in that there is younger age of onset, longer course and psychiatric
presentation as is the case in this patient.
Brain biopsy is diagnostic but rarely feasible. Diagnosis is suspected in cases of negative
findings for other causes of young-onset dementia. Sporadic CJD shows characteristic
‘periodic complexes’ on EEG. These are generalized bi- or triphasic periodic sharp wave
complexes occurring at a frequency of 1–2 per second. However, this finding is not seen
in vCJD. Diagnosis depends on identification of bilateral symmetrical hyperintensity in
the pulvinar (posterior) nuclei of the thalamus. The ‘pulvinar sign’ on MRI brain scan is
seen in 90% of cases (see Figure 38.1). Another supportive diagnostic test is tonsil biopsy,
which reveals the offending prion protein. Also suggestive is the presence of a particular
protein called 14-3-3 in CSF.
The National CJD Surveillance Unit should be notified once the disease is suspected as
the patient is ‘at risk’ for public health purposes. He should be advised that he would not
be able to carry out blood or organ donation.
There is no specific treatment for CJD although drugs such as quinacrine and pentosan
polysulphate have been used on an individual basis. Psychiatric syndromes or symptoms
may need appropriate treatment. This includes antipsychotic medication for agitation or
psychotic symptoms, antidepressants for low mood, and benzodiazepines for movement
disorder and anxiety. Physiotherapists and speech therapists can help with dysphagia,
dysarthria and dyspraxia. Referral to a support network facilitates provision of support
to patients and carers. This is a neurodegenerative disorder and as the disease progresses,
functional ability reduces progressively and patients ultimately need full time nursing
care. Social services should therefore be involved at an early stage.
KEY POINTS

• CJD, especially vCJD, often presents
with psychiatric symptoms.

• CT scan is normal, however, MRI scan
reveals the characteristic pulvinar sign.

CASE 39:

BULIMIA NERVOSA

–

CONSTIPATION

History
A 21-year-old woman presents in the emergency department with acute abdominal pain
and vomiting and diarrhoea. The pain is cramping in nature. The diarrhoea and vomiting
have been present for 2 days without any abatement. Prior to this her eating has been
very variable. Sometimes she goes for the whole day without eating as she does not like
eating in public. Occasionally she gets ravenous and eats large quantities of junk food
(for example, whole packets of biscuits and cakes). She then tends to feel guilty and says
that the guilt makes her feel sick. She does not like how she looks as she feels she is much
bigger than her peers and she cannot wear current fashions as well as they can. She has
not been on holiday and has not been unwell, although is gradually feeling weaker. She
denies being on any prescribed medication but says she had been taking a herbal remedy
to clear her bowels as part of a detoxification programme. Recently she says she is not
depressed, can enjoy herself and has no thoughts of self-harm. She has not used any illicit
drugs, does not smoke and only occasionally consumes alcohol. There is no other
previous history of note.
Physical examination
The woman looks dehydrated. She has no fever. Her pulse is 84/min and her blood
pressure is 130/70 mmHg. Her body mass index (BMI) is 24.9 (height 152 cm, weight
58 kg). She has calluses on her knuckles (which she states she got having hit her hand
on a wall). Her teeth are discoloured and in poor condition.
Her abdomen is not tender and rectal examination shows that she is constipated.

Questions

• What are the treatment options?

99

ANSWER 39
When considering the gastrointestinal presentation, many things are ruled out by history,
examination and investigations. These include gastrointestinal problems (especially upper
GI tract) such as infection or repeated vomiting as a result of physical disorders (for
example, right ventricular failure). Prolonged starvation does not fit with the body mass
index. Anxiety or depression should be monitored but given her history bulimia is the
most likely diagnosis. The hypokalaemia and signs on the knuckles and teeth are likely
caused by repeated self-induced vomiting. The purging type is the most likely as she has
been making herself sick and she may also have been using diuretics to control her weight.
Hypokalaemia can be caused by the sudden uptake of potassium ions from the
bloodstream by muscle or other organs or by an overall depletion of the body’s
potassium. The most common cause of hypokalaemia is diuretics. Other common causes
of hypokalaemia are excessive diarrhoea, enema abuse or vomiting. It can also occur in
medical conditions such as diabetes (ketoacidosis), adrenal tumours, hyperaldosteronism
and renal artery stenosis, although these can be ruled out by history and investigation.
Up to 20% of people complaining of chronic diarrhoea practise laxative abuse. Laxative
abuse is often part of eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.
Hypokalaemia in eating disorders may be life-threatening with symptoms ranging from
lethargy and cloudy thinking to cardiac arrhythmias and death.
The acute management will be to medically stabilize this woman. She will need to be
carefully monitored while she is assessed and treated. Treatment of the hypokalaemia
involves addressing the cause, in this case psychoeducation about the risk this woman is
putting herself at. High-potassium food such as oranges and bananas can be used for
mild hypokalaemia (not below 3 mmol/L) with oral potassium supplementation if
necessary. If her potassium levels were below 2.5 mmol/L, intravenous potassium should
be given. The speed of administration should be slow to avoid rapid changes in potassium
levels, which can trigger adverse events such as arrhythmias. Regardless she will need
referral for the support and management of her bulimia nervosa.
In bulimia there is often a lack of control over eating, sometimes to the point of physical
discomfort. Eating patterns are often not healthy and may be covert. There may be signs
of purging such as going to the bathroom after meals to vomit and overt or covert use
of laxatives or diuretics. These all need to be addressed.

The most usual treatment is cognitive behaviour therapy with counselling and support,
but there are several other bulimia treatments that are effective. Interpersonal
psychotherapy helps people with bulimia solve relationship issues and interpersonal
problems that are contributing to their eating disorder. Interpersonal psychotherapy may
also help depression and low self-esteem which are common with bulimia. Group therapy
is also helpful in bulimia treatment involving education about the eating disorder and
strategies for overcoming it. Self-help and support groups are also of benefit. If there is
co-morbid depression, consider using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication
(SSRIs).
KEY POINTS

• Bulimia is often well-hidden and may present through medical complications.
• There is often co-morbidity especially with depression, substance misuse and
emotionally unstable personality disorder.

CASE 40:

FEVER, MUSCLE RIGIDITY, MENTAL CONFUSION

History
A 24-year-old postgraduate student has been admitted to the in-patient psychiatric unit
for the past 4 days following a relapse of schizophrenia. Over the last 2 days he has been
getting increasingly agitated and paranoid, accusing the nursing staff and other patients
of poisoning him. He has refused food and drink and has attacked a member of staff. His
first episode, three years ago, had resolved successfully with olanzapine (atypical
antipsychotic medication). However, he had stopped taking this medication three weeks
prior to admission. On admission, he was prescribed oral olanzapine 10 mg at night with
haloperidol orally 5 mg three times daily in case of agitation along with lorazepam orally
or intramuscularly 1–2 mg up to four times daily as required. He refused to take oral
olanzapine and was administered haloperidol 5 mg three times daily intramuscularly with
lorazepam 1 mg twice daily and 2 mg at night time intramuscularly over the last 2 days.
Despite this, his agitation has been increasing and his speech has become more incoherent
and bizarre. He was also prescribed procyclidine 5 mg twice daily after the duty doctor
assessed him 2 days ago.
Mental state examination
He was assessed by the duty trainee doctor and was found to have irrelevant and
incoherent speech with formal thought disorder. His eye contact was fleeting. He was
disorientated and had no insight. He has a number of clear paranoid delusions and is
responding to auditory hallucinations but is unable to describe them. He has little insight
into his illness.
Physical examination
He was found to have tachycardia (120 per minute) and raised blood pressure
(160/104 mmHg). Core body temperature was 39°C. CNS examination revealed
extrapyramidal muscle rigidity assumed to be secondary to antipsychotic medication,
with a generalized tremor that was attributed to agitation and anxiety. Further systemic
examination did not reveal any other abnormality.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How will you manage this patient?
• How will you manage his schizophrenia in the future?
103

ANSWER 40
This man has hyperpyrexia, autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, sweating, raised blood
pressure, tremors), muscle rigidity and mental confusion. This tetrad of symptoms is
highly suggestive of an idiosyncratic reaction to antipsychotic medication known as
neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). The central pathology is severe dopaminergic
blockade leading to extreme muscle rigidity, which may cause rhabdomyolyis (muscle
tissue breakdown) and acute renal failure. Early recognition of this medical emergency is
vital as it can be fatal in up to 20% of cases.

!

Higher risk of NMS

• The use of typical antipsychotics (though atypicals are not completely safe). • Rapid
upward titrations in dose. • Withdrawal of anticholinergic medication. • Depot
preparations. • Dehydration. • High ambient temperature. • Past episode of NMS.
• Males have twice the risk of females.
Differential diagnoses include infections such as meningitis, encephalitis, septicaemia
with or without concurrent extrapyramidal rigidity. Neuroendocrine possibilities include
thyrotoxicosis, and phaeochromocytoma. It could be drug-induced with toxicity from
illicit drugs (for example, cocaine and amphetamines) or prescription drugs (for example,
salicylates and anticholinergic medication). Heat stroke or malignant hyperthermia
should be considered. Also exclude neurological presentations such as status epilepticus
and catatonia. Diagnosis is facilitated by a high index of clinical suspicion. Monitoring
all patients on antipsychotic medication for extrapyramidal side effects is vital. The
presence of any other feature such as fever, confusion or autonomic dysfunction should
lead to a detailed physical examination and investigations to rule out the above
differentials. Useful investigations include the following (findings in NMS in brackets):
full blood count (leucocytosis); urea and electrolytes (raised in renal failure); liver
function tests (raised serum transaminases); creatinine kinase (raised in renal failure); and
urine drug screen to rule our drug intoxication

Management
This is a medical emergency and will require urgent transfer to a medical unit.
Maintaining ABC (airway, breathing and circulation) is vital. The antipsychotic
medication should be discontinued immediately. Maintain hydration with intravenous
fluids, temperature with antipyretics and cooling devices. Dialysis is necessary in renal
failure. There is some evidence to show the utility of generalized muscle relaxants such
as dantrolene as also for the use of dopaminergic medications such as amantadine.
Future psychiatric treatment will involve treating schizophrenia with antipsychotic
medications, which carry a high risk of NMS. Treatment should therefore be commenced
in an in-patient setting only 2 weeks after successful resolution of current NMS. Long
acting or depot preparation should be avoided. Use low-dose atypical antipsychotic
medication and titrate the dose upwards slowly.
KEY POINTS

• Hyperpyrexia, autonomic dysfunction, muscle rigidity and mental confusion with
antipsychotic exposure suggest a diagnosis of NMS.

• Maintaining ABC and symptomatic treatment in the medical setting is helpful.
• Restart antipsychotic medication under close supervision as a psychiatry in-patient.
104

CASE 41: ‘ALIEN

IMPULSES’ AND RISK TO OTHERS

History
A 30-year-old shop assistant presents to the emergency department requesting that they
remove the microchip from her brain. She says that this chip was implanted into her brain
some weeks ago in order that aliens could control her mind.
She has previously been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has had a number
of previous admissions to psychiatric hospitals, the majority of which have been under
the Mental Health Act 1983. She has previously been treated with a number of different
types of antipsychotic medication and this is currently olanzapine 20 mg once daily. Her
last admission to hospital was 6 months ago and since this time she has often missed her
medication. She has no past medical history of note.
There is no family history of mental illness. She is currently living with her parents who
are supportive of her. From the ages of 18 to 28 she smoked high-potency cannabis
(‘skunk’) on an almost daily basis, but following advice and support from her community
mental health team she has successfully cut down her use of cannabis to approximately
once every month. She has no other history of alcohol or illicit substance abuse. Although
she has no previous convictions she has previously assaulted her parents and ward
nursing staff when psychotic.

Mental state examination
She presents as unkempt and is surprised that she is being asked about her previous
psychiatric history rather than being referred to a neurosurgeon for removal of the
microchip. Despite this it is possible to establish a good rapport. At several points during
the interview she stops speaking in mid-sentence and stares intently into one of the
corners of the room and begins whispering to herself.
She believes that a microchip has been implanted into her brain and that aliens are using
this to ‘put things into my mind’. She describes how the aliens put impulses into her mind
which she feels compelled to act upon. For 2 days the ‘alien impulses’ have concentrated
on killing her mother and she is concerned that she may act upon these. She denies any
hallucinations but during the interview appears to be responding to unseen auditory
stimuli. She has little insight and does not accept that a relapse of her mental illness could
be responsible for her current difficulties. There is no abnormality upon physical
examination.

Questions
• What psychopathological term could be used to describe her belief that aliens are
putting impulses into her brain which she must act on?
• How would you assess the risk that this patient may pose to others?

105

ANSWER 41
Her belief that impulses are being put into her brain and are no longer under her control
is an example of passivity. The term passivity is used when the patient has the delusion
that some aspect that is normally under their own control is instead controlled by an
external agency. Examples of passivity phenomena are made impulses, made feelings and
somatic passivity (a delusion that part of the body is under external control). Thought
passivity refers to the belief that thoughts are inserted, removed or blocked.
There are indications from this patient’s presentation and history that she may pose a risk
to others and in particular her mother. She is experiencing passivity phenomena that
include the made impulse to kill her mother. In addition to this she has a history of
assaults upon others (including her parents) when unwell. Her risk to others is also
increased by her lack of insight, poor compliance and history of cannabis abuse.
A comprehensive risk assessment is essential in this case. In order to do this it is
important to obtain relevant information from as many sources as possible. This could
include a more detailed history and mental state examination from the patient, discussion
with an informant (her parents would be especially helpful in this case), previous
psychiatric and medical records and information from any professionals recently
involved in her care (such as community psychiatric nurse, social worker or general
practitioner). This information should then be used to evaluate the presence/absence of
relevant risk factors.

Other areas of risk that should be explored include risk of harm to self or suicide, risk of
exploitation and risk of neglect. A summary judgement of risk should then be made. This
should include what the risk is, who is at risk and the likelihood of this harm occurring.
From this should follow an appropriate risk management plan. In this case it would be
appropriate to consider admitting the patient to hospital. Given the risk here, if this offer
is declined consider using the Mental Health Act 1983.
KEY POINTS

• Passivity phenomena involve the patient believing that some aspect of their body or
mind is under the control of an external agency.

• Comprehensive risk assessment should involve information from several sources and will
lead on to appropriate risk management and the provision of appropriate clinical care.

CASE 42:

FEELS LIKE THE ROOM IS CHANGING SHAPE

History
A 19-year-old woman comes to clinic and describes that she is worried by experiences
where the usual sounds in the room begin to fluctuate in intensity, almost like they are
coming from a radio with the sound being altered. There is no radio present. This lasts
for about 10 minutes and then she gets a very severe throbbing headache. More
commonly, on other occasions she has had the strange experience that her body is
changing shape and becoming smaller and that she is further away from the walls, even
though she knows that the room has not actually changed shape. Sometimes this comes
with a sensation that time is rushing past. Again she subsequently has a powerful
headache that throbs and is usually unilateral. She reports no recent stressful life events
and has worked at a supermarket checkout for 15 months. She has a healthy group
of friends.
There is no history of epilepsy or drug abuse, although she drinks up to 20 units of
alcohol a week, usually over two nights at the weekend. The episodes do not occur in this
context. There is no family history of epilepsy but a strong family history of migraine.
Her mother has classical migraine with throbbing headaches, photophobia and vomiting.
Her father reports having visual shimmering for 20–30 minutes about five times a year,
but has no headaches associated with this.

Mental state examination
The 19-year-old woman is well-dressed, clean and wears some light make up. She makes
normal eye contact and has healthy behaviour with no agitation or psychomotor
retardation. Her mood is euthymic both subjectively and objectively. She would like to
know what the symptoms mean. She is worried that she might be going mad. Other than
the symptoms that she has described there is no evidence of any unusual or strange
psychopathology.
A full neurological examination is normal.

Questions
• Are her experiences illusions or hallucinations?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What is the most likely diagnosis?

107

ANSWER 42
The distortion of the ambient sounds are illusions. They are distortions of real
perceptions. They would only be hallucinations if they occurred in the absence of
external stimuli and were perceived as a true perception in external space (i.e. not a
thought or an imagined sound). Similarly macropsia describes the sensation that objects
are larger (and the person smaller in relation) than normal. Micropsia is the reverse.

!

Hallucinations and illusions

• Hallucination: a sensory perception in the absence of an external stimulus that is
experienced as a real perception

• Illusion: a mistaken or false interpretation of a real sensory experience that usually
comes about when a person’s imagined or expected perceptions merge with real
perception

The differential diagnosis would include complex partial epilepsy, psychoactive drug use
(for example, cannabis or magic mushrooms), migraine, early psychosis, severe sleep
deprivation, severe stress, space-occupying lesion or feigned illness.
In this example, there is no history of drug misuse and the urine screen is negative. There is
no additional psychopathology indicative of psychosis, although this should be monitored at
future visits. Further tests were discussed but mutually agreed not to be necessary.
The GP referred the patient to a neurologist who diagnosed migraine using the term ‘Alice
in Wonderland syndrome’. This was coined by Todd in 1955, because of the various
instances of metamorphosia, micropsia and macropsia described in the tale where Alice
perceived herself to be smaller, changing shape and objects around her to be changing in
size. In Chapter 5 of Lewis Carroll’s book, Alice encounters a caterpillar sitting on a
mushroom, smoking ‘Hookah’. This is of note given that the toadstool Amanita muscaria
has hallucinogenic properties. Carroll wrote of his own migrainous headaches in later life.
In fact while migrainous auras are commonly known to include scotomata, or transient
speech or power loss, it should be remembered that the spreading depression that is
associated with aura can happen anywhere in the brain, and therefore create a range of
other symptoms (that are either less common or less commonly reported).
The treatment for migraine involves analgesics such as paracetamol and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. Antiemetics are useful if nausea is a key part. Serotonin
agonists that cause cerebral vasoconstriction can be helpful for some people. Prophylaxis
such as beta-blockers, tricyclics and the anticonvulsant topiramate can be effective,
although there is a high rate of placebo response found in comparative studies.
In Alice in Wonderland syndrome knowing the diagnosis is a great help to patients as it
reassures them that they do not have a severe mental illness and that they don’t have
epilepsy. Prevention may be helped by recognizing particular triggers such as tiredness
or diet, and making lifestyle changes accordingly. Rarely, other triggers have been
reported such as physical exercise or bright lights.
KEY POINT

• Migraine aura can affect different parts of the brain other than visual centres. This can
produce a range of rare but migraine-related symptoms.

CASE 43:

UNABLE TO OPEN MY FISTS

History
A 19-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner saying that she is unable to
open her fists. She says that three days ago she woke up and found it to be like this. She
says she also started to see in black and white for a few hours and could see no colours.
She explains that she has been otherwise healthy recently. Her records indicate that she
has presented regularly to the GP in the past. The last five presentations have been for
an ear infection, pains on the soles of both feet, shoulder pain, restless legs at night and
neck pain. She has a cousin with cerebral palsy and her grandfather had a stroke one year
ago and is now in a wheelchair. Further questioning reveals no other neurological
symptoms. She did not do well in GCSEs and required extra help at school in the past for
learning. She started work at a supermarket and was recently promoted to the checkout.
She says that she does not like this, and prefers being on shelf stacking duties. Her father
is known to the practice as someone who has significant problems with alcohol
dependence syndrome. Systematic enquiry for depression is unremarkable. She does
describe some anxiety about work but has great difficulty articulating it.
Physical and mental state examination
The fists are tightly closed and on gentle examination it is not possible to open the
fingers. There is clear resistance to movement. The woman does not appear to be unduly
concerned. A neurological examination reveals no other abnormalities. Tone in all other
limbs and muscle groups appears normal. Her reflexes are all normal. There are no visual
field defects. There is no evidence of status epilepticus. She chats and answers questions
asked of her.
On mental state examination she makes good eye contact and smiles readily. She sits with
her fists clenched as if holding ski poles with the thumbs slightly rotated into the midline.
There is no agitation, restlessness or retardation of movements. She does not fidget and
there is no evidence of tics or other movement problems. She describes no low mood and
appears euthymic. There is no evidence of thought passivity, hallucinations or delusions.
When asked what she thinks is wrong she says: ‘I am paralysed in my hands’.

Questions
• How would her symptoms be explained neurologically?
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What are the elements of good management?

109

ANSWER 43
There are no good explanations for her symptoms neurologically. A motor lesion in the brain
would cause a unilateral loss of control and this would usually be a flaccid loss of power, with
contractures only developing over time with lack of movement. The bilateral loss of colour vision
(acquired achromatopsia) is neurologically explainable by bilateral lesions in the visual cortex,
and is exceptionally rare. It is usually accompanied by visual field defects and other signs.
The most likely diagnosis is a conversion disorder resulting in loss of power. It is possible that
this occurs against a backdrop of somatization disorder, where a range of symptoms occur
across time. This is thought to represent physical expression of psychological distress. It is also
possible that this is feigned and that the symptom provides significant gain for the person
(either allowing her to avoid a predicament or a stressful circumstance, or giving financial
reward or sick leave).
Conversion disorder often occurs with co-morbid anxiety and/or depression, and even though
you have not been able to identify this thus far, it is worth keeping an open mind and
exploring this further. Some people will have ‘belle indifference’, meaning that they would be
expected to be much more distressed about their symptoms than they appear to be, which may
be the case here.
Joint management between a neurologist and a liaison psychiatrist or clinical psychologist
would be the most common strategy. The neurologist can get a range of necessary
examinations out of the way early. These allow the clinical team to move on and be confident
in their diagnosis, which promotes the most effective management. In situations like this it is
possible that relatively little investigation is necessary, with hefty reassurance and explanation
to the woman concerned.
Most importantly take the symptom seriously. Positive attributions about recovery are fostered
by strategies that are perceived as recovery inducing. For example, physiotherapy should be
used and allied with strong ‘seeding’ of ideas about recovery. There should be careful
exploration of any factors that may be contributing to the maintenance of the symptoms.
Possible areas to explore would include relationships at home and working practices.
Confrontation strategies do not seem to work very well and may lead to disengagement from
services or additional symptomatology. Positive reinforcement of healthy functioning needs
to be built into the programme. Therapy that allows the young woman to begin to understand
links between stress/emotions and physical symptoms is helpful. This would include examples
about stress headaches, high blood pressure, nail-biting, palpitations and peptic ulcers. This
allows a discussion about very real physical symptoms being related to stress and
psychological factors. This can then move on to discussions about stressors in her life. These
might be as simple as moving onto the checkouts and not being able to say no, although they
may be more complex. Family mechanisms may be important if dysfunction (for example, in
the context of an alcohol dependent father) has altered relationships, communication or
developmental learning of adaptive coping strategies. Medication is not helpful unless you
have identified a clear need (for example, clinical depression). Making sure that the team
members work together with a common plan is important.
KEY POINTS

• Conversion disorder can produce a range of symptoms and is different from feigned
•
•
110

symptomatology in that psychological distress elicits physical symptoms without
conscious intent.
Management is multi-faceted.
Medication is not usually useful unless there is a clear co-morbid condition such as depression.

CASE 44:

INTENSE FATIGUE

History
A 23-year-old woman comes to see you with intense fatigue. She says it has been going
on for 9 months, and started after a viral infection that she caught while on a visit to
relatives. At the time she had a fever, sore throat, aching muscles and felt drained. While
she initially seemed to recover and went back to work in an advertising agency, she has
only been able to return to work part time for two weeks, and has been off continuously
now for 7 months. She describes unrefreshing and disturbed sleep. She also describes
feeling tired most of the time, generalized aches and feeling exhausted after even slight
exercise. Her appetite is good and systemic enquiry reveals no other symptomatology.
Mental state examination
She makes good eye to eye contact. Her hair is tied up and does not look as though it has
been washed for some time. She appears slightly on edge, but answers all your questions
openly. Her speech is normal in flow and content and she has no pressure of speech. She
describes feeling fed up with being ill and low in mood. There is no suicidal ideation or
intent. There is no thought passivity or any hallucinations either to observe or in the
history. She also has no delusions. She does have a belief in poltergeists and wonders if
there might be one in the house at the moment, because she has found things left out in
the kitchen when she thought she had put them away.

Questions
• What possible diagnoses go through your mind?
• What further information would you need?

111

ANSWER 44
It is important to think broadly and remember that fatigue can be a component of a range
of illnesses and social factors. While the temptation is to think of a divide between
physical and mental illnesses, very often physical illnesses have significant psychological
consequences and if the illness is neurological will affect both physical and mental
functioning. Similarly, mental health problems can lead to physical symptoms. Illnesses
that should go through your mind include anaemia, diabetes, hypothroidism and renal
failure but these have been excluded by investigations. Cardiac problems (including
bradycardia and heart failure) need to be excluded by further history and an
electrocardiogram. Cancer and infectious diseases may also need to be carefully excluded
by systemic enquiry with any follow-up investigations as necessary. Other medical causes
such as endocrine disorders, autoimmune disorders (such as myasthenia gravis) and
cirrhosis or liver failure can be excluded by history, examination and investigation.
Coeliac disease is unlikely since there is no anaemia. Other causes of malabsorption or
malnutrition (for example, an eating disorder) should also be excluded.
Clues to the most likely diagnosis lie in the history and include depression, infectious
diseases or chronic fatigue syndrome. Chronic fatigue syndrome is sometimes called
CFS/ME and refers to the same process (myalgic encephalopathy being a more popular
but pathologically inaccurate term). Some believe it may be a heterogenous group and
this is still being researched.

!

Oxford criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome

•
•
•
•
•

Severe disabling fatigue of at least 6 months duration.
Affects both physical and mental functioning.
Present for more than 50% of the time.
Myalgia, sleep and mood disturbances are sometimes present.
Exclusion criteria include physical illnesses that causes fatigue, serious mental
illness such as depression (low mood is not an exclusion criteria), dementia,
psychosis or eating disorder.

Treatments on offer include pacing of energy usage, cognitive behaviour therapy,
graded exercise and symptomatic medication. Different treatments are appropriate for
different people. Various places have CFS teams that include a range of disciplines
including physiotherapists, community nurses, occupational therapists, psychologists and
psychiatrists who work together around agreed treatment protocols. Medication
randomized controlled trials (for example, with antidepressants or immunoglobulins)
either show no statistical differences or give equivocal results and have been difficult to
replicate. Attributions about the illness appear in research to have an impact on
outcomes. The most important factor appears to be a positive and empowering approach
to treatment, with a good relationship between sufferer and clinician. It is important to
avoid therapeutic nihilism and to collaboratively problem solve around therapeutic
challenges.
KEY POINTS

• There are no diagnostic tests for CFS.
• It is important to exclude other causes of fatigue.
• For diagnosis in children the Oxford criteria are used, but with 3 months as the
minimum duration to ensure early diagnosis and treatment.

CASE 45:

EPILEPSY AND SYMPTOMS OF PSYCHOSIS

History
You see a 27-year-old man who has epilepsy. He has a history of complex partial seizures.
He has simple auditory hallucinations during the aura, but also psychotic symptoms
between seizures. Prior to being on antipsychotic medication, after the seizures he would
typically have a day when he felt well, and then would become unwell with auditory
hallucinations, persecutory delusions, low mood and irritability. This would last for a few
days. In the past he has also reported seeing fleeting images of people laughing at him.
3 years ago haloperidol was added to the antiepileptic medication phenytoin. His
medication has kept him reasonably well. He is troubled with extrapyramidal side effects
and has come to see you about this.
Questions
• What do you want to know to make a decision about his medication?
• What options do you have?

113

ANSWER 45

!

Psychosis and epilepsy
Epilepsy can be associated with psychosis particularly if the temporal lobes are
affected. The psychosis can be:

• Ictal (occurring during the seizure)
• Post-ictal (occurring after the seizure) or
• Inter-ictal (persistent and not temporally related to seizures)
It is important to work with the patient and key carers to accurately record number, type,
frequency and duration of seizures. This information should be recorded in a seizure diary.
The precise nature of the psychotic symptoms and their temporal relationship with seizures
should be recorded. It would be worth involving a community nurse in this work. It is also
important to consider the patient’s capacity and ability to consent to assessment and
proposed treatment. You also need to know what extrapyramidal side effects he is having.
It would be useful to ask for an EEG and seek a neurology opinion on improving seizure
control. Change of anticonvulsant medication may improve psychotic symptoms and it
may be possible to withdraw or reduce haloperidol as a result. If an alternative antipsychotic is considered the practitioner should be aware of its effect on seizure threshold.

!

Unusual experiences in temporal lobe epilepsy
During the aura (seconds to minutes) the following may occur:

• Illusions or visual distortions
• Hallucinations can be auditory, gustatory, olfactory or musical.
• Depersonalization or derealization or autoscopy (sensation of seeing one’s own
body).

• Strong emergence of memories.
• Déjà vu or amnesia.
• Strong emotions (for example, anxiety, joy etc.) – some report powerful ‘spiritual’
experiences.
Complex partial seizures may include:

•
•
•
•

Impaired consciousness.
Repetitive movements and/or automatisms.
Lip smacking, mouth movements such as chewing and motionless staring.
Continuing with activities but without full awareness (fugue states).

There is sometimes generalization to tonic clonic seizures.
There is usually post-ictal confusion and sleepiness.

Extrapyramidal and other side effects (see Case 95) can be unpleasant or distressing and
may put patients off treatment that in other ways is working well for them. They may
rarely be life-threatening especially if the dystonia affects muscles related to breathing
(for example, the larynx). Rarely withdrawal dyskinesia may occur when medication is
stopped.

114

Options for dealing with extrapyramidal side effects include reducing the dose, using a
different antipsychotic with fewer extrapyramidal side effects, such as risperidone, or
adding antiparkinsonian medication. In some instances a trial without neuroleptics is
appropriate, especially if there has been good seizure control in the absence of psychotic
experiences.
KEY POINTS

• Psychotic symptoms may occur in relation to epilepsy.
• Accurately record seizures and improve seizure control.
• It is important to watch for extrapyramidal side effects in those taking antipsychotic
medication.

CASE 46: I’M

IMPOTENT

History
A 30-year-old man comes to see you in the general practitioner surgery. He is
embarrassed and explains that he was married last year and is having problems with his
sex life. In particular he mentions that since he was married he has had problems
maintaining an erection when he is with his wife. He says that when he has been able to
get an erection he often has a premature ejaculation. His wife has not been able to
achieve orgasm. She has been very understanding and says that she does not mind, but
he is concerned that there is something very wrong with him. He says that their
relationship is good and he is very much in love with his wife. He has not told her that
he is seeking advice. On further questioning he indicates that before he married he was a
virgin, but that he did masturbate regularly and had sustained erections. He still
occasionally masturbates in private and can sustain an erection for at least 5 minutes. His
erections are normal and not painful. Brief systemic enquiry is normal. He has no
polydipsia, polyuria, frequency, other urological or cardiovascular symptoms. He is an
amateur football player who plays regularly and has not had any difficulties recently with
fitness. He drinks socially at weekends only and is a non-smoker. He can still enjoy
himself with his friends and his wife and denies any low mood. His work as owner of a
small plumbing firm is going well.
Physical examination
He is clearly anxious and embarrassed. When you put him at his ease by explaining that
the consultation is confidential and that this is a common problem with one in ten men
experiencing it at some time, he becomes more relaxed. There is no evidence of any
serious mental illness.
He has a pulse of 88/min and a blood pressure of 125/75 mmHg. His heart sounds are
normal. He is fit and appears healthy. His body mass index is 22. There are no penile,
testicular or scrotal abnormalities and he has normal muscle and hair distribution. The
pulses in his legs and feet are normal. Neurological examination is also normal including
reflexes, fundi, visual fields and motor power. Urine stick test is normal with no sugar.

Questions
• What possible differential diagnoses go through your mind?
• Should you refer him on to a specialist urologist?
• What advice can you give him?

117

ANSWER 46
Erectile dysfunction can be caused by cardiovascular problems (for example, vascular
disease in diabetes) reducing blood flow to the area, but the fact that this man can sustain
an erection at other times, and the normal cardiovascular examination, makes this
unlikely. There is no evidence that he has low testosterone. Visual field defects are absent
and there is no evidence of raised intracranial pressure or brain pathology. Smoking and
alcohol consumption can affect sexual function. This is not obviously present but it will
be worth asking more questions about potential illicit drug use or use of any other
medications (neuroleptics and antihypertensives would be the usual culprits). Nervous
system disorders that affect sexual function tend to be those affecting older people such
as Parkinson’s, cerebrovascular accident or multiple sclerosis, although trauma to the
spine may also do so. All of these are ruled out here by history and examination. Some
local cancers or local disease (for example, Peyronie’s disease) can be ruled out by normal
appearance and the absence of pain or other symptoms. Aggressive cancer treatment or
treatments for some systemic diseases can also affect erectile function.
There is no evidence of any physical illness. A referral to a urologist is likely to make him
more anxious and is unnecessary at this point. The most likely diagnosis is that this man’s
problems are psychological. He is able to sustain a normal erection when he is not with
his wife and he clearly has a high level of performance anxiety. This has been reinforced
by experiences of premature ejaculation. Research shows that problems such as this can
be greatly reduced by reduction in anxiety about performance.
In the first instance a lot of reassurance will help, and some literature to help him
understand how the body works sexually and about different sexual needs within
relationships. It will also help to explain the importance of the mind, expectations and
circumstances in sexual relationships, and various self-help books may help him here. If
these strategies do not work then he should return to you for other alternatives. It could
be helpful to talk with him and his spouse together since it is difficult to fully understand
the problems of one person in the relationship when sexuality is often expressed in a
dynamic between two people. Discuss this option with him but respect his wishes. The
attitudes and expectations of his wife may be relevant, and the solution may need to
involve them both. It may be that a local couples therapy or psychosexual clinic would
help them. In this for example, it may be helpful to take the performance of sexuality out
of the equation and ask them to explore each other’s bodies through massage and
caressing with an instruction not to have intercourse. It may be that mutual masturbation
(if acceptable to them culturally) will allow him to see that he can maintain erection and
reduce subsequent performance anxiety. Exploring sexuality together will also allow
them as a couple to better understand each other’s needs and preferences.
Many people’s problems disappear with time and reassurance. A request to visit you again
should the problem persist would allow you to review the situation and make a referral
to a psychosexual clinic for support, if the problem does not resolve with reassurance
and information.
KEY POINTS

• Many people are anxious about sexual performance, especially in a new relationship.
• Simple advice and reassurance may be effective, with follow-up should the situation
not improve with time.

• A psychosexual clinic can sometimes be helpful if problems persist.
118

CASE 47:

I LOVE HIM BUT I DON’T WANT SEX

A 23-year-old woman presents with her new husband. He states that they had been
dating for two years and his girlfriend had expressed a preference to wait to consummate
their relationship until after marriage. They did this but since marriage she has clearly
been reluctant for sex and is fearful of it. He explains that he is happy to be patient but
has become increasingly concerned that she views any physical affection by him as
pressure by him to engage in sexual activity. They have both felt that this issue is
affecting other aspects of their relationship. The husband has had previous sexual
relationships and denies any problems. The woman appears anxious about these
discussions.
When you see the woman alone, she confesses that she has had two sexual relationships
in the past. Both were ‘horrible’ experiences and in both relationships she did not feel her
needs were met. She found the sex uncomfortable and on occasions painful. The second
boyfriend had described her as ‘frigid’. She was relieved when her current partner
accepted that they would refrain from sex until after marriage. She has not discussed her
previous experiences with her husband. She recalls feeling very uncomfortable with a
friend of her father’s who had made suggestive remarks when she was about 18 and had
just had her first sexual relationship. Her parents are very religious and she was brought
up to believe that sex before marriage was not acceptable. They rarely talked about it,
and always switched the television over if there were any sexual or intimate scenes of
any kind.
The woman feels that sexual issues aside the relationship with her husband is good. She
finds her own responses to his displays of affection upsetting as she can understand why
he finds it hurtful. She says that she would like to have a sex life, but she finds herself
becoming very fearful and sometimes when her husband is being physically affectionate
in bed, it makes her feel almost like ‘she is being raped’, even though he has never forced
himself on her, and he always leaves her alone when she makes it clear she does not want
it. She cannot explain this thought and wishes it was not there so that she could relax
and enjoy their relationship. She wonders if having such a strong moral upbringing has
made her regard sex as ‘bad’. She works as a retail assistant and is happy in her job. There
is no medical history of note. She drinks socially and does not smoke. She has not taken
any illicit drugs.

Mental state examination
She presents as anxious but is open and communicative especially when seen alone. She
describes herself as reasonably happy although is finding the current issue stressful. There
is no deliberate self-harm ideation or any evidence of psychosis.
Physical examination
She tenses up when a vaginal examination is suggested but once reassured settles. There
is nothing abnormal to find on examination.
Questions
• What are the types of sexual dysfunction that women may experience?
• What is the problem that this patient most likely has?
• What are the causes of sexual dysfunction in women?
• What are the appropriate treatment options?

119

ANSWER 47
In a relationship, discrepencies between the parties in sexual desire is common and is
usually worked through until an equilibrium is reached. It could be cyclical and related
to periods, or related to changes in life-events (for example, having a baby), and these
are usually dealt with supportively as part of the normal ebb and flow in the course of
every relationship. Some couples present with greater problems than this.
Lack of arousal or desire may be temporary or ongoing. This may lead to difficulty
becoming aroused or having an orgasm. In other cases, the woman feels sexual desire but
cannot become aroused. Orgasm may not occur or may take a long time. In the latter case
this usually simply requires the couple to understand this. This may be related to mood,
atmosphere, timing, privacy or foreplay and all of these things can be adjusted if couples
communicate with each other. If orgasm does not occur, many women get pleasure from
love-making in other ways (caressing, intimacy etc.). Some may get distressed and
frustrated, especially if desire heightens without release. It can create a vicious cycle in
which the woman loses interest in sex because the experience is not pleasurable.
Anorgasmia may be caused by the factors described above, hormonal problems,
depression, bereavement or systemic illnesses and these can all be addressed. Sometimes
there can be no discernible cause.
Lack of desire or fear of sex can also be related to myriad different problems. There may
be pain during intercourse (dyspareunia). This may be because of vaginal inflammation
or dryness, vaginismus, endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. A cause for this
should be sought and treated. Side effects from medication such as neuroleptics,
chemotherapeutic agents and cardiovascular medication can affect arousal. Psychological
morbidity can affect sexual functioning including depression, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, anxiety and drug or alcohol abuse. Guilt, stress and resentment can all affect a
woman’s sexual function. Difficulties in an aspect of the relationship such as financial
pressures, stresses of combining work and home life and childrearing issues may also be
at play. Many people, either because of the way they were brought up or because of
earlier bad experiences, do not view sex as a healthy part of a couple’s relationship. Either
partner may have unrealistic expectations about sex or make unreasonable requests. If
the relationship is not good (for example, if it involves fear or lack of mutual support)
intimacy may be unwanted. Domestic violence would be an extreme example. History of
abuse may lead to strong emotional negative responses to sexual intimacy or a lack of
trust in her partner enough to relax and become aroused.
This woman should not be regarded as being ill, but may have a problem with fear of
sexuality. It is important to make sure that the woman herself wants help and she remains
in control of her own body. If she does, this should be forthcoming without stigma.
Counselling is the first line of treatment. This will help the woman consider her previous
experiences (both of sex and her upbringing) that are factors in the current presentation.
The goal is to deal with attitudes that hinder her ability to view sex as enjoyable,
establishing new attitudes that increase healthy sexual experiences. A sex therapist may
take couples therapy one step further by focusing on the couple’s physical relationship.
After identifying the couple’s attitudes about sex and the sexual problem, the sex therapist
recommends specific exercises to re-focus the couple’s attention and expectations. Group
therapy or specialized support groups may allow a woman to discuss her problems with
others who share them. Women often gain insight and practical solutions from these
groups, as well as a greater confidence from knowing they are not alone.
120

KEY POINTS

• Sexual problems of an acute or chronic nature are common.
• Physical causes need to be excluded.
• Sensitive and careful history taking is important.

CASE 48:

TREATMENT OF HEROIN ADDICTION

History
A 19-year-old young man is brought to the general practitioner surgery by his sister with
complaints of nausea, vomiting, body ache, fever, shivering and poor sleep over the past
2 days. He complains of having the ‘flu’ but his sister is worried that his symptoms may
be related to drug use. He normally lives with his parents but is visiting her for the
weekend. She says that he began smoking at the age of 14 and was using cannabis at age
16. He used to sniff glue aged 17 and was dabbling with opiates. Initially, he started
smoking but then graduated to intravenous injections. He has been arrested twice for
possession of Class A drugs and given cautions. His sister is extremely concerned about
him. He denies using drugs in the presence of his sister. He says that he has experienced
withdrawal having been without opiates for 48 hours when he could not find a dealer
locally. Over the past few years the cost of his habit with heroin has increased from £20
a week to £300 per week. He admits that the drug clinic was not successful and that he
now injects heroin twice a day. He enjoys the rush that he gets, but equally knows that
he has needed to use more of the drug to achieve the same effect. He had enrolled in a
youth training scheme but dropped out. He now has a rather fixed routine whereby he
spends the day at home watching DVDs going out later in the day with his friends for ‘a
fix’. He acknowledges that he ought to be ‘getting out there’ trying to get a job but said
he did not have the confidence to do so as he had made several unsuccessful attempts at
quitting. He does not abuse alcohol though he smokes 20 cigarettes a day. He gets job
seekers’ allowance and says that he borrows money to fund his drug habit.
Mental state examination
He appears as a sullen, lanky young man, reluctant to talk. He speaks slowly but
coherently and there is no evidence of any psychotic symptoms. He appears tired and is
yawning repeatedly. His mood appears anxious and there is distinct psychomotor
agitation. He has some insight into his substance misuse but presently begs to be
prescribed some codeine or morphine for instant relief.
Physical examination
He has injection track marks in his cubital veins. His blood pressure is 148/98 mmHg and
pulse is 94/min, regular. His pupils appear dilated. He complains of muscle tenderness but
there is no significant finding on systemic examination.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What is the management plan?
• His sister is anxious to know what causes ‘drug addiction’ and wants to know what she
can do to help. What will you tell her?

123

ANSWER 48
This young man meets the ICD-10 criteria for dependence syndrome (in this case opiates),
based on the following criteria: (a) strong desire or compulsion to take the substance; (b)
difficulty in controlling substance-use behaviour; (c) physiological withdrawal on
discontinuation of or reduction of substance intake; (d) evidence of tolerance (need for
increasing doses of medication to achieve the initial effect of the drug); (e) progressive
neglect of other interests; (f) persistence with substance use despite evidence of harmful
consequences. Narrowing of the personal repertoire of pattern of substance misuse (for
example, always injecting with friends as opposed to at home) is also present.
Currently, however, he seems to be in opiate withdrawal.

!

Symptoms and signs of opiate withdrawal

• Autonomic symptoms such as sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rhinorrhoea,
•
•
•
•

lacrimation, shivering and piloerection (‘cold turkey’ refers to piloerection, or
‘gooseflesh’).
Body aches or abdominal cramps.
Significant craving for opiates.
Central nervous system arousal such as sleeplessness, psychomotor agitation
and tremors.
Repeated yawning.

Heroin withdrawal typically peaks within 36–48 hours after discontinuation but
symptoms persist for 7–14 days. Viral or bacterial gastroenteritis, acute pancreatitis,
peptic ulcer or intestinal obstruction may mimic moderate to severe opioid withdrawal
and need to be excluded as do psychiatric diagnoses such as mania, agitated depression
and panic disorder. Co-morbid substance misuse is common and withdrawal from
benzodiazepines and alcohol (tremulousness, delirium and seizures) or intoxication with
substances such as amphetamines (sympathetic overactivity) must also be considered.
Detailed history, mental state examination, physical examination for needle marks and
appropriate investigations (urine toxicology screen, complete blood count and electrolyte
levels) help clarify the diagnosis. He needs to be admitted to hospital to monitor his
haemodynamic status, pupil size and bowel sounds. Opioid withdrawal is treated either
by substitution with a long-acting opioid such as methadone or symptomatically with
medications such as clonidine and benzodiazepines. He should be monitored closely for
signs of continued illicit drug use. Psychological support and treatment of any co-morbid
psychiatric illness (‘dual diagnosis’) is vital to improve long-term outcome.
His sister’s concerns need to be addressed with an explanation of the biopsychosocial
factors involved in aetiology. Opioid agonists act on μ receptors rapidly producing
physical dependence with strong reinforcement due to their euphoric effects. Gene
polymorphisms have been implicated but environmental factors play a stronger role in
causation. Social factors such as inner city living, unemployment and poor parental
functioning may play a role in initiation of drug use which is then maintained by reward
conditioning. Psychological factors such as peer culture, education disenfranchisement
and personality traits of curiosity and rebelliousness may also be related to initiation of
drug use. Compassionate support without frustration even in the face of relapses,
encouraging attendance at groups such as Narcotics Anonymous, and support for family
through self-help groups are likely to positively influence the outcome.
124

KEY POINTS

• Sudden discontinuation of opioid intake in opiate-dependent individuals precipitates
withdrawal, usually requiring in-patient assessment and treatment.

• Family support and psychological support is key to long-term cure.

CASE 49:

EXHIBITIONISM

History
A 26-year-old carpet fitter presents to the emergency department having become
embroiled in a fight. He says that a woman’s boyfriend hit out at him for no reason.
However, the paramedics report that the man had apparently ‘flashed at the girlfriend and
may have been masturbating’. Her boyfriend had sought to find out what was happening
and a fight had started. The patient insists that he did not do anything inappropriate.
When asked directly how he explains the other versions of events he finally
acknowledges that perhaps he had accidentally exposed his genitals. He then insists that
this has never happened before, but when he is told that the police are waiting to
interview him, he confesses he has been cautioned once before. He then states that he
feels that he is not in control of himself and feels compelled to expose himself. He
describes a tension that builds up inside him and a sense of relief when he has exposed.
He admits that he has gradually exposed more on each occasion.
Mental state examination
His eye contact is furtive, but intermittently good. He is slightly agitated and appears
anxious about the police wanting to interview him. His speech is normal. There are no
signs of intoxication and his breath does not smell of alcohol. He is despondent in mood
in the context of today’s events, but there is no evidence to suggest depression. He can
enjoy himself, holds down a job and has plans for his future. He does not have any
hallucinations, thought disorder or delusions. He is orientated in time, place and person.
There is no cognitive impairment.
A neurological examination is normal.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• How would this be managed?

127

ANSWER 49
Several differential diagnoses should be considered. Organic conditions that may lead to
disinhibition (such as drug and alcohol use, dementia or a space-occupying lesion) should
be excluded. Organic causes are unlikely here given the history and normal neurological
examination, although taking a fuller drug and alcohol history or obtaining a history
about recent illness or behaviour from next of kin may be helpful. It is important to
exclude exhibitionism as a presenting symptom in schizophrenia and affective disorder,
especially mania where disinhibition is common. Some people with learning disabilities
or Asperger syndrome may develop inappropriate sexually related behaviours. This may
be through poor education or inappropriate channelling of sexual feelings and
frustrations. A psychoeducational approach with support and reinforcement for healthy
behaviours is often productive here. This man is not learning disabled, although some
judicious questions to exclude autistic spectrum disorder may be warranted.
Exhibitionism can also occur without a mental illness and may or may not be related to
antisocial personality disorder.
Exhibitionism is the exposure of one’s genitals to a stranger, usually with no intention of
further sexual activity with the other person. In some cases, the exhibitionist masturbates
while exposing himself (or while fantasizing that he is exposing himself). Some
exhibitionists are aware of a conscious desire to shock or upset their target, while others
fantasize that the target will become sexually aroused by their display. Several theories
have been proposed regarding the origins of exhibitionism but there is no established
aetiology. Almost all reported cases involve males but this may have much to do with
gender and societal behaviours in that there is less censure when women expose
themselves. Exposure for subcultural reasons (for example, naturism) or for a bet (for
example, streaking) have different psychosocial meaning.
You need a thorough history (including sexual behaviours), mental state and neurological
examination to rule out head trauma, seizures, or other abnormalities of brain structure
and function. Blood and urine tests for substance abuse and sexually transmitted
diseases, including an HIV screen, should be considered.
Cognitive behaviour therapy is generally regarded as the most effective form of
psychotherapy for exhibitionism. Group therapy when used needs to be done in an expert
way to avoid reinforcing or perpetuating the thrill that the perpetrators may experience
in discussion. Couples therapy or family therapy can be used if these relationships have
been damaged, and if therapy is likely to be reparative. Social skills training and
education will be helpful in learning disabilities and autistic spectrum disorder.
Medications such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be tried if there is a strong
obsessive-compulsive component. In some deviant sexual behaviours where there is a risk
to others and psychosocial therapies have not worked, then assessment for hormonal
interventions may be warranted. Consented surgery such as castration is usually reserved
only for very serious and repeat sexual offenders.
The prognosis depends on several factors, including the age of onset, the reasons for the
patient’s referral to psychiatric care, degree of cooperation with the therapist, and comorbidity with other paraphilias (psychosexual disorders) or other mental disorders. People
with exhibitionism have the highest recidivism rate of all the paraphilias. Recognition of
paraphilias in adolescents and treatment for those at risk could lower the risk of recidivism.
KEY POINTS

• Exhibitionism is one of a range of paraphilias.
• Treatment is difficult and recidivism is high.

CASE 50:

RAPID TRANQUILLIZATION

History
A 22-year-old young man is admitted to a psychiatric in-patient unit under Section 2 of
the Mental Health Act. On admission, he is extremely agitated and hostile. He is very
upset about having been admitted. He believes that he is of royal descent and is
determined to punish those who are involved in ‘imprisoning’ him. It is reported by his
family that he has no actual royal lineage, but that he sees himself as the person chosen
to establish a new world government. He has been angry and physically aggressive
towards family members who contradict him. His grandmother banged the back of her
head when she was pushed against a wall and has a bruised face. He refuses to allow a
detailed mental status examination. He is pacing up and down the ward intimidating
other patients. He is laughing out aloud, talking to himself. He repeatedly makes
threatening gestures at the ward staff.
He lives with his grandmother. He has no contact with his father. His mother died of a
drug overdose when he was 6 years old. He uses cannabis regularly spending £20 a week
but does not abuse alcohol or any other drugs. He smokes 40 cigarettes a day. There is
no significant previous medical or psychiatric history. He has been behaving strangely,
according to his grandmother, for the past 2 weeks. She has observed him spending a lot
of money and talking openly about his sexual exploits to her. He has hardly slept over
the past week. Two days ago, he threatened her and pushed her when she tried to urge
him to see the doctor. Since then, she has been feeling increasingly frightened of him. He
was prescribed the antipsychotic medication olanzapine 5 mg nocte, which he has taken
a few nights. However, this morning, he hit her. She reported the matter to the police,
which ultimately led to his admission.

Mental state examination
He appears dishevelled bearing three-day-old stubble. He is pacing imperiously up and
down the ward corridor, singing out loud. He also laughs and talks to himself. Any
attempts to interview him result in him swearing and when he does agree to temporarily
come into the interview room he very quickly walks out slamming the door as he goes.
He gives little eye contact and appears preoccupied with his own thoughts. It is not
possible to discuss his thoughts or experiences with him.
Physical examination
He refuses a physical examination.
Question
• How will you manage him?

129

ANSWER 50
This man is presenting with acute agitation, aggression and grandiose delusions. This may
be an acute manic or psychotic episode, though an organic disorder or a drug-induced
episode need to be borne in mind. The immediate problem is containment of agitation and
violence. NICE guidance advocates a 3-step approach.
Risk assessment should be a continuous process to evaluate current risk and predict future
risk. In this case, the risk for violence and aggression seems high as this man has several
risk factors – a recent history of violence, current psychotic symptoms, continuing
agitation, history of drug use, young age and male gender. He is irritable and has been
threatening staff. Maintaining personal safety is a vital part of this risk assessment as is
obtaining other information that informs this risk assessment. This may include GP notes,
corroborative history from his grandmother and medical and nursing records. Any advance
directives by the patient must be taken into account.
Prevention of violence using de-escalation involves calming disruptive behaviour, giving
clear choices and respecting dignity. Nursing observation levels should promote therapeutic
engagement. Four levels are commonly used (general open, intermittent observation, within
eyesight and within arm’s length).
Interventions include physical intervention, seclusion and rapid tranquillization. Physical
intervention – control and restraint – can compromise the patient’s breathing and should
be used sparingly only when necessary and by trained staff to safely immobilize an
individual at immediate risk. Seclusion, the supervised confinement of a patient in a
(usually locked) room, is to be used only as a last resort to ensure both the patient and staff
are safe in severely disturbed behaviour. Rapid tranquillization is preferable to other
physical interventions. Follow the local protocol. When agitation is non-psychotic or there
is cardiovascular risk history, a short-acting benzodiazepine such as lorazepam is the first
choice medication. Commence with 2 mg orally, if required repeated after at least 30
minutes. If oral medication is not accepted, intramuscular (IM) may be used beginning with
a dose of 1 mg, repeated if required with 2 mg after at least 30 minutes. Maximum daily
dose should not exceed 6 mg. Diazepam is long-acting and has poor intramuscular
absorption and should, therefore be avoided. The major tranquillizers olanzapine velotabs
(5–10 mg maximum/24 hours) or haloperidol (5 mg oral, maximum 30 mg/day) may be
added if there is no improvement with benzodiazepine alone. When psychotic agitation is
present as in this case, a combination of lorazepam 1–2 mg oral with the haloperidol
5–10 mg or with olanzapine 5–10 mg oral may be offered, repeated if required after at least
30 minutes. If offered as an IM dose, separate syringes must be used. IM lorazepam must
not be given within one hour of IM olanzapine. Seek senior advice early and all through
this process monitor the patient’s pulse, temperature, blood pressure and respiratory rate
regularly (every 5–10 minutes until the patient is calm and ambulatory and hourly after
that). Risk of cardiac arrest or respiratory depression is increased by physical agitation,
physical interventions and by drugs used in rapid tranquillization. Resuscitation expertise
and equipment must be nearby.
KEY POINTS

• Always use de-escalation as the preferred strategy to manage violence.
• Follow local rapid tranquillization protocol policy when using medication.

CASE 51:

PALPITATIONS

History
You go on a home visit to a 35-year-old woman who has recurrent palpitations. She
thinks they are anxiety related but her mother is worried that there is something wrong
with her heart. She describes an episode two years ago where she suffered marked
palpitations when on a busy bus in the summer. She felt she couldn’t breathe but couldn’t
exit the bus. Despite pressing the button for the next stop the bus had to travel a further
mile and she felt trapped. At one point she believed she was going to collapse.
A few weeks later she felt a wave of panic when a bus passed her or she was near a bus
stop. Now she experiences regular attacks, usually when she goes out. During these
attacks she experiences palpitations, starts shaking and sweating and has difficulty
breathing. She can only go out with diazepam in her pocket although she rarely uses any.
These episodes rarely happen at home. They are not associated with any chest pain or
neurological deficit such as visual, motor or sensory disturbance.

Mental state examination
For most of the interview she maintains good eye contact and is able to give a clear and
coherent history of her problems. Her appearance is normal as is her behaviour, although
she is a little on edge. Her speech is normal in flow and content and her mood is
subjectively and objectively within healthy limits. There is no thought passivity and no
evidence of any psychotic phenomena. Cognition is not tested.
Blood pressure is 125/70 mmHg and pulse at interview is 86/min. There is no goitre.

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis and what do you need to exclude?
• Using a cognitive behavioural model to understand her problems, what key elements
need to be considered in the treatment programme?

131

ANSWER 51
It is prudent to exclude cardiac or endocrine abnormalities, and this can be done through
history, physical examination and investigations including thyroid function tests and
electrocardiogram. The most likely diagnosis is panic disorder. This can be understood in
terms of a biopsychosocial model, which gives a framework to understand how biological
factors can interact with psychological and environmental factors in the context of
illnesses, including mental health problems. The disorder includes physical symptoms
(palpitations, excess sweating, tremor, rapid breathing) and powerful subjective emotions
(anxiety) that result in particular behaviours (avoidance of situations that provoke
attacks).
This theory informs the main psychological treatment modality, which is cognitive
behaviour therapy (CBT). CBT is based on the recognition that sensations, thoughts,
behaviour and emotions constantly interact with each other in a dynamic way and in the
context of the environment.

Sensation

Thought

Emotion

Figure 51.1 Interactions in cognitive
behaviour therapy

Psychoeducational work explains how the autonomic nervous system responds to
thoughts and emotions to produce more symptoms. The sympathetic nervous system
releases adrenaline and contributes to a vicious cycle where misinterpretation of
autonomic symptoms triggers further thoughts and emotions. Resultant behaviours may
include avoiding situations that trigger these feelings or safety behaviours such as
carrying diazepam. These can be challenged with explanation and with behavioural
experiments using exposure and desensitization techniques. For example, experiments
may record diaries of thoughts and feelings when safety behaviours or avoidance are not
employed. Any catastrophic thinking resulting from the misinterpretation of symptoms,
such as thoughts that the heart will ‘explode’ or that one is about to ‘collapse and die’,
need to be challenged with education. By supporting changes in behaviour, healthier
patterns of responses are nurtured enabling confidence to be rebuilt.
On occasion it is necessary to use medication alongside CBT. Benzodiazepines,
antipsychotics or sedating antihistamines should not be used. The most effective
medication is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Patients should be warned about side effects
including the potential withdrawal effects.
KEY POINTS

• Panic disorder responds well to CBT.
• Panic disorder can lead to agoraphobia.
• The medication of choice if necessary are licensed SSRIs.

CASE 52:

THOUGHTS OF KILLING HER BABY

History
A 28-year-old mother of a 2-month-old baby boy attends the GP surgery having been
referred by her health visitor as she had become concerned about the safety of the baby
following a routine postnatal check up. The mother says that she is finding it difficult to
cope with the baby and sometimes has had thoughts that it would have been better if the
baby was dead. She has feelings of guilt about having such thoughts and believes that
she is not a good mother. The baby was born at full term via a normal vaginal delivery.
The labour lasted 18 hours and there were no other complications. She reported feeling
low and tearful during the first week post-partum but said that her mood improved within
a few days. However, over the past 6 weeks, she describes feeling low and tired all the
time. She complains of low energy levels, poor concentration and does not enjoy looking
after her son as much as she did in the past. She feels overwhelmed with the responsibility
of looking after the baby and has lost her self-confidence. Her sleep is poor.
She works as a nurse in a local hospital and went off work at 32 weeks of pregnancy.
She was treated for a depressive episode by her GP 4 years ago. She had been prescribed
fluoxetine 20 mg once a day. She took the medication for a year and then stopped the
medication as she felt better. There is no other psychiatric or medical history. Her parents
are retired and live in a different city. Her mother suffers from recurrent depressive
disorder and has been treated with ECT in the past.
This is her first child and it was a planned pregnancy. She lives with her husband who is
an engineer. She describes herself as a perfectionist who likes doing things in a particular
way. She is a non-smoker and a social drinker.

Mental state examination
This woman is seen by her GP at home. She is dressed in her night clothes, has greasy
hair and has not taken a shower. She is holding the baby appropriately but does not smile
or make eye contact with the baby. During the interview she bottle feeds the baby. She
has discontinued breast feeding due to mastitis. She feels that she has let her baby down
by not being able to breast feed. She speaks in a monotonous voice and becomes tearful
when asked how she is coping. She has feelings of guilt about not being a good mother.
She says that she has had thoughts that it would be better if the baby was dead. On one
occasion an image of her putting a pillow over the baby’s face flashed through her mind,
although she says she would never do this. She finds these thoughts distressing. She has
thoughts of wanting to be dead, but does not have any definite suicidal plans. Cognitive
examination did not reveal any impairment.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?

133

ANSWER 52
This woman is suffering from postnatal depression, which is defined as depression
occurring after child birth. It is seen most often within 4 weeks of child birth but can
occur up to 6 months post-partum. The symptoms of postnatal depression are similar to
those seen in a depressive disorder. She has all the core symptoms of depression including
low mood, low energy levels and anhedonia. These symptoms have been present for more
than 2 weeks. She also has additional symptoms of depression such as feelings of guilt,
loss of confidence, poor sleep and suicidal thoughts. She has had an episode of depression
in the past and therefore fulfils the criteria for a recurrent depressive disorder, with the
current episode being moderate to severe. The prevalence rate of postnatal depression is
between 8% and 20%. Many women have had depression in the past. It is important to
screen for depression in pregnancy and health visitors can use the Edinburgh Postnatal
Depression Scale (EPDS) as a part of antenatal check up.

!

Differential diagnosis

• Post-partum blues are seen in up to 75% of women and are characterized by a
•

mild self-limiting episode of mood disturbance lasting a few days. It usually begins
3 to 10 days post-partum (peak onset day 5 to 7) and resolves spontaneously.
Post-partum psychosis is seen in 1% of women and is characterized by rapid onset
of labile mood, thought disorder, confusion and disorientation. Previous history
and family history of mental illness particularly of bipolar disorder are significant
risk factors. This is a severe disorder and often requires in-patient treatment.
Delirium (for example, infective) needs to be excluded with this presentation.

Management
This woman needs to be referred to a specialist Mother and Baby (Perinatal Psychiatric)
team for urgent assessment of the risk of harm to the baby and risk of self-harm, which
dictates the course of further management. One option, depending on risk and choice, is
admission to the Mother and Baby Unit for further assessment and management. There
are several benefits of admitting mother and baby together. It lets the mother continue to
breast feed, allows for healthy development of attachment and maintains the confidence
of the mother in her parenting ability. Parenting assessment allows early detection of
problems with attachment and institution of remedial measures. Treatment for the
depression includes cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacotherapy.
Lofepramine, fluoxetine and sertraline, although expressed in breast milk, are considered
relatively safe, unlike medications such as lithium and sodium valproate which should
not be used in breast-feeding mothers. If the parenting assessment raises concerns about
the safety of the child (risk of harm or neglect) then a referral to the child protection team
should be made. Occasionally use of the Mental Health Act is necessary especially if there
is high risk and little insight from the mother.
KEY POINTS

• Childbirth is a vulnerable period for women with risk of post-partum blues, post-partum
depression and post-partum psychosis.

• Be aware of medications expressed in breast milk.
• Risk to the baby should dictate early involvement of specialist mother and baby team
and child protection team.

• Health visitors and GPs need to have a high index of suspicion.
134

CASE 53:

MY WIFE IS HAVING AN AFFAIR

History
A 45-year-old publican presents to his general practitioner complaining of being unable
to cope with his wife’s behaviour. He goes on to tell the GP that his wife of over 20 years
has recently begun to have numerous affairs with customers at the pub they run. He can
tell who his wife has had an affair with because of the ‘way she looks at them’. He has
confronted her about this on several occasions but she denies his accusations. As a result
of his suspicions, he keeps a log of the mileage of her car to check where she has been.
His wife has become very upset by the change in his behaviour and has moved into the
spare bedroom. He has taken this as further confirmation that she is having an affair.
He first became concerned about his wife’s behaviour a month ago. Since that time his
mood has been low and he has become increasing preoccupied by thoughts of her
infidelity. His sleep, appetite and concentration are poor. He has begun to have financial
problems as he is finding it hard to run the public house due to the stress he is under.
He has previously suffered from moderate depressive episodes and stopped his antidepressant medication over a year ago. There is no other past medical or psychiatric
history of note. He describes himself as a ‘social drinker’ due to his job. On direct
questioning he admits to a gradual increase in his alcohol intake over the last couple of
years. He is now drinking every day and typically consumes in excess of 60 units per
week. There is no history of illicit substance abuse.

Mental state examination
He has good eye contact, and is perspiring. He presents as an overweight middle-aged
man who is slightly unkempt and smells of alcohol. He is initially reluctant to talk about
his difficulties, repeatedly saying that his wife would not be having affairs if he was ‘a
real man’. He reports that his mood is ‘terrible’ and objectively he appears low. His
thought content is mainly concerned with the belief that his wife is being unfaithful. He
is unwilling to even accept the possibility that he may be mistaken, yet has no concrete
evidence upon which he has reached this conclusion. There is no abnormality of
perception and his cognition is grossly intact. He does not think he is mentally unwell,
but is willing to accept help to deal with the stress he is under.
Physical examination
The only abnormality upon physical examination is palmar erythema and mild
hepatomegaly.
Questions
• What term is used to describe this presentation?
• What is the differential diagnosis for this presentation?
• Who may be at risk from this patient?

135

ANSWER 53
This patient falsely believes that his wife is being unfaithful. He has reached this
conclusion in the absence of any appropriate evidence and despite evidence to the
contrary. He holds this belief with absolute conviction and he is becoming increasing
preoccupied by this belief. This presentation is often referred to as pathological jealousy
(also known as morbid jealousy or Othello syndrome). Pathological jealousy is a
descriptive term rather than a diagnosis and its differential diagnosis is shown in the
box below.

!

Differential diagnosis of pathological jealousy

• Depressive episode with psychotic symptoms – evidence of sustained low mood
•
•
•
•
•
•

with decreased sleep, appetite and concentration. Psychotic symptoms are in
keeping with low mood (i.e. mood congruent).
Delusional disorder – presence of delusional beliefs with an absence of other
symptoms such as hallucinations.
Schizophrenia – presence of delusions and hallucinations with an absence of
prominent mood symptoms.
Schizoaffective disorder – mood and psychotic symptoms are equally prominent
but psychotic symptoms may not be in keeping with the expressed mood
(i.e. mood incongruent).
Organic psychosis – may be due to alcohol/ illicit substance abuse or underlying
physical disorder such as brain tumour or temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
Paranoid personality disorder – lifelong pattern of suspicion of the motives of
others with a tendency to misperceive neutral events as hostile and threatening.
Asperger syndrome with misinterpretation of the motives of others.

Those with pathological jealousy are distressed by their false belief in their partner’s
infidelity and show unreasonable behaviour (such as checking for proof that their partner
is being unfaithful and frequent accusations). This can escalate to become increasingly
extreme. This combination of strong emotions and acting upon delusional beliefs is
particularly dangerous. The patient’s partner may be at increased risk and the risk of
homicide in such situations can be high. Other people could also be at risk from the
patient if he believes that they are involved in his partner’s infidelity. Finally, the patient
himself is at increased risk of suicide due to the high level of distress and conviction that
his partner is being unfaithful. These risks will be further increased in the presence of
alcohol/illicit substance abuse.
KEY POINTS

• Pathological jealousy is a descriptive term, not a diagnosis and a careful assessment
should be made to obtain an underlying diagnosis.

• Those presenting with these symptoms may pose a risk to themselves, their partners
•

136

and others. Co-morbid substance misuse is often present and further increases the risk
of harm to others and self.
A detailed risk assessment must be conducted in all cases of pathological jealousy.

CASE 54:

A MAN IN POLICE CUSTODY

History
A 20-year-old roofer is brought to the emergency department by the police. He is under
arrest after having been charged with assaulting his girlfriend. They had both been
drinking and then had an argument during which he punched her several times. During
the ensuing struggle he fell and struck his head on the kerb. Following this he was
unresponsive for a few seconds. When the police arrived he was alert and denied any
physical problems. While in the police van, on the way to the police station, he vomited
and appeared to become unresponsive for approximately 30 seconds.
In the custody cell, he is loudly shouting and swearing at the accompanying police
officers. On attempting to get a history, he becomes more agitated repeatedly shouting, ‘I
know what you’re here for. They want you to give me a lethal injection.’
He is normally fit and well and has no previous history of psychiatric disorder or
substance abuse. The accompanying police officers say that he has not been previously
known to the police.

Mental state examination
He presents as a slim, reasonably kempt young man who smells of alcohol. He is agitated
and restless, and eye contact is variable. He is difficult to engage and answers most
questions by being verbally abusive. After some persuasion, he eventually acknowledges
that he is being offered help and he agrees to cooperate with the assessment. His speech
is loud, rapid and slurred. He says that he is worried that the police might want to kill
him and that he can see bats flying around the department. Upon cognitive testing he is
able to correctly tell his name and date of birth but is not able to correctly state the
current day, month or year. His short-term memory also appears to be impaired.
Physical examination
Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination is normal. Upon neurological
examination he has an up-going left plantar response but no other abnormality.
Questions
• What investigations would you want to carry out in this patient?
• The police and nurses tell you that he is ‘just drunk’ and request your advice about
returning him to police custody as soon as you have finished your physical
examination. What would be your response?

137

ANSWER 54
Although he appears intoxicated with alcohol and agitated following the argument with
his girlfriend there are several indicators of a possible organic cause for his current
presentation (such as subdural haematoma). He has a history of having sustained a recent
head injury that caused him to lose consciousness and since then he has vomited and had
a further brief period of possible loss of consciousness. There is also a non-specific
abnormality on neurological examination. His speech is slurred and he is agitated
(although this could also be due to alcohol intoxication). In addition to this he has
psychotic symptoms (believing that the police want to kill him and seeing bats) and
cognitive impairment (disorientated to time and impaired short-term memory) which are
probably of acute onset. While visual hallucinations can occur in functional mental
illnesses (such as schizophrenia) they are relatively rare and often indicate the presence
of an underlying organic disorder. Given all these factors it is important to rule out any
possible organic causes of this man’s presentation by physical examination and
appropriate use of investigations.
INVESTIGATIONS

• Obtain further collateral history – previous medical records (including
•
•

•

psychiatric and general practitioner notes if available) and further information
from the police and the patient’s girlfriend/family.
Urine illicit drug screen to exclude intoxication with drugs such as amphetamine
or cannabis.
Blood tests including full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes (U+Es),
calcium, liver function tests (LFTs), thyroid function tests (TFTs) and C-reactive
protein (CRP). The results of these tests will help to exclude infection or
metabolic derangement.
Computerized tomography (CT) brain scan to exclude cerebrovascular event (i.e.
haemorrhage or infarction) or space-occupying lesion (i.e. tumour, subdural
haematoma or abscess).

Given the high index of suspicion of an organic basis for this man’s presentation it is
imperative that he does not leave the emergency department until this has either been
excluded or he has received appropriate treatment. Your response to these requests should
be to politely but firmly point out that there are some parts of this man’s presentation
that do not fit with a simple diagnosis of ‘acute alcohol intoxication’. You should state
that it is important he receives appropriate clinical care, based on the results of these
investigations, to exclude other organic causes. If an organic cause is excluded and he is
thought to be mentally ill, then the police could detain the patient under section 136 of
the Mental Health Act 1983 to allow further assessment of whether he should be
compulsorily admitted to a psychiatric hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983.
KEY POINTS

• The acute onset of cognitive problems or psychotic symptoms (especially visual
hallucinations) may indicate an acute organic condition.

• Always have a high index of suspicion for organic causes of ‘psychiatric’ presentations
and employ appropriate physical examination and investigations to rule them out.

• Alcohol intoxication may mask the presence of underlying physical conditions.

138

CASE 55:

STALKING

History
A 20-year-old mathematics student is referred by the university counselling service. He
is currently suspended from his studies due to alleged harassment of a female student. He
has been repeatedly sending this student text messages (over 20 per day for the last 6
months) and spends much of his day loitering around the halls of residence where she
lives. He has told his family that he and the female student are engaged and that when
they met, it was ‘love at first sight’. The female student denies this saying that she has
never had a relationship with him, has no wish to do so and that she finds his behaviour
towards her extremely upsetting. She has informed him on numerous occasions that she
does not wish to have any contact with him. At the request of his tutor he was seen by
the university counselling service. During the initial assessment he told the counsellor
that he and the female student were in love and that he felt angry that she could not
admit this and had reported him to the university. Since she did this his behaviour
towards her has become more intense and he has had thoughts of killing her saying that
this would be the only way to maintain their ‘pure love’ without the interference
of others.
He has always been a somewhat shy and introverted person and he has never previously
had an intimate relationship. He has no personal or family history of psychiatric disorder.
He is socially isolated and has few friends, preferring to spend his free time playing
computer games. In the last two months he has been cautioned by the police regarding
his behaviour towards the female student but has no previous convictions.

Mental state examination
He avoids eye contact and is difficult to engage. He speaks in a monotonous voice and
becomes much more animated when discussing his love for the female student and his
hobby of playing computer games. His mood appears normal and there have not been
any recent changes in his sleep pattern or appetite. Throughout the interview he professes
his love for the female student and says that this is mutual but that she cannot show
others how she feels because they would be jealous of their ‘special relationship’. He
confirms that he has had intermittent thoughts of killing the female student as a way of
maintaining their ‘pure love’. There is no abnormality of perception and his cognition
is normal.
Questions
• What psychiatric disorders may be associated with this presentation?
• How would you manage the risk he may pose to the female student?

139

ANSWER 55
This stalking behaviour may be due to erotomania (also known as de Clerambault’s
syndrome) in which a person falsely believes, with delusional intensity, that another
person is in love with them. Erotomania is a descriptive term rather than a diagnosis and
some its potential causes are shown below.

• Delusional disorder involves the presence of delusions with an absence of other
psychopathology (i.e. no evidence of hallucinations or abnormality of mood).

• Schizophrenia will have evidence of hallucinations, thought disorder and delusions.
• Schizoaffective disorder has an equal presentation of schizophrenic and mood
symptomatology.

• Hypomania includes evidence of disinhibited behaviour and grandiose beliefs.
• Organic disorders will show evidence of substance abuse or physical illness on
physical examination.

• Schizoid personality disorder shows a long-standing pattern of avoidance of social
situations, emotional coldness and social awkwardness.

• Schizotypal personality disorder has a long-standing pattern of odd behaviour and
ideas with magical thinking and quasi-psychotic experiences.

• Autistic spectrum disorder – since early childhood evidence of impairment in social
relationships and communication; often accompanied by a narrow restricted range
of interests and repetitive behaviour. Mindblindness means that they have
difficulties understanding the emotions of others and frequently misinterpret their
intentions and feelings.
The main management of erotomania is treatment of the underlying disorder. However,
in cases such as these an assessment should be made of the risk that the patient may pose
to others. The object of the patient’s affection may be at particular risk and strong
feelings of love may suddenly turn to feelings of frustration, grievance and hate if the
patient feels his advances have been unfairly rejected. Other people may be at risk if the
patient feels that they are somehow responsible for the failure of the ‘relationship’.
In order to effectively manage this risk it may sometimes be necessary to involve other
services/agencies such as the police, probation service and social services. Given that the
patient may pose a particular risk to an identifiable individual, the issue of warning the
person that he/she is potentially at risk should also be considered. Doing this may be a
justifiable (and necessary) breach of medical confidentiality. This should only be done
following discussion with a senior colleague and careful evaluation of the risks and
benefits of disclosure and non-disclosure of this information.
KEY POINTS

• Stalking behaviour may be a symptom of mental illness.
• The management of such individuals may be complex and require the involvement of
•

140

several different agencies (for example, psychiatric services, police, probation service
and social services).
Where there is evidence that a named individual may be at risk from the patient
consideration should be given to breaking confidentiality and informing this person.

CASE 56:

AN ANGRY MAN

History
A 27-year-old unemployed man has been referred by his general practitioner for help
with managing his anger. He has recently moved to the area and no previous medical or
psychiatric notes are available. He tells you that he ‘lives on his wits’ but has just been
released from prison three weeks ago.
As a child he had behavioural problems and was expelled from several different schools.
He saw a child psychologist between the ages of 11 and 14 years. After leaving school at
15, with no qualifications, he has held a number of short-term unskilled jobs. He is
always able to get jobs but has trouble keeping them because his short temper leads him
to fall out with his colleagues. He says that he has a similar problem with relationships
and admits that he has previously been violent towards his partners. He has had extensive
contact with the criminal justice system and has spent much of the last 10 years in prison
for offences including burglary, grievous bodily harm, driving while disqualified, benefit
fraud and drugs offences. When discussing his previous offending he says that he was
justified in doing this because he needed the money and that the people he assaulted
deserved it and that he wishes he had caused them more injuries. He has a number of
debts upon which he has defaulted payment. He tells you that his criminal behaviour is
a failure of ‘the system’ and that he has been ‘forced’ into this lifestyle due to the failure
of others to provide him with sufficient support.
He denies any other previous psychiatric history but as the interview progresses he asks
if you can prescribe him benzodiazepines as he has been previously told by a ‘top
psychiatrist’ that these are the only treatment that will help him. He has received
treatment for a number of injuries received in ‘fights’ but denies any other past medical
history. He is currently living in a bail hostel where he is under the supervision of the
probation service. He has an extensive history of substance abuse that includes alcohol,
cannabis, heroin and amphetamine, but says that he has managed to remain abstinent
from these since being released from prison.

Mental state examination
He initially presents as appropriate and cooperative. His mood is euthymic and there is
no evidence of delusions or hallucinations. He becomes defensive when asked about his
previous contact with psychiatric services saying that it is ‘none of your business’. When
you decline to prescribe benzodiazepines he becomes angry and storms out of the room.
Questions
• Is there any evidence that this man is suffering from a personality disorder?
• If so what personality disorder is most likely?
• What features of this personality disorder does he display?

141

ANSWER 56
The evidence for this man having a personality disorder is that he displays evidence of
behaviours, cognitions and emotions that cause problems for him and others around him.
These difficulties are evident in a number of different situations and appear to have
persisted throughout his life and began in childhood. It is most likely that he is suffering
from dissocial personality disorder. This is an ICD-10 term; in the DSM-IV a similar
personality disorder is called antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). The features of this
that he displays are shown in the box below.

!

Features of dissocial (antisocial) personality disorder

• Evidence of Childhood Conduct Disorder (required for DSM-IV diagnosis of
Antisocial Personality Disorder but not for ICD-10 Dissocial Personality Disorder).

• Callous unconcern for the feelings of others.
• Gross and persistent irresponsibility and disregard for social rules, norms and
obligations.

• Unable to form enduring relationships although has no difficulty in establishing
them.

• Low tolerance to frustration and easily becomes angry or aggressive.
• Incapacity to experience guilt or profit from experience.
• Marked proneness to blame others for his difficulties.
Most people with this disorder do not seek psychiatric treatment. Patients with dissocial
personality disorder are often challenging to manage and can evoke strong negative
feeling in others. Recognizing these feelings (counter transference) is important and helps
in establishing and maintaining a therapeutic relationship. As would be expected from
the clinical features, they are at increased risk of engaging in criminality and violence.
They are also at increased risk of death from suicide, accidents and violence.
A diagnosis of dissocial personality disorder does not absolve an individual of
responsibility for any criminal acts that they commit. The criminal justice system (police,
prisons, courts and probation service) frequently manage such individuals (although they
may not necessarily be labelled as having this disorder). It is important to maintain clear
boundaries and rules when treating these patients. Any associated criminal offending is
often best managed by the criminal justice system rather than mental health services.
KEY POINTS

• In order to make a diagnosis of personality disorder it is important to take a detailed
history of the patient’s difficulties throughout their lifetime and in different situations.

• Patients with dissocial personality disorder can arouse negative counter transference.
Recognizing this helps therapeutic engagement.

• The diagnosis of dissocial personality does not absolve the patient of responsibility for
any criminal acts they commit and they may be more appropriately managed by the
criminal justice system.

CASE 57 :

TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION

History:
A 38-year-old receptionist is referred by her general practitioner to the psychiatric outpatient clinic as she has failed to respond to two different antidepressants. She was well
until 2 years ago when she started feeling very tired and found it difficult to concentrate
at work. Over the next 6 months, she developed back pain and joint pains. Detailed
investigations did not reveal any abnormality. She went on to develop anhedonia,
restlessness, poor sleep and excessive appetite leading to a weight gain of 6 kg over 6
months. She was getting increasingly irritable at work and so was prescribed the
serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram 20 mg daily by her GP. She took the tablets
consistently but with no benefit. The dose was increased gradually up to 60 mg a day
without any improvement. After nearly 4 months of treatment she had continued low
mood, low energy and anhedonia. Citalopram was discontinued and replaced with the
tetracyclic antidepressant mirtazapine. There was an initial marginal improvement in her
tiredness and sleep but this was transient. The dose of mirtazapine was increased up to
45 mg per day without any benefit.
She continues to attend work but feels tired and fed up all the time. She denies any ideas
of self-harm, but acknowledges that most mornings she has thoughts that she would be
better off dead. She had her appendix removed 5 years ago but has no other significant
medical history. There is no previous psychiatric history of note. She lives with her
boyfriend and their two cats in their own home. She reports reduced interest in sex, but
apart from that has a happy relationship with her boyfriend. Her father left her mother
when she was three. She has had no contact with her father since then. Her mother suffers
from multiple sclerosis, but there is no other family history. She has one elder sister who
is well. Pre-morbidly, she says that she was a happy-go-lucky person with no care in
the world.

Mental state examination
Her eye contact is steady but she appears downcast and lethargic. Her speech is slow and
soft though she gets somewhat agitated when talking about her father. Her mood is low
and her affect reflects this. She describes ideas of hopelessness, helplessness and
worthlessness. She does not have any ideas of self-harm. There is no evidence of any
psychotic symptoms.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?

143

ANSWER 57
This woman is presenting with a 2-year history of low mood, reduced energy, anhedonia,
reduced sleep and libido, weight gain, ideas of hopelessness, helplessness and
worthlessness. If organic causes of depression are excluded she thus meets the criteria for
a depressive episode. She has been treated with two different antidepressants (from
different groups), using appropriate doses for an appropriate duration but has not shown
an adequate response. This suggests a treatment-resistant depressive episode. The
definition of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is somewhat arbitrary, but NICE
guidance defines it as failure to return to a baseline mood state despite an adequate trial
with at least two antidepressant medications. So defined, 20–30% of patients with major
depression are treatment resistant. The causes of treatment resistance may include:

• Incorrect diagnosis: Bipolar mood disorder, personality disorder, schizoaffective
disorder, depression secondary to a medical disorder, adjustment disorder, persistent
stress/trauma, or dual diagnosis with drug or alcohol misuse.
• Inadequate treatment: Inadequate dose or duration of treatment, poor compliance or
incorrect choice of antidepressant therapy (for example, not using ECT in catatonic
depression).

!

Antidepressant groups

•
•
•
•
•

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] (for example, fluoxetine)
Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs] (for example, venlafaxine)
Tricyclics (for example, amitriptyline)
Tertracyclics (for example, mirtazapine)
Monamine oxidase inhibitors (for example, phenelzine)

This woman needs referral to specialist mental health services for management of her
TRD. The suggested step-wise protocol for managing TRD is as follows:

• Review diagnosis and alter treatment as appropriate.
• Review possibility of lifestyle changes.
• Optimize antidepressant dose (monotherapy with SSRI, venlafaxine, tricyclic
antidepressant [TCA] or mirtazapine).

• Ensure adequate duration of treatment.
• Optimize psychotherapy and social interventions where necessary. This may include
•
•
•
•

•

144

considering alteration in individual therapy modality (for example, cognitive
behaviour therapy, interpersonal therapy etc.), group or family therapy.
Switch to another antidepressant class (monotherapy with SSRI, venlafaxine, TCA or
mirtazapine).
Switch to TCA, venlafaxine or MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor).
Consider augmentation with lithium.
Consider use of antidepressant combinations that are least prone to toxicity and
interactions (mianserin or mirtazapine with SSRI; TCA + SSRI; venlafaxine + SSRI
etc.). Monitor for the potentially fatal serotonin syndrome characterized by the triad
of autonomic hyperactivity, neuromuscular dysfunction (tremors, myoclonic jerks)
and mental confusion or delirium.
Consider use of electroconvulsive therapy.

In this case, venlafaxine or a TCA may be the next management step.
KEY POINTS

• In cases of TRD, review diagnosis, dose, duration of treatment and co-morbidity (with
alcohol, drugs or other psychiatric or medical disorder).

• Identify TRD early and refer to the specialist mental health service for management as
per protocol above.

CASE 58:

TREATMENT RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA

History
A 26-year-old man is referred to the crisis intervention home treatment team by his
community psychiatric nurse. He is interviewed at home in the presence of his wife and
3-year-old child. He has turned the house upside down as he is convinced that there is a
microphone taping his family conversations. He has been hugging his child crying
inconsolably. He can hear some ‘young lads down the road’ talking about killing him and
his family. He feels that TV programmes are discussing him and his family. He has taped
newspapers on the windows and has set up trip wires at the front and back doors. He has
not slept for 3 days and has been talking to himself. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia
at the age of 20 and was under the care of the Early Intervention Team for 3 years. He
was treated with risperidone and seemed to have responded well. However, he stopped
taking his medication and had a relapse 2 years ago. He was assigned a community
psychiatric nurse as his care coordinator. Risperidone was re-commenced but he
continued to remain quite paranoid and suspicious. There was concern about the
possibility of him missing medication, and he was switched to risperidone long-acting
depot. This was continued for over 12 months but without a significant response.
Risperidone was replaced with olanzapine but this also did not produce a significant
response and was associated with weight gain of 3 stones. Olanzapine was discontinued
3 months ago and he was prescribed aripiprazole. His wife insists that he has been
compliant, but over the last 6 weeks his mental state has deteriorated.
Mental state examination
He appears very frightened and agitated. His eyes are darting and he is cowering on the
sofa clutching his daughter, who is calm but looks frightened. He seems to be responding
to unseen stimuli and occasionally mutters to himself. He says that voices describe what
he is doing in a commentary. His mood is labile and he breaks down repeatedly. His
speech is coherent and relevant. There is no formal thought disorder but he has delusions
of persecution and reference. He does acknowledge that he has mental illness, but feels
frustrated that his suspicions are not being taken seriously.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What is the next step in pharmacological management?

147

ANSWER 58
This man is currently experiencing delusions of persecution and reference and auditory
hallucinations. His symptoms have been present for nearly 2 years with significant
worsening in the past 6 weeks. These symptoms have failed to respond to adequate doses
of more than two different atypical antipsychotics, thus meeting the criteria for treatment
resistant schizophrenia (TRS). About 10–30% of patients do not respond to antipsychotics
and a further 30% have only a partial response. However, before TRS is diagnosed it is
important to review a few things. First, review the diagnosis. Consider co-morbid
disorders such as depression which may mimic treatment resistant negative symptoms
and medical disorders such as endocrine or neurological disorders. Second, check whether
there is co-morbid substance misuse that may contribute to treatment resistance. Third,
assess the dose, duration and compliance of drug treatment. Ensure that at least two
antipsychotics (at least one of which is an atypical) have been used at appropriate doses
for at least 6 weeks. Finally consider whether the correct psychosocial interventions are
in place bearing in mind that different treatments will be useful at different stages
of illness.
Clozapine can make significant improvements to a person’s symptoms and quality of life
in this situation. It is the only medication licensed for the treatment of TRS and is
recommended by NICE guidelines for this purpose. While it is a very effective treatment,
it is associated with some serious side effects:

• Neutropenia or potentially fatal agranulocytosis has been reported, so leucocyte and

•
•
•
•

complete blood counts need to be monitored weekly for 18 weeks and then every
2 weeks up to a year, after which, if the blood counts are stable, they can be done
4-weekly. Clozapine must be discontinued immediately if leucocyte count is
<3000/mm3 or neutrophil count is <1500/mm3. An urgent referral to a
haematologist is needed. Clozapine should never be re-prescribed in such cases.
Concomitant use of drugs that increase the risk of agranulocytosis such as
carbamazepine and azapropazone should be avoided.
Cardiomyopathy and fatal myocarditis (most commonly in the first two months)
have been reported. Detailed history, physical examination and ECG should be
accompanied by close monitoring for persistent tachycardia in the first two months.
Postural hypotension can lead to collapse and therefore clozapine should only be
initiated in closely supervised settings such as an in-patient unit, day hospital or
under the care of the home treatment team.
Clozapine can reduce the seizure threshold, so drugs lowering the seizure threshold
should be avoided.
Other side effects include sedation (slow dose titration), hypersalivation (treated with
hyoscine), constipation (advocate fibre diet), weight gain and diabetes (monitor
blood glucose, triglyceride levels, weight, BMI and ECG prior to commencement and
during treatment) and elevated liver enzymes (monitor LFTs).

Plasma clozapine level is not monitored routinely but is useful in optimizing treatment
and monitoring compliance. If TRS does not respond to clozapine, augmentation with
amisulpiride or aripiprazole is recommended. All this must occur alongside psychosocial
treatments such as concordance therapy, family therapy and cognitive behaviour therapy.
Also consider effects on the family, carers and this man’s daughter who has been witness
to a range of behaviours and beliefs that she would not have the perspective to
understand. Some educational, supportive and non-stigmatizing work would be essential
here. When in the recovery phase, relapse prevention strategies can be planned.
148

KEY POINTS

• Clozapine is indicated in the treatment of TRS.
• Clozapine treatment should be closely supervised.

CASE 59:

LOW MOOD AND TIRED ALL OF THE TIME

History
A 37-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner complaining of feeling ‘tired
all the time’. This has come on over the last 6 months and she believes it is related to
coping with three children aged 12, 7 and 5. She says that her self-esteem has been low
recently and this is made worse by having no work (she was a nurse before she had
children). It is also related to gradual weight gain. Her husband is supportive. She says
she has found it increasingly difficult to concentrate. She has been weepy recently but
has no thoughts of self-harm or harm to others. On systematic enquiry of her health, there
is nothing of note except a history of constipation, which she puts down to lethargy and
lack of exercise. She also has heavy periods. She is sleeping well, and sometimes feels
unrefreshed by sleep. She can enjoy herself, and says she enjoys her food, and indeed has
put on a few pounds recently.
Mental state examination
She is wearing a track suit and her clean hair is tied back behind her head. Her eye
contact is within normal limits. She looks tired and her skin is dry. She describes her
thoughts as slow and her mood as intermittently low. She is happy to chat and there is
no evidence of thought disorder, thought passivity, hallucinations or delusions.
Her pulse is 62/min and her blood pressure is 140/86 mmHg. Cardiovascular examination
is otherwise unremarkable. Her skin looks dry but no other examination is performed.

Questions
• What diagnoses do you consider?
• What further examination and investigations would you carry out?

151

ANSWER 59
Feeling ‘tired all the time’ is one of the commonest symptoms that a GP will see. For this
reason gathering evidence of other symptoms or signs becomes crucial in narrowing
down the differential diagnosis. This means enquiry into both physical and mental health
problems.
Early pregnancy, stress, poor sleep and poor nutritional intake are the commonest causes
of tiredness. It is important to rule out more serious psychological or psychiatric
problems. Depression and anxiety cause tiredness as do some somatization disorders. A
range of medications and recreational drugs can also cause tiredness and this should be
enquired about particularly if new medications have recently been introduced.
Infections can cause tiredness as can chronic fatigue syndrome. Ask about thirst, nocturia
or polyuria to exclude diabetes or renal failure. Cardiac problems (for example, failure,
valve disease) should also be excluded. Anaemia, liver failure, coeliac disease, cancer,
Parkinson’s, alcohol overuse and rare disorders such as myasthenia gravis and motor
neurone disease can also cause tiredness. Endocrine causes such as Addison’s,
hypopituitary, Cushing’s and hypothyroidism also need considering. This woman’s
symptoms should raise suspicion of hypothyroidism given the combination of fatigue,
low mood, constipation, lethargy, heavy periods, weight gain and dry skin.

!

Causes of hypothyroidism

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Hypothalamic failure (not producing enough TRH to stimulate the pituitary)
Pituitary gland damage (tumour radiation or surgery)
Autoimmune disease (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is a common cause)
Direct insult to the thyroid (radiation, surgery)
Iodine deficiency
Post-partum thyroiditis
Lithium treatment

Referral to a physician is appropriate in these circumstances for further investigation,
before you make any decisions about either treatment for depression or referral for
mental health care. Investigations would tend to depend on the full systematic enquiry
but would certainly include thyroid function tests, full blood count, blood sugar, urea and
electrolytes and liver function tests in the first instance. Treatment for hypothyroidism
would include thyroid replacement therapy and careful monitoring of progress including
mental state.
KEY POINTS

• There are many causes of tiredness and a careful history should be taken to lead you
towards the correct diagnosis and avoid unnecessary investigations.

• Hypothyroidism can mimic depression and vice versa.

152

CASE 60:

A PROFOUNDLY DEAF MAN ‘HEARING VOICES’

History
You are asked to see a 40-year-old man in the emergency department who is deaf. He is
with a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter who has been called in urgently by the
emergency staff. The man presented with a hearing female friend who told the
receptionist that she was worried about her friend, because he had been acting strangely
and had told her that he was ‘hearing voices’. The friend has to leave because she has to
pick her children up from school, but she is still present when you arrive and he is happy
for her to give some background information with him, which the interpreter signs. You
discover that he has been deaf from birth, but has no other medical problems. He is single
and works in a bakery on the early shift. He has a small group of friends with whom he
has meals and goes to the pub. His parents who are hearing live nearby and are also
supportive. He describes that for the last month he has been hearing voices. When you
clarify this it transpires that what he means is that he sees images of the voice signing
and lips moving, when there is no-one around. He believes that they are real, and is clear
that they are not his thoughts or in his mind. He does not hear any noises as such but he
knows it is a male and says negative things very clearly such as ‘bad man’, ‘devil’ and
‘kill yourself’. On further enquiry he reports that he has been low in mood for the last 6
weeks since a relationship with a woman he has been seeing for 9 months broke down.
He had hoped they would marry, but she is now pulling back from the relationship and
says that she wants to be his friend. He is concerned that he may never get married.
Mental state examination
He makes good eye contact and watches you intently. You notice that he is very
expressive with his face and that his face can be contorted at times as he communicates.
He is also very expressive with his hands and the movements he makes are sometimes
slow and sometimes very rapid. He seems on edge. He reports being ‘very sad’ and seems
objectively low in mood. He is tearful when discussing his ex-girlfriend. He appears to be
describing hallucinatory experiences, and you are clear that these are more than
thoughts. He has no delusions of persecution or paranoid ideas, although is worried about
his future. He has no thought passivity experiences (thought withdrawal, insertion or
broadcast) nor any delusions of control. He is orientated in time, place and person.
Questions
• What are the strange hallucinatory experiences that this man is describing?
• What treatments are likely to help this man?

153

ANSWER 60
Deaf people who can hear some sound, or deaf people born hearing, can experience sound
in their hallucinations. Profoundly deaf people can hallucinate but they will have images
of signs or lips moving, both of which are part of sign language. The language centres in
the brain (Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas) are both in fully working order in deaf people
who use signing (for example, BSL). These centres are ‘language’ centres not just speech
centres. It is therefore not surprising that ‘auditory’ hallucinations are experienced in the
person’s first language, in the case of a deaf person, BSL.
Strong facial expressions and expressive hand movements are normal in BSL and should
not be misinterpreted as signs of mental illness. Deaf awareness sessions for staff will help
in understanding this better. The deaf culture is traditionally very strong with many deaf
people using BSL as their preferred language and having a strong local community. This
may be particularly so for deaf people born to deaf parents. About 90% of deaf people
are born to hearing parents.
Although it is important to exclude schizophrenia or organic illness leading to psychotic
experiences, this man is likely to be suffering from psychotic depression and you should go
through a comprehensive history with him, including depression criteria (see Case 80) and carry
out an assessment of risk (Cases 32, 79 and elsewhere). Do this with a qualified interpreter.

Support for him should be culturally sensitive, and there are several adult mental health
services in the country specifically for deaf people. There are also four main (and six
subsidiary) centres for child and adolescent mental health. Particularly for deaf people
with complex or severe problems these centres should be utilized where possible. Where
generic services are accessed it is essential to have good communication and this means
arranging a qualified interpreter for any meetings. A good care plan would likely include
cognitive behaviour therapy delivered in BSL, good social support from family and
friends, continued employment if possible and a gradual ‘back to work’ plan if not,
possibly a deaf support group if available, and pharmacotherapy (serotonin reuptake
inhibitor and possibly atypical antipsychotic) if necessary.
KEY POINTS

• Be deaf aware and have an understanding of deaf culture and communication needs.
• Deaf people can experience language based hallucinations. For profoundly deaf people
this is in signs and lip patterns.

• Use a qualified interpreter if you are not fluent in BSL and are communicating with a
BSL user.

CASE 61:

I AM SURE I AM NOT WELL

History
A single 65-year-old woman presents for her sixth visit in as many weeks. She attends
with non-specific vague concerns. She seems anxious about her physical health and
requests repeated examinations and tests to be reassured that she is okay. She has a
history of mild anxiety but nothing else of note. On conversation you discover that she
has recently retired and a close friend of hers has died. She and the friend had intended
to travel on her retirement. She now wonders whether she is in a fit state to be travelling.
She has spent quite a lot of time researching illness in her age group and wants to know
how she should take care of herself so she has a happy and healthy retirement. She seems
particularly worried that she is likely to get cancer of the uterus as she has never had
children. She is also concerned that because her parents died of heart problems in their
70s, her own risk is high.
Physical examination
She is a healthy looking slim woman. There is no evidence of any mental illness and
physical examination is unremarkable.

Questions
• What is the likely problem?
• What advice would you give this woman?

155

ANSWER 61
This woman may be struggling to cope with the many changes her life has undergone.
She is at risk of developing a depressive illness. Hypochondriacal disorder should be
considered but her worries are more likely to represent an adjustment disorder in the
context of bereavement and retirement.

!

Hypochondriacal disorder
Hypochondriacal disorder is where a person has persistent preoccupations that they
may have physical illness or illnesses. They report ongoing physical symptoms (or a
preoccupation about their physical appearance) and may worry specifically about
specific organs.

It is often necessary to carry out examination and investigations as a mechanism for
reassurance, but regular and repeated tests may lead to heightening of anxiety as it can
reinforce ruminations about health.
To minimize the likelihood of developing problems she should be advised to:

• Schedule regular social activities so she does not become socially isolated.
• Ensure that she continues to take good care of herself by eating well and exercising
regularly.

• Consider some voluntary activities, as being mentally and physically engaged help
with both physical but especially mental health. It can also help to keep things
in perspective.
• Learn a new skill or do something she may not have had time to do before.
• Join social groups, which means that she has events to look forward to.
• Get advice from groups targeted at older people to help adjust to her new life stage.
KEY POINTS

• Regular attendance with non-specific concerns may be a presentation of depressive
illness or anxiety disorder.

• Constant reassurance and repeated tests may prove to be unhelpful strategies.

CASE 62:

REPEATING THE SAME STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN

History
A 76-year-old retired surveyor is brought to surgery by his wife. She reports that he has
gradually stopped reading and writing, both activities he used to enjoy. He has a tendency
to repeat things many times during the day, apparently unaware that he has mentioned
them earlier. He also has more difficulty putting sentences together, and forgets the
names of common objects such as the radiator and the radio. He has become slightly more
clumsy. He recently failed to recognize a cousin that he hadn’t seen for a year. He tells
the doctor that he is fine and that his wife is making a fuss about nothing. The previous
week he wanted to return a form to claim a chance to win a large prize from a mailshot
designed to encourage him to attend a promotional Spanish Apartment Share meeting.
He would previously have recognized this as a promotion and put it straight in the bin.
He drinks a small bottle of beer twice a week, usually at the weekends, and is a nonsmoker. He has not been lethargic or disinhibited and continues to get great pleasure from
gardening. His wife describes that onset has been gradual, so much so that she was
prompted to take action by their daughter.
Mental state examination
Mental state examination shows that he has good eye contact, and sits still in a chair
throughout the interview. His speech is slightly laboured and on several occasions he
seems to struggle to find the right word. None of his sentences are long or complex. He
has no pressure of speech or flight of ideas. Occasionally he will lose the thread of what
he is saying and stop talking or start on a different topic. He is uncertain why he is being
interviewed. There is no psychomotor retardation or agitation. There is no evidence of
hallucinations or psychosis, although his wife says that he sometimes wakes up in the
middle of the night thinking that there is an intruder in the bedroom. His Mini Mental
State Examination score is 19. He thinks he is in the GP surgery when in fact he is at the
local hospital.
Physical examination is unremarkable, including neurological examination, and he is
well-nourished. He has some mild eczma. He has good peripheral pulses, no carotid bruits
and a blood pressure of 115/70 mmHg.

Mini Mental State Examination
A 30-item questionnaire introduced by Folstein, Folstein and McHugh (1975)* that
tests for orientation in time and place, attention, registration, recall, arithmetic skills,
expressive and receptive language and motor skills. A score of less than 27 may
suggest some cognitive impairment. A score below 20 may be described as reflecting
moderate impairment and below 10 severe.

cognitive state of patients for the clinician. Journal of Psychiatric Research 12, 189–198.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What further questions would you need to ask?
• What advice can you give the couple about treatment?

157

ANSWER 62
Differential diagnosis
Alzheimer’s dementia is the most likely cause. There is no evidence of Parkinson’s disease
or Huntington’s disease on examination, and Creutzfeld–Jakob disease is unlikely given
the history. The absence of lethargy or disinhibition makes frontotemporal dementia
unlikely. It will be important to exclude depression by further history and discussion with
his wife. Dementia with Lewy bodies usually involves Parkinsonian features (although
these may not be evident early in the illness) and often involves visual hallucinations,
alongside attentional problems, fluctuating abilities and planning (executive functioning)
difficulties. Cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration also involves Parkinsonism and signs
of cortical atrophy including dyspraxia, dysphasia, cortical sensory loss and action
tremor. Progressive supranuclear palsy would usually involve regular falls, slow blinking,
dry eyes, tunnel vision, slurred speech, swallowing problems followed by further
movement problems including walking difficulties. Vascular dementia is typically
described as progressing with step-wise deterioration. It is more likely in the presence of
a history of hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease or smoking.

What further questions would you need to ask?
It is important to exclude depression, since this would lead to an alternative set of
treatments. Some of the symptoms presenting here are also typical of depression in the
elderly such as reduced ability to concentrate (for example, on reading), reduced energy,
apparent memory loss. Ask about inability to enjoy oneself (anhedonia), weepiness,
irritability, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, anxiety and effects on sleep or appetite.
Also ask about whether life is worth living. It is important to check sensitively for suicidal
thoughts and plans in depression. An assessment of dementia should also include enquiry
into functioning in all activities of daily living, and an assessment of risk in all domains
(including driving).

Advice about treatment
Cholinesterase inhibitors are not a cure but can slow down the progression of dementia,
reduce apathy and improve alertness and mood in Alzheimer’s disease. They can also
improve everyday task performance. Antipsychotics are sometimes used to treat severe
behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (such as aggression or agitation)
but their use is not without risk so should only be considered if the symptoms cannot be
managed in any other way. They are not appropriate here.
The assessment should inform the creation of a care package where the patient’s
circumstances indicate that one is required. Carer support is an essential component of
the management of dementia, so offer contact information for sources of support such as
the Alzheimer’s Society. As dementia progresses social services and mental health services
work together to shape a care plan with the family. Setting up Lasting Power of Attorney
arrangements early can avoid unnecessary financial and legal complications later on.
As the illness progresses environmental alterations such as use of clocks, calendars, lists
and physical support such as rails will help. A comprehensive multidisciplinary team will
include occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists and social workers as
well as community psychiatric nurses and psychiatrists. Advice to establish a routine with
activities, stimulation and conversation all give traction to life, and may maintain mood.
Therapy geared to improving reality orientation, with regular stimulation, has been
shown to help. As the illness progresses the patient’s care needs will change and,
158

although the goal should be to support the patient in their own environment as long as
this is safe and sensible, the time may come when a move into more supported
accommodation or 24-hour care becomes appropriate.
KEY POINTS

• Early detection of dementia allows support and interventions to be planned.
• It is important to rule out depression.
• Cholinesterase inhibitors are currently recommended by NICE for people with moderate
Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE score of 10–20).

CASE 63:

PROGRESSIVE STEP-WISE COGNITIVE DETERIORATION

History
A 66-year-old bank manager is brought to the emergency department by his wife and his
daughter, as he has had a flurry of ‘blank episodes’. He became unresponsive for a minute
or so and appeared confused for 2 to 3 minutes. He then reverted to his normal state with
little memory of what had happened. The final episode has left him with a drooping face,
which has now recovered. However, he seems to have word finding difficulty. He took
early retirement 18 months ago after he developed slurred speech and confusion in a
similar episode. Following that episode, he recovered quite well but found it difficult to
concentrate at work. He had a similar episode 6 months ago following which he began
losing his way while driving. He has avoided driving over the past few weeks. He has
become increasingly forgetful and suspicious of late. His moods are variable and he gets
‘worked up’ quite easily. He was helping a charity with their accounts but has been asked
to leave as he made several simple errors and reacted in anger when confronted with his
errors. He lives with his wife, who is very supportive. He has no previous psychiatric
history but has suffered from hypertension for 20 years and diabetes type 2 for 15 years
treated adequately with enalapril and metformin respectively. He has smoked 30
cigarettes a day for 50 years. He drinks socially and does not take any illicit drugs.
Physical examination
He appears as an overweight, well-dressed gentleman who walks with a slow shuffling
gait. His pulse rate is 86/min, regular, and blood pressure is 176/92 mmHg. Central
nervous system examination reveals bilateral increased tone though strength and reflexes
are equal all over. There is no other physical finding of note. Fundoscopic examination
is normal.
Mental state examination
His eye contact is good. He is pleasant, cooperative but a little perplexed. His speech is
slow and hesitant. There is evidence of psychomotor retardation and his mood is low and
anxious. There is no evidence of formal thought disorder but he does have some ideas of
reference and persecution. There is evidence of cognitive impairment – he scored 21/30
on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) losing points on attention, recall, naming and
construction. He seems to have a reasonable degree of insight and wants help to get
better.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How will you differentiate it from Alzheimer’s disease?

161

ANSWER 63
This man is presenting with an abrupt onset of word finding difficulty, which is occurring
in the context of transient neurological signs with no residual deficit. He has an increased
risk of cardiovascular disease with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and
smoking. He has experienced a transient ischaemic attack, which resolves completely in
less than 24 hours and often much quicker. He has had similar episodes each of which
has been followed by further cognitive deterioration. Impaired daily functioning and
evidence of cognitive impairments in multiple domains are suggestive of dementia.
Abrupt, step-wise cognitive impairment with a cardiovascular risk history is very
suggestive of multi-infarct or vascular dementia (VD), which is the second commonest
cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD has a chronic, insidious course with
an equal male:female ratio whereas males are more at risk of VD. Hachinski’s ischaemic
index (see below) may be useful in attempting to differentiate between the two conditions
though, in practice, 20–30% of cases may have both AD and VD. Making the right
diagnosis has treatment implications, as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are indicated for
the treatment of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms of AD but are not licensed for
the treatment of VD. Atypical antipsychotics are associated with increased relative risk of
stroke in patients with vascular dementia, so they should only be used after careful
consideration (and discussion with the patient and/or their carers) of the risks and
potential benefits.

CASE 64:

SEEING FLIES ON THE CEILING

History
You visit a 67-year-old man at home who is reported as being confused. His wife is
distressed because he repeatedly asks her to swat the flies from the ceiling, when she can
see nothing there. He has been in bed for 3 days with a ‘cold’. He frequently gets up and
wanders around without knowing where he is going. His wife says on one occasion he
burst out laughing without any reason that she could discern. At other times he seems
bewildered. She describes that he becomes more confused in the evening and at night,
and has urinated in the cupboard. He has no diarrhoea. A week ago he was well and able
to do gardening. He has not been confused until recently. On questioning his wife says
that while he occasionally forgets the names of village acquaintances, his memory has
otherwise been fine. He is not a large user of alcohol and only drinks a small bottle of
beer or a sherry once per week. His wife has remained well throughout.
Mental state examination
When you visit he is lying in bed. He is initially suspicious of you and asks if you are an
undertaker. He is preoccupied with stripes on the wallpaper and asks his wife several
times to get some towels to mop up the water running down the wall. He makes poor eye
contact. He is slightly restless in bed and looks dishevelled. There is a strong body odour.
He looks perplexed and frightened. He does not appear to be responding to voices, and
his wife says he hasn’t mentioned this. He is not able to answer questions about passivity
experiences. With respect to delusions his wife says that he thought that she was going
to stab him when she was trying to spoon feed him some soup the previous night. He
pushed her away but has not hit her. He is unable to say what day of the week it is or
what time of day. He names the previous prime minister as the current one, and cannot
repeat back an address that you give him to remember. He thinks he is in hospital. You
need to repeat questions as he seems preoccupied with his own thoughts or things that
he is seeing.
Physical examination
There are no abdominal signs and the cardiovascular system seems normal with good
peripheral pulses. His heart rate is 96/min and his blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg. His
temperature is normal. He has poor air entry and crackles over the right side of the
lower lung, and he has bronchial breathing and dulled percussion in the same area. He
has an increased respiratory rate.

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis and what are the possible causes?
• What is the management at this point?

163

ANSWER 64
He is disorientated in time and place and has clouding of consciousness. It is likely that
he has delirium. This can be caused by anything that disturbs the functioning of the
brain. This usually involves interference with the metabolism, perfusion or oxygenation
of the brain. More specifically it will be important to rule out malnutrition, dehydration,
drug intoxication or withdrawal states, poisoning, infections (urinary tract infection,
septicaemia, chest infection etc.), sleep deprivation and head injury. Sometimes it may
occur post surgery and could be related to a range of possible factors including
deoxygenation, brain injury, infection or unbalanced metabolism.
The history suggests little evidence of gradual dementia, although vascular dementia may
progress with step-wise deteriorations.
Treatment involves two main aspects. The first is to treat the underlying cause. This needs
careful assessment to make sure that nothing is missed. The second is to treat the distress
or discomfort symptomatically. Sedatives or major tranquillizers for the latter are only
used when absolutely necessary and when the underlying cause has been identified.
Doses should be reviewed every 24 hours. Haloperidol (or lorazepam for patients with
Lewy body dementia or Parkinson’s disease) are commonly used. Some use risperidone as
an alternative.
The lung signs in this situation suggest pneumonia and the absence of a fever does not
exclude this as a cause. The mainstay of treatment is directed at the cause. Consider
treating the infection with antibiotics, ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition,
identifying metabolic disturbance and providing corrective treatments, ensuring adequate
oxygenation, and identifying any poisoning or withdrawal states and providing
necessary treatments.
Poisoning seems unlikely since his wife is well, but doctors should remain vigilant to
causes such as carbon monoxide poisoning in these situations. He has not had diarrhoea
but may have a urinary tract infection. He has had a cold so an undiagnosed pneumonia
is possible. Drug or alcohol states seem unlikely given the history as does head injury
although he may have knocked his head without his wife knowing.
Rather than organizing tests and waiting for the results a hospital admission is
appropriate to investigate and provide necessary treatment.
KEY POINTS

• Delirium affects attention, consciousness, perception, thinking, memory and emotions.
• There are usually behavioural effects and an impact on the sleep–wake cycle.

CASE 65:

COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT WITH VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS

History
A 78-year-old man attends the general practitioner surgery with his daughter for an
urgent appointment as his eyes are rolling upwards uncontrollably since this morning. He
lives on his own following the death of his wife last year and has been very low since
then. His daughter is very concerned about him. His self-care has suffered and he often
burns his food though at other times ‘he seems completely fine’. Three months ago, he
suffered a fall and bruised his face. His daughter has noticed other bruises on his body.
He has developed a tremor and seems to stumble a lot. His sleep and appetite have been
poor and he has lost about 2 kg in weight over the past year. Two days ago, he went to
the GP surgery complaining of seeing a whole orchestra playing in his kitchen and was
prescribed haloperidol 0.5 mg twice daily. However, since yesterday, he has been suffering
uncontrollable twisting movement of his neck and face. Last night, he could not keep his
balance and suffered a fall in his lounge.
Mental state examination
He is pleasant but seems a little confused and bewildered. He does not have any formal
thought disorder. He describes in great detail the musicians in the orchestra that he can
see in his kitchen. He acknowledges that they are not real and says he finds them
disconcerting but not particularly unpleasant. His mood is low and he gets tearful during
the interview. Abbreviated Mental Test is abnormal with a score of 5 out of 10. He has
reasonable insight into his symptoms and wants treatment to get better. Physical
examination reveals a resting tremor in his hands with cogwheel rigidity in his forearms.
The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What is the pharmacological management?

165

ANSWER 65
This man is presenting with cognitive impairment, neuroleptic medication induced
dystonia (upward rolling of eyes), extrapyramidal rigidity and tremor, vivid
hallucinations, repeated falls and fluctuating consciousness. This combination of
symptoms is strongly suggestive of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). DLB is one of the
commonest causes of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Misdiagnosis is common
because of its unusual presentation: often with psychiatric symptoms such as visual
hallucinations and depression rather than memory impairment. Falls are an early feature
as are parkinsonian symptoms.

!

Differential diagnosis

• Alzheimer’s dementia: Insidious and chronic progressive cognitive impairment
•
•

•
•

without fluctuations. Hallucinations are usually not prominent and parkinsonian
symptoms are seen late in the illness.
Vascular dementia: Step-wise deterioration with history of cardiovascular risk
factors is seen.
Other causes of dementia: such as fronto-temporal dementia (behavioural
disinhibition); prion diseases (rapidly progressive, characteristic periodic
complexes on EEG) and progressive supranuclear palsy (insidious onset with
vertical gaze palsy).
Psychotic disorder: such as schizophrenia may mimic DLB due to visual
hallucinations and delusions but falls, cognitive impairment and neuroleptic
sensitivity are usually absent.
Depression: may often be a presenting symptom of DLB. Low mood, sleep and
appetite disturbance, cognitive changes may all point to depression but the
characteristic features of DLB such as falls, extrapyramidal rigidity and neuroleptic
sensitivity are absent.

MRI scan is essential to rule out vascular dementia and other brain pathology. Single
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan with a specific ligand can confirm
the loss of dopaminergic neurons in DLB while there are no such changes seen in AD.
There is no specific cure. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be helpful for treatment of
non-cognitive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and challenging behaviour. If
acetylcholinersterase inhibitors are ineffective, typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol
should be avoided. Instead atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine or aripiprazole may
be helpful but vigilance for extra-pyramidal side effects is still essential. Depression,
when present, should be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as
citalopram or fluoxetine. A care package with carer support and a full range of
psychosocial interventions should be put into place.
KEY POINTS

• Fluctuating consciousness, visual hallucinations, history of falls and parkinsonian
symptoms suggest a diagnosis of DLB.

• Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are first line and atypical antipsychotics second line
treatment for distressing non-cognitive symptoms.

CASE 66:

PARANOIA

–

MY WIFE IS POISONING MY FOOD

History
A 79-year-old man presents with his family. They are concerned that his behaviour has
become more unpredictable. He has also started to become more and more suspicious of
all his family members, particularly his wife. He thinks she is poisoning him and will now
no longer eat anything she has cooked. He does not even trust her to make him a drink.
He has become more hostile and aggressive, which is a big change as he has always been
a quietly spoken and gentle man. His sleep is disturbed and his appetite has increased
with some weight gain. He has no past psychiatric history.
He has a complex medical history and his family report that he has most recently been
treated for pulmonary fibrosis which had been relatively stable. However, following a
bout of pneumonia his breathing was compromised so a new regime of medication was
started. He is on 5 mg prednisolone three times daily and has been taking this for 6 weeks.
The family report he had a course of steroids previously but did not have any side effects
from it so they do not think it is causing problems.

Mental state examination
The patient is overweight and slightly breathless. He is clearly suspicious of his family
watching and listening carefully. He does not hear well and you often have to repeat your
questions. When you turn away to answer a question from his son, he immediately
assumes that you and the family are plotting against him. His speech is fast but clear. His
mood is difficult to assess as at times he seems fine but then will become quickly irritated.
He admits he has had some auditory hallucinations which are somewhat unclear. The
voices tell him to be careful of his wife as she is trying to kill him. He is convinced his
children have started visiting more because they are in cahoots with his wife. He is also
convinced that he could look after himself without any help from his family. He has not
had any self-harm ideation or plans.
He is orientated in time, place and person. His short-term memory is poor and he is easily
frustrated when he becomes aware that he has got something wrong. He is not really
aware of recent world or national events despite saying he reads the paper daily. He also
admits that because he was more breathless he had increased his doses of prednisolone.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How would you manage the psychosis?
• How would you explain the psychosis to the family?

167

ANSWER 66
The most likely diagnosis is side effects of his prednisolone medication. However
differential diagnosis would need to exclude organic psychosis, dementia, depression and
bipolar disorder.
The most immediate plan of action would be to reduce the steroids as it is most likely that
they have caused this problem. Steroids cause a number of side effects including changes
in mental health. Mild mental changes are occasionally observed after a few days of
treatment and may include excitation, euphoria, hypomania and insomnia. Patients
initially on high steroid doses may become manic, excitable and incur personality
changes. They may appear extremely cheerful, talkative, have boundless energy, make
impulsive decisions and feel the need for significantly less rest or sleep. This can cause
strain on relationships with carers and loved ones. However paranoid psychosis is also
not uncommon.
It may also be useful to get his hearing tested as hearing impairment may make his
paranoid thoughts and feelings worse.
The family need to have the mental health side effects of steroids explained to them. They
also need to be told how to watch for early changes so that they can pre-empt problems
in the future. Given his medical condition it may not be possible to completely stop the
steroids, but a mechanism should be put into place with the family for ensuring he takes
the correct dosage and that his response to it is monitored.

!

Paranoia
Paranoia can occur in many contexts. It may be part of a personality disorder with a
long-standing mistrust about other people. If it is delusional in intensity it may be
part of a psychotic disorder such as persistent delusional disorder, schizophrenia or
as part of a manic-depressive or depressive psychosis. It could also be part of a
transient or drug-induced psychotic disorder.

KEY POINTS

• In the elderly, even small doses of steroids can cause significant mental health
side effects.

• The elderly are often on several different medications so care needs to be taken as
interactions are highly likely.

ACUTE AGITATION IN A MEDICAL IN-PATIENT

History
A 72-year-old man is admitted to try to achieve better control of his diabetes which has
to date been controlled using diet. There is no other medical history of note. He had a
short depressive illness in his forties following the death of his mother. He had settled
well onto the ward but after his wife left he became increasingly agitated and restless.
Mental state examination
The man is cooperative and communicative but clearly distressed and easily distracted.
He is somewhat shaky. His speech is normal and he describes himself as worried but
cannot say what is worrying him. There is no evidence of any psychosis.
He is orientated in time, place and person. He is able to repeat back the names of three
objects that you identify for him. He is able to spell WORLD backwards though requires
two attempts. He is also able to do serial 7s but falters after four subtractions. He is able
to recall the three objects identified earlier in the examination. There is nothing to suggest
that he does not understand what is said to him.

Physical examination
The man is rather obese. His pupils are dilated and he is sweating but is apyrexial. His
blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg.

Questions
• What is the likely cause of this man’s agitation?
• How should he be managed?
• What are the psychiatric causes of agitation?
• What medications are effective in managing agitation?

169

ANSWER 67
The first task is to identify what his agitation is related to. If he is agitated because of an
underlying medical issue, that needs to be addressed first. Medical causes include hyperor hypoglycaemia (as here), electrolyte disturbance, renal or hepatic failure, thyroid or
adrenal disorders, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, hypotension, heart failure, neurological
disorders (e.g. stroke), infection of all kinds (especially in the elderly) including
meningitis, and dementia. Agitation can also be caused by hunger, constipation, pain
and sleep deprivation. It will also be necessary to look carefully at his medication as
steroids, anticholinergics, barbiturates, amphetamines and antipsychotics may all
cause agitation.
If no medical cause is found, then you need to explore psychiatric causes. Underlying
psychiatric disorders such as anxiety or psychosis with delusional thinking need to be
treated with the relevant medication. Depression is commonly missed in the elderly. It is
also important to be aware of substance (especially alcohol) problems in the elderly as the
pattern may be more of a regular controlled drinker than someone who binges. Abuse of
or dependence on medically prescribed medication which may be stopped at the time of
admission may also cause agitation. Recent stressful life events may also lead to agitation.
Agitation may be managed by careful nursing but it is most likely that medication will
be required. If safe to do so, oral medication should be considered first. This may help the
patient restore some feeling of control and ease escalating agitation.
The goals of medication in the management of acute agitation are to quickly calm the
patient without excessive sedation and to ensure patient safety (and sometimes staff safety
if the patient is violent with their agitation). However, there is also a need to nurse the
patient appropriately so minimal medication is used. Lorazepam is preferred for
undifferentiated agitation (provides muscle relaxation, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant effects,
and generalized sedation). Haloperidol has a relatively low propensity for sedation and
hypotension compared with other intramuscular (IM) agents; however it is more likely to
cause extrapyramidal side effects. The combination of a benzodiazepine and a typical
antipsychotic (i.e. haloperidol) has been shown to be superior to monotherapy with either
agent, and may allow for decreased doses of the antipsychotic medication. The combination
can cause excessive sedation. After treatment with IM agents, monitor vitals and clinical
status at regular intervals. Allow adequate time for clinical response between doses.
If the initial treatment fails to produce an adequate response after 2–4 hours options
include the following. Give another dose of the same medication if partially effective, or
a different medication if first medication ineffective. Give a dose of lorazepam if first
medication was an antipsychotic. Give a combination of the same antipsychotic and
lorazepam (except olanzapine which needs to be given after an hour’s interval). Lower
starting and maximum doses need to be observed in the elderly.
KEY POINTS

• Agitation is extremely common in elderly patients.
• Medication is very useful but needs to be used in conjunction with sensitive nursing.
• Lorazepam and/or haloperidol are probably most effective.

CASE 68:

WOMAN IS NOT EATING OR DRINKING ANYTHING

History
A 73-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of low mood. She had been
previously relatively well and there were no major life events prior to her low mood. She
had complained of being unable to sleep, unable to motivate herself to get out and about,
and felt there was little hope things would ever be different. She had lost about 15 kg in
weight in that period, with the last 10 kg having been lost in the last few weeks. She had
been tried on fluoxetine but it had little effect. Over the last month she has developed
features of psychosis with derogatory auditory hallucinations and delusions of
worthlessness. She feels she should be left alone to die as she is not worth saving and
other people are more deserving of the resources. She has denied any self-harm ideation
but admits that she can see little point in being alive. Her food intake has gradually
diminished and over the last few days she has barely eaten or drunk anything. When
she was admitted she was very withdrawn and mute. No one was able to communicate
with her.
Mental state examination
The woman does not respond to any questions. She does not make any eye contact. She
is mute and her speech cannot be assessed. She will occasionally grunt if efforts are made
to move her. She does not seem orientated in place, time or person.
Physical examination
The woman has clearly neglected self-care. She looks emaciated. Her eyes are partially
closed and she does not respond to any requests. She shows marked bradykinesia (slow
movement) and there is hardly any spontaneous movement. She is clinically very
dehydrated.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What would be the most appropriate intervention?
• How would you prepare a patient for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)?

171

ANSWER 68
The most likely diagnosis is depression with psychosis but you should exclude
schizophrenia and any medical disorder. Because of her catatonic state electro-convulsive
therapy (ECT) is likely to be an appropriate intervention after she is rehydrated and made
medically safe. ECT is primarily used to treat major depressive symptoms where other
treatments have been unsuccessful or where life is at risk (because of either extreme selfneglect or very high risk of suicide) when a rapid response is required. ECT involves
passing a controlled dose of electricity through the brain between two electrodes applied
to the head to induce an epileptiform seizure. The goal of treatment is to produce a
seizure lasting 20 to 50 seconds. The treatment is given under a short-acting general
anaesthetic, using a muscle relaxant to modify the seizure. As a general anaesthetic is
required to be able to administer ECT the treatment can only be given in places where
this is safely possible. Treatments are usually given twice a week, and a typical course of
ECT consists of about six to ten treatments. Consent is usually obtained for a series of
treatments but consent can of course be withdrawn at any point.
It is important that the patient’s consent is sought prior to the treatment. There are a
number of contexts in which ECT may be given. The patient might have capacity to
consent to ECT and agree to treatment. The patient might lack capacity to consent but
not object to treatment, in which case treatment can be given under the provisions of
Section 5 of the Mental Capacity Act. The patient might lack capacity to consent and
actively refuse treatment, in which case they may be detained under the Mental Health
Act and be treated, after a second opinion has been obtained, under the provisions of
Section 58 of that Act. A patient detained under the Mental Health Act may require ECT
as an emergency in which case treatment may be given under the provisions of Section
62 before a second opinion has been obtained. Emergency treatment is permitted to save
the patient’s life, prevent serious deterioration, alleviate serious suffering or prevent
danger to the patient or others arising from the patient’s behaviour. Prior to ECT patients
will need a thorough physical examination and appropriate investigations as fitness for
anaesthetic will need to be assessed.

!

Side effects of ECT
The following side effects need to be explained to the patient and/or their carers:

1
2
3
4

Transient headache, muscle soreness, nausea or agitation.
Transient memory impairment for the period immediately before and after ECT.
Transient confusion immediately after treatment, especially in the elderly.
Possibility of permanent memory dysfunction or loss (although there is
controversy about whether this is a result of the ECT or other factors including
the depression itself).
5 The risks associated with general anaesthesia.

As for any other procedure where an anaesthetic is required the patient must not have
eaten or drunk anything for at least 8 hours before the treatment. Patients having outpatient ECT should not drive or operate machinery on the day of treatment and patients
will normally be observed for at least 4 hours post-ECT, as is usual for any day procedure.
Immediate post-anaesthetic care should be provided in an appropriately equipped
recovery area by appropriately trained staff.
172

KEY POINTS

• ECT is not usually a first line treatment but remains a vital option for some patients,
•

particularly where the life of the individual concerned is threatened and/or other
treatments are ineffective.
All the usual precautions must be taken as for any procedure involving anaesthesia.

CASE 69:

A RESTLESS POSTOPERATIVE PATIENT WHO WON’T
STAY IN BED
History
The nurses in the intensive care unit contact you regarding a 70-year-old postoperative
male who had a hip replacement 24 hours previously. The man is extremely agitated and
keeps wanting to pull out his intravenous line and get out of bed. He is quite fragile and
there is real concern that he may get physically hurt if he is not restrained. He is
demanding to be allowed to leave and go home. The nurses want to know whose
responsibility it is to ‘section’ him to ensure that he can be treated.
Mental state examination
The man is uncooperative and does not answer questions. He just repeats his demands to
be allowed to leave. His speech is loud and repetitive. There is no evidence of psychosis.
The man cannot tell you the year, season, date, day or month. He can tell you he is in
hospital but cannot understand why. He cannot register any information and immediately
forgets why he cannot go home even when this is explained to him.
Physical examination
The man is clearly agitated and hostile when he is spoken to. He is connected to an IV
drip and looks well-hydrated. He is apyrexial. There is a bandage on his right leg with a
drain. There does not seem to be any excessive bleeding. The man denies begin in
any pain.

• Under what legal frameworks can he be kept in hospital and treated against his wishes?

175

ANSWER 69
Some degree of postoperative delirium occurs in around 25% of elderly patients within a
week of surgery. It is a transient mental dysfunction that can result in increased
morbidity, delayed functional recovery and prolonged hospital stay. The distinguishing
features are impaired cognition, fluctuating levels of consciousness and altered
psychomotor activity. It is usually seen within a couple of days post-operation and is
often worse at night. It may go unnoticed or be misdiagnosed. Patients are usually
incoherent, disorientated and have impairment of memory and attention. It ranges from
mild confusion to full hallucinations. As in this scenario, patients with delirium may
remove vital drains or temporary pacemaker wires, or they may fall and injure themselves
when getting out of bed, and so need careful monitoring.
The Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) is useful to monitor fluctuating cognitive
functioning.
Preoperative risk factors include previous history of delirium, pre-existing dementia, age
over 70 years, depression, polypharmacy and drug interaction, alcohol or sedativehypnotic withdrawal, endocrine and metabolic problems. Peri-operative hypoxia,
hypocarbia and sepsis are also risk factors as are certain anaesthetics, pethidine, and
anticholinergics. The risk of postoperative delirium is similar with general and regional
anaesthetic techniques. Regional anaesthesia may involve the use of drugs that increase
the risk. Pre-existing sensory or perceptual deficits, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, sleep
deprivation (for example, from a busy ward) and an inability to keep track of time can
all contribute to confusion and disorientation.

!

Nursing patients with delirium

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Give regular reassurance and reorientation.
Use clear communication.
Minimize noise and have adequate lighting (but not too bright).
Use relaxation strategies such as music etc. Avoid unnecessary waking.
Encourage familiar family or friends to stay.
Keep consistent carers and avoid regular moves.
Avoid restraint and use strategies to maintain oxygenation and mobility.
Avoid invasive interventions if possible.
Use medication only as last resort.

The underlying organic cause of the delirium should be found and treated. If medication
is necessary, antipsychotics (for example, haloperidol or the newer, atypical
antipsychotics) are generally preferable to benzodiazepines. For acute control of delirium,
oral haloperidol at a dose of 0.5 mg with a minimum interval of two hours is the preferred
treatment. For more agitated patients, IM haloperidol can be used. The maximum total
dose in 24 hours should not usually exceed 5 mg. For patients with Parkinson’s disease
or Lewy body dementia an appropriate alternative is lorazepam 0.5–1 mg orally up to a
maximum dose of 3 mg in 24 hours with a minimum interval of 2 hours between doses.
After recovery from an acute episode, a psychiatric or psychosocial assessment may aid
early functional rehabilitation.
Section 5 of the Mental Capacity Act is the legal framework under which treatment can
be given to a patient who lacks capacity to consent to that treatment. The treatment must
176

be necessary and in that person’s best interests. In this case the patient’s inability to retain
the information necessary to make an informed decision about his care demonstrates lack
of capacity. This should be carefully documented. This capacity assessment can be carried
out by the treating surgeons. Restraint of a patient who lacks capacity is only allowed to
prevent harm and provided that the restraint is proportionate to both the likelihood and
the seriousness of that harm. Keeping this patient in hospital against his will to treat
delirium will prevent him from suffering serious harm.
The Mental Health Act can only be used to assess or treat mental disorder. Although
delirium can be construed as a mental disorder, and treatment of the underlying physical
cause of the delirium can be considered treatment for the mental disorder of delirium, the
Mental Capacity Act provides a much clearer framework for the delivery of care against
a patient’s wishes under these circumstances.
KEY POINTS

• Postoperative delirium is common in the elderly.
• Nursing care is key.

CASE 70:

PARKINSON’S DISEASE

History
A 71-year-old ex-cleaner is brought to the follow-up neurology clinic by her daughter
and a carer from the residential home where she resides. She has been diagnosed with
Parkinson’s disease for 7 years and has managed reasonably well with a combination of
caribidopa 25 mg and levodopa 100 mg two tablets three times daily. Her cognition has
been worsening gradually from a Mini Mental State Examination score of 24/30 two
years ago to 20/30 on her current visit. She reports no change in herself but her daughter
says that over the past 6 months her mother has been exhibiting periods of ‘weird
behaviour’ – screaming and shouting for hours followed by periods of tearfulness and
uncontrollable sobbing. When agitated, she has been disinhibited, taking her clothes off
and swearing in a manner very uncharacteristic of her. She sings loudly and cheerfully
making everyone laugh with ‘lewd jokes’. When tearful, she has appeared profoundly
slowed down and has spoken of wanting to stay in bed, not being able to face the day
ahead. Her sleep has been disturbed and so too her appetite. At times, she has refused to
go down to the dining room. Her mobility has worsened. Her shuffling gait and tremors
have worsened and so too her bradykinesia. According to her carer, her personality has
changed a lot over the past year or so. She has become more reserved and does not enjoy
bingo or shopping trips. She does look forward to her daughter’s visit, but of late has not
been as enthusiastic as she used to be. Her daughter visits her three times a week and is
very close to her. Her husband died 10 years ago. She has settled well at the residential
home and is quite popular with staff and other residents. She has no history of any other
physical or psychiatric illness.
Mental state examination
She appears well-dressed though there is some evidence of self-neglect. Her hair looks
messy and her nails are dirty. She walks in with a stooped posture and takes slow
shuffling steps. She has a prominent resting tremor when she sits down. Her head nods
and her hands rhythmically move. She is cooperative, pleasant and establishes a good
rapport. She reports her mood to be normal but on direct questioning she becomes tearful,
saying she can’t help crying. Her affect is blunted. Her speech is soft and slow. There is
no formal thought disorder. Cognitive examination reveals impairments in attention
span, registration, recall, writing, construction and 3-stage command. She has some
insight into her condition, acknowledging her mobility problems and the need for
treatment. However, she denies being disinhibited saying ‘she was just being happy’.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What psychiatric complications of her treatment will you warn her about?

179

ANSWER 70
This woman has a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD), which is being treated with
levodopa. She is now presenting with lability of mood associated with further
deterioration of her cognitive abilities and her movement disorder. Differential diagnoses
that need to be considered include the following:

• Dementia – risk of dementia may be increased up to three-fold in patients with PD.
The majority of PD patients may have mild dementia characterized by memory
problems and slow thinking, as may be likely in this case and up to 20% may
progress to severe dementia. The presence of cognitive changes must lead to referral
to a psychiatrist or a neurologist to consider the possible diagnosis of dementia and
its possible aetiology, including vascular dementia, Huntington’s disease,
Hallervorden–Spatz disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and other rare conditions
which may present with cognitive deterioration and movement disorder.
• Depression – is seen more commonly in PD (nearly 50%) than in other similar
disabling conditions and is unrelated to duration of illness or to level of disability.
PD may often present with symptoms of depression or anxiety. Females are more
likely to be affected. Emotional insecurity, pessimism, lack of confidence in
socializing or going out, poor motivation and increased concern about health are
more common presenting symptoms.
• Mania – manic or other psychotic episodes are extremely rare in PD though
psychotic depression may be seen in a small proportion of cases.
• Iatrogenic – psychosis, affective disorders, delirium and impulsive behaviours can
occur as iatrogenic conditions secondary to overmedication with levodopa or
anticholinergic medications. Impulsive behaviours can include hypersexuality,
dopamine dysregulation syndrome with addiction to dopaminergic medications, as
well as compulsive, addictive, repetitive or reward seeking behaviours. Fourteen per
cent of patients on dopamine agonists engage in pathological or harmful gambling.
Up to 3% of PD patients seen in specialist clinics exhibit hypersexuality or dopamine
dysregulation. Psychiatric side effects are seen in 10% of cases increasing up to 60%
in those on treatment over 6 years. Psychotic episodes, with delusions and
hallucinations, may be precipitated in those with past history of psychosis or may
occur as a new episode later in treatment. Visual hallucinations are more common
(unlike schizophrenia where auditory hallucinations predominate) and insight is often
preserved. They usually respond to reduction of antiparkinsonian treatment. Where
this is not possible, treatment with atypical antipsychotics is appropriate, but with
careful vigilance for worsening of motor symptoms. Mood disorders including mania,
severe depression and anxiety can occur as treatment complications. Acute
confusional states with disorientation and hallucinations may also be seen.
In this case, there are periods of low mood and tearfulness alternating with periods of
hyperactivity, agitation and elated mood. This is most likely associated with on–off
periods related to medication.
KEY POINTS

• Psychiatric complications such as depression, mania, psychosis and cognitive disorders
•
180

such as dementia or delirium are often associated with PD and/or secondary to
medications used to treat PD.
These complications increase with chronicity of illness and treatment and a high index
of suspicion is needed to identify and effectively treat them.

CASE 71: SHE IS REFUSING TREATMENT.
WRONG. SHE MUST BE MENTALLY ILL

HER DECISION IS

History
A surgical colleague rings you up. He has a 75-year-old woman who needs an operation
to remove a breast lump. The lump is malignant but is isolated and there is no evidence
of any local or distant spread. Your colleague explains he has told the woman that the
operation is fairly straightforward and that after the operation she would be treated with
radiotherapy. He states that she is saying she has no wish to have the operation. He is
struggling to understand her decision because not having the operation reduces her
chances of survival. He wants you to come and assess her because he feels she must have
a mental illness which is rendering her incapable of making the right decision.
Questions
• Who should assess capacity?
• What conditions must be fulfilled for a person to have capacity to make a particular
decision?
• What should happen here?

181

ANSWER 71
The Mental Capacity Act states that a person must be assumed to have capacity unless it
is established that they lack capacity. A person suffering from a mental illness does not
automatically lack capacity to make any decisions. Capacity has to be ascertained on an
individual basis and for each situation where a decision is required.
Assessment for capacity to make decisions regarding treatment must be made by the treating
doctor. All healthcare professionals should be able to undertake capacity assessments.

!

Mental Capacity Act considerations

• An individual lacks capacity to make a decision if, because of an impairment of, or

•
•
•

a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain they are:
• unable to understand the information relevant to the decision
• unable to retain the necessary information for long enough to make a decision
• unable to use and weigh the information in order to arrive at a decision or
unable to communicate their decision.
Plain language should be used and enough information provided to enable a
decision to be made. The quantity and quality of information should be
proportionate to the complexity of the decision.
The information needs to be retained by the person for long enough to give it
proper consideration and weigh up the potential consequences.
The patient should have the freedom to make the decision they want and not be
unduly pressured to come to a particular decision by others, for example, family
members or professionals.

Capacity should be reviewed on a regular basis. Temporary impairment may improve. A
person with a progressive illness such as dementia may lose capacity to make a decisions.
Some patients will have previously recorded a decision about what they would decide if
particular circumstances arise. Similarly, if the patient has given someone lasting power of
attorney (previously enduring power of attorney) to make personal welfare decisions, the
attorney may, subject to certain conditions, give or refuse consent to treatment on behalf
of the patient. Doctors must, where practicable and appropriate, seek the views of family or
carers, anyone who holds a lasting power of attorney to make personal welfare decisions or
a deputy appointed by the Court of Protection to make decisions on behalf of the person.
The Mental Capacity Act is clear that anyone who has the care of a person who lacks
capacity, and wilfully neglects or ill-treats that person, is guilty of an offence.
In this scenario the patient cannot be treated against her wishes unless it can be
demonstrated that she lacks capacity to decide whether or not to have the treatment, and
that the treatment is both necessary and in her best interests. She cannot be said to lack
capacity just because her decision seems unwise to others or she does not agree with
advice. However, if she fully understands the information given to her and can retain and
use that information to make a balanced decision she has capacity and her refusal of
treatment must be respected.
KEY POINTS

• Capacity can and should be assessed by any treating doctor.
• Capacity should be reviewed periodically.
• A patient who lacks capacity can be given treatment which is necessary and in their
best interests even if they refuse to consent.
182

CASE 72:

DEPRESSION IN A CARER

History
You are asked to see a 69-year-old woman who complains of feeling constantly tired and
not enjoying anything including her grandchildren. She sleeps for eight hours or more
but still never feels rested. She finds herself getting increasingly irritable and snappy with
her 37-year-old daughter who is now living with her following the breakdown of her
marriage. The daughter has two children aged 10 and 12 for whom the patient is having
to provide care because her daughter is unable to manage this. The patient is finding the
demands of her daughter, grandchildren and husband more and more difficult to cope
with. She often forgets what needs to be done. Further questioning reveals that her
daughter has agoraphobia and depression.
She has no previous history of mental health problems. She has hypertension which is
well-controlled.

Mental state examination
The woman looks tired and much older than her 69 years. She is obese and her dress is
rather erratic. She has lots of layers of clothing and seems unaware that she has come in
her slippers. She looks tired. Her speech is slow, flat and monosyllabic. She states she feels
okay but she looks and sounds low. She does not have any active suicidal ideation but
does question whether life is worth living. She feels hopeless about the circumstances she
finds herself in. She has no hallucinations or formal thought disorder.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What investigations would be useful to do?
• How would you manage this situation?

183

ANSWER 72
The most likely diagnosis is depression secondary to her current life situation. However,
there is a need to exclude an organic condition such as hypothyroidism, undiagnosed
diabetes or alcohol misuse. Dementia will also need to be excluded given her memory loss.
INVESTIGATIONS
A full blood count would check for anaemia. If she is looking after everyone else
her own care might be poor and she may well be anaemic (vitamin B12 deficiency
may also need excluding). Thyroid function tests would exclude hypothyroidism,
which can mimic depression. Liver function tests, blood sugar and urea and
electrolytes would exclude systemic illnesses that may affect mood and coping.
These are numerous and include, for example, neoplasia, diabetes, renal and
liver problems.

If this woman’s diagnosis is depression, she would benefit from antidepressant treatment
and perhaps cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). Given her current situation she might
find it difficult to commit to CBT. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as
citalopram or fluoxetine would be a reasonable choice. Use of medication needs to be
carefully monitored as the elderly are more sensitive to drug side effects. Ensuring that
her daughter is receiving treatment in her own right may also help. Practical support from
social services, family or the community is also likely to be helpful. Careful consideration
must be given to the welfare of her grandchildren for whom she has responsibility, as her
illness may impact on her ability to care for them.
Depression in older adults may present differently than in younger people. For example,
low energy levels and reduced motivation may be presenting features rather than
reported sadness. Worry about money, health or family members is not uncommon.
Physical complaints may also be the presenting feature including headaches or other
aches and pains. They may see it as related to getting older and are less likely to go to
their doctor.

CASE 73:

MY WIFE IS AN IMPOSTOR

History
A 68-year-old retired aircraft engineer presents to his general practitioner asking for help
in removing an impostor from his home. He goes on to tell the GP that his wife was
replaced by someone else two weeks ago but that this impostor is very clever and has
managed to take on his wife’s appearance, voice and mannerisms. He refuses to be in the
same room as the impostor and frequently shouts at her to leave and return his real wife.
He has also called the police to ask them to eject her from his home. His wife is distraught
by this behaviour and despite her pleas and the intervention of other family members the
patient refuses to believe that she is really his wife.
A year ago he had a coronary artery bypass graft and has done well since this operation.
He continues to have hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is
an ex-smoker, who stopped smoking a year ago, having previously smoked 40 cigarettes
per day for nearly 50 years. He has no other past medical history of note and no previous
psychiatric history. There is no history of alcohol or substance abuse.
He and his wife have been married for forty years and have three grown-up children.
There is no family history of psychiatric illness.

Mental state examination
He presents as a well-kempt elderly man who looks older than his chronological age. He
makes normal eye contact. His speech is slow and repetitive and on occasions there are
long pauses during which it appears he is struggling to find the appropriate word. His
mood is normal and there is no evidence of depression. He is adamant that his wife has
been replaced by an impostor but is unable to explain why or how this occurred. There
is no formal thought disorder or hallucinations. On cognitive testing he scores 24 out of
30 on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) with particular deficits in the areas of
registration and language.
There is no abnormality on physical examination.

Questions
• What psychopathological syndrome is being described?
• Why is detailed cognitive examination important in this case?

185

ANSWER 73
This is a description of Capgras syndrome – a rare condition in which the patient believes
that an impostor who has taken on a similar appearance has replaced a family member
or close acquaintance. Capgras syndrome is more properly referred to as Capgras delusion
as it is a particular type of delusional disorder (delusional misrepresentation of personal
identity). It is most commonly seen in schizophrenia but a third of cases are thought to
be due to organic pathology such as brain injury or dementia.

!

Other rare delusional disorders

• Fregoli delusion – a belief that another person disguises him or herself as several
people.

• Delusional misidentification – this is a catch all phrase for Capgras syndrome,
•
•

Fregoli delusion and other misidentification syndromes such as the belief in a
Doppleganger (or double).
Cotard’s syndrome – a delusion that the person is dead or that a part of them is
dead or does not exist.
Erotomania – the belief that another person (often of higher status) is in love with
the sufferer.

This man has a number of risk factors for cerebrovascular accident and vascular dementia
(i.e. hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischaemic heart disease).
Given this and the high prevalence of organic aetiology in Capgras syndrome it is
important to thoroughly assess his cognitive functioning. In addition to cognitive testing
using a tool such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Addenbrookes
Cognitive Examination (ACE) it would be appropriate to refer this man for brain imaging.
Consideration may also need to be given to referring him to a neuropsychologist for more
detailed cognitive assessment.
It is interesting to note that patients with this presentation have an intact ability to
recognize faces (that is they do not have prosopagnosia). It is thought that they do not
experience an appropriate emotional response when they do recognize the face of the
person they believe has been replaced by an impostor. From this it is hypothesized that
it is the lack of an appropriate emotional response that leads the patient into believing
that there is something odd about the person from which develops the delusion that they
are really an impostor.
KEY POINTS

• Delusional misinterpretation of personal identity may be indicative of organic pathology.
• It is important to perform detailed cognitive examination in all such cases.

186

CASE 74:

MARKED TREMOR, GETTING WORSE

History
A 75-year-old man presents worried that he has recently developed quite a marked
tremor and nothing he can do helps control it. He has no other concerns and is currently
well. The man has a long established diagnosis of bipolar disorder, which has been wellcontrolled with lithium. His medication was recently changed.
Mental state examination
The man is cooperative and communicative with good eye contact. His speech is normal.
His mood is objectively and subjectively stable. He does not express any ideas of selfharm. There is no evidence of psychosis. He is orientated in time, place and person and
there is no cognitive impairment.
Physical examination
The man looks well and there is nothing of note except a marked coarse tremor. The
tremor is not rhythmic and is present at rest and when he attempts a task. There is no
indication of any cogwheel rigidity or lack of facial expressions.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What are the signs of lithium toxicity?
• How should lithium toxicity be managed?
• How can the potential for lithium toxicity be minimized?

187

ANSWER 74
The most likely diagnosis would be lithium toxicity but other disorders such as
Parkinson’s disease should be excluded.
People who are taking lithium for bipolar disorder may develop lithium toxicity because
there is only a small difference between a therapeutic serum lithium level and a toxic
level. Patients therefore need to have regular blood tests that measure serum lithium
levels. In order for this to be meaningful, blood should be taken 10 to 14 hours after the
previous dose. The usual therapeutic range is between 0.4 and 1 mmol/L.
Many adverse effects of lithium are dose-related. Mild gastrointestinal symptoms, fine
hand tremor, mild thirst and polyuria and a metallic taste in the mouth are all recognized
side effects which can occur when serum levels are within the therapeutic range. Lithium
toxicity is a potentially life-threatening condition, and is usually associated with serum
levels greater than 1.5 mmol/L but can occur at lower serum levels.

!

Symptoms and signs of lithium toxicity

• Blurred vision.
• Worsening GI symptoms (anorexia, diarrhoea, vomiting).
• Muscle weakness, drowsiness, ataxia, coarse tremor and muscle twitching.
Severe toxicity (serum levels above 2 mmol/L) can lead to:

• hyperreflexia, disorientation, seizures, syncope, renal failure, nystagmus,
circulatory failure, coma and death.

Many people may endure mild side effects in order to take an effective dosage. However, if
symptoms become worse (or new symptoms develop), lithium toxicity should be suspected.

!

Be alerted:

• Lithium levels >1.5 mmol/L (>2.0 mmol/L may be associated with serious toxicity).
• Lithium toxicity should also be suspected at ‘therapeutic’ levels in compromised
patients with relevant symptoms.

Treatment for toxic levels of lithium
The treatment for lithium toxicity depends on a few factors, including the level of lithium
in the blood. If the level in the blood is very high, dialysis can be helpful. Stopping
lithium for a while may be necessary, although a dose reduction may be adequate in mild
cases. Rehydration can also be helpful.
Preventing lithium toxicity
Patients need to be properly educated on the symptoms of toxicity so they can identify
them early and also be aware of the need for close monitoring. Regular fluid intake is
important as dehydration increases risk of toxicity as do crash diets. Doses cannot be
skipped and made up later so careful compliance is key.
KEY POINTS

• Lithium toxicity can be fatal so needs prompt attention.
• Careful monitoring and patient education should prevent severe toxicity.
• Be aware of interactions with other medications.
188

CASE 75:

HE CAN’T SIT STILL

History
A 7-year-old boy appears in the accident and emergency department having banged his
head after falling from a garage roof. He vomited once after this but has not become
unconscious or had any loss of power or sensation. He has had no other neurological
problems on systematic enquiry. His parents are with him. They say that he has always
been very active and ask if he can be seen by someone who might check him out. He has
a normal night’s sleep, but is very active when awake. He rarely stays on task and does
not finish things that he starts. He has always flitted from toy to toy when playing. His
teachers report to the parents that he is a fidget, up and down out of his chair and that
he has very poor concentration. He calls answers out despite being reminded not to and
has great difficulty waiting in a queue. He is easily distracted by things outside the
window or in other parts of the classroom. This is much the same at home. If he takes
anything to school he often loses it and has had to have three new coats in the last year
because previous ones have gone missing. Even when watching favoured television
programmes he will be up and down out of the chair, and in and out of the room.
Questions
• What is the most likely cause of his problems?
• What interventions are available?

189

ANSWER 75
It is likely that this boy has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This is a DSM-IV diagnosis
characterized by pervasively poor ability to concentrate (i.e. not in one situation only),
impulsivity, distractibility and overactivity. These should be present in greater severity and
frequency than that found developmentally. While all small children can be distractible in
some settings, in ADHD this continues from infancy and remains present at primary school.
There are two main types: ADHD predominately inattentive and ADHD mixed type. The
latter includes all four main symptom groups of attention/concentration, impulsivity,
distractibility and overactivity. The former includes the other three main symptoms but
not overactivity. There is a theoretical third group, ADHD predominately overactive, but
this is rarely found since most of the overactive children also have the other difficulties.
The World Health Organization uses the term ‘Hyperkinetic disorder’ and this maps onto
the mixed type of ADHD from DSM-IV. ADHD has a significant impact on social and
educational functioning.
In the differential it is important to consider attachment disorders. Young children who
are neglected or abused emotionally, and young children who have consistently poor
experiences of parenting, can develop attachment disorders which have an impact on
behaviour and social relationships. One of the subtypes is a disinhibited attachment
disorder, which can look similar to ADHD. Many parents mistake conduct disorders and
oppositional defiant disorder as ADHD. This is because ADHD is a risk factor for
behavioural problems, and so children with ADHD often go on to develop conduct
disorder. However, the reverse is not true. Being true to the diagnosis of ADHD is
important to make sure that children do not end up on unnecessary or inappropriate
treatments. Organic problems also need to be considered including epilepsy, Fragile X
syndrome and neurodegenerative disorders. Children who have dyslexia are also at high
risk of classroom failure, and concomitant behaviours. This should always be checked.
The main treatments for ADHD are educational and behavioural interventions through
parenting programmes and advice to teachers. Some children require extra help in school.
Where a child is at risk of social failure, educational failure or family breakdown then
medication with stimulants such as methylphenidate or dexamfetamine are appropriate.
This dramatically improves concentration in children. It is not a diagnostic test because it
improves concentration in most children, but can be particularly helpful for children with
ADHD. Some psychiatrists prescribe this for school days only, while if symptoms are severe
the child may be prescribed the medication seven days a week. Drug holidays at least every
year are helpful during summer holidays to review progress and check the need for
ongoing medication. A variety of second line medications have been used if stimulants are
not effective including clonidine and tricyclics. Many young people’s symptoms improve
with age. Good services have a range of psychosocial interventions including specialist
parenting groups, skills programmes for children and adolescents, and advice about
environmental management (for example, sensory aspects). This empowers children and
young people to live with their neurodevelopmental difficulties and develop coping
strategies that allow them to come off medication in adolescence.
KEY POINTS

• Genetic factors are known to be important in ADHD.
• Environmental factors such as parenting can influence outcome.
• For severe ADHD, stimulant medication is used alongside psychosocial interventions
(parenting support and behavioural and educational interventions).

CASE 76:

SOCIALLY ISOLATED

History
A 12-year-old boy is brought by his parents to the general practitioner surgery. His
mother is concerned that in year 7 at secondary school he has no friends. He spends most
of his time in the library or walking around the playground. He has never had many
friends although there was one other boy in year 6 who came to his house sometimes to
play on the computer. They took it in turns, but his mother recalls that they rarely spoke
to each other and when they did it was to discuss the details of the game. Sometimes her
son would leave his friend playing on his own and go and do something in another room.
He is not very good at responding when others in the family are hurt. He will stop and
watch or carry on what he is doing. His mother gave the example of her banging her head
on a sharp corner on his ninth birthday. She was tearful and he asked her without much
emotion why her ‘eyes were wet’. She describes that he has been doing reasonably well
with his school work, and is in top set for sciences and mathematics, although in
mathematics the teacher has fed back that he is resistant to doing things the way the
teacher wants, preferring to do things his own way. He is very interested in electric fans
and has a collection of at least 20. He is also very knowledgeable about aeroplanes and
can talk at length and in detail about various makes across history. His teacher says that
he sometimes takes things literally. Once when the teacher said: ‘take your seats’ he
picked his seat up and asked where he should take it to. He will tell other children if what
they are doing is against the rules, and is unpopular as a result. He has always struggled
greatly with role play activities. When he comes in from school he goes round the house
checking that certain objects are in the ‘right’ place and this takes about 15 minutes. He
has no history of delay in his motor or language acquisition milestones.
Mental state examination
In the surgery his eye contact is poor, and he has a tendency to turn to his mother when
the GP asks him a question. He is smartly dressed in a tracksuit, and noticeably has no
zips or buttons (his mother says she also has to cut labels off as he does not like them).
There is no evidence of any psychomotor retardation, or any psychotic phenomena. He is
not sure why he is in the GP surgery. He says he is happy and has no problems. When
asked who his friends are he lists one other boy, the milkman, his grandfather and his
teaching assistant. There is no evidence of psychosis or depressive illness.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What possible interventions may help?

191

ANSWER 76
The most likely diagnosis is Asperger syndrome. This is on the autism spectrum of
conditions, and involves social reciprocity problems, delay in imagination skills, and
repetitive or stereotyped interests and behaviours. It is different from autism in that there
is no delay in language acquisition and no cognitive delay (IQ below 70). While his
language acquisition was normal he does have problems with the pragmatics of language
and is likely to take things literally and have problems with abstract thinking. He is also
likely to have conversational reciprocity problems. He has some ‘mindblindness’ where he
is poor at understanding other people’s emotions, for example, when his mother was hurt.
He clearly has a very limited understanding of friendship, and has peer relationship
problems. He also has eye contact problems. He has some unusual preoccupations
including fans and an intense preoccupation with aeroplanes. While preoccupations in
themselves are not necessarily diagnostic they are often present.
Differential diagnosis includes depression, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety or
social anxiety disorder of childhood. Asperger syndrome is lifelong, whereas anxiety and
depression have an onset that may be related to life events such as family breakdown,
bereavement, trauma, stress or significant change. Social anxiety is not usually
accompanied by delay in imaginative development or the presence of repetitive and
stereotyped patterns of behaviour. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should be
considered but would not normally have the range of other problems such as social
reciprocity difficulties and imagination delay. Also, preoccupations or intense interests in
Asperger syndrome are usually enjoyed, and therefore different from the resisted
obsessions and compulsions of OCD. Extreme shyness in an otherwise healthy child
should be considered but would not usually involve the significant theory of mind delays
(mindblindness). Some children have socio-emotional delay that can mimic Asperger
syndrome because of early life social or communicative deprivation. Examples of this
would be deaf children born into hearing families where early life communication is poor,
or children in orphanages in developing countries who have little interaction with others.
Emotionally abused or neglected children can also have poor empathy and odd social
behaviour depending on what they have experienced.
Making the diagnosis and getting it right is important as it directs parents, carers and
teachers towards helpful interventions. Diagnosis can be aided by diagnostic interviews
(such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview or the Diagnostic Interview for Social and
Communication Disorders) and interactive assessments (such as the Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule).
Children with Asperger syndrome need extra support in school. While children with
autism may need a special school, those with Asperger syndrome would usually be
supported in mainstream school. Parent training programmes have been shown to be
helpful in improving developmental pathways. Group work for the child including daily
living skill work, independence work and support for social interaction may also help.
Individual work from parents and teachers can use a variety of books and computer
programmes designed to teach skills and abilities that children with Asperger syndrome
may find it hard to pick up intuitively. This includes learning social rules, learning to read
body language, facial expressions, and learning social problem solving skills.
Occasionally medication such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be helpful for intense
compulsions or ritualized behaviour, although there needs to be further research to give
a more robust evidence base for their use. Children and young people with Asperger
syndrome can be happy and successful given the right support and environment.
192

Allowing them to develop their interests and supporting them in their productive interests
can be helpful and rewarding.
KEY POINTS

• Asperger syndrome is similar to autism but with an IQ above 70 and without language
acquisition delay.

• Mindblindness (delay in the development of theory of mind skills) is a core feature.
• Interventions designed to support development and learning of socio-emotional skills
are helpful.

CASE 77:

KILLED HIS FRIEND’S HAMSTER AND IN TROUBLE
ALL THE TIME

History
A 14-year-old boy presents to casualty with cuts on his hand that require stitches. It
transpires that the injury was sustained in a fight with a friend because he killed the
hamster of his friend’s younger sibling. He has shown no remorse and appears amused
by the distress he has caused. He rarely attends school usually preferring to play truant
with peers. When he does go to school, he often gets into trouble for threatening
behaviour and for answering back. His mother feels she has no control over her son and
that his aggressive behaviour is escalating. His mother also states that he runs around
with a bad group who are probably engaged in vandalism and theft. She states that her
son can be very moody and has more recently been erratic in his behaviour. She says she
thinks he is often restless and cannot sleep at night. She hears him wandering round the
house but when she has tried to talk to him he tells her to mind her own business. He has
had no regular contact with his father who has spent spells in prison.
Mental state examination
You are faced with a hostile sullen teenager who is verbally abusive and makes poor eye
contact. He is uncooperative and impatient, demanding his injury be dealt with
immediately so he can leave. He is also abusive towards his mother when she tries to
interject. He denies feeling low in mood and has not tried to harm himself. During your
interview there is no evidence that he is being bothered by hallucinations and does not
come across as thought disordered. He is orientated in time, place and person.
Questions
• What causes might you consider to explain this boy’s presentation?
• How would you manage this case?

195

ANSWER 77
It is worth formulating this child’s difficulties in a multi-axial way. The differential
diagnosis is conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, anxiety, depression, social phobia, substance misuse, learning disability and any
combination of these disorders. As with most child mental health problems, conduct
disorder has a multifactorial aetiology. Exposure to the antisocial behaviour of a
caregiver is a particularly important risk factor. Children with conduct disorder appear to
be overrepresented in lower socioeconomic groups.

!

Multi-axial classification (ICD-10)

•
•
•
•
•

Axis 1 – Mental health diagnosis
Axis 2 – Developmental
Axis 3 – Intellectual
Axis 4 – Organic/physical
Axis 5 – Psychosocial

While most clinicians are keen to avoid pathologizing young people with diagnostic
labels, the classification systems recognize that certain patterns of severe behaviour have
significant consequences for child, family, community and prognosis. Conduct disorder is
a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviours in which the rights of others are violated
or there is age inappropriate violation of societal norms lasting at least 6 months. The
behaviours include unusually severe and frequent outbursts that are developmentally
inappropriate, argumentative, not compliant with authority, hostile and angry, untruthful
and may include aggression, physical cruelty to animals, vandalism, truancy, criminal
activity and bullying. This list is not exhaustive.
While ICD-10 defines conduct disorder in terms of socialized, unsocialized or confined to
the home context, more recent research suggests a subdivision of two subtypes; childhood
onset type which has onset before the age of 10 years, and adolescent onset type with no
conduct problems before this age. The childhood onset type is often very difficult to treat.
It is longstanding and is usually associated with psychosocial adversity and poor
parenting. It has a worse prognosis than short-lived adolescent problems, where
behaviours may be reflective of adolescent development such as risk taking and
experimenting (for example, with drugs). In many this behaviour does not persist.
Harming animals is a particularly worrying feature. In general, most children and young
people with conduct disorder do not go on to become antisocial adults, but most
antisocial adults have had conduct problems when younger.
Conduct disorder is a difficult disorder to treat and there are high levels of co-morbidity
such as low mood. This should be excluded. There is little evidence to justify the use of
medication to control aggression. For childhood onset type, parenting programmes
should be used as early as practicable, as negative ineffective parenting may perpetuate
the problems. Family therapy, support and behaviour modification may help. The young
man may benefit from a positive relationship with a male. Youth groups can sometimes
provide healthy peer influences and role models.
The acute management would involve dealing with his hand injury. Being sympathetic but
not allowing him to push boundaries may help him feel contained and improve his
engagement with you. A referral to a parenting support service or child mental health
services as an out-patient may allow the family to discuss any issues that need addressing.
196

KEY POINTS

• Conduct disorder often has co-morbidity with other disorders so it is important to
exclude and treat co-existing disorders.

• To date conduct disorder is difficult to treat and has a relatively poor prognosis,
particularly when onset is in childhood, behaviours are longstanding, and when peers
and family demonstrate similar behaviours.

CASE 78:

ANOREXIA

History
A 17-year-old girl is admitted to casualty having fainted during a games lesson at school.
She is embarrassed by the fuss she has caused and insists she is okay. She skipped
breakfast and says she is now fine and would like to be discharged. She denies any
problems with her health. She reluctantly admits that her periods are less regular than
they had been. She had menarche at the age of 13 but over the last six months has only
had two periods. She is not sexually active. She is doing extremely well at school in her
AS subjects having achieved 10 A stars at GCSE six months ago. Her parents recently
separated but she feels they have minimized the impact to her and her younger two
siblings.
Physical examination
She looks very tired and has slightly sunken cheeks. Her clothing is very baggy and ill
fitting. Her fingers are tinged blue and she feels cold to touch. She has fine downy hair
on her arms. Her height is 160 cm and weight is 42 kg, giving her a BMI of 16.4. There
is no evidence of other serious mental illness.

!

Body mass index (BMI)
Body mass index is a standardized ratio of weight to height, and is often used as a
general indicator of health. BMI can be calculated by dividing the weight (in
kilograms) by the square of the height (in metres). A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is
considered normal for most adults. Higher BMIs may indicate that an individual is
overweight or obese.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you manage this case?

199

ANSWER 78
The most likely diagnosis is anorexia nervosa. Differential diagnosis includes organic
conditions (unlikely but needs exclusion) and depression. Phobia of foodstuffs (for
example, solid food) and obsessive-compulsive disorder could also be considered. For
anorexia to be diagnosed there must be weight loss (or in children, a lack of weight gain).
The limitation of the body mass index (BMI) is that it may overestimate body fat in those
with muscular build and may underestimate body fat in those who have lost muscle fat.
It is also less reliable in younger teenagers. The weight loss is self-induced often by
avoiding eating but especially avoiding fattening foods. Associated with poor food
intake, there may be obsessive behaviour around preparation of food for others. There
may also be associated vomiting and laxative abuse to ensure that no weight is gained.
Vomiting may lead to hypokalaemia which can be dangerous particularly if it changes
rapidly. Excessive exercise may also be present. Amenorrhoea may be present in those
that have started their periods, as the body seeks to conserve resources. A key feature is
that those with the disorder have distorted cognition that they are too fat with real fear
of gaining weight and becoming fat. This is despite the evidence that they are
underweight and often dangerously so. The belief that they are too fat often has a
delusional quality but there are no other features of psychosis. However, prolonged
starvation itself has an impact on cognitive functioning. Once weight loss is in progress,
immunological and hormonal factors may play a role in a malignant spiral down and
maintenance of anorexia nervosa. The mortality for anorexia is high at around 5% (and
0.5% per year). Anorexia occurs significantly more in females (around 100 females to 1
male) and is more common in Western cultures, but can occur in all cultures. It is tending
to occur in younger and younger children. The aetiology is multifactorial and it is
thought that media representations of women play a major role in the disorder. Prognosis
is worse for onset before 11 years of age and in adulthood. Around 50% of individuals
with anorexia will recover but others will continue to have problems.
It is important to undertake a thorough assessment and a corroborative history will be
important. Acute management needs to make sure she is medically safe so rehydration
would be the first step as she is dehydrated. Longer term management will include referral
to specialist CAMH services or an eating disorder team (depending on local
arrangements). The priority will be to work towards gradual and sustained weight gain
and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), which works towards changing their relationship
with food. There is good evidence that in children under 14 years of age family therapy
is effective and is the treatment of choice. Antidepressants may be required for those who
also have a strong affective component. Prolonged starvation takes its toll on the body
and will cause physical side effects that warrant attention.

CASE 79:

CUTTING ON THE FOREARMS

History
A 16-year-old girl presents after being in a car accident where a car drove into the back
of the car that her mother was driving. This happened on a motorway slip road the
previous day. Having initially thought there were no injuries, she has woken up with pain
and stiffness in her neck and a sore right wrist. She thinks she may have knocked it on
the dashboard. She attends the general practitioner surgery and you examine her.
Mental state examination
On examination she has no evidence of any fractures, no neurological symptoms or signs
on history or examination. You diagnose whiplash and recommend simple analgesia, a
neck collar and arrange physiotherapy. On examination you notice multiple new and old
transverse scars on her forearms hidden underneath a long sleeve jumper. On further
discussion the girl explains that she has been cutting herself on a regular basis to relieve
stress for about 18 months. Some of the scarring is deep. On examination of
her spine there are several linear scars on her lower outer back extending round to
her abdomen.
Questions
• What reasons are there for this form of self-harm that you should consider when taking
a further history?
• What aspects of risk assessment should you consider?

203

ANSWER 79
There are various things the GP will need to ask about. It will be necessary to rule out
depression.

!

Factors to ask about to rule out depression

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Mood
Levels of energy
Sleep patterns
Appetite
Ability to enjoy oneself (anhedhonia is loss of pleasure in things previously
enjoyed)
Concentration
Loss of interest in or withdrawal from everyday activities
Lethargy
Feelings of guilt
Hopelessness or low self-worth
Irritability
Ideas of self-harm or suicidal thoughts or intent

It is always important in any situation where there has been self-harm or low mood to
enquire about past history of self-harm, and thoughts of suicide. This should be
approached sensitively and gently with questions like: ‘Do you ever think that life is not
worth living?’ ‘Would you ever do anything about these thoughts?’ ‘Have you any
particular plans?’ (see Case 32).
However many young people who cut are not depressed, and the GP will need to ask
about other things. Is the young person cutting because she has obsessional thoughts or
ruminations that only go away temporarily when she cuts (obsessive-compulsive
disorder)? Is the cutting maladaptive care seeking behaviour? Some young people
stumble across this when they cut once in response to a stressful event and it elicits a lot
of support or kudos from a peer group or caring professional or family member.
Occasionally several members of the same social group may cut and do this in a mutually
supportive or competitive way. It can also occur in a socialized context, where several
school friends are cutting as part of a subcultural group that is associated with certain
types of music or subcultural viewpoints. Young people may also cut to avoid a
predicament, such as a dreaded examination in a perfectionistic child who feels
unprepared, or impending return home to an abusive parent. The cutting may be a
mechanism for emotional regulation where feelings of guilt are acted out, or trapped
emotions (such as anger) are internalized and expressed against the self.

!

Risk assessment
Good risk assessment tools consider risks of:

• Self-harm
• Suicide
• Exploitation

204

• Abuse
• Neglect
• Harm to others

This young woman should be referred to a child mental health team who can more
formally assess what is going on and what interventions to offer. The treatment will
depend on the reasons for the self-harm, and will range from no ‘treatment’ to group,
family or individual therapy (for example, CBT). Where risk is assessed as low and where
the young person does not want treatment (for example, with a subcultural desire to cut
without other signs of mental illness) then follow-up may not be appropriate. At the other
end of the spectrum, serious cutting with intent to commit suicide should be taken
seriously and where the young person does not want treatment the Mental Health Act
should be considered.
KEY POINTS

• There are many different causes for self-harm behaviour and careful assessment is
necessary to establish the most appropriate treatment.

• Parental consent can be used for minors refusing treatment.
• It is commonly thought that the Mental Health Act can only be used with adults. This is
not the case. The Mental Health Act can be used with any age if appropriate.

CASE 80:

FEELINGS OF GUILT

History
A 15-year-old girl presents with a 4-month history of feelings of being a failure and
hopelessness. She is overwhelmed by feelings of guilt that she is a burden to her family.
She thinks her parents are unaware of how bad she feels as she has not shared her
feelings with them because she does not want them to worry.
She has been struggling with her school work which has declined over the last 4 months.
Her concentration is very poor and she has struggled to complete work in class or at
home. She has lost some friends who have found it a misery to be around her. Up until
about six months ago she was doing well in school with a good group of friends. She
used to be actively involved in school activities but this has now fallen away as have
social activities with friends at the weekend. Sometimes she will force herself to spend
time with friends because she feels guilty at letting people down, but does not enjoy the
activity and feels even worse after it.
She does not sleep well. She lies in bed worrying about everything that has happened and
worrying about what she has done wrong. When she does fall asleep she will wake after
a short time. She dreads waking up in the morning and facing the day ahead. At other
times she may sleep for long periods but feels no more rested. Her appetite is poor and
she has lost some weight.
She has regular thoughts of self-harm but is torn by her mixed feelings. Part of her feels
that if she did harm herself her family would be upset so that prevents her from carrying
out her thoughts. At other times she feels it would be in her family’s interests if she did
end her life so she could stop being a burden. She does not see the situation improving.
She has thoughts of taking an overdose when no one else is at home.

Mental state examination
She is casually dressed and struggles to make eye contact. She is cooperative but often
struggles to answer your questions. She cannot be distracted by small talk. Her speech is
slow and laboured. She states that she feels low and she looks and sounds depressed. She
has regular and persistent thoughts regarding self-harm but has not yet acted out these
feelings. She does not see much hope for the future. There is no evidence of psychosis.
She is orientated in time, place and person.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• How would you manage this girl?

207

ANSWER 80
The most likely diagnosis is moderate to severe depression. Features of depression include
biological symptoms. Look for marked loss of interest or pleasure in usually pleasurable
activities, lack of emotional responses to situations that usually would evoke a response,
diurnal mood variation, sleep disturbance (young people may not get the early morning
waking associated with depression in adults, and often find that they sleep more but still
do not feel rested), poor appetite and/or weight loss (again young people may eat more),
psychomotor retardation and agitation. Biological symptoms are less consistent in young
people. Associated with these will be low mood and inability to concentrate. The young
person may experience lack of confidence, poor self-esteem, negative feelings (such as
worthlessness, guilt) and self-harm ideation. Moderate depression has greater severity and
often a greater number of symptoms. Mild and moderate depression do not have
psychotic features (see Case 81).
Everybody learns lists in different ways. The symptoms of depression can be thought of
as computer MAC GAMES, with letters standing for the 12 main symptoms mentioned in
ICD-10: depressed Mood for at least two weeks, Anhedonia, poor Concentration, Guilty
feelings, Appetite disturbance, abnormal Movements, low Energy and then the 5 S’s of
low Self-esteem, thoughts of Suicide/Self-harm, Sleep disturbance, reduced Sex drive
and Somatization.

!

ICD-10 categories of non-psychotic depression

•
•
•
•
•

F33 Recurrent Depressive Disorder
F32 Depressive Episode
F32.0 Mild Depressive Episode (4 from 12 symptoms)
F32.1 Moderate Depressive Episode (6 from 12 symptoms)
F32.2 Severe Depressive Episode (8 from 12) Without Psychotic Symptoms

Depression is more common in girls but it may be that it presents with more aggressive
and hostile behaviour in males. It is less common before adolescence. There is some
genetic loading, but in many cases the social disadvantage that is experienced by parents
leading to depression is also experienced by their children.
An initial assessment which includes a detailed risk assessment is necessary. This girl is
at moderate risk of harming herself given the feelings of being a burden and not having
shared how bad she has felt. It would also be useful to get a parental history as they may
provide some useful insights into her pre-morbid personality.
She would best be managed by individual counselling and medication. Medication is not
as efficaceous in adolescents. Certain serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine
have the best evidence base. Once her mood has lifted and she is more amenable,
cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) would be useful to help her manage both her negative
feelings and feelings of guilt. Given her age it is also important to engage her parents so
that they can provide appropriate support and also another perspective.
KEY POINTS

• Depression is relatively common in adolescents.
• A high proportion of depression in adolescence abates with time and change in circumstances.
• Mild and moderate depression may be effectively treated with cognitive behaviour
and/or interpersonal therapy.

• Severe depression may need to be managed using the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine.
208

CASE 81:

INTENSE FEELINGS OF WORTHLESSNESS

History
A 15-year-old girl is presented by her mother. The girl has a 6-month history of becoming
increasingly withdrawn and irritable. She is barely eating and wants to sleep all the time
complaining of being tired. She is no longer attending school as she cannot concentrate
and cannot cope with having to deal with other people. She used to be a high achiever
at school but recently her work has declined. Over the last few weeks her parents have
become even more concerned as at times the girl appears to be talking to herself and has
become acutely distressed and tearful for no obvious reason. Her mother reports that all
was reasonably well up until 6 months ago. There were a number of family losses just
before that time but she feels her daughter managed reasonably well. There is no
particular family history of note. The mother is not aware of any substance misuse.
Mental state examination
The girl avoids eye contact and is non communicative. She has psychomotor retardation
but no waxy flexibility. She is dishevelled with uncombed hair and is wearing her bed
clothes. She is socially detached. Her speech is slow and almost retarded. She appears not
to hear what you are saying and often struggles to formulate a response. She says she
feels ‘okay’ but is convinced that she does not deserve to live. When pushed she states
she is worthless and this is confirmed by berating voices which continually confirm that
self-belief of worthlessness. She avoids answering your questions about whether she has
considered self-harm or whether she has made any attempts or plans. She is also
convinced that everyone agrees with the voices. She is able to provide evidence of her
worthlessness in aspects of her parents’ responses to her. She is orientated in person but
not aware of the time of day or the day of the week. She is aware she is at home but not
sure of why she is seeing you.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you manage this situation?

209

ANSWER 81
The most likely diagnosis is depression with psychotic features. Differential diagnosis
would include bipolar disorder, organic psychosis, schizophrenia and substance misuse.
However the delusions of worthlessness and derogatory hallucinations make depression
with psychosis more likely. The features of depression in young people have been outlined
in Case 80.
The immediate concern would be the high risk of this girl attempting to take her own life.
Although self-harm in adolescents is very common, completed suicide is not. However,
the risk rises when there is a mental illness. The fact that she feels she is worthless
together with her psychotic features make this a high risk situation. Her detachment is
also worrying. The acute management requires a risk assessment. In-patient care may
need to be considered especially if she is evasive about her self-harm ideation. It is
important to check mental state across time as this can vary greatly in teenagers. It is
likely that she will need treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants
(such as fluoxetine). Given the extent of her psychosis, antipsychotic medication will also
be required. Risperidone would be a good starting option. If she does not agree to an
informal admission, she can be admitted on the basis of her parents’ agreement. However,
it is usually better practice to use the Mental Health Act as it affords the girl greater
protection of her rights. Whether she is admitted or not will depend in part on her risk
and also how the family are able to manage this and keep her safe. Electroconvulsive
therapy (ECT) is rarely considered in people under the age of 18. She is likely to need
some supportive therapy during the acute stage and as her psychosis settles. Cognitive
behaviour therapy would also be of benefit. The family will also require support in how
best to help the girl. On recovery, therapies and support that allow her to return to normal
living are crucial and involvement of the early intervention psychosis team will ensure
follow-up and relapse prevention.
KEY POINTS

• Depression with features of psychosis carries greater risk of self-harm and suicide.
• Careful history taking is necessary with a need to be careful not just to take information

CASE 82:

SEEING THINGS THAT AREN’T THERE

History
A 17-year-old man attends the accident and emergency department with his girlfriend.
He lives with his parents, who don’t know he is here. She says that for the last 4 weeks
he has been seeing things that scare him in the night. He often can’t describe them but
they are large shapes that move and are accompanied with strong sensations of fear. She
says he does not want to see any of his friends and is worried that they hate him and
want to do him some harm. He explains that he has had panic attacks during the day and
regularly experiences palpitations. He has increased his previous use of cannabis because
this helps him feel more relaxed. His girlfriend says that one day she came in and watched
him from the door. She found him sitting, rocking and picking at his skin and seemed to
be in a world of his own. He admits that he has always used a range of substances
including alcohol, cannabis, MDMA (Ecstasy), methylphenidate, temazepam, ketamine
and dexamfetamine. His girlfriend says that he does not want his parents to know he has
come.
Mental state examination
He is dishevelled and smells strongly, as if he hasn’t washed for a while. He is furtive and
does not sit still. His eye contact is fleeting. Occasionally he wrings his hands or rocks
and then stops as if checking himself. He glances up regularly at his girlfriend and the
cubicle curtain. He turns abruptly several times and looks at the oxygen port on the
cubicle wall, and when you ask him what he is looking at he says: ‘Can you hear that?’
When you ask about this he says: ‘mumbling and stuff’. You hear no noises of this nature.
He looks frightened, and when asked says: ‘I feel like death, awful’. He has some paranoid
ideas about his friends wanting to harm him. His girlfriend interrupts to say that his two
best friends care about him and want to help him. He looks at her intently but does not
reply. He says he has no intention to harm anyone or himself. His insight into his
problems is limited.
Physical examination shows a raised blood pressure of 145/95 mmHg and a pulse of
100/min.

Questions
• What questions can you use to elicit auditory hallucinations?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What is the most likely diagnosis and the treatment?

211

ANSWER 82
A question to elicit auditory hallucinations is not ‘Can you hear voices?’ since this can
mean many different things to different people. A clearer question is ‘Do you ever hear
any noises or voices when there is no-one around or nothing to explain it?’
In the differential diagnosis it is important to exclude physical causes. These would
include hyperthyroidism, delirium caused by infection, alcohol withdrawal or a spaceoccupying lesion.
Panic disorder would explain some of the symptoms but not all of them. A paranoid
psychosis such as schizophrenia is possible, but the most likely diagnosis is drug-induced
psychosis. Amphetamine-like drugs make more dopamine available at receptor sites and
are thought to be responsible for either provoking a brief psychotic episode or for
precipitating psychosis in someone who has a predisposition to it.
The treatment includes a decision to stop using the drug that is leading to the problem.
Motivational interviewing may help. A period of observation during this time is helpful.
Ideally no medication would be used unless the young person was highly agitated or
distressed in which case medication can be used symptomatically. Dopamine-blocking
antipsychotic medication such as olanzapine, risperidone or quetiapine may be used if
symptoms do not abate.
Treatment includes close monitoring and is likely to require admission to hospital or some
intense home treatment. If the patient poses a risk to himself or others use of the Mental
Health Act and hospital admission should be considered. If the patient is on medication
side effects should be monitored. The care plan should include consideration of the
patient’s family and his social needs. Support will be needed to help him regain his
confidence and a relapse prevention plan will need to be drawn up once recovery is
underway. This would include psychoeducational work and lifestyle changes.
He is 17 and so can consent in his own right if he has capacity. It will be important to
assess this. You will need to involve the child mental health service (although he can also
choose to see the adult services if he prefers). It is good practice to involve the family as
they can help in the recovery, and it will be necessary to sensitively explore why he does
not want to inform his parents. If they are likely to be supportive then gentle discussion
with him and his girlfriend about involving the family should take place.
KEY POINTS

• Drugs that make more dopamine available at receptor sites can provoke psychosis.
• Drug-induced psychosis can occur from a range of psychoactive substances that are both
prescribed and illegally obtained.

• Mesolimbic and other dopaminergic pathways are thought to be affected.
• Delusions, auditory, visual and rarely tactile hallucinations may occur. Cognitive effects
(including thought disorder) may occur.

• Relapse prevention work is essential.
• Dopamine-blocking medication should be used if abstinence from the offending
medication does not lead to improvement.

CASE 83:

SEPARATION ANXIETY

History
A 7-year-old girl presents with a poor track record of school attendance. Her mother
struggles to get her to school because the girl is constantly tearful. Her mother reports
that her daughter has always been a somewhat anxious and sensitive child. When she
was a toddler she used to get very upset if her mother was not constantly with her. It was
so difficult that her mother gave up her job and became a nursery assistant to ensure the
girl went to nursery. She had hoped things would improve as her daughter got older but
in fact things are now worse than ever. Her daughter is reluctant to be looked after by
anyone other than her mother, and cries constantly if her mother is not visible to her. She
will not sleep in her own room and by the morning has often worked her way to her
parents’ room or bed. This is causing some marital tension as the father feels the girl is
this way because her mother is too soft. Her mother states that there is nothing of note
in the girl’s early history except that when she was about three her mother had a few days
in hospital. She wonders if the clinginess became worse when she returned home.
Mental state examination
The girl is reluctant to talk with you or join you in playing with the toys in your room.
She sits almost on top of her mother clinging to her. The mere suggestion that she might
be seen alone elicits floods of tears and she is almost inconsolable. When she is persuaded
by her mother with a lot of coaxing to speak, she avoids eye contact with you and
addresses her mother. She talks in a babyish voice. After continued encouragement she
says a few words to you. There is still no eye contact and she remains in close physical
contact with her mother.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How would you manage this?

213

ANSWER 83
The most likely diagnosis is separation anxiety disorder which is more common in girls
and is most notable around the time of starting school. There is a need to exclude a
general anxiety condition and any other anxieties as these often coexist. It is also worth
considering if there have been any recent life events that might have exacerbated an
already difficult situation. Children who have been traumatized or abused may be very
clingy and anxious. Autistic spectrum disorder may also need to be excluded with high
levels of anxiety in some as they struggle to cope with social situations.
It is likely that there may be a strong family history of anxiety and/or mood disorders.
Children with separation anxiety disorder are at greater risk of developing mood disorders
and other anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, social phobia and/or agoraphobia in
later life. Separation anxiety is developmentally normal from about 7–9 months of age
and declines with time, but separation anxiety disorder goes on for longer and can
interfere with social functioning. It can be understood from an attachment theory
perspective.
The treatment of choice is systemic therapy or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in a
family context. The family and other adults will need education around the
developmental needs of the child in terms of the development of resilience in the face of
anxieties and how as parents to support this. The strategies parents sometimes use of
protecting the child from the anxiety or repeated reassurance may reduce coping and
reinforce rather than allay the anxiety. In shorter term cases a straightforward
behavioural management plan may be all that is required after careful explanations and
support to the family. Useful techniques to use can be positive self-talk, coping strategy
work and cognitive techniques to explore different ways of looking at the issue.
Encouraging open communication and discussion of difficult situations with problem
solving can empower many children. Relaxation techniques such as visualization can be
particularly useful. It is also worth educating the family that such anxieties are more
likely to return when there is increased stress. Being aware of this can help identify the
problem earlier and enable the young person and family to use previously learnt
interventions to prevent escalation. It is common for such problems when they have
resolved to return in periods of transition.
KEY POINTS

• Separation anxiety usually has a long history.
• There is often a strong history of anxiety in the family which may necessitate family
therapy and/or family work.

• Coping and resilience need to be encouraged in an empowering way.

CASE 84:

SOILING BEHIND SOFA

History
An 11-year-old boy is presented with soiling in different places throughout the house, for
example, in the living room behind the sofa. He has been doing this for some years but
the situation has recently worsened. He also wets at night and urinates in inappropriate
places. He does not appear to be wet during the day.
The boy is currently in temporary foster care while his future care is planned. He was
removed from his mother’s care because there was some concern over whether she could
meet his emotional needs after several episodes of emotional abuse and neglect. She
herself has a moderate learning disability.
The mother had an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery with the boy. However, when
he was only a few days old his father left. His mother has always struggled to care for
him. His development was initially delayed but he had a spell in care during which he
made rapid gains. However, as his mother was said to have benefited from some
parenting work he was returned to her care. His supervision by her has been very variable
and he has often had to fend for himself. Attendance at school has been variable, but
when at school he has shown a mistrust of adults and a tendency to be aggressive with
his peers.

Mental state examination and physical examination
He is a wary boy who makes fleeting eye contact but then looks away. He does not
willingly engage in questions related to the soiling but will answer questions about more
general issues. He is somewhat small for his age.
Physical examination shows he has a small abdominal mass, and rectal examination and
abdominal X-ray show that he is constipated.

Question
• How would you manage this situation?

215

ANSWER 84
Differential diagnosis would include constipation and anal fissure causing retention and
leading to a vicious cycle of bowel loading and dysfunction. However, the deliberate
soiling and the history suggest emotional and behavioural disturbance. Attachment
problems are likely given the history of current neglect and history of abuse. It is possible
that the extent of abuse is more than has been discovered. Rare physical causes like short
loop Hirschprung’s disease if considered, would require referral to a paediatrician. This
would be sensible if constipation is ongoing. The smearing is not likely to be organic, but
physical and psychological causes can coexist. In many respects the behaviour represents
maladaptive coping strategies.

!

Medical causes for faecal soiling
These include functional constipation and faecal retention anorectal lesions that
make defecation painful, neurological causes, bowel disease, endocrine or
metabolic causes.

Encopresis (involuntary soiling) is more likely to occur in boys than girls. It tends to
improve with age and is relatively uncommon after age 16. Most children with encopresis
have learnt to control their bowels, but for various reasons lose this ability and develop
secondary encopresis.
Management will usually begin with treatment of any constipation and reinstatement of
an effective training strategy with support for the carers. Cognitive behaviour therapy
(CBT) and contingency strategies are useful. However, any underlying psychiatric disorder
will need to be treated or managed (such as counselling for past abuse) although this can
be more difficult the older the child is. It is also important to be aware that encopresis
may lead to scapegoating, anxiety and low self-esteem. Addressing these will also need
to be part of the overall management strategy. The initial treatment can begin
immediately and supporting treatments can be undertaken simultaneously. Child
protection issues need to be reviewed, particularly as these behaviours may represent a
‘flag’ for emotional or family disturbance that needs to be addressed.
KEY POINTS

• Faecal smearing should alert professionals that there may be child protection issues
to consider.

• Treatment of the constipation will not be sufficient.

216

CASE 85:

SHE WON’T SAY ANYTHING AT SCHOOL

History
A 10-year-old girl is brought to her general practitioner by her mother. Her mother says
that she has always been shy, but her school reports that she has not spoken in class for
several months. She comes from a close-knit family and she has grandparents as well as
uncles, aunts and cousins living near by. Her mother reports that she chats happily with
them all and with the nuclear family. She is the eldest of two girls and her sister is
reported as having no problems. Her father is reported as being a shy, ‘reserved’ man who
works for a gas production company.
At school she has one close friend who she plays with at playtime (including observed
imaginative play) but no other real friends. In class, when the teacher asks her a question
she remains silent and looks so uncomfortable that the teachers have taken to avoiding
asking her questions. She will happily get on with her work and follows instructions. She
does not have any significant learning difficulties that the school are aware of and gets
‘average’ marks in most subjects.
Her mother says that she has not had any illnesses or symptoms recently that she is
concerned about. She has been sleeping and eating well. She takes a packed lunch to
school and it is always finished.

Mental state examination
She comes into surgery with her mother but does not look at the doctor very much and
remains silent, even when directly asked straightforward questions. She does not smile
and her facial expression is neutral. She is smartly dressed, with neat, clean hair in a pony
tail. She shows no signs of restlessness, agitation or slowness of movements. She is
reported as being happy and chatty at home. Her mother reports no unusual or strange
behaviour recently, and she is not distracted or responding to voices. She has no outward
signs of illness.
Questions
• What possible causes are there?
• What further questions would you ask to exclude potential causes?
• How might she be treated?

217

ANSWER 85
The most likely cause is elective mutism (sometimes called selective mutism). This is
where a child selectively withdraws speech from one setting in their life. It is not
uncommon for this to be at school. However, it is important to exclude other causes of
loss of speech including brain injury, epilepsy or encephalitis. These are unlikely given
the history but you would ask about fits, faints, dizzy spells, headaches, vomiting, loss of
power or sensation, fever and other intercurrent illnesses. Autism spectrum disorders
should be considered since conversational reciprocity problems are common in those with
Asperger syndrome. Further questions about social, imaginative and communicative skills
will be important as will questions about the ability of the 10-year-old to empathize with
others (for example, when they are hurt, ill or upset). Depression and psychosis should be
excluded as should obsessive-compulsive disorder, all of which can lead to withdrawal of
speech. A post-traumatic reaction must also be excluded since the research has shown
that children who have been abused can become mute in some or all settings. Getting to
know the family, including a home visit, can give clues about this. If you have concerns
then local children’s social services keep registers of concerns raised about children by
other professionals and this may give you further information. A referral to a child
mental health professional (child psychiatrist or child psychologist) seems likely and they
would be able to explore this problem further in individual or family work.
Many children, however, seem to develop this condition without any specific trauma, and
it is likely that genetics and temperament play a part. A situational silence may occur
over a period of time in the context, for example, of embarrassment. This can then
become a habit that forms and is difficult to break.

!

Criteria that establish diagnosis of elective mutism

• Absence of speech in a certain area of life (for example, school) that goes on for
at least one month.

• Interference with educational or social functioning.
• The problem is not as a result of anxiety about using a foreign language or about a
speech impediment, and is not as a result of another mental illness such as psychosis,
an autism spectrum disorder, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Treatment should be instituted as early as possible, as the longer the problem continues
the more difficult it may be to achieve improvement. The main treatment is
desensitization. This can involve the environment, the people or the communication type.
For example, the environment in which a child speaks may be gradually extended.
Similarly, if the child regularly talks to another person (for example, a sibling)
desensitization may introduce other people into that situation (for example, a best friend
initially and so on). Finally, the communication type may be changed to give the child a
range of new communicative experiences (for example, using texting, instant messaging
on a computer, email etc.) Sometimes family work may help although this needs to be
done with some skill, since over-focus on the symptom can reinforce it, and so many
clinicians may focus on other goals such as establishing new friendships or developing
confidence, rather than the mutism. A focus on developing confidence through
achievement can also lead to benefits.
KEY POINTS

• Exclude other potential causes.
• Treat early to prevent the problem becoming entrenched.

CASE 86:

TICS AND CHECKING BEHAVIOUR

History
A 10-year-old boy is brought to the GP by his father. His father describes that his son has
developed facial grimacing and tics 6 weeks ago having not had them before this. At the
same time he has started checking things in the house. For example, he checks the back
door is locked repetitively in the evenings. He also repetitively touches radiators in every
room over and over again. He becomes irritable if it is mentioned. It is taking him longer
to get ready for school and at bedtime, apparently because he is following routines and
repeating them. He is also more lethargic recently and needs more sleep. The boy himself
cannot explain why he needs to do these things, and says that he can’t help the
movements. His father says that he was well until 6 weeks ago and before this none of
these behaviours were present. He says that he was very ill with a sore throat and fever
8 weeks ago and had a week off school. He has not had time off school for several years
prior to this. His father wonders if the illness has unsettled his routine or whether there
is something bothering him at school although the boy himself says that he has no
worries about school. He has a number of friends. His father says that he himself used to
have a blinking tic when he was about 8 or 9 and he grew out of it.
You do not carry out an examination, but note that the boy has facial tics regularly
throughout the meeting that involve spasms of the neck and blinking, as well as some
facial grimacing. He is slightly anxious to be seeing you, but no more than many boys
you see.

Question
• What do you think is going on?

219

ANSWER 86
Transient tic disorder (regular tics that have been present for less than 12 months) is
common in children and young people and will often burn itself out with time. It usually
involves blinking or jerking of the head and the advice to family and teachers is not to
focus too much attention on it and to reassure the child that it will go away of its own
accord. Worry from parent or child drives negative or anxious interactions that at best
don’t help and at worst may make things worse. A family history of tics is common.

!

Definitions

• A simple tic is a sudden movement of discrete muscle groups that repeats itself at

•

•
•

intervals. A phonic tic is the same involving sounds. Complex motor tics involve
more muscle groups. The definitions of complex motor tics and stereotypies blur
into each other.
A stereotypy is a complex integrated set of movements such as body-rocking.
It may be present more in certain emotional states such as excitement or anxiety,
and occur more often (although not exclusively) in people with learning
disabilities and autism spectrum conditions.
A mannerism is a functional movement carried out in an atypical or unusual way.
A compulsive movement is an internal desire to do something, often initially
resisted, and it may be repetitive, as the compulsive cycle repeats itself.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder should be considered. The infection at the outset of this
boy’s problems may be important, since this young person has no history of these
problems. Consider PANDAS (paediatric autoimmune neuro-psychiatric disorders
associated with Streptococcus). This is a rare autoimmune mediated response to group A
beta haemolytic streptococcal infection that is associated with pharyngitis following
acute onset of obsessions and compulsions and/or tics with relapsing and remitting
symptoms including emotional lability, anxiety, ritualized behaviours, oppositional
behaviours, and sometimes movement problems such as overactivity or lethargy.
The presence of obsessive or compulsive phenomena may require child mental health
service involvement. In the first instance some cognitive behavioural treatment would be
appropriate with follow-up. If this is ineffective then a serotonin reuptake inhibitor
should be considered. For severe PANDAS some clinicians have suggested use of
immunoglobulins, or penicillin prophylaxis to prevent exacerbations during future
streptococcal infections, but there have been no randomized controlled trials to test
these treatments.
KEY POINTS

• PANDAS (paediatric autoimmune neuro-psychiatric disorders associated with
Streptococcus) is a rare association between streptococcal infection and an autoimmune
response leading to obsessions, compulsions and tics.

220

CASE 87:

NOT EATING, MOVING OR SPEAKING

History
You are called to see a 13-year-old girl who has been bed-bound for a week. Her parents
are frantically worried because she has not been speaking or moving at all for the last
two days. She has not eaten anything for two days although she will drink from a baby
cup regularly. You have seen her previously in your general practice surgery and referred
her to a paediatrician 2 months ago. She was admitted and investigated after a 6-month
history of fatigue, occasional muscle and body aches. After 6 days in hospital she was
discharged with a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and referred to a CFS
service that involved her seeing a paediatric community nurse together with a child
clinical psychologist. The psychologist was unable to uncover any hidden stresses or
symptoms of serious mental illness. She has seen the psychologist once and the
community nurse has visited three times. They had set up a diary to record baseline
activities, movements and sleep–wake cycles, but the situation continued to relentlessly
deteriorate. Prior to this she has not complained of headaches or loss of speech, vision,
power or sensations. The history taken shows that she was not low in mood. Six months
ago she was attending secondary school, and had a best friend (although not a wide
group of friends). She has been teased at school in the past and she has been described
by her parents as ‘a bit on the perfectionistic side’. She is bright and near the top of the
class in many subjects. Her father works for a government organization and spends a lot
of time away from the family home, and her mother is a caring and kind woman known
to the practice because she visits old people in the area as a befriender.
Mental state examination
She is lying very still in bed with her eyes closed. When you speak she grimaces and
shouts, but forms no words. The curtains are drawn and her mother says that she cries
out if the curtains are opened. She is not dehydrated. Her pulse is 68/min and her blood
pressure is 105/62 mmHg. She makes certain noises to communicate that she is thirsty
and her mother can recognize these. They involve breaths and simple noises and grunts.
Physical examination
Her tone and reflexes are all normal. She has no neck stiffness. There are no unilateral
signs. Pupils are reactive, equal and fundi are healthy. Her skin looks healthy and she is
not dehydrated. It is not possible to weigh her.
INVESTIGATIONS
There are no new investigations available, but a very comprehensive screen on her
previous admission showed normal full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver
function tests, thyroid function tests, blood sugar, calcium and phosphate. Serology for a
range of rare viruses and other agents showed no apparent active infection.

Questions
• What do you think is going on?
• What do you need to do?

221

ANSWER 87
It is important to think broadly at this point. She may have a physical illness that has not
yet been diagnosed. The tests suggest that this is not hypothyroidism, anaemia or a severe
infective illness, although further investigations are warranted given the severity of the
symptoms. Meningitis or encephalitis are possibilities, although again unlikely given the
history, investigations and clinical course. She has no neck stiffness or history of
headaches. Cancer is another rare cause and occasionally children with brain tumours or
other rare cancers may present in unusual ways, although this has not been picked up in
her recent admission. The severity of the symptomatology means that an MRI scan is
advisable after assessment by a paediatrician or paediatric neurologist.
You should consider a severe depressive illness given the severity of withdrawal. There
may be an unknown trauma or stressor in this girl’s life that is not so far uncovered.
Obtain a clearer picture of mood and coping at home and school. A psychotic illness
while possible is exceptionally rare in a 13-year-old. Ask about symptoms such as
hallucinations, delusions or thought passivity experiences that she might have described
to parents. Occasionally children who are having panic attacks may withdraw into
themselves, as can children who have experienced severe trauma such as witnessing
murder or abuse or experiencing abuse, rape or severe bullying.
Pervasive refusal syndrome (described in a paper by Bryan Lask)* is a term that has come
into wide usage to describe children who have no other physical or mental health illness
but cannot move or speak, and often refuse to eat or drink. This is thought to be a type
of conversion disorder. The theory is that it is not feigned illness but a bodily response
to severe stress, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. Some have
questioned the use of the term ‘refusal’ in this context given that it is not thought to be
entirely volitional. There are however known to be psychological, physiological and
behavioural aspects to the syndrome and a biopsychosocial model of understanding and
treatment is thought to be the best approach.
In this girl the severity of symptoms and the rapid deterioration means that admission
under the paediatricians is the most sensible course of action. This allows for a multidisciplinary assessment including paediatrics, nursing care, the child mental health team,
physiotherapy, dietician and if available a paediatric neurologist. A full psychiatric
assessment is advisable. The multidisciplinary team can put together a coordinated
rehabilitation plan. This would involve identifying domains, establishing a baseline and
then planning the rehabilitative path.

!

222

Key interventions will be to prevent the serious effects of profound immobility (for
example, contractures, pressure sores, intestinal and venous stasis, muscle wasting) and
to establish the conditions for gradual and healthy recovery. Identifying psychological or
systemic factors that help shape family-based supportive therapy will also help.
KEY POINTS

• Pervasive refusal syndrome is a complex disorder. It is not an ICD-10 diagnosis and
research continues into the mechanisms at play.

• Similar presentations may attract a range of diagnostic labels depending on the
•

preference of local clinicians, and this can hamper a unified approach to treatment
(for example, encephalitis lethargica, severe CFS/ME, post-viral fatigue).
Treatment is best planned by considering a multifactorial formulation including
physical, psychological, systemic and social factors.

CASE 88:

ATTACHMENT DISORDER

History
A 6-year-old boy presents with his foster carer. The boy immediately approaches you and
is over familiar. He wants to sit on your knee and is keen to engage with you in rough
and tumble type play. He has been with his foster carer for 6 weeks having been removed
from his family because of ongoing child protection concerns. The foster carer reports
that in some ways he is an easy child to manage as he seems to take things in his stride
but his poor concentration and attention may make it difficult for him to learn basic
skills.
Mental state examination
He is an overactive lad and struggles to sit still. He cannot focus on anything for more
than a few minutes. He is physically inappropriate wanting to hug you and other staff
and patients that he has only just met. He has no qualms about approaching strangers
and talking to them. He is cheerful and joins in other people’s activities without waiting
for an invitation. He fidgets during his physical examination but is generally cooperative
although needs to be coaxed to stay on task.
His speech is not easy to understand. He struggles with undressing and dressing himself.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would the situation be managed?

225

ANSWER 88
The differential diagnosis is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, attachment disorder, abuse
and neglect, adjustment disorder, global learning disability or an autism spectrum disorder.
Broadly there are two types of attachment disorder identified. Disinhibited attachment
disorder refers to children who do not develop a preferred attachment figure and who will
go off with strangers. They classically have problems with emotional regulation. They are
indiscriminate about who they form ‘attachment’ to and inappropriately friendly with
everyone, showing little wariness. Social interactions are also poorly modulated.
Disinhibited attachment disorder is a diagnosis not often made, partly because of lack of
clarity about it. Some of these children may be withdrawn with poor social skills and
autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) may need to be excluded.

!

Attachment disorders/detachment patterns
Attachment disorders are diagnostic categories (for example, ICD-10 classification
system) and not the same as attachment patterns. The latter are classifications of
infant responses to the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test*, which categorizes
attachments as secure, insecure (avoidant or ambivalent) disorganized.
*Ainsworth M (1978) Patterns of Attachment: a psychological study of the strange situation.
Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.

Children with insecure attachment on testing, especially disorganized attachment are at
significant risk of later emotional and behavioural problems. Many children who do not
form secure attachments may be institutionalized or have a lack of consistent care.
However, attachment disorder may also be present when primary care givers have
suffered from adverse perinatal events. It is important that attachment disorder is not
diagnosed without understanding the context as attachment is a two-way process.
Children will show developmentally inappropriate social relationships and may also
present as having anxious relationships with caregivers and/or disinhibited behaviour
(behavioural problems, inattention, poor concentration, aggression) or asocial behaviour
(lack of empathy or ability to see another perspective) in which attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder or autistic spectrum disorder may be mistakenly diagnosed.
Learning disability may also need to be excluded as children who demonstrate
friendliness to strangers may be doing so because they do not understand the contexts
for different social relationships.
There will be no need to manage this acutely apart from raising the carer’s awareness.
The carer should discuss the situation with the child’s social worker as they may benefit
from further assessment. Treatment involves good ongoing parenting. Many specialist
teams and looked after children support teams use attachment models to advise parents
about how to nurture and develop healthy attachments, and these are currently being
researched. Given this child’s lack of wariness he may be particularly vulnerable to abuse
and clear advice about protection needs to be given to carers, school and social services.
KEY POINTS

• Attachment disorder can occur in any family but is most likely where there has been
poor child care or poor maternal mental health.

• Children with attachment disorder often show behaviours that may be mistaken for
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

CASE 89:

TANTRUMS

History
A 7-year-old boy is taken to the general practitioner because he is having regular and
severe temper tantrums. His mother explains that this has been going on for 3 months. It
has gradually become worse to the point where he can be screaming for an hour every
evening. It usually occurs when he has been asked to do something that he does not want
to do, such as getting ready for bed. When asked if he has always been a difficult child,
his mother explains that he used to be more biddable, although he has always had a
strong character. His 5-year-old sister by contrast has always been placid. His father used
to deal with difficult behaviour by clear and firm instructions. He had a close bond with
his father, with whom he went fishing. His parents split up four and a half months ago.
His father had an affair with a woman from work, and while he initially stayed in the
house there were frequent and loud arguments, usually once the children had gone to
bed. He then left to live with the other woman, a divorcee with one 15-year-old boy. He
has had his son to stay on one occasion, but has refused to have him back because of
severe tantrums. The 7-year-old boy has also been tearful, eating poorly and having some
nightmares. There is no wetting, soiling or destruction of property, although he has been
sent home from school on three occasions in the last 3 weeks, once because of a fight
with another child and twice with tummy aches.
Questions
• What is the most likely cause of the boy’s problems?
• What is the main intervention?

227

ANSWER 89
Tantrums are developmentally normal for children aged 2, 3 and 4. They usually occur in
the context of the development of the child’s empathy skills (known to psychologists as
theory of mind), their place in the world and a struggle to understand that their needs
cannot be prioritized at all times.
Tantrums that persist at older ages or are severe and prolonged in nature often lead to
families requiring additional support. While this is not an illness as such, the World Health
Organization does categorize behaviour that is extreme in terms such as oppositional
defiant disorder (ODD) for milder versions and conduct disorder (CD) for more severe
problems that significantly impact on social, educational and family functioning. Severe
and frequent tantrums can be part of both of these alongside other behaviours. The WHO
lists 23 behaviours that it considers part of this spectrum of behaviour disorders. ODD
describes a configuration of the milder of these behaviours including refusal to comply with
requests, tantrums, blaming of others and other similar behaviours. CD listed behaviours
include stealing, running away from home, use of a weapon and cruelty to animals.
However, tantrums can also be understood in terms of adjustment with disturbance of
emotions and behaviour in the context of a significant stressor. The stressor in this
circumstance is likely to be the disagreements and subsequent acrimonious separation of
his parents. It is always important to ask about what is going on in a child’s life when
they are presented with behaviour problems.
Adjustment disorder usually occurs with significant impairment to social functioning and
this is the case here. It usually begins within 3 months of the onset of the stressor and
remits within 6 months of the stressor being removed. Many children do adjust to the
separation of their parents but it takes time and patience.
The main intervention for the child is likely to be loving relationships with both parents.
This means re-establishing a routine, giving the child a place in the lives of both parents
and avoiding the ‘triangulation’ of the child where parents criticize each other, ask the
child to spy or compete for the love of their child by abrogating themselves from their
parental responsibilities or replacing emotional care with material rewards. Many parents
realize this for themselves. Some parents are caught up in the acrimony and need support.
This can come from parenting support services, family centres, Relate or child mental
health service professionals. These would all focus on giving the individuals in the
situation a voice and recognizing their distress while promoting coping.
Medication is not recommended in this type of situation. The parents should be
encouraged to keep the acrimony and disputes to times when the children are at school,
and sort things out as best they can. It may help to advise the parents to explain to the
teacher what is going on. Good parenting practice such as clear boundaries, calmness,
positive approaches (for example, positive reinforcement of good behaviours and
modelling of good behaviours) and consistency are key.
KEY POINTS

• Adjustment disorder is common and should always be considered when there are
sudden, severe or recent changes in a child’s behaviour.

• It is important not to pathologize the child, but to recognize the difficult process they are
going through and try and establish supportive systems that promote coping.

228

CASE 90:

GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER

History
The mother of an 8-year-old boy presents with concerns that her son keeps saying he
wants to be a girl. She states that he has always preferred to participate in ‘feminine’
activities such as playing with dolls, interested in dressing up and playing with make-up.
He has been doing well academically but has started having more problems with peers
because they tease him about his liking for activities they see as ‘sissy’. He much prefers
playing with girls but sometimes bothers them because he insists he is one of them. He
has quite a few effeminate mannerisms and he is often seen trying to copy female gaits
and swinging his hips. The family had noticed aspects of these behaviours when he was
younger but thought he would grow out of it.
His parents argue about whether anything needs to be done or not but his behaviour is
increasingly impacting on many areas of his life. His father is also worried that they have
caused him to become gay and feels that he has failed as a father. At times he accuses
his wife of having babied him and caused the problem. They have two other children, a
boy aged 11 and a girl aged 13. The boy is embarrassed by his brother and they rarely
play together. His sister finds him interested in her clothes and make-up. She is mainly
tolerant but can be irritated if he is too intrusive. She worries about the teasing and
bullying her younger brother is subjected to.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How would you manage the situation?

229

ANSWER 90
Gender identity is a person’s basic sense of self as male or female and is generally
consistent with biological sex. Gender role identity is a person’s self-designation as
masculine or feminine. Gender role is a person’s behaviour, attitudes and traits that
are designated by a particular society in a particular context and time as being male
or female.
Clarify the behaviours that cause concern and whether the child has any worries or
concerns. It is important not to make the child feel guilty for how they feel. The
behaviours may present as early as toddler age when the child may show a preference for
the opposite sex activities. This may also manifest by choice of toys, fantasy roles
assumed in dressing up, choice of name and type of clothing. The child may also
verbalize a desire to be of the opposite sex. Boys tend to be referred to services more often
than girls.
A majority of the children who present with such behaviour will not be transgendered
and surgery before the age of 18 is not an option in the UK. In fact, most such desires
fade as children get older, hence the need not to make children feel that there is
something wrong. Many children are simply exploring their identity and societal roles.
Some, when followed up to early adulthood, will be homosexual or bisexual in
orientation. For those where there is family distress or personal distress, support may be
required and child mental health services are geared up to provide this. In some the
behaviours or feelings are short-lived, especially when they are related to a liking for
specific toys (for example, dolls) rather than any desire to be a different gender.
The approach to the boy discussed here would involve listening to the mother’s concerns
and providing her with the relevant information. She and the boy’s father and other
family members may also need advice about how they manage the boy’s behaviours.
Arguments and blame of others or self are common as the family struggle to understand
the situation. Work with the parents may allow them to move away from blame. Some
services recommend support groups. Avoid the pathologizing of the child. Long-term
psychotherapy is usually not appropriate at this age since it implies a problem.
Reassurance that it does not mean anything is best avoided.
KEY POINTS

• Gender identity dysphoria is not common but it can prove distressing to the family and
young person.

• It is important not to dismiss concerns but also important not to predict outcomes.

CASE 91:

BLOOD IN THE URINE OF A HEALTHY GIRL

History
A 6-year-old girl is brought to see the general practitioner by a single mother, who also
works in an old people’s home as a care assistant. The child’s mother is holding a jam jar
containing deeply red urine. The mother explains that her daughter has been passing
bright red urine for the last week. She says that she has been screaming in pain when on
the toilet. She also describes high temperatures.
A check in the notes reveals that the mother has presented the child 44 times in the last
year, and while many of the visits have been for colds and other minor ailments for which
there has been evidence, there have been numerous occasions when the doctor has been
unable to find anything wrong.
In the past she came to the surgery with her mother reporting fits when she was aged
five. These were investigated extensively by the paediatricians. Mother reported them
happening 5–10 times per day at home, but during a 3-day admission for investigation
none were seen by any staff. Enquiry of school also revealed no evidence of fits. Her
mother failed two appointments with the paediatrician and subsequently told the GP that
she had not attended because the fits had stopped and had not re-occurred since.

Physical examination
The girl sits quietly on her mother’s knee and makes no eye contact with the doctor. She
is happy to be examined with her mother present. She has no abdominal or loin
tenderness. Her temperature, pulse and blood pressure are normal and clinically she is not
dehydrated, malnourished or anaemic.

INVESTIGATIONS

• The urine supplied in the jar has the maximum positives of blood, but no nitrites.
• No other investigations are to hand at this point.
Questions
• What possible diagnoses should you consider?
• What action should you take?

231

ANSWER 91
It is important not to jump to conclusions. She may have a urinary tract infection
although it is puzzling that she has no fever or bladder or loin tenderness given the large
amount of blood seen. Painless haematuria is usually of concern and always warrants
further investigation. There may be a neoplastic lesion in the renal tract although the
mother did describe pain on micturition, which is at odds with the examination. This will
need referral to a paediatrician.
Another possibility is feigned symptomatology, in this case by the mother. This is another
good reason for review by a paediatrician. The term Factitious Disorder by Proxy is used
in DSM-IV and is sometimes called Munchausen by Proxy, although this term is only ever
used cautiously in clinical practice since accusation without evidence may lead to
litigation. It refers to a parent or carer presenting a child with symptoms that have been
fabricated by the parent. This may be an attempt by the adult to elicit benefit or care for
themselves or to harm the child, and is usually an example of both physical and
emotional abuse.

This is not an exhaustive list.

This is different from an anxious parent who exaggerates a child’s symptom in order to
raise the level of concern in the doctor for the benefit of the child. Factitious disorder by
proxy is often associated with a personality disorder in the parent, where they are
prioritizing their own needs over those of the child, and often putting the child at risk.
This is a clear example of child abuse and would prompt a referral through the local child
protection system.
Keep very good notes of consultations, signed and dated. Discuss with a paediatrician
and/or the child protection team if your concerns are raised. Use the Common Assessment
Framework. In confirmed cases the child needs protecting and the parent needs treatment.
232

KEY POINTS

• Make very good notes of history and presentation.
• Refer to a paediatrician alerting them of your concerns.
• An admission may be warranted. While it may be what the parent wants, it affords a
degree of protection for the child and allows more comprehensive assessment.

• If you have any evidence of abuse or have suspicion of abuse then follow your local
•

child protection policy. One element of this would involve notifying your local child
protection (safeguarding) team.
Know your local child protection policy.

CASE 92:

CHILD PROTECTION

History
You see a 13-year-old girl for a sprained ankle. As you are examining her, she asks if you
can prescribe the contraceptive pill for her. She tells you she has been in a relationship
with a 35-year-old man for nearly two months. The relationship has had some sexual
activity already, but she now feels ready for full intercourse. Her ‘boyfriend’ is reluctant
to use condoms, hence her request.
Her family background is that her parents are divorced with father having left the family
some five years ago. She lives with her mother and her mother’s partner of four years.
She also has a brother aged 11 and a half sister aged 2. Her ‘boyfriend’ is a friend of her
mother’s partner. She does not want her mother to know about the relationship as she
feels her mother will be jealous of her. Her ‘boyfriend’ has asked her to keep the
relationship secret so that it will be more special for them. She feels that as you are her
doctor, you are also obliged to keep her information confidential.

Mental state examination
She has a swollen ankle but nil else of note. She looks slightly older than 13 and is
wearing some make-up. Her dress is casual and appropriate for her age.
Questions
• What would be your concern with this case?
• How would you manage this situation?

235

ANSWER 92
This girl is clearly being sexually abused by the so-called boyfriend. The fact that he is
35 suggests that the relationship is not consensual and she has probably been ‘groomed’.
As well as being at risk of sexual abuse, there is a need to consider how she is being
parented and whether she is being adequately protected.
It is important that you neither jump to conclusions nor dismiss what she is saying. You
need to ensure that you have understood what she has disclosed but do not interrogate
her or ask leading questions. Make good, clear contemporaneous records.
Every hospital and locality has an agreed multi-agency child protection policy, which will
clearly outline how this situation should be managed. The principles of them all will be
the same but they may differ in some of the details.
It is important to let the girl know that you are legally obliged to share your concern
regarding her safety. This means breaking her confidentiality and telling the local child
protection team. If she had said that she would share information with you based on a
promise by you not to share the information, you would have to say that you cannot
accept the condition. While it may prevent disclosure it also prevents you having to break
your word which you would be legally obliged to do. It is important to explain to the girl
the action you are taking and the reason for it. There is a need to identify whether there
is an immediate risk to her or not and also how her disclosure is shared with her mother.
As the maternal response may be difficult to predict it would be more appropriate to
discuss the case with a senior colleague and with social services and take their advice.
Adults who abuse one child are likely to abuse others. You would not notify the alleged
abuser in such circumstances (even if it were a parent). You would leave this to the
experienced child protection team.

!

Circumstances when confidentiality can or should be broken

• When there is a need to protect someone from themselves, for example, a child
who is self-harming.

• When there is a need to protect a third party because of potential harm from the
•
•
•
•

patient to the third party (there may be a need to inform the third party and/or
police).
When someone is being abused (physical, sexual or emotional) or there is a risk of
this.
When someone is abusing a child.
When legally obliged to do so.
At all times, the user is fully and honestly informed if any such action is considered.

KEY POINTS

•
•
•
•

236

As a doctor, you are legally obliged to comply with child protection processes.
It is justifiable (and essential) that you break confidentiality if a child is at risk.
Don’t dismiss what is said but don’t jump to conclusions either.
Don’t interrogate the child. The police are likely to want to collect evidence through a
formal interview.

CASE 93:

HE DOESN’T PLAY WITH OTHER CHILDREN

History
A 4-year-old boy is brought to the general practitioner by his mother. The nursery school
has suggested she bring him and ask for an autism assessment. The mother is distressed.
This is their first child and they have no nephews or nieces to compare him with. The
nursery school say he sits on his own and bangs toys together. In the home corner he
piles things up on top of each other but does not enter into the role play that some of the
other children enjoy. His mother describes that he has always preferred to play on his own
if other children are around. He also has a fascination for things that spin such as fans
and carwashes, and sometimes he will pick up pieces of string, paper or plastic and twirl
them in his fingers, watching intently. When excited he jumps up and down on his toes
or flaps his hands.
Examination
In the surgery he stands in front of the GP and types on the keyboard of the computer
repetitively. He makes no eye contact with the GP throughout the 20 minutes he is there.
After a while he looks out the window to the car park and says ‘Mondeo’ several times.
He does not point or try to engage his parents or the GP in what he is looking at. The GP
does not consider an examination is necessary.
Questions
• Is the mother right to consider autism?
• What underlying theories are thought to explain autism?
• What should you do next?

237

ANSWER 93
This boy has enough symptoms for you to seriously consider one of the autism spectrum
conditions (ASCs), sometimes called autism spectrum disorders or pervasive
developmental disorders.
The World Health Organization Research Diagnostic Criteria require there to be 6 from 12
areas of symptomatology. There also have to be two of the first four listed. These include:

Social reciprocity problems
• Problems with the use of eye contact, reduced use of gestures in communication,
difficulty reading or using facial expressions in communication.

• Poor development of social or peer relationships and limited peer play and interactions.
• Poor ability to understand the emotions of others, understand social rules or social cues.
• Poor shared enjoyment, excitement or pleasure or engagement in the interests of others.
Imagination and language delay
• Delayed development of imaginative skills, role play and abstract thinking.
• Delayed development of language.
• Unusual or repetitive use of language including a tendency to use repetition of
words or phrases. Poor pragmatics of language use.

• Poor development of give and take in communicative interactions and poor
conversational reciprocity.

Repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour
• Preoccupations with abnormal intensity or unusual intense interests.
• Regular mannerisms or repetitive stereotyped movements or behaviours.
• Liking for routine, sameness or compulsive behaviours.
• Intense sensory interests or fears, or focus on repetitive non-functioning parts of
objects. Tendency to focus on details.
Other diagnoses that could be considered would be a neurodegenerative disorder (which
a paediatrician would exclude with a series of tests) or severe abuse (leading to a child
entering into a very isolated internal world), but this boy has a range of symptoms that
make autism by far the most likely.
Underlying theories include significant delay in theory of mind development (sometimes
called mindblindness), problems with sensory integration (weak central coherence),
executive functioning deficits, and problems with brain connectivity. Bad parenting does
not cause autism. It is now well-established that there is a strong genetic component and
research is ongoing in this area.
A referral to the local diagnosing team or paediatrician is appropriate and most areas now
have autism parent training programmes. While they do not cure autism they can lead to
improved developmental pathways for children.
KEY POINTS

• ASCs include developmental difficulties in social reciprocity skills, imagination,
language and communication, alongside repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour.

• Diagnostic interview schedules such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview (Revised
ADI-R) and the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO)
are helpful, as is the play and interaction based Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule (ADOS).

238

CASE 94:

TROUBLE IN THE CLASSROOM

A 10-year-old boy comes to the general practice surgery with his mother. His school have
indicated that he has become increasingly disruptive in class. He has two older brothers,
both of whom do well at school and have gentle and calm temperaments. Her husband
left her over a year ago. The separation was amicable and despite regular contact with
his father, she is worried that the boy is having some sort of delayed response to this.
The school’s reports have remarked that although he was always quite an excitable and
overactive child, he has been worse over the last two years. He has difficulty sitting still,
runs round the classroom, finds it difficult to concentrate and is often in trouble for
shouting out. He shouts bizarre things like ‘warthog’ and ‘blue badger did it’, often using
a different voice to his own. To a lesser degree it has been occurring on and off for years
but currently it is particularly problematic. The words he uses change over time. He may
shout ‘warthog’ in repeated outbursts over several days and then use a different phrase
such as ‘Julie’s knickers’ for several days. Sometimes the phrases are rude and upsetting
to other children and staff. He has shouted out names such as ‘stupid donkey’ and ‘big
fat witch face’ but never serious swear words.
Staff noticed that he used to rapidly nod and jerk his head, pat his lips or make kissing
noises when he was engaged in work. More recently his fidgeting involves him tapping
his foot, kicking his leg out and reaching to grab the air. He has a very pronounced
repeated blink involving much of his face.
For short periods he can control himself on request. The teachers have noticed that he
finds this difficult and is usually more disruptive afterwards with episodes of explosive
shouting and lots of rapid movements.
His mother says that his behaviour at home is similar but that until the school spoke with
her she regarded it as ‘just him’. She noted that it seemed to wax and wane according to
his mood or stressors. He previously had lots of friends but over the past year he has not
been invited to friends’ houses so frequently.

Physical examination
Physical examination is unremarkable revealing a healthy 10-year-old of average height
and weight. Neurological examination is normal. Blood pressure and heart rate are in
normal range.
Mental state examination
The boy is clean and appropriately dressed. He makes little eye contact and is fidgety. He
shouts ‘rat face beardy man’ repeatedly on two occasions. He had a further three
outbursts with high pitched squeaking noises and other sounds such as ‘meep, meep,
meep’ and squealed ‘pig, pig, pig’. His speech is otherwise normal in flow and content for
his developmental age. It is not rapid nor is there any flight of ideas. When asked to sit
down he obliges although sits on his hands and jerks his head backwards and forwards.
He says he can’t help these movements. When asked what happens if he tries to stop them
he says he can, but that he feels ‘tight’ and sometimes feels like he wants to ‘explode’
afterwards. There is no evidence of thought disorder, hallucinations or delusions.
Questions
• What is your differential diagnosis?
• What is the prognosis for this child’s problems?
• What interventions could you offer?
239

ANSWER 94
History and examination have revealed a long course with motor and vocal tics and
stereotypies, difficulties with concentration, attention, mood changes and obsessionality.
Important differentials would include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depressive disorder or complex partial seizures. This
is not conduct disorder because behaviours are different in quality from the aggressive,
destructive and deceitful behaviours that characterize it. It would be important to
consider an adjustment reaction given the breakup of his parents’ marriage. Even if not
the main cause this could be an aggravating factor to his other problems. This should be
sensitively explored.
Clues to the diagnosis come from the nature of the movements and noises. They are not
malicious and they trouble him. Simple tics are localized and brief, and produce jerking
type movements. Stereotyped movements (sometimes called complex tics) involve more
muscle groups and last longer. They can be in the motor or phonic domain. This boy is
exhibiting multiple simple (squeaks) and complex (‘rat face beardy man’) phonic tics and
multiple simple (head nodding) and complex (grabbing movements) motor tics.
Suppressibility (shown here) is a key feature of a tic and can help distinguish it from other
movement disorders.
Classification of tic disorders covers two areas: idiopathic tic disorders and neurological
disorders with tics as a symptom. The latter group includes neurodegenerative disorders
such as Huntington’s disease or Wilson’s disease, metabolic disorders such as Lesch–Nyan
syndrome, homocysteinuria and neuroacanthocytosis. Arrest or regression in cognitive
abilities would be a worrying sign that a more sinister degenerative or structural brain
lesion was implicated. Cognitive and neurological examination should be carried out
including slit lamp examination and blood tests for thyroid function, copper studies and
acanthocytes. Sinister features in addition to intellectual impairment would include: late
onset of symptoms, a progressive rather than waxing and waning course, fixed dystonias,
specific dysmorphic features (for example, indicating Fragile X or Down syndrome) and
other focal neurology.
Transient tic disorder lasts less than a year and chronic tic disorder involves chronic
multiple tics, motor or phonic but not both. Hence Tourette syndrome (TS) is the most
likely diagnosis here. TS starts before the age of 18, usually between 6 and 8 years of age.
Under-diagnosed in some cases, there is a spectrum with many milder presentations.
Tourette’s original formulation described the shouting or gesturing of obscenities
(coprolalia and copropraxia), although this is not always present. This can cause
considerable embarrassment and distress. The aetiology of TS remains unknown. Gene
linkage studies suggest it is familial in some. Basal ganglia and autoimmune aetiologies
are being researched.
The prognosis is variable, but in most is self-limiting. It can wax and wane. On average
the most severe tics occur at between 12 and 14, improving in late adolescence. Most
people with TS still have tics in adulthood although they are often not impaired by them.
A few suffer a persistent and disabling course through adulthood.
Management of TS requires time, good communication and a holistic patient and family
centred approach designed to maximize the child’s function. Reassurance is important
and information about the lack of intentionality on the child’s part. Education of family
and school can prevent secondary problems including blame, stigma and ostracization,
and minimize school disenfranchisement. Focus should be placed on improving or
240

maintaining functionality and symptoms treated accordingly. Psychological treatments
such as massed practice or habit reversal are used but may not be effective. Dopamine
blockade (for example, haloperidol and risperidone) reduces tic frequencies, but rebound
increases occur on cessation and side effects such as tardive dyskinesia after prolonged
use mean that caution is necessary.
KEY POINTS

• Tics can occur in the motor or phonic domain, are associated with a premonitory urge
and are suppressible.

• Tourette syndrome is the name often used for multiple motor and vocal tics associated
sometimes with problems of attention, concentration and obsessionality.

• Tourette syndrome is usually a self-limiting illness that requires a holistic management
approach. Education and support of families is vital and often more effective than
pharmacological interventions.

CASE 95:

RESTLESSNESS

History
A 25-year-old man with moderate learning disability comes to the accident and
emergency department. It is 10 pm at night. His parents are with him. He is agitated and
restless. He is unable to sit in the waiting area. His father explains that he had been on
olanzapine for a year after an episode of psychosis where he thought the radio was telling
him what to do, and he was hearing the ‘shopkeeper’ next door talking to him and telling
him that he was a thief and a ‘bad man’. His symptoms had abated but he had put large
amounts of weight on. His consultant psychiatrist had changed the medication to
haloperidol. There had been no recurrence of the hallucinations or delusions, but he had
become highly restless 3 days after starting them and this had got worse over the course
of the week. This involves him finding it very difficult to sit still and feeling anxious
much of the time. Prior to this he had been doing well in a supported working
environment where he works in a small team, making cardboard boxes. He has not been
aggressive or described any intent to harm himself or others.
Mental state examination
He is pacing up and down when you see him. He is also wringing his hands and has
fleeting eye contact. He will sit down, and is calm for about three minutes with a parent
gently holding a hand each, and during this time he denies hearing any noises or voices
when nobody is around, and does not hear the ‘shopkeeper’ any more. He denies any pain
and says he doesn’t feel good, but does not describe any specific symptoms. After talking
for a short time he again becomes restless. He wants to leave. He returns to pacing.
Question
• What are the possible causes of his restlessness?

243

ANSWER 95
The causes of restlessness are many and include intercurrent illness, sleep deprivation,
exhaustion or anxiety. Depression can also cause agitation as can paranoia in psychosis.
However, you have no evidence that his psychotic illness has recurred and there appears
to be a temporal relation with starting a new medication.
The most likely cause is akathisia. This involves restless movements with a subjective inner
sense of restlessness. Fidgeting, rocking or pacing may be seen. It occurs with antipsychotic
medication and to a lesser extent antidepressant medication and also in parkinsonism.
Different studies report rates between 10% and 45% in neuroleptic medication.
The best treatment is removal of the causative medication. In this man it is clear that he
needs antipsychotics. The risk of akathisia is higher in higher dosage and so reduction in
medication dose is a possibility, although in this situation it is worth returning to an
atypical antipsychotic such as aripiprazole or quetiapine, where the risk of akathisia is
lower. Some clinicians have used benzodiazepines or beta-blockers. Anticholinergic
medication has been suggested but is not usually effective.

• Seizures or reduced seizure threshold
• Agranulocytosis (particularly
with clozapine)

• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
• Flattening of affect, depression
or dysphoria

Other potential side effects of dopamine-blocking neuroleptics include dystonias, which
are prolonged and unintentional muscular contractions of voluntary or involuntary
muscles. Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism is characterized by the triad of tremor, rigidity,
and bradykinesia. It can look like Parkinson’s disease, which is caused by nigro-striatal
degeneration. Another major side effect of neuroleptics is neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(see Case 40). This involves fever, severe muscular rigidity, altered consciousness and
autonomic instability. Mortality is high if not detected and treated. Tardive dyskinesia
involves involuntary choreoathetoid movements of the mouth, head, limbs and trunk. It is
usually a side effect of long-term neuroleptic treatment and can be irreversible.
KEY POINTS

• Akathisia is a common side effect of antipsychotic medication.
• It is easily misdiagnosed as anxiety or recurrence of mental illness, and in the past was
labelled as ‘hysteria’.

CASE 96:

A MAN WITH DOWN SYNDROME IS NOT COPING

History
You are asked to see a 46-year-old man with mild to moderate learning disability and
Down syndrome. Tom lived with his elderly mother until he moved into supported
accommodation approximately two years ago. Tom shares his accommodation with
another person who has a mild learning disability. They both attend supported work
placements five days per week and have support workers who sleep over at the house
each evening and support them at weekends. The support workers are employed by
Mencap. When you meet Tom you note that he appears somewhat confused about his
whereabouts. The person who brings him to your appointment says that they have only
worked with Tom for a couple of weeks but have collected together concerns from a
number of staff which includes the following. Tom appears to be more lethargic and less
motivated. He is having difficulty coping with his supported work activity helping in the
local café. On several occasions Tom has fallen in the house, once when climbing out of
the bath.
Tom has left the house on a couple of occasions and has been found wandering around
the local shopping centre. Members of the public have expressed concern that on one
occasion he was noted to walk straight out onto a zebra crossing without checking if
there was any traffic nearby.
Tom’s sleep pattern is very erratic. He often wakes at night and insists on getting fully
dressed. Tom is complaining of abdominal pain and on a couple of occasions has been
incontinent of faeces. This is very unusual for Tom and has caused him significant
distress.

Mental state examination
Your first observations regarding Tom are that he does find it a little difficult to orientate
himself to the room and has some difficulty sitting down in his chair. His eye contact is
poor and he appears particularly anxious. You note that Tom’s verbal communication is
limited. He appears to understand what you say but generally answers with a ‘yes’ or ‘I’m
not sure’. At one point he gets very enthusiastic about a wrestling programme that he
watches regularly during the week. When you try to talk about the issues the care staff
have some concerns about, Tom denies any problems in each of the areas, simply saying
that he wants to go home. You do not observe any active response to voices or other
unusual phenomena.
Questions
• What could be the cause of some of Tom’s presenting problems?
• How would you proceed investigating these?
• Who could you involve to further ensure his safety and wellbeing?

245

ANSWER 96
People with Down syndrome have a higher incidence of physical problems including
leukaemia, thyroid disorders notably hypothyroidism, cardiac problems, chest infections,
and cataracts. Hypothyroidism may be the cause of his lack of motivation and work
problems. It could explain abdominal discomfort, constipation and overflow. People with
Down syndrome frequently experience periods of depression, particularly in middle age,
and therefore one should explore symptoms of depression. Tom will require a thorough
physical examination to exclude any physical causes that can contribute to behavioural
and psychological change (for example, cataracts). In addition, questions should be
directed at important environmental changes including loss of significant relatives,
support staff or day activities. The question of verbal, physical or sexual abuse should
always be considered and asked about in a sensitive yet thorough manner.
People with Down syndrome are highly susceptible to Alzheimer-type dementia. The
amyloid precursor protein is situated on chromosome 21. As a result of the extra
chromosome 21 there is a gradual build up in amyloid plaques and associated
neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Studies have indicated that the prevalence of
dementia in people with Down syndrome between 40 and 49 years is between 20% and
55%. All people over the age of 40 with Down syndrome are likely to have significant
numbers of amyloid plaques in the brain. The early stages of dementia are often
indistinguishable from a depressive illness. However, the functional changes described
and the changes in behaviour here are highly suggestive of early Alzheimer’s disease.
Complete a modified mini-mental state examination. Orientation in time, person and
place should be assessed as should concentration and visuo-spacial skills, although this
can be difficult in someone with limited verbal communication.
Obtain a routine blood screen including full blood count, thyroid function tests, liver
function tests, B12 and folate. Assess capacity to consent and likely compliance with the
procedure. If capacity and compliance are questioned and there is no urgent requirement
it is sensible to delay the blood test and work with significant others to develop a strategy.
This could include taking blood in a familiar environment with known people and the use
of topical anaesthesia (for example, Emla cream).
Road safety concerns highlight a possible deterioration in Tom’s ability to keep himself
safe. An assessment of risk should be undertaken and an appropriate risk management
plan devised.
Make contact with the local community learning disability team. A psychiatrist who
works with the learning disability team would investigate deterioration in skills and
cognitive functioning and assess for Alzheimer disease. Consider anti-dementia
medication following further investigations such as chest X-ray and electrocardiogram
plus further assessment by an occupational therapist to include motor processing skills.
These would be useful for a baseline measure of functioning.

CASE 97:

STRANGE BEHAVIOUR IN A PERSON WITH
DOWN SYNDROME

History
You are asked to see a 27-year-old man with Down syndrome in a group home. One of
the carers is worried that he has become more withdrawn. He has claimed that all of the
other housemates including his carers have been poisoning his food, and frequently
refuses to eat with everybody else. The carers say that he has been talking to himself
more. He has done this in the past and they have not worried about it, but recently the
quality of this has changed. He seems to be more distressed and appears to be listening
to something when there are no noises that the carer can hear. He has not been
concentrating so well on his favourite television programmes. His use of language has
also deteriorated, with more poverty in usage. He has not used any illicit substances
according to carers and drinks a bottle of beer a week on a Saturday. His carers say that
this has all emerged over the last 4 weeks and that before that he was happy, and eating
and sleeping well.
Mental state examination
His eye contact is poor and he is unsure about being in the room with you, although the
presence of his carer puts him more at ease. His opening comment to you is: ‘Are you
going to kill me with your needle?’ When you reassure him he sits still but is clearly
anxious. He is unkempt and the carer explains that he has been reluctant to wash and
has not been letting them help him with his personal hygiene. In the middle of the
meeting he repeatedly turns to his left and tearfully says ‘go away’ towards a wall on one
side of the room. When you ask him who he is talking to he begins to cry and says ‘them’,
pointing at the wall. When you ask what they are saying, he replies ‘They say I’m bad.
They say I am ugly’. You ask if he can hear them now and he nods. His carer confirms
that this is similar to experiences they have witnessed. When you ask simple questions to
elicit thought passivity or other delusions his answers are not clear and are mumbled. He
has little insight into his experiences which clearly distress him. He is orientated in time
and place.
Questions
• What possible explanations for this man’s experiences go through your mind?
• How would you manage the situation?

249

ANSWER 97
It seems likely from the history and the mental state examination that this man is
experiencing true hallucinations. He is responding to voices when there are none present
and they appear to be persecutory. He also may have some delusions about being
poisoned in his house. Given the fact that he is accusing all his housemates and his carers
there is unlikely to be any veracity to his claims. They are delusional in intensity, because
he is acting on them by refusing to eat. All of this points to a psychotic illness such as
schizophrenia. A drug-induced psychosis is unlikely as there is a good corroborative
history that he has not used drugs or excess alcohol. A schizophrenic-like psychosis is the
most likely given the hallucinations and delusions. Another possibility is a depressive
psychosis although his mood prior to the onset of the psychotic experiences appears to
have been normal. Delusional disorder would not usually be accompanied by
hallucinations. It will be important to exclude physical illness including epilepsy and a
full history, examination and systemic screen should accomplish this.
People with moderate to severe learning disabilities can develop mental illnesses in the
same way as others, and in fact are about three times more likely to suffer from
schizophrenia. Symptoms of mental illness may not be so clear cut or well-articulated,
and they can be easily missed. For example, depression may present with lack of interest,
withdrawal, tearfulness, poor energy and sleep disturbance. Schizophrenia may have less
well-defined or articulated first-rank symptoms. Dementia should also be excluded.
Management involves good use of the multidisciplinary team. The carers and family need
support to understand what is going on. It may be important to examine any recent
stressors or changes in this man’s life, such as a change in carer or housemate or family
interactions. Antipsychotic medication will need to be started and an atypical
antipsychotic would be first choice because of better side effect profiles compared to the
more traditional antipsychotics. It is important to involve the man in discussion regarding
the choice of medication and to provide accessible information. You should assess his
capacity to take medication. If it is possible to maintain this man in his current
environment then that should be considered, although if he is significantly unwell or
there is doubt about diagnosis or risk then admission may be appropriate.
KEY POINTS

• Learning disability is not a mental illness, but mental illness is more common in those
with learning disabilities.

• Mental illnesses may be more difficult to diagnose because symptoms may be less clear
cut or less well-articulated.

CASE 98:

LEARNING DIFFICULTIES, BEHAVIOUR PROBLEMS AND
REPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

History
The mother of a 19-year-old man comes to see you in general practice hoping to
understand her son’s behaviour. She discusses her son’s overactivity and behaviour
problems. When he was at school these problems were often discussed at parent evenings.
He found it difficult to concentrate during lessons. She also describes that her son can be
unpredictable. A male friend of her husband suggested that he looked ‘different’ and she
found this distressing as she had never thought this before. He had mild learning
difficulties at school and received extra help in the classroom. A teaching assistant had
wondered if he had ‘autistic traits’ but an educational psychologist dismissed this at a
school review meeting saying he could be imaginative and affectionate. She describes
how he always struggled at school, not just with his learning but with his friendships.
She says that other children avoided him perhaps because he had some unusual
behaviours. These included laughing out loud, repeating phrases and some repetitive
behaviour. He used to be very preoccupied with the film Toy Story and talked endlessly
about Woody and Buzz Lightyear who are characters in the film. When talking, he often
repeated sentences, sometimes half a sentence or even a syllable at the end of a word. He
left school at 16 and went to work with his father on the farm. His father gives him
straightforward tasks ‘because of his learning difficulties’. These include delivering food
to pigs and cows and hens every day. He is reliable with these tasks and happy, but his
father recently had a mild heart attack and his mother is worried about whether he could
hold down a job without their support.
Mental state examination
He has poor eye contact but will look at you and readily smiles at you. He seems
comfortable in your room. He is quite active, and picks things up and puts them down
without much awareness that this might not be acceptable. He doesn’t speak much but
when he does he asks you if you like Doctor Who and seems pleased when you say you
do. There is no evidence of any psychotic phenomena, anxiety or depression.
Physical examination
On observation, the GP noticed the 19-year-old’s high forehead, large head and long face.
He has large, prominent ears and on inspection, the ear cartilage is soft. He wears glasses
to correct his myopia (short-sightedness). The notes say that he has ‘mandibular
prognathism’ but this is mild. The notes have also recorded a funnel chest, or pectus
excavatum. His mother described that he has flat feet and very flexible wrists. The GP
noticed that the 19-year-old chewed his hands when seated.
Question
• What is the most likely diagnosis?

251

ANSWER 98
This man clearly has learning difficulties. His behaviours seem continuous with earlier
life and as such do not represent a deterioration, which might signal a mental illness (for
example, schizophrenia) or a physical illness (for example, a neurodegenerative disorder
or systemic illness). A learning disability is not a mental illness. Learning disabilities do
affect social, educational and occupational functioning. This family have made provision
for their son’s abilities and found a role for him in the family that is productive, provides
him with self-esteem and a role, all of which enhances his quality of life.
The differential diagnosis may also include an autism spectrum disorder or obsessivecompulsive disorder. The history and examination in this man may make you consider
the possibility of Fragile X syndrome. This is a chromosomal disorder affecting the X
chromosome. When cells are grown in a folate-deficient medium, the long arm of the X
chromosome becomes ‘fragile’ because of an expansion of CGG base pair repeats.
Women are carriers who can be mildly affected and men have the syndrome, which
results in a variable phenotype. People with Fragile X syndrome can be shy and have
learning disabilities. They may have autistic traits and sometimes a diagnosis of autism.
They often have poor eye contact. While there is a characteristic appearance with long
face and protruding ears, and sometimes large testicles, appearance can be variable.
There is no cure. This begs the question whether chromosome screening is helpful and
this should be sensitively discussed with him and his family. If he were to have children
then his sons would not have Fragile X syndrome since they receive their X chromosome
from their mother. All his daughters would be carriers however. This means that
discussion with a geneticist can be helpful.
Given that this man is happy living with his family, raising anxieties about diagnosis at
this juncture may not be that helpful, and your priority given his mother’s concerns
would be around ensuring a healthy and happy future for him. For this reason a carer
assessment may be the most appropriate. If they are not already involved then referral to
the local transition team should make sure that he and the family are receiving all the
help in terms of planning for the future that they will need.
KEY POINTS

• A learning disability is not a mental illness.
• Transition planning is essential for people with learning disabilities to make sure that
they have good planning to maintain their rights under the Disability Discrimination Act.

252

CASE 99:

MALAISE AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

History
A 45-year-old man from a group home with moderate learning disability is brought to
the accident and emergency department. He has a fever and has been reported as having
had a fit by a young care worker. She explains that he lives in supported accommodation
and she has been with him today. She has only worked there for a week. She phoned the
ambulance after she saw him shaking uncontrollably on the floor. She has phoned her
manager who is on the way to the department. She said that the four residents had been
having a small party to celebrate one of their birthdays. This man is not used to having
alcohol and he had been drinking wine. He was well before the party and was eating
heartily until he said he felt unwell. He complained of feeling ‘bad’ and ‘sick’. He was also
holding his head before he had the fit and said his head hurt. When she gave him a hug
she said that she could feel his heart pounding. She has not brought any files but says
that she knows he has seen a psychiatrist regularly, and that she was told that until about
five years ago he was on several different medications for a severe and prolonged
depressive illness, but that he has been well so far as she knows for the last few years on
medication. She does not give him his medication and is uncertain what it is. She does
not think he has epilepsy. It was not in her handover notes. His mother has died and
distant relatives only visit very occasionally. Recently she says he has been happy, doing
his usual activities and there have been no concerns about him that she knows of. When
you talk to the man himself he is alert but does not answer any of your questions. He
holds his head and cries out occasionally.
Physical examination
On examination you are able to look at the man’s fundi and see no abnormalities and no
papilloedema. His reflexes are equal although very slightly brisk bilaterally. His pulse is
100/min and his blood pressure is 140/98 mmHg.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What further information do you need?
• What is the treatment?

253

ANSWER 99
It is possible that this is a seizure in a man with learning disability. Given common
pathways of neurological involvement a person with learning disability is more likely to
have epilepsy than those without (for example, about 30% in classical autism). However
given that he has no apparent history of epilepsy it would be unusual for this to start
aged 45 unless he has some kind of neurodegenerative disorder, for which you have no
evidence. It would be prudent therefore to consider alternative options.
Seizures may be a sign of an intracranial lesion, but you have found no focal neurological
signs or papilloedema. Alcohol intoxication can drop seizure thresholds. Consider the
‘Cheese Reaction’. The history suggests that he was well until he went to a party. Since
then he has had headache, palpitations, high blood pressure and fitting, and the
symptoms have come on since he has eaten (possibly cheese?) and drunk alcohol. The
cheese reaction involves hypertensive crisis brought about by eating tyramine when on
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. This causes release of adrenaline. There is a risk of stroke
if not treated and the crisis puts a significant load on the heart leading to increased risk
of arrythmias. This man’s blood pressure needs monitoring carefully and no active
treatment is necessary while his diastolic blood pressure remains below 100 mmHg.
The treatment carries its own risks since dropping the blood pressure quickly can cause
hypoperfusion that can particularly affect the kidney, brain and heart. This man should
be admitted. Depending on the time when the cheese was ingested then oral captopril or
clonidine may be considered. If blood pressure rises precipitously then intravenous
sodium nitroprusside can be used but only under supervised conditions (for example, in
a coronary care unit).
Given that you don’t know what medication this man is taking, you should also consider
neuroleptic malignant syndrome (see Case 40). This involves pyrexia, fitting and
autonomic instability. You might expect musculoskeletal stiffness from this and it is not
present. This means it is urgent that you find out what this man’s medication is, as this
will greatly simplify the options. Make it a priority to find out. Ask the carer to contact
someone who has access to accurate up to date records, or contact the duty care
supervisor or GP for the home. Other possibilities include a panic attack but this would
not cause fitting, although high states of anxiety can provoke pseudo-seizures. However,
there is no evidence for recent high levels of stress.

!

Food containing tyramine

• Things containing protein that have been aged including:
• Cheese that has aged
• Matured meat
• Processed food
• Fermented soy products
• Dried fruit
• Avocado and aubergine (AA)
• Prunes, plums and pineapple (PPP)
• Figs, raisins, oranges and grapes (FROG)
After this episode it would be prudent to see if an alternative medication would be as
effective for this man.

254

KEY POINTS

• People taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors can react badly to food containing tyramine
(hypertensive crisis) or tryptophan (hyperserotinaemia).

• A good medication history can be crucial in helping you to plan treatment.

CASE 100:

COMPULSIVE AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR IN A
MAN WITH DOWN SYNDROME

History
A 32-year-old man with Down syndrome has lived in a group home for the last 18
months after his mother became too ill to care for him, because of diabetes, obesity and
cardiovascular disease. He has been settled there and enjoys a new job in a supermarket.
In the last month he has developed a series of compulsive behaviours including an
insistence in the kitchen that everything is in its rightful place. This was not too much of
a problem initially since he helped with clearing up after meals and did this
systematically without it negatively affecting him or the others in the home. Recently
however he has wanted to clear things away before they have been used. He has become
insistent that things remain in the same place and that people don’t move them. He also
becomes very angry when anybody else moves things. This has caused arguments in the
house and fights of a minor nature have broken out on four occasions. One of these
involved a flat mate throwing a plate of food at him. The staff have noted that he goes
around touching radiators and mirrors before he leaves the house and appears to have a
routine that he has to complete. He will sometimes go back and start at the beginning
because he has not been happy with one part of it. A new person joined the home
2 months ago and he gets on well with him.
Mental state examination
When you visit him in the home he sits on the edge of the sofa very slightly rocking back
and forwards. When you pick up a newspaper from the table and put it back again he
‘tut’s loudly and then moves it so that it is lined up with the side of the table. When you
ask him if he is happy he says he is and tells you about television programmes and
musical bands that he likes. You can elicit no evidence of psychosis. He is not responding
to voices and he does not say anything of a delusional nature to you; neither has he done
so to staff.
Questions
• What may be the problem?
• How would you treat the most likely cause of his difficulties?

257

ANSWER 100
People with learning disabilities often need extra support in life with employment,
housing and daily living. Learning disabilities are not mental illnesses, but people with
learning disabilities are more likely to have a mental illness. A learning disability is an
intellectual delay, and is often associated with syndromes or other difficulties such as
Down syndrome, which is caused by a trisomy on chromosome 21.
This man appears to have developed obsessive-compulsive disorder. This may present
slightly differently in people with learning disabilities, in that affect may be more
prominent than cognitions in the presentation. People with learning disabilities may be
able to articulate less clearly what their thought processes are in the evolution of
repetitive behaviours, but often describe a feeling of compulsion or a build up of tension.
Because of this and the learning disability the use of cognitive behaviour therapy may be
more difficult, especially if the concepts are not made explicitly clear and explained in
easy to understand ways with plenty of visual prompts and accessible information. For
this reason expertise is required to deliver therapy. It may be useful to refer the person to
a speech and language therapist for a communication assessment.
Always bear in mind that people with Down syndrome may develop dementia or
cardiovascular problems and these should be excluded as causes of any new
presentations. It will be important to look at the other potential stressors that could be
contributing to this man’s difficulties. Is he being abused or has contact with his family
declined? Has his role changed since a new person joined the house? Is work going ok or
are there additional stresses? In the first instance it may be that some interventions
geared to making sure that he feels safe and content in his daily life could settle his
symptoms. If not, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor may be helpful. They are less sedating,
less cardiotoxic and have fewer anticholinergic side effects than tricyclics; and since
people with learning disabilities may be less able or likely to report side effects they are
the treatment of choice as antidepressants as well as in OCD. It is important to assess his
capacity to consent to medication and to have clear monitoring of side effects.

!

Side effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitors

•

Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation
Loss of appetite and weight loss
Rashes
Sleep disturbance
Headache, dizziness, nervousness, anxiety, drowsiness or hallucinations
Tremor, sweating, dry mouth
Mania
A variety of other side effects (check the British National Formulary)

Anyone taking SSRIs for any significant length of time should be withdrawn from them
slowly to prevent unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.
A clear plan of support for this man would involve discussion with the family and
between professionals with agreed goals and strategies.
KEY POINTS

• People with learning disabilities are more likely to develop mental illnesses.
• Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the pharmacological treatment of choice in
depression or OCD with people who have learning disabilities.

DEDICATION

(1921-2008)
Case Files®: Emergency Medicine was the last planned book in the Clinical Case Files
series, and now is in its third edition. It is ﬁtting that we take this opportunity to
dedicate this series to the memory of a great physician, Dr Joseph A. Lucci Jr, who
has had a tremendous impact on the practice and education in medicine in Houston,
particularly at CHRISTUS St Joseph Hospital. Dr Lucci was born in Morrone del
Sannio, a province of Campobasso in Italy on August 21, 1921. “Dr Joe” arrived in
the United States in 1930 at the age of 9 years. He obtained his medical degree from
the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1946. After ﬁnishing his internship in 1947, he
served as an Air Force base surgeon in Germany. He then received residency training for 2 years at the Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital in Jersey City, New Jersey.
Upon his arrival to Houston, Dr Lucci received his further training in gynecologic
surgery at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. He was appointed as the ﬁrst academic
chair over the department of obstetrics/gynecology at St Joseph Hospital, and had
academic appointments at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, UTMB Galveston
Medical School, and later at the University of Texas Houston Medical School. During
his 31 years as academic chair, Dr Joe trained more than 100 excellent residents,
revolutionized the education of gynecologic surgery, developed innovative surgical
techniques, reduced maternal mortality to practically zero, and helped to coordinate
medical education throughout the Houston/Galveston region. He and his wife Joan
have ﬁve children: Joe, Joan Marie, Jacqueline, Regina Marie, and James, and nine
grandchildren. “Dr Joe” was academic chief emeritus of the CHRISTUS St Joseph
Hospital Obstetrics-Gynecology Residency. He has been a true pioneer in many
aspects of medicine, touching the lives of thousands of people. We are greatly indebted
to this extraordinary man and saddened by his death, which occurred peacefully on
November 21, 2008 in the presence of his entire family.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The curriculum that evolved into the ideas for this series was inspired by two talented and forthright students, Philbert Yau and Chuck Rosipal, who have since
graduated from medical school. It has been a pleasure to work with Dr Barry Simon, a wonderfully skilled and compassionate emergency room physician, and Dr
Kay Takenaka who is as talented in her writing and teaching as she is in her clinical
care. It has been excellent to have Adam Rosh join us. McGraw-Hill and I have
had the fortune to work with Adam while he was a medical student, resident, and
now an emergency medicine physician. Likewise, I have cherished working together
with my friend since medical school, Terry Liu, who initially suggested the idea of
this book. This third edition has eight new cases, and includes updates on nearly
every case. I am greatly indebted to my editor, Catherine Johnson, whose exuberance,
experience, and vision helped to shape this series. I appreciate McGraw-Hill’s
believing in the concept of teaching through clinical cases. I am also grateful
to Catherine Saggese for her excellent production expertise, Cindy Yoo for her
wonderful editing, and Ridhi Mathur for her outstanding production skills.
At Methodist Hospital, I appreciate the great support from Drs Marc Boom, Dirk
Sostman, Alan Kaplan, and Eric Haufrect. Likewise, without Debby Chambers and
Linda Bergstrom for their advice and support, this book could not have been
written. Most of all, I appreciate my everloving wife Terri, and four wonderful
children, Andy, Michael, Allison, and Christina for their patience, encouragement,
and understanding.

INTRODUCTION

Mastering the cognitive knowledge within a field such as emergency medicine is a
formidable task. It is even more difficult to draw on that knowledge, procure and
filter through the clinical and laboratory data, develop a differential diagnosis,
and finally to form a rational treatment plan. To gain these skills, the student often
learns best at the bedside, guided and instructed by experienced teachers, and inspired
toward self-directed, diligent reading. Clearly, there is no replacement for education at the bedside. Unfortunately, clinical situations usually do not encompass the
breadth of the specialty. Perhaps the best alternative is a carefully crafted patient
case designed to stimulate the clinical approach and decision making. In an attempt
to achieve that goal, we have constructed a collection of clinical vignettes to teach
diagnostic or therapeutic approaches relevant to emergency medicine. Most importantly, the explanations for the cases emphasize the mechanisms and underlying
principles, rather than merely rote questions and answers.
This book is organized for versatility: to allow the student “in a rush” to go quickly
through the scenarios and check the corresponding answers, as well as the student
who wants thought-provoking explanations. The answers are arranged from simple to
complex: a summary of the pertinent points, the bare answers, an analysis of the case,
an approach to the topic, a comprehension test at the end for reinforcement and emphasis, and a list of resources for further reading. The clinical vignettes are purposely
placed in random order to simulate the way that real patients present to the practitioner. A listing of cases is included in Section III to aid the student who desires to test
his/her knowledge of a certain area, or to review a topic including basic definitions.
Finally, we intentionally did not primarily use a multiple choice question (MCQ)
format because clues (or distractions) are not available in the real world. Nevertheless, several MCQs are included at the end of each scenario to reinforce concepts or
introduce related topics.

HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS BOOK
Each case is designed to simulate a patient encounter with open-ended questions.
At times, the patient’s complaint is different from the most concerning issue, and
sometimes extraneous information is given. The answers are organized with four
different parts.

PART I
1.

2.

Summary: The salient aspects of the case are identiﬁed, ﬁltering out the extraneous information. The student should formulate his/her summary from the
case before looking at the answers. A comparison to the summation in the answer
will help to improve one’s ability to focus on the important data, while appropriately discarding the irrelevant information, a fundamental skill in clinical
problem solving.
A straightforward answer is given to each open-ended question.

INTRODUCTION

The Analysis of the Case, which is comprised of two parts:
a. Objectives of the Case: A listing of the two or three main principles that
are crucial for a practitioner to manage the patient. Again, the student is
challenged to make educated “guesses” about the objectives of the case upon
initial review of the case scenario, which help to sharpen his/her clinical and
analytical skills.
b. Considerations: A discussion of the relevant points and brief approach to
the speciﬁc patient.

PART II
Approach to the Disease Process, which has two distinct parts:
a. Deﬁnitions or pathophysiology: Terminology or basic science correlates
pertinent to the disease process.
b. Clinical Approach: A discussion of the approach to the clinical problem in
general, including tables, ﬁgures, and algorithms.

PART III
Comprehension Questions: Each case contains several multiple-choice questions
that reinforce the material, or introduce new and related concepts. Questions about
material not found in the text will have explanations in the answers.

PART IV
Clinical Pearls: A listing of several clinically important points, which are reiterated
as a summation of the text, to allow for easy review such as before an examination.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Part 1. Approach to the Patient
Applying “book learning” to a specific clinical situation is one of the most challenging tasks in medicine. To do so, the clinician must not only retain information, organize facts, and recall large amounts of data, but also apply all of this to the patient.
The purpose of this text is to facilitate this process.
The first step involves gathering information, also known as establishing the
database. This includes taking the history, performing the physical examination,
and obtaining selective laboratory examinations, special studies, and/or imaging
tests. Sensitivity and respect should always be exercised during the interview of
patients. A good clinician also knows how to ask the same question in several
different ways, using different terminology. For example, patients may deny having “congestive heart failure” but will answer affirmatively to being treated for “fluid
in the lungs.”

CLINICAL PEARL


The history is usually the single most important tool in obtaining a diagnosis. The art of seeking this information in a nonjudgmental, sensitive,
and thorough manner cannot be overemphasized.

HISTORY
1. Basic information:
a. Age: Some conditions are more common at certain ages; for instance, chest
pain in an elderly patient is more worrisome for coronary artery disease than
the same complaint in a teenager.
b. Gender: Some disorders are more common in men such as abdominal aortic
aneurysms. In contrast, women more commonly have autoimmune problems such as chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or systemic lupus
erythematosus. Also, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered in any
woman of childbearing age.
c. Ethnicity: Some disease processes are more common in certain ethnic groups
(such as type II diabetes mellitus in the Hispanic population).

CLINICAL PEARL


The possibility of pregnancy must be entertained in any woman of
childbearing age.

2. Chief complaint: What is it that brought the patient into the hospital? Has there
been a change in a chronic or recurring condition or is this a completely new
problem? The duration and character of the complaint, associated symptoms,

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

3

and exacerbating/relieving factors should be recorded. The chief complaint
engenders a differential diagnosis, and the possible etiologies should be explored
by further inquiry.

CLINICAL PEARL


The first line of any presentation should include age, ethnicity, gender,
and chief complaint. Example: A 32-year-old white man complains of
lower abdominal pain of 8-hour duration.

3. Past medical history:
a. Major illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, reactive airway disease,
congestive heart failure, angina, or stroke should be detailed.
i. Age of onset, severity, end-organ involvement.
ii. Medications taken for the particular illness including any recent changes
to medications and reason for the change(s).
iii. Last evaluation of the condition (example: when was the last stress test
or cardiac catheterization performed in the patient with angina?)
iv. Which physician or clinic is following the patient for the disorder?
b. Minor illnesses such as recent upper respiratory infections.
c. Hospitalizations no matter how trivial should be queried.
4. Past surgical history: Date and type of procedure performed, indication, and
outcome. Laparoscopy versus laparotomy should be distinguished. Surgeon
and hospital name/location should be listed. This information should be correlated with the surgical scars on the patient’s body. Any complications should
be delineated including, for example, anesthetic complications and difficult
intubations.
5. Allergies: Reactions to medications should be recorded, including severity and
temporal relationship to the dose of medication. Immediate hypersensitivity
should be distinguished from an adverse reaction.
6. Medications: A list of medications, dosage, route of administration and frequency,
and duration of use should be developed. Prescription, over-the-counter, and
herbal remedies are all relevant. If the patient is currently taking antibiotics, it
is important to note what type of infection is being treated.
7. Social history: Occupation, marital status, family support, and tendencies toward
depression or anxiety are important. Use or abuse of illicit drugs, tobacco, or
alcohol should also be recorded.
8. Family history: Many major medical problems are genetically transmitted
(eg, hemophilia, sickle cell disease). In addition, a family history of conditions
such as breast cancer and ischemic heart disease can be a risk factor for the
development of these diseases.

4

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

9. Review of systems: A systematic review should be performed but focused on the
life-threatening and the more common diseases. For example, in a young man
with a testicular mass, trauma to the area, weight loss, and infectious symptoms are important to note. In an elderly woman with generalized weakness,
symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease should be elicited, such as chest pain,
shortness of breath, fatigue, or palpitations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. General appearance: Is the patient in any acute distress? The emergency physician should focus on the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). Note
cachetic versus well-nourished, anxious versus calm, alert versus obtunded.
2. Vital signs: Record the temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. An oxygen saturation is useful in patients with respiratory symptoms.
Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) are often placed here.
3. Head and neck examination: Evidence of trauma, tumors, facial edema, goiter
and thyroid nodules, and carotid bruits should be sought. In patients with altered
mental status or a head injury, pupillary size, symmetry, and reactivity are important. Mucous membranes should be inspected for pallor, jaundice, and evidence
of dehydration. Cervical and supraclavicular nodes should be palpated.
4. Breast examination: Inspection for symmetry and skin or nipple retraction, as
well as palpation for masses. The nipple should be assessed for discharge, and
the axillary and supraclavicular regions should be examined.
5. Cardiac examination: The point of maximal impulse (PMI) should be ascertained,
and the heart auscultated at the apex as well as the base. It is important to note
whether the auscultated rhythm is regular or irregular. Heart sounds (including
S3 and S4), murmurs, clicks, and rubs should be characterized. Systolic flow murmurs are fairly common in pregnant women because of the increased cardiac
output, but significant diastolic murmurs are unusual.
6. Pulmonary examination: The lung fields should be examined systematically and
thoroughly. Stridor, wheezes, rales, and rhonchi should be recorded. The clinician should also search for evidence of consolidation (bronchial breath sounds,
egophony) and increased work of breathing (retractions, abdominal breathing,
accessory muscle use).
7. Abdominal examination: The abdomen should be inspected for scars, distension, masses, and discoloration. For instance, the Grey-Turner sign of bruising
at the flank areas may indicate intraabdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Auscultation should identify normal versus high-pitched and hyperactive versus hypoactive bowel sounds. The abdomen should be percussed for the presence of shifting dullness (indicating ascites). Then careful palpation should
begin away from the area of pain and progress to include the whole abdomen to
assess for tenderness, masses, organomegaly (ie, spleen or liver), and peritoneal
signs. Guarding and whether it is voluntary or involuntary should be noted.

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

5

8. Back and spine examination: The back should be assessed for symmetry, tenderness, or masses. The flank regions particularly are important to assess for pain
on percussion that may indicate renal disease.
9. Genital examination:
a. Female: The external genitalia should be inspected, then the speculum used
to visualize the cervix and vagina. A bimanual examination should attempt
to elicit cervical motion tenderness, uterine size, and ovarian masses or
tenderness.
b. Male: The penis should be examined for hypospadias, lesions, and discharge.
The scrotum should be palpated for tenderness and masses. If a mass is present, it can be transilluminated to distinguish between solid and cystic masses.
The groin region should be carefully palpated for bulging (hernias) upon rest
and provocation (coughing, standing).
c. Rectal examination: A rectal examination will reveal masses in the posterior pelvis and may identify gross or occult blood in the stool. In females,
nodularity and tenderness in the uterosacral ligament may be signs of endometriosis. The posterior uterus and palpable masses in the cul-de-sac may be
identified by rectal examination. In the male, the prostate gland should be
palpated for tenderness, nodularity, and enlargement.
10. Extremities/skin: The presence of joint effusions, tenderness, rashes, edema,
and cyanosis should be recorded. It is also important to note capillary refill and
peripheral pulses.
11. Neurological examination: Patients who present with neurological complaints
require a thorough assessment including mental status, cranial nerves, strength,
sensation, reflexes, and cerebellar function. In trauma patients, the Glasgow
coma score is important (Table I–1).

CLINICAL PEARL


A thorough understanding of anatomy is important to optimally interpret
the physical examination findings.

12. Laboratory assessment depends on the circumstances:
a. CBC (complete blood count) can assess for anemia, leukocytosis (infection),
and thrombocytopenia.
b. Basic metabolic panel: Electrolytes, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen),
and creatinine (renal function).
c. Urinalysis and/or urine culture: To assess for hematuria, pyuria, or bacteruria.
A pregnancy test is important in women of childbearing age.
d. AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase for liver function; amylase and lipase to evaluate
the pancreas.

e. Cardiac markers (CK-MB [creatine kinase myocardial band], troponin, myoglobin) if coronary artery disease or other cardiac dysfunction is suspected.
f. Drug levels such as acetaminophen level in possible overdoses.
g. Arterial blood gas measurements give information about oxygenation, but
also carbon dioxide and pH readings.
13. Diagnostic adjuncts:
a. Electrocardiogram if cardiac ischemia, dysrhythmia, or other cardiac dysfunction is suspected.
b. Ultrasound examination useful in evaluating pelvic processes in female patients
(eg, pelvic inflammatory disease, tubo-ovarian abscess) and in diagnosing gallstones and other gallbladder disease. With the addition of color-flow Doppler,
deep venous thrombosis and ovarian or testicular torsion can be detected.
c. Computed tomography (CT) useful in assessing the brain for masses, bleeding, strokes, skull fractures. CTs of the chest can evaluate for masses, fluid
collections, aortic dissections, and pulmonary emboli. Abdominal CTs
can detect infection (abscess, appendicitis, diverticulitis), masses, aortic
aneurysms, and ureteral stones.

d. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps to identify soft tissue planes very
well. In the emergency department (ED) setting, this is most commonly used
to rule out spinal cord compression, cauda equina syndrome, and epidural
abscess or hematoma. MRI may also be useful for patients with acute strokes.

Part 2. Approach to Clinical Problem Solving
CLASSIC CLINICAL PROBLEM SOLVING
There are typically five distinct steps that an emergency department clinician
undertakes to systematically solve most clinical problems:
1. Addressing the ABCs and other life-threatening conditions
2. Making the diagnosis
3. Assessing the severity of the disease
4. Treating based on the stage of the disease
5. Following the patient’s response to the treatment

EMERGENCY ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
Patients often present to the ED with life-threatening conditions that necessitate
simultaneous evaluation and treatment. For example, a patient who is acutely short
of breath and hypoxemic requires supplemental oxygen and possibly intubation with
mechanical ventilation. While addressing these needs, the clinician must also try to
determine whether the patient is dyspneic because of a pneumonia, congestive heart
failure, pulmonary embolus, pneumothorax, or for some other reason.
As a general rule, the first priority is stabilization of the ABCs (see Table I–2). For
instance, a comatose multitrauma patient first requires intubation to protect the airway. See Figures I–1 through I–3 regarding management of airway and breathing issues.
Then, if the patient has a tension pneumothorax (breathing problem), (s)he needs an
immediate needle thoracostomy. If (s)he is hypotensive, large-bore IV access and volume resuscitation are required for circulatory support. Pressure should be applied to any
actively bleeding region. Once the ABCs and other life-threatening conditions are stabilized, a more complete history and head-to-toe physical examination should follow.

CLINICAL PEARL


Because emergency physicians are faced with unexpected illness and
injury, they must often perform diagnostic and therapeutic steps simultaneously. In patients with an acutely life-threatening condition, the first
and foremost priority is stabilization—the ABCs.

MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS
This is achieved by carefully evaluating the patient, analyzing the information,
assessing risk factors, and developing a list of possible diagnoses (the differential).
Usually a long list of possible diagnoses can be pared down to a few of the most likely

or most serious ones, based on the clinician’s knowledge, experience, and selective
testing. For example, a patient who complains of upper abdominal pain and who
has a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use may have peptic
ulcer disease; another patient who has abdominal pain, fatty food intolerance, and
abdominal bloating may have cholelithiasis. Yet another individual with a 1-day history of periumbilical pain that now localizes to the right lower quadrant may have
acute appendicitis.

CLINICAL PEARL


The second step in clinical problem solving is making the diagnosis.

ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE
After establishing the diagnosis, the next step is to characterize the severity of the
disease process; in other words, to describe “how bad” the disease is. This may be as
simple as determining whether a patient is “sick” or “not sick.” Is the patient with a
urinary tract infection septic or stable for outpatient therapy? In other cases, a more

10

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

formal staging may be used. For example, the Glasgow coma scale is used in patients
with head trauma to describe the severity of their injury based on eye-opening, verbal, and motor responses.

CLINICAL PEARL


The third step in clinical problem solving is to establish the severity or
stage of disease. This usually impacts the treatment and/or prognosis.

TREATING BASED ON STAGE
Many illnesses are characterized by stage or severity because this affects prognosis
and treatment. As an example, a formerly healthy young man with pneumonia and
no respiratory distress may be treated with oral antibiotics at home. An older person
with emphysema and pneumonia would probably be admitted to the hospital for IV
antibiotics. A patient with pneumonia and respiratory failure would likely be intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit for further treatment.

CLINICAL PEARL


The fourth step in clinical problem solving is tailoring the treatment to fit
the severity or “stage” of the disease.

FOLLOWING THE RESPONSE TO TREATMENT
The final step in the approach to disease is to follow the patient’s response to the
therapy. Some responses are clinical such as improvement (or lack of improvement)
in a patient’s pain. Other responses may be followed by testing (eg, monitoring the
anion gap in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis). The clinician must be prepared
to know what to do if the patient does not respond as expected. Is the next step to
treat again, to reassess the diagnosis, or to follow up with another more specific test?

CLINICAL PEARL


The fifth step in clinical problem solving is to monitor treatment response
or efficacy. This may be measured in different ways—symptomatically
or based on physical examination or other testing. For the emergency
physician, the vital signs, oxygenation, urine output, and mental status
are the key parameters.

Part 3. Approach to Reading
The clinical problem-oriented approach to reading is different from the classic “systematic” research of a disease. Patients rarely present with a clear diagnosis; hence, the
student must become skilled in applying textbook information to the clinical scenario.

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

11

Because reading with a purpose improves the retention of information, the student
should read with the goal of answering specific questions. There are seven fundamental questions that facilitate clinical thinking.
1. What is the most likely diagnosis?
2. How would you confirm the diagnosis?
3. What should be your next step?
4. What is the most likely mechanism for this process?
5. What are the risk factors for this condition?
6. What are the complications associated with the disease process?
7 What is the best therapy?

CLINICAL PEARL


Reading with the purpose of answering the seven fundamental clinical
questions improves retention of information and facilitates the application
of “book knowledge” to “clinical knowledge.”

WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY DIAGNOSIS?
The method of establishing the diagnosis was covered in the previous section. One
way of attacking this problem is to develop standard “approaches” to common
clinical problems. It is helpful to understand the most common causes of various
presentations, such as “the worst headache of the patient’s life is worrisome for a
subarachnoid hemorrhage.” (See the Clinical Pearls at end of each case.)
The clinical scenario would be something such as: “A 38-year-old woman is
noted to have a 2-day history of a unilateral, throbbing headache and photophobia.
What is the most likely diagnosis?”
With no other information to go on, the student would note that this woman
has a unilateral headache and photophobia. Using the “most common cause” information, the student would make an educated guess that the patient has a migraine
headache. If instead the patient is noted to have “the worst headache of her life,”
the student would use the Clinical Pearl: “The worst headache of the patient’s life is
worrisome for a subarachnoid hemorrhage.”

CLINICAL PEARL


The more common cause of a unilateral, throbbing headache with photophobia is a migraine, but the main concern is subarachnoid hemorrhage.
If the patient describes this as “the worst headache of her life,” the concern for a subarachnoid bleed is increased.

12

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

HOW WOULD YOU CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS?
In the scenario above, the woman with “the worst headache” is suspected of having a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This diagnosis could be confirmed by a CT scan
of the head and/or lumbar puncture. The student should learn the limitations of
various diagnostic tests, especially when used early in a disease process. The lumbar
puncture showing xanthochromia (red blood cells) is the “gold standard” test for
diagnosing subarachnoid hemorrhage, but it may be negative early in the disease
course.

WHAT SHOULD BE YOUR NEXT STEP?
This question is difficult because the next step has many possibilities; the answer
may be to obtain more diagnostic information, stage the illness, or introduce therapy. It is often a more challenging question than “What is the most likely diagnosis?”
because there may be insufficient information to make a diagnosis and the next
step may be to pursue more diagnostic information. Another possibility is that
there is enough information for a probable diagnosis, and the next step is to stage
the disease. Finally, the most appropriate answer may be to treat. Hence, from
clinical data, a judgment needs to be rendered regarding how far along one is on
the road of:
(1) Make a diagnosis → (2) Stage the disease →
(3) Treat based on stage → (4) Follow the response
Frequently, the student is taught “to regurgitate” the same information that someone has written about a particular disease, but is not skilled at identifying the next
step. This talent is learned optimally at the bedside, in a supportive environment,
with freedom to take educated guesses, and with constructive feedback. A sample
scenario might describe a student’s thought process as follows:
1. Make the diagnosis: “Based on the information I have, I believe that Mr. Smith
has a small-bowel obstruction from adhesive disease because he presents with
nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, high-pitched hyperactive bowel
sounds, and has dilated loops of small bowel on x-ray.”
2. Stage the disease: “I don’t believe that this is severe disease because he does not
have fever, evidence of sepsis, intractable pain, peritoneal signs, or leukocytosis.”
3. Treat based on stage: “Therefore, my next step is to treat with nothing per
mouth, NG (nasogastric) tube drainage, IV fluids, and observation.”
4. Follow response: “I want to follow the treatment by assessing his pain (I will ask
him to rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10 every day), his bowel function (I will
ask whether he has had nausea or vomiting, or passed flatus), his temperature,
abdominal examination, serum bicarbonate (for metabolic acidemia), and white
blood cell count, and I will reassess him in 48 hours.”
In a similar patient, when the clinical presentation is unclear, perhaps the best
“next step” may be diagnostic, such as an oral contrast radiological study to assess
for bowel obstruction.

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

13

CLINICAL PEARL


Usually, the vague query, “What is your next step?” is the most difficult
question because the answer may be diagnostic, staging, or therapeutic.

WHAT IS THE LIKELY MECHANISM FOR THIS PROCESS?
This question goes further than making the diagnosis, but also requires the student
to understand the underlying mechanism for the process. For example, a clinical
scenario may describe a 68-year-old man who notes urinary hesitancy and retention, and has a nontender large hard mass in his left supraclavicular region. This
patient has bladder neck obstruction either as a consequence of benign prostatic
hypertrophy or prostatic cancer. However, the indurated mass in the left neck area is
suspicious for cancer. The mechanism is metastasis occurs in the area of the thoracic
duct, because the malignant cells flow in the lymph fluid, which drains into the left
subclavian vein. The student is advised to learn the mechanisms for each disease
process, and not merely memorize a constellation of symptoms. Furthermore, in
emergency medicine, it is crucial for the student to understand the anatomy, function, and how treatment would correct the problem.

WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR THIS PROCESS?
Understanding the risk factors helps the practitioner to establish a diagnosis and
to determine how to interpret tests. For example, understanding risk factor analysis
may help in the management of a 55-year-old woman with anemia. If the patient
has risk factors for endometrial cancer (such as diabetes, hypertension, anovulation)
and complains of postmenopausal bleeding, she likely has endometrial carcinoma
and should have an endometrial biopsy. Otherwise, occult colonic bleeding is a common etiology. If she takes NSAIDs or aspirin, then peptic ulcer disease is the most
likely cause.

CLINICAL PEARL


Being able to assess risk factors helps to guide testing and develop the
differential diagnosis.

WHAT ARE THE COMPLICATIONS TO THIS PROCESS?
Clinicians must be cognizant of the complications of a disease, so that they will
understand how to follow and monitor the patient. Sometimes the student will have
to make the diagnosis from clinical clues and then apply his or her knowledge of the
consequences of the pathological process. For example, “a 26-year-old man complains of right-lower-extremity swelling and pain after a trans-Atlantic flight” and
his Doppler ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis. Complications of this process include pulmonary embolism (PE). Understanding the types of consequences
also helps the clinician to be aware of the dangers to a patient. If the patient has

14

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

any symptoms consistent with a PE, CT angiographic imaging of the chest may be
necessary.

WHAT IS THE BEST THERAPY?
To answer this question, not only does the clinician need to reach the correct diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition, but the clinician must also weigh the
situation to determine the appropriate intervention. For the student, knowing exact
dosages is not as important as understanding the best medication, route of delivery,
mechanism of action, and possible complications. It is important for the student to
be able to verbalize the diagnosis and the rationale for the therapy.

CLINICAL PEARL


Therapy should be logical based on the severity of disease and the specific
diagnosis. An exception to this rule is in an emergent situation such as
respiratory failure or shock when the patient needs treatment even as the
etiology is being investigated.

Summary
1. The first and foremost priority in addressing the emergency patient is stabilization, then assessing and treating the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation).
2. There is no replacement for a meticulous history and physical examination.
3. There are five steps in the clinical approach to the emergency patient: addressing life-threatening conditions, making the diagnosis, assessing severity, treating
based on severity, and following response.
4. There are seven questions that help to bridge the gap between the textbook and
the clinical arena.

CASE 1
A 13-year-old adolescent boy presents to the emergency department with a chief
complaint of sore throat and fever for 2 days. He reports that his younger sister
has been ill for the past week with “the same thing.” The patient has pain with
swallowing, but no change in voice, drooling, or neck stiffness. He denies any
recent history of cough, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He denies any recent
travel and has completed the full series of childhood immunizations. He has no
other medical problems, takes no medications, and has no allergies.
On examination, the patient has a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), a heart
rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure 118/64 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of
18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. His posterior
oropharynx reveals erythema with tonsillar exudates without uvular deviation, or
significant tonsillar swelling. Neck examination is supple without tenderness of
the anterior lymph nodes. Chest and cardiovascular examination is unremarkable.
His abdomen is soft and nontender with normal bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly. Skin is without rash.

ANSWERS TO CASE 1:
Streptococcal Pharyngitis (“Strep Throat”)
Summary: This is a 13-year-old adolescent boy with pharyngitis. He has fever, tonsillar exudate, no cough, and no tender cervical adenopathy. There is no evidence of
airway involvement.
• Most likely diagnosis: Streptococcal pharyngitis.
• Dangerous causes of sore throat: Epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, Ludwig angina.
• Diagnostic plan: Use Centor criteria to determine probability of bacterial pharyngitis and rapid antigen testing when appropriate.
• Therapeutic plan: Evaluate the patient for need of antibiotics versus supportive
care.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the different etiologies of pharyngitis, paying close attention to those
that are potentially life-threatening.
2. Be familiar with widely accepted decision-making strategies for the diagnosis and
management of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GABS) pharyngitis.
3. Learn the treatment of GABS pharyngitis and understand the sequelae of this
disease.
4. Recognize acute airway emergencies associated with upper airway infections.

Considerations
This 13-year-old patient presents with a common diagnostic dilemma: sore throat
and fever. The first priority for the physician is to assess whether the patient is
more ill than the complaint would indicate: stridorous breathing, air hunger,
toxic appearance, or drooling with inability to swallow would indicate impending
disaster. The ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation) must always be addressed first.
This patient does not have those types of “alarms.” Thus a more relaxed elicitation
of his history can take place, and examination of the head, neck, and throat can
be performed. In instances suggestive of epiglottitis such as stridor, drooling, and
toxic appearance, examination of the throat (especially with a tongue blade) may
cause upper airway obstruction in children, leading to respiratory failure. During the
examination, the clinician should be alert for complications of upper airway infection; however, this patient presents with a simple pharyngitis.
Overall the most common etiology of pharyngitis is viral organisms. This teenager has several features that make group A streptococcus more likely: age less than
15 years, fever, absence of cough, and the presence of tonsillar exudate. Of note,

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

the patient does not have “tender anterior cervical adenopathy.” The diagnosis of
group A streptococcal pharyngitis can be made clinically or with the aid of rapid
antigen testing. Rapid streptococcal antigen testing can give a fairly accurate result
immediately and treatment or nontreatment with penicillin can be based on this
result. If the rapid streptococcal antigen test is positive, antibiotic therapy should be
given; if the rapid test is negative, throat culture should be performed and antibiotics should be withheld. The gold standard for diagnosis is bacterial culture, and if
positive, the patient should be notified and given penicillin therapy.

APPROACH TO:
Pharyngitis
CLINICAL APPROACH
The differential diagnosis of pharyngitis is broad and includes viral etiologies
(rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus [HSV], influenza, parainfluenza, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], and CMV [cytomegalovirus] [causing infectious
mononucleosis], coxsackievirus [causing herpangina], and the human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), bacterial causes (GABS, group C streptococci, Arcanobacterium
haemolyticum, meningococcal, gonococcal, diphteritic, chlamydial, Legionella, and
Mycoplasma species), specific anatomically related conditions caused by bacterial
organisms (peritonsillar abscess, epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, Vincent angina,
and Ludwig angina), candidal pharyngitis, aphthous stomatitis, thyroiditis, and bullous erythema multiforme. Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis.
Group A streptococcus causes pharyngitis in 5% to 10% of adults and 15% to 30% of
children who seek medical care with the complaint of sore throat. It is often clinically
indistinguishable from other etiologies, yet it is the major treatable cause of pharyngitis.
Primary HIV infection may also cause acute pharyngitis, and its recognition can be
beneficial because early antiretroviral therapy can be started. Infectious mononucleosis
is also important to exclude because of the risk of splenomegaly and splenic rupture.
Other bacterial etiologies may also be treated with antibiotics. Studies suggest that
certain symptoms and historical features are suggestive of streptococcal pharyngitis and
may help guide the provider in generating a reasonable pretest probability of GABS.
The Centor criteria, modified by age risk, is helpful in assessing for GABS (Table 1–1).
Of note, recent epidemiologic data suggest Fusobacterium necrophorum causes
pharyngitis at a rate similar to GABS in young adults and if not treated is implicated
in causing Lemierre syndrome, a life-threatening suppurative complication.
Throat cultures remain the gold standard for the diagnosis of GABS pharyngitis,
but they have several limitations in use for daily practice. False-negative throat
cultures may occur in patients with few organisms in their pharynx or as a result of
inadequate sampling (improper swabbing method, errors in incubation or reading of
plates). False-positive throat cultures may occur in individuals who are asymptomatic carriers of GABS. Throat cultures are costly and, perhaps more importantly,
require 24 to 48 hours for results. Although it may be reasonable to delay therapy for

this period of time (delay will not increase likelihood of development of rheumatic
fever), it requires further communication with the patient and perhaps an uncomfortable latency in therapy from the concerned parent. Nevertheless, a negative
throat culture may prompt discontinuation of antibiotics.
The rapid-antigen test (RAT) for GABS, despite having some limitations, has
been embraced by many experts and incorporated into diagnostic algorithms. The
RAT is 80% to 90% sensitive and exceedingly specific when compared to throat
cultures. Results are point-of-care and available in minutes. Many experts recommend confirmation of negative RAT with throat culture. Individuals with positive
RAT results should be treated. Newer technologies, such as the optical immunoassay, may prove to be as sensitive as throat cultures while providing results within
minutes; its cost-effectiveness has not been established.
If RAT is available, then one accepted algorithm is given in Figure 1–1.

• Patients with 4 points from the Centor and/or McIsaac criteria should be empirically treated, because their pretest probability is reasonably high (although this
practice may result in overtreatment in as many as 50% of patients).
• Patients with 0 or 1 points should not receive antibiotics or diagnostic tests (the
criteria have been shown here to yield a negative predictive value of roughly 80%).
• Patients with 2 or 3 points should have RAT and those with positive RAT
results should be treated. Negative RAT results should withhold antibiotics be
followed with a throat culture.
If RAT is unavailable, then one accepted algorithm is given in Figure 1–2.

• Patients with 2 points should not receive antibiotics. The possible exceptions

many children, an immunocompromised patient, or a patient with recent exposure to someone with confirmed GABS.
Of note, antibiotic therapy in GABS pharyngitis has been de-emphasized because
complications have become increasingly rare and the data to support the efficacy of
antibiotic therapy in prevention of these complications is sparse and many decades old.
The complications of GABS can be classified into nonsuppurative and suppurative processes. The nonsuppurative complications of GABS pharyngitis include

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

rheumatic fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococci). Rheumatic fever is now rare in the United States
(an incidence of <1 case per 100,000), and is thought to be caused by only a handful
of strains of GABS. Despite its rarity, rheumatic fever can result in highly morbid
cardiac and neurological sequela; it also remains the most common cause of acquired
heart disease in children and adolescents in some developing countries. Published
literature suggests the GABS number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of
rheumatic fever is between 53 and thousands depending on the endemic incidence
of rheumatic fever. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a very rare complication of
pharyngitis. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, another feared complication of
GABS pharyngitis, is also very rare, and it occurs with equal frequency in both antibiotic-treated and nonantibiotic-treated groups. It is unclear if antibiotic therapy
reduces the incidence of PANDAS, which is a clinical entity in development and
presents with episodes of obsessive-compulsive behavior.
Prevention of the suppurative complications of GABS pharyngitis remains perhaps the most compelling reason for antibiotic therapy. These processes include
tonsillopharyngeal cellulitis, peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscesses, sinusitis,
meningitis, brain abscess, and streptococcal bacteremia. The precise incidence of
these complications is unclear, but what remains clear is that these are often preventable sequela that can have devastating consequences. Ultimately, the current practice is to treat suspected GABS pharyngitis with an appropriate antibiotic.

Treatment of GABS
Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for GABS pharyngitis. A Cochrane review of
the literature concluded that penicillin is the first choice antibiotic in patients with
acute throat infections. The antibiotic is inexpensive, well-tolerated, and has a reasonably narrow spectrum. Oral therapy requires a 10-day course, although multiple
daily doses for this duration may pose an issue with respect to compliance; penicillin V
500-mg bid dosing for 10 days in adults (as opposed to 250 mg tid or qid) is a reasonable alternative. For patients in whom compliance may be a significant issue, a single
IM shot of 600,000 units of penicillin G benzathine in patients weighing <27 kg
(1.2 million units if patient weighs >27 kg) is another option, although it requires an
uncomfortable injection and, more significantly, it cannot be reversed or discontinued
should an adverse reaction occur. All patients, regardless of final diagnosis, should be
given adequate analgesia and reassurance. It has been shown that individuals who are
perceived to want antibiotics may ultimately just want pain relief.
While somewhat controversial, some physicians recommend steroids as an antiinflammatory agent to decrease the pain and swelling associated with GABS. A
meta-analysis of over a thousand patients showed improvement 4.5 hours faster with
steroids compared to placebo with a minimal reduction in pain scores. If clinically
indicated, the standard agent is dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg up to 10 mg PO or IM.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

23

Airway Complications
There are several life-threatening causes of sore throat. Patients may suffer airway
obstruction from acute epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess,
and Ludwig angina (Table 1–2); although less frequent, airway compromise may also
occur with Vincent angina and diphtheria pharyngitis; the latter requires prompt
diagnosis and treatment to avoid spread of this highly infectious condition. Management of the airway in these conditions (see Table I–2 in Section I) sometimes necessitates emergency cricothyroidotomy (Figure 1–3), because the pharynx and larynx
may be edematous, distorted, or inflamed. Prompt identification of acute retroviral syndrome from recent HIV infection can allow for rapid antiretroviral therapy.
Infectious mononucleosis should be identified so that potentially serious sequela
can be considered. These complications include splenomegaly that predisposes the
patient to traumatic rupture of the spleen with relatively minor trauma; additionally,
this splenomegaly can cause splenic sequestration and thrombocytopenia.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
1.1 A 48-year-old man is noted to have a 2-day history of sore throat, subjective
fever at home, and no medical illnesses. He denies cough or nausea. On examination, his temperature is 38.3°C (101°F), and he has some tonsillar swelling
but no exudate. He has bilateral enlarged and tender lymph nodes of the neck.
The rapid streptococcal antigen test is negative. Which of the following is the
best next step?
A. Oral clindamycin
B. Treatment based on results from throat culture
C. Observation
D. Begin amantadine
1.2 Which of the following patients is most likely to have group A streptococcal
infection?
A. An 11-month-old male infant with fever and red throat
B. An 8-year-old girl with fever and sore throat
C. A 27-year-old man with a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F), pharyngitis, and
cough
D. A 52-year-old woman who complains of fever of 39.2°C (102.5°F) and sore
throat
1.3 A 19-year-old college student has had a sore throat, mild abdominal pain, and
fever for 5 days. He was playing football with some friends, and was tackled
just short of the goal line, hitting the grass somewhat forcibly. He experiences
some abdominal pain, and passes out. The EMS (emergency medical services) is
called and his vital signs reveal the heart rate as 140 beats per minute and blood
pressure as 80/40 mm Hg with a distended abdomen. Which of the following is
the most likely etiology?
A. Vasovagal reaction
B. Ruptured aortic aneurysm
C. Complications of Epstein-Barr infection
D. Ruptured jejunum
1.4 An 18-year-old woman presents with fever and a sore throat. She is sitting up
drooling, with some stridor. Her temperature is 39.4°C (103°F) and she appears
ill. Which of the following is your next step?
A. Examine the pharynx and obtain a rapid antigen test.
B. Empiric treatment with penicillin.
C. Throat culture and treatment based on results.
D. Send the patient to radiology for an anteroposterior (AP) neck radiograph.
E. Prepare for emergent airway management.

26

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS
1.1 B. This individual has a modiﬁed Centor score of 2 (history of fever, tender
adenopathy, no cough, age >45 y). The rapid antigen test is negative, but a
deﬁnitive culture should be performed for a Centor score of 2 or 3, and treatment should be based on culture results.
1.2 B. GABS is most common in patients younger than 15 years (although not in
infants). McIsaac added age as a criteria because patients older than age 45 years
have a much lower incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis.
1.3 C. This patient most likely suffered from splenic rupture caused by mononucleosis (EBV). He is hypotensive because of the massive hemoperitoneum. Aortic
aneurysm is rare in teenagers.
1.4 E. Regardless of the etiology, this patient has a clinical presentation alarming
for impending respiratory collapse, and preparations for emergent airway management is the most important next step. The drooling and stridor are suspicious for epiglottitis, which can present more insidiously in adults. Examination
of the posterior oropharynx may induce laryngospasm and airway obstruction,
particularly in children; a lateral neck radiograph to assess for a “thumbprinting” of epiglottitis may be helpful in making the diagnosis, but sending the
patient with impending respiratory failure to radiology area is inappropriate.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The most common cause of pharyngitis is viral.



The Centor criteria suggestive of GABS pharyngitis include tonsillar exudate, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, history of fever, and absence of
cough.



GABS pharyngitis is more common in patients younger than 15 years of
age, and less common in those older than 45 years of age.



Overtreatment of pharyngitis with antibiotics is common and is a major
source of antibiotic overuse.



Glomerulonephritis is a rare complication of GABS pharyngitis (but not
GABS infections of other tissues) that is not clearly prevented by antibiotic therapy.



Rheumatic fever is an exceedingly rare complication of GABS pharyngitis
that can be prevented by antibiotic therapy.



Complicated upper airway conditions should be considered when a
patient presents with “sore throat.”



In general, cricothyroidotomy is the safest method of surgically securing
an airway in the ED.

CASE 2
A 58-year-old man arrives at the emergency department complaining of chest pain.
The pain began 1 hour ago, during breakfast, and is described as severe, dull, and
pressure-like. It is substernal in location, radiates to both shoulders, and is associated with shortness of breath. The patient vomited once. His wife adds that he was
very sweaty when the pain began. The patient has diabetes and hypertension and
takes hydrochlorothiazide and glyburide. His blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg,
pulse rate is 95 beats per minute, respiration is 20 breaths per minute, temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F), and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is 98%. The patient
is diaphoretic and appears anxious. On auscultation, faint crackles are heard at
both lung bases. The cardiac examination reveals an S4 gallop and is otherwise
normal. The examination of the abdomen reveals no masses or tenderness. The
ECG is shown in Figure 2–1.

ANSWERS TO CASE 2:
Myocardial Infarction, Acute
Summary: This is a 58-year-old man presenting with acute severe chest pain, diaphoresis, and dyspnea. The patient has a number of risk factors for underlying coronary
heart disease and the history and physical examination are typical of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute myocardial infarction.
• Next diagnostic steps: Place the patient on a cardiac monitor, establish IV
access, and obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately. A chest x-ray and
serum levels of cardiac markers should be obtained as soon as possible.
• Immediate therapies: Aspirin is the most important immediate therapy. Oxygen
and sublingual nitroglycerin are also standard early therapies. Depending on
the result of the ECG, emergency reperfusion therapy, such as thrombolysis, may
be indicated. Intravenous β-blockers, IV nitroglycerin, low-molecular-weight
heparin, and additional antiplatelet agents, such as clopidogrel, might also be
indicated.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize acute myocardial infarction (MI) and the spectrum of acute coronary
syndromes (ACSs).
2. Know the appropriate diagnostic tests and their limitations.
3. Understand the therapeutic approach to ACS.

Considerations
Chest pain accounts for more than 6 million visits every year to emergency departments in the United States. Of these 6 million visits, nearly 800,000 will end with a
diagnosis of MI and 1.5 million will be given the diagnoses of unstable angina (UA)
or non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Coronary heart disease
(CHD) is the leading cause of death in adults in the United States. Furthermore,
missed MI accounts for the most money paid in malpractice claims in emergency
medicine. Because ACS is common, treatable, and potentially catastrophic both
clinically and medicolegally, emergency physicians should be thoroughly familiar
with this problem.
Our understanding of the pathophysiology behind cardiac ischemia has evolved
from a model of progressive coronary artery narrowing to a current model of plaque
rupture and thrombus formation. The concept of fixed narrowing explains only
stable angina brought on by increased myocardial demand. In contrast, ACS,
which encompasses the spectrum of UA, NSTEMI, and ST-elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI), involves a dynamic process of inflammation and intravascular

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

thrombosis, beginning with coronary artery plaque rupture. The fate of this plaque,
in terms of location and extent of subsequent thrombosis, determines the clinical
presentation and seems to correlate with the subdivisions of ACS. STEMI occurs
when total occlusion of an epicardial vessel causes transmural infarction, classically
presenting as unremitting chest pain and ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiography (ECG). It is treated with immediate reperfusion therapy.
The clinical syndromes of NSTEMI and UA, in contrast, are caused by subendocardial infarction or ischemia, respectively, usually caused by microemboli arising
from the ruptured plaque. Chest pain is often stuttering and ECG changes such as
ST-segment depression may be transient. Although often indistinguishable upon
initial presentation, elevation in cardiac markers is what eventually distinguishes
NSTEMI from UA. Immediate therapy for both NSTEMI and UA focuses on halting ongoing thrombosis and reducing myocardial demand. Many patients go on to
have percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), such as stent placement, directed
at the unstable plaque.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Myocardial Infarction
DEFINITIONS
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: Myocardial cell death caused by ischemia, as
evidenced by a typical rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers.
ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME: An ischemic chest pain syndrome, usually
associated with coronary artery plaque rupture, encompassing STEMI, NSTEMI,
and UA.
UNSTABLE ANGINA: An acute coronary syndrome, in which chest pain is of
new onset, or increasing severity, or occurs at rest, and cardiac biomarkers are not
elevated.
NON–ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: An acute coronary
syndrome in which cardiac biomarkers are eventually elevated, but lacking new ST
elevation on ECG.
ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: An acute coronary syndrome, in which significant ST elevation is found in two or more contiguous ECG
leads, typically associated with epicardial coronary artery occlusion and transmural
infarction, and resulting in Q waves if perfusion is not soon restored.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Evaluation
The cornerstone of diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes is the ECG. Because findings on the initial ECG form a critical branch point in therapy, patients presenting
to the emergency department with chest pain suggestive of ACS should have an

ECG within 10 minutes of arrival. Identifying STEMI by ECG as soon as possible
is the first step toward rapidly establishing reperfusion and reducing mortality (the
ECG criteria for reperfusion therapy are listed in Table 2–1). In contrast to STEMI,
ECG findings may be subtle or absent in NSTEMI and UA, and are not required for
diagnosis and initiation of therapy. However, certain findings, such as ST-segment
depression or deep T-wave inversions, particularly those that change in accord with
symptoms, can rapidly establish the diagnosis of UA and NSTEMI.
Unfortunately, the ECG is frequently nondiagnostic in ACS. Even in patients
eventually diagnosed with MI, the initial ECG is nondiagnostic in about 50% and
completely normal in up to 8%. Comparing the current ECG to old tracings is crucial,
because subtle changes may be seen. Serial ECGs performed at 15- to 30-minute intervals, or continuous ST-segment monitoring, may reveal the subtle dynamic changes
of UA, or those of an evolving MI (Table 2–2 lists the anatomical locations of MI).
In the face of a normal or nondiagnostic ECG, the decision whether to further
evaluate for ACS depends on the likelihood that the pain is actually of cardiac

origin and on the patient’s overall risk profile. Inquiring about traditional risk factors for CHD remains a standard component of the chest pain evaluation. CHD risk
factors are listed in Table 2–3. High risk is easily established if there is a prior history
of definite CHD such as prior MI or abnormal coronary angiogram. Characteristics
of the history and physical examination that alter the likelihood that the pain is of
cardiac origin are listed in Table 2–4. Patients who are young, without a family history of premature CHD, and with an atypical history and a normal or nondiagnostic
ECG can usually be safely discharged without further evaluation for ACS. Shortterm prognosis in those with known or suspected UA or NSTEMI can be calculated
with the thrombolytics in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score (Table 2–5).
Serum cardiac markers are used to confirm or exclude myocardial cell death, and
are considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of MI. There are a number of
markers currently in wide use, including myoglobin, CKMB, and troponin. While
algorithms vary, serum levels of 1 or more cardiac markers should be obtained initially and at 4 to 12 hours after presentation. Troponin I is extremely sensitive and
specific for cardiac damage; thus an elevated level confirms infarction whereas a
normal level at 8 to 12 hours after the onset of pain excludes infarction. Important
limitations of cardiac markers are that levels remain normal in unstable angina and

serum elevations are delayed 4 to 12 hours after infarction. The trend and peak of
positive biomarkers can indicate the dynamics of necrosis and infarct size.
Other studies that are routinely obtained in the workup of ACS include a chest
radiograph (CXR), complete blood count, chemistries, coagulation studies, and
blood type. The CXR serves to rule out other causes of chest pain, and to identify pulmonary edema. Although not a perfect test, a normal mediastinum on CXR
makes aortic dissection least likely. For this reason, a chest radiograph should be
performed prior to thrombolysis.

Treatment
When ACS is suspected based on history, treatment should be started immediately.
The patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor, IV access established, and an
ECG obtained. Unless allergic, affected patients should be immediately given aspirin
to chew (162 mg dose is common). Aspirin is remarkably beneficial across the entire
spectrum of ACS. For example, in the setting of STEMI, the survival benefit from
a single dose of aspirin is roughly equal to that of thrombolytic therapy (but with
negligible risk or cost). Other mainstays of initial treatment are oxygen, sublingual
nitroglycerin, which decreases wall tension and myocardial oxygen demand, and
morphine sulfate. Together with aspirin these three therapies make up the mnemonic
“MONA,” which is said to “greet chest pain patients at the door.” Based on results
of the initial ECG, therapy then progresses in one of two directions.

ST-Elevation MI
When the ECG reveals STEMI and symptoms have been present for less than
12 hours, immediate reperfusion therapy is indicated. The saying “time is myocardium” is a reminder that myocardial salvage and clinical benefit are critically
dependent on the time to restoration of flow in the infarct-related artery. Optimally,
total ischemic time should be limited to less than 120 minutes. There are two ways
to achieve reperfusion: primary PCI (angioplasty or stent placement) and thrombolysis. The choice is largely determined by the capabilities of the hospital.
Primary PCI is the treatment of choice when it can be performed rapidly by an
experienced cardiologist. The standard “door-to-balloon time” goal is 90 minutes.
Compared to thrombolysis, PCI leads to lower 30-day mortality (4.4% vs 6.5%),

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

35

nonfatal reinfarction rate (7.2% vs 11.9%), and fewer hemorrhagic strokes. Recent
studies suggest that if a patient presents to a hospital that does not offer PCI, transfer
to a neighboring facility for primary PCI is superior to thrombolysis if transfer can
be accomplished within 90 minutes. PCI is also used for STEMI complicated by
cardiogenic shock, when there is a contraindication to thrombolysis, and in cases
where thrombolysis fails to restore perfusion (rescue PCI). Administration of lowmolecular-weight heparin and a glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor prior to PCI reduces
the risk of reinfarction.
When PCI is not an option, intravenous thrombolytic agents may be used to
achieve reperfusion. Studies of thrombolytic therapy versus placebo for STEMI
show an absolute mortality reduction of roughly 3%. The benefit of thrombolysis
is greatest when treatment is begun within 4 hours, and benefit approaches that
of primary PCI when thrombolytics are begun within 30 minutes. However,
benefit extends out to 12 hours. Adjunctive antithrombotic therapy with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin is required with most thrombolytic agents.
Table 2–6 lists other measures, in addition to aspirin and reperfusion therapy, that
reduce mortality after MI.

Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation MI
Cases of ACS lacking ECG criteria for reperfusion fall into the UA/NSTEMI category. The approach to therapy for UA/NSTEMI tends to be graded, based on ECG
findings, cardiac marker results, TIMI risk score, and whether the patient is likely
to undergo early angiography and PCI. Aspirin and nitroglycerin constitute the
minimum therapy. Morphine is added when chest discomfort continues despite
nitroglycerin therapy. a-blockers, such as IV metoprolol, are usually added in cases
presenting with hypertension or tachycardia. While the mortality benefit of chronic
β-blocker therapy after MI is well established, in the acute setting, β-blockers should
be used with caution because they can place certain patients at risk for cardiogenic
shock, such as those presenting with signs of heart failure.
In high-risk patients, a more aggressive approach to halting the thrombotic process is taken, by adding low-molecular-weight heparin and oral clopidogrel, an
antiplatelet agent. Patients are considered to be high risk if there are ischemic ECG

changes, elevated cardiac markers, or if the TIMI risk score is 3 or greater. Intravenous glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitors, an even more potent and expensive type of
antiplatelet drug, are reserved for the subset of high-risk patients who will undergo
early angiography and PCI, in whom these agents have been shown to reduce subsequent CHD morbidity.
In the past, angiography was often postponed for a number of days or weeks
following an episode of ACS. However, recent studies have shown that an early
invasive strategy, where high-risk patients with UA and NSTEMI are taken for
angiography and PCI within 24 to 36 h, has slightly superior efficacy to medical
therapy and delayed angiography. An early invasive strategy is indicated for any
of the following: refractory angina, hemodynamic instability, signs of heart failure,
ventricular tachycardia, ST depressions on ECG, or elevated cardiac enzymes. Like
primary PCI for STEMI, whether an early invasive strategy is chosen often depends
on hospital resources and cardiology expertise.

Complications
Several life-threatening complications of acute MI may arise at any time after
presentation (Table 2–7). Serious complications occur most often in the setting
of anterior STEMI. MI-associated ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (sudden death) are the most frequently encountered complications in the
ED and prehospital setting, occurring in approximately 10% of cases. Continuous
cardiac monitoring and immediate cardioversion/defibrillation has been a mainstay
of cardiac care since the 1960s, and has been shown to save lives on a large scale.
Bradyarrhythmias may also complicate MI. Heart block that occurs in the setting
of anterior MI generally implies irreversible damage to the His-Purkinje system and
is an indication for transvenous pacing. Inferior MI, in contrast, frequently causes
arteriovenous (AV) node dysfunction and second-degree block that is transient and
may respond to atropine.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

Pump dysfunction, leading to pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock, is an
ominous complication of MI that implies a large area of myocardial injury. The
left ventricular dysfunction that occurs with anterior MI usually causes recognizable pulmonary edema, with tachypnea, rales, and visible congestion on chest x-ray.
A new systolic murmur may be heard when cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused
by papillary muscle dysfunction and acute mitral regurgitation. Signs of cardiogenic
shock range from frank hypotension to subtle indicators of impaired perfusion such
as oliguria, cool extremities, and confusion. Emergency PCI is the reperfusion strategy of choice for cardiogenic shock. Insertion of an aortic balloon pump may be
indicated in addition to pressor agents. Right ventricular infarction, which complicates inferior MI, usually presents as hypotension without pulmonary congestion.
The diagnosis is confirmed by ST elevation in lead V4 on a right-sided ECG, and
the primary treatment is aggressive volume loading. Nitroglycerine and high-dose
morphine should be avoided in these patients.
Late complications of MI that tend to occur in the intensive care unit several
hours to days after presentation include left ventricular free wall rupture causing
tamponade, ventricular septal defect, pericarditis, left ventricular aneurysm, and
thromboembolism. Finally, iatrogenic complications of MI therapy can occur. Emergency physicians who administer thrombolytics for STEMI must consider the risk
of serious hemorrhagic complications, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, which
occurs in 0.5% to 0.7% of patients and is usually fatal. Heparin and antiplatelet
therapy leads to significant bleeding in up to 10% of patients, depending on what
agents are given, although life-threatening hemorrhage is rare.

B. If a repeat ECG in 30 minutes is normal, myocardial infarction is essentially ruled out and the patient may be safely discharged.
C. The patient should be advised that half of heart attack patients have a
nondiagnostic ECG and serial cardiac biomarkers levels should be assessed.
D. The patient should undergo an immediate thallium stress test to further
assess for coronary artery disease to help clarify the management.

ANSWERS
2.1 B. The ECG is the crucial ﬁrst diagnostic test in the evaluation of chest pain.
Presence versus absence of ST elevation represents a major therapeutic branch
point.
2.2 B. While all of these therapies are useful, aspirin signiﬁcantly decreases mortality, with almost no downside in nonallergic patients, and should be given
immediately.
2.3 C. Roughly half of patients with MI, as deﬁned by a typical rise in cardiac biomarkers, will have a nondiagnostic ECG upon presentation. Risk stratiﬁcation
by stress testing is sometimes ordered from the emergency department, but only
after serial ECGs and cardiac biomarkers remain normal.

CLINICAL PEARLS


MONA greets chest pain at the door (morphine, oxygen, nitroglycerin,
and, most importantly, aspirin).



An ECG should be performed immediately in all patients with chest pain
concerning for ACS.

The ECG will dictate the next step in management: new ST elevation generally requires immediate reperfusion therapy. “Time is myocardium.”

CASE 3
A 70-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath for the past 2 weeks. Previously, he could walk everywhere, but now
he becomes fatigued after a short stroll through the grocery store. He also notes
that he has felt his heart racing even when he is at rest. His past medical history is notable only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and
amlodipine. On physical examination, he appears comfortable and speaks in full
sentences without difficulty. His blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, heart rate is
144 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation
is 98% on room air, and temperature is 37°C (98.6°F). His head and neck examination is unremarkable. His lungs are clear to auscultation. His heartbeat is irregular
and rapid, without murmurs rubs or gallops. He has no extremity edema or jugular venous distension. His abdomen is soft and nontender, without masses. Labs
show a normal CBC, normal electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, troponin, BNP, and
thyroid stimulating hormone. A chest x-ray reveals a normal cardiac silhouette
with no pulmonary edema. The ECG is shown below (Figure 3–1).

ANSWERS TO CASE 3:
Atrial Fibrillation
Summary: A 70-year-old man presents with mild dyspnea on exertion and palpitations. The physical examination reveals a heartbeat that is irregular and rapid at a
rate of 144 beats per minute.
• Most likely diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
• Common contributing factors: Increasing age, underlying cardiopulmonary disease (such as hypertension, heart failure, and COPD), hyperthyroidism, sepsis,
pulmonary embolism, and electrolyte abnormalities
• Complications:Early—diminished cardiac output. Late—thromboembolism and
cardiomyopathy

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know that atrial fibrillation is often a manifestation of serious underlying disease
processes.
2. Be able to recognize atrial fibrillation on ECG.
3. Understand the approach to rate control versus rhythm control of atrial fibrillation.
4. Understand the role of antithrombotic therapy in both the acute and chronic
management of atrial fibrillation.

Considerations
This individual is a 70-year-old man of fairly high function, who is brought into the
emergency department because of dyspnea and palpitations. The initial approach
should begin with ABCs and an assessment of any life-threatening concerns. Upon
arrival, this patient should get an IV and be placed on cardiac and pulse oximetry monitors. The history and physical examination should focus on the patient’s
cardiac and pulmonary status. His pulse and the rhythm on the cardiac monitor
will both reveal an irregular tachycardia, which should prompt an immediate ECG.
The ECG shows an irregularly irregular tachycardia consistent with the diagnosis of
atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).
In this patient with symptomatic AF with RVR, an early priority in management
will be to slow the ventricular rate. For most patients with AF, the typical symptoms
of palpitations and dyspnea can be alleviated through simple rate control. In rare
cases, tachycardia and loss of the “atrial kick” can lead to diminished cardiac output,
hypotension, or congestive heart failure. In those cases, if the arrhythmia is thought
to be the primary cause of the patients’ instability, emergent electrical cardioversion is indicated. In the more stable patients, the decision of whether to convert the
rhythm depends on a number of factors, including risk of thromboembolism, need for

underlying cause of the rhythm rather than the rhythm itself (Table 3–1).

APPROACH TO:
Atrial Fibrillation
DEFINITIONS
DYSPNEA: Difficult or labored breathing, shortness of breath, or a sensation of
breathlessness
THROMBOEMBOLISM: The passage of a blood clot through the vascular system
from one part of the body to another—for example, in the setting of AF, a clot forms
in the heart and then embolizes through arterial circulation to the brain
CARDIOMYOPATHY: Damage to heart muscle as the result of a number of various insults causing diminished functionality, which can eventually lead to heart
failure, arrhythmia, and sudden death

CLINICAL APPROACH
AF affects 1% of the general population and is the most common treatable arrhythmia seen in the emergency department. The prevalence of AF increases with age.
In adults younger than 55 years old the prevalence is only 0.1%, whereas in adults
greater than 80 years old the prevalence is greater than 10%. AF is more common
in men than in women and more common in whites than in blacks. Among patients
with AF, 80% have cardiovascular disease, most commonly hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and cardiomyopathy. The remaining common underlying causes include pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary embolism, COPD, and
obstructive sleep apnea and systemic diseases such as hyperthyroidism, obesity, and
diabetes. The exception is lone AF, which is a term used to describe AF in patients

42

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

younger than 60 years old who have no evidence of heart disease. However, increasingly the term “lone AF” has been falling out of favor because it does not have a
standardized, universally-accepted definition (see Table 3–1).

Pathophysiology
It is theorized that AF is caused by a complex interaction between triggers for AF
and abnormal atrial myocardium that has multiple reentrant circuits or automatic
foci outside the sinoatrial (SA) node. This interplay leads to rapid electrical activity
in the atria, which produces disorganized and ineffective atrial contractions.
The rapid atrial electrical activity is also conducted through the atrioventriular
(AV) node leading to an irregular ventricular response. The ventricular rate, which
is usually around 100 to 160, depends on the AV node’s ability to conduct the atrial
depolarization and to recover from the previous conduction. On ECG, AF looks
like an irregularly irregular, usually narrow-complex, tachcycardia without associated p waves.
AF has a number of clinical implications, most importantly cardiomyopathy
and thromboembolization. Acutely, the loss of the “atrial kick” leads to a reduction in cardiac output (CO) by as much as 15%. Together with the rapid ventricular response shortening the diastolic filling time, CO may be significantly reduced,
especially in those with already poor left ventricular function. This reduction in
CO can result in hypotension and symptoms of heart failure including dyspnea and
fatigue. Over the long term, AF causes progressive structural and elctrophysiologic
changes in the atria that promote recurrent episodes of AF. Additionally, chronic
low levels of tachycardia lead to global cardiomyopathy, which in turn predisposes
to more AF. For this reason it is said that AF “begets” more AF.
In addition to heart failure and cardiomyopathy, another important clinical
implication of AF is thromboembolization. The disorganized, ineffective atrial contractions caused by AF lead to blood stasis in the left atria, especially in the left
atrial appendage. This stasis promotes the formation of a thrombus, which can then
dislodge and embolize through the arterial circulation, causing problems such as
stroke and limb ischemia. Patients with AF have two to threefold higher risk of
stroke compared with the general population.

Treatment
The management of AF is challenging because AF, rather than being a disease unto
itself, is often a symptom of underlying cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine, or toxicological pathology. Successful management begins by initially addressing the patient’s
overall clinical status, searching for treatable contributing factors, controlling the
rate, and preventing thromboembolism (Figure 3–2).
In stable patients with AF, the treatment options include rate control and/or
rhythm control, with or without anticoagulation. In the acute setting such as the
emergency department, ventricular rate control is the single most important goal
of therapy. Slowing the ventricular response to AF has a number of positive hemodynamic effects including increasing diastolic filling time, improving stroke volume
and cardiac output, and stabilizing blood pressure. Drugs used to control the ventricular rate work by slowing conduction through the AV node (Table 3–2).

Figure 3–2. Algorithm for management of atrial fibrillation.

There are two groups of patients with AF who should not receive rate controlling agents: (1) unstable patients in whom the instability is presumed to be
caused by the rhythm, (2) patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome
(Figure 3–3). Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should get immediate
electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm. Patients with WPW should not
receive any AV nodal blocking agents since they can lead to accelerated conduction down the accessory pathway and potentially induce ventricular fibrillation and
cardiac arrest. Patients with WPW and AF should instead get either pharmacologic
or electrical cardioversion depending on their hemodynamic stability.

Cardioversion
In order to cardiovert AF, several issues must first be addressed: the need for anticoagulation and the timing and method of cardioversion. During AF, uncoordinated
atrial contractions lead to intra-atrial thrombus formation. The longer the duration
of AF, the greater is the likelihood of clot formation. Following cardioversion,
the period of “atrial stunning” can also lead to thrombogenesis. Without anticoagulation 4% to 5% of patients will have a thromboembolic event in the first

month following cardioversion either from the dislodging of an existing clot or the
formation of new clot caused by the “atrial stunning.” This risk increases with the
duration of the AF and the underlying disease processes.
Many practitioners use the “48-hour rule” to guide anticoagulation: AF of less
than 48 hours duration does not generally require acute anticoagulation except
when the patient has mitral valve disease, severe left ventricle dysfunction, or prior
history of embolic stroke. Several recent studies have shown that it is both safe and
cost-effective for patients with an uncomplicated clinical status who present to the
emergency department with AF for less than 48 hours to be cardioverted and discharged directly from the emergency room.
Conversely, patients presenting with AF of greater than 48 hours duration
should be anticoagulated prior to cardioversion. The two main approaches for
pre-cardioversion anticoagulation are warfarin (Coumadin) or the combination of
heparin/enoxaparin (LMWH) plus a screening transesophageal echocardiography
(TEE). The conventional approach is to give warfarin therapy with an INR goal
of 2 to 3 for 3 to 4 weeks before cardioversion. The alternative approach is quicker
and consists of doing a TEE and, if no clot is seen, administering heparin or enoxaparin and proceeding immediately to cardioversion (Table 3–3). In both approaches,
warfarin therapy (with and INR of 2-3) must be continued for at least 3 to 4 weeks
post-cardioversion in order to prevent new clot formation during the “atrial stunning window.” Both approaches reduce the risk of thromboembolism to less than
1% over 8 weeks.
The two methods of cardioversion are direct current (DC) cardioversion and
pharmacologic cardioversion, with DC cardioversion being the more effective
approach (see Tables 3–4 and 3–5). The risk of thromboembolism is similar, regardless of which method is chosen. The likelihood of a successful cardioversion for
either method depends on the characteristics of the patient, the etiology of the
AF, and, most importantly, the duration of the AF. New-onset AF will spontaneously convert in about 70% of cases, whereas cases of AF with a longer duration and

and about 30% for chronic AF.
Following cardioversion, 20% to 30% of patients will remain in normal sinus
rhythm (NSR). The patients most likely to have recurrent AF are those with hypertension, an enlarged left atrium, heart failure, or AF for more than a year. It is
generally thought that the risks of toxicity and proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic therapy after cardioversion outweigh the benefits, especially in patients with
no prior episodes of AF. However, in some patients who have persistent symptoms

despite adequate rate control or who have an inability to attain adequate rate control, a rhythm control strategy may be chosen. Amiodarone and propafenone are
commonly used agents to maintain sinus rhythm.
Dronedarone is a new drug approved in the United States to prevent recurrent
AF. It is structurally similar to amiodarone but lacks an iodine moiety. Dronedarone
has been shown to be better tolerated than amiodarone with fewer thyroid, dermatologic, neurologic and ocular side effects. The drawbacks to dronedarone are that
it is less effective at decreasing recurrent AF compared with amiodarone, and that
it is associated with increased mortality in NYHA class IV heart failure or recently
decompensated heart failure.
An alternative therapy to maintaining sinus rhythm that has had increasing
interest and investigation is radiofrequency catheter ablation. Ablation is recommended for a select patient populations with symptomatic AF and mild or no left
atrial enlargement in whom a rhythm control strategy has been chosen, but who
have failed treatment with one or more antiarrhythmic drugs. Given the shortcomings of chronic antiarrythmic therapy, in terms of side effects and recidivism rates,
electrophysiologic interventions are likely to become more widespread.

Thromboembolic Risk Reduction
Patients with AF have a two- to threefold higher risk of stroke than the general
population. The risk is the same for patients with paroxysmal, persistent or chronic
AF. It was previously thought that the use of antiarrhythmic agents to maintain
a sinus rhythm reduced this risk. The Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation
of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial, which compared rhythm control to rate
control plus warfarin in 4060 patients, showed the rate control plus warfarin group
had a trend toward better survival, fewer hospitalizations, and better quality of life
scores. Interestingly, the rhythm control patients who were not on warfarin experienced a significantly higher incidence of stroke. This data suggest that even patients
with rare or intermittent AF may benefit from antithrombotic therapy.
The type of antithrombotic therapy (either anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy) used to prevent thromboembolism depends on the patient’s individual risk of
having a thromboembolic event and his risk of bleeding on antithrombotic therapy.
The most validated and clinically useful risk stratification model for determining
stroke risk is the CHADS2 score (Table 3–6).
Anticoagulation therapy traditionally consists of warfarin with an INR goal
between 2 and 3. Dabigatran is a new oral anticoagulation agent that was shown

to be superior to warfarin in the recent RE-LY trial. Dabigatran reduces the rate of
ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, major bleeding, and overall mortality compared
to warfarin. In addition to being more effective and safer, it does not require INR
monitoring, is less susceptible to diet and drug interactions, and does not have warfarin’s narrow therapeutic window. However, the drawbacks to dabigatran are its
higher cost, twice daily dosing, need for adjustment in patients with renal failure,
lack of an antidote, and lack of long-term safety data. The dosage for dabigatran is
150 mg twice daily. The 110 mg twice daily dose is recommended for patients with
increased risk of bleeding. However, the 110 mg capsule is currently not available
in the United States.
Antiplatelet therapy consists of aspirin 75 to 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg
daily, or both together. Aspirin has only a very small ability to reduce stroke risk.
For patients with no risk factors for stroke, the current evidence shows that the
risk of bleeding from aspirin likely exceeds the small benefit of decreased stroke risk.
Aspirin, clopidogrel, and aspirin plus clopidogrel are all less effective in preventing
stroke than warfarin. For patients who need anticoagulation but cannot take warfarin or dabigatran, the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin is more effective than
aspirin alone. However, this combination carries similar bleeding risks to formal
anticoagulation (Table 3–7).

B. DC cardioversion
C. Synthroid

ANSWERS
3.1 B. Stroke is two to three times more likely in patients with AF than in the general population.
3.2 D. Always cardiovert any unstable patient (congestive heart failure, chest pain,
hypotension) with AF if the instability is felt to be rhythm related. AF with
rapid ventricular response does not allow for ventricular ﬁlling, leading to ineffective cardiac output.
3.3 A. Diltiazem was the only rate-controlling agent listed, and is very useful in the
initial management of AF with rapid ventricular response.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

CLINICAL PEARLS


Treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) begins with searching for any underlying
reversible causes of the arrhythmia.



In an acute setting, the most important goal of therapy is ventricular rate
control, typically through the use of AV nodal blocking drugs.



Unstable patients with AF or Wolff-Parkinson-White tachyarrhythmia with
AF should undergo immediate electrical cardioversion.



Stable patients with AF for less than 48 hours can be cardioverted in the
ED provided they have no prior history of thromboembolism, mitral valve
disease, or LV dysfunction.



Stable patients with AF of greater than 48 hours or unknown duration can
be cardioverted in two ways: (1) anticoagulation for 3-4 weeks prior to,
and following cardioversion, or (2) imaging by TEE and, if no intracardiac
thrombus is seen, acute anticoagulation with heparin/LMWH, followed
by cardioversion, and anticoagulation for 3-4 weeks.



70% of new-onset AF will spontaneously convert to sinus rhythm.



Patients with AF have a two to three times higher risk of stroke than the
general population.



The choice of antithrombotic therapy for long-term AF depends on an
individual’s CHADS2 score and risk of bleeding.



Anticoagulation with either warfarin (INR goal 2-3) or dabigatran reduces
the risk of thromboembolism.

CASE 4
A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department (ED) with palpitations
and lightheadedness. These symptoms started acutely about 1 hour prior to
arrival while he was watching television. The patient does not have any chest pain
or shortness of breath. He also denies any recent fever, upper respiratory symptoms, and hemoptysis. He does not have any significant past medical history or
family history. He is not taking any medications, does not smoke, and has never
used any illicit drugs.
On examination, his temperature is 98.2°F, his blood pressure is 88/46 mm
Hg, his heart rate 186 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute,
and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. He is mildly anxious but otherwise in
no acute distress. He does not have any jugular venous distention. His lungs are
clear to auscultation, and his heart sounds are regular without any murmurs, rubs,
or gallops. There is no lower extremity edema, and peripheral pulses are equal in
all four extremities. The cardiac monitor reveals a regular rhythm with narrow-QRS
complexes at a rate of 180 to190 beats per minute.

ANSWERS TO CASE 4:
Regular Rate Tachycardia
Summary: This is a 25-year-old man with acute onset of palpitations and dizziness.
He is hypotensive and has a narrow-QRS complex tachycardia at a rate of 180 to
190 beats per minute.
• Most likely diagnosis: Supraventricular tachycardia.
• Most appropriate next step: Obtain IV access and a 12-lead ECG. Prepare for
synchronized cardioversion of this unstable patient with a tachyarrhythmia.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the differential diagnosis for regular rate tachycardias.
2. Recognize the clinical signs and symptoms to differentiate between stable and
unstable patients with regular rate tachycardias.
3. Understand the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to regular rate tachycardias.

Considerations
When evaluating a patient with a tachyarrhythmia, assessment of the patient’s stability is paramount. Unstable patients will require immediate synchronized cardioversion.
Stable patients may be able to be managed medically. All patients will require continuous cardiac monitoring, intravenous (IV) access, and a 12-lead ECG. Regular rate tachycardias include several types of supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia
(Table 4–1). As a general rule, narrow-QRS complex tachycardias arise from above the
ventricles while wide-QRS complex ones may be supraventricular or ventricular in origin.

APPROACH TO:
Regular Rate Tachycardia
CLINICAL APPROACH
Patients with tachyarrhythmias may present with a host of complaints including
palpitations, fatigue, and weakness. Other symptoms may suggest a component of
hypoperfusion (dizziness, near syncope, or syncope) or cardiac ischemia (chest pain,
dyspnea). If the patient is stable enough for a complete history to be performed,
the history should also include information about the time and circumstances surrounding symptom onset, duration of symptoms, past medical history (eg, history
of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, dysrhythmia, valvular disease,
thyroid disease), current medications (including herbal or homeopathic regimens,
over-the-counter medicines, and illicit drugs), and family history (eg, sudden cardiac
death, dysrhythmia, other types of heart disease).
The physical examination will initially focus on assessing the patient’s stability
and adequacy of the ABCs. Any evidence of hypotension, pulmonary edema, acutely
altered mental status, or ischemic chest pain indicates that the patient is unstable
and treatment must be initiated immediately (see treatment section below). Once
the patient is stabilized, a complete head-to-toe examination can be performed. Special consideration should be given to the cardiovascular and lung components of the
examination: auscultating heart sounds for gallops, murmurs, and rubs; palpating for
the point of maximal impulse and any heaves; inspecting for jugular venous distention; listening for any rales or other findings of volume overload; assessing the quality of peripheral pulses. The examination may also reveal clues regarding underlying
causes of tachycardia (eg, pale mucous membranes with anemia; thyromegaly or
goiter with thyrotoxicosis, barrel chest or nail clubbing with chronic lung disease).
A 12-lead ECG is ostensibly the most useful diagnostic test when evaluating a
patient with a tachyarrhythmia (Figures 4–1 and 4–2). These arrhythmias may be
separated into regular and irregular rate tachycardias as well as narrow- or wideQRS (>0.12 s) complex (see Table 4–1). As a general rule, narrow-QRS complex
tachycardias arise from above the ventricles while wide-QRS complex ones may be
supraventricular or ventricular in origin.
Table 4–2 lists the distinguishing ECG characteristics of the various types of regular rate tachycardias.
Ventricular tachycardia (VT) may be difficult to differentiate from a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction. Certain factors favor VT,
including age ≥50, history of coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure, history of VT, atrioventricular dissociation, fusion beats, QRS >0.14 second, extreme
left axis deviation, and precordial concordance (QRS complexes either all positive
or all negative). In contrast, age ≤35, history of SVT, preceding ectopic P waves with
QRS complexes, QRS <0.14 second, normal or almost normal axis, and slowing
or cessation of the arrhythmia with vagal maneuvers suggest SVT with aberrancy.
If the provider cannot distinguish between VT and SVT with aberrancy with certainty, the patient should be treated as if VT is present.

hypomagnesemia). If the clinical scenario is suggestive, thyroid function studies (for
hyperthyroidism), drug levels (eg, digoxin), or urine drug screen (for cocaine, methamphetamines, other stimulants) may be warranted.

hypoxic or in respiratory distress, supplemental oxygen and airway support are indicated. If the patient is unstable (as evidenced by hypotension, pulmonary edema,
altered mental status, or ischemic chest pain), synchronized cardioversion should be
performed immediately. If time allows, sedation should be given prior to cardioversion.
In stable patients, a 12-lead ECG should be obtained, and medical therapy can
be initiated. Potential interventions for regular narrow-complex tachyarrhythmias include vagal maneuvers (such as carotid massage and Valsalva), adenosine,
β-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers. Although vagal maneuvers will not terminate tachyarrhythmias that do not involve the AV node, they may slow the rate
enough to unmask the underlying rhythm abnormality. Stable patients with regular
wide-complex tachycardias may benefit from amiodarone, procainamide, or sotalol.
Second-line therapy for stable patients with monomorphic VT is lidocaine.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

A. Synchronized cardioversion
B. Valsalva maneuver
C. Discharge home and follow up within the next 48 hours

What are you most likely to see on the ECG?
A. Sinus tachycardia
B. SVT
C. VT
D. Atrial fibrillation

ANSWERS
4.1 D. One must characterize the rhythm before initiating treatment.
4.2 A. Nonsustained VT is by deﬁnition a self-terminating event, and therefore
usually no speciﬁc treatment is indicated. Rather, treatment is directed at any
existing heart condition.
4.3 D. AV nodal blocking maneuvers include Valsalva, diving reﬂex, and carotid
massage. They act through the parasympathetic nervous system. If an SVT
involves the AV node, slowing conduction through the node can terminate the
arrhythmia. SVTs that do not involve the AV node will not usually be terminated by AV nodal blocking maneuvers. However, these maneuvers may still
cause a transient AV block and unmask the underlying rhythm abnormality.
4.4 C. Classically atrial ﬂutter presents with a saw tooth pattern on ECG. The rate
of 150 bpm denotes that it’s likely a 2:1 conduction block.
4.5 A. The most common regular rate tachycardia is sinus tachycardia.

CASE 5
A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department (ED) with diffuse
abdominal pain, vomiting, and altered level of consciousness. The patient’s symptoms began several days ago, when he complained of “the flu.” His symptoms
at that time included profound fatigue, nausea, mild abdominal discomfort and
some urinary frequency. Today he was found in bed moaning but otherwise unresponsive. His past medical history is unremarkable, and he is currently taking
no medications. On physical examination, the patient appears pale and ill. His
temperature is 36.0°C (96.8°F), pulse rate is 140 beats per minute, blood pressure
is 82/40 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 40 breaths per minute. His head and
neck examination shows dry mucous membranes and sunken eyes; there is an
unusual odor to his breath. The lungs are clear bilaterally with increased rate and
depth of respiration. The cardiac examination reveals tachycardia, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation, with hypoactive
bowel sounds and involuntary guarding. The rectal examination is normal. Skin
is cool and dry with decreased turgor. On neurologic examination, the patient
moans and localizes pain but does not speak coherently. Laboratory studies: the
leukocyte count is 16,000 cells/uL, and the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are
normal. Electrolytes reveal a sodium of 124 mEq/L, potassium 3.4 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, and bicarbonate 6 mEq/L. BUN and creatinine are mildly elevated.
The serum glucose is 740 mg/dL (41.1 mmol/L). The serum amylase, bilirubin,
AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase are within normal limits. A 12-lead ECG shows
sinus tachycardia. His CXR is normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 5:
Diabetic Ketoacidosis
Summary: This is a 19-year-old man with acute diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient
has new-onset diabetes mellitus. The constellation of severe hyperglycemia, aniongap acidosis, and ketosis (manifested by the breath odor) is diagnostic. The other
findings of dehydration, hyponatremia, hypotension, altered level of consciousness,
and diffuse abdominal pain, are typical of a particularly severe episode of diabetic
ketoacidosis.
• Most likely diagnosis: Diabetic ketoacidosis
• Next step: Management of the ABCs, including fluid resuscitation, the initiation of insulin therapy, and a careful search for any precipitating or concomitant
illness.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical settings, the signs and symptoms, and complications of
diabetic ketoacidosis.
2. Understand the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to suspected diabetic
ketoacidosis.

Considerations
This patient’s clinical presentation is typical for diabetic ketoacidosis. Morbidity may
result from either underlying precipitating conditions, or from delayed or inadequate
treatment. Prompt recognition, effective resuscitation, and diligent attention to fluid,
electrolyte, and insulin replacement are essential. (Table 5–1 lists typical laboratory
values in DKA). A comprehensive and thoughtful search for associated illnesses,
along with frequent reassessment of the patient, will lead to the best outcome.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Diabetic Ketoacidosis
CLINICAL APPROACH
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a metabolic emergency. A delay in treatment leads to
increased morbidity and mortality. In up to one-quarter of patients, DKA is the initial presentation of type I diabetes, so lack of a diabetic history cannot exclude the
diagnosis. Most cases occur in patients with type I diabetes, though some patients
with type II diabetes may develop DKA during severe physiologic stress. Some
patients will present with the classical symptoms of diabetes, such as polyuria, polydipsia, and fatigue. Others will complain more of dyspnea related to the metabolic
acidosis, or of the idiopathic but often severe abdominal pain that frequently accompanies DKA. Patients with an underlying infection or other precipitating illness
may have symptoms predominantly from that process. As in our case presentation,
some patients have such an altered sensorium that a history is entirely unobtainable.
DKA results from an absolute or severe relative lack of insulin, leading to a starvation state at the cellular level. Gluconeogenesis is stimulated even as glucose utilization falls. Hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis cause a profound osmotic diuresis and
massive fluid shifts. The diuresis and acidosis cause severe electrolyte disturbances,
with wasting of sodium, potassium, magnesium and phosphate. Acidosis, dehydration, hyperosmolality, and insulin deficiency can lead to potassium shifts into the
extracellular space, so patients may have significant serum hyperkalemia at presentation, even with massive total body deficits of potassium. Nausea and vomiting can be severe and further cloud the clinical picture with variable superimposed
acid-base and electrolyte disturbances.
Diagnosis is based on the triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis.
The major differential diagnosis is hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), which
can present with very high glucose but slight or no acidosis. Starvation, pregnancy,
alcoholic ketoacidosis, and various toxic ingestions can present with elevated serum
ketones, but the glucose is normal or low. Patients can be rapidly screened for DKA
with a bedside blood glucose measurement and a dipstick urinalysis. Except for the rare
anuric patient, the absence of ketones in the urine reliably excludes the diagnosis of
DKA. Serum ketones are commonly measured to confirm the diagnosis, but the absolute value is not as helpful because most labs measure only one of the several ketone
bodies that may be present. Table 5–2 is a guide to the differential diagnosis of DKA.
Most patients with recurrent DKA have an underlying cause of the episode, and
all symptoms require a thorough investigation. In some studies, less than 10% of
episodes had no underlying illness. Infection is the most frequent trigger of DKA,
but it has resulted from pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, stroke, and many drugs
including corticosteroids, thiazides, sympathomimetics including cocaine, and some
antipsychotic drugs. In children and adolescents, voluntary cessation of insulin for
psychosocial reasons is a frequent and serious cause of DKA.
Patients in DKA can have massive fluid deficits, sometimes as much as 5 to 10 L.
Shock is fairly common, and must be promptly treated with crystalloid infusion to

prevent further organ damage. Adults with clinical shock should receive an initial
2-L bolus of normal saline with frequent reassessment. In children, shock is treated
with boluses of 20 mL/kg of normal saline. Although overaggressive hydration can
present substantial complications later in the course of treatment, this concern takes
a back seat to the reversal of shock. Untreated shock promotes multiple-organ dysfunction and contributes further to the severe acidosis seen in DKA.
Insulin is absolutely required to reverse ketoacidosis. Regular insulin is usually
given by continuous IV infusion, though frequent IV boluses may be nearly as effective. Intramuscular injections are painful and less reliably absorbed when the patient
is in shock. There is no role for long-acting insulin until the ketoacidotic state has
resolved. (There are proposed protocols for treating mild and recurrent episodes of
DKA with subcutaneous regular insulin, but those protocols have not yet been
widely adopted.) The combination of rehydration and insulin will commonly lower
the serum glucose much faster than ketones are cleared. Regardless, insulin infusion
should continue until the anion gap has returned to normal. Dextrose should be
added to the IV infusion when the serum glucose falls to 200 to 300 mg/dL (11.1-16.7
mmol/L) to prevent hypoglycemia, a common complication of treatment.
An insulin dose of 0.1 U/kg/h (5-10 U/h in the adult) is adequate for almost
all clinical situations. This is sufficient to achieve maximum physiologic effect.
Higher doses are no more effective, but do cause a higher rate of hypoglycemia.
An initial bolus of insulin, equal to 1-hour infusion, is commonly given but has not
been shown to hasten recovery or provide any other benefit. Insulin boluses are not
recommended in pediatric patients. Insulin does bind readily to common medical
plastics, so IV tubing should be thoroughly flushed with the drip solution at the start
of therapy.
Patients in DKA generally have massive total body deficits of water, sodium,
potassium, magnesium, phosphate, and other electrolytes. Specific laboratory values
may vary widely depending on the patient’s intake, gastrointestinal and other losses,
medications, and comorbid illnesses. It is not usually necessary to calculate exact
sodium and water deficits and replacements, except in cases of severe renal failure.
Simply reverse shock with normal saline, and then continue an infusion of halfnormal saline at two to three times maintenance. Remember that glucose should be
added before the serum glucose falls to the normal range, usually when the glucose
level reaches 250 mg/dL.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

65

Potassium deficits are usually quite large, yet the serum potassium at presentation
may be low, normal, or even high. If the potassium is elevated initially, look for and
treat any hyperkalemic changes on the ECG. Give fluids without potassium until
the serum K reaches the normal range, and then add potassium to the IV infusion.
If the initial serum K is normal or low, potassium replacement can be started immediately. Magnesium supplementation may be necessary to help the patient retain
potassium. Phosphate replacement has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes, but extremely low phosphate levels (<1.0 mg/dL) are known to cause muscle
weakness and possibly rhabdomyolysis. For such patients, some of the potassium can
be given in the form of potassium phosphate.
Because metabolic acidosis is such a prominent feature in DKA, some clinicians
have administered substantial doses of sodium bicarbonate. Many studies have failed
to demonstrate any improvement from this treatment even at surprisingly low serum
pH values, but even skeptical physicians sometimes encounter a patient who is so
acidotic that they feel compelled to give bicarbonate. There are multiple theoretical
and observed complications from bicarbonate, including hypernatremia, hypokalemia, paradoxical CSF acidosis, and residual systemic alkalosis. Of course, in the case
of hyperkalemia, bicarbonate might be lifesaving and should not be withheld.
Cerebral edema is a rare but devastating complication of DKA, seen most often
and most severely in children. It almost always occurs during treatment, and is a
leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric DKA. It has been ascribed to
the development of cryptogenic osmoles in the CNS to counter dehydration, which
then draw water intracellularly during treatment, but this remains unproven. It has
been variously associated with overhydration and vigorous insulin therapy, leading
many pediatric centers to use extremely conservative, slow and low-dose treatment
protocols for DKA. However, at least one large well-controlled study showed that
the only reliable predictor of cerebral edema was the severity of metabolic derangements at presentation. Concern for cerebral edema should never be used as an
excuse for the undertreatment of clinical shock. Once shock is reversed, pediatric
DKA patients should be managed in consultation with an experienced pediatric
endocrinologist or intensivist.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

5.2 A 28-year-old insulin-requiring woman is found in her apartment by her husband. She is stuporous and cannot provide any history. EMS is called and takes
the patient to the emergency center, and a diagnosis of severe DKA is made.
Her blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg and heart rate 140 beats per minute. The
glucose level is 950 mg/dL, potassium level 6 mEq/L, HCO3 4 mEq/L. Which of
the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?
A. Administer 20 units regular insulin intramuscularly, and normal saline at
250 mL/h.
B. Begin an intravenous dopamine drip to raise BP above 90, then insulin at
10 U/h.
C. Initiate normal saline 2 L with KCl 20 mEq/L, insulin 10 U/h.
D. Provide an intravenous normal saline 2 L bolus, and start an insulin drip at
10 U/h.
5.3 The patient in Question 5.2 is undergoing therapy. Which of the following
principles is most accurate in the treatment of DKA?
A. Isotonic saline with no dextrose should be used during the hospitalization
because the patient is diabetic.
B. Typically, intravenous insulin and dextrose solution will need to be continued until the acidosis has resolved.
C. Potassium replacement is rarely necessary.
D. Sodium bicarbonate is helpful to resolve the anion gap more quickly.
5.4 The physician explains to a 25-year-old man who has recently been hospitalized
with DKA that patients in DKA often have other illnesses or precipitating factors that initiated the ketoacidosis. Which of the following is the most common
underlying etiology in DKA?
A. Asthmatic exacerbation
B. Cocaine use
C. Cholecystititis
D. Missed insulin doses
E. Urinary tract infection

ANSWERS
5.1 C. The triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis is diagnostic of DKA. Many
other conditions cause one or two of the triad, but not all three. Although a
fruity breath odor may suggest acetone, it is not reliably present and not all
clinicians can distinguish it.
5.2 D. Fluid resuscitation via isotonic crystalloid solution to reverse shock, and
IV insulin to reverse ketoacidosis, are the mainstays of therapy. Though most
patients will require potassium, it should not be given while the serum K is
elevated, and typically not until urine output is seen. Pressors have a limited
role until the intravascular volume is restored.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

67

5.3 B. The serum glucose often drops much more rapidly than the ketoacidosis
resolves; insulin is necessary to metabolize the ketone bodies but dextrose prevents hypoglycemia. Potassium replacement is usually necessary, but should
wait until hyperkalemia is excluded. Bicarbonate does not hasten resolution of
DKA.
5.4 E. Many serious illnesses can precipitate an episode of DKA in the susceptible patient, including infection, stroke, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis,
trauma, and surgery. Associated or precipitating illness should always be sought
diligently. Urinary tract infection is the single most common underlying cause.
Missed insulin doses are also common, but less common than infection.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis confirm the diagnosis of DKA and
are enough to start fluids and insulin.



Patients in DKA are almost always dehydrated and have significant
sodium and potassium deficits, regardless of their specific laboratory
values.



Abdominal pain is a common feature in DKA and is usually idiopathic,
especially in younger patients.



CASE 6
A 73-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department (ED) from an
assisted-living facility. The patient has a history of dementia, hypertension, and
type II diabetes mellitus. By report, she has had chills and a productive cough
for several days. In the past 24 hours she has become weaker and does not want
to get out of bed. The physical examination reveals a thin, elderly woman who is
somnolent but arousable. Her rectal temperature is 36.0°C (96.8°F), pulse rate
is 118 beats per minute, blood pressure is 84/50 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is
22 breaths per minute. Her mucous membranes are dry. Her heart is tachycardic
but regular. She has crackles at her right lung base with a scant wheeze. Her abdomen is soft and nontender. The extremities feel cool and her pulses are rapid and
thready. The patient is moving all extremities, without focal deficits.

ANSWERS TO CASE 6:
Severe Sepsis
Summary: A 73-year-old woman presents from an assisted-living facility with cough,
lethargy, and hypotension of unknown etiology.
• Most likely diagnosis: Severe sepsis due to healthcare-associated pneumonia

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn to recognize the clinical presentations of systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis and the atypical presentations in children and the elderly.
2. Learn the pathophysiology, systemic effects, and management of sepsis and its
common complications.
3. Become familiar with early goal-directed therapy in the treatment of sepsis and
septic shock.

Considerations
This woman appears to be suffering from severe sepsis, a clinical entity on the continuum
from systemic inflammatory response syndrome to septic shock with multiorgan system
dysfunction (see below for definitions). In her case, the etiology is likely pneumonia, an
extremely common cause of sepsis in elderly patients. Sepsis caused by a urinary tract
infection (ie, urosepsis) is another important cause of sepsis in this population.
There are over 750,000 cases of sepsis in the United States each year. Overall
mortality is 30% and, while the mortality rate has been decreasing, the rise in number of cases has led to an increase in the total number of deaths caused by sepsis: the
most recent US figures attribute >215,000 deaths annually to sepsis. As this woman
falls into the classification of septic shock, her risk of death may be closer to 70%,
even with treatment.
The current standard of care for treating sepsis uses an algorithm known as early
goal-directed therapy (EGDT), which has been shown to dramatically improve
hemodynamic outcomes and mortality (see below).

APPROACH TO:
Severe Sepsis
DEFINITIONS
SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SYNDROME (SIRS): At least
two of the following:

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

71

• Temperature >38°C or <36°C
• Heart rate >90 beats per minute
• Tachypnea or hyperventilation (respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute or Paco2
<32 mm Hg)
• White blood cell count >12,000 cells/mL or <4000 cells/mL, or >10% bands
SEPSIS: SIRS with an infectious source.
SEVERE SEPSIS: Sepsis in conjunction with at least one sign of organ failure or
hypoperfusion, such as lactic acidosis (lactate ≥4 mmol/L), oliguria (urine output
≤0.5 mL/kg for 1 hour), abrupt change in mental status, mottled skin or delayed
capillary refill, thrombocytopenia (platelets ≤ 100,000 cells/mL) or disseminated
intravascular coagulation, or acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome.
SEPTIC SHOCK: Severe sepsis with hypotension (or requirement of vasoactive
agents, eg, dopamine or norepinephrine) despite adequate fluid resuscitation in the
form of a 20- to 40-cc/kg bolus.
MULTIORGAN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME (MODS): MODS is the far
end of the spectrum that begins with SIRS. It is defined as dysfunction of two or more
organ systems such that homeostasis cannot be maintained without intervention.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Sepsis is usually caused by bacterial infection (see Table 6–1 for common bacterial
causes of infection). However, it may be caused by viral or, increasingly, by fungal infection. In general, sepsis is a complex interaction between the direct toxic
effects of the infecting organism and derangement of the normal inflammatory host
response to infection.
Normally, in the setting of infection, there is concurrent local activation of the
immune system and of down-regulatory mechanisms to control the reaction. The
devastating effects of the sepsis syndrome are caused by a combination of (1) generalization of the immune response to sites remote from that of the infection and
(2) derangement of the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory
cellular regulators, as well as (3) dissemination of the infecting organism.
In general, the immune response to infection optimizes the ability of immune
cells to leave the circulation and enter the site of infection. Microbial antigens trigger local cells to release proinflammatory cytokines. These molecules attract leukocytes, slow blood flow through venules and capillaries, and trigger dilation of vessels
and increased “leakiness” of vessel walls. At the same time, the cytokines induce
the release and production of acute-phase reactants, which fight microbes but are
also procoagulants. It is when the two main effects of the inflammatory cascade—
vasodilation and coagulation—spread beyond the site of local infection that the
syndrome of sepsis manifests in systemic hypotension, hypoperfusion, coagulopathy,
and resultant organ failure. In the face of hypoperfusion and lack of oxygen, organs
are forced to use anaerobic metabolism, leading to an elevation in serum lactic acid.

The degree of elevation correlates strongly with prognosis: higher presenting lactate
levels and slow decline of lactate during resuscitation are associated with significantly higher mortality.

Clinical Presentation
Sepsis begins with signs of a systemic inflammatory response (ie, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis) and progresses to hypotension in the setting of either
peripheral vasodilation (“warm” or hyperdynamic septic shock, with generalized
flushing and warmth and increased cardiac output) or peripheral vasoconstriction

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

73

(“cold” or hypodynamic septic shock, with cold blue or white extremities). In a
patient with this presentation and physical examination findings consistent with
infection, diagnosis is easy and treatment can be begun early.
It is important to remember that, especially in infants and the elderly, initial
presentation may lack some of the more salient features—that is, they may present
with hypothermia rather than hyperthermia, leukopenia rather than leukocytosis,
and they may not be able to mount a tachycardia (as in elderly patients on β- or
calcium-channel blockers) or they may have a tachycardia attributed to other
causes (as in anxious infants). In a patient at the extremes of age, any nonspecific
systemic complaint—vomiting, fatigue, behavioral changes—should prompt concern for sepsis, and consideration of at least initial screens for infection, such as a
chest radiograph and urinalysis.
Be aware that a patient not initially meeting the criteria for sepsis may progress
to full-blown sepsis even during the course of an emergency department stay, with
initially only subtle changes in examination. Altered mental status is often the first
sign of organ dysfunction, as it is assessable without laboratory studies, but it is easily missed in the elderly, the very young, and those with other potential causes for
altered level of consciousness, such as intoxication. Decreased urine output (≤0.5
mL/kg/h) is another sign that may be apparent prior to the return of laboratory values and should raise clinical concern.

Evaluation/Management
Initial Treatment Considerations The patient should immediately be placed on
a cardiac and pulse-oxygenation monitor, and a manual blood pressure obtained.
Supplemental oxygen by nasal canula or facemask should be titrated to keep oxygen
saturation >93%, two large-bore, peripheral IVs should rapidly be inserted, and, in
the absence of a ﬂuid overload condition (eg, congestive heart failure, renal failure)
a ﬂuid bolus of 20 to 40 mL/kg (2-4 L in adults) crystalloid administered (Table 6–2).
If available, a point of care lactic acid should be obtained without delay. Ideally, it
should be obtained prior to the initial ﬂuid bolus; however, this should under no circumstances cause a delay resuscitation. If the patient clearly has severely increased
work of breathing or cannot protect her airway, the patient should be intubated,
with care taken with selection of induction agents, as many cause hypotension.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Blood should be drawn for a complete blood count (with differential), comprehensive metabolic panel, blood cultures (two sets), and lactic acid (if not already
obtained). A urinalysis with culture and chest x-ray should be ordered immediately
as part of what must be an aggressive search for the source of the infection (the
majority of sepsis in this country is caused by either pneumonia or urinary tract
infections). An ECG should also be ordered early in the workup, to evaluate for
cardiac ischemia secondary to hypoperfusion.
Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be started rapidly—ideally after
the cultures have been drawn, but antibiotic infusion should not be delayed if cultures cannot be obtained in a timely fashion (<1 h after presentation), particularly
in a patient like this one, who is extremely ill and hemodynamically unstable. Initial
therapy should be empiric, with good coverage for all possible sites and organisms, as
there is good evidence that inappropriate antibiotic selection doubles mortality (see
Table 6–1 for suggested antibiotics).

Subsequent Priorities Immediately upon termination of the ﬁrst ﬂuid bolus, the
patient should be reassessed. If the patient continues to be hypotensive or has a
lactate level greater than 4 mmol/dL or has other signs of continued hypoperfusion,
then early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) should be initiated. EGDT is a method
of continual assessment and reassessment of clinical and laboratory markers, with
interventions aimed at normalizing those markers. The overarching goal of EGDT
is to eliminate mismatch between oxygen demand and oxygen supply (the hallmark
of sepsis) by increasing supply and—where possible—by decreasing demand.
Early Goal-Directed Therapy
Goal 1: central venous pressure (CVP) 8-12 mm Hg: CVP should be kept between
8 and 12 mm Hg (or >12 mm Hg if mechanically ventilated), with continued fluid
boluses (which may total as much as 6 to 10 L of crystalloid over the first hours) to
maintain an adequate CVP. In practice, 500 cc of normal saline can be bolused every
15 to 30 minutes until the CVP goal is met.
Goal 2: mean arterial pressure (MAP) ê65 mm Hg: If the patient’s MAP remains
<65 mm Hg despite adequate fluid resuscitation, vasopressors should be initiated,
with either norepinephrine or dopamine usually recommended as the starting
agents. They should be titrated to a goal of MAP ≥65 mm Hg. If blood pressure is
unresponsive to the first vasopressor, a second agent may be added. Low-dose vasopressin can be used as a second- or third-line agent.
Goal 3: central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) ê70%: On placement of the
central line, blood obtained should be sent for an oxygen saturation. If the ScvO2
is ≤70% (meaning the tissues are extracting as much oxygen as possible from the
blood, and therefore that tissue demand is not being met), then oxygen delivery
should be optimized by
• Transfusing packed red blood cells to a hematocrit ≥30%.
• If the ScvO2 continues to be <70% despite achieving CVP 8 to 12 mm Hg, MAP
≥65 mm Hg, and HCT ≥30%, then dobutamine infusion should be started to
boost cardiac output.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

75

• If all of the above measures are taken and ScvO2 continues to be <70%, then
patient can be intubated to maximize oxygenation and sedated in an attempt to
decrease oxygen demand.
Additional goal: lactate clearance of ê10%: An initial lactate should be sent in
every patient with suspected sepsis. After a minimum of 2 hours of resuscitation a
repeat lactate should be checked to ensure that at least 10% of the lactate has been
cleared. If the lactate clearance is not at least 10% then oxygen delivery should be
optimized in much the same way that is described in the ScvO2 section by
• Transfusing packed red blood cells if the hematocrit is <30%.
• If there is not a lactate clearance of at least 10% after transfusion then dobutamine infusion should be started and titrated to achieve a 10% clearance.
If a 10% clearance is not achieved, lactate levels should be checked at 1 to
2 hour intervals and repeat clearance calculated each time. New data show that
in hospitals where ScvO2 cannot easily be monitored, lactate can be used in lieu of
ScvO2 monitoring.
A patient in severe sepsis or septic shock should be admitted to an intensive care
unit. Throughout her stay in the emergency department, she should be frequently
reassessed, using measurements of blood pressure, central venous pressure, oxygen
saturation, central venous saturation, urine output, and lactate to direct therapy. If
severe sepsis progresses to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, therapy includes support or replacement of the affected organs/systems as indicated below under complications.

Other Therapies/Interventions
Ultrasound: Is a noninvasive method that can be used to monitor CVP that does
not require placement of a central venous catheter thus avoiding the time delay and
catheter-associated complications. Studies have looked at using compression ultrasound of the forearm or measurement of the internal jugular vein to approximate
CVP. In the hands of a well-trained sonographer this can be used as a noninvasive
way to estimate central venous catheter.
Steroids: While historically steroids have been used in sepsis, their role is becoming
more limited. Recent published data suggest that even “physiologic doses” of steroids
do not improve overall mortality in severe sepsis. It is not recommended that they be
used in sepsis without shock unless there is a recent history of prolonged steroid use
or history suggesting adrenal suppression. In the case of septic shock unresponsive to
fluid resuscitation and vasopressors, steroids may be considered.
Activated protein C: Protein C is an enzyme produced in the liver that inhibits
thrombosis and promotes fibrinolysis. A patient’s native ability to activate protein C
appears to be impaired in sepsis. Given the contribution of coagulopathy and
impaired microvascular circulation to mortality in sepsis, it was theorized that exogenous activated protein C might be helpful. There is some evidence that it may
decrease mortality in patients who have severe sepsis and have a high risk of death,
but it does not benefit patients at low risk of death. Therefore, it should only be
given to patients with sepsis-induced organ dysfunction that are deemed to be at a

76

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

high risk of death. It should not be given if there are contraindications to anticoagulation (ie, active bleeding, risk of bleeding, history of intracranial bleeding, etc).
The use of activated protein C is never recommended in children.
Glucose control: This is an area of recent controversy. For a period of time it was
thought that there was benefit to maintaining tight control of blood glucose in the
range of 80 to 120 mg/dL. However, more recent studies have shown that glucose
control this tight leads to significantly more severe hypoglycemia. Therefore, we recommend that in sepsis a patient’s glucose goals should be between 140 and 180 mg/dL.
Intravenous immunoglobulin: In children, administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in both neonates and older children has been shown in some
studies to result in improvement in mortality and fewer complications, although
a recent meta-analysis was inconclusive as to IVIGs benefit in sepsis. Its presumed
mechanism of action is augmented clearance of pathogenic organisms and feedback
inhibition of inflammatory cytokines.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO), a form of mechanical heart-lung bypass, has been used in septic shock in
children with unclear results. It may be tried, when available, to treat a patient in
cardiorespiratory failure that is refractory to traditional means of support.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (“statins”): HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors,
or statins, are lipid-lowering agents that are thought to have a significant antiinflammatory component. Animal studies have shown increased survival from
sepsis with administration of statins, and there is evidence from observational studies
that being on a statin lowers human patients’ likelihood of death from sepsis. Statins
are relatively safe and inexpensive drugs. If forthcoming studies show benefit, statins
may become a standard component of the treatment of sepsis.

Complications
ALI and ARDS (acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome): The
inflammatory milieu of sepsis is especially damaging to the lungs. Buildup of inflammatory fluid in the alveoli impairs gas exchange favors lung collapse, and decreases
compliance, with the end result of respiratory distress and hypoxemia. ALI/ARDS
is a common complication of severe sepsis and is often visible on chest x-ray, in the
form of bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. A septic
patient who did not initially require mechanical ventilation may later require it if
she develops ALI/ARDS after fluid resuscitation. In such cases, low tidal volumes
(ie, tidal volume set initially to 8 mL/kg then titrated down to 6 mL/kg in the first
couple hours of therapy) should be used, with measures taken to limit peak inspiratory pressures and thus limit barotrauma to the lung—a significant risk.
DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation): In DIC caused by sepsis, the coagulation cascade is diffusely activated as part of the inflammatory response. At the
same time, the fibrinolytic system, which normally acts to keep the clotting cascade
in check, is activated. These factors begin a feedback spiral in which both systems
are constantly and diffusely activated—new clots always being formed, then broken
down. A large proportion of the body’s clotting factors and platelets are consumed

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

77

in such clots. Thus, patients are at risk for complications from both thrombosis and
hemorrhage. In this setting, platelets may be given if the platelet count is <5000
cells/mm3 without signs of bleeding, or <30,000 cells/mm3 with active bleeding.
Fresh-frozen plasma should be given if there is active bleeding. The development of
any coagulopathy in sepsis correlates with a worse outcome.
Cardiac failure: Myocardial depression is an early complication of septic shock, with
the mechanism thought to be direct action of inflammatory molecules rather than
decreased perfusion of coronary arteries. Supporting the heart’s function involves
careful attention to preload (hydration with close monitoring of CVP), afterload
(vasopressors), and contractility (supported with dobutamine). Sepsis places an
unprecedented workload on a heart, which can precipitate acute coronary syndrome
or a myocardial infarction, especially in the elderly. Thus inotropic agents and vasopressors (most of which can result in tachycardia) must be used with care when
necessary but never when unwarranted.
Hepatic failure: Liver failure usually manifests as cholestatic jaundice, with increases
in bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase. Synthetic function is usually not affected unless patients are hemodynamically unstable for long periods.
Renal failure: Hypoperfusion appears to be the main mechanism for renal failure
in the setting of sepsis, which is manifested by oliguria, azotemia, and inflammatory
cells on urinalysis. The treatment is first to adequately support perfusion with hydration and vasopressors. However, if the renal failure is severe or the kidneys cannot be
adequately perfused, then renal replacement therapy (eg, hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is indicated.
Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome: Dysfunction of two or more organ systems such
that intervention is required to maintain homeostasis.
• Primary—in which failure of organs is directly caused by infection or injury of
them; that is, heart/lung failure in the setting of severe pneumonia
• Secondary—in which failure of organs is caused by generalized inflammatory
response to an insult; that is, ALI or ARDS in the setting of urosepsis

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
6.1 A 32-year-old woman is noted to have persistent hypotension from suspected

E. Activated protein C.

78

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

6.2 A 45-year-old man with acute cholecystitis is noted to have a fever of 38.3°C
(101°F), hypotension, and altered sensorium. His HCT is noted to be 24%.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous saline are administered, and,
although his CVP is 10 and his MAP is 80, his ScvO2 remains <70%. Which of
the following is most likely to be beneﬁcial?
A. Initiate corticosteroids
B. Tight glucose control
C. Acetaminophen 500 mg PR
D. Transfusion
E. Lithotripsy
6.3 A 32-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for acute pyelonephritis. The
patient is treated with oral ciproﬂoxacin. After 4 days of therapy, she returns
to the ED with persistent fever to 38.9°C (102°F) and ﬂank tenderness. The
urine culture reveals E coli greater than 100,000 colony-forming units per mL
susceptible to ciproﬂoxacin. When you arrive to examine her, you note that she
is tachypneic, tachycardiac, and appears lethargic. Which of the following is
the next step?
A. Order an intravenous pyelogram.
B. Obtain IV access and administer a fluid bolus.
C. Initiate a workup for fictitious fever.
D. Consult a surgeon for possible appendicitis.
E. Add antifungal therapy.
6.4 A 66-year-old woman is noted to have acute pneumococcal pneumonia and
is being treated with antibiotics, and with norepinephrine and dobutamine to
maintain her BP and urine output. Which of the following is a bad prognostic
sign?
A. Urine output of 1 mL/kg/h
B. Mean arterial blood pressure of 80 mm Hg
C. Lactic acid level of 6 mmol/dL
D. Serum bicarbonate level of 22 mEq/L
E. Hematocrit 35%

ANSWERS
6.1 B. A vasopressor agent such as norepinephrine (or dopamine) is the treatment
of choice for hypotension that is unresponsive to intravenous saline infusion.
The use of colloids during resuscitation has not been shown to improve outcome compared to crystalloids. Fresh-frozen plasma is not indicated. There is
not enough information provided to asses if activated protein C is indicated.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

79

6.2 D. This patient has met two of the three goals of EGDT, but fails to meet
the third goal of ScvO2 >70%. In the setting of HCT <30%, transfusion with
PRBCs is indicated. Tight glucose control and steroids have not been shown to
consistently improve mortality in all comers with severe sepsis.
6.3 B. This patient is progressing to severe sepsis, and possibly septic shock. While
an intravenous pyelogram may be needed eventually to rule out mechanical
obstruction (eg, an infected stone) as a cause of this patient’s refractory UTI,
the urgent need here is prompt ﬂuid resuscitation.
6.4 C. The elevated serum lactate is evidence that oxygen supply is not meeting
systemic oxygen demand. A lactate level ≥4 is a poor prognostic sign. The other
parameters are normal.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The most common causes of severe sepsis are urosepsis and pneumonia.



Older, younger, or immunocompromised individuals may present with
subtle signs such as lethargy, decreased appetite, or hypothermia.



Early goal-directed therapy for sepsis includes careful monitoring of multiple markers of organ perfusion, with aggressive measures to restore any
imbalance between oxygen supply and demand.



Initially, large volumes of fluid administered in multiple boluses may be
necessary (and in some cases sufficient) to maintain perfusion.



An early and thorough search for a source must be undertaken, with
immediate measures taken to control it. Whether or not an operable
source is found, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. If an operable source is found, it should be surgically treated as
soon as the patient can tolerate it.



A vasopressor agent such as norepinephrine or dopamine is the next step
in treating hypotension that persists despite intravenous fluids.

CASE 7
A 23-year-old man is transported to your emergency department (ED) from the
scene of a rollover motor vehicle collision (MVC). He was found approximately
1 hour after the accident had occurred. At the scene, the patient was awake and
complained of pain in his back and legs. In the ED, he is awake, his speech is clear
and appropriate, and he has normal breath sounds over bilateral lung fields. He
has palpable, equal bilateral femoral pulses. His temperature is 35.6°C (96.1°F)
(rectally), pulse rate is 106 beats per minute, blood pressure is 110/88 mm Hg,
respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and Glasgow coma scale is 15. Multiple
abrasions are noted over the neck, shoulders, abdomen, and legs. His chest wall is
nontender. His abdomen is mildly tender. The pelvis is stable, but he has extensive
swelling and tenderness of the right thigh. He has a deep scalp laceration over
his right temporal area that continues to ooze. A focused abdominal sonographic
examination trauma (FAST) is performed revealing free fluid in Morison pouch
and no other abnormalities. The patient’s initial complete blood count (CBC)
reveals a white blood cell count (WBC) of 14,800 cells/mm3, hemoglobin of 11.2
g/dL, and hematocrit of 34.4%.

ANSWERS TO CASE 7:
Hemorrhagic Shock
Summary: A healthy 23-year-old man presents following a motor vehicle accident
with mild tachycardia, scalp laceration, femur fracture, and a tender abdomen with
a positive FAST examination.
• Next step: The Emergency Medicine approach to every critically ill patient
begins with evaluation and stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC). This approach is also advocated by Advanced Trauma Life
Support (ATLS) guidelines. Once the ABCs are stabilized, a thorough secondary survey, consisting of a detailed physical examination, should follow. In this
patient, the ABCs are stable and the secondary survey reveals abdominal pain
and a likely right femur fracture with intact pulses. Immediately subsequent to
the secondary survey, the ultrasound examination demonstrates free fluid in
the hepatorenal potential space known as Morison pouch. Presence of fluid in
the hepatorenal space indicates intra-abdominal hemorrhage likely secondary
to solid organ injury. Since this patient is hemodynamically stable, a computed
tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be done to identify
and grade the severity of the injuries. In addition to estimating the amount of
intraperitoneal free fluid, the CT scan can aid in identifying the source of bleeding and the presence of other injuries that may have not been appreciated on
clinical examination. The limitations of CT scans in blunt trauma—mainly the
lower sensitivity for hollow organ injuries and bowel wall hematomas—should
be kept in mind when reviewing a CT scan in this setting.
• Most likely cause of hypotension: Hemorrhagic shock. The probable sources of
blood loss in this patient are thigh, abdomen, and scalp laceration. Other possible causes or contributors to his hypotension are cardiogenic shock secondary
to myocardial contusion or spinal shock secondary to injury to the spinal cord.
The latter can easily be ruled out by performing a neurologic examination during the secondary survey, or even as part of the disability evaluation during the
primary survey.

Initial Assessment of the Trauma Patient
The first priorities in the evaluation of any trauma patient are the ABCs. Airway
is assessed by asking the patient to state his or her name, followed by noting the presence or absence of tracheal deviation. If the patient is unable to protect his airway
because of confusion, loss of consciousness, or an extrinsic threat to the airway (ie,
expanding neck hematoma), the patient should be intubated with an endotracheal
tube. Next, breathing is assessed by listening to the chest for the presence of equal
bilateral breath sounds and by observing the symmetry of chest wall expansion.
The unstable patient with clinical signs of pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax
should be treated with immediate needle decompression followed by placement of
a chest tube. Finally, circulation is assessed via the vital signs and by palpation of
bilateral femoral, radial, or pedal pulses. Any suggestion of cardiovascular instability requires immediate crystalloid or colloid resuscitation through two large bore
peripheral IVs.
Next, the patient’s ability to follow commands should be evaluated and an
overall assessment of his/her level of functioning should be made. This consists of
assigning a score on the Glasgow coma scale, ranging from 3 to 15 (see also Table I–1
in Section I). Subsequently, a focused history should be quickly elicited. The mnemonic
“AMPLE” is useful for guiding the history taking (Table 7–1).
Based on the capability of your hospital and trauma or emergency services, bedside ultrasound can be incorporated into the initial evaluation of the trauma patient.

Aside from the FAST examination (assessment for free fluid in Morison pouch,
splenorenal and supra-splenic space, pelvis, and pericardial space), ultrasound can
be used for rapid identification of pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac activity, and
central line placement if needed. The use of ultrasound in the trauma patient is
operator-dependent.
The secondary survey follows, in which the patient is examined from head to toe.
In the presence of severe, obvious injuries, it is appropriate to start the examination at the affected sites. However, one must be cautious and diligent to complete
a thorough physical examination to preclude missing any less obvious but equally
important or potentially life-threatening injuries. Additional history from paramedics, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) should also be elicited.
In this patient, the entire history is very concerning. In addition to being ejected
from a vehicle involved in a collision at high speed, and therefore at risk for multisystem injuries secondary to a high kinetic energy transfer, the patient was found
1 hour following the incident. The risk for hypothermia and a diminished ability to
respond to hemorrhagic shock is great.

APPROACH TO:
Hemorrhagic Shock
DEFINITIONS
SHOCK: Insufficient cellular perfusion/inability to deliver sufficient oxygen to the
tissues.
HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK: Inadequate tissue oxygenation resulting from a blood
volume deficit. In this situation, the loss of blood volume decreases venous return,
cardiac filling pressures, and cardiac output. End-organ perfusion is subsequently
decreased as blood flow is preferentially preserved to the brain and heart.

CLINICAL APPROACH
In shock, the lack of oxygen available to cells results in an inability of mitochondria
to generate adequate ATP. Instead, anaerobic metabolism dominates, leading to an
accumulation of pyruvate that is converted to lactate.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

85

Shock is divided into three stages: Compensated, progressive, and irreversible.
Shock is initially compensated by control mechanisms that return cardiac output
and arterial pressure back to normal levels. Within seconds, baroreceptors and chemoreceptors elicit powerful sympathetic stimulation that vasoconstricts arterioles
and increases heart rate and cardiac contractility. After minutes to hours, angiotensin constricts the peripheral arteries while vasopressin constricts the veins to
maintain arterial pressures and improve blood return to the heart. Angiotensin and
vasopressin also increase water retention, thereby improving cardiac filling pressures. Locally, vascular control preferentially dilates vessels around the hypoxic tissues to increase blood flow to injured areas. The normal manifestations of shock
do not apply to pregnant women, athletes, and individuals with altered autonomic
nervous systems (older patients, those taking β-blockers).
As shock evolves into the progressive stage, arterial pressure falls. This leads to
cardiac depression from decreased coronary blood flow, and, in turn, further decreases
arterial pressure. The result is a feedback loop that becomes a vicious cycle toward
uncontrolled deterioration. Inadequate blood flow to the nervous system eventually
results in complete inactivation of sympathetic stimulation. In the microvasculature,
low blood flow causes the blood to sludge, amplifying the inadequate delivery of oxygen to the tissues. This ischemia results in increased microvascular permeability, and
large quantities of fluid and protein move from the intravascular space to the extravascular compartment, which exacerbates the already decreased intravascular volume.
The systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by severe injury and shock
may progress to multiorgan failure. Pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), poor cardiac contractility, loss of electrolyte and fluid control,
and inability to metabolize toxins and waste products set in. Cells lose the ability
to maintain electrolyte balance, metabolize glucose, maintain mitochondrial activity,
and prevent lysosomal release of hydrolases. Resuscitation during this progressive stage
of tissue ischemia can cause reperfusion injury from the burst of oxygen-free radicals.
Finally, the patient enters the irreversible stage of shock, and any therapeutic
efforts become futile. Despite transiently elevated arterial pressures and cardiac output, the body is unable to recover, and death becomes inevitable.

Pathophysiology and Stages of Hemorrhagic Shock
Hemorrhagic shock is the most common cause of death in trauma patients aside from
traumatic brain injury. A high level of suspicion for hemorrhage and hemorrhagic
shock should dominate evaluation of a trauma patient, especially as vital signs may
not become abnormal until a significant amount of hemorrhage has occurred. Hemorrhagic shock is classified by the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) into four
categories to further emphasize the progression of vital sign instability in response
to blood loss (Table 7–2). Additional clinical signs that indicate hemorrhagic shock
include skin pallor/coolness, delayed capillary refill, weak distal pulses, and anxiety.
As demonstrated by the ATLS classification of stages of hemorrhagic shock, the
clinician must not rely solely on vital signs for determination of extent of hemorrhage. This patient obviously has had some blood loss from his femur fracture,
and the focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) examination suggests intra-abdominal solid organ injury associated with additional hemorrhage.

Additionally, his scalp laceration must be evaluated as a potential source for serious
exsanguination. Despite these multiple sources of hemorrhage, our patient has a
normal blood pressure and only a slightly elevated heart rate, which places him in
Class II hemorrhagic shock.

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH
Identify the Source of Bleeding
A trauma patient should be carefully screened to locate the source of blood loss. In
this patient, the possibility of bleeding should be assessed in five areas: (1) external
bleeding (eg, scalp/extremity lacerations); (2) thorax (eg, hemothorax, aortic injury);
(3) peritoneal cavity (eg, solid organ lacerations, large vessel injury); (4) pelvis/
retroperitoneum (eg, pelvic fracture); and (5) soft-tissue compartments (eg, longbone fractures). Adjunctive studies that should be obtained in blunt trauma patients
early during their evaluation include chest and pelvic roentgenograms and computed
tomography (CT) scans of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Chest roentgenograms can identify a hemothorax and potential mediastinal bleeding. Pelvic films can
demonstrate pelvic fractures as a source of pelvic blood loss. Films of any affected
extremity, in this case the femur, should also be obtained. Fractures are not only associated with blood loss from the bone and adjacent soft tissue, but their presence indicates
significant energy transfer (often referred to as a significant mechanism of injury) and
should increase the clinical suspicion for intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal bleeding.
Typically, tibial or humeral fractures can be associated with 750 mL of blood loss
(1.5 units of blood), whereas femur fractures can be associated with up to 1500 mL of
blood (3 units of blood) in the thigh. Pelvic fractures may result in even more blood
loss—up to several liters can be lost into a retroperitoneal hematoma.

Laboratory Evaluation
Laboratory studies that aid (but are not necessary) in evaluating acute blood loss
are hemoglobin, hematocrit, base deficit, and lactate levels. In the setting of acute

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

87

hemorrhage, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels may or may not be decreased. These
values measure concentration, not absolute amounts. Hemoglobin is measured in
grams of red blood cells per deciliter of blood; hematocrit is the percentage of blood
volume that is red blood cells. Loss of whole blood will not decrease the red blood
cell concentration or the percentage of red cells in blood. The initial minor drops
in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are the results of mechanisms that compensate
for blood loss by drawing fluid into the vascular space. To see significant decreases in
these values, blood loss must be replaced with crystalloid solution; therefore, most
decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit values are not seen until patients have
received large volumes of crystalloid fluid for resuscitation.
With the ongoing metabolic acidosis of hemorrhagic shock, an increased base
deficit and lactate level will be seen. Both lactate and base deficit levels are laboratory values that indicate systemic acidosis, not local tissue ischemia. They are global
indices of tissue perfusion and normal values may mask areas of under perfusion as
a consequence of normal blood flow to the remainder of the body. These laboratory
tests are not true representations of tissue hypoxia. It is, therefore, not surprising
that lactate and base deficit are poor prognostic indicators of survival in patients
with shock. Although absolute values of these laboratory results are not predictors
of survival in patients with shock, the baseline value and trends can be used to determine the extent of tissue hypoxia and adequacy of resuscitation. Normalization of
base deficit and serum lactate within 24 hours after resuscitation is a good prognostic
indicator of survival. Of note, given that lactate is hepatically metabolized, it is not
a reliable value in patients with liver dysfunction.

Central Monitoring
The approach to central monitoring in the trauma patient has changed dramatically.
The benefit of central monitoring is to most accurately determine cardiac preload,
given that preload, or end-diastolic sarcomere length, is the driving force behind the
cardiac output as defined by the Starling Curve. Previously, placement of a pulmonary artery catheter was used to measure the pulmonary capillary occlusion (wedge)
pressure. This number was used as an approximation of left atrial pressure, which in
turn was an indirect measurement of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume. Left-ventricular end-diastolic volume is considered the best clinical estimate
of preload. However in recent years, the invasive nature of PA catheters has raised
concern about their placement. Clinical practice varies, but in general has shifted
towards the use of central venous catheters recording central venous pressure (CVP)
to estimate volume status. Even more recently, ultrasound has been used to assess
intravascular volume status by examining the respiratory variation of the inferior
vena cava (more variation signifying low intravascular volume), or by calculation
a ratio of the diameter of the IVC to the aorta. The adoption of these techniques is
highly institution-specific.

Management of Hemorrhagic Shock
Resuscitation The most common and easily available ﬂuid replacements are
isotonic crystalloid solutions such as normal saline or lactated Ringer solution.
For each liter of these solutions that is infused, approximately 300 mL stays in the

88

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

intravascular space while the remainder leaks into the interstitial space. This distribution has led to the guideline of 3 mL crystalloid replacement for each 1 mL of
blood loss. A blood transfusion is indicated if the patient persists in shock despite
the rapid infusion of 2 to 3 L of crystalloid solution, or if the patient has had such severe blood loss that cardiovascular collapse is imminent. When possible, typed and
cross-matched blood is optimal; however, in the acute setting, this is often unfeasible. Type-speciﬁc unmatched blood is the next best option, followed by O-negative
blood in females and O-positive blood in males. Blood is generally administered as
packed erythrocytes or packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Crystalloids, fresh-frozen
plasma (FFP), and/or platelets may need to be transfused if massive blood volumes
have been given. Transfusion protocols differ by institution regarding the ratio of
FFP to platelets to PRBCs that should be administered. Colloid solutions such as
albumin and hetastarch or dextran are not superior to crystalloid replacement in the
acute setting and have the potential for large ﬂuid shifts and pulmonary or bowel
wall edema. Hypertonic solutions such as 7.5% saline have the advantage of retaining as much as 500 mL in the intravascular space and may be useful in trauma situations with no access to blood products, such as in military settings.
The concept of permissive hypotension is now more widely accepted in trauma
care. The central tenet is that patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock (excluding intracranial hemorrhages) may benefit from judicious fluid administration. In
permissive hypotension, the patient’s blood pressure is not resuscitated to their
normal blood pressure, or to what physicians consider a normal blood pressure.
Instead, the blood pressure is allowed to remain low (mean arterial pressures of
60-70 mm Hg or a systolic blood pressure of 80-90 mm Hg). Permissive hypotension is thought to be effective in hemorrhagic shock because it is thought
that post-hemorrhage, the artificially increased blood pressure by aggressive fluid
resuscitation may disrupt endogenous clot formation and promote further bleeding. Also, crystalloid is often administered at room temperature, which is actually
colder than the body temperature and can result in hypothermia following excessive administration. Crystalloid can also dilute the endogenous clotting factors
and erythrocyte concentration, resulting in poorer control of bleeding and also
diminished oxygen carrying capacity. Though shown to have great benefits in animal models, human studies of permissive hypotension are few. However, this concept is becoming more accepted in trauma centers. Patients in whom permissive
hypotension should not be practiced are: patients with traumatic brain injuries
who require maintenance of their cerebral perfusion pressure; patients with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, or coronary artery disease, in whom
hypotension will be poorly tolerated and may produce other medical problems
such as strokes or myocardial infarctions.

Controlling Hemorrhage Achieving hemostasis is paramount in managing the
trauma patient with hemorrhagic shock. Wounds amenable to local tamponade with
direct pressure, dressings, or tourniquet application should be managed as such. For
other injuries that require operative repair, such as intra-abdominal injuries, or for
pelvic fractures that require advanced therapies such as interventional radiology (IR)–
guided embolization, the appropriate specialists should be contacted immediately.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

89

While contacting and arranging for further definitive care, appropriate resuscitation
of the patient should be initiated.

emergency room having lost much blood at the accident scene. His initial blood
pressure is 80/40 mm Hg and heart rate 130 beats per minute. He is given 3 L of

7.4 A 35-year-old man has been involved in a motor vehicle accident, and is found
to be hypotensive. Which of the following locations of bleeding can cause signiﬁcant complications but does not explain the hypotension?
A. Chest and abdomen
B. Pelvic girdle and soft-tissue compartments
C. External bleeding
D. Intracranial bleeding

90

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS
7.1 D. Blood pressure at rest typically does not decrease until class III hemorrhagic
shock, when 1500 to 2000 mL of blood is lost (30%-40% of blood volume).
Class I hemorrhagic shock is well compensated associated with 750 mL EBL or
less, with no effect on blood pressure and minimal effect on heart rate. Class II
shock, associated with 750 to 1500 mL EBL, is associated with tachycardia but
normal blood pressure at rest, and low urine output.
7.2 B. DPL and FAST cannot rule out retroperitoneal injury or identify the speciﬁc
site of injury, but they can be performed quickly at bedside on unstable trauma
patients. To ﬁnd the speciﬁc site of injury and rule out retroperitoneal injury, a
CT scan can be done; however, the trauma patient must be hemodynamically
stable to be transported to the CT scan suite.
7.3 A. In situations of trauma and hemorrhage, persistent hypotension is caused by
blood loss unless otherwise proven. Hypotension is caused by lack of preload.
Preload is end-diastolic sarcomere length, and insufﬁcient circulating volume
does not allow for sufﬁcient venous return or cardiac output.
7.4 D. It is important to systematically check for bleeding sources in the chest,
abdomen, pelvic girdle, soft-tissue compartments (long-bone fractures), and
external bleeding. Intracranial bleeding, although a signiﬁcant injury, is usually
not the cause of hypotension. The exception to this is the patient who is moribund secondary to a head injury.

CASE 8
An intoxicated 25-year-old man was brought to the emergency department (ED)
by paramedics after he was involved in an altercation and sustained several stab
wounds to the torso and upper extremities. His initial vital signs in the ED showed
pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/80 mm Hg, respiratory
rate of 20 breaths per minute, and Glasgow coma scale of 13. A 2-cm stab wound
is noted over the left anterior chest just below the left nipple. Additionally, there
is a 2-cm wound adjacent to the umbilicus, and several 1- to 2-cm stab wounds
are noted in right arm and forearm, near the antecubital fossa. The abdominal
and chest wounds are not actively bleeding and there is no apparent hematoma
associated with these wounds. However, one of the wounds in the right arm is
associated with a 10-cm hematoma that is actively oozing.

ANSWERS TO CASE 8:
Penetrating Trauma to the Chest, Abdomen, and Extremities
Summary: A 25-year-old hemodynamically stable, intoxicated man presents with
stab wounds to the chest, abdomen, and upper extremities.
• Next step: Assess ABCDE: airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure. After completing this survey, consider probing knife wounds (except chest
wounds) to see whether they are superficial or deep.
• Potential complications from injuries:
• Chest wound: Pericardial effusion/tamponade, pneumothorax, hemothorax,
diaphragmatic injury
• Abdominal wound: Hollow viscus, vascular, or urinary tract injury
• Extremities: Vascular, nerve, or tendon injury

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be able to classify penetrating injuries by location, including chest, thoracoabdominal region, abdomen, flank, back, and “cardiac box.”
2. Learn the priorities involved in the initial management of penetrating injuries.
3. Become familiar with the treatments of penetrating truncal and extremity injuries.

Considerations
A systematic approach must be undertaken in the evaluation of this patient. The
clinician must guard against being distracted by injuries not immediately threatening to loss of life or limb. Likewise, young healthy individuals, particularly those
who are intoxicated, may have significant injuries and not manifest many physical examination findings or hemodynamic changes. Advanced trauma life support
(ATLS) guidelines stress the initial primary survey to identify and address potentially life-threatening injuries. The primary survey consists of the ABCDEs (airway,
breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure). Exposure (removing all of the
patient’s clothing and rolling the patient to examine the patient’s backside) is particularly important in a patient with penetrating trauma because puncture wounds
may be hidden in axillary, inguinal, and gluteal folds.
Following the primary survey, preliminary labs, plain x-rays, and a bedside ultrasound should be obtained as clinically indicated. In this case, an upright chest x-ray
(CXR), preferably at end expiration will be needed to assess for pneumothorax
and hemothorax. A focused abdominal sonogram for trauma (FAST) examination
should be performed to evaluate for pericardial and intraperitoneal free fluid. This
patient is hemodynamically stable and possesses minimal abdominal examination
findings. Therefore, a reasonable strategy is to perform local wound exploration to

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

95

determine the depth of the puncture wound. A wound that does not penetrate the
abdominal fascia may be irrigated and closed without further diagnostic requirement. However, it is important to note that in an intoxicated patient, the physical
examination may not be very sensitive.

APPROACH TO:
Penetrating Trauma
DEFINITIONS
CHEST: Area from clavicles to costal margins, 360 degrees around.
“CARDIAC BOX”: Anatomical region bordered by the clavicles superiorly, bilateral midclavicular lines laterally, and the costal margins inferiorly. This box includes
the epigastric region between the costal margins. Eighty-five percent of penetrating
cardiac stab wounds originate from a puncture to the “box.”
THORACOABDOMINAL: Area from the inframammary crease (women) or
nipples (men), down to the costal margins, 360 degrees around. The clinical significance of a penetrating wound to this region is that there is a risk of injury to the
intrathoracic and intra-abdominal contents, as well as to the diaphragm.
ANTERIOR ABDOMEN: Area bordered by the costal margins superiorly, the
bilateral midaxillary lines laterally, and by the inguinal ligaments inferiorly.
FLANK: Area from the coastal margin down to the iliac crest, and between the
anterior and posterior axillary lines.
BACK: Area between the posterior axillary lines. Because of thick musculature
over the back, only about 5% of stab wounds to the back lead to significant injuries.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Initial Management
The primary survey, or ABCDEs, should be addressed first (see Table I–2 in
Section I). The clinician should not be distracted by eye-catching but not immediately life-threatening injuries. In an unstable patient, treatment decisions often
need to be made before obtaining diagnostic tests. For example, a patient with a
stab wound to the chest and rapidly dropping oxygen saturations will require tube
thoracostomy (“B” breathing) prior to confirmatory CXR. Bleeding, even if profuse,
is most effectively controlled by direct hand pressure to the bleeding site. Gauze and
pressure dressings are generally less effective. All patients should have immediate
placement of large-bore IV access at two sites. Volume repletion should be initiated
with warm IV fluids. After completion of the primary survey, a systematic search
for other injuries (secondary survey) should be undertaken. Diagnostic tests should
be performed expeditiously after the primary survey and often concurrent with the
secondary survey (Table 8–1).

In general, gunshot wounds are more likely to cause greater tissue destruction and
life-threatening injuries than stab wounds. This is due to the unpredictable path of
the bullet which can lead to significant tissue destruction. Hence, it is not safe to
assume that a bullet has taken a direct path between the entrance and exit wounds.
The management of patients with penetrating injuries has undergone significant
evolution over the past two decades. During the 1980s and 1990s, most patients
underwent invasive diagnostic evaluations, including exploratory laparotomy and
angiography based solely on mechanism and location. Currently, selective treatment
for some penetrating injuries is acceptable. Selective treatment may involve close
observation, and additional minimally invasive diagnostic studies such as ultrasonography, laparoscopy, and thoracoscopy. This option has led to a significant reduction in unnecessary operations. However, selective treatment must be tailored to the
clinical situation and balanced against the risk of delay to diagnosis and definitive

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

97

operative intervention. The decision to proceed with selective treatment is best
determined by a qualified surgeon, after the initial evaluation.

Speciﬁc Anatomical Regions
Chest Injuries Generally, 10% to 15% of patients with penetrating chest trauma
require urgent operative intervention. Fortunately the majority of these patients
can be identified within the first minutes by initial hemodynamic instability, the
presence of a large hemothorax on CXR, or high chest tube output. The remaining
85% to 90% of patients may require only close observation, diagnostic imaging, and
tube thoracostomy.
The upright chest x-ray (CXR) has adequate sensitivity to evaluate for pneumothorax and hemothorax. Obtaining an end-expiratory film may increase the likelihood of detecting a small pneumothorax. In a patient with a high risk mechanism,
the absence of a pneumothorax should be confirmed by a repeat upright CXR in 4 to
6 hours or by computed tomography (CT). CT of the chest is highly sensitive for the
detection of pneumothorax. A small pneumothorax visualized by CT and missed by
CXR is referred to as an “occult pneumothorax.” An occult pneumothorax should
be reevaluated for progression in 4 to 6 hours by CXR.
Local wound exploration of a chest injury is not recommended because the
procedure itself can penetrate the pleura and cause a pneumothorax. Pneumo- or
hemothorax found by CXR is treated by placement of a 36- or 40-French chest tube.
Smaller tubes clot easily with blood and are not indicated in the setting of trauma.
If the pneumo- or hemothorax does not resolve with one chest tube, then a second
chest tube should be placed. There has not been a consensus on the size of traumatic pneumothorax that warrants tube thoracostomy, although recent literature has
shown a push towards more invasive procedures especially when the pneumothorax
is 20% or greater. However, if the injury requires mechanical ventilation then a chest
tube should be placed, regardless of size, to prevent a worsening of the pneumothorax
or a tension physiology from the positive pressure ventilation. The best initial treatment of a tension pneumothorax is needle decompression followed immediately
by the placement of a chest tube. Considerations for operative thoracotomy include
initial output of 1500 mL of blood, or 200 mL/h over the next 4 hours.
Any patient with an injury within the cardiac box should undergo prompt FAST
examination of the heart by an experienced sonographer. The subxiphoid view may
be complemented by a parasternal view. The experienced sonographer can detect
pericardial blood with up to 100 percent sensitivity (Figure 8–1). Hemopericardium
is an indication for pericardial exploration in the operating room.
Resuscitative (or so-called emergency department) thoracotomy is reserved for
patients who are in extremis or who have lost vital signs in the ED or within a few
minutes prior to arrival. This procedure is associated with a great deal of controversy. The practitioner must bear in mind that mortality exceeds 97%. In addition,
this intervention may expose healthcare providers to unnecessary accidental injury
and infectious agents. The best outcomes occur when this procedure is performed in
properly selected patients by an experienced physician and in a medical center with
the capability to provide definitive treatment.

Thoracoabdominal Thoracoabdominal wounds are of particular interest because
injuries to the diaphragm are difficult to detect. Unless the diaphragmatic defect
is large, herniation of stomach or intestines is rarely visualized by CXR in the ED.
Moreover, CT is not sensitive enough to detect small diaphragmatic injures. Surgical
consultation should be obtained when diaphragmatic injury is suspected because
the definitive diagnostic study is surgical evaluation by laparoscopy or thoracoscopy. If these injuries go untreated, herniation of intra-abdominal contents into the
chest may eventually occur due to the presence of negative intrathoracic pressure.
Anterior Abdomen Immediate indication for laparotomy includes evidence of
shock (hypotension, tachycardia, cold and clammy skin, or diaphoresis), peritonitis, gun-shot wound with a suspected course through the abdominal cavity, or
evisceration of abdominal contents. In the absence of these findings, further radiographic evaluation or observation is indicated.
Local wound exploration is the best initial evaluation for a stable patient with an
abdominal stab wound. This procedure is performed after preparing the skin with an
antiseptic agent, creating a sterile field and anesthetizing the skin and soft tissues.
The skin laceration is enlarged, and the wound tract is gently followed until either
its termination or its violation of the anterior abdominal fascia. An intact fascia
makes it highly unlikely that there is an intra-abdominal injury, and therefore the
wound may be irrigated and closed.
If the anterior abdominal fascia has been penetrated, then it is critical that a surgeon becomes involved in the patient’s care in order to help facilitate observation

with serial abdominal examinations or surgical intervention. Historically, diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) was performed at the bedside to further investigate
potential intra-abdominal injuries. However, DPL has been largely replaced by CT
scan or diagnostic laparoscopy in the hemodynamically stable patient and by laparotomy in the unstable patient.

Back/Flank The physical examination, FAST, and DPL are insensitive in diagnosing injuries to the retroperitoneum, including the colon, kidneys, and ureters.
The only clue to a retroperitoneal process irritating the psoas muscles may be the
patient’s need to flex their hips. Hematuria is the most reliable sign of injury to the
kidneys, ureters, and bladder. If gross or microscopic hematuria is present or if a high
degree of suspicion exists for possible injury, further evaluation is needed. CT with
delayed images, intravenous pyelography (IVP), and perhaps retrograde cystography
are useful imaging modalities. Recent literature suggests that most renal injuries
without associated hemodynamic compromise or urinary collection system leaks do
not mandate exploration. These patients require hospital admission, bedrest, and serial laboratory studies. Laparotomy may be necessary for high-grade renal lacerations
in an unstable patient.
Extremities The six Ps of arterial insufficiency (pain, paralysis, parasthesias, pallor, pulselessness, and poikilothermia) and the hard signs of vascular injury (pulsatile bleeding, expanding hematoma, absent distal pulses, palpable thrill, or audible
bruit) should be evaluated. Their presence is an indication for immediate operative
or angiographic evaluation. A careful pulse examination should be performed to
look for a deficit. If pulses are not palpable, then Doppler can be used to identify
arterial flow. Sites of injury should be auscultated for a bruit that can represent a
traumatic arteriovenous fistula. Ankle-brachial indexes (ABI) can be a useful measurement for evaluating lower extremity vascular trauma. An ABI value of <0.9 may
represent vascular injury and, therefore, warrants further investigation. However, in
long-standing diabetics, ABIs are less sensitive due to stiffened diseased vasculature
leading to spurious values. Additionally, a motor or sensory deficit can represent
nerve or tendon injury that is best evaluated and treated in the operating room.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

8.2 For which of the following patients is CT imaging an appropriate diagnostic
option?
A. A 38-year-old man with diffuse abdominal pain, involuntary guarding, and
a 6-in knife impaled just below the umbilicus
B. A 22-year-old man with a single stab wound to the back, pulse rate of 118
beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/80 mm Hg, and gross hematuria
C. A 16-year-old adolescent boy with a single stab wound 2 cm above the left
inguinal crease, with heart rate of 120 beats per minute and blood pressure
of 90/78 mm Hg
D. A hemodynamically stable, 34-year-old woman, who is 26 weeks pregnant
and has a single stab wound to the back and no other abnormalities on
physical examination
8.3 A 34-year-old man is brought into the emergency department after a motor
vehicle accident. He complains of dyspnea and initially had an oxygen saturation of 88%. On examination, he has decreased breath sounds of the right chest
and now has an oxygen saturation of 70% on room air. Which of the following
is the most appropriate next step?
A. Chest radiograph
B. CT of the chest
C. Tube thoracostomy
D. Heparin anticoagulation

ANSWERS
8.1 C. CXR is sensitive in identifying hemothorax and pneumothorax, while echocardiography is useful in identifying pericardial ﬂuid. Wound exploration of the
chest wound is not recommended because the information gained is limited
and the procedure is associated with the potential of producing pneumothorax.
An ECG provides limited information regarding cardiac injury and is generally
not done. A stab wound above the nipple line is rarely associated with intraabdominal injury, therefore, CT scan of the abdomen or diagnostic laparoscopy
is unnecessary.
8.2 D. CT of the abdomen may be useful in identifying injuries to the retroperitoneal structures in a patient with a stab wound to the back. That the patient is
26-week pregnant does not contraindicate CT scan. Further diagnostic study
would not be beneﬁcial in patients listed in choices A, B, and C because these
patients are exhibiting signs of signiﬁcant injury that would necessitate urgent
exploratory laparotomy.
8.3 C. The constellation of clinical signs points toward a pneumothorax. The presence of signiﬁcant hypoxia requires immediate placement of a chest tube prior
to chest radiograph conﬁrmation as further delay may progress to cardiovascular
collapse.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The systematic approach to the trauma patient is ABCDE (airway, breathing,
circulation, disability, exposure).



A wound that does not penetrate the abdominal fascia may be irrigated
and closed without further diagnostic studies.



Penetrating trauma to the chest below the nipple line may cause thoracic,
intra-abdominal, and occult diaphragmatic injuries.



The FAST (focused abdominal sonogram for trauma) is fairly accurate in
assessing intraperitoneal free fluid.



Approximately 85% of penetrating cardiac stab wounds originate from a
puncture to the “cardiac box.”

ANSWERS TO CASE 9:
Extremity Fracture and Neck Pain
Summary: A young man tripped and fell down some stairs and now complains of
neck and right upper extremity pain. His history and presentation are concerning
for cervical spine and right upper extremity injuries.
• Evaluation of neck pain: Obtain computed tomography (CT) of the cervical
spine. If the CT does not demonstrate any bony fractures or dislocation and his
midline tenderness persists, then obtain flexion/extension x-rays or MRI of the
C-spine to help differentiate ligamentous injury/spinal instability from soft tissue contusion.
• Evaluations of upper extremity: Given the soft tissue swelling and the location
of pain, physical examination of the affect extremity should include detailed
evaluation of the hand, wrist, and forearm, and this should include clinical
assessments of tissue perfusion and functionality. Although, vascular injuries
are uncommon with this patient’s injury mechanism, arterial inflow need to
be evaluated based on capillary refill and presence or absence of pulses. If the
perfusion status is in doubt, Doppler evaluation of pulse quality and pressures
should be obtained. X-rays of the humerus, radius, ulna, wrist, and hand should
be obtained to assess for possible bone injuries.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the common cervical spine injuries associated with the various injury
mechanisms.
2. Learn the decision rules that guide the use of cervical spine radiography in trauma
patients.
3. Learn the current role of corticosteroids in patients with spinal cord injuries.
4. Learn the emergency department management of elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand
injuries.

Considerations
The neck pain associated with midline tenderness on palpation in this patient raises
the concern for C-spine injury; therefore, radiographic evaluations must be obtained
for further assessment. Either three views of the C-spine (AP, lateral, and odontoid
views) or CT can be performed. CT is preferable over three views as the preferred
diagnostic study in many centers because it is associated with much lower rates of
false-negative examinations than plain radiography. CT would be especially helpful in this patient who exhibits concerning symptoms and physical findings. If the
neck pain and midline C-spine tenderness persist despite negative CT, additional

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

105

imaging to determine C-spine stability or to identify ligamentous injuries should be
obtained. C-spine precautions should be maintained until the possibility of unstable
injury can be eliminated based on imaging. Only when imaging studies indicate the
absence of flexion/extension instability or the absence of ligamentous injuries can
the patient be assumed to have neck pain related to soft tissue injuries only.
This patient also exhibit findings in the right distal forearm/wrist/hand that suggest the possibility of bony injuries. The initial evaluation should be directed toward
evaluations of hand and digits functions; namely, motor/sensory functions and ligamentous integrity. Careful palpation of the hand, wrist, and forearm should also
be performed to localize areas of concern for bony injuries. Two-view radiographs
should be obtained to assess the bony integrity of the humerus, radius, ulna, carpal
bones, and phalanges. When identified, fractures and dislocations should be reduced
to minimize neurovascular compromises. Further assessments and management of all
bony, ligamentous injuries and functional abnormalities should be discussed with an
orthopedic or hand specialist.

APPROACH TO:
Cervical Spine and Upper Extremity Orthopedic Injuries
DEFINITIONS
NEXUS LOW-RISK CRITERIA: This C-spine clearance approach was derived
based on a 1998 publication by Hoffman et al (Ann Emerg Med 1998;32:461-469).
The recommendations are that C-spine radiography is indicated for asymptomatic
trauma patients unless they meet all of the following criteria: (1) No posterior midline cervical tenderness. (2) No evidence intoxication. (3) Normal level of alertness. (4) No focal neurologic deficits. (5) No painful distracting injuries. The major
limitation of this approach is that no precise definition for painful distracting injuries was provided.
THE CANADIAN C-SPINE RULE (CCR): This is a guideline to determine the
need for radiographic evaluations of alert and stable trauma patients. In comparison
to the NEXUS criteria, the CCR has been shown to have slightly greater sensitivity
and specificity for identification of patients who do not have C-spine injuries. (See
Figure 9–1.)
PARTIAL CORD SYNDROMES: Compression or contusions to the spinal cord
can develop with or without concomitant bony injuries. Compression of the anterior cord can produce complete motor paralysis, loss of pain and temperature perceptions. Posterior cord syndrome (Brown-Sequard) causes paralysis loss of vibratory
sensation and proprioception ipsilaterally and loss of pain and temperature sensations contralaterally. Central cord syndrome is produced by injuries to the corticospinal tract, which produces great upper extremities weakness in comparison to the
lower extremities.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Millions of adults at risk for cervical spine injuries and/or upper extremity orthopedic injuries are evaluated in emergency departments throughout the United States
and Canada every year. Among patients presenting with intact neurological status to the emergency department, the incidence of acute C-spine fracture or spinal
injury is less than 1%. Even though spinal injury incidences are low, there are great
consequences associated with mismanagement. Similarly, mismanagement of upper
extremity injuries can lead to potential employment and functional compromises.

Clearing the C-spine in the Blunt Trauma Patient
The goal of C-spine clearance is to establish that injuries are not present, and based
on statistics, probabilities for injuries are low. The approach to patients is based
on patient classifications, where individuals are classified as asymptomatic, temporarily non-assessable, symptomatic, and obtunded. Asymptomatic patients can
be approached using the CCR, which has been shown to lead to the reduction in
unnecessary radiography and has been demonstrated to be superior in comparison to
the NEXUS criteria. For temporarily non-assessable patients (either due to intoxication or distracting injuries), the approach is to assess the patient as an obtunded
patient or reassess the individual after treatments of distracted injuries or return of
normal mentation. Symptomatic patients are recognized by the presence of neck
pain, midline tenderness, or neurologic signs and symptoms; symptomatic patients
need to be initially evaluated with either 3-view C-spine x-rays or preferably CT;
symptomatic patients with negative CT who are suspected of having ligamentous
injuries need to be further evaluated with MRI of the C-spine, and if both CT and

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

107

MRI are negative, then the patients can be discharged with a collar for comfort;
however, if the patient has persistent neck pain after 2 weeks, flexion/extension
films are recommended to assess C-spine stability. All symptomatic patients should
be evaluated by a spine specialist prior to discharge from the ED. For obtunded
trauma patients (altered mental status or prolonged intubation or psychiatric disturbances or uncooperative), the initial evaluation is CT of the C-spine. If this is
negative, there are two options; one option is to clear the C-spine, and the second
option is to perform MRI to rule out ligamentous injuries. The major argument for
option one is that isolated ligamentous injuries are rare, and the major argument
for option two is that the negative predictive value of CT for ligamentous injuries is
only 78%. It should be pointed out that the American College of Radiology recommends that CT and MRI are the most appropriate modalities for C-spine evaluation
in the obtunded trauma patient. All obtunded trauma patients should be evaluated
by trauma and/or spine specialists.

Emergency Department Management of C-spine Injuries
The initial management of any patient with C-spine injuries is to prioritize the
ABCs, as most C-spine injuries do not occur as isolated injuries. Early definitive
airways may be required for some patients who develop soft tissue swelling of the
neck that lead to airway compromise. Similarly, definitive airway and mechanical
ventilation may be required in patients with paralysis or muscle weakness associated with C-spine injuries. Definitive airway management in these patients is best
accomplished by in-line C-spine stabilization and orotracheal intubations, following
rapid-sequence induction. It is important to bear in mind that most of the respiratory accessory muscles receive their motor innervations from the thoracic level,
and the diaphragm receives its innervations from C3-C5; therefore, patients with
compromised ventilation secondary to C-spine injuries generally do not exhibit any
external signs of respiratory distress, and the most reliable way to detect hypoventilation is by PaCO2 measurements on arterial blood gas. Estimation of neurologic
deficits can be determined based on physical examinations and radiographic evidence
of fracture and/or dislocation. From C1 to C7, nerve root exit above the level of the
vertebrae, and from C8 and below, the nerve roots exit below the vertebrae.
If possible, it is always preferable to be able to perform a thorough motor-sensory
examination prior to intubation. For patients with spinal cord injuries, it is always
preferable to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 85 to 90 mm Hg to maximize spinal cord perfusion. If needed, patients with isolated spinal cord injuries may benefit
from initiation of vassopressors such as dopamines or norepinephrine. Bradycardia
associated with neurogenic shock can be addressed with atropine.
The priorities for any spinal cord injury patients are to address the life-threatening
injuries first followed by management of the limb and quality-of-life threatening
injuries.

Role of Corticosteroids for Spinal Cord Injuries
Corticosteroids had been a mainstay of therapy in the early management of spinal
cord injury patients; however, more recent publications suggest that high-dose corticosteroids administration had only some benefits for individuals when the treatment

108

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

was initiated within 3 hours of the injury. Unfortunately, the treatments with highdose corticosteroids are associated with increased rates of sepsis and other steroidassociated medical complications. In light of these published data, the application
of corticosteroids for spinal cord injured patients have been dramatically reduced,
and steroids should not be initiated for patients in the emergency department prior
to discussions with the trauma and/or spine specialists who will ultimately manage
the patient after ED discharge.

Management of Upper Extremity Injuries
Upper extremity injuries are commonly encountered in the ED. Inappropriate diagnosis and management in the ED can lead to chronic pain, and threat to recreational
and vocational activities. Orthopedic injuries to the upper extremities are categorized by the bone, location (proximal, midshaft, or distal), presence or absence of
joint involvement, degree of angulation, extent of comminution, and whether the
fracture is open or closed.
Forearm fractures: Rotation of the forearm is crucial for hand function and activities of daily living. Normally, the radius rotate around the fixed ulna, and the ability
of these bones to rotate around each other depends on the shape of the bones and
their positions in relationship to each other. Initial evaluations of patients require
careful determination of neurovascular status of the extremity followed by x-rays.
Injuries that involve only one of the two bones are generally stable and are treated
by closed manipulation, cast immobilization under conscious sedation or ultrasound-guided regional nerve blocks. Most displaced, fractures that involve both the
ulna and radius are considered unstable fractures and are less amendable to closed
fixations; therefore, many of these fractures are managed by open-reduction and
internal fixations.
Distal radius fractures: This is one of the most common fractures encountered in
children and adults. The bimodal distribution of this injury demonstrates a peak
in late childhood (predominantly males) and after the sixth decade of life (predominantly females). The most common mechanism associated with this injury is a
ground-level fall with outstretched hand. The Colles-Pouteau fracture is a fracture
of the distal radial metaphysic with dorsal displacement of the distal fragment, and
this represents the most commonly encountered distal radial fracture. In children,
distal radius fractures are grouped as metaphyseal and physeal fractures, with the
physeal fractures demonstrating involvement of the growth plate and can be further
classified by the Salter-Harris classifications. Most of distal radius fractures in children are treated by closed reduction and cast fixation. The goals of a management
in adults are to restore bone alignment and avoid shortening of the radius. The decision to treat patients by closed reduction and fixation versus operative reduction
and fixation are determined by the degree of alignment, age, and functional status
of the patients. Common complications associated with these injuries are malunion,
nerve injury, tendon injury, stiffness, and chronic pain.
Carpal bone fractures: There are eight carpal bones in the hand. Carpal bones in
general have limited blood supply and are susceptible to avascular necrosis following
injuries. Often, details of fractures and/or dislocations of the carpal bones are difficult to

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

109

visualize by plain radiography, therefore CTs or MRIs are sometimes used to determine the location and extent of injuries. Most displaced fractures are managed by
operative reduction and fixation. Some of the stable, non-displaced carpal fractures
can be initially approach with cast fixation. The management of any carpal injuries
should be discussed with an orthopedic or hand specialist.
Metacarpal and phalangeal fractures: These fractures can be sometimes over-looked
especially in a patient with multisystem injuries. The failure to identify and treat
these injuries could lead to potential finger misalignement, pain, and functional
loss. The goals of management of metacarpal fractures are to preserve bone length,
rotational functions, and articular functions, which can be accomplished by either
immobilization or internal fixation. The goals of managing phalangeal fractures are
to minimize angulation and rotational deformities. Functional recoveries in most
cases require patients’ participation in rehabilitation programs. Early involvement of
a hand or orthopedic specialist is vital in the management of these patients.

facility. The patient reportedly was found to have fallen down in the bath room.
He has contusions over his face and is confused. According to reports by his
caretakers, this is his baseline mental status. How would you clear his C-spine?
A. Palpation of his C-spine for tenderness, if not tender than ask him to turn

9.3 Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of
a 22-year-old man with C5 fracture and C5-C6 subluxation, absence of motor
or sensory functions below the C4 level, heart rate of 45, and BP 100/60?
A. Maintain mean arterial pressure >85 to 90 mm Hg

extremities
B. A 20-year-old man with greater weakness in the upper extremities than the
lower extremities
C. A 20-year-old man with complete motor paralysis, loss of vibratory sensation and proprioception on the ipsilateral side, and contralateral loss of
pain and temperature sensation.
D. A 20-year-old man with fracture/dislocation of C5-C6 and intact motor/
sensory functions throughout
E. A 20-year-old man with normal CT of the C-spine and motor and sensory
deficits below the C6 level

ANSWERS
9.1 D. For this patient with chronic altered mental status due to underlying medical
conditions; therefore, the approach to clear his C-spine is one directed toward
obtunded patients. His C-spine can be cleared based on a normal CT of the
C-spine alone, which is sufﬁcient to identify greater than 99% of all vertebral
bony fractures/dislocations. An MRI can be added to identify the rare instances
of isolated ligamentous injuries if the CT is normal. There is no consensus on
whether MRI is indicated in this setting.
9.2 B. The Canadian C-spine rule (CCR) is an approach developed for the clearance of C-spines in asymptomatic patients following low mechanism events.
The CCR has been compared to the NEXUS criteria and found to be more
speciﬁc and sensitive in clearance of the C-spine.
9.3 C. This patient has signs consistent with neurogenic shock following a high
spinal cord injury. The ﬁrst concerns are his airway and ventilation. The airway
appears to be clear but he needs a deﬁnitive airway to maintain optimal ventilation. Orotracheal intubation with rapid sequence induction and in-line C-spine
stabilization is the optimal airway strategy for this patient. Maintenance of adequate pulse and blood pressure are important to maintain spinal cord perfusion,
but these steps should be delayed until a secured airway is established.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

111

9.4 C. The Brown-Sequard syndrome is caused by posterior spinal cord injury, characterized by paralysis, loss of vibratory sensation and proprioception on the ipsilateral side, and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral side.
Patient described in A is compatible with complete cord injury. The patient
described in B is compatible with central cord injury. The patient in D appears
to have vertebral fractures/dislocation without neurologic compromises. The
patient in E has a spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA); SCIWORAs occur more commonly in children than adults.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The Canadian C-spine rule is an effective evaluation system to clinically
clear C-spines in asymptomatic patients.



Cervical spine injuries occur in 1% to 3% of all victims following blunt
trauma.

ANSWERS TO CASE 10:
Anaphylaxis
Summary: This patient is demonstrating signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is rapidly progressive severe allergic reaction which compromises a patient’s
airway, breathing, and circulation. Patients may also exhibit flushing, hives, and
swelling of mucous membranes. Successful treatment of anaphylaxis requires early
recognition of the symptoms of anaphylaxis, support of the airway, and administration of epinephrine.
• Next step: In the presence of symptoms meeting the diagnostic criteria for
anaphylaxis, epinephrine should be administered immediately. The first dose
should be administered intramuscularly. In the setting of a severe reaction like
the one described above, moving quickly to intravenous infusion of epinephrine is recommended.
• Further treatments: This patient requires rapid resuscitation and stabilization.
Airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) should be managed appropriately
and in that order, which will mean both procedural and pharmacological intervention. A definitive airway will need to be immediately established in the face
of impending airway obstruction (see Case 1), and the patient’s cardiovascular
compromise must be supported with epinephrine. Experts have referred to the
ABCs of anaphylaxis as A E B C; the E is for epinephrine.
In addition to airway management and early administration of epinephrine, pharmacologic therapy is tailored to the other systemic manifestations of the anaphylactic response. These include volume resuscitation with crystalloid, nebulized beta
agonists, nebulized racemic epinephrine, corticosteroids, antihistamines (including
H2 blockers), and removal of any remaining antigen (ie, the bee stinger).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Rapidly recognize the characteristic clinical features of anaphylaxis.
2. Understand the underlying pathophysiology of anaphylaxis.
3. Become familiar with the available treatment options; most importantly the correct administration of epinephrine.

Considerations
This patient is brought into the ED with swelling of the tongue and labored breathing. The perioral cyanosis, diffuse wheezing, stridor, and hypoxia all indicate
impending respiratory failure. A delay of even a minute may be life-threatening.
The most important intervention in addition to administration of epinephrine
is securing an airway. This patient likely has edema of the pharynx and larynx

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

making intubation technically difficult. Airway management in a patient like this
often requires a cricothyroidotomy.
Intravenous access with administration of epinephrine is the most important
pharmacologic intervention. Epinephrine should first be given intramuscularly;
if that route fails, an intravenous drip should be initiated. Dosing of epinephrine
will be covered below. Identification of the inciting agent is not essential for treatment of anaphylaxis, but is helpful in preventing further exposures and recurrence
of symptoms.

APPROACH TO:
Anaphylaxis
CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
Millions of people present to emergency departments every year complaining of
allergic symptoms ranging from the minor rashes to multisystem anaphylaxis. Most
of the time, it is difficult if not impossible to identify the trigger. Many reactions
may occur in response to medical therapies such as antibiotics and radiologic contrast agents. Because the spectrum of allergic responses is so broad, anaphylaxis is
likely underreported. As a result it is difficult to calculate a precise incidence of this
disease. There are an estimated 30,000 ED visits every year for adverse food reactions. However, there are far more visits for more vague complaints and unknown
exposures that may be difficult to identify as anaphylaxis. In the emergency department the goal is rapid diagnosis, symptomatic treatment, and prevention of further
episodes.

Pathophysiology
True anaphylaxis is a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction occurring after a previous
sensitizing exposure. In its purest form, this is an immune-mediated activation of
basophils and mast cells with subsequent release of prostaglandins, leukotrienes,
and histamine. From a clinical standpoint, an anaphylactoid reaction also includes
release of these compounds but through non–immune-mediated pathways. The
only clinical significance of this difference is that anaphylactoid reactions can occur
without prior sensitization. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, their effects
are similar, and early recognition will determine successful clinical management in
these patients (see Table 10–1 for pitfalls).
When first exposed to a substance, binding antibodies trigger class switching and
regulatory changes in gene expression, effectively priming the immune system for
its next encounter with the offending agent. In certain cases, this leads to immunoglobulin (igE) binding mast cells and basophils. In the classically defined anaphylactic reaction, the antigen again encounters the immune system, binds to the IgE
on the mast cells and basophils, and releases a flood of cytokines that set the clinical
response in motion. In an anaphylactoid reaction, the antigen causes direct release

Table 10–1 • PITFALLS IN ANAPHYLAXIS
Failure to recognize the symptoms of anaphylaxis
Underestimating the severity of laryngeal edema and failure to secure the airway early
Reluctance to administer epinephrine early in the course of illness
Forgetting to remove the allergen; eg, the IV drip of penicillin or bee stinger
Lack of appropriate patient education
Failure to prescribe an epinephrine auto-injector prior to discharge

of cytokines by mast cells and basophils, without need for prior sensitization. In both
cases, the end result is the same, and clinically indistinguishable.
The early stages of some anaphylactic reactions involve increased secretion by
mucous membranes. In addition to watery eyes and rhinorrhea, increased bronchial secretions and increased smooth muscle tone cause wheezing and increase
the work of breathing. Decreased vascular tone and increased capillary permeability
lead to cardiovascular compromise and hypotension. Patients may lose over 30% of
their blood volume to extravasation in the first ten minutes of their allergic reaction.
Other cytokines, specifically histamine, can cause urticaria and angioedema. There
are numerous cytokines involved in the immunologic cascade following exposure,
but no one major substance is felt to be primarily responsible. Leukotriene C4, prostaglandin D2, histamine, and tryptase are known key components in the reaction.
Elevated tryptase levels confirm the diagnosis.

Causes
Some of the most common causes of anaphylaxis are healthcare related, most notoriously allergies to penicillin and sulfa-containing medications. Some studies suggest
as many as 1 in 500 exposures to penicillin will result in anaphylaxis. Radiographic
intravenous contrast agents can also cause anaphylaxis. This reaction is not IgE
mediated, and is more common in patients receiving the less-expensive hyperosmolar agents. Overall, there are an estimated 0.9 fatal reactions per 100,000 patients
exposed to intravenous contrast. This number skyrockets to 60% in patients who
have had a prior exposure and reaction.
Hymenoptera, or bee and wasp, stings are another cause of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis from stings results in an average of 50 deaths per year in the United States.
Overall, the number of cases of arthropod anaphylaxis seen by physicians is small
compared to the number of iatrogenic cases, but because exposures often occur miles
from medical treatment, they can have serious outcomes.
Food sources round out the major causes of serious allergic reactions. Peanuts are
easily the most common cause of serious allergies, but any food can be responsible.
Other common food allergens include eggs and shellfish.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is made clinically. The most commonly affected system is the skin, which manifests with angioedema, urticaria, erythema, and pruritus
in at least 80% of patients with anaphylaxis. The cardiovascular system is also
affected, primarily as a result of decrease vasomotor tone and capillary leakage.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

117

This leads to hypotension and tachycardia. Respiratory compromise is common.
Bronchospasm and bronchorrhea in the lower respiratory tract in combination
with edema of the upper respiratory tract are the most feared and difficult to manage
aspects of anaphylaxis. After administration of epinephrine, control of the airway the
most important therapeutic intervention, as nearly all deaths caused by anaphylaxis
are a result of airway compromise. Early and aggressive airway management—
surgical if needed—is indicated in these patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms including
nausea, cramping, and diarrhea may be seen, and are associated with particularly
severe anaphylactic reactions.

Clinical Criteria for Diagnosis of Anaphylaxis
Clinical criteria were developed from a multidisciplinary symposium to best identify
anaphylaxis early and accurately. Anaphylaxis is highly likely if any one of the following three diagnostic criteria exist.
1. Acute onset (minutes to hours) with reaction of the skin and/or mucosal tissue in
addition to respiratory symptoms or hypotension. Skin symptoms include itching, redness, hives, generalized urticaria, and mucosal edema, Respiratory manifestations include laryngeal stridor, bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, and hypoxia.
Hypotension results from extravasation of fluid from the vasculature and loss of
vasomotor tone.
2. Two or more of the following occurring rapidly (minutes to hours) after exposure
to a likely allergen: involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue, respiratory symptoms, hypotension, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms
include abdominal pain, cramping, and diarrhea.
3. Hypotension occurring rapidly (minutes to hours) after exposure to known
allergen for that patient. Hypotension may present as faintness or altered mental status.

Treatment
The primary initial therapy for anaphylaxis is epinephrine (Table 10–2). Epinephrine will act as a pressor for hemodynamic support, a bronchodilator to relieve
wheezing, as well as to counteract released mediators and prevent their further
release. Epinephrine can be dosed intramuscularly or intravenously. Subcutaneous
administration of epinephrine is no longer recommended as it has been proven less
effective than intramuscular administration. Initial administration is intramuscular
in the anterior thigh with the more concentrated 1:1000 dose at 0.3 to 0.5 mL every
5 minutes. If there is no response or if the patient is already demonstrating cardiovascular compromise, intravenous administration should be started immediately.
IV epinephrine dosing can be confusing and potentially dangerous by provoking
cardiac dysrhythmias. In general, all ampules of epinephrine have 1 mg of medication (1 mL of 1:1000 = 1 mg of medication; 10 mL of 1:100,000 = 1 mg of medication). One method of administration is to place 1 mg (1 ampule) of epinephrine
into 1 L of intravenous fluid (equivalent to 1 lg/mL) and infuse to 1 to 4 cc/min
(1-4 lg/min). This allows for precise titration of dosing to desired effect, and

provides more rapid administration of epinephrine than intramuscular dosing. Caution should be exercised in the elderly and in those with known cardiovascular
disease. Intravenous administration of epinephrine can cause hypertension, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia.
Inhaled beta agonists are indicated for wheezing, and nebulized racemic epinephrine has been hypothesized to decrease laryngeal edema. Intravenous glucagon has
been proposed for individuals on a-blockers in the event they are unresponsive
to epinephrine. Glucagon may overcome hypotension by activating adenyl cyclase
independent of the beta receptor.
Other adjuvants include systemic steroids, specifically methylprednisolone and
prednisone. Steroids will not take action for at least 6 hours, but will blunt further immune responses. Steroids should be continued for days after the reaction
and gradually tapered. H1 and H2 blockers should also be administered. Again, the

goal of therapy is to mitigate the effects of as many cytokines as possible. Diphenhydramine and ranitidine are the most commonly employed agents. It should be
remembered that these other medications, while safe and easy to administer, are not
first-line agents, and will not counteract respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.

10.4 A 32-year-old man collapses in the emergency room after being brought in by
paramedics. He was stung by a bee and known to be highly allergic. He appears
cyanotic and had extreme stridor in the ambulance. Severe laryngeal edema is
notable. Which of the following is the best treatment?
A. Nebulized albuterol, H1 and H2 antagonists, corticosteroids, and crystalloids
B. Subcutaneous epinephrine, H1 and H2 antagonists, and corticosteroids
C. Rapid sequence intubation, subcutaneous epinephrine, and corticosteroids
D. Intramuscular epinephrine, rapid sequence intubation, and corticosteroids
E. Intravenous epinephrine, rapid sequence intubation with preparation for a surgical airway, corticosteroids, nebulized albuterol, and H1 and H2 antagonists

ANSWERS
10.1 C. Hypotension indicates a systemic reaction and cardiovascular compromise,
thereby classifying this allergic reaction as anaphylaxis. The other option may
all be part of an anaphylactic response, but may also just be simple allergic
reactions.
10.2 D. Intramuscular epinephrine should be administered immediately. If there
is signiﬁcant respiratory or airway compromise, then the patient should be
controlled.
10.3 D. Again, early recognition of anaphylaxis and immediate dosing of epinephrine is most important.
10.4 E. This patient has severe anaphylaxis, and it would be appropriate to move
straight to intravenous epinephrine. If intravenous dosing is not immediately
available, then intramuscular epinephrine should be given. Attention should
then be turned to managing the airway. Because of the signiﬁcant laryngeal
edema, endotracheal intubation will be nearly impossible; hence, cricothyroidotomy may be required. After securing the airway, steroids, beta agonists,
H1 and H2 antagonists should be administered.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

121

CLINICAL PEARLS


The airway should be secured early and often. It is much easier to extubate a patient without severe laryngeal edema than to intubate a patient
with an occluded posterior oropharynx.



Epinephrine should be given at the first sign of cardiovascular compromise.



Look for causes of anaphylaxis after you have started your initial resuscitation.



Steroids, antihistamines, and beta agonists are all helpful pharmacologic
adjuvants for managing the many symptoms of anaphylaxis.

department with a 33-year-old asthmatic. As she is brought in, you immediately
notice that she is struggling to breathe. Sweat pours from her face and body as
her neck and chest heaves in an attempt to inhale another breath. Her efforts are
ultimately futile as consciousness slips away and she becomes apneic.

ANSWERS TO CASE 11:
Acute Exacerbation of Asthma
Summary: This is a case of a 33-year-old woman experiencing a severe asthma attack.
Respiratory arrest is imminent.
• Initial Priorities: The first priority in this patient’s management is addressing
the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation). Based on this presentation, immediate
protection of her airway with rapid-sequence endotracheal intubation is indicated. Simultaneously, this patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor with
automated blood pressure measurement, establishment of IV access, and continuous pulse oximetry.
• Standard treatment options: Basic treatment options include adrenergic agonists
(eg, albuterol, terbutaline), anticholinergic agents, and corticosteroids. Intravenous
magnesium sulfate is often given to patients with severe asthma exacerbations.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathophysiology of respiratory distress caused by acute asthma
exacerbation.
2. Describe the key historical and physical examination features.
3. Be able to discuss treatment options for the patient with acute bronchospasm
caused by asthma.

Considerations
This 33-year-old asthmatic patient has progressive respiratory difficulty until she
becomes apneic. Regardless of the underlying etiology, airway and breathing are the
most important initial concerns in any patient. Attention to the airway is critical,
and in this case, rapid-sequence endotracheal intubation is the best option. Because
airway issues may arise at any given time, the emergency room physician must be
skilled, rehearsed, and have equipment to perform endotracheal intubation at any
given time. Protection of the airway and mechanical ventilation is the best therapy
in this instance. Administration of beta-agonist agents, corticosteroids, anticholinergic agents, and search for the trigger are likewise important.

APPROACH TO:
Asthma
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
In the United States, asthma accounts for more than 2 million emergency department
(ED) visits, 456,000 hospitalizations, and 3500 deaths each year. Overall, between 4%

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

125

and 8% of all adults carry a diagnosis of asthma, with a higher prevalence reported in
children, the elderly, and in Hispanic and African Americans. It is the most common
chronic disease in children and adolescents and the third leading cause of preventable
hospitalizations in the United States. Asthma results in more than 10 million lost
school and workdays per year, and results in $30 billion of medical expenses per year.
Asthma is considered a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. It consists
of narrowing of the airway leading to reduced airflow and can be induced by smooth
muscle contraction, thickening of the airway wall, and the presence of secretions
within the airway lumen in response to an inciting allergen. In susceptible individuals, these changes result in recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest
tightness, and cough.
Two distinct phases of asthma have been described. The early (or immediate)
phase of asthma consists of acute airway hyperresponsiveness and reversible
bronchoconstriction. Following allergen challenge, the lungs begin to constrict
within 10 minutes. Peak bronchoconstriction occurs at 30 minutes and either
spontaneously or with treatment resolves within 1 to 3 hours. With continued
allergen challenge or with refractory bronchoconstriction, this initial phase can
progress into the late phase of asthma. This late (or delayed) phase of asthma
begins 3 to 4 hours after the allergen challenge and constitutes the inflammatory
component seen with acute asthma. Inflammatory cell recruitment, bronchial
edema, mucoserous secretion, and further bronchoconstriction all play key roles in
the development and propagation of late-phase asthma. Whereas beta-2 agonists
target the immediate phase of asthma, corticosteroids target the delayed phase.

Diagnosis
The typical asthma exacerbation is characterized by cough, chest tightness, dyspnea,
and wheezing in a patient with a known asthma history. Formal diagnosis is made
by spirometry with 75% of asthmatics diagnosed before age 7. Although wheezing
characterizes airway obstruction and is often thought of as the hallmark finding in
asthma, it is not specific to asthma, and can be absent during severe asthma exacerbations. The history and physical examination should focus on excluding other
diagnoses while evaluating the severity of the current asthma exacerbation. Key
features to elicit are the nature and time course of the symptoms, precipitating triggers (Table 11–1), use of medication prior to arrival, and any high-risk historical
features (Table 11–2).
The evaluation of an asthmatic patient begins with the general appearance of
the patient. Those who are extremely anxious or drowsy, unable to speak in full sentences secondary to respiratory distress, or are using accessory muscles of inspiration
(tripod position/inability to lay supine) are at significant risk for rapid decompensation. Additional worrisome features are signs of central cyanosis, hypoxia (pulse
oximetry <90%), significant tachypnea (>30 breaths per minute), tachycardia, diaphoresis, diffuse or absent wheezing, and poor air entry on pulmonary examination.
Although extremely helpful, physical examination findings are not sensitive
indicators of a clinically severe exacerbation. Since asthmatics have a propensity
for deteriorating quickly, an objective measure of severity should be sought whenever possible. Bedside testing that measures peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) or

Hormonal fluctuations

fractional expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) are simple, inexpensive ways of
measuring the severity of airway obstruction and are commonly used to monitor
response to treatment in the ED. Severe asthma is defined as an FEV1 of less than
50% of predicted (typically <200 L/min in an adult) or one’s own personal best
measurement.
Routine laboratory investigations (eg, complete blood count, basic metabolic
panel), arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, chest radiography, and cardiac monitoring
are not required in the uncomplicated asthmatic. Table 11–3 suggests indications for
each of these modalities.

MANAGEMENT
Immediate priorities in the management of all asthma patients include an initial
assessment of the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation status. Patients in
extremis require placement of peripheral intravenous lines, continuous supplemental oxygen therapy, and cardiac monitoring. While these interventions are underway, the physician should ascertain a history, perform a physical examination, and
initiate appropriate therapy.

Oxygen, Compressed Air, and Heliox
Oxygen should be provided to maintain a pulse oximetry reading of at least 90% in
adults and at least 95% in infants, pregnant women, and patients with coexisting
heart disease. Oxygen is often used as the delivery vehicle for nebulized medications,
although compressed air and helium-oxygen mixtures (heliox) can also be used.

Heliox mixtures produce a more laminar airflow and potentially deliver nebulized
particles to more distal airways, but they have not been shown to consistently lead
to improved ED outcomes for all asthmatic patients. A systematic review concluded
that heliox may be beneficial only in patients who present with severe asthma that
is refractory to initial treatment.

Adrenergic Agents
Inhaled albuterol, through nebulization or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer
device, is the mainstay of treatment for acute asthma. Typically 2.5 to 5 mg of
albuterol is intermittently nebulized every 15 to 20 minutes for the first hour of
therapy and then repeated every 30 minutes thereafter for 1 to 2 more hours. Continuous nebulization with higher doses (10-20 mg/h) of albuterol benefits severe
asthmatics. Beta-2 agonists bind pulmonary receptors and activate adenyl cyclase
which results in an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP). This results in a drop in myoplasmic calcium and subsequent bronchial
smooth-muscle relaxation. In addition, beta-2 agonists are thought to have some
anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting inflammatory mediator release. Side
effects of these agents are generally mild and include tachycardia, nervousness, and
shakiness or jitteriness.
Alternatively, albuterol can be administered with an MDI and spacer device. In
the ED, patients can receive 4 to 8 puffs every 15 to 20 minutes for the first hour of
therapy and then every 30 minutes thereafter for 1 to 2 more hours. MDI with spacer
device therapy is therapeutically equivalent to nebulizer therapy in adults and may
be more efficacious than nebulizer therapy in children as less medication is lost to
the environment. Implementation of MDI with spacer device therapy for asthmatics
in the ED is also associated with decreased health care cost.
Although inhalation therapy is optimal, occasionally patients with severe
obstruction or who cannot tolerate inhalation therapy (eg, children) are given subcutaneous administration of epinephrine or terbutaline. Epinephrine is given in a
dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mg subcutaneously every 20 minutes to a maximal combined total
dose of 1 mg. Terbutaline is given 0.25 mg subcutaneously every 20 minutes up to

128

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

a maximum of three doses. Generally, terbutaline is preferable because of its beta-2
selectivity and fewer cardiac side effects.
Levalbuterol, the R-isomer of racemic albuterol, was developed because in vitro
studies suggested that the S-isomer may have deleterious effects on airway smooth
muscle. However, randomized trials have not shown a significant clinical advantage of levalbuterol over racemic albuterol for the treatment of acute asthma in the
emergency department. National asthma treatment guidelines currently consider
levalbuterol equally safe and effective to racemic albuterol and endorse its use for
the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations.

Anticholinergic Agents
When added to albuterol, anticholinergic agents lead to a modest improvement in
pulmonary function and decrease the admission rate in patients with moderate to
severe asthma exacerbations. Anticholinergics decrease intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations, which reduce vagal nerve-mediated
bronchoconstriction on medium- and larger-sized airways. Additionally, anticholinergic agents may have some minor anti-inflammatory properties that help to
stabilize capillary permeability and inhibit mucous secretion. The typical dose for
ipratropium bromide is two puffs from a MDI with spacer device, or 0.5 mL of the
0.02% solution. Anticholinergics can be combined with beta agonists in nebulization devices and should be given to those not responding to initial beta-agonist
therapy and those with severe airway obstruction. Since there is little systemic
absorption, inhaled anticholinergics are associated with few side effects.

Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids have been used to treat chronic asthma since 1950 and acute exacerbations of the disease since 1956. Although a tremendous amount of research
has been done on the value of corticosteroids in asthma, many fundamental issues
have yet to be resolved, such as the optimal dose, route, and timing of steroids. It
is generally agreed that corticosteroids should be initiated early in the treatment of
the following cases:
• Acute asthma in patients with moderate/severe asthma attack
• Worsening asthma over many days (>3 days)
• Mild asthma not responding to initial bronchodilator therapy or asthma that
develops despite daily inhaled corticosteroid use.
Some authors believe that more liberal use of corticosteroids is warranted and
advocate steroids for any patient whose symptoms fail to resolve with a single albuterol treatment. Even more liberal asthmatologists prefer that steroids be given for
every asthma patient who is sick enough to warrant ED evaluation.
Steroids act on the delayed phase of asthma and modulate the inflammatory
response. They have been shown to improve pulmonary function, decrease the rate
of hospital admission, and decrease the rate of relapse in patients that receive them
early in their ED treatment course. Oral administration of prednisone (dose 40-60
mg) is usually preferred to intravenous methylprednisolone (dose 125 mg), because it

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

129

is less invasive and the effects are equivalent. Intravenous steroids, however, should
be administered to patients with severe respiratory distress who are too dyspneic
to swallow, patients who are vomiting, or patients who are agitated or drowsy. For
patients who will be discharged, a single intramuscular dose of methylprednisolone
(dose 160 mg) may be given when there is a history of medication noncompliance.
A 2-day course of oral dexamethasone (dose 16 mg) is also an option because it has
been shown to be equivalent to five days of prednisone. Alternative steroids include
hydrocortisone 150 to 200 mg IV, dexamethasone 6 to 10 mg IV, or oral dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose 16 mg) in pediatric patients.

Leukotriene Antagonists
The development of leukotriene antagonists represents an important advancement
in the treatment of chronic asthma. Studies involving zileuton (Zyflo Filmtab), zafirlukast (Accolate), and montelukast (Singulair) demonstrate that their daily use
over the course of several months can lead to improvement in pulmonary function
and decrease in asthma symptomatology. However, the role of leukotriene antagonists in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations remains unclear. A randomized
study of intravenous montelukast showed that it significantly improved FEV1 when
added to standard asthma therapy, but this improvement in lung function did not
translate to lower hospitalization rates. At this time, asthma treatment guidelines
recommend the use of leukotriene antagonists only in the management of chronic
asthma.

Magnesium
Although no benefit has been shown in mild to moderate asthmatics, magnesium
sulfate given intravenously at dosages of 2 to 4 g benefits asthmatics with severe
airway obstruction. Magnesium is thought to compete with calcium for entry into
smooth muscle, inhibit the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum,
prevent acetylcholine release from nerve endings, and inhibit mast cell release
of histamine. Additionally, there is some evidence that magnesium may directly
inhibit smooth muscle contraction, but this is controversial. The onset of magnesium is quick and effects can be seen 2 to 5 minutes after initiation of therapy.
The effects are short lived and diminish quickly when the infusion is stopped. The
dose of magnesium is 2 to 4 g IV in adults and 30 to 70 mg/kg IV in children given
over 10 to 15 minutes. Magnesium has minimal side effects. The most commonly
reported are hypotension, a flushing sensation, and malaise. It is contraindicated
in renal failure and in cases of hypermagnesemia as it can cause significant muscle
weakness.

Other Agents—Methylxanthines, Antibiotics
The marginal benefit, significant side effects, and difficulty achieving a therapeutic
dose of theophylline argue against its routine use in acute asthma. A systematic
review concluded that the addition of aminophylline to treatment with beta
agonists and glucocorticoids improved lung function, but did not significantly
reduce symptoms or length of hospital stay. Therefore, methylxanthines are
not recommended in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations. The routine

130

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

administration of antibiotics has also not been shown to decrease symptomatology in asthma patients without concurrent bacterial lower respiratory infection
or sinusitis.

Positive Pressure Ventilation
Positive pressure ventilation (PPV), with either invasive or noninvasive methods,
is indicated for patients with respiratory failure or impending failure who are not
responsive to therapy. Several studies have suggested that bi-level positive airway
pressure (BiPAP) may be beneficial in severe asthma exacerbations. For example,
a randomized trial enrolled severe asthmatics (defined as FEV1 <60% and RR>30)
to receive BiPAP and found significant improvements in pulmonary function and
reduced rates of hospitalization. Severe asthmatics with impending respiratory failure should receive a trial of BiPAP prior to being intubated. The BiPAP machine
should be set at inspiratory pressure 8 to 15 cm H2O and expiratory pressure 3 to
5 cm H2O. Patients who fail to improve over 30 to 60 minutes will likely require
intubation. Furthermore, contrary to prior teaching, a short trial (30 minutes) of
BiPAP is considered acceptable for mild to moderate altered level of consciousness
attributed to hypercapnea.
Immediate rapid-sequence endotracheal intubation should be reserved for
unconscious or near-comatose patients with respiratory failure. In an awake patient,
an appropriate induction agent (eg, ketamine) and paralytic agent (eg, succinylcholine) should be used prior to intubation. Ketamine is the induction agent of choice
because it stimulates the release of catecholamines and causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation. Numerous case reports have also
demonstrated that a ketamine infusion may be useful when severe asthmatics fail to
respond to conventional treatments. Ketamine is given as an intravenous bolus of
1 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/h.
Once an asthmatic patient is intubated, the ventilator should be set to promote
the goal of permissive hypercapnea which aims at minimizing dynamic hyperinflation (ie, breath stacking or auto-PEEP [positive end-expiratory pressure]) with low
tidal volumes, and increased time for expiration, while limiting plateau pressures. It
is critical to recognize that mechanically ventilated asthmatic patients are at high
risk for hyperinflation and auto-PEEP which can result in life threatening complications such as tension pneumothorax or cardiac arrest. Suggested initial settings are
Assist Control mode at a respiratory rate of 8 to 10 breaths per minute, tidal volume
6 to 8 mL/kg, no extrinsic PEEP, inspiratory-to-expiratory (I/E) ratio of 1:4, and an
inspiratory flow rate of 80 to 100 L/min. To prevent barotrauma, plateau pressures
should not exceed 30 cm H2O. Following initiation of PPV, blood-gas analysis can
be used to modify ventilator or BiPAP settings.

ADMISSION/DISCHARGE CRITERIA
Acute asthma is a heterogeneous condition and as such patients should be individualized when it comes to disposition decisions. Patients who respond well to
therapy by improved subjective and objective criteria (eg, symptoms resolved, normal or near-normal pulmonary examination) are suitable candidates for discharge.
Patients should be on room air and moving about the emergency department before

finalizing the decision to discharge the patient. An improvement of PEFR or FEV1
to greater than 70% predicted or personal best can also be used as a sign of objective improvement. Hospital admission should be considered in patients that fail to
respond to therapy (ie, PEFR or FEV1 < 50% predicted) after 4 to 6 hours of treatment or patients with partial response to therapy (ie, PEFR or FEV1 between 50%
and 70% predicted) and one or all of the following:
1. New-onset asthma
2. Multiple prior hospitalizations or ED visits
3. Have comorbidity from coronary artery disease
4. Have significant medical or social issues that impair access to health care, personal judgment, or understanding of their disease.
Asthmatics who are discharged from the ED should receive albuterol, an MDI
spacer device, and a 5- to 10-day course of oral steroids. Most patients should be
treated for at least 1 week, but can stop their oral steroids based on resolutions of
their symptoms and self-monitored peak flow values. Tapering is not necessary if the
duration of steroid treatment is less than 3 weeks, if inhaled steroids are concomitantly prescribed for preventative ongoing therapy, or as long as the patient has not
recently been on steroid therapy.
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) should be prescribed to anyone with frequent
beta-agonist MDI use and is symptomatic enough to warrant urgent medical evaluation. Several studies have demonstrated that ICS improve lung function, diminish
symptoms, and decrease “rescue use” of beta agonists. Beneficial effects of ICS can
be observed after a single dose and therapeutic effects are achieved with chronic
administration. Furthermore, one can initiate treatment alongside oral steroids
without fear of added systemic toxicity. Recent studies have documented a significant reduction in relapse rates when combining oral and inhaled steroids. For
patients who continue to have poorly controlled asthma and recurrent exacerbations despite maximal therapy, other medications may be added such as long-acting
inhaled beta agonists, oral leukotriene antagonists, and omalizumab (a monoclonal
anti-IgE antibody).
While awaiting discharge, MDI with spacer device technique should be reviewed
with the patient, and the patient should be instructed on how to monitor peak
flow readings at home. Additionally, patients should be educated about the common
asthma precipitants and how to avoid them, as well as receive written and verbal
instructions on when to return to the ED. Finally, patients should be referred for a
follow-up medical appointment in a timely manner. Arranging ongoing care with
an asthma specialist or a clinic focusing on asthma patients is more likely to reduce
subsequent emergency department visits. Patients who are unable to follow up with
their primary physician can be instructed to return to the ED for a recheck of their
symptoms.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
11.1 A 24-year-old man is brought into the ED complaining of an exacerbation of
his asthma. Which of the following is the most appropriate method of assessing
the severity of his disease?
A. Spirometry
B. Measurement of the diffusion capacity of the lungs
C. Measurement of the peak expiratory flow
D. Measurement of the alveoli oxygen tension
11.2 A 19-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for an exacerbation of asthma
likely precipitated by pollen and colder weather. Her inpatient regimen
includes both intravenous and inhalant medications. Which of the following
medications is most likely to be used as part of discharge plan?
A. Theophylline
B. Antibiotics
C. Magnesium
D. Histamines
E. Corticosteroids
11.3 Which of the following initial ventilator settings is appropriate for intubated
asthmatics?
A. IMV mode, rate 16, tidal volume 6 to 8 mL/kg
B. IMV mode, rate 16, tidal volume 10 to 12 mL/kg
C. AC mode, rate 8 to 10, tidal volume 6 to 8 mL/kg
D. AC mode, rate 8 to 10, tidal volume 10 to 12 mL/kg
E. AC mode, rate 16, tidal volume 6 to 8 mL/kg

ANSWERS
11.1 C. The peak expiratory flow is a reliable and fairly accurate method of assessing
asthma severity. Spirometry, although providing important information, is
rarely available in the ED.
11.2 E. Corticosteroids are often used after a hospitalization. Other standard medications include beta-agonists and oral leukotriene antagonists. None of the
other medications are used routinely for discharged asthma patients.
11.3 C. The initial settings for patients with obstructive lung disease should be AC
mode, rate 8 to 10, tidal volume 6 to 8 mL/kg. Low volumes and small tidal
volumes are used to prevent air stacking and barotrauma.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

133

CLINICAL PEARLS


Initiate therapy with albuterol while obtaining history and performing a
physical examination for patients with significant asthma.



Glucocorticosteroids should be administered early for asthmatic exacerbations and continued for at least 1 week.



Measure peak flow to help assess asthma severity and monitor progression during treatment.



Use lower than traditional ventilator settings to prevent barotrauma in the
intubated asthmatic.



Most asthmatics should be discharged from the ED with inhaled corticosteroids for ongoing preventative therapy.



The individual who presents with an initial episode of “wheezing” may
have etiologies other than asthma, for example, foreign body, pneumonia,
or congestive heart failure.



Absence of wheezing can sometimes be misleading in the individual in
extremis because of very little air movement.

CASE 12
A 32-year-old man, involved in a motor vehicle collision (MVC), is brought to the
emergency department (ED). He lost control of his car and hit a utility pole with
the front end of his car, while traveling at approximately 35 MPH. He was thrown
against the windshield of the car, hitting his face and forehead against the windshield. There was no loss of consciousness. His blood pressure is 125/79 mm Hg,
heart rate is 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and
pulse oxygenation is 99% on room air. On examination, he has a 7-cm laceration
on the right side of his face that courses from his right ear to just below the lower
lip. He is alert and has no focal neurologic deficits on examination. When he is
asked to smile, the right side of his mouth droops.

ANSWERS TO CASE 12:
Facial Laceration
Summary: A 32-year-old man presents to the ED after a motor vehicle collision. There
is no evidence of injury except for a 7-cm laceration on the right side of his face, which
courses from his ear, to across the cheek, and ends just below the right lower lip. His
neurologic examination is normal except for the inability to smile on the right side.
• Most likely diagnosis: Right facial nerve laceration
• Most appropriate therapy: Microsurgical repair of right facial nerve and closure
of skin laceration

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the critical structures that can be injured in facial lacerations.
2. Understand the need for tetanus immunization in trauma patients.
3. Know the basic principles of facial laceration repair.

Considerations
This patient suffered a laceration across his right cheek after being involved in a motor
vehicle collision. The mainstay in trauma management includes managing the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Once the primary survey is complete, the
physician then performs the secondary survey, which includes a head-to-toe physical
examination that evaluates for non–life-threatening injuries. Any trauma to the
head, face, or neck should raise concern for a cervical spine (C-spine) injury. If
there is suspicion for a C-spine injury, the patient should be placed in a rigid cervical collar until either appropriate imaging can be performed or appropriate clinical
evaluation completed. Facial trauma often results in bony injuries to the orbits and
mandible. Injury to cranial nerves V and VII are common. The facial nerve (CN
VII) exits the stylomastoid foramen and branches into motor and sensory branches
to the temporal, zygomatic, buccal, and mental regions. Lacerations to the buccal
branch are associated with injury to the parotid duct. Identification of a facial nerve
injury is critical because delayed diagnosis results in poor outcome. Microsurgical
techniques give fairly good results. After repair of the injury, the patient needs a tetanus immunization if the last time the patient received a tetanus vaccine was longer
than 5 years ago.

APPROACH TO:
Facial Lacerations
DEFINITIONS
FACIAL TRAUMA: Any soft or deep tissue injury secondary to physical force,
burns, or foreign objects to the following structures: the scalp, forehead, nose, eyes,
lips, cheeks, tongue, oral cavity, and jaw.
VERMILLION BORDER: The junction between the lip and facial skin. An
injury to this area can result in a significant cosmetic defect if not repaired correctly.
AURICULAR HEMATOMA: Collection of blood in the ear that results from
the traumatic interruption of the perichondrium and cartilage. If left untreated,
it can evolve into a fibrous mass leaving the affected ear with a cauliflower-like
appearance.
SADDLE NOSE DEFORMITY: Nasal injury secondary to the necrotic breakdown of the septal cartilage. It is caused by a traumatic injury to the nose resulting
in a nasal septal hematoma. If the hematoma is left untreated, it separates the septal
cartilage from its perichondrium depriving it of its nutrient supply.
TETANUS: An often fatal infectious disease caused by the bacteria Clostridium
tetani, which usually enters the body through a puncture, cut, or open wound.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The basic approach to wound care includes assessment for other injuries, probing
the depth of the wound, irrigation, a neurovascular examination, and deciding on
whether primary closure is advisable (ie, leave open if infection is likely such as
contamination or delay in presentation). The length of time the suture stays in place
and the type of suture depends on the body location (Table 12–1). Additionally, the
need to update the patient’s tetanus vaccination should be assessed.

Irrigation
When the decision to suture is made, a stepwise preparation must take place. All
wounds must first be irrigated and explored for foreign bodies and environmental debris. Proper irrigation can significantly reduce the risk of wound infection.
High-pressure and large-volume irrigation remains the gold standard to reduce or
eliminate particulate matter and bacterial loads from the wound. This is usually
established with a 35- to 60-mL syringe and 16- to 19-gauge catheter using constant
hand pressure. This generates a pressure of 5 to 8 psi, which is adequate to irrigate a
wound. Sterile saline is the most commonly used irrigant. Application of povidone
iodine, hydrogen peroxide, and detergents should be avoided because of their toxic
effects on tissue.

Anesthesia
Once irrigation is complete and the wound is examined, anesthesia should be
administered. Delaying anesthesia until irrigation is completed allows the patient
to reveal any sensation of a retained foreign body that might dislodge during irrigation. Local anesthetics are divided into two major groups, amides and esters.
Although it is rare, some patients are allergic to anesthetics. However, if a patient
is allergic to one class, the other class can be safely administered. It is thought that
the allergy is to the preservative in the anesthetic, rather than the anesthetic itself
(Table 12–2).
Local anesthesia can be attained in many ways including injection directly into
the wound, topical application, or by a nerve block. The most common method
is local infiltration. Several techniques are available to reduce pain experienced
by the patient during injection. These include using smaller gauge needles, injecting at a slow rate, infiltrating the wound edge instead of surrounding skin, adding
sodium bicarbonate to the anesthetic solution at a 1:10 dilution, and warming the
solution. Some authors recommend first applying topical anesthetic. This is particularly useful in the pediatric population. Initially TAC (tetracaine, 0.25%-0.5%;
adrenaline, 0.025%-0.05%; cocaine, 4%-11%) was commonly used, but was associated with seizure, arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest. LET (lidocaine, 4%; epinephrine,
0.1%; tetracaine, 0.5%) is generally safer than TAC and is used for anesthesia of the
face and scalp. EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) consists of lidocaine
and prilocaine and is also commonly used. Because of the possibility for systemic
absorption of lidocaine and tetracaine, these anesthetics should be avoided in large
wounds and mucus membranes.
Epinephrine is added to many anesthetic solutions. This augments hemostasis
and prolongs the duration of action of the anesthetic by decreasing systemic absorption through local vasoconstriction. Although it is controversial, it is recommended
to avoid injecting solutions with epinephrine into sites such as digits, the tip of
the nose, ears, and penis due to the risk of necrosis.

Suture Placement
To reduce scarring, sutures on the face should be placed approximately 1 to 2 mm
from the wound edge and 3 mm apart. Cosmesis is less of a concern with other body
areas.

Wound Closure
Once the wound is irrigated, explored, and anesthetized, closure can begin. Below
are several methods and approaches for wound closure depending on the site of
injury; addressing proper methods to examine specific areas and appropriate closure
techniques.

Scalp and Forehead
These lacerations are usually caused by a combination of blunt and sharp trauma.
Careful inspection of the wound is critical, with care to palpate for depressed skull
fractures, and assess the integrity of the galea aponeurosis, which covers the periosteum. Repair usually follows the skin lines for the best cosmetic result. The scalp
should be closed with a 4-0 monofilament suture of different color than the
patient’s hair or staples can be used. Sutures and staples should be removed after
7 to 10 days. Because scalp lacerations can be associated with significant hemorrhage, rapid closure with staples may decrease the blood loss. If the galea is involved,
it should be repaired with long-lasting absorbable suture material (eg, Vicryl,
Monocryl). Closing the galea helps to control heavy bleeding associated with scalp
wounds and limits the spread of potential infection. Forehead lacerations should

140

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

be repaired in layers. The skin should be approximated with 6-0 nonabsorbable
interrupted sutures, and removed after 5 days. Care should be taken to precisely
approximate hair lines.

Eyelids
The eyelid is thin and delicate and is functionally and cosmetically important.
Because of the risk of periorbital trauma, the emergency physician should have a
low threshold to refer to an oculoplastic specialist or ophthalmologist for evaluation and repair. This includes lacerations to upper and lower lid margins and those
involving the lacrimal duct. Any laceration medial to the puncta should be highly
concerning for a canicular system injury. Staining the laceration with fluorescein
dye can be used to determine damage to the canaliculus. In addition, damage to the
levator palpebrae superioris muscle should be ruled out with traumatic lacerations
of the upper lid. This commonly manifests as ptosis. A majority of eyelid lacerations
can be managed without suture repair, including lacerations that are superficial and
involve less that 25% of the eyelid. When sutures are indicated, repair is generally
undertaken with 6-0 or 7-0 interrupted sutures, with care to stay superficial; the
suture is removed after 3 to 5 days.

Nose
The nose is commonly injured, and is the most common fracture in victims of
domestic violence. It is the focal point of the face, thus it is important to ensure
proper management of nasal lacerations for optimal cosmesis. Inspection for the
depth of injury is important. Infection can occur when all of the layers are penetrated or when cartilage is exposed. Septal trauma may lead to hematoma formation, which can lead to necrosis of the septum or chronic obstruction of the
nasal passageway. Untreated hematoma separates the septal cartilage from its perichondrium depriving it from the nutrient supply. The septal cartilage can necrose
resulting in a saddle nose deformity. Therefore, septal hematomas require drainage.
Anesthesia in this area is difficult because of the tightness of skin over the cartilage,
but can be obtained via a dorsal nerve block. Injection directly into a wound can
distort wound edges for repair and is extremely uncomfortable, as well. Epinephrine
must be avoided in this area. Topical lidocaine is generally helpful. Cartilage lacerations should be repaired with 4-0 or 5-0 absorbable sutures, and the skin closed with
6-0 nonabsorbable suture for 3 to 5 days. Lacerations to the nasal alae are usually
complex and difficult to anesthetize; these wounds often require consultation of a
plastic or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeon.

Lips
The junction between the skin and the red portion of the lip, the vermillion border, is of vital cosmetic importance. Additionally, the orbicularis oris muscle that
surrounds the mouth is critical for facial expression, speech formation, and the
retention of saliva. Lacerations involving the lip that do not cross the vermillion
border can be closed in layers with 6-0 nonabsorbable suture and left in place for
5 days. If the vermilion border is disrupted, the first stitch in repair should exactly
approximate the border using 6-0 nonabsorbable suture. This first suture needs to be

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

141

precise, because even a 1-mm discrepancy is noticeable (Figure 12–1). A plastic
surgeon can be consulted for these injuries. Regional anesthesia is helpful, because
local anesthetic infiltration can obscure the anatomy. The most common regional
blocks include the mental nerve block and infraorbital block for the lower and upper
lip, respectively. All intraoral wounds are dirty wounds and are at high risk for infection. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin or clindamycin is indicated.

Figure 12–1. Lip laceration crossing the vermillion border. The first step is to approximate the
vermillion-skin junction, the orbicularis muscle is then approximated and, finally, the skin is
repaired.

142

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Ears
In patients with trauma to the ear region, the physician should evaluate the patient
for a basilar skull fracture or tympanic membrane rupture. After inspection, cotton can be placed into the ear canal during irrigation of any lacerations. Regional
auricular block is effective, and again, epinephrine should be avoided. Lacerations
of the ear should be approached with the following goals: cosmesis, avoidance of
hematoma, and prevention of infection. Repair of lacerated ear tissue should mirror
its symmetric counterpart as much as possible for the best cosmetic results. Superficial lacerations should be repaired with 6-0 nonabsorbable sutures, and removed in
5 days. Meticulous hemostasis is important to prevent hematoma formation. If an
auricular hematoma is present, and is left unaddressed, the ear is prone to abnormal
cartilage production and subsequent calcification commonly referred to as a “cauliflower ear.” Auricular hematoma, avulsed tissue, or crushed cartilage is probably best
handled by a plastic surgeon or otolaryngologist. Any cartilage that is exposed should
be covered to reduce infection, erosive chondritis, and subsequent necrosis. If a plastic surgeon or otolaryngologist are unavailable, small superficial lacerations should
be repaired with uninterrupted sutures. Sutures should be placed in the skin surrounding these wounds paying special attention to avoid suturing the ear cartilage,
which could lead to avascular necrosis. After the laceration is repaired, a pressure
dressing should be applied to help prevent the formation of an auricular hematoma.

Cheeks and Face
Lacerations of the cheek and face should be repaired after investigating the vital
structures in the region such as the facial nerve and parotid duct (Figure 12–2). Generally, a 6-0 monofilament interrupted suture technique is appropriate for repair.
Sutures are removed after 5 days. Simple lacerations (<2 cm) isolated to the buccal cavity typically do not need closure. These areas are highly vascularized and
heal well without sutures. Proper irrigation is important to prevent complications
of infection. Lacerations in the buccal cavity greater than 2 cm have the propensity to collect food, which can lead to infection. These typically require closure.
Absorbable 5-0 sutures are preferred. As stated above, all intraoral wounds are
dirty and are at high risk for infection. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin or clindamycin is indicated.

TETANUS IMMUNIZATION
Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, but preventable disease caused by the gram-positive
bacterium Clostridium tetani. The spores are ubiquitous in soil and animal manure.
Contamination of a wound with C tetani, particularly in devitalized, crushed, or
infected tissue, can lead to its proliferation and expression of the neuroexotoxin
tetanospasmin. This powerful exotoxin acts on the motor endplates of skeletal
muscle, the spinal cord, the sympathetic nervous system, and the brain, leading to
generalized muscle rigidity, autonomic nervous system instability, and severe muscle
contractions. The most common presentation of tetanus is muscle spasm of the
masseter muscles, “lockjaw,” but the back, arms, diaphragm, and lower extremities
can also be affected. The diagnosis is made clinically. In up to 10% of tetanus cases,

the patient does not recall a wound. The usual incubation period varies from 7 to
21 days, but can extend from 3 to 56 days.
Patients with tetanus should be admitted to the intensive care unit. Wound
debridement, respiratory support as needed, and muscle relaxants or neuromuscular
blockade may be helpful. Patients with tetanus should receive passive immunization with tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) 3000 to 6000 units IM on the side
opposite of the tetanus toxoid injection. It clearly reduces morbidity and mortality.
Penicillin is usually given, but is of questionable efficacy.
Prevention of tetanus is accomplished with regular active immunization of all
individuals. The dose of tetanus toxoid (TT) or diphtheria/tetanus toxoid (dT) is
0.5 mL IM regardless of age. Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is given in patients
with a possible tetanus exposure and have incomplete tetanus immunization
(<3 injections). The dosage varies with age (Table 12–3). Tetanus immunoglobulin and tetanus toxoid should be administered in different body sites with different
syringes.

146

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS
12.1 E. Lining up the vermillion border is by far the most challenging to repair
because even a 1-mm discrepancy is noticeable. Injuries to the scalp usually
can be repaired with sutures or staples, and are rarely cosmetically debilitating. Injuries to the neck, forehead, and cheek require approximation of wound
edges to ensure appropriate wound healing; however, these lacerations do not
require meticulous approximation as seen in repair of the vermillion boarder. It
is important to point out to your patients that all laceration repairs will leave
a scar.
12.2 C. The patient likely developed a septal hematoma, which caused necrosis to
the septum and the subsequent communication between the nasal passageways. Cocaine is associated with septal perforation secondary to its vasoconstrictive properties. There is no indication that this patient used cocaine. The
use of epinephrine on the nose is contraindicated because of the potential
for necrosis. However, epinephrine is not associated with septal perforation.
Although post-traumatic stress syndrome can be debilitating for patients, it
does not cause septal perforation.
12.3 A. Because the patient likely received a full series of immunizations, but does
not remember the last booster, he should receive tetanus toxoid 0.5 mL IM.
TIG should be reserved for the following patients: those who do not know
their immunization status or know that they never received the full series
of three shots and sustained a contaminated wound. Admission to the ICU
should be considered if the patient has signs of tetanus, such as muscle spasm
or lockjaw.
12.4 C. Small superficial ear lacerations should be repaired with uninterrupted
sutures. Do not place sutures in lacerated ear cartilage. Sutures placed in
the skin surrounding these wounds in the cartilage should include the perichondrium (thin tissue layer overlying the cartilage). This method allows
the approximation at the cartilage edges. Exposed cartilage should be covered or dressed to prevent infection and necrosis. Hemostasis and evacuation
of an auricular hematoma is recommended to prevent the development of
“cauliflower ear.” All patients with interruptions in the skin should be offered
tetanus prophylaxis if their immunization status is not current.
12.5 D. Facial lacerations should be closed with a 6-0 nonabsorbable suture in
interrupted fashion. Staples do not provide the desired cosmesis for a facial
wound repair. Staples are more appropriate for scalp lacerations. Steri-strips
can be used in very small skin openings with minimal tension. They will not
provide the tensile strength required for this patient’s wound closure. Shaving
surrounding hair increases the risk of infection and is not recommended.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The vermillion border must be precisely approximated because of its
important cosmetic characteristics. Even a small discrepancy in lining up
of the tissue is noticeable.



The facial nerve courses from the mastoid region across the cheek area
and is prone to injury in facial lacerations. Care must be taken to identify
an injury to the nerve to prevent permanent deformity.



Complex lacerations of the face, eye, ear, nose, and mouth, including
lacerations associated with focal neurologic deficits (eg, facial droop or
ptosis) should be cared for with expert consultation such as an ENT surgeon or ophthalmologist.



Meticulous hemostasis is important in repairing ear lacerations to avoid
“cauliflower ear.”



Tetanus is an acute disease of wound contamination, which is largely
preventable with immunization. All patients at risk for tetanus and not
up-to-date on their tetanus vaccination should receive tetanus immunoglobulin or tetanus toxoid.

CASE 13
A 15-year-old adolescent boy was cleaning some items in the shed in his backyard,
when he saw a bat in middle of the shed. The bat bit the boy on his dominant
hand, after which the teenager ran into the house. His parents brought the boy
to the emergency department. His vital signs on arrival were a blood pressure of
115/70 mm Hg, heart rate of 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths
per minute, pulse oximetry of 99% on room air, and a temperature of 37.1°C
(98.9°F). Inspection of the wound shows deep bite marks with a laceration close
to the proximal interphalyngeal joint. The bat escaped after the boy was bitten and
was not found.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS TO CASE 13:
Rabies/Animal Bite
Summary: A teenager complains of a deep bite to his dominant hand by a bat acting
strangely. The bite is fresh and the bat cannot be located.
• Most likely diagnosis: Unprovoked attack by a rabies-infected bat.
• Best initial treatment: Notify animal control to locate the animal, then clean
the wound and administer both passive and active rabies immunization to the
patient. Administer tetanus toxoid if not received within the last 5 years.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize that bat bites are a common vector for rabies.
2. Know the treatment of common bite injuries.
3. Know the clinical presentation of rabies.
4. Know the treatments for rabies and when treatment should be given.
5. Understand the basic principles of snakebite management.

Considerations
This 15-year-old teenager encountered a bat exhibiting abnormal behavior. The
bat, normally a nocturnal animal, is active in the afternoon. This is suspicious
for a rabies-infected bat. Other important considerations in this case are that the
patient was bit near a joint space, the patient’s tetanus status, and the possibility
of retained teeth.
In this patient’s case, postexposure prophylaxis for rabies and delayed primary
closure to observe for infection are reasonable. Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies
should include a combination of immediate, passive (rabies immunoglobulin)
immunization and active immunization (human diploid cell vaccine). Tetanus
vaccine should be administered if the patient has not received it within the last
5 years.

VENOM: A specialized form of saliva that is rich in proteins, polypeptides, peptidases, and nucleases. Its effects can range from paralysis, digestion, or incapacitation
to death.

CLINICAL APPROACH
General Bite Management
Good wound care is the mainstay of bite management. A detailed history of the bite
including type of animal, whether provocation occurred, location of bite, and time
since the bite, should be followed by a careful physical examination. Physical examination should focus on the patient’s neurovascular status, the potential for tendon
involvement, any evidence of cellulitis, and the potential for joint space violation.
The wound should be irrigated, tetanus booster updated if more than 5 years has
elapsed since the last administration (see Case 12), and antibiotics administered
if the bite is high risk for infection or already infected. A radiograph should also be
obtained to evaluate for a fracture and retained teeth. For bites with potential tendon injury, the involved extremity should be splinted. Simple bites of the trunk and
extremities (except for hands and feet) less than 6 hours old can generally be closed
primarily. Simple bites of the head and neck area less than 12 hours old also can be
repaired primarily. However, puncture wounds, bites of the hand or foot, wounds
more than 12 hours old, and infected tissues, are usually left open.
With any bite injury, the appropriate authorities should be notified to find the
animal and observe it for abnormal behavior. Prior to arriving to the ED, any open
wound or bite should be thoroughly washed with soap and water. In the ED, irrigation of the wound with saline removes debris and lowers bacterial counts. There
is no added benefit to the addition of hydrogen peroxide or povidone iodine to the
irrigant. Any foreign body or devitalized tissue should be removed. Administering
prophylactic antibiotics in the case of simple bites is left to physician preference, as
there is no conclusive evidence that it reduces infection rates.
The clenched-fist injury, also called a “fight bite,” is especially important to
assess because a small bite injury may deeply embed bacteria into the joint spaces
or tendon sheaths of the hand. This can lead to a serious infection. A radiograph
to assess for fracture or foreign body should be performed. The wound should be
irrigated, the tendons examined, and antibiotics administered. In cases of delayed
evaluation, look for signs of infection including cellulitis, abscess formation, or
tenosynovitis. Due to the high risk of infection, these cases typically require admission to the hospital for IV antibiotics or surgery.

Bacterial Infections
Dogs, cats, and humans account for almost all mammalian bite injuries. Oral flora in
dogs and cats include Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella spp, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Streptococcus, and oral anaerobes. Humans usually have mixed flora, including
S aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Eikenella corrodens and beta-lactamase–positive
oral anaerobes. In cat bite wound infections, P multocida is the most commonly
isolated bacteria. Human bite infections are typically polymicrobial. Good initialchoice antibiotics include amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, ticarcillin–clavulanic acid,

152

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ampicillin–sulbactam, or a second-generation cephalosporin. Duration of administration for established infections is 10 to 14 days and 3 to 5 days for prophylaxis.
Failed outpatient treatment of wound infections is an indication for admission and
IV antibiotics.

Rabies
Rabies is a single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) rhabdovirus that attacks the
central nervous system causing an encephalomyelitis that is almost always fatal. It
has a variable incubation period, averaging 1 to 2 months, but may be as short as
7 days or as long as 1 year. Clinical presentation begins with a 1- to 4-day prodrome
with fever, headache, malaise, nausea, emesis, and a productive cough. An encephalic stage follows with hyperactivity, excitation, agitation, and confusion. Brain
stem dysfunction follows with cranial nerve involvement, excessive salivation, followed by coma and respiratory failure. Hydrophobia (the violent contraction of
respiratory, diaphragmatic, laryngeal, and pharyngeal muscles initiated by consumption of liquids) is a late sign of infection.
A bite is the most common means of transmission of rabies. Although, animal
vaccination programs have decreased the incidence of rabies, they have not completely eliminated it. Risk factors for transmission include unprovoked attacks,
unknown or unobserved animals, or animals displaying unusual behavior. Animals with increased lacrimation, salivation, dilated irregular pupils, unusual
behavior, or hydrophobia are particularly suspected. Bites to the face or hands
confer the highest risk of rabies transmission, but any breakage of the skin can
transmit the virus. Worldwide, in locations with incomplete animal vaccination, dogs are the most frequent vector for rabies transmission to humans. In the
United States, dogs are largely rabies free. No cases have been recorded in animals
having received two injections, but animals only receiving one vaccine have been
infected. Healthy dogs, cats, or ferrets that bite humans should be confined
and observed for at least 10 days for signs of illness; with any sign of illness,
the animal should be euthanized and its head shipped refrigerated to a laboratory
qualified to assess for rabies.

Rabies Prophylaxis
A thorough history and physical examination in the context of the geographical
location will give important clues for treatment. Identification of the animal and
observation will help guide treatment as described above. Preexposure prophylaxis
with active vaccination may be given to individuals at risk (animal trainers, animal
control field workers, etc). This does not obviate the need for postexposure prophylaxis. Postexposure prophylaxis is indicated for any person possibly exposed to a
rabid animal. Postexposure prophylaxis is a medical urgency, not an emergency, but
time is essential. Rabies immunoglobulin can give a rapid, passive immunity that
will last for 2 to 3 weeks. Passive immunization with human rabies immunoglobulin 20 IU/kg should be injected around the wound site as soon as possible. Active
immunization should then be given intramuscularly with a different syringe at a
different site. The active vaccines include human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV),
purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCEC), and rabies vaccine adsorbed (RVA),

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

153

and should be administered on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. Active immunization will lead
to antibody formation in about 1 week and should last for several years.

Snakebites
Venomous snakes are found throughout the United States except in Maine, Alaska,
and Hawaii. There are two main families of venomous species; the Crotalinae and
the Elapidae. The Crotalinae, also called pit vipers because of the presence of a
pitlike depression on their face, include rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water moccasins. The Elapidae includes the coral snakes.
Not every snakebite results in the release of venom into the victim; “dry bites”
occur up to 20% of the time. When venom is injected, it usually occurs in subcutaneous tissue and is absorbed via the lymphatic and venous system. Clinical
manifestations of envenomation will vary depending on the toxin, depth of envenomation, location of the bite, and size and underlying health of the victim. Pit viper
envenomation ranges from minor local swelling and discomfort at the injection site
to marked swelling, pain, blisters, bruising, and necrosis at the incision site; and
systemic symptoms such as fasiculations, hypotension, and severe coagulopathy. In
contrast, Elapid envenomation usually begins as minor pain at the incision with a
delayed serious systemic reaction that may lead to respiratory distress secondary to
neuromuscular weakness.
The primary objectives in snakebite management are to determine if envenomation occurred, to provide supportive therapy, to treat the local and systemic
effects of envenomation, and to limit tissue loss and disability. If the species can
be identified, the appropriate antivenin can be administered if required. Treatment
of envenomations is also varied. If it is a “dry bite,” general wound care is usually
sufficient. Radiographs should be performed to evaluate for retained teeth. Signs
of envenomation can be broadly classified into either hematologic or neurologic.
Hematologic effects of envenomation include disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, ecchymosis, and bleeding disorders. If there are signs of envenomation,
then laboratory studies including, but not limited to, clotting studies, liver enzymes,
and complete blood counts with platelets are necessary. Giving blood products to an
envenomated patient with a coagulopathy will not correct the problem. The circulating venom responsible for the coagulopathy is still present and will likely inactivate
the blood products. Therefore, the mainstay in treatment in venom-induced coagulopathy is antivenin, preferably type specific, not blood products. Nonetheless, if the
patient is bleeding, it is prudent to administer both antivenom and blood products.
The most commonly available antivenom for treatment of North American Crotalid
envenomations is Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab CroFab. Surgical debridement or fasciotomy in the setting of envenomation should not be done as this may
lead to further bleeding. Neurologic effects include weakness, paresthesia, paralysis,
confusion, and respiratory depression. Asymptomatic patients who were bit by a
pit viper should be observed for 8 to 12 hours after the bite. This should be extended
to 24 hours for coral snakebites because of the absence of early symptoms. The local
poison control center should be contacted early in all symptomatic snakebites and
will be able to help with management and location of antivenin. The national phone
number for the poison control center is 1-800-222-1222. While the American

154

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Heart Association has recommended the use of pressure dressings in the treatment of
snakebites, correct application of these is extremely difficult and incorrect application may result in harm. Their position is still being debated at this time.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
Match the single best therapy (A to E) to the clinical scenarios in Questions 13.1
to 13.4.
A. Identify the species, clean and immobilize the site, and administer
antivenin.
B. Clean bite site and treat with prophylactic antibiotics.
C. Clean site, observe animal, and watch for signs of secondary infection.
D. Clean the site and begin rabies prophylaxis with active and passive
immunization.
E. Admit for radical surgical debridement in the operating room.
13.1 Your dog, who was immunized against rabies within the last year, bites your
neighbor.
13.2 A woman arrives in your ED with a human bite to her breast that occurred
earlier in the day. There is a small puncture wound and no signs of cellulitis.
13.3 A scoutmaster brings a boy scout to the ED with a snakebite to his left foot. He
says he heard the snake’s rattle just before it bit him. His entire foot is purple,
swollen to his mid-calf, and very painful to the touch.
13.4 While raking leaves under his fruit tree at dusk, a man says a bird flew into his
face. When he checked his face in the mirror he saw a bite mark under blood
streaks.

ANSWERS
13.1 C. This is a low-risk bite. The dog is your housedog with a low risk of ever
contracting rabies. You have it immunized every year and can observe it for
10 days. As always, clean the bite thoroughly and consider radiographs to be
sure no broken teeth are in the wound or that the bone has been penetrated.
Administer tetanus if indicated and watch for secondary bacterial infection.
Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated.
13.2 B. Human bites have high rates of infectivity. This wound does not appear
to be infected. Nonetheless, the wound should be cleaned and 3- to 5-day
course of prophylactic antibiotics should be initiated. Human bites rarely lead
to retained teeth so a radiograph is not indicated. If this bite occurred on the
hand or across a joint space, a radiograph should be performed. Tetanus toxoid
should be given if indicated. TDaP has now been approved for use in patients
over 65 years old.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

155

13.3 A. This is a high-risk snakebite. The authorities should immediately be
notified to search for the snake. Although some percent of venomous snakebites fail to inject venom, this bite is clearly envenomed. The rapid swelling, pain, and discoloration demands immediate attention. First responders
should immobilize the site and place constriction bands that do not obstruct
arterial flow. The swelling is not a compartment syndrome unless elevated
pressures are measured. Avoid incisions and fasciotomies or packing in ice.
Immediate antivenin injection in and around the site should be a priority.
Remember that species-specific antivenin is important and that administration time is critical. Best results are obtained within 4 hours. Mark the
swelling every 15 minutes, evaluate coagulation profiles, electrocardiogram
(ECG ), renal function, and liver function, and consider ICU admission to
ensure adequate perfusion and to avoid disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). An index of antivenin can be obtained from the American
Zoo and Aquarium Association (301-562-0777) as well as your local poison
control center (800-222-1222).
13.4 D. This injury is at high risk for rabies transmission. Dusk is the usual
time for bat activity, and although this man did not feel a bite, he discovered bite marks under his injury site. Bats carry high rates of rabies and
this man was bitten on the face. Because the animal cannot be examined,
immediate passive and active immunization should be initiated and tetanus
administered, if indicated. As always, watch for secondary bacterial infection and update his tetanus status if it has been more than 5 years since his
last immunization.

CLINICAL PEARLS


In the United States, rabies transmission by dogs is nearly zero whereas
transmission by bats is more often seen. Worldwide, dog transmission
is still common.



Rabies prophylaxis is indicated for uncaught wild animals and animals
that start behaving abnormally.



Bites that are more than 6 hours old are, in general, left open, because
of the risk of infection.



Snakebites should be treated like other bites with special attention
paid to species identification and rapid administration of antivenin if
required.

CASE 14
A 59-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department (ED) with right-sided paralysis and aphasia. The patient’s wife states he was
in his normal state of health until one hour ago, when she heard a thud in the
bathroom and walked in to find him collapsed on the floor. She immediately called
emergency medical services, who transported the patient to your ED. En route, his
fingerstick blood sugar was 108 mg/dL. On arrival in the ED, the patient is placed
on monitors and an IV is established. His temperature is 36.8 ºC (98.2°F), blood
pressure is 169/93 mm Hg, heart rate is 86 beats per minute, and respiratory rate
is 20 breaths per minute. The patient has a noticeable left-gaze preference and is
verbally unresponsive, although he will follow simple commands such as raising
his left thumb. He has a normal neurologic examination on the left, but on the
right has a facial droop, no motor activity, decreased deep tendon reflexes (DTRs),
and no sensation to light-touch.

ANSWERS TO CASE 14:
Stroke
Summary: This is a 59-year-old man with acute onset of aphasia and right-sided
paralysis 70 minutes prior to arrival in the ED.
• Most likely diagnosis: Stroke
• Most appropriate next step: CT scan of the head
• Best therapy: Thrombolytics

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical findings of an acute stroke.
2. Understand the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to suspected stroke patients.
3. Be familiar with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scoring system.

Considerations
This 59-year-old man presents with an acute onset of focal neurologic deficits, which
are typical for a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Management priorities include:
ABCs, stabilization of vitals, and a careful history and physical to distinguishing
CVA from other etiologies which may present similarly, such as hypoglycemia. Nonenhanced CT is used to quickly determine whether the CVA is ischemic or hemorrhagic. If the event is ischemic, the patient may be a candidate for thrombolytic
administration. The goal is to complete an evaluation and, if the patient is eligible,
initiate treatment within 60 minutes of the patient’s arrival to the ED.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Stroke
DEFINITIONS
STROKE: The rapid development of the loss of brain function due to a disturbance
in the blood vessels supplying the brain. It is also referred to as a cerebrovascular
accident (CVA).
TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK (TIA): Occurs when the blood supply to
a particular area of the brain is interrupted. Often referred to as a “mini stroke,” the
symptoms of a TIA typically last minutes to hours, but resolve within 24 hours.
THROMBOLYTICS: Medications that act to degrade clots and are used in the
treatment of myocardial infarctions, pulmonary embolisms, and strokes.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH STROKE SCALE: A bedside assessment tool that provides a reproducible, quantitative measurement of the strokerelated neurologic deficit.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Stroke is a serious and common disorder, which affects over 795,000 persons in the
United States each year. It remains the third leading cause of death in the United
States and the number one cause for disability. Twenty percent of persons affected
will die within 1 year. Many of the surviving victims are left with neurologic deficits
and may be unable to care for themselves.
Stroke is a term that describes the loss of perfusion to a territory of the brain,
resulting in ischemia and a corresponding loss of neurologic function. Symptoms
vary widely depending on the type of infarct, the location, and the amount of brain
involved (Tables 14–1 and 14–2). Strokes are classified as either ischemic or hemorrhagic. Eighty percent of strokes are ischemic—due to the blockage of a blood vessel
secondary to thrombosis or embolism. They are generally seen in patients older than
the age of 50 and present with the sudden onset of focal neurologic deficits. Hemorrhagic strokes are typically seen in younger patients and are due to intraparenchymal
or subarachnoid cerebral vessel bleeding.
The history and physical examination remains the cornerstone to evaluating
stroke patients. The symptoms may include weakness, numbness, or discoordination
of the limbs or face, cranial nerve palsies, dysarthria, or cognitive impairments such
as aphasia or neglect. It is critical to find out the exact onset of stroke symptoms

Sudden onset of dizziness, vomiting, truncal instability, gaze palsies, stupor

as thrombolytics can only be given within a 4.5-hour window from the onset of
symptoms. If the patient is unable to communicate or awoke with symptoms, the
physician must determine when the patient was last awake and “normal.”
Strokes are more common in the elderly (75% occur in patients older than 75 years),
males, and African Americans. Other risk factors for stroke include a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or previous stroke, hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiac disease (eg, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, valvular disease), diabetes,
carotid stenosis, dyslipidemia, hypercoagulable states, tobacco and alcohol use.
It is possible, although challenging, to clinically infer the location of the anatomic insult to the clinical presentation by correlating symptoms with circulatory
region (Figure 14–1). For instance, aphasia usually corresponds to a left hemispheric
stroke; neglect generally indicates a right hemispheric stroke; crossed signs (eg,
right-sided facial droop with left-sided extremity weakness) typically indicate brainstem involvement.
The evaluation should include the use of the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)
(Table 14–3), a standardized system that measures the level of impairment caused

by stroke. It measures several aspects of brain function such as consciousness, vision,
sensation, movement, speech, and language. A score above 20 to the maximal score
of 42 represents a severe stroke. Current guidelines allow strokes with scores above
4 to be treated with tPA.
Many hospitals have a “Stroke Team” or a “Code Stroke” protocol that facilitates the prompt diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients as the treatment of
stroke is highly time sensitive. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke (NINDS) has established door-to-treatment time frames in responding to acute stroke. These include a physician evaluation within 10 minutes of
arrival, specialist/neurologist notification within 15 minutes, CT of head within
25 minutes and CT interpretation within 45 minutes. For ischemic strokes, the
guideline for the administration of rtPA (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen
activator) in eligible patients is within 60 minutes, within the “golden hour” of
stroke care (See Table 14-4).

Diagnostic Studies:
Most of the diagnostic studies in acute stroke patients are used to exclude other
etiologies for neurologic impairments and identify possible contraindications to
tPA administration. An oxygen saturation is needed to exclude hypoxia as etiology
of neurologic impairments. Because cardiac abnormalities are common among stroke
patients, an ECG should be obtained. The most common dysrhythmia is atrial fibrillation. Although further cardiovascular studies will ultimately be performed, they
should be done as an inpatient so that the acute care of the patient is not delayed.
Another critical bedside test that should be performed is a capillary blood glucose
(CBG). Hypoglycemia is a known mimicker of acute stroke and this condition
can be rapidly ruled out with a normal glucose level.
Blood tests usually include a complete blood count including platelets (platelets
should also be above 100,000 per mm3 to administer thrombolytics), coagulation
studies, and cardiac markers. Coagulation studies are important on patient with
anticoagulation who are supratheraputic and at higher risk for an intracerebral
bleed.
Patients with suspected strokes should undergo diagnostic imaging, commonly a
non-contrast head CT scan. Because of the difficulty in clinically differentiating a
hemorrhagic from an ischemic stroke—the CT is vital for ruling out an intracerebral

bleed, which is an absolute contraindication to thrombolytic therapy. An early CT
finding in ischemic stroke is loss of the grey-white differentiation due to increased
water concentration in ischemic tissues—leading to a loss of distinction among the
basal ganglia nuclei, gyri swelling, and sulcal effacement. Another early CT finding
is increased density within the occluded vessel, which represents the thrombus.
Other imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced CT and MRI may equal
CT’s efficiency in detecting intracerebral hemorrhage. MRI is superior to CT for
the demonstration of subactute and chronic hemorrhage, and gradient-echo MR can
also detect other vascular lesions such as malforations and amyloid angiopathy. However, the length of these studies may delay the time-sensitive administration of tPA.

Differential Diagnoses
The differential for stroke is broad and may include:
Neurologic entities such as seizure/Todd’s paralysis, complicated migraine headaches, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, flares of demyelinating disorders such as
multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord lesions.

164

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Toxic/metabolic abnormalities such as hypo- and hyperglycemia, hypo- or hypernatremia, drug overdose, and botulism.
Infectious etiologies such as systemic infection, Bell palsy, meningitis/encephalitis,
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and brain abscess.
Cardiac or vascular causes such as hypertensive encephalopathy, carotid/aortic/
vertebral artery dissection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral vasculitis.
Other etiologies such as tumor, sickle cell cerebral crisis, depression or psychosis,
and heat stroke.

Treatment
Stroke patients are managed as critically ill patients. Management imperatives
include: assessment and stabilization of the ABCs, formal evaluation for possible thrombolytic administration, and addressing comorbid conditions such as
hypertension.
Alteplase (intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator: rtPa)
may help restore tissue perfusion in ischemic stroke and is the only FDA approved
thrombolytic for stroke. The NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke (NINDS) study in 1995 found that Alteplase improved functional outcomes at 3 months compared to placebo if given within three hours of symptoms
onset. In May 2009, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines for the administration of rtPA following acute stroke
were revised to expand the window of treatment from 3 hours to 4.5 hours to
provide more patients with an opportunity to receive benefit from this effective
therapy.
Recent studies have suggested that there may be a longer therapeutic window
for the administration of thrombolytics. However, earlier administration is always
better as “time is brain”—nervous tissue is lost as the stroke progresses. rtPa is
usually administered 0.9 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 90 mg, with 10% of the
dose administered as an IV bolus and the remainder infused over 60 minutes. Furthermore, neither heparin nor aspirin is used during the initial 24 hours. However,
thrombolytics should not be withheld from a patient who has recently taken
aspirin. Additionally, endovascular therapies such as intra-arterial and mechanical thrombolysis are being used for a subset of patients with acute ischemic stroke.
See Table 14–4.
Elevated blood pressures are generally left untreated to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure. However, systolic blood pressure >220 mm Hg and diastolic blood
pressures >120 mm Hg are best treated with easily titratable agents such as IV labetalol and nitrates. The blood pressure should not be lowered more than 25 percent
of the presenting mean arterial blood pressure. The treated blood pressure should be
below 185/110 mm Hg for rTPA administration.
Treatment of hemorrhagic stroke is different and includes blood pressure control
with antihypertensives such as nimodipine, possibly reversing any anticoagulation with cryoprecipitate or platelets, and consultation with a hematologist and
neurosurgeon.

D. Lower the blood pressure to below 160/80 mm Hg if she is eligible for tPA.

166

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS
14.1 A. Ischemia is the most common etiology of stroke (due to thrombosis, embolism, or hypoperfusion) and is responsible for up to 80% of strokes.
14.2 B. Indications for tPA administration include an ischemic stroke with a clearly
defined time of onset, measurable neuralgic deficit, and a baseline CT with no
evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Contraindications for tPA therapy vary
and include: seizure at the time of stroke, history of intracranial hemorrhage,
persistent blood pressure >185/110 mm Hg despite antihypertensive therapy,
recent surgery or GI bleed, recent MI, pregnancy, or elevated aPTT or INR due
to heparin or warfarin use, platelet count <100,000, etc.
14.3 C. Bedside blood glucose and CT scan of the head are the most urgent diagnostic
studies in evaluating possible stroke patients. Coagulation studies, a complete
blood count or platelet count should not delay tPA administration unless the
patient is taking anticoagulation or has suspected thrombocytopenia. Noncontrast head CT is generally the initial imaging study, not MRI, to exclude
hemorrhage or tumor as a cause of neurologic deficits. Though MRI provides
more information, its cost, limited availability, restricted patient access, and
other contraindications such as patient claustrophobia or metal implants limit
its use.
14.4 C. Emergency administration of antihypertensive agents should be withheld in
acute stroke to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure, unless the blood pressure
is greater than 220/120 mm Hg. Patients are eligible for tPA with BP < 185/110
mm Hg. If patients have concurrent conditions that require acute lowering of
blood pressure such as aortic dissection, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute
renal failure, or congestive heart failure, a reasonable goal is to lower their
mean arterial pressure 15% to 25% within the first 24 hours.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Strokes may present in a variety of ways, and the differential diagnosis
of stroke is broad. Clinicians must take a careful history, including the
time of onset of symptoms. The NIHSS measures the impairment due
to stroke.



A bedside glucose measurement and a CT scan of the head are the most
urgent diagnostic studies in suspected stroke.

Treatment is aimed at stabilizing the ABCs, evaluating for possible
thrombolytic administration, and addressing comorbid conditions such
as hypertension.

CASE 15
A 64-year-old man is brought into the emergency department (ED) by his family
after fainting at home. He was standing, dusting a bookshelf, when he fell backward onto the couch. He was noted to be pale and clammy during the incident,
and recovered spontaneously in approximately 30 seconds. He does remember
the moments just prior to and after the incident. He felt lightheaded and had
palpitations just prior to falling, but does not describe any shortness of breath,
chest pain, headache, nausea, diplopia, or loss of bowel or bladder control. His
history includes a myocardial infarction 2 years prior. The patient has been taking
his regular medicines as directed, which include aspirin, a β-blocker, and a cholesterol-lowering agent. His primary medical doctor has not recently started any
new medicines or changed his doses. On presentation to the ED, the patient’s
vitals are blood pressure 143/93 mm Hg, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), and oxygen
saturation of 97% on room air. His examination is significant for a cardiac gallop. No carotid bruits, neurological abnormalities, rectal bleeding, or orthostatic
changes are noted. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates a normal
sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute with no significant changes from a prior study
6 months earlier; the ECG reveals Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF. The patient
now states he feels fine and would like to go home.

ANSWERS TO CASE 15:
Syncope
Summary: This is a 64-year-old man with a medical history that includes a myocardial
infarction who presents with an episode of syncope. The patient has an ECG with
inferior Q waves, but no acute changes at the time of presentation.
• Most likely diagnosis: Syncope, most likely caused by a cardiac dysrhythmia
with spontaneous resolution
• Next step: Management of ABCs, intravenous access, and initiation of continuous cardiac monitoring

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize worrisome historical and physical features of syncope.
2. Understand the emergency physician’s (EP’s) role in evaluation of patients with
syncope, and the role of selective diagnostic testing.
3. Learn to recognize which patients need to be admitted to the hospital.

Considerations
Syncope has many etiologies that are often difficult to identify with certainty in the
ED. The goal of the EP is to identify and treat any life threats. If there is no critical
immediate treatment needed, the goal is then to risk stratify patients for the likelihood of an adverse outcome. The patient in this case is at high risk for a cardiac
etiology of his syncope. This patient should be immediately placed on a cardiac
monitor and receive an intravenous line. The physician should treat any abnormal
findings. If the patient appears dehydrated, he should receive intravenous fluids. If a
dysrhythmia exists (eg, ventricular tachycardia), it should be immediately addressed
with either cardioversion or defibrillation. If the patient appears stable, the workup
should proceed with the patient maintained on the cardiac monitor. The decision
to admit or discharge the patient depends on many factors. However, if there is suspicion that there is a cardiac etiology for syncope, this patient should be admitted to
a monitored hospital bed.

APPROACH TO:
Syncope
DEFINITIONS
SYNCOPE: A transient loss of consciousness with a corresponding loss of postural
tone, with a spontaneous and full recovery.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

171

PRESYNCOPE: A sensation that one is about to lose consciousness, usually with
nonspecific symptoms consistent with a prodrome of syncope such as lightheadedness, weakness, dizziness, blurred vision, or nausea.
VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE: A form of neurocardiogenic syncope, which occurs in
the setting of increased peripheral sympathetic activity and venous pooling.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Syncope is an extremely common presenting symptom to the ED, accounting for
approximately 5% of all ED visits in this country. Between 1% and 6% of hospitalized patients are admitted for an evaluation of syncope. The list of potential etiologies of syncope is extensive; causes include cardiac, reflex-mediated, orthostatic
(eg, postural hypotension caused by volume depletion, sepsis-related peripheral
vasodilation, or medications), psychiatric, hormonal, neurologic, and idiopathic.
Unnecessary or inappropriate ancillary testing can consume thousands of dollars per
patient and increase ED length of stay. With a carefully taken history and physical
examination, clinicians can better risk stratify patients and determine who needs to
be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and who can be safely discharged
for outpatient workup.

Etiologies
Cardiac syncope refers to the loss of postural tone secondary to a sudden and dramatic fall in cardiac output. Bradydysrhythmias, tachydysrhythmias, heart block,
and mechanisms that disrupt outflow or preload are the functional physiologic
abnormalities that cause these sudden changes in blood flow and ultimately inadequate perfusion of the brain. Patients with various forms of organic heart disease
(eg, aortic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and those with coronary
artery disease, congestive heart failure, ventricular hypertrophy, and myocarditis are
at highest risk. Causes of bradydysrhythmias include sinus node disease, second/
third-degree heart block, and pacemaker malfunction. Tachydysrhythmias include
ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes, and supraventricular tachycardia of both nodal and atrial origin, some of which may be associated
with conditions such as Wolfe-Parkinson-White syndrome, Brugada syndrome, or
long QT syndrome. When syncope is precipitated by a tachydysrhythmia, patients
may complain of palpitations. Mechanical etiologies such as pericardial tamponade
and aortic dissection should be considered in causes of cardiac syncope as both entities will result in a significant fall in functional cardiac output. Massive pulmonary
embolism must also be considered, as it can lead to syncope caused by right ventricular outflow obstruction which, in turn, leads to a fall in left-sided filling pressure.
Right-sided ventricular strain and dilatation can also lead to dysrhythmia.
Reflex-mediated syncope, also known as situational syncope, includes vasovagal,
cough, micturition, defecation, emesis, swallow, Valsalva, and emotionally (eg, fear,
surprise, disgust) related syncope. Loss of consciousness and motor tone is caused
by stimulation of the vagal reflex, resulting in transient bradycardia and hypotension. Warmth, nausea, lightheadedness, and the impending sense that often precedes
loss of consciousness are common complaints of those affected by vagal syncope.

172

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Carotid sinus disease or stimulation of overly sensitive baroreceptors in the neck (a
tight collar) are other causes of sudden reflex-related syncope. These patients will
often note a specific activity that is temporally related to their syncopal episodes
(turning the head in a certain direction). A recent examination of the Framingham
cohort found that patients who were clearly identified to have syncope of vasovagal etiology were not at any increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity or mortality.
Unfortunately, making a firm diagnosis of vasovagal syncope in the setting of the ED
is difficult, and it should be a diagnosis of exclusion.
Orthostasis (ie, a drop in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more resulting from a rapid change in body position from a supine to more upright posture)
is another common cause of syncope. Diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and graying of
vision may suggest orthostatic syncope, and recurrence of these symptoms on standing is more significant than the actual numeric change in blood pressure. However,
orthostasis may be present in up to 40% of patients older than the age of 70 who are
asymptomatic. Orthostatic hypotension can be related to volume depletion, sepsisrelated peripheral vascular dilation, medications, and autonomic instability, which
can develop in a number of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, Parkinson disease,
multiple sclerosis, and other neuromuscular disorders. Volume depletion secondary
to sudden blood loss needs to be considered in all patients with syncope. Patients of
all ages can develop a sudden gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and the initial blood flow
can be occult because it is confined to the lower GI tract. Elderly patients can lose
massive amounts of blood from a leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,
with abdominal or flank pain as common associated complaints, but syncope alone
can also be the presenting complaint. In the female patient of childbearing age,
normal intrauterine or ruptured ectopic pregnancy may present with syncope. The
former may cause orthostasis as a result of the normal cardiovascular changes associated with pregnancy, and the latter as the only manifestation of life-threatening
hemorrhage.
Hypotension leading to syncope is not necessarily related to volume loss. Patients,
particularly the elderly, may present with syncope as the first overt manifestation
of sepsis. Hypotension in these patients is caused by relative lack of intravascular
volume secondary to decreased vascular tone as part of the inflammatory response.
Patients with a history of hypertension may have what appears to be a “normal”
blood pressure when they are actually in a state of relative hypotension.
Medication, especially polypharmacy, a common problem in the elderly, is
another important cause of syncope. Antihypertensives, antidepressants, antianginals, analgesics, central nervous system depressants, medications that can prolong
the QT interval (eg, erythromycin, clarithromycin, haloperidol, amiodarone, droperidol, and others), insulin, oral hypoglycemics, and recreational polypharmacy
are common culprits. Geriatric patients with complicated medical histories are particularly at risk, although a detailed ingestion history should be obtained from all
patients presenting with syncope. One should look closely for recent additions or
changes to a medication regimen, including over-the-counter medications.
Neurologic causes of syncope are rare, unless seizure is included in the
differential diagnosis; seizure and syncope should be differentiated and thought
of as discrete diagnoses. Seizure can usually be quickly identified by the history of

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

173

witnessed seizure activity, especially if accompanied by a history of seizures in the
past. It is also suggested by physical examination findings (eg, tongue biting, loss
of bowel/bladder control) and especially the observation of a postictal state, which
commonly resolves over a period from several minutes to many hours. Brief tonicclonic activity, resulting not from a seizure focus, but from the transient hypoxia of
the brain stem, which leads to loss of consciousness, may be associated with syncope.
However, the duration of confusion or lethargy following the episode is short lived.
The sudden onset of a severe headache associated with loss of consciousness suggests
a subarachnoid hemorrhage as the cause of syncope. Other neurological causes of
syncope include migraines, subclavian steal, and transient ischemic attack or stroke
of the vertebrobasilar distribution.
Sometimes patients with psychiatric disease will present with the complaint of
sudden loss of consciousness. The history of these patients may include several prior
episodes of syncope. Typically, these incidents will present with minimal physical
trauma and none of the signs or symptoms that are commonly associated with
cardiac syncope. Anxiety, with or without hyperventilation, conversion disorder,
somatization, panic attacks, and breath-holding spells are all manifestations of psychiatric illness that can cause syncope. However, psychiatric and emotional etiologies of syncope are considered a diagnosis of exclusion. This diagnosis should be
considered only after appropriate laboratory or ancillary testing has ruled out more
serious etiologies. Furthermore, it must be recognized that many of the most commonly prescribed neuroleptics cause QT prolongation, which in turn, can lead to
ventricular dysrhythmia.

Diagnosis
Much to the frustration of patients and providers, the underlying cause of the syncopal presentation is not elucidated in approximately half of patients who present
to the ED with syncope. Unfortunately, patients in this category represent a mixed
population in which it is estimated that anywhere between 45% and 80% may have
had a cardiac cause. Most of the young and otherwise healthy patients will be discharged home without a clearly defined cause for their loss of consciousness. Many
of the elderly patients will be admitted for additional testing and observation. Of
all the diagnostic tools available to physicians in the evaluation of syncope, a good
thorough history, a physical examination, and ECG are the only level A recommendations from the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). The information gathered from the history and physical examination alone will identify the
potential cause of syncope in 45% of cases.
The goal of the initial evaluation is to find out exactly what happened to the
patient. It is critical to ascertain a step-by-step history of the event. This includes
getting a detailed account from any bystanders or family members, which can be
valuable in making the correct diagnosis. The history and complete physical examination, combined with the electrocardiogram, form the preliminary workup of
patients with syncope. Orthostatic blood pressure measurements should be obtained
if orthostasis is likely.
This approach is often suggestive of a diagnosis in cases of vasovagal, situational,
orthostatic, polypharmacy, and some cardiac-related syncope. Although vasovagal

174

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

and situational syncope may be strongly suspected based upon the history, a true
diagnosis of vasovagal syncope requires additional testing not available in the ED.
While vasovagal/situational syncope does occur in elderly patients, it is a diagnosis
that cannot be safely relied upon in the ED unless the history is completely indicative (ie, syncope at the sight of blood) and there are no physical or diagnostic test
findings that raise concern for more ominous causes. Elderly patients are also at risk
for serious injuries such as hip fractures from even relatively benign causes of syncope. Although older patients admitted with a story consistent with vasovagal syncope may ultimately leave the hospital with that diagnosis, the risk profile of elderly
patients as a whole almost always makes this a diagnosis that cannot be determined
within the confines of the ED. However, young, healthy patients with histories
consistent with vasovagal syncope may be approached with less diagnostic testing.
Younger patients should be questioned regarding a family history of early cardiac or
sudden death; although rare, certain genetic conditions such as Brugada syndrome,
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and long QT syndrome may present with syncope.

Laboratory Tests
Although laboratory testing rarely elucidates the cause of the syncope, it can be
helpful in a limited number of situations. Inexpensive laboratory tests include
complete blood count (CBC) for blood loss, glucometer for hypoglycemia, and
electrolytes and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine levels for dehydration. Toxicology
screening for drug-related syncope is rarely helpful for the immediate evaluation and
stabilization of the patient. Furthermore, assumption of a toxicologic cause should
not deter the physician from performing a complete evaluation. A urinalysis is an
inexpensive and useful screening test that can provide information about glucose,
infection, the patient’s state of hydration, and the presence or absence of ketones.
A urine pregnancy test should always be obtained in women of childbearing age,
because early pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy can present as syncope.

Management
Patients with history or examination findings suggestive of a particular pathology
should undergo continuous cardiac monitoring, echocardiography, Doppler
vascular studies, or contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging. Those
patients with unexplained syncope and high-risk clinical features (eg, advanced
age, abnormal electrocardiogram, previous cardiac history, exertional syncope)
require admission for further investigation such as tread-mill testing, tilt-table
testing, CT imaging of the head, cardiac enzymes, cardiac catheterization, and
electrophysiologic studies.
While diagnosis and treatment are the goals in the evaluation of syncope, the
decision tree for EM physicians is more focused than that of the specialist or outpatient physician (Figure 15–1). Unstable patients presenting after a syncopal episode,
including those with persistent hypotension, life-threatening dysrhythmias, active
blood loss, acute coronary syndromes, hemodynamically significant pulmonary
emboli, and cardiac tamponade must be managed emergently. The “ABC” (airway,
breathing, circulation) approach to the unstable patient applies in this scenario as
in all presentations with unstable vital signs. History and physical examination in

the context of syncope should guide diagnostic thinking, but should not substitute
for emergent management considerations.

Disposition
For the patient who presents after syncope but is hemodynamically normal at the
time of presentation, the decision to admit versus discharge from the ED with outpatient follow-up is dependent on other clinical features suggesting that the patient
is at high risk for a short-term adverse outcome.
Several studies have tried to aid the EM physician in identifying high-risk
patients by using clinical decision rules (Table 15–1). The San Francisco Syncope
Rule, the OESIL (Osservatorio Epidemiologico sulla Sincope nel Lazio), and the
ROSE (Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department) are decision
rules that attempt to provide clinicians with patient characteristics associated with
an increased likelihood for an adverse outcome The San Francisco Syncope rule uses
five criteria: history of CHF, abnormal ECG, hematocrit <30, shortness of breath,
and/or systolic BP of <90 mm Hg at triage, to predict who requires hospitalization.
The OESIL score is based upon abnormal ECG, history of cardiac disease, age >65,
and syncope without prodrome. The ROSE predictors are: BNP >300, positive fecal

occult blood, hemoglobin <9.0, oxygen saturation <94%, and Q waves present on
ECG. The Rose rule is the first to incorporate a biochemical marker, BNP, into the
criteria and claims a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 87.2% and 98.5%,
respectively. An abnormal ECG is the only common thread in all three rule sets
(Figure 15–2), although “abnormal” may be defined in a variety of ways. If the biochemical marker BNP in the ROSE criteria is considered a surrogate for a history of
CHF, this reinforces that known cardiac disease is a factor associated with high-risk
patients. Regardless of which rule set one considers, it should be recognized that
decision tools and algorithms should never be used as a substitute for a full evaluation and individualized clinical judgment of all aspects of the patient’s presentation.
Many of these decision rules are still undergoing evaluation in an effort to gain validation. In fact, a recent analysis comparing the efficacy of risk stratification using the
San Francisco and OESIL rule sets versus clinical judgment on short-term prognosis
found that both rule sets had relatively low sensitivities. Having to use both rule sets
would be needed to identify all patients who subsequently died, and the best results
were obtained if a clinician used a combination of clinical knowledge with a rule set.
The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy guidelines emphasizes risk stratification of patients presenting with syncope in a similar
fashion to those presenting with chest pain. It is generally accepted that historical
or physical examination findings consistent with heart failure, structural or coronary heart disease, as well as an abnormal ECG are linked with high risk of poor
outcome. Advancing age is coupled with a continuum of growing cardiovascular
risk and should also be a consideration. It also bears mentioning that in the highrisk groups, however they are defined, presyncopal events should be evaluated and
managed as syncope, because the etiologies are the same and are distinguished only
by the degree of hypoperfusion of the brain. The younger patient with no comorbidities, reassuring first-time symptoms, and a normal electrocardiogram can usually
be discharged from the ED. Referral to a primary medical doctor should be made
for coordination of any outpatient studies that may be warranted in the evaluation of recurring syncope. Patients with specific job-related concerns, such as heavy
machine operators, pilots, or physicians, may require more expeditious referral and
notification of the appropriate State authorities. Even benign causes of syncope,
such as vasovagal syncope, can be fatal when the patient is driving.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
15.1 A 37-year-old man is brought into the ED because he passed out at work. He
denies any prodromal symptoms. Family history is negative for sudden cardiac
death. In the ED, his BP lying down is 125/75 mm Hg, heart rate is 75 beats
per minute, and respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute. The patient’s blood
pressure and heart rate standing are 120/75 mm Hg and 77 beats per minute,
respectively. His ECG shows a sinus rhythm with a rate of 72. Physical examination does not reveal any abnormal findings. Currently, he is lucid and has no
neurologic abnormalities. After a complete evaluation of this patient, which of
the following is the most common etiology of syncope?
A. Dysrhythmia
B. Orthostasis
C. Idiopathic
D. Situational

178

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

15.2 A 35-year-old woman presents to the ED complaining of feeling lightheadedness. She noticed some vaginal bleeding earlier in the day. Her blood
pressure is 85/53 mm Hg, heart rate is 130 beats per minute, and respiratory
rate is 18 breaths per minute. Which of the following is the most appropriate
next step in management?
A. Obtain a urine pregnancy test.
B. Obtain a serum quantitative beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG).
C. Obtain immediate IV access and begin fluid resuscitation.
D. Obtain stat OB/GYN consult.
15.3 A 21-year-old man is brought to the ED after collapsing to the ground while
playing basketball. He is alert and oriented, denies chest pain, difficulty
breathing, or any other physical complaints. There was no trauma. He denies
any past medical problems. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of
the following elements on his ECG is concerning for a life-threatening cause
of syncope?
A. Heart rate of 55
B. P-wave inversion in lead aVR
C. Sinus arrhythmia
D. QTc of 495 msec
15.4 A 72-year-old man is brought to the ED by paramedics after passing out at the
supermarket. His syncopal episode was witnessed by shoppers who stated the
patient collapsed, hitting his head. The patient is currently alert and oriented,
and denies any persistent symptoms. His past medical history is significant
for carotid stenosis, for which he takes aspirin and clopidogrel. What is most
appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
A. Head CT scan
B. Order a carotid duplex ultrasound
C. Obtain an ECG
D. Chest radiograph

ANSWERS
15.1 C. Idiopathic. Approximately 50% of all patients with a presenting complaint
of syncope will not have a definitive cause. Cardiac causes of syncope (eg,
dysrhythmia) are the most worrisome, because patients are at increased risk
for sudden cardiac death. Situational syncope is a rare cause of syncope. It
is a result of an abnormal autonomic reflex response to a physical stimulus.
Some triggers of this response include coughing, swallowing, defecation, and
micturition. The patient does not have evidence for orthostatic hypotension
as demonstrated by his vital signs.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

179

15.2 C. Obtain IV access and begin fluid resuscitation. Investigating the possibility of pregnancy, specifically ectopic pregnancy, is critical. However, initial
stabilization of the patient takes precedence. Hypotension must be treated
emergently with fluids. Obtaining a consult early in the patient’s course is
important. Definitive management will be in the operating room.
15.3 D. The upper level of normal for the corrected QT interval is approximately
440 msec for men and 460 msec for women. A finding of a prolonged QT
interval should prompt a more thorough investigation into this patient’s medications, family history, and potential electrolyte imbalances. Prolonged QT
syndrome is associated with sudden death, especially in young athletes. Mild
bradycardia alone in a young, healthy patient who has fully recovered from
an episode of syncope is of little concern. P-wave inversion in lead aVR is a
normal finding. Sinus arrhythmia is a normal variation in the RR interval with
respiration.
15.4 C. Obtain an ECG. This patient has a high probability for a cardiac cause
of his syncope. Initial management includes placing the patient on a cardiac
monitor and obtaining an ECG to monitor for dysrhythmias. A head CT scan
should be performed after an ECG is obtained. A carotid duplex ultrasound
and chest radiograph may aid in the workup for syncope, but it is most important to first rule out a dysrhythmia.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The primary goal of the EP in the evaluation of patients with syncope is to
be able to identify those who are at high risk for morbidity and mortality.



The causes of syncope are varied, and a successful diagnosis hinges on
diligent history collection and appropriate use of diagnostic tools.



Even the most experienced clinician will be unable to determine the cause
of syncope in up to 50% of patients.



Reassuring clinical signs in syncope are youth, a normal ECG, absence of
comorbidities, and reassuring historical features.



Unstable patients should be treated emergently and stabilized, first
addressing the ABCs.

CASE 16
A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining of
shortness of breath and chest pain that he describes as right sided and increased
with deep breathing. He states it started suddenly when he woke up and was
worse with activity. He denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or cough. He has a
recent history of multiple gunshot wounds resulting in ongoing pain in his upper
back and T-10 paraplegia. One week ago, he was discharged from the hospital to
a rehabilitation facility. He is currently taking acetaminophen/hydrocodone and
ibuprofen for his pain, which has increased with his physical therapy and occupational therapy. He is also taking hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril for hypertension and fluoxetine for depression. He recently quit smoking tobacco since he was
hospitalized and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. On physical examination,
he is an otherwise fit young man who appears slightly short of breath and uncomfortable. His heart rate is 101 beats per minute, his blood pressure is 110/78 mm
Hg, and his respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute. His pulse oximetry is 96% on
2 L of O2 by nasal canula. His lungs are clear to auscultation. There is mild swelling of his left calf. He has no sensation in his lower extremities. Laboratory studies
reveal a white blood cell count (WBC) of 10,000/mm3. Hemoglobin, hematocrit,
electrolytes, and renal function are all within normal limits. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals a sinus rhythm at a rate of 103 beats per minute. His chest
radiograph reveals minimal bibasilar atelectasis but no evidence of infiltrates or
effusions.

ANSWERS TO CASE 16:
Pulmonary Embolism
Summary: A 34-year-old man with hypertension, depression, and recent gunshot
wounds resulting in T-10 paraplegia presents with dyspnea, pleuritic and right-sided
chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, left calf swelling, and bibasilar atelectasis on
chest radiography.
• Most likely diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep venous
thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity.
• Screening and confirmatory studies: For evaluation of PE, D-dimer level,
venous duplex ultrasonography, ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan), pulmonary CT angiography, and catheter pulmonary angiography are available and
may be applied on a selective basis.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the clinical presentations of PE.
2. Learn to formulate reasonable diagnostic strategy for the diagnosis of pulmonary
embolism in the emergency department setting.
3. Learn the sensitivity, specificity, and limitations of the D-dimer test and the
contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography angiogram for the diagnosis of
DVT and PE.

Considerations
This 34-year-old patient who has been immobilized has a primary risk factor for
venous thromboembolism. The presentation of acute dyspnea, chest pain, borderline tachycardia, and unilateral lower extremity swelling in the absence of identifiable alternative cardiopulmonary disease place him in the high-risk category for a
pulmonary embolism. An ECG in patients with suspected PE is generally helpful for
identifying other etiologies of his symptoms such as ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, and dysrhythmias. In some instances, the ECG may reveal right-heart strain
patterns that are more specific for the diagnosis of PE. Although nonspecific, sinus
tachycardia is still the most frequent presenting ECG finding among patients with
PE. Even 25% of patients with identified PE may have a normal ECG. The relatively normal chest radiograph is valuable in eliminating alternative diagnoses, such
as pneumonia, pneumothorax, and congestive heart failure. An arterial blood gas
can be used to assess patients with shortness of breath, but it is non-specific in the
diagnosis of PE. Taking into consideration the clinical, radiographic, and ECG data,
a presumptive diagnosis of PE can be made. The next steps in management include
maintenance of cardiopulmonary stability, consideration of empiric anticoagulation
therapy, and confirmation of the diagnosis.

APPROACH TO:
DVT and PE
DEFINITIONS
DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS: Formation of clot (thrombus) in a deep vein
(a vein that accompanies an artery). Eighty to ninety percent of diagnosed PEs arise
from a DVT of the lower extremity. However, thrombi of deep veins in the calf
(tibial veins) are difficult to detect, but also much less likely to embolize than more
proximal thrombi.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Blockages of the pulmonary arteries, most often
caused by blood clots originating from deep veins in the legs or pelvis. In rare circumstances, air bubbles, fat droplets, amniotic fluid, clumps of parasites, or tumor
cells may also cause a PE. Risk factors for thrombosis are related to Virchow triad of
hypercoagulability, venous stasis, and venous injury.
D-DIMER ASSAY: Fibrin D-dimer is released into the circulation following degradation of cross-linked fibrin by plasmin. Multiple commercial assays are available
that use a monoclonal antibody to detect the D-dimer fragment. The two most commonly used assays are the whole blood immunoagglutination test (less accurate) and
the quantitative plasma ELISA assay (more accurate). Elevated levels may indicate
the presence of concurrent thrombus formation and degradation. Other conditions
in which D-dimer elevation occurs include sepsis, recent myocardial infarction or
stroke (<10 days), recent surgery or trauma, disseminated intravascular coagulation,
collagen vascular disease, metastatic cancer, pregnancy, hospitalized patients and
liver disease. The D-dimer may be falsely negative if clot formation is greater than
72 hours before the blood is assayed. Conversely, it may be falsely positive since
levels may remain elevated for as long as 2 years. In pregnancy, the upper limits of
normal are increased with each trimester, but a true normal D-dimer should never be
greater than 1000 μg/L.
VENOUS DUPLEX ULTRASONOGRAPHY: Ultrasound imaging modality
combining direct visualization of veins with Doppler flow signal to assess luminal
patency and compressibility of the deep venous system in the extremities and the
presence of thrombosis. This imaging modality is most accurate for assessment of the
iliac, femoral, and popliteal veins.
PERFUSION AND VENTILATION (V/Q) SCAN: Radioisotope used to
identify ventilation-perfusion mismatches. Results are categorized into probabilityranked groups after taking into account of coexisting pulmonary pathology and
the patient’s overall clinical picture. Radiologists interpret V/Q scans as normal,
low, intermediate or high probability for V/Q mismatch or PE in the right clinical setting. Unfortunately, many patients with known PE have nondiagnostic V/Q
scans, and these low to intermediate probability scans have significant disagreement
among interpreters. Current literature indicates its benefits primarily in renal failure
when contrast may precipitate renal failure. V/Q scans may also be the test of choice
for pregnant patients. It is reported that multidetector CT (MDCT) scanning has

184

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

higher radiation exposure for the mother but lower fetal radiation exposure, whereas
V/Q scan has lower maternal and higher fetal radiation exposure. Remy-Jardin recommends perfusion scintigraphy (Q) without ventilations scintigraphy (V), which
significantly decreases fetal radiation exposure.
COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY PULMONARY ANGIOGRAPHY (CTPA):
Magnified CT imaging of the pulmonary vasculature obtained during the arterial
phases of venous contrast injection. While highly specific for PE, the reported sensitivity is variable and ranges from 50% to 90%. The diagnostic sensitivity is higher
for centrally located PE but reduced for subsegmental clots. The Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II) study suggests that CTPA
identifies more PE than V/Q scanning, but these may be false-positives or clots that
do not require anticoagulation. The diagnostic accuracy is also related to observer
expertise. The initiation of multidetector CT scanning has greatly improved imaging of central, segmental, and subsegmental arteries. An advantage of this modality
is its ability to detect alternative diagnoses. Pulmonary MDCT angiography has a
reported sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% in PIOPED II.
PULMONARY ANGIOGRAPHY: Imaging involving intravascular contrast
injection and fluoroscopy to determine patency of the pulmonary arterial vasculature. Although once considered the gold standard for diagnosing PE, this test has
largely been replaced by pulmonary CT angiography (CTA). Baile et al showed that
these two tests had no difference in the detection of subsegmental sized PE. They
concluded that pulmonary CTA and pulmonary angiography are comparable for
detecting PE. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and is associated with increased
morbidity and mortality when compared to CTA.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Deep Venous Thrombosis
Up to 60% of patients with untreated proximal DVT will develop PE; consequently, accurate diagnosis of this condition is critical for emergency physicians.
Unfortunately, the clinical features of DVT are frequently nonspecific, and may
include pain, tenderness, swelling, edema, and erythema. The physical examination
and thromboembolic risk factors (Table 16–1) are important in assessing the clinical
suspicion (ie, pretest probability), and based on the pretest probability, clinical algorithm for the diagnosis of lower extremity DVT may be formulated (Figure 16–1).
Duplex ultrasound is the most common test used to evaluate for the presence of
DVT. Its accuracy approaches 98% for proximal DVT detection, when an experienced
operator performs the test. ELISA D-dimer can serve as a screening tool for DVT. In
practice, a positive ELISA D-dimer is not of any clinical value. However, due to its high
sensitivity, a negative ELISA D-dimer suggests the absence of an acute thrombus. In
patients with low pretest probability and a negative ELISA D-dimer, the diagnosis of
DVT can be ruled out. Venography is the traditional gold standard for DVT. However,
due to its invasiveness, risk of reaction to contrast dye, and the advent of newer technologies that are just as accurate, venography is rarely used in clinical practice.
All patients diagnosed with a DVT at or above the popliteal level should be
treated with anticoagulation. Treatment goals are directed toward the prevention

of thrombus propagation and embolization. In patients with extensive DVT that
involves the iliac and femoral veins, the use of thrombolytic therapy should be
considered to help minimize the postphlebitic sequelae. For most patients, acute
management consists of anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). When UFH therapy is selected, it is vital
to achieve therapeutic levels rapidly. When this is accomplished within 24 hours,
the DVT recurrence rate is 4% to 6%, compared to 23% when therapeutic levels
are delayed. LMWH can be administered for the treatment of DVT with or without
PE. Enoxaparin is a commonly used LMWH (Table 16–2). Patients developing
recurrent DVT during optimal anticoagulation therapy should undergo evaluation
for hypercoagulability conditions and be considered for inferior vena cava (IVC)
filter placement (eg, Greenfield filter). IVC filters are also useful for individuals
with contraindications to anticoagulation. However, these filters present their
own risks for developing thrombosis and PE and have limited effect over time.

Pulmonary Embolism
Few common medical conditions are as difficult to diagnose as PE. The majority of
patients have dyspnea and chest pain at presentation, whereas cardiovascular collapse is observed in 10% of the patients. Symptoms of PE include sudden onset cough
(3%-55%), blood-streaked sputum (3%-40%), sudden onset of dyspnea at rest or
with exertion (75%), splinting of ribs with breathing, chest pain (50%-85%), and
diaphoresis (25%-40%). Nonspecific signs of PE include tachypnea (50%-60%),
tachycardia (25%-70%), rales/crackles (50%), and low-grade fever (7%-50%), the
latter of which is suggestive of pulmonary infarction. Tachypnea is the most commonly reported sign in patients diagnosed with PE. Chest pain associated with PE
is commonly pleurtitic in nature. The “classic triad” for PE (hemoptysis, dyspnea,

and chest pain) occurs in fewer than 20% of patients in whom PE is diagnosed. PE is
occasionally diagnosed in young, active patients presenting to the ED complaining
only of pleuritic chest pain. Such patients are often dismissed inappropriately with
inadequate workups and nonspecific diagnoses such as musculoskeletal chest pain or
pleurisy. Spontaneous onset of chest wall tenderness without a history of trauma is
worrisome, because this may be the only physical finding of PE. In a recent study by
Courtney et al, non–cancer-related throbophilia, pleuritic chest pain and family history of VTE increased the probablility of PE or DVT. Unusual clinical presentations
of PE also include seizure, syncope, abdominal pain, high fever, productive cough,
adult-onset asthma, new-onset supraventricular arrhythmias, or hiccups.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of PE remains a difficult task despite the multitude of resources. Routine tests obtained in the ED, such as radiographs, ABGs, and ECG provide limited
and nonspecific information. In an effort to make the correct diagnosis, EPs must
calculate a pretest probability for PE. There are multiple scoring systems available
that attempt to classify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories. A
commonly used scoring system is the Wells criteria (Table 16–3). Based on findings
from the PIOPED study, clinicians correctly excluded pulmonary embolism 91%
of the time in low-clinical-probability patients; however, in the intermediate- and
high-probability patients, clinicians correctly diagnosed PE only 64% to 68% of the
time. Because clinical variables alone lack power to permit treatment decisions,
patients with intermediate to high probability must undergo further testing until the
diagnosis is proven, ruled out, or an alternative diagnosis is identified.
The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) is another commonly used
clinical decision rule (Table 16–4). This rule only applies to those who are low risk
for PE. If eight of the clinical criteria are met, then there is less than a 2% risk that
the patient has a PE and no further work-up is needed.

The initial chest radiograph (CXR) in a patient with PE is abnormal in 76%
to 90% of patients. However, there is no finding on chest radiograph that is
diagnostic of PE. Rarely, the classic Westermark sign (peripheral lung vasoconstriction) and Hampton hump (pleural wedge-shaped density associated with pulmonary
infarction) are seen. Serial CXRs obtained in a patient with PE are frequently associated with progression suggestive of atelectasis, pleural effusion, and elevated hemidiaphragm. After 2 to 3 days, the CXR in one-third of patients with PE demonstrates
focal infiltrates mimicking pneumonia. Because of the variability in these findings,
chest radiography is of limited use in diagnosing PE.
Interpretation of nuclear scintigraphic ventilation-perfusion scanning (V/Q scan)
may group patients into four result types: normal, low probability, indeterminant,
and high probability. Similar to the diagnosis of DVT, the clinical suspicion determines
the pretest probability and the accuracy of V/Q scans. Therefore, the subsequent management following V/Q scans should be formulated on the basis of clinical impression
and V/Q scan interpretations. One study reported that V/Q scan combined with chest
radiography had the same diagnostic accuracy as pulmonary CTA and V/Q scanning.
High-resolution CT angiography has become the standard initial diagnostic
test for the evaluation of high risk patients for PE. Additionally, MDCTA has
largely replaced single-detector CT scanners. MDCTA, according to PIOPED II,
has a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% for diagnosing PE. A negative
pulmonary MDCTA can safely exclude a PE. It has a positive predictive value of
86% and a negative predictive value of 95%. Due to limitations of PIOPED II,
these results may not apply to patients with renal failure, pregnant women, and
critically ill patients.
The addition of indirect CT venography (CTV) was also investigated in PIOPED
II. Although they reported a statistically insignificant increase in sensitivity (83%90%), specificity was not changed. CTV increases the radiation exposure and has
the equivalent diagnostic results as lower-extremity sonography. It should be used
with caution in younger patients who have the greatest long-term risk of radiation
exposure. It has the advantage of having the patient only undergo one test and getting information on the pulmonary and venous system. Remy-Jardin reported that

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

189

the greatest benefit from the addition of CTV to CTA has been shown in sicker
patients, in centers with less experience, and with older equipment.
In high pre-test clinical probability patients who have a negative MDCTA test for
PE, further testing is recommended. These patients represent a discordant group—
high risk but with a negative test. Options include repeat pulmonary MDCTA if
there were technical problems with the first test, pulmonary angiography, V/Q scan,
or lower extremity venous sonography.
Pulse oximetry and ABG measurements are insensitive in identifying PE and
should never be used to direct diagnostic workup. Despite the common practice of
obtaining ABGs in the workup of PE, multiple studies demonstrate that a normal PaO2,
normal PCO2, and normal A-a oxygen gradient does not exclude the diagnosis of PE.
Many recent investigations have focused on the use of the D-dimer assay for PE
and DVT diagnosis. D-dimer is a cleavage product created by the degradation of
cross-linked fibrin strands by the fibrinolytic system. The power of the D-dimer
test is in its negative predictive value rather than its positive predictive value,
provided a highly sensitive assay is chosen. A normal D-dimer value is helpful for
the exclusion of PE in patients with low pretest probability; however, because intravascular thrombosis may occur in conditions other than PE and DVT, the specificity
of elevated D-dimer is limited. It is important to bear in mind that a combination
of clinical history, physical examination findings, laboratory studies, and diagnostic investigations are frequently needed for the evaluation of high-risk patients. In
high-risk individuals, negative D-dimer assay alone cannot effectively rule out PE,
therefore imaging studies such as venous duplex ultrasonography, V/Q scan, CTPA,
or pulmonary angiogram are needed to exclude the diagnosis.

Clinical Decision Making
Ultimately, it is the clinician’s burden to combine the imaging and laboratory test
results with clinical impression to determine whether treatment for DVT/PE is
indicated. Figure 16–2 is a clinical pathway utilizing the Wells criteria for pretest
probability to evaluate for PE. The treatment for pulmonary embolism is generally
intravenous heparin therapy in conjunction with initiation of warfarin therapy (see
Table 16–2). Thrombolytic therapy has been advocated for those individuals with
a massive PE, such as those with hypotension for whom mortality is as high as
20% to 30%. There are no conclusive studies that prove a survival advantage for
thrombolytic therapy in PE.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

16.4 A 57-year-old man presents to the ED complaining of shortness of breath.
The onset was sudden, and is associated with pleuritic chest pain. He was
recently released from the hospital after being diagnosed with lymphoma. He
had an indwelling catheter placed in his left subclavian vein the day before for
chemotherapy administration. He was previously healthy without signiﬁcant
medical history. His vital signs are heart rate of 105 beats per minute, blood
pressure 126/86 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, O2 saturation 100% on room air. The breath sounds are clear bilaterally. His heart
sounds are normal without an S3 or S4 gallop. His left arm is mildly edematous,
but otherwise painless, with a normal pulse examination. There is no swelling
of his lower extremities and he has no pain with palpation of his calves. His
catheter incision site is clean and intact. Which of the following studies is
inappropriate for this patient?
A. Chest x-ray
B. ECG
C. Contrast CT scan of the chest
D. D-dimer assay
E. Duplex ultrasonography of the deep veins of the upper and lower extremities

ANSWERS
16.1 B. Venography is the gold standard for diagnosing thromboses of the deep
veins of the extremities and is useful when duplex studies are inconclusive in
high-risk, high-probability patients. Duplex ultrasonography combines direct
visualization of the vein with Doppler ﬂow signals. Part of the study relies
on the examiner’s ability to visualize compression of the veins to rule out an
occluding thrombus. Because intra-abdominal and pelvic veins are difﬁcult
to compress, their evaluation by this method is limited. Most clinically signiﬁcant PE derives from the large veins of the lower extremity, especially the
iliofemoral veins that can embolize large clots to the pulmonary vasculature
with disastrous hemodynamic consequences. Infrequent sources of PE can be
central veins of the upper extremity, the vena cava, or even the right atrium.
Despite its name, the superﬁcial femoral vein is considered a deep vein (it
accompanies the superﬁcial femoral artery), and can be the source of clinically
signiﬁcant thromboemboli. Active cancer, rather than a history of treated cancer (>5 years) is associated with a higher risk of DVT.
16.2 D. ECG ﬁndings are often normal or nonspeciﬁc in patients with PE.
ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities are the most common, but occasionally signs of right-heart stain may be noted, including peaked P waves in
lead II (P pulmonale), right-bundle-branch block, supraventricular arrhythmias, and right-axis deviation. The classic ECG ﬁndings of PE are S wave
in lead I, Q wave in lead III, and inverted T wave in lead III (S1Q3T3);
however, this is rarely seen. ECGs may help to diagnose other etiologies of
chest pain and shortness of breath such as pericarditis or tachydysrhythmias.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

193

Chest radiographs are also usually normal. In severe PE, dilation of proximal
pulmonary vessels with collapse of distal vasculature is noted (Westermark
sign). Twenty-four to seventy-two hours after a PE, atelectasis and a focal
inﬁltrate may be seen as a consequence of loss of surfactant. Pleural effusions
may be noted, and, rarely, a triangular or rounded pleural-based inﬁltrate
with its apex pointed to the hilum (Hampton hump) may be seen in the
case of an infarction. ABG ﬁndings are often confusing, and abnormalities
are usually a result of underlying pathology such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pneumonia. A low PO2 in an otherwise healthy
patient at risk for DVT/PE is more useful. O2 saturation is rarely depressed
and not very useful in the workup of PE. High sensitivity D-dimer levels are
most useful for their negative predictive value in helping to rule out PE in
low to moderate pretest-probability patients. It is a very sensitive, but nonspeciﬁc test. A normal high sensitivity D-dimer level in a low to moderate
pretest probability patient makes PE unlikely and further diagnostic workup
is not indicated.
16.3 B. Malignancy, acquired or inherited hypercoagulable states, previous DVT or
PE, immobility, and pregnancy are all risk factors for DVT and PE. Although
surgery is a known risk factor, the length of the operation and time of postoperative immobility are factors that contribute to thrombosis. The patient
who underwent a noncomplicated appendectomy is at minimal risk for a DVT.
Patient with the bilateral knee replacement would have very limited mobility for a long period time putting him at risk for DVT and PE. Patient with
ovarian cancer is at risk because of her malignancy. A patient with a previous
DVT certainly has a greater lifetime risk for recurrence of a DVT. Patient had
a normal vaginal delivery 10 days previously would have a higher risk of DVT
than the general population.
16.4 D. This patient may very well have a PE, but other sources of his chest pain
and shortness of breath must also be considered. An ECG will aid in the diagnosis of cardiac etiologies including heart attacks or arrhythmias. A chest x-ray
will show other possible pulmonary processes, including pneumonia or a pneumothorax from the central line placement (as well as conﬁrm the position of
the line). Duplex ultrasonography will help examine the venous system for
thromboses and possible sources of PE, including the deep veins of the upper
extremity, because this patient now has an indwelling catheter that can be a
source of thrombus formation. A D-dimer assay is not useful in this patient
because he is a high-probability patient and this test should only be ordered
in low-probability patients. CTA would be an appropriate test to order in this
patient as it can diagnose a PE as well as other etiologies of his symptoms.
Also, pulmonary angiography is not yet indicated in this patient until further
diagnostic workup leads one to suspect a PE as the source of his symptoms with
an otherwise negative workup. Pulmonary angiography is invasive, costly, time
consuming, and not without its own complications, and should therefore be
used judiciously.

for altered mental status (AMS). She states that for the past day, he has been
confused and unsteady when he walks. The patient has a history of hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidemia. He complains of headache and blurry vision. On
examination, he is alert and oriented to person only. On fundoscopy, the optic
discs appear hyperemic and swollen, with a loss of sharp margins. His neurologic
examination is nonfocal and otherwise has a normal physical examination. The
patient’s vital signs are a blood pressure of 245/140 mm Hg, heart rate of 95 beats

ANSWERS TO CASE 17:
Hypertensive Encephalopathy
Summary: 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension that presents with AMS,
headache, and blurry vision with a blood pressure of 245/140 mm Hg. His physical
examination is significant for bilateral papilledema and AMS.
• Most likely diagnosis: Hypertensive encephalopathy.
• Best management: Confirm the diagnosis by ruling out ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, infection, and mass lesion. Lower blood pressure with intravenous
(IV) medications and check for evidence of other end-organ damage.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the presentation of various hypertensive emergencies.
2. Recognize the difference between a hypertensive urgency and emergency.
3. Understand how to manage blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies.

Considerations
This is a 55-year-old man with AMS, papilledema, and severe hypertension. This
presentation is most likely hypertensive encephalopathy, which is defined as the
presence of neurologic abnormalities secondary to acute elevation in blood pressure.
In the past, hypertensive encephalopathy and malignant hypertension have been
used interchangeably. The latter term, however, was removed from the national
blood pressure guidelines. Hypertensive encephalopathy is one of many forms of
hypertensive emergency. It is critical for the physician to manage the patient’s blood
pressure if there is evidence of end-organ dysfunction. This is in contrast to blood
pressure management in hypertensive urgency.
Once the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) are addressed,
the first step in management is to obtain a noncontrast head computed tomography (NCHCT) to rule out the presence of mass lesion and hemorrhagic or
ischemic stroke. Once these diagnoses are eliminated and the diagnosis of hypertensive encephalopathy is established, the focus should turn to lowering the blood
pressure. Intravenous antihypertensives should be administered to lower the
patient’s blood pressure. The goal is not to normalize the blood pressure because
this can lead to cerebral ischemia secondary to hypoperfusion. Instead, the goal is
to reduce the MAP by 20% to 25% over the first hour. Various antihypertensive agents are available to manage this disorder. This is in contrast to typical
blood pressure management in patients with long-standing hypertension who do
not have acute end-organ damage. Sodium nitroprusside, labetalol, and nicardipine are the first-line agents for lowering blood pressure in the setting of hypertensive encephalopathy. Sodium nitroprusside is administered as an IV infusion

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

197

starting at a rate of 0.25 μg/kg/min and can be increased to a maximum of 10 μg/
kg/min. Labetalol is administered as an IV bolus of 20 mg, which can be repeated.
It can also be administered as an IV infusion at a rate of 0.5 to 2.0 mg/min. Nicardipine is administered at 5 mg/h, and can be increased by 2.5 mg/h every 5 minutes
to a maximum of 30 mg/h.

APPROACH TO:
Hypertensive Emergencies
DEFINITIONS
HYPERTENSION: Defined as blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg.
HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY: The presence of acute end-organ damage in
the setting of elevated blood pressure.
HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY: The presence of elevated blood pressure, without
evidence of acute, ongoing end-organ damage. It requires urgent, but not emergent,
blood pressure reduction.
HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHY: Transient neurologic symptoms associated with elevated blood pressure.
PREECLAMPSIA: Elevated blood pressure (140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg
diastolic) in a pregnant patient accompanied by proteinuria, edema, or both occurring after 20 weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia in a patient with preexisting essential
hypertension is diagnosed if systolic BP has increased by 30 mm Hg or if diastolic BP
has increased by 15 mm Hg.
SEVERE PREECLAMPSIA: Severe hypertension, excess proteinuria, oliguria,
cerebral or visual disturbances, pulmonary edema, impaired liver function, epigastric
or right upper quadrant pain, thrombocytopenia or fetal growth restriction.
ECLAMPSIA: Seizure activity or coma unrelated to other cerebral conditions in a
pregnant patient with preeclampsia.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hypertension is found in 20% to 30% of adults in developed countries. Hypertension is more common in men than in women, and blood pressure seems to increase
with age. The incidence of hypertension is 1.5 to 2.0 times greater in African Americans than in Caucasians. Hypertension is defined as two readings of greater than
140/90 mm Hg on two different occasions. Hypertensive emergencies will occur in
approximately 1% of these individuals and account for approximately 2% to 3% of
all ED visits. The most common risk factor in hypertensive emergencies is a history
of hypertension.
Hypertensive urgencies are acute elevations in blood pressure without the
signs or symptoms of acute end-organ damage. Previously, it was believed that
hypertensive urgencies required immediate, aggressive blood pressure reduction.

198

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

However, no studies demonstrated a benefit of this management and the potential
for harm exists. The elevated blood pressure in this circumstance should be reduced
over days to weeks and the patient can be discharged from the ED and followed up
in 24 to 48 hours as an outpatient.
The pathophysiology of hypertensive end-organ damage is not completely understood. Current theory holds that the acute rise in blood pressure leads to a series of
vascular events, which causes end-organ damage. In hypertensive encephalopathy it
is believed that the acute rise in blood pressure causes endothelial cell dysfunction
in the brain’s vascular supply leading to cerebral edema. Hypertensive encephalopathy can manifest clinically as visual changes, papilledema, focal neurologic
deficits, and seizure. Hypertensive encephalopathy is an uncommon clinical entity.
In order to establish the diagnosis, more common causes of altered mental status
must be ruled out, including, but not limited to, meningitis, encephalitis, ischemic
or hemorrhagic stroke, mass lesion, and toxic ingestion.
The diagnosis of hypertensive emergency requires evidence of acute end-organ
dysfunction that is attributable to an elevation in blood pressure. This dysfunction can manifest through multiple organ systems and includes acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, acute left ventricular failure, acute pulmonary
edema, cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, acute renal failure, preeclampsia/
eclampsia, symptomatic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and hypertensive
encephalopathy.
It is critical to differentiate a hypertensive emergency from urgency. This is
accomplished through a focused history, physical examination, and appropriate
ancillary tests. A detailed medical history must be obtained to determine if the
patient has underlying renal, cardiac, or endocrine manifestations. The patient’s
current medications must be known and the possibility of ingestion of illicit drugs or
other substances must be considered. In particular, obtaining history about the use of
cocaine or other sympathomimetic substances (phenylephrine, monoamine oxidase
inhibitors) is crucial as it significantly alters the treatment regimen (β-blockers must
be avoided in the setting of sympathomimetic use). Elucidate any symptoms related
to end-organ damage such as chest pain (myocardial infarction, aortic dissection),
dyspnea (congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema), anuria (renal failure), visual
changes (papilledema, retinal hemorrhages), altered mental status, and seizures. For
patients more than 20 weeks pregnant or who recently gave birth, investigate symptoms of preeclampsia.
The physical examination should also assess for signs of end-organ damage. Fundoscopy can reveal papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, and exudates. Cardiovascular
examination can identify signs of heart failure such as jugular venous distension, an
S3 gallop, pulmonary rales, and extremity edema. Neurologic examination should
evaluate the mental status and signs of focal deficits.
Ancillary testing varies in the patient with hypertensive emergency depending
on the patient’s symptoms and which end-organ is affected. An ECG and cardiac
enzymes should be obtained in patients suspected of having a myocardial infarction.
Electrolytes including creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hemoglobin,
and proteinuria and red blood cell casts on urinalysis may point toward renal failure
or glomerulonephritis. A chest radiograph may aid in the diagnosis of congestive

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

199

heart failure, pulmonary edema, and aortic dissection. A head CT scan should be
obtained in all patients who present with altered mental status or a focal neurologic
deficit in order to rule out a mass lesion, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.

Hypertensive Disease in Pregnancy
Preeclampsia is a unique form of hypertensive emergency, which occurs in pregnant patients. The exact pathophysiology is unknown but it is characterized by an
abnormal vascular response to placental implantation. It is associated with increased
systemic vascular resistance, activation of the coagulation system, platelet aggregation, and endothelial cell dysfunction. Predicting which patients will develop preeclampsia or eclampsia is difficult but epidemiologic studies have identified several
risk factors including chronic hypertension and nulliparity.
Various organ systems can be affected, especially with severe elevation in blood
pressure. Damage to the renal glomerular system leads to proteinuria and eventually,
renal failure. Hepatic function is compromised and can lead to periportal hemorrhagic necrosis, subcapsular hematoma, or hepatic rupture. Disorders of coagulation
may occur as hemolytic-uremic syndrome. A percentage of women suffering from
preeclampsia go on to develop HELLP syndrome characterized by Hemolytic anemia, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelet count. Eclampsia is characterized by
tonic-clonic seizures in addition to the above multiorgan system involvement. Vasospasm and impairment of the autoregulation system in the brain can cause cerebral
edema, thrombosis, hemorrhage, blindness, seizure, or coma.
Management primarily focuses on stabilization of the mother through control
of blood pressure and progression to eclampsia. Hydralazine is the antihypertensive
agent of choice in preeclampsia and eclampsia. The goal should not be to normalize
the blood pressure because this can lead to placental insufficiency (inadequate blood
flow to the fetus). Target blood pressure is approximately 160/100 mm Hg. When
hydralazine is ineffective, labetalol is the second-line medication for treating hypertension. Delivery is the only definitive treatment for preeclampsia. The gestational age and the severity of the disease must be considered so the risks and benefits
of delivery versus expectant management can be assessed.

Management of Hypertensive Emergencies
Hypertensive emergency is a true medical emergency. Immediate evaluation and
management is critical to limit morbidity and mortality. The patient should be placed
on a cardiac monitor and an intravenous line should be started. After the ABCs are
assessed and stabilized, treatment begins by making the patient comfortable, consequently eliminating contributing factors that may exacerbate hypertension such
as pain, urinary retention, and hypoxia. Patients require immediate administration
of antihypertensive medications to prevent irreversible end-organ damage (except
in the case of acute ischemic stroke). As the elevation in blood pressure is being
addressed, definitive measures should be taken to address any complications.
Understanding the concept of autoregulation is essential in the management
of hypertensive emergencies. Autoregulation serves to maintain a constant, effective blood flow and perfusion to end organs, despite large variations in pressure.
In the brain, autoregulation acts by adjusting cerebral blood flow within the brain

200

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

microcirculation. Extensive studies of cerebral circulation demonstrate that cerebral
blood flow (CBF) is maintained across wide variations of systemic blood pressure
by vasoconstriction and vasodilatation in normotensive patients. Because it is difficult to measure CBF accurately, especially regional differences and requirements,
the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is used as a surrogate indicator for monitoring. The CPP is the pressure gradient required to perfuse the cerebral tissue. CPP
is calculated as the difference between the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the
intracranial pressure (ICP):
MAP − ICP = CPP
where MAP can be approximated as: diastolic blood pressure + ([systolic blood pressure − diastolic blood pressure]). Local cellular oxygen demands can be met and
regional cerebral blood flow maintained over a wide range of CPP (between 50 and
150 mm Hg in a normally functioning system).
In individuals with chronic hypertension, the CBF remains constant at higher
CPP. However, if MAP, and thus CPP, drops into normal ranges, CBF precipitously
declines leading to cerebral hypoperfusion. Although not as well studied, it is theorized that rapid, large declines in blood pressure in chronically hypertensive patients
would lead to hypoperfusion of other end organs as well.

Common Antihypertensive Agents Used in Hypertensive
Emergencies (Table 17–1)
Sodium nitroprusside: It is a potent peripheral vasodilator that decreases preload
and afterload by dilating both arteries and veins that cause an immediate decrease in
blood pressure. The recommended starting IV dose is 0.25 μg/kg/min and titrated to
desired clinical response and blood pressure. Because of its rapid action and potency,
intra-arterial monitoring is recommended when starting an infusion. Some drawbacks to this medication include its metabolism to a toxic cyanide compound. It
is also associated with reflex tachycardia and coronary steal in the setting of acute
coronary syndrome.
Labetalol: It is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic and nonselective beta-adrenergic
blocker. It lowers systemic vascular resistance while maintaining renal, coronary,
and cerebral blood flow. Unlike other vasodilators, labetalol causes minimal reflex
tachycardia. It is contraindicated in patients with acute asthma, COPD, and heart
failure, heart block, and sympathomimetic drug abuse (eg, cocaine). Intravenous
boluses of labetalol require 2 to 5 minutes to begin lowering the blood pressure. If
a single bolus of 20 mg does not achieve the desired blood pressure reduction after
10 minutes, either repeated boluses at twice the original dosage can be given or an
IV infusion can be started and titrated to the desired blood pressure.
Esmolol: It is a short-acting selective beta-1 adrenergic blocker. It has a rapid onset
and short duration of action. These properties make it easy to titrate. Esmolol is effective in blunting the reflex tachycardia induced by nitroprusside. It carries the same
contraindications as other β-blockers (see Labetalol). Standard dosing is an IV bolus of
500 μg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 50 μg/kg/min, which can be increased
by 50 μg/kg/min every 4 to 5 minutes until the desired blood pressure is obtained.

Nicardipine: It is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB). It may have
unique benefits in hypertensive encephalopathy as it crosses the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) to vasorelax cerebrovascular smooth muscle and minimizes vasospasm, especially in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nicardipine is contraindicated in patients with
advanced aortic stenosis. The main adverse effect is abrupt reduction in blood pressure and reflex tachycardia, which can be harmful in patients with coronary heart
disease. The initial infusion rate is 5 mg/h, increasing by 2.5 mg/h every 5 minutes
to a maximum of 30 mg/h. Once the target BP is reached, downward adjustment by
3 mg/h should be attempted as tolerated.
Nitroglycerin: It is a potent vasodilator that acts mainly on the venous system.
It decreases preload and also increases coronary blood flow to the subendocardium. Nitroglycerin can be administered as a paste, sublingual spray, dissolvable
tablet, or an infusion. It has a rapid onset and is considered the drug of choice in
hypertensive emergencies in patients with cardiac ischemia, left ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary edema. The recommended starting IV infusion dose is 5
to 15 mcg/min and titrated to desired clinical response. It is not recommended in
patients with severe aortic stenosis, left ventricular outflow obstruction, or inferior
wall myocardial infarction because of the chance of precipitating cardiovascular
collapse.
Fenoldopam: It is a selective peripheral dopamine type 1 (D1) agonist that has
recently been added to the list of medications used in the treatment of hypertensive
emergencies. It causes both vasodilation and natriuresis. Fenoldopam is administered
as an IV infusion with a starting dose of 0.1 to 0.3 μg/kg/min and can be increased
in increments of 0.05 to 0.1 μg/kg/min every 15 minutes to targeted effect. It has the
advantage of increasing renal blood flow and improving creatinine clearance. As
a result, fenoldopam may be the drug of choice in treating hypertensive emergencies in the setting of impaired renal function. It is contraindicated in patients with
increased intraocular pressure.
Hydralazine: It lowers blood pressure by a direct vasodilatory effect on arteriolar
smooth muscle. The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown. It is the preferred
treatment by obstetricians in treating preeclampsia/eclampsia for decades, but has
fallen out of favor for treatment of hypertension in other conditions. Hydralazine
can cause reflex tachycardia and CNS and myocardial ischemia. Another downside
of hydralazine is that while the half life is 3 to 6 hours, the total duration of effect
is up to 36 hours and can be unpredictable. The recommended starting dose is 5 to
10 mg IV bolus, which can be repeated every 10 to 15 minutes.
Enalaprilat: It is the active IV form of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitor. Enalaprilat lowers systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary capillary pressure, and heart rate while increasing coronary vasodilation. It has minimal effect on cerebral perfusion pressure. Some studies have found enalaprilat to be
particularly useful in hypertensive emergency with acute pulmonary edema (APE).
ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy. The dose of enalaprilat is 1.25 mg
IV bolus over 5 minutes and can be repeated every 6 hours. Enalaprilat cannot be
titrated to effect.

Conditions Associated With Hypertensive Emergencies
Hypertensive encephalopathy: The initial goal is to rapidly lower the blood pressure by no more than 20% to 25% of the MAP. More aggressive lowering of the
blood pressure can lead to hypoperfusion and ischemia as discussed above. More
normalization of the blood pressure may be contemplated over 24 to 48 hours. The
preferred medication is nitroprusside, labetalol, or nicardipine.
Acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage: There is continued controversy as to
when and how much elevated blood pressure should be lowered in patients with
ischemic stroke. In fact, a recent multicenter, randomized control trial in Europe
failed to demonstrate any benefit of lowering blood pressure in acute stroke and
showed a trend towards harm. For patients who are candidates for thrombolytic
therapy, blood pressure should be lowered to less than 185/110 mm Hg and maintained to less than 180/105 mm Hg for the next 24 hours. Otherwise, for patients
who are not thrombolytic candidates, cautious lowering of pressure greater than
220/120 mm Hg is generally accepted, being careful to avoid lowering it too much or
too rapidly as to induce drops in cerebral perfusion and cause greater ischemia. The
preferred medications include labetalol, nitroprusside, and nicardipine.
Acute myocardial infarction: The goal in lowering the blood pressure in these cases
is to decrease cardiac work by decreasing afterload and increasing coronary perfusion
pressure. The preferred medications include nitroglycerin and β-blockers.
Aortic dissection: It is critical to lower blood pressure rapidly in this condition to limit
progression of the dissection. Acute aortic dissection represents the only hypertensive
emergency where rapid, aggressive blood pressure reduction is indicated. The goal is
to maintain arterial pressure as low as possible without compromising end-organ perfusion. The preferred medications include labetalol alone. If this does not adequately
lower blood pressure it should be used in combination with sodium nitroprusside.
Preeclampsia/eclampsia: The most commonly used agent in the past was hydralazine. However, obstetricians are using labetalol more frequently because it has
similar efficacy and fewer side effects. In addition, magnesium sulfate is generally
administered for seizure prophylaxis, though it has not been shown to lower blood
pressure in hypertensive pregnant patients.

17.2 A 54-year-old woman presents to the ED requesting medication reﬁlls on her
antihypertensive medications. She has been out of her medications for 2 weeks
and cannot get an appointment with her private physician until next week.
She normally takes atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide. Her blood pressure is
190/100 mm Hg. The patient has no complaints. She has been waiting for
4 hours and is in a hurry to get back to work. Which of the following is the
most appropriate next step?
A. Change her medications to a calcium channel blocker.
B. Admit to the intensive care unit and initiate intravenous nitroprusside.
C. Give her a prescription for her medications, instruct her to take them
immediately, and have her follow-up in 48 hours.
D. Counsel the patient on the dangers of her noncompliance, admit to the
hospital, and begin the patient on intravenous labetalol.
17.3 A 38-year-old man presents to the ED after a motor vehicle collision. After
complete evaluation it is determined that he sustained a fractured right tibia.
The patient has a history of hypertension for which he is on pharmacologic
treatment. The patient is writhing on the gurney in pain. His blood pressure
is 210/104 mm Hg. The patient has no complaints except for right leg pain.
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A Pain control and monitor the patient’s blood pressure.
B. Start a β-blocker and monitor the patient’s blood pressure.
C. Call a social worker because of suspected drug or alcohol abuse.
D. Admit the patient to the hospital to get his blood pressure under control.

ANSWERS
17.1 B. This man has hypertensive encephalopathy, which is a medical emergency.
He has symptomatic hypertension causing end-organ damage. A head CT
scan should be obtained prior to starting treatment to rule out any intracranial
pathology. The appropriate treatment is IV antihypertensive medications to
decrease his mean arterial pressure by 20% to 25% over 1 hour.
17.2 C. This patient has hypertensive urgency. She has no symptoms related to her
elevated blood pressure and no signs of end-organ damage. The patient should
restart her medications and have her blood pressure reassessed in 48 hours.
17.3 A. Although this man has a history of hypertension, he is in excruciating pain,
which could be causing his elevated blood pressure. The appropriate treatment
is to control the pain, have the leg set back into place, and monitor his blood
pressure. The blood pressure should decrease once his pain is controlled.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Hypertensive emergency is defined as markedly elevated blood pressure
in the presence of end-organ damage, whereas hypertensive urgency is
markedly elevated blood pressure without end-organ effects.



One of the most common reasons for hypertensive emergency is patient
noncompliance with antihypertensive medication.



It is critical to cautiously lower blood pressure to avoid inducing a
hypoperfusion state that leads to cerebral ischemia.



Patients with hypertensive emergency should be admitted to a monitored
setting, preferably an intensive care unit.

CASE 18
You are working in the emergency department (ED) of a 15-bed rural hospital without CT scan capabilities, and a 25-year-old, previously healthy, woman presents for
evaluation of abdominal pain. The patient describes her pain as having been present for the past 3 days. The pain is described as constant, exacerbated by movements, and associated with subjective fevers and chills. She denies any recent
changes in bowel habits, urinary symptoms, or menses. Her last menstrual period
was 6 days ago. The physical examination reveals temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F),
pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/70 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Her skin is nonicteric. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. The abdomen is mildly distended and tender in both right
and left lower quadrants. Involuntary guarding and localized rebound tenderness
are noted in the right lower quadrant. The pelvic examination reveals no cervical
discharge; cervical motion tenderness and right adnexal tenderness are present.
The rectal examination reveals no masses or tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal
white blood cell count (WBC) of 14,000 cells/mm3, a normal hemoglobin, and a
normal hematocrit. The urinalysis reveals 3 to 5 WBC/high-power field (HPF), few
bacteria, and trace ketones.

ANSWERS TO CASE 18:
Acute Abdominal Pain
Summary: A 25-year-old, previously healthy, woman presents with a 3-day history of
lower abdominal pain and subjective fever. Her examination indicates the presence
of fever and lower abdominal tenderness (right > left). The rectal examination is
unremarkable. Her laboratory studies indicate leukocytosis.
• Most likely diagnosis: Likely diagnoses include complicated acute appendicitis,
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ovarian torsion, or other pelvic pathology.
• Confirmatory studies: Begin with pregnancy test and pelvic ultrasonography to
evaluate for possible ovarian and pelvic pathology. If these suggest pelvic source
of pathology, then strong consideration should be given to perform exploratory
laparoscopy or laparotomy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the relationships between symptoms, findings, and pathophysiology of the
various types of disease processes capable of producing acute abdominal pain.
2. Learn to develop reasonable diagnostic and treatment strategies based on clinical
diagnosis, resource availability, and patient characteristics.
3. Learn the diagnosis and severity stratification for acute pancreatitis.

Considerations
This is a healthy young woman, who presents with acute pain in the lower abdomen.
Based on patient age and location of pain, acute appendicitis and gynecological
pathology are the most likely sources of pathology, and additional history and diagnostic studies may help to differentiate these possibilities.
Pertinent gynecological history should include history of sexual contacts, menstrual pattern, previous gynecological problems, and the probability of pregnancy.
A pregnancy test should be obtained early during the evaluation process to verify
the presence or absence of pregnancy, and if the history and physical examination
suggest the source of pathology to have originated from the pelvic organs, a pelvic
ultrasound should be obtained.
In the event that the patient is pregnant, an ultrasound should be performed
to verify intrauterine gestational sac and estimate the gestational age. If an intrauterine gestational sac is not visualized by ultrasound, the possibility of ectopic
pregnancy should be considered and an immediate referral should be made for a
gynecologic evaluation and possible operative intervention. Whereas, if the pregnancy test is negative and pelvic pathology is strongly suspected, the initial priority would be to identify potential life-threatening and fertility-reducing processes,
including tuboovarian abscesses, pelvic inflammatory diseases, and ovarian torsion.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

209

Pelvic ultrasonography would be very valuable as the initial study to identify or
rule out these processes. In the event that the pelvic ultrasound does not identify
any pelvic pathology, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis
may be useful. The management approach for patient with abdominal pain varies
depending on resource and expertise availability. For this patient at a 15-bed facility
without CT capability, the general surgeon should be consulted early regarding the
potential need for transfer to another facility or further evaluation by laparoscopy
or laparotomy.

APPROACH TO:
Abdominal Pain
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE ABDOMEN: “Acute abdomen” describes the recent onset of abdominal
pain. Patients with acute abdomen require urgent evaluation and not necessarily
urgent operations.
FOREGUT: Foregut extends from oropharynx to mid-duodenum, including liver,
biliary tract, pancreas, and spleen.
HINDGUT: Hindgut extends from distal transverse colon to rectum.
MIDGUT: Midgut extends from distal duodenum to mid-transverse colon.
REFERRED PAIN: This pain usually arises from a deep structure to a remote
deep or superficial structure. The pattern of referred pain is based on the existence of shared central pathways between the afferent neurons of cutaneous dermatomes and intra-abdominal structures. Frequently, referred pain is associated
with skin hyperalgesia and increased muscle tone. (Classic example of referred
pain occurs with irritation of the left hemidiaphragm from ruptured spleen that
causes referred pain to the left shoulder because of shared innervation by the same
cervical nerves.)
SOMATIC PAIN: This pain arises from the irritation of the parietal peritoneum.
This type of pain is mediated mainly by spinal nerve fibers supplying the abdominal
wall and is perceived as sharp, constant, and generally localized to one of four
quadrants. Somatic pain may arise as a result of changes in pH and temperature
(infection and inflammation) or pressure increase (surgical incision).
VISCERAL PAIN: This pain is generally characterized as dull, crampy, deep,
or aching. Normal embryological development of abdominal viscera results in
symmetrical bilateral autonomic innervations leading to visceral pain being perceived in the midline location. Visceral stimulation can be produced by stretching and torsion, chemical stimulation, ischemia, or inflammation. Visceral pain
from gastrointestinal (GI) tract structures correlate with pain location based on
their embryonic origins, where foregut pain is perceived in the epigastrium, midgut
pain is perceived in the periumbilical region, and hindgut pain is perceived in the
hypogastrium.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

CLINICAL APPROACH
Abdominal pain is a common chief complaint of patients seen in the ED, comprising approximately 5% to 8% of total visits. Overall, 18% to 25% of patients with
abdominal pain evaluated in the ED have serious conditions requiring acute hospital
care. In a recent series, the distribution of common diagnosis of adult ED patients
with abdominal pain were listed as the following: 18% admitted, 25% undifferentiated abdominal pain (UDAP), 12% female pelvic, 12% urinary tract, and 9.3%
surgical gastrointestinal. Approximately 10% of patients required urgent surgery,
and most patients with UDAP were young women with epigastric symptoms who
did not progress to develop significant medical problems.
Understanding of disease pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentations,
and the limitations of laboratory and imaging studies are important during evaluation
of patients with abdominal pain in the ED. Abdominal pain can be initially categorized as “surgical” or “nonsurgical”; alternatively, pain may be approached from
an organ-system approach. Overall, the surgical causes are encountered more commonly than nonsurgical causes when considering all comers with acute abdominal
pain.
Surgical causes (or causes that may require surgical corrections) may be categorized by mechanism into (1) hemorrhagic, (2) infectious, (3) perforating,
(4) obstructive, (5) ischemic, and (6) inflammatory. Hemorrhagic conditions causing abdominal pain include traumatic injuries to solid and hollow viscera, ruptured
ectopic pregnancy, tumor rupture/hemorrhage (eg, hepatic adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas), and leaking or ruptured aneurysms. Infectious conditions
may include appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, infectious colitis, cholangitis,
pyelonephritis, cystitis, primary peritonitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Perforations causing abdominal pain can occur from peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, esophageal perforations, and traumatic hollow viscus injury. Obstructive processes leading
to abdominal pain can occur from small intestinal obstruction, large bowel obstruction, ureteral obstruction, and biliary obstructions (see Figure 18-1 for radiograph).
Ischemic causes are subcategorized as microvascular or macrovascular. Macrovascular ischemic events can occur from mechanical causes, including torsion (intestines
and ovaries are most common), vascular obstruction from thrombosis, embolism,
and non-occlusive low-flow states, and these can include small bowel and colonic
ischemia. Microvascular ischemic events are uncommon and can occur from causes
such as cocaine intoxication. Inflammatory conditions causing abdominal pain may
include acute pancreatitis and Crohn disease; the mechanism of pain production
associated with acute pancreatitis is not clearly known but is likely related to the
local release of inflammatory mediators. Although, not all patients with abdominal pain produced by the above listed surgical causes need surgical interventions,
the potential for surgical or other forms of invasive interventions are high in these
patients; therefore, early surgical consultation is advisable.
Nonsurgical causes of acute abdominal pain are less common and occur most
frequently in patients with history of prior endocrine, metabolic, hematologic,
infectious, or substance abuse history. The endocrine and metabolic causes of
abdominal pain may include diabetic ketoacidosis, Addisonian crisis, and uremia.
Hematologic causes of abdominal pain include sickle cell crisis and acute leukemia.

212

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Systemic infectious causes of abdominal pain can include acute meningitis, TB
peritonitis, acute hepatitis, and varicella zoster infections. Because the differences
between surgical and nonsurgical causes of abdominal pain are often subtle, it is
advisable to consult a surgical colleague for all patients with acute abdominal pain.
In addition, because of the potential for complications development in some of the
patients with initially nonsurgical causes of abdominal pain, surgical consultations
and follow-up are essential for the management of these complex patients.
Patient evaluations should be directed toward identifying potentially serious medical conditions. Analgesia including narcotics should not be withheld in
patients with pain. In the event that a diagnosis is not identified following a thorough evaluation, it may be appropriate to discharge the patient with the diagnosis
of “abdominal pain of uncertain etiology.” Usually, individuals still under the effect
of analgesia without a diagnosis should not be discharged. For patients whose
abdominal pain etiologies are not clearly determined, it is important to provide
them with the reassurance that the pain most likely would improve and resolve;
however, because of the broad overlap in the early manifestation of serious disease,
the patient need to be instructed to seek early follow-up if symptoms do not resolve.
Furthermore, the use of narcotic pain medications should be withheld in the individuals without clear diagnosis or follow-up.

Abdominal Pain in Women
Women make up approximately 75% of all patients evaluated in the ED with abdominal pain. Women of childbearing age represent a complex patient population from
the diagnostic standpoint, because of a broader differential for pain. Acute appendicitis, biliary tract disease, urinary tract infection, and gynecological problems are
the most common sources of abdominal pain in childbearing-age women. The history obtained from each patient should include details of menstrual history, sexual
practices, gynecological and obstetrical history, and surgical history. For most individuals, the initial history and physical examination can help to direct the workup
toward an organ system or body region. Laboratory evaluations, including CBC with
differential, serum amylase, urinalysis, pregnancy test, and liver functions test, may
provide additional information to help rule in or rule out certain diagnoses. When
indicated, imaging such as ultrasonography and CT scans can be helpful in assessing
for biliary tract and pelvic pathology, and for acute appendicitis. Because overreliance on laboratory and/or imaging can contribute to misdiagnoses, laboratory and
imaging results should always be interpreted within the proper clinical context;
clinical judgment should be exercised regarding the acquisition of consultation
and/or observation.

Abdominal Pain in Elderly Patients
Elderly patients (age >65) account for approximately 15% of all ED visits, and about
one-third of these visits result in inpatient admissions. In comparison to young
adults, elderly patients with abdominal pain evaluated in the ED generally have
increased prevalence of serious diseases causing abdominal pain, where the frequency of illnesses requiring surgical intervention has been estimated to be as high
as 30%. Furthermore, the mortality rate associated with abdominal pain is increased

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

213

in this population as a consequence of the increase in catastrophic illnesses (including mesenteric ischemia, leaking or ruptured aneurysm, and myocardial infarction).
Common diagnoses among elderly patients include biliary tract disease (23%),
diverticular disease (12%), bowel obstruction (11%), and undetermined (11%).
Due to various reasons that include atypical clinical presentations and difficulty
with communications, abdominal pain in the elderly is associated with high frequency of inaccurate diagnosis (up to 60%). Inability to accurately diagnose the
cause of abdominal pain contributes to delayed treatment and increased morality,
as elderly patients whose abdominal pain were not accurately diagnosed in the ED
have been shown to have a 2-fold increase in mortality when compared to elderly
patients whose causes of abdominal pain were accurately diagnosed.
For most elderly patients, the evaluation should be broadened to help identify
cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, neoplastic, and neurologic causes of abdominal pain.
Often symptoms in this population are attributable to an underlying medical
comorbidity. It is important to bear in mind that medications taken by many elderly
patients may contribute to abdominal problems, as well as alter the clinical presentations (eg, β-blockers may blunt pulse rate response to stress). When indicated,
ancillary testing should be applied to assist in establishing the diagnosis; however, it
is important to remember that the diagnostic accuracy of any test is dependent on
the pretest probability, specificity, sensitivity, and disease prevalence of the test
population. Because abdominal pain in the elderly population is more frequently
associated with serious pathology, appropriate consultations should be sought out
and a liberal policy regarding inpatient or ED observation should be applied whenever causes cannot be clearly identified.

Patients With Acute Pancreatitis (AP)
Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory condition of the pancreas that can
affect adults of all ages, and in its severe forms, AP can affect all organ systems in
the body. Patients are said to have severe AP when the process is associated with
organ dysfunction, APACHE II scores ≥8, Ranson scores ≥3, or presence of local
complications based on contrast-enhanced CT scans (eg, pancreas necrosis, pseudocysts, or peripancreatic fluid collections). Severe AP is reported in 15% to 20%
of patients with AP. Mortality rates associated with mild AP is approximately 5%,
whereas severe AP is associated with mortality rates up to 25%. The diagnosis of
pancreatitis should be suspected when patients present with persistent abdominal
or back pain associated with elevated levels of serum lipase and/or amylase. In the
emergency department setting, the etiology of AP can be assessed by clinical history
(these should include inquiries regarding gallstones, alcohol use, medications, infections, metabolic and autoimmune disorders, family history, and history of trauma),
and laboratory studies that include liver function tests, calcium, and triglyceride
levels. In approximately 80% of the patients with AP, the cause can be determined
based on the clinical history and initial clinical evaluation. Identifying AP cause is
generally not critical during the initial management of patients in the emergency
center, but could have implications in the prevention of future disease recurrences.
Severity stratification for patients is helpful during the initial evaluation, as it may
help direct the triage of patients to intensive care units or specialty care facilities.

214

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Early management of patients is directed toward the recognition and prevention
of organ dysfunction in those patients with severe AP. Prompt repletion of intravascular volume is essential in the prevention of renal dysfunction. When patients do
not respond appropriately to their initial fluid management, central venous pressure monitoring, pulse-oximetry monitoring, and urine-output monitoring should be
considered to help direct these efforts and avoid fluid overloading patients.
Disease recurrences are common among patients with AP, especially when the
cause is alcohol, metabolically-induced, or produced by anatomic abnormalities
such as pancreas divisum and periampullary duodenal diverticulum. It is important
to identify patients with AP that are gallstone-related, because most recurrences in
these patients can be prevented by cholecystectomies.
CT scan of the abdomen is not necessary for the diagnosis or confirmation of
AP. CT scans in the emergency center setting may be indicated to help confirm
the diagnosis of AP when the clinical picture and/or biochemical values are not
sufficient for the confirmation of diagnosis. In addition, CT scan may help identify patients with significant pancreas necrosis, which often correlates with disease
severity and regional pancreatic complications (Table 18–1). CT scan with intravenous contrast performed in intravascular volume depleted patients with severe
AP could contribute to acute kidney injuries and further injuries to the pancreas;
therefore, these studies should be withheld until the patients’ volume depletions
have been corrected.
Patients with severe pancreatitis determined either by the presence of end-organ
dysfunction, APACHE II >8, Ranson score >3, or CT demonstrating pancreas
necrosis may benefit from close monitoring, therefore admissions to intensive care
units. Over the past several years, there has been a continued trend toward the

nonoperative or delayed-operative (>14 days) management of patients with severe

a surgical specialist because other intra-abdominal processes that would require
surgical interventions could mimic AP or develop as the result of severe AP.

Patients With Chronic or Recurrent Abdominal Pain
Patients with chronic or recurrent abdominal pain represent one of the most difficult diagnostic and management challenges for emergency medicine physicians.
The dilemma facing ED physicians during encounters with these patients include
establishing the accurate diagnosis, determining appropriate use of diagnostic
studies, determining the appropriateness of analgesic medications, and follow-up.
Similar to the approach taken toward patients with acute abdominal pain, the
evaluation of chronic abdominal pain should begin with a thorough history. Events
and activities that trigger or alleviate the symptoms may be helpful in identifying
the organ systems of pain origin. Furthermore, detail description of the patterns and
location of pain are helpful for categorization of pain as visceral pain, somatic pain,
or referred pain, and based on these determinations, organ system and anatomical
sources of abdominal pain also may be delineated.
The physical examinations in these patients should be focused to help sort out
the differential diagnosis formulated on the basis of history, and not a search for
pathology. Unfortunately, the physical examination findings are sometimes difficult
to interpret because of psychologic and personality changes, especially if the pain
has been chronic, recurrent, and severe.
Unfortunately, no specific laboratory or imaging studies are completely sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of abdominal pain. As a general rule, diagnostic
studies should be selected only if results of the studies will lead to specific additional
evaluations or treatment. The CBC might be helpful in identifying leukocytosis,
which may indicate an inflammatory or infectious condition, whereas the presence
of anemia might help to verify the presence of ischemic colitis, GI tract malignancy,
or inflammatory bowel disease. Abnormalities within the liver functions panel may
help identify choledocholithiasis, stenosing papillitis, and periampullary malignancy. Serum amylase elevation is generally seen in the setting of chronic or acute
pancreatitis. Elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate may suggest the presence
of autoimmune processes or collagen vascular disorders.
Frequently, even after the completion of extensive, appropriate evaluations the
patient’s condition may remain unrecognized. If possible, the results of the evaluation and diagnostic studies should be discussed with the patient’s primary care physician, so that the patient may be provided with additional testing and follow-up.
For those patients without primary care physicians, evaluation and consultation by
an appropriate primary care physician or specialist should be obtained prior to discharge from the ED.

18.1 A 30-year-old woman presents with epigastric pain that developed following
dinner. The patient describes having similar pain prior to the current episode,
but previous episodes were less severe. The patient was diagnosed as having
gastroesophageal reﬂux disease by her primary care physician and prescribed a
proton pump inhibitor, which has been ineffective in resolving her pain. The
current pain episode has been severe and persistent for 3 hours. The patient
has a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 130/90 mm Hg. The
abdominal examination reveals no abdominal tenderness. The administration
of 30 mL of antacids and 4 mg of morphine sulfate resulted in some relief of
pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
A. Obtain CBC, amylase, liver function tests, and ultrasound of the gallbladder. Discuss with surgical consultants regarding admission to the hospital.
B. Follow up with her primary care physician in 2 weeks.
C. Admit the patient to the hospital for upper GI endoscopy.
D. Prescribe antacids and discharge the patient from the ED, with follow-up
by her primary care physician.
E. Obtain an ultrasound of the gallbladder, prescribe oral antibiotics,
analgesics, and arrange for an outpatient follow-up with her primary care
physician.
18.2 Which of the following features best characterizes somatic pain?
A. Midline location
B. Sharp, persistent, and well-localized pain in the left lower quadrant
C. Intermittent pain
D. Pain is improved with body movement
18.3 For which of the following patients is CT of the abdomen contraindicated?
A A 60-year-old man with persistent left lower quadrant pain, fever, and a
tender mass
B. A 45-year-old alcoholic man with diffuse abdominal pain, WBC 18,000
cells/mm3, and serum amylase of 2000
C. A nonpregnant 18-year-old woman with suprapubic and right lower quadrant pain, fever, right lower quadrant mass, and WBC of 15,000 cells/mm3
D. A 70-year-old man with abdominal pain and distension, a 10-cm pulsatile
mass in the epigastrium, and blood pressure of 70/50 mm Hg
E. A 24-year-old man with a new finding of painful, irreducible umbilical
hernia who presents with 12-hour history of abdominal distension and
vomiting

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

ANSWERS
18.1 A. This patient has recurrent epigastric pain, which is attributed to gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. However, the fact that her symptoms have been
poorly controlled with proton pump inhibitors in the past suggests that the
diagnosis is probably inaccurate. Her recurrent symptoms are likely caused by
biliary tract disease, and her current presentation is highly suspicious for complicated biliary tract disease such as acute cholecystitis. Choice A represents
testing for the evaluation of biliary tract disease, which is appropriate in this
setting. Because of her fever, outpatient management approach described in
choice E is inappropriate.
18.2 B. Somatic pain is generally associated with irritation of the parietal peritoneum, resulting in localized, persistent, and sharp pain. This type of pain is
aggravated by movement and can produce spasm in the overlying abdominal
wall musculature, which is manifested as involuntary guarding.
18.3 D. The patient in “D” is hemodynamically unstable and possesses signs and
symptoms suggestive of ruptured abdominal aneurysm. A CT scan would likely
delay his care and is contraindicated in this situation. The patient described
in choice A likely has diverticulitis, where CT may be appropriate for severity
staging. The patient described in choice B likely has acute pancreatitis, where
CT is helpful for the stratiﬁcation of disease severity. The patient described
in choice C may have complicated appendicitis or some other complicated
GI or gynecological process, where CT can be useful for differentiation. The
patient described in choice E has an incarcerated umbilical hernia with signs
and symptoms of intestinal obstruction related to this ﬁnding. Surgical intervention is indicated based on his presentation alone.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Most patients with the diagnosis of “undifferentiated abdominal pain”
determined after thorough ED evaluation will have spontaneous resolution of pain.



Narcotic medications will affect the characteristics and intensity of all
abdominal pain, regardless of etiology.



Up to one-third of elderly patients with abdominal pain evaluated in the
ED have conditions that may require surgical intervention.

CASE 19
A two-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department (ED) because of an
episode of “choking.” The patient was playing with marbles when his mother left
the room for a few minutes. She ran back in when she heard the patient gagging
and coughing. She denies any recent fever, cough, or other upper respiratory infectious symptoms. When asked, she denies her son turning blue, having difficulty
breathing or vomiting. The patient was a term baby without any significant past
medical history. He is not taking any medications, and his immunizations are all
up-to-date. He attends day care and has no recent sick contacts.
On examination, his temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure is 93/55 mm
Hg, heart rate is 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and
the O2 saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is playful and alert. His examination
is unremarkable except for intermittent gagging. He has no intercostal retractions or
accessory muscle use.

ANSWERS TO CASE 19:
Swallowed Foreign Body
Summary: This is a two-year-old boy with probable ingestion of a foreign body (marble).
• Potential complications: Esophageal stricture, perforation, mediastinitis or peritonitis, paraesophageal abscess, cardiac tamponade, and aortotracheoesophageal
fistula.
• Most appropriate next step: Because the child is stable, x-ray to localize the
foreign body.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical scenario, signs, and symptoms of swallowed foreign bodies.
2. Learn the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the various types of swallowed
foreign bodies.

Considerations
Patients with swallowed foreign bodies may be asymptomatic or may present in
extremis. Although most objects will pass through the gastrointestinal tract without
problems, it is important to recognize which patients require observation and which
will need intervention (Table 19–1).

APPROACH TO:
Swallowed Foreign Body
CLINICAL APPROACH
Although children 18 to 48 months account for nearly 80% of cases, edentulous
adults, psychiatric patients, and prisoners also commonly swallow foreign objects.
Children most commonly ingest things they can pick up and place in their mouths,
such as coins, buttons, toys, and crayons. Adults are more likely to have trouble
swallowing meat and bones. Although objects can be located anywhere throughout
the alimentary tract, there are several areas where they lodge more frequently. In
the pediatric patient, most obstructions occur in the proximal esophagus at one
of 5 areas: the cricopharyngeal narrowing (most common), thoracic inlet, aortic
arch, tracheal bifurcation, and hiatal narrowing. In contrast, most adult patients
have distal esophageal obstructions caused by a structural or motor abnormality
(eg, stricture, malignancy, scleroderma, achalasia).
Most adult patients will be able to relate a history of ingesting a foreign object or
of feeling food becoming lodged. They may complain of anxiety, foreign body sensation, chest or epigastric pain, retching, vomiting, wheezing, or difficulty swallowing.

Foreign Body

Comments

Treatment

Food impaction

Avoid proteolytic enzymes because
of risk of esophageal perforation.

Expectant management if handling
secretions and impacted <12 h. Otherwise endoscopy preferred.

Avoid gas-forming agents if
perforation suspected.
Barium swallow after treatment to
confirm clearance of the impaction
and to rule out esophageal pathology.
Coin

Often asymptomatic.
X-ray to confirm location (esophageal coins lie with flat side showing
on anteroposterior x-ray).

Alternatives: intravenous glucagon,
sublingual nifedipine, sublingual nitroglycerin, oral gas-forming agents.
Endoscopy preferred if at the level of
the cricopharyngeus muscle.
Alternative: Foley catheter removal
under fluoroscopy if lodged <24 h,
bougienage (pushing object into stomach). Expectant management may be
considered if impacted <24 h

Button battery

High risk of mucosal burns and
esophageal perforation if lodged in
esophagus.
X-ray to confirm location.

Surgical consult for endoscopy if in
esophagus and has not passed through
the pylorus or patient symptomatic.
Expectant management if past the
esophagus and no symptoms. Repeat
radiographs until battery cleared.

Sharp or pointed
objects

X-ray to confirm location.

If foreign body proximal to or in
duodenum, endoscopic removal
recommended given risk of intestinal
perforation.
If symptomatic, impacted, or foreign
body past duodenum, surgical consult
for endoscopy or laparotomy. Otherwise expectant management with serial
radiographs.

Body packing

Ingestion of packets of drugs (most
commonly cocaine or heroin).
Rupture of packet may be fatal
(especially with cocaine).
May cause symptoms because
of drug effect or gastrointestinal
obstruction.

If packet intact, may observe and
use whole bowel irrigation with
polyethylene glycol to hasten passage
of packets through gastrointestinal
tract.
Otherwise surgery to remove packets.

Avoid endoscopy because of risk of
rupture.

In children, the history may be less clear. Parents may have seen the child with
an object in his or her mouth and suspect ingestion. Children can present with
vomiting, gagging, choking, refusal to eat, or neck or chest pain. Increased salivation,
drooling, or an inability to swallow suggests a complete obstruction. Patients with
airway foreign bodies tend to present with more respiratory symptoms (Table 19–2).

Treatment

Depends on symptomatology,
location, type of foreign body.
May include expectant management
or removal of foreign body

Removal of foreign body

The physical examination should focus on identifying patients with airway compromise, inability to tolerate fluids, or active bleeding. It should include a careful
evaluation of the oropharynx, neck, chest, and abdomen. Findings such as fever,
subcutaneous air, or peritoneal signs suggest perforation. In patients with a suspected
oropharyngeal foreign body, direct or indirect laryngoscopy can be useful. Plain
x-rays may help locate radiopaque foreign bodies throughout the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract and be used to follow their progression (if repeated every 2-4 hours).
Many foreign bodies are not radiopaque, including chicken and fish bones.
If plain films do not reveal the object, an esophagogram, computed tomography
(CT), or endoscopy are other options. If perforation is suspected, the esophagogram
should be performed with a water-soluble contrast agent. If aspiration is a concern,
barium is the preferred contrast agent; however, barium can obscure the visual field
if endoscopy is subsequently performed. CT can be useful to identify the location
and orientation of swallowed foreign bodies as well as the presence of any complications such as perforations or fistulae. Endoscopy is usually the study of choice
because the object may be removed once it is visualized. Some success has been
reported using metal detectors to locate and follow metallic objects.
Eighty to ninety percent of patients with normal gastrointestinal anatomy will
pass swallowed foreign bodies without complications. Thus most patients are treated
expectantly at first. If symptomatic, in-hospital observation should be considered
for serial examinations. In general, once a foreign object passes the pylorus, it will
continue through the GI tract without incident. However, if it cannot pass the

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

223

esophagus or pylorus, it must be removed. Again, endoscopy is usually the method
of choice. However, surgery may be necessary if there is evidence of obstruction or
perforation, if the object is too big to pass safely, or if it contains toxins.
There are several special considerations when dealing with certain types of swallowed foreign bodies such as button batteries, which generally need to be removed
because of their toxic effects on mucosa (see Table 19–1).

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS
19.1 A. Foreign-body ingestion is most common in children.
19.2 C. In adults, a swallowed object will most commonly lodge in the esophagus at
the lower esophageal sphincter. In children, the most common location is the
proximal esophagus at the cricopharyngeal narrowing.
19.3 C. Button battery ingestion is a true emergency with the potential for mucosal
burns within 4 hours and esophageal perforation within 6 hours of ingestion. A
button battery in the esophagus must be removed as soon as possible.
19.4 A. In general, the preferred method of swallowed foreign body removal is
endoscopy (except in body packers due to the risk of packet rupture).

CLINICAL PEARLS


Children account for the vast majority of cases of swallowed foreign
bodies.



In the pediatric patient, objects most commonly lodge in the proximal
esophagus, whereas most adult patients have distal esophageal
obstructions.



Findings such as fever, subcutaneous air, or peritoneal signs suggest
perforation and necessitate an emergent surgical consult.



Button batteries in the esophagus as well as sharp, pointed objects in the
stomach must be removed as soon as possible. In general, the preferred
method of swallowed foreign body removal is endoscopy (except in body
packers because of the risk of packet rupture).

CASE 20
A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining of
abdominal pain. The patient relates that he has been having intermittent pain
throughout the abdomen for the past 12 hours, and since the onset of pain, he
has vomited twice. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and
colon cancer for which he underwent laparoscopic right colectomy 8 months ago.
The patient indicates that he has not had any recent abdominal complaints. His
last bowel movement was 1 day ago, and he denies any weight loss and hematochezia. On physical examination, the patient is afebrile. The pulse rate is 98 beats
per minute, blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 22 breaths
per minute. His cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. His abdomen is
obese, mildly distended, with well-healed surgical scars. No tenderness, guarding,
or hernias are noted. His bowel sounds are diminished, with occasional highpitched sounds. The rectal examination reveals normal tone, empty rectal vault,
and hemoccult-negative stool.

ANSWERS TO CASE 20:
Intestinal Obstruction
Summary: A 55-year-old man with history of previous laparoscopic surgery for the
resection of right colon carcinoma presents with intermittent abdominal pain and
vomiting. The physical examination reveals no abdominal wall or groin hernias, no
tenderness, and high-pitched bowel sounds.
• Most likely diagnosis: Bowel obstruction. It is unclear whether the intestinal
obstruction is involving the large or small bowel, or whether it is complete or
partial obstruction.
• Next steps in evaluation: Diagnostic radiography, which can be either plain
x-rays or computed tomography (CT).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn to recognize the clinical presentations of intestinal obstruction (small
bowel and colon).
2. Learn the common causes of bowel obstructions.
3. Learn the approach in the selection of imaging modalities for the evaluation of
patients with possible bowel obstruction.
4. Learn to recognize clinical and radiographic signs of complicated obstruction and
the urgency associated with its management.

Considerations
In this patient scenario, the differential diagnosis for obstruction includes intestinal ileus, adhesions, ischemia, and obstruction from recurrence of metastatic colon
carcinoma. For this individual, the probability of ileus as the cause of his abdominal
symptoms is unlikely, because he has a history of crampy abdominal pain and findings of high-pitched bowel sounds, which are clinical features compatible with
mechanical obstruction and not functional obstruction. The first imaging study
to consider can be an abdominal series or CT scan. The radiographic studies will
help to distinguish partial obstruction from high grade, complete obstruction. The
abdominal series may delineate the level of obstruction. The presence of stool or
air in the rectal vault may suggest a partial obstruction, whereas the presence of
air and fluid levels in the small intestine, with the absence of stool and air throughout the colon, indicate a high-grade, small-bowel obstruction. His past history of
colon cancer points to the possibility that recurrent cancer may be the cause of his
bowel obstruction; thus, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen may be
helpful in identifying any obstructing tumor masses. In addition, CT scan can help
identify a transition point in the GI tract where the luminal diameter of the bowel
changes, thus differentiate a mechanical obstruction from a functional obstruction.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

227

APPROACH TO:
Bowel Obstruction
DEFINITIONS
CLOSED-LOOP OBSTRUCTION: Blockage occurs both proximal and distal to
the dilated segment preventing decompression. Examples include an isolated loop of
small bowel caught in a tight hernia defect, a twisting of the bowel on itself causing
a volvulus, or a complete large-bowel obstruction in a patient with a competent ileocecal valve. These obstructions are unlikely to resolve with nonoperative therapy.
COMPLICATIONS OF BOWEL OBSTRUCTION: Ischemia, necrosis, or
perforation as a result of obstruction.
CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN: This modality is increasingly used in the evaluation of patients with bowel obstruction. CT can help to differentiate functional
obstruction from mechanical obstruction. It is also useful in the evaluation of
patients with previous abdominal malignancy to help determine if the obstruction
is related to tumor recurrence. In addition, there are a number of CT characteristics
that will identify high-grade, complicated obstructions, and differentiate these from
uncomplicated obstructions. Disadvantages of CT in comparison to plain abdominal
radiographs include intravenous contrast exposure that has the potential of causing
acute kidney injury in a patient who is hypovolemic, and excessive exposure to ionizing radiation that could have significant late carcinogenic effects.
FUNCTIONAL OR NEUROGENIC OBSTRUCTION: Luminal contents
cannot pass because of bowel motility disturbances preventing peristasis. Etiologies
include neurogenic dysfunction, medication-related or metabolic problems, bowel
wall infiltrative processes such as collagen vascular diseases, or extraluminal infiltrative processes such as peritonitis or malignancy. Surgery generally does not improve
the above conditions; however, complications related to the above conditions may
require operative intervention.
MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTION: Luminal contents cannot pass through the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract because of a mechanical obstruction. The treatment can
be operative or nonoperative depending on the cause, severity, and duration of the
obstructive process.
OPEN-LOOP OBSTRUCTION: Intestinal blockage is distal, allowing proximal
bowel decompression of obstruction via nasogastric (NG) suction or emesis.
SIMPLE (UNCOMPLICATED) BOWEL OBSTRUCTION: Partial or complete
obstruction of the bowel lumen without compromise to the intestinal blood flow.
UPPER GI–SMALL-BOWEL FOLLOW THROUGH: This is contrast radiography done following the administration of oral contrast. The study accurately
localizes obstruction site and caliber in the small bowel. The administration of contrast may be associated with worsening of obstruction and aspiration. This study is
rarely indicated in the ED setting.

228

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

CLINICAL APPROACH
The causes of bowel obstruction in young children (<5 years of age) are quite
different than those found in the adult population. The following discussion is
limited to adult patients. Adhesions represent the most common cause of smallbowel obstruction whereas colorectal carcinoma is the most common cause of
large-bowel obstruction in developed countries. Table 20–1 lists the distribution
and clinical features associated with obstructive causes.

Pathophysiology
With mechanical obstruction, air and fluid accumulate in the bowel lumen. The
net result is an increase in the intestinal intraluminal pressure, which inhibits fluid
absorption and stimulates the influx of water and electrolytes into the lumen. Eighty
percent of air found inside the bowel lumen is swallowed air (see Figure 18–1).
Because of this, NG tube decompression may be useful in preventing progression
of bowel distension. Initially following the onset of mechanical obstruction, there
is an increase in peristaltic activity. However, as the obstructive process progresses
(usually >24 hours), coordinated peristaltic activity diminishes along with the
contractile function of obstructed bowel, giving rise to dilated and atonic bowel
proximal to the point of obstruction. With this progression, the patient may actually
appear to improve clinically with less frequent and less intense crampy abdominal
pain. The effects of mechanical obstruction on intestinal blood flow include an
initial increase in blood flow. With unrelieved obstruction, blood flow diminishes
leading to a breakdown of mucosal barriers and an increased susceptibility to
bacterial invasion and ischemia.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

229

Clinical Presentation
The common clinical manifestations of bowel obstruction are pain, emesis, constipation, obstipation, distension, tenderness, visible peristalsis, and/or shock. The
presence or absence of these signs and symptoms are dependent on the severity of
the obstruction. Pain associated with bowel obstruction is generally severe at the
onset and is characterized as intermittent and poorly localized. With the progression
of small-bowel obstruction, spastic pain decreases in intensity and frequency. However, continuous pain may develop as the result of ischemia or peritonitis. Patients
with large-bowel obstruction, pain frequently present with postprandial crampy
pain, and some patients with chronic large-bowel obstruction may describe the
symptoms as indigestion. Continuous pain may also develop with the progression of
marked distension, ischemia, or perforation.
Emesis is a symptom found commonly in patients with intestinal obstruction.
In general, patients with proximal obstruction of the small bowel report the most
dramatic episodes, whereas patients with distal obstructions may not experience as
much emesis. The quality of the material vomited may help indicate the level of
obstruction, as obstruction in the distal small bowel may produce feculent vomitus.
Contrary to common beliefs, obstruction of the large bowel often is not associated with vomiting, because the presence of a competent ileocecal valve (found in
50%-60% of individuals) frequently contributes to a closed-loop obstruction.
Absence of bowel movements and flatus are suggestive of a high-grade or
complete obstruction. With the stimulation of peristalsis at the initiation of an
obstructive episode, it is not unusual for a patient to describe having bowel movements. The presence of a recent bowel movement does not rule out the diagnosis of
a bowel obstruction. The classic description of decreased stool caliber is infrequently
reported by patients with large-bowel obstruction, and when reported, this finding
is not specific for colonic obstruction. On the other hand, diarrhea is frequently
reported by patients with progressive large-bowel obstruction. Presumably, with
high-grade narrowing of the bowel lumen, passage of the solid and semisolid contents are blocked, therefore the stools become more liquid in character. Distension
to some degree is generally observed in most patients with intestinal obstruction;
however, this finding may be absent in patients with obstruction of the proximal
small bowel; therefore, the absence of distension does not eliminate the possibility
of intestinal obstruction.
Patients with uncomplicated obstruction usually have mild, ill-defined, nonlocalized abdominal tenderness. The tenderness results from distension of the bowel
wall leading to the aggravation of visceral pain. In the case of open-loop obstruction, decompression by emesis or NG tube frequently results in the improvement
or resolution of abdominal tenderness. Localized tenderness is a finding that is
infrequently encountered in patients with uncomplicated bowel obstruction, and
the presence of localized tenderness is suggestive of complications involving an
isolated bowel segment. The presence of this finding should raise the suspicion for
a closed-loop obstruction, bowel necrosis or perforation, and in patients without
obvious need for urgent operative treatment, further evaluation with CT scan may
be beneficial.

MANAGEMENT OF SMALL-BOWEL OBSTRUCTION
When identified early, patients with uncomplicated small-bowel obstruction
should be managed by NPO, intravenous hydration, and NG tube decompression.
This therapy is directed at correcting the fluid and electrolyte deficits and reversing
the cycle of inflammatory and metabolic events associated with increased intestinal
luminal pressures. Many patients with early, partial small-bowel obstruction can be
successfully managed without further problems. Patients with suspected small-bowel
obstruction should undergo CT imaging, which may help differentiate uncomplicated small-bowel obstructions from complicated obstructions and help identify
patients at risk of developing complicated obstructions.
Typically, patients who present late in the course of obstruction are less likely
to resolve with nonoperative management. Furthermore, in these patients with
prolonged obstruction, the probability of bowel ischemia and necrosis is increased.
The development of complicated small-bowel obstruction is associated with increase
morbidity and mortality; therefore, every effort should be made to identify and initiate early treatment in these patients. No clinical, laboratory, and radiographic
criteria will reliably predict and identify patients with small-bowel obstruction who
will go on to develop bowel necrosis. The presence of fever, tachycardia, persistent
abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, leukocytosis, and high-grade obstruction
are associated with the increased likelihood of bowel necrosis. These findings
should prompt early referral to a surgeon, and patients with these findings are
more likely to benefit from early surgical interventions.
The nonoperative approach does not address the source of the small-bowel
obstruction. Therefore, prolonged nonoperative therapy would be considered inappropriate for patients with surgically correctable causes such as abdominal wall
and groin hernias and obstructing neoplasms. Similarly, patients with no previous
abdominal operations and no defined causes for intra-abdominal adhesions should
undergo resuscitation and prompt evaluation to identify a possibly treatable source
of obstruction (eg, Crohn disease, tumors, volvulus, and internal hernias).

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

231

MANAGEMENT OF LARGE-BOWEL OBSTRUCTION
Patients with large-bowel obstruction are often older and more severely dehydrated
and should be managed with nasogastric suction, intravenous fluid hydration, and
close monitoring for their responses to fluid resuscitation. Patients with inappropriate response to fluid resuscitation may require admissions to an intensive care
unit where invasive monitoring may be used to guide the resuscitation efforts; alternatively, poor response to initial fluid resuscitation could indicate complications
such as perforations and/or bowel necrosis, therefore early surgical interventions
may be needed.
The major diagnostic dilemma in patients with suspected large-bowel obstruction
is differentiating mechanical obstruction from functional obstruction (dysmotility).
In most patients, a CT scan will help make the differentiation. When mechanical and functional obstruction cannot be differentiated by CT imaging, a contrast
enema without bowel preparation may be obtained.
Colorectal carcinoma is by far the most common cause of mechanical largebowel obstruction. The site of obstruction of colon carcinoma correlates to the
luminal diameter of the large bowel, rather than with the frequency of distribution of carcinoma. The generally reported frequency of distribution of obstructing
colorectal carcinoma is splenic flexure (40%), hepatic flexure (25%), descending and sigmoid colon (25%), transverse colon (10%), and ascending colon
and cecum (10%). Less commonly, sigmoid volvulus, and diverticular disease may
cause large-bowel obstruction, in these settings the plain radiographs generally will
identify the sigmoid volvulus. When identified, the volvulus may be evaluated and
resolved by proctosigmoidoscopy performed without bowel preparation. Because
nearly all patients with large-bowel obstruction will require operative treatment,
surgical consultations should be obtained early in these patients.
One of the most devastating complications associated with large-bowel obstruction is colonic perforation, which generally occurs in the cecum or right colon. The
risk for developing colonic perforation is increased among patients with severely
dilated colon (>10 cm cecal diameter). These patients may or may not present
with frank peritonitis; however, most patient will have severe volume contraction
as a consequence of the ongoing inflammatory changes. The diagnosis of colonic
perforation should be entertained when patients fail to improve with aggressive fluid
management.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
20.1 A 44-year-old woman with a past history of appendicitis that was treated by
appendectomy 2 years ago presents with abdominal pain of 4-day duration.
Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse rate is 120 beats per minute, and
blood pressure is 100/84 mm Hg. Her abdomen is distended and diffusely
tender, with guarding. An occasional, high-pitched bowel sound is present. A
kidneys, ureters, bladder (KUB) x-ray reveals a markedly dilated small bowel
without air or stool in the colon. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of management?
A. Place IV, NG tube, and Foley catheter, initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics,
and obtain CT of abdomen.
B. Place IV, NG tube, and Foley catheter, initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics,
and prepare patient for operation.
C. Place IV, NG tube, and Foley catheter, initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics,
and attempt nonoperative treatment.
D. Place IV, NG tube, and Foley catheter, initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics,
obtain CT scan of abdomen, and prepare patient for an operation.
E. Place IV, NG tube, and Foley catheter. Admit the patient to the ICU for
monitoring.
20.2 Which of the following is the most likely cause of small-bowel obstruction in
25-year-old woman with no previous abdominal operations?
A. Adhesions
B. Hernia
C. Crohn disease
D. Adenocarcinoma of the small bowel
E. Endometriosis
20.3 A third-year medical student has been given an assignment to assess the relative
value of methods to differentiate between functional intestinal obstruction and
mechanical obstruction. The patient scenario is that of a 90-year-old woman with
Alzheimer disease, urinary tract infection, and abdominal distension. Which of
the following statements is most accurate for this clinical learning issue?
A. The history and physical examination is the most important test in differentiating between the two disorders.
B. The history and physical examination while often unhelpful is better than
imaging tests in differentiating between the two disorders.
C. The history and physical examination is typically unhelpful in differentiating between the two disorders.
D. Imaging tests are rarely helpful, may exacerbate the condition and worsen
the prognosis.
E. CT scan is helpful in differentiating between the two pathological conditions in this patient.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

233

ANSWERS
20.1 B. This patient presents with signs and symptoms of high-grade small-bowel
obstruction. The physical examination is highly suspicious for presence of
intra-abdominal complications associated with the obstruction; therefore,
CT scan is unlikely to contribute further in the diagnosis, and nonoperative
therapy is inappropriate for a patient who is already exhibiting signs and symptoms of complicated small-bowel obstruction.
20.2 B. Statistically speaking, a hernia would be the most likely cause of smallbowel obstruction in a patient without previous abdominal operations or other
causes of adhesions.
20.3 E. History and physical examination is often inadequate in differentiating
mechanical large-bowel obstruction from functional large-bowel obstruction,
and this would be especially true in a patient with Alzheimer disease and possible cause for functional large-bowel obstruction. CT scan of the abdomen,
barium enema and/or 4-view radiographs of the abdomen are some of the
imaging tests used in this setting.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Persistent pain in a patient with small-bowel obstruction is usually
suggestive of bowel ischemia or impending bowel necrosis.



Localized tenderness in a patient with small-bowel obstruction may
indicate an isolated segment of closed-loop obstruction, localized
ischemic injury, or localized perforation.



Because the symptoms and physical findings associated with large-bowel
obstruction are nonspecific, they can be easily overlooked by both the
patient and the physician.



Adhesions represent the most common cause of small-bowel obstruction,
whereas colorectal carcinoma is the most common cause of large-bowel
obstruction.

CASE 21
A 19-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department (ED) complaining
of abdominal pain and diarrhea of 3-day duration. She has also been nauseous
and has not been able to drink much liquid. Five days ago she returned from a
camping trip in New Mexico, but did not drink from natural streams. She denies
fever, but states that she has had some chills. Her stools have been watery, brown,
and profuse. The patient denies health problems. On examination, the patient is
thin and pale. Her mucous membranes are dry. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F),
heart rate 110 beats per minute, and blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg. The skin has
no lesions. Her heart and lung examinations are unremarkable except tachycardia.
The abdominal examination reveals hyperactive bowel sounds and no masses.
There is diffuse mild tenderness but no guarding or rebound. Rectal examination
demonstrates no tenderness or masses, and is Hemoccult negative. The complete
blood count reveals a leukocyte count of 16,000 cells/mm3. The pregnancy test is

ANSWERS TO CASE 21:
Acute Diarrhea
Summary: A 19-year-old healthy woman presents to the ED with a 3-day history
of abdominal pain, nausea, and non-bloody, watery, profuse diarrhea. Five days
ago, she was on a camping trip in New Mexico but did not drink from natural
streams. Her mucous membranes are dry. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), heart
rate 110 beats per minute, and blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg. The abdominal examination reveals hyperactive bowel sounds, no masses, and diffuse mild tenderness
without peritoneal signs. Rectal examination is occult blood negative. The leukocyte count is 16,000 cells/μL. The pregnancy test is negative.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute volume depletion and possible electrolyte
abnormalities
• Next diagnostic step: Stool for fecal leukocytes
• Next step in therapy: Intravenous fluid hydration

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know a diagnostic approach to acute diarrhea including the role of fecal leukocytes and assessment for occult blood in the stools.
2. Understand that volume replacement and correction of electrolyte abnormalities
are the first priorities in treatment of diarrhea.
3. Be familiar with a rational workup for acute diarrhea, and know the common
etiologies of diarrhea, including Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella, Giardia, and
amebiasis.

Considerations
This 19-year-old woman developed severe diarrhea, and nausea. Her most immediate problem is volume depletion as evidenced by her dry mucous membranes,
tachycardia, and hypotension. The first priority should be for acute replacement
of intravascular volume, usually with intravenous normal saline. The electrolytes
should be assessed, and abnormalities, such as hypokalemia, should be corrected.
After volume repletion, the next priority is to determine the etiology of the diarrhea.
Up to 90% of acute diarrhea is infectious in etiology. This patient does not
have a history consistent with inflammatory bowel disease or prior abdominal
surgeries. She had been camping in New Mexico recently, which predisposes her
to several pathogens: E coli, Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella, and Giardia. She
does not have grossly bloody stools which would usually mandate an evaluation,
and suggests invasive bacterial infections such as hemorrhagic or enteroinvasive

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

237

E coli species, Yersinia species, Shigella, and Entamoeba histolytica. Additionally, the
stool for occult blood is negative. Fetal leukocyte is an inexpensive and good test
to differentiate between the various types of infectious diarrhea. If the fecal leukocytes are present in the stool, the ED physician may have a higher suspicion for
Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, Yersinia, enterohemorrhagic
and enteroinvasive E coli, and E histolytica. Stool cultures are helpful. In general,
ova and parasite evaluation is unhelpful unless the history strongly points toward
a parasitic source, or the diarrhea is prolonged. Most diarrheas are self-limited, and
do not need evaluation. Table 21–1 summarizes the danger signs. Because of the
severity of this patient’s symptoms, empiric antibiotic therapy such as with ciprofloxacin might be indicated.

APPROACH TO:
Acute Diarrhea
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE DIARRHEA: Present for less than 2-week duration.
CHRONIC DIARRHEA: Diarrhea present for greater than 4-week duration.
DIARRHEA: Passage of abnormally liquid or poorly formed stool in increased
frequency.
SUBACUTE (PERSISTENT) DIARRHEA: Present for 2- to 4-week duration.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
Approximately 90% cases of acute diarrhea are caused by infectious etiologies, and
the remainder is caused by medications, ischemia, or toxins. Infectious etiologies
often depend on the patient population. For instance, travelers to Mexico or Asia
will frequently contract enterotoxigenic E coli as a causative agent. Those traveling to Russia and campers and backpackers will often be affected by Giardia. Campylobacter, Shigella, and Salmonella are also common causative agents.
Consumption of foods is also frequently a culprit. Salmonella or Shigella can be
found in undercooked chicken, enterohemorrhagic E coli in undercooked hamburger, and Staphylococcus aureus or Salmonella in mayonnaise. Raw seafood
may harbor Vibrio, Salmonella, or hepatitis A, B, or C. Sometimes the timing of the
diarrhea following food ingestion is helpful.
For example, illness within 6 hours of eating a salad (mayonnaise) suggests
S aureus, 8-12 hours post-ingestion suggests Clostridium perfringens, and 12
to 14 hours post-ingestion suggests E coli (see Table 21–1).
Day-care settings are particularly common locales for Shigella, Giardia, and
rotavirus transmission. Patients in nursing homes and who were recently in the
hospital may develop C difficile colitis from antibiotic use. In addition, immunecompromised patients with prior history of C difficile infections may remain colonized
and recurrent clinical infections despite appropriate treatment.

Clinical Presentation
Most patients with acute diarrhea have self-limited processes, and do not require much
workup. Exceptions to this rule include profuse diarrhea, dehydration, fever exceeding
38.5°C (101.3°F), grossly bloody diarrhea, an elderly patient, severe abdominal
pain, duration exceeding 48 hours without improvement, and an immunocompromised patient. Mortalities related to diarrheal illnesses are generally due to the inadequate recognition and treatment of dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and acidosis.
The history should be meticulous about trying to identify prior history of GI complaints, exposure history including medications, foods, travel history, and contacts
with individuals with similar symptoms. A history of recent viral illness may provide
clue to the etiology. Occupational history may help identify infectious sources.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

239

The clinician should determine what the patient can tolerate orally; in other words,
if the patient is both vomiting and having profuse diarrhea, severe dehydration is
likely. The amount and character of the stools may be helpful to determine etiology,
as well as direct therapy.
The physical examination should focus on the vital signs, clinical impression
of the patient’s hydration status, indicators of sepsis, mental status, and abdominal
examination. The patient’s hydration status is determined by observing whether
the mucous membranes are moist or dry, skin has good turgor or is tenting, jugular venous distention, and capillary refill. The principal laboratory test is the stool
for microscopic and microbiological examination. Stool culture results generally
require several days to become finalized and are not useful in the ED setting; however, these results may be helpful for follow-up evaluations and for patients who
do not improve with initial management. Ova and parasite evaluation is generally
unhelpful except in selected circumstances of very high suspicion. Stool for C difficile toxin may yield the etiology in patients who develop symptoms after antibiotic
use, and in most instances, the enzyme immunoassay results may be available in as
little as two hours. Although pseudomembranous colitis was classically associated
with clindamycin usage, fluoroquinolones are reported recently as the most common antibiotics contributing to the condition. C difficile infections are also being
increasingly reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where the
symptoms may be difficult to differentiate from an exacerbation of IBD. A complete
blood count, electrolytes, and renal function tests are sometimes indicated.
Traveler’s diarrhea most often presents as watery diarrhea occurring a few days
after traveling to Mexico, South America, Africa, or South Asia. This type of diarrhea is most often caused by enterotoxigenic E coli, which can produce diarrhea
from the generation of toxin leading to cholera-like symptoms; infections by enteroinvasive strains of E coli causing a shigella-like illness that is manifested by bloody
mucous-producing diarrhea; and chronic infections related to E coli overgrowth.
Fluids and electrolyte replacements are the mainstay of treatment for traveler’s diarrhea. A number of agents are helpful in reducing stool frequency, and these agents
include bismuth subsalicylate and loperamide.
Antibiotic therapy may be indicated when symptoms do not resolve with supportive care and stool-reducing agents. For travelers returning from the non-coastal
regions of Mexico, double-strength trimethoprin-sulfamethoxazole twice a day is
recommended. For other patients, ciprofloxacin (750 mg), levofloxacin (500 mg),
norfloxacin (800 mg), or azithromycin (1000 mg) are recommended. For immune
compromised patients and elderly patients with comorbidities, prophylaxis with
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a fluoroquinolone can be prescribed.
If the etiology is still unclear and the patient is not improving while off oral intake,
hospital admission and consultation with a gastroenterologist may be indicated.
Radiological studies or endoscopy may be needed to determine the cause. Diseases
such as inflammatory bowel disease or ischemic bowel disease must be considered.

Treatment
Fluid and electrolyte replacement are fundamental to the treatment of acute
diarrhea. For mildly dehydrated individuals who can tolerate oral fluids, sports

240

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

drinks such as Gatorade orally are often all that is needed. In developing countries,
the oral rehydration solution (ORS) introduced by the World Health Organization
(WHO) has been shown to be well tolerated by patients and well received by care
givers. For those with more serious volume deficits, or elderly patients or infants,
hospitalization and intravenous hydration may be necessary. Bismuth subsalicylate
may be used to alleviate the gastrointestinal symptoms, but should not be used in
an immune-compromised individual because of the risk of bismuth encephalopathy.
Many physicians choose to treat patients with moderately ill or severely ill appearance empirically with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 5 days. Antimicrobial
treatment may not alter the course of the disease.

Traveler’s Prophylaxis
The best method in preventing traveler’s diarrhea, which is principally caused by
enterotoxigenic E coli, is avoidance of food and water in areas of high risk. Travelers
should be advised to drink only bottled water, and avoid eating foods from street
vendors or unhygienic locations. “Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it” remains a sound
advice for individuals traveling to Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and South
Asia. The CDC endorses bismuth subsalicylate, two 262-mg tablets chewed well
four times a day (with meals and at bedtime), but does not advocate the use of
antimicrobial agents because a false sense of security or antibiotic resistance may
result. Nevertheless, many practitioners prescribe ciprofloxacin 500 mg once a day.
Medical prophylaxis (either bismuth subsalicylate or antibiotic) should not be
used for longer than 3 weeks.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

241

ANSWERS
21.1 C. Rotavirus usually causes a watery diarrhea, and is especially common in the
winter.
21.2 A. E coli is the most common etiology for diarrhea in travelers visiting Mexico.
21.3 D. S aureus usually causes prominent vomiting and diarrhea within a few hours
of food ingestion as a consequence of the toxin produced.
21.4 E. Raw seafood may harbor Vibrio spec; thus, the history of eating raw oysters
makes Vibrio-related infection likely.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The vast majority of acute diarrhea is caused by an infectious etiology.



Most acute diarrheas are self-limited.



One should be cautious when assessing acute diarrhea in immunosuppressed patients, very young, or elderly patients.



Significant dehydration, grossly bloody diarrhea, high fever, and nonresponse after 48 hours are warning signs of possible complicated diarrhea.



In general, acute uncomplicated diarrhea can be treated with oral
electrolyte-fluid solution with or without empiric ciprofloxacin.

A 30-year-old white man presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining
of sudden onset of abdominal bloating and back pain. Patient states he was
sleeping comfortably but the sudden onset of severe, constant pain that radiates
from his back to his abdomen and down toward his scrotum caused him to
awaken. He is unable to find a comfortable position and feels best when ambulating.
He admits to having had occasional hematuria but denies ever having this
type of pain before. He has no other significant medical problems. On physical
examination the patient is diaphoretic and in moderate distress. His blood pressure is
128/76 mm Hg, heart rate is 90 beats per minute, temperature is 37.4°C (99.4°F),
and his respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute. His cardiovascular examination
reveals tachycardia without murmurs. Lung examination is clear to auscultation.
Abdominal examination demonstrates good bowel sounds, and no abdominal
distension and costovertebral angle tenderness. A midstream voided urine specimen demonstrates gross hematuria.

ANSWERS TO CASE 22:
Nephrolithiasis
Summary: A 30-year-old healthy man complains of the acute onset of severe back
pain and a history of gross hematuria. He appears to be in moderate distress and has
not previously experienced these symptoms.
• Most likely diagnosis: Nephrolithiasis.
• Confirmation of the diagnosis: Perform a urinalysis, complete blood count
(CBC), serum chemistries, kidneys, ureters, bladder (KUB) radiograph, and
intravenous pyelogram or computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen.
• Next steps in treatment: Start IV fluids and provide adequate pain management for the patient before sending him for the appropriate imaging study.
Strain all urine once the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis is suspected and perform
stone analysis on any stone passed.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the history and typical presentation of a patient with nephrolithiasis.
2. Learn to order the appropriate laboratory and radiographic studies to diagnose
nephrolithiasis.
3. Learn to treat and manage nephrolithiasis in an acute situation.

Considerations
This patient has a very typical presentation for nephrolithiasis; male (three times
more common in men than in women) and the history of the sudden onset of pain
that radiates from his back toward his abdomen. The emergency department physician must be careful to rule out other acute abdominal etiologies that may mimic the
same presentation (Table 22–1 lists the differential diagnosis). Patients with nephrolithiasis often have difficulty in finding a comfortable position. Patients with an
acute abdomen often feel better when they remain supine without moving or with
their knees bent toward their chest. The pain can be described as constant, colicky,
or as waxing and waning. A history of dark-brown-tinged urine may represent old
blood in the urine (ie, from a stone high in the calyx), while a complaint of bright
red blood in the urine may be more consistent with a lower urinary tract stone. A
family history of nephrolithiasis or a personal history of stones within the urinary
tract may make the diagnosis easier. On physical examination, the patients are usually normotensive, afebrile, but tachycardic. The presence of fever would suggest
urinary tract infection such as pyelonephritis or some other disease process (appendicitis). The increase in heart rate is most likely related to his pain. Furthermore,
costovertebral angle tenderness and hematuria on urinalysis are highly suggestive of
a urinary tract process.

DEFINITIONS
CALCIUM OXALATE: It is the most common type of renal stone and is radio-dense.
EXTRACORPOREAL SHOCK WAVE LITHOTRIPSY (ESWL): Fluoroscopically focused shockwaves result in disintegration of the stone into fragments that are
usually small enough to pass in the urine.
NEPHROLITHIASIS: A condition in which stone formation has occurred within
the urinary tract system.
STONE COMPOSITION ANALYSIS: This is helpful in conjunction with
metabolic workup to determine the underlying cause for stone formation when
the history and physical examination does not identify risk factors for stone
formation.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
Urinary calculus disease is a common condition that affects up to 10% of the US
population. Nephrolithiasis is caused by urinary supersaturation; therefore, increases
in urinary ion excretion and/or decrease in urinary volume are common factors that
contribute to the process. The incidence of stone formation depends on a multitude
of extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors, including socioeconomic status, diet, occupation, climate, medications, sex, and age (Table 22–2). Nephrolithiasis is more common in men than in women (3:1) and has its peak incidence between the ages of 30
and 50 years. Individuals exposed to high temperature either by geographic location
or through occupational exposures are at increased risk of dehydration, which contributes to the risk of stone formation. Individuals with excessive sun exposure have

increased calcium absorption due to the increased production of vitamin D, therefore experience an increased risk of urinary calculus formation. Medications can also
predispose individuals to stone formation (see Table 22–2). Calcium-based (calcium
oxalate and/or calcium phosphate) stones are the most common types of stones
and account for more than 75% of urinary stones. Other types of stone include
magnesium ammonium phosphate, uric, and cystine stones. Uric acid stones tend to
occur in patients with low urine pH (<6.0) and with hyperuricosuria. Cystine stones
occur in the setting of cystinuria, which is a relatively common autosomal-recessive
condition causing defects in the gastrointestinal and renal transport of cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine. Magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) stones are
more common in women and are usually associated with urinary infections with
urease-producing organisms (Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella).

Clinical Presentation
The vast majority of patients with renal stones will present to the emergency department complaining of acute onset of colicky or non-colicky renal pain. Non-colicky pain is most likely caused by an upper urinary tract stone, whereas colicky pain
is more likely caused by the stretching caused by the stone in the ureter. In addition,
the presenting symptoms may include tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension,
which are produced in response to pain. Fever, pyuria, and severe costovertebral
angle tenderness usually indicate a medical emergency, because pyelonephritis
caused by obstruction often leads to sepsis and rapid clinical deterioration. Persistent nausea and vomiting due to stimulation of the celiac ganglion may require the
patient to be hospitalized.
A dipstick and microscopic examination of the voided midstream urine is very helpful, but the amount of hematuria does not correlate with the degree of obstruction.
Although microscopic hematuria is present in 90% of cases of nephrolithiasis,

a complete ureteral obstruction may present without hematuria. A careful analysis
of urine sediment for crystals by an experienced individual should be performed
promptly. In addition to the microscopic evaluation, a culture and sensitivity should
be performed.
A KUB radiograph is sometimes helpful in identifying a urinary tract stone (90%
are radiopaque). Traditionally, the intravenous pyelogram (IVP) has been the gold
standard in evaluating a renal stone because it gives information about degree of
obstruction as well as renal function. In many institutions, newer-generation
helical CT imaging without contrast is the preferred imaging method of choice
for the evaluation of acute renal colic; its sensitivity and specificity are greater than
that of IVP, but renal function is not assessed. CT imaging also has the advantage
of assessing the appendix, aorta, and diverticulitis. Regardless of test, the clinician
should interpret the clinical picture in conjunction with the imaging results. Before
an IVP, the patient should be questioned about allergy to contrast dye or shellfish,
the possibility of pregnancy, and preexisting renal disease. Pregnant women and
children generally should have ultrasound imaging first to avoid the radiation exposure. Table 22–3 lists the risk factors of nephrotoxicity associated with contrast dye.

Management
The critical issues surrounding nephrolithiasis are pain control, degree of obstruction, and presence of infection. Adequate analgesia is critical in treating a patient
with nephrolithiasis, and analgesic administration should not be delayed pending
test results. Depending on the severity of the pain, intravenous opiates, acetaminophen with codeine, meperidine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
or morphine may be necessary. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients
with renal insufficiency, in older patients, and in those with diabetes mellitus.
Evaluation of the patient’s volume status will determine how much and what kind
of intravenous fluids are necessary. Excessive hydration to dislodge a stone is not
therapeutic and should not be attempted. Because definitive therapy is guided by the
type of stones that are being formed, recovery of any passed stones and straining all
urine is important for long-term management.

248

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Conservative management, including analgesics, hydration, and antibiotics if
urinary tract infection is suspected, may be all the patient needs. Most small stones
(<6 mm) in diameter will produce symptoms but will typically pass without the
need for interventions. Indications for urgent urologic consultation are inadequate
oral pain control, persistent nausea and vomiting, associated pyelonephritis, large
stone (>7 mm), solitary kidney, or complete obstruction. If the patient is being
managed expectantly, the patient should be instructed to increase fluid intake and
strain the urine until the stone is passed. Medical therapy including calcium channel
blocker or α-blocker is being increasingly applied to facilitate stone passage and has
been shown to be associated with a 65% increased in the likelihood of stone passage.
Surgery is indicated in patients with stones larger than 5 to 8 mm, persistent pain,
or failure to pass the stone despite conservative management. Stones located in the
lower urinary tract system may be removed using a ureteroscope; upper urinary tract
stones can be treated by ESWL.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
22.1 After passing a kidney stone, a 38-year-old woman is told by her primary care
physician that she had passed a magnesium ammonium phosphate stone. She
is most likely to have had a urinary infection caused by which of the following
organisms?
A. Proteus
B. Escherichia coli
C. Enterococcus species
D. Group B Streptococcus
E. Staphylococcus aureus
22.2 A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of right
flank pain for the past 2 weeks. He has noted some gross hematuria and has
been unable to eat anything secondary to nausea and vomiting. Which of the
following is an indication for hospitalization?
A. Gross hematuria
B. Right flank pain
C. Nausea and vomiting despite antiemetics
D. Age greater than 50 years
E. Presence of a 6-mm stone

22.3 A 39-year-old man complains of the sudden onset of severe left flank pain after
running a marathon. He describes the pain as constant with radiation to his
left groin area. A urinalysis shows microscopic hematuria and the presence of
cystine crystals. Where is the stone most likely to be located?
A. Renal pelvis
B. Proximal ureter
C. Distal ureter
D. Uretero-vesicular junction
E. Bladder
22.4 A 33-year-old woman is pregnant at 12 weeks’ gestation and presents with
right flank pain and gross hematuria. She is afebrile. Which of the following
imaging tests is most appropriate for this patient?
A. Ultrasonography
B. KUB
C. IVP
D. Retrograde pyelography
E. Helical CT without contrast

ANSWERS
22.1 A. This woman has a magnesium ammonium phosphate stone, which are common in women and are associated with urease-producing organisms. Proteus,
Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella are all urease-producing organisms.
22.2 C. Hospitalization is required if the patient is unable to tolerate anything by
mouth. Gross hematuria and flank pain are expected with nephrolithiasis.
Appropriate analgesics should be prescribed for patients if they will not be
hospitalized. Stones 6 mm or less will generally pass spontaneously without
interventions.
22.3 A. Constant pain is most likely to be located in the kidney. Colicky pain is
most likely to be located in the ureter and is caused by the stretching caused by
the stone and inflammatory processes in the lumen of the ureter. Most stones
in the renal pelvis or bladder are asymptomatic.
22.4 A. Because the patient is pregnant during the first trimester, the initial imaging
test should be sonography to avoid the radiation-related teratogenic/
mutagenic effects on the fetus.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The acute presentation of nephrolithiasis resembles other pathologies;
the correct studies and appropriate interpretation of laboratory data will
help to establish the diagnosis.



Any patient with severe nausea, vomiting, fever, or signs of infection
should be hospitalized.



Adequate pain control for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis is a
priority even before all test results return.



All urine should be strained to confirm the diagnosis and for the stone
composition to be discerned.



The absence of pain does not mean follow-up is unnecessary. Identifying
the etiology of stone formation is important to prevent recurrence.

ANSWERS TO CASE 23:
Acute Urinary Retention
Summary: A 64-year-old man presents with an inability to void for the past 24 hours
and a tender mass in the lower abdomen. The patient has signs and symptoms
suggestive of prostate cancer, including unintentional weight loss, night sweats, a
decrease in energy, and an enlarged irregular firm prostate gland.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute urinary retention likely due to prostate cancer.
• Confirming the diagnosis: Thorough history and physical examination including a rectal examination, urinalysis, electrolytes and renal function tests, along
with bedside ultrasound, if available. Prostate-specific antigen may help in the
diagnosis of neoplastic disease if results will be available in the ED.
• Next steps in treatment: Draining the bladder by inserting a urethral catheter
should relieve the patient’s pain; if not, a suprapubic catheter can be placed.
Treatment of the underlying disease process is also necessary.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the typical signs and symptoms of acute urinary retention.
2. Know how to treat and manage acute urinary retention in the emergency
department.
3. Identify when patients with acute urinary retention require hospitalization.

Considerations
Many disease processes, trauma, and medications can result in acute urinary retention (Table 23–1). In elderly men, the most common cause is prostatic hypertrophy.
As with this patient, a thorough history and physical examination can help elucidate the etiology of the urinary retention. Passage of a urethral catheter to alleviate
the obstruction will bring about significant pain relief. Assessment of renal function
is important, as is obtaining a urinalysis to rule out concomitant urinary tract infection. Imaging studies in the ED are rarely necessary for these patients, although
bedside ultrasound may help identify bladder distention or a clot in the bladder.
Depending on this patient’s renal function and physical status after drainage of his
bladder, he may require admission.

Acute Urinary Retention
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE URINARY RETENTION: Sudden, complete inability to void accompanied by abdominal discomfort, with a palpable or percussible distended bladder
containing greater than 150 mL of urine.
AZOTEMIA: Presence of nitrogenous bodies, especially urea, in the blood that
develops in urinary tract obstruction when overall excretion function is impaired.
BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA: Overgrowth and proliferation of the
epithelium and fibromuscular tissue of the prostate.
HYDRONEPHROSIS: Dilation of the renal pyelocalyceal system because of
obstruction of the urinary tract system.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Because untreated urinary obstruction may lead to chronic renal failure, relieving
the blockage is critical. Loss of urinary concentrating ability, azotemia, renal

tubular acidosis (Table 23–2), hyperkalemia, and renal salt wasting may occur.
Hypertension is common in acute urinary retention because of the increased
release of renin by the involved kidneys. The most common presenting symptoms
are urinary hesitancy, decreased force, terminal dribbling, nocturia, and typically
overflow incontinence. Other symptoms include urinary urgency, hesitancy, and
frequency, straining to void, and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. Pain
due to bladder distention is the symptom that usually provokes the need for ED
evaluation. A detailed history and physical examination will often help to identify
the cause of the obstruction. History of previous instrumentation of the urinary
tract, trauma, neurologic disease, prostatectomy, urologic malignancy, or chronic
systemic illness may aid in the proper diagnosis and treatment. Evaluation of medications taken may help in identifying pharmacologic agents that may contribute
to urinary retention (Table 23–3).
On physical examination, a palpable mass above the symphysis pubis that disappears after insertion of a urethral catheter is highly suggestive of a distended bladder
(acute urinary retention). The meatus should be inspected for evidence of stenosis

and the penis palpated for fistulae or masses. Digital rectal examination may reveal
prostatic nodules, asymmetry, tenderness, bogginess, or the typical stony hard
enlargement of prostate cancer. A benign prostate on examination does not eliminate it as a cause of obstruction. Testing rectal sphincter tone, perianal sensation,
and the bulbocavernosus reflex can be important in cases of suspected neurogenic
bladder. In females, a pelvic examination should be performed to rule out inflammation, lesions, or an adenexal mass. Patient may also present febrile, tachypneic, or
hypotensive suggesting an infection or sepsis.
Electrolytes and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine levels should be obtained
to assess renal function. The BUN may be elevated due to significant resorption
secondary to the obstruction. A urinalysis is helpful to rule out concomitant infection, which would require antibiotics. Nephrolithiasis, neoplasm, or infection may
cause hematuria. Imaging studies are rarely necessary in the ED, although a bedside
ultrasound may help identify bladder distention or a clot in the bladder.

Management
Any patient with acute urinary retention requires relief of the obstruction as soon as
possible in order to prevent progressive renal dysfunction. Initial efforts should
be attempted with a standard urethral catheter. Lidocaine gel should be inserted
into the urethra to anesthetize and lubricate the urethra before inserting a 16- or
18-F Foley catheter. If the ED physician is unable to pass the catheter because of an
enlarged prostate, a 14- or 18-F coudé catheter may help. Occasionally a catheter
may not pass secondary to urethral strictures. A urethral catheter should never be
forced because urethral trauma and false passages may be created. In these situations, a urologist should be consulted. If consultation is not available, a suprapubic
catheter may be placed or percutaneous bladder aspiration can be performed. These
procedures may be performed with bedside ultrasound guidance.
After successful bladder drainage, complications may occur, including transient
hematuria, hypotension, and postobstructive diuresis. Postobstructive diuresis can
cause electrolyte abnormalities, profound fluid loss, and hypotension. Patients with
this condition require monitoring of their urine output and fluid replacement. Risk
factors for postobstructive diuresis include chronic bladder obstruction, fluid overload, and chronic renal disease.

256

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Many patients with acute urinary retention can be discharged home with an
indwelling urethral catheter and outpatient urologic follow-up. Admission should
be considered for patients with renal dysfunction, a serious infection, or volume
overload and for those who are unable to care for themselves.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
23.1 An 88-year-old woman is seen in the ED complaining of significant lower
abdominal pain and inability to void. She is noted to have a very full bladder.
After a urethral catheter is placed, 1400 mL of urine is drained. She is afebrile
with a blood pressure of 130/64 mm Hg, pulse of 74 beats per minute, and
respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Her laboratory results are remarkable
for a BUN of 65 mg/dL and a urinalysis with moderate leukocyte esterase and
many bacteria. Which of the following is the most appropriate management
for this patient?
A. Discharge home with oral hydration and recheck the BUN in 48 hours.
B. Discharge home with home health nurse visits.
C. Place the patient on oral antibiotic therapy and arrange follow-up in
1 week.
D. Admit to the hospital for further therapy.
23.2 A 65-year-old man presents to the ED with progressive inability to void, suprapubic pain, and a lower abdominal mass. He has never experienced this type
of pain before and is in moderate discomfort. Which of the following is your
next step in management?
A. Rectal examination
B. Decompression of bladder with a urethral catheter
C. Computed tomography of the abdomen
D. Percutaneous bladder aspiration
23.3 A 35-year-old woman without any previous medical problems presents with
acute urinary retention. She reports a history of increased fatigue with exertion
and intermittent paresthesias but denies any history of diabetes, hypertension,
or recurrent urinary infections. One year ago, she had some difficulty with
double vision that had resolved spontaneously. Which of the following is the
most likely diagnosis?
A. Drug abuse
B. Multiple sclerosis
C. Ovarian cancer
D. Spastic bladder

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

257

23.4 A 22-year-old woman complains of acute urinary retention, associated with
vulvar burning and tingling. A urethral catheter is placed and the bladder
decompressed. Which of the following is the best therapy for this patient?
A. Acyclovir
B. Azithromycin
C. Ceftriaxone
D. Doxycycline

ANSWERS
23.1 D. This patient needs to be hospitalized because of a concomitant urinary
tract infection and renal dysfunction. At 88 years of age, she may also have
difficulty caring for herself.
23.2 B. Decompression of the bladder with a urethral catheter should be performed
before examination of the prostate. Percutaneous bladder aspiration is not
indicated unless other attempts to decompress the bladder have failed.
23.3 B. Acute urinary retention may be the presenting symptom of multiple sclerosis
(MS) in a young healthy female with no previous medical problems. MS is
characterized by chronic waxing and waning of neurologic symptoms.
23.4 A. This is likely caused by herpes simplex virus with associated urethral irritation and urinary retention. The best treatment is acyclovir.

CLINICAL PEARLS


A thorough history and physical examination will often help to identify the
cause of acute urinary retention.



Bladder decompression should be performed as quickly as possible to
prevent further damage to the urinary system.



Consultation with a urologist may be necessary if urethral catheterization
cannot be accomplished with a Foley or coudé catheter.



Admission should be considered for patients with renal dysfunction, a
serious infection, or volume overload and for those who are unable to
care for themselves.

CASE 24
An 18-year-old adolescent woman presents to the emergency department (ED)
complaining of a 1-week history of abdominal pain. She tells you that she and
her friends recently returned from spring break vacation in Mexico, and she has
noticed a constant ache that is worse on her right side. The patient’s mother is
worried because her daughter has been unable to eat or drink anything for 2 days
and thinks she may have become sick from drinking the water while on vacation.
After asking the mother to step out of the room while you examine the patient,
she tells you that she has had five sexual partners, occasionally uses condom for
birth control, and has never been pregnant. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks
ago and was heavier than normal. On physical examination, her blood pressure
was 100/70, pulse 110 beats per minute, respirations 22 breaths per minute, and
temperature 38.9°C (102.1°F). Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdominal examination
reveals a diffusely tender lower abdomen, greater on the right than left and the
patient exhibits voluntary guarding. Examination of the pelvis reveals a greenish,
foul-smelling discharge with a red, friable-appearing cervix. Bimanual examination
reveals an exquisitely tender cervix with fullness and pain in the right adnexal area.
DNA assays for gonorrhea and Chlamydia are collected. The wet prep of the discharge shows many white blood cells (WBCs), no clue cells, no trichomonas, and
no Candida. A urine pregnancy test is negative.

ANSWERS TO CASE 24:
Acute Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Summary: An 18-year-old nulliparous adolescent woman complains of severe
abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, nausea, and vomiting. She displays
cervical motion tenderness and her right adnexa appear to have some fullness
and tenderness on examination.
• Most likely diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease.
• Next step: Transvaginal ultrasound to rule out tubo-ovarian abscess, complete
blood count (CBC), and screen for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
• Next treatment step: Admit the patient and start IV antibiotic therapy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the diagnosis and workup of pelvic inflammatory disease.
2. Describe the lack of clinical signs of tubo-ovarian abscess.
3. Know the criteria and treatments for both outpatient and inpatient pelvic inflammatory disease.
4. Know the common differential diagnoses for lower abdominal pain and be able to
consult the appropriate specialties based on the physical examination and laboratory studies.

Considerations
This nulliparous adolescent woman has lower abdominal pain, fever, abnormal
vaginal discharge, adnexal tenderness/fullness, and cervical motion tenderness.
Although these symptoms may occur with other diagnoses such as appendicitis,
ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, or inflammatory bowel disease, the clinical symptoms are most consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is defined as
an ascending infection from the vagina or cervix to the upper genital tract, such
as the endometrium, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. Although the etiology may be polymicrobial, sexually transmitted organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are implicated in many cases. Because the disease may mimic
other common conditions, meticulous physical examination, clinical examination,
and use of transvaginal ultrasound must be performed in conjunction to correctly
diagnose a gynecologic disease from that of a general surgery process. This patient
is admitted to the hospital due to inability to tolerate oral medication (nausea and
vomiting) and also height of the temperature (37.8°C [102°F]).

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

261

APPROACH TO:
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
DEFINITIONS
CERVICAL MOTION TENDERNESS: Also referred to as a “chandelier sign.”
Motion of the cervix during bimanual examination elicits extreme tenderness, so as
to cause the patient to jump off the bed and hit the chandelier.
PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE (PID): An ascending infection of microorganisms from the lower genital tract to the upper genital tract that is polymicrobial, but is commonly caused by N gonorrhoeae or C trachomatis. PID may also be
termed salpingitis.
TUBO-OVARIAN ABSCESS (TOA): A collection of purulent material encompassing the fallopian tube and ovary comprised of predominantly anaerobic organisms. TOAs are an important complication of pelvic inflammatory disease.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pelvic inflammatory disease is an ascending infection from the lower genital tract
to the upper genital tract that may be difficult to diagnose due to the variety and
severity of presenting symptoms. Risk factors for the development of PID are young
age, recent menstruation, multiple sexual partners, no use of barrier contraception,
and lower socioeconomic status. The clinical diagnosis of PID is fairly accurate but
a broad differential diagnosis should be kept in mind in the evaluation of abdominal pain in a woman. Criteria for diagnosis include lower abdominal tenderness,
adnexal tenderness, and cervical motion tenderness. The presence of purulent
vaginal discharge, fever more than 101°F, elevated serum leukocyte count, and presence of gonorrhea or Chlamydia in the endocervix are supportive findings. Thus, all
women who are suspected of having PID should have testing for N gonorrhoeae and
C trachomatis as well as HIV.
The clinical presentation of tubo-ovarian abscess can be subtle. The majority of
these patients have little or low-grade fever, slightly elevated white blood cell count,
and may not have a palpable adnexal mass on pelvic examination. For this reason,
those patients who are diagnosed with PID should have imaging of the pelvis to
assess for TOA, since this diagnosis requires in-patient therapy.
Ultrasound imaging or computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and
pelvis may be helpful to assess for other conditions. The differential diagnosis of
acute PID includes appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian torsion,
hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst, benign ovarian tumor, and inflammatory bowel
disease. CT imaging is more helpful in assessing appendicitis. Finally, laparoscopy is
considered the “gold standard” in establishing the diagnosis, by visualizing purulent
discharge from the tube, and is generally considered when a patient has acute symptoms, sepsis, or is not improving on therapy.
The etiology of PID is polymicrobial as many different bacteria are harbored in
the vagina. Most commonly, N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis are isolated from a

262

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

cervical culture, but other organisms, such as Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococci sp, Haemophilus influenzae, and aerobic streptococci, have been isolated
from acute cases of PID. Thus, organisms may be classified as either sexually transmitted organisms or endogenous.
The pathogenesis of PID may include many mechanisms. First, for ascension of
infection to develop from the vagina, through the cervical canal, to the endometrium of the uterus, through the fallopian tubes and to the ovaries or peritoneum,
there must be a breakdown of the natural host defense system. For instance, hormonal changes unique to a woman’s cycle may play a role in the ascending infection. During a normal menstrual cycle, the cervical mucus changes based on the
predominate hormone, either estrogen or progesterone. At midcycle, when estrogen predominates and progesterone is low, cervical mucus is thin and may facilitate easy ascension of bacteria. Whereas after ovulation, when progesterone is low,
the cervical mucous is thick and more difficult for bacteria to penetrate. For this
reason, progestin-containing contraception via the oral contraceptive or depot
medroxyprogesterone acetate (depo provera) decreases the incidence of PID. Menses is another time when woman are at greater risk for developing PID because the
cervical mucous plug is lost due to outward menstrual flow and organisms may also
ascend to the upper genital tract. Retrograde menstrual flow has also been attributed
to the risk of bacteria ascending from the uterus into the fallopian tubes, ovaries, or
peritoneal cavity.
Treatment of PID varies widely depending on the clinical presentation of the
patient. Treatment should provide broad-spectrum coverage of the suspected pathogens, and should be initiated as soon as a presumptive diagnosis has been made in
order to prevent long-term sequelae or complications from acute PID, such as tubal
damage leading to infertility, chronic pain, or ectopic pregnancies. Of note, postinfectious tubal infertility is the second most common reason for female infertility
in the United States.
Uncomplicated PID in a compliant patient may be treated as an outpatient.
However, certain criteria for hospitalization exist for the management of complicated PID (Table 24–1). Although IV antibiotics are used to treat the symptoms of
PID, laparoscopy is useful in cases with an uncertain diagnosis, suspicion of a ruptured TOA, or when a patient fails to respond to IV antibiotics. A ruptured TOA

presents as shock, and is a surgical emergency. Thus, the patient who is brought
into the emergency department with hypotension, significant abdominal pain, and
a signs of infection should receive fluid resuscitation and arrangements for rapid
surgical management.
Treatment options can be divided into oral treatment and parenteral treatment. Fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea has rendered quinolone therapy as a
secondary regimen. Outpatient management includes intramuscular ceftriaxone
and oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 14 days with or without metronidazole (Table 24–2). Patients should ideally be seen back in 48 hours to assess for
improvement. A common inpatient management is intravenous cefotetan 2 g every
12 hours and oral or IV doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours. Improvement should
occur after 24 to 48 hours of therapy. When a tubo-ovarian abscess is suspected,
clindamycin or metronidazole is used in the place of doxycycline since anaerobic
bacteria are the main concern. TOAs are an exception to the rule that “abscesses
require drainage”—the majority of TOAs can be treated with antibiotic therapy
and followed with imaging for resolution. Approximately one-third of TOAs will
need surgical therapy.
After clinical improvement on intravenous therapy, the patient is changed to
oral antibiotic therapy for 10 days. If there is no improvement after 72 hours of
therapy (decreased fever, improvement in abdominal pain, reduction in uterine/
adnexal tenderness), a more in-depth workup is needed. Follow-up and treatment of a known sexual partner is essential for decreasing the incidence of
recurrence of PID. Known complications are infertility, pelvic adhesions leading
to chronic pelvic pain, risk of ectopic surgery, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome,
and chronic PID.

24.3 A 21-year-old woman experiences crampy abdominal pain that begins near the
umbilicus and moves to the lower right quadrant. The pain has progressed over
days, and is intermittent and crampy. The patient is afebrile and complains of
some nausea.
24.4 A 41-year-old woman complains of pain in the upper abdomen especially after
eating. The pain seems to travel to her right shoulder. She has bloating at
times.
24.5 A 35-year-old man complains of epigastric abdominal pain which seems to
“bore straight to the back.” He has nausea and vomiting.
24.6 A 22-year-old woman complains of intermittent severe abdominal pain with
diarrhea. She also has some joint pain.

ANSWERS
24.1 C. Although cervical motional tenderness is not specific for acute salpingitis,
and can be seen with other acute inflammatory conditions of the lower
abdomen such as diverticulitis and appendicitis, it is a classic finding of pelvic
inflammatory disease.
24.2. D. Imaging is the best way to assess for TOA. Tubo-ovarian abscess is often
subtle in its presentation and may not be associated with fever or elevated
WBC. Most TOAs can be treated medically with antibiotics rather than
requiring surgical therapy.
24.3 G. The intermittent crampy abdominal pain is classic for ovarian torsion.
Although this patient’s pain moves from the umbilicus to the lower quadrant
area, it has lasted longer than 24 hours, without fever.
24.4 E. The right upper quadrant abdominal pain following meals (especially fatty
meals) is very typical of cholelithiasis. The pain often radiates to the right
scapula. If she had fever, cholecystitis would be suspected.
24.5 F. Pancreatitis usually presents with midepigastric pain that penetrates straight
to the back, is constant in nature, and is associated with nausea and vomiting.
Common etiologies include alcohol abuse and gall stones.
24.6 D. Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis) often
affects individuals in their teens or twenties, with abdominal pain, diarrhea
(often bloody), and extraintestinal manifestations such as joint pain or eye
findings.

Disseminated gonococcal infection, although uncommon, is a serious
complication of untreated gonorrhea, which is a very common infection.

Persons found to have a positive gonorrhea culture should also be treated
for Chlamydia because concomitant infection is found in as many as 40%
of patients. In any person presenting with asymmetric polyarthritis, tenosynovitis, and pustular skin lesions, disseminated gonococcal infection
should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

A 27-year-old woman notice that since 1 day ago, she has noticed that her mouth
has been drooping in the right corner, and it is difficult for her to drink water
without drooling. She cannot close her right eye completely, and her right eye is
red and irritated. She denies having headaches, visual disturbances, nausea, or
vomiting. She does not have any history of trauma. Her past medical history is
unremarkable. She is not taking any medications. Her mother had a stroke when
she was 60 years old. The patient states that she is from Michigan and has not
been traveling recently. On physical examination, the right corner of her mouth
droops, and the right nasolabial fold is absent. The right lower eyelid is sagging,
and the patient cannot completely close her right eye. On attempts to close the
right eye, the eye rolls upward. The patient also cannot wrinkle her forehead. The
other cranial nerves seem to be normal, and the neurologic examination reveals
no deficits other than as stated.

ANSWERS TO CASE 25:
Bell Palsy (Idiopathic Facial Paralysis)
Summary: A 27-year-old woman has acute onset of right facial weakness and right
eye irritation. She denies trauma and has no other cranial nerve or neurological
problems.
• Most Likely Diagnosis: Facial nerve palsy most likely idiopathic (Bell palsy)
• Management of condition: Protection of the eye and a course of prednisone

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Differentiate an upper motor neuron process from a lower motor neuron process
and review the differential diagnoses for each.
2. Understand the clinical presentation of Bell palsy.
3. Learn the management of Bell palsy.

Considerations
This 27-year-old woman is affected by the abrupt onset of right facial weakness.
Notably, her upper facial muscles are affected, which is consistent with a peripheral
neuropathy. She has none of the findings suggestive of a more complicated process
(Table 25–1). Her symptoms are likely caused by paralysis of the seventh cranial
nerve, which is mainly a motor nerve supplying all the ipsilateral muscles of facial
expression. The drooping of the right corner of the mouth represents paralysis of the
orbicularis oris muscle. Tearing of the right eye (epiphora) occurs because paralysis
of the orbicularis oculi muscle prevents closure of the eyelids and causes the lacrimal
duct opening to sag away from the conjunctiva. The inability to wrinkle the forehead is a result of paralysis of the frontalis muscle. Affected individuals will often
have the Bell phenomenon upon attempted closure of the eyelids, the eye on the
paralyzed side rolls upward.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO:
Facial Paralysis
Approach to Bell Palsy
The seventh cranial nerve exits the cranium through the stylomastoid foramen
and supplies all the muscles concerned with facial expression. It also has a small
sensory component which conveys taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of
the tongue and cutaneous impulses from the anterior wall of the external auditory
meatus. A complete interruption of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen
paralyzes all the muscles of the face on the affected side. Taste sensation is intact
because the lesion is beyond the site where the chorda tympani has separated from
the main trunk of the facial nerve. If the nerve to the stapedius muscle is involved,
there is often hyperacusis. If the geniculate ganglion or the motor root proximal to
it is involved, lacrimation and salivation may be reduced.
Although the most common cause of facial paralysis is Bell palsy, this is a
diagnosis of exclusion. In other words, the emergency department (ED) physician
should be careful of presuming a facial palsy is Bell palsy without considering other
possible etiologies. Other causes of nuclear or peripheral facial nerve palsy include
Lyme disease, tumors of the temporal bone (carotid body, cholesteatoma, dermoid),
Ramsey Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster of the geniculate ganglion), and acoustic
neuromas. Malignant otitis externa, stroke, Guillain-Barré disease, polio, sarcoid,
and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are other processes that must
be considered.
All forms of peripheral facial nerve palsy must be distinguished from the supranuclear type. In the latter, the frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscles are spared because
the innervation of the upper facial muscles is bilateral and that of the lower facial
muscles is mainly contralateral. In other words, if the patient has drooping of the
mouth but is able to wrinkle his or her forehead normally, an intracranial process
should be suspected. With supranuclear lesions, there may also be a dissociation
of emotional and voluntary facial movements. Because Bell palsy is a diagnosis of
exclusion, a very careful history and physical examination are critical to detect any
other neurological abnormalities.
The onset of Bell palsy is abrupt, and symptoms can progress from weakness to
complete paralysis over a week. Over half of the patients with Bell palsy will recall
a preceding viral prodrome. Associated symptoms may include pain behind the ear,
ipsilateral loss of taste sensation, decreased or overflow tearing, and hyperacusis.
The patient may complain of heaviness and numbness on the affected side of the
face; however, no sensory loss is demonstrable. Eighty percent of patients recover
within weeks to a few months. The presence of incomplete paralysis in the first week
is the most favorable prognostic sign. If the presentation is atypical or there is no
improvement at 6 months, laboratory studies, imaging studies (eg, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), or motor-nerve conduction studies should be
considered.

270

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Treatment
The patient should use an eye patch while sleeping to protect the eye and prevent
corneal drying and abrasions. While awake, he or she should apply artificial tears
to the affected eye every hour. Massaging of the weakened muscles may improve
muscle tone and aid in recovery.
Medical therapy should be started as soon as possible but can be considered
for up to 1 week after the onset of symptoms. Although treatment regimens are
controversial, most experts recommend the use of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids
are hypothesized to decrease facial nerve edema. Thus prednisone 1 mg/kg/d can
be given orally for 7 to 10 days (with or without a taper). Because some studies
implicated herpes simplex virus as a causative agent of Bell palsy, antivirals were
routinely incorporated into the treatment regimen. However, further studies have
shown conflicting results regarding the efficacy of antiviral therapy. If physicians
choose to prescribe antiviral agents, valacyclovir and famciclovir are favored due
to their less frequent dosing and greater bioavailability. These agents do cost substantially more than acyclovir, which requires more frequent dosing. If medical
therapy is unsuccessful, patients may benefit from surgical decompression of the
facial nerve.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
25.1 A 32-year-old woman complains of facial weakness for several weeks that has
gradually worsened. The upper face and lower face are both affected. She does
not have weakness of the arms or legs. Which of the following would suggest a
diagnosis other than Bell palsy?
A. Absence of symptoms in arms
B. Absence of symptoms in legs
C. Gradual onset over several weeks
D. Upper facial weakness
25.2 A 55-year-old woman complains of weakness of her right facial muscles
along with numbness of her right cheek region. Which of the following is
the next step?
A. Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.
B. Obtain a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) serology.
C. Perform a lumbar puncture.
D. Recommend eye protection and observation.

Match the following mechanisms (A to E) to the clinical scenarios presented in
Questions 25.3 to 25.5:
A. Pressure on the cerebellopontine nucleus
B. Edema of the nerve at the stylomastoid foramen
C. Immunoglobulins against the acetylcholine receptor
D. Multifocal myelin destruction in the central nervous system
E. Autoimmune attack on myelinated motor nerves particularly of the lower
extremities
25.3 A 22-year-old woman is on the ventilator because of inability to breathe. This
condition began 3 weeks ago when she had weakness of both legs following a
bout of gastroenteritis. Her deep tendon reflexes are absent.
25.4 A 32-year-old woman has a 5-year history of progressive weakness during the
day. She cannot look upward for long periods of time because of fatigue.
25.5 A 35-year-old man had eye weakness 2 years ago with full resolution. Now he
has difficulty with his right handgrip. His deep tendon reflexes are normal to
increased.

ANSWERS
25.1 C. The onset of Bell palsy is abrupt with maximum weakness occurring within
1 week. Facial nerve palsy due to tumors of the temporal bone is insidious, and
the symptoms gradually progress.
25.2 A. The numbness over the cheek is concerning and inconsistent with Bell
palsy. The facial nerve supplies all the muscles of the face. Injury to this nerve
produces paralysis of the facial muscles. Drooping of the corner of the mouth
is one of the findings. The tongue is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve. Middle ear lesions producing facial palsy will cause loss of taste over the anterior
two-thirds of the tongue, but alteration of taste sensation does not occur. The
sensory component of the facial nerve is limited to the anterior wall of the
external auditory meatus. Further evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be warranted.
25.3 E. This presentation of ascending paralysis is classic for Guillain-Barré
syndrome, and typically the deep tendon reflexes are absent.
25.4 C. Myasthenia gravis is characterized by progressive weakness throughout the
day, particularly involving the eye muscles. These symptoms are due to immunoglobulin G antibodies against the acetylcholine receptors.
25.5 D. Multiple sclerosis typically affects young individuals with waxing and
waning weakness and full recovery between exacerbations. The mechanism
is multifocal destruction of the myelin in the central nervous system.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Bell palsy is an idiopathic seventh cranial nerve peripheral neuropathy,
leading to both upper and lower facial weakness.



The diagnosis of Bell palsy is one of exclusion.



The most important assessment in a patient who presents with possible
Bell palsy is to rule out serious disorders such as intracranial tumors and
strokes.



Protection of the eye to prevent corneal drying and abrasions is accomplished with an eye patch during sleep and lubricants to the affected eye.

The prognosis of Bell palsy is usually favorable, but persistent weakness,
the appearance of other neurologic deficits, or blisters that appear on the
ear are indications for referral.

CASE 26
A 26-year-old woman presents to the emergency department (ED) with a 6-hour
history of worsening abdominal pain. She states the pain initially was a dull pain
near her umbilicus but has since moved to her lower right side. She rates the
pain as 8 on a scale of 10 and crampy in nature. The patient states that she noted
some vaginal spotting this morning, but denies any passage of clots or tissue. The
patient ate breakfast that morning, but states she has not eaten since because
she feels nauseous. She denies any fever or chills or any change in her bowel
habits. Upon further questioning, the patient states her last menstrual period
was 2 months ago, but her periods are irregular. She also states that she was told
that she had a vaginal infection a year ago but does not recall having been treated
for the illness. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 120/76 mm Hg,
heart rate is 105 beats per minute, and she is afebrile. In general, she is in mild
distress. The abdomen reveals tenderness to palpation in her right lower quadrant
that is greater than that in the left lower quadrant. The examination reveals some
minimal voluntary guarding, but no rebound tenderness is appreciated. On pelvic
examination, the uterus appears mildly enlarged without cervical motion tenderness. There are no masses or tenderness in the adnexal region. Her complete
blood count (CBC) reveals a mildly elevated white blood cell count with a left shift.
A beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) was 4658 mIU/mL. A transvaginal
sonogram reveals an empty uterus but no adnexal masses or free fluid is noted.

ANSWERS TO CASE 26:
Ectopic Pregnancy
Summary: A 26-year-old woman complains of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and
vaginal spotting. She has a positive pregnancy test, a quantitative β-hCG level of
4658 mIU/mL, and a transvaginal sonogram showing no intrauterine pregnancy.
• Most likely diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy.
• Next step: Diagnostic versus operative laparoscopy.
• Initial treatment: Establish an IV line and stabilize the patient in preparation
for surgery.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the diagnosis and workup of ectopic pregnancy.
2. Know the different sonographic appearances of ectopic pregnancy.
3. Know the common differential diagnoses for lower abdominal pain and be able to
consult the appropriate specialties based on the physical examination.

Considerations
This patient presents to the emergency department with complaints of vaginal
bleeding, abdominal pain, and a positive pregnancy examination. Her quantitative
hCG level is above the threshold of 1200 to 1500 mIU/mL, and no intrauterine
pregnancy is seen on transvaginal sonography; thus, her risk for an ectopic pregnancy approaches 85%. Other diagnoses should be considered, such as threatened
abortion, incomplete abortion, pelvic inflammatory disease, or appendicitis. Ectopic
pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy that develops after implantation of the blastocyst anywhere other than in the lining of the uterine cavity.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

275

APPROACH TO:
Ectopic Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
ECTOPIC PREGNANCY: Pregnancy that develops after implantation anywhere
other than the lining of the uterus.
RUPTURED ECTOPIC PREGNANCY: Ectopic pregnancy that has eroded
through the tissue in which it has implanted, producing hemorrhage from exposed
vessels.
SALPINGECTOMY: Surgical excision and removal of the oviduct and ectopic
pregnancy.
SALPINGOSTOMY: Surgical excision of the ectopic pregnancy with preservation
of the tube. The tube remains opened to heal by secondary intention.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Ectopic pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy outside the lining of the uterus,
most commonly occurring in the oviduct, but it may also be found in the abdomen, ovary, or cervix. The incidence of the ectopic pregnancy has increased in the
United States for three reasons: (1) the increased incidence of salpingitis caused by
increased infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or other sexually transmitted diseases, (2) improved diagnostic techniques, and (3) the increase in assisted reproductive technology pregnancies. Other risk factors include prior tubal surgery, previous
ectopic pregnancy, use of exogenous progesterone, and a history of infertility agents.
The most common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain, absence of menses,
and irregular vaginal bleeding. Other symptoms found on physical examination may
include a palpable adnexal tenderness, uterine enlargement, tachycardia, hypotension, syncope, peritoneal signs, and fever.
Approximately half of the episodes of ectopic pregnancy are linked to previous salpingitis, although these episodes may be asymptomatic. Prior infections
are likely to lead to anatomic tubal pathology that prevents the normal passage of
an embryo into the uterus. In the remaining incidences of ectopic pregnancy, an
identifying factor cannot be determined and may be linked to a physiologic disorder. Increased levels of estrogen and progesterone interfere with tubal motility and
increase the chance of ectopic pregnancy.
Approximately 97% of ectopic pregnancies occur in the oviduct, specifically in
the ampullary region. The remainder of ectopic pregnancies implant in the abdomen, cervix, or ovary. Pathogenesis of ectopic pregnancy begins as the embryo
invades the lumen of the tube and its peritoneal covering. As the embryo continues to grow, surrounding vessels may bleed into the peritoneal cavity, resulting in a
hemoperitoneum. The stretching of the tube results in abdominal pain until necrosis ensues and results in rupture of the ectopic pregnancy.
The differential diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy includes many other gynecologic and surgical illnesses. Most common are salpingitis, threatened or incomplete

276

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

abortion, ruptured corpus luteum, adnexal torsion, and appendicitis. The diagnosis
of ectopic pregnancy must be considered in any woman of reproductive age with
abnormal vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain.
Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy may be aided with the use of transvaginal ultrasound. Visualization of the pelvic organs may reveal the absence of an intrauterine
pregnancy, the presence of a complex adnexal mass, or the presence of an embryo in
the adnexa. It is important to note that with higher resolution ultrasound, the hCG
discriminatory zone is closer to 1200 to 1500 mIU/mL than the traditionally
quoted figure of 1500 to 2000 mIU/mL, in which an intrauterine pregnancy is
almost always seen on transvaginal sonography. Lack of visualization of an intrauterine gestational sac on transvaginal sonography confers up to an 85% risk of an
ectopic pregnancy. At times, sonography can visualize an ectopic pregnancy even
with hCG levels lower than this threshold; the level of hCG does not reliably correlate with the size of the ectopic pregnancy. When hCG levels are lower than the
above threshold, the ED physician should rely on the clinical impression to diagnose
an ectopic pregnancy.
In a reliable and asymptomatic patient whose initial hCG level is below the
threshold, a repeat hCG level can be obtained in 48 hours. The hCG should
increase by at least 66% over 48 hours; lack of normal rise strongly implies an
abnormal pregnancy, although the test does not indicate the location of the pregnancy (ectopic or miscarriage). A definitive diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy can
most always be made by direct visualization of the pelvic organs using laparoscopy if
the diagnosis remains uncertain.
More pregnancies are associated with in vitro fertilization, which carries a higher
risk of ectopic pregnancy, and multiple gestation. Notably, in women who have IVF
pregnancies, a proven intrauterine pregnancy may not rule out ectopic pregnancy,
since these patients can have heterotopic pregnancies (concomitant intrauterine
and ectopic pregnancies).
Treatment options include both medical and surgical therapy. Medical treatment consists of using intramuscular methotrexate, a folinic acid antagonist that
interferes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively dividing tissue, such as fetal cell growth is susceptible to methotrexate and may be used for treatment of ectopic pregnancy under specific conditions
(Figure 26–1). Methotrexate is found to be more successful if the hCG is less than
5000 mIU/mL, if the fetus is smaller than 3.5 cm, and if there is no detectable fetal
cardiac activity. It is important to note that each individual patient may present
with different complaints and different levels of hCG, and at times medical management involves multiple doses of methotrexate.
Potential problems associated with medical management of ectopic pregnancy
include drug side effects and treatment failure. Some patients treated with methotrexate will develop acute abdominal pain due to the process of “tubal abortion.” In these individuals, pelvic sonography is useful- if the vital signs are stable,
and the ultrasound does not show much intra-abdominal fluid, the patient may
be observed in the hospital to assess for resolution of the pain. However, those

If medical therapy fails, surgical intervention is necessary. Surgical management
commonly consists of laparoscopy and/or laparotomy. A few common surgical techniques used for treatment of ectopic pregnancy include salpingotomy, salpingostomy, and partial salpingectomy. These techniques can be used to treat the majority
of unruptured ectopic pregnancy, whereas exploratory laparotomy may be used in
cases of ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

pain resolved. In the ED, her blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg and heart rate is
80 beats per minute. Her uterus is firm and the cervix is closed. The hCG level
is 2000 mIU/mL. Transvaginal sonography reveals no intrauterine pregnancy.
Which of the following is the next step?
A. Laparoscopy
B. Methotrexate therapy
C. Progesterone level
D. Repeat hCG level in 48 hours

ANSWERS
26.1 C. In general, any woman in the childbearing age group with abdominal pain
or abnormal vaginal bleeding should have a pregnancy test. If pregnant, then
ectopic pregnancy should be ruled out.
26.2 A. A large number of women who undergo methotrexate treatment of ectopic
pregnancy will have some abdominal discomfort. As long as there are no signs
of rupture such as hypotension, severe pain, or free fluid on ultrasound, expectant management may be practiced.
26.3 A. In vitro fertilization with embryo transfer produces a rate of coexisting
intrauterine pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy of up to 3% (markedly higher
than the spontaneous rate of 1:10,000). Thus, a woman who has undergone
in vitro fertilization who presents with abdominal fluid and hypotension must
be suspected as having an ectopic pregnancy, even when an intrauterine pregnancy has been visualized on sonography.
26.4 B. The presence of uterine cramping, vaginal bleeding, passage of tissue, and
an open cervical os in a pregnant woman is consistent with an incomplete
abortion. Uterine curettage would be the therapy.
26.5 D. This patient likely has a completed abortion with the resolution of symptoms following passage of tissue and now with a small uterus and closed cervical os. Nevertheless, there is still a possibility of ectopic pregnancy and perhaps
the “tissue” passed was only blood clot. The tissue should be sent for pathologic
analysis. Also, a repeat hCG level should be performed to ensure that all tissue
has passed. The hCG level should fall by about 50% in 48 hours if all tissue
has passed. A plateau in the hCG level may indicate incomplete abortion or
ectopic pregnancy. Dilation and curettage would generally be performed, and
if chorionic villi found the diagnosis is miscarriage; absence of chorionic villi
establishes the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy which may be treated by surgery
or methotrexate.



In any woman of childbearing age, consider pregnancy. If the pregnancy
test is positive, consider an ectopic pregnancy.



Consider pregnancy even when a woman has had a tubal ligation or is
using contraception.



When the serum quantitative hCG level is above 1500 to 2000 mIU/mL
and transvaginal ultrasound does not reveal an intrauterine pregnancy,
the risk of ectopic pregnancy is high.



Surgery, not methotrexate, is the best treatment for the patient who is
hemodynamically unstable or with significant abdominal pain.



Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for ectopic pregnancy.

CASE 27
A 25-year-old G1P0 woman at 11 weeks’ gestation is noted to be lethargic by her
husband. The patient was noted to have numerous episodes of nausea and vomiting over the past 1 1/2 months, which has persisted despite antiemetic therapy
and adjustments in her diet. The patient had been admitted to the hospital
2 weeks ago due to emesis. She was brought in by EMS when her husband arrived
after work to find her unarousable. On examination, the patient is lethargic but will
respond to painful stimuli and open her eyes. Her blood pressure is 92/44 mm Hg
and heart rate 130 beats per minute. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute. O2
saturation is 99% on room air. The patient’s mucous membranes are dry. She
otherwise has a normal examination. The fetal heart tones are 150 beats per minute.
The urinalysis shows a dipstick of specific gravity 1.027 and 3+ ketones.

ANSWERS TO CASE 27:
Hyperemesis Gravidarum and OB Emergencies Less than
26 Weeks’ Gestation
Summary: A 25-year-old G1P0 woman at 11 weeks’ gestation has a 6-week history
of persistent emesis. She is found to be lethargic and noted to be hypovolemic with
blood pressure of 92/44 mm Hg and heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute. The fetal heart tones are 150 beats per minute.
The urinalysis shows a dipstick of specific gravity 1.027 and 3+ ketones.
• Most likely diagnosis: Hyperemsis gravidarum, severe
• Next step in management: Immediate isotonic fluid replacement, and also
assess for electrolyte abnormalities and correction of these problems
• Differential diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis, molar pregnancy or twin pregnancy,
peptic ulcer disease, hyperthyroidism, and cholelithiasis

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the common complications in pregnant women less than 26 weeks’ gestation.
2. Understand the diagnostic strategy and management of those complications.
3. Know the physiologic changes in pregnancy and their impact on common diseases in pregnancy.

Considerations
This patient described in the scenario above is significantly ill and needs aggressive fluid replacement, electrolyte replacement, and correction of metabolic abnormalities. Replacement with 2 L of normal saline quickly is warranted. Assessment
of comprehensive metabolic panel, electrolytes, amylase, lipase, urinalysis for leukocytes, calcium, magnesium, and CBC with differential should be performed. She has
complicated hyperemesis gravidarum, and needs a diagnostic workup such as pelvic
ultrasound if not previously performed, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and thyroid
function tests. The patient should be admitted to the hospital. Antiemetic therapy,
and fluid replacement and nothing by mouth should be initiated. The patient should
be followed carefully once discharged to ensure that she doesn’t become so volume
depleted.

APPROACH TO:
Medical Complications in Pregnancies Before 26 Weeks
INTRODUCTION
There are numerous emergencies or urgencies that bring a pregnant woman into the
emergency department. For this chapter, the discussion will be focused on: hyperemesis gravidarum, spontaneous abortion, asthma exacerbation, hyperthyroidism/
thyroid storm, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and pyelonephritis.

Hyperemesis Gravidarum
Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is very common, affecting up to 75% of pregnant
women. However, hyperemesis gravidarum, which is defined as intractable emesis
with volume depletion and metabolic/electrolyte alterations is less common, with
prevalence of about 2% of pregnancies. Typically it occurs in women in the first trimester, and is diagnosis of exclusion. The emergency physician should not be lulled
into complacency because nausea and vomiting is so common in pregnant women.
The evaluation should include addressing the degree of volume depletion and
exploring the possibility of metabolic issues such as electrolyte abnormalities, renal
or liver function abnormalities, and the possibility of other etiologies. A urinalysis
should also be performed. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a diagnosis of exclusion.
Pregnant women are typically young and healthy, and significant hypovolemia
with compensation without appearing ill. A careful history should be taken regarding the amount of oral intake, medications taken if any, and the presence of other
possible causes of emesis. The differential diagnosis includes pancreatitis, gall stones,
peptic ulcer disease, appendicitis, ovarian torsion, pyelonephritis, and gastroenteritis.
Additionally, high hCG level as associated with molar pregnancies or multiple
gestation is seen with hyperemesis. Thus an ultrasound should be performed to assess
for adnexal masses and to define the type of pregnancy.
Treatment depends on the severity of the patient’s condition. Patients with mild
volume depletion can be given IV hydration or a trial of oral fluids, and prescribed
antiemetic medications. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) has efficacy as a first-line agent.
Ondansetron (Zofran), while pregnancy Class B, has become the most common parenteral and oral antiemetic used in US emergency departments due to its efficacy,
and it has become the first choice in hyperemesis in the last several years. As an
adjunctive agent, corticosteroids have also been used. For patients who have failed
outpatient therapy, or who have moderate to severe volume depletion should be
hospitalized for more intensive therapy and monitoring. Rarely, patients will be so
severely affected that total parenteral nutrition is required.

Spontaneous Abortion
Patients who present with vaginal bleeding during pregnancy are said to have a
threatened abortion. In this circumstance, approximately 10% of cases will involve
ectopic pregnancy (see Case 26), 40% will result in a spontaneous abortion, and
50% will result in a normal pregnancy carried to term. When the patient presents

284

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

to the emergency department, a careful history and physical examination should be
performed including assessing for cramping, passage of tissue, risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, and hemodynamic alterations. The physical examination should be
focused on assessing volume status, abdominal tenderness, pelvic examination for
the state of the cervix, and the presence of adnexal masses or tenderness. The hCG
level and transvaginal ultrasound usually help to determine the type of pregnancy.
For instance, if the hCG level is above the threshold of 1500 mIU/mL and nothing
is seen in the uterus indicating an intrauterine pregnancy, in the absence of history
indicative of tissue passing, this is consistent with an ectopic pregnancy. Women
with threatened abortion should be instructed to bring in any passed tissue for histologic analysis.
An inevitable abortion must be differentiated from an incompetent cervix.
With an inevitable abortion, the uterine contractions (cramping) lead to the cervical dilation. With an incompetent cervix, the cervix opens spontaneously without
uterine contractions and, therefore, affected women present with painless cervical
dilation. This disorder is treated with a surgical ligature at the level of the internal
cervical os (cerclage). Hence, one of the main features used to distinguish between
an incompetent cervix and an inevitable abortion is the presence or absence of
uterine contractions.
The treatment of an incomplete abortion, characterized by the passage of tissue
and an open cervical os, is dilatation and curettage of the uterus. The primary complications of persistently retained tissue are bleeding and infection. A completed
abortion is suspected by the history of having passed tissue and experiencing cramping abdominal pain, now resolved. The cervix is closed. Serum hCG levels are still
followed to confirm that no further chorionic villi are contained in the uterus.

Asthma Exacerbation
Asthma is one of the most common medical conditions complicating pregnancy,
with an incidence of 4% to 9%. The clinical course of asthma in pregnancy is relatively unpredictable; however, there is evidence to suggest that worsening of asthma
may be related to baseline asthma severity. Approximately one-third of pregnant
asthmatics experience worsening of symptoms while one-third improve and onethird remain the same. Exacerbations are more common in the second and third
trimester and are less frequent in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy. Asthma typically
follows a similar clinical course with successive pregnancies. As such, this patient
would be expected to do relatively well given that her symptoms were well controlled prior to this pregnancy and in previous pregnancies.
Asthma symptoms correlate poorly with objective measures of pulmonary function. Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform an
objective measure of airway obstruction. The single best measure is the forced expiratory volume (FEV1), which is the volume of gas exhaled in 1 second by a forced
exhalation after a full inspiration. This value, however, can only be obtained by
spirometry, thus limiting its clinical use. The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)
correlates well with FEV1 and can be measured with inexpensive, disposable portable peak flow meters. Both the FEV1 and PEFR remain unchanged throughout
pregnancy and may be used as measures of asthma control and severity.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

285

Treatment of an acute exacerbation during pregnancy is similar to that of nonpregnant asthmatics. In other words, a rule of thumb is that pregnant women should
be treated similarly to nonpregnant asthmatics. Patients should be taught how to
recognize the signs and symptoms of early exacerbations so that they may begin
treatment at home promptly. Initial treatment consists of a short-acting inhaled
beta-2-agonist (albuterol), up to three treatments of 2 to 4 puffs by MDI (metereddose inhaler) at 20 minute intervals for up to three treatments, or single nebulizer
treatment for up to 1 hour. A good response is characterized by PEFR greater than
80% of personal best and resolution of symptoms sustained for 4 hours. Patients
may be continued on beta-2-agonists every 3 to 4 hours for 24 to 48 hours. Inhaled
corticosteroids (ICS) should be initiated or if already taking ICS, the dose should
be doubled. Follow-up appointment with their physician should be made as soon
as possible. Inadequate response to initial therapy (PEFR <80%) or decreased fetal
activity warrants immediate medical attention.
Prevention of hypoxia is the ultimate goal for the pregnant woman who presents to the hospital during an acute asthma attack. Initial assessment should
include a brief history and physical examination to assess the severity of asthma and
possible trigger factors such as a respiratory infection. Patients with imminent respiratory arrest include those who are drowsy or confused, have paradoxical thoracoabdominal movement, bradycardia, pulsus paradoxus, and decreased air movement
(no wheezing). Intubation and mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen should be
performed in these circumstances and the patient should be admitted to the intensive care unit. Because of the changes in the respiratory physiology in pregnancy (ie,
a respiratory alkylosis with partially metabolic compensation), different thresholds
for action exist (Table 27–1). A PaCO2 greater than 35 mm Hg, with a pH less than
7.35 in the presence of a falling PaO2 is a sign of impending respiratory failure in a
pregnant asthmatic. Intubation is warranted when the PaCO2 is 45 mm Hg or more
and rising.

Premature Rupture of Membranes
Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is defined as the ROM prior to the onset of
labor. Preterm PROM (PPROM) is the ROM that occurs prior to 37 completed weeks.
Approximately 3% of all pregnancies are complicated by PPROM and is the underlying etiology of one-third of preterm births. Normal fetal membranes are biologically
very strong in preterm pregnancies. The weakening mechanism is likely multifactorial. Studies have shown PPROM to be associated with intrinsic (intrauterine stretch/
strain from polyhydramnios and multifetal pregnancies, cervical incompetence) and

extrinsic factors (ascending bacterial infections). There is evidence demonstrating an
association between ascending infection from the lower genital tract and PPROM.
This section will be restricted to gestational age less than 26 weeks.
PPROM is associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.
The time from rupture of membranes to delivery is known as “latency.” The latency
period is inversely proportional to the gestational age at PPROM. Latency period
of 1 week or less is present in 50% to 60% of PPROM patients. During this period
amnionitis occurs in 13% to 60%, and abruptio placentae occurs in 4% to 12%.
Maternal and fetal complications decrease with increasing gestational age at the
time of PPROM. Multiple complications have been associated with PPROM.
The primary maternal morbidity is chorioamnionitis. Incidence varies with
population and gestational age at PPROM, with reported frequency from 15% to
40%. Chorioamnionitis typically precedes fetal infection but this is not always the
case, and therefore close clinical monitoring is required. Fetal morbidity and mortality varies with gestational age and complications, particularly infection. The most
common complication is respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Other serious fetal
complications include necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and
sepsis. The three causes of neonatal death associated with PPROM are prematurity,
sepsis, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Preterm infants born with sepsis have a mortality
rate four times higher than those without sepsis.
Management of PPROM starts with initial evaluation and diagnosis of rupture
of membranes. The primary patient complaint is experiencing a “gush” of fluid but
some patients will report persistent leakage of fluid. This patient history of rupture
of membranes is accurate in 90% of cases. Diagnosis is established on sterile speculum evaluation. Confirmatory findings include pooling of amniotic fluid in posterior
fornix and/or leakage of fluid on Valsalva; positive nitrazine test of fluid (vaginal pH
4.5-6.0, amniotic fluid pH 7.1-7.3, nitrazine turns dark blue above 6.0-6.5); amniotic fluid ferning on microscopy. Should the initial tests be ambiguous or negative, in
the face of continued clinical suspicion other diagnostic modalities can be utilized.
The ultrasound finding of oligohydramnios is usually confirmatory.
At the time of the initial evaluation, the patient’s cervical os should be visually assessed for dilatation and possible prolapse of umbilical cord or fetal limb. In
general, a digital examination of the cervix should be avoided since bacterial may
be theoretically inoculated with an examination. Ultrasound evaluation of the gestational age, fetal weight, fetal presentation, placental location, and assessment of
amniotic fluid index (AFI) are vital for treatment planning. A low AFI (<5.0 cm)
and low maximum vertical fluid pocket (<2.0 cm) at the time of initial assessment is
associated with shorter latency, increased RDS, and increased composite morbidity.

Management
Patients diagnosed with PPROM would benefit from an admission to the hospital
in all likelihood until delivery. Once PPROM is verified, the treatment plan must
balance the maternal, fetal, neonatal risks/benefits of prolonged pregnancy or expeditious delivery and possible inclusion of medical intervention. For those gestations
that are previable, observation in the hospital or careful follow-up with an obstetrician is advisable.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

287

In the absence of clinical signs of labor, abruption, or maternal or fetal signs of
infection most patients in this gestational age will benefit from an expectant management with daily assessment of the maternal and fetal well-being.
Maternal and fetal assessment
1. Maternal: The criteria for the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis include
maternal pyrexia, tachycardia, leukocytosis, uterine tenderness, malodorous vaginal discharge, and fetal tachycardia. During inpatient observation, the woman
should be regularly examined for such signs of intrauterine infection and an
abnormal parameter or a combination of them may indicate intrauterine infection. The frequency of maternal and fetal assessments (temperature, pulse, and
fetal heart rate auscultation) should be between 4 and 8 hours.
2. Fetal: Electronic fetal heart rate tracing is useful when the gestation is considered
viable, because fetal tachycardia may represent a sign of fetal infection and is frequently used in the clinical definition of chorioamnionitis in some studies. Fetal
tachycardia is often the earliest sign of infection. However, checking intermittent fetal heart activity for previable gestation is preferable.
Use of steroids: A meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials involving more
than 1400 women with preterm rupture of the membranes demonstrated that antenatal corticosteroids reduced the risks of respiratory distress syndrome. This is generally administered at 24 weeks or beyond in the absence of clinical infection.
Use of antibiotics: The use of antibiotics following PPROM was associated with a
statistically significant reduction in chorioamnionitis. There was a significant reduction in the numbers of babies born within 48 hours and 7 days. Neonatal infection
was significantly reduced in the babies whose mothers received antibiotics.
PPROM under 23 weeks: There are insufficient data to make recommendations
in the setting of PPROM under 23 to 24 weeks including the possibility of home,
day-care, and outpatient monitoring. It would be considered reasonable to maintain
the woman in hospital for at least 48 hours before a decision is made to allow her to
go home. The management of these cases should be individualized and outpatient
monitoring restricted to certain groups of women after careful consideration of other
risk factors and the access to the hospital.

Hyperthyroidism
Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is more difficult to recognize due to the hyperdynamic physiologic changes in pregnancy. However, unintended weight loss, nervousness, palpitations, tachycardia, or tremor are clinical manifestations that bear
evaluation. The diagnosis is made clinical suspicion and thyroid function tests, such
as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels. The immediate treatment includes β-blocking agents and thioamides.
The patient who presents acutely to the emergency department should be started
on β-blockers urgently to relieve the adrenergic symptoms of tachycardia, tremor,
anxiety, and heat sensitivity by decreasing the maternal heart rate, cardiac output,
and myocardial oxygen consumption. Longer-acting agents, such as atenolol and
metoprolol 50 to 200 mg/d, are recommended. β-Blockers are contraindicated in

288

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

patients with asthma and congestive heart failure and should not be used at the time
of delivery due to possible neonatal bradycardia and hypoglycemia.
Thioamides inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by reduction of iodine organification and iodotyrosine coupling. Both propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole
have been used during pregnancy, but PTU has been traditionally preferred because
of concern regarding reduced transplacental transfer of PTU compared to methimazole. However, recent studies do not confirm this finding. Teratogenic patterns
associated with methimazole include aplasia cutis and choanal/esophageal atresia;
however, these anomalies do not occur at a higher rate in women on thioamides
compared to the general population.
Side effects of thioamides include transient leukopenia (10%); agranulocytosis
(0.1%-0.4%); thrombocytopenia, hepatitis, and vasculitis (<1%) as well as rash,
nausea, arthritis, anorexia, fever, and loss of taste or smell (5%). Agranulocytosis
usually presents with a fever and sore throat. If a CBC indicates agranulocytosis,
the medication should be discontinued. Treatment with another thioamide carries a
significant risk of cross-reaction as well.
Initiation of thioamides in a patient with a new diagnosis during pregnancy
requires a dose of PTU 100 to 150 mg three times daily or methimazole 10 to 20 mg
twice daily. Free T4 levels are used to monitor response to therapy in hyperthyroid
patients and should be checked in 4 to 6 weeks. The PTU or methimazole can be
adjusted in 50 mg or 10 mg increments, respectively, with a therapeutic range for
free T4 of 1.2 to 1.8 ng/dL. The goal of treatment is to maintain the free T4 in the
upper normal range using the lowest possible dose in order to protect the fetus from
hypothyroidism. The required dose of thioamide during pregnancy can increase
up to 50% for patients with a history of hyperthyroidism prior to conception. The
patient’s TSH should be checked at the initial prenatal visit and every trimester.
Medication adjustments, testing intervals, and therapeutic goals for the free T4 are
the same as for patients with new-onset disease.
The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, which occurs in
95% of all cases at all ages. The diagnosis of Graves disease is usually made by the
presence of elevated free T4 level or free thyroid index with a suppressed TSH in the
absence of a nodular goiter or thyroid mass. The differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, in the order of decreasing frequency, includes subacute thyroiditis, painless
(silent or postpartum) thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma (solitary
autonomous hot nodule), iodine-induced (iodinated contrast or amiodarone), iatrogenic overreplacement of thyroid hormone, factitious thyrotoxicosis, struma ovarii
(ovarian teratoma), and gestational trophoblastic disease. The general symptoms of
hyperthyroidism include palpitations, weight loss with increased appetite, nervousness, heat intolerance, oligomenorrhea, eye irritation or edema, and frequent stools.
The general signs include diffuse goiter, tachycardia, tremor, warm, moist skin,
and new-onset atrial fibrillation. Diagnosis during pregnancy is even more difficult
because the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may overlap with the hypermetabolic symptoms of pregnancy. Discrete findings with Graves disease include a
diffuse, toxic goiter (common in most young women), ophthalmopathy (periorbital
edema, proptosis, and lid retraction in only 30%), dermopathy (pretibial myxedema
in <1%), and acropachy (digital clubbing).

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

289

The pathogenesis of Graves disease is characterized by an autoimmune process
with production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs) and TSH-binding
inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBIIs) that act on the TSH receptor on the thyroid
gland to mediate thyroid stimulation or inhibition, respectively. These antibodies,
in effect, act as TSH agonists or antagonists, to stimulate or inhibit thyroid growth,
iodine trapping, and T4/T3 synthesis. Maternal Graves disease complicates 1 out
of every 500 to 1000 pregnancies. The frequency of poor outcomes depends on the
severity of maternal thyrotoxicosis with a risk of preterm delivery of 88%, stillbirth
of 50%, and risk of congestive heart failure of over 60% in untreated mothers.

Thyroid Storm
Maternal thyroid storm is a medical emergency characterized by a hypermetabolic
state in a woman with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. Thyroid storm occurs in less
than 1% of pregnancies but has a high risk of maternal heart failure. Usually, there
is an inciting event, such as infection, cesarean delivery, or labor, which leads to
acute onset of fever, tachycardia, altered mental status (restlessness, nervousness,
confusion), seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cardiac arrhythmias. Shock,
stupor, and coma can ensue without prompt intervention, which includes OB-ICU
admission, supportive measures, and acute medical management. Therapy includes
a standard series of drugs, each of which has a specific role in suppression of thyroid
function: PTU or methimazole blocks additional synthesis of thyroid hormone, and
PTU also blocks peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Saturated solutions of potassium
iodide or sodium iodide block the release of T4 and T3 from the gland. Dexamethasone decreases thyroid hormone release and peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Propranolol inhibits the adrenergic effects of excessive thyroid hormone. Phenobarbital
can reduce extreme agitation or restlessness and may increase catabolism of thyroid
hormone. Fetal surveillance is performed throughout, but intervention for fetal indications should not occur until the mother is stabilized.

Pyelonephritis
A pregnant woman is at greater risk for pyelonephritis and its complications such as
sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Most cases of pyelonephritis
in pregnancy are caused by infection with gram-negative aerobic bacteria, but an
increasing number are due to group B Streptococcus. Approximately 7% of affected
women will develop pulmonary insufficiency due to ARDS (see Figure 27–1), presumably related to release of endotoxin. For these reasons, a pregnant patient with
pyelonephritis should be admitted to the hospital. The diagnosis is established with
the classic triad of fever, costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness, and pyuria.
The patient should be placed on IV hydration, antibiotics aimed at the most
common etiology, E Coli, and monitored for complications. Bacteria and/or their
component toxins can produce a sepsis syndrome that, unchecked, will develop into
septic shock. The cornerstone of management is early diagnosis, but often that is
not easy. A program of early goal-directed therapy has been shown to reduce mortality
from septic shock. However, not all patients with septic shock require the same
treatment interventions. The woman in our case scenario, for example, requires
aggressive fluid resuscitation and transfer to an intensive care unit. Per hour 1 to 2 L

(not the 125 cc/h she was receiving) would be appropriate. The total volume needed
should be determined by monitoring central venous pressure. An arterial catheter
should be placed to monitor blood pressure and obtain timely pH and blood gas measurements. If adequate fluid resuscitation has not elevated the mean arterial pressure above 65 mm Hg, then vasopressors would be indicated. Adequate oxygenation
should be maintained, with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, if
necessary. The ceftriaxone she was receiving likely does not need to be changed, but
some authorities prefer ampicillin and gentamicin for the treatment of pyelonephritis
in pregnancy. Surgical intervention is seldom necessary for septic shock secondary
to pyelonephritis, but prolonged hypotension and ischemia can lead to gangrene of
the extremities and amputation in severe cases. When septic shock results from
necrotizing fasciitis, extensive debridement of necrotic tissue is an essential component
of management. Antibiotic therapy should include vancomycin for methicillinresistant Staphylococcus and clindamycin for Streptococcus; there is evidence that
clindamycin may directly inhibit synthesis of group A streptococcal toxins.

27.5 A 27-year-old G1P0 woman at 18 weeks’ gestation complains of significant
nausea and vomiting throughout her pregnancy, and has not been able to keep
any foods or liquids down. She has been admitted to the hospital numerous
times. Her BP is 100/60 mm Hg and heart rate 110, and urinalysis shows negative nitrates, negative leukoesterase, and ketones is 2 +/4. Which of the following statements is most accurate about this patient?

speculum examination, there is no fluid in the vagina. The fern and nitrazine
tests are negative. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient?
A. Inform the patient that she does not have rupture of membranes.
B. Hospitalize the patient and assume that she has rupture of membranes.
C. Treat with an oral antibiotic for presumed UTI.
D. Perform an ultrasound examination.

ANSWERS
27.1 D. Pregnant women with pyelonephritis should be admitted to the hospital
in general because of the complications such as sepsis, preterm labor, miscarriage, or ARDS. Endotoxin-induced pulmonary injury is a well-documented
complication of pyelophritis and occurs more commonly in pregnant women.
27.2 C. A patient who develops acute shorness of breath and hypoxemia after treatment for pyelonephritis should be assumed to have endotoxin-mediated pulmonary injury, or ARDS. A chest x-ray will usually reveal patchy bilateral
infiltrates in the lung fields. The treatment is supplemental oxygen and supportive therapy.
27.3 A. When the hCG level exceeds the threshold of 1500 and no gestational sac
is seen on TV ultrasound, the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy is high (in
the range of 85%). These patients usually go to laparoscopy to confirm the
diagnosis. When the hCG level is below the threshold, then the next step is
generally to repeat the hCG level in 48 hours to assess for a normal rise (>66%
rise) which would indicate a normal intrauterine pregnancy, versus an abnormal rise (<66%) which would be either an ectopic pregnancy or a miscarriage.

27.4 C. Thyroid storm is present with hyperthyroidism in conjunction with CNS
dysfunction (seizures, confusion, lethargy), and/or autonomic instability (fever).
Thyroid storm carries a worse prognosis and usually requires immediate
admission to the ICU and aggressive therapy consisting of PTU, β-blockers,
and steroids. A common precursor to thyroid storm is a patient who has
stopped taking medications and a stressor such as infection or surgery.
27.5 A. With hyperemesis gravidarum, the presence of moderate to significant
ketones is associated with significant volume depletion. The patient is typically
hypokalemic. The usual gestational age for hyperemesis is the first trimester,
although less commonly, women can persist later and ever rarer, throughout
the pregnancy. Vitamin B6 is a useful adjunctive treatment.
27.6 D. When the history suggests PROM, but the speculum examination is negative, ultrasound to assess for amniotic fluid volume is helpful. If oligohydramnios is diagnosed, the patient is assumed to have ROM, and should be admitted
to the hospital.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is common, so that significant
volume or metabolic derangements in these patients can be minimized.



Hyperemesis is a diagnosis of exclusion.



The physiologic changes of pregnancy should be considered when interpreting ABGs. For instance when the PCO2 exceeds 40 mm Hg in a pregnant asthmatic, severe hypercarbia is present and intubation should be
considered.



Dyspnea and hypoxemia after treatment for pyelonephritis is usually
caused by endotoxin-related pulmonary injury, ARDS.



Hyperthyroidism is typically treated with methimazole or PTU, and a
β-blocker.



When the hCG level exceeds the threshold of 1200 to 1500 mIU/mL and
no gestational sac is seen in the uterus on transvaginal ultrasound, then
an ectopic pregnancy is highly likely.



The history for a gush of fluid followed by constant leakage is 90% accurate for rupture of membranes.



In there is strong clinical suspicion, and the speculum examination is
negative for ROM, an ultrasound assessment for amniotic fluid volume
is helpful.

CASE 28
A 10-week-old infant is brought to the emergency department (ED) by his mother
for 1 day of fever. The mother tells you that her son was delivered vaginally at
full term and was the product of an uncomplicated pregnancy. He has had regular
well-baby checks and has been gaining weight appropriately. He has met his
normal developmental milestones and vaccinations are up-to-date. He has had
no prior illnesses. This morning his mother noticed he felt warm to the touch
and discovered an axillary temperature of 101°F. No other signs or symptoms of
infection including runny nose, cough, difficulty breathing, rash, nuchal rigidity,
seizure activity, abdominal distension, vomiting, or diarrhea. She states her son
has been breast-feeding less than normal, but overall has had a normal number of
wet diapers. She is very concerned because this is her first child and he has never
had a fever before.
On examination, the child is found to have a heart rate of 180 beats per minute,
a blood pressure of 90/50 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, an
oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and a rectal temperature of 102.7°F. He is
overall well appearing and has an unremarkable physical examination. Although he
cries when you perform the examination, his mother is able to console him easily.

ANSWERS TO CASE 28:
Fever Without a Source in the 1- to 3-Month-Old Infant
Summary: A previously healthy 10-week-old infant is brought in by his mother for
fever The cause of the fever is not clearly identified by the history or physical examination. His vital signs in the emergency department are significant for fever and
tachycardia. His examination is unremarkable.
• Most likely diagnosis: Fever without a source (FWS).
• Next step: Order CBC, blood cultures, urinalysis, urine culture. You may also
order stool studies, a chest x-ray, and perform a lumbar puncture depending on
the clinical presentation.
• Best therapy: It is up to physician discretion to decide which well-appearing
infants with fever without a source should receive antibiotics. If antibiotics are
given, the best drug is ceftriaxone, either IV or IM.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the appropriate workup for fever without a source in the well-appearing
1- to 3-month-old infant.
2. Appreciate the controversy regarding the management of fever without a source
in this age group.
3. Learn the treatment options for fever without a source in a 1- to 3-month-old
infant.

Considerations
This 10-week-old infant presented with fever without any other signs or symptoms
of infection including runny nose, cough, difficulty breathing, rash, nuchal rigidity,
seizure activity, abdominal distension, vomiting, or diarrhea. Importantly, the emergency physician must be aware that the 1- to 3-month-old infant will not manifest
the same signs of infection as an older child. For this reason, the workup of fever in
this age group must remain broad and one must have a low threshold for both further
testing and treatment with antibiotics.

APPROACH TO:
Fever Without a Source in the 1- to 3-Month-Old Infant
DEFINITIONS
FEVER WITHOUT A SOURCE: Fever without a source is an acute febrile illness
in which the etiology of the fever is not apparent after a careful history and physical
examination. A rectal temperature greater than 38°C (100.4°F) is defined as a fever.
SERIOUS BACTERIAL ILLNESS (SBI): Illnesses including bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, skin and soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections, enteritis, or meningitis due to a bacterial pathogen.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Diagnosis of Potential Fever in the 1- to 3-Month-Old Infant
While many parents will bring in their infants for a chief complaint of fever, not
all parents will have actually taken their child’s temperature with a thermometer. If
an infant has had a rectal temperature more than 38°C at home but is afebrile and
well appearing in the emergency department, this infant still requires full workup
for fever. If the parent only reports a tactile fever and the infant is afebrile and well
appearing in the emergency department, no laboratory testing for fever workup is
required. Temperature must be measured with a rectal thermometer in order to rule
out a fever. Axillary and tympanic membrane thermometers are not adequate to
evaluate for fever in an infant. If an infant is brought in bundled and has a mildly
elevated temperature, it is worthwhile to recheck a rectal temperature 15 minutes
after unbundling the infant. However, a temperature more than 38.5°C should
never be attributed to bundling.

Evaluation of Fever Without a Source in the 1- to 3-Month-Old Infant
The evaluation of fever in this age group has changed dramatically in the last
30 years in the wake of vaccines targeting haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These vaccines have dramatically decreased the burden of SBI
in this age group. Prior to the development of these vaccines, the majority of febrile
infants in this age group were hospitalized and often started on empiric antibiotic
therapy. Morbidity and mortality for SBI was high and early clinical identification
was very difficult.
Given the controversy and difficulties identifying infants with SBI several decision rules have been developed. These are the Rochester, Boston, and Philadelphia
criteria, each using a combination of factors including history, physical examination, and laboratory parameters to identify low-risk infants. Although all these criteria use slightly different testing strategies, all of the criteria support the use of
CBC, blood cultures, urinalysis, and urine culture to identify infants at low risk for
SBI. Test results suggestive of high risk for SBI include WBC greater than or equal
to 15,000/mm3 or less than or equal to 5000/mm3, a band-to-neutrophil ratio of
greater than or equal to 0.2, a urine dipstick test positive for nitrite or leukocyte

298

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

esterase, or a finding of greater than or equal to 5 WBCs/hpf or organisms seen on
Gram stain.
Routinely obtaining chest x-rays and lumbar punctures in this age group are
somewhat more controversial. Although there is disagreement between the decision
rules, one meta-analysis of a combined group of 361 febrile infants found that infants
which have tachypnea >50 breaths per minute, rales, ronchi, retractions, wheezing,
coryza, grunting, stridor, nasal flaring, or cough should have a chest x-ray.
Similar to chest x-ray, routine lumbar puncture is another area of controversy
among the decision rules. Several observational studies suggest that infants can be
identified as low risk for SBI without performing a lumbar puncture. However, other
physicians feel that the significant morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial
meningitis outweighs the low incidence of the disease, and thus argue in support
of routine lumbar puncture in the workup of fever without a source. Cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) with greater than or equal to 8 WBC/mm3 or organisms on Gram stain
is considered high risk for SBI. Additionally, sending stool for WBCs and culture is
recommended for infants in this age group with diarrhea. Greater than 5 WBC/hpf
in the stool specimen is considered high risk for SBI.
While this case has focused on the well-appearing 1- to 3-month-old infant with
fever without a source, it is worthwhile to note that ill-appearing infants in this age
group have a much higher risk of SBI, and all of these infants should be treated with
empiric antibiotics and admitted to the hospital. Up to 45% of these infants will test
positive for SBI.

Pathogens
Routine vaccinations with Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) and heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) have dramatically decreased the
rates of SBI infants. After the introduction of the Hib vaccine, the majority (90%)
of infections were due to pneumococcus. The PCV7 vaccine further changed the
landscape of SBI, decreasing the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease 65%
to 80% in children younger than 3 years of age. Although much less common, other
pathogens are emerging as prominent causes of SBI in this age group, including
E Coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Furthermore, non-vaccine serotypes of S Pneumoniae are noted to be
increasingly prevalent in this age group.

Treatment
Antibiotics must be considered for all 1- to 3-month-old infants with fever without
a source. The empiric antibiotic of choice is c eftriaxone, which may be given IV or
IM. The regular dose is 50 mg/kg; however, if meningitis is suspected, the dose should
be increased to 100 mg/kg. If lumbar puncture is not performed, antibiotics should be
withheld because giving empiric antibiotics in this situation could mask the presentation of bacterial meningitis on follow-up examination. For ill-appearing infants in this
age group, consideration should be given to augmenting empiric ceftriaxone by adding vancomycin to cover for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
Streptococcus pneumonia resistant to ceftriaxone. Ampicillin should also be considered
for the ill-appearing infant to cover for possible Listeria monocytogenes.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
28.1. An 8-week-old previously healthy infant, product of a full-term pregnancy,
is brought by his older sister to the emergency department for a fever up to
101.2°F. The sister, who is 17 years old, states that she is the primary caretaker
for her brother because the only adult at home is her mother who is struggling
with cocaine and alcohol abuse. The sister states that although her brother has
not been eating well, he is taking in a normal amount of formula and has not
had cough, runny nose, altered behavior, vomiting, or diarrhea. Overall, the
patient is well appearing. You perform an appropriate workup for this infant
with FWS and find a WBC count of 10,000/mm3, and a UA with 2 WBCs/hpf.
You also elect to do an LP and the CSF shows 1 WBC/mm3 and no organisms
on Gram stain. What is the most appropriate disposition for this patient?
A. Discharge the patient home after giving a dose of IV Ceftriaxone.
B. Discharge the patient home but do not give any antibiotics.
C. Give a dose of IV ceftriaxone and admit the patient to the hospital.
D. Order a chest x-ray, stool WBCs and culture, and then admit the patient
to the hospital.
28.2. An 11-week-old male infant is brought in by his mother for 4 days of fever
(Tmax 100.8°F) associated with cough and runny nose. The child was the
product of a full-term healthy pregnancy and his vaccines are up-to-date. He
is overall well appearing and has normal vital signs. A chest x-ray demonstrates no evidence of pneumonia. A rapid respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
test comes back positive. Which of the following statements most accurately
describes the risk of SBI in the RSV positive infant?
A. SBI is just as common in RSV-positive infants as in RSV-negative infants.
B. SBI is less common in RSV-positive infants as in RSV-negative infants.
C. SBI is equally as common in RSV-positive infants as in RSV-negative infants.
D. There is no risk of SBI in the febrile infant with a positive RSV test.
28.3. A 9-week-old well-appearing female infant is brought in to the emergency
department with a chief complaint of a fever up to 102°F at home. The infant
has not had any vomiting or cough and the examination is unremarkable
including a thorough skin examination. In the ED, the infant is afebrile but
had been given ibuprofen by mom 2 hours prior to arrival. A catheter urinalysis
comes back positive for 20 WBCs/hpf. What is the best management for this
patient?
A. Send urine cultures, give her IV antibiotics, and admit her to the pediatric
service.
B. Send urine cultures, give her PO antibiotics, and discharge her home.
C. Give her an IM shot of ceftriaxone and send her home with PO antibiotics.
D. Send urine cultures, give IV or IM antibiotics, and evaluate the social
situation.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

28.4. A 6-week-old male infant is brought in by his parents for evaluation of fever
of 39°C. The infant is ill appearing and lethargic and does not want to breastfeed. His parents also reported that his cry sounds different. The patient is
given antipyretics, a bolus of 20 cc/kg IV fluids and labs are sent. A thorough
examination including skin does not reveal any source of infection, and urinalysis, chest x-ray, and CSF are all normal and cultures are sent. What is the
best management of this patient?
A. Give him an IM shot of ceftriaxone and discharge home with close
follow-up.
B. Give him IV ceftriaxone and admit to the pediatric service.
C. Give him IV ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin and admit to the
pediatric service.
D. Do not give any antibiotics at this time and admit to the pediatric service
for observation.

ANSWERS
28.1 C. This case demonstrates the importance of good follow-up and an adequate
social situation when considering discharging the well-appearing infant with
FWS. In order to discharge a well-appearing infant with FWS, one must ensure
follow-up within 24 hours. There must also be adequate social support to
ensure the patient can be brought back to the hospital if his condition worsens.
In general, this means that the patient’s family should have access to a
telephone and transportation. In this case, the social situation is less than ideal
as a minor is primarily caring for the patient and the only adult in the family is
incapacitated by polysubstance abuse to the point that she has not even come
to the hospital with her ill infant. There is no indication for a chest x-ray or
stool studies in this patient as he has no respiratory symptoms and no diarrhea.
28.2 B. A positive RSV test in a 1- to 3-month-old infant with a fever decreases
the risk of SBI, but does not completely eliminate this risk. Most studies demonstrate that the risk of SBI in the RSV-positive population is decreased by
approximately 50%. The most common SBI in the RSV-positive patient is
a urinary tract infection. There are no studies at this time which have been
powered enough to detect difference in rates of bacteremia and meningitis in
RSV-positive and RSV-negative patients as both bacteremia and meningitis
in this age group is relatively uncommon. Thus, RSV-positive infants in this
age group with fever should at least receive a urinalysis and urine culture. It
remains unclear whether or not clinicians can safely forgo blood and spinal
fluid testing in these same infants.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

301

28.3 D. Urinary tract infection is the most common cause of SBI in infants with
fever without a source and the prevalence has not changed with the PCV7
vaccine. A positive urine is defined as greater than10 WBCs per high power
field. A negative urine dipstick or urinalysis does not exclude UTI as pyuria
is absent on initial urinalysis in up to 20% febrile infants with pyelonephritis.
Thus, a urine culture must be obtained on all patients. Additionally, catheter
samples should always be obtained as bag specimens are often contaminated.
Infants younger than 8 weeks of age should be admitted to the hospital. Wellappearing infants greater than 8 weeks may be discharged home if the parents
are reliable and follow-up within 24 hours is possible. Infants younger than
3 months of age should be given parenteral antibiotics (ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg)
with admission or discharge and may need additional parenteral doses even if
discharged home.
28.4 C. Infants who have an abnormal cry and temperature greater than 38.5°C
or are ill appearing have an increased risk of SBI. Up to 45% of ill-appearing
young infants may have SBI and, thus, require extensive workup including
blood, urine, CSF, and CXR. Ill-appearing infants in this age group should
receive parenteral antibiotic therapy to cover the likely pathogens in this age
group regardless of initial laboratory results (S pneumoniae, S aureus, N meningitides, H influenza type b) and should be admitted to the hospital. Of note,
vancomycin should be administered to infants with soft tissue infection or
CSF pleocytosis. In infants 29 to 60 days of age, ampicillin should also be given
to cover Listeria monocytogenes.

CASE 29
A 60-year-old woman with hypertension and diabetes presents to the emergency
department (ED) with severe left eye pain, redness, and blurred vision for 3 hours.
She reports that her symptoms began while watching a movie in the local cinema.
She initially thought that she had eyestrain, but then her eye began to progressively
ache. She denies any symptoms in her right eye. The patient denies preceding
trauma, photophobia, ocular discharge, increased tearing, or prior eye surgery. She
occasionally wears nonprescription reading glasses because she is farsighted. There
are no prior similar events. She also reports seeing colored halos around the light
fixtures in the ED, and having a headache over her left brow, some nausea, and one
episode of vomiting. She denies dizziness, weakness, imbalance, abdominal pain,
or chest pain. She is fully compliant with her medications, She also and reports having
taken an over-the-counter cold medicine for nasal congestion for the past 2 days.
On examination, her blood pressure is 155/88 mm Hg, pulse is 88 beats per
minute, respirations are 18 breaths per minute, and temperature is 36.8°C (98°F).
She is alert, but in obvious discomfort, although able to tolerate ambient light. She
has no periorbital signs of trauma. The left conjunctiva has ciliary flush (circumferential reddish ring around the cornea), but no discharge or visible foreign body.
Visual acuity is 20/30 in the right eye; but only finger counting in the left eye. Visual
fields are grossly intact. Gentle palpation of the closed left eye reveals that it is
much firmer than the right. Her left pupil is 5 mm, fixed, and unreactive. Her right
eye appears normal; the pupil is 3 mm and briskly reactive. She does not experience
pain in the left eye when direct light is applied to the right eye (absent consensual
photophobia). Extraocular movements are intact and non-painful. The left cornea
is slightly cloudy, which makes fundoscopy difficult. The right fundus appears normal.
Her temporal arteries are pulsatile and nontender. The rest of the physical examination, including the remainder of the neurological examination, is normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 29:
Red Eye
Summary: This is a 60-year-old woman with acute onset of left eye redness, pain, and
markedly decreased visual acuity. The left eye feels firmer to palpation than the right
eye. The left cornea is edematous with a fixed and dilated pupil.
• Next diagnostic step: Slit-lamp examination should be performed and intraocular pressures must be measured in both eyes. The intraocular pressures,
measured using a Tono-Pen are 18 mm Hg and 52 mm Hg in the right and
left eye, respectively. Slit-lamp examination reveals bilateral narrow anterior
chambers. Cell and flare (inflammatory changes) are absent. There is no evidence of hyphema (blood) or hypopyon (white cells) in the anterior chamber.
Fluorescein staining is unremarkable.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma.
• Next step: Lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) should be initiated as
quickly as possible to preserve vision.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Become familiar with the vision-threatening causes of a painful red eye.
2. Understand the basic treatment modalities and disposition options for visionthreatening causes of a painful red eye.
3. Recognize the clinical settings, signs, and symptoms, as well as complications, of
acute angle-closure glaucoma.
4. Understand the key treatment modalities for angle-closure glaucoma.

Considerations
This 60-year-old woman complains of non-traumatic acute onset of left eye pain,
redness, and vision loss with a significant increase in IOP noted on examination.
This case is an example of acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG), a true ophthalmologic emergency characterized by rapidly elevated intraocular pressure, which
compromises blood flow to the optic nerve and can result in permanent vision
loss. It is likely that her underlying narrow ant chamber angle, plus the combination
being in dim lighting and taking an over the counter decongestant (usually a sympathomimetic or anticholinergic), limited outflow of aqueous humor, as the cornea
and iris apposed one another.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

305

APPROACH TO:
Red Eye
ACUTE ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA
The mechanism of AACG or primary angle-closure glaucoma is pupillary block
of the trabecular meshwork outflow pathway. Normally, aqueous humor is produced
by the ciliary body in the posterior chamber, and diffuses through the pupil into
the anterior chamber where it is drained via the trabecular meshwork. A balance
exists between aqueous humor production and outflow to maintain a normal IOP.
However, some individuals are predisposed to acute angle closure glaucoma from
aqueous humor outflow obstruction secondary to anatomical and environmental
factors. Many other forms of glaucoma have a far more insidious, benign presentation, with an inexorable loss of vision. Delay in diagnosis and treatment of AACG
results in permanent loss of vision, as the increased IOP causes optic nerve ischemia. The provider must always consider this diagnosis because it is possible to get
sidetracked evaluating the associated symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting or
abdominal pain, by looking for neurologic or gastrointestinal etiologies. Risk factors
for a narrow angle closure include age-related lens thickening and hyperopia (farsightedness), which results in a shortened eyeball, and a relatively shallow anterior
chamber. There is a 75% risk of a similar attack in the fellow eye if left untreated.
Medications which cause pupil dilatation can also trigger AACG, including anticholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants, adrenergic agonists, and topical mydriatics.
The incidence of narrow angles in the United States is 2% in white patients, and
the rate of AACG is 0.1% in these individuals. Globally, the highest prevalence
rates of AACG occur in certain Asian groups, for example, Mongolians and Inuits.
African Americans have much higher rates of chronic angle-closure glaucoma
(CACG) but lower rates of AACG. Persons between ages of 55 and 65 years have
the highest incidence of AACG. The incidence in women is three to four times the
rate in men. AACG is likely to occur in 33% to 50% of a patient’s first-degree relatives, so the patient should inform their family members.
Acute angle-closure glaucoma can occur with stress, fatigue, dim lighting, or sustained work at close range. The patient may present with mild unilateral eye ache
or intense pain, blurring, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, and frontal
headache. The hallmarks of the physical examination include a fixed, dilated,
midposition pupil, diffuse conjunctival injection, corneal edema (clouding), and a
shallow anterior chamber (Figure 29–1). Slit-lamp examination may reveal mild cell
and flare, but no hyphema or hypopyon. The IOP will be elevated (normal is 9-21
mm Hg); pressures can reach 80 mm Hg in AACG. The other eye must always be
examined for anterior chamber depth (the angle is usually narrow) and IOP.

Management
The therapeutic goal of the initial management of acute angle-closure glaucoma is to
decrease IOP by decreasing aqueous production and increasing outflow. The principal
treatment modalities include aqueous suppressants, osmotic agents, and miotic agents.

6th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill;2004:1460.)

After corneal edema subsides, the definitive treatment is a laser peripheral
iridectomy, performed by an ophthalmologist.
Treatment to lower the intraocular pressure should be initiated in the ED in
consultation with an ophthalmologist. Intraocular pressure is first lowered by
decreasing aqueous humor production with agents such as topical a-blockers (timolol 0.5%), an `-2-agonist (apraclonidine), and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
(acetazolamide 500 mg orally or IV). Patients with sulfa allergy may not tolerate
acetazolamide. Osmotic agents, such as mannitol and glycerol, can be used instead
of acetazolamide to dehydrate the vitreous humor, which decreases intraocular fluid
volume, and thus lowers IOP. Mannitol may induce hypotension in patients with
poor cardiac function, and glycerol should be avoided in diabetic patients. Miotics
(pilocarpine) enhance trabecular outflow by constricting the pupil to disrupt the
corneal-iris apposition. Intraocular pressure should be first lowered by the administration of topical β-blockers and acetazolamide prior to the administration of pilocarpine as the ischemic iris sphincter may be unresponsive to pilocarpine at extremely
high intraocular pressures (>50 mg Hg). Pilocarpine is only used in patients with
native lenses since pilocarpine will induce movement in artificial lens. Systemic
concerns related to topical β-blocker administration include asthma, severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bradycardia, heart block, congestive heart
failure, and myasthenia gravis. Systemic absorption of topical agents can be reduced
up to 70% by instructing the patient to close his or her eyes while occluding the
lower tear ducts at the root of the nose after applying the drops. Punctal occlusion
decreases drug absorption by the nasal mucosa. The patient should also receive analgesic and antiemetic medications.

highly unlikely, but discharge can be scant. However, gonococcal conjunctivitis
(the most serious form of bacterial conjunctivitis) produces a copious purulent discharge with an intensely red eye, and may potentially perforate the cornea. With
chlamydial conjunctivitis the clinical course is more chronic; although the conjunctivae are very red, there is scant discharge. The incidence of sexually transmitted
chlamydial conjunctivitis is increasing.
Corneal inflammation, or keratitis, may be due to viral, bacterial, or protozoal
infection, contact lenses, trauma, or ultraviolet light. Severe keratitis can progress
to a corneal ulcer, which may be visible to the unaided eye as a white defect.
Distinguishing an ulcer from a corneal abrasion is clinically significant and can

be challenging. Examination with the slit lamp is required. The major distinction
is the hazy/cloudy stroma that lies beneath the ulcer in contrast to the clear stroma
deep to most abrasions. A slit-lamp examination is a necessary part of the evaluation of all patients with a red eye. Fluorescein staining should be included in every
examination and may be the only way to identify the classic dendrite with terminal
bulb markings found in herpes simplex keratitis. Herpes zoster dendrites taper at
their ends and are typically associated with periorbital dermatomal vesicular eruptions, or lesions at the tip of the nose (Hutchinson sign of nasociliary involvement).
Patients with HIV are at risk for complications of herpes zoster virus (HZV), and
must undergo careful corneal and retinal evaluation to prevent vision loss.
Anterior uveitis (iritis) is associated with pain, blurred vision, photophobia
(direct and consensual), circumcorneal redness, and anterior chamber cells and
flare. A hypopyon (layer of white cells) may be visible along the inferior rim of
the anterior chamber. The affected pupil is smaller, irregular, and minimally reactive. IOP can be elevated. Etiologies include idiopathic, infectious (tuberculosis,
syphilis, herpes simplex/zoster, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus [CMV]), autoimmune (sarcoidosis, collagen-vascular diseases, human leukocyte antigen [HLA]
B27-associated), and post-traumatic. Uveitis due to herpes simplex virus (HSV)
and HZV is common in HIV positive patients. Because treatment involves topical
corticosteroids with their attendant risk of glaucoma, cataracts, or reactivation
of herpes simplex infections, patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist.
An immune recovery uveitis occurs in 15.5% of HIV-positive patients with CMV
retinitis.
Endophthalmitis is inflammation of the vitreous humor and can be endogenous,
secondary to hematogenous spread from a distant site, or exogenous from inoculation after penetrating trauma. Traumatic endophthalmitis usually develops within
three days of penetrating injury, retained foreign body, or ocular surgery. Hallmarks
include decreased vision, eye pain, hypopyon, anterior chamber cells and flare, an
absent red reflex, and a hazy vitreous. Varying degrees of eyelid swelling, chemosis (conjunctival swelling), and severe conjunctival injection will also be present.
Causative organisms include Bacillus cereus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus,
Streptococcus, gram-negative rods, and fungi. Any patient with a hypopyon requires
an emergent ophthalmology consult. Orbital CT or ultrasound B-scan microscopy
(UBM) may help diagnose a foreign body. Systemic and intravitreal antibiotics will
be necessary to preserve any remainder of vision.
Orbital cellulitis, defined as infection deep to the orbital septum, is usually
associated with blurred vision, diplopia, conjunctival injection, lid swelling, proptosis, fever, toxicity, and limited or painful ocular motility. An orbital computed
tomography (CT) (axial and coronal cuts) is diagnostic, and will often reveal
sinusitis (often ethmoid). Admission and parenteral antibiotics are indicated,
because of the infection can potentially spread into the brain. Preseptal or periorbital cellulitis is a superficial and far less serious entity but it can be difficult to
distinguish from orbital cellulitis. In general, these patients are less toxic appearing, with less pain. Most of these patients can be discharged on oral antibiotics
with close follow-up to make sure they didn’t have an early presentation of the
more serious orbital cellulitis.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

Subconjunctival hemorrhages should be painless and not affect vision. These
hemorrhages are often spontaneous or may be associated with minor trauma including coughing and sneezing. In the setting of blunt trauma, continue evaluating for
hyphema, globe rupture, or retrobulbar hemorrhage if the patient complains of pain
or vision changes. Patients should be informed that the redness (bruise) might take
weeks to spontaneously resolve.
Blunt trauma to the eye may result in a hyphema (blood in the anterior chamber)
and painful, blurred vision. Blood may be visible to the unaided eye if it layers, or
it may only be seen with the slit-lamp in the anterior chamber (microhyphema) on
maximum magnification. Initial treatment includes elevating the head 30 degrees,
an eye shield to prevent additional trauma, mydriatics to paralyze the ciliary body
allowing the iris to rest, pain medication, antiemetics, and consultation. Complications include staining of the cornea by the red cells producing a partially opaque
cornea, elevated IOP secondary to red blood cells occluding the trabecular outflow
tract, and rebleeding.
Scleritis symptoms include severe eye pain, redness, and decreased vision. An
underlying systemic disorder, such as a connective tissue disease, autoimmune disorder, herpes simplex virus (HSV), herpes zoster, HIV, Lyme disease or syphilis, is
frequently the cause. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common systemic cause of
scleritis. HZV is the most common infectious cause of scleritis. The conjunctival,
episcleral, and scleral vessels are inflamed, either diffusely or focally. Unlike episcleral vessels, which blanch with topical vasoconstrictors and move under cotton
swabs, scleral vessels do not. Additionally, the entire sclera may have a bluish or
violaceous hue and may be very tender upon palpation. Treatment of the underlying disorder may involve systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive therapy, and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Temporal arteritis is associated with an ischemic optic neuropathy causes vision
loss. These patients often present with temporal artery tenderness, temporal headache, or jaw claudication. Patients are usually older than age 50 years, and will
have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and an afferent pupillary
defect (contracts to indirect light but not to direct light). A temporal artery biopsy
showing giant cells is required for definitive diagnosis. Timely treatment with systemic steroids may prevent blindness in the other eye.
Optic neuritis is caused by demyelinating inflammation of the optic nerve that
is highly associated with multiple sclerosis and typically occurs within the third
decade of life. These patients complain of subacute eye pain (worse with extraocular movements), vision loss, and decreased color perception (more prominent with
red). On examination the eye may appear grossly normal but there will be an afferent pupillary defect (absent papillary response to direct light) and edema of the
optic nerve disc on fundoscopy in the affected eye. MRI is useful for confirming
optic nerve inflammation and screening for underlying lesions suggestive of multiple
sclerosis. Treatment involves hospital admission for intravenous steroids.
Other causes of non-traumatic acute vision loss are listed in Table 29–2 and focus
on posterior chamber pathology that present with acute painless vision loss: these
including retinal detachment, central retinal artery occlusion, central retinal vein
occlusion, vitreous hemorrhage, and posterior vitreous detachment.

ANSWERS
29.1 B. Anterior uveitis usually presents as photophobia, red eye with pain, and cell
with flare are noted on slit-lamp examination.
29.2 C. In acute angle-closure glaucoma the sudden rise in IOP is a consequence of
blocked outflow, usually due to a pupillary block, and not increased production
of aqueous humor.
29.3 B. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common systemic disease associated with
scleritis.
29.4 B. Bronchospasm is associated with the use of topical β-blockers which can be
systematically absorbed.

CLINICAL PEARLS


A useful working differential diagnosis for vision-threatening causes of
red eye includes acute angle-closure glaucoma, anterior uveitis, endophthalmitis, corneal ulcer, corneal infection, chlamydial/gonococcal
conjunctivitis, orbital cellulitis, hyphema, retrobulbar hemorrhage, and
scleritis.



Subconjunctival hemorrhages should be painless and does not affect
vision. In the setting of blunt trauma, continue evaluating for hyphema,
hypopyon, globe rupture, endophthalmitis, or retrobulbar hemorrhage if
the patient complains of pain or vision changes and emergently consult
an ophthalmologist.



Slit-lamp examination, fluorescein staining, and measurement of intraocular pressure are essential elements of a thorough evaluation of the
red eye.



Beware of systemic complications from topical ophthalmologic medications. Allergic reactions and complications such as bronchospasm from
topical β-blockers are common.

CASE 30
An otherwise healthy 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department
(ED) by his roommate who states that he has “not been acting right” for the past
24 hours. Per the roommate, the patient had complained of a headache 2 days
prior to arrival, and has been progressively somnolent and confused since then.
The patient has no past medical history and does not take any medications. His
roommate states that the patient is a college student who does not use any illegal
drugs and occasionally drinks alcohol. Review of systems is positive for headache
and altered mental status as stated above as well as a tactile fever for the past
2 days. Additional review of systems is unobtainable as the patient is unable to
answer any questions. On physical examination the patient is noted to be febrile
to 38.5°C (101°F) orally, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure
of 114/69, and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation
is 98% on room air. The head and neck examination are significant for dry mucous
membranes and nuchal rigidity. His cardiopulmonary examination is within normal limits with the exception of tachycardia. The abdomen is soft and nontender.
His skin is noted to be warm and well perfused without any rash. The neurologic
examination is significant for an altered mental status with a Glasgow coma score
(GCS) of 10 (eyes open to voice [3], patient moans to painful stimuli [2], and localizes painful stimuli [5]). The motor examination is symmetric, and the patient
appears to be sensate in all extremities. His reflexes are 2+ bilaterally throughout
the upper and lower extremities with downgoing toes. Laboratory studies reveal
a leukocytosis of 24,000/mm3 with a left shift, and are otherwise unremarkable. A
CT scan is completed which shows no mass, shift, bleed, or edema.

ANSWERS TO CASE 30:
Bacterial Meningitis
Summary: This is a 19-year-old man who presents with the classic triad for bacterial
meningitis—fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status.
• Most likely diagnosis: Bacterial meningitis
• Next diagnostic study: Lumbar puncture
• Appropriate treatment: Intravenous antibiotics ± steroids

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to bacterial meningitis
including when to obtain neuroimaging, when to perform a lumbar puncture,
and what empiric therapies to initiate.
2. Recognize the clinical presentation of acute bacterial meningitis.

Considerations
Bacterial meningitis is an inflammation of the leptomeninges (pia/arachnoid/duramaters) from infection of the arachnoid space, characteristically accompanied by
white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. It is one of the ten most common potentially devastating infections and can affect both adults and children. Mortality rates
have been reported as high as 50% in some series, yet most cohorts appear to have
mortality between 10% and 30%. Of patients who survive, approximately 25% will
go on to have a permanent neurologic deficit. It is incumbent upon the emergency
physician to consider this diagnosis in patients presenting with any combination
of the following signs and symptoms: fever, altered mental status, nuchal rigidity
and headache. Although the classic triad includes fever, altered mental status, and
nuchal rigidity, only 44% to 50% of patients will present with all three features.
Almost all patients (99%-100% in the largest study published) have headache plus
at least one of these three clinical signs. Fever is present in 79% to 95% of patients
at presentation and another 4% will develop fever within 24 hours of presentation.
Altered mental status (typically confusion or lethargy) is present in 78% to 83% of
patients with 16% to 22% responsive to only painful stimuli and 6% unresponsive
to all stimuli. Nuchal rigidity is present in 83% to 94% of patients on initial examination, and often persists for more than one week after treatment and resolution of
infection.
Altered mental status (AMS) in an otherwise healthy individual can be caused
by a number of serious illnesses including infectious, metabolic, toxicologic, and
neurologic etiologies. As with any seriously ill emergency department patient, the
initial priorities include managing the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation),
including airway protection, as needed for a depressed level of consciousness.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

315

This patient presents with a GCS of 10, yet appears to be protecting his airway on
initial examination.
Immediately reversible causes of altered mental status, such as hypoglycemia,
hypoxia, and drug intoxication should be recognized and treated during the initial
examination. If a reversible cause of AMS is not identified, and bacterial meningitis
is suspected, prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical.
Additional findings that may raise ones concerns for the diagnosis of meningitis
include seizures, focal neurologic deficits, rash, septic arthritis, papilledema and
photophobia. Seizures have been described in 15% to 30% of patients and are most
commonly associated with infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Focal neurological deficits are seen in 10% to 35% of patients with Listeria monocytogenes as part
of a rhombencephalitis syndrome including ataxia with or without nystagmus, and
cranial nerve palsies. Neisseria meningitidis may cause palpable purpura in 11% to
64% of patients, and concomitant septic arthritis in 7% to 11%. Papilledema and/or
photophobia are rarely present, having been described in less than 5% of cases.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Bacterial Meningitis
CLINICAL APPROACH
The approach to suspected bacterial meningitis involves appropriate use of diagnostic
studies and therapeutic interventions in a timely manner. Although no randomized
controlled trial exists to prove it, the best experimental and observational data
suggest that time to antibiotics has a profound effect on clinical outcomes. Therefore,
our goal in the emergency department is to maintain a high index of suspicion and
not delay treatment while diagnostic studies are being completed.

Diagnosis
The cornerstone of the diagnosis of meningitis is analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF), which is obtained by lumbar puncture (LP). LP can confirm the presence
of inflammatory cells in the CSF, identify the causative organism by Gram stain
and culture, and help in ruling out other potential causes of the patient’s symptoms
(idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri, subarachnoid hemorrhage, autoimmune disease, etc). When it is expected that there will be a significant
delay in obtaining the LP, it is recommended to obtain blood cultures and then initiate treatment with antibiotics with or without dexamethasone, prior to obtaining
the CSF (see the section Treatment). A common cause for delay of diagnosis is the
time it takes to obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head. The goal of
CT scanning prior to performing an LP is to identify those patients that may be at
risk of brain herniation during the procedure. Current Infectious Diseases Society
of America (IDSA) guidelines for CT before LP include patients who present with
altered mental status or a depressed level of consciousness, focal findings on neurologic examination, or a handful of other specific risk factors (Table 30–1). All other
patients can safely have an LP performed without an antecedent CT scan.

Administration of antibiotics has minimal effect on chemistry and cytology of
CSF, but can reduce the yield of Gram stain and culture. In fact, administration of
antibiotics can result in sterile CSF cultures within an hour in patients suffering
from meningococcal infections. Pneumococcal infections, however, will typically
remain culture positive up to 4 to 10 hours after administration of parenteral antibiotics. Importantly, Gram stains can positively identify an organism in 10% to 15%
of patients who have sterile cultures after antibiotic administration.
Identification of the causative organism allows clinicians to safely narrow the
spectrum of antimicrobial therapy. However, in the emergency department we are
often unable to know with certainty what organism will eventually be identified,
and are therefore required to initiate empiric therapy on the basis of epidemiologic
data and local resistance patterns. Gram stain of the CSF is successful in identifying
the microorganism in approximately 80% of cases. As Gram stain results are typically available 1 to 2 days before culture results, it is helpful to know the Gram-stain
pattern of the most common organisms. The presence of gram-positive diplococci
suggests Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, while gram-negative diplococci suggest
Neisseria meningitidis infection. Small pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli
suggests Haemophilus influenzae, while gram-positive rods and coccobacilli suggest
Listeria monocytogenes infection. Additional cases will be identified by culture of the
CSF and blood; yet this information is rarely available during the initial emergency
department presentation. Additional analyses of the CSF should include opening
pressure (which can be the only abnormality present in cases of cryptococcal meningitis), CSF protein, CSF glucose, cell count with differential, and CSF lactate.
Unfortunately, despite all of these tests it can still be quite difficult to distinguish
between the possible causes of meningitis (bacterial, viral, tubercular, neoplasms,
autoimmune, etc) (Table 30–2). Therefore, most patients with CSF pleocytosis
(presence of an elevated number of WBCs) should be admitted to the hospital and
treated for meningitis while awaiting the results of CSF culture.

Treatment
The most important element of treatment after stabilization of the ABCs is initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The most common organisms to cause

bacterial meningitis in adult patients are Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus
pneumoniae. Initial therapy should include a third generation cephalosporin in a
sufficient dose to achieve adequate CSF concentration. Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime
at a dose of 2 g is typically recommended in the United States. As a result of an
increasing worldwide prevalence of drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, most
authorities now recommend a dose of vancomycin along with the third-generation
cephalosporin until a resistance profile can be obtained.
Patients who are older than 50 years of age, alcoholic, or immunocompromised
are at higher risk for additional organisms including Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and aerobic gram-negative bacilli, and should therefore have
ampicillin added to the empiric antibiotic regimen. Patients less than 1 month of
age are at risk for infection with Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella sp, E coli, and
L monocytogenes and require yet another empiric regimen (Table 30–3).
In addition to adequate antimicrobial therapy, a number of recent studies have
shown improved outcomes with adjunctive dexamethasone either before or with the
first dose of antibiotics. The theory is that meningitis leads to significant morbidity
and mortality as a result of the inflammatory response in the CSF. This response can
be heightened when antimicrobials are administered, which will lead to bacterial

lysis and release of additional inflammatory mediators. Administering a dose of corticosteroids (dexamethasone 0.15mg/kg IV every 6h) with or before the first dose
of antibiotics may attenuate the inflammatory response. If antibiotics have already
been initiated as an outpatient or before steroid administration, the subsequent
addition of dexamethasone has no demonstrated efficacy and may cause harm.
The evidence supporting the use of dexamethasone is based largely on a single
randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial that compared dexamethasone
10 mg IV q6h × 4 d versus placebo in 301 adults with bacterial meningitis (suspected
disease plus either cloudy CSF, a positive Gram stain, or >1000 WBC/mm3). In this
trial, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent an unfavorable outcome was 10
and the NNT to prevent death was 12.5. There was, however, some heterogeneity
in the results, with the greatest benefit found in those patients with an intermediate
GCS of 8 to 11 and those with disease ultimately found to be due to Streptococcus
pnuemoniae. For most patients, a single dose of dexamethasone is unlikely to be
harmful, and in general most authorities recommend that if you are giving antibiotics
for suspected bacterial meningitis, it should be preceded or accompanied by a dose
of dexamethasone.
Once a patient is diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, family members and close
contacts (such as this patient’s roommate) are often concerned about whether they
should receive antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent them from developing a similar
infection. Current CDC guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis (typically
with a fluoroquinolone or rifampin) for close contacts (anyone in the same household or day-care center or anyone in direct contact with the patient’s oral secretions) of patients with meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis. Antibiotics for close
contacts of patients with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae are no longer recommended if all contacts 4 years of age or younger are fully vaccinated against Hib
disease. Given the high morbidity and mortality of meningococcal infections, vaccination against N meningitidis is recommended for freshmen college students who live
in dormitories, as they are at moderately increased risk of contracting this disease.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
30.1 A 30-year-old man presents with altered mental status, fever, and nuchal rigidity.
You suspect bacterial meningitis. Which of the following is the appropriate

A. Head CT, lumbar puncture, blood cultures, steroids, antibiotics
B. Blood cultures, head CT, lumbar puncture, steroids, antibiotics
C. Blood cultures, steroids, antibiotics, head CT, lumbar puncture
D. Lumbar puncture, blood cultures, steroids, antibiotics, head CT
E. Head CT, blood cultures, steroids, antibiotics, lumbar puncture
30.2 Which of the following are the appropriate empiric antibiotics to administer
to a 65-year-old man with suspected bacterial meningitis?
A. Vancomycin alone
B. Vancomycin and ceftriaxone
C. Vancomycin and ceftriaxone and amoxicillin
D. Vancomycin and ceftriaxone and ampicillin
30.3 Approximately what percentage of patients with bacterial meningitis present
with the classic triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status?
A. <50%
B. Between 51%-75%
C. Between 76%-99%
D. >99%

ANSWERS
30.1 C. Neuroimaging is indicated in this patient prior to lumbar puncture given
his altered mental status. Given the high suspicion for bacterial meningitis,
antibiotic administration should not be delayed for the head CT. It is expected
that one would obtain blood cultures and administer dexamethasone prior to
the antibiotics in this case.
30.2 D. All adults with suspected bacterial meningitis get a third-generation cephalosporin and most institutions advocate for vancomycin to cover drug-resistant
Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ampicillin is added because this patient is older
than the age of 50.
30.3 A. Although the triad in the question is considered classic, studies have found
that it is only present in less than half of the cases. If headache is added to the
other 3, then at least 2 of the 4 symptoms are present in approximately 95%
of patients.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

CLINICAL PEARLS


The classic triad of fever, neck stiffness, and a change in mental status is
present in less than 50% of patients with bacterial meningitis.



Younger patients that are otherwise healthy do not require neuroimaging
prior to LP if they have a normal neurologic examination including mental
status.



Initial antimicrobial therapy in adults should include a third-generation
cephalosporin and vancomycin to cover drug-resistant S pneumoniae.



Patients older than 50 years, alcoholics, and immunocompromised
patients should have ampicillin added to the empiric antimicrobial therapy
to cover L monocytogenes.



Dexamethasone prior to or with the first dose of antibiotics has been
shown to decrease neurologic sequelae as well as mortality among adults
with bacterial meningitis.

CASE 31
A 37-year-old man, known to be an insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM), is brought
into the emergency department (ED) by ambulance after a motor vehicle accident.
Per EMS, he was the restrained driver of a vehicle when he apparently lost control
of the car and drove into the center divide at highway speeds. Witnesses reported
that the vehicle rolled over multiple times and the air bag did not deploy. There
is severe damage to the front of the vehicle. Vital signs taken in the field showed
a blood pressure of 110/85 mm Hg, heart rate 140 beats per minute, respiration
rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on 15 L of oxygen via nonrebreather mask. During transport to the ED, the patient begins to seize. Paramedics describe tonic-clonic movements of all four extremities. He is given lorazepam
2-mg IV push with almost immediate resolution of the seizure. In the ED, on
examination (once the seizure has stopped), his airway is patent, breath sounds
are equal bilaterally, and pulses are bounding throughout. His Glasgow coma
scale (GCS) is 8. His blood glucose is 75. It is noted that his right pupil is 5 mm
and nonreactive, his left pupil is 3 mm and reactive. His tone is normal in all four
extremities. His reflexes are 2+ throughout. His toes are downgoing bilaterally. His
cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examination are unremarkable. He is
not wearing a medic-alert bracelet. His CT scan of the head reveals a large rightfrontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

ANSWERS TO CASE 31:
Seizure Induced by Traumatic Brain Injury
Summary: A 37-year-old man, unrestrained driver in motor vehicle accident, seizing en route to the ED and found to have right-sided blown pupil, GCS 8, and no
known history (hx) of seizures.
• Most likely diagnosis: Seizure likely secondary to acute intraparenchymal
bleed from a traumatic brain injury.
• Next step: Aggressive management of ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation) with rapid sequence intubation to protect the airway, management of ICP,
and anticonvulsant treatment to prevent reoccurrence of seizures.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Develop a methodological approach to the assessment of the patient who presents to the emergency department with first-time seizure and status epilepticus.
2. Understand the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the patient presenting to
the emergency department with first-time seizure and status epilepticus.

Considerations
This 37-year-old man with IDDM presents with a seizure after being involved in a
motor vehicle accident. It is important to consider the order of events in traumas
such as this, especially when the history is limited. This patient may have had a seizure while driving secondary to hypoglycemia, and then crashed his car. He may also
have a past medical history of epilepsy and be subtherapeutic on his anticonvulsant
medications. He may have lost control of the car for some unknown reason, and
then crashed the car causing traumatic brain injury, intraparenchymal bleeding, and
subsequent seizure.

APPROACH TO:
Seizure Disorders
DEFINITIONS
SEIZURE: A seizure is any event involving an abnormal firing of neurons that
causes a sudden change in behavior characterized by changes in sensory perception
or motor activity. It can sometimes occur in the presence of precipitating factors
(provoked seizure).
EPILEPSY: The term epilepsy is applied when 2 or more unprovoked seizures occur
more than 24 hours apart.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

323

STATUS EPILEPTICUS: Status epilepticus is historically defined as more than
30 minutes of continuous seizure activity or two or more sequential seizures without
return to normal mental baseline.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Classiﬁcations
Seizures can be divided into two major classifications based on their origin. Neurogenic seizures represent the majority of seizures seen in the ED and result from
excessive discharge of cortical neurons. Psychogenic, or nonepileptic, seizures (NES)
are increasingly common and may be extremely difficult to distinguish from true seizures. Unlike neurogenic seizures, these pseudoseizures are not the result of abnormal
cortical discharge, and are often associated with major stress or emotional trauma.
Unclassified seizures are difficult to fit into a single class and are considered when
there is inadequate data.
Neurogenic seizures can be broken down into 2 main subgroups depending on
their manifestation. Generalized seizures involve abnormal neuronal activity in both
hemispheres of the brain and are accompanied by a loss of consciousness. They
can be further characterized based on the pattern of motor activity, such as tonic
(rigid trunk and extremities), clonic (symmetrical rhythmic jerking of the trunk
and extremities), tonic-clonic (tonic phase followed by clonic phase), atonic (sudden loss of postural tone), and myoclonic (brief, shock-like muscular contractions).
Partial (focal) seizures involve neuronal discharge in a localized area of one cerebral hemisphere and are subclassified into simple (consciousness is maintained) and
complex (impaired level of consciousness).
Status epilepticus (SE) is present when patients have more than 30 minutes of
continuous seizure activity or have 2 or more sequential seizures without full recovery of consciousness in between. SE is the initial presentation of a seizure disorder in
approximately one-third of cases. The most common cause of SE is discontinuation
of anticonvulsant medications. The catecholamine surge that accompanies SE can
cause tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. Nonconvulsive SE can also occur
and must be ruled out in any patient who does not regain consciousness within 20
to 30 minutes of cessation of a single generalized seizure and should be considered in
any patient with unexplained confusion or coma.

Etiology
It is important to consider the etiology of a patient’s seizure as it may influence the
clinical approach. Primary, unprovoked seizures in a patient with a known history
of epilepsy are usually managed pharmacologically with the goal of restoring normal
neuronal function. However, seizures can also present as secondary manifestations
of other primary diseases.
Common etiologies of secondary seizures include head trauma, intracranial
masses or hemorrhages, infections such as meningitis or encephalitis, metabolic
disturbances (ie, glucose or electrolyte abnormalities), and drugs or toxins. Additional common conditions that may present as seizures include hypertensive

324

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

encephalopathy and anoxic-ischemic injury secondary to cardiac arrest or severe
hypoxemia. Eclampsia must also be considered in pregnant women as a potential
etiology of seizures.

Diagnosis
History: History is essential in the evaluation of a seizure patient, especially in
a ﬁrst-time seizure. It is important to ask the patient and/or witnesses the circumstances leading up to the seizure, including a description of the ictal movements
and the postictal period. Any symptoms associated with the seizure should also be
addressed to help direct work-up and management. For example, a headache prior
to the seizure is concerning for intracranial hemorrhage, while a fever and/or general
malaise in a patient who presents with a seizure is worrisome for infectious causes.
Patients with a known seizure disorder should be questioned about the type and
frequency of their seizures as well as medication compliance. Past medical history,
medications, and social history including drug and alcohol use and HIV risk factors
are also important to consider.

Examination: Patients presenting to the ED with seizure require a thorough physical examination. A detailed neurologic examination is the key component of the
evaluation. Focal deficits may be a critical clue to the ultimate diagnosis or may represent a common transient postictal neurologic insult referred to as a Todd paralysis.
The head and neck examination should include the tongue to look for lacerations,
head or facial trauma, and signs of meningismus. Cardiopulmonary examination
should include auscultation for heart murmurs or an irregular rhythm suggesting
an embolic or syncopal event. Although rare, extremity fractures or dislocations
are commonly missed when they do occur and should be ruled out by a thorough
musculoskeletal examination.
Diagnostic Workup: Appropriate laboratory studies in patients with first-time
seizures include glucose, serum electrolytes such as sodium, calcium, and magnesium, assessment of renal function, hematology studies such as a complete blood
cell count, and drug or toxicology screen. Women of childbearing age also require a
pregnancy test.
Neuroimaging studies should be performed when a clear etiology to the seizure
is not identified or whenever an acute intracranial process is suspected. American
College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) guidelines recommend a head CT be performed in patients with a history of recent head trauma, persistent altered mental
status or headache, fever, malignancy, immunocompromised status, anticoagulation,
or in patients who have a new focal deficit, are over 40, or have a partial-onset
seizure.
A lumbar puncture is an essential part of the workup if clinical presentation is
suggestive of an infectious process. Use of the EEG is uncommon in the ED evaluation of first-time seizure except in the assessment of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, or to establish status epilepticus in a patient who has been given long-acting
paralytic agents.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

325

MANAGEMENT
Initial stabilization of the patient requires (a) ABCs, (b) bedside glucose analysis,
(c) pulse oximetry, (d) cardiac monitoring, and (d) anticonvulsant therapy if seizure activity continues at time of evaluation.
Aggressive airway protection is critical as seizure patients have decreased gag
reflexes and are at risk for aspiration. Positioning the patient on their side with
frequent suctioning, if necessary, will lower the risk for aspiration. Patients who
continue to seize despite therapy or those unable to protect their airway with conservative measures require intubation.

Pharmacologic Therapy
Parenteral benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for active seizures (including SE)
and are effective in terminating seizures in 75% to 90% of patients. They suppress
seizure activity by directly enhancing GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-related
neuronal inhibition. Lorazepam is generally preferred up to a dose of 0.1 mg/kg
given at 2 mg/min. Lorazepam and diazepam (0.2 mg/kg IV given at 5 mg/min)
are equally effective at terminating the initial seizure, while lorazepam is superior
for preventing recurrence of the seizure. IV midazolam has been less studied but
has shown a trend toward superior efficacy and decreased incidence of adverse outcomes compared to lorazepam and diazepam. Options for patients without intravenous access include IM midazolam or lorazepam (midazolam is probably the best
option) in addition to rectal diazepam.
If a benzodiazepine does not terminate seizure activity, second-line agents for
abortive therapy include phenytoin or fosphenytoin. Phenytoin does not directly
suppress electrical activity at the seizure focus but rather slows recovery of voltage-activated sodium channels and thus suppresses neuronal recruitment. Thus,
concurrent benzodiazepine administration is necessary when treating active seizures. The total oral dose of phenytoin is about 20 mg/kg with a maximum of
400 mg every 2 hours. It can also be given via slow IV administration up to 18 mg/
kg. The rate can be no greater than 50 mg/min to avoid hypotension and cardiac
dysrhythmias associated with its propylene glycol diluent. Fosphenytoin is the
prodrug of phenytoin, is water soluble, and can be administered at 150 mg/min
without significant toxicity. Cerebellar findings, such as nystagmus and ataxia,
are the most common neurological side effects associated with phenytoin. While
parenteral loading is most common, oral loading is appropriate in patients who
report medication noncompliance or are found to have a subtherapeutic phenytoin level.
Phenobarbital is a CNS depressant that directly suppresses cortical electrical
activity and is often used after benzodiazepines and phenytoin have failed. The onset
of intravenous phenobarbital is 15 to 30 minutes with a long duration of action of
up to 48 to 96 hours. Adverse effects of phenobarbital include profound respiratory
depression and hypotension, limiting its use as abortive seizure therapy to third-line
therapy.
Parenteral valproic acid has shown some recent promise as abortive seizure
therapy, and is considered an alternative in cases where benzodiazepine or
phenytoin use is limited by hypotension or hypersensitivity. Although similar

326

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

to phenytoin in mechanism of action, it is generally well tolerated with mild
side effects. Recommended loading dose for valproic acid is 15 to 20 mg/kg at a
rate of 3 to 6 mg/kg/min, although more rapid bolus infusions have been safely
administered.
Additional agents to be considered for abortive seizure therapy include propofol, barbiturates (other than phenobarbital), and inhaled anesthetics such
as isoflurane. Propofol acts as a direct GABA agonist and global CNS depressant. While studies are limited showing its efficacy in SE, it has been shown to
provide almost immediate suppression of seizure activity after a bolus infusion.
Barbiturates (pentobarbital and thiopental) directly enhance GABA-mediated
neuronal inhibition while suppressing all other brainstem functions and thus can
also induce respiratory arrest, myocardial depression, and hypotension. Isoflurane
anesthesia suppresses electrical seizure foci and is the treatment of last resort for
the patient in SE, as these are patients who will have required intubation and
ventilatory support.
Levetiracetam is a relatively new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with a mechanism of
action that is atypical compared to other AEDs. Clinical studies suggest that it might
have a significant effect in generalized seizures and was recently approved by the FDA
as adjunctive treatment for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and
children aged 6 years and older. It is not yet recommended for abortive seizure therapy.
Patients in SE who require intubation are ideally induced with a benzodiazepine,
serving to both sedate and to abate the seizure. If the patient requires paralysis for
management purposes, it cannot be assumed that the patient’s seizure has been terminated. In this situation, anticonvulsant therapy should be continued and EEG
monitoring of the patient should be arranged.

SPECIAL CASES
Drug-Induced Seizures
Therapy for drug-induced seizures is guided by general seizure management principles. There are no clear evidence-based guidelines for the management of drugrelated seizures and usually require therapy that is specific to the etiological agent.
Cocaine is one of the most frequent causes of drug-induced seizures. Approximately 15% of cocaine users will experience a drug-induced seizure. Seizures caused
by cocaine are a result of a combination of a lowered seizure threshold and hypersympathetic state. They are often associated with hyperthermia and high lactate
levels. These seizures are usually self-limited, but in cases of status epilepticus,
should be treated with high doses of benzodiazepines.
Tricyclic antidepressants cause seizures as a consequence of their anticholinergic properties. In addition to standard seizure therapy, patients with status
epilepticus secondary to tricyclic overdose should be treated with sodium bicarbonate in an effort to obtain a blood pH of approximately 7.5. This will decrease the
free form of the drug in the patient’s CNS as well as mitigate the drug’s sodium
channel–blocking effect on the heart.
Isoniazid-induced seizures are associated with a high mortality rate and typically
occur within 120 minutes of an acute overdose. Isoniazid binds pyridoxine, the active

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

327

form of vitamin B6, a cofactor for glutamic acid decarboxylase, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase. INH toxicity and depleted vitamin B6 lead
to a reduction in levels of CNS inhibitory transmitter GABA and ultimately can
result in status epilepticus. Treatment of seizures secondary to isoniazid toxicity is
often refractory to standard measures and should be treated with IV pyridoxine.
The dose of pyridoxine is based upon the amount of drug ingested.

Alcohol Withdrawal Seizures
Alcohol withdrawal seizures (AWS) are a leading cause of seizures in adults.
These seizures often occur as part of a constellation of early withdrawal symptoms
typically within 6 to 48 hours after the last drink. Other withdrawal symptoms
including sweating, anxiety, tremor, auditory/visual hallucinations, agitation, nausea/vomiting, headache, and disorientation often occur prior to the onset of seizures.
The more serious withdrawal syndrome of delirium tremens can be associated with
seizures that may occur as long as 7 days post alcohol cessation. The more common
and classic early AWS often occur in bunches of up to 4 to 6 seizures. However, these
almost always cluster over a fairly brief period of time and they rarely persist past
twelve hours from onset. Recent evidence recommends the use of benzodiazepines
to reduce the incidence of seizures and delirium. Phenytoin does not have a role in
managing either AWS or controlling recurrent alcohol-related seizures in the ED;
however it may play a role in alcoholics who have underlying seizure disorders. The
data for use of other anticonvulsants like carbamazepine in alcohol withdrawal seizures are limited.
CT imaging of the head has a high diagnostic yield in patients with their first
alcohol-related seizure as these patients have a high incidence of structural intracranial lesions, such as subdural hematomas or other intracranial hemorrhages. Alcoholism is also a common cause of hypoglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities,
thus electrolytes should be checked. IV fluid hydration with a glucose-containing
solution in addition to thiamine, magnesium, potassium, and multivitamins is also
indicated.

Neurocysticercosis
Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is an infection of the brain with larvae of Taenia solium
(pork tapeworm) and is the most common cause of adult onset seizures in the developing countries of Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. It is also
becoming increasingly prevalent in nonendemic countries with large immigrant
populations. Seizures can vary from simple partial seizures to generalized tonic clonic.
Diagnosis is confirmed via neuroimaging with visualization of active or calcified cysts
in the brain. Treatment is usually initiated by a neurologist and consists of an antihelminth medication such as albendazole, combined with an antiepileptic medication.

Pseudoseizures
Pseudoseizures, also known as psychogenic seizures, are often the result of major
stress or emotional trauma. These psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are often
difficult to distinguish from physiologic seizures. Patients with psychogenic seizures tend to have multiple seizure patterns, which are usually not followed by a

328

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

postictal period. Urinary incontinence and injury such as tongue biting has been
reported in up to 20% of patients with psychogenic seizure. Unlike in physiologic
seizures, noxious stimuli such as ammonia capsules may elicit responses from patients
having psychogenic seizures. The observation of purposeful movement during a psychogenic seizure also is typical. Management of pseudoseizures involves reassurance
and patient education with psychiatric consultation often recommended.

Patient Disposition
Disposition of patients will likely depend on the etiology of their seizure (if known),
the known seizure history, and the availability of adequate outpatient follow-up.
All patients need to be provided detailed seizure precautions, and locally mandated reporting requirements must be noted in the patient’s chart. Currently, the
law in 6 states (California, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, and Pennsylvania) requires physicians to report patients with seizures. They should also be warned
about limiting activities when and where sudden loss of consciousness would be
especially dangerous such as operating heavy equipment, swimming alone, cooking
with hot water or even bathing.
In patients with known epilepsy who present with a single seizure, it is acceptable to send laboratory test results for anticonvulsant levels (if appropriate), give
a loading dose of the appropriate anticonvulsant, and then discharge them with
the appropriate follow-up. Subtherapeutic levels of antiseizure medication can be a
result of medical noncompliance or increased metabolism, often caused by concurrent medication intake. Any history or physical examination findings consistent
with a new seizure pattern should be addressed, as would be the case in a first-time
seizure patient (Tables 31–1 and 31–2). Patients should also be thoroughly educated
regarding the risks and benefits of noncompliance with antiepileptic medications.
In patients without a history of epilepsy who present with a single unprovoked
seizure, a more thorough workup is indicated. If this initial workup is unremarkable,
it is acceptable to discharge the patient home with follow up neuroimaging and an
appointment with a neurologist. They will not necessarily need to be discharged on
new antiepileptic medications but they will need education about restrictions in
patients with seizures.
Patients without a history of seizure who do not return to baseline and remain
postictal should be admitted to the hospital until they return to their baseline mental status and the underlying etiology of their seizures is determined. Patients in
status epilepticus are usually admitted to the ICU for management and evaluation.

31.3 A 21-year-old man is brought into the ED for a seizure which was witnessed. It
was described as tonic clonic and lasting for 3 minutes. Currently, the patient
appears alert, oriented, and with normal vital signs. He has no nuchal rigidity.
He admits to being diagnosed with HIV disease, but otherwise has no medical problems. He denies head trauma, or alcohol or illicit drug use. He denies
headache. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Emergent CT or MRI imaging of the brain
B. Begin fosphenytoin for seizure disorder
C. Observation because this is his first seizure
D. Stat EEG

ANSWERS
31.1 C. New-onset seizure in the ED caused by metabolic abnormalities is rare.
Hypoglycemia is considered the most common metabolic cause of seizure.
Symptomatic hypoglycemia occurs most commonly as a complication of insulin or oral hypoglycemic therapy in diabetics. Hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia,
and hypomagnesemia are other, less-common metabolic causes of seizure.
31.2 B. A patient who experiences 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity or a
series of seizures without return to full consciousness between seizures is considered to be in status epilepticus. The most common cause of status epilepticus is discontinuation of anticonvulsant medications.
31.3 A. Diagnostic imaging with head CT or MRI is recommended for seizure
patients with suspicion of head trauma, elevated intracranial pressure, intracranial mass, persistently abnormal mental status, focal neurologic abnormality,
or HIV disease.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Identifying the patient within one of the following subgroups facilitates
the evaluation and management of the seizure patient in the emergency
department: (a) new-onset (first-time) seizure, (b) recurrent seizures in
patients with epilepsy, (c) febrile seizures, (d) post-traumatic seizures,
and (e) alcohol- and drug-related seizures.



The possibility of reactive seizures should be considered in all seizure
patients who present to the ED, including patients with a history of epilepsy.
Failure to treat the underlying cause of reactive seizure is a major pitfall.



Seizures may be confused with other nonictal states such as syncope,
hyperventilation, and breath-holding spells in children, migraines, transient global amnesia, cerebral vascular disease, narcolepsy, and psychogenic seizures.



Prolonged altered mental status following a seizure should not be
attributed to an uncomplicated postictal state.

Summary: This is a 76-year-old man from a nursing home with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and COPD. He presents to the ED with altered mental status
(AMS). He has limited mobility due to a cast on his left lower leg secondary to a
tibia fracture. His examination reveals dehydration and lab tests are consistent with
significant hyponatremia and prerenal azotemia.
• Most likely diagnosis: Electrolyte abnormality (hyponatremia) secondary to
deconditioning and dehydration.
• Next step in management: Intravenous fluid hydration and consider hypertonic saline.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the diversity in presentation of patients with altered mental status and
understand the diagnostic approach to the workup.
2. Be able to order the appropriate workup for patients and learn the initial
management.

Considerations
This is a 76-year-old man who presents to the ED from a nursing home. The presentation of altered mental status in a nursing home patient should elicit concerns
for underlying infection (eg, sepsis, meningitis, UTI), electrolyte and metabolic
abnormalities (eg, hypo- or hyperglycemia, hyponatremia), delirium, and hypoxia.
In the younger population, it is important to keep in mind other common causes of
altered mental status such as intoxications and withdrawal syndromes.
Once the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) are addressed, the
first step in management is to obtain a capillary blood glucose to rule out hypoglycemia. The patient appears dehydrated and an electrolyte panel should immediately
be sent to the lab and intravenous fluid started for resuscitation.

APPROACH TO:
Altered Mental Status
DEFINITIONS
CONFUSION: Reversible disturbance of consciousness, attention, cognition, and
perception that occurs within a short period of time
DELIRIUM: Global disturbance in consciousness and cognition, with an inability
to relate to environment and process sensory input that is not better explained by
preexisting or evolving dementia
DEMENTIA: Progressive, irreversible decline in mental function affecting judgment, memory, reasoning, comprehension
AGITATION: Excessive restlessness with increased mental and physical activity
COMA: Severe alteration of consciousness where one cannot be aroused
STUPOR: Level of decreased responsiveness where an individual requires aggressive or unpleasant stimulation
OBTUNDED: Level of diminished arousal or awareness frequently from extraneous causes (infection, intoxication, metabolic states)

CLINICAL APPROACH
The phrase “altered mental status” generally refers to a change from an individual’s
“normal” mental state. This may reflect a change in behavior, speech, comprehension level, judgment, mood, or level of consciousness (awareness or arousal state).
Changes in mental status should be thought of in terms of organic, functional or
psychiatric, or as a mixed disorder. Organic causes have a pathological basis primarily
with a systemic or metabolic root, however structural lesions must also be considered. Functional or psychiatric diseases do not have a clearly defined physiologic
foundation.
The reticular activating system (RAS) is physiologically responsible for our level
of arousal. Signals from the RAS run through the pons in the brainstem, through the
thalami, then project to both cerebral hemispheres. Any disruption in this pathway
will lead to a decreased level of arousal. Examples of this may be through chemical
depression via endogenous or exogenous agents or via structural abnormalities such
as decreased blood flow resulting in ischemia.
Altered mental status and confusion are estimated to occur in 2% of all ED
patients, 10% of hospitalized patients, and 50% of elderly hospitalized patients.
The evaluation of a patient with altered mental status can be a diagnostic challenge and a complete history and physical examination (Table 32–1) is imperative
to the workup. Because the patient often cannot provide a reliable history, it is
important to obtain information from all available sources such as family, friends,
bystanders, and nursing home staff. The severity of illness must be quickly assessed
and any life-threatening issues must be rapidly addressed (See Table 32-2).
Assessing the patient’s ABCs, and quickly recognizing and managing reversible causes of AMS, such as hypoglycemia or hypoxia, are critical steps in

early management. A systematic approach guided by your history and physical and
gathering understanding as to how mentation is altered (see Definition list) should
be undertaken. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or Quick Confusion
Scale (QCS) can be used and these ask are 4 to 7 questions that can be used in reassessment to monitor change in mental status.
If altered patient is unable to provide a history, then gathering as much information
as possible from EMS, nursing home staff, family or bystanders is critical. EMS may be
able to provide clues by describing the scene from where they transported the patient.
Was there an empty pill vial? Did the patient verbalize any recent complaints? When
was the patient last seen normal? What is the baseline mental status? Was the change
in mental status abrupt or gradual? Has the condition changed since first recognized?
Special consideration must be given to pediatric and geriatric populations. Seizures with prolonged postictal states, head injuries, and accidental ingestions are
common causes for altered mental status in the pediatric population. In the geriatric
population a change in mental status may occur concomitant with existing dementia.
Electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration are common causes in addition to hypo
and hyperglycemia and thyroid hormone abnormalities. The elderly are more prone
to subdural hematomas due to age-related cerebral atrophy; increasing the vulnerability of the bridging veins to tearing. Polypharmacy and unintentional overdoses
also commonly cause an alteration in mental status.
Many mnemonics are used to aid in the clinical workup for altered mental status.
One popular pneumonic is AEIOU TIPS (see Table 32–3). In elderly patients who
are confused and forgetful, understanding the differences between dementia and
delirium is critical (Table 32–4).

Glasgow Coma Scale
The Glasgow coma scale (Table 32–5) was created as an assessment tool to quantify
the degree of depression in the level of consciousness in patients with head trauma.
Its purpose was to track the progress of patients’ neurologic status. Its use has widened to include patients with undifferentiated change in mental status. The scoring
scale utilizes assessments of eye opening, and motor and verbal function to provide
a rapid indication on any alteration of function. A higher score corresponds to a
higher level of consciousness.

supplemental oxygen are the ﬁrst steps in treating hypoxic causes of AMS. Subsequently begin bag-valve-mask ventilation. If the underlying cause of apnea or hypoventilation cannot immediately be corrected (eg, naloxone for opiate overdose),
then the patient will require endotracheal or nasotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Assess circulation by feeling for pulses, placing the patient on a cardiac monitor,
assess skin perfusion, and check blood pressure. The only way to fix a hypoperfused
brain is to restore circulation. Begin CPR if the patient is pulseless or a nonperfusing rhythm (v-fib, pulseless v-tach) is seen on the monitor and prepare
for defibrillation or cardioversion. If there is a pulse, but signs of shock are present
(mottled skin, cool extremities), you need to assure adequate volume (IV fluids),
hemoglobin (transfusion), and peripheral vascular resistance (pressors).
As soon as adequate airway, breathing and circulatory support has been established then make a global assessment of neurologic functioning. Assess the GCS
scale. Check for pupil size and reactivity. Look for any spontaneous movement,
especially noting seizure-like activity or lack of movement on one side suggesting
a stroke or below a certain level (spinal cord injury). Any suspicion of cord injury
requires placement of a cervical collar and immobilization. Undress the patient and
onto his or her side to look for any signs of trauma, drug patches or infection sources.

Infectious Fever, recent history of infection, or any signs of infection on physical
examination need to be addressed immediately. Any patient who is altered with a
fever should always raise the suspicion for meningitis. It is prudent to empirically
treat (ceftriaxone and vancomycin and pretreat with steroids) these patients while
you proceed with the diagnostic workup (lumbar puncture). If the history and physical
suggests any other sources of infection (pneumonia, UTI), appropriate antibiotics
and cultures should be started right away. Indwelling lines need to be removed or
changed and any fluid collections must be drained.
Metabolic Hypoglycemia is a common cause of altered mental status. If you cannot quickly determine blood glucose go ahead and give an amp of D50 (25 g of
dextrose). In addition to unconsciousness, hypoglycemia can cause seizures and the
patient may have a prolonged postictal phase. If the patient is unconscious and
intravenous access is difficult, you can consider administering intramuscular glucagon,
which acts as a counterregulatory hormone to increase serum glucose levels.
Hypo- and hypernatremia are primarily problems of water metabolism and are
frequently associated with volume overload or dehydration states. Hyponatremia
can cause altered mental status, focal neurologic abnormalities, and seizures. This
should be treated with hypertonic (3%) saline. Hypernatremia should respond to
appropriate rehydration. These patients typically require admission to the intensive
care unit.
Hypo- and hypercalcemia can result from several metabolic abnormalities or
paraneoplastic syndromes. Hypocalcemia should be treated with calcium, whereas
the initial treatment for hypercalcemia is intravenous fluid hydration.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

341

Primary CNS Seizure is a common cause for AMS. Always rule out hypoglycemia
first. Benzodiazepines are the first-line therapy. Send blood for levels if the patient
is on anticonvulsants with measurable levels or metabolites. Load subtheraputic
patients where appropriate.
Tumors can present as altered mental status. Any previous cancer history, focal
neurologic findings, headache, or papilledema should prompt a head CT scan.
IV contrast enhances the ability of plain CT to identify tumors. If there is evidence
of edema or mass-effect, then consider administering steroids to help reduce vasogenic edema. Obtain an emergent neurosurgic consultation. These patients typically
require admission to the intensive care unit.
Brain abscesses can be identified with a contrast-enhanced head CT scan. These
patients should immediately be placed on antibiotics and be seen by a neurosurgeon.
Drugs and Toxins Many overdoses can lead to altered mental status. Look for
signs of a toxidrome (sedative/hypnotic, sympathomimetic, anticholinergic, cholinergic, and opiate/opioid). Most toxidromes can be treated with supportive measures,
however specific antidotes exist for each (see Case 40).
Ethanol intoxication is a common ingestion for ED patients. These patients need
to be thoroughly evaluated to exclude other causes of their change in mental status
(stroke, hypoglycemia, Wernicke encephalopathy, intracranial bleed, toxic alcohol).
Once serious causes are ruled out, these patients require supportive care until they
can be discharged.
Withdrawal states can lead to altered mental status. Patients with ethanol and
benzodiazepine withdrawal are typically hyperadrenergic, agitated, and confused.
These patients require administration of benzodiazepines, supportive care, and inpatient admission.
Trauma A CT scan should be performed immediately in patients with evidence
of head trauma and altered mental status. It is important to rule out an intracranial
injury such as acute bleeding, skull fracture, and evidence of increased intracranial
pressure. The trauma or neurosurgical service should be contacted for any positive
findings.
Disposition Unless the patient with altered mental status presents to the ED with
an identifiable reversible cause for his or her change in mental status (heroin overdose), the majority of patients who present to the ED with altered mental status will
require admission for further inpatient workup.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
32.1 A 77-year-old women is brought to the ED by her daughter. The daughter provides the history that her mother is usually alert and oriented and performs all
of her activities of daily life (ADLs) by herself. Over the past week, the patient
has been eating and drinking less and tells her daughter that she is not hungry.
Yesterday she had an episode of incontinence and this morning she woke up
confused, unable to follow commands and kept asking where her husband was
(he’s been deceased for over 5 years). The patient is tachycardic with a HR in
the 130s, appears dehydrated, has a low-grade fever, and smells of urine. The
most likely cause of her altered mental status is?
A. Alzheimer dementia
B. Alcohol Intoxication
C. Overmedication
D. Urinary tract infection
32.2 A 45-year-old man who runs his own business has been struggling with his
finances since undergoing three surgeries to fix his right shoulder. He has been
visiting multiple doctors to help control his pain. EMS was called to his office
after an employee found the patient on his office floor with a bottle of vodka
and a prescription medication bottle lying next to him. Which of the following should be the first course of action in the ED?
A. Administer naloxone as he likely overdosed on pain medications.
B. Give thiamine to prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
C. Obtain a capillary blood glucose check.
D. Disrobe the patient, place on a monitor, and obtain vital signs.
32.3 A 68-year-old woman was brought to the ED after her friends noticed that during lunch the patient began slurring her speech and started acting confused.
They were about to take her home when she developed jerking movements of
the extremities and become unresponsive. When EMS arrived she was conscious, hypertensive at 160/90 mm Hg, with otherwise normal vital signs. She
was not talking or following commands. After addressing the ABCs, what is
the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
A. Administer lorazepam as she likely had a seizure.
B. Administer glucose as she likely is having a hypoglycemic episode.
C. Obtain a head CT scan as she may be having a stroke or intracranial
hemorrhage.
D. Treat her blood pressure emergently as she is having a hypertensive
emergency.

343

ANSWERS
32.1 D. Infection is a common cause of altered mental status especially in the
elderly population. The history suggests a urinary tract infection concomitant with dehydration. This is the most likely cause of this patient’s altered
mental status. Alzheimer’s does not develop rapidly, but rather gradually
over time. The history is not suggestive of alcohol abuse and additional
history and physical examination signs should be present to suggest a medication overuse.
32.2 D. In all patients the ABCs take priority. The patient should be assessed and the
physical examination performed before administering any medications. In this
patient with altered mental status of unknown etiology, the “coma cocktail” will
likely be administered, but should be guided by the physical examination and
history.
32.3 C. This presentation is concerning for a stroke. The history obtained from
friends in this case is critical to making a diagnosis for this patient. She did
have a seizure and may be in a postictal state. However, the history of slurred
speech and confusion raise suspicion for stroke and as soon as the patient is
stable, she should undergo a CT scan. It is important to first establish the
type of stroke before altering the blood pressure as it can be detrimental
if the blood pressure is lowered too much and too rapidly in patients with
ischemic stroke.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Be sure to talk with family, EMS, nursing home care providers and
review medical records for important pieces of historical information,
new medications, and baseline behavior and functional status.



Check vitals signs frequently, making sure to get accurate readings on
pulse oximetry, temperature, and blood pressure.



A glucose level should be checked immediately in all patients with altered
mental status.



Be careful not to classify a confused elderly patient as demented without
first ruling out organic causes of their confusion.

CASE 33
A 6-year-old boy presents to the emergency department (ED) with his parents
complaining of a limp for 3 days. The limp began following a fall from a playground structure, and has worsened to the point that the child is no longer willing
to walk. The patient was treated two weeks ago for an acute otitis media with Augmentin, and he currently has a runny nose attributed to allergies. There have been
no fevers, emesis, cough, abdominal pain, recent travel or insect bites.
His blood pressure is 95/68 mm Hg, pulse is 102 beats per minute, respirations are 20 breaths per minute, and temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F). On physical
examination, he is well appearing and his right hip is noted to be flexed with slight
abduction and external rotation. The joint is warm to touch, and he resists passive
range of motion testing. The right knee is normal, and there are no other findings
on physical examination.

ANSWERS TO CASE 33:
Transient Synovitis
Summary: The patient is a 6-year-old boy with right hip pain who is refusing to
ambulate. He appears well with normal vital signs; his examination reveals decreased
passive range of motion of the right hip.
• Next step: Perform an ultrasound to evaluate for hip effusion, consider an
arthrocentesis to evaluate synovial fluid.
• Most likely diagnosis: While it is essential to consider the serious etiologies of
pediatric hip pain, this child most likely has transient synovitis (TS).
• Best treatment for this problem: After excluding septic arthritis, osteomyelitis
and other non-benign etiologies, treat for transient synovitis with NSAIDs and
bed rest for 7 to 10 days.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical presentation of transient synovitis, and appreciate the similarities of its presentation to septic arthritis and other serious pathologies of limp.
2. Learn about the diagnosis and treatment of suspected septic arthritis.
3. Be familiar with the other etiologies of limp in a child.

Considerations
Transient synovitis is the most common cause of acute hip pain in children aged 3 to
10 years old. The arthralgia is caused by a temporary inflammation of the synovium,
the soft tissue that lines the non-cartilaginous surfaces of the hip joint. While the
etiology is not clearly understood, the disease is suspected to be secondary to an
infection as up to 50% of patients report a recent upper respiratory tract infection.
Fever typically is absent but may occur. Most patients will complain of unilateral hip
pain, and up to 5% will have bilateral pain. There is a male-to-female predominance
of slightly more than 2:1.
While this case is a typical example of transient synovitis, the diagnosis not to
miss is septic arthritis, an infection that can lead to rapid destruction of the articular
joint cartilage. This disease can lead to long-term morbidity if not diagnosed early,
and joints of the lower extremity are affected in more than 90% of the cases.
In general, children with septic arthritis will have a history of fever, malaise
and/or anorexia within the week prior to presentation. Occasionally, the presentation
is more subtle, and the symptoms may be attenuated by recent antibiotic use. Neonates and infants with septic arthritis may present with irritability, poor feeding, and
pseudoparalysis of the affected limb
On physical examination, the position of comfort will be with the hip flexed,
abducted, and externally rotated. Passive range of motion exercises will be resisted

and painful. Appropriate initial laboratory studies include complete blood count
(CBC), blood cultures, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive
protein (CRP). Plain radiographs are key to rule out obvious alternative diagnoses, and bedside ED ultrasound may identify a hip effusion. The definitive
diagnosis of septic arthritis is made by examination of synovial fluid obtained by
arthrocentesis.
Approximately 3% of children who present to the emergency department for
limp will have septic arthritis. Causative bacterial organisms vary with age group,
but Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism, followed by Group A
Streptococcus (S pyogenes) and S pneumoniae. Kingella kingae has recently become a
common pathogen in children younger than 3, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae should be
considered in neonates and sexually active adolescents. Empiric antibiotic coverage should include an antistaphylococcal agent with gram-negative coverage added
when age appropriate. Definitive treatment is by immediate surgical drainage and
washout in addition to antibiotics.

APPROACH TO:
Child With a Limp
DEFINITION
LIMP: A limp is an uneven, jerky or laborious gait, usually caused by pain, weakness, or deformity.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The differential diagnosis of the pediatric limp is broad, and the emergency physician must use a systemic approach to identify or exclude the conditions that require
emergent treatment. The cause of limp can often be determined through careful
history taking and physical examination. Laboratory tests, imaging and diagnostic
testing can then be applied to confirm clinical suspicions.

Obtaining a History
History taking is challenging in a young child who may be unable to communicate
verbally, or have difficulty localizing the site of the pain. Obtaining the following
information will help to narrow the differential.
1. Age (age specific diagnoses)
2. Onset of pain (acute versus chronic)
3. Duration of pain (intermittent, constant, or worse at particular times of day)
4. Location of pain (bone, joint, soft tissue, neurologic or intra-abdominal)
5. Preceding events (history of trauma, recent viral illness or antibiotic use)
6. Constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise, weight loss)

There is overlap among age groups, but knowing which diseases are common in
each age group is a good place to start when making a list of potential diagnoses
(Table 33–1).
Limps that are acute in onset are more likely to be due to trauma or infection.
Chronic limps are suggestive of systemic illness, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCP)
(avascular necrosis), or slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Pain that is
worse at night is more typical of a malignancy, and morning stiffness is commonly
associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The location of the pain may be typical of a musculoskeletal etiology, but referred pain and alternative diagnoses such
as appendicitis, and testicular or ovarian torsion should be entertained. A history
of trauma can suggest fracture or contusion, while a recent illness or constitutional
symptoms may direct the physician to consider osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or
transient synovitis.

Physical Examination
First, the gait should be observed if the child is ambulatory. The child should be
fully undressed, vital signs reviewed, and the general appearance of “sick or not sick”
considered. The extremities should be inspected for skin erythema, rash, tenderness, deformity, muscle atrophy and abnormal range of motion. The log roll test is
particularly useful in evaluating hip rotation. To perform the log roll test, the leg is
straightened, and the foot is manipulated medially (internal rotation of the hip) and
laterally (external rotation of the hip). Pain with this maneuver suggests inflammation, infection, or trauma.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

349

The presence or absence of a fever has not been found to be helpful in making a
definitive diagnosis. In a series of 95 children with septic arthritis, most had a lowgrade fever, but one-third were afebrile at presentation. Absence of fever should not
sway the clinician from the diagnosis.
Lastly, if there are any inconsistencies between the history and physical examination, the possibility of non-accidental trauma, or child abuse, must be explored.

Laboratory Studies
Laboratory studies are not routinely indicated in a child who has normal vital signs,
appears well, and has a history consistent with an immediate preceding trauma.
However, a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),
C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood cultures are useful if entities such as osteomyelitis, neoplasm, septic arthritis, and transient synovitis remain on the differential.
Synovial fluid analysis, which includes cell count, Gram stain, culture and sensitivity testing, may be required to distinguish between septic arthritis and transient
synovitis. A synovial fluid white blood cell count of >50,000 cells/μL with a predominance (>90%) of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes suggests septic arthritis.
The Gram stain may rapidly identify the organism, and the culture and sensitivity
results will allow the antibiotic regimen to be narrowed. Notably, synovial fluid has
bacteriostatic effects, and organisms may not grow in the routine culture. The likelihood of identifying the organism can be improved by placing a synovial fluid sample
in a blood culture medium. Finally, neonates and adolescents with a suspected septic
arthritis should be tested for gonorrhea.

Imaging Studies
In contrast to laboratory studies, most children with a limp require radiographic
evaluation. Plain films should be ordered with a minimum of two views and the
joints above and below the area of concern should be included. If possible, weightbearing views should be obtained, and if the hip is involved, the contralateral hip
should be filmed for comparison. Radiographs can identify fracture, late avascular
necrosis, soft tissue swelling, and destructive bony lesions.
A bone scan uses IV technetium 99m-labeled methylene diphosphate to identify
areas of increased cellular activity and blood flow. This test can be useful to detect
early Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, osteomyelitis, stress fractures, and osteoid osteomas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful in detecting osteomyelitis,
early avascular necrosis, and bone malignancies. Computed tomography (CT) is
rarely indicated for musculoskeletal complaints; however the test may be necessary
when intra-abdominal entities, such as appendicitis, or pelvic etiologies are in the
differential.
Ultrasound (US) is perhaps the most useful imaging study after plain films in
the evaluation of the pediatric limp. Recent studies have demonstrated that the
use of bedside ED ultrasound can reliably detect a joint effusion (Figure 33–1). In
one series of 96 children who underwent hip US for possible septic arthritis, none
of the 40 patients who had normal US findings were later discharged with the
diagnosis of septic arthritis. Early detection of a joint effusion and ultrasound guidance of arthrocentesis can decrease the time to definitive diagnosis and treatment

of septic arthritis. Additionally, the detection of bilateral hip effusions raises the
clinical suspicion for rheumatologic conditions and transient synovitis. One study
showed that up to 25% of patients with transient synovitis have bilateral effusions.

Alternate Etiologies of Pediatric Limp
Septic Arthritis is most common in children <3 years old. The male-to-female
ratio is 2:1. The hip is the most common site (80%) with the most common organism being S aureus. Others: group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, S pneumoniae,
Haemophilus influenzea type B, Kingella kingae (after URI), Salmonella (sickle cell
patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis, N gonorrhoeae, gramnegative bacilli. Pain in the affected joint, fever, edema, swelling, inability to bear
weight, anorexia, irritability, pseudoparalysis may be presenting symptoms. There
are no published clinical decision rules but a recent study notes that infection is
indicated by: (1) inability to bear weight, (2) fever, (3) ESR >40 mm/h, (4) WBC
>12,000/mm3. Though the incidence is low, when present, IV antibiotics and
surgical irrigation and debridement must be implemented immediately as disability
due to destruction of joint tissue may ensue.
Osteomyelitis of the femur or pelvis can present as hip pain. The proximal femur
is the most common site of bone infection in children, and may also involve the
joint given the intracapular location (Figure 33–2). On examination, there may be
focal erythema, swelling, and warmth near the location of the metaphysis. Similar
to septic arthritis, the presentation may be attenuated by the recent antibiotic use.
Plain films may not show bony changes until 10 to 20 days after symptoms began.
MRI is the ideal study with a sensitivity of 92% to 100%. The most common organisms are the same as those that cause septic arthritis, and patients with osteomyelitis
require empiric antibiotic therapy and emergent orthopedic consultation for bone
aspiration.

associated left hip septic arthritis. There is also extensive myositis surrounding the left hip. There is
possible pus under pressure or necrotic changes may be present in the left proximal femur.

Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (vascular necrosis of the femoral head) develops
when an insufficient blood supply to the femoral head leads to necrosis. It is commonly found in boys aged 4 to 10 years, and its cause is unknown. The child usually
presents with a limp and may complain of hip or knee pain. On physical examination, the child will have decreased range of motion at the affected hip. X-rays
may show fragmentation and then healing of the femoral head (Figure 33–3), and a
bone scan will show decreased blood perfusion to the femoral head. Ten to twenty
percent of patients will have bilateral disease, and the aim of treatment is to keep
the femoral head within the acetabulum to allow healing to occur. A brace, cast, or
splint may be required to immobilize the hip’s position. Patients should be referred
to an orthopedist for possible surgical management.
Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) remains one of the most common
disorders affecting the hip in adolescence. SCFE is characterized by the posterior
displacement of the capital femoral epiphysis from the femoral neck through the
growth plate. It is most common in obese boys aged 11 to 15 years. Children who
grow rapidly and who have hormonal imbalances such as hypothyroidism and acromegaly are also at risk. In addition to a limp, patients will complain of hip and/
or knee pain. On examination, patients will have impaired internal rotation and
passive hip flexion may be associated with compensatory external rotation. Plain
films of the hip or pelvis will often show displacement of the femoral head, commonly described as “fallen ice cream from the cone”. Approximately 30% to 60%

352

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

of patients with unilateral SCFE will eventually have SCFE of the contralateral
hip. Once the diagnosis is suspected, weight-bearing should be avoided and most
patients will require surgery to reattach the femoral head to the femur.
Toddler’s fracture is a nondisplaced fracture of the distal tibial shaft that occurs
most commonly in a child younger than 2 years who is learning to walk. Frequently,
there is no definite history of a traumatic event, and the child is brought to the office
due to reluctance to bear weight on the leg. On physical examination, maximal
tenderness can usually be elicited over the fracture site. On plain film, the typical
findings are a nondisplaced hairline spiral fracture of the tibia and no fibular fracture. It is not uncommon for initial radiographs to be normal and the diagnosis of
this fracture made several days after the injury when follow-up radiographs show a
lucent line or periosteal reaction.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

353

Osgood-Schlatter syndrome is caused by a reaction of the bone and cartilage
of the tibial tubercle to repetitive stress (eg, jumping) and is believed to represent
tiny stress fractures in the apophysis. The condition is also associated with rapid
growth spurts. Physical examination reveals tenderness and swelling over the tibial
tubercle. Running, jumping, and kneeling worsen the symptoms. The condition is
managed with ice, anti-inflammatory medication, and a decrease in activity. Daily
stretching of the quadriceps and hamstrings is also beneficial. Patients with severe
pain may require immobilization using crutches or a knee immobilizer. Individual
regulation of activity is usually effective; pain may recur until the tubercle matures
(ie, ossifies completely).

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
33.1 A 2-year-old girl presents with refusal bear weight on the left leg and a fever to
38.7°C (101.6°F) for 2 days. She has significant guarding when you attempt to
range her left hip. In consideration of the differential diagnosis, which of the
following diagnostic tests would be most useful?
A. Radiograph of both hips
B. Complete blood count
C. Blood culture
D. Ultrasound examination of the hip
33.2 The mother of an 8-year-old boy is told that her son’s limping and knee pain
is caused by Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Which of the following best explains
the condition of the femoral head?
A. Dislocation
B. Subluxation
C. Avascular necrosis
D. Dysplasia
33.3 A 5-year-old girl is brought into the emergency center due to significant hip
pain. There is no history of trauma or fall. She has had a recent respiratory
infection. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Subacute osteomyelitis
B. Transient synovitis
C. Developmental dysplasia of the hip
D. Malignant degeneration of the hip
E. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

33.4 A 13-year-old overweight adolescent boy presents to his pediatrician’s office
with chronic left hip pain for 2 months. He has a Trendelenburg gait and has
decreased range of motion of the left hip. Which of the following is the most
likely diagnosis for this patient?
A. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis
B. Transient synovitis
C. Osgood-Schlatter
D. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease
33.5 A12-month-old male infant presents with his concerned mother after rolling
off the bed in the night. X-ray reveals a femoral shaft fracture, and you note
that this child has had three other visits to the emergency department for
injury. What is your next step in management of this patient?
A. Urgent orthopedic consultation
B. Order a skeletal survey
C. Report your concerns to the appropriate child protection services
D. All of the above

ANSWERS
33.1 D. Osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and transient synovitis should be considered
in the differential of this child. Osteomyelitis and a septic arthritis are orthopedic emergencies, which require prompt intervention. Transient synovitis
is often hard to distinguish clinically from the prior two entities. To make a
definite diagnosis, an ultrasound should be performed to evaluate for an effusion and guide arthrocentesis. The synovial fluid of a septic joint will have a
marked neutrophilia.
33.2 C. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is commonly found in boys aged 4 to 8 years. It
results in avascular necrosis of the femoral head.
33.3 B. Transient synovitis is the most common cause of hip pain in children aged
3 to 10 years. Though a benign process, it is often hard to distinguish from a
septic joint or osteomyelitis. The child can be safely treated with bed rest and
anti-inflammatories.
33.4 A. SCFE is commonly found among overweight pubertal children. A Trendelenburg gait is described as the pelvis tilting downward on the unaffected
side when a patient steps on the affected side. There is also an accompanying subtle shift of the torso. Legg-Calve-Perthes is in the differential but
more common among children aged 4 to 8. Transient synovitis presents more
acutely. Osgood-Schlatter usually presents in athletic kids who have reproducible tibial tubercle tenderness.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

355

33.5 D. Child abuse should be suspected as this is likely to be a non-ambulatory
child. The mechanism sounds suspicious, was not witnessed, and there may
have been delay in seeking medical care. Treating the injury, alerting the
appropriate authorities of your concerns, and obtaining a skeletal survey is
essential for the safety of the child. A typical skeletal survey includes skull,
chest, pelvis, and entire limb x-rays.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Always order an ultrasound and perform arthrocentesis in a child with
fever who refuses to move a joint. Transient synovitis should be a diagnosis of exclusion.



Consider Legg-Calve-Perthes disease in boys aged 4 to 8 who present
with a limp as it requires a high index of suspicion.



SCFE treatment is operative and 30% to 60% will eventually have bilateral disease. To prevent delay in diagnosis of the second slip, all patients
should be followed closely by an orthopedist until the child has finished
growing.



Perform a thorough history (with and without the parent) and physical on
children who present with fractures to evaluate for possible child abuse.

CASE 34
A 16-month-old child is brought in by EMS after a witnessed tonic-clonic event at
home by his mother. The mother, a 33-year-old G2 woman, reports that he was
born vaginally at term after an uneventful pregnancy. His birth weight was 3700 g,
and he was discharged on the second hospital day. The mother noted that the
child has been well appearing, is not taking any medications and there had been
no recent travel. He had been active for the past week with no apparent complaints. The mother thinks the seizure lasted about 5 minutes but it ceased by the
time EMS arrived at the home. The vital signs on the chart include a temperature
of 38.4°C (101.1°F) (rectal), a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, a respiratory
rate of 24 breaths per minute, and a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg. On
initial evaluation, the child is well appearing, well-perfused, and in no respiratory
distress. His mental status is back to baseline per the mother, and on further
evaluation, the child has no rashes or murmurs but is noted to have a bulging
erythematous tympanic membrane. Acetaminophen is ordered and the child is
observed and reevaluated several times over the next couple of hours. No laboratory studies are ordered initially.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS TO CASE 34:
Febrile Seizure
Summary: This is a 16-month-old child with a febrile seizure and acute otitis media.
The combination of a relatively brief seizure in a febrile child in this age group who
awakens back to baseline is consistent with a diagnosis of febrile seizure. Uncomplicated presentations require a thorough history and physical examination but rarely
any additional testing. The presence of a focal infection like otitis media is common
but not essential for the diagnosis. Providing the child returns to a baseline playful
state, admission to the hospital is not necessary.
• Most likely diagnosis: Simple febrile seizure and acute otitis media
• Next step in management: Medication to reduce the fever followed by a period
of observation and reevaluation

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the specific definition of a simple febrile seizure
2. Understand current standards for an age-based approach to the evaluation of a
simple febrile seizure in the pediatric patient.
3. In cases of concurrent infection, specifically otitis media (OM), determine the
need for further evaluation and/or testing in a simple febrile seizure.

Considerations
This infant has experienced a witnessed seizure at home and is noted to be febrile but
well appearing and back at his baseline in the emergency department, and without
neurologic deficits. As with all sick emergency department patients the evaluation
begins with assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation. After the initial assessment, resuscitation and stabilization, etiology for the seizure must be investigated.
This subject can be complex considering the large number of potential causes. The
greatest immediate threat and concern is the possibility of CNS infection. Infectious
causes must be addressed before less acute etiologies are considered.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

359

APPROACH TO:
Febrile Seizures
DEFINITIONS
SIMPLE FEBRILE SEIZURE: The definition for a simple febrile seizure is very
specific: age between 6 months and 60 months, generalized tonic-clonic convulsions, spontaneous cessation of convulsion within 15 minutes, return to alert mental
status after convulsion, documentation of fever (>38.0°C), one convulsion with a
24-hour period, and absence of neurologic abnormality on examination.
COMPLEX FEBRILE SEIZURE: This heterogeneous group is beyond the scope
of this chapter. The causes, presentations, assessments, and treatments are broad and
complex. A standard treatment recommendation does not exist and the clinician
must evaluate and treat the child with a complex febrile seizure on a case-by-case
manner.
WELL-APPEARING INFANT: An infant who appears to both caretaker and
health care practitioner to interact appropriately for age, has no increased work of
breathing, has normal skin color, and no evidence of dehydration on the clinical
examination.
ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA: Bacterial (suppurative) infection of middle ear fluid
indicated by acute onset of signs and symptoms accompanied by a middle ear effusion.

CLINICAL APPROACH
A simple febrile seizure is a traumatic event for the caregiver, and in almost all cases,
the child will be brought in by ambulance, with the emergency medicine physician
evaluating the patient after the tonic clonic activity has ceased. If the child does
not appear toxic, distressed, or hemodynamically unstable, a period of observation
is recommended. During this period (usually under 1 hour), the clinician should
have a discussion with the caregiver and EMS regarding the duration of the event,
recent illnesses, and new medications. Additional useful history includes any possible exposures to chemicals or medications in the household and if there exists
a family history of seizure disorders. Also, documentation of a fever greater than
38.0°C should be obtained, and antipyretic medications can be administered (oral
or rectal based on the infants mental status).
A thorough physical examination should be performed, looking specifically for
any source of infection and clinical signs that are worrisome for bacterial meningitis (petechial rash, nuchal rigidity, failure to fully engage or to return to baseline
level of awareness, etc). The child’s entire body should be examined for any signs
of trauma or abuse such as old ecchymoses, scratches, or scars. The provider should
observe the interaction between the child and care giver to raise or lowers ones
suspicion for possible abuse.
For infants that meet the strict definition of a simple febrile seizure, further testing
(serum electrolytes, glucose, lumbar puncture, and neuroimaging) is not warranted.
Multiple retrospective studies have demonstrated the extremely low incidence of

360

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

bacterial meningitis in children with a simple febrile seizure and no clinical signs
of meningitis. Unfortunately, since the clinical presentation of bacterial meningitis
can be more subtle in children younger than 12 months of age, some experts recommend lumbar puncture even for simple febrile seizures in this population (6 months
to 12 months).
Infants with concurrent infections (bacterial enteritis, urinary tract infection, or
otitis media) with a simple febrile seizure should be treated for the underlying illness, not changing the standard management. This child was found to have a case
of acute otitis media (AOM).

Acute Otitis Media
The diagnosis of AOM requires a middle ear effusion and signs of middle ear inflammation. The disease exists on a spectrum with otitis media with effusion, which
lacks a bacterial infection or inflammation. Diagnosis of a middle ear effusion can
be confirmed on otoscopy by finding bubbles or an air-fluid level and a tympanic
membrane that is abnormally colored (not translucent), opaque, and/or not mobile
with pneumatic pressure. Acute inflammation can either be confirmed by a history
of fever and ear pain (or tugging) or direct visualization of a bulging and red tympanic membrane.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella
catarrhalis are thought to cause over 90% of cases of AOM; however, current vaccine
patterns may alter future etiologies. Complications of AOM are rare, but include
hearing loss, tympanic membrane perforation, and mastoiditis. Of most concern in
this case would be the rare complication of intracranial extension causing meningitis, brain abscess, or central venous thrombosis. These complications must be
entertained if AOM is encountered in the setting of a seizure, especially if the child
experienced a complex febrile seizure.
There exists much controversy over when to treat AOM with antibiotics. Most
professional guidelines recommend any child younger than the age of 2 be treated
with antibiotics and children older than the age of 2 may be treated with a “watchful
waiting” approach if they have mild or moderate symptoms. Amoxicillin remains
the drug of choice. The widespread use of antibiotics in the developed world is
widely thought to be responsible for the low incidence of severe complications of
AOM seen in the ED.

Risk of Seizure Recurrence
One-third of children who have a simple febrile seizure will experience another by
the age of 6 years old. Children who experience a simple febrile seizure have a small
increase in their likelihood of developing epilepsy, but the risk is still only 1% in
children that have had a simple febrile seizure.

Prevention and Treatment
Antibiotic and/or antipyretic therapy has not been shown to decrease the recurrence rates of simple febrile seizures. Caretakers can often feel overwhelmed in an
effort to reduce the fever to prevent another seizure and must be reassured that such
measures have not been shown to reduce recurrence.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

361

Continuous antiepileptic medications (eg, valproic acid, phenobarbital, etc.) are
not recommended for first-time febrile seizures.

Case Resolution
The toddler discussed above is observed in the emergency department for 1 hour. He
is noted to be playful, active, and in no distress. After a careful physical examination,
the child is discharged home with his mother to follow-up with his pediatrician. Parents should be instructed to return to the emergency department immediately for
repeat seizure, change in behavior, vomiting, etc. An expectation should be shared
that the AOM should improve within 72 hours of antibiotic treatment, and if not,
they should return to their pediatrician or the emergency department. As with any
pediatric patient, an attempt should be made to contact the patient’s primary pediatrician prior to leaving the ED.

COMPREHENSIVE QUESTIONS
34.1 A 2-year-old toddler is brought in by her family after a seizure episode today.
The family states that the child was in her normal state of health when they
noticed her entire body jerking rhythmically for several minutes, during which
she did not respond to their voice. After 1 hour, the child remained somnolent
and minimally responsive at home and was brought to the ED for evaluation.
The mother states the infant was coughing and having clear nasal discharge for
the past 24 hours, but otherwise well. The mother, a 26-year-old G4 woman,
reports that the toddler was born vaginally at term after an uneventful pregnancy. His birth weight was 3100 g, and he was discharged on the second
day. The mother states the child received his 2-month vaccinations and has
been feeding well today. The vital signs on the chart include a temperature of
39.0°C (102.2°F) (rectal), a heart rate of 140 beats per minute, a respiratory
rate of 30 per minute, and a systolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg. On the
initial evaluation (about 30 minutes after the child is brought to the emergency
department), the child is somnolent and not at baseline mental status per the
mother. Further evaluation finds no physical examination abnormalities other
than mild clear nasal discharge. The child has a normal cardiac, lung and skin
examination. Which of the following criteria indicates this was a complex
febrile seizure?
A. Age of the child involved
B. Height of the fever
C. Generalized tonic-clonic nature of the seizure
D. Lack of return to baseline mental status after convulsion
E. Preceding upper respiratory infection symptoms

362

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

34.2 A 16-month-old child is brought in by EMS after an episode of shaking visualized by mother that lasted 3 minutes. On arrival to the ED, the child is
back to baseline mental status as per mother. The mother states the infant was
coughing for the past 24 hours, but otherwise well. The mother, a 22-year-old
G1 woman, reports that he was born vaginally at term after an uneventful
pregnancy. The mother states the child received his 2-month vaccinations
and has been playful and active but was noted to have a mild nonproductive
cough for 2 days. The vital signs on the chart include a temperature of 39.3°C
(102.7°F) (rectal), a heart rate of 150 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of
34 breaths per minute, and a systolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg. On the initial
evaluation, the child is well appearing, well perfused, and in no respiratory
distress. The child has a normal cardiac, pulmonary, and has no rashes. Discharge
instructions to the parent of the above toddler should include:
A. Recommended use of around-the-clock antipyretic therapy
B. Recommend beginning continuous anticonvulsive medications to prevent
development of epilepsy.
C. Outpatient neurologic testing including electroencephalography
D. Rectal diazepam if the child becomes febrile again to prevent further
seizures
E. Appropriate follow-up with the toddler’s pediatrician and reassurance
34.3 A 36-month-old toddler is brought in by EMS after an episode of shaking
visualized by mother that lasted 12 minutes. On arrival to the ED, the child is
resting comfortable in the bed with his mother. The mother states the toddler
was tugging at his left ear and coughing for the past 2 days, but otherwise well.
The mother, a 31-year-old G4 woman, reports that he was born vaginally at
term after an uneventful pregnancy. The toddler has received all of his vaccinations and never had a seizure in the past. The vital signs on the chart
include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F) (rectal), a heart rate of 140 beats
per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 per minute, and a systolic blood pressure
of 110 mm Hg. On the initial evaluation, the child is well appearing, well perfused, and in no respiratory distress. The oropharynx is injected with injected
pharyngeal tonsils. The left tympanic membrane is erythematous and nonmobile during air insufflation. The child has a normal cardiac, pulmonary,
and has no rashes. What is the most appropriate management of the toddler?
A. Obtain laboratory testing (CBC) to determine the presence of an underlying infection
B. Neuroimaging to determine the presence of an underlying CNS infection
C. Treatment of the otitis media (OM) with conservative therapy (NSAIDs)
and instructions to follow up with the child pediatrician in 24 hours
D. Lumbar puncture to determine a meningeal infection
E. Inpatient admission for ENT consultation

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

363

ANSWER
34.1 D. A simple febrile seizure is characterized by strict criteria. If the child does
not return to their baseline mental status shortly after convulsion, even in
the setting of fever, it is considered a complex febrile seizure, and alternative
causes must be explored.
34.2 E. Research has shown that a simple febrile seizure cannot be prevented by
antipyretics or antiepileptics. After a first occurrence, the risk of future epilepsy is low, and no action need be taken initially as long as the symptoms fit
the strict criteria for simple febrile seizure.
34.3 C. This patient had a simple febrile seizure so there is a very low suspicion
for a direct extension of the acute otitis media into the intracranial space.
The AOM is the cause of the fever and likely related seizure. Given the
patient is over 2 years old, expert recommendations endorse a watchful waiting approach to treatment. An alternative acceptable approach would be
to provide antibiotics from the ED, but still ensure close follow-up with the
patient’s pediatrician.

ANSWERS TO CASE 35:
Low Back Pain
Summary: A 57-year-old warehouse worker has a 1-month history of worsening low
back pain with radiation bilaterally to his legs. The pain increased suddenly and is
now associated with perianal numbness and difficulty voiding. He denies trauma to
his back or prior surgery.
• Most likely diagnosis: Cauda equine syndrome (CES)
• Next diagnostic step: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar and
sacral spine

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Review the possible etiologies of low back pain.
2. Learn how to evaluate a patient with low back pain.
3. Identify the “red flags” associated with serious causes of low back pain.

Considerations
Low back pain is a common complaint and can be caused by a multitude of disease
processes. Although benign mechanical causes are most common, the ED physician
must consider the “cannot miss” diagnoses: cauda equina syndrome, spinal fracture,
spinal infection (epidural abscess or spondylitis), and malignancy. A careful history and physical examination are important to identify “red flags” that may herald
the presence of serious disease (Table 35–1). Most patients with back pain do not

History of cancer
Recent infection
Immunocompromise
History of intravenous drug use
Pain worse at night, lasting longer than 6 weeks, or refractory to analgesics and rest
Associated systemic symptoms (fever, unexplained weight loss, malaise, night sweats, diaphoresis,
nausea, syncope)

require any diagnostic studies in the ED. However, if a serious etiology is suspected,
laboratory studies and imaging may be necessary. In general, pain control is a high
priority for these patients. If the patient is critically ill, stabilization of the ABCs and
surgical consultation may be needed.

APPROACH TO:
Low Back Pain
CLINICAL APPROACH
Back pain is the second most common complaint that impels people to visit their
primary care physicians. Seventy to ninety percent of adults suffer from acute low
back pain during their lifetime. The differential diagnosis of low back pain is extensive. Common causes include muscle strain, ligamentous injury, osteoarthritis, disk
herniation, spondylolisthesis, and fracture. Infectious etiologies are epidural abscess,
spondylitis, diskitis, and herpes zoster. Malignancies that cause low back pain may
be primary or, more commonly, metastatic. Rheumatologic diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter syndrome are other considerations. Back pain may also
be referred from various gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecologic, and vascular
sources (most ominously from an abdominal aortic aneurysm). Miscellaneous causes
include sickle cell pain crisis and functional back pain.
The history and physical examination are important to distinguish benign causes
from potentially life-threatening ones. Table 35–2 describes the typical findings for
patients with the “cannot miss” causes of low back pain. Important historical questions include location, duration, and onset of pain; aggravating and alleviating factors; associated symptoms; work history; history of trauma; and past medical history
(including comorbidities, medications, and family history).
The ED physician should note the patient’s vital signs because any abnormalities may herald a life-threatening disease process (eg, hypotension due to sepsis or
a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm). The physical examination should screen
for signs of systemic disease and possible sources of referred back pain. If possible, gait and range of motion of the back should be observed. Inspection of the
back can identify bony abnormalities such as scoliosis and skin lesions that suggest infection (erythema, warmth) or trauma (swelling, ecchymosis). The back
should be palpated to isolate the area of maximal tenderness. Point tenderness
over the spinous processes may indicate a destructive lesion of the spine. Pain that
is severe or excessive has increased suspicion of acute spinal infection or AAA.
The neurologic examination should focus on identifying any focal weakness, dermatomal sensory loss, and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes. Straight-leg
raise (SLR) testing involves the examiner passively elevating the supine patient’s
leg (with knee extended) 30 to 70 degrees. If the SLR elicits radicular pain in the
low back radiating down the leg to below the knee, it is indicative of sciatic nerve
root irritation. This test is more sensitive (80%) than specific (40%). A positive
crossed SLR (elevation of the unaffected leg causes radicular pain in the affected
leg) is very specific (90%) but insensitive (25%). Digital rectal examination should

be performed on patients with severe pain or neurologic deficits to assess sphincter
tone and perianal sensation.
Most patients who present with low back pain do not require any diagnostic
tests or imaging studies in the ED. The history and physical examination can
help separate the majority of patients with simple, self-limited musculoskeletal
back pain from the minority with more serious underlying causes. If rheumatologic
causes, malignancy, or infection are concerns, a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and urinalysis may be helpful. Indications for plain x-rays
include age less than 18 years or older than 50 years; recent trauma; history or
suspicion of malignancy; pain lasting longer than 4 to 6 weeks; history of fever,
intravenous drug use, or immunocompromised; and progressive neurologic deficits.
Further imaging by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be
required if a strong suspicion of fracture, spinal infection, malignancy, or cauda
equina syndrome exists.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

369

Treatment
If a patient with low back pain is hemodynamically unstable, cardiac monitoring
and resuscitation with intravenous fluids is mandated. If infection is suspected,
antibiotics should be administered. Stable patients benefit from pain management.
Depending on the severity of the pain, intravenous narcotics such as morphine or
fentanyl may be required. If the pain is less severe, oral narcotics or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be sufficient. Benzodiazepines may be useful adjuncts to provide some muscle relaxation and sedation.
Patients with simple musculoskeletal back pain can be treated with pain control
(primarily acetaminophen and NSAIDs). Oral narcotics may be used for a short
period of time if the pain is not adequately controlled by the aforementioned medications. Application of local heat or ice may provide some pain relief. Although
strict bed rest was once the recommended treatment, resumption of normal daily
activities has been shown to hasten recovery and resolution of pain. Strenuous exercise should be avoided until the acute pain has subsided. Nearly all patients recover
with conservative management within 4 to 6 weeks.
Admission should be considered for patients with underlying etiologies that
require inpatient management, those with abnormal vital signs, those requiring
intravenous narcotics for pain control, and those who cannot walk.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS
35.1 D. The L4-L5 interspace is the most commonly affected.
35.2 C. Urinary retention with overflow incontinence is the most sensitive finding
for cauda equina syndrome (90%).
35.3 A. No imaging is necessary. If the patient has no risk factors in the history and
physical examination for serious disease other than sciatica, treat conservatively and do not perform any diagnostic tests in the ED.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Most patients with acute low back pain have resolution of symptoms
within 4 to 6 weeks.



Pain that interferes with sleep, significant unintentional weight loss, or
fever suggests an infectious or neoplastic cause of back pain. Low back
pain with associated bowel and bladder dysfunction is suspicious for
cauda equina syndrome.



Most patients do not require diagnostic tests or imaging studies. However, further testing may be advisable if there is a concern for rheumatologic, infectious, neoplastic processes; fracture; or cauda equina
syndrome.



Pain control is important in the management of patients with low back
pain. Acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and narcotics are all viable options.

CASE 36
A 70-year-old woman is transferred from a nursing home to the emergency department (ED) due to fever and shortness of breath. Per her daughter, the patient
has had a productive cough for 2 days and became more short of breath and less
responsive earlier today. The patient’s past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and high cholesterol. Her vital signs include temperature 38.9°C (102.1°F), heart rate 104 beats per minute, blood pressure 130/85 mm
Hg, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and room air oxygen saturation 91%
(96% with 3-L oxygen by nasal cannula). On examination, she is awake but slow to
answer questions. The daughter states that her mother is usually more alert than
this. Her skin is dry and warm to touch. Her heart sounds are regular and mildly
tachycardic without any S3 or S4. On auscultation, she has rhonchi at the right lung
base. She does not have any jugular venous distention, lower extremity edema, or
calf tenderness.

ANSWERS TO CASE 36:
Bacterial Pneumonia
Summary: A 70-year-old woman is sent from a nursing home due to fever, productive cough, and shortness of breath. On examination, she is febrile, mildly tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic on room air. She has rhonchi in the right lung base
but does not have any signs of congestive heart failure or a peripheral deep venous
thrombosis.
• Most likely diagnosis: Healthcare-associated pneumonia
• Management: Supplemental oxygen, intravenous antibiotics, blood and sputum cultures, and admission

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Define community-acquired versus hospital-acquired versus healthcare-associated
pneumonia.
2. Describe the various clinical presentations of pneumonia.
3. Learn the management of pneumonia including the best choices for empiric antibiotic administration.

Considerations
This 70-year-old woman presents with history and physical examination findings
consistent with pneumonia. Pneumonia is the most common cause of death from
infectious disease and the seventh leading cause of death overall in the United
States. Clinical presentations and common etiologic organisms vary among different patient populations. Because this patient is a nursing home resident, she is at
risk for infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria. Pneumonia may be associated
with significant morbidity and mortality, especially among immunocompromised
and elderly patients. However, prompt initiation of therapy can result in improved
patient outcomes. Treatment includes appropriate empiric antibiotics, disease assessment, and respiratory support.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

373

APPROACH TO:
Bacterial Pneumonia
DEFINITIONS
COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (CAP): Pneumonia that occurs in
a patient living in the general population or community.
HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (HAP): Pneumonia that arises 48 hours
or more after hospital admission. HAP includes ventilator-associated pneumonia
(VAP; infection which develops more than 48 to 72 hours after intubation).
HEALTHCARE-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA (HCAP): Pneumonia that
occurs in a patient with substantial healthcare contact (intravenous antibiotics,
chemotherapy, or wound care within the past 30 days; nursing home or long-term
care facility resident; hospitalization for 2 or more days within the past 90 days;
hemodialysis).

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pneumonia is caused by aspiration or inhalation of pathogenic organisms into the
lungs or less commonly by hematogenous spread. Thus patients with impaired
host defenses (mucociliary clearance or overall immune system) and those with an
increased risk of bacteremia or aspiration are at higher risk for developing pneumonia.
These higher-risk patients include the elderly, smokers, those with an impaired gag
reflex, and HIV-positive patients. Viral respiratory infections can also lead to the
development of a superimposed bacterial pneumonia.
The most common causes of CAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus
influenzae, Legionella, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydia. HAP and HCAP are most commonly due to aerobic gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter. Aspiration pneumonias are often
polymicrobial, including anaerobic organisms such as Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium. Immunocompromised patients are at risk for infection with
uncommon bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens (eg, Aspergillus, cytomegalovirus,
tuberculosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci). Although the specific etiologic organism cannot be identified with certainty without serologic or microbiologic confirmation,
historical information may help narrow the list of likely pathogens based on clinical
symptomatology and risk factors for specific infections (Table 36–1).
The typical presentation of bacterial pneumonia includes fever, productive cough
with purulent sputum, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain. However, patients at the
extremes of age may have minimal or no respiratory symptoms. Infants may be
brought to the ED for fever, irritability, or respiratory distress. The elderly may present with altered mental status, a decline in baseline function, or sepsis. Patients with
impaired immune systems may also present atypically.
The physical examination may reveal fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, or hypoxia.
Severe illness may be heralded by severe respiratory distress, marked hypoxia, cyanosis, altered mental status, or hypotension. On auscultation, wheezes, rhonchi, rales,

or bronchial breath sounds may be appreciated. Decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion suggest the presence of a pleural effusion. Patients at the extremes
of age and those who are immunosuppressed may have atypical examination findings. For example, the elderly are often afebrile (or even hypothermic). In these
patients, tachypnea may be the most sensitive sign of pneumonia
A chest x-ray is an important diagnostic tool in patients with suspected pneumonia as pulmonary infiltrates will confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, a patient
with an initial negative chest radiograph may have infiltrates that “blossom” after
rehydration or that are visualized using other types of imaging (eg, computed
tomography is more sensitive than plain x-ray). The radiographic appearance of the
infiltrates may suggest (but not definitively identify) a possible etiologic organism.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

375

For example, lobar consolidation is typical of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Klebsiella.
Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, and Haemophilus influenzae typically cause multilobar disease. Patchy infiltrates are consistent with Legionella, Mycoplasma, and
chlamydial infection. Aspiration pneumonias usually result in infiltrates in dependent areas of the lungs (posterior segment of upper lobe or superior segment of lower
lobe). Cavitary lesions, pleural effusions, and pneumatoceles may also be seen with
bacterial pneumonias. Immunocompromised patients are especially likely to have
atypical radiographic findings (eg, more diffuse or multilobar infiltrates).

Treatment
The initial management of patients with pneumonia includes assessment and, if
needed, cardiopulmonary stabilization which may require supplemental oxygen or
intubation for patients with severe respiratory distress or respiratory failure.
Antibiotics should be initiated promptly in order to decrease mortality and
improve patient outcome. Antibiotics are usually chosen based on the most
likely pathogens as determined by assessment of risk factors, clinical presentation
(including severity of symptoms and presence of sepsis), and radiographic findings. Healthy patients without any use of antimicrobials in the past 3 months with
presumed CAP are best treated with a macrolide (azithromycin). Patients with
comorbid diseases or recent antimicrobial use should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) or a β-lactam (cefpodoxime) plus a macrolide as a reasonable alternative. Patients admitted to the ICU require antibiotics that cover
a broader range of organisms. A β-lactam (ceftazidime) plus either azithromycin
or a fluoroquinolone may be used. If Pseudomonas or community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is suspected, additional
antimicrobial coverage is required. If concern for aspiration pneumonia consider
anaerobic coverage such as clindamycin.
Patients with concern for HAP or HCAP who are at a risk for multidrugresistant pathogens should receive a 3-drug combination therapy: (1) antipseudomonal cephalosporin (cefepime, ceftazidime), antipseudomonal carbapenem
(imipenem or meropenem), or piperacillin-tazobactam; (2) antipseudomonal
fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin); and (3) anti-MRSA coverage
(linezolid or vancomycin).
Those without risk factors for multi-drug–resistant (MDR) organisms may be
treated with a single agent: ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, or ertapenem.

Disposition
Factors to be considered include patient’s age and comorbidities, physical examination
and diagnostic findings, ability to tolerate oral medications, social situation, and
ability to obtain close follow-up. Obviously, any patient with unstable vital signs,
respiratory distress, hypoxia, severe infection, or intractable vomiting requires a
hospital stay.

pneumonia nor any indications for admission.
36.3 D. This patient is a candidate for inpatient treatment due to his comorbidities
and abnormal vital signs. However, he does not appear to require ICU admission. Thus, ceftriaxone and azithromycin are the best options of those listed.
36.4 C. Although these are all appropriate interventions, this patient has significant hypoxia and respiratory distress despite noninvasive supplemental oxygen
administration. Thus intubation is required.

CLINICAL PEARLS

CASE 37
A 43-year-old man is brought in on an EMS (emergency medical services) stretcher
after a syncopal episode. After obtaining a palpated pressure of 80 mm Hg systolic
and heart rate of 120 beats per minute, EMS placed an 18-gauge IV and initiated
infusing normal saline en route to the hospital. The patient relates a 3- to 4-day
history of dark, tarry stools (about 3-4 times per day). Today he passed out while
having a bowel movement. He is currently complaining of mild epigastric pain
and lightheadedness. He denies any hematemesis, hematochezia, chest pain,
shortness of breath, and any similar past episodes. He admits to drinking 1 to 2
beers each day and is not regularly under the care of a physician.
On examination, his vital signs are temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), blood pressure
92/45 mm Hg (after 900-mL IV fluid prior to arrival), heart rate is 113 beats/
minute, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths/minute. The patient is pale with dried,
dark stool covering his legs. He has mild tenderness to palpation in the epigastrium but no rebound or guarding. He does not have spider angioma, gynecomastia,
palmar erythema, or ascites. The rectal examination reveals grossly melanic stool.

ANSWERS TO CASE 37:
Gastrointestinal Bleeding
Summary: This 43-year-old man presents tachycardic and hypotensive after several
episodes of melena.
• Most likely diagnosis: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed with hemorrhagic
shock.
• Best therapy: Stabilization of the ABCs, including IV access and volume
resuscitation. Consider the use of blood products and proton pump inhibitors.
Endoscopy is indicated for early diagnosis and treatment.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the differences in presentations and outcomes between upper and lower
GI bleeding.
2. Understand the priorities, evaluations, and management of patients with GI
hemorrhage.

Considerations
This 43-year-old man is in class III hemorrhagic shock (see Case 7), because he
is hypotensive and has a heart rate of 120. These findings correlate with up 1500
to 2000 mL of acute blood loss. The most important priorities are stabilization by
addressing the ABCs, including placing two large-bore intravenous lines, giving
boluses of normal saline, and monitoring the blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and urine output. Laboratory evaluations should include complete blood count
(CBC), electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, coagulation studies, in addition
to the typing and cross matching of blood. The main priorities are to determine
whether there has been significant blood loss, maintain hemodynamic stability, and
determine if the bleeding is active. After stabilization, a focused history should be
taken to determine the probable etiology of the gastrointestinal bleeding. Chronic
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or aspirin use may indicate gastritis.
His history and physical examination do not reveal obvious causes or signs of portal
hypertension. Although the history of tar-colored stools suggest an upper GI bleeding
source and directs the initial evaluation to this source, the possibility of bleeding
distal to the ligament of Treitz (lower GI bleeding) cannot be excluded at this time.
An initial room-temperature water lavage via a nasogastric (NG) tube may identify gross blood or “coffee-ground” fluid, which may establish the diagnosis of upper
GI bleeding, determine if the bleeding is active, and determine the rate of hemorrhage. Upper endoscopy is likely to be the most valuable diagnostic and treatment
modality of choice for this patient. Differentiation of GI bleeding patients as
possessing potential upper GI bleeding sources versus lower GI bleeding sources
is important early on, because patients with upper GI bleeding have significantly

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

greater potential for rapid and large volume hemorrhage in comparison to those
with lower GI bleeding sources. Similarly, the differentiation of upper GI bleeding
patients into those with variceal bleeding and those with non-variceal bleeding is
helpful to begin empirical pharmacologic therapy with octreotide in those patients
with suspected bleeding from a variceal source.

APPROACH TO:
GI Bleeding
CLINICAL APPROACH
GI bleeding is classified as upper or lower based on whether it arises proximal
or distal to the ligament of Treitz. Common causes of upper GI bleeding include
peptic ulcer disease, esophageal or gastric varices, Mallory-Weiss tear, esophagitis,
and gastritis (Figure 37–1). The most common etiologies of lower GI bleeding are
upper GI bleeding, hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, angiodysplasia, malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, and infectious conditions (Figure 37–2). In children, Meckel
diverticulum, polyps, volvulus, and intussusception are the common causes of GI
bleeding.
GI bleeding is also classified as either overt or occult. Overt bleeding is clinically
obvious bleeding that presents as hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, melena, or
hematochezia, and occult GI bleeding is when a patient presents either with clinical
anemia and/or microcytic anemia from chronic GI tract blood loss. From the

standpoint of emergency medical care, overt GI bleeding needs to be addressed on
an urgent basis to resuscitate and control the bleeding source; whereas, occult GI
bleeding may require treatment of symptomatic anemia and referral to a gastroenterology and/or surgical specialist to identify and treat the chronic bleeding source.
When taking a history, the clinician should focus on the nature, duration, and
amount of bleeding. Classically, patients with an upper GI bleed present with
hematemesis and melena, while hematochezia suggests a lower GI source. However, this is not always the case, depending on the speed and amount of bleeding.
It is important to ask about syncope, weakness, chest pain, dyspnea, and confusion
because these symptoms suggest significant blood loss. In addition, risk factor assessment may help determine the cause of the bleeding (Table 37–1).
During the physical examination, careful attention should be paid to the vital
signs and for evidence of hypovolemic shock (tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension). Cool, pale, or diaphoretic skin suggests hypovolemia, and pale conjunctiva,
nail beds, or mucous membranes suggest anemia. If stigmata of chronic liver disease
(jaundice, caput medusae, spider angiomata, palmar erythema, and gynecomastia)
are present, variceal bleeding should be considered as a potential bleeding possibility.
The abdominal examination should focus on searching for peritoneal signs, such
as guarding and rebound, although most patients with GI bleeding do not exhibit
abdominal pain.
Bedside testing includes a rectal examination to check for hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and occult blood in the stool. All patients should have a nasogastric tube with

room temperature normal saline (NS) or water lavage. If blood is present (bright red
or “coffee ground”), an upper GI source is more likely.
After IV access is obtained, blood should be sent for complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine, coagulation studies, and type and
screen or cross-match. In patients with chest pain, dysrhythmia, or risk factors for
coronary artery disease, an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained.

Treatment
Treatment begins with stabilizing the ABCs. Intubation may be necessary to protect the patient’s airway and in preventing aspiration. IV access (large-bore peripherals or central) is a high priority. Volume resuscitation should begin with 2 L of
NS or lactated Ringer solution. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable
after crystalloid infusion, have ongoing blood loss, or whose hemoglobin is less than
7 mg/dL, packed red blood cells (PRBCs) should be transfused. Fresh-frozen plasma
and vitamin K may be indicated in patients with coagulopathies caused by liver disease or anticoagulation therapy. As a general rule, a proton pump inhibitor should
be given to patients with upper GI bleeding to decrease rebleeding rates. Surgery
is indicated for massive or refractory bleeding.
In patients with variceal bleeding, somatostatin analog such as octreotide, or
vasopressin, can be helpful. However, vasopressin has fallen out of favor because of
the side effects and the risk of end-organ ischemia.
In patient with massive variceal bleeding, balloon tamponade with a SengstakenBlakemore tube may be useful for the temporary control of bleeding, while
arrangements for definitive therapy are made.
Various modalities exist to identify the source of bleeding. In upper GI bleeding
patients, endoscopy is the study of choice because the procedure can also be
therapeutic through use of lasers, electrocoagulation, sclerosant injections, clip
placements, and band ligations. For lower GI bleeds, anoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or
colonoscopy are preferred for the localization of bleeding sources. Tagged red blood

cell (RBC) scans are an alternative in stable patients. When lower GI bleeding that
is massive or continuous, angiography can be useful to localize the bleeding, and for
some cases angiography-directed embolizations can be applied to stop the bleeding.
In general, patients with lower GI bleeding rarely exhibit hemodynamic instability
unless the process has gone on unrecognized. Similarly, most lower GI bleeding
episodes are self-limiting. The treatments for lower GI bleeding are therefore less
urgent than treatments for upper GI bleeding, and the majority of patients with
lower GI bleeding can be managed outside of an ICU environment following their
management in the emergency department. The number one priority following the
initial the management of lower GI bleeding patient is localization of the bleeding
site, so that endoscopic, interventional radiology procedure, or surgical therapy can
be implemented in the unusual event that the bleeding does not stop.

37.4 A 58-year-old woman is brought into the ED complaining of bright red bleeding per rectum that was of acute onset. She denies abdominal pain. She is
hemodynamically stable. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of
her condition?
A. Varices
B. Gastritis
C. Diverticulosis
D. Mallory-Weiss tear
E. Peptic ulcer disease

ANSWERS
37.1 E. Risk factors for peptic ulcer disease include H pylori infection, NSAID use,
alcohol use, heredity, and tobacco use.
37.2 D. Stabilization of the patient is always the first priority. The ABCs come first;
assuming that his airway and breathing are stable, then circulation is next.
Fluid administration very likely will be helpful, as the patient’s dizziness and
anxiety are signs of hypovolemic shock.
37.3 B. Endoscopy is the preferred modality to identify the source of bleeding in
upper GI bleeding. Tagged red cell studies are more commonly used for the
evaluation of lower GI bleeding.
37.4 C. This patient’s clinical presentation is suggestive of lower GI bleeding. Common causes of lower GI bleeding are diverticulosis, upper GI bleeding, hemorrhoids, angiodysplasia, malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, and infectious
conditions. Bleeding with diverticulosis is described as painless and abrupt, “as
though a water faucet was suddenly turned on.” The other choices are common causes of upper GI bleeding.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Although most GI bleeds resolve spontaneously, each case is potentially
life threatening. The main priorities are to determine whether there has
been significant blood loss and to maintain hemodynamic stability.



In upper GI bleeds, endoscopy is the study of choice because it can also
be used to treat. Anoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy are preferred
in lower GI bleeds.



In general, all patients with GI bleeding are admitted. If hemodynamically
unstable or actively bleeding, they should be admitted to an ICU setting.

ANSWERS TO CASE 38:
Congestive Heart Failure/Pulmonary Edema
Summary: This is a 63-year-old woman in respiratory distress with signs of pump
failure and fluid overload.
• Most likely diagnosis: Congestive heart failure (CHF) and pulmonary edema
• Most appropriate next step: Management of the ABCs, preload and afterload
reduction, and diuresis

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical presentation and complications of CHF.
2. Understand the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to suspected CHF.

Considerations
This 63-year-old woman is brought into the ED with signs of severe CHF: dyspnea,
tachypnea, hypoxia, hypertension, and tachycardia. Her medications include
furosemide, strongly suggesting a history congestive heart failure. This clinical
presentation is classic for a CHF exacerbation. Rapid assessment of the ABCs,
IV access, and prompt initiation of preload and afterload reduction and diuresis
are the mainstays of therapy. Supplemental oxygen should be administered. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or endotracheal intubation may be
necessary for severe cases as well as those refractory to treatment. Once the patient
is stabilized, it is important to try to identify any precipitants of the exacerbation.
Diagnostic tests should be directed at excluding myocardial infarction, a common
cause of worsening CHF.

APPROACH TO:
Congestive Heart Failure/Pulmonary Edema
CLINICAL APPROACH
Emergency physicians must be comfortable identifying and treating patients with
heart failure (HF) as this condition is the most common reason for hospitalization of
patients older than 65 and is increasing in prevalence. In addition, HF is associated
with a significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with HF have a 50% mortality
rate at 4 years after the onset of symptoms.
The right side of the heart receives blood from the peripheral circulation and
sends it to the lungs for oxygenation. The left side subsequently receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it back into the circulation. Disruption of
these functions leads to loss of normal contractile ability and HF. After HF occurs,

the heart cannot provide enough blood to meet the body’s metabolic needs or must
maintain elevated ventricular filling pressures to do so. The term “congestive”
refers to abnormal fluid retention resulting from this loss of contractility. There
are many causes of HF, the most common of which are coronary artery disease and
hypertension.
Failure of the right side of the heart results in increased systemic venous pressures
while left-sided failure causes increased pulmonary venous pressures. Each has different symptoms and physical findings (Table 38–1), although the two conditions
often occur concomitantly.
This condition can also be divided into HF due to systolic dysfunction (impaired
contractility) versus failure resulting from diastolic dysfunction (impaired ventricular relaxation and filling). Although patients with HF commonly have both types
of dysfunction, distinguishing between the two can be important because patients
with diastolic dysfunction are preload dependent. As a result, they may be sensitive
to reductions in diastolic filling volumes (due to aggressive diuresis or venodilation)
and become hypotensive.

Clinical Evaluation
During the evaluation, the clinician must be able to distinguish patients with
CHF from those with other conditions with similar clinical presentations such
as pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, and exacerbation of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Table 38–2). In addition, the clinician
must try to determine what caused the patient’s condition to decompensate. The
most common precipitants are cardiac causes (eg, myocardial ischemia or infarction) and noncompliance with medications or dietary restrictions. Other causes
include uncontrolled hypertension, valvular dysfunction, arrhythmia, infection,
volume overload, pulmonary embolism, thyrotoxicosis, and iatrogenic etiologies.
The sequence of the clinical evaluation depends on the patient’s clinical status.
Those with significant respiratory distress require aggressive interventions while a
focused history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing are performed simultaneously. If the patient is stable, a more detailed history can be obtained. Important
historical points include the onset, duration, and character of respiratory complaints;
any associated symptoms (such as chest pain or fever); past medical history (including
prior heart disease and cardiac workup); and current medications (including recent
changes in doses and any missed doses).

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Table 38–2 • DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES OF HEART FAILURE
Dyspnea
• Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation
• Pneumonia
• Pneumothorax
• Pulmonary embolus
• Pleural effusion
• Physical deconditioning or obesity
Peripheral edema
• Deep venous thrombosis
• Hypoproteinemia (liver failure, nephrotic syndrome, renal failure)
Decreased cardiac output
• Acute myocardial infarction
• Drug effect
• Pericardial tamponade
• Valvular insufficiency
• Dysrhythmia
• Tension hydro- or pneumothorax

On examination, patients with CHF may show signs of hypoperfusion: clammy
skin, delayed capillary refill, and thready pulses. If the patient is hypotensive, intraarterial blood pressure monitoring is important because noninvasive measurements
are often inaccurate in vasoconstricted individuals. Patients may have crackles,
rales, or wheezes on auscultation. An S3 or S4 is common but may be difficult to hear
in a busy ED. The cardiac examination may also reveal the murmur of a ventricular
septal defect or acute mitral regurgitation or the irregularly irregular rhythm of atrial
fibrillation—all of which can precipitate acute pulmonary edema. The ED physician
should also note any jugular venous distention or peripheral edema.
Although x-ray findings may lag behind clinical symptoms by up to 6 hours, chest
radiography still provides valuable information for the clinician. In early CHF, the
chest x-ray shows upper zone vascular redistribution (cephalization). As the pulmonary
congestion increases, interstitial edema and Kerley B lines become prominent, followed
by opacification of the air spaces with alveolar edema. Other findings may include
cardiomegaly and pleural effusions. The x-ray may also help exclude other causes of
dyspnea and respiratory distress (eg, pneumothorax or pneumonia).
Laboratory studies should include complete blood count, electrolytes, blood
urea nitrogen/creatinine, and urinalysis. If there is a suspicion of acute coronary
syndrome, cardiac enzymes should be sent. The B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
is a hormone released from the ventricles in response to stretch. It is most useful
in patients with a mixed clinical picture (eg, a patient with CHF and COPD).
Levels less than 100 pg/mL make HF unlikely and those greater than 500 pg/mL
make it highly likely. Levels between these two extremes are indeterminate. The
BNP level also has prognostic significance and can be used to monitor response
to therapy. In obese patients, BNP levels tend to be lower than expected based on

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

391

the observed symptoms. Furthermore, BNP levels may lag behind the patient’s
clinical picture. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are helpful in detecting evidence of
cardiac ischemia or infarction and arrhythmias. Liver enzymes may be of use in
patients with hepatomegaly, and lactate levels in those with suspected cardiogenic
shock.

Treatment
Treatment of cardiogenic pulmonary edema consists of oxygenation, vasodilation,
diuresis, and augmentation of cardiac contractility if needed. High-flow oxygen should
be the first intervention. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation via continuous or
biphasic positive airway pressure may be necessary if hypoxia continues. Ultimately,
the patient may require intubation if refractory to the aforementioned interventions.
Vasodilation is obtained by reducing preload. This is most effectively and rapidly
achieved with nitroglycerin, which can be given via sublingual, topical, or intravenous routes. In the critically ill patient, intravenous nitroglycerin is best. Diuresis with
furosemide or bumetanide effectively reduces intravascular volume and preload, thus
reducing pulmonary congestion. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors may play a role in preload reduction and in the treatment of CHF. Morphine is no longer recommended as standard therapy for CHF due to an association
with increased rates of intubation and ICU admission. If patients do not improve with
this therapy, an inotrope, such as dobutamine, may be given to increase myocardial
contractility. If the patient is hypotensive, dopamine is a useful vasopressor.

38.2 B. Left-sided heart failure can present with dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, tachypnea, crackles or wheezes, and an S3 or S4 gallop.
The lack of jugular venous distension and/or hepatomegaly suggests absence of
right-sided heart failure.

The most common causes of CHF include coronary artery disease and
hypertension while the most common causes of an acute exacerbation
are myocardial ischemia or infarct and noncompliance.

ANSWER TO CASE 39:
Cocaine Intoxication
Summary: This 25-year-old woman was arrested while attempting to burglarize a grocery store. She lost her job because she was late and stealing, secondary to her desire
to “smoke.” She has required more and more of the drug to get high and has been
unsuccessful in her attempts to quit “smoking.” She suffers from cravings, sleepiness,
depression, and hyperphagia when she is unable to “smoke.” While high, the patient
feels euphoric and a sense of heightened energy. Her pupils are widely dilated; she
has a low-grade fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. She has unintentionally lost
30 lbs over 6 months.
• Most likely diagnosis: Cocaine intoxication

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical manifestations of cocaine intoxication.
2. Know the treatment for acute cocaine intoxication.

Considerations
This patient has many of the clinical signs and symptoms of cocaine intoxication.
Cocaine, a sympathomimetic with local anesthetic characteristics, has potent vasoconstrictive properties. Acute cocaine intoxication can be a medical emergency.
Rapidly fatal complications include severe hypertension (with concomitant endorgan damage), hyperthermia, and dysrhythmia. The mainstays of treatment are
benzodiazepines (often in large dosages) and supportive measures. β-Blockers are
contraindicated due to the risk of unopposed α-adrenergic stimulation. Acute
cocaine intoxication may be difficult to distinguish from other conditions such as
heat stroke, sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, intoxication with other sympathomimetics/anticholinergics, thyrotoxicosis, and infections or structural lesions of the
central nervous system.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

397

APPROACH TO:
Cocaine Intoxication
CLINICAL APPROACH
Cocaine is the second most commonly used illicit drug, second only to marijuana.
With such widespread use, ED visits related to cocaine intoxication and its complications have risen substantially. A recent study shows that 14% of people older than
12 years have tried cocaine. Before the mid 1980s, the main routes of administration were intranasal and intravenous injection of cocaine hydrochloride. During the
1980s, crack cocaine emerged as the form of choice. Frequently, cocaine is combined
with other drugs for various effects. Examples include mixing with heroin (“speedball”) or alcohol (“liquid lady”).
Cocaine causes release of norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.
This leads to a general stimulatory state including vasoconstriction and increased
myocardial contractility. Cocaine also acts as a local anesthetic through sodium
channel blockade. This effect is also responsible for many of the dysrhythmias and
conduction abnormalities associated with cocaine use.
Symptoms of cocaine intoxication include euphoria, feelings of power or aggression, agitation, anxiety, hallucinations (classically formication, a tactile sensation
of insects crawling on the skin), and delusions. Physical examination may reveal
mydriasis, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tremors, or seizures.
Coingestants or contaminants may result in atypical presentations (eg, cocaine plus
heroin: mixed sympathomimetic-opioid presentation).
Table 39–1 lists the acute complications of cocaine intoxication. The effects on
the cardiovascular and neurologic systems are of major concern. Severe dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, seizures, and subarachnoid hemorrhage may result and
potentially kill the patient. Body packers, who swallow cocaine wrapped in packets
to smuggle it into the country, may die precipitously if a packet ruptures. Patients
with seizures, altered mental status, dysrhythmias, or hemodynamic instability are

at increased risk of developing rhabdomyolysis, which may in turn result in renal
failure. Half of those who develop acute renal failure die.
Chest pain is a frequent complaint of those who present to the ED after cocaine
use. Cocaine causes coronary vasoconstriction while also increasing the myocardial
oxygen demand and platelet aggregation. The ED physician must maintain a high
index of suspicion for myocardial ischemia and infarction, even with an atypical history and normal initial ECG; between 0.7% and 6% of these patients will have an
acute myocardial infarction. These patients are typically younger, nonwhite, cigarette smokers without other risk factors for coronary artery disease. Benzodiazepines,
often in large doses, are useful in treating cocaine-induced chest pain. If acute coronary syndrome is suspected, aspirin, nitrates, and morphine are advisable. a-blockers
should not be used due to the risk of an unopposed `-adrenergic effect, leading
to increased hypertension and coronary vasoconstriction. Thrombolytic therapy
of an acute myocardial infarction should be avoided if coronary vasospasm or dissection is suspected or severe, uncontrolled hypertension exists. Emergent coronary
artery catheterization may provide the best diagnostic information.
For patient with hyperthermia or agitation, a basic metabolic panel and creatine kinase help rule out renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. If
coronary ischemia or infarction is suspected, ECGs and cardiac enzymes should be
obtained. The ECG may reveal conduction abnormalities (including widened QRS
complexes), dysrhythmias, or ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities consistent with
myocardial ischemia or infarction. Patients with altered mental status or seizures
should have a computed tomography of the head performed.
In general, patients with acute cocaine intoxication require only supportive care
including monitoring and intravenous fluids. Agitation is best controlled using benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam. Phenothiazines (such as haloperidol) should be
avoided because they may lower the seizure threshold, contribute to hyperthermia, and
have dysrhythmic effects. Atrial dysrhythmias may respond to benzodiazepines or other
standard therapies (except β-blockers). Intravenous sodium bicarbonate administration
may be useful for wide-complex tachycardias (or lidocaine if the dysrhythmia is refractory to bicarbonate). The drug of choice to treat severe hypertension is the α-antagonist
phentolamine. Intravenous nitroglycerin or nitroprusside may also be used. Again,
β-blocking agents should be avoided. Even labetalol (mixed α- and β-blocker) has been
associated with excess morbidity and mortality in animal studies of cocaine toxicity. Seizures are treated with benzodiazepines. Hyperthermia requires continuous monitoring of
core temperature and rapid cooling. Patients with rhabdomyolysis require increased fluid
resuscitation in order to maintain 1 to 3 mL/kg/h of urine output.
Asymptomatic body packers may be carefully monitored and given activated
charcoal and polyethylene glycol to hasten the passage of the packets of cocaine.
These packets usually contain ten times the lethal dose of cocaine and are rapidly
fatal if ruptured. If the patient becomes hypertensive, hyperthermic, or agitated or
manifests other signs of cocaine intoxication, benzodiazepines should be given and
surgery should be emergently consulted for operative removal of the packets. Endoscopy is usually avoided due to a risk of packet perforation.
The patient who responds to sedation and has no further complications may
be discharged from the emergency department after a period of observation.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

Patients with ongoing chest pain, ECG changes, enzyme elevations or requiring
ongoing pharmacologic treatment should be admitted to a monitored bed for further
observation. Body packers need to be observed until all packets have passed.

mm Hg) associated with chest pain and dyspnea. His urine drug screen is positive for cocaine metabolites. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Albuterol intravenously
B. Ephedrine intravenously
C. Labetalol intravenously
D. Lorazepam intravenously
39.3 A 35-year-old man is brought to the ED with altered level of consciousness,
drowsiness, and pinpoint pupils. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient?
A. Activated charcoal
B. Bicarbonate
C. Lorazepam
D. Naloxone

ANSWERS
39.1 D. Phencyclidine intoxication often presents with agitation, superhuman
strength, and rotatory or vertical nystagmus.
39.2 D. Benzodiazepines should be used as the first-line agent for nearly all cocaine
toxicities. The hypertension is caused by sympathetic stimulation. β-Blockers
are contraindicated because they can result in unopposed α-adrenergic stimulation and exacerbation of the chest pain and hypertension. Hypertension
not responsive to benzodiazepines may require intravenous phentolamine, an
α-adrenergic antagonist.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

39.3 D. This patient likely has an opiate intoxication (drowsiness and pinpoint
pupils). Cocaine intoxication usually causes agitation and dilated pupils.
Naloxone counteracts the effect of opioids.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The clinical manifestations of cocaine intoxication result from sympathetic overstimulation and vasoconstriction.



Cocaine intoxication can cause life-threatening complications, such as
dysrhythmias, hyperthermia, and hypertensive emergencies.



Cocaine can cause a quinidine-like effect, prolonging the QT interval and
leading to wide-complex dysrhythmias, bradycardia, and hypotension.



β-Blockers are avoided in patients with cocaine intoxication because of
the risk of unopposed α-adrenergic stimulation.



Benzodiazepines are a mainstay of treatment for cocaine toxicity and
many of its complications.

CASE 40
An 18-year-old woman is brought by a friend to the emergency department (ED)
about 30 minutes after she took “a bunch” of Tylenol. The patient states she was
upset with her parents who grounded her after she came home late from a party;
she swallowed half a bottle of extra-strength Tylenol in order to “make them feel
sorry.” She is tearful, says she was “stupid,” and denies any true desire to hurt
herself or anyone else. She has no other complaints and denies any past attempts
to hurt herself. On examination, her blood pressure is 105/60 mm Hg, heart rate
is 100 beats per minute, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute (crying).
Her pupils are equal and reactive bilaterally. Her sclera is clear, and her mucous
membranes are moist. The lungs are clear and the heart sounds are regular. The
abdominal examination is benign with normal bowel sounds. She is awake and
alert without any focal neurologic deficits.

ANSWERS TO CASE 40:
Acetaminophen Toxicity
Summary: This is an 18-year-old woman with an acute acetaminophen overdose
30 minutes prior to arrival in the ED. She is alert and oriented with stable vital signs.
• Most appropriate next step: Obtain IV access; send appropriate laboratory studies; administer activated charcoal; evaluate need for N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
• Potential complications: Hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, hepatic failure,
and renal failure
• Mechanism: Production of toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine
(NAPQI)

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the general approach to the poisoned patient.
2. Recognize the clinical signs and symptoms of acetaminophen toxicity.
3. Understand the evaluation and treatment of patients with acetaminophen
toxicity.

Considerations
Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the most commonly used analgesics and antipyretics. It is available in a variety of prescription, over-the-counter, and combination medications labeled for fever, cold, cough, and pain relief. As a result, it is
the most common over-the-counter agent reported in accidental and intentional
overdoses, leading to more hospitalizations after overdose than any other pharmaceutical agent. A toxic exposure to APAP is suspected when more than 200 mg/kg
or more than 10 g is ingested in a single dose or over the course of 24 hours. In
addition, an ingestion of more than 150 mg/kg or more than 6 g per day for at least
2 consecutive days is potentially toxic. Hepatotoxicity is the most life-threatening
complication, but may be indolent; thus, serum APAP level and a precise time of
ingestion are important to plot on a nomogram to assess likelihood of toxicity. This
patient was forthcoming about the medication used in the overdose; however, many
patients will underreport or deny the use of APAP. Consequently, an APAP level
should be drawn on all suspected overdose patients. Although clinical evidence of
hepatotoxicity may be delayed for 24 to 72 hours, NAC therapy is most effective
if started within 8 hours of ingestion. Because this patient reported the ingestion
within 30 minutes, there is time for a serum APAP level, activated charcoal decontamination, and then NAC therapy. If time is an issue, NAC treatment should be
initiated without delay. Emesis should not be induced because of the possible delay
in therapy. After medical stabilization, assessment of suicide potential is important.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

403

APPROACH TO:
Acetaminophen Toxicity
CLINICAL APPROACH
Although APAP is safe at therapeutic dosages, ingestions more than 200 mg/kg
can lead to liver failure and death. Under normal circumstances, most APAP is
metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Of the remainder, approximately 5% is excreted unchanged in urine. Another 5% is metabolized by the
hepatic cytochrome P450 system to form NAPQI. This toxic intermediate is then
detoxified by conjugation with glutathione. In acute APAP overdose, glutathione
depletion leads to accumulation of NAPQI which then binds to hepatocyte intracellular proteins causing toxicity. APAP toxicity can be divided into four clinical
phases (Table 40–1).

Clinical Evaluation
When approaching the poisoned or overdose patient, the clinician’s priorities are
to perform a rapid assessment, stabilize the ABCs, decontaminate, minimize absorption, and administer any antidotes. Important historical information includes type,
amount, and timing of ingestion; current symptoms; circumstances of the ingestion (accidental or intentional); and possible coingestants. The physical examination should focus on the abdomen (RUQ tenderness) and mental status (signs of
encephalopathy). A complete physical examination is important to search for any
concomitant toxic syndromes (toxidromes) (Table 40–2). Table 40–3 lists common
antidotes. Consulting with the local poison control center is also recommended for
any suspected ingestion or overdose.
Diagnostic studies include serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine, glucose, liver enzyme levels, coagulation studies, and urinalysis (as well as
pregnancy test if appropriate). Because coingestion is common, a toxicology screen
and salicylate level should be obtained. An ECG should be obtained to evaluate
for dysrhythmias associated with other ingestants and electrolyte abnormalities.

If the patient’s mental status is altered, a computed tomography (CT) scan of
the head is also recommended. However, the single best predictor of the risk of
hepatotoxicity is a serum APAP level. This should be drawn 4 hours postingestion,
or immediately if the time of ingestion is unknown. Using the APAP level and
the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, the clinician can then predict the severity of
toxicity and determine the need for NAC therapy (Figure 40–1). The APAP level
between 4 and 24 hours is plotted; if the level falls above the lower line, known
as the treatment line, NAC should be initiated. This nomogram is not applicable
for chronic ingestions, delayed ingestions, unknown time or duration of ingestion,
extended release APAP, or coingestions.

Treatment
Initial treatment of the patient with an APAP overdose consists of stabilizing the
ABCs, obtaining IV access, and placing the patient on cardiac and oxygen saturation monitors. Gastric lavage is rarely necessary due to the rapid gastrointestinal
absorption of APAP. Activated charcoal can reduce gastric absorption of the drug
but may also adsorb oral NAC. Thus, if activated charcoal is given, separating the
first dose of NAC and activated charcoal by 1 to 2 hours may be preferable. NAC,
the antidote for APAP toxicity, acts by replenishing glutathione stores and combining with NAPQI as a glutathione substitute. It is most effective when given within
8 hours of ingestion. The indications for NAC include a toxic level as determined
using the Rumack-Matthew nomogram or evidence of hepatic failure. NAC can be
empirically started if an APAP overdose is suspected and an APAP level will not be
available within 8 hours of the ingestion; the NAC can then be discontinued if the
APAP level is nontoxic and the patient is asymptomatic. Any patient who requires
NAC treatment should be admitted to the hospital. Although the nomogram is not
applicable for ingestions greater than 24 hours prior to ED arrival, NAC therapy
may still be helpful.

If the patient has intractable vomiting or fulminant hepatic failure, intravenous
NAC may be indicated (150 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 hours,
followed by 100 mg/kg over 16 hours). Intravenous NAC should be used cautiously
as rate-related anaphylactoid reactions can occur.
A small fraction of patients will develop fulminant hepatic failure, associated
with a 60% to 80% mortality rate. Most deaths associated with liver failure occur
3 to 5 days postingestion, attributed to cerebral edema, sepsis, hemorrhage, multiorgan failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

ANSWERS
40.1 D. Theophylline has a very narrow therapeutic index, with toxic effects of
tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and seizures.
40.2 A. At 24 hours postingestion, NAC therapy may still be useful. Due to the
historically toxic exposure, NAC should be started while a serum APAP level
and liver enzymes are checked. If the APAP level is undetectable and the
liver enzymes are normal, subsequent doses of NAC can be discontinued. The
Rumack-Matthew nomogram is not applicable for ingestions more than
24 hours prior to evaluation.
40.3 C. A serum APAP should be drawn 4 hours postingestion; the nomogram has
relevance between 4 hours and 24 hours postingestion.
40.4 D. Once it is determined by the nomogram that the APAP dose is potentially
toxic, the entire NAC regimen is given. No further APAP levels need to be
drawn.
40.5 D. Glucagon is effective in treating calcium-channel blocker or β-blocker
overdose.
40.6 A. This patient is likely receiving magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis,
and the antidote for hypermagnesemia is calcium gluconate.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

40.7 F. Naloxone is the treatment of choice for opiate overdose. This individual
likely is a heroin abuser.
40.8 H. This patient likely has warfarin overdose, which is treated by vitamin K.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Because the devastating effects of APAP toxicity may be delayed for 24 to
72 hours and antidotal therapy is most effective if started within 8 hours
of ingestion, the clinician must have a high level of suspicion of APAP
toxicity in any poisoned patient.



APAP toxicity is caused by the formation of a toxic metabolite, N-acetylp-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI).



N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the antidote for APAP toxicity and should be
given if a toxic ingestion is suspected (based on ingested dose or APAP
level and Rumack-Matthew nomogram).



The priorities when dealing with a patient with an APAP overdose are to
perform a rapid assessment, stabilize the ABCs, decontaminate, minimize absorption, and administer NAC if appropriate.



In general, an APAP level should be drawn on any patient with an overdose history even when APAP ingestion is denied.

CASE 41
A 30-year-old woman with a history of sickle cell disease presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining of chest pain for 2 days. She states that the
pain is right sided, worse with inspiration, and is more severe than her usual
“crisis pain.” She has subjective fevers, mild shortness of breath, and a productive cough. She denies vomiting, hemoptysis, or lower extremity swelling. Her last
pain crisis was 3 months ago. She usually takes acetaminophen and hydrocodone
for pain control during her crises, however, neither have been able to provide sufficient relief during this episode. On physical examination, her temperature is 38.3
°C (101°F), blood pressure is 126/65 mm Hg, heart rate is 98 beats per minute,
respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room

ANSWERS TO CASE 41:
Sickle Cell Crisis
Summary: This is a 30-year-old woman with a history of sickle cell disease who
presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough. She is febrile, tachypneic,
and hypoxic.
• Most concerning issue: Acute chest syndrome.
• Initial management: Supplemental oxygen, IV hydration, analgesia, and antibiotics.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical signs and symptoms of sickle cell crisis and its associated
complications.
2. Understand the diagnosis and treatment of acute chest syndrome.
3. Understand the treatment of pain crises in patients with sickle cell disease.

Considerations
Sickle cell disease is common, affecting approximately 1 in every 400 African
Americans and 1 in 16,000 Asian Americans. It can affect almost any organ system
and has a wide variety of clinical presentations. Acute chest syndrome is the leading
cause of death and second leading cause of hospitalization among patients with
sickle cell disease. Acute chest syndrome can present primarily or develop after a
sickle cell patient is hospitalized for a vasoocclusive crisis. The clinician’s priorities
are to differentiate the mild from the life-threatening crises and to treat them.
The patient in this case, a 30-year-old woman with known sickle cell disease,
has acute onset of chest pain, cough, fever, and subtle findings on the pulmonary
examination. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on room air, which is concerning, and
should be followed up with an arterial blood gas. Pulmonary embolism, pneumonia,
and acute chest syndrome should be considered as possible diagnoses, as individual
or concomitant conditions. The chest radiograph can be helpful. Acute chest syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that includes chest pain and tachypnea. It
can result from infectious or noninfectious (eg, pulmonary infarct) causes. It usually
presents with some combination of chest pain, fever, hypoxia, and a new pulmonary
infiltrate on chest radiography. Often, acute chest syndrome and pneumonia cannot be distinguished initially. Therefore, it is prudent to treat these patients with
antibiotics, obtain a Gram stain and culture of the sputum, and admit them to the
hospital. The treatment for acute chest syndrome is supportive and includes oxygen,
intravenous fluid hydration, and analgesia. All patients with sickle cell disease who
present to the ED require close follow-up with a hematologist.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

413

DEFINITIONS
ACUTE CHEST SYNDROME: The presence of a new lobar or segmental infiltrate on chest radiography in the presence of fever, respiratory symptoms, and/or
chest pain in patient with sickle cell disease.
VASOOCLUSIVE CRISIS: Painful episodes resulting from intravascular sickling
causing obstruction of blood flow in the microcirculation leading to tissue ischemia
and microinfarction.
SPLENIC SEQUESTRATION: Occurs when red cells become trapped in the
spleen, resulting in a rapidly enlarging spleen, a sudden drop in hemoglobin, and
the potential for shock.
APLASTIC CRISIS: A transient cessation of erythropoiesis resulting in the acute
onset of anemia and reticulocytopenia. The most common cause of aplastic crisis
appears to be infection, specifically parvovirus.

APPROACH TO:
Sickle Cell Crisis
CLINICAL APPROACH
Sickle cell disease is caused by abnormal hemoglobin production. In humans, hemoglobin is composed of two alpha and two beta chains. However, in sickle cell disease,
hemoglobin S (HbS) results when a valine is substituted for glutamine in the sixth
position of the beta chain. Under hypoxic or acidotic conditions, this abnormal
hemoglobin polymerizes and sickles, resulting in sludging in the microcirculation. In
turn, this causes tissue hypoxia, ischemia, acidosis, and more sickling.
The gene for HbS is autosomal recessive. Patients who are heterozygous (sickle
cell trait) are generally asymptomatic except under extreme stress (eg, severe dehydration, temperature, or pressure change), but do tend to be more susceptible than the
general population to urinary tract infections. Those who have sickle cell disease
(homozygous), in contrast, are highly susceptible to vasoocclusion and pain crises.
Potential triggers for sickle cell crises are numerous. Some common triggers
include infections (bacterial and viral), dehydration, exposure to cold temperatures,
low oxygen environments such as airplane travel or smoke-filled rooms, and trauma.
It should be recognized, however, that spontaneous, unexplained crises are common.
Because these patients are functionally asplenic after early childhood, they are also
at significant risk for bacterial infections, especially by encapsulated organisms such
as Salmonella typhi, Haemophilus influenza type B, Streptoccoccus pneumoniae, Neisseria
meningitides, and Group B streptococci. In fact, the highest rate of mortality occurs
in children between the ages of 1 and 3 years as a consequence of sepsis.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

COMMON COMPLICATIONS
Sickle cell crisis can affect multiple organ systems (see Table 41–1). During the
assessment of patients with sickle cell disease, the history should focus on identifying
any precipitating causes and complications. Pain that is different from previous
pain crises may be an indicator of a potentially life-threatening event. A rapid assessment of the vital signs and a careful physical examination are important, because
severe complications in sickle cell crisis often present with nonspecific manifestations. The clinician’s concern should be heightened if the patient has a fever, severe
abdominal pain, respiratory or neurological symptoms, joint swelling, priapism, or
pain that is not relieved by usual measures.

Vasoocclusive Crisis
Acute vasoocclusive events (VOEs) or “painful crisis” are the most common complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) and the most frequent cause of ED visits in this
patient population. Polymerization of the sickle cell hemoglobin causes the red blood
cells to become rigid and sticky and formed into shapes that sometimes have the
appearance of a sickle, hence the name. These sickled cells subsequently will cause
obstruction of the microvasculature. It is probable that a multitude of factors contribute to VOEs, including red cell function, blood viscosity, adherence of sickled cells
to endothelium, and environmental factors. Patients may live in a homeostatic balance with circulating sickle cells, but a seemingly minor event such as a viral illness,
dehydration, trauma, or exercise may tip this balance resulting in a full-blown VOE.
Dactylitis, or hand-foot syndrome, may be the first clinical manifestation of
SCD. Infarctions in the metacarpals result in episodes of pain and swelling involving
the hands and feet. Infants and toddlers with dactylitis may become irritable, refuse
to walk, or cry when touched or held. As children with SCD get older, pain shifts
to the arms, legs, back, and pelvis, whereas adolescents may also complain of involvement of the chest and abdomen. These vasoocclusive episodes usually last from 3 to
9 days, but it is not atypical for those patients with longer episodes to continue to
have patterns where their episodes remain prolonged.

Infection
Infection is the major cause of mortality in SCD. Virtually all patients with SCD
are asplenic, predisposing them to overwhelming infections from encapsulated
microorganisms. In addition to sepsis, patients are susceptible to other infections
such as pneumonia, meningitis, and osteomyelitis. Although prophylactic penicillin and vaccines for pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae type B have reduced
the incidence of sepsis in this patient population, pneumococcal sepsis remains a
significant cause of death in children with SCD. Adults are less vulnerable because
their immune systems have matured to allow for type-specific antibody production;
however, fever must be taken very seriously in all patients with SCD.

Acute Chest Syndrome
Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the presence of a new lobar or segmental pulmonary infiltrate in the presence of fever, respiratory symptoms, or chest pain.
Various causes may contribute to ACS including infection, pulmonary infarction

due to vasoocclusion, and fat emboli from marrow infarction. Chest pain from vasoocclusion may cause splinting and hypoventilation, leading to the development of
ACS in a patient who initially presents with a painful episode. Infectious organisms
associated with ACS include S Pneumoniae in younger children and Mycoplasma or
Chlamydia in adolescents. Acute chest syndrome carries a high risk of progression
to respiratory failure and should be considered in all SCD patients with respiratory
signs or symptoms.
All patients with ACS should be admitted to the hospital. The finding of an
infiltrate on chest radiograph is diagnostically significant, but it should be recognized that it is common for the initial radiograph to be normal. Laboratory evaluation should include a CBC, reticulocyte count, blood and sputum cultures, and type
and screen. A baseline arterial blood gas (ABG) measurement should be obtained,
followed by serial ABG measurements to evaluate for worsening A-a gradient. In
patients with ACS and hypoxemia (PaO2 = 70 to 80 mm Hg, O2 saturation of 92%95%), supplemental oxygen should be administered via nasal cannula at a rate of
2 liters per minute. Exchange (or conventional) transfusion should be initiated in
patients with hypoxia or a drop in hemoglobin >2 g below baseline. All patients
should receive empiric antibiotics that cover typical and atypical microorganisms,
(most commonly with a macrolide and third generation cephalosporin). Analgesia
for chest pain should be provided but managed carefully to prevent hypoventilation.
Regular use of an incentive spirometer has shown to significantly reduce the frequency of subsequent episodes of chest pain. Intravenous fluids given to patients with
ACS should not exceed 1.5 times maintenance in order to prevent volume overload.

Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accidents)
Patients with SCD are at greatly increased risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke. Most strokes in children are ischemic events, usually involving large arteries,
whereas hemorrhagic strokes are more common in adults. Common presenting signs
and symptoms include hemiparesis, aphasia, dysphasia, cranial nerve palsies, seizure, or coma. A noncontrast enhanced CT scan should be obtained as soon as possible, followed by MRI and MRA with diffusion weighted imaging. The treatment
for ischemic stroke in children is exchange transfusion, as conventional therapies
(tissue plasminogen activator and antiplatelet agents) are not indicated. Ischemic
strokes in adults with SCD are thought to be more likely due to common ischemic
stroke mechanisms; therefore conventional therapies are recommended.

Splenic Sequestration
Acute splenic sequestration is the most common cause of acute exacerbation of
anemia in patients with SCD. This occurs when red cells become trapped in the
spleen, resulting in a sudden drop in hemoglobin and the potential for shock. It
typically occurs between the ages of 3 months to 5 years. Patients typically present with sudden weakness, pallor, tachycardia, or abdominal fullness. The mortality
of this condition is high, and death can occur within a matter of hours without
aggressive management. All patients should be transfused with packed red blood
cells emergently. Splenectomy may be necessary in children with recurrent splenic
sequestration.

418

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Aplastic Crisis
Patients with SCD are susceptible to transient red cell aplasia (TRCA). The majority of TRCA are caused by Parvovirus B19 infection. The virus is directly cytotoxic
to erythroid precursors, which can cause transient suppression of erythropoiesis and
reticulocytopenia. This will present as significant anemia after an illness without
signs of hemolysis, usually 5 days postexposure and continuing 7 to10 days. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion is the standard treatment once the diagnosis
is made.

Priapism
Priapism, a prolonged painful erection of the penis, is a well-recognized complication of SCD that can result in fibrosis and impotence. Approximately 50% of
patients with SCD reported having at least one episode of priapism before 21 years
of age. In addition to pain management, effective strategies for immediate and sustained detumescence consist of aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa followed by irrigation of the corpora cavernosa with dilute epinephrine. In all cases,
early urologic consultation should be obtained.

Treatment
It is important to note that pain is often the primary presenting complaint of all
sickle cell–associated crises. It is thought that pain is caused by ischemia secondary
to sickling. This causes sludging and local acidosis, which in turn engenders more
sickling and the pain worsens.
Unfortunately, recent evidence shows that patients with sickle cell disease are
regularly undertreated for their pain. This is likely due to sociocultural factors as
well as the challenges of navigating the subjectivity of pain. Adequately treating
pain is a vital component in the treatment of sickle cell patients who present to the
emergency department.
The mainstay of treatment for a pain crisis is supportive care: supplemental
oxygen, hydration, and analgesia. Due to the chronicity of these pain crises, and the
long-standing pain that results from sickle cell complications (eg, avascular necrosis),
adequate analgesia plays a pivotal role in patient care. Patients with moderate to
severe pain typically require intravenous opiates. In patients with poor vascular
access secondary to chronic intravenous line placement, subcutaneous and intramuscular administration is a suitable alternative. Oral opiates are used for patients
in less severe pain. Although there are no definitive studies that show which opioid
is superior in treating a pain crisis, morphine sulfate or hydromorphone are commonly used as first-line agents. Hydromorphone is a good option for patients who
cannot tolerate the side effects of morphine (eg, nausea and pruritus). Meperidine,
a commonly prescribed opioid, should be avoided due to its increased risk of causing
seizures and serotonin syndrome. Adjunctive therapy with nonsteroidals, particularly ketorolac, should be considered. However, long-term use of these medications
increases the risk of renal failure and peptic ulcer disease. Dosing of analgesics
should be individualized for each patient and should be titrated to pain relief. Many
patients will know which medication, dose, and frequency of administration are

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

419

most beneficial to them. Many sickle cell patients with recurrent pain crises and
other complications are started on hydroxyurea, a myelosuppressive agent shown
to reduce these crises.

420

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS
41.1 A. The reticulocyte count is low in aplastic crisis, but elevated or normal with
a vaso-occlusive crisis. A bone marrow biopsy is invasive and causes a delay in
diagnosis. Neither a smear nor a haptoglobin level would differentiate between the
two diagnoses. A hemoglobin level may not show a difference in the acute setting.
41.2 C. Pneumococcal sepsis is the leading cause of death in children aged 1 to
3 years. Thus, pneumococcal vaccine is critical in its prevention.
41.3 A. The clinician should be worried if the patient has a fever, severe abdominal
pain, respiratory or neurological symptoms, joint swelling, pain that is not relieved
by usual measures, or priapism. The other signs and symptoms here require additional workup, but are not harbingers of the same level of morbidity as a fever.
41.4 B. Acute chest syndrome is caused by pulmonary infection or infarct. It is a
common complication of sickle cell disease that is difﬁcult to conﬁrm simply
by a chest radiograph. Because it is difﬁcult to differentiate it from infectious
pneumonia, patients are empirically started on antibiotics.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Sickle cell disease can manifest in any organ system and has a variety of
clinical presentations ranging from mild to life-threatening.



Because patients with sickle cell disease are functionally asplenic after
early childhood, they are at risk for infection by encapsulated organisms
(eg, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae), and therefore
must be immunized with the appropriate vaccines.



Acute chest syndrome is the leading cause of premature death in patients
with sickle cell disease. Having a low threshold of suspicion in patients
presenting with respiratory complaints, abnormal oxygen saturation, or
findings on lung examination, is critical.



Treatment of acute chest syndrome involves supplemental oxygen, hydration, analgesia, empiric antibiotics, and possibly exchange transfusion.



Splenic sequestration has a very high mortality. Patients present with an
abrupt drop in hemoglobin and the potential for shock, requiring emergent transfusion and spleenectomy.



Aplastic crisis occurs from a transient suppression of erythropoiesis. It
is characterized by significant anemia accompanied by a low reticulocyte
count. It is most commonly caused by parvovirus B19.



Patients in pain crises require prompt attention and treatment of their
pain. Intravenous opiates, such as morphine or hydromorphone, are the
mainstay of pain management in the ED.

ANSWERS TO CASE 42:
Frostbite and Hypothermia
Summary: A 44-year-old undomiciled man with poor nutrition and a history of ethanol abuse and cigarette smoking was exposed to freezing temperatures and now has
a decreased level of consciousness. The patient has an irregular heart rhythm, likely
atrial fibrillation. He is not shivering and his rectal temperature is 30°C (86°F).
• Next step: Transfer to the ED and prevent further systemic heat loss. Remove
any wet or constrictive clothing. Wrap the patient in warm, dry blankets. The
affected areas should be immobilized, insulated, and kept away from dry heat
sources
• Most likely diagnosis: Cold exposure injury leading to frostbite and hypothermia
• Next step in treatment: Rapid core rewarming

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the spectrum of cold exposure injuries.
2. Understand the pathophysiology of frostbite and hypothermia and how it affects
various organ systems.
3. Know the treatments for frostbite and hypothermia.

Considerations
Accidental hypothermia is a multifaceted entity encompassing a range of clinical
features. Frostbite occurs when the skin and body tissues are exposed to cold temperature for a prolonged period of time. To minimize soft tissue injury in this patient,
the rewarming process should not be delayed. Evaluation of core body temperature is necessary to determine if hypothermia exists and to what degree. Once his
wet and constrictive clothing are removed, passive rewarming techniques can be
used to increase the core body temperature. Individuals who are at greatest risk for
hypothermia include the elderly, diabetics, smokers, alcoholics, people with peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, Raynaud disease, and those who are
exposed to windy weather, which increases the rate of heat loss from skin.

APPROACH TO:
Frostbite and Hypothermia
DEFINITIONS
HYPOTHERMIA: Condition in which the core body temperature drops below
that required for normal metabolism, which is less than 35°C (95°F).
FROSTNIP: Deposition of superficial ice crystals on the skin. It can be a warning
sign for impending frostbite. Typically it is a retrospective diagnosis because it is
defined by the absence of tissue damage upon rewarming.
FROSTBITE: Occurs when the skin tissue freezes. Superficial frostbite involves the
skin; whereas deep frostbite involves deeper structures such as muscle, tendon, and bone.
TRENCH FOOT: Results from prolonged exposure of the extremities to a cold,
wet environment, without freezing. Prolonged exposure to this environment leads
to decreased peripheral circulation. This was a common condition in trench warfare
during World War I.
CHILBLAINS (PERNIO): A nonfreezing cold-related injury that occurs in cool,
humid environments. It is characterized by red, scaly lesions, often on the face,
hands, or feet.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Physiology
The human cold response is aimed at maintaining the core body temperature and the
viability of the extremities. The skin’s thermoreceptors are densest on the upper torso.
These peripheral thermoreceptors signal a central thermostat, located in the preoptic
region of the anterior hypothalamus to activate autonomic as well as behavioral
heat loss and gain mechanisms. Peripheral cooling of the blood leads to a cascade of
events including catecholamine release, thyroid stimulation, shivering thermogenesis, and peripheral vasoconstriction. Heat loss is reduced by peripheral vasoconstriction mediated by sympathetic stimulation and catecholamine release. By using
stored glycogen, shivering thermogenesis can provide several hours of heat, however
once glycogen stores are depleted shivering stops. The extremities are protected by
the hunting reaction, which consists of irregular, 5- to 10-minute cycles of alternating periods of vasodilation and vasoconstriction that protect the extremities against
sustained periods of vasoconstriction. If the body is exposed to cold of prolonged
duration or magnitude and the core body temperature is threatened, this mechanism
is abandoned—the so-called life-versus-limb mechanism. Once the body has physiologically lost the ability to compensate for the cold, injury is inevitable. The physiologic consequences of cold injury are thus considered by a systems approach.
Heat loss occurs through four basic mechanisms: conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation. Conduction occurs through heat transfer from the warmer
body to a cooler object; in a wet environment, this occurs at a much greater rate.
Convection is the transfer of heat from movement, where wind acts as a confounding

factor that draws heat away from the body. Radiation is heat transfer by electromagnetic waves from the noninsulated areas on the body. Evaporation of water leads to
heat loss through exhalation of warm air.
There are many predisposing factors for the development of hypothermia (see
Table 42–1). These can be generalized into four overlapping categories: disrupted
circulation, increased heat loss, decreased heat production, and impaired thermoregulation.
Two high-risk populations include individuals who consume ethanol and the
elderly. Ethanol use predisposes to hypothermia in many ways. First, it impairs judgment and thermal perception, therefore, increasing the risk to cold exposure. Ethanol predisposes to hypoglycemia, impedes shivering (ie, lack of fuel interferes with
shivering), and causes peripheral vasodilation (ie, increases heat loss). In addition,
ethanol’s affect on the hypothalamus results in a lower thermoregulatory set point,
resulting in a reduction of the core temperature. The elderly exhibit age-related
impairments in many of the systems of thermoregulation. The elderly often have
an impaired shivering response, decreased mobility, and malnutrition. They are less
able to discriminate cold environments and often lack the ability to vasoconstrict
adequately. Their risks are also increased secondary to their medications, particular cardiac medications, which may impede thermoregulation. The risk of falls is
increased in the elderly. It is also critical to rule out sepsis as the cause of hypothermia in the elderly; particularly hypothermic individuals who are found indoors. For
systemic effects of hypothermia, see Table 42–2.

Cardiovascular
Cardiovascular complications are common throughout the spectrum of cold injury.
Initially during mild cold stress, tachycardia is noted, as temperatures decline, the
response of the cardiovascular system shifts from tachycardia to progressive bradycardia that is refractory to atropine. A multitude of cardiac dysrhythmias are seen in
hypothermia with atrial fibrillation being the most common. The Osborn or J wave
is a well-known manifestation of hypothermia seen on ECGs (see Figure 42–1). It is
characterized by elevation at the junction of the QRS complex and the ST-segment
and is typically seen at temperatures below 32°C (89.6°F). As temperatures drop
below 28°C (82.4°F), ventricular fibrillation occurs. As the core body temperature
drops so does oxygen consumption. It is thought that in some people this decline in
oxygen consumption may explain why profoundly hypothermic patients have been
successfully resuscitated.

related to core temperature. (Reproduced, with permission, from Hall JB, Schmidt GA, Wood LDH,
eds. Principles of Clinical Care. 3rd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2005:1681.)

Respiratory
Initially in response to cold, respirations increase and similarly to the cardiovascular
system with continued cold exposure the hyperactivation of the system begins to
slow down. Respiratory depression occurs with resultant respiratory acidosis from
carbon dioxide retention. Protective airway mechanisms are impaired due to
decreased ciliary motility, bronchorrhea, and thickening of respiratory secretions.

Renal
Mild dehydration and hypotension cause a decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. However, central hypervolemia from peripheral vasoconstriction,
inhibition of ADH, impaired renal tubular function, and the loss of concentrating
abilities result in large-volume cold diuresis.

Gastrointestinal
Poor perfusion to the liver results in the inability to clear toxins, the retention of
lactate, and the formation of a metabolic acidosis.

Neurological
As temperature declines, an individual’s level of conscious also declines. Pupillary
light response and deep tendon reflexes also decline while muscular tone tends to
increase.

Hematologic
Hypothermia leads to many hematologic changes. The most common include a progressive hemoconcentration of the blood resulting in an increase in hematocrit. In
addition, low temperature inhibits enzymatic reactions of the clotting cascade, leading
to a progressive coagulopathy.

FROSTBITE
Maintenance of core temperature takes precedence over rewarming of the
extremities. When the body is exposed to a magnitude or duration of cold that is
significant enough to disrupt the core body temperature, continuous and intense
vasoconstriction occurs, promoting frostbite to the exposed tissue. Frostbite occurs
when tissue temperatures are less than 0°C (32°F). There are two mechanisms for
tissue damage: architectural cellular damage from ice-crystal formation and microvascular thrombosis and stasis. The initial phase of frostbite, the “prefreeze phase,”
is characterized by tissue temperatures dropping below 10°C (50°F), and cutaneous sensation being lost. There is microvascular vasoconstriction and endothelial
leakage of plasma into the interstitium. Crystal formation does not occur until tissue temperatures drop below 0°C (32°F). Areas of skin that experience a slow rate
of cooling will develop ice crystals in the extracellular matrix, whereas cells that
undergo rapid cooling develop intracellular ice crystals, the latter of which is less
favorable to cell survival. During the freeze–thaw phase, extracellular ice crystals
form. In an attempt to maintain osmotic equilibrium, water leaves the cells causing
cellular dehydration and intracellular hyperosmolality. This leads to cellular collapse and demise. The third phase is the progressive microvascular collapse phase.
Red cells sludge and form microthrombi during the first few hours after the tissues
are thawed. The exact mechanism is unclear. Hypoxic vasospasm, hyperviscosity,
and direct endothelial damage all adversely affect flow. Ultimately, there is plasma
leakage and arteriovenous shunting resulting in thrombosis, increased tissue pressure,

430

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ischemia and necrosis also known as the late ischemic phase. In superficial frostbite, clear vesicles may appear, whereas hemorrhagic blisters appear in deep frostbite injuries.

MANAGEMENT
The ultimate goal of prehospital treatment is preservation of life. Frostbite and
hypothermia often coexist and prevention of further systemic heat loss is the
priority. Field rewarming should not be performed if there is any potential for interrupted or incomplete thawing, unless the possibility of evacuation does not exist,
because tissue refreezing is disastrous. However, it is appropriate to remove wet,
constricting clothing and replace with dry clothing. There is a direct relationship
between the length of time the tissue is frozen and the extent of cellular damage.
As with all patients who present to the ED with serious conditions, evaluation
and stabilization occurs simultaneously and the ABCs should always be promptly
addressed. The patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor and have an intravenous catheter placed. Once this occurs, a thorough history should be obtained
including ambient temperature, wind velocity, duration of exposure, type of clothing
worn, medication history, and preexisting medical problems that could affect heat
loss. A core temperature needs to be determined. This is best achieved by obtaining a rectal temperature. Most standard hospital thermometers only read as low as
34°C (93.2°F). Therefore, in patients suspected to be hypothermic, it is critical to
measure core temperature using a specialized thermometer that is capable of reading
low temperatures.
Diagnostic studies that may be useful include a bedside capillary blood glucose.
Correcting hypoglycemia early in presentation may prevent the need for more invasive rewarming techniques. As temperature declines, pulse oximetry may not be reliable, so an arterial blood gas can determine oxygen saturation. An ECG should be
obtained to evaluate cardiac dysrhythmias including atrial fibrillation. Laboratory
studies may reveal an elevated hematocrit secondary to hemoconcentration, and
low platelet counts due to splenic sequestration. Hyperkalemia is indicative of cellular acidosis and is a marker for a poor prognosis. Elevation in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) is commonly encountered in hypothermic patients.
Low thyroid and cortisol levels may reveal a person predisposed to hypothermia. A
high index of suspicion must be maintained for an occult traumatic injury as trauma
and hypothermia commonly occur together. Consider a head CT scan and other
radiographic studies on patients who have an altered mental status or who do not
improve with rewarming.
After stabilizing the core temperature and addressing associated conditions,
rapid thawing should be initiated. The core temperature will continue to fall even
after the patient is extricated from the cold environment due to temperature equilibration between the core and peripheral blood. Most patients are dehydrated. Warm
intravenous fluids (crystalloid) should be administered. For frostbite, rapid rewarming of frozen or partially thawed tissue is accomplished by immersion in gently circulating water that is carefully maintained at a temperature of 37°C to
41°C (99°F-106°F). Rewarming is continued until the tissue is pliable and distal

erythema is noted, usually about 10 to 30 minutes. Active, gentle motion is encouraged but direct tissue massage should be avoided. Parenteral analgesics should be
administered because tissue rewarming causes throbbing, burning pain, and tenderness. Sensation is often diminished after thawing and then disappears with bleb
formation. Sensation does not normalize until healing is complete.
After thawing, the injured extremities should be elevated to minimize swelling.
Sterile dressings should be applied and involved areas handled gently. Digital exercises are encouraged to help avoid venous stasis. Treatment also includes NSAIDs,
topical aloe vera, debridement of clear blisters (hemorrhagic blisters should be left
alone), and tetanus vaccine if indicated. Antibiotics are also often given. In cases of
gangrene, amputation is often delayed for up to 3 weeks, because the extent of tissue
injury is difficult to initially assess.
Based on the severity of hypothermia, various rewarming schemes are followed.
These include passive rewarming, active external rewarming for moderate hypothermia, and active core rewarming in severe hypothermia.
Passive external rewarming allows patients to warm by endogenous heat production. This requires the ability to shiver. Individuals who are malnourished, hypoglycemic, or have a core temperature below 30°C are not candidates for passive
external rewarming. Therefore, this is a good option in healthy patients with a mild
degree of hypothermia. The patient should be removed from the cold or wet environment, and be wrapped in blankets, sleeping bags, or other insulating materials.
The decision to actively rewarm a patient implies a greater degree of hypothermia
and possibly a coexisting medical condition. Active external rewarming involves
the application of heat directly to the skin by way of forced air surface warming,
warm water immersion, radiant heat sources, and warm water bottles. In the hospital
setting, forced air rewarming is most practical.
Active core rewarming refers to techniques that warm the patient from the
inside out and are used to rewarm severely hypothermic patients. There are several
methods used in active core rewarming including positive pressure ventilation using
warm air, peritoneal and pleural irrigation with warmed saline, and extracorporeal
blood rewarming. These methods are reserved for severely hypothermic patients and
those presenting with cardiac arrest.
Hypothermic patients may experience complications secondary to rewarming.
Afterdrop refers to the continual decline in core body temperature after the patient
is removed from the cold environment. The current theory holds that rewarming
causes disequilibrium across a gradient such that the body is cooled from the periphery to the inside and the core body temperature will continue to drop until core
temperature is equal to peripheral temperature. This was thought to predispose to
ventricular fibrillation. However, there is little evidence to support this. Nonetheless, ventricular fibrillation is typically resistant to defibrillation until core temperatures are above 28°C (82.4°F).
For patients who are pulseless and show no signs of life, death pronouncement
only occurs when the individual’s core body temperature is greater than 35°C. Since
the physiologic response to hypothermia is extremely varied, the well known adage,
“no one is dead until they are warm and dead” is often valid.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
42.1 A 72-year-old woman with dementia is reported missing by nursing home staff
late one December night. The patient was found 2 hours after the police were
called lying on a park bench, soaking wet, in a thin night gown with no shoes
on. EMS has arrived on the scene. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Check capillary blood glucose and try to feed the patient.
B. Immediately place the patient on a stretcher, start an IV, and give fluids.
C. Check for airway, breathing, circulation, and then maintain core body
temperature by removing wet clothes and wrapping in warm, dry blankets.
D. Cover the patient with any available materials so that passive rewarming
can start.
42.2 An avid outdoorsman was hiking in the mountains when his boot broke
through the ice on the edge of a stream submerging one foot. The patient has
a long history of diabetes with known peripheral neuropathy. He was able to
hike out to the ranger’s station but had lost complete sensation of his wet foot
afterwards. The patient has frostbite on his cheeks, hands, and this wet foot
shows evidence of trench foot. All wet clothing is removed, he is wrapped in
blankets and on arrival to the emergency department, his vitals signs are stable
except for a core body temperature of 34°C. Which of the following is the
most appropriate next step in management?
A. Initiate extracorporeal blood warming until a core temp of 37°C is
reached.
B. Begin rapid rewarming with water 40°C to 42°C (103°F-104°F).
C. Rub the skin dry where there is evidence of trench foot to decrease the
chance of blisters developing.
D. Treat the patient’s diabetes and peripheral neuropathy then reassess sensation in each extremity.
42.3 A 14-year-old adolescent boy wandered into the woods chasing after his dog
and lost his bearings. When he was ﬁnally found, he was brought to the ED
with severe frostbite of the ﬁngers of both hands. Initially, they appeared very
blue, but are beginning to look black. He has not regained sensation 24-hours
after the exposure. Which of the following describes the most appropriate time
to wait before deciding on amputation of the affected ﬁngers?
A. 24 hours after the episode
B. 48 to 72 hours after the episode
C. 3 to 7 days after the episode
D. 7 to 10 days after the episode
E. 2 to 3 months after demarcation

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

42.4 An undomiciled man of unknown age presents to the ED unresponsive.
Bystanders believe he was outside all night in a snow storm. His core temperature
is 30°C. What is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia seen in hypothermia?
A. Sinus tachycardia
B. Sinus bradycardia
C. Ventricular fibrillation
D. Atrial fibrillation
E. Prolonged QT syndrome
42.5 A 35-year-old undomiciled woman, with a history of schizophrenia, presents
to the ED complaining of tingling in her ﬁngers. The nursing staff removes her
wet clothes and places her in a warm hospital gown. Her vital signs include
a blood pressure of 130/75 mm Hg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and
temperature of 36.05°C (96.9°F). On examination, you note discolored, frostbitten hands. Which of the following features is a poor prognostic indicator in
frostbite?
A. Hemorrhagic blisters
B. Demarcation line of viable tissue
C. Clear fluid-filled blisters
D. Edematous subcutaneous tissue

ANSWERS
42.1 C. The ﬁrst step in emergency care is always to address and stabilize the airway,
breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Passive rewarming methods are appropriate including removing wet clothing. It is critical that rapid rewarming be
avoided if the patient may be delayed to receiving deﬁnitive care. Incomplete
thawing and refreezing is detrimental to tissue. Checking a blood glucose is
important in a patient with altered mental status but should be done after
ABCs are addressed.
42.2 B. Rapid rewarming in the ﬁeld is rarely practical, however, in the Emergency
department it should be started as soon as possible. It is critical to avoid the
deleterious effects of incomplete thawing and prevent refreezing. Although
comorbid conditions such as diabetes inﬂuence the management of a hypothermic patient, the patient’s lack of sensation is due to cold injury and this
should be rapidly treated, not just treating the diabetes.
42.3 E. Generally, 3 weeks is the minimum time required to assess the viability of
tissue after frostbite to see whether amputation is required. Tissue thought to
be necrotic sometimes turns out to be viable. The line of demarcation between
viable and nonviable tissue becomes clear in 1 to 2 months after the initial
cold injury, but surgery may be delayed until 2 to 3 months.

434

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

42.4 D. Atrial ﬁbrillation is the most common dysrhythmia in hypothermia and
is characteristically seen at a core temperature of 30°C. Prolongation of any
interval, bradycardia, asystole, atrial ﬁbrillation/ﬂutter, and ventricular tachycardia may also be seen. In this patient a 12-lead ECG was obtained showing
an Osborne (J) wave, which is indicative of a junctional rhythm and is consistent with hypothermia. J waves may be seen at any temperature below 32.2°C
(89.9°F), most frequently in leads II and V6. Below a core temperature of 25°C
(77°F), they are most commonly found in the precordial leads (especially V3
and V4) and their size increases. J waves are usually upright in aVL, aVF, and
the precordial leads.
42.5 A. Hemorrhagic blisters are a poor prognostic indicator due to their association with deep tissue injury. These blisters should not be debrided or drained
because it leads to tissue desiccation and worsening of the injury. Clear blisters, on the other hand, should be drained because the ﬂuid contains thromboxane, which is thought to be destructive to healthy tissue. A demarcation
line of healthy tissue is a late sign in hypothermia. Edematous soft tissue is not
a prognostic indicator in frostbite.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Because hypothermia and frostbite often occur simultaneously, prevention of further systemic heat loss is the highest priority.



Field rewarming is rarely warranted because of the potential for incomplete
or interrupted rewarming. Injured parts should be protected, core temperature stabilized and patient transferred to the ED for rapid rewarming.
A rewarming bath should be maintained at a temperature of 37°C to 41°C
(98.6°F-105.8°F).



Standard hospital thermometers only read as low as 34°C (93°F), so a
specialized low-temperature thermometer is required to obtain an accurate core body temperature.



A severely hypothermic patient can present with rigidity, asystolic, and
with fixed pupils; however, he or she should not be pronounced deceased
until the core body temperature has been warmed to at least 35°C (95°F).



Hypoglycemia, sepsis, and hypothyroidism are conditions that may
mimic or coexist with hypothermia.



Ethanol abusers and the elderly are at high risk for cold-exposure injuries.

CASE 43
A group of teenagers was swimming at the lake, when one of the boys failed to
surface after diving off a platform. He was quickly found and rescued by another
swimmer from the lake bottom. The patient was noted to be apneic, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated by one of the bystanders. After the
paramedics arrived, the patient was noted to have spontaneous shallow respirations, a weak palpable pulse, and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 7 (eyes 1,
verbal 2, motor 4). The paramedics intubated the patient and transported him
to the emergency department (ED). In the ED, the patient has an initial pulse of
70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, temperature of 35.6°C
(96.1°F), GCS score of 6 (eyes 1, verbal 1, motor 4), and oxygen saturation of 92%
on 100% FiO2.

ANSWERS TO CASE 43:
Submersion Injury
Summary: A teenage boy presents with near-drowning following a diving accident
at a lake.
• Complications: Submersion injury results in global hypoxia and tissue ischemia
primarily affecting the brain, lungs, and heart. Early complications include noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypoxic encephalopathy, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, dysrhythmias, and renal impairment. Coagulopathy, electrolyte
abnormalities, and hemodilution or hemoconcentration are rare but possible
sequela. Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur later in
the patient’s hospital course.
• Best treatment: The most important treatment to optimize outcome is rapid initiation of resuscitation in the prehospital setting (ie, stabilizing the ABCs). To
this end, bystander CPR can be vitally important. Victims of submersion injury
often require aggressive respiratory support, which may range from administration of supplemental oxygen to intubation. If cervical spine injury is suspected
(as in this patient who dove off a platform), cervical spine stabilization should
be maintained until spinal trauma is ruled out.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the pathophysiology of submersion injury.
2. Become familiar with the epidemiology and prevention of drowning.
3. Learn the special problems associated with cold-water-submersion injury.

Considerations
The initial management of patients with submersion injury is stabilization of the
ABCs and correction of hypoxemia. In the ED, all of these patients require continuous
cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry. Initial diagnostics may include a complete
blood count, blood glucose, electrolytes, creatinine, arterial blood gas, and chest x-ray.
This patient will need to be admitted to the ICU where continued cardiopulmonary
monitoring and mechanical ventilation support can be provided.
When encountering a patient with a submersion injury, the ED physician must
always consider whether any precipitants exist that also require treatment. These
precipitants may include alcohol or drug intoxication, seizures, hypoglycemia, cardiac arrest, attempted suicide or homicide, and child abuse or neglect. In addition,
if the submersion is associated with a history of trauma (eg, diving into water, motor
vehicle collision), cervical spine and head injuries are considerations. Hypothermia
should also be considered if the patient is submersed in cold water. After the patient
is hemodynamically stable, radiographic imaging of the cervical spine (plain x-rays

439

or computed tomography [CT]) and CT of the head may be necessary to rule out
concomitant injury.

APPROACH TO:
Submersion Injury
DEFINITIONS
DROWNING: Death following a submersion event.
SUBMERSION VICTIM: Patient with some degree of submersion distress requiring medical evaluation and treatment.
IMMERSION SYNDROME: Syncope or sudden death that occurs after submersion in water that is at least 5°C less than body temperature. Due to dysrhythmias
induced by vagal stimulation.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology and Prevention
Drowning is the fourth most common cause of accidental death in the United States.
In children 1 to 14 years old, it is the second leading cause of death (behind motor
vehicle collisions). Risk factors for drowning include age, gender, and race. The
incidence of submersion injuries peaks in toddlers and young children, adolescents
and young adults, and in the elderly. However, drowning deaths are most common
in toddlers and older teenagers. Males account for 80% of drowning victims older
than 12 months. Between 15 to 19 years of age, black boys have drowning rates 12
to 15 times higher than those of white boys.
Alcohol use and other medical conditions have also been associated with an
increased risk of submersion injuries. Among teenagers and adults, alcohol use may be
a contributing factor in 30% to 50% of drownings. Seizures, autism, and other developmental and behavioral disorders also increase the risk of drowning. In patients with
prolonged QT syndrome, immersion in cold water may further extend the QT interval.
Submersion injuries can occur in natural bodies of water (freshwater and saltwater) as well as in domestic settings (such as bathtubs and swimming pools). Infants
may even drown in toilets or buckets of water. However, if the infant is less than
6 months old or has an atypical presentation, healthcare providers should maintain
a high suspicion for abuse. Efforts to decrease the incidence of submersion injuries
and drowning deaths have focused on educating the public and increasing awareness of
preventive measures. Preventive measures include adequate fencing around pools,
decreasing the use of alcohol when engaged in water sports, increasing the supervision of children playing in or near water, and increasing the number of citizens
trained in CPR. Water safety education for children, teenagers, and parents that
encourages wearing flotation devices and never swimming alone should be reinforced in the school, community, and physician’s office.

440

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Pathophysiology of Submersion Injuries
Victims of submersion injuries initially hold their breaths. As hypoxia and air hunger develop, they eventually involuntarily swallow and aspirate water. After aspiration of 1 to 3 mL/kg of water, dilution and washout of surfactant occurs, resulting in
atelectasis, decreased gas exchange across the alveoli, non-cardiogenic pulmonary
edema, and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. This leads to worsening hypoxia and
respiratory and metabolic acidosis. If this process continues, neuronal death and
cardiovascular collapse ensue.
“Dry drowning” is a term that was traditionally used to refer to drowning deaths
that occurred without aspiration of a significant amount of water (perhaps due to
severe laryngospasm, hypoxia, and loss of consciousness). However, the medical literature does not support this mechanism of injury. Dry drownings are probably due
to causes besides simple submersion.

Management
Patients with submersion injuries may present with signs of pulmonary and central
nervous system dysfunction or dysrhythmias. The patient may arrive in extremis
with hypoxia, cyanosis, severe respiratory distress, or respiratory arrest. Other pulmonary findings may include tachypnea, wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Neurologically,
patient presentations may range from a mild alteration of consciousness to coma.
Neurological deficits at the time of initial evaluation do not necessarily portend a
poor patient outcome. Dysrhythmias are mainly the result of hypoxemia and acidosis and may include ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and bradycardia
asystole. Patients with severe submersion injury may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypoxic encephalopathy, or cardiac arrest.
All patients should be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry in the ED. An ECG is useful to rule out QT prolongation and dysrhythmias. A
chest x-ray should also be performed to identify any infiltrates or pulmonary edema
with the caveat that initial x-ray findings may progress over time. Although they are
often normal at first, a baseline complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, and
glucose should be obtained. Arterial blood gases may be helpful in monitoring for
acidosis, hypercarbia, and hypoxemia. If a concern for rhabdomyolysis exists, serum
creatinine kinase and urine myoglobin levels may be useful.
One of the most critical elements in the successful management of submersion
victims is prompt and effective basic life support delivery in the prehospital setting.
The Heimlich maneuver is no longer recommended to expel fluid from the lungs
because of the high rate of aspiration induced by this maneuver and because of the
delay it causes in initiation of ventilation. An awake patient with mild respiratory symptoms may benefit from noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)
although a risk of gastric distention and vomiting does exist with the use of NIPPV.
Indications for intubation include a lack of protective airway reflexes, respiratory
distress, hypercarbia, hypoxia (despite noninvasive oxygen delivery), and apnea.
Intravenous fluids consisting of lactated Ringer solution or normal saline should
be initiated in most victims. Glucose containing solutions are generally contraindicated except in hypoglycemic patients. Scientific investigations indicate that glucose
solutions may worsen the neurological outcome in animals that have incomplete

441

cerebral ischemia. In general, empiric antibiotics are not indicated for patients with
submersion injuries. Antibiotics may benefit patients who were submerged in grossly
contaminated water or manifest signs of infection.
Patients who are asymptomatic may be observed in the ED for 4 to 6 hours. If
they maintain normal oxygen saturations on room air and have normal pulmonary
examinations and chest x-rays, they may be discharged home. Admission is required
for patients who are symptomatic, have been unconscious or hypoxic or apneic,
have an abnormal chest x-ray, or have evidence of dysrhythmia.

Cold Water Submersion Injury
Submersion in cold water may be more advantageous than submersion in warm water
due to induction of the diving reflex and hypothermia. In the diving reflex, blood
is shunted away from the victim’s peripheral tissues to the heart and brain, decreasing metabolism and reducing anoxic injury. This reflex is strongest in children less
than 6 months old and decreases with age. The protective effects of this reflex may
partially account for reports of complete neurological recovery in children after prolonged submersion. Hypothermia has been theorized to be neuroprotective because
of the induction of global hypometabolic state, leading to the conservation of oxygen and glucose for brain metabolism. Cold water also has potentially deleterious
effects, most significantly cardiac irritability (leading to dysrhythmias), exhaustion,
and altered mental status. Although some case reports have described patients who
survived prolonged submersion in cold water, hypothermia is usually a poor prognostic indicator.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
43.1 Each of the following patients is being treated for a submersion experience.
Which one of the following is most appropriate for discharge from the ED after
several hours of observation?
A. A 3-year-old boy found face-down in the swimming pool, requiring 4 minutes
of CPR, has a return of normal vital signs, with GCS score of 15, and mild
respiratory distress.
B. A 12-year-old boy found unconscious and submerged in a swimming pool
after striking his head on the bottom. His chest x-ray (CXR) and head CT
are normal. His GCS score is 14. He is complaining of headache and no
respiratory symptoms.
C. A 6-year-old boy who was washed into the ocean by a large wave and was
rescued by a bystander. No CPR was required, and the boy had an initial
GCS score of 14 and normal vital signs. CXR and physical examination
are normal. Room air O2 saturation is 95%.
D. A 3-month-old infant who was brought to the ED after accidental submersion in the bathtub. The physical examination is unremarkable except
for bruising over both arms and ankles. His CXR is normal and his room
air O2 saturation is 98%.

442

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

43.2 Which of the following is a correct statement regarding submersion injuries?
A. Antibiotics may benefit patients who were submersed in grossly contaminated water.
B. The diving reflex is neuroprotective for adults who are submersed in cold
water.
C. Neurological deficits on initial evaluation portend a poor prognosis.
D. A normal initial chest x-ray rules out pulmonary injury.

ANSWERS
43.1 C. Although the boy described in choice A is stable, his initial requirement
for 4 minutes of CPR places him at a great risk for pulmonary and neurological sequelae. The patient described in B has mild respiratory symptoms, but
his mechanism of injury and neurological ﬁndings are concerning for a closed
head injury that requires further observation. The patient described in D is
stable from the standpoint of a submersion injury, but the physical ﬁndings
suggest possible intentional injury that may need further investigation.
43.2 A. Antibiotics may beneﬁt patients who were submersed in grossly contaminated water or who have signs of infection on examination. The diving reﬂex
is strongest in infants and children. Neurological deﬁcits at the time of initial
evaluation do not rule out the possibility of neurological recovery. Initial chest
x-ray ﬁndings may progress over time.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Precipitants (such as alcohol use, seizures, and hypoglycemia) and associated cervical spine and head injuries must be considered in any submersion victim.



The most common complications involve pulmonary or central nervous
system dysfunction or dysrhythmias.



The most important treatment to optimize outcome is rapid initiation of
resuscitation in the prehospital arena. Victims of submersion injury often
require aggressive respiratory support.

CASE 44
A 50-year-old woman presents with a severe headache of abrupt onset of 10 hours
duration. The pain is diffuse, throbbing, and worsened when she went outside
into the sunlight. She denies any recent fever, neck pain, numbness, weakness,
vomiting, and any change in vision. She was concerned because she has never
had a headache as strong as this before. Her past medical and family histories
are unremarkable. She does not take any medications, does not smoke, and only
drinks alcohol socially.
On examination, her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure 136/72
mm Hg, heart rate 88 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per
minute. She is not in any acute distress but appears to be mildly uncomfortable.
Her pupils are equal and reactive bilaterally. There is no evidence of papilledema
on fundoscopic examination. Movement of her neck causes her some increased
discomfort. Her neurological examination is normal, including cranial nerves,
strength, light touch sensation, deep-tendon reflexes, and finger-to-nose. The
computed tomography (CT) scan of her head is normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 44:
Headache
Summary: This is a 50-year-old woman with acute onset of “the worst headache of
her life.”
• Most likely diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
• Next diagnostic step: CT scan of the head followed by lumbar puncture.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn to differentiate emergent, urgent, and less urgent causes of headache.
2. Understand the treatment of various types of headache.

Considerations
This 50-year-old woman has an acute onset of severe headache, described as the
“worse headache of her life.” The acute onset and severity of her symptoms are
concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Headache is a very common chief
complaint in the emergency department (ED), accounting for up to 2.2% of all ED
visits. When evaluating patients with headaches, the clinician’s goals are to identify
those with serious or life-threatening conditions and to alleviate pain. The physical examination should screen for non-neurological causes of headache including
palpation of the sinuses (looking for tenderness consistent with sinusitis), palpation
of the temporal arteries (for tenderness or reduced pulsations suggestive of temporal
arteritis). A thorough eye examination is important and should consist of assessment
of the pupils, visual acuity, and fundoscopy. A detailed neurological examination
should also be performed. This patient’s CT scan of the head is unremarkable, which
does not definitively rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage. CT scan is often performed
to rule out a cerebral mass before performing lumbar puncture (LP). Erythrocytes in
the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or a xanthochromic CSF are considered diagnostic
for SAH. However, xanthochromia may take up to 12 hours to appear. Therefore,
a negative LP in the face of clinical suspicion for subarachnoid hemorrhage may
necessitate repeat LP or other neuroimaging such as magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) or angiography.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

447

APPROACH TO:
Headache
CLINICAL APPROACH
Headaches can be caused by many intracranial and extracranial processes. One of
the easiest ways to classify them is to separate them into primary and secondary
causes. Primary headaches are most common and include migraine, tension-type,
and cluster headaches. Secondary headaches are the result of some other disease process (eg, infection, tumor). Headaches can also be subdivided into critical or emergent versus nonemergent causes. Critical and emergent headaches have an etiology
that mandates immediate identification and treatment (Table 44–1). In contrast,
nonemergent causes are benign and do not present any immediate threat to life.
This category includes primary headache syndromes and postlumbar puncture headaches. Less than 1% of patients with headache have a potentially life-threatening
etiology, but identification of these patients is paramount.
When evaluating patients with headaches, the history should focus on the nature
of the pain (location, severity, character, onset), any associated symptoms, and
aggravating or alleviating factors. Past medical history (including history of head
trauma, medications) and family history are important to identify risk factors for
serious disease. A history of prior headaches and any previous diagnostic studies can
also be helpful. Potentially ominous historical findings include a sudden onset, the
“worst headache of life,” headaches dramatically different from past episodes, immunocompromised, new onset after age 50 years, and onset with exertion.
A complete physical examination with a detailed neurological evaluation can
also help to separate the emergent from other causes. Abnormal vital signs can be a
harbinger of life-threatening conditions. Other warning signs include altered mental status, abnormal fundi, meningeal signs, focal neurological deficits, and a rash
suspicious for meningococcemia. Some types of headache have classic historical or
examination findings that will aid in narrowing the differential (Table 44–2).

Because there is no routine workup of headaches, testing must be based on clinical
suspicion of serious illness (Table 44–3). Diagnostic imaging of the head should be
considered for patients with sudden-onset severe headaches, HIV-positive patients
with a new headache, and headaches with new abnormal findings (eg, focal deficit,
altered mental status). Management includes stabilizing any life-threatening conditions, controlling pain, and addressing any underlying disease or specific etiologies.

SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has an annual incidence of 1 in 10,000 Americans.
Most cases occur in patients 40 to 60 years old. The presentation can be very subtle
with a normal neurological examination, little or no nuchal rigidity, normal level of

consciousness, and normal vital signs. Nevertheless, the mortality associated with SAH
approaches 50%. Thus, the ED physician must maintain a high index of suspicion in
a patient with acute onset of severe headache. CT scan is usually the initial imaging
test. Although the newer high-resolution CTs have higher sensitivity, no imaging
procedure can definitively rule out SAH. Thus, many authorities advocate performing a
lumbar puncture on all patients suspected of having SAH, even in the face of a normal
CT scan. The lumbar puncture revealing xanthochromic CSF is considered the gold
standard of diagnosis. Because xanthochromia may take up to 12 hours to develop,
persistently bloody CSF is also worrisome for SAH. Neurosurgical evaluation is important once the diagnosis of SAH is established. Nimodipine may be helpful in decreasing
cerebral arterial spasm and subsequent ischemia. Angiographic evaluation is usually

450

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

undertaken to assess for possible need of surgical intervention of lesions such as berry
aneurysms. Prognosis generally correlates with initial neurological status.

CEREBRAL CAUSES
Viral or bacterial meningitis can cause severe headache. Lumbar puncture is the
best method of assessing for these infections. Immunocompromised states such as
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may cause more subtle or atypical
symptoms (eg, lack of fever or meningismus). Pre-LP CT does not necessarily need
to be performed for a patient without risk factors for a mass lesion (such as HIV or
cancer) and a normal neurological examination, normal level of consciousness, and
absence of papilledema. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) may present as
headache, but usually there is a history of or continued neurological deficit. The
classic presentation of a brain tumor (headache associated with nausea or vomiting,
sleep disturbances) is uncommon. Thus persistent atypical headache (such as new
onset after age 50 years), severe pain, or associated with even subtle cognitive or
neurological function should be investigated, usually with CT.

TEMPORAL ARTERITIS
Temporal arteritis (TA) almost always occurs in patients older than age 50 years
and is more common in women. It is caused by systemic arteritis, which presents
as severe and throbbing headache, located over the frontotemporal region. Often,
the temporal artery has a diminished pulse or is tender or is pulsating. Patients are
diagnosed with TA if they fulfill three of the following criteria: age older than
50 years, new-onset localized headache, decreased pulse or tenderness over the temporal artery, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate exceeding 50 mm/h, and/or abnormal
temporal artery biopsy. Vision loss is a potential complication, and immediate treatment should include prednisone 40 to 60 mg/d and urgent referral.

PRIMARY HEADACHE SYNDROMES
Migraine headaches are common. Onset usually occurs during the teenage years,
and women are more often affected than men. Family history is often positive. The
most common variety is migraine without aura, which is usually slow in onset, unilateral, and throbbing. Photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting frequently
accompany the pain. Patients with migraines with aura have a similar type of headache that is preceded by reversible visual phenomena (most common), paresthesias,
motor deficits, or language difficulties. Treatment includes intravenous hydration
if the patient is dehydrated and placing the patient in a dark, quiet room. Pharmacological options include dihydroergotamine (a nonspecific serotonin agonist),
sumatriptan (a selective serotonin agonist), or dopamine antagonists such as metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, or prochlorperazine. In general, opiates are used for
patients with refractory pain.
Tension headaches are extremely common. They are usually characterized by bilateral, nonpulsating, “band-like” pain around the forehead to the occiput. Nausea and

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

451

vomiting are uncommon. Treatment includes acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and stress reduction techniques.
Cluster headaches are rarer than other types of primary headache syndromes.
They occur more commonly in men and usually start after 20 years of age. Patients
typically present with unilateral, severe, orbital or temporal pain, often associated
with ipsilateral lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, miosis, and/or ptosis. The
headaches tend to occur in “clusters” for several weeks and then remit for months
or years. High-flow oxygen is usually effective. DHE and sumatriptan can also help
relieve symptoms.

ANSWERS
44.1 A. The ﬁrst patient is most likely to have a potentially life-threatening condition (hypertensive crisis).
44.2 C. Migraine headaches are described as unilateral and throbbing with nausea,
photophobia, and phonophobia.
44.3 D. Xanthochromia in cerebrospinal ﬂuid is most concerning for subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Because it results from hemoglobin metabolism, xanthochromia
may take up to 12 hours to develop.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Potentially ominous historical findings include sudden onset, “the worst
headache of life,” headaches dramatically different from past episodes,
immunocompromised, new onset after age 50 years, and onset with
exertion.



Diagnostic testing must be based on clinical suspicion. For example, if
there is a concern for a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a CT scan of the head
and lumbar puncture (if CT is negative) are warranted.

In general, management includes stabilizing any life-threatening conditions, controlling pain, and addressing any underlying disease or specific
etiologies.

CASE 45
A 74-year-old man is found in his small apartment after having a seizure on a hot
summer day. The paramedics state they found him in a poorly ventilated apartment without any air conditioning. They established an IV of normal saline prior to
arrival and obtained a fingerstick glucose of 146 mg/dL. Because he was postictal
during transport, they were unable to obtain any other history about past medical
problems, medications, or allergies.
On arrival in the emergency department (ED), his temperature is 41.1°C
(106°F), blood pressure is 157/92 mm Hg, heart rate is 156 beats per minute,
and respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute. He is extremely warm to touch. He
is combative, moaning, and flailing his arms and legs at staff. His pupils are midrange and reactive to light. His mucous membranes are dry. His neck is supple.
His skin is flushed, hot, and dry.

ANSWERS TO CASE 45:
Heat-Related Illnesses
Summary: This is a 74-year-old man with a seizure who is hyperthermic, tachycardic,
tachypneic, and altered mental status.
• Most likely diagnosis: Seizure secondary to heat stroke, but is essential to rule
out other causes such as sepsis and medications overdose.
• Best initial treatment: Management of the ABCs and rapid cooling

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the clinical signs and symptoms associated with heat-related illness.
2. Learn the management and treatment of heat-related illness.

Considerations
When evaluating hyperthermic patients, the clinician must first determine if the
patient has a fever or suffering from heat stroke. The presumptive diagnosis of heat
stroke can be made on the basis of environmental conditions and circumstantial
evidence (hot day, enclosed apartment without air conditioning or adequate ventilation), and the next step is to determine the severity of the patient’s heat-related
illness, which could be useful in guiding his treatment. Because heat stroke has
a mortality of 10% to 20% even with treatment, it is essential to diagnose and
begin therapy immediately. This patient has severe heatstroke, as evidenced by his
altered mental status and seizure. Simultaneously, laboratory and radiographic studies should be performed to rule-out infectious etiologies and drug overdoses.

APPROACH TO:
Heat-Related Illnesses
DEFINITIONS
HEAT STRESS: Feeling of discomfort and physiologic strain with normal core
temperatures. These patients exhibit decreased exercise tolerance and no other
symptoms.
HEAT EXHAUSTION: Mild dehydration, with or without sodium abnormalities.
Patients have profuse sweating, thirst, nausea, vomiting, confusion and headache,
and may have collapsed. Core temperatures range from 38°C to 40°C (100°F-104°F).
Generally, the victim is not able to continue his/her activities as the result of the
environmental conditions.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

455

HEAT STROKE: Severe dehydration with core temperature greater than 40°C.
Patients are flushed, with hot, dry skin. Symptoms include those associated with
CNS disturbances such as dizziness, vertigo, syncope, confusion, delirium, and
unconsciousness. Classically, heat strokes develop slowly over days and occur more
frequently in older individuals with chronic illnesses.
EXERTIONAL HEAT STROKE: Heat stroke affecting individuals involved in
strenuous physical activities. This type of heat stroke can have a more rapid onset
than non-exertional heat strokes. Weather conditions including high humidity and
increased temperatures are risk factors. The at-risk individuals are highly motivated
athletes, laborers, and soldiers.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The primary abnormality in heat-related illnesses is the individual’s inability to
adequately transfer heat (produced from normal metabolic activities) to the environment resulting in an increase in core temperature. Risk factors for developing
heat illness include ambient heat and humidity, extremes of age, strenuous exercise, cardiovascular disease, dehydration, obesity, impaired mentation, and various
medications (eg, diuretics, anticholinergics, antihistamines, phenothiazines, cyclic
antidepressants, sympathomimetics, alcohol).
The spectrum of heat-related illness varies in severity from benign to severe.
Table 45–1 describes the minor syndromes. In contrast to these benign entities,
heat stroke is characterized by a loss of thermoregulation, tissue damage, and
multiorgan failure. Classically, patients present with hyperpyrexia (temperature
>41°C [106°F]), central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (eg, altered mental
status, seizure, focal neurological deficits), and anhidrosis.

Diagnosis
Diagnosing heat stroke is largely a matter of ruling out other causes of hyperthermia
with concomitant CNS dysfunction. The differential includes alcohol withdrawal;
salicylate toxicity; phencyclidine, cocaine, and amphetamine toxicity; tetanus; sepsis;
neuroleptic malignant syndrome; encephalitis, meningitis, and brain abscess; malaria;
typhoid fever; malignant hyperthermia; anticholinergic toxicity; status epilepticus;
cerebral hemorrhage; diabetic ketoacidosis; and thyroid storm.
Laboratory studies should include complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea
nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine, glucose, liver enzymes, coagulation studies, urinalysis,
urine myoglobin, and arterial blood gas. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be
considered if the patient has syncope or a history of cardiovascular disease. Chest
radiographs are useful to rule out aspiration or any pulmonary infection. CT scan of
the head and/or lumbar puncture may also be needed.

Treatment
In treating heat stroke, the clinician should strive to stabilize the ABCs, commence
rapid cooling, replace fluid and electrolyte losses, and treat any complications.
The goal is to cool the patient to 40°C (104°F) to avoid overshoot hypothermia.
There are a number of cooling methods that are applied and these can be divided

categorically as evaporative techniques and conduction techniques. Although there
are strong proponents for the different cooling methods, there is no current consensus regarding which of the techniques is most effective. In all patients, the initial measures consist of removing the patient from the hot environment if possible
and removing clothing. Evaporative cooling using cool mist and fans is simple and
effective approach to cooling in the field; the evaporative approach is advocated by a
number of investigators because the physical cooling principle suggests that the evaporation of 1 ml of water is associated with seven times the amount of heat dissipation when compared to melting 1 g of ice. Alternative cooling methods also include
ice packs to the groin and axillae, cooling blankets, ice water immersion, peritoneal
lavage, and cardiopulmonary bypass. Antipyretics are not effective in this scenario.
In addition, shivering can be controlled with benzodiazepines or phenothiazines. Benzodiazepines can also be used to treat any seizures. If the laboratory studies reveal evidence of rhabdomyolysis, mannitol and alkalinization of the urine are
other considerations. The most common complications of heat stroke are rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, liver failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, heart
failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiovascular collapse.
The following independent negative prognosticators for survival have been identified, and these include age >80 years, cardiac disease, cancer, core temperature
>40°C, living in an institutions, previous diuretic use, systolic BP <100 mm Hg,
GCS <12, and transport to hospital by ambulance.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
45.1 A 33-year-old man is found comatose at a construction site in the noon-hour
on a hot summer day. His core temperature is 41.7°C (107°F). The ED physician orders evaporative cooling measures and ice packs. The patient begins
with intense shivering. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Continued observation.
B. Short-acting benzodiazepine.
C. Begin intravenous cooling solution.
D. Increase the number of ice bags.
E. Stop the cooling.
45.2 A 70-year-old man is brought into the ED complaining of headache and
fatigue. His blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 100 beats per minute,
and core temperature is 40.3°C (104.5°F). Upon using ice bags, his core temperature is down to 38°C (100.4°F). Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Observation for 4 to 6 hours and then, if stable, discharge home.
B. Continue ice bags until the core temperature is 36.7°C (98°F).
C. Admission to the hospital for observation of complications.
D. Administer cold gastric lavage.
E. Discharge the patient only if he can be placed in a different environment
after discharge.

ANSWERS
45.1 B. This patient most likely has exertional heatstroke where core temperature
elevations may occur rapidly; therefore, measurement directed at reducing his
core temperature are appropriate and must be continued. Benzodiazepines are
ﬁrst-line therapy for shivering or seizures in heat stroke.
45.2 C. All patients with severe heat exhaustion or heat stroke, particularly those
who are older, should be admitted.

CASE 46
You are in the emergency center when two patients are brought in by paramedics.
By report, the two men in their twenties were victims of lightning injury while playing golf. Eyewitnesses at the scene report that the victims were standing several
feet apart, when one of the men was struck directly by lightning that resulted in
both men falling to the ground immediately and becoming unconscious. One of
the victims was found pulseless at the scene and cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) was initiated by a bystander. The second man was noted to be unconscious
for several minutes after the incident and has remained confused. On examination, one victim has extensive soft-tissue burn over his back, and he is intubated
and ventilated without spontaneous respirations. No palpable pulse is identified
and fine ventricular fibrillation appears on the electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor.
The second victim is awake with a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute, blood
pressure of 130/80 mm Hg, respirations of 18 breaths per minute, Glasgow coma
scale (GCS) score of 13, with no identifiable external sign of injury.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS TO CASE 46:
Lightning and Electrical Injury
Summary: Two adult victims present to the emergency center following lightning
injuries. One patient with cardiac arrest appears to have been a victim of direct
lightning strike, while the second victim appears to have minimal external signs of
injury.
• Lightning-related complications: Cardiac injury, usually in the form of arrhythmia, neurological damage, burns, spinal cord injury, and respiratory arrest.
• Identification of complications: Thorough and careful physical examination and
electrocardiography will identify arrhythmia and cutaneous burns. Computed
tomography (CT) scan of the head is indicated in all patients with severe lighting injury and those with abnormal neurological examination. Spinal protection and immobilization are necessary until injury is ruled out, and aggressive,
persistent resuscitation according to advanced life support protocol is indicated,
including airway control and ventilation support until spontaneous respiration
is restored.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn to recognize and treat the immediate and late complications associated
with electrical injury and lightning injury.
2. Learn to recognize the spectrum of injury associated with lightning and
electrocution.
3. Understand the relationship between Ohm law and injuries produced by electric
current.

Considerations
One patient suffered a direct lightning strike and is in cardiac arrest. Because of its
massive direct current countershock, lightning strike can induce depolarization of
the entire myocardium leading to cardiac standstill. Immediate cardiac arrest is the
most common cause of death after a lightning strike. However, respiratory arrest
may also occur, either due to paralysis of the respiratory center in the medulla, or as
a result of tetany of the respiratory muscles from electric current passing through the
thorax. Many patients will regain cardiopulmonary function if timely and appropriate resuscitation efforts are able to sustain oxygenation and circulation while the
organ systems recover.
Given the first patient’s young age and lack of comorbid factors, there is a greater
likelihood for response to resuscitation efforts than in victims with cardiac arrest from
other traumatic causes. The heart’s inherent automaticity renders it possible for spontaneous recovery if immediate defibrillation and tissue oxygenation is maintained.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

461

The second patient, although hemodynamically stable, has suffered a high-risk
electrical injury with loss of consciousness. Head and/or spinal injury could be present
as a consequence of being “thrown” by the lightning strike. He requires evaluation
with CT scan of the head, ECG, spinal immobilization, and evaluation and initial
observation in the ICU for close monitoring of the cardiopulmonary status.

APPROACH TO:
Lighting and Electrical Injury
CLINICAL APPROACH
Although lightning strike is a rare phenomenon, this injury is associated with a
25% fatality rate, and more than 70% of those who survive have permanent
injuries. Lightning strike is responsible for approximately 100 deaths annually in
the United States. Electrical injury, excluding lightning, is responsible for more than
500 deaths annually, with approximately 20% of its victims being younger than
age 18 years. The effects of electrical injury are related to the intensity and magnitude of the electric current. According to Ohm law, the current flow (amperage)
is directly related to the voltage and inversely related to the resistance in the
current’s pathway, represented by the following formula: current (amperage) = voltage/
resistance. Because of their low resistance, nerves, blood vessels, mucous membranes, and muscle are the preferred pathways for electric current passage and
are most susceptible to electrical and lightning injury. Bones, fat, tendon, and skin
have relatively high resistance, and therefore sustain less damage during electric and
lightning injuries. The probable path of the electrical current should be assessed; for
example, burns on both hands indicate a path likely through the heart, which has
a poor prognosis.
Electrical current exists in two forms: alternating current (AC) and direct
current (DC). AC involves electrons flowing back and forth in cycles, whereas in
DC, the electron flow occurs in only one direction. Alternating current (AC) is more
dangerous because it may cause tetanic muscle contractions and the “locking on”
phenomenon, preventing the victim from releasing the electrical source and prolonging the exposure to the current. Lightning strike is a form of DC electrical injury
with extremely high voltage and amperage, but short duration of exposure. During
lightning injury, the electrons flow in only one direction, thereby typically inducing
a single intense muscle contraction that “throws” its victim and causes simultaneous
fractures and spinal injury. There are four types of lightning injury (Table 46–1).

Pathophysiology
Electrical injury can cause direct necrosis of the myocardium, ischemic injury as a
result of vasoconstriction caused by excess catecholamine release, or disturbances in
the cardiac rhythm. Even low currents can produce arrhythmias, including asystole
and ventricular tachycardia. Late dysrhythmias are uncommon in previously healthy
patients, but can be produced by patchy myocardial necrosis and injury to the

462

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Table 46–1 • TYPES OF LIGHTNING INJURY
Direct strike: The most serious type; when the major path of lightning current travels through the
victim
Side flash (splash): When the current is discharged from a victim or object of direct strike onto
a nearby person. In these cases, the current is traveling through paths of least resistance to the
victim
Ground current or stride potential: When the lightning strikes the ground and then enters the
victim’s body from one foot and exits via the opposite foot
Flashover phenomenon: When the force of nearby lightning causes expansion and implosion of
surrounding air, causing a blast effect
Blunt injury: This type of injury may occur when the victim is in close proximity to the shockwave
produced by lightning, and the forces may result in the victim being thrown, causing tympanic
membrane ruptures, and other contusive injuries

sinoatrial (SA) node. Lightning is able to induce cardiac standstill by depolarizing
the entire myocardium. Because of the inherent automaticity of the heart, normal
sinus rhythm often spontaneously returns.

Clinical Considerations
Cardiovascular Effects All victims of lightning strike and high-voltage electric
injury should have immediate ECG monitoring and cardiopulmonary support to
maintain tissue perfusion as needed. A cool, extremity with diminished sensation
and pulse is usually caused by vasoconstriction and nerve ischemia, which may
resolve spontaneously with time. Because extremity compartment syndrome may
develop, reexamination with compartment pressure measurements is indicated in
selective patients. Aggressive treatment by fasciotomy is indicated when elevated
compartment pressures are identified. Victims of electrical injury with no loss of
consciousness or physical findings who are asymptomatic and have normal ECG can
be safely discharged home.
Neurological Effects Nerve damage is common after electrical injury, but no one
condition is pathognomonic. Approximately 75% of patients struck by lightning
will have transient loss of consciousness and brief extremity weakness or paresthesia.
Lightning victims often have keraunoparalysis, a temporary paralysis with loss
of sensation that typically involves lower limbs. Strength and sensation return to
normal within a few hours. Other physical findings common in electrical injury are
confusion, amnesia, headache, visual disturbance, and seizure. Direct spinal cord
injury has been reported after hand-to-hand flow with damage to C4-C8.
The most serious effect, especially common after lightning strike, is injury to
the respiratory control center in the medulla, resulting in respiratory arrest. In
addition, lightning and electrical injury victims often have fixed and dilated pupils
as a result of autonomic responses, and this should not be interpreted as a sign of
nonsurvival until cerebral function is fully assessed.
As in any apneic trauma victim, the airway, oxygenation, and ventilation should
be restored immediately. CT scan of the head is indicated in patients with neurological

findings or loss of consciousness to evaluate for possible intracranial pathology.
Spinal immobilization should be continued until neurological examination is normal or injury is ruled out radiographically. Most victims of electrical and lightning
injury without cardiac arrest will survive, but should be counseled that persistent
sequelae, including memory deficit, sleep disturbances, dizziness, fatigue, headaches,
and attention deficits may occur.

Skin Burns are common after high-voltage electrical injury, but are less often seen
after lightning strike because of instantaneous exposure time. Victims of electrical injury have “flush burns” caused by heat generated by the electrical current, or
“flame burns,” usually as a consequence of ignition of clothing. Because of its instantaneous exposure time, burns are less common after lightning injury. Lightning
strike can cause partial-thickness linear burns in areas of high sweat concentration
and low resistance, which result in a transient fern-like skin pattern called the
Lichtenberg figure that is pathognomonic of lightning. In children, the most common
mode of electrical injury is from chewing or biting electrical cords, which manifests
as perioral edema and eschar formation.
Thorough physical examination will reveal any cutaneous manifestations of
electrical injury. Early intravenous access should be established for fluid management as soon as possible in any burned patient. Fluids should be titrated to adequate
urine output. Severe injuries will require admission to a specialized burn unit.
Children may have excessive bleeding from the labial artery as a consequence of
perioral burn.
Special Considerations
Other injuries associated with electrical and lightning injuries include fractures
from severe muscle contraction or blunt trauma after exposure. Upper limb and
spinal fractures are common. The kidneys are particularly vulnerable to anoxic
damage that accompanies electrical injury, where rhabdomyolysis is common.
However, rhabdomyolysis is rare after lightning injury. Rupture of the tympanic
membrane occurs in up to 50% of lightning victims. Cataracts often present as a
late sequelae of lightning strike. Curling ulcers are common in burn victims, and
preventative treatment for these stress ulcers should be initiated at admission.
When lightning injuries are not witnessed, some victims may simply be found
down, and in those situations, thorough evaluations need to be initiated to look for
other causes (cerebral vascular accident, toxic ingestions, spinal cord injuries, closed
head injuries, myocardial infractions, and primary seizure disorders) responsible for
the unexplainable neurologic and cardiovascular deficits.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
46.1 A 40-year-old man who is employed as an electrician is brought to the ED after
he accidentally grabbed a high-voltage wire, and this caused him to fall from
a 8-ft ladder onto his back on the pavement below. He was ambulatory at the
scene but because of persistent pain in his left hand and arm, he presents to
the ED for treatment. He is conscious and conversant but complains of intense
pain in a 3-cm burn wound on his left hand and also pain throughout his left
forearm. On examination, the patient has GCS of 15 and is stable from the
cardiopulmonary view. He has dry eschar over the hand wound, the sensation
and motor activities are diminished in his left hand, and he has ﬁrmness and
tenderness throughout the left forearm. Which of the following next step is
most appropriate?
A. Obtain x-rays to rule out fractures.
B. Measure forearm compartment pressures.
C. Administer systemic antibiotics to prevent skin infection.
D. Obtain electromyograms (EMGs) to rule out peripheral nerve injury.
E. Obtain a CT scan to evaluate the muscle and nerves.
46.2 A 49-year-old man was ﬁxing the electrical wiring in his house as a remodeling project and neglected to shut off the electricity at the electrical box. He
suffered a substantial electrical injury primarily on the right hand, and was
taken by paramedics to the ED. Which of the following is most likely to be
true regarding electrical injury?
A. Cataract formation usually only occurs when there is a contact point on
the head.
B. Renal failure is usually a result of direct electrical injury to the kidney.
C. With high-voltage injuries, dysrhythmia usually develops 24 to 48 hours
after injury.
D. Electrical burns commonly produce a fern-like skin burn pattern.
E. Even with minor cutaneous involvement, major internal injury can occur.
46.3 A 13-year-old adolescent boy and his friend were curious about the inner workings of high-voltage transformers. After scaling the fence around one such
complex near their school, one of the boys touched the transformer, believing
that because he was wearing rubber-soled tennis shoes, he would be immune to
electrical shock. He suffered a signiﬁcant jolt of electricity at 10,000 V. Which
of the following organ systems is most susceptible to high-voltage injuries?
A. Bones, tendons, and muscles
B. Skin, brain, and fat
C. Fat, heart, and skeletal muscle
D. Blood, nerves, and mucous membranes
E. Hair

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

465

46.4 A 45-year-old accountant was getting into his car on the top of his high-rise
ofﬁce building during a thunderstorm. Suddenly, a lightning strike occurred,
throwing him to the ground. Which of the following is most accurate regarding complications to his injuries?
A. Tetanic contractions are commonly caused by AC current.
B. The instantaneous duration of exposure lessens cutaneous burn risk compared to other high-voltage electrical injuries.
C. Rhabdomyolysis is a common delayed sequelae.
D. Respiratory arrest is caused by paralysis of thoracic muscles.
E. Lightning strike carries 80% mortality.

ANSWERS
46.1 B. This patient’s history of high-voltage injury and current complain of intense
forearm pain, diminished motor and sensory function in the hand, and tenseness in the forearms are highly suspicious for compartment syndrome secondary to myonecrosis in the forearm. Direct compartment measurement is the
most rapid and reliable approach to diagnosis. Even though fracture can occur
from the fall, bony injury would not account for motor and sensory changes
in the hand. Treatment of burn wounds with systemic antibiotics is not indicated. CT scan is not sensitive for identiﬁcation of compartment syndrome.
46.2 E. Even with minor cutaneous involvement, major internal injury can occur.
The renal failure following electrical shocks generally occurs as a result of
myoglobinuria. Although dysrhythmia is common after electrical injury, it
almost always develops immediately after exposure. Cataract formation may
occur even when there is no contact point on the head. Lichtenberg ﬁgure
is the transient fern-like pattern that occurs on the skin of lightning strike
victim because the electricity is splashed onto skin based on the vascular and
nerve distribution patterns of the skin.
46.3 D. In high-voltage injuries, the electricity tends to follow the path of least
resistance. Blood, nerves, and mucous membranes are frequently injured after
electrical exposure because of their low resistance. Fat, bones, and tendon
have high resistance.
46.4 B. Because of instantaneous exposure, burns are relatively rare in lightning
injury. Lightning is DC current, and respiratory arrest is usually a result of
injury to the respiratory control center in the medulla. Rhabdomyolysis is
common after high-voltage electrical injury, but rare after lightning strike.
Contrary to popular beliefs, the mortality associated with lightning injuries
are low with most recent series reporting rates of 5% to 10%.

466

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

CLINICAL PEARLS


Victims of lightning strike should be treated with aggressive ventilatory
and circulatory support until cerebral function can be assessed, because
many patients will recover function with time.



Typical signs of brain death, fixed/dilated pupils and apnea, do not necessarily indicate brain death in electrical victims. Moreover, typical triage
criteria for mass casualty situations do not apply to electrical injury.



Even with small outward sign of injury, major internal damage is common.

Children may have excessive bleeding from chewing on electrical cords.

CASE 47
A 10-year-old boy with sickle cell disease presents to the emergency department
(ED) in the midst of presumed sickle cell crisis manifested as severe abdominal
pain, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and fever. His initial hemoglobin is 9 g/dL,
white blood cell count (WBC) is 15,500 cells per mm3, and chest x-ray reveals a
nonspecific infiltrate in the left lung field with a small left pleural effusion. The
electrocardiogram reveals sinus tachycardia. Following treatment with intravenous
fluid, supplemental oxygen by nasal canula, parenteral analgesics, and empiric
broad-spectrum antibiotics therapy, the patient complained of worsening dyspnea
and chest pain, requiring increased oxygen supplementation by face-mask and
eventual endotracheal intubation. At this juncture, exchange transfusion therapy
is contemplated.

ANSWERS TO CASE 47:
Transfusion Complications
Summary: A 10-year-old boy with sickle cell crisis associated with severe respiratory symptoms (acute chest syndrome). The patient continues to have significant
respiratory symptoms despite supportive care, and therefore exchange transfusion
therapy is considered.
• Transfusion complications: Transfusion reactions and transfusion-related
infections.
• Ways to reduce transfusion complications: Strict adherence to patient identification, specimen handling, and blood product storage protocols, and thorough
review of transfusion history. Transfuse blood products based on need rather
than arbitrary transfusion triggers.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Develop an understanding of the epidemiology and basic pathophysiology of
transfusion reactions.
2. Learn the evaluation and treatment of acute, life-threatening transfusion
complications.
3. Learn the indications for blood product transfusion.

Considerations
Because sickle cell disease predisposes the patient to chronic anemia, it is more
than likely that this particular patient has had an extensive history of transfusions;
therefore, a thorough review of the transfusion history is vital. If the patient or
the medical records indicate prior occurrence of minor transfusion reactions, then
premedication with antihistamines and/or antipyretics may be useful. As a group,
patients who are homozygous for sickle hemoglobin are at markedly increased risk
of suffering complications from transfusion therapy, including transfusion-related
infections (approximately 10% are infected with hepatitis C virus), and noninfectious etiologies related to alloimmunization (affecting up to 50% of sickle cell
patients). The increased risks of alloimmunization are primarily related to recurrent
antigen exposure and phenotypic dissimilarities between blood cells in the predominately white-donated blood supply and African American sickle cell patients.
To reduce the risk of transfusion-related complications, blood banks have intensified the cross-matching process for transfusions in sickle cell patients, with a demonstrable decrease in rates of alloimmunization. Leukocyte-reduced packed red blood
cells (PRBC) are recommended for patients with sickle cell disease and other
patients requiring recurrent transfusions. Additional benefits include a reduced
rate of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmunization, and possible decreased
rates of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs).

APPROACH TO:
Transfusion Complications
CLINICAL APPROACH
Conceptually, transfusion complications are best categorized into acute immunemediated reactions, delayed immune-mediated reactions, nonimmunologic complications, and infectious complications.

ACUTE IMMUNE-MEDIATED REACTIONS
Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions
Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions occur in 1:25,000 transfusions and cause death
in 1:470,000 transfusions. The majority of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are
due to errors made during the processing of the blood, either at the patient bedside
or in the blood bank. The majority of these reactions may be avoided with meticulous specimen processing, patient identification, and transfusion guidelines. Onset of
reaction is immediate, presenting with a combination of hypotension, tachypnea
(often with the sensation of chest constriction), tachycardia, fever, chills, nausea,
hemoglobinuria, and body pain (joints, lower back, legs). Hemolysis can be either
intravascular (more severe) or extravascular and is directed toward donor red blood
cells (RBCs), usually mediated by preformed antibodies (anti-A, anti-B) within the
recipient’s serum. Because the causative antibodies to ABO group antigens are preexisting in susceptible individuals, no prior alloantigen exposure is necessary for acute
hemolysis to occur. However, recent sensitization to other alloantigens (such as
an Rh-negative patient being exposed to Rh-positive blood) can result in similar
pathology if a subsequent blood transfusion contains the same alloantigen(s). Given the
potential for new alloantibody formation, a blood sample from the recipient should
only be used for cross-matching assays within 48 hours from the time of collection.
Immediate management of suspected cases includes stopping the transfusion and
changing the IV tubing or using alternative access sites to initiate aggressive crystalloid infusions, aiming to maintain urine output above 1 to 1.5 mL/kg/h for 24 hours.
The remainder of the transfusion and a sample of the patient’s blood should be sent
to the blood bank for testing. The sequelae of acute hemolysis include acute tubular
necrosis (ATN), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and myocardial
ischemia (as a consequence of hemodynamic instability). DIC may be confirmed by
the presence of hemoglobinuria and plasma-free hemoglobin. The definitive diagnosis of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions is made with direct antiglobulin test
(DAT, also known as the direct Coombs assay), which detects antibody or complement bound to the surface of donor RBCs in a sample of the recipient’s blood.

Febrile Nonhemolytic Transfusion Reactions
These reactions occur with approximately 0.5% to 1% RBC units, 2% apheresis
platelet unit, and 5% to 30% donor-pooled platelets. Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR) constitute the most common and least-worrisome

470

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

complications of blood product transfusion. Patients may present with fever, chills,
rigors, headache, malaise, and tachycardia, but without hemodynamic instability
and respiratory compromise. Because prior history of transfusion is required for this
reaction, fever in a first-time transfusion recipient should be treated as an acute
hemolytic reaction until proven otherwise. Conversely, prior episodes of FNHTR
indicate an increased risk of recurrence.
Management may include stopping the transfusion, administration of an antipyretic, and patient reassurance. Patients with a history of febrile reactions can be
premedicated with antipyretics. Antipyretic premedication is a matter of preference,
but should be generally avoided in first-time transfusion recipients, because fever
is more likely to represent serious sequelae in these patients. Because FNHTR is a
diagnosis of exclusion, samples of patient’s blood and the transfusate should be sent
to rule out a hemolytic reaction or bacterial contamination.

Allergic Transfusion Reactions
The incidence of these allergic reactions is 1% to 3% of transfusions, and the reactions are caused by recipient antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig] E) against donor
serum proteins; symptoms may range from urticaria to frank anaphylaxis. Urticaria
can be managed symptomatically with antihistamines and by briefly stopping the
transfusion until symptoms resolve. Mild allergic reactions do not necessitate discontinuing the transfusion, as symptoms are not strictly dose related. Patients prone
to develop these reactions can be premedicated with antihistamines to prevent the
development of mild allergic reactions.
Frankly, anaphylactic reactions to blood products are rare (1:20,000 to 1:170,000)
and can occur within seconds of transfusion initiation. Anaphylactic reactions are
IgE-mediated and occur, in most cases, as the result of genetic deficiency of IgA
in the recipient, resulting in the production of anti-IgA, -IgE. Other less-common
causes of anaphylaxis include reactions caused by IgE against allergens in the transfused blood, and the passive transfer of reactive IgE from donor to the recipient.
Patients with known IgA deficiency should be given RBCs and platelets that
have been thoroughly washed free of plasma proteins. Plasma component transfusions in IgA-deficient patients should be obtained from IgA-deficient donors.
Anaphylaxis should be managed by immediately addressing the ABCs (airway,
breathing, circulation), accompanied by the administration of epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids, along with the immediate discontinuation of the
transfusion. Patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors will
have more severe anaphylactic reactions (ie, severe angioedema) because of their
inability to degrade bradykinin.

Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury
Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), with an estimated incidence of
1:4500 transfusions, is an under-recognized life-threatening complication of transfusion. TRALI is thought to be mediated by anti-leukocyte antibodies, resulting in
systemic inflammation and neutrophil-mediated lung injury. The onset is generally
within 6 hours of exposure to plasma-containing transfusion products, with most
cases occurring within 1 to 2 hours. Random donor platelet transfusions (pooled

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

471

platelets) are responsible for the majority of cases. Patients with hematological
malignancies and cardiac disease are at increased risk of developing TRALI. Fever,
tachycardia, and dyspnea are the most common presenting symptoms. The hallmark
of this complication is respiratory distress with the presence of diffuse, bilateral
alveolar and interstitial infiltrates on radiographic imaging. TRALI may be easily
confused with acute pulmonary edema secondary to volume overload. Because
TRALI patients have normal to low left-heart pressures, echocardiography may
be useful to differentiate between TRALI and pulmonary edema. The management of this condition consists of stopping the transfusion and immediate attention
to the “ABCs,” which may include intubation and mechanical ventilation. Respiratory compromise is usually self-limiting within 48 to 72 hours. The mortality rate
associated with TRALI is about 10%.

DELAYED IMMUNE-MEDIATED REACTIONS
Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions
Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) are notably less severe than their
acute hemolytic counterparts. The incidence is about 1:1000 transfusions. The
mechanisms of DHTR are related to recipients having developed antibodies against
RBC alloantigens from prior foreign RBC exposures, most often through transfusions or pregnancies.
Unlike acute hemolytic reactions, which require high circulating levels of reactive antibodies, the alloantibodies responsible for DHTR are present only at low
levels prior to transfusion. Following exposure to these alloantigens, antibody generation is slowly increased over the following days, resulting in hemolysis of the
donor RBCs. Symptoms associated with DHTR are mild to nonexistent. Patients
typically present with a mild fever and recurrent anemia. No specific therapy is
warranted aside from repeat transfusion.

Graft-Versus-Host Disease
Transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a rare disorder where donor
lymphocytes engraft and proliferate in the recipient’s bone marrow, which over time
may lead to a severe graft-mediated reaction against the recipient’s tissues, including the bone marrow. It is fatal in more than 90% of cases. Symptoms of GVHD
develop on average 1 to 2 weeks following transfusion and include fevers, maculopapular rashes, hepatitis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and pancytopenia
leading to sepsis and death. Immunocompromised recipients are especially at
risk for GVHD; therefore, blood products administered to these patients should
be subjected to gamma irradiation to render remaining leukocytes incapable of
proliferation. Blood products donated by first-degree relatives or between patients
with partially matched HLA haplotypes have an increased risk of donor lymphocyte engraftment because of homology between donor and recipient HLA genes;
therefore, blood product donated by first-degree relatives should be irradiated
prior to transfusions. The highest incidence of GVHD has been from regions
where the population is racially homogeneous with highly likelihood of shared

472

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

HLA haplotype (eg, Japan). GVHD is most problematic when patients receive
fresh blood that is processed within 7 days from time of collection. In the United
States, blood products that are older than 7 days generally do not contain viable
lymphocytes.

Post-transfusion Purpura
Post-transfusion purpura is a rare complication, characterized by sudden thrombocytopenia occurring 5 to 10 days following transfusion of any blood product. The
pathophysiology involves native platelet destruction, mediated by antibodies to
the platelet antigen (PLA)1. Anti-PLA1 antibodies develop in patients previously
exposed to foreign platelets through transfusion or pregnancy. Patients usually
present with spontaneous bleeding (mucous membranes, epistaxis, hematochezia,
hematuria). Nine percent of patients may develop intracranial hemorrhage.
Treatment involves administration of intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids,
plasma exchange therapy, and transfusion with PLA1-negative platelets. If left
untreated, the thrombocytopenia usually resolves spontaneously within 2 weeks
of onset.

Alloimmunization
Alloimmunization refers to the formation of new antibodies against antigens on
donated cells. The formation of alloantibodies against HLA surface molecules
may render patients refractory to platelet transfusions, thus supporting the administration of leukoreduced blood for patients who will likely need exogenous platelets in the future. The presence of alloantibodies is primarily responsible for the
increased rates of transfusion complications seen in repeat transfusion recipients.

Infectious Complications
The most frequent and concerning infectious complication of transfusion therapy
is bacterial contamination, which can be detected in up to 2% of blood products.
The most commonly isolated organism in refrigerated products (ie, RBCs) is
Yersinia enterocolitica, which can grow at temperatures as low as 1°C (33.8°F). Other
cryophilic organisms include Pseudomonas, Enterobacter and Flavobacterium. Platelets,
which are stored at room temperature (22°C-24°C [71.6°F-75.2°F]), are more likely
to develop gross contamination than are refrigerated products. Staphylococcus and
Salmonella are often reported in fatal cases of platelet transfusion-mediated sepsis.
Signs and symptoms may include fevers, rigors, chills, rash, hypotension, and even
shock accompanied by sepsis. Symptoms may develop immediately or over several
hours. Suspected cases of contamination should be managed with respiratory
and circulatory support, immediate discontinuation of the transfusion, and broadspectrum antibiotic therapy. Because it is difficult to distinguish some of the immunemediated transfusion reactions from bacterial transmission, any transfusion that
causes hypotension in the setting of fever warrants immediate testing of the
donor blood with Gram stain and culture, in addition to standard workup for
hemolytic reactions.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

473

Indications for Blood Products
Given the potential complications from blood product transfusion, it is imperative
that physicians understand and follow the indications for blood transfusion. The
transfusion of blood products is indicated in patients with acute blood loss associated with hemodynamic instability and those with large amount of ongoing blood
loss in hemodynamically stable individuals. The use of transfusion triggers had been
a common practice in the past; however, based on the findings of a randomized
controlled clinical trial (TRICC trial), hospitalized patients maintained at a hemoglobin values of 7 to 9 g/dL had lower in-hospital mortality than those maintained at
hemoglobin values of 10 to 12 g/dL. The findings of the TRICC trial demonstrated
that critically ill patients (with the exception of patients with acute coronary syndrome) can tolerate much lower hemoglobin levels, and the transfusion of packed
RBC should be determined based on patients’ needs rather than an arbitrary laboratory value. Platelet transfusion is generally indicated in patients with platelet count
of less than 10,000 μL, 10,000 to 20,000 with bleeding, less than 50,000 with a
severe trauma, and those with bleeding time greater than 15 minutes. Fresh-frozen
plasma transfusion is considered appropriate in bleeding patients with prothrombin
time more than 17 seconds and following massive transfusion where replacement
of 1 unit of fresh-frozen plasma and one single donor platelet unit for each unit of
PRBC transfused is recommended as a strategy to improve clotting and hemostasis
(hemostatic resuscitation).

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

60 mm Hg. Which of the following agents may have worsened this patient’s
condition?
A. Lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor)
B. Atenolol
C. Lactated Ringer solution
D. Morphine sulfate
E. Salicylate

474

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

47.2 A 60-year-old woman with chronic anemia caused by a myeloﬁbrosis presents
to the emergency room from her oncologist’s ofﬁce with a hemoglobin of
6 g/dL. She notes feeling very lethargic over the past week, and had some mild
chest discomfort while climbing stairs in her house last night. A type- and
cross-match is performed for 2 units of packed erythrocytes, which are given
without incident and marked improvement in her symptoms is seen. While
going over discharge instructions with the emergency physician, the patient
notes that she feels feverish and slightly short of breath. Over the next several minutes her dyspnea worsens markedly. Vital sign measurement reveals an
oxygen saturation of 93%, a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, and a blood
pressure of 95/55 mm Hg. The patient continues to deteriorate from a respiratory standpoint despite supplemental oxygen, requiring endotracheal intubation. A portable chest radiograph shows evidence of diffuse bilateral inﬁltrates.
Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this patient’s
condition?
A. This patient’s left ventricular end-diastolic pressure is likely to be
elevated.
B. This condition has a mortality rate of up to 90%.
C. Diuretic therapy is unlikely to be effective.
D. Radiographic abnormalities develop several days after the onset of clinical
manifestations.
E. Mechanical ventilatory support is generally not helpful.

ANSWERS
47.1 A. Patients taking ACE inhibitors may experience a more severe anaphylactic
reaction than other patients because of their inability to degrade bradykinin;
however, these agents do not confer an increased risk of anaphylaxis. Patient
misidentiﬁcation is the leading preventable cause of transfusion reactions.
47.2 C. Patients with TRALI are not volume overloaded, but rather suffer from
increased capillary permeability at the level of the pulmonary vasculature.
As such, they have normal to low left-side heart pressures, and will only be
harmed by diuretic therapy because of the potential to cause organ hypoperfusion.
Mortality rates are around 10%. Radiographic abnormalities are present
almost immediately, and persist for several days after the resolution of clinical
manifestations. Mechanical ventilatory support is a mainstay of therapy for
patients with suspected TRALI, as the process is generally self-limiting.

CASE 48
A 17-year-old adolescent boy arrives at the emergency department (ED) after he
developed the acute onset of severe right testicular pain about 4 hours ago while
at soccer practice. The patient does not recall any recent trauma to the area and
denies any fever, dysuria, or penile discharge. Although he is nauseous, he does
not have any abdominal pain or vomiting.
On examination, his temperature is 99.5°F, blood pressure 138/84 mm Hg,
heart rate 104 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. He
is in acute distress due to pain. His abdomen is benign. On visual inspection, he
has right scrotal erythema and swelling although no penile lesions or discharge.
Because his scrotum is so diffusely tender, it is difficult to examine it more closely.
However, there is no testicular rise when his inner thigh is stroked. His urinalysis
shows 3 to 5 white blood cells (WBCs)/high power field (hpf).

ANSWERS TO CASE 48:
Scrotal Pain
Summary: This is a 17-year-old adolescent boy who presents with acute onset right
testicular pain without any preceding trauma.
• Most likely diagnosis: Testicular torsion
• Next diagnostic step: Urological consultation. Manual detorsion can be attempted
while awaiting the consultant.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain.
2. Recognize the clinical signs and symptoms associated with testicular torsion.
3. Understand the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to suspected testicular
torsion.

Considerations
The differential diagnosis of acute testicular pain includes testicular torsion,
epididymitis, orchitis, torsion of the testicular appendages, hernia, hydrocele, and
testicular tumor (Table 48–1). Because of the risk of ischemia and infarction of the
testes, testicular torsion is the priority condition that must be promptly recognized
and treated. This patient is 17 years old without a history of trauma. Adolescents
during puberty are especially at risk of testicular torsion because of high hormonal
stimulation. This patient’s history of acute onset, especially associated with vigorous
physical activity, is classic. The involved testis is firm, tender, and located higher
in the scrotum on examination, and the cremasteric reflex is absent, again consistent with testicular torsion. When the clinical presentation is unclear, Doppler flow
studies of the intratesticular blood flow may be helpful. This patient, however, has a
clear-cut diagnosis, and time is of the essence.

APPROACH TO:

Scrotal Pain
CLINICAL APPROACH
When any male presents with scrotal pain, testicular torsion must be considered.
Prompt diagnosis and therapy are vital because delays can lead to ischemia, loss of
the testicle, and impaired fertility. In general, the best salvage time of the testis is
attained within 4 to 6 hours after the onset of pain, but clinical parameters are often
unreliable. Patients with testicular torsion often have a congenital “bell clapper”
deformity, which allows the epididymis and testicle to hang freely and rotate in
the scrotum. When torsion occurs, the spermatic cord becomes twisted, cutting off
the blood supply to the testicle. Although torsion can occur at any age, it is most
common in children less than 1 year old and around puberty.
When obtaining the history, the clinician should focus on the onset and duration of pain, alleviating and aggravating factors, and any associated symptoms, such
as nausea and vomiting, fever, urethral discharge, and dysuria. He/she should also
remember that some patients may complain of abdominal rather than scrotal pain.
In addition, it is important to inquire about any previous episodes and any recent
trauma. A typical patient with testicular torsion presents with the sudden onset of
severe pain in the lower abdomen, inguinal area, or scrotum. Associated nausea
and vomiting are common. The pain is often preceded by strenuous physical activity
or trauma although episodes can occur during sleep. Pain that persists for more than
one hour after scrotal trauma is not normal and merits further investigation. Past
episodes that resolved spontaneously are not uncommon.
On examination, the clinician should pay close attention to any abdominal findings, scrotal swelling or skin changes, penile discharge or rash, inguinal lymphadenopathy or hernia, and testicular tenderness or masses. Classically, a torsed testicle
is diffusely tender and swollen with an abnormal (horizontal) lie. There is usually
a loss of the cremasteric reflex on the affected side. However, no historical or examination findings can definitively distinguish testicular torsion from other disease processes. In addition, infants and children may lack the typical examination findings.
Testicular torsion is largely a clinical diagnosis, and no diagnostic tests should
delay urological evaluation and surgical exploration. If the diagnosis is uncertain,
color-flow Doppler ultrasound (US) or radionuclide scintigraphy may be helpful.
With testicular torsion, Doppler US will reveal decreased or absent testicular blood
flow. The utility of these studies may be limited by their availability and timeliness.
In addition, scintigraphy does not provide any anatomical information, and therefore
cannot differentiate epididymitis from torsion of the appendix testis. Many times,
leukocytes are found in the urine of men with testicular torsion. This finding should
not distract the clinician from the diagnosis.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

481

TREATMENT
When the diagnosis of testicular torsion is considered, prompt urological consultation is mandatory. Definitive treatment involves emergent surgical exploration,
detorsion, and orchiopexy. While awaiting urological consultation, the clinician
may attempt manual detorsion. Because most torsions occur in a lateral to medial
manner, the testis should initially be turned in a medial to lateral direction like
“opening a book.” Successful detorsion results in significant pain relief. If the pain
worsens, however, the maneuver should be tried in the opposite direction. Intravenous access and analgesics are also necessary. The differential diagnosis for acute
scrotal pain includes several benign and emergent conditions (Table 48–1).

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
48.1 A 22-year-old baseball player comes to the ED complaining of 10 hours of
severe right testicular pain. He denies a history of trauma. On examination,
his right testis is diffusely tender and indurated, and the pain does not change
with patient position. He has a cremasteric reﬂex on the right side. Which of
the following is the best next step?
A. Continued observation
B. Oral antibiotics
C. Bed rest, ice to scrotum, and elevation of the scrotum
D. Surgical exploration of the scrotum
48.2 A 32-year-old jogger is brought into the emergency room with the acute onset
of severe left testicular pain. A diagnosis of testicular torsion is made, and
manual detorsion is successfully accomplished. Which of the following is the
most appropriate advice to this patient?
A. Likely no further therapy is needed.
B. Surgical exploration may be needed if another episode of torsion occurs.
C. Surgical correction will be needed but does not necessarily need to be
done urgently.
D. Surgical exploration still needed to be performed and should occur within
24 hours.

48.3 A 24-year-old man complains of severe left scrotal pain increasing over
24 hours. Urinalysis shows 25 WBC/hpf, and Doppler ﬂow shows increased
intratesticular ﬂow.
48.4 A 58-year-old man complains of urgency, dysuria, lower back pain, and pain
with ejaculation.
48.5 A 14-year-old adolescent complains of 2 days of testicular pain. On examination, there appears to be a tender nodule of the testis. Transillumination
reveals a small blue spot at the affected area.
48.6 A 28-year-old man complains of heaviness in his scrotum. On examination,
there is a ﬁrm, nontender mass involving his right testis.

ANSWERS
48.1 D. The clinical history is consistent with testicular torsion. The presence of a
cremasteric reﬂex does not rule out the disease. Emergency scrotal exploration
is the procedure of choice when the history, physical examination, and imaging tests do not rule out testicular torsion.
48.2 C. Detorsion of the torsed testis converts an emergent condition into one that
is amenable to elective correction. Manual detorsion is not deﬁnitive therapy.
48.3 C. The Doppler ultrasound ﬁnding consistent with epididymitis is increased
or preserved blood ﬂow. Also epididymitis usually has a more gradual onset of
pain. Fifty percent of patients with epididymitis have pyuria or bacteriuria.
48.4 F. Acute prostatitis usually occurs in older patients. Urinary urgency, hesitancy, frequency, and perineal pain with ejaculation are common symptoms.
The most common causative organism is Escherichia coli. Appropriate antibiotic choices include ﬂuoroquinolones (ciproﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin, norﬂoxacin)
as well as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
48.5 A. Torsion of a testicular appendage classically presents as a tender testicular
nodule, and upon transillumination, a “blue dot” may be seen. Color Doppler
blood ﬂow is increased or normal.
48.6 E. Testicular carcinoma classically presents as a painless scrotal mass.

CASE 49
It is approximately 2 AM, when a woman presents to the emergency department
(ED) with her 3-year-old son. According to the mother, the patient had been playing and fell off the upper level of his bunk bed earlier in the evening. On examination, the child is somnolent. His pulse rate is 110 beats per minute, blood
pressure is 100/85 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and Glasgow
coma scale (GCS) score is 11 (eye opening 2, verbal 5, motor 4). There is presence
of soft-tissue contusion over the left frontal scalp and ecchymosis over the left
periorbital region. The chest is clear with bilateral breath sounds. The abdomen
is mildly distended and tender throughout. The patient’s left thigh is markedly
swollen and tender, and all his extremities are mottled and cool.

ANSWERS TO CASE 49:
Trauma and Extremes of Age
Summary: A 3-year-old boy presents several hours after an unwitnessed fall, with
somnolence and external signs of head injury. In addition to the contusions on the
scalp, his abdomen is distended and tender, left thigh is swollen and tender, and his
skin is mottled and cool.
• Most likely responsible mechanism: This child has multiple injuries, possibly
secondary to intentional trauma.
• Next steps in management: Pediatric trauma resuscitation and evaluation to
include administration of intravenous fluids, a thorough examination, and a
computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and abdomen. Protection of the
child by reporting potential child abuse, and admission to the hospital.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Become familiar with the evaluation and management of pediatric and geriatric
patients with multiple severe injuries presenting in shock.
2. Recognize the signs in the presentation of children and elderly patients that are
consistent with abuse and become familiar with the appropriate response.

Considerations
The presentation of this child should raise concerns for multiple reasons, and it is
vitally important to appropriately prioritize your attention to these concerns. The
first priority should be concern over his medical condition, not the mechanism of
the injury. This patient’s vital signs presented in the case scenario are not out of
the range of normal for his age (Table 49–1). Despite the normal vital signs, his
general presentation indicates the potential for multisystem injuries, and putting
that together with the findings of mottled and cool skin indicate that this child is in
hemorrhagic shock until proven otherwise. The vital signs of an injured child can
be within normal ranges for an extended period of time secondary to an excellent
ability to compensate physiologically for hypovolemia. However, when the limits of

that compensatory reserve are reached, the ability of a child to tolerate shock is poor
and his condition will likely decline very rapidly.
The secondary concern regarding this child is the manner in which he presented
suggesting potential abuse. Factors that raise these concerns include the delay in
presentation, the extent of the injuries that appear much more severe than can be
accounted for by the history, the age of the child, and the unwitnessed report
of the injury. All 50 states have mandatory child abuse reporting laws for the treating
physician. Regardless of the management plan, this child should be placed in a protected
environment (admission to the hospital), and a report of suspected abuse should be
submitted. However, the treating physician’s suspicions or emotions should not delay
the child’s medical care (which is the first responsibility). Accurate and complete
evaluations and documentation of your findings in an unbiased manner is the first
important step. Confrontations with family members in the midst of a trauma room
evaluation are rarely fruitful, and can hamper your efforts to care for the child.

APPROACH TO:
The Pediatric Trauma Patient
CLINICAL APPROACH
A systematic and expeditious approach to children with unknown injury mechanisms or mechanisms capable of producing multisystem injury should include a rapid
survey for all potential injuries, consideration of the need for intubation, administration of intravenous fluids, and the prevention of heat loss. CT scan of the head
and abdomen may be obtained for further evaluation as needed, and the patient
should be prepared for operative care as indicated. In those patients with multiple
injuries identified, prioritizing the most life-threatening problem is of paramount
importance. Even when intracranial hemorrhage may be suspected on the basis of
physical presentation, the immediate threat to most children with multisystems
injury is hypovolemic shock from abdominal injury and other hemorrhagic sources.
Addressing blood loss source is critical not only for the correction of hemorrhagic
shock but also for the prevention of secondary brain injury in these patients.
The guidelines found in the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) and advanced
pediatric life support (APLS) manuals should be followed in the initial management
of injured children. The initial priorities are the assessment and maintenance of
airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Determination for immediate intubation is
dependent on the initial evaluation of the child and the resources available.
Certainly, if there is any airway compromise, or if the neurological status raises
concern of airway protection (a GCS score <9; Table 49–2), then intubation is
mandatory. If the airway is not compromised and the GCS score is adequate, then
the decision for elective intubation may be determined by the level of patient cooperation for the timely completion of potentially lifesaving diagnostic studies such as
CT imaging.
The circulation and the neurological status should be the next priorities.
Approximately 90% of pediatric patients presenting with blunt trauma are successfully

managed without operative intervention. However, the initial signs of shock, including tachycardia, skin changes, and lethargy, represent a loss of approximately 25%
of the child’s blood volume (Table 49–3). The likelihood of injury requiring operative control of hemorrhage is much greater in these children, and careful attention should be paid to the amount of fluid or blood that is required to maintain
stable vital signs. A large-bore IV should be started, and two sequential boluses of
20 mL/kg of warmed crystalloid solution should be administered. If further fluids
are required beyond this, then administration of packed red blood cells (10 mL/kg)
should be considered. Evaluation of the abdomen by ultrasound (if unstable) or
CT scan should be performed to determine the extent of injuries. If the vital signs
worsen during the attempt to obtain a head and abdominal CT scan, this should be
abandoned and a laparotomy performed to control any hemorrhage.
There is no doubt that the child presented in this case often presents a considerable challenge. Not only does the possibility of abuse evoke strong emotions that are
difficult to ignore during the evaluation, there is potential of multiple life-threatening
injuries that must be prioritized. A systematic and efficient approach, with focus on
the most immediate of concerns, cannot be emphasized enough (Table 49–4).

THE BATTERED CHILD
There are very few other things encountered by physicians that will evoke such
strong distasteful emotions as child abuse, making one think that reporting of these
cases would not be a significant problem. However, to report a case of child abuse,
the physician must first recognize that it is child abuse. The subtleties of recognizing

child abuse, and the fear of making incorrect accusations of caregivers that appear
well meaning can make this a difficult issue. The reporting and protection of the
battered child is further confounded by the legal requirements for appropriate and
complete documentation by the physician, which often is lacking if suspicions of
abuse were not entertained upon initial presentation.
Intentional injury accounts for approximately 10% of all trauma cases in
children younger than 5 years old. While this figure may be alarming, it also suggests
that the vast majority of trauma in children is actually accidental. There are several
key aspects of the history, physical examination, and presentation of the child that
should alert the practitioner to the possibility that the trauma was not accidental.
Table 49–5 lists suggestive characteristics that should alert the practitioner to abuse.
Skin and soft-tissue injuries are the most common injuries encountered in child
abuse cases. This is followed by fractures, which often are multiple or repetitive. The
third most common problem with child abuse is head injury. Unfortunately, this is
also the injury with the highest mortality.
Currently, there is no federal standard regarding the legal requirements for
reporting of child abuse. However, all states have mandatory reporting legislation
for suspected child abuse that includes healthcare workers, school personnel, social
workers, and law enforcement officers. Very few states recognize the physicianpatient communication privilege as exempt from these reporting requirements.
Most states impose either a fine or imprisonment penalty to individuals that knowingly or willfully fail to report abuse. However, several states also impose penalties
for false reports of child abuse.
When intentional injury is suspected in a pediatric trauma case, the appropriate
child protective agency should be notified after the child’s medical condition is
addressed. During the investigational process, it is often incumbent on the medical
personnel to provide a high-visibility protected environment for the child. Although
it is often emotionally tempting for the physician to become involved in the investigational process, it is important at this stage to maintain focus on the medical

condition. This becomes particularly important in terms of adequate documentation. A complete, unbiased, and well-recorded history and physical examination
can be vital in the protection of the child at a later date.
Particularly important information includes detailed descriptions of the reported
mechanism of the injury, the time of the injury and any delay in presentation, the
presence of witnesses, conflicts, and inconsistencies. A complete physical examination should be documented and should include pictures or diagrams of all bruises,
documentation of the color of each bruise, a complete neurological examination,
and a genital examination. An eye examination for retinal hemorrhages should be
performed because this is often encountered with cerebral trauma and the “shaken
baby syndrome.” Radiographic evaluations should be performed on all extremities
to search for patterns of previous injury (Table 49–6). Any reports from previous
admissions (including from other hospitals) should be referenced.

GERIATRIC TRAUMA
Older patients often have coexisting medical problems that may impact the response
to the acute injuries. Details surrounding the initial injuring events are frequently
relevant (eg, medication reactions, chest pains, strokes). Nevertheless, the basic
approach to trauma in the elderly patient is the same as the approach to the adult
patient.
When assessing the geriatric trauma patient, the possibility of elder abuse must be
taken into consideration. If elder abuse is suspected, practitioners should follow the
same steps used when assessing suspected child abuse.

Physiological Changes
The older age group is one of the fastest growing population sectors in the United
States. Thus, the number of geriatric trauma incidents, arbitrarily defined as affecting those older than age 65 to 70 years, is expected to likewise increase. Injuries in
these individuals are associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stay. Many
physiological changes occur with aging (Table 49–7), including the progressive loss
of myocyte number and increase in myocyte volume resulting in the ventricular stiffness and cardiac diastolic dysfunction. Furthermore, atherosclerotic changes cause
large vessel stiffness and increased afterload. Additionally, aging contributes to diminution of cardiac β-adrenergic response, leading to diminished heart rate response.
Because of the age-related cardiovascular changes, the elderly patient is much less

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

capable of responding to increases in cardiac output demands. Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death among 80-year-old patients in the postoperative
and postinjury settings. The elderly patient’s limited ability to respond to stress and
injuries has prompted some groups to apply age (>70 years) as the sole criteria for
trauma-team activation, and by adapting to this approach, these investigators have
demonstrated significant reduction in geriatric trauma mortality.

Outcome Predictors in Geriatric Patients
Various groups have attempted to identify outcome predictors in geriatric trauma
patients (Table 49–8). “High-risk” patients can be identified based on mechanism,
physiological parameter, and laboratory parameters. In the management of “highrisk” patients, early admission to the ICU, with earlier initiation of invasive hemodynamic monitoring, and aggressive resuscitation based on hemodynamic parameters
are associated with a reduction in geriatric trauma patient mortality. Thus, expedited
patient disposition to allow early invasive monitoring and resuscitation is helpful.
Scalea and colleagues (1990) showed that early resuscitation of the “high-risk”
elderly trauma patients, with goals directed at attaining cardiac output of more than
3.5 L/min and/or a mixed venous saturation of greater than 50%, led to an improvement in survival from 7% in historical control patients to 53% in the aggressively
managed patients. More recent observations have not supported aggressive resuscitation measures based on predetermined parameters, because overly aggressive fluid
resuscitation can contribute to pulmonary and cardiovascular complications. Close
observations and monitoring directed toward the avoidance of tissue hypoperfusion
and minimizing stresses related to hypothermia and pain are the important priorities
during the initial management of older victims of traumatic injuries.
Given the overall poorer survival of geriatric trauma patients, some questions
have been raised regarding the quality of life of the survivors. Long-term studies

include hemodynamic shock upon admission, GCS score <7, age >75 years, head
injury, and sepsis.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

several deep lacerations over the ﬂank region. The parents state that he fell
out of his bed. Which of the following is the most important next step in this
patient?
A. Reporting these injuries to child protective services.
B. Firmly, but without judgment, confront the parents with the discrepancy

49.3 An evaluation of an 80-year-old woman who was a pedestrian struck by an
automobile traveling at a speed of 20 miles per hour identiﬁed right tibia and
ﬁbula fracture, right pubic ramus fracture, and facial lacerations. Her vital signs
are a pulse of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, respiratory
rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a GCS score of 15. Which of the following
sequences of events is the most appropriate in management of this patient?
A. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen; plain x-rays of the
pelvis, lower extremities, and spine; splinting of fractures; and invasive
monitoring in the ICU.
B. CT scan of the abdomen; splinting of fractures; invasive monitoring in
ICU; and x-rays of the pelvis and lower extremities.
C. Invasive monitoring in ICU; splinting of the fractures; and CT of
abdomen.
D. Splinting of fractures; invasive monitoring in the ICU; and CT of
abdomen; and x-rays of the extremities and pelvis.
E. Exploratory laparotomy, splinting of the femur fracture, and pelvic
fixation.

ANSWERS
49.1 D. The ﬁrst and foremost priority is the patient’s medical condition, and as
normal, initially addressing the ABCs. Child protective services probably do
need to be notiﬁed, and the injuries do need to be documented. In general, the
parents should not be confronted, but rather asked about their story.
49.2 C. The normal heart rate and blood pressure levels of a child are substantially
different from that of any adult. These values are normal for this infant; therefore, more aggressive measures are not indicated at this time.
49.3 B. This sequence of events outlined is most appropriate for immediate identiﬁcation of possible intra-abdominal hemorrhagic source in a patient with injury
mechanism capable of producing multiple injuries. When this life-threatening
problem is ruled out, the next steps are early invasive monitoring in the ICU
and stabilization of fractures to decrease pain and injuries to adjacent soft tissue,
while simultaneous efforts are made to identify other non–life-threatening
injuries. Exploratory laparotomy is not indicated in this patient at this
time because she is hemodynamically stable and without clear signs of intraabdominal injuries.

CASE 50
A 24-year-old Gravida 0, Para 0 woman is brought in the emergency center with
a history of heavy vaginal bleeding for 8 days. The patient says that the bleeding
has been heavier than normal and that she has used up to 20 pads per day that
are soaked. She has been passing clots the size of “golf balls” also. She feels faint
and lightheaded. The patient’s mother states that her daughter has had irregular
menses throughout her life, with menses every 30 to 70 days, and bleeding heavy
at times and light at other times. On examination, the BP is 90/60 mm Hg, and
HR is 120 beats per minute. Generally, she is anxious. The mucous membranes
are moist and skin turgor is normal. There is a 2-second capillary refill. The heart
and lung examinations are normal. The abdominal examination reveals slight obesity
with no scars or tenderness. The pelvic examination shows active bright red bleeding.
The vagina has 30 cc of blood in the vault. The cervix appears normal. Pelvic examination reveals a normal-sized uterus and no adnexal masses. There is slight tenderness
but no cervical motion tenderness. The hemoglobin level is 8 g/dL, and platelet
count 160 000/mm3. The pregnancy test is negative.

ANSWERS TO CASE 50:
Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding
Summary: A 24-year-old nulligravid woman is brought into the emergency center
with significant menometrorrhagia for 8 days. The patient has had a long history of
oligomenorrhea. On examination, the BP is 90/60 mm Hg, and HR is 120 beats per
minute. Generally, she is anxious. The skin turgor, mucous membranes, and capillary refill are normal. The pelvic examination shows active bright red bleeding. The
vagina has 30 cc of blood in the vault. There are no abnormalities noted on pelvic
examination. The hemoglobin level is 8 g/dL, and platelet count 160 000/mm3.
The pregnancy test is negative.
• Most likely diagnosis: Dysfunctional uterine bleeding
• Initial management: ABCs—intravenous isotonic saline infusion, urgent pelvic
ultrasound examination, gynecological consultation
• Most likely etiology: Anovulatory state leading to proliferative endometrium
and fragmented endometrial desquamation
• Treatment options of hemorrhage: Intravenous estrogen versus dilatation and
curettage

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be able to define dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) and be aware that it is
associated with normal uterine anatomy.
2. List the common etiologies of abnormal vaginal bleeding.
3. Describe a logical approach to abnormal vaginal bleeding and be aware that dysfunctional uterine bleeding is the most common cause of non–pregnancy-related
abnormal vaginal hemorrhage.
4. Be aware of common treatments for DUB.

Considerations
This is a 24-year-old woman with a long history of oligomenorrhea, possibly due
to polycystic ovarian syndrome. The patient is noted to be obese but there is no
mention of hirsutism or glucose intolerance. The initial attention should be toward
assessment of the patient’s volume status, and resuscitation of intravascular volume
as needed. Pregnancy should be ruled out, since pregnancy-associated vaginal bleeding is usually incomplete abortion, and typically treated by diltation and curettage
(D and C) and not amenable to medical therapy. The emergency physician should
also entertain coagulopathy as an etiology with questions about easy bruising and
bleeding tendencies. Once pregnancy is ruled out, in the absence of significant contraindications (active liver disease, breast cancer, suspicion of endometrial cancer,

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

499

thrombophilia), intravenous estrogen can be initiated. Typically, the bleeding will
dissipate within several hours, and be markedly decreased within 8 hours. Gynecological consultation is paramount since consideration should be given for endometrial sampling when there is suspicion of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. In this
individual, her age makes these conditions less likely. After intravenous estrogen
such as conjugated equine estrogen (Premarin) 25 mg intravenously every 6 hours is
given for 3 to 4 doses, then the patient is usually transitioned to an oral contraceptive agent and menses regulated with these medications.

APPROACH TO:
Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding
DEFINITIONS
MENORRHAGIA: Excessive vaginal bleeding, classically exceeding 80 mL during
menses, or greater than 7 days in duration, which leads to anemia without iron supplementation. Menorrhagia is not associated with irregular menses but heavy menses.
MENOMETRORRHAGIA: Prolonged and/or excessive vaginal bleeding that
occurs at irregular intervals, usually due to anovulation.
OLIGOMENORRHEA: Menses occurring at intervals of greater than 35 days.
AMENORRHEA: Absence of menses for greater than 6 months.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Initial Approach
The initial condition of the patient dictates the rapidity of the evaluation, and therapeutic maneuvers employed. A patient who presents to the emergency center in
frank shock due to excessive vaginal bleeding should have urgent management of
hypovolemia and blood products en route while very basic diagnostic information
is sought. Establishing whether the patient is pregnant is critical, and this should be
determined by a reliable hospital/office test, and not by patient history (contraception, abstinence, home pregnancy test). Screening questions and examination about
amount of vaginal bleeding and presence or absence of clots, number of pads,
and degree that each pad is soaked may be helpful, but multiple research studies
have highlighted the unreliability of an individual’s assessment of their menstrual
bleeding. This initial patient assessment should address the following questions:
1. Is the patient in hypovolemia shock?
2. Is the patient pregnant?
3. Is the patient actively bleeding and to what degree?
4. Is there an obvious etiology for the vaginal bleeding (uterine fibroids, coagulopathy,
cervical cancer, genital tract laceration)?

500

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Because the amount of vaginal bleeding is difficult to characterize, women with
DUB may sometimes present with profound anemia, or volume depletion that is well
compensated. A systematic assessment of volume status will prevent undue delay in
these patients. Also, in older women, myocardial infarction and stroke should be
considered if hypotension is prolonged. The treatment for hypovolemic shock is the
same as that of other conditions, such as trauma.
Pregnancy must be reliably ruled in or out early in the evaluation of patients
with DUB. A complication of pregnancy usually indicates an incomplete abortion,
such that a uterine dilation and curettage should be performed to stop the bleeding.
Other conditions that should be considered include molar pregnancy, and antepartum vaginal bleeding such as placenta previa or placental abruption. When the
uterus is above the level of the umbilicus in a pregnant woman with vaginal bleeding, a speculum examination or digital examination should be avoided since these
actions may exacerbate placenta previa. An ultrasound examination instead is helpful in conditions of pregnancy-related vaginal hemorrhage.
Active vaginal bleeding necessitates more aggressive management. Upon examining the woman, blood stains down the legs indicates significant bleeding, and
the probable need for transfusion. The speculum examination should be performed
to assess for degree of bleeding, lesions of the vagina or cervix, and ascertaining
whether the bleeding is coming from within the uterus (supracervical) versus the
cervix or vagina. Lacerations of the vagina or cervix may indicate instrumentation
or trauma. A digital pelvic examination is performed to assess for cervical pathology,
and also uterine size and shape. In the face of DUB, once structural abnormalities
of the genital tract are ruled out, active bleeding will usually necessitate high-dose
estrogen parenteral therapy or uterine D and C. In situations of less active bleeding,
oral hormonal therapy may be considered.
A systematic approach should be undertaken to assess for underlying causes
of DUB. A history of medication use such as oral contraceptives, IUD use,
depoprovera, family history of coagulopathy, structural lesions of the uterus or
cervix (see Table 50–1), and differential diagnosis of ovulatory dysfunction should
also be considered (see Table 50–2).

Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding
The diagnosis of DUB is one of exclusion after other disorders are ruled out. The
bleeding is due largely to anovulation, that is, unopposed estrogen effect on the
endometrium leading to overgrowth of the endometrium without progesterone to
arrest the growth. Fragments of endometrium slough off leading to bleeding from

denuded endometrium. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition associated with DUB. PCOS is a constellation of obesity, anovulation, hirsutism,
glucose intolerance, oligomenorrhea, and hyperandrogenism. In a woman older than
age 35, or in a younger patient with persistent and prolonged unopposed estrogen,
endometrium sampling should be performed to assess for endometrial hyperplasia or
cancer. A reasonable workup for anovulatory DUB is listed in Table 50–3.
Acute treatment of DUB is principally estrogen-containing hormonal therapy.
With significant bleeding, IV premarin causes re-epithelialization of the denuded
endometrium to arrest bleeding from these “raw surfaces.” Nevertheless, after three
to four doses of parenteral estrogen, the bleeding should be significantly diminished,
and the patient transitioned to an oral combination estrogen/progestin regimen. In
most situations where there is less active bleeding, oral contraceptive agents can be
used. Various regimens are used, and one common method is to use 3 tablets a day of
a combination OC (such as ortho novum 1/35) for 7 days, and then after the 7 days,
the patient should begin the same oral contraceptive 1 tablet a day. Bleeding should
improve within 2 days, and be very minimal within 4 to 5 days. Follow-up should be
arranged within a week. Hormonal therapy should not be initiated until pregnancy
and structural lesions of the uterus are ruled out. Endometrial sampling should be
performed prior to initiation of hormonal treatment if possible. Notably, bleeding
due to uterine fibroids will typically not respond to hormonal manipulation.

In some individuals, estrogen therapy will be contraindicated, such as those
with active liver disease, active breast cancer, or high risk for thrombosis. In those
women, inflation of a Foley balloon in the uterus has been described as a temporarizing measure, and may be life-saving for those patients who cannot receive estrogen
and also are not suitable surgical candidates. However, most of these patients will
undergo uterine D and C, both for diagnostic purposes, and also to acutely arrest the
hemorrhage. It is important to note that the underlying pathological process that
induced the bleeding is not addressed with a D and C, and the patient may return to
the emergency center in several months if the cause is not addressed. Women who
have PCOS for whom oral conceptive agent, or progestins are contraindicated may
need surgical therapy for the bleeding, such as endometrial ablation or hysterectomy.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
50.1 A 16-year-old adolescent girl is brought into the ED with complaints of
signiﬁcant vaginal bleeding with her menses. She bleeds 5 days each month with
heavy ﬂow, utilizing 25 to 30 pads. She is tired and gets dizzy during menses.
On examination, her BP is 80/60 mm Hg and heart rate 120 beats per minute.
Her external genitalia are normal; there are no lesions of the cervix or vagina.
The uterus is normal sized and anteverted. There are no masses or tenderness.
The pregnancy test is negative. Her hemoglobin level is 7 g/dL. The emergency
physician orders a transfusion. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Screen for sexually transmitted infections.
B. Begin intravenous progestin.
C. Consult a gynecologist for endometrial ablation.
D. Screen for coagulopathy.
50.2 A 32-year-old woman is seen in the ED with heavy vaginal bleeding. She states
that she has had irregular menses for 3 years, and at times has “baseball-sized
clots” pass vaginally. On examination, her BP is 120/70 mm Hg and heart rate
90 beats per minute. Her uterus is 4-week size and without tenderness. There
are no abnormalities on pelvic examination including speculum examination
of the cervix and vagina. Approximately 30 cc of dark blood is noted in the
vaginal vault and a moderate ﬂow of blood from the cervix. Her hemoglobin
level is 10 g/dL. Which of the following is the next appropriate step?
A. Begin intravenous estrogen.
B. Administer intramuscular progestin.
C. Transfuse 2 units of packed erythrocytes.
D. Begin oral contraceptives at 3 pills per day.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

503

50.3 A 42-year-old woman is seen in the with profuse vaginal bleeding. She has
a history of diabetes mellitus. On examination, her BP is 100/60 and heart
rate 105 beats per minute. Her uterus is irregular and enlarged and nontender.
There is active bleeding arising from the uterus. Her hemoglobin level is
9 g/dL, glucose level 140 mg/dL and her pregnancy test is negative. Which of
the following is the best management of this patient?
A. Begin IV estrogen therapy.
B. Begin oral progestin therapy.
C. Begin oral contraceptive therapy.
D. Lower the blood sugar.
E. Refer the patient for hysterectomy.
F. Perform endometrial sampling.

ANSWERS
50.1 D. In an adolescent who has signiﬁcant menorrhagia requiring transfusion, the
incidence of coagulopathy approaches 20% to 30%. Von Willebrand disease is
the most common etiology, and will often respond to desmopressin (DDAVP).
Coagulopathy should be ruled out prior to starting estrogen therapy, although
sometimes this is impossible given laboratory constraints. IV progestin has no
role in this condition. Endometrial ablation is appropriate for older women
who have ﬁnished child bearing, and in whom the endometrium has been
assessed for pathology. Endometrial ablation should not be performed on
younger patients.
50.2 D. This patient is appropriate for oral combination contraceptive therapy. She
does not have contraindications, does not seem to require sampling of
the endometrium, and there does not seem to be a structural etiology for the
bleeding. Intravenous estrogen is usually reserved for women with signiﬁcant
active bleeding and requires hospitalization.
50.3 F. This patient is 42 years old with DUB and hence, an endometrial sampling should be performed. In general, the endometrium should be assessed for
women above age 35 years before any hormonal therapy is initiated. The blood
sugar does not need to be acutely lowered. Although the uterus is enlarged
and irregular indicating possible uterine ﬁbroids, an evaluation should be
performed prior to hysterectomy such as pelvic ultrasound and endometrial
sampling.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is a diagnosis of exclusion and
indicates excessive or prolonged bleeding without structural pathology
of the genital tract.



The most common reason for DUB is anovulation, the bleeding pattern
is heavy and unpredictable.



Therapeutic options of acute and active significant vaginal hemorrhage
due to DUB include IV estrogen therapy and uterine D and C. A clinical
effect from the estrogen can be seen within 4 hours.



Pregnancy must be ruled out in any woman presenting with DUB.



Endometrial sampling should be considered in any woman over the age of
35 with DUB and in individuals at risk for endometrial hyperplasia/cancer.



Oral contraceptive agents are a reasonable option for the treatment of
patients with DUB who are hemodynamically stable once pregnancy,
coagulopathy, and structural lesions of the uterus are excluded.



A teenager who presents with DUB may have a bleeding diathesis such
as von Willebrand.

CASE 51
A 28-year-old man arrives at the emergency department (ED) complaining of
3 days of chest pain that began after multiple episodes of retching and vomiting
following a night of heavy drinking. He reported subjective fever and sweats the
day following the initial vomiting. He has been unable to tolerate any swallowing
and has urinated only twice since the onset of symptoms. He describes the lower
anterior chest pain that is non-radiating and of moderately severe intensity. He
has no history of prior chest pain. He also complains of an intermittent sore throat
and painful swallowing. He does not appear short of breath but states that he has
to control his breathing to avoid a “tight feeling in his throat”. He states that his
voice sounds “different” and that he feels weak and faint. The review of systems is
otherwise negative. His temperature is 37°C, HR 132, blood pressure 168/94 and
RR 22 with an O2 saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination shows an ill
and uncomfortable appearing man who is tachycardic, hypertensive, and afebrile.
He has dry mucous membranes and faint bibasilar crackles. He has no past medical
history and is taking no medications.

ANSWERS TO CASE 51:
Noncardiac Chest Pain
Summary: This is a 28-year-old man presenting with acute severe chest pain,
diaphoresis, and dyspnea after multiple episodes of vomiting.
• Most likely diagnosis: Spontaneous esophageal perforation or Boerhaave
Syndrome
• Next diagnostic steps: Place the patient on a cardiac monitor, establish IV
access and obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately. A chest x-ray
(CXR) should be obtained as soon as possible.
• Immediate therapies: NPO, NGT, IV resuscitation with isotonic fluids, broad
spectrum antibiotics, pain management and immediate surgical consultation

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Become familiar with the serious causes of noncardiac chest pain (NCCP).
2. Consider spontaneous esophageal perforation in the differential diagnosis of
chest pain and recognize the key signs and symptoms of Boerhaave Syndrome.
3. Understand the therapeutic approach to NCCP in general and Boerhaave
Syndrome in particular.

Considerations
This case presents a young male ED patient with chest pain who is severely ill.
Failure to recognize, diagnose and treat the acuity and severity of this patient illness
would be catastrophic. While the diagnosis in this case is Boerhaave Syndrome,
the differential diagnosis in this case should also include: esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal spasm, esophageal foreign body, peptic
ulcer disease, hepatitis, pancreatitis, pneumonia, pneumomediastinum, pulmonary
embolism, pericarditis, aortic dissection/aneurysm and musculoskeletal disorders.
Coronary artery disease would be very rare in a 28-year-old individual but should
remain in the differential, especially in young diabetics or those with unusual risk
factors.

APPROACH TO:
Noncardiac Chest Pain
DEFINITIONS
BOERHAAVE SYNDROME: Post-emetic barotrauma induced spontaneous
rupture of the esophagus
GASTROGRAFIN: Water soluble iodinated radiographic contrast agent (each mL
contains 660 mg diatrizoate meglumine and 100 mg diatrizoate sodium). Each 100 mL
contains 37 g of elemental iodine.
BARIUM: Water insoluble particulate suspension of barium sulfate used as radiographic contrast agent

APPROACH TO SUSPECTED BOERHAAVE SYNDROME
Pathophysiology
Boerhaave syndrome results from an increased intraesophageal pressure alternating
with a negative intrathoracic pressure due to straining or vomiting. In most cases,
the tear occurs along the left posterolateral aspect of the distal esophagus, as it is the
least supported portion of the esophagus. Localized cervical esophageal perforation
may also occur and generally follows a benign course. The esophagus is especially
vulnerable to rupture because it lacks a serosal layer, and therefore collagen and
elastin fibers to provide support. It is most common among 40- to 60-year-old males.
Esophageal rupture from other causes is a related but different clinical entity. The
majority of esophageal ruptures are iatrogenic due to endoscopy.
Morbidity and mortality associated with Boerhaave Syndrome are due to an overwhelming inflammatory response to mediastinal soilage caused by gastric contents
and oropharyngeal bacteria deposited in the mediastinal and pleural spaces with
subsequent development of pneumonia, mediastinitis, empyema, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. Untreated Boerhaave Syndrome has a 100% case fatality rate.

Evaluation
Mackler triad: vomiting, lower chest pain, and subcutaneous cervical emphysema
are classically associated with Boerhaave Syndrome, but is seen in a minority of
cases on early presentation. Important potential signs and symptoms include fever,
chest pain, back pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, dyspnea, cervical subcutaneous
emphysema and Hamman sign, a “mediastinal crunch” heard as the heart beats surrounded by mediastinal air. Breath sounds may be decreased on the side of perforation due to pleural effusion.
If esophageal perforation is suspected, a CT scan of the chest should be ordered
promptly. A CXR will likely be the initial study performed and may show pleural
effusion, pneumomediastinum, widened mediastinum or pneumothorax. It should
be noted that on early presentation, the CXR can be negative. CT scan is far more
sensitive and may show esophageal wall thickening, periesophageal fluid, extraesophageal air, and/or air and fluid in pleural spaces. Contrast radiographic studies

508

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

of the esophagus may be necessary to localize the perforation. Although barium is
superior to gastrografin when attempting to locate a small perforation, it causes a
severe inflammatory reaction in the mediastinum or peritoneum. Small esophageal
perforations are frequently missed by both contrast modalities. If a thoracentesis is
performed, fluid should be evaluated for food particles, pH <6 and elevated amylase.
Endoscopy has no role in the evaluation of Boerhaave Syndrome and may exacerbate the perforation due to insufflation during the procedure.

Treatment
An immediate surgical consult should be obtained. Definitive treatment will depend
on the size and location of the perforation, whether preexisting disease is present,
and whether or not it is contained. If the CT scan shows containment, treatment
consists of NPO status, NGT placement with suction to remove gastric fluids and
prevent further contamination, broad spectrum IV antibiotics and parenteral
nutrition. If the perforation is not contained surgical repair is indicated. Liberal
narcotic analgesia and anti-emetics to prevent additional valsalva induced barotrauma
should be given as early as possible in the course of treatment.

Complications
Any delay in diagnosis or treatment will result in increased morbidity and mortality.
Death due to spontaneous esophageal rupture is generally reported in 20% to 40%
of treated cases. Complications of surgical repair include persistent esophageal leaks,
mediastinitis, and sepsis. Despite adequate repair, continued leakage may occur in
up to 30% of patients.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Chest pain (CP) is responsible for more than 6 million visits per year to the ED in
the US. The evaluation of acute CP should always begin with a complete history
focusing on quality, radiation of pain, context of onset, duration, risk factors, and
exacerbating factors.
Due to the high morbidity and mortality of myocardial infarction, an ECG
should be obtained immediately upon presentation to help assess the possibility
of acute ischemia. Even when NCCP is suspected, reevaluation may be necessary if traditional cardiac risk factors suggest a high pretest probability of cardiac
disease. One recent study showed that 2.8% of a study population diagnosed with
NCCP had adverse cardiac events within 30 days. This correlates well with the
reported missed diagnosis rate of 1% to 5% for patients presenting to the emergency department with acute myocardial infarction. The pretest probability of a
cardiac etiology for an episode of CP increases with the patient age and positive
risk factor profile.
How sensitive is ECG in predicting cardiac disease? That depends on how you
ask the question. A meta-analysis of exercise tolerance test results reported a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 77% for cardiac ischemia. A single ECG cannot
logically be any better than this result. Another study reported ECG abnormalities
in 50% to 90% of patients who ultimately died of MI. In short, a work up including ECG with and without pain and serial cardiac enzymes is probably indicated at

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

509

initial presentation for any patient with a moderate or greater pretest probability of
cardiac disease before diagnosing them with NCCP.
NCCP is generally defined as CP occurring in the presence of normal large
epicardial coronary artery anatomy and thus, not related to myocardial ischemia. A
small percentage of these patients may have ischemia due to vasospasm or isolated
distal arterial disease, but this does not change the general approach or differential
diagnosis. The global differential diagnosis of NCCP for any patient should include the
following etiologies in decreasing order of prevalence: musculoskeletal, esophageal/GI,
psychiatric, pulmonary, other cardiac causes (pericarditis, etc), and other/nonspecific.
Despite the preceding statement, the most common cause of NCCP seen in the ED
is GERD.

Differential Diagnosis of Noncardiac Chest Pain
Musculoskeletal Chest Pain: Musculoskeletal CP is usually associated with
a history of trauma, specific injury or repetitive use. It should be reproducible on
careful examination by palpation or through specific motions or movements of the
involved anatomic structures. The pain may also be pleuritic, or associated with
deep breathing. Patients are frequently extremely anxious, making the diagnosis
more difficult. Associated symptoms should be minimal once the effect of anxiety
has been discounted. A detailed knowledge of the muscular and boney anatomy
of the neck, thorax, and upper abdomen is necessary to fully evaluate this cause of
NCCP. Frequently the only evaluation needed will be a careful and complete history
and physical examination. Nonetheless, chest radiography (CXR) is appropriate if
boney or pulmonary disease is being considered. Bedside ultrasound or formal echocardiography may be used to rule out pneumothorax, pericarditis, structural heart
disease or aortic pathology. Liberal utilization of EKG is indicated and appropriate.
Once the diagnosis has been made, appropriate care includes reassurance, analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and temporary behavioral
restrictions to minimize re-injury. Follow-up examination in 1 to 2 weeks is recommended with their PMD.
Esophageal and Gastrointestinal Causes of Chest Pain: Multiple pathologies
of the esophagus may result in CP. These include reflux and chemical esophagitis,
esophageal ulceration, foreign body, perforation and spasm. Esophageal perforation
is discussed elsewhere in this chapter. Esophageal foreign body is usually obvious
from the patient history except in young children and the elderly. In the case presented above, aspirated foreign body is certainly a possibility. CXR and neck films
will identify radiopaque foreign bodies other objects require upper endoscopy for
further evaluation. The remaining pathologic entities may be grouped under the
label of GERD. The history in patients with GERD may include epigastric pain at
night when lying supine and a correlation with large meals near bedtime. Caffeine,
alcohol and tobacco use all decrease lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus
increase the likelihood of reflux. NSAIDs and alcohol use both injure the esophageal mucosa. Long term reflux and esophagitis induce typical histologic changes in
the distal esophageal mucosa and Barrett esophagus, that are diagnostic on biopsy.
Physical examination is nonspecific and may show only subxiphoid or epigastric
tenderness. Acute treatments are not helpful from the standpoint of narrowing the

510

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

differential possibilities. Nitroglycerin relieves GERD associated esophageal spasm
but also relieves cardiac CP. The classic “GI cocktail” of antacid, lidocaine and donnatal relieves GERD pain, but also anesthetizes nerves carrying pain sensations from
other potentially lethal mediastinal pathologies. Thus, neither of these treatments
should ever be used to rule out or rule in any single diagnosis. Long-term management of esophageal disorders includes behavior modification to prevent nocturnal
reflux and various medications (PPI, H2 blocker, mucosal protectants) to allow healing of the esophageal mucosa. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated
with GERD. Triple therapy with PPI, H2 blockers, and antibiotics for eradication of
Helicobacter pylori have resulted in >90% healing rate. Referral to a gastroenterologist for ongoing management is appropriate in more complicated cases.
Diseases of the upper abdominal organs may cause NCCP. Hepatitis can cause
pain that radiates into the upper right chest due inflammation of the right hemidiaphragm. Cholecystitis can result in substernal CP and subxiphoid epigastric pain.
Pancreatitis can cause pain that radiates from the epigastrum into the back and
may radiate into the left chest in association with transudative pulmonary effusion.
Splenic hematoma or infarction can result in CP that radiates to the left upper chest
due to inflammation of the left hemidiaphragm.

Psychiatric Causes of Chest Pain: Depression frequently results in complaints
of chest or abdominal pain. The patient may or may not be aware of the depression.
Patients complaining of CP should be questioned about symptoms of depression such
as anhedonia; early morning awakening, insomnia, and loss of interest or pleasure
in normal activities. Physical examination in the organically depressed may reveal
emotional lability, flattened affect, suicidal ideation, or psychomotor retardation but
is generally negative for specific findings associated with other physical causes of
CP. Somatization is the term applied to a specific type of conversion disorder where
the patient depressive symptoms find focus in a specific physical complaint such
as CP or abdominal pain. The patient may be fixated on the presenting physical
complaint and unaware of the depressive component to their complaint. Diagnostic
work up of this type of patient should be guided by a careful history and physical.
A reasonably extensive initial diagnostic work up is indicated. Diagnosis of a psychiatric etiology for CP must be a diagnosis of exclusion. Recent meta-analysis has
revealed a potential association between the diagnoses of panic attack with anxiety induced CP and CAD in the primary care and ED settings. The care provider
should also keep in mind that depression may coexist with other organic causes of
CP and that this risk increases with age. Also to be kept in mind is that depression
alone may have lethal consequences and requires accurate diagnosis and aggressive
therapy by a mental health care professional.
Pulmonary Causes of Chest Pain: The lungs, air passages and pleura can all
cause chest discomfort. Irritation of the pleura can be caused by peripheral pneumonic inflammation from infectious causes, such as pneumonia; ischemia due pulmonary embolism or infarction; or mechanical irritation due to disruption of
normal anatomy of the visceral and/or parietal pleural due to pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, exudative effusions and some cancers. Infectious causes of CP will
often be suspected if fever and hypoxia are present. Pneumothorax or pulmonary

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

511

embolism should be suspected when the patient has acute unilateral pleuritic pain.
Unilateral pleuritic CP ipsilateral to blunt chest trauma strongly suggests pneumothorax, but pneumothorax may occur spontaneously. Tracheal deviation, hypoxia,
hypotension and hyper-resonance of the hemithorax contralateral to the tracheal
deviation indicate the presence of tension pneumothorax. This is an immediately
life threatening condition that requires emergency needle decompression of the
hyper-resonant hemithorax with a large gauge needle or angiocath. If available, bedside ultrasound (US) may rapidly diagnose pneumothorax in trained hands. If the
patient is unstable, treatment of tension pneumothorax should never be delayed for
radiographic confirmation. Occult hypoxia may be uncovered by obtaining ambulatory pulse oximetry. Physical examination of the chest may reveal rales, rhonchi,
wheezing, decreased breath sounds, signs of consolidation or effusion, and/or abnormalities of the chest wall. These finding may occur together or in isolation and
should be correlated with the history and two view CXR to accurately determine
the cause and scope of the patient pathology. If an infectious etiology is suspected
in a patient likely to require admission to the hospital, then antibiotics should be
administered as early as possible. Current nationwide quality improvement efforts
sponsored by Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) specify ≤6 hour
window, from time of patient arrival, for initial antibiotic administration in pneumonia patients admitted for inpatient care.

Other Causes of Chest Pain: Pericarditis is a non-ischemic cause of cardiac CP
that results from inflammation of the pericardium, the connective tissue sack which
envelopes the heart. The pain associated with this entity is worse when supine and
improves with erect posture or sitting up. Auscultation of the heart may reveal a
rough scratchy sound very different from a murmur associated with cardiac systole
and diastole. This is known as a pericardial friction rub. ECG findings vary over the
course of the disease but, in general, are characterized by diffuse ST segment elevations. Many causes of pericarditis exist. These include but are not limited to postinfarction (Dressler syndrome), autoimmune, infectious (viral, bacterial, fungal),
and traumatic. Viral infection is the most common non-infarction cause. Evaluation
should include ECG, serial cardiac enzymes, and echocardiography. Until proven
otherwise, ischemic cardiac disease should remain high in the differential. Echocardiography can demonstrate a thickened pericardium or a pericardial effusion typical of
the disease and rule out the potentially lethal complication of pericardial tamponade.
Tamponade may develop if pressure from the effusion is great enough to significantly
impair cardiac filling. Emergent treatment consists of immediate pericardial drainage
by needle aspiration. Treatment of pericarditis is more subacute and consists of
analgesics, NSAIDs and frequent follow up until improvement is achieved.
A high suspicion must be maintained for aneurysm/dissection and pulmonary
embolism to avoid missed diagnosis and potentially catastrophic outcomes for
the patients. In both diseases the onset of CP can be sudden and associated with
syncope. In aortic aneurysm the patient complains of CP radiating to the back.
If the dissection involves the root of the aorta, and thus the coronary arteries, the
patient may also have CP due to cardiac ischemia. Early echocardiography and/
or CT imaging will result in timely diagnosis. It is imperative to not treat blindly

512

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

as the treatment for pulmonary embolism can exacerbate aortic dissection and/or
aneurysmal rupture with life threatening results.
Another consideration in a vomiting patient with CP is the less serious but still
potentially life threatening Mallory-Weiss tear. This entity involves a traumatic
mucosal disruption usually located either at the gastroesophageal junction or gastric
cardia. These esophageal tears may result in significant GI hemorrhage and can
perforate if intense vomiting or retching continues. Deeper tears of the esophageal
mucosa may manifest as intramural esophageal hematomas which can develop into
full esophageal perforations with delayed rupture during the inﬂammatory weakening that accompanies healing.
Spontaneous pneumomediastinum without evidence of gastrointestinal or pleural source has been reported. It is usually seen in patients who have suffered from
a valsalva episode against a closed glottis such as may occur during powerful coughing.
Chest pain is universal and on exam a loud crunching sound may be heard as
mediastinal air is squeezed by the beating heart (Hamman crunch). It is hypothesized that the mediastinal air arises from pulmonary interstitial emphysema caused
by bronchoalveolar barotrauma. Crack cocaine smokers appear to be at particular
risk. Despite the ominous CXR findings, this entity has a generally benign course.
Nonetheless, the diagnosis of pneumomediastinum requires a diligent and exhaustive search for both pulmonary and gastrointestinal sources.
Breast pathology should be considered in the differential of NCCP in women
presenting to the ED. Causes of breast pain include infectious etiologies, mastitis
or abscess, benign lumps, cysts, or inflammatory carcinoma. Physical examination
may reveal an asymmetric breast mass with or without signs of significant local
induration, erythema, and tenderness. The patient with more serious pathology is
often febrile. Intravenous analgesics, antibiotics and early surgical consultation are
appropriate.
The preceding list is not exhaustive and difficult clinical cases may require evaluation for more esoteric causes of NCCP. In the geriatric population, many patients
may have more than one operative diagnosis causing their NCCP. As such, it is
imperative that early primary care follow-up be arranged for patients given this
diagnosis.

Presentation of Boerhaave Syndrome (Pressure Induced Esophageal Rupture)
The classical presentation of Boerhaave Syndrome follows an episode of forceful
retching and vomiting and includes retrosternal CP and/or epigastric pain. Odynophagia, dyspnea, tachypnea, cyanosis, fever, and shock may all develop thereafter.
In one review, 40% of patients had a history of heavy drinking, 41% suffered from
PUD, 83% complained of pain, 79% had a history of vomiting, 32% presented with
shock and 39% with dyspnea. The diagnosis of Boerhaave Syndrome may be delayed
because the clinical presentation may not be typical and causes are broad: childbirth,
defecation, seizures, and heavy lifting. Common misdiagnoses include: myocardial
infarction, pancreatitis, lung abscess, pericarditis, and spontaneous pneumothorax.
Concurrent alcohol intoxication may also delay diagnosis.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
51.1 In the initial evaluation of most ED patient with CP, what is the most important diagnostic test?
A. Chest x-ray
B. ECG
C. Serum cardiac markers
D. Computed tomography
E. Cholesterol levels
51.2 Which of the following is the most common cause of NCCP?
A. Musculoskeletal
B. Gastrointestinal
C. Other–nonspecific
D. Psychiatric
E. Pulmonary
51.3 A 45-year-old man with a known history of Boerhaave syndrome and
primary surgical repair 5 years ago presents to the ED complaining of 24 hours
of increasing CP and shortness of breath, what diagnostic test should be
ordered to rule out perforation?
A. ECG
B. CXR
C. CT thorax
D. Barium esophagram

ANSWERS
51.1 B. An ECG to evaluate the patient for evidence of acute ischemia is the first
indicated test. The healthcare provider should always keep in mind that a
negative ECG does not rule out cardiac pathology.
51.2 A. Musculoskeletal conditions is the most common cause. All the listed
answers are causes of NCCP and are listed in decreasing order with respect to
their prevalence in the general population. GERD is the most common cause
of NCCP seen in ED patients.
51.3 C. CT of the thorax is by far the most sensitive and specific test in assessing
for possible esophageal perforation, especially in this patient given the time
course of the symptoms and the history of prior surgery.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Boerhaave syndrome should always be considered in the differential
diagnosis of acute CP and especially if the patient has been vomiting or
performing any activity where barotrauma may have been sustained due
to valsalva maneuver.



Gastrografin should be used instead of barium to avoid severe mediastinal and intra-pleural inflammatory reactions when doing contrast
studies to locate the site of esophageal perforation.



GI Cocktail can not be used to reliably rule out a cardiac etiology for an
episode of CP.



Response to a trial of sublingual nitroglycerin does not distinguish
between coronary artery disease and GERD induced esophageal spasm.



A single normal ECG can not be used to make the diagnosis of NCCP.



A significant percentage of patients (2%-3%) labeled with a diagnosis of
NCCP will have an adverse cardiac event within 30 days.

CASE 52
A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with complaints of
generalized weakness, nausea, and an overall sense of illness. The patient symptoms have progressed insidiously over the past 2 to 3 days. His past medical
history is remarkable for longstanding diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension.
He is currently taking many medications that include a sulfonylurea, a diuretic,
and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. On physical examination,
the patient appears lethargic and ill. His temperature is 36.0°C (96.8°F), pulse rate
is 70 beats per minute, blood pressure is 154/105 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate
is 22 breaths per minute. His head and neck examination shows normal conjunctiva and mucous membranes. There is moderate jugular venous distention. The
lungs have minor bibasilar rales. The cardiac examination reveals normal rate,
no murmurs or rubs, and a positive S4. The abdomen is soft and nontender to
palpation, with hypoactive bowel sounds and no organomegaly. The rectal examination is normal. Skin is cool and dry. Extremities demonstrate pitting edema to
the knees bilaterally. On neurologic examination the patient moans and weakly
localizes pain. He is oriented to person and place but cannot provide any further
history. The initial rhythm strip is shown in Figure 52–1.

ANSWERS TO CASE 52:
Hyperkalemia Due to Renal Failure
Summary: A 54-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes complains of weakness,
nausea, and a general sense of illness. His symptoms have progressed slowly over
3 days. His medications include a sulfonylurea, a diuretic, and an ACE inhibitor. On
examination, he appears lethargic and ill. His BP is 154/105 mm Hg, HR 70 bpm,
temperature 36.0°C (96.8°F), and respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The physical examination reveals moderate jugular venous distension, some minor bibasilar
rales, and lower extremity edema. He is oriented to person and place but is not able
to give further history. The ECG confirms a wide complex rhythm (Figure 52–2).
• Most likely diagnosis: Hyperkalemia
• Next step: Management of the ABCs, including immediate vascular access and
continuous cardiac monitoring, rapid stepwise administration of medication to
reverse the effect of excess potassium (calcium), shift potassium into cells (insulin, sympathomimetics, possibly sodium bicarbonate), and remove potassium
from the body (sodium polystyrene sulfonate or diuretics). Arrange for emergency dialysis and admit to the hospital.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical settings, the signs and symptoms, and complications of
hyperkalemia.

Considerations
This patient has developed end-stage renal failure (also referred to as chronic
kidney disease, stage 5), due to his longstanding hypertension and diabetes. His
damaged kidneys have very little capacity to excrete potassium. ACE inhibitor therapy
contributes to his potassium retention. Acidosis and blunted insulin response both
lead to potassium shifts into the extracellular space. His cardiac cell membranes are
destabilized by the high potassium level and he is at high risk of death by arrhythmia.
His weakness and general sense of illness, while nonspecific, are very typical of
untreated renal failure. Weakness can also be a prominent feature of severe hyperkalemia. It is important to suspect this condition from the history and ECG, because
laboratory test results may be delayed and the patient could die before those test
results become available.
Laboratory studies should be performed and in this patient case, the leukocyte
count is 9000 cells/L, and the patient is mildly anemic with hemoglobin 10.5 and
hematocrit 32%. Electrolytes show sodium of 134 mEq/L, potassium 7.8 mEq/L,
chloride 101 mEq/L, and bicarbonate 18 mEq/L. BUN is 114 mg/dL and creatinine
is 10.5. The serum glucose is 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). The serum amylase, bilirubin, AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase are within normal limits. A 12-lead ECG
confirms the wide-complex rhythm shown previously. His CXR shows mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.
This patient clinical presentation is fairly representative of hyperkalemia in renal
failure. Hyperkalemia is a common complication of end-stage chronic kidney disease, though it can occur in many other clinical conditions. Symptoms of hyperkalemia may be nonspecific or even nonexistent, and are most often dominated by
whatever illness has predisposed the patient to elevated potassium. Morbidity and
mortality may result from delayed or inadequate treatment, since severe hyperkalemia may rapidly progress to arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. Early suspicion, prompt
recognition of associated ECG changes, and prompt resuscitation with effective
agent, are essential. Once resuscitated, the patient will require prompt consultation
for emergent hemodialysis.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Hyperkalemia
CLINICAL APPROACH
Hyperkalemia is a severe metabolic emergency. A delay in treatment may lead to
significant mortality. Up to one-quarter of patients with end-stage chronic kidney
disease will have at least one episode of life-threatening hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can occur from many other conditions, including medication side effects,
ingestion of potassium-containing supplements, crush injuries and burns, and redistribution resulting from acidotic states such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Many cases of
hyperkalemia are discovered as an incidental laboratory finding. Clinical findings
associated with hyperkalemia are summarized in Table 52–1.

Potassium Homeostasis
The average diet contains about 100 mEq of potassium per day, and most is excreted
in the urine, with a smaller component excreted in the stool. Long-term balance is
regulated in large part by the aldosterone system. Renal excretion can be markedly
affected by any impairment of kidney function, and by a wide variety of medications.
Two common and potent inhibitors of renal potassium excretion are the angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors and the potassium-sparing diuretics. The body has a
very large intracellular store of potassium, with the serum potassium representing
only about 2% of the total body store of approximately 3500 mEq. The serum level
is tightly regulated to maintain appropriate gradients across cell membranes. Potassium is actively transported into cells in exchange for sodium by the Na-K-ATPase.
Na-K-ATPase is a target of digitalis glycosides, so hyperkalemia is a prominent feature of severe digoxin poisoning. Potassium uptake into cells is stimulated by insulin
and beta-adrenergic drugs. In states of increased hydrogen ion concentration
(acidosis), potassium may shift out of cells. Also, potassium follows osmotic gradients,
so hyperosmolar states such as DKA may cause increased serum potassium.

Classiﬁcation of Hyperkalemia
From a laboratory perspective, the normal range for serum potassium is 3.5 to
5.0 mEq/L. Levels from 5.1 to 5.5 mEq/L are generally not significant elevations.
The range from 5.5 to 6.0 mEq/L is mild hyperkalemia and significant ECG changes
would be unusual. Levels of 7.0 mEq/L or greater constitute severe hyperkalemia;
prompt aggressive treatment is almost always warranted even if ECG changes are
not severe. Although pseudohyperkalemia can result from hemolysis of the blood
specimen prior to measurement, most clinical laboratories are attuned to this problem and will note hemolysis when it is detected.

ECG Changes of Hyperkalemia
One of the earliest ECG changes of hyperkalemia is a “peaked” appearance to the
T wave. Unfortunately, there is no widely accepted scientific definition of a peaked
T wave, though some authors have suggested imagining the T wave as a seat. If it is
too pointed to sit upon comfortably, then it is likely peaked. Other described changes
of hyperkalemia include widening of the QRS, prolongation of the PR interval,

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

521

QT prolongation, ST changes (which may mimic myocardial infarction), wide
P waves or the disappearance of P waves. Severe hyperkalemia generally causes a
very wide QRS, which may progress to a sine wave pattern and asystole. A variety of
blocks and dysrhythmias may also be seen.
Many textbooks describe a classic progression of ECG changes, and attempt
to correlate those changes with usual levels of potassium. It is vitally important
to understand that this correlation is poor. Patients may have severe hyperkalemia with minimal ECG changes, and prominent ECG changes with mild
hyperkalemia. It is well described that patients with mild ECG changes may suddenly progress to severe changes, and a stepwise progression cannot be counted
upon. Despite these caveats, the ECG remains the best available guide to the
initial therapy of hyperkalemia.

Therapy
Calcium given intravenously is first-line lifesaving treatment. Calcium stabilizes
cardiac cell membranes and can counteract hyperkalemia within seconds to minutes. Unfortunately the effect is not sustained and fades within 10 to 20 minutes, so
additional agents are required. Because of the short-lived effect and potential downsides of hypercalcemia, this author reserves calcium for patients who demonstrate
ECG changes suggestive of hyperkalemia. Calcium should be given to all dialysis
patients who are in cardiac arrest, as hyperkalemia is very frequently a contributing
cause of the arrest. Historically it was believed that calcium was contraindicated in
potential digoxin toxicity, because the heart might undergo a tetanic contraction
from which the patient could not be resuscitated. This historical concern has not
been supported by current science (see Table 52–2).
Calcium is available in two forms, as calcium chloride and calcium gluconate.
Calcium chloride contains approximately three times as much elemental calcium
per unit volume, and is considerably more caustic to soft tissue. Thus, general practice is to use calcium chloride for patients in cardiac arrest or near-arrest situations,
and calcium gluconate for patients with less severe ECG changes.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Sodium bicarbonate given intravenously is a traditional second-line agent for
hyperkalemia. It is thought to shift K into cells by reversing acidosis. It also raises
extracellular sodium levels, which may have beneficial effects on membrane potentials. Some research has called into question the benefit of sodium bicarbonate. In
animal studies, no consistent K-lowering effect could be demonstrated. However,
this may not be an adequate model of academic renal-failure patients, and even
some nephrologists who have questioned the efficacy of bicarbonate continue to
recommend it.
Insulin therapy is a mainstay in the acute management of hyperkalemia. Five to
ten units of regular insulin given IV can reliably lower serum potassium approximately 0.5 mEq/L for 1 to 2 hours. Of course this therapy can cause hypoglycemia, so
the insulin is usually given with 25 g or 50 g of 50% dextrose. Some have advocated
giving just the D50, expecting the patient endogenous insulin stores to lower the
potassium. However, many patients who experience hyperkalemia will be diabetic
and may have impaired or absent insulin release. Furthermore, it has been shown in
animal studies that large osmolar loads may transiently increase serum potassium.
Albuterol, administered as an aerosol in doses of 10 to 20 mg, reliably lowers
the serum potassium by an average of 0.5 mEq/L for 1 to 3 hours. The effect is additive with the effect of insulin. Albuterol also reduces the incidence and severity of
rebound hypoglycemia often seen after glucose and insulin therapy. Albuterol has
the advantage of requiring no IV access, and therefore can be started quickly. Side
effects of tremor and tachycardia may limit its use in some patients, especially those
with severe cardiovascular disease. Note that this is a substantially higher dose than
typically used for the initial treatment of asthma.
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate or SPSS (Kayexelate and others) is an ion-exchange
resin that is usually administered orally. It can also be given rectally as an enema, but
this is generally less effective and carries some risk of colonic injury. SPSS exchanges
sodium for potassium across the gut, so patients who are severely volume overloaded
may not tolerate this therapy. Onset of action takes several hours. This medication
is contraindicated in cases of ileus or suspected bowel obstruction or perforation. It
is more effective for maintenance therapy than for acute management.
If the patient is not completely anuric, diuresis is a remarkably effective way to
excrete large quantities of potassium. This will not be effective for the end-stage
kidney disease patient who has been on dialysis for years, but it is appropriate for
many patients with acute hyperkalemia due to dehydration, rhabdomyolysis, or
medication effects. Once intravascular volume is restored with crystalloid, loop
diuretics such as furosemide can be given to promote potassium excretion.
Dialysis is the ultimate treatment of choice for all kidney disease patients with
significant hyperkalemia. However, it is time-consuming and not always immediately available. Reliable vascular access and reasonably stable vital signs are prerequisites for hemodialysis, while the less-common peritoneal dialysis requires a
peritoneal catheter.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
52.1 A 55-year-old man presents in cardiac arrest. A dialysis fistula is present in the
right arm. In addition to standard ACLS therapies, which of the following is
most appropriate for this patient?
A. 25 g of 50% dextrose, IV push
B. Sodium bicarbonate, 50-mL IV push
C. Begin immediate hemodialysis
D. Calcium chloride, 20-mL slow intravenous push
52.2 A 45-year-old man is brought into the emergency center due to significant
dehydration and weakness. His potassium level is noted to be 7.2 mEq/L.
Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding his potassium
level?
A. Hyperkalemia can usually be diagnosed by symptoms alone.
B. An ECG showing peaked T waves means the patient is stable and treatment can safely wait until laboratory results are obtained.
C. Hyperkalemia can mimic a myocardial infarction on the ECG.
D. Hyperkalemia is synonymous with kidney disease.
52.3 Which of the following statements regarding treatment of hyperkalemia in
patients with some renal function is incorrect?
A. Administration of normal saline may hasten the excretion of potassium.
B. Administration of furosemide can hasten the excretion of potassium.
C. The combination of saline with a diuretic is often indicated because
hyperkalemic patients are frequently dehydrated.
D. Patients with some renal function do not need dialysis even for severe
hyperkalemia.
52.4 A patient with severe renal disease is found to have hyperkalemia, with tall,
peaked T waves on ECG. Vascular access cannot be readily obtained, but vital
signs are stable. Which of the following would be appropriate temporizing
measures?
A. Inhaled albuterol 2.5 mg in 3 mL saline
B. Oral sodium bicarbonate with rectal sodium polystyrene sulfonate
C. Inhaled albuterol 20 mg, with oral or rectal sodium polystyrene sulfonate,
30 g
D. Oral dextrose 25 g

524

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS
52.1 D. Calcium is the only agent with rapid and reliable enough onset to potentially help this patient. Bicarbonate might be appropriate, but its onset is
slower than calcium and its effect is more disputed. Dialysis requires a hemodynamically stable patient.
52.2 C. The ST-segment and T-wave changes of hyperkalemia may mimic the
ECG appearance of myocardial infarction. The nonspecific symptoms typical
of hyperkalemia are also often seen in patients with MI, particularly elderly
patients. Peaked T waves indicate that the heart is significantly affected by
hyperkalemia and the patient should not be considered stable. Many conditions and medications may cause hyperkalemia, not just renal failure.
52.3 D. Dialysis is definitive therapy for hyperkalemia. Patients who have some
residual kidney function can sometimes be managed without resorting to dialysis,
but it should always be available for those who fail to respond quickly.
52.4 C. High-dose inhaled albuterol (10-20 mg) can reliably lower serum potassium
with reasonable safety. SPSS can remove potassium through the GI tract, but
its effect is slow. Oral dextrose and oral bicarbonate have no role. Standard
doses of albuterol have too slight an effect on potassium levels.

CLINICAL PEARLS


In a patient with known or suspected renal failure, ECG changes consistent
with hyperkalemia should be treated immediately as a life-threatening
emergency. Do not await laboratory confirmation.



The ECG findings of hyperkalemia can progress very rapidly, and do not
reliably pass through all the stages of the “typical” textbook presentation.



Intravenous calcium is the antidote of choice for life-threatening arrhythmias related to hyperkalemia, but its effect is brief and additional agents
must be used.



Symptoms of renal failure and hyperkalemia are usually nonspecific, so
risk factors must be used to suspect the diagnosis.

• Treatment: Antibiotics, hydration, analgesia, antipyretics, exclusion of other
pathology.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical signs and symptoms of UTIs.
2. Understand the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs.
3. Understand the spectrum of UTIs and their variable treatment.

Considerations
Urinary tract infections are a spectrum of diseases that can affect any part of the
urinary system. They are second only to respiratory tract infections as a problem
encountered by physicians. Individuals who present to the ED with genitourinary
complaints often warrant a rapid but thorough history and physical examination.
This patient presentation (ie, dysuria, flank pain, nausea, and fever) is consistent
with acute pyelonephritis; an infection of the renal parenchyma. Generally, the
clinical features of acute pyelonephritis include fever, chills, dysuria, and flank
and costovertebral angle pain. Patients may feel nauseated and vomit. The initial
workup includes assessing the patient stability and immediately addressing any
life threats. As the workup proceeds, the patient should receive an antipyretic
(eg, acetaminophen), and intravenous fluids for hydration.
The differential diagnosis for patients with urinary complaints is broad and
includes cystitis, pyelonephritis, urethritis, and vaginitis. In addition, patients who
exhibit signs of systemic involvement (eg, fever) should be evaluated for other
pathologies including ectopic pregnancy, perforated viscous, infected kidney stone,
appendicitis, pancreatitis, colitis, and pneumonia. A good history and physical
examination will help the physician narrow down these possibilities.
Laboratory studies are helpful in confirming the diagnosis. A urinalysis typically
reveals leukocytes, red blood cells, and bacteria. A urine culture is essential to guide
antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures should be obtained if the patient has a fever. A
complete blood count, electrolytes, and renal function studies are also recommended.
Patients with suspected pyelonephritis typically do not require imaging studies. However, patients who clinically exhibit pyelonephritis, but whose urinalysis is negative,
and patients with a suspected urinary obstruction, should undergo imaging. In the
ED, this is usually an ultrasound or contrast-enhanced CT scan. Supportive care

consists of IV hydration, analgesia, antipyretics, and anti-emetics. In uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis, patients can receive a 10 to 14 day course of oral antibiotics (eg, fluoroquinolone) and be discharged home. In more severe cases, patients
should be admitted to the hospital and receive intravenous antibiotics.

APPROACH TO:
Urinary Tract Infections
DEFINITIONS
DYSURIA: Painful urination
CYSTITIS: Inflammation of the urinary bladder that generally results in dysuria,
urinary frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain.
ACUTE PYELONEPHRITIS: Inflammation of the kidney secondary to a UTI
of the renal parenchyma and collecting system. It typically presents as the clinical
syndrome of fever, chills, and flank pain.
BACTERIURIA: Presence of bacteria in the urine
HEMATURIA: Blood in the urine, may be micro- or macroscopic.
PYURIA: Pus in the urine
UNCOMPLICATED UTI: An infection of a structurally and functionally normal
urinary tract that is generally eradicated by a 3- to 5-day course of antibiotics.
COMPLICATED UTI: An infection in patients with underlying immunological,
structural, or neurological disease that diminish the efficacy of standard antimicrobial therapy.
URETHRITIS: Inflammation of the urethra

CLINICAL APPROACH
UTIs are a common diagnosis in the ED. They can range from simple cystitis to
pyelonephritis resulting in sepsis and shock. Urinary tract infections affect women
more commonly than men. However, in children, boys are affected more commonly until 1 year of age. Urinary tract infections in children warrant further
sonographic evaluation of the urinary tract to rule out congenital anomalies. The
lifetime prevalence of UTIs is estimated to be 14,000 per 100,000 men and 53,000
per 100,000 women.
UTIs can be divided into lower tract (urethra and bladder) and upper tract
(ureters and kidneys) infections. The symptoms of lower infections are localized
and are commonly crampy suprapubic pain, dysuria, foul-smelling or dark-colored
urine, hematuria, urinary frequency and urgency. Patients with upper tract infections usually appear more ill and are more likely to have abnormal vital signs and
systemic symptoms (eg, fever, chills, nausea and vomiting). It is important to distinguish lower- from upper-tract infections as the treatments differ vastly, as will be
discussed later.

530

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Commonly, the infecting organism gains access to the urinary tract by direct entry
from the urethra. The human body evolved many defenses against UTIs including
frequent urinary flow, urine urea concentration and acidification, and urethral epithelial lining. The normal periurethral flora includes the bacteria lactobacillus that
provides a symbiotic protective mechanism. The perirectal area and the vagina are
both potential sites of bacterial colonization and are in much closer proximity to the
urethral meatus in women. The female urethra is also much shorter than in males
and brings the urethral meatus in closer proximity to the bladder, thus increasing
the risk of infection by external organisms. A UTI in a man is usually the result of
benign prostatic hypertrophy, kidney stones that become infected, urethral instrumentation (surgery or catheterization), or immunocompromised states.
Care should be taken to exclude other etiologies in patients who present with
urinary complaints. Cervicitis, vulvovaginitis and pelvic inflammatory disease are
important conditions to exclude in women and are more likely to present with
discharge, lack of bacteria on urinalysis, and lack of urinary frequency and urgency.
In considering these diagnoses, the patient should undergo a pelvic examination.
Sampling with DNA probes for gonococcus and Chlamydia should be obtained, a
wet mount slide examination performed, and treatment for these conditions
considered. Pregnancy should also be considered and tested for in all women
of reproductive age with any urinary symptoms. In men, urethritis and prostatitis
should be excluded before the diagnosis of cystitis or pyelonephritis is confirmed.
UTIs are typically caused by a single bacterial species. Eighty percent of
infections are caused by Escherichia coli, a gram-negative rod. Staphylococcus
saprophyticus is the second most common cause of UTI and is common in young
women. Other organisms include Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterococci, and Pseudomonas.
The identification of an exact organism is rarely indicated in the ED. The “gold
standard” of quantitative culture takes several days, but will significantly assist in
treatment if the patient is being admitted to the hospital or failed outpatient therapy.
Major risk factors for women aged 16 to 35 years include sexual intercourse, pregnancy, bladder catheterization, and diaphragm usage. Later in life, additional risk
factors include gynecologic surgery and bladder prolapse. In both sexes, conditions
resulting in urinary stasis increase with age, as does the incidence of UTIs. Benign
prostatic hypertrophy is a major risk factor in older men.

Laboratory Studies
The mainstay in the diagnosis of a UTI is urinalysis and culture. Collection of
sterile urine is critical because a contaminated specimen can result in a false-positive
urinalysis. Suprapubic aspiration and catheterization provides the best sample; however, both are invasive and uncomfortable to the patient. Clean catch urine samples,
obtained by the patient collecting urine in midstream is standard and provides an
adequate sample if done properly. In children, “bag” urine collection, by placing a
bag over the perineum, should be avoided due to the high rates of contamination.
Condom catheterization collection of urine is not acceptable for urinalysis due to
the contact of the male glands to the collection vessel. Typically, contaminated
urine will exhibit cellular elements (eg, epithelial cells) and should not be used to
determine the presence of a UTI.

Urinalysis can include urine dipstick testing, urine microscopy, and urine culture
with sensitivities. Table 53–1 lists the sensitivity and specificity of different components of the urinalysis.

Urine dipstick It tests urine for infection by measuring two speciﬁc entities:
leukocyte esterase, a compound released by white blood cell breakdown in the urinary
tract, and nitrite, a compound produced by the reduction of dietary nitrates by some
gram-negative bacteria (eg, E coli).
Urine microscopy It examines the urine for white blood cells, bacteria, and other
visible structures. Classically, the criteria for diagnosis of UTI on microscopy include
the presence of more than ﬁve leukocytes or red blood cells per high-powered ﬁeld
or 2+ bacteria. Microscopic criteria are highly debated and the presence of WBCs,
RBCs, and bacteria should be used in conjunction with clinical presentation to conﬁrm the diagnosis of a UTI.
Urine culture Diagnosis and treatment of a UTI based on the UA result is presumptive as the true diagnosis requires a culture with greater than (10 × 5)/mL
colony count. ED urine cultures should be sent on high-risk populations including
infants and children. Cultures are also obtained in the elderly, adult men, pregnant
women, individuals with comorbid illness, or failing initial antimicrobial therapy.
Gram staining of the urine can also be helpful, but is not routinely indicated.
Imaging
The majority of patients with urinary complaints do not require imaging in the ED.
However, in certain clinical settings it is indicated. Patients who exhibit clinical
signs or symptoms of a urinary infection, but have a negative urinalysis, those with
a suspected urogenital obstruction, and complicated UTIs often require imaging
studies. In addition, first episodes of UTIs in girls younger than 4 years and men,
should undergo an imaging study.
Imaging of the urinary tract consists of ultrasound, computed tomography (CT)
scans, intravenous pyelography (IVP), and radionucleotide scans. Ultrasound testing is an acceptable initial study in the ED because it is quick, noninvasive, and
can detect many abnormalities including perinephric abscess, hydroureter, urinary
tract stone, pyelonephritis, and congenital anomalies. CT scans are more sensitive at detecting these abnormalities, but expose the patient to higher levels of

532

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

radiation and often require the administration of IV contrast. The use of IVP
and radionucleotide scans are generally not performed during ED evaluation and
reserved for inpatient or outpatient workups.

Treatment
The correct choice of antibiotic can be a difficult one for the emergency physician.
There are many factors that affect this decision including patient drug allergies, bacterial
susceptibility, community versus hospital flora, local antibiotic resistance rates, the
presence of medical comorbidities, as well as the patient ability to pay for the prescription. Table 53–2 lists the most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of UTIs.
Uncomplicated cystitis patients are treated as outpatients. Antibiotic choices
must be effective against E coli and include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMPSMX), amoxicillin/clavulanate, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.
Typically, patients are treated for 3 to 5 days. Longer therapy generally offers no
benefit. However, in patients with suspected subclinical upper-tract infection, communities with high resistance rates, extremes of age, and comorbidities, a longer
course (ie, 7-10 days) is recommended. For symptomatic relief, physicians often prescribe phenazopyridine, a drug that concentrates in the urine and often relieves the
pain and irritation of urination. The drug causes a distinct color change in the urine;
typically to a dark orange to reddish color. Phenazopyridine is contraindicated in
patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because it can lead to
drug-induced hemolysis of red blood cells.
Uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be treated as an outpatient, provided the
patient can tolerate oral medications, has mild symptoms, gets good follow-up, and
is not pregnant. TMP-SMX, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or a fluoroquinolone antibiotic
should be prescribed for 10 to 14 days. All pregnant patients with pyelonephritis
require admission (see Table 53-3).
Complicated pyelonephritis requires admission and IV antibiotics. The antibiotic choices are TMP-SMX, ceftriaxone, gentamycin (with or without ampicillin),
and fluoroquinolones. In more severe cases where urovsepsis or a resistant organism
is suspected, cefepime, ampicillin plus tobramycin, piperacillintazobactam may be
indicated.

All children and men who are discharged with the diagnosis of UTI require
urological follow-up to assess for underlying anatomical abnormalities. Adults with
complicated UTIs also need follow-up and evaluation of the genitourinary system.
Pregnant patients require special attention. Simple, asymptomatic bacteriuria
necessitates treatment due to the increased risk of preterm labor, perinatal
mortality, and maternal pyelonephritis. It is important that the bacteriuria is eliminated despite the patient being clinically asymptomatic. First-line agents include
penicillins (eg, amoxicillin, ampicillin), and cephalosporins. Fluoroquinolones and
tetracyclines are contraindicated as they are known teratogens. Admission should
be considered in patients in their third trimester, suspected pyelonephritis, or those
who cannot tolerate fluids by mouth.
Some patients require chronic placement of indwelling catheters, which serve
as a nidus for infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in these patients
is not indicated because frequent antibiotic administration results in increased
microorganism resistance. Generally, removal of the catheter results in elimination
of bacteria. Symptomatic patients, who cannot be without the catheter, should be
treated with antibiotics, have the catheter replaced, and be considered for admission
to the hospital due to the high risk for systemic infection.

534

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

53.2 A 34-year-old woman complains of mild crampy suprapubic abdominal pain,
dysuria, and urinary frequency for the last 3 days. She has no fever. Her blood
pressure is 125/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate is
16 breaths per minute, and temperature is 36.8°C (98.3°F). She has no significant past medical history and is able to drink oral fluids with difficulty. She has
a clean-catch urinalysis that reveals 2+ leukocyte esterase, 1+ nitrite, 1+ blood,
and 2+ bacteria. Her β-hCG is negative. Which of the following organisms is
most likely responsible for her presentation?
A. Klebsiella spp
B. Escherichia coli
C. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
D. Proteus mirabilis
E. Enterobacter spp
53.3 A 24-year-old woman presents to the ED for painful urination over the last
2 days that is associated with urinary urgency. She states that she is pregnant and
the fetus is at 12-week gestational age as measured by ultrasound. On examination, she is well appearing, and sitting comfortably in bed. Her blood pressure is
115/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 81 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 16 breaths
per minute, and temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F). A urinalysis reveals 5 WBC/
mm3, 1+ leukocyte esterase, and 1+ bacteria. The urine is negative for nitrite
and blood. As you return to the patient bed to tell her the results, she states
that her pain has resolved, she is urinating without difficulty, and wants to go
home. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of management?
A. Admit the patient for intravenous antibiotics.
B. Discharge the patient with a prescription for antibiotics and tell her to fill
the prescription only if the culture results are positive.
C. Ask the patient to undergo another examination to evaluate for gonorrhea and Chlamydia.

53.5 Which of the following patients with pyelonephritis can be safely discharged
home with close follow-up?
A. A 23-year-old woman in her second trimester of pregnancy.
B. A 13-year-old woman who cannot tolerate her diet despite anti-emetics.
C. An 88-year-old man with urinary retention and dehydration.
D. A 67-year-old woman with 3+ bacteria, a sulfa allergy, and a history of
lupus.
E. A 44-year-old woman with a kidney stone and hydroureter on CT scan.

ANSWERS
53.1 D. This woman may indeed have a urinary tract infection; however, her vital
signs are unstable. The mainstay of treatment in emergency medicine is to first
address the patient airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). This patient
is hypotensive (eg, BP 83/38 mm Hg). The first step in her management is
placing an IV line and administering fluids. She should also be placed on a
cardiac monitor to monitor her blood pressure, heart rate, and rhythm. Once
her ABCs are addressed, laboratory studies should be obtained, including a
urinalysis and culture. She should also receive broad-spectrum antibiotics and
an antipyretic. This patient may need a lumbar puncture, but not until her
ABCs are addressed. This patient requires admission to the hospital.
53.2 B. E coli is the infecting organism in more than 80% of all UTIs. All of the
other choices cause urinary tract infections, but are less common. S saprophyticus is a common organism in young, sexually active women. In hospitalized or
nursing home patients, Pseudomonas spp and Staphylococcus spp are frequent
pathogens. Lactobacilli are normal urethral flora and are not considered a
causative organism. Complicated UTIs are more likely to be caused by other
organisms.
53.3 E. The patient is pregnant and has evidence of a urinary tract infection on the
urinalysis. Pregnant patients are at high risk for preterm labor and perinatal
mortality if a urinary infection goes untreated. Therefore, this patient should
receive a 5 to 7 days course of nitrofurantoin or a penicillin-based antibiotic
and follow-up with her obstetrician. The patient does not need to be admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics. This would likely be the case
if she were diagnosed with pyelonephritis. The patient should not wait for
culture results and delay receiving her antibiotics. It is important to eradicate
the bacteriuria as quickly as possible. This patient does not report the symptoms of gonorrhea or Chlamydia (eg, vaginal discharge) at this time, and does
not require further evaluation for these conditions. Fluoroquinolones (eg,
ciprofloxacin) are contraindicated in pregnant patients due to the risk of fetal
abnormalities (eg, tendon maldevelopment).

536

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

53.4 D. Men with urinary tract infections automatically fit into the “complicated”
variety of UTIs. Therefore, the most appropriate therapy is ciprofloxacin for
14 days. With the exception of amoxicillin as monotherapy, all of the above
choices are appropriate for treatment of certain types of UTIs. Complicated
UTIs mandate 14 days of therapy with an appropriate antibiotic. The emergency physician should also consider sending urine cultures on this patient
and provide good follow-up. Patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy or
other lower urinary tract obstructions may be discharged with a Foley catheter
if they have good follow-up, understand how to manage their catheter, and
have to significant medical comorbidities.
53.5 D. Despite a chronic medical condition, this patient may be safely discharged
home. Because this patient has a sulfa allergy, TMP-SMX should not be
administered. Other treatment options include quinolones, amoxicillin/
clavulanate, and nitrofurantoin. All of the other patients should be admitted
for treatment. All pregnant patients with pyelonephritis require admission.
The 13-year-old and 88-year-old are not tolerating their diet and require
intravenous hydration. The 44-year-old has a urinary obstruction with a UTI,
which makes it a complicated UTI. These patients are at high risk for developing sepsis. For most admitted patients, urine cultures should be sent to guide
antibiotic therapy.

CLINICAL PEARLS


All urinary tract infections in men are considered complicated.



The definitive diagnosis of a UTI is made on urine culture from a noncontaminated urine sample.



Care should be taken to exclude other etiologies, such as cervicitis,
vulvovaginitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease, in female patients
who present with urinary complaints.



All pregnant patients with bacteriuria require antibiotic treatment to
prevent complications.



Patients with a UTI and an obstructed kidney stone are at high risk for
morbidity and require urgent urologic consultation.



Antibiotic therapy should be tailored to the type of UTI, the community
resistance rates, and the patient ability to tolerate the medications.

ANSWERS TO CASE 54:
Airway Management/Respiratory Failure
Summary: This patient is an elderly male with a depressed level of consciousness,
hypoxia, respiratory distress and pooling secretions. He is not oxygenating well or
protecting his airway from aspiration.
• First step: This patient needs immediate airway management and endotracheal
intubation.
• Additional factors: As a critically ill patient from a nursing facility, it is important to attempt to verify his code status before intubating. It is also important
to consider the underlying causes for his altered mental status and respiratory
distress.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn how to evaluate the airway and indications for intervention.
2. Become more familiar with emergency airway procedures.
3. Understanding of the rationale for and the steps involved with rapid sequence
intubation.
4. Recognize and anticipate the potentially difficult airway and special circumstances.

Considerations
In the case above, the patient has several concerning findings indicating he will
need active airway management. He is hypoxic, tachypneic, and with his altered
mental status he may not able to protect his airway from secretions or emesis.
Because of his depressed level of consciousness and inability to protect his airway he
is not an appropriate candidate for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (such
as BiPAP).
He likely has a pneumonia and/or aspiration event, but it is also important to
consider that he may have had a separate preceding event such as a cerebral vascular accident or medication overdose which created the altered mental status before
aspirating. His other vital signs indicate that he is probably septic and will need to
be resuscitated after his airway is addressed.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

541

APPROACH TO:
Airway Management
CLINICAL APPROACH
Evaluation
Assessing a patient airway and breathing are critical first steps in evaluating any
patient in the emergency department. Begin by grossly observing the appearance
of the patient paying particular attention to key markers of oxygenation and
ventilation: skin color looking for the presence of cyanosis, evidence of severe
bronchospasm such as intercostal retractions, difficulty speaking, low or falling
oxygen saturation, increased or decreased respiratory rate. Evaluation of the airway
includes not just the actual structures of the head and neck but also the patient
mental status and amount of secretions or blood present in the airway.
Indications for active airway intervention:
Respiratory Failure: persistent and or worsening hypoxia, severe hypercarbia/respiratory
acidosis.
Airway Protection: absent gag, depressed level of consciousness, excess secretions.
Impending or existing airway obstruction: mass, infection, angioedema, foreign matter or excess secretions, etc.
Facilitation of further studies or to protect the airway during transport when
deterioration may be anticipated.

Airway Protection There are several signs of an inadequately protected airway
which indicate need for intubation: pooling secretions (eg, gurgling sounds with
respiration), an absent or weak cough reﬂex and depressed mental status often correlating with GCS of 8 or less. In general, a patient whose level of consciousness is
depressed enough to tolerate insertion of an oropharyngeal airway is not protecting
his or her airway and requires airway protection.
Reversible and or transient causes of a decreased level of consciousness must be
considered prior to active airway intervention. Treating hypoglycemia or suspected
opiate overdose before intubating can save the patient a major intervention. Additionally, providers should consider that the patient may be postictal because they
may improve rapidly to a point where they can protect their airway.
Respiratory Failure Respiratory failure refers to either failure to oxygenate or
failure to ventilate. Failure to oxygenate is reﬂected by hypoxia despite maximum
supplemental oxygen administration. Failure to ventilate, indicated by elevated
levels of carbon dioxide (measured on blood gas or capnography) can be equally lifethreatening and requires intervention. Hypercapnea may manifest as somnolence,
agitation or otherwise altered mental status.
In select patients who are awake and alert, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) may be an option to delay or prevent intubation in the setting of
hypoxic or hypercapneic respiratory failure.

542

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Anticipated Clinical Deterioration There are several clinical scenarios in which
awake patients without current respiratory failure may still require intubation. The
emergency physician needs to anticipate the potential clinical course of a patient
and may wish to “intubate early” to avoid less controlled intubation conditions later.
Situations in which this may be considered include worsening airway obstruction
such as in patients with anaphylaxis, angioedema, severe burns or smoke inhalation, penetrating neck trauma with an expanding neck hematoma, epiglottitis or
deep space neck infections. Clinical scenarios that require the transfer of critically
ill patients to a higher level of care requires a great deal of caution. If deterioration
of the mental or respiratory status is anticipated it may be prudent to proceed with
intubation prior to transfer.
Facilitation of Medical Evaluation Occasionally patients require intubation
to safely complete necessary studies or procedures. One such scenario is that of
a trauma patient who may be agitated or combative. These patients often require
emergent CT imaging as part of their initial workup. If they require sedation to
facilitate adequate imaging or procedures, intubation may be required for airway
protection. Often these patients can be promptly extubated after completion if they
are without respiratory issues.
Interventions Airway management is much more than just intubation. It can be
as simple as providing supplemental oxygen or repositioning the patient. Knowledge
of minimally invasive maneuvers and devices is critical and can be lifesaving.
Supplemental Oxygen Supplemental oxygen can be delivered (in order of increasing delivery) via nasal cannula, face mask, non-rebreather mask and high-flow
nasal cannula. These are appropriate first steps for patients that are hypoxic but are
otherwise protecting their airway. Supplemental oxygen is appropriate to treat hypoxemia and is indicated as part of one preparation for intubation should it become
necessary.
Airway Positioning Positioning of patient with a depressed level of consciousness
or with significant somnolence can be very important. The most common cause of
airway obstruction in the semiconscious or unconscious patient is loss of muscle
tone, causing the tongue and soft tissue to occlude the airway. The simplest corrective maneuver is the chin lift (see Sec I, Emergency Assessment and Management),
opening the airway through neck hyperextension. This maneuver is contraindicated
in patients with a suspected cervical spine injury. A jaw thrust (see Figure I–2) can
also be performed by placing two or three fingers behind the angle of the mandible
and lifting anteriorly. Since neck manipulation is not required, this maneuver can
be safely performed in the context of cervical spine injury.
Other obstructive processes such as mediastinal masses, very large tonsils or morbid obesity may also require an upright position. A patient in respiratory failure
from pulmonary edema will likely not tolerate laying flat and it is important to allow
them to be upright.

Airway Adjuncts In addition to airway repositioning, placement of an oropharyngeal (OPA) and or nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) is required and may be highly
effective. An OPA is designed to keep the tongue from obstructing the posterior
pharynx. This device is only used in unconscious patients who do not have a cough
or a gag reﬂex. Using an appropriately sized OPA is important: a device which is
too small will be ineffective while an overly large OPA can worsen obstruction. It
is particularly important to have an OPA in place when giving positive pressure
ventilations (PPV) through a bag valve mask. Otherwise, external pressure on the
patient chin may force the tongue into an obstructive position.
In the semiconscious patient with an intact gag reflex, insertion of an OPA can
induce vomiting and possible aspiration. An NPA is the more appropriate adjunct
for the semiconscious patient as it rarely induces gagging. The NPA functions by
helping bypass tongue obstruction. It is contraindicated in patients with severe
facial trauma due to the risk of brain intrusion.
Suctioning along the sides of the mouth is also important in patients with pooling secretions. The suction device should not be inserted deep into the oropharynx
where it is likely to induce gagging and emesis.
Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation Noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation (NIPPV) is often used in the emergency department. NIPPV is the
use of mechanical ventilatory support without an invasive airway in place such
as an endotracheal tube. A tightly secured mask is the most common method used
to deliver NIPPV. There are several varieties of masks and ventilatory modes used
to deliver NIPPV. The two most commonly seen in the emergency department are
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure
(BiPAP). In the appropriately selected patient its use may prevent the need for intubation. Current evidence suggests the patients most likely to respond to NIPPV
have conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiogenic
pulmonary edema. Other clinical indications include severe respiratory acidosis,
hypoxia, dyspnea, tachypnea and increased work of breathing.
Absolute contraindications to NIPPV include coma, cardiac arrest, respiratory
arrest and any condition warranting immediate intubation. Relative contraindications include evidence of airway obstruction, cardiac instability (shock requiring
pressors, ventricular dysrhythmias), GI bleeding, inability to protect airway, and
status epilepticus.
Intubation As discussed above, the indications for endotracheal intubation may
be straight forward and objective or subtle and vague. The need is obvious when
there is clear failure to oxygenate or ventilate using less invasive means. Decision
making is far more difﬁcult when the clinical indications are less extreme.
Crash intubations are indicated in pulseless, and apneic patients, often without
the use of preoxygenation or medications. Urgent intubations refer to patients
needing intubation within minutes rather than seconds and do allow for the use
of preoxygenation and induction medication. Stable patients who are likely to
require active airway protection allow for a trial of alternative treatments and
careful preparation.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

RAPID SEQUENCE INTUBATION
What Is It?
Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is a method that attempts to simultaneously sedate
and paralyze a patient while creating optimum intubating conditions. The major
goal is to leave the airway unprotected for the shortest time possible. The procedure
assumes that the patient may have a full stomach and is at great risk of vomiting
and aspiration. Rapid sequence intubation is one of the most important skills for the
emergency physician and requires careful but quick preparation.

What Are the Steps of Rapid Sequence Intubation?
Once it has been determined a patient needs endotracheal intubation, if time allows,
there are several key steps to follow. These are widely known as the “seven Ps” and
are presented in temporal sequence below.

Step 1: Preparation:
Assess the Patient Is the patient a good candidate for RSI? Remember, the
patient will be paralyzed and the physician is taking complete control over the
airway. The question should always be asked how likely is the intubation to be
successful? Can the patient be ventilated with a bag-valve-mask (BVM) if RSI
should fail? Does the patient have dentures that need to be removed? Does the
patient have signs of upper airway obstruction, such as drooling or stridor, due to
edema, trauma, or mass? Is there any restriction of neck mobility? Heavy facial
hair, a short thick neck, a recessed chin, or a large tongue should all be considered
as potential impediments to bag-valve-mask ventilation or oral tracheal intubation. Examine the neck for surgical scars. A scar from a prior cricothyroidotomy
is a concerning sign. Severe kyphosis or cervical spine immobilization will make
intubation more difficult.
There are a few rules of airway evaluation that may be helpful in alert and
cooperative patients. The first is the 3-3-2 rule. The patient should be able to insert
at least 3 fingers into his/her mouth in the vertical orientation, between the upper
and lower front teeth; the hyomental distance (from the hyoid cartilage to the chin)
should be at least 3 fingers breadth; and there should be at least 2 fingers breadth
between the floor of the mouth and the thyroid cartilage. The Mallampati score is
another means of predicting intubation difficulty. The patient is asked to stick out
his/her tongue while opening the mouth wide as possible. The amount of posterior
pharynx visible is divided into four classes. The best view is referred to as “class one”
including full visibility of the tonsils, uvula, and soft palate. The more limited classthree and class-four views may be associated with difficult intubations.
Concerns that the patient is not a good candidate for RSI should prompt immediate consultation with an anesthesiologist. A surgeon should also be emergently
consulted if a cricothyroidotomy is likely.
Prepare Materials It is essential that all equipment is available and working before
embarking on this procedure. Necessary pre-intubation equipment includes oral and
nasal pharyngeal airways, suction, oxygen, and a bag valve mask. Basic intubation
equipment includes a laryngoscope handle and several blades. The most commonly

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

used laryngoscope blades are the curved Macintosh blade and the straight Miller
blade. They should be tested for adequate light function before use.
Endotracheal tubes (ETT) of various sizes and stylets must also be ready for use.
The ETT has a distal balloon that should be inflated and deflated before use to test
for leaks. The ETT should be preloaded with an internal stylet and is typically bent
in the shape of a hockey stick to allow it to pass more anteriorly. Several other ETTs,
at least a 1/2 size larger and smaller, should also be available. The formula used to
predict endotracheal tube size for children ages two and older: (age in years + 16)/4.
Airway “rescue” devices should be available and familiar to the provider to be
used in difficult intubation scenarios. These devices include bougies, a video laryngoscope and several sizes of laryngeal mask airways (LMA). Cricothyroidotomy
materials should always be nearby.
The medications selected for induction and paralysis should be drawn up and
ready. The patient should be attached to a cardiac monitor with frequently cycling
blood pressure, a pulse oximeter, and an end-tidal CO2 monitor. Importantly, the
patient must have a freely flowing IV. These steps are summarized by the mnemonic
SOAP ME IV (Table 54–1).

Step 2: Preoxygenation Preoxygenation is a key part of RSI and should be started
when one is even considering the need for active airway management. The purpose of preoxygenation is to allow for a greater reservoir of oxygen in the lungs via
nitrogen washout. Three to ﬁve minutes of high-ﬂow O2 is adequate and allows
for a substantial apneic period without oxygen desaturation in otherwise healthy
patients (see Figure 54–1). Pre-oxygenating with high-ﬂow oxygen requires that the
patient is breathing. If the patient is apneic, studies have shown that 8 full-volume
BVM ventilations over 1 minute are equivalent. Yet bag-valve-mask ventilation
of the spontaneously breathing patient is contraindicated because it unnecessarily
increases the risk of gastric distension and aspiration.
Step 3: Pretreatment Pretreatment is a controversial topic that deserves brief
mention. Manipulation of the airway causes a transient increase in intracranial
pressure (ICP). In patients who may already have increased ICP (eg, in intracerebral hemorrhage), any further increase could be potentially devastating. Several
medications may be used in sequence in attempt to diminish the effect of airway
manipulation on intracranial pressure. Starting a few minutes before induction,
fentanyl (3-5 μg/kg) followed by lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg), and a defasciculating dose
of the paralytic agent (1/10th the treatment dose) may be given. However, there are

conﬂicting data regarding the potential beneﬁt with the use of these medications. In
addition, pretreatment may lead to other complications and a delay in intubation.

Step 4: Induction and Paralysis Induction involves administering a medication
that will quickly and reliably sedate the patient prior to paralysis. Ideally, the sedative agent will have little effect on heart rate or blood pressure or cause other adverse side effects.
The induction agent most commonly used in emergency medicine is etomidate
(0.3 mg/kg) as it meets these criteria well. It is rapidly sedating and hemodynamically neutral. It is also thought to be cerebroprotective. A potential downside of
etomidate is that it causes transient adrenal suppression. Although the clinical significance of this effect is uncertain, some physicians avoid etomidate when intubating septic patients.
Ketamine is another drug that may be used for induction, ideally suited for
patients in status asthmaticus, anaphylactic shock, and sepsis. Ketamine is a derivative of PCP and acts as a dissociative agent. It has rapid onset of action (1.5 mg/kg
IV) and causes increases in blood pressure and heart rate through catecholamine
release. It is unique in that it leaves airway reflexes protected and does not induce
apnea. Additionally, it has bronchodilatory and analgesic properties. It should be
used with caution in patients with known coronary artery disease.
Propofol and thiopental are other fast-acting sedative agents of short duration,
but less commonly used in RSI due to associated hypotension.

Paralysis Paralytic drugs come in two basic types—depolarizing and nondepolarizing, describing their action at the neuromuscular junction. The only depolarizing
agent in common clinical use is succinylcholine which has the most rapid onset and
shortest duration of all paralytics. It is an analogue of acetylcholine and acts by transiently binding to ACh receptors, keeping ion channels open, leading to paralysis.
Succinylcholine action at the motor endplate causes potassium efflux, and therefore
should be avoided in patients with hyperkalemia. Succinylcholine and its effects on
extracellular potassium levels may be pronounced and should be avoided in patients
with recent or ongoing neuromuscular disorders, subacute burns, severe debilitation,
crush injuries, or rhabdomyolysis. Acute head injury, acute burns, and acute strokes
are not contraindications to the use of succinylcholine.
Nondepolarizing agents act by competitive inhibition of the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor, thereby preventing depolarization and causing paralysis. The
agents most commonly used are rocuronium and vecuronium. Rocuronium is preferred for RSI among the nondepolarizing agents as it has the most rapid onset and
shortest duration.

Step 5: Positioning and Protection Patient positioning for RSI is an
extremely important but often overlooked step in the emergency department. The
proper head position in adults is the “snifﬁng” position, with the base of the neck
ﬂexed forward and the head hyperextended. When done properly, the patient
ear should be at the level of the sternum. This position greatly enhances the
view of the vocal cords from the mouth. Prior to administration of medications,
the patient head should be positioned at the very end of the bed, and the bed
height should be adequate for the operator. Once induction agents are given, ﬁrm
downward pressure to the cricoid cartilage (known as the Sellick maneuver) is
often done to prevent gastric distention and possible aspiration. However, recent
studies have suggested that this may not be necessary and can worsen the view
of the operator.
Step 6: Placement with Proof Once the patient is paralyzed and positioned, the
ETT should be placed without delay. The ﬁrst step is to open the patient mouth and
insert the laryngoscope blade along the right side deep into the posterior oropharynx,
then move to the center sweeping the tongue out of the way while lifting up and
out. This usually provides a view of the vocal cords. The ETT is advanced until the
balloon is just beyond the vocal cords, then the operator must stop, inﬂate the
balloon, and remove the stylet.
The next step is to confirm that the endotracheal tube is in the right place. The
absolute best way to do this is to watch it pass through the cords. Other confirmatory measures (end-tidal CO2 change, fogging of the tube, and listening for breath
sounds) should always be performed. However, these are nonspecific signs and can
all be misleading in various circumstances.
Step 7: Postintubation Management Once placed and conﬁrmed, the endotracheal tube must be secured. A chest x-ray is obtained to assess appropriate depth of
the ETT. The chest x-ray is not useful for differentiating tracheal from esophageal
intubation. Next, orders should be given for a longer acting sedative agent as well as
analgesia. Finally, ventilator settings should be established which include the mode,
respiratory rate, Fio2, tidal volume, and peak-end expiratory pressure. The 7 Ps for
RSI are summarized in Table 54–4.

D. Watching the ETT pass through the vocal cords
54.2 Which of the following is a contraindication to succinylcholine?
A. Acute burns
B. Acute renal failure
C. History of coronary artery disease
D. Sepsis
54.3 A 20-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being stung by
a bee. His skin is red and covered with welts. He has obvious swelling of his lips
and tongue, but no wheezes. After treatment with appropriate medications, he
complains of throat swelling and his voice is hoarse. He has stridorous inspirations but a normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. What is the most
appropriate management of this patient airway?
A. Continued observation as long as oxygen saturation remains normal
B. Call anesthesia and prepare for RSI.
C. Begin high-dose nebulized albuterol and continue to observe.
D. Prepare for cricothyroidotomy.
54.4 You are the first person on scene to a code blue in your hospital. You arrive
to find an elderly woman who is unconscious, has a weak pulse and does not
appear to be breathing. Your first steps are
A. Wait for the code cart to arrive and then intubate the patient.
B. Begin chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
C. Attempt to remove any foreign body from the mouth and reposition the
airway with chin lift or jaw thrust.
D. Begin bagging the patient immediately.

ANSWERS
54.1 D. Watching the ETT pass through the vocal cords is the best way to assure
proper placement. CXR has no role in differentiating between endotracheal
and esophageal intubation. The other choices are helpful but not failsafe.

550

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

54.2 B. Succinylcholine transiently increases serum potassium levels. It is presumptively contraindicated in renal failure patients who often have elevated potassium levels. Acute burns are not a contraindication. Beginning 2 to 3 days
after a burn, acetylcholine receptor upregulation can lead to hyperkalemia.
Neither coronary artery disease nor sepsis is a contraindication to the use of
succinylcholine.
54.3 B. This patient displays signs of impending airway obstruction. His worsening airway edema, despite appropriate medical therapy, dictates intubation
before complete airway occlusion and a cricothyroidotomy is required. There
is no wheezing to suggest bronchoconstriction that could be treated with a
bronchodilator such as albuterol. Stridor is a worrisome sign of upper airway
obstruction. Normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation should not delay
intubation as falling oxygen saturation is a late sign of respiratory failure.
Cricothyroidotomy is only indicated after all other measures have failed.
54.4 C. The most common cause of airway obstruction is the tongue and/or soft
tissues of the upper airway. No other adjuncts may be necessary for initial
management except relieving the obstruction with airway repositioning. This
should certainly be the first step, and there is no need to wait for the code cart
before performing this maneuver. There is no indication for chest compressions in a patient with palpable pulses. The patient will require BVM ventilation after airway repositioning and placement of an oral airway. If the patient is
easy to ventilate, reversible causes of respiratory depression, such as a narcotic
overdose, should be investigated and may eliminate the need for RSI.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Remember the noninvasive maneuvers and interventions that may
eliminate the need for intubation: nasopharyngeal airways, chin lift,
suction, BiPAP.



Always have suction available.



Bag-valve-mask ventilation is a lifesaving intervention for almost all
patients with respiratory failure—know how to do it!



Use an oral airway when bagging a patient.



Head position is key for both basic and advanced airway management.



Take time to thoroughly prepare for RSI. Poor preparation should never
be the reason for a failed airway.



Call anesthesia and/or surgery early if a difficult airway is anticipated.



Always anticipate the difficult airway and have back-up airway devices
immediately available.

CASE 55
A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department (ED) with anxiety,
insomnia, and nausea. He denies having any hallucinations or seizures. He states
that he had been drinking about a half bottle of hard liquor each day for years. After
his wife threatened to divorce him and he was fired as a result of his alcoholism,
he decided to stop drinking “cold turkey.” His last alcohol intake was two days
ago. He has a history of hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide. He
does not smoke or use illicit drugs.
On examination, his temperature is (100.4οF), blood pressure is 175/95, heart
rate is 120 beats per minute, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute. He
is tremulous and diaphoretic. He appears mildly dehydrated with dry mucous
membranes. The lungs are clear to auscultation, and the heart sounds are regular
although tachycardic. He is alert and oriented, and he does not have any focal
neurologic deficits except for bilateral distal sensory loss in the hands and feet
(in a stocking-glove distribution).

ANSWERS TO CASE 55:
Ethanol Withdrawal
Summary: This is a 50-year-old man with acute alcohol withdrawal as evidenced by
his anxiety, tremor, and signs of autonomic hyperactivity (hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis). However, he does not currently exhibit
the more serious signs of alcohol withdrawal, such as seizure, hallucinations, or
delirium.
• Potential complications: seizures, hallucinations (auditory, visual, or tactile),
delirium (delirium tremens or DTs).
• Treatment: Intravenous (IV) fluids, repletion of electrolytes as needed,
benzodiazepines to control symptoms and prevent more serious manifestations
of withdrawal (listed above).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical signs and symptoms of ethanol withdrawal (including
seizures, hallucinations, and delirium).
2. Understand the evaluation and treatment of patients with ethanol withdrawal.

Considerations
Because ethanol abuse is prevalent in the community, emergency physicians need
to be prepared to treat those who present with alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms may
range from mild anxiety, nausea or vomiting, insomnia, and tremor to hallucinations, seizures, and delirium. Mild cases of withdrawal may be treated with oral
benzodiazepines; however, patients with more serious symptomatology may require
large doses of IV benzodiazepines, IV hydration, repletion of electrolytes, and
hospital admission.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

555

APPROACH TO:
Ethanol Withdrawal
CLINICAL APPROACH
Among patients presenting to the ED for any complaint, the prevalence of alcoholism or inappropriate drinking is estimated to be between 8% to 40%. Some patients
arrive at the ED due to a desire to stop drinking; others have already ceased their
alcohol intake and require relief of the symptoms of withdrawal. In addition, alcoholdependent patients with prolonged ED stays may be unable to maintain their usual
ethanol intake and begin to manifest anxiety or tremors. Thus, emergency physicians will encounter many patients with alcohol withdrawal and must be prepared
to treat this syndrome.
Because ethanol has a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS),
withdrawal leads to CNS excitation. Symptoms may range from mild anxiety, nausea
or vomiting, insomnia, and tremor to agitation, hallucinations, seizures, and delirium.
Patients often manifest signs of autonomic hyperactivity (hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia). Withdrawal may occur as
soon as the blood alcohol level starts to fall following an abrupt reduction in or cessation of alcohol intake. Minor withdrawal tends to begin earlier with a peak at 24 to
36 hours while major withdrawal usually occurs after 24 hours with a peak at 50 hours.
Alcohol withdrawal hallucinations may be auditory, visual, or tactile although
auditory ones are most common. Patients with this condition have a clear sensorium. Alcohol withdrawal seizures are tonic-clonic and may occur singly or multiply. Up to one-third of these patients progress to DTs. Delirium tremens is the
most severe form of alcohol withdrawal. It is characterized by fluctuating levels of
consciousness, cognitive disturbances, profound confusion, and severe autonomic
hyperactivity. With treatment, the mortality of DTs is 1% to 10%.
The differential diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal is broad and includes infections
(eg, meningitis, encephalitis), other seizure disorders (eg, epilepsy), endocrine disorders (eg, thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm), trauma (eg, subdural hemorrhage), metabolic abnormalities (eg, hypoglycemia), psychiatric disorders (eg, schizophrenia),
drug intoxications (eg, sympathomimetics, antihistamines), and other types of withdrawal syndromes (eg, benzodiazepines). Benzodiazepines are widely used as anxiolytics, sleep aids, anticonvulsants, and muscle relaxants. Because benzodiazepines
are also CNS depressants, withdrawal from these agents may be clinically indistinguishable from alcohol withdrawal. A history of prolonged or high dose benzodiazepine use may be helpful to differentiate between the two. Abrupt discontinuance of
short-acting benzodiazepines may be symptomatic after 2 to 3 days while withdrawal
from long-acting agents may present up to 7 days after cessation.
Important historical information includes current symptomatology, usual amount
of alcohol consumption, timing of last alcohol intake, comorbidities, and any other
medication or other drug use. The initial evaluation of the patient should involve
the assessment (and stabilization if necessary) of the ABCs. A complete set of vital
signs is paramount in order to identify any autonomic hyperactivity. The patient

556

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

should be examined from head to toe looking for evidence of alternative etiologies
for the patient symptoms (eg, signs of trauma associated with intracranial hemorrhage, nuchal rigidity with meningitis, thyromegaly with thyrotoxicosis, etc). In
addition, a thorough neurologic examination should be performed to identify any
alterations in level of consciousness or mental status as well as any focal deficits.
Diagnostic studies are largely useful in ruling out alternative diagnoses and concomitant medical conditions. Patients with mild alcohol withdrawal may not require
any laboratory studies or imaging. Those with severe withdrawal may require a more
extensive workup including any or all of the following: complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function tests, glucose, liver enzymes, blood gas, thyroid function
studies, cardiac enzymes, urinalysis, urine drug screen, ECG, chest x-ray, computed
tomography of the head, and/or lumbar puncture.

Treatment
Treatment of alcohol withdrawal serves several purposes: symptomatic relief, calming of the patient to allow an adequate evaluation, and prevention of progression
of symptoms. The mainstay of treatment is benzodiazepines, most commonly chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and lorazepam. These medications are titrated to control
the patient agitation, and very high doses may be required. Neuroleptics such as
haloperidol or ziprasidone may be considered for patients who do not respond
adequately to benzodiazepines. In addition, a continuous propofol infusion may
be beneficial in patients with severe withdrawal who are refractory to high dose
benzodiazepines. The alpha-agonist clonidine may be a useful adjunct to counteract
the autonomic hyperactivity associated with alcohol withdrawal. β-Blockers may
also help control tachycardia and hypertension; however, they may mask some of
the earlier signs of impending DTs. Depending on the patient fluid and nutrition
status, IV hydration and repletion of electrolytes (eg, potassium, magnesium, and
phosphorus) may be needed. Malnourished patients should also be given thiamine
and folate replacement.
The disposition of patients with alcohol withdrawal depends on the severity
of symptoms, response to treatment, and availability of outpatient support. If the
patient responds well to therapy in the ED, he/she may be discharged with an oral
benzodiazepine taper, abstinence from alcohol, and participation in a rehabilitation
program. However, patients who require high doses of benzodiazepines and those
who have more severe symptoms or DTs must be admitted.

B. Haloperidol 5 mg IV
C. Lorazepam 2 mg IV
D. Propanolol 100 mg PO

ANSWERS
55.1 C. Clonazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine. Abrupt discontinuance
of short-acting benzodiazepines may be symptomatic after 2 to 3 days while
withdrawal from long-acting agents may present up to 7 days after cessation.
Treatment of benozodiazepine withdrawal involves reinstitution of a benzodiazepine followed by a gradual taper.
55.2 A. The agitation, tremor, and autonomic hyperactivity point towards alcohol
withdrawal. All patients admitted to the hospital for medical or traumatic conditions should be asked about drug and alcohol use. After admission, they may
not have access to the drugs and/or alcohol they regularly use and may present
with withdrawal syndromes.
55.3 C. While all are appropriate treatments for alcohol withdrawal, benzodiazepine dosing is tapered to the patient agitation. It may be redosed at 10 to
30 minute intervals for patients in severe withdrawal. Very high doses may
be required especially if the patient has DTs.

CASE 56
An 18-year-old man presents to the emergency department (ED) agitated, confused and hallucinating. The patient friends state that the group was walking
around in the woods looking for some “weeds to smoke” in order to get “high.”
The patient was first to smoke one of the weeds and subsequently became agitated. His friends decided to bring him to the ED for evaluation. On arrival to the
ED, the patient vital signs are BP 180/100 mm Hg, HR 120 beats per minute, RR
18 breaths per minute, temperature 101°F, and pulse ox 98% on room air. On
physical examination, his pupils are 6 mm, skin is erythematous and warm to
the touch, axillae are dry, abdomen has decreased bowel sounds, and the patient
is grabbing at things that are not there.

ANSWERS TO CASE 56:
Anti-muscarinic Toxidrome
Summary: This is a case of an unknown plant ingestion in a patient who presents
with several signs of toxicity. The key features of this case include recognizing signs
and symptoms of a toxidrome and knowing how to stabilize and manage poisoned
patients. The patient presents with anti-muscarinic toxicity after smoking jimson
weed, which contains belladonna alkaloids. These alkaloids possess strong antimuscarinic properties.
• Most likely diagnosis: Jimson weed (anti-muscarinic) toxicity
• Best initial treatment: Benzodiazepines and consider physostigmine

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Develop an initial approach to the poisoned patient.
2. Learn the 5 basic classes of toxidromes.
3. Understand how to classify a patient into a toxidrome.
4. Understand the initial steps for stabilization of a symptomatic overdose.
5. Review the basic treatment for each of the toxidromes.

Considerations
This patient has several classic features of an anti-muscarinic toxidrome. The primary treatment efforts for the poisoned patient are the same as any other patient:
maintenance and stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulatory systems
(ABCs). For any intentional overdose, levels of acetaminophen and salicylate
levels should be checked due to their ubiquity in medications and great potential
for morbidity and mortality.
In this case, the patient is febrile. Fever in the setting of a toxicologic problem is a
predictor of increased morbidity and mortality. The cause of the fever is usually secondary to increased muscle activity. Initial treatment should include administration
of benzodiazepines (eg diazepam, lorazepam) and intravenous fluids for hydration.
In general, symptomatic poisoned patients require hospital admission for continued monitoring. However, the majority does well with simple supportive care.
The local poison control center should be contacted early in the work-up of all
symptomatic overdoses. This is critical both for epidemiologic purposes as well as
management of complex patients and continuity of care. The national phone number for the nearest poison control center is 1-800-222-1222.

APPROACH TO:
Toxidromes
DEFINITIONS
TOXIDROME: A clinical syndrome that is essential for the successful recognition
of poisoning patterns. A toxidrome is the constellation of signs and symptoms that
suggest a specific class of poisoning.
DECONTAMINATION: Prevention of the continued absorption of a toxicant.
DRUG ABSORPTION: The movement of drug from its site of administration
into the bloodstream.
ADSORPTION: The binding of a chemical (eg, drug or poison) to a solid material
such as activated charcoal.
ANTIDOTE: A remedy to counteract a poison or injury.
OPIATE: A compound found in opium poppies (eg, morphine, codeine, thebane, etc)
that binds to the opiate receptor.
OPIOID: A synthetic (eg, fentanyl, methadone, tramadol, etc) or semi-synthetic
(eg, heroin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, etc) compound that binds to the opiate
receptor.
BODY PACKER: An individual who ingests wrapped packets of illicit drugs such
as cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, ecstasy, marijuana, or hashish to transport them.
BODY STUFFER: Someone who admits to or is strongly suspected of ingesting
illegal drugs in order to escape detection by authorities, and not for recreational
purposes or to transport the drug across borders. Cocaine is the drug most commonly
involved in the body stuffer syndrome.

CLINICAL APPROACH
General Overdose Management
Airway and Breathing The general approach to the overdose patient is to start
with an initial assessment that includes evaluation of the patient airway, breathing,
and circulation (ABCs). The most easily correctable cause of toxicologic death is
airway support. Sedate patients may have a partially obstructed airway due to a
relaxed tongue. In addition, obtunded patients may loose their gag reﬂex. Understand
also, that breathing consists of both oxygenation and ventilation. A hypoxic patient
with a suspected overdose and no history of known medical problems, is also at risk
for poor ventilation. Masking this hypoventilation and hypoxia by applying supplemental oxygen may actually decrease the patient intrinsic respiratory drive and lead
to further hypoventilation. Deﬁnitive airway management includes endotracheal
or nasotracheal intubation.
Circulation Toxidromes can lead to both extreme hypertension and hypotension.
Extreme hypertension (sympathomimetics) may require the use of a direct

562

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

alpha1-receptor antagonist, such as phentermine. Hypotension should ﬁrst be
treated with intravenous ﬂuids. Other agents such as vasopressors (norepinephrine,
dopamine) may be required. Often, cardiac function is also affected in toxidromes.
Tachy- and bradydysrhythmias are both common. Treatment depends on the underlying etiology of the dysrhythmia.

Decontamination In addition to the ABCs, it is also essential to consider decontamination and elimination (or ABCDE) in the management of a poisoned patient.
Decontamination involves preventing further absorption into the system. For
topical contaminations, removing the patient clothing, as well as washing off the
affected area, may be all that is required. Another way of preventing absorption into
the system is the administration of activated charcoal. Activated charcoal comes in
two forms; with and without sorbitol. Sorbitol is thought to facilitate the movement
of activated charcoal through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is, however, a GI
irritant and more than one dose of activated charcoal with sorbitol is not recommended. Patients who have the greatest beneﬁt from activated charcoal include
those who present early in their ingestion (<1 hour), are awake and can drink the
activated charcoal without risk of aspiration, and ingestions whose chemicals are
well absorbed by activated charcoal.
One main concern with the administration of activated charcoal is the potential for aspiration and subsequent charcoal pneumonitis. This risk can be decreased
by administering activated charcoal only to patients who are awake and protecting their airway. In addition to this complication, activated charcoal poorly adsorbs
certain chemicals (see Table 56–1), and therefore will have little benefit in these
ingestions. Moreover, patients with caustic injuries often undergo endoscopy. Prior
administration of activated charcoal may complicate the procedure.
Another method of decontamination is gastric lavage. This is accomplished
by inserting a large oral gastric tube (eg, 40 French) into the stomach for the
rapid administration and removal of large volumes (several liters) of fluid in an
attempt to try to remove whole pills before they are dissolved and absorbed. One
potential adverse effect is lavaging the lungs instead of the stomach. This can be
avoided by intubating the patient prior to lavage. In addition, given the increasing number of bariatric surgery patients, a complication can occur if the tube gets
stuck in the gastric band or causes gastric perforation. Given the large number
of treatment options that are available for a wide variety of ingestions, gastric
lavage should only be performed on patients who present early (<1 hour) and

have a potentially life-threatening ingestion for which there are limited treatment options. This technique is not to be confused with nasogastric lavage (the
administration and subsequent removal of fluid from an NG tube), which has not
been shown to substantially alter the course of any substantially poisoned patient
and usually ends at just removing some of the excipients (starches, waxes, and
binding agents).
Another method of decontamination is whole bowel irrigation. In this method,
a large amount of polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ELS) is
administered through an NG tube at a rate of approximately 1 L an hour. The goal
of this therapy is to push whole pills through the GI tract to prevent absorption.
This method is especially helpful in treatment of body packers and body stuffers as
well as with sustained release medications.

Elimination Once the drug is absorbed into the body, there are options that may
help to increase elimination from the body. These options include multidose charcoal, hemodialysis, charcoal hemoperfusion, and urinary alkalinization. Multidose
charcoal has been shown to be effective with certain drugs, namely dapsone, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, quinine, and theophylline. While the ﬁrst dose of charcoal with these patients can be given with sorbitol, subsequent doses should not
contain sorbitol as it is a GI irritant and can lead to dehydration and GI upset.
Hemodialysis is effective for certain drugs that have a low volume of distribution
(ie, water soluble) and may be used if there is no better antidote or if the patient
is critically ill. Examples of these drugs include lithium, methanol, and aspirin.
Acetaminophen technically is also amenable to dialysis but there is a noninvasive
antidote that is more commonly used.
Charcoal hemoperfusion is similar to arterial venous hemodialysis, except that
the drug is passed through a charcoal filter prior to systemic return. This is particularly effective in phenobarbital and theophylline overdoses as they adsorb well to
charcoal.
Urinary alkalinization is a treatment regimen that increases poison elimination
by the administration of intravenous sodium bicarbonate to produce urine with a pH
>7.5. Alkaline urine facilitates ion trapping and excretion. This method is particularly useful for aspirin and phenobarbital toxicities.
Supplemental Testing
For any intentional overdose, an acetaminophen and salicylate level should be
obtained. These medications are readily accessible and carry a high morbidity and
mortality while being fairly easy to treat if caught early.
For acetaminophen, if the time of ingestion is known and it is a single acute
ingestion, use of the Rumack-Matthew nomogram for acetaminophen toxicity can
determine if the patient requires treatment. If the time of ingestion is unknown
and any detectable acetaminophen level is found then strong consideration should
be given towards treatment. Consideration should also be made with unexplained
elevations in transaminases.
For salicylates, levels above 30 mg/dL should be treated with bicarbonate
infusion and potassium supplementation to increase urinary elimination (prevent

564

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

reabsorption). Certain patients may require dialysis. These include but are not
limited to salicylate-induced pulmonary edema, salicylate-induced encephalopathy, severe acidosis, and levels greater than 80 mg/dL in the correct clinical
setting.
Twelve-lead ECG may be helpful in early identification of sodium channel
blocking drugs (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, diphenhydramine, and various other
antidepressants and antipsychotics). Sodium channel blockade is manifested by a
prolonged QRS complex. The first manifestation of this may be in lead aVR where
it is possible to see an R-R-prime pattern and slurring of the terminal 30 msec of
the QRS complex. Administering intravenous sodium bicarbonate until the QRS
complex narrows helps treat this condition.
Patients with a wide QRS may also have QT prolongation. One should be
careful to distinguish QRS prolongation from QT prolongation. Drugs that affect
potassium efflux or influx or drugs that affect calcium influx will also cause QT
prolongation. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate for a prolonged QRS can
worsen a prolonged QT interval by pushing potassium into cells, which may lead
to torsade de pointes.
Routine urine drug screen testing is not necessary for treatment of an acute
overdose. Most urine drug screen testing is an immunoassay that tests for the presence of drug metabolites and are tailored to a specific core molecule. They do not
necessarily detect the presence of the active compound and they do not tell you if
the patient is under the effects of that particular compound. There are many false
positives and false negatives in any given class of drugs tested on the urine drug
screen. Treatment of an overdose should not wait until the return of the urine
drug screen.

Toxidromes
Sedative Hypnotic This is a large class of drugs, which includes alcohols, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, chloral hydrate, propofol, carisoprodol, and many others.
In general, the sedative hypnotic toxidrome is characterized by relatively normal
vital signs (see Table 56–2) and a relatively normal examination except for a
markedly decreased level of consciousness. The patient may be hypothermic but
this would be due to environmental heat loss and loss of the shiver response.
Treatment for this toxidrome is largely support of airway and breathing. In
the undifferentiated sedative hypnotic patient, administration of flumazenil, a
benzodiazepine antagonist, is not indicated as it may precipitate a benzodiazepine
resistant seizure.
Opioid/Opiate This class of drugs includes synthetics and semi-synthetics
such as fentanyl and meperidine, as well as compounds found in nature and close
derivatives such as morphine and codeine. These agonize the opiate receptors in
the body. Agonism at these receptors induces euphoria, analgesia, antidepressant
effects, and sedation as well as respiratory depression, miosis, decreased GI
motility, and dependence.
Vital signs in these patients may demonstrate decreased respirations and a low
pulse ox. In severe overdoses the patient may be hypotensive or bradycardic or

both. On physical examination the pupils will be small (miotic), bowel sounds are
decreased, reflexes are decreased, and overall level of consciousness is decreased.
Unless the patient has hypotension or bradycardia, the focus is maintaining ventilation and oxygenation. Treatment for hypoxia in the opiate or opioid overdose
patient is either naloxone (Narcan) administration or endotracheal intubation. In
the non-critically ill patient, the amount of naloxone administered should be based
on the patient response. The goal of treatment is to get the patient breathing again,
not necessarily to make the patient awake and conversant. Nalaxone administration
should be avoided in an intubated patient with opiate or opioid overdose since this
will lead to significant vomiting.

Sympathomimetic This class of drugs includes stimulants such as cocaine, ecstasy
and methamphetamine, but may also include therapeutic medications such as
albuterol, pseudoephedrine, and many others. Their mechanisms of action may vary,
but the end result is increased stimulation of the `- and a-adrenergic receptors.
This alpha and beta stimulation results in tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia. Physical examination often reveals dilated pupils (mydriasis), increased
CNS activity (hallucinations or seizures), increased reﬂexes, and diaphoretic skin.
This toxidrome can look very similar to the anti-muscarinic toxidrome, but is usually distinguished by the presence of diaphoresis.
Mortality in these patients is typically from hyperthermia, so it is critical to keep
them cool. Physically restraining a patient who is agitated or delirious without
a sedative medication may lead to rhabdomyolysis and a dangerous increase in
temperature. The mainstay in treatment includes the administration of benzodiazepines
and intravenous fluids. If the patient is still agitated after receiving large doses of
benzodiazepines, consideration should be given to administering barbiturates or
paralysis and intubation.
Antimuscarinic There are a large variety of drugs that fall under the anti-muscarinic toxidrome. These may also be referred to as anticholinergic drugs, but very
few medications have anti-nicotinic activity, and thus we should correctly refer to
this as the anti-muscarinic toxidrome. Antagonism at the muscarinic receptors leads
a physical examination that is very similar to the sympathomimetic toxidrome.
The area in which the sympathomimetic toxidrome differs from the anti-muscarinic
toxidrome is that the antimuscarinic toxidrome will have dry skin while the sympathomimetic toxidrome will have wet skin. Patients tend to be tachycardic,
hypertensive, and febrile. On physical examination they will have mydriatic pupils,
an altered level of consciousness (hallucinating or seizing), urinary retention, and
decreased bowel sounds. There is a mnemonic for this toxidrome: Mad as a hatter
(hallucinations), dry as a bone (anhydrosis), red as a beet (increased agitation and
fever), and blind as a bat (mydriasis).
Treatment of the anti-muscarinic toxidrome varies depending on the severity
of effects and whether the effects are acting more peripherally (anhydrosis) or
centrally (seizure, heart rate, and blood pressure). Peripheral anti-muscarinic

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

567

toxicity can be treated with benzodiazepines. Central anti-muscarinic toxicity
should also be treated with benzodiazepines, and consideration to use a medication
that increases levels of acetylcholine, such as physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor.

Cholinergic Cholinergic drugs are drugs that increase the level of acetylcholine.
This is usually through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Examples of these
medications include edrophonium and physostigmine. Other sources for cholinergic
toxicity include insecticides such as carbamates and organophosphates. Organophosphates are notable in that they have the potential to irreversibly bind and
inhibit acetylcholinesterase–this process is called aging and is highly dependent
upon the type of organophosphate such that signiﬁcant aging varies between 2 to
36 hours after initial binding.
Excess acetylcholine can cause effects at both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors
and its effects depend on the time course and severity of toxicity. Classically, it is
associated with bradycardia and hypoxia secondary to either increased fluid in the
lungs or diaphragmatic paralysis. Other findings on physical examination include
miotic pupils (pinpoint), hyperactive bowel sounds, and excessive secretions from
the mouth, GI tract, and skin.
The mnemonic SLUDGE (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, GI
upset, and Emesis) covers some but not all aspects of this toxidrome. It does not
account for the bradycardia, bronchospasm, and bronchorrhea or the miotic pupils
that are noted on physical examination. An alternative mnemonic is DUMBBELLS
(Defecation, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia, Bronchorrhea/Bronchospasm, Emesis,
Lacrimation, Lethargy, and Salivation).
Treatment involves the administration of anticholinergic medication such as
atropine as well as pralidoxime (2-PAM). Atropine should be administered to help
control bronchorrhea. Pralidoxime should be administered to prevent binding and
aging of the acetylcholinesterase in the case of organophosphate poisoning.

ANSWERS
56.1 D. This patient is exhibiting a cholinergic toxidrome. The mnemonic for this
is DUMBBELLS (Defecation, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia, Bronchorrhea, Emesis, Lacrimation, Lethargy, and Salivation). The treatment is to
prevent the patient from drowning in his or her own saliva by administering
atropine 1 mg at a time until the secretions dry up. In addition, pralidoxime
(2-PAM) is administered to increase acetylcholinesterase availability and
reduce acetylcholine. Benzodiazepines would not help with this patient. Physostigmine is a treatment for anti-muscarinic toxicity and would worsen this
patient condition. Pyridoxine is vitamin B6 and can be useful in treating seizures if they are caused by isoniazid (INH). Naloxone is an opiate antagonist
and while this presentation has some overlap with the opiate toxidrome, this
patient is tachypneic and has excessive secretions that are not seen in the
opiate toxidrome. His exposure was from the pesticides on the farm.
56.2 B. This patient is exhibiting an opiate toxidrome. He has miotic pupils and
decreased respirations, GI motility and mental status. The treatment for
this is patient should include a trial of naloxone; enough to increase his
oxygenation. This patient likely stole opiate medication from his grandmother.
Charcoal would not help this patient as he is already severely symptomatic.
Additionally, charcoal would be contraindicated in this patient because of
the risk of aspiration. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. Lorazepam is
a benzodiazepine. Atropine is a strong anti-muscarinic drug and would not be
helpful in treating this patient.
56.3 C. This patient is exhibiting an antimuscarinic toxidrome. This is characterized by tachycardia, fever, hallucinosis, dilated pupils, hypoactive bowel
sounds, and dry axilla. The mnemonic is: mad as a hatter (hallucinations),
dry as a bone (anhydrosis), red as a beet (increased agitation and fever), and
blind as a bat (mydriasis). Treatment should be either decreasing the agitation and temperature through benzodiazepines or increasing acetylcholine by
preventing its metabolism (physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor).
Atropine is an anti-muscarinic drug and would worsen this patient toxidrome.
Pralidoxime is a drug which makes acetylcholinesterase work again after exposure to an organophosphate. This patient does not have signs of cholinergic
excess, therefore, pralidoxime would not be helpful. Flumazenil should not be
given to adult patients because, as acting benzodiazepine antagonist, it may
precipitate seizures that are not responsive to benzodiazepines. Fomepizole
is an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and is helpful in the treatment of
patients poisoned with ethylene glycol, methanol or other toxic alcohols. This
patient had an accidental overdose of her diphenhydramine for her seasonal
allergies.

570

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

56.4 B. This patient is exhibiting a sympathomimetic toxidrome. Her presentation is very similar to the patient in question 3. However, the key difference
is that this patient has wet skin, while the patient in question 3 has dry skin.
The patient should receive as much lorazepam as is needed to stop the
seizure and allow the temperature to fall. Physostigmine is a treatment for
anti-muscarinic toxicity and would not be helpful in this patient. Labetalol is a
β-blocker. This patient has signs of active sympathomimetic excess. Treatment
with a a-blocker may lead to unopposed `-1 agonism and potentially may
worsen a patient tissue perfusion. While this patient is wet, she has none of
the other signs of a cholinergic toxicity. Therefore, atropine and pralidoxime
are not recommended. Phytonadione is vitamin K and is the treatment for
warfarin toxicity. This patient recently used crack cocaine.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Patients who are hypoxic from an overdose typically will require a definitive airway such as endotracheal or nasotracheal intubation.



Fever from an overdose is a poor prognostic indicator and should usually
be addressed with large doses of benzodiazepines and intravenous fluids.



Symptomatic patients require observation or admission until they are
asymptomatic.



In the undifferentiated altered mental status patient, blood sugar level
should immediately be checked.



The nearest poison control center should be contacted (1-800-222-1222)
for overdoses, accidental ingestions, and adverse drug effects.

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS TO CASE 57:
Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
Summary: This is an injection drug user with a fever and a skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) of the upper extremity and shoulder.
• Most likely diagnosis: Soft tissue abscess from injection drug use. However,
necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is a distinct possibility, and the differential diagnosis also includes cellulitis and septic shoulder joint.
• Next steps: Establish IV access. IV antibiotics are generally indicated when
a SSTI produces a fever. Establish a definitive diagnosis as quickly as possible,
beginning with a careful search for a pus pocket. If an abscess is found it must be
drained. If not, NSTI remains a possibility and immediate surgical exploration
is indicated. Search for signs of sepsis, and if present begin early goal directed
therapy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the range of SSTIs, which can look remarkably similar on first
inspection.
2. Become familiar with the usual pathogens responsible for SSTIs and the antimicrobial agents that are commonly used for empirical therapy.
3. Understand that NSTIs can be life threatening, rapidly progressive and difficult
to diagnose.
4. Recognize the risk factors associated with necrotizing infections and with unusual
pathogens.
5. Appreciate that uncomplicated abscesses often require only incision and
drainage, and no antibiotics, for cure.

Considerations
SSTIs are among the most common problems seen in the ED, accounting for
3.4 million annual visits in the United States alone. There has been a recent rise in
the incidence of these infections linked to the emergence of community-associated
methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. While simple abscesses predominate,
there is a range of distinct SSTI types, which includes deep abscesses, nonpurulent
cellulitis and NSTIs. NSTIs can be rapidly life-threatening and timely diagnosis is
often difficult. SSTIs of all types are extremely common in injection drug users, and
thus in emergency departments that serve an injection drug use population. Red
flags can alert the astute clinician to a necrotizing infection as well as to unusual
pathogens that require special antibiotics. To complicate matters, other diseases
affecting the skin and underlying tissues can be confused with infection, particularly

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

573

gout and other forms of arthritis and bursitis, allergic reactions to insect bites and
deep vein thrombosis.
Diagnosis and management of SSTIs can be tricky. Different types of SSTIs,
that require different approaches to management, can appear similar. While diagnostic
tests such as bedside ultrasound, CT scan and blood lactate levels can be helpful,
in most cases correct diagnosis relies solely on the bedside exam and judgment of
the emergency physician. Many of these infections are primarily a surgical disease.
Effective management often requires only the skillful administration of anesthetic
and incision and drainage in the ED, but occasionally, immediate exploration and
debridement in the operating room is required. Similarly, while judicious use of antibiotics is an important principal in the management of most simple SSTIs, serious
SSTIs will occasionally cause sepsis syndrome, in which case immediate antibiotic
administration and aggressive resuscitation is imperative.

DEFINITIONS
SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE INFECTION (SSTI): An infection, usually bacterial, of the skin and/or underlying soft tissues.
NECROTIZING SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE INFECTION (NSTI): A rapidly
spreading bacterial infection (monomicrobial or polymicrobial) of the soft tissue
below the skin surface including fat, fascia (fasciitis), and muscle (myositis).
PURULENT (CULTURABLE) CELLULITIS: Infection and/or inflammatory
changes of the skin surrounding a purulent focus (usually an abscess).
NONPURULENT (NON-CULTURABLE) CELLULITIS: An infection of the
skin and underlying dermis without an identifiable purulent focus.
ERYSIPELAS: Nonpurulent cellulitis restricted to the superficial skin layers with
a sharply demarcated border.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Diagnosis
Clinical evaluation of SSTIs always begins with a search for a pus pocket, because
both the differential diagnosis and clinical management depend on whether or not
there is pus (Figure 57–1). Circular infections (as opposed to circumferential) on the
buttock, groin and lower extremity almost always harbor pus near the center. First
look for a visible spot of purulence or necrosis. Then palpate carefully for fluctuance,
which can be subtle. Fluctuance may be absent if the abscess is deep, as often occurs
in the pannus of the buttock or thigh, or if the abscess is early in its course. Very deep
intramuscular abscesses can occur with injection drug use. Bedside ultrasound, using
a high frequency linear transducer, can identify deep abscesses that are not appreciated on physical examination. On ultrasound, the abscess cavity typically appears

anechoic (black with no echo). CT scan is considered the gold standard for abscess
diagnosis, and is used to identify those near the neck, groin and perineum.
Spontaneous, superficial skin abscesses are called furuncles and patients often
assume these are spider bites. Skin abscesses are usually caused by S aureus–over half
by MRSA–and less commonly β-hemolytic streptococcal species. Abscesses associated with injection drug use, and those occurring near the perineum may contain
gram negative and anaerobic bacteria. Abscesses are typically surrounded by a variable amount of cellulitis (so-called purulent cellulitis), and large abscesses may cause
fever.
If an abscess is not present; the main diagnostic considerations are cellulitis
versus NSTI (Figure 57–1).
Nonpurulent cellulitis tends to occur on the lower extremities in a circumferential
pattern, often in an area of preexisting edema. The etiology is usually β-hemolytic
streptococcal species, such as S pyogenes. Cellulitis may be associated with lymphangitis and fever. Erysipelas is a superficial, sharply demarcated cellulitis caused by
S pyogenes that often occurs in elderly patients on the face or lower extremities, and
causes fever and leukocytosis.
Cellulitis in certain settings is always considered high risk, either because it is
caused by esoteric or resistant pathogens, or because of the likelihood of severe
disease requiring admission or an operation. Infected puncture wounds of any kind
are high risk and likely to involve deep structures like bone, joint or tendon, and
to respond poorly to conventional antibiotics alone. Tenosynovitis, an orthopedic
emergency, can complicate puncture wounds on the palmar hand and fingers.
Diabetic foot ulcers, when infected, tend to harbor multiple resistant pathogens,
can lead to NSTI, and generally require specialized podiatric care. Infected

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

mammalian bite wounds, covered elsewhere in this textbook, are high risk, often
harbor Pasteurella species or Eikinella (human bites) and generally require admission.
Unusual pathogens that cause SSTIs in the setting of water exposure include Vibrio
vulnificus, which often causes a necrotizing infection and sepsis, Erysipelothrix, and
Aeromonas.
NSTIs are among the most feared infections in medicine. These infections typically spread rapidly along subcutaneous and muscular facial planes and produce toxins
and trigger an intense cytokine response that lead to septic shock. Classically,
NSTIs occur in the setting of devitalized tissue, such as from a shrapnel wound, and
the etiology is polymicrobial, with C perfringens among the pathogens. A spontaneous, monomicrobial form of NSTI also occurs, typically caused by S pyogenes, but
occasionally by Clostridial species or MRSA. Rapid diagnosis requires that the clinician be familiar with the risk factors for NSTI and red flags on physical examination
(see Table 57–1).
An important risk factor for community onset necrotizing fasciitis is injection drug use, particularly subcutaneous and intramuscular injection (“skin
popping”) of black tar heroin. Other infection patterns that should raise a red flag
are neglected diabetic foot ulcers and infections of the perineum, particularly in
men. Classical skin signs such as necrosis, bullae or crepitance are often absent.
The Clostridial infections associated with injection drug use may produce dramatic tissue edema and extreme leukocytosis. The combination of extreme leukocytosis and hyponatremia is suggestive of an NSTI. Diagnostic imaging can
be helpful. Plane x-ray and CT scan may demonstrate gas along facial planes or
within muscle, or an unsuspected abscess may be seen. When NSTI is suspected,
however, the best diagnostic approach is prompt surgical exploration. The
diagnosis is made when subcutaneous devitalized tissue, muscle necrosis and
“dishwater pus” are found.
The bacteriology of the major forms of SSTI, are listed in Table 57–2, along with
recommended antibiotics.

Management
Abscesses require drainage. Management begins with providing complete analgesia for the procedure. Options include local anesthetic, regional nerve block, and
procedural sedation. In most cases drainage is best accomplished by incision with
a scalpel and exploration of the cavity with a clamp, although needle aspiration
is a good option for small abscesses on the face. Delaying drainage for a follow up
visit is rarely the right plan. Small abscesses do not require packing. Large abscesses
should be packed and the packing can be changed at 24-hour, either upon emergency department follow-up or by the patient themselves. Most simple abscesses do
not require any antibiotics after incision and drainage. Small and uncomplicated
abscesses rarely cause fever. If fever is present in these patient alternative sources
should be considered. Antibiotics should be reserved for complicated abscesses,
defined as >5cm, having a large area of surrounding cellulitis, or occurring in an
immunosuppressed host. Admission for IV antibiotics should be considered for
large abscesses accompanied by fever. Staphylococcal coverage, including MRSA,
is required. Recommended agents include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for oral
therapy and vancomycin for IV therapy.
Nonpurulent cellulitis requires antibiotics for cure. Most cases can be treated
with oral antibiotics and elevation of the affected part. Good Streptococcal coverage is required, usually with a first generation cephalosporin. (Therapy for purulent
cellulitis must cover Staphylococcus as well; see above.) Admission for IV antibiotics
is usually required if there is fever, lymphangitis or poorly controlled diabetes.
The biggest challenge with NSTIs is timely diagnosis. Once the suspicion for
necrotizing infection reaches a reasonable threshold, the emergency physician
should immediately consult a surgeon and request operative exploration for both
definitive diagnosis and treatment. Immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is
also important, and must cover streptococcal species, anaerobes and MRSA. Good
choices are vancomycin plus clindamycin or pipercillin-tazobactam. If signs of sepsis
are present (hypotension or lactate >4 mg/dL), central access and early goal directed
therapy should be initiated.

578

CASE FILES: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

ANSWERS
57.1 A. Necrotic spider bites are unusual, whereas spontaneous furuncles (superficial skin abscesses) are extremely common in emergency practice. Patients
with furuncles often complain of a “spider bite”. MRSA accounts for 50% to
60% of all SSTIs in US emergency departments and may be even more common in spontaneous furuncles. While most of these simple infections are cured
by incision and drainage alone, if antibiotics are deemed necessary, MRSA
coverage is a must, with either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline
or clindamycin.
57.2 C. This case is a classical presentation for a deep buttock or thigh abscess
related to heroin injection. A septic hip or necrotizing infection should also
be considered, although consultation for suspected NSTI is premature at this
point. Nonpurulent cellulitis is very unlikely and simply treating with antibiotics is incorrect management. These abscesses can be very large and may cause
a low-grade fever. When there is no obvious fluctuance, imaging with should
be pursued with ultrasound, or occasionally CT, to confirm the diagnosis and
guide drainage. Needle aspiration is reserved for small facial abscesses, and has
no proven diagnostic role. Given the fever, this patient will likely require IV
antibiotics and admission, as well procedural sedation via IV.
57.3 B. In a healthy host, an abscess 5 cm or less with only minimal to moderate
surrounding cellulitis does not require antibiotics. This is supported by multiple studies. Long acting local anesthetic, such as bupivicaine, should be deposited in a ring around the abscess several minutes before incision and drainage.
Packing is advised for abscesses that are more than a cm or so below the skin
surface, as is commonly encountered in the buttocks, but it can be removed
by the patient, with or without repacking. Soaking and scrubbing with soapy
water is also recommended.
57.4 E. Necrotizing soft tissue infections are uncommon but potentially devastating and the diagnosis is rarely obvious at first presentation. Shock or organ
dysfunction is initially evident in only 0% to 40% of cases. Classical skin
signs are important red flags to recognize, but are frequently absent, and gas
on plane x-ray is seen in 30% of cases, at most. Risk factors include diabetic
foot ulcer, infections of the scrotum and perineum in men and injection
drug use–which, in urban centers, is the leading cause of community onset
necrotizing infections. Importantly, group A streptococcal NSTIs can occur
spontaneously. NSTIs caused by community-associated MRSA have been
reported.

CASE 58
A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department (ED) by his parents
because of a rash that developed yesterday evening. The rash began on his neck
and chest, then gradually spread to include his entire body except for his face. It
does not seem to be painful nor pruritic. Although the child has had a fever and
mild cough recently, he states that he “feels fine” and has not had any change in
his behavior or oral intake. His parents deny any recent travel, camping or contact
with animals. However, the boy does attend daycare, and several other children
there have been ill recently. He is an otherwise healthy child with no history of
major illness or medication allergies. He is taking acetaminophen as needed for
the fever, and his immunizations are up to date.
On examination, his temperature is 38.9°C (102.1°F), blood pressure is
96/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 112 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per
minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The boy is sleeping comfortably
in his mother arms but awakes easily during the examination. He does not appear
acutely ill. His examination is unremarkable except for an erythematous maculopapular rash covering his neck, torso and extremities.

ANSWERS TO CASE 58:
Rash With Fever
Summary: This is a 3-year-old boy that presents with a rash, fever, and mild upper
respiratory symptoms. On examination, he appears well and hydrated. He has a
generalized maculopapular rash that spares the face.
• Most likely diagnosis: Viral exanthem
• Management: Symptomatic relief (eg, fever control) and follow up with his
primary care physician as needed

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Define terminology used to describe rashes.
2. Review several causes of rash with fever.
3. Identify “red flags” associated with serious causes of rash.

Considerations
This 3-year-old boy has a maculopapular rash associated with fever and mild cough.
The differential diagnosis is broad but can be focused by taking a detailed history
and performing a thorough examination (that includes noting the appearance and
distribution of skin lesions). Identifying specific etiologies may be difficult as multiple organisms and disease processes often cause similar types of rashes. Although
most rashes are not associated with serious or life-threatening disorders, the ED
physician must be able to identify those that are.

APPROACH TO:
Rash With Fever
CLINICAL APPROACH
Patients presenting with rash and fever have a broad differential diagnosis that
includes relatively minor as well as life-threatening etiologies. A thorough history
and physical examination and familiarity with common patterns of skin lesions and
their potential causes will help the emergency physician make a quick diagnosis and
accurate treatment plan.
Important historical questions include initial appearance and location of skin
lesions, direction and rate of progression, duration of rash, and associated features
such as pain or pruritis. The clinician should also inquire about systemic complaints
(eg, fever, cough, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, mental status changes,
and joint pain) and recent exposures (eg, medications, known allergens, animals,
chemicals, foods, travel, and sick contacts). Past medical, family, and sexual histories may also provide clues as to the etiology of the rash.

Patients with abnormal vital signs or evidence of toxicity may require initial stabilization before a detailed examination can be performed. If the patient is stable,
care should be taken to inspect the entire body including mucous membranes. It is
important to identify the color, morphology (listed in Table 58–1), location, and
pattern of arrangement (including symmetry and configuration) of any lesions. A
complete physical examination can help elicit additional diagnostic clues (eg, neck
examination for nuchal rigidity and neurologic exam in patients with suspected
meningococcemia [see Figure 58–1] or pelvic examination in those with possible
disseminated gonococcemia). Although laboratory testing is not required for the
evaluation of most rashes, it may be useful in some specific circumstances such

descriptions of several infectious causes of rash with fever. Differentiating an infectious from allergic rash can be difficult. Classically allergic rashes are pruritic rather
than painful. They may be associated with the recent addition of a new medication
or ingestion of an offending agent or appear in the area of contact with an environmental allergen. Wheals and urticaria are often associated with an allergic reaction.
Rheumatologic rashes may appear similar to infectious or allergic ones but usually
present with other systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or arthralgias.
“Red flags” for potentially serious or life-threatening causes of rash include history of immunocompromised, fever, toxic appearance, hypotension, petechiae or
purpura, diffuse erythema, severe or localized pain, and mucosal lesions. Petechiae
and purpura can be associated with infectious conditions such as Rocky Mountain
spotted fever or meningococcemia as well as coagulopathies such as disseminated
intravascular coagulation. Diffuse erythema can be a harbinger of toxic shock syndrome, Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, or necrotizing fasciitis. Mucosal
lesions may be a sign of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis
(TEN). These conditions are classically associated with drug exposures (such as
sulfa, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) or viral infections although many cases are
idiopathic. Both conditions involve systemic symptoms (eg, fever), mucosal erosions, and diffuse cutaneous vesiculobullous lesions with epidermal detachment.
They are differentiated by the amount of body surface area (BSA) involved (TEN:
>30% BSA epidermal detachment). Patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and
TEN are prone to infection and dehydration.

Treatment
Treatment is based on identification of the underlying process. The specific cause
of many viral exanthems remains unidentified. These patients are usually treated
symptomatically if they are otherwise well-appearing and hydrated. Rashes caused
by bacteriologic organisms generally require antibiotic therapy. Table 58–2 lists
some common disease processes with their appropriate diagnostic findings and treatments. Mild allergic reactions may be treated with removal of the offending allergen
and antihistamines with or without corticosteroids. Patients with Steven-Johnson
syndrome or TEN require admission for IV hydration and other supportive care.

classic rash and “three Cs” (cough, conjunctivitis, and coryza).
58.2 D. Fever, pruritis, and maculopapular rash can be seen with numerous conditions. However, the linear confluence is more consistent with an allergic reaction secondary to an environmental exposure (eg, pattern due to an object,
such as poison ivy, brushing against the boy leg).
58.3 B. This girl is lethargic. She has fever, meningeal signs, and a rash concerning for meningococcemia. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be started
immediately.

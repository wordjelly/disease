CASE 1:

A PAINFUL KNEE IN A NEONATE

History
A young primigravida mother has become concerned about her newborn child. She is
accompanied in the clinic by her aunt who recognized that something was not quite
right but was not sure what to advise. The baby has general symptoms of fever, fatigue,
irritability and malaise. There is no history of trauma.
Examination
Close inspection of the left leg reveals some localized oedema and erythema. On palpation
the baby appears to have pain overlying the proximal tibia. Passive manipulation shows
a full range of movement of the leg without any obvious indications of pain.
Investigations
Initial investigations show a markedly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Imaging studies
of the knee show periosteal elevation of the proximal tibial metaphysis (Fig. 1.1).

Figure 1.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the radiological signs?
• What blood tests would be most useful?

1

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 1
The diagnosis is acute haematogenous osteomyelitis. Septic arthritis is less likely in view
of the excellent range of movement. There are two principal types of acute osteomyelitis:
• haematogenous osteomyelitis
• direct or contiguous inoculation osteomyelitis.
Acute haematogenous osteomyelitis is characterized by an acute infection of the bone
caused by the seeding of the bacteria within the bone from a remote source. This condition occurs primarily in children. The most common site is the rapidly growing and
highly vascular metaphysis of growing bones. Direct or contiguous inoculation osteomyelitis is caused by direct contact of the tissue and bacteria during trauma or surgery.
Clinical manifestations are more localized and tend to involve multiple organisms.
Predisposing comorbidities include diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, acquired immune
deﬁciency syndrome (AIDS), intravenous drug abuse, alcoholism, chronic steroid use,
immunosuppression, and chronic joint disease. Other possibilities are the presence of a
prosthetic orthopaedic device, recent orthopaedic surgery or an open fracture.
In general, osteomyelitis has a bimodal age distribution. Acute haematogenous osteomyelitis is primarily a disease in children. Direct trauma and contiguous focus osteomyelitis
are more common among adults and adolescents than in children. Spinal osteomyelitis is
more common in individuals older than 45 years.
The bacterial pathogen varies on the basis of the patient’s age and the mechanism of
infection:
• in neonates (<4 months) – Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter spp, and group A and
B Streptococcus spp
• in children (4 months to 4 years) – S. aureus, group A Streptococcus spp, Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae and Enterobacter spp
• in children and adolescents (4 years to adult) – S. aureus (80 per cent), group A
Streptococcus spp, H. inﬂuenzae and Enterobacter spp
• in adults – S. aureus and occasionally Enterobacter or Streptococcus spp.
Responsible pathogens may be isolated in only 35–40 per cent of infections.
With direct osteomyelitis the organisms include S. aureus, Enterobacter spp and
Pseudomonas spp. In the presence of puncture wounds there may be S. aureus and
Pseudomonas spp; and in the presence of sickle cell disease, S. aureus and Salmonella
spp.
Appropriate antibiotics are selected using direct culture results. Empirical therapy is often
initiated on the basis of the patient’s age and the clinical presentation. Further surgical
management may involve removal of the nidus of infection and implantation of antibiotic beads until resolution of the infection.
Plain radiographs may show evidence of soft-tissue swelling after 3–5 days. Bony changes
are usually present at 14–21 days. The earliest bony changes are periosteal elevation followed by cortical or medullary lucencies. At 28 days, 90 per cent of patients demonstrate
some abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is effective in the early detection
of osteomyelitis with a sensitivity ranging from 90 to 100 per cent. Radionuclide bone
scanning using a 3-phase bone scan with technetium-99m may show up increased tracer
uptake in the affected region. Additional information can be obtained from scanning
with leucocytes labelled with gallium-67 and/or indium-111. Computed tomography (CT)
2

Orthopaedics

scanning can demonstrate calciﬁcation, ossiﬁcation, and intracortical abnormalities. CT
is particularly helpful in the evaluation of spinal vertebral lesions. Ultrasonography is
useful in children with acute osteomyelitis. This modality can detect abnormalities as
early as 1–2 days after onset of symptoms. The abnormalities include soft-tissue abscess
or ﬂuid collection and periosteal elevation.
The white cell count may be elevated, but it is frequently normal. The C-reactive protein
level is usually elevated, but this is non-speciﬁc. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
is elevated in 90 per cent, but this ﬁnding is clinically non-speciﬁc. Blood culture results
are positive in only 50 per cent of patients with haematogenous osteomyelitis. Culture
or aspiration ﬁndings in samples of the infected site are normal in 25 per cent of cases.
KEY POINTS

Osteomyelitis can be a result of haematogenous or direct spread.
The earliest radiographic change is periosteal elevation.

CASE 2:

ATRAUMATIC PAINFUL JOINTS IN A BOY

History
A 10-year-old boy has been brought to the emergency department by his father. The
youngster was in a playground when he developed a swollen and painful right knee. The
boy describes recurrent episodes of pain and swelling in his knees and shoulders over
the last year or so. He cannot remember any history of trauma. He does, however, have a
history of multiple blood transfusions but he is unsure of the reason for these.
Examination
The boy has painful, tensely swollen, warm and diffusely tender knee and shoulder joints
(Fig. 2.1). He also has multiple bruises over his legs and arms.

Figure 2.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the causes of this condition?
• What is the pathophysiology of joint involvement in this condition?

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 2
This youngster suffers from recurrent episodes of atraumatic painful effusions to his knee
joints. He also has a history of multiple blood transfusions. He suffers from a blood dyscrasia leading to haemarthrosis. The most common condition seen in orthopaedic practice
is haemophilia and it is most likely in this patient.
Haemophilic arthropathy is a condition associated with a clotting disorder leading to
recurrent bleeding into the joints. Over time this can lead to joint destruction. Individuals
with haemophilias A and B most commonly have haemophilic arthropathy. Haemophilia
A (classic haemophilia) is associated with a factor VIII deﬁciency and is a sex-linked
recessive trait. This occurs in approximately 1 per 5000 live male births, with 25 per
cent of cases being sporadic (no family history). Other clotting disorders may also lead
to haemarthrosis, examples being haemophilia B (Christmas disease) and factor IX
deﬁciency.
Haemosiderin deposition within the joint leads to synovial hypertrophy, bone erosions,
recurrent bleeding, and eventual destruction of the articular surfaces and arthroﬁbrosis.
The stages of degenerative changes in the joint are summarized below.

!

Stages of joint changes with haemarthrosis

•
•
•
•

Grade 1: Soft-tissue swelling (effusions, synovial thickening)
Grade 2: Widened epiphysis, small erosions (normal cartilage interval)
Grade 3: Large erosions, bone cysts, cartilage loss
Grade 4: Joint destruction and subluxation

KEY POINTS

• Haemosiderin deposition within the joint leads to synovial hypertrophy, bone erosions
and recurrent bleeding.

• Recurrent haemarthrosis can lead to joint destruction of the affected joints.
• Synovectomy should be considered, or replace or fuse the joint.

CASE 3:

AN ATRAUMATIC PAINFUL HIP

History
A 32-year-old Afro-Caribbean man was intending to visit his mother in Africa. While
packing he noticed a progressively worsening pain in the left groin. The pain radiated
down the upper thigh and was present at rest. There were no aggravating or relieving
factors and no associated symptoms of numbness or tingling. The pain was severe and
constant in nature for several days. He had also noticed some mild discomfort in his left
hip. He recalls no previous episodes. He obtained temporary relief of his pain with simple
analgesia. He has a history of asthma and has been taking regular steroids over the last
15 years. He drinks 20 units of alcohol per week and smokes 20 cigarettes a day. There
is no history of trauma and he is systemically well.
Examination
The man walks with a severe limp. Assessment of his hip abductors reveals a positive
Trendelenburg sign on the left side. Measurement of the true leg lengths reveals a 1 cm
shortening in the left leg compared to the right. Movement of the hip is painful but not
signiﬁcantly restricted. He has no obvious neurological or vascular deﬁcit of the legs. A
radiograph of this patient is shown in Fig. 3.1.

Figure 3.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• Describe the blood supply to the femoral head.
• What factors predispose to this condition?
• How would you investigate and classify this condition?
• What are the management options?

7

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 3
This man has insidious and persistent left groin pain that is exacerbated by weight-bearing. This pain arises from his hip joint. While he retains a good range of movement, he
has pain. He also has true leg shortening. He has mild symptoms in the right hip. Finally,
he has a history of being on steroids and is a heavy smoker and consumes alcohol. All
these signs indicate that the most likely diagnosis is avascular necrosis of the femoral
head. This is the most common site to undergo avascular necrosis. The condition is
bilateral in 50 per cent of patients. Around 10 per cent are asymptomatic and diagnosed
incidentally.
The blood supply to the femoral head is derived from an arterial ring around the neck of
femur. The ring anastomosis is mainly from the medial femoral circumﬂex artery posteriorly and minor branches of the lateral femoral circumﬂex artery anteriorly. These vessels
traverse the femoral neck to perforate the head close to the articular cartilage. Ten per
cent of the blood supply comes from the vessels in the ligamentum teres.
An injury or ischaemia can predispose to arterial cut-off, venous stasis, intravascular
thrombosis, intraosseus sinusoidal compression or a combination of these. The decreased
blood ﬂow to the femoral head leads to increased intraosseus pressure, osteonecrosis and
ﬁnally collapse of the femoral head.
Traumatic causes of avascular necrosis of the femoral head are fracture of neck of femur
and dislocation of the femoral head. Non-traumatic causes include steroid use, alcoholism, marrow-replacing diseases like Gaucher’s disease, high-dose radiotherapy, hypercoagulable states, sickle cell disease, hyperﬁbrinolysis, thrombophilia, protein C and S
deﬁciency, and Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease (LCPD).
Imaging the hip with anteroposterior and lateral views is the initial investigation. In
early cases the radiographs may not reveal any signs of avascular necrosis. In late
cases, subchondral sclerosis (increased density of the affected area, crescent sign), a thin
subchondral fracture line in the necrotic segment, ﬂattening of the femoral head, and collapse of the femoral head can be seen. The important differentiating point from advanced
osteoarthritis is the preservation of joint space during the early stages of the disease.
MRI scans are the investigation of choice in patients with normal radiographs. They can
show early changes in the bone marrow long before the appearance of X-ray features.
There are a number of classiﬁcations for avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The most
commonly used classiﬁcation was described by Ficat and associates in 1960, based on
radiological ﬁndings and bone scans.

!

The Ficat classification
Pre-collapse phase

• Ficat I: No X-ray changes
• Ficat II: Early X-ray changes, no distortion of femoral head
Post-collapse phase
• Ficat III: Increased bone destruction, femoral head deformed on X-ray
• Ficat IV: Complete collapse of femoral head with destruction of hip joint seen on
X-ray

8

Orthopaedics

Management depends on the stage of disease seen at ﬁrst presentation. If early avascular
necrosis is left untreated it is likely to progress to the advanced stages. Management of
pre-collapse avascular necrosis comprises surgical intervention with core decompression
with or without bone grafts.
KEY POINTS

The femoral head is the most common site to undergo avascular necrosis.
The condition is bilateral in 50 per cent of cases.
Traumatic and atraumatic causes have been identified.
Radiographs may be normal in the early stages.

CASE 4:

AN EXPANDING MASS IN THE LEG OF AN ADOLESCENT

History
A 15-year-old boy was on holiday abroad with his parents. While sunbathing the boy
asked his father to apply suntan lotion to his legs. The father then noticed a lump over the
proximal aspect of his son’s tibia that was not present on the other leg. The boy explained
that the lump had been there for nearly 6 months but had been increasing in size over the
recent few weeks. The family immediately returned home to consult their doctor.
Examination
On inspection there is a ﬁrm, irregular and tender mass arising from the proximal tibia.
The boy describes no pain on palpation of the lump and his range of movement is full.
There are no other lumps. Radiographs of his knee are shown in Figs 4.1 and 4.2. His
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum alkaline phosphatase are raised.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• Describe the features of the X-rays.
• How would you confirm the diagnosis?
• What are the principles of management of this condition?

11

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 4
This boy has an osteosarcoma of the proximal tibia. A ﬁrm, irregular mass ﬁxed to underlying structures is more suspicious of a malignant lesion. This is a malignant tumour of
the proximal tibia. This is the most common primary malignant bone tumour of mesenchymal derivation. The tumour arises in adolescents and affects males more often than
females. The most common site affected is in the region of the knee in the metaphyseal
part of the bone. Other sites include the proximal humerus, proximal femur and pelvis,
and the spine is rarely involved.
Osteosarcoma can present as purely osteolytic or osteoblastic or a mixture of the two
types. Elevation of the periosteum may appear as a classic Codman’s triangle. Near the
junction of the healthy bone with the tumour there is reactive new bone formation
beneath the periosteum as seen in the proximal tibia in this case. Extension of the tumour
through the periosteum may produce a sunburst appearance which is also present in the
X-rays. Remember always to image the entire bone to assess for skip lesions or joint
involvement.
A biopsy of the lesion will help conﬁrm the diagnosis. The biopsy should be undertaken
ideally by the same surgeon who will be responsible for the deﬁnitive tumour resection
in a dedicated bone and soft-tissue sarcoma unit. Biopsies performed without communication with the dedicated sarcoma unit’s input can lead to amputation of a salvageable
limb.
The Enneking staging system is the most widely used. The key components in staging
are histological grade (low-grade vs high-grade), the anatomical location of the tumour
(intracompartmental vs extracompartmental), and the presence or absence of metastatic
disease.
Management comprises staging of the tumour, neo-adjuvant treatment, and surgery in a
specialist bone and soft-tissue sarcoma unit with a multidisciplinary team.
Most patients have micrometastases at the time of presentation. All should be screened
for pulmonary metastasis. The principle of treatment is, therefore, to combine surgery
(limb salvage or amputation) with chemotherapy. Limb salvage is possible only if the
nerves can be preserved, adequate muscles and soft tissues can be left intact while a
reasonably wide margin of resection of the tumour can be achieved. Radiotherapy is
usually reserved for palliation and disease location in an inaccessible location. Pre- and
postoperative chemotherapy is used for osteosarcoma. Patients with a greater than 95 per
cent tumour cell kill or necrosis have a better prognosis than those whose tumours do
not respond as favourably. With adjuvant chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate can be
greater than 50 per cent.

derivation.
The most common site affected is in the region of the knee.
MRI of the primary lesion is the best method to use.
Biopsy of the lesion will help confirm the diagnosis.
Management comprises staging of the tumour, neo-adjuvant treatment, and surgery in
a specialist unit.

CASE 5:

A BOY WITH A SWOLLEN MASS IN HIS THIGH

History
A 14-year-old boy presents to his general practitioner with a swelling around the mid
shaft of his femur. His mother has brought him in following his complaints of tiredness
and intermittent fevers over the last few weeks, which has caused him to miss football
training and to be inactive.
Examination
Manual examination of the mid thigh reveals a tender mass. The mass is ﬁrm and appears
to be well ﬁxed to the underlying muscle. There are no neurological or vascular deﬁcits
to the leg. Initial investigations reveal elevated white blood cells (WBC), erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) and anaemia. A radiograph of the femur is shown in Fig. 5.1.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• Describe the features of the X-ray.

• What is the prognosis?

13

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 5
The diagnosis is Ewing’s sarcoma. The features suspicious of a malignant lesion in this
age group are the ﬁrm, ﬁxed mass, its location, and raised inﬂammatory markers associated with anaemia, fatigue and intermittent fevers. This condition typically occurs in
young patients and presents with pain and fever.
The tumour was ﬁrst described by James Ewing in 1921 and is the second most common
primary malignant bone tumour (the ﬁrst being osteosarcoma). The tumour is more common in males and affects children and young adults. The majority develop this between
the ages of 10 and 20 years. Rarely, the tumour develops in adults older than 30 years.
The earliest symptom is pain, which is initially intermittent but becomes intense. Rarely,
a patient may present with a pathological fracture. Eighty-ﬁve per cent of patients have
chromosomal translocations associated with the 11/22 chromosome. Ewing’s sarcoma is
potentially the most aggressive form of the primary bone tumours. The most common
sites affected are the femoral diaphysis, pelvis, tibia, humerus, ﬁbula and ribs.
Radiological features seen in the femoral shaft include a typical onion-skin appearance
or sunburst pattern due to spread of the tumour via Haversian canals with periosteal
reaction which indicates an aggressive process. In some patients, Codman triangles may
be present at the margins of the lesion. These result from the elevation of the periosteum
and central destruction of the periosteal reaction caused by the tumour. Radiographs
may vary from highly lytic to predominantly sclerotic in appearance. Most commonly,
radiographs show a long, permeative lytic lesion in the meta-diaphysis and diaphysis of
the bone. Sclerotic lesions are less common. MRI provides a more accurate assessment of
the tumour size and relation to the surrounding structures.
Patients are usually assigned to one of two groups, the tumour being classiﬁed as either
localized or metastatic disease. Tumours in the pelvis typically present late and are
therefore larger with a poorer prognosis. Treatment comprises chemotherapy, surgical
resection and/or radiotherapy. With combined treatment, patient survival has improved:
with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate is more than 60 per
cent. With localized disease, wide surgical excision of the tumour is preferred over radiotherapy if the involved bone is expendable (e.g. ﬁbular, rib), or if radiotherapy would
damage the growth plate. If there is a pathological fracture, limb salvage surgery with
the implantation of a long mega-prosthesis is the preferred option.
Non-metastatic disease survival rates are 55–70 per cent, compared to 22–33 per cent
for metastatic disease. Patients require careful follow-up owing to the risk of developing
osteosarcoma following radiotherapy, particularly in children in whom it can occur in up
to 20 per cent of cases. A European study of 359 patients with non-metastatic Ewing’s
sarcoma revealed that the following factors are associated with a poor prognosis:
•
•
•
•
•
•

14

male sex
age >12 years
anaemia
elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
radiation therapy only for local control
poor chemotherapeutic course.

CASE 6:

A PAINFUL COLLARBONE

History
A 25-year-old triathlete fell from his cycle while training and landed on his left shoulder.
He was wearing a helmet. When he tried to pick up his cycle he felt severe pain in his left
collarbone and was unable to pick up the machine. He has presented to the emergency
department.
Examination
The man has some swelling and deformity in the region of the middle of the collarbone.
On palpation he feels pain and tenderness over the left collarbone. The upper ribs are
not tender. The overlying skin is intact, and there is no evidence of any neurological or
vascular deﬁcit of either arm. A radiograph is shown in Fig. 6.1.

ANSWER 6
The diagnosis is a fractured clavicle. This is a common fracture following direct trauma.
Anatomically, the acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments attach the clavicle to
the scapula laterally. The sternoclavicular and the costoclavicular ligaments anchor the
clavicle medially. The sternocleidomastoid and the subclavius muscles also have points
of attachment to the clavicle. The clavicle also protects the adjacent brachial plexus, lung
and blood vessels.
The most popular classiﬁcation divides the clavicle into thirds: medial, middle and lateral.
This case is a middle-third fracture.
Medial-third injuries are rare and account for only 5 per cent of clavicle fractures because
very strong forces are required to cause fracture in this area. They may be associated with
intrathoracic injuries or the development of late complications, such as arthritis.
Middle-third fractures occur medial to the coracoclavicular ligament, at the junction of
the middle and outer thirds of the clavicle. The usual mechanism of injury involves a
direct force applied to the lateral aspect of the shoulder. Most middle-third fractures in
both adults and children will heal without surgical intervention. The medial fragment
displaces upwards due to the pull of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The lateral fragment
displaces downwards due to the weight of the limb.
Lateral-third fractures account for 10–15 per cent of clavicle fractures and may go on
to non-union. These fractures result from a direct blow to the top of the shoulder. They
occur distal to the coracoclavicular ligament and are classiﬁed further into three subtypes.
Type 1 fractures are undisplaced, and the coracoclavicular ligaments remain intact. Type
2 fractures are displaced, and there is associated rupture of the coracoclavicular ligament
with the proximal clavicular segment typically pulled upward by the sternocleidomastoid
muscle. Type 3 injuries involve the articular surface of the acromioclavicular joint.
Appropriate imaging views are anteroposterior and beam-angled 30 degrees cephalad. A
thorough assessment to exclude the presence of a scapular fracture should be made. In
the presence of a scapular fracture as well as a clavicle fracture, this would represent a
ﬂoating shoulder.
Most undisplaced mid-shaft fractures are treated non-operatively. Union usually occurs
and produces prominent callus. A broad arm sling for 2–6 weeks is commonly recommended. Patients should be advised to discard the sling once the acute pain settles,
encouraging shoulder range of motion and normal activities as comfort allows. However,
distal clavicle fractures have a higher incidence of non-union. The majority of these
are asymptomatic and a few will be severe enough to require ﬁxation. Shortening of
1.5–2 cm may lead to residual symptoms related to the shoulder and unsatisfactory
outcome.
Operative treatment should be considered in adults with signiﬁcantly displaced, highenergy, multi-fragmentary, shortened mid-shaft fractures (>1.5–2 cm), vertical fragment,
open fracture, or when the skin is imminently threatened, associated ﬂoating shoulder
and neurovascular compromise. With surgery, consider ﬁxation with a contoured plate
and screws. Plate removal following union may be necessary if the plate is prominent.
Contact sport should be avoided until the bone healing is solid.

CASE 7: A PAINFUL PROXIMAL HUMERUS IN AN ELDERLY WOMAN
History
An 85-year-old woman suffered a fall while shopping in icy conditions in winter. She
landed on her shoulder. Immediately she complained of severe pain and suspected her
shoulder was starting to swell. She has been taken to the local emergency department,
where she continues to complain of severe pain in her right shoulder. She has a past
medical history of hypertension treated with bendroﬂumethiazide, but has been otherwise
well.
Examination
There is a large bruise and swelling over the right shoulder, extending down to the proximal one-third of the humerus, as well as tenderness to palpation over the right shoulder
girdle. She can hardly move her right arm because of the pain. There is no neurovascular
deﬁcit. Radiographs are shown in Figs 7.1and 7.2.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 7
This is a fracture of the proximal humerus. The X-rays show displacement of the greater
tuberosity and the surgical neck of humerus. The humeral head is not dislocated. This is
a typical fracture pattern in an elderly woman with osteoporosis. Swelling and tenderness
to palpation are typically present. Bruising extending along the arm distally and along
the chest wall is often present a few days following injury.
The proximal humerus consists of four bony parts: humeral head (articular surface),
greater tuberosity, lesser tuberosity and the humeral diaphysis. Radiographs should
include anteroposterior, lateral and axillary views, and often a CT reconstruction scan to
assess the fragments involved.
Fracture stability can be assessed by placing one hand on the humeral head while gently
rotating the humeral shaft internally and externally. If the proximal and distal fragments
move as a unit, the fracture is considered stable.
A neurovascular examination is essential owing to the proximity of the brachial plexus
and axillary artery. The incidence of neurovascular injury is increased in fracture dislocations. The axillary nerve is most commonly injured.
Indications for open or closed reduction and internal ﬁxation are related to the fracture
pattern, the quality of the bone, the status of the rotator cuff, and the age and activity
level of the patient. The goal of reduction and ﬁxation of a proximal humeral fracture
is to obtain nearly anatomical reduction and stable ﬁxation to allow an early range of
motion. Undisplaced fractures are treated conservatively.
Most of the displaced one- or two-part fractures are treated with closed reduction and
pin ﬁxation or open reduction and internal ﬁxation. The treatment options for threepart proximal humerus fractures include proximal humeral plate and screws or proximal
humeral intramedullary nail. The preferred treatment of four-part fractures is humeral
head replacement if ﬁxation with a plate and screws is not possible. This is primarily
because of the high risk of osteonecrosis and secondarily because of the difﬁculty in
obtaining secure internal ﬁxation.
KEY POINTS

• The incidence of neurovascular injury is increased in fracture dislocations of the
proximal humerus.

• The axillary nerve is most commonly injured.
• Blood supply to the humerus is predominantly via the anterior humeral circumflex
artery.

• Muscle attachments when a fracture occurs produce deforming forces.
• Treatment options include conservative, open reduction and internal fixation and
hemiarthroplasty.

CASE 8:

A BOY WITH A PAINFUL ELBOW

History
A 7-year-old boy fell from his bicycle and described landing on his outstretched right
arm in abduction with the elbow in extension. He complained immediately of severe pain
around the right elbow, but no other parts of his body were painful. He has presented to
the emergency department.
Examination
Inspection of his right elbow reveals some swelling. On palpation of the elbow, he has
most tenderness across the lateral aspect of his distal right humerus. This tenderness is
associated with a signiﬁcant reduced range of motion of the elbow ﬂexion and extension.
He has no neurovascular deﬁcit of the arm. A radiograph is shown in Fig. 8.1.

Figure 8.1

23

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 8
This boy has a fracture of the lateral condyle of the humerus. The fracture line extends
from the diaphysis and epiphysis which communicate through the growth plate. The lateral condyle fracture is a Salter–Harris type IV pattern. These fractures most commonly
occur at ages between 6 and 10 years.
Fractures of the lateral condyle of the humerus are unstable. The distal humerus is predominantly cartilage at this age and knowledge of the secondary centres of ossiﬁcation
is helpful to understand the fracture patterns. Fractures therefore often appear subtle on
the radiographs because most of the fracture line courses through the cartilage and is not
seen on plain radiographs.
Milch in 1956 classiﬁed these lateral humeral condyle fractures as types I and II. These
subgroups are based on the location of the fracture line. A Milch type I fracture exits
through the ossiﬁcation centre of the lateral condyle and exits at the radiocapitellar
groove. This pattern is least common. A Milch type II fracture extends into the apex of
the trochlea, which produces elbow instability, and is the more common fracture pattern.
In this case, the fracture has a tendency to dislocate laterally and so should be treated
surgically.
Lateral condyle fractures with less than 2 mm of displacement may be treated with immobilization in an above-elbow plaster for approximately 3 weeks followed by gentle mobilization. Close follow-up is necessary to look out for fracture displacement. Operative
management is essential for all displaced fractures, as in the present case. An arthrogram
assesses the size of the cartilaginous fragment and the degree of articular displacement
which can help in decision-making in difﬁcult cases. Fragment stabilization is most
frequently performed using two percutaneously placed smooth Kirschner wires (k-wires).
If the fracture is grossly unstable, open reduction and stabilization with wires may be
necessary. Care must be taken during the exposure to avoid denuding the blood supply to
the lateral condyle from the posterior soft-tissue structure. Following ﬁxation, an aboveelbow plaster is applied with the forearm in supination. At 3–4 weeks, the k-wires are
removed and follow-up scheduled at 6 weeks for further X-rays. A return to full activity
is allowed once the fracture has united radiographically.
KEY POINTS

• Humeral condyle fractures occur most commonly between 6 and 10 years of age. The
distal humerus is predominantly cartilage at this stage of development.

• Fractures often appear subtle on radiographs.
• Displacement of less than 2 mm can be treated with immobilization in a cast.
Operative management is essential for all other displaced fractures.

• Monitor growth radiographically up to skeletal maturity.

CASE 9:

A PAINFUL DISTAL RADIUS FOLLOWING A FALL

History
An 85-year-old woman was walking her dog in the early morning. She slipped on ice
and fell, landing directly on her outstretched hand. She immediately felt a crack in her
wrist and then pain. She noticed some swelling appear around the distal radius and experienced some pins and needles in her thumb, index ﬁnger and middle ﬁnger. She called
for help and has been taken to the emergency department for assessment.
Examination
This elderly woman’s wrist reveals marked swelling. The distal radius appears to have a
dinner-fork type deformity. On palpation of the wrist, she has severe tenderness of the
distal radius. She is very reluctant to move her wrist in any direction because of the pain.
Assessment of her sensation reveals altered sensation in her thumb and index and middle
ﬁngers, but she is still able to move her thumb. The radius and ulna pulses are palpable.
A radiograph is shown in Fig. 9.1.

25

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 9
The X-ray shows an extra-articular fracture of the distal radius. There is some dorsal
angulation of the distal fragment and radial shortening. The diagnosis is thus a distal
radius fracture.
These injuries were ﬁrst described by an Irish surgeon, Abraham Colles, in 1814, and are
commonly called Colles’ fractures. His description was based on clinical examination
alone because X-rays had not been invented. Distal radius fractures are the most common fractures. Colles’ fractures account for over 90 per cent of distal radius fractures.
Any injury to the median nerve can produce paraesthesia in the thumb, index ﬁnger, and
middle and radial border of the ring ﬁnger – as in this case.
There is a bimodal age distribution of fractures to the distal radius with two peaks occurring. The ﬁrst peak occurs in people aged 18–25 years, and a second peak in older people
(>65 years). High-energy injuries are more common in the younger group and low-energy
injuries in the older group. Osteoporosis may play a role in the occurrence of this later
fracture. In the group of patients between 60 and 69 years, women far outnumber men.
Broadly, distal radius fractures can be classiﬁed as intra-articular or extra-articular.
Eponyms have been added to the various sub-classiﬁcations, examples being Smith fractures, Barton fractures and volar Barton fractures.
Management aims to restore the patient’s functioning to the pre-injury level. This can
be achieved by restoration of the radial shortening, radial inclination and dorsal angulation. Assessment with plain radiographs is all that is needed for most fractures. CT scans,
however, are useful for evaluating the articular fracture lines and degree of comminution,
and they are sometimes useful for planning the surgical approach.
The majority of distal radius fractures can be treated conservatively. With fractures
that are minimally displaced, a forearm cast is worn for 6 weeks. Note that elderly,
low-activity patients can have satisfactory function even with a signiﬁcantly displaced
fracture, although they may have a residual dinner-fork wrist deformity (due to a
prominent ulna head) that has limited supination and ﬂexion.
Most surgeons would not accept more than 2 mm of intra-articular step-off, not more
than 10 degrees of dorsal tilt (although some surgeons only accept no more than neutral)
and 2 mm of radial shortening. Shortening of more than 2 mm doubles the load through
the triangular ﬁbrocartilage and the ulna. The surgical options include ﬁxation with percutaneous wires, open reduction and internal ﬁxation, or external ﬁxators.

A PAINFUL THUMB FOLLOWING A FALL

History
A 22-year-old man was on a skiing holiday when he accidentally landed on the ground

base of his thumb following a valgus force being placed onto his abducted metacarpophalangeal joint. He has attended the local hospital for assessment.
Examination
He has some swelling at the base of his thumb. On palpation he complains of tenderness
over his thumb carpometacarpal joint, particularly over the ulnar border. He demonstrates
reduced range of movement in his thumb. A radiograph is shown in Fig. 10.1.

• What is a Stener lesion?

27

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 10
The diagnosis is ‘gamekeeper’s thumb’ because the valgus force placed onto the abducted
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint leads to an ulnar collateral ligament injury (UCL).
Campbell originally coined the term ‘gamekeeper’s thumb’ in 1955, because this condition
was most commonly associated with Scottish gamekeepers. This injury results in instability, pain and weakness of the pinch grasp. To assess for instability the thumb should be
examined by placing it in 30-degree ﬂexion and tested for valgus instability.
The UCL originates from the metacarpal head and inserts into the medial aspect and base
of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. Occasionally, when the UCL is strained, it avulses
the bone at its insertion and leads to a gamekeeper’s fracture. Although a gamekeeper’s
fracture is a contraindication to stress testing, an undisplaced avulsion fracture is not. If
the patient’s pain is severe, the joint may be anaesthetized locally with an injection. A
laxity of 30 degrees, or one that is 15 degrees more than on the uninjured side, represents
a ruptured collateral ligament in this position. If valgus laxity of the MCP joint is present
in both the ﬂexed and extended positions, complete UCL rupture should be suspected.
Ultrasound is 92 per cent sensitive for UCL ruptures and provides a positive predictive
value of 99 per cent.
A Stener lesion occurs when the adductor aponeurosis becomes interposed between the
ruptured UCL and its site of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. The distal
portion of the ligament retracts and points superﬁcially and proximally. A rupture of the
proper and accessory collateral ligaments must occur for this injury to happen. The UCL
therefore no longer contacts its area of insertion and cannot heal. Occasionally, the UCL
avulses a small portion of the proximal phalanx at its insertion, leading to a gamekeeper’s
fracture.
Non-surgical treatment can be considered for partial tears of the UCL; that is, grade I or
grade II tears as in this case. The thumb is immobilized in a spica-type cast for 4 weeks.
The cast should be well-moulded around the MCP joint, and the interphalangeal (IP) joint
can be left free. If the fragment is displaced by less than 2 mm, non-surgical management is indicated. For greater displacement, the fracture should be opened and reduced.
Complete ulnar collateral ligament tears require surgical repair.
KEY POINTS

• A valgus force placed on an MCP joint leads to an ulnar collateral ligament injury.
• A Stener lesion occurs when the adductor aponeurosis becomes interposed between
the ruptured UCL and its site of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx.

• Ultrasound is 92 per cent sensitive for UCL ruptures.
• Non-surgical treatment can be considered for partial tears. For greater displacement,
the fracture should be opened and reduced.

A PAINFUL HIP FOLLOWING A FALL

History
A 72-year-old woman tripped, fell and landed on her left hip. She reported pain in her
proximal thigh and was unable to bear weight. An ambulance was called and she has
been taken to the emergency department.
Examination
This elderly woman is in some obvious pain which appears to be arising from her hip. She
has evidence of shortening of the left leg and the leg is lying in external rotation. There
is signiﬁcant swelling and tenderness to palpation in the proximal thigh region. This is
a closed injury and she has no neurovascular deﬁcit. A radiograph is shown in Fig. 11.1.

injury.
• How would you manage this type of injury?

29

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 11
The diagnosis is a subtrochanteric fracture, because the fracture seen on the anteroposterior X-ray is below the level of the lesser trochanter. Subtrochanteric fractures account
for about 10–30 per cent of all hip fractures. These fractures typically are seen in two
patient groups: older osteopenic patients after a low-energy fall, and younger patients
involved in high-energy trauma.
In the older group, falls are the most frequent mechanism of injury. Importantly, this
age group is particularly susceptible to metastatic disease that can lead to pathological
fractures.
The subtrochanteric region of the femur, arbitrarily designated as the region between the
lesser trochanter and a point 5 cm distal, consists predominantly of cortical bone. During
normal activities of daily living, up to six times the bodyweight is transmitted across
the subtrochanteric region of the femur. The lesser trochanter is posteromedial, and it is
the point of insertion for the psoas and iliacus tendons. The femoral shaft has both an
anterior and a lateral bow. The major muscles that surround the hip create signiﬁcant
forces that contribute to fracture deformity. The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus
tendons attach to the greater trochanter and abduct the proximal fragment. The psoas and
iliacus attach to the lesser trochanter and ﬂex the proximal fragment – as in this case.
The adductors pull the distal fragment medially.
Intramedullary nails are emerging as the treatment of choice for subtrochanteric femur
fractures. For some fractures with extension above the lesser trochanter, a ﬁxed-angle
device such as a blade-plate or dynamic condylar screw can be considered as surgical
options. In the presence of pathological fractures, prophylactic stabilization of the entire
femur may be indicated to prevent problems with multiple metastases in the same bone.
KEY POINTS

• There are two patient groups, namely older osteopenic patients after a low-energy fall
and younger patients involved in high-energy trauma.

• The subtrochanteric region is between the lesser trochanter and a point 5 cm distal.
• Intramedullary nails are emerging as the treatment of choice.

• What is the diagnosis?
• Which radiographs would you request for this injury?
• What are the principles of management of this kind of injury?

31

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 12
The diagnosis is a supracondylar femoral fracture. The anteroposterior and lateral X-rays
show multiple fracture lines within the distal femur consistent with a shortened and
displaced fracture. These injuries make up 6 per cent of all femoral fractures. There is
a bimodal distribution of fractures based on age and gender. Most high-energy distal
femur fractures occur in males aged between 15 and 50 years, while most low-energy
fractures occur in osteoporotic women aged 50 or above. The most common high-energy
mechanism of injury is a road trafﬁc accident (RTA), and the most common low-energy
mechanism is a fall.
Depending on the mechanism of injury, radiographic evaluation of distal femur fractures
may include orthogonal plain radiographs of the entire length of the femur to avoid
missing ipsilateral femoral neck or shaft fractures. True knee radiographs are required
to screen for intra-articular extension of fracture lines. If intra-articular extension is
suspected – particularly coronal plane fractures which can be difﬁcult to see on plain
X-rays – a CT scan may be helpful in planning treatment.
In general, however, non-operative treatment does not work well for displaced fractures.
With this patient, operative treatment is indicated. Operative intervention is also indicated in the presence of open fractures and injuries associated with vascular injury. The
aim of surgery is to achieve anatomical reduction of the joint surface with stable ﬁxation,
restoration of limb alignment, and early postoperative movement of the knee joint. This
patient should have an open reduction and internal ﬁxation with a plate and screws.
Multiple options exist for the deﬁnitive treatment of distal femur fractures. They include
external ﬁxation (for patients with open fractures and bone loss, vascular injury, associated signiﬁcant soft-tissue injuries, or extensive comminution), intramedullary nailing
(for fractures with enough intact distal femur to allow for interlocking screw ﬁxation),
and plate osteosynthesis with either open reduction and internal ﬁxation or minimally
invasive plate osteosynthesis. Likewise, multiple plating options are available and include
conventional buttress plates, ﬁxed-angle devices, and locking plates. Locked implants
are typically indicated in patients with osteoporosis, fractures with metaphyseal comminution where the medial cortex cannot be restored, or a short articular segment. Total
knee replacement is effective in elderly patients with articular fractures and signiﬁcant
osteoporosis, or pre-existing arthritis that is not amenable to open reduction and internal
ﬁxation.
Low-demand elderly patients with non- or minimally displaced fractures can be managed conservatively. The techniques comprise either skeletal traction or initial splinting
and mobilization with limited weight-bearing and eventual progression to either a cast
or functional brace. Radiographs should be obtained at weekly to bi-weekly intervals for
the ﬁrst 6 weeks to ensure that the fracture reduction is maintained. The patient should
gradually progress to weight-bearing, and joint mobilization should be allowed based on
the clinical and radiographic progression of fracture healing. In general, this fracture can
take a minimum of 3–4 months to unite.

KEY POINTS

• High-energy distal femur fractures occur in males aged between 15 and 50 years. Most
low-energy fractures occur in osteoporotic women over the age of 50 years.

Examination
The elbow is markedly swollen and tender in the distal humerus both medially and

35

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 13
This young girl has sustained a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. In children this
type of fracture remains extra-articular. There are two types of supracondylar fracture:
the extension type (95 per cent) and the ﬂexion type (5 per cent). The pattern of the fracture occurs with failure of the anterior cortex ﬁrst, followed by posterior displacement of
the distal fragment. For the extension type injury, Gartland in 1959 classiﬁed the injury
into three types: type I is undisplaced; type II is displaced with the posterior hinge intact;
and type III is completely displaced with no periosteal attachment – as in this case.
A detailed history is necessary to understand the mechanism of injury. A fall onto an
outstretched hand may lead to an extension-type fracture, whereas a fall onto the elbow
can result in a ﬂexion supracondylar fracture. Prior to the treatment of supracondylar
fractures, it is essential to identify the type.
Examination of the degree of swelling and deformity as well as a neurological and vascular status assessment of the forearm is essential. A vascular injury may present with
signs of an acute compartment syndrome with pain, paraesthesia, pallor, and pulseless
and tight forearm. Injury to the brachial artery may present with loss of the distal
pulse. However, in the presence of a weak distal pulse, major vessel injury may still be
present owing to the collateral circulation. The most common nerve to sustain injury
is the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve (ask the child to make a circle
with the thumb and the index ﬁnger: known as the ‘okay sign’). The radial, median and
ulnar nerves are injured less commonly. The latter may be injured while trying to ﬁx the
fracture during insertion of the medial pin. Finally, assess the distal radius for fractures,
reported to occur in 5–6 per cent of cases.
Treatment of a type I injury is symptomatic in minimally displaced fractures. Flex the
elbow just past 90 degrees and immobilize in a collar and cuff and/or back-slab for 3–4
weeks.
Treatment of a type II injury involves a general anaesthetic. The aim of the manipulation
of the fracture is to correct the angulation in the frontal and sagittal planes. The reduction technique comprises elbow pronation and ﬂexion. The arm should be immobilized in
pronation and elbow ﬂexion not exceeding 120 degrees. With the elbow ﬂexed beyond
90 degrees the injury should be stable due to an intact posterior periosteal hinge. If the
swelling prohibits elbow ﬂexion to 90 degrees, or if excessive ﬂexion is necessary to
maintain reduction, then ﬁxation with wires may be necessary to maintain reduction.
Gartland type II fractures have been subdivided into two types: IIA and IIB. Type IIA have
posterior angulation with an intact posterior cortex/hinge with no rotational deformity;
type IIB have some degree of rotational deformity. Type IIB fractures tend to be less stable
and may require ﬁxation with wires.
Treatment of a type III injury is more complicated. The posterior cortex is disrupted with
no cortical contact and the distal fragment is displaced posteriorly and proximally (by the
pull of the triceps). If the fracture has medial displacement, the medial periosteal hinge
is usually intact. If the fracture has lateral displacement, the lateral periosteal hinge is
intact. Completely displaced fractures with no posterior intact hinge/cortex are unstable
and require some form of wire ﬁxation. Open reduction is indicated for difﬁcult closed
reduction, particularly when the brachialis muscle has button-holed though the proximal
fragment.
Complications associated with this injury include neurovascular compromise and malunion. A nerve injury may be traumatic at the time of the injury or be iatrogenic during
36

Orthopaedics

reduction and ﬁxation. Vascular insult can lead to Volkmann ischaemic contracture of
the forearm. If a vascular injury is detected early, open reduction of the fracture and a
vascular repair may be necessary. Malunion of the fracture may lead to cubitus varus
deformity.
KEY POINTS

• There are two types of supracondylar fracture: the extension type (most common) and
the flexion type.

• A fall onto an outstretched hand may lead to an extension-type fracture whereas a fall
onto the elbow produces a flexion supracondylar fracture.

• Examination of the degree of swelling and deformity as well as an assessment of
neurological and vascular status of the forearm is essential.

• The nerve most commonly injured is the anterior interosseous branch of the median

• Treatment of undisplaced fractures comprises collar and cuff or an above-elbow
plaster. Treatment of displaced fractures comprises manipulation under anaesthetic and
stabilization with plaster and/or wires.

CASE 14:

A PAINFUL THIGH FOLLOWING A VIOLENT FALL

History
A 30-year-old motorcyclist was knocked from his machine by a car and landed on the
road. He complained immediately of pain in his right thigh and was unable to bear
weight through his leg. He did not appear to have any other injuries. The car driver
called an ambulance and the injured man has been taken to the emergency department
on a stretcher.
Examination
Following a thorough assessment of head, neck, chest, pelvis and spine, it is clear that the
motorcyclist has sustained an isolated injury to his femur. He has a swollen right thigh.
The thigh is very tender and the patient is unable to move the leg because of pain. There
are no obvious neurological or vascular deﬁcits to the leg. The patient’s breathing was
noted to be fast at 30/min. Oxygen saturation is only 89 per cent on air. Radiographs are
shown in Figs 14.1 and 14.2.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 14
The diagnosis is a fracture of the femoral shaft. The X-rays show signiﬁcant shortening
and displacement.
These types of fracture are usually caused by direct, high-energy forces, and may be
life-threatening. Isolated fractures can occur with repetitive stress and in the presence of
metabolic bone disorders, or primary or secondary bone tumours. The area most susceptible to stress fracture is the medial junction of the proximal and middle third of the femur,
which occurs as a result of the compression forces on the medial femur. Stress fractures
can also occur on the lateral aspect of the femoral neck in areas of distraction and are
less likely to heal non-operatively compared to compression-sided stress fractures.
One of the risks following a femoral shaft fracture is fat embolism leading to respiratory compromise – which would account for this patient’s increased respiratory rate and
hypoxia.
Femoral fracture patterns vary according to the mechanism of injury. The fracture
depends on the direction of the force applied and the quantity of the energy absorbed.
A perpendicular force results in a transverse fracture pattern, an axial force may injure
the hip or knee, and rotational forces may cause spiral or oblique fracture patterns. The
amount of comminution present depends on the amount of energy absorbed by the
femur at the time of injury. The degree of translation, angulation and rotation depends
on the deforming muscle forces. Proximally, the gluteus medius and minimus attach to
the greater trochanter, resulting in abduction of the femur with fracture. The iliopsoas
attaches to the lesser trochanter, resulting in internal rotation and external rotation with
fractures. Distally, the large adductor muscle mass attaches medially, resulting in an
apex lateral deformity with fractures. The medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius
attach over the posterior femoral condyles, resulting in ﬂexion deformity in distal-third
fractures.
Appropriate resuscitation of the patient is necessary prior to any deﬁnitive surgery. The
femur is very vascular, so fractures can result in 2–3 units of blood loss into the thigh.
This is an essential part of resuscitation, particularly in elderly individuals who have less
cardiac reserve. Patients should be monitored for fat embolism syndrome and kept well
hydrated and oxygenated – as in this case as the man has a raised respiratory rate and
hypoxia.
The majority of femoral shaft fractures are treated surgically with intramedullary nails
or plate ﬁxation. However, if the patient is haemodynamically unstable and has not
been adequately resuscitated, femoral ﬁxation should be delayed and temporized with
an external ﬁxator or skeletal traction. Plate ﬁxation may be used when femoral fractures are associated with vascular injury that requires repair or with ipsilateral femoral
neck fractures. The aim of treatment is to restore the length, alignment and rotation of
the bone as soon as possible. The majority of femoral shaft fractures are united by 3–5
months.
KEY POINTS

• Following a femoral shaft fracture, fat embolism can lead to respiratory compromise.
• Femoral shaft fractures can result in up to 2–3 units of blood loss.
• The majority of femoral shaft fractures are treated surgically with intramedullary nails
or plate fixation, following adequate resuscitation.

CASE 15:

GROIN PAIN FOLLOWING A FALL

History
A 79-year-old woman has presented to the emergency department after a fall. She has
been lying on a hard ﬂoor for over 6 hours before she managed to call an ambulance.
She complains of pain in the groin and inability to bear weight on the affected side. She
is on warfarin for atrial ﬁbrillation. Her mental test score is 10 out of 10. She previously
walked short distances with the aid of one stick.
Examination
The affected leg has shortening and external rotation, and she is unable to actively move
her hip due to the pain. A radiograph is shown in Fig. 15.1.

• How would you manage a patient with an extracapsular fracture of their proximal
femur?

41

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 15
The diagnosis is a fractured neck of femur. The leg is short, externally rotated and she
is unable to bear weight, and the X-ray shows a displaced intracapsular fracture of the
proximal femur.
Hip fractures are the most common reason for admission to an orthopaedic ward, usually
caused by a fall by an elderly person. The average age of a person with a hip fracture is
77 years. Mortality is high: about 10 per cent of people with a hip fracture die within 1
month, and about one-third within 12 months. However, fewer than half of deaths are
attributable to the fracture, reﬂecting the high prevalence of comorbidity. The mental
status of the patient is also important: senility is associated with a three-fold increased
risk of sepsis and dislocation of prosthetic replacement when compared with mentally
alert patients. The one-year mortality rate in these patients is considerable, being reported
as high as 50 per cent.
MRI is the investigation of choice where there is doubt about the diagnosis. If MRI is not
available or not feasible, a radioisotope bone scan or repeat plain radiographs (after an
interval of 24–48 hours) should be performed.
Garden’s classiﬁcation is the most widely accepted for grading a fractured neck of femur
(see the box). The present case is stage IV.
The blood supply to the proximal end of the femur is divided into three major groups.
• The ﬁrst is the extracapsular arterial ring located at the base of the femoral neck.
• The second is the ascending cervical branches of the arterial ring on the surface of
the femoral neck.
• The third is the arteries of the ligamentum teres.
A large branch of the medial femoral circumﬂex artery forms the extracapsular arterial
ring posteriorly and anteriorly by a branch from the lateral femoral circumﬂex artery. The
ascending cervical branches ascend on the surface of the femoral neck anteriorly along
the intertrochanteric line. Posteriorly, the cervical branches run under the synovial reﬂection towards the rim of the articular cartilage, which demarcates the femoral neck from
its head. The lateral vessels are the most vulnerable to injury in femoral neck fractures.
Management of this patient should follow the national recommended guidelines. An early
assessment in the emergency department or ward should include a formal assessment of
the pressure sore risk, hydration and nutrition, ﬂuid balance, pain, core body temperature, continence, coexisting medical problems, mental state, previous mobility, previous
functional ability, social circumstances and whether the patient has a carer.
This patient had been lying on a hard ﬂoor for 6 hours and is deemed to be at high risk
of pressure sores. She should be nursed on a large-cell alternating-pressure air mattress
or comparable pressure-reducing surface. Soft-tissue surfaces should be used to protect
the heel and sacrum from pressure damage. The patient should be kept warm, be provided
with adequate analgesia and early assessment and correction of any ﬂuid and electrolyte
disturbances.
Ideally during the preoperative period the patient should be managed on an orthopaedic
ward with orthogeriatric medical support. This patient is on warfarin; withholding warfarin combined with administration of oral or intravenous vitamin K is recommended
for reversal of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin to permit earlier surgery if deemed
appropriate. Where it is deemed appropriate to use it, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should
42

Orthopaedics

be used. The routine use of traction (either skin or skeletal) is not recommended prior to
surgery for a hip fracture.
Infection rates can be reduced by preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Use of chemical or
mechanical thromboprophylaxis for 28 days is recommended.
The surgical management of intracapsular fractures with undisplaced fractures should
be internal ﬁxation with hip screws. However, assessment prior to surgery should consider the patient’s mobility, mental state and pre-existing bone and joint pathology. This
patient has a displaced intracapsular hip fracture. If she were a young patient, closed
reduction and internal ﬁxation could be considered, to try to save the femoral head. If she
were a more active individual, a total hip replacement could also have been an option.
In this patient’s case, a cemented hemiarthroplasty is recommended. In the presence of
signiﬁcant cardiorespiratory disease, an uncemented hemiarthroplasty would have been
recommended.
All extracapsular fractures of the proximal femur should be treated surgically unless there
are medical contraindications. A sliding hip screw is recommended except with particular
fractures (e.g. reverse oblique, transverse or subtrochanteric features) where an intramedullary device may be considered as this will provide more biomechanical stability while
the fracture is healing.

!

Garden’s classification of femoral neck fractures

• Stage I: Incomplete/impacted fracture; medial trabeculae of the head are tilted
posterolaterally

• Stage II: Complete but undisplaced fracture; alignments of the medial trabeculae
of the neck head and acetabulum are undisturbed

• Stage III: Complete, partially displaced fracture; medial trabeculae of the head are
rotated medially

• Stage IV: Complete, fully displaced fracture; medial trabeculae of the head are
aligned with those of the acetabulum

KEY POINTS

• Fractured neck of femur is the most common cause for admission to an orthopaedic
ward. It carries a high mortality rate.

• Blood supply of the femoral head is critical in minimally displaced fractures.
• Displaced intracapsular fractures are treated with arthroplasty. Displaced extracapsular
fractures are treated with open reduction and internal fixation.

• How would you manage this injury?

45

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 16
The diagnosis is a fracture of the tibial shaft. The tibia is the most frequent site of a longbone fracture in the body. Shaft fractures are often the result of high-energy trauma, but
they can occur as a result of overuse causing a stress fracture. With a stress fracture, there
is often a history of a recent change in activity level and the pain typically increases
during weight-bearing and improves with rest.
The classiﬁcation system most widely adopted for open tibial shaft fractures is Gustilo
and Anderson’s (see the box).
Open fractures are surgical emergencies and ideally should be taken to the operating
theatre as soon as possible or put on the next available operating list. In the emergency
room, an antibiotic should be administered, plus analgesia and a splint. Careful documentation of the neurovascular status should be made. Plastic surgical expertise may be
required to provide soft-tissue coverage at the same time as stabilizing the fracture with
either an intramedullary nail or external ﬁxator.
These injuries carry risk of various complications, including infection (particularly with
open fractures), delayed union (particularly in smokers), malunion (often the tibia will
fall into varus with distal fractures and will fall into valgus with proximal fractures), and
non-union (especially in the presence of signiﬁcant periosteal striping and poor softtissue cover and signiﬁcant comminution and displacement).
Most closed tibial fractures can be treated conservatively using plaster of Paris. The knee
is typically ﬂexed to 10–15 degrees and the ankle dorsiﬂexed to neutral. Admission
to hospital may be necessary to control pain and monitor for compartment syndrome.
Follow-up radiographs should initially be frequent to assess whether satisfactory reduction has been maintained. Total cast time can be up to 3 months, with initial non-weightbearing and progressing to full weight-bearing over the period. At 6 weeks, if there is
satisfactory evidence of fracture heal, the above-knee cast can be converted to a belowknee one (patella tendon-bearing Sarmiento cast).
Tibial shaft fractures treated with casting must be monitored closely with frequent radiographs to ensure that the fracture has maintained adequate alignment. Adequate callus
formation generally takes 12 weeks before cast therapy can be discontinued.
In this patient, the displaced tibia fracture is unstable and should be ﬁxed operatively. An
unstable fracture is present when there is greater than 1.5 cm of shortening, more than
5 degrees of varus or valgus angulation, 10 degrees of anterior or posterior angulation,
and/or greater than 50 per cent translation while the leg is in a plaster. Speciﬁc factors
that contribute to instability include comminution, ﬁbular fracture and very proximal,
segmental or distal fracture. Intramedullary nailing and external ﬁxation have replaced
fracture plating because they are associated with reduced infection rates, and damage to
local soft tissues. In the majority, tibial nails are not removed and may remain in the
patient indeﬁnitely. If they cause speciﬁc problems such as anterior knee pain and the
locking screws are prominent, then either the screws alone, and in some cases the nail as
well, can be removed once the fracture has united.

49

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 17
The diagnosis is a fracture of the tibial plateau. This fracture disrupts the articular surface
of the proximal tibia and causes a haemarthosis and immediate swelling of the knee.
The peak incidence occurs in men in their fourth decade and in women in their seventh
decade. The increased incidence of tibial plateau fractures in older women is predominantly due to osteoporosis and they tend to be depression type fractures. Tibial plateau
fractures in younger patients are commonly the result of high-energy injuries and tend
to be splitting-type fractures.
Knowing the mechanism of injury is important because it may aid in determining
whether the injury was high- or low-velocity. The presence of a haemarthrosis should be
noted. Compare the knees to assess for any deformity. Gentle stress testing can be performed with the leg in extension to evaluate the stability of the ligaments. With a lateral
impact injury the medial collateral ligament may have been injured. Leg compartments
should be assessed for any evidence of a compartment syndrome. A careful neurological
examination should be performed particularly to exclude injury to the peroneal nerve.
Any concern for possible vascular injury to the popliteal artery should be aggressively
pursued with an arteriogram.
Following the clinical examination, initial anteroposterior and lateral and oblique radiographs should be obtained. When assessing the lateral radiograph, remember the lateral
plateau is convex and the medial plateau is concave. CT scans can assist in determining
the extent and location of fracture lines and depressed fragments.
There are a number of classiﬁcation systems, the most widely adopted being the Schatzker
classiﬁcation. There are six types.
• Type I is a wedge fracture of the lateral tibial plateau and is most commonly seen in
younger patients.
• Type II is a split fracture associated with depression of the lateral plateau. The underlying bone may be osteoporotic. The mechanism of injury is typically a combination
of valgus stress and axial compression force. Look out for associated injuries such as
a fracture of the ﬁbular head and neck, ligamentous injuries, particularly the medial
collateral ligament, and avulsion of bone from the medial femoral condyle.
• Type III is a pure depression fracture of the lateral tibial plateau. The ﬂexion angle of
the knee at injury determines the depth of depression.
• Type IV is a fracture of the medial tibial plateau and carries the worst prognosis of
all the tibial plateau fractures. There are two type IV injuries. The low-energy fracture
in elderly patients with osteoporotic bone can lead to signiﬁcant compression. The
high-energy fractures typically occur in younger patients and can be associated with
intercondylar eminence fracture, lateral ligament rupture and/or peroneal nerve traction injury.
• Type V is a fracture of both the medial and lateral tibial condyles. This injury occurs
with an axial force while the knee is in extension. Because these are high-energy
injuries, they may be associated with soft-tissue injuries including peripheral meniscal detachment, anterior cruciate ligament avulsions, neurovascular injuries and knee
dislocation, thereby adding to the knee instability and compartment syndrome.
• Type VI is a complex, bicondylar fracture in which the condylar fragments are separate from the diaphysis. This pattern of injury is the result of high-energy trauma.
This injury is also associated with partial or complete ruptures and/or meniscal tears.

50

Orthopaedics

Fracture displacement ranging up to 5 mm can be treated conservatively; however, a
depressed fragment greater than 5 mm should be considered for elevation and bone grafting. The goals of tibial plateau fracture treatment are to restore joint stability, alignment,
and articular congruity while preserving full range of motion. Internal ﬁxation techniques include ligamentotaxis, percutaneous ﬁxation, and antiglide techniques. When
extensive comminution and damaged soft tissues prohibit the use of internal ﬁxation,
circular external ﬁxators are an excellent fallback option for management.

patient also complains of intense pain on passive stretching of his toes. He reports some
altered sensation in the right foot compared to the left. His foot pulses are, however,

• How would you further examine, investigate and manage this patient?

53

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 18
Compartment syndrome is the diagnosis, given the history of a crushing injury, underlying tibial shaft fracture, tense compartment of the leg and pain on passive stretching. This
condition is an orthopaedic emergency and can be limb- and life-threatening.
Compartment syndrome occurs when perfusion pressure falls below tissue pressure in
a closed fascial compartment and results in microvascular compromise. At this point,
blood ﬂow through the capillaries stops. In the absence of ﬂow, oxygen delivery stops.
Hypoxic injury causes cells to release vasoactive substances (e.g. histamine, serotonin),
which increase endothelial permeability. Capillaries allow continued ﬂuid loss, which
increases tissue pressure and advances injury. Nerve conduction slows, tissue pH falls
due to anaerobic metabolism, surrounding tissue suffers further damage, and muscle tissue suffers necrosis, releasing myoglobin. In untreated cases the syndrome can lead to
permanent functional impairment, renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, and death.
Patients at risk of compartment syndrome include those with high-velocity injuries, longbone fractures, high-energy trauma, penetrating injuries such as gunshot wounds and
stabbing, and crush injuries, as well as patients on anticoagulants with trauma.
The patient usually complains of severe pain that is out of proportion to the injury. An
assessment of the affected limb may reveal swelling which feels tense, or hard compartments. Pain on passive range of movement of ﬁngers or toes of the affected limb is a
typical feature. Late signs comprise pallor, paralysis, paraesthesia and a pulseless limb.
Sensory nerves begin to lose conductive ability, followed by motor nerves. Some nerves
may reveal effects of increasing pressure before others. For example, in the anterior compartment of the lower leg the deep peroneal nerve is quickly affected, and sensation in
the web space between the ﬁrst two toes may be lost.
The development of a compartment syndrome depends on compartment pressure as well
as systemic blood pressure. The diastolic blood pressure minus the compartment pressure should be less than 30 mmHg. A formal assessment of the compartment pressure
should be performed and pressures greater than 30 mmHg are generally agreed to require
intervention.
In the present case, all the dressings and casts should be removed down to skin as it has
been shown that splitting of the underlying dressings reduces the pressure by a further
15 per cent, while complete removal of casts leads to a further reduction of 15 per cent.
The limb should be kept at the level of the heart rather than elevated, to maximize tissue perfusion. Supplementary oxygen slightly increases the partial pressure of oxygen to
the tissues. Hypovolaemia can worsen ischaemia, and intravenous hydration should be
administered.
This patient needs to go to theatre and have stabilization of his fracture. Fasciotomy is the
deﬁnitive treatment for compartment syndrome. The purpose of fasciotomy is to achieve
prompt and adequate decompression so as to restore the tissue perfusion. The surgeon
should be familiar with the visual recognition of necrotic tissue because thorough debridement reduces the potential of infection and improves the chances of tissue recovery.
Regardless of the approach used, all compartments of the leg must be thoroughly decompressed. A delay in surgery could lead to ischaemic contractures or even amputation.

54

KEY POINTS

• Compartment syndrome is an orthopaedic emergency. Perfusion pressure falls below
tissue pressure in a closed fascial compartment.

• Risk situations include high-energy trauma and crush injuries.
• The patient usually complains of severe pain that is out of proportion to the obvious
injury.

• Compartment pressure greater than 30 mmHg requires intervention. Fasciotomy is the
definitive treatment.

• Describe the blood supply to the talus.
• What are possible complications of this injury?

57

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 19
The diagnosis is a talus fracture. The lateral X-ray shows a displaced fracture through the
talar neck. The classiﬁcation of talar neck fractures was described by Hawkins in 1970.
• With type I injuries, the talar neck fracture remains undisplaced.
• With type II injuries, the talar neck fracture is displaced and the subtalar joint is subluxated or dislocated. (In the present case the talar neck is fractured but the subtalar
joint is not dislocated.)
• With type III injuries, the talar neck fracture is displaced and the body of the talus is
dislocated from both the subtalar and ankle joints. The body is usually extruded posteromedially to rest between the Achilles tendon and the posterior surface of the tibia.
• With type IV injuries, a displaced talar neck fracture is associated with dislocation of
the talar body from both the subtalar and ankle joints, and dislocation of the talar
head from the talonavicular joint.
Hawkins’s sign is the appearance of a zone of osteopenia or lucency under the subchondral bone of the talar dome.
Associated injuries are common, and frequently include the medial malleous and lumbar
spine fractures.
The middle portion of the talar body receives its blood supply from the tarsal canal artery,
which consistently arises 2 cm below the ankle from the posterior tibial artery. About
5 mm from its origin the tarsal canal artery gives off a deltoid branch, which supplies the
medial quarter of the talar body. The dorsalis pedis and peroneal arteries have branches
which anastomose to form the tarsal sinus artery. The tarsal sinus artery provides blood
to the lateral aspect of the talar body and the majority of the talar head.
With type I fractures the intraosseous vessels coursing from distal to proximal in the talar
neck are disrupted, so the avascular necrosis (AVN) rate of the talar body ranges from 0 to
10 per cent. With type II fractures, the intraosseous blood supply and the vessels coursing
inferiorly from the tarsal sinus artery are damaged (likely in the present case). The AVN
rate is 20–50 per cent. With type III fractures, the AVN rate ranges from 50 to 100 per
cent, as the intraosseous, tarsal sinus, tarsal canal and deltoid vessels are all injured. With
type IV fractures, the risk of AVN of the talar body approaches 100 per cent and damage
to the blood supply to the talar head occurs as well.
KEY POINTS

• Talus fractures occur with forced dorsiflexion injury.
• The talus has a tenuous blood supply.
• Associated injuries are common, and frequently include the medial malleolus and
lumbar spine fractures.

• Risk of avascular necrosis depends on the degree of displacement and ranges from 10
to 100 per cent.

• Hawkins’s sign is the appearance of a zone of osteopenia or lucency under the
subchondral bone of the talar dome.

59

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 20
The diagnosis is a calcaneum fracture. The most common situation leading to calcaneal
fracture is a young adult who falls from a height and lands on his or her feet. Fractures
of the os calcis are the most common tarsal fractures.
Patients often sustain occult injuries to their lumbar or cervical spine, and the proximal
femur. A thorough clinical and radiological investigation of the spine area is mandatory
in patients with calcaneal fracture.
X-rays should include anteroposterior, lateral, oblique, axial and Broden views. The AP
radiograph allows assessment of any calcaneocuboid joint involvement, talonavicular
subluxation, and lateral wall widening. AP views of the ankle are used to assess for any
subﬁbular impingement in the presence of lateral displacement of the lateral wall of the
calcaneus.
Lateral radiographs show the fracture line through the calcaneum. The lateral radiographs
of the foot are used to evaluate the Bohler angle. This angle is deﬁned by two intersecting lines. One line is drawn from the anterior process of the calcaneus to the peak of the
posterior articular surface. The second is drawn from the peak of the posterior articular
surface to the peak of the posterior tuberosity. The angle is normally between 25 and 40
degrees. In severe fractures with subtalar joint involvement, this angle may decrease or
become negative.
Oblique views show the degree of displacement of the primary fracture line and the
lesser facets. Axial views help show the primary fracture line, any varus malpositioning,
posterior facet step-off, lateral-wall displacement, and ﬁbular abutment. Broden views of
the foot are obtained by internally rotating the leg 45 degrees with the ankle in neutral
position. The beam may then be directed toward the lateral malleolus to evaluate the
posterior facet. CT scans show the degree of comminution of the posterior facet of the
calcaneum and also help with classiﬁcation and planning of treatment.
Treatment goals of operative modalities include restoration of the heel height and length,
realignment of the posterior facet of the subtalar joint, and restoration of the mechanical axis of the hindfoot either conservatively with plaster or open reduction and internal

CASE 21:

CURVATURE OF THE SPINE

History
A 14-year-old boy has been taken to his general practitioner by his parents, who noticed
that their son was developing a spine deformity. His mother says that he recently
underwent a growth spurt and his spine curvature has increased signiﬁcantly with this
spurt. The boy complains of no pain in his spine. Despite the lack of pain, the father is
concerned.
Examination
This boy has a convex right thoracic curve, as shown in Fig. 21.1. The height of the right
shoulder is higher than the left and there is a prominent shoulder blade, with asymmetrical waist creases and heights of the iliac crests. On bending forward a rib hump prominence can be observed in the thoracic region of the spine. Neurological examination of
all the limbs is normal. Radiographs are shown in Fig. 21.2.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 21
This young boy has a diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis due to the curvature of his spine.
This is the most common spinal deformity. The prevalence of scoliosis is highest in
patients aged 12–14 years. For a spinal deformity to be classiﬁed as scoliosis, both lateral (coronal plane) curvature and rotation (transverse plane) must be present – as in this
case. Lateral (coronal) curvatures of less than 10 degrees are generally not referred to as
scoliosis. The three types of idiopathic scoliosis are infantile (birth to 3 years), juvenile
(3 years to puberty) and adolescent (at or just after puberty).
The types of this condition most commonly seen are congenital, neuromuscular and nonstructural. Scoliosis is also seen in other disease processes such as neuroﬁbromatosis,
mesenchymal disease (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome), tumours, traumatic
spinal injuries, infections, spondylolisthesis and degenerative conditions.
Adam’s forward-bending test (in conjunction with the use of a scoliometer) has been
found to be an effective screening tool. Physical examination should include a baseline
assessment of posture and body contour. Shoulder asymmetry and protruding scapulae
are common. In the most common curve pattern (right thoracic), the right shoulder is consistently rotated forward and the medial border of the right scapula protrudes posteriorly.
All patients should undergo a full neurological examination, including assessment of
upper and lower limb reﬂexes as well as the abdominal reﬂexes. Look for the presence
or absence of hamstring tightness, and screening should be performed for ataxia and/or
poor balance or proprioception (the Romberg test). One or two different methods of measuring leg length will prove valuable, as a signiﬁcant percentage of patients presenting
with scoliosis have limb-length discrepancy. Palpation of the spine is usually painless.
A string test often helps to conﬁrm the diagnosis. A string ﬁtted with a small weight is
held over the C7 spinous process and allowed to drop straight down. It should normally
fall in the midline of the gluteal natal cleft. In the presence of uncompensated scoliosis,
the string will fall on one side of the natal cleft. In balanced or compensated scoliosis, the
string will fall in the midline. AP and lateral X-rays of the spine assess the deformity. To
measure the degree of curvature, the Cobb’s angle and the rib vertebral angle difference
of Mehta are used.
Genitourinary anomalies and intraspinal anomalies are associated with congenital scoliosis. An ultrasound examination of the retroperitoneum may reveal anomalies of the
kidneys and genitourinary system. MRI should be undertaken in the initial evaluation of
congenital scoliosis, even in the absence of clinical ﬁndings.
KEY POINTS

• The prevalence of scoliosis is highest in patients aged 12–14 years.
• Both lateral (coronal plane) curvature and rotation (transverse plane) must be present.
The most common curve pattern is right thoracic.

• Adam’s forward-bending test is an effective screening tool. Shoulder asymmetry and

SEVERE LOW BACK PAIN

History
A 53-year-old woman developed severe back pain while shopping. She lifted heavy bags
into her car and experienced worsening back pain as she drove home. It was difﬁcult for
her to ﬁnd a comfortable position. Later in the day she noticed that the pain was now
radiating down the back of both legs. She had no sensation in her buttocks and was having episodes of urinary incontinence. She was extremely anxious about the condition, so
her husband took her to the emergency department, where she needed assistance to get
into the building for assessment.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What causes this condition?
• How would you investigate it?
• How would you manage this patient?

63

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 22
The diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and is an orthopaedic emergency. The condition
is characterized by the red-ﬂag signs comprising low back pain, unilateral or bilateral
sciatica, saddle anaesthesia with sacral sparing, and bladder and bowel dysfunctions.
Urinary retention is the most consistent ﬁnding. Initially the patient may report difﬁculty
starting or stopping a stream of urine, and this may be followed by frank incontinence,
ﬁrst of urine and then stool.
Rectal examination often reveals poor anal tone. The urinary incontinence is secondary
to overﬂow. There may be a variable lower extremity motor and sensory loss depending
on the affected nerve roots. The reﬂexes may be present, but they are typically reduced
or absent.
The cauda eqina is below the level of the conus medullaris. Here the spinal canal is ﬁlled
with the cauda equina, which consists of motor and sensory nerve roots. Lesions can
compress the cauda equina nerve roots. Examples are large central disc prolapse, primary
or secondary metastatic disease to the spine, epidural abscess or haematoma, and trauma.
It may also be the result of surgical morbidity.
MRI is the investigation of choice. The scan also assists in the diagnosis of the primary
problem.
Urgent spinal orthopaedic or neurosurgical consultation is essential, with transfer to a
unit capable of undertaking any deﬁnitive surgery considered necessary. In the long term,
residual weakness, incontinence, impotence and/or sensory abnormalities are potential
problems if therapy is delayed. The early use of steroids is widely debated. The prognosis
improves if a deﬁnitive cause is identiﬁed and appropriate surgical spinal decompression
occurs early. Late surgical decompression produces varying results and is often associated
with a poorer outcome.
KEY POINTS

• Cauda equina syndrome is an orthopaedic emergency.
• Red-flag signs are low back pain, unilateral or bilateral sciatica, saddle anaesthesia
with sacral sparing, and bladder and bowel dysfunctions.

• Urgent spinal orthopaedic or neurosurgical consult is essential.

A CLICKY HIP IN A TODDLER

History
A 4-year-old ﬁrst-born girl has been taken by her parents to a paediatric outpatient clinic
because they are concerned about their daughter’s hips clicking, although they believe
there is no associated pain. The mother reports having the same problem when she was a
child and vaguely recalls her mother saying that she had to be put into a plaster. Like her
mother, the baby was delivered via the breech position. During the gestation, the mother
was diagnosed with oligohydramnios.
Examination
The child has no obvious distress or pain. On inspection of her hips, she has evidence of
asymmetrical skin creases. Movement of the right hip leads to a reproducible clunking. A
radiograph and clinical picture are shown in Figs 23.1 and 23.2.

65

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 23
The diagnosis is developmental dysplasia of the hips (DDH). It is characterized by asymmetrical skin creases, clunking hip, leg length discrepancy and radiographic signs. DDH
is deﬁned as abnormal growth of the hip. Affected individuals can have a hip condition
ranging from asymptomatic with only subtle radiographic signs, to mild instability, to
frank dislocation(s) with acetabular abnormality.
The risk factors are female sex, breech presentation at birth, primiparous baby, high
birthweight, family history, multiple pregnancy and oligohydramnios.
Ortolani and Barlow tests help detect unstable hips in infancy.
• The Ortolani test is performed by placing the thumb over the inner thigh and the index
ﬁnger on the greater trochanter. The hip is abducted and gentle pressure is placed over
the greater trochanter. A clunk is felt when the hip is reduced. Ortolani postulated that
a positive test was associated with reduction of the hip into the acetabulum.
• The Barlow test is performed with the hips in an adducted position and slight gentle
posterior pressure applied to the hips. A clunk should be felt as the hip subluxes out
of the acetabulum.
The Galeazzi sign can be used to detect unilateral hip dislocation. This is performed with
the patient lying supine and the hips and knees ﬂexed. Examination should demonstrate
that one leg appears shorter than the other. Although this is usually due to hip dislocation,
it is important to realize that any limb length discrepancy will result in a positive Galeazzi
sign. Limited abduction of the affected hip is also a common ﬁnding with unilateral DDH.
Additional physical examination ﬁndings for late dislocation include asymmetry of the
gluteal thigh or labral skin folds. Associated abnormalities include metatarsus adductus
and torticollis. Bilateral dislocation of the hip can be quite difﬁcult to diagnose and often
manifests as a waddling gait with hyperlordosis.
Ultrasound plays an important role in both the diagnosis and treatment of DDH. The
alpha angle is used to measure the acetabular concavity. A normal alpha angle is 60
degrees. Angles of 50–60 degrees are considered immature and require follow-up. Angles
less than 50 degrees are considered abnormal.
Early diagnosis aids in the successful treatment of DDH. The principal aim is to get the
femoral head into the acetabulum to allow for normal development of the hip joint. A
Pavlik harness is the treatment of choice for neonates with hip instability. Excessive
hip ﬂexion can lead to femoral nerve compression and inferior dislocations. Excessive
abduction should be avoided because of concern regarding the development of avascular
necrosis of the femoral head.
Infants at 6–24 months can be managed following an assessment of whether the hip is
reducible under anaesthesia and arthrography. If the hip is reducible and contained in the
hip joint, a hip spica is the treatment of choice. The cast is typically worn for 6–12 weeks
and, if the hip is found to be stable, the patient is then placed in an abduction brace.
Open reduction is the treatment of choice for a child presenting older than 2 years of age,
or for a younger child after failed closed reduction. With infants older than 3 years (as
in the present case), femoral shortening is performed instead of traction, with additional
varus osteotomy to the proximal femur, if necessary. Infants older than 4 years with
residual acetabular dysplasia should be treated with an acetabular osteotomy procedure.
Early degenerative osteoarthritis is likely to occur unless the hip is reduced.

CASE 24:

HIP AND THIGH PAIN IN A 7-YEAR-OLD BOY

History
A 7-year-old boy told his parents that he was experiencing left hip pain referred to the
thigh. This pain had been present for 4 weeks and was mild and intermittent. There was
no memory of recent trauma or infection. The boy was taken to his general practitioner
to ﬁnd out why this pain had not resolved itself.
Examination
This boy is apyrexial. Examination of his gait reveals a limp. Assessment of leg length
reveals 5 mm of leg length discrepancy. Movements of the hip reveal loss of internal
rotation and abduction. An initial blood test reveals a normal white cell count (WCC). A
radiograph is shown in Fig. 24.1.

Figure 24.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• Describe the relevant X-ray features.
• How would you manage this condition?

69

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 24
The diagnosis is Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease (LCPD) which is the name given to idiopathic
osteonecrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis of the femoral head. The leg length discrepancy can be accounted for by the collapse of the femoral head. The differential diagnosis
would be septic arthritis; however, the white cell count is normal and the patient does not
have a pyrexia, so that diagnosis is unlikely. Other diagnoses to consider include septic
hip, transient synovitis, lymphoma, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, metaphyseal dysplasia,
and slipped femoral capital epiphysis.
The aetiology of LCPD is unclear. The capital femoral epiphysis is always involved. In
15–20 per cent of patients with the disease, involvement is bilateral. Males are affected
four to ﬁve times more often than females. LCPD is most commonly seen in individuals
aged 4–8 years.
Plain X-rays of the hips and frog-leg lateral views of the affected hip are helpful in
establishing the diagnosis. There are a number of classiﬁcation systems, but there is no
agreement as to the best. In essence, ﬁve radiographic stages can be seen by plain X-ray.
Initially there is cessation of growth at the capital femoral epiphysis, with smaller femoral
head epiphysis and widening of articular space on the affected side. This is followed by
subchondral fracture; linear radiolucency within the femoral head epiphysis, resorption
of bone as can be seen in the radiograph, re-ossiﬁcation of new bone, and ﬁnally the
healed stage.
Adjunct imaging comprises a technetium-99 bone scan, or MRI which is helpful in
delineating avascular changes before they are evident on plain radiographs. Dynamic
arthrography is helpful in assessing sphericity of the femoral head and its relationship
to the acetabulum.
The goal of treatment is to avoid severe degenerative arthritis in the long term. The aim
of initial treatment in this case is to relieve weight-bearing, contain the femoral epiphysis within the acetabulum, while maintaining a range of movement. Maintaining the
femoral head and acetabular relationship may require the use of a brace or cast. Once
the healing phase has been entered, follow-up can be every 6 months. Long-term followup is required to assess the ﬁnal outcome and monitor for any secondary degenerative
changes. In patients who fail to maintain satisfactory congruency, surgical realignment
of the acetabulum and/or the proximal femur may be required.
The younger the age of onset, the more favourable the prognosis. Children older than
8–10 years tend to have a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis, typically in their fourth
or ﬁfth decade of life.
KEY POINTS

• Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease presents most commonly at ages 4–8 years.
• Features are a smaller femoral head epiphysis, widening of articular space on the
•
•

70

affected side, subchondral fracture, linear radiolucency within the femoral head
epiphysis, resorption of bone, and re-ossification of new bone.
Treatment involves relieving weight-bearing, containing the femoral epiphysis within
the acetabulum and maintaining range of movement.
The younger the age of onset, the more favourable the prognosis. There is a risk of
developing osteoarthritis later in life.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• Who is at risk of developing this condition?
• Describe the radiological findings.

71

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 25
The diagnosis is a slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE). There is a posteroinferior displacement of the proximal femoral epiphysis. This is typical in this age group. The slip
occurs between the proliferative and hypertrophic zones of the growth plate. The patient
can present with knee pain referred from the hip via the obturator nerve. Patients often
hold the affected hip in the passive external rotation position. Flexion of the hip may
lead to external rotation with minimal internal rotation – as in this case. The patient may
or may not be able to bear weight. The clinical presentation may be classiﬁed as acute,
chronic or acute-on-chronic. Symptoms such as hip or knee pain, limp and decreased
range of motion for under 3 weeks are classiﬁed as acute – as in this case. Symptoms for
longer than 3 weeks are deemed chronic. Symptoms of greater than 3 weeks’ duration but
presenting with an acute exacerbation of pain, limp, inability to bear weight or decreased
range of motion – with or without an associated traumatic episode – are described as
acute-on-chronic.
The incidence in boys is higher than in girls. SCFE typically presents between the ages
of 10 and 16 years. In general, about 20 per cent of patients have bilateral involvement
at the time of presentation. Obesity is a risk factor because it places more shear forces
around the proximal growth plate in the hip at risk. In patients younger than 10 years,
SCFE is associated with metabolic endocrine disorders (e.g. hypothyroidism, panhypopituitarism, hypogonadism, renal osteodystrophy, growth hormone abnormalities).
Anteroposterior and frog–lateral radiographs of the pelvis/hips should be obtained. Assess
for any head displacement of the femoral neck, particularly posterior and inferior, as can
be seen in this case on the frog–lateral X-ray view. In a mild case of SUFE, one may see
widening and lack of deﬁnition of the physeal plate. Klein’s line, drawn along the superior edge of the femoral neck, may not intersect with the femoral head (Trethowan’s sign)
– as in this case. There may be metaphyseal blanching, due to increased X-ray absorption caused by superimposition of the head behind the metaphysis. Bony changes of the
femoral neck and head may be indicative of chronic history of symptoms. Chronic cases
may show new bone formation on the posterior/inferior part of the femoral neck. Over
time, the superior edge of the metaphysis becomes blunted and round owing to erosion
caused by abutment against the acetabular labrum or acetabular edge.

• In SUFE there is posteroinferior displacement of the proximal femoral epiphysis.

73

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 26
This elderly patient has insidious onset and deteriorating pain in his right hip. The pain
is located in the groin and buttock and radiates to the knee.
The initial approach is to determine that the hip pain is actually arising from the hip. In
most cases the pathology from the hip joint results in groin pain that radiates to the thigh
and knee. Patients with hip pathology can sometimes present with knee pain without any
groin or thigh symptoms. Pain in the sacroiliac area or below the knee is usually due to
pathologies outside the hip joint. The absence of neurological symptoms in this case also
indicates that the pain is likely to be mechanical in nature and arising from the hip. The
history indicates that he has stiffness in the affected joint, which is causing difﬁculty in
ﬂexing the hip in order to put on shoes and socks. The most common cause of these signs
and symptoms is primary osteoarthritis of the hip joint.
In this case there has been no preceding history of trauma, so it is likely to be primary
rather than secondary osteoarthritis. Clinical signs on examination may include an
antalgic gait, positive Trendelenburg sign, unequal leg length, muscle wasting, and a
restriction of hip joint movements. In longstanding cases, patients may develop a ﬂexion
adduction external rotation deformity in the affected leg. The ﬁxed ﬂexion deformity is
elicited by Thomas’ test. Patients may have apparent or real shortening of the affected
leg with or without a pelvic tilt.
Osteoarthritis most commonly affects middle-aged and elderly patients. Any synovial
joint can develop osteoarthritis. This condition can lead to degeneration of articular cartilage and is often associated with stiffness. Osteoarthritis of the hip typically presents
with a history of pain in the buttock, groin, thigh and knee.
The most common cause of osteoarthritis is idiopathic. Genetic factors play a strong role
in the development of primary osteoarthritis. If there is a predisposing condition that
leads to destruction of the hip joint cartilage, it is called secondary osteoarthritis. Though
the clinical features of secondary osteoarthritis are similar to its primary counterpart,
they tend to affect younger patients. The common causes of secondary arthritis in the
hip joint include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

developmental dysplasia of the hip
septic arthritis of the hip
Perthes’ disease
slipped capital femoral epiphysis
rheumatoid arthritis
seronegative arthropathy
trauma
crystal arthropathy
avascular necrosis of the femoral head.

The principal radiological investigation to evaluate osteoarthritis of the hip is an anteroposterior standing hip X-ray and lateral view of the affected hip. The four classical radiological signs of osteoarthritis are (mnemonic LOSS):
•
•
•
•

74

(L)oss of joint space
(O)steophytes (bony spurs)
(S)ubchondral cysts on acetabular and femoral sides
(S)ubchondral sclerosis on acetabular and femoral sides.

Orthopaedics

In severe cases, deformity or ﬂattening of the femoral head can be seen.
The management of osteoarthritis is conservative initially, including patient education
and modiﬁcation of lifestyle, regular analgesia, possibly non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDS), the use of a walking stick on the contralateral side, weight reduction,
and physiotherapy.
When conservative measures fail to improve or alleviate the symptoms and the individual’s sleep and quality of life are affected, surgery should be considered.
• Arthroplasty (total hip replacement) is now the treatment of choice in patients with
osteoarthritis of the hip. The principal beneﬁts are pain relief, improved mobility and
correction of deformity. The risks include infection, dislocation, loosening of the joint,
leg vein thrombosis, periprosthetic fracture, leg length discrepancy and neurovascular
injury.
• Osteotomy of the proximal femur and/or acetabulum is indicated less commomly in
younger individuals with early arthritis and a good range of movement. The osteotomy aims to optimize the alignment of the hip joint to provide symptomatic relief.
• Arthrodesis is indicated in rare cases. This involves surgical fusion of the hip joint
ultimately providing symptomatic relief in young patients with advanced arthritis and
reduced mobility. However, individuals usually develop spine and knee pain over the
years and a conversion of the arthrodesis to a total hip replacement is then indicated.
• In a salvage situation, an excision arthroplasty (Girdlestone’s excision arthroplasty)
may be indicated. This involves excision of the femoral head.
KEY POINTS

• Osteoarthritis of the hip presents with pain located in the groin/buttock and/or
radiating to the knee.

• Clinical signs are an antalgic gait, positive Trendelenburg sign, unequal leg length,
muscle wasting, and a restriction of hip joint movements.

• It most commonly affects middle-aged and elderly individuals.
• Imaging should be an anteroposterior standing hip X-ray and a lateral view of the
affected hip.

• Management is initially conservative. Surgery includes total joint replacement.

Figure 27.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?

77

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 27
The diagnosis is trochanteric bursitis which typically produces lateral hip pain that is
tender to palpation – as in this case. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is now
being commonly substituted for the term trochanteric bursitis.
Trochanteric bursitis refers speciﬁcally to inﬂammation of the trochanteric bursa. The
bursa functions normally to minimize friction between the greater trochanter and
the iliotibial band, which passes over the bursa with various degrees of hip ﬂexion.
Variations in anatomy, such as a broad pelvis, or excessive repetitive contact between the
greater trochanter and a tight iliotibial band such as in runners may result in irritation
of the bursa and generate pain. Patients typically will have tenderness over the greater
trochanter with direct palpation. Pain may radiate down the lateral aspect of the thigh.
Generally, if a patient has point tenderness over the greater trochanter, this is suggestive
of greater trochanteric bursitis. Bursal swelling may be present, but this may be difﬁcult
to appreciate in many patients. Lateral hip pain can be reproduced with ﬂexion of the hip
followed by resisted hip abduction. Trochanteric bursitis seems to be much more common
in females than in males. MRI and ultrasonographic scans potentially can be employed
to differentiate gluteus medius tendinitis from trochanteric bursitis.
Often, trochanteric bursitis is managed non-operatively. First-line management includes
relative rest from offending activities, iliotibial band and tensor fascia lata stretching,
gluteal muscle strengthening, and anti-inﬂammatory drugs. Second-line treatment may
include modalities such as ultrasound with various degrees of success. If these fail or if
a patient cannot tolerate the symptoms, then a local anaesthetic and steroid injection
into the point of maximal tenderness is the next step. Radiological conﬁrmation with
ﬂuoroscopy or ultrasound improves accuracy of trochanteric bursa injections. Advise the
patient to avoid lying on the affected side, if possible.
The majority of patients will improve with conservative management. Surgical intervention should be reserved for individuals who fail to improve from non-operative treatment.
Surgery can be undertaken either open or arthroscopically. Surgery involves a release of
the iliotibial band in combination with a trochanteric bursectomy.
KEY POINTS

• In trochanteric bursitis there is tenderness over the greater trochanter with direct
palpation.

• It is more common in females than in males.
• Local anaesthetic and steroid injection into the point of maximal tenderness under
image guidance is the treatment of choice.

79

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 28
This man has pre-patellar bursitis (also known as housemaid’s knee). It is not septic
arthritis as he maintains a full range of movement of his knee joint (in the presence of
septic arthritis, with infection and pus in the joint, he would be unable to ﬂex his knee).
The pre-patellar bursa is a superﬁcial bursa with a thin synovial lining located between
the skin and the patella. The function of the bursa is to reduce friction and allow maximal
range of motion.
The causes of pre-patellar bursitis include direct trauma (e.g. following a fall or direct
blow to the knee), recurrent overuse such as repeated kneeling, and sepsis secondary to a
direct break in the skin. Occupations that are at risk of developing bursitis include carpet
layers, priests and housemaids.
Treatment in the acute stage consists of rest. Kneeling should be avoided and protected
knee caps advised at work. Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs help to reduce the
inﬂammation. Consider aspiration of the bursa in non-infected cases, particularly if the
bursa is large. Incision and drainage of the pre-patellar bursa is usually performed when
symptoms of septic bursitis have not improved signiﬁcantly within 36–48 hours. Surgical
removal of the bursa (bursectomy) may be necessary for chronic or recurrent pre-patellar
bursitis. In chronic cases, the lump can be excised.
KEY POINTS

• The function of the pre-patellar bursa is to reduce friction.
• Treatment in the acute stage consists of rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

CASE 29:

SWELLING IN THE BACK OF THE KNEE

History
A 66-year-old retired man has presented to his general practitioner with a swelling at the
back of one of his knees. The lump is not causing him any pain or discomfort, and he is
not sure how long it has been there. On further questioning he states that over the last
two or three years he has had some early morning stiffness in the knee.
Examination
This man walks with a slight limp. He has a mild varus deformity of the knee and there
is an obvious swelling at the back of the knee in the region of the popliteal fossa. The
swelling is approximately 3 cm in diameter. The lump is painless to palpation, cool, nonpulsatile, non-tender and ﬂuctuant. It is located in the midline and below the level of the
knee joint. There is reduced range of ﬂexion and he is unable to fully extend this knee
compared to the other. On palpation, he complains of some tenderness along the medial
and lateral joint lines. Assessment of medial and lateral stability reveals a correctable
varus deformity and stable ligaments. MRI scans are shown in Figs 29.1 and 29.2.

ANSWER 29
This man has a popliteal (Baker’s) cyst. The name of the cyst is in memory of the physician who originally described the condition, the British surgeon William Morrant Baker
(1839–96).
The cyst results from ﬂuid distension of the gastrocnemio-semimembranosus bursa. The
cyst is located posterior to the medial femoral condyle, between the tendons of the medial
head of the gastrocnemius and semimembranosus muscles. It usually communicates with
the joint by way of a slit-like opening at the posteromedial aspect of the knee capsule
just superior to the joint line. The lesion is typically associated with osteoarthritis in the
knee (as in this case), with pain and stiffness. A Baker’s cyst is the most common mass
in the popliteal fossa.
The differential diagnosis includes lumps arising from the posterior aspect of the knee,
with swelling from anatomical structures such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•

skin and subcutaneous tissue (lipoma, sebaceous cyst)
artery (popliteal artery aneurysm)
vein (deep vein thrombosis, saphena varix at saphenopopliteal junction)
nerve (neuroma)
enlarged bursae (semimembranosus, medial head of grastrocnemius)
cyst (Baker’s cyst).

In most cases a Baker’s cyst is asymptomatic. It is usually associated with rheumatoid
arthritis or osteoarthritis. The prevalence of Baker’s cysts in patients with inﬂammatory
arthritis is higher than in patients with osteoarthritis. The most common complication of
a Baker’s cyst is rupture of ﬂuid into the adjacent proximal gastrocnemius muscle, which
results in a pseudo-thrombophlebitis syndrome mimicking symptoms of a deep vein
thrombosis. The incidence of Baker’s cyst rupture is 3–10 per cent.
The diagnosis is conﬁrmed by ultrasound. The scan identiﬁes ﬂuid between the semimembranosus and the medial gastrocnemius tendons. Ultrasonography is useful to determine
whether the popliteal mass is a pure cystic structure or a complex cyst and/or solid mass.
On MRI, a Baker’s cyst appears as a homogeneous, high-signal-intensity, cystic mass
behind the medial femoral condyle; a thin, ﬂuid-ﬁlled neck interdigitates between the
tendons of the medial head of the gastrocnemius and semimembranosus muscles.
Once the diagnosis has been conﬁrmed this can be treated conservatively. The swelling can reduce following aspiration and application of hydrocortisone. Excision is not
advised as the rate of recurrence is high. When cartilage tears or other internal knee
problems are associated, surgery can be the best treatment option.

CASE 30:

A MILDLY SWOLLEN KNEE IN A YOUNG MAN

History
A 25-year-old man was playing football for his local team. While going in for a tackle he
sustained a twisting injury to his knee. There was no immediate swelling. He continued
to play for about ten minutes to the end of the game but then complained of some pain
in the medial aspect of his knee. He awoke the next day with a painful swelling in the
knee and so consults his general practitioner.
Examination
This young man has some mild swelling, associated with marked tenderness to palpation
over the medial joint line. He has normal varus/valgus stability of the knee and a negative
anterior draw and Lachman’s test. The range of motion is full. A plain X-ray shows good
preservation of the joint space, and an MRI ﬁlm is shown in Fig. 30.1.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the common clinical features of this injury?
• How would you manage this injury?

83

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 30
The diagnosis is a tear of the medial meniscus. Meniscus tears typically occur as a result
of twisting or change of position of the weight-bearing knee in varying degrees of ﬂexion
or extension. The swelling often takes a few hours to become apparent. In contrast, in
the presence of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture, swelling often occurs immediately or shortly after the injury. This is because the blood vessels in the ACL tend to
rupture and cause acute haemarthrosis. Immediate swelling with a meniscal tear indicates
a tear in the peripheral vascular aspect, and degenerative tears often manifest with recurrent effusions due to synovitis.
Pain from meniscus injuries is commonly intermittent and is usually the result of synovitis or abnormal motion of the unstable meniscus fragment. The pain is typically localized
to the joint line on palpation. In the presence of a large tear the patient can present with
a locked knee: the femoral condyle gets trapped within the tear and this prevents the
knee from straightening.
Provocative manoeuvres to detect the presence of a tear are based on causing impingement of the torn meniscus between the femoral and tibial surfaces. The McMurray test is
positive in the presence of a meniscal tear if you can elicit pain or a reproducible click.
The medial meniscus is evaluated by extending the fully ﬂexed knee with the foot and
tibia internally rotated while a varus stress is applied. The lateral meniscus is evaluated by extending the knee from the fully ﬂexed position, with the foot/tibia externally
rotated while a valgus stress is applied to the knee. One of the examiner’s hands should
be palpating the joint line during the manoeuvre. Alternatively, Apley’s test is performed
with the patient prone and the knee ﬂexed 90 degrees. An axial load is applied through
the heel as the lower leg is internally and externally rotated. This grinding manoeuvre
is suggestive of meniscal pathology if pain is elicited at the medial or lateral joint line.
The natural history of a short (<1 cm) vascular, longitudinal tear is often one of healing
or resolution of symptoms. Stable tears with minimal displacement, degenerative tears,
or partial-thickness tears may become asymptomatic with non-operative management.
Surgical treatment of symptomatic meniscal tears is recommended because untreated
tears may increase in size and may abrade articular cartilage, resulting in arthritis.
Symptomatic meniscal tears usually respond well to arthroscopic surgical treatment in
the absence of arthritis. Partial meniscectomy is the treatment of choice for tears in the
avascular portion of the meniscus or complex tears that are not amenable to repair. Torn
tissue is removed, and the remaining healthy meniscal tissue is contoured to a stable,
balanced peripheral rim.
Types of meniscus tears are:
•
•
•
•
•

longitudinal tears that may take the shape of a bucket handle if displaced
radial tears
parrot-beak or oblique ﬂap tears
horizontal tears
complex tears that combine variants of the above.

Resection of part of the meniscus can increase contact pressure signiﬁcantly. Meniscus
repair is recommended for tears that occur in the peripheral vascular region (red zone or
red–white zone), are longer than 1 cm, involve greater than 50 per cent of the meniscal
thickness, and are unstable to arthroscopic probing. The red zone is the well-vascularized
periphery, the red–white zone is the middle portion with vascularity peripherally but not
centrally, and the white zone is the central avascular portion. A stable knee is important
84

for successful meniscus repair and healing. In the long term, meniscal repairs fail to heal
in 5–10 per cent of patients.

CASE 31:

AN ATRAUMATIC PAINFUL KNEE IN AN
ELDERLY WOMAN
History
A 73-year-old woman presents with left knee pain. This pain has gradually deteriorated
over the last three years. She reports early-morning stiffness in the knee. Her walking
distance has reduced signiﬁcantly and is limited due to pain. She obtains minimal relief
with analgesia and rest. She has noticed some swelling in the knee and ﬁnds walking
over uneven surfaces painful, and she ﬁnds going down stairs difﬁcult. She has developed pain at night that keeps her awake. She has no history of trauma or infection. She
reports no pain in her hips or back.
Examination
This woman has valgus (knock) knees with the left more affected than the right, associated with an effusion. She has an antalgic gait. She has marked tenderness over the
lateral joint line and crepitus in the patellofemoral joint. She has ﬂexion from 5 to 85
degrees with correctable valgus deformity. Radiographs are shown in Figs 31.1 and 31.2.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• Describe the radiological signs in the right knee joint.
• What are the management options?

87

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 31
The diagnosis is osteoarthritis of the knee characterized by the pain, early-morning stiffness, deformity and radiographic ﬁndings. This elderly woman has insidious pain in the
knee. There was no pre-existing event to explain the pain. Early-morning stiffness that
gradually diminishes with activity is typical of osteoarthritis.
The bones forming the knee joint comprise the femur, tibia and patella. The femur and
tibia converge towards the knee at approximately 5–7 degrees. Greater angles result in
genu valgum which is more common in females, and a lesser angle results in genu varum
which is more common in males. The patient has a 5-degree ﬂexion contracture which
is commonly caused by posterior osteophytes on the femur, loose body and contracture
of the posterior knee capsule. Normal knee ﬂexion is to 130 degrees and ﬂexion to only
85 degrees is not uncommon with arthritis. Tenderness in the joint lines suggests that
the menisci are affected. It is important to assess the stability of the knee by testing the
medial and collateral ligaments as well as the integrity of the anterior and posterior
cruciate ligaments. As part of your examination, pathology in the joints above and below
should be excluded. Patients with degenerative hip disease may present with referred pain
through the obturator nerve to the medial side of the knee.
The radiological signs include joint space narrowing in the lateral and patellofemoral
joint. This is associated with subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation (bony outgrowths covered by hyaline cartilage that typically develop at the margins of the joints).
Often subchondral cyst formation also occurs. In degenerative arthritis the quality of the
articular cartilage is lost. Early in the process, there may be discrete chondral injuries,
whereas advanced changes include injuries on both sides of the joint. The cartilage surface becomes thin and sometimes denuded. The subchondral bone becomes thickened,
sclerotic and polished (eburnated). Cysts may arise from increased intra-articular synovial
ﬂuid pressure.
During the initial stages the management of knee osteoarthritis is conservative. This
comprises oral analgesia such as non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs. These help to
regulate the inﬂammatory response and can reduce disease symptoms. Steroid, visco supplementation injections and local heat can also be used. Although steroid injections can
provide transient relief, they can also lead to cartilage destruction with recurrent injections. A reduction of cartilage impact loading can be reduced by using a walking stick,
cushioned heels and weight loss. Knee bracing can be helpful with a correctable deformed
knee. Physiotherapy can improve the strength of the extensor mechanism.
When conservative management fails to relieve symptoms then surgery can be considered. Initially, joint-preserving surgery can be considered in the absence of severe
arthritis. The options include an arthroscopic debridement. However, in a recent report in
The Lancet, the outcomes after arthroscopic lavage or debridement were no better than
after a placebo procedure. Bone realignment procedures such as high tibial osteotomy are
an option in the presence of unicompartmental early degenerative disease. The osteotomy
helps redistribute the loads to the uninvolved compartment. Joint replacement options
include partial or total. Unicompartmental joint replacement is indicated in patients
with single compartment disease. The results are good if the indications for surgery are
adhered to. Patellofemoral arthroplasty is sometimes indicated in isolated patellofemoral
disease in young patients and is a relatively new procedure. Finally, the most common
strategy for joint replacement and most widely adopted is a total knee replacement. Joint
replacement surgery should aim to correct deformity, improve the painful symptoms and
improve mobility.

CASE 32:

AN UNSTABLE KNEE IN A YOUNG MAN

History
A 22-year-old man was playing football and had to suddenly change direction. He heard
a pop in his leg, which suddenly gave way. Immediately after this he noticed a large
swelling had developed in the knee and he was unable to ﬁnish the game. Six weeks later
the main swelling had subsided, but his knee felt unstable and kept giving way when he
tried to run or suddenly change direction. He went to his general practitioner.
Examination
This young man’s knee is moderately swollen. He has no palpable tenderness in his joint
line and medial or lateral instability. However, assessment of his knee in the anteroposterior (AP) plane reveals signs of instability. Plain X-rays of the knee look normal
with no evidence of a fracture. An MRI scan is shown in Fig. 32.1.

Figure 32.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What clinical tests would you do to assess stability of the knee?
• What associated injuries can occur?
• What is the management of this injury?

91

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 32
The diagnosis is a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) which is a typical injury
associated with immediate swelling and instability of the knee. The ACL attaches the
femur to the tibia. The ACL has anteromedial and posterolateral bands which are affected
by movement. During ﬂexion, the anterior band is taut, and the posterior band is loose.
However, during extension, the posterolateral band is tight, while the anterior band is
loose. The tibial attachment is wider and stronger than the femoral attachment. The ACL
receives nerve ﬁbres from the posterior branch of the posterior tibial nerve. The main
function of these nerves is believed to be proprioception. The ACL is the primary restraint
to limit anterior translation of the tibia. The greatest restraint is in full extension. The
ACL also serves as a secondary restraint to tibial rotation and varus/valgus angulation
at full extension. When the ACL is injured, a combination of anterior translation and
rotation occurs.
During the initial assessment, look for an effusion. This is typically present and indicates
intra-articular pathology. Palpation of the joint line may reveal some tenderness indicative of a meniscal tear. Assessment of the range of movement and noting a lack of full
extension may indicate a bucket-handle tear of the meniscus or loose body. Assess the
mediolateral stability particularly during valgus stress looking for an injury to the medial
collateral ligament. The most sensitive test looking for anterior cruciate ligament laxity is
the Lachman test. The knee should be placed in 30 degrees of ﬂexion. With one hand, stabilize the femur and with the other hand direct a force to the back of the calf anteriorly.
Observe the amount of displacement and the quality of the end-point. Comparison to the
other knee may reveal some asymmetry and greater than 3 mm is considered abnormal.
The least sensitive test is the anterior draw test. This test is performed with the knee
ﬂexed to 90 degrees. The examiner should sit gently on the patient’s foot and hold the
calf with both hands. Apply an anterior force and any anterior tibial excursion should be
compared to the other side.
Under a general anaesthetic the pivot shift test is useful. Perform the test with the leg
extended and the foot in internal rotation. Apply a valgus stress to the tibia. Observe for
a reduction of the anteriorly subluxed tibia at approximately 30 degrees.
Radiological investigations should comprise AP, lateral, skyline and notch views to
exclude any bony fractures. MRI has a sensitivity of 90–98 per cent for ACL tears and is
also useful for detecting any associated meniscal tears.
Approximately 50 per cent of patients with ACL injuries also have meniscal tears. In
acute ACL injuries, the lateral meniscus is more commonly torn; in chronic ACL tears, the
medial meniscus is more commonly torn. The ACL-deﬁcient knee has also been linked to
an increased rate of degenerative changes and meniscal injuries.
The classic ‘terrible triad’ (anterior and medial cruciate ligaments, plus medial meniscus
tears) involves a valgus stress to the knee with resultant acute injury to the ACL and MCL.
However, the medial meniscus tear is now thought to occur later, as a result of chronic
ACL deﬁciency.
Conservative management is typically reserved for individuals who do not participate
in sports or are not involved in heavy manual work. Reconstruction is often considered
following a trial of conservative management in patients with instability.

CASE 33:

AN INJURED ANKLE

History
A 39-year-old businessman recently took up squash in his leisure time. He started to
complain of mild pain in the posterior aspect of his ankle while playing. Then, while
playing, he heard a sudden snap in the lower calf associated with severe pain. He was
able to walk with a limp, but unable to run or stand on his toes and had to stop playing immediately. He is otherwise ﬁt and well and his only recent medication has been a
course of a ﬂuoroquinolone for a chest infection.
Examination
This man’s affected ankle has some swelling over the posterior aspect. On palpation, he
has some tenderness over the Achilles tendon and a palpable gap. With the patient prone,
squeezing the calf demonstrates no passive plantar ﬂexion of the foot.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the risk factors?
• What clinical and radiological tests are useful to confirm the diagnosis?
• What are the options for treatment?

95

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 33
The diagnosis is a ruptured Achilles tendon, characterized by a history of a sudden snap
and no passive plantarﬂexion of the foot while the calf is squeezed.
The Achilles tendon is the largest and strongest tendon in the human body, and it is
formed from tendinous contributions of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. The tendons converge approximately 15 cm proximal to the insertion at the posterior calcaneus.
The tendon has the ability to stretch by up to 4 per cent before damage occurs. With
stretch greater than 8 per cent, macroscopic rupture occurs. The blood supply for the
tendon is derived from the posterior tibial artery. The watershed zone is an area 2–6 cm
proximal to the calcaneus, in which the blood supply is less abundant and becomes
even sparser with age. It is in this region that most degeneration and therefore rupture
of the tendon occurs. The differential diagnosis is soft-tissue or bony pathology. Softtissue pathology includes Achilles peritendonitis (tends to have some activity-related
pain, swelling and sometimes crepitus along the tendon sheath with nodularity), tendinosis (characterized by mucoid degeneration of the tendon with a lack of inﬂammatory
response), or gastrocnemius or soleus tear. Bony pathology includes calcaneal bony
injury or inﬂammatory arthropathy.
There is a risk in men between the ages of 30 and 50 years who are generally recreational
athletes. An activity involving a sudden forceful contraction of the Achilles tendon can
cause a rupture. Other mechanisms include direct trauma. Up to 50 per cent of ruptures
have had a history of pre-existing chronic tendonitis. Corticosteroid injection of the
Achilles tendon or its sheath has been implicated as the cause of subsequent tendon
rupture. Another risk factor is the use of ﬂuoroquinolone antibiotics.
The majority of Achilles tendon tears occur in the left leg in the substance of the tendo
Achilles, approximately 2–6 cm (the ‘watershed zone’) above the calcaneal insertion of
the tendon. This zone is relatively hypovascular. Clinical examination of the tendon may
reveal tenderness, swelling (at the rupture site or more proximally in the calf), bruising,
and a palpable gap in the Achilles tendon. There is a loss of plantar ﬂexion power in the
foot and the patient will not be able to stand on tip-toes.
A special test for Achilles tendon rupture is the Thompson test. The patient is positioned
prone; squeezing the calf of the extended leg may demonstrate no passive plantar ﬂexion
of the foot if its Achilles tendon is ruptured. Investigations that are useful to diagnose
the rupture include ultrasound or MRI. Ultrasound can assess the tendon thickness and
the presence of a tear. Imaging the tendon tear in the plantarﬂexed position also allows
assessment of whether the two ends are apposed or whether there is a gap. MRI is useful
in incomplete rupture and is helpful in the assessment of paratendonitis and tendinosis.
Plain radiogrphs are useful if you suspect a calcaneal fracture.
Treatment options, non-operative or operative, are determined on a patient-by-patient
basis. The average time for immobilization in a cast is about 9 weeks.
KEY POINTS

• The watershed vascular zone of the Achilles tendon is an area 2–6 cm proximal to the
calcaneus.

• The Thompson test is useful for Achilles tendon rupture.
• Ultrasound scanning is the initial investigation of choice.
• Treat using a plaster cast when the tendon edges are apposed, and surgery when there
is a gap.

DEFORMED FEET IN A NEWBORN CHILD

History
A 30-year-old woman at 40 weeks’ gestation delivers a baby after a 16-hour period of
labour. The parents think that both the baby’s feet look abnormal. The paediatrician is
called to assess the newborn’s feet.
Examination
The positions of both feet are in equinus and the feet are also supinated and adducted
(Fig. 34.1). The feet are not tender, and the overlying skin looks healthy. Pulses are
present.

Figure 34.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• Describe the deformity.
• What are the principles of conservative treatment?

97

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 34
The diagnosis is club feet (congenital talipes equinovarus, CTEV), which is a structural
deformity present at birth. The deformity is maintained by a combination of contracted
joint capsule ligaments and contracted foot and ankle ligaments. Club foot can be classiﬁed as either postural or ﬁxed. Fixed or rigid club feet are either ﬂexible (correctable
without surgery) or resistant (correctable with surgery). Club foot is bilateral in about
50 per cent of cases and occurs in approximately 1 in 800 births. The condition is more
common in males with a 2:1 ratio, and there is a 10 per cent chance of a subsequent baby
being affected if the parents already have one child affected.
The bones of the midfoot are affected. The navicular is displaced medially, as is the
cuboid. Contractures of the medial plantar soft tissues are present. The talar neck is easily palpable in the sinus tarsi as it is uncovered laterally. Normally, this is covered by
the navicular, and the talar body is in the mortise. The medial malleolus is difﬁcult to
palpate and is often in contact with the navicular. The hindfoot is supinated, but the
foot is often in a position of pronation relative to the hindfoot. The ﬁrst ray often drops
to create a position of cavus. The calcaneus also sits in equinus with the anterior aspect
rotated medially and the posterior aspect laterally. The heel is small and feels empty and
soft to touch. As the treatment progresses, the calcaneal position improves and the heel
begins to feel ﬁrm.
The goal of treatment is to obtain a functional plantigrade cosmetically acceptable painless
foot. In the present case, non-operative treatment comprised the Ponseti method which
is used to correct the cavus, the adduction, then varus, and lastly the equinus deformity
(CAVE). Splintage begins at 2–3 days after birth. The foot should be re-manipulated
weekly and reassessed radiographically at 3 months. An Achilles tenotomy may be
necessary if the hindfoot equinus persists. Surgery should be used as soon as it is obvious
that conservative treatment is failing. Operative treatments involve soft-tissue release for
children (6–12 months). These include posterior release or complete soft-tissue releases
such as posteromedial plantar release or complete subtalar release. Other procedures used
include tendon transfers, tibialis anterior, and bone procedures, osteotomies and arthrodeses. Orthoses, Denis Browne bars and Bebax shoes are used to maintain the correction.
KEY POINTS

• Club foot is a structural deformity present at birth.
• Feet can be assessed and scored using the Pirani scoring system.
• Club feet are either flexible (correctable without surgery) or resistant (correctable with
surgery).

• The goal of treatment is to obtain a functional, plantigrade, cosmetically acceptable
and painless foot.

• Non-operative treatment comprises the Ponseti method. Operative treatments comprise
soft-tissue release, osteotomies and tendon transfers.

HIGH-ARCHED FEET IN A YOUNG GIRL

History
A 9-year-old girl and her grandmother went shopping for new shoes. The girl was having
trouble getting her toes into the conventional shoes because they were rubbing on top of
the shoes. Her grandmother noticed that the shape of her granddaughter’s feet was similar
in appearance to her husband’s, and there was a family history of Charcot–Marie–Tooth
(CMT) disease. The following day they go to see their general practitioner.
Examination
Both feet have high medial arches and there appears to be bilateral clawing of the forefoot toes. On palpation, she had tenderness under the metatarsal heads with some callosities (Fig. 35.1).

Figure 35.1

Questions
• Describe the deformity in the feet.
• What are the causes of this condition?
• How would you examine this patient’s feet?

99

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 35
The girl has a cavus deformity of the feet (pes cavus) with an elevated longitudinal arch
due to ﬁxed plantarﬂexion of the forefoot. Associated deformities include claw toes. The
deformity can be located in the forefoot, midfoot, hindfoot, or a combination thereof. The
main type of cavus foot is the cavovarus deformity. In CMT, the anterior tibialis muscle
and the peroneus muscle develop weaknesses. Antagonist muscles, posterior tibialis and
peroneus longus, pull harder than the other muscles, causing deformity. Speciﬁcally, the
peroneus longus pulls harder than the weak anterior tibialis, causing plantarﬂexion of the
ﬁrst ray and forefoot valgus. The posterior tibialis pulls harder than the weak peroneus
brevis, causing forefoot adduction. Intrinsic muscle develops contractures while the long
extensor to the toes, recruited to assist in ankle dorsiﬂexion, causes cock-up or claw-toe
deformity – as in this case. With the forefoot valgus and the hindfoot varus, increased
stress is placed on the lateral ankle ligaments and instability can occur.
With a unilateral deformity, possible causes are cerebral palsy, diastematoyelia, spinal
cord tumour or tethered cord. With a bilateral deformity, possible causes are neuromuscular diseases such as Becker’s muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, congenital pes cavus,
CMT, dystonia, Friedreich’s ataxia or poliomyelitis.
The deformity is assessed to discover whether it is ﬂexible or rigid. The forefoot is
observed for plantar ﬂexion, and the hindfoot is observed for varus. A full neurological
examination documenting the strength of the individual muscles is essential for determining surgical options. Assess the hindfoot ﬂexibility of a cavovarus foot using the
Coleman block test. This test is useful to assess hindfoot ﬂexibility and pronation of
the forefoot. The test is performed by placing the patient’s foot on the block and asking
them to bear full weight. The ﬁrst, second and third metatarsals should be allowed to
hang freely into plantarﬂexion and pronation. This effectively negates the effect of the
ﬁrst metatarsal in plantarﬂexion on the hindfoot. If the hindfoot varus corrects, while
standing on the block, the hindfoot is considered ﬂexible.
If the subtalar joint is ﬂexible and corrects with the Coleman block test, then surgery can
be directed to the forefoot. However, if the subtalar joint is rigid, then surgical correction
of both the forefoot and hindfoot should be considered.
KEY POINTS

• Pes cavus is an elevated longitudinal arch due to fixed plantarflexion of the forefoot.
• The forefoot is observed for plantarflexion, and the hindfoot is observed for varus.
• A full neurological examination documenting the strength of the individual muscles
should be performed, plus the Coleman block test.

• Orthotics with extra-depth shoes to off-load bony prominences and prevent rubbing of
the toes may improve symptoms.

101

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 36
The diagnosis is ﬂat feet deformity (pes planus). The clinical presentation can be
extremely variable and directly correlates with the stage of the disease.
The deformity involves ‘shortening’ of the lateral column, plantar inclination of the talar
head, and lateral subluxation of the navicular on the talar head. Clinically, the arch
ﬂattens, the forefoot abducts (the ‘too-many-toes’ sign), and heel valgus occurs – as in
this case. Clinical manifestations that ensue include the inability to perform a single-leg
heel rise. This inability to invert the heel results in chronic heel valgus and subsequent
Achilles contracture.
Typically infants have a minimal arch and often toddlers have ﬂattening of the long
arch, forefoot pronation and heel valgus. Usually these children spontaneously develop
a strong normal arch within their ﬁrst decade. The majority of feet improve as the child
ages, at least until 5–6 years old.
There are three stages.
• In stage 1, mild tenderness occurs along the inframalleolar course of the posterior
tibial tendon (PTT), with minimal (if any) loss in tendon strength as assessed by
the single-limb, heel-rise test. When the patient bears weight only on the involved
extremity, performing the heel-rise test demonstrates not only adequate strength but
also initiation of heel inversion, which signals an intact tendon.
• Stage 2 disease is a dynamic deformity, where there is hindfoot valgus with forefoot
abduction. Palpation along the course of the PTT demonstrates pain. Observing the
patient’s stance from behind reveals increased visualization of the lateral toes (toomany-toes sign) on the affected extremity secondary to weakness. Single-limb heel
rise may not be possible due to weakness, and if performed, corrective heel inversion
is generally absent.
• In stage 3, chronic dysfunction and lengthening of the PTT lead to ﬁxed hindfoot
deformity. In order to achieve a plantigrade foot in the setting of a ﬁxed hindfoot
valgus, the forefoot typically compensates into a ﬁxed supination position. With stage
3 disease, patients often present with lateral pain secondary to subﬁbular impingement as the calcaneus subluxes and the ﬂat-foot deformity progresses.
Recently, a fourth stage has been added to the original description of PTT dysfunction.
Longstanding hindfoot valgus places increasing stress on the deltoid complex, with eventual loss of competence. The resultant valgus tilt of the talus leads to eccentric loading
of the ankle with subsequent tibiotalar arthrosis.
Three weight-bearing views of the foot are desirable (anteroposterior, oblique, lateral)
plus three weight-bearing views of the ankle (AP, mortise, lateral). Evaluation of longitudinal arch collapse is largely dependent on weight-bearing lateral radiographs. The
axis of the talar/ﬁrst metatarsal angle on the lateral weight-bearing foot radiograph is
the most discriminating parameter. Alternatively, the distance between the medial cuneiform and the ﬂoor is a strong reﬂection of medial arch collapse and ﬂat foot. Additional
features of pes planus deformity that are noted on the lateral view include talar plantarﬂexion and decreased calcaneal pitch.
An AP standing foot projection is primarily used for evaluating talar head uncoverage
secondary to lateral deviation of the navicular. Also look for evidence of valgus talar tilt
with resultant subluxation, arthrosis, or both. The ankle view is particularly important
102

Orthopaedics

in patients who have ﬁxed hindfoot valgus. MRI provides highly detailed evaluations of
the posterior tibial tendon.
Pes planus can be classiﬁed as either ﬂexible or rigid. The most common cause is posterior tibial tendon insufﬁciency. The condition is most common in middle-aged women
with obesity. Younger patients who present with rigid pes planus should be screened for
conditions such as tarsal coalition and congenital vertical talus.
Patients with asymptomatic pes planus may progress to a symptomatic stage as the
degenerative process progresses. Trauma to both the bony and soft tissue of the midfoot
can lead to the deformity. Fracture dislocation to the medial column (navicular and ﬁrst
metatarsal) and rupture to the spring ligament or plantar fascia lead to progressive collapse of the medial longitudinal arch. Neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus, spinal
cord injury and Charcot neuropathy are conditions seen with pes planus.
KEY POINTS

• Pes planus is divided into rigid and flexible types, and three stages of disease are
defined.

• Posterior tibial tendon insufficiency is the most common cause.
• Conservative treatment includes accommodating footwear and insoles. Surgery
involves soft-tissue and/or bone procedures.

CASE 37:

A PAINFUL AND SWOLLEN ANKLE

History
A 28-year-old man slipped while crossing a road and sustained a pronation–eversion
injury to his left ankle. He complained of severe pain immediately in his ankle and hobbled over to the other side of the road.
Examination
This man’s ankle is swollen on the medial, anterior and lateral sides. There is some obvious bruising both medially and laterally. Palpation of the medial and lateral aspect of
the ankle is very tender. Assessment of movement reveals pain on ankle dorsiﬂexion and
plantarﬂexion with extreme apprehension and reluctance. He is unable to fully weightbear on the left ankle owing to pain. A radiograph of the ankle is shown in Fig. 37.1.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• Describe the key ligaments responsible for stability in the ankle.
• What are the principles of management?

105

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 37
The diagnosis is a fracture of the ﬁbula and medial malleolus shown by the pain in the
lateral and medial malleolus, inability to bear weight, and fracture lines through the ﬁbula
and medial malleolus. The ﬁbula fracture is above the level of the ankle syndesmosis. This
is an unstable fracture. The Danis–Weber classiﬁcation is based on the level of the ﬁbular
fracture, the level of the tibioﬁbular syndesmotic disruption and potential talar (ankle)
instability (see the box). The initial X-ray includes at least three projections: anteroposterior,
lateral and mortise views, with the foot in internal rotation of 15 degrees. Occasionally stress
radiographs for lateral or medial instability may be necessary. Greater than 5 mm of medial
clear joint space seen on static or stress radiographs indicates injury to the deltoid ligament.
The ankle is a modiﬁed hinge joint with three bones (tibia, ﬁbula and talus) and the ligaments that bind these bones as a unit. The lateral collateral ligament consists of three components: anterior taloﬁbular ligament (ATFL), calcaneoﬁbular ligament (CFL), and posterior
taloﬁbular ligament (PTFL). On the medial side, the deltoid ligament consists of a superﬁcial
and a deep stronger portion and is in the main a medial stabilizer of the ankle joint. The
distal end of the ﬁbula lies against the tibial groove, held together by a complex of distal
tibioﬁbular ligaments and is called a syndesmosis. This complex consists of a group of ligaments: anteroinferior and posteroinferior tibioﬁbular ligaments and the strongest one, the
interosseous ligament, which is the thickest part of the interosseous membrane.
Closed reduction with below-knee cast immobilization should be reserved for undisplaced, stable fractures, anatomically reduced fractures, and for patients with poor medical condition such as elderly diabetics. Unstable fractures or fractures with displacement
should be considered for surgical management. The timing of surgery is important. It
should either be early, before the ankle swells, or (as in the present case) delayed for
7–10 days to allow the swelling to subside. Most isolated undisplaced Danis–Weber type
A fractures can be treated conservatively in a below-knee walking plaster for 6–8 weeks,
allowing weight-bearing as tolerated until the ﬁbular has healed. Stable, undisplaced
fractures of the malleoli with posterior malleolus involvement of less than 25 per cent of
the articular surface can also be treated conservatively with plaster for 6 weeks and nonweight-bearing. Bimalleolar and trimalleolar injuries are unstable and are treated with
open reduction and internal ﬁxation. Most displaced medial malleolar fractures should be
opened, and the trapped periosteum removed and ﬁxed to restore normal ankle congruency and deltoid integrity.

!

Danis–Weber classification of fibular fractures

• Type A: Fibular fracture below the joint line, with intact syndesmosis
• Type B: Fracture at the level of the ankle joint line, with partial syndesmotic injury
• Type C: Fibular fracture proximal to the tibiofibular joint with associated
disruption of the syndesmosis. Two subtypes are recognized: diaphyseal
(Dupuytren) and proximal (Maisonnevue)
KEY POINTS

• Fibular fractures are classified as Danis–Weber A, B or C.
• Greater than 5 mm of medial clear joint space indicates injury to the deltoid ligament.
• Closed reduction with below-knee cast immobilization should be reserved for
undisplaced, stable fractures. Open reduction and internal fixation is used for
displaced unstable fractures.

CASE 38:

DEFORMED FEET IN AN ELDERLY WOMAN

History
A 70-year-old woman has been having trouble ﬁnding comfortable shoes because the
shape of her feet has changed over the past few years. She recalls that her mother’s feet
were similar in shape. She went to see her general practitioner in order to be referred to
a foot specialist. She reports an aching pain in her ﬁrst metatarsophalangeal joint of the
right foot while walking. She recalls no history of trauma.
Examination
There is swelling and deformity of the ﬁrst metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint with lateral
deviation of the great toe. This is associated with overriding of the second toe towards
the great toe (Fig. 38.1). A radiograph is shown in Fig. 38.2.

Figure 38.1

• What is the diagnosis?
• Describe the features on physical examination associated with this condition in addition to the lateral deviation of the great toe and overriding second toe.
• What are the options for treatment?

107

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 38
The diagnosis is hallux valgus because of the swelling, deformity and associated lateral
deviation of the toe. It may be associated with medial deviation of the ﬁrst ray known as
metatarsus primus varus. Pronation of the hallux may also be present.
The physical ﬁndings include a bunion which may be inﬂamed and tender – as in this
case. The bunion is typically located over the dorsomedial aspect of the ﬁrst metatarsal
joint. There may be evidence of crepitus in the ﬁrst MTP joint and some stiffness indicating degenerative changes in the joint. Assess the ﬁrst metatarsal (MT) cuneiform joint
for hypermobility and tenderness by pushing the MT head into dorsiﬂexion and plantarﬂexion. There may be splaying of the forefoot and tenderness to palpation under the
lesser metartarsal head (metatarsalgia). Patients will often describe a feeling like walking
on pebbles. The lesser toe deformities are associated with hammer toes. The distal interphalangeal joints are often associated with corns or callosities on the dorsum of the toes.
Management of hallux valgus is initially non-operative treatment using footwear that
accommodates the deformity. Shoes may be modiﬁed to provide more width and depth
for the forefoot. In the presence of degenerative disease of the MTP joint, a stiff-soled
shoe may be beneﬁcial. Padding and strapping have limited beneﬁt in the long term but
may be useful in the elderly who are not medically ﬁt for surgery.
If there remains some ﬂexibility in the foot, orthotics may have a role. However, in the
presence of rigid deformity the foot cannot be manipulated and will need to be accommodated by the orthosis.
When conservative management fails, surgery is considered. The goals of surgical treatment are to relieve symptoms, restore function, and correct the deformity and prevent
recurrence.
KEY POINTS

• In hallux valgus there is lateral deviation of the great toe and a bunion over the
dorsomedial aspect of the first metatarsal joint.

• Assess for crepitus/stiffness in the first MTP joint, metatarsalgia, hammer toes, corns or
callosities on the dorsum of the toes.

• Initial management is non-operative treatment using footwear that accommodates the
deformity. Surgical management includes a combination of soft-tissue procedures and
osteotomies.

CASE 39:

A STIFF GREAT TOE

History
A 45-year-old woman has been experiencing a painful right great toe for 4 years. There is
no recall of trauma or infection, or history of gout in the great toe, but it is swollen and
stiff. The pain is localized to the ﬁrst metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, and is aggravated
by activity. The woman is otherwise medically ﬁt and well.
Examination
The ﬁrst MTP joint shows no signs of erythema. There is a ﬁrm dorsal swelling over the
MTP joint that is tender to palpation. There is no active or passive dorsiﬂexion in the
ﬁrst MTP joint. There are no signs of neurovascular deﬁcit. Radiographs of the affected
toe are shown in Figs 39.1 and 39.2.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?

• What are the management options?

109

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 39
The diagnosis is hallux rigidus because of the stiffness and presence of dorsal osteophytes
seen on the radiographs. This condition encompasses mild to severe degenerative arthritis
of the ﬁrst MTP joint of the foot. The patient complains of pain from impingement of the
dorsal osteophytes, especially during walking on rough ground and slopes. The patient
may also complain of diffuse, lateral forefoot pain resulting from increased weightbearing on the lateral foot to ofﬂoad the hallux. Dorsiﬂexion is restricted, but the foot
may demonstrate compensatory hyperextension of the interphalangeal joint.
Hallux rigidus is the second most common condition affecting the great toe, the ﬁrst
being hallux valgus. The condition is more common in females than males. This condition is seen in two distinct populations: those who present in adolescence and those who
present in adulthood. In the adolescent type, localized chondral lesions in the articular
surface of the metatarsal head are present. In the adult type, there is more generalized
arthritis.
Radiological features include squaring off of the ﬁrst MTP joint and loss of joint space,
osteophytes as seen in the radiographs, cyst formation and sclerosis. The articular degenerative changes are associated with dehydration of the cartilage, which in turn is more
susceptible to injury resulting from shear and compressive forces. The subchondral bone
shares these stresses, which subsequently lead to increased subchondral bone density, formation of periarticular osteophytes and, in severe cases, cystic changes. The osteophytes
limit ﬁrst MTP joint motion. In severe cases, the articular cartilage is completely denuded.
Initially the management is conservative. Medication options include analgesic and
non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Mechanical methods limiting the ﬁrst
MTP joint motion are helpful. The use of in-shoe orthotics with medial stiffness, stiffsoled shoes with a rocker bottom, shoes with a wide toe box, low-heeled shoes, and
shoe modiﬁcations, such as a steel shank placed along the entire medial side, may be
beneﬁcial. Activity modiﬁcations include avoiding extremes of dorsiﬂexion of the great
toe, such as those caused by kneeling or squatting with the toes in an extended position.
Manipulation combined with steroid injection into the joint can be useful in the early
stages of the disease.
Conservative management can often be used to successfully treat patients with varying
degrees of severity of hallux rigidus. However, in refractory cases the choice of operation depends on the degree of involvement, limitations of the range of movement, and
the person’s activity level. Surgical options comprising joint-sparing procedures that
remove the dorsal osteophyte (chielectomy) are indicated in early disease. Other surgical
procedures are bone-cutting (proximal phalanx and/or metatarsal osteotomy) and joint
replacement, which can improve joint movement and relieve pain but is not without
complications. Joint fusion (arthrodesis), particularly in advanced cases, provides reliable
results in individuals involved in strenuous activities.
KEY POINTS

• Hallux rigidus is associated with mild to severe degenerative arthritis of the first MTP
joint of the foot.

• Pain comes from impingement of the dorsal osteophytes.
• Hallux rigidus may present in adolescence or in adulthood.

CASE 40: MISSHAPEN

TOE IN A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (1)

History
A 40-year-old woman was shopping for shoes for a special occasion. After several hours
and several attempts at selecting shoes, she had not found any that would ﬁt comfortably. She attributed this to her third toe. The tip of the toe had changed in appearance
lately and was associated with pain because her toe was rubbing against her shoes. She
has decided to seek the advice of a foot specialist.
Examination
This woman has a ﬂexion deformity to the third toe at the level of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint (Fig. 40.1). There is a callosity on the dorsum of the DIP joint. She has
no neurovascular deﬁcit.

• How would you manage this patient?

111

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 40
This woman has mallet toe deformity which is deﬁned by the ﬂexion deformity of the DIP
joint. Mallet toes are common in diabetics with peripheral neuropathy. A mallet deformity is either a ﬂexible or ﬁxed deformity of the distal interphalangeal joint leading to
pressure on the tip of the toe, often associated with attenuation of the extensor tendon.
Pain and/or a callosity is often the presenting complaint. This may also lead to nail
deformity on the toe. Most commonly the deformity is present in the second toe. A small
number of patients can have associated lateral or medial deviation of the toe.
On examination, assess the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, and the location of callosities and nail deformity. Assess the ﬂexibility of
the DIP joint with the toe plantarﬂexed and dorsiﬂexed at the MTP joint and PIP joint.
The distal interphalangeal joint is a hinge joint with collateral and accessory collateral
ligaments and a plantar plate. The ﬂexor sheath extends to the DIP joint. The deformity
may be ﬂexible in cases in which the principal problem is an overtight ﬂexor digitorum
longus. With ﬁxed deformities the plantar joint structures may be contracted, or alteration of the joint surfaces may have occurred to restrict the joint’s range of motion.
Footwear modiﬁcation such as a wide toe box should be tried ﬁrst in order to relieve
pressure under the tip. Soft orthoses or toe protectors can be useful. Surgical management
of mallet toe is indicated if the deformity becomes painful. Surgery comprises a ﬂexor
tenotomy, possibly including plantar capsular release and pinning; condylectomy and
fusion of the middle to distal phalanx; and, occasionally, partial or complete amputation
of the distal phalanx. A ﬂexible mallet toe can be treated with a ﬂexor tenotomy. A ﬁxed
deformity can be treated with a condylectomy. An ulcerated or infected toe would do best
with a terminal Syme amputation.

MISSHAPEN TOE IN A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (2)

History
A 55-year-old woman presents with hardened skin on the dorsal aspect of her second
toe. She complains also of occasional pain over the plantar area of the metatarsal head.
Examination
The second toe is ﬂexed at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. The distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint are hyperextended (Fig. 41.1).

Figure 41.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you further examine this deformity?
• How would you manage this patient?

113

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 41
The diagnosis is hammer toe. Hammer toe deformity is the most common deformity of
the lesser toes. The toe is ﬂexed at the PIP joint. The DIP joint and MTP joint are usually
hyperextended. The condition often presents with a corn or callosity on the dorsum or the
metatarsal head and commonly affects the second toe – as in this case. With progressive
PIP joint ﬂexion deformity, compensatory hyperextension of the MTP and DIP joints can
occur – as seen in this case. The hyperextension of the MTP joint and ﬂexion of the PIP
joint make the PIP joint prominent dorsally. This prominence rubs against the patient’s
footwear, leading to pain. The deformity is ﬂexible and passively correctable early but
typically becomes ﬁxed over time. Progressive deformity can lead to MTP joint dislocation and can be seen on X-rays.
On examination the patient typically complains of pain over the dorsal aspect of the PIP
joint. Occasionally, the patient also complains of pain over the plantar area of the metatarsal head, especially if the MTP joint is hyperextended, subluxed or dislocated. A callus
may be present over the dorsal surface of the PIP joint, over the plantar surface of the
metatarsal head, or at the tip of the toe – as in this case. The extensor digitorum longus
(EDL) tendon gradually loses mechanical advantage at the PIP joint, as does the ﬂexor
digitorum longus (FDL) tendon at the MTP joint. The intrinsic muscles sublux dorsally as
the MTP hyperextends. They now extend the MTP joint and ﬂex the PIP joint, as opposed
to their usual functions of ﬂexing the MTP joint and extending the PIP joint.
Examination of hammer toe deformity should include a neurovascular evaluation, including palpation of pulses, a sensory examination, and an evaluation of intrinsic muscle
bulk. The deformity should be assessed while the patient is standing. Passive correction
of the deformity should be attempted, because this will help determine which treatment
options are appropriate for the patient. Diagnostic assessment for hammer toe deformity
comprises weight-bearing anteroposterior and lateral radiography of the involved foot.
Any intra-articular or periarticular erosions suggest rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic
arthritis, respectively.
The indication for surgical treatment is intractable pain that does not improve with
adequate non-operative treatment, including taping (for ﬂexible deformity) and the use
of accommodative footwear featuring a toe box of adequate depth (for ﬁxed deformity).
When considering surgery, distinguish between ﬂexible and ﬁxed deformity. If the
hammer toe is due to contracture of the FDL tendon, then plantarﬂexion of the ankle
will straighten the toe. In contrast, dorsiﬂexion of the ankle will worsen the deformity.
Flexible deformity of greater magnitude requires a ﬂexor tenotomy. Passively correctable deformity is amenable to tendon transfer procedures such as a Girdlestone–Taylor
ﬂexor-to-extensor tendon transfer. A ﬁxed deformity requires at least resection arthroplasty of the PIP joint. The goal is to shorten the toe to decrease the deforming forces
of the contracted soft tissues. As the magnitude of the deformity increases, additional
procedures may be necessary, such as ﬂexor tenotomy, extensor tenotomy, MTP joint
release or arthroplasty, or metatarsal shortening. Both ﬂexible and ﬁxed deformities also
may require MTP arthroplasty and/or extensor tenotomy to achieve adequate correction.
A metatarsal shortening osteotomy may need to be added for a dislocated MTP joint or
MTP instability with synovitis. Plantar condylectomy of the metatarsal head may need to
be added for plantar metatarsal head pain without instability or synovitis.

117

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 42
The diagnosis is a Lisfranc injury which is typical with this mechanism of injury. Jacques
Lisfranc de Saint-Martin (1790–1847), a ﬁeld surgeon in Napoleon’s army, described an
amputation technique across the ﬁve tarsometatarsal (TMT) joints. At the time this was an
effective solution to forefoot gangrene secondary to frostbite. This anatomical landmark
became known as the Lisfranc joint.
The Lisfranc joint, which represents the articulation between the midfoot and forefoot, is
composed of the ﬁve TMT joints. The Lisfranc ligament is attached to the lateral margin
of the medial cuneiform and medial and plantar surface of the second metatarsal (MT)
base. This is the only ligamentous support between ﬁrst and second rays at midfoot
level. A Lisfranc injury encompasses everything from a sprain to a complete disruption
of normal anatomy through the TMT joints. Injury to this ligament, even in isolation,
will result in functional instability with loss of longitudinal and transverse arches. No
intermetatarsal ligaments exist between the ﬁrst and second MTs. Lisfranc injuries are
commonly undiagnosed and carry a high risk of chronic secondary disability.
Initial radiographs should include anteroposterior, lateral and oblique views. Standing
radiographs are ideal but often too painful. Good alternatives are stress radiographs with
the forefoot in dorsiﬂexion and abduction.
On the radiographs, dislocation of the TMT joint is indicated by loss of in-line arrangement of the lateral margin of the ﬁrst metatarsal base with the lateral edge of the medial
cuneiform; loss of in-line arrangement of the medial margin of the second metatarsal
base with the medial edge of the middle cuneiform in the weight-bearing AP view; and
the presence of small avulsed fragments (‘ﬂeck sign’), which are additional indications of
ligamentous injury and probable joint disruption. A ﬂeck sign seen on the AP radiograph
is pathognomonic for a Lisfranc injury (present in 90 per cent of instances). It represents
an avulsion fracture from either the second MT base or the medial cuneiform, due to
forceful abduction of the forefoot that avulses the Lisfranc ligament between the base of
the second MT and the medial cuneiform – as can be seen in this case. On the AP view,
the distance between the ﬁrst and second metatarsals should be less than 2–3 mm. A
normal lateral radiographic view of the foot should show the superior border of the ﬁrst
MT base lining up with the superior border of the medial cuneiform. If the dorsal surface
of the proximal second MT is higher than the dorsal surface of the middle cuneiform then
this is indicative of an injury. On a medial 30-degree oblique view of the foot, the cuboid
should align with the medial border of the fourth MT.
MRI is accurate for detecting traumatic injury of the Lisfranc ligament and for predicting
Lisfranc joint complex instability. Finally, with an ankle block or intravenous sedation,
stress the foot under ﬂuoroscopic examination with pressure on the medial forefoot,
pushing laterally while the hindfoot is pushed medially. An AP view of the TMT joints
reveals any signiﬁcant instability.
Non-surgical management should be limited to patients who do not have fractures, or
who have fractures that are undisplaced and stable under stress. If the clinical evaluation indicates the probability of a mild or moderate sprain and the radiograph shows
no diastasis, then immobilization is suggested. Note the anterior tibial tendon can block
reduction of a lateral Lisfranc dislocation; similarly, the peroneus brevis tendon can block
a medial dislocation reduction. Combined closed reduction and casting has no role in the
treatment of unstable injuries. All injuries that are displaced and unstable require surgery.
A displacement of more than 2 mm requires open reduction and internal ﬁxation. All
118

Orthopaedics

Lisfranc injuries that cannot be reduced and be made to remain stable by closed means
should undergo internal ﬁxation.
KEY POINTS

• The Lisfranc joint is the articulation between the midfoot and forefoot.
• Radiological assessment involves AP, lateral and oblique views of the foot.
• Injury to the Lisfranc ligament can result in functional instability with loss of
longitudinal and transverse arches.

• A diastasis greater than 2–3 mm between the base of the first and second metatarsals
suggests a Lisfranc injury.

• The fleck sign seen on the AP radiograph is pathognomonic for a Lisfranc injury.
• Displacement of more than 2 mm requires open reduction and internal fixation.

121

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 43
The diagnosis is a Charcot (neuropathic) joint, where damage has occurred through the
lack of pain sensation to prevent damage. Charcot arthropathy results in progressive
destruction of bone and soft tissues at weight-bearing joints. In its most severe form it
may cause signiﬁcant disruption of the bony architecture, including joint dislocations
and fractures. Charcot arthropathy can occur at any joint but most commonly affects the
lower regions: the foot and ankle. Bilateral disease occurs in fewer than 10 per cent of
patients.
Any condition that leads to a sensory or autonomic neuropathy can cause a Charcot
joint. Charcot arthropathy can occur as a complication of diabetes, syphilis, alcoholism, leprosy, meningomyleocele, spinal cord injury, syringomyelia, renal dialysis and
congenital insensitivity to pain.
In the majority of cases, non-operative methods are preferred. The principles of management are to provide immobilization of the affected joint and reduce any areas of stress
on the skin. Immobilization is usually accomplished by casting. Total-contact casts have
been shown to allow patients to ambulate while preventing the progression of deformity.
Casts must be checked weekly, and they should be replaced every 1–2 weeks. Patients
with concomitant ulceration must have their casts changed weekly for ulcer evaluation
and debridement. Serial plain radiographs should be taken approximately every month
during the acute phase. Casting is usually necessary for 3–6 months and is discontinued
based on clinical and radiographic assessments, and dermal temperature and signs of
quiescence.
Surgery is uncommonly indicated for a Charcot foot when non-surgical methods fail:
in particular when the deformity places the foot at risk of ulceration or when the foot
can no longer be protected in accommodative footwear. The aim of surgery is to achieve
a stable foot and ankle joint, maintaining the plantigrade position. The foot should be
able to tolerate accommodative footwear and support ambulation of the patient. A major
contraindication to surgery is active inﬂammation.
KEY POINTS

• Charcot arthropathy results in progressive destruction of bone and soft tissues at
weight-bearing joints.

• Non-operative methods are the treatment of choice.
• The aim of surgery is to achieve a stable foot and ankle joint, maintaining the
plantigrade position.

path and landed on her right shoulder. She developed a persistent severe aching in her
shoulder and later attended the emergency department. Investigations including an X-ray
showed no fracture and she was reassured. A few days later she is still having difﬁculty
washing and dressing, although there is hardly any pain in her shoulder. She has a medical history of diabetes but is otherwise ﬁt and well.
Examination
This woman’s shoulder area has no signs of obvious swelling or bruising. On palpation
she has no tenderness or obvious deformity. She does, however, have a markedly reduced
range of movement, particularly with external rotation. There are no associated neurological or vascular deﬁcits. Radiographs of the shoulder are normal with no evidence of
a fracture or avascular necrosis of the humeral head.

ANSWER 44
The diagnosis is a ‘frozen shoulder’, characterized by a global reduction in the range
of movement and normal X-rays. This term was introduced by Codman in 1934. He
described a painful shoulder condition of insidious onset that was associated with stiffness and difﬁculty sleeping on the affected side. Codman also identiﬁed the marked
reduction in forward elevation and external rotation that are the hallmarks of the disease.
In 1945, Naviesar coined the term ‘adhesive capsulitis’.
Frozen shoulder typically has three phases: the painful phase, the stiffening phase and the
thawing phase. During the initial phase there is a gradual onset of diffuse shoulder pain
lasting from weeks to months. The stiffening phase is characterized by a progressive loss
of motion that may last up to a year. The majority of patients lose glenohumeral external rotation, internal rotation and abduction during this phase. The ﬁnal, thawing phase
ranges from weeks to months and constitutes a period of gradual motion improvement.
Once in this phase, the patient may require up to 9 months to regain a fully functional
range of motion.
There is a higher incidence of frozen shoulder in patients with diabetes compared with
the general population. The incidence among patients with insulin-dependent diabetes is
even higher, with an increased frequency of bilateral frozen shoulder. Adhesive capsulitis
has also been reported in patients with hyperthyroidism, ischaemic heart disease, and
cervical spondylosis.
Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended in the initial treatment phase. On reducing the inﬂammation and pain, the patient should be able to tolerate physical therapy. A subgroup of patients with frozen shoulder syndrome often fail to
improve despite conservative measures. In these cases, interventions such as manipulation, distension arthrography or open surgical release may be beneﬁcial.
KEY POINTS

• Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) is a painful shoulder condition of insidious onset
with stiffness.

• There are three phases: painful, stiffening and thawing.
• The incidence is raised in diabetics.
• The majority of cases resolve with conservative management.

CASE 45:

ELBOW PAIN (1)

History
A 40-year-old right-handed mechanic has been working long days and starts to develop
pain in the lateral aspect of his right elbow. The pain is worst when he is at work and it
is affecting his ability to work properly, so he goes to see his general practitioner.
Examination
This man’s pain is localized to the lateral epicondyle of his elbow. There is no obvious
swelling or deformity. On palpation there is a point of maximal tenderness just distal to
the lateral epicondyle. Wrist extension and supination against resistance produces pain.
His pain is reproduced on extension/ﬂexion of his affected wrist.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What further investigations are commonly undertaken in this condition?
• What are the management options?

125

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 45
The diagnosis is work-related lateral epicondylitis (commonly called ‘tennis elbow’). It is
an overuse injury involving the extensor muscles that originate on the lateral epicondylar region of the distal humerus. It is more properly termed a tendinosis that speciﬁcally involves the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. Histologically, the
tendons are invaded with vascular granulation tissue and ﬁbroblasts. There is notable
absence of inﬂammatory cells in the affected area.
Any activity involving wrist extension and/or supination can be associated with overuse
of the muscles originating at the lateral epicondyle. Tennis has been the activity most
commonly associated with the disorder. For work-related lateral epicondylitis, a systematic review identiﬁed three risk factors: handling tools heavier than 1 kg, handling loads
heavier than 20 kg at least ten times per day, and repetitive movements for more than
two hours per day
X-rays of the affected elbow are usually normal but in chronic cases can show calciﬁcation of the origin of the affected tendon (extensor carpi radialis brevis, ECRB). MRI is
helpful to exclude any ligamentous or tendinous injury to the elbow. Also, MRI can help
conﬁrm the presence of degenerative tissue in the ECRB origin. Ultrasonography of the
elbow is a reasonable alternative to MRI if expertise is available.
Anaesthetic injections into the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis can help conﬁrm the diagnosis, as the patient should experience relief from symptoms.
Up to 95 per cent of patients with tennis elbow respond to conservative measures. The
goal is cessation of the offending activity. Rest, use of a counterforce brace, and nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often provide relief. Often, wrist splinting is
necessary. Both corticosteroid and autologous blood injections have been shown to be
effective. Corticosteroid injections at the lateral epicondyle have been shown to signiﬁcantly decrease pain and would be recommended in the present case of an active worker.
When the patient is free of pain through a full range of motion, begin strengthening
therapy in a very slow and progressive way. When the patient regains strength and
resumption of activity, place the emphasis of treatment on preventing future irritation.
If the present case were unresponsive to conservative therapy over 6 months (including corticosteroid injections), he would be eligible for surgery. Most surgical procedures
involve debridement of the diseased tissue of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle
with decortication of the lateral epicondyle. This procedure can be performed through
open, percutaneous and arthroscopic approaches.
KEY POINTS

• Tennis elbow involves the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle.
• Any activity involving wrist extension and/or supination can be associated with this
condition.

• X-rays are usually normal but can show calcification of the affected tendon. MRI or
ultrasonography are useful investigations in this condition.

• Anaesthetic injections into the origin of the ECRB muscle can help confirm the
diagnosis.

• Most patients respond to conservative management.

ELBOW PAIN (2)

History
A 25-year-old vintage-car mechanic has been extremely busy preparing a ﬂeet of cars
for an exhibition. He has developed severe pain over the medial aspect of his right elbow
which is limiting his ability to work, so he visits his general practitioner. He reports that
this is not the ﬁrst time this pain has occurred.
Examination
This young man’s pain is localized to the medial epicondyle of his right elbow. He has
tenderness to palpation over the anterior aspect of the medial epicondyle. There is no
obvious swelling or deformity of the elbow and no muscle wasting. Elbow range of
movement and neurovascular examination are normal. Pain over the medial epicondyle
is aggravated with resisted wrist ﬂexion and pronation.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What further examinations and investigations are commonly undertaken in this
condition?
• What are the management options?

127

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 46
The diagnosis is medial epicondylitis (commonly called ‘golfer’s elbow’). It typically
presents with pain on the medial aspect of the elbow associated with an exacerbation
of pain in resisted wrist ﬂexion. This condition was ﬁrst described in 1882 by Henry J.
Morris and is classiﬁed as an overuse syndrome. The ﬂexor carpi radialis and the pronator teres are commonly involved at the insertion of the medial epicondyle; the muscles
less commonly involved are the palmaris longus, the ﬂexor digitorum superﬁcialis, and
the ﬂexor carpi ulnaris.
This condition is seen most commonly in sports involving repetitive valgus stress, ﬂexion
and pronation, such as occurs in golf and baseball. Ulnar neuropathy may be associated in approximately half of cases. Magnetic resonance images and histology show the
presence of micro-tears in the ﬂexor–pronator tendons without inﬂammation. Medial
epicondylitis is more common in men and the peak incidences are in the third and ﬁfth
decades of life.
X-rays of the affected elbow are usually normal but can show calciﬁcation at the affected
tendon’s origin. MRI is sensitive and speciﬁc in the evaluation of medial epicondylitis. This modality allows assessment of the tendons, ulnar nerve and medial collateral
ligament. For conﬁrmation of the diagnosis, a local anaesthetic can be injected into the
medial epicondyle over the area of maximal tenderness; complete relief of pain should
be expected.
In the majority of cases, conservative management works and should be the initial treatment. The ﬁrst step is to identify and restrict the activities that cause the pain. Changes
in working conditions or sporting activities can help. Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy and an epicondylar band over the forearm muscles to
reduce force transmission to the tendons are helpful. Return to regular activities should be
progressive to minimize the chances of recurrence. Steroid inﬁltration can be considered
after failed conservative management. Surgery is considered if conservative measures
fail after 6–12 months. It involves release of the muscle group origin from the tendon.

A PAINFUL WRIST

History
A 50-year-old woman working as a medical secretary has been involved with converting
a paper records system to an electronic system. She has been lifting and carrying a lot of
heavy boxes of ﬁles as part of this. Now she has developed progressive pain in the dorsal/
radial aspect of the base of her right wrist and radial styloid.
Examination
This woman has swelling over the dorsoradial aspect of her left wrist. On palpation, she
has some palpable thickening in the same region and tenderness over the styloid process
of the distal radius. When the patient is asked to make a ﬁst over the thumb and ulna
deviate the wrist (Fig. 47.1), she reports increased pain in the region of the radial styloid.
She has no neurological or vascular deﬁcits.

129

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 47
This condition is called De Quervain’s tenosynovitis, ﬁrst described in 1895. It is characterized by a history of repetitive strain, and dorsoradial pain exacerbated by ulna
deviation of the wrist. There is reactive thickening of the sheath around the ﬁrst extensor
compartment of the wrist. The tendons of the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor
pollicis brevis pass through the ﬁrst dorsal compartment. The ﬁrst dorsal compartment
over the radial styloid becomes thickened and feels bone hard; the area becomes tender.
The exact cause of this problem is not clear. Overuse can initiate it, but it can occur
spontaneously, particularly in middle-aged women and sometimes during pregnancy.
The classic manoeuvre to diagnose this condition is achieved using the Finkelstein test.
This involves making a ﬁst over the thumb and moving the wrist into ulna deviation, as
shown in Fig. 47.1. The pain is reproduced in the region of the radial styloid.
The differential diagnosis includes the following.
• Arthritis at the base of the thumb. The grind test will be negative in DeQuervain’s but
positive in degenerative joint disease affecting the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. The
grind test is performed by pushing the thumb against the CMC joint while also rotating it to produce a grinding-type motion. If in doubt, radiographs of the ﬁrst CMC
joint may reveal degenerative changes.
• Intersection syndrome. This can arise if the tendons of the ﬁrst wrist compartment
cross over the tendons of the second compartment just proximal to the extensor retinaculum. This causes irritation between the tendons just proximal to the wrist joint.
• Wartenberg’s syndrome. This is an isolated neuritis of the superﬁcial radial nerve.
These patients have a positive Tinel sign and complain of pain over the dorsoradial
aspect of the wrist.
Conservative management initially involves a thumb spica splint, or a cast for a month
with a steroid injection into the ﬁrst extensor compartment sheath. Surgical release of the
ﬁrst extensor tendon sheath with synovectomy is considered for persistent or recurrent
De Quervains’s disease. Ensure that the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor pollicis
brevis are released.
KEY POINTS

• De Quervain’s tenosynovitis involves reactive thickening of the sheath around the first
•
•

130

extensor compartment of the wrist. The tendons affected are abductor pollicis longus
and the extensor pollicis brevis.
A positive Finkelstein test helps to confirm the diagnosis.
Initial management involves a splint plus a steroid injection. Surgical treatment in
persistent or recurrent cases involves release of the first extensor tendon sheath.

A DEFORMED FINGER

History
A 55-year-old woman with diabetes was trying to do some knitting when she noticed that
one of her right ﬁngers was painful and intermittently stiff. She went to see her general
practitioner for an explanation. She has no history of trauma. She reports she has difﬁculty achieving a full range of movement of the ﬁnger and complains of painful clicking
of the ﬁnger when she tries to make a ﬁst.
Examination
This woman’s ﬁnger remains ﬂexed at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint even
when she tries to unclench her ﬁst (Fig. 48.1), but with further effort the ﬁnger suddenly extends fully with a snap. At the level of the distal palmar crease she has a nodule
that is tender to palpation over the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. On attempting to
straighten the affected ﬁnger, a painful click is elicited when the ﬁnger is fully extended.

Figure 48.1

Questions:
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you manage this condition?

131

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 48
The diagnosis is ‘trigger ﬁnger’, a name chosen because typically the ﬁnger suddenly
extends fully with a snap. It results from thickening of the ﬂexor tendon within the distal
aspect of the palm. The gliding of the ﬂexor tendon within the tendon sheath is affected.
This results in abrupt ﬂexion of the ﬁnger. There is often tenderness over the A1 pulley
(a ﬁbrous structure located at the MCP joint through which the ﬂexor tendon passes) and
intermittent restriction to ﬂexion and extension of the ﬁnger. A nodule may develop on
the tendon causing the tendon to get stuck in the pulley when attempting to extend the
digit. Trigger digits are most commonly seen in adults aged between 50 and 60 years, and
less commonly can be seen in congenital cases affecting the thumb in children.
In the majority of cases a steroid inﬁltration into the affected tendon sheath can give
symptomatic relief. Splinting of the ﬁnger can help in reducing inﬂammation. Digits that
fail to respond to two or three injections may beneﬁt from surgery. Surgical release of the
A1 ﬂexor pulley will allow the inﬂamed tendon to pass through and relieve symptoms.
Congenital cases do not respond to injections and require surgical intervention.
KEY POINTS

• Gliding of the flexor tendon within the tendon sheath is affected in trigger finger.
• Often there is tenderness over the A1 pulley. A nodule may develop on the tendon,
causing the tendon to get stuck in the pulley.

• A steroid infiltration into the affected tendon sheath can give symptomatic relief in the
majority of cases. Digits that fail to respond to 2–3 injections may benefit from surgical
release of the A1 pulley.

133

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 49
This man has Dupuytren’s disease of the palmar fascia, ﬁrst described by Baron Guillaume
Dupuytren (1777–1835). The condition can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.
The clinical features are nodular thickening in the palm, with ﬂexion contractures at
the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints as show in
Fig. 49.1. Dorsal knuckle pads may be thickened (Garrod’s pad) and both hands may be
involved. Typically it is painless.
Dupuytren’s contracture is a benign, slowly progressive ﬁbroproliferative disease of the
palmar fascia. After the initial proliferative phase the ﬁbrous tissue and fascial bands
within the ﬁngers contract causing ﬂexion deformity of the ﬁngers at the MCP and PIP
joints, and rarely the distal (DIP) joint. The MCP joint contracture may be caused by a
pretendinous cord or by contracture of the spiral band. PIP joint contractures are caused
by the central and spiral cords and the thumb may show a ﬂexion deformity. Abduction
may be limited in the ﬁngers as the natatory ligament becomes contracted. The disease
presents most commonly in the ring and little ﬁngers and is bilateral in 45 per cent of
cases. The ﬁbrous attachment to the skin causes the puckering. Similar nodules may be
seen on the sole of the foot (Ledderhose disease) and in ﬁbrosis of the corpus cavernosum
(Peyronie disease).
A more aggressive form of the disease is associated with a positive family history, onset
before the age of 40 years, bilateral involvement, involvement of the radial digits and
ectopic disease (feet and penis).
Dupuytren’s disease is more common in males and people of northern European origin.
It can be associated with prior hand trauma, alcoholic cirrhosis, epilepsy (due to medications such as phenytoin) and diabetes. The prevalence increases with age.
Mild cases may not need any treatment. Surgery is indicated in progressive contractures
and established deformity – as in this case. Surgical excision of the diseased fascia (fasciectomy) is the treatment of choice. Recurrence or extension of the disease after operation is not uncommon, particularly in patients with associated ﬁbrosis (Ledderhose and
Peyronie). Surgery is generally indicated for MCP joint contractures of 20–30 degrees.
Any degree of ﬂexion contracture of the PIP joint is an indication for surgery. The operation will involve either a fasciotomy (incising the fascia only), fasciectomy (removing as
much fascia as possible), dermofasciectomy (removing the diseased fascia and overlying
skin), or regional fasciectomy (excising only the involved fascia).
KEY POINTS

• Dupuytren’s contracture is a slowly progressive fibroproliferative disease of the palmar
fascia. It presents most commonly in the ring and little fingers.

• Look for nodular thickening in the palm, flexion contractures at the MCP and PIP
joints, and Garrod’s pad.

• It is associated with prior hand trauma, alcoholic cirrhosis, epilepsy (due to
medications such as phenytoin) and diabetes.

• Surgery is indicated in progressive contracture and established deformity.

135

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 50
The diagnosis is a scaphoid fracture. This diagnosis is more likely in the presence of
tenderness to palpation in the anatomical snuffbox and on the volar scaphoid tubercle.
A special provocative manoeuvre is known as the Watson (scaphoid shift) test. Place the
patients’ wrist into full ulna deviation and extension. Press the patient’s thumb with his
other hand and move the wrist into radial deviation and ﬂexion. If the scaphoid and
lunate are unstable, the dorsal pole of the scaphoid subluxes over the dorsal rim of the
radius and the patient complains of pain – indicating a positive test.
The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone, being involved in up to 75
per cent of all carpal fractures. Scaphoid waist fractures are the most common type
(65 per cent), followed by proximal pole fractures (30 per cent). Scaphoid fractures are
uncommon in children because the physis of the distal radius usually fails ﬁrst. In elderly
patients, the distal radial metaphysis usually fails before the scaphoid can fracture.
The scaphoid is an irregularly shaped bone of which 80 per cent is covered by articular
cartilage. The scaphoid ﬂexes with wrist ﬂexion and radial deviation and it extends
during wrist extension and ulnar deviation. Anatomically, the scaphoid is divided into
proximal, middle (termed the waist) and distal thirds. Most of the blood supply to the
scaphoid enters distally. The proximal part of the scaphoid has no blood vessels entering
it, depending instead on vessels that pierce the mid-portion in a retrograde direction,
thereby placing the proximal pole at increased risk of avascular necrosis when fractured.
Scaphoid X-rays preferably include a posteroanterior (PA) view, a true lateral view, an
oblique view, and a PA ulnar-deviated view. The PA in ulnar deviation allows viewing
of the scaphoid in extension, while the lateral view allows an evaluation of instability.
When the scaphoid is destabilized via ligament disruption or fracture, the lunate and
triquetrum may excessively dorsiﬂex and yield a dorsal intercalary segment instability
(DISI) deformity. Occasionally, a fractured scaphoid is not visible on the initial radiographs. In such cases, a repeat X-ray in 10–14 days may reveal a fracture line after some
resorption. If a diagnosis still cannot be conﬁrmed with conﬁdence on routine ﬁlms, MRI
of the wrist is recommended. While CT scanning is useful in assessing union, fractures
with less than 1 mm of displacement are often not detected.
Non-union is not uncommon as a complication after scaphoid fractures because the blood
supply to this bone is poor. Smokers have a higher incidence of non-union. Occasionally,
the blood supply is poor enough to lead to avascular necrosis. If non-union is not
detected, subsequent arthritis in the wrist can develop. Imaging using a combination of
plain X-rays, MRI and/or CT can help conﬁrm a non-union and avascular necrosis. If the
scaphoid fails to unite, consider a bone graft. A graft can be harvested locally from the
same forearm or from the iliac crest. Sometimes it is necessary to use a bone graft with
its own blood supply (a vascularized graft).
KEY POINTS

• Scaphoid waist fractures are the most common type (65 per cent), followed by
•

•
•

proximal pole fractures.
Clinical examination reveals tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox.
A special test is Watson’s provocative manoeuvre.

137

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 51
This elderly woman’s diagnosis is bronchopneumonia with a septic arthritis. Septic
arthritis is an orthopaedic emergency. This patient is already tachycardic, hypotensive
and hypoxic and needs prompt assessment, diagnosis and management by medical and
surgical teams. The diagnosis hinges on the detection of bacteria in the synovial ﬂuid,
and a joint aspiration with microbiological evaluation of the aspirate is critical.
Patients with septic arthritis are typically unwell with fevers and malaise and the joint
pain is severe. Risk factors for the development of septic arthritis are:
•
•
•
•

abnormal, damaged or prosthetic joints
concurrent or recent bacterial infection
immunocompromise
extremes of age.

The patient presented here has several clearly identiﬁable risk factors: current infection,
relative immunocompromise in the form of diabetes, and advanced age.
Septic arthritis is divided into non-gonococcal (80 per cent of cases) and gonococcal
disease. Within non-gonococcal septic arthritis, the most common organisms isolated
are Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Gram-negative bacilli. These causative organisms reach the joint through direct inoculation, spread from neighbouring infected tissue (e.g. osteomyelitis, cellulitis) or haematogenous spread during bacteraemia, which
is the likely scenario in this case. Gonococcal disease occurs in sexually active groups
and tends to present with a more polyarticular, migratory pattern, tenosynovitis and a
rash; the precipitating infection may be asymptomatic, particularly in women. It can be
hard to diagnose as even synovial ﬂuid cultures have a low positive yield, with up to
75 per cent of cultures being negative. It is also important to remember that gonococcal
arthritis is not the same as reactive arthritis following genitourinary infection; the latter
is an inﬂammatory reaction to extra-articular infection and is often managed with local
intra-articular steroid injections.
The treatment of choice in septic arthritis is antibiotic therapy which should be commenced as soon as possible. In the absence of deﬁnitive culture results, the best initial
choice would be a broad-spectrum antibiotic with activity against the most likely culprits
(such as a second-generation cephalosporin). Antimicrobial therapy can then be adjusted
according to culture results and sensitivities. Cartilage is highly susceptible to damage
from infected synovial ﬂuid, so a surgical washout may be required, particularly if the
hip is involved. Antibiotic therapy should be continued for 4–6 weeks.
KEY POINTS

• Any acutely hot or painful joint is septic arthritis until proven otherwise.
• Investigation of choice is aspiration of the joint fluid and microbiological assessment.
• In likely cases of septic arthritis, commence antibiotic therapy as soon as possible.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 52
The diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common of the inﬂammatory
arthropathies. Her symptoms of early-morning stiffness and pain, combined with softtissue rather than bony swelling, are classic patterns for inﬂammatory disease. Although,
as in this case, RA affects principally the small joints of the hands (and feet), it may
progress to involve any synovial joint and may be complicated by extra-articular features (see below). Her possible family history for RA is not unusual due to the presence
of susceptibility genes such as HLA-DR.
The thrombocytosis, elevated inﬂammatory markers and normocytic anaemia seen here
are very common in patients with active disease. Rheumatoid factor, a self-reactive IgG,
is detected in up to 70 per cent of RA patients, and the presence of rheumatoid nodules
on examination indicates such seropositivity and a worse prognosis. RF has relatively
low speciﬁcity and is found in other inﬂammatory conditions (e.g. Sjögren’s syndrome,
cryoglobulinaemia), certain infections and apparently healthy individuals. ACPA, however, offers a greater speciﬁcity and may become positive before the development of
symptoms. The X-ray of her hand reveals many of the cardinal features of established
RA: soft-tissue swelling, periarticular osteopenia, joint space narrowing and bony erosions (in this case particularly affecting the third and fourth PIPs). There is also evidence
of joint destruction and ankylosis in the carpal bones.

Post-infective arthritis following streptococcal or viral infection
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the presence of pronounced extra-articular
symptoms and a positive ANA
Parvovirus arthropathy, particularly in those with contact with small children

Parvovirus arthropathy is classically short-lived (<6 weeks), with normal radiology and
immunology (beyond IgM antibodies to parvovirus).
Treatment of RA involves a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Specialist nurses, occupational
therapists and physiotherapists are invaluable sources of support, advice, education and
treatment and this patient should be referred immediately. Medical therapy focuses on
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, sulphasalazine,
leﬂunomide and hydroxychloroquine which may be used individually or in combination.
Many are contraindicated in pregnancy and breast-feeding and this should be speciﬁcally
discussed as the patient is of child-bearing age. DMARD therapy also necessitates regular
blood monitoring as many are potentially myelosuppressive or hepatotoxic. All DMARDs
take up to 3 months to have full clinical effect, so she should be offered an intramuscular
injection of steroid as immediate treatment for her acute inﬂammatory symptoms.
If she fails to respond to standard DMARDs, ‘biologic’ (i.e. monoclonal antibody) treatment against pathogenic cytokines or cells could be used. The most common biologic
agent is anti-TNF-a; inﬂiximab, adalimumab, golimumab and certolizumab are monoclonal antibodies directed against the TNF-a molecule, whereas etanercept is an Fc fusion
protein and acts as a ‘decoy’ receptor for TNF-a. If she still suffers from active disease
despite anti-TNF-a treatment, anti-B-cell (rituximab), anti-T-cell (abatacept) or anti-IL-6
receptor (tocilizumab) therapy are alternative therapeutic options.

CASE 53:

BACK PAIN IN A YOUNG MAN

History
A 26-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of back and buttock pain and stiffness. His symptoms localize to his lumbar spine and right buttock and are particularly
marked ﬁrst thing in the morning, but start to settle within a couple of hours. The pain
never spreads down the back of the leg and he has not noticed any change in sensation
or loss of power. He is otherwise ﬁt and well, with the exception of two episodes of an
acutely painful red eye for which he received ‘eye drops’ from the ophthalmology service.
He is self-employed with two children and smokes heavily.
Examination
This young man has dramatically reduced lumbar spinal movements in all planes but
cervical movements are full and pain-free. His right hip is irritable with reduced range of
movement, particularly external rotation. There is a small effusion of the left knee with
evidence of Achilles tendinopathy and plantar fasciitis on the left foot. The remainder of
his examination is normal. MRI of the lumbosacral spine and sacroiliac joints are shown
in Figs 53.1 and 53.2.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 53
The patient’s symptoms are a classic description of inﬂammatory spinal disease (spondyloarthropathy) and sacroiliitis. In addition he has evidence of peripheral arthropathy,
tendinopathy, possible extra-articular symptoms in the form of previous ocular disease,
and an elevated inﬂammatory response. The most likely unifying cause of these symptoms and signs is ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The presence of the MHC molecule HLAB27 is supportive but not diagnostic of this disease: although more than 95 per cent of
patients with AS are B27-positive, up to 10 per cent of the normal population is also
B27-positive in the absence of spinal disease.

!

Major differential diagnoses of spondyloarthropathy

• Ankylosing spondylitis (prototypical spondyloarthritis), most common in males
under 35 years of age

• Psoriatic arthropathy
• Enteropathic, associated with inflammatory bowel disease, but unrelated to
disease activity

• Reactive arthritis following genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection
Diagnostic confusion may be caused by overlapping symptom complexes between
spondyloarthropathies (e.g. red eye, rash, gastrointestinal upset), and some patients do
not ﬁt neatly into one diagnostic category, being described as having undifferentiated
spinal disease.
This patient’s MRI highlights areas of high water content (joint inﬂammation and bone
oedema) and shows typical features of AS: the corners of the lumbar vertebrae are ‘shiny’
with oedema and there is symmetrical inﬂammatory change at the sacroiliac joints with
irregularity of the joint space. The inﬂammation leads to symptoms of pain and stiffness,
while ﬁbrosis and ossiﬁcation at these sites generates signs of increasing spinal restriction. One such clinical measure of spinal restriction is Schober’s index: two marks on
the lumbar spine 15 cm apart (5 cm below and 10 cm above the posterior superior iliac
spines) should increase to >20 cm apart on forward ﬂexion; lateral spinal ﬂexion and
cervical neck movements should also be assessed regularly. In late-stage disease, patients
may develop a ‘question-mark’ posture with loss of lumbar lordosis, exaggerated thoracic
kyphosis and hyperextension at the neck. Complete spinal fusion (ankylosis) may occur
and is surprisingly painless, unless microfractures develop due to spinal rigidity and
concomitant osteoporosis.
Although AS is dominated by axial disease, large-joint peripheral arthropathy (hip and
knee), enthesopathy and tendinopathy may also develop. Extra-articular features include
anterior uveitis, which occurs in up to 40 per cent of patients (with no relation to spinal
disease activity), apical pulmonary ﬁbrosis and aortic regurgitation.
Treatment for AS focuses on physiotherapy and non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs). In view of the risk of chest wall fusion following costochondritis or costovertebritis and possible restrictive lung disease, this patient must also be advised to give up
smoking. If, despite regular NSAID use, he still experiences marked symptoms and has
objective serological and/or radiological evidence of ongoing inﬂammatory disease, antiTNF-a therapy is indicated.

144

Rheumatology
KEY POINTS

• Ankylosing spondylitis is the most common cause of inflammatory spinal pain.
• HLA-B27 is not a diagnostic test.
• The investigation of choice is an MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine and sacroiliac
joints.

• Treatment is physiotherapy, NSAIDs and anti-TNF-a in the presence of refractory
disease.

CASE 54:

CLUMSINESS

History
A 64-year-old man is referred urgently by his general practitioner with acute neuropathy.
Two days prior to presentation the patient awoke to ﬁnd himself unable to lift his right
foot and toes while walking, such that he kept tripping. Over the next 24 hours he found
he had lost control of his left thumb and could not grip things properly. His problems
were associated with altered sensation in his hand and foot. His past medical history is
entirely unremarkable.
Examination
This man has a high steppage gait and inability to dorsiﬂex the right foot and walk on
his heels only. Sensation is also diminished over the top of the foot and ankle. In the left
hand, there is loss of abduction and opposition of the thumb and reduced sensation in
the lateral three and a half digits.
Questions
• What is the cause of these symptoms?
• What further investigations would be appropriate?

147

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 54
This patient has complete loss of median and common peroneal nerve function. The
abruptness of the onset and anatomically distinct nature of the loss suggests an intrinsic
nerve problem rather than a compressive neuropathy. The diagnosis is therefore mononeuritis multiplex – the loss of motor and sensory function of multiple individual
peripheral nerves. Mononeuritis multiplex arises due to interruption of the vasa
nervorum, the blood supply to peripheral nerves, and one of the most common causes
for this is vasculitis (another major cause is diabetes mellitus, but not relevant in this
particular case).
Vasculitis – inﬂammation of blood vessels and subsequent obstruction to blood ﬂow –
can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary, in which case it is associated with an underlying condition such as rheumatoid arthritis. Primary vasculitis is divided clinically
according to the size of the vessel involved (see the box).

!

Clinical classification of idiopathic vasculitis
Large vessel

Giant cell (temporal) arteritis

Medium vessel

Polyarteritis nodosa

Takayasu’s arteritis
Kawasaki’s disease
Small vessel

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated:
Wegener’s granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis
Churg–Strauss syndrome (may be ANCA-positive)
Immune-complex mediated
Cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis: hypersensitivity vasculitis
Henoch–Schönlein vasculitis

Mononeuritis multiplex can be caused by any of the medium or small vessel vasculitides
and the patient should be approached with this differential in mind. Speciﬁc clinical
features from each of the differential diagnoses should be sought in the history and
examination, bearing in mind that there will be considerable overlap; skin involvement,
for example, is very common in all types of vasculitis. More discriminating features
would include:
•
•
•
•

livedo reticularis, back pain, testicular pain in polyarteritis nodosa
sinus or audiovestibular disease in Wegener’s granulomatosis
adult-onset asthma or nasal polyps in Churg–Strauss syndrome
abdominal pain and rectal bleeding in Henoch–Schönlein vasculitis.

Investigations in patients with suspected vasculitis should be chosen to conﬁrm the
diagnosis and deﬁne the extent and severity of organ involvement. Many of the investigations listed in the box would be appropriate in this patient. A crucial investigation in
cases of mononeuritis multiplex is nerve biopsy and a common site for this procedure is
the sural nerve.

and physiotherapy to maximize physical function.

BACK PAIN AND THIRST IN AN ELDERLY MAN

History
A 72-year-old man is admitted to the emergency department with severe back pain. It
started suddenly when he stepped awkwardly off his kitchen step, but he denies falling
or direct injury to his spine. Apart from some vague discomfort in the back of his pelvis
and hips for the last few months he has never had problems with his joints. On direct
questioning, however, he does admit to some weight loss and feeling tired and ‘washed
out’. In addition he has been more thirsty than normal over the last few weeks, and he
also complains of urinary frequency and nocturia.
Examination
This man is well but pale and in pain. He has marked bony tenderness over T11/12. His
pelvis is not tender and his hips move freely. Neurological examination is normal. All
other systems are also normal. Radiographs are shown in Figs 55.1 and 55.2.

151

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 55
This elderly man has presented with acute back pain and associated bony tenderness;
an X-ray is therefore an appropriate investigation to attempt to identify a fracture, and
to investigate the more longstanding pelvic/hip pain. The lateral spine X-ray demonstrates compression fractures at T11 and T12 which occurred after only minimal impact
(suggesting skeletal fragility), and careful scrutiny of the whole spine reveals profound
generalized osteopenia. In addition, the pelvic X-ray demonstrates well-deﬁned lytic
lesions throughout the pelvis and proximal femurs. The patient’s blood tests demonstrate
a marked normocytic anaemia (explaining his fatigue) and slightly reduced white cell
and platelet counts, which therefore suggests a possible marrow disorder. His calcium
is raised (resulting in thirst and nocturia) which may suggest a longstanding process
affecting bone. Finally, the ESR is very elevated in the presence of a normal CRP, which
might suggest a haematological process affecting erythrocyte sedimentation rather than
a systemic inﬂammatory response. His renal impairment is pre-renal, which suggests an
element of dehydration.
In summary, this elderly man has a combination of a normocytic anaemia, elevated calcium and a markedly elevated ESR plus widespread profound osteoporosis, lytic lesions
and vertebral fractures. The most likely diagnosis is therefore multiple myeloma, a
malignant proliferation of plasma cells (B-cells) which generates large quantities of antibody (immunoglobulin). The abnormal cell line threatens normal blood cell production
which may lead to anaemia, leucopenia and/or thrombocytopenia; it induces enhanced
osteoclast activity leading to osteoporosis, increased risk of fracture and hypercalcaemia,
and the circulating light chains impair erythrocyte sedimentation, causing an isolated
elevation of ESR and not the CRP. The main causes of renal impairment in myeloma are
two-fold: not only does the elevation in serum calcium cause an osmotic diuresis and
dehydration, but also the abnormal light chains may cause direct renal tubular damage.
A number of solid tumours (notably breast, lung, thyroid and kidney) may metastasize
to bone; they may also produce an elevated calcium either through direct bony destruction or production of parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP). However, the overall
picture in this case with evidence of marrow involvement suggests that myeloma is the
most likely diagnosis.
The initial investigation of choice is immunoglobulins, serum electrophoresis and assessment of Bence–Jones protein (immunoglobulin light chains) in the urine. Patients with
myeloma demonstrate a monoclonal gammopathy – classically IgG – with immune paresis (i.e. suppression of other immunoglobulins). The diagnostic test is bone marrow biopsy
which reveals abnormal proliferation of plasma cells.
The immediate management of this patient would include:
• transfusion for anaemia
• rehydration for renal impairment
• rehydration and (if necessary bisphosphonates) for hypercalcaemia.
The patient should be referred to the haematology department for further treatment.
Melphalan and prednisolone may induce a partial remission. High-dose chemotherapy
with bone marrow transplantation may prolong survival but is not routinely offered to
those over the age of 55 years as the associated mortality rate of the therapy is up to 40
per cent.

152

Rheumatology
KEY POINTS

• The combination of bone pain and elevated ESR and calcium is suggestive of multiple
myeloma.

• Myeloma is an important cause of osteoporosis.
• Screening tests for myeloma are immunoglobulins, serum electrophoresis and Bence–
Jones protein in the urine.

• Myeloma is diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy.

CASE 56:

ACUTE BACK PAIN

History
A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute back pain. She
stumbled off a step and, although she denies falling or receiving direct trauma to the
spine, she developed acute and severe mid-thoracic pain immediately afterwards. Her past
medical history is unremarkable. She admits to drinking up to 30 units of alcohol a week
and smokes 30 cigarettes per day.
Examination
This woman is thin and in considerable pain. The pain is central with no radiation. There
are no peripheral stigmata of systemic disease and cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal
and neurological examinations are normal. She has a marked kyphosis and has point
tenderness over several thoracic vertebrae. A radiograph is shown in Fig. 56.1.

Figure 56.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What risk factors for this disorder does she already have, and what other factors
should be specifically sought in the history?
• How would you investigate and manage this patient?

155

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 56
Although a number of medical and surgical conditions can give rise to pain radiating to
the back, this patient’s pain is reproducible by pressure on the vertebral bodies, suggesting
a bony origin for her symptoms, and the X-ray reveals several so-called wedge fractures
of the vertebral bodies at the sites of maximal tenderness. Given the injury was sustained
following minimal and indirect impact, one must consider skeletal fragility in this case.
Skeletal fragility may be localized due to a malignant deposit giving rise to a pathological
fracture (and given her smoking history this might be a possibility), but reassuringly there
is no radiological evidence of a lytic destructive lesion around the fractures. Nonetheless
it would be appropriate to look for a history of cough or haemoptysis and to enquire
about recent weight loss or whether she has always been slim. If there were any suggestive symptoms in her history you should consider performing a chest X-ray. Otherwise
(and since there is no radiological evidence of a bony malignancy) the most likely explanation of fracture in this case is widespread skeletal fragility due to osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue with increase in bone fragility and susceptibility
to fracture. Bone mass or mineral density relies on a balance of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. Overall it peaks in adulthood and then declines from 35 years of age
onwards, accelerating in women following the menopause. Postmenopausal bone loss is
the most common cause of osteoporosis, but secondary osteoporosis may occur in the
context of a number of medical conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

postmenopausal oestrogen deﬁciency (most common cause)
amenorrhoea
iatrogenic (corticosteroid therapy)
endocrine (hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Cushing’s disease, hypopituitarism,
hypogonadism)
malabsorption (e.g. coeliac disease)
osteomalacia
multiple myeloma
inﬂammatory arthropathy (probably due to elevated IL-1 and/or TNF-a).

This patient has a number of risk factors for osteoporosis in the form of a low body mass
index (BMI) and a history of smoking and excess alcohol. The major risk factors that
should be speciﬁcally sought in the history of a patient with suspected osteoporosis are:
•
•
•
•

maternal family history of hip fracture
oestrogen deﬁciency (e.g. premature menopause, prolonged secondary amenorrhoea)
corticosteroid therapy with a prednisolone dose >7.5 mg/day for over 6 months
low BMI (<19 kg/m2), due to a combination of reduced oestrogen levels and reduction
in impact loading
• smoking and excess alcohol
• anorexia nervosa
• prolonged immobilization.
Osteoporosis is diagnosed and severity determined using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or DEXA scan. This compares bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine
and proximal femur with that of the young normal mean – the T score:
• Normal – BMD <1 standard deviation (SD) below young normal mean
• osteopenia – BMD 1–2.5 SDs below young normal mean

156

Rheumatology

• osteoporosis – BMD >2.5 SDs below young normal mean
• severe osteoporosis – as above plus previous fragility fracture.
The present patient should have a DEXA scan and, like any other patient with conﬁrmed
osteoporosis, should undergo screening investigations for the secondary causes of low
bone mass. Thyroid function tests, a myeloma screen, vitamin D level, bone and hormonal proﬁle would be considered essential.
The pain due to acute vertebral collapse can be severe and may require opiates; if persistent, vertebroplasty (the injection of bone cement directly into the fractured vertebral
body) may prove beneﬁcial. Osteoporosis treatment is aimed at reducing falls and skeletal
fragility. Lifestyle modiﬁcations such as weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation and
alcohol reduction are all critical.
Pharmacological treatment in the form of calcium supplementation and bisphosphonates
to reduce osteoclast activity is effective but compliance is typically poor. All patients
receiving corticosteroids should have bone protection as, for a given BMD, osteoporosis caused by steroids has the highest rate of fractures. Alternatives to bisphosphonate
therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis include selective oestrogen receptor modulators
(SERMs, e.g. raloxifene), strontium and teriparatide (a synthetic PTH). Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be beneﬁcial in primary prevention of osteoporosis but is not of
proven beneﬁt in established disease.
KEY POINTS

• Osteoporosis is a condition of low bone mineral density leading to skeletal fragility.
• The most common cause is postmenopausal oestrogen deficiency.
• Steroid-induced osteoporosis is a significant problem in medical practice. Never forget
bone protection in patients receiving corticosteroids!

ANSWER 57
This patient has a combination of bone pain and proximal myopathy. The normal CK suggests that it is not a primary muscle disorder and the biochemical picture of low vitamin
D and high PTH suggests vitamin D deﬁciency. The diagnosis is osteomalacia, a condition
of poor mineralization of bone and excessive osteoid. The symptoms of osteomalacia can
be very vague and the condition must be speciﬁcally considered to avoid missing the
diagnosis.

The most common cause of vitamin D deﬁciency is lack of sun exposure (UV radiation
on skin is necessary for its production from 7-dehydroxycholesterol precursor in the
skin) which is common in those who cover up due to religious reasons and those living
in institutions, including the elderly. Possible risk factors for osteomalacia in this case
are religious covering of the skin plus a high intake of chapati – the ﬂour used contains
phytanic acid which binds calcium and may therefore increase vitamin D requirements.
The causes of osteomalacia are listed below.

!

Causes of osteomalacia

• Low vitamin D: lack of sun exposure, poor oral intake
• Malabsorption: coeliac disease, gastrectomy, pancreatic insufficiency
• Renal disease: renal osteodystrophy, hypophosphataemic renal disease, Fanconi
syndrome, renal tubular acidosis

• Drugs: anticonvulsants (phenytoin and carbamazepine)
The differential diagnosis of osteomalacia is extensive and includes:
•
•
•
•
160

ﬁbromyalgia
osteoporosis
polymyalgia rheumatica

• rheumatoid arthritis
• multiple myeloma
• metastatic bone disease.

Rheumatology

The lack of inﬂammatory response and a normal CK is therefore very reassuring in the
assessment of a patient with possible osteomalacia.
Management of osteomalacia focuses on patient education. Only minimal sun exposure
(15 minutes of sunshine to face and hands/arms) is required to maintain vitamin D levels,
although those with darker skin will require longer exposure. Oily ﬁsh and certain supplemented cereals should be included in the diet wherever possible, but frank vitamin D
deﬁciency is treated with supplementation. Mild deﬁciency is treated with 800 iu vitamin
D daily, but more severe deﬁciency requires a high-dose oral bolus followed by standard
daily doses. All patients with vitamin D supplementation should also receive additional
calcium.
KEY POINTS

• Osteomalacia is due to vitamin D deficiency.
• The symptoms may be very non-specific.
• Osteomalacia is common in certain ethnic groups and those living in institutions.

ANSWER 58
This elderly man has a very abnormal pelvic X-ray with evidence of loss of trabeculae,
abnormally thickened bone and sclerosis. In combination with his history of bone pain
and an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the most likely diagnosis is Paget’s disease.
Paget’s disease is a condition of disordered bone remodelling with increased osteoclast
and osteoblast activity. Indeed, it is the accelerated osteoblast activity that gives rise
to the elevated ALP. Although most commonly asymptomatic, the bone architecture
in Paget’s is mosaic-like and mechanically weaker than normal bone; as a result, bone
deformities (e.g. tibial bowing) or spontaneous fractures may result. Paget’s bone is also
hypervascular and may feel warm to palpation. The majority of Paget’s (80 per cent) is
polyostotic, affecting several bones simultaneously; when the disease is isolated to a single site, the tibia and iliac bones are the most commonly affected areas.

!

Complications of Paget’s disease
Skeletal

Bone pain
Deformity (bowing, skull enlargement)
Fracture

Neurological (compression syndromes)

Deafness
Spinal or cranial nerve entrapment
Spinal stenosis

Cardiovascular

Hyperthermia and warmth of affected area
High-output congestive cardiac failure
Carotid steal syndrome (to Pagetic skull)

Malignant change

Osteogenic sarcoma

Metabolic

Hypercalcaemia (in the presence of fracture or
immobility)

The diagnosis of Paget’s disease is the combination of radiological and biochemical
abnormalities. Plain X-rays reveal mixtures of sclerotic and lytic lesions and signiﬁcant
trabecular thickening. ‘Osteoporosis circumscripta’ refers to extensive lytic disease affecting the skull. Full-body scintigraphy may be used to determine the extent of disease as
affected areas show marked increased uptake.
In practical terms, the main indication to treat Paget’s disease is pain – as in this case –
although bone deformity or compression syndromes (or risk thereof) would also prompt
therapy. The treatment of choice is a bisphosphonate to diminish osteoclast activity,
interrupting the vicious cycle of chaotic bone remodelling. Intravenous zolendronate is
highly effective in this regard and serum ALP and type 1 procollagen (P1NP) levels are
sensitive markers of bone formation and are suppressed during successful treatment.
Patients should be regularly reviewed for changes in symptoms or elevation of these
biochemical markers: either would be an indication for re-treatment.
KEY POINTS

• Paget’s disease may be diagnosed incidentally on X-ray.
• Treatment is for bone pain or other complications.
• The intravenous bisphosphonate zolendronate is the treatment of choice.

CASE 59:

KNEE PAIN IN AN ATHLETE

History
A 36-year-old recreational runner presents with anterior knee pain. She has recently
increased training in preparation for a marathon and runs exclusively on roads. A few
weeks prior to presentation she developed crescendo knee pain while running which
did not resolve when she stopped. The pain is now also present at rest. She is otherwise
well with no previous injuries but did experience 8 months of secondary amenorrhoea
due to overtraining in her early twenties. Since then her periods have been normal. She
does not smoke or drink and is on no regular medication although she has been taking
paracetamol for the pain.
Examination
This patient has a normal gait but is unable to hop on the affected side because of the
pain. There is an area of focal bony tenderness in the medial proximal tibia. Examination
of her knee and other joints is normal.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What is the investigation of choice?
• What is the differential diagnosis of anterior knee pain?
• How would you manage this patient?

165

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 59
The most likely diagnosis is a stress fracture of the proximal tibia. Stress fractures are
overuse injuries and occur when periosteal resorption exceeds bone formation. They are
commonly seen in two main patient groups: soldiers may suffer so-called march fractures
in the metatarsals, while athletes may develop them in different sites according to their
sporting activity. Although the knee is a common site in runners due to excess mechanical loading, stress fractures may also result in non-weight-bearing sites due to repetitive
and excessive traction (e.g. rib fractures in rowers due to traction from serratus anterior).
The classic symptom – as in this case – is of pain that occurs throughout running and
crucially persists with rest; this is in contrast to shin splints, a traction injury to the
tibial periosteum in which the pain diminishes somewhat with continued activity, only
to return again after the patient has stopped running.
The investigation of choice is CT or MRI as radiographs are frequently normal.
The differential diagnosis of anterior knee pain is extensive and includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

patellar maltracking and malalignment
chondromalacia patellae (a degenerative condition of patellar cartilage)
patellar tendinopathy
pre- or infrapatellar bursitis
meniscal damage
tight iliotibial band
referred pain from the hip or lumbosacral spine.

The management of stress fractures is rest until the pain has completely settled and
focal tenderness has resolved. For those with severe stress fractures in the lower limb,
an air-cast boot can offer support and assist in a gradual resumption of weight-bearing.
The crucial feature of rehabilitation is a graded return to sport to prevent progression or
recurrence. Patients with stress fractures should also undergo a thorough physiotherapy
assessment to identify and treat any predisposing biomechanical factors. In addition this
patient already has a history of overtraining and so one should remain alert for the development of the ‘female athlete triad’ of disordered eating, amenorrhoea and osteoporosis.
Many physicians would screen any stress fracture patient with a clinical assessment of
osteoporosis risk followed by a DEXA scan and assessment of serological bone proﬁle
(calcium, alkaline phosphatase and vitamin D status).
KEY POINTS

• Stress fractures are overuse injuries and common in athletes.
• Patients with stress fractures should be assessed for osteoporosis.
• Consider the female athlete triad in any woman with a stress fracture.

PAINFUL HANDS AND A RASH

History
A 38-year-old man visits his general practitioner with a 2-month history of painful
hands. It developed insidiously over a few weeks and affects primarily the distal and
proximal interphalangeal joints in his hands, the whole of his third toe on the right foot
and his right heel. The pain, stiffness and swelling are most marked in the morning but
improve with exercise and ibuprofen. His past medical history is unremarkable. Systemic
enquiry reveals a longstanding rash which affects his forearms and umbilicus for which
he uses emollients.
Examination
There are plaques of scaly skin affecting his forearms, scalp and umbilicus. His nails
are dystrophic with pitting and ridging and there is soft-tissue swelling and synovitis
affecting the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints. He has a ‘sausage toe’ on the
right foot. His right Achilles tendon is swollen and tender in its distal third, with pain on
palpation of the insertion into the calcaneum.

• What is the differential diagnosis of arthropathy and a rash?
• Which is the most likely here?
• Are the normal inflammatory markers unusual?
• What treatment is available?

167

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 60
Arthropathy and rash is a common combination in rheumatology, so a detailed system
enquiry is crucial. Not only will the systems review highlight the associated rash which
may not be immediately apparent, but it may also reveal other features (e.g. ocular or
gastrointestinal involvement) of a unifying diagnosis.
The most likely differential diagnosis for rash and arthropathy is psoriatic arthritis,
systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, sarcoidosis and enteric arthropathy. Other possibilities include infections such as gonococcal arthritis, Lyme disease, rheumatic fever or
infective endocarditis. By far the most likely unifying diagnosis in this case is psoriatic
arthritis as the rash, nail and joint involvement are characteristic. The seronegativity (i.e.
RF and ACPA negative) is also very supportive.
Psoriatic arthritis is a common inﬂammatory arthropathy that affects up to 15 per cent of
those with psoriasis. It has a number of characteristic presentations and clinical features
that can help to differentiate between true psoriatic arthropathy and those with psoriasis
and another inﬂammatory arthropathy such as rheumatoid arthritis. Although the following are the ‘classic’ psoriatic presentations, patients may have several overlapping
features from different categories.

!

Clinical features of psoriatic arthropathy

• Dactylitis or ‘sausage’ digit and (insertional) tendinopathy
• Distal polyarticular disease (predominantly involving distal and proximal
interphalangeal joints)

• Proximal polyarticular disease (predominantly involving metacarpophalangeal and
proximal interphalangeal joints, very similar to rheumatoid)

• Sacroiliitis and/or spondyloarthropathy
• Oligoarthritis (particularly hips and knees)
• Arthritis mutilans with marked osteolysis and telescoping of the digits
The rash may be very mild, overlooked and under-reported, so clinical examination of
a patient with possible psoriatic arthritis should include careful scrutiny of the typically
affected sites such as hairline or natal cleft. Indeed, nail changes may be the only clinical
evidence of psoriasis and are an invaluable adjunct to diagnosis; changes include pitting,
ridging and onycholysis.
Diagnosis rests on a typical history and clinical examination; there is no diagnostic test
and often the acute phase is not as marked as in other inﬂammatory joint diseases – as
in this case. Radiology is unhelpful early on: the periarticular osteopenia of rheumatoid
is characteristically absent and the classic osteolysis leading to ‘pencil-in-cup’ deformities
is a late feature. Tendinopathy, enthesopathy, plantar fasciitis, sacroiliitis and spondyloarthropathy may be evident on MRI.
Treatment is similar to that for rheumatoid arthritis. Disease-modifying agents such as
methotrexate and leﬂunomide are used ﬁrst-line (while hydroxychloroquine tends to be
avoided as it may exacerbate skin disease). For patients with active disease despite an
adequate trial of DMARDs TNF-a blockade is very beneﬁcial, for both skin and joints.
Since this patient also has disease affecting the Achilles tendon, a prompt ultrasound
scan to determine severity of inﬂammation and tendon integrity would be important.
Steroid injections are relatively contraindicated in weight-bearing tendons as the risk of
rupture is profound, so emergency treatment for an at-risk tendon is immobilization in
an air-cast boot.
168

Rheumatology
KEY POINTS

• Rash and arthropathy are common presenting complaints.
• The most common differential is psoriatic arthritis.
• Nail disease is very helpful in differentiating psoriatic arthritis from other forms of
inflammatory arthropathy.

• Psoriatic arthritis has a number of clinical patterns. Distal small-joint disease is the
most common.

CASE 61:

HYPERMOBILITY AND A PNEUMOTHORAX

History
A 19-year-old man is referred by the chest team following admission with a spontaneous
pneumothorax. He has made a full recovery but during his admission it was noted that
he has hypermobile joints, long digits and possible skin laxity.
Examination
This young man is tall, with disproportionately long limbs and long ﬁngers. He has a
pectus excavatum and a mild scoliosis. His palate is high-arching and there is dental
overcrowding. His skin, including a scar from a minor injury, appears normal.
Questions
• How is hypermobility formally assessed?
• What diagnosis does the patient’s appearance and pneumothorax suggest?
• What is the feared complication?
• Which related condition is associated with hypermobility, skin laxity and abnormal
scar formation?

171

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 61
Hypermobility (or hyperextensibility) can be assessed using Beighton’s criteria. If 4 out of
9 points are scored on the following criteria, the patient is regarded as having joint laxity:
•
•
•
•
•

knee extension more than 10 degrees past 180 degreees (2 points)
extension of the elbow 10 degrees past 180 degrees (2 points)
extension of the thumb to touch the anterior forearm (2 points)
extension of the ﬁfth ﬁnger backward to 90 degrees (2 points)
trunk ﬂexion with palms ﬂat on the ﬂoor (1 point).

A degree of joint laxity is not uncommon in the normal population but it may occur as
part of a wider spectrum of the heritable collagen diseases. The most common of these are
Marfan and Ehlers–Danlos syndromes. This patient’s phenotype and history of spontaneous pneumothorax, however, are characteristic of Marfan syndrome.
Marfan syndrome is due to a defect in the ﬁbrillin gene, leading to an abnormal elastin
substructure. It results in abnormalities in a number of systems (see below). Although it
is an autosomal dominant condition, up to 25 per cent of cases are due to a spontaneous
mutation.

!

Clinical features of Marfan syndrome
Skeletal

Ocular
Cardiovascular
Pulmonary
Cutaneous
Radiological

Tall and thin
Disproportionally long legs
Arachnodactyly (spider fingers)
Pectus carinatum or excavatum
Loss of thoracic kyphosis
Scoliosis
High-arched palate with dental overcrowding
Ectopialentis (upward dislocation of the lens)
Aortic dilatation and dissection
Mitral valve prolapse
Spontaneous pneumothorax
Apical blebs
Incisional hernia
Stretch marks (in absence of weight change or pregnancy)
Dural ectasia (enlargement of dural sac)

The most feared complication is of aortic dissection, so all patients with Marfan syndrome
should have annual screening by echocardiography and early consideration of elective
repair. Patients with mitral valve prolapse are at risk of endocarditis.
The other main differential in this case, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, is a collagen defect
leading to joint laxity and skin fragility/hyperextensibility. These patients have velvetyfeeling skin with poor healing characteristics leading to gaping (‘ﬁsh-mouth’) scars and
easy bruising. The feared complication in this patient group is aneurysm formation and
arterial rupture due to elastic tissue laxity.
KEY POINTS

• Joint hypermobility is common in the normal population, particularly young girls.
• Hypermobility is assessed using Beighton’s criteria.
• Marfan syndrome is characterized by hypermobility and skeletal disproportion.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 62
This is a very good description of carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is
the most common entrapment neuropathy, in which the median nerve becomes compressed beneath the ﬂexor retinaculum on its route to the hand. The classic symptoms
are of tingling in the sensory distribution of the median nerve (i.e. the lateral three and
a half digits); loss of thumb abduction is a late feature. Symptoms are often worse at
night (when the hand might be quite painful) and in certain postures such as holding a
newspaper or driving.
The majority of cases are idiopathic, but pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis are very
common precipitating causes – as in this case. Other common conditions to consider are
acromegaly, hypothyroidism and diabetes. Carpal tunnel syndrome is also more common
in those whose occupation risks mechanical overuse, such as piano players!
Examination should start with general ‘end of the bed’ observation for signs of associated
conditions. On inspection of the hands there may be wasting of the thenar eminence.
Sensory change is detectable over the palmar aspects of the ﬁrst three and a half digits
and there may be weakness of abduction, ﬂexion and opposition of the thumb. Tinel’s
sign occurs when tapping the palmar aspect of the affected wrist produces paraesthesia
distally; Phalen’s sign is positive when maximal ﬂexion of the affected wrist provokes
or exacerbates the symptoms. Both these tests have limited sensitivity and speciﬁcity but
may lend weight to the diagnosis. Although she denies early-morning stiffness and has a
normal inﬂammatory response, a clinical assessment of her RA disease activity is crucial
to determine whether synovitis is contributing to the entrapment syndrome. The gold
standard investigation is a nerve conduction study which will demonstrate (and quantify)
reduction in conduction velocity through the carpal tunnel.
The majority of patients will respond well to conservative management, such as avoidance of provoking activities and wrist splints (particularly at night). This approach would
be entirely suitable in this case as her symptoms may settle post-partum. If these measures fail, corticosteroid injection into the carpal tunnel can be very effective in up to 80
per cent of patients. Surgical decompression should be reserved for those with persistent
disabling symptoms or motor loss.

JOINT PAINS, SKIN CHANGES AND MUSCLE WEAKNESS

History
A 44-year-old woman presents to the rheumatology department with a constellation of
symptoms. She was well until 8 months ago when she developed Raynaud’s phenomenon
and joint pains. The latter responded to a non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID),
so she ‘got on with normal life’. Over the last few months she has noticed the skin over
her ﬁngers becoming tighter. In recent weeks she has developed muscle weakness such
that she ﬁnds it difﬁcult to climb stairs or get out of a chair unaided.
Examination
There is some skin tethering over the ﬁngers, with reduction in the ﬁnger pulps. Although
her joints are painful there is no objective evidence of synovitis. Proximal muscle power
is reduced to 3/5. Respiratory examination reveals ﬁne inspiratory crackles bibasally, but
the remainder of her examination is normal. The general practitioner who referred her
performed an ‘autoimmune screen’.

ANSWER 63
This female patient has presented with a combination of features seen in RA, SLE, myositis and scleroderma in the presence of anti-U1-RNP antibodies. The most likely diagnosis
is, therefore, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Whether MCTD remains a truly distinct clinical entity is somewhat controversial and many patients may eventually develop
sufﬁcient features to fulﬁl established diagnostic criteria of a particular autoimmune disease. The case presented here highlights the most common presenting features for MCTD:
•
•
•
•

joint symptoms
Raynaud’s phenomenon
sclerodactyly
proximal myopathy.

Other frequent problems include oesophageal dysmotility, serositis and lymphadenopathy.
Although respiratory involvement is common in MCTD, it is often asymptomatic. This
patient has ﬁne bibasal crackles, which is suggestive of interstitial lung disease. She will
need a chest X-ray and possibly a high-resolution CT scan to identify interstitial changes,
as well as lung function studies to quantify any restrictive defect or reduced gas transfer
(diffusion capacity).
Management of MCTD involves directing therapy at speciﬁc abnormalities. The treatment
for each clinical feature in the combination is identical to that for a given presentation
in isolation; for example, vasodilators for Raynaud’s phenomenon, hydroxychloroquine
for arthralgia, and corticosteroids for myositis. Over time, the inﬂammatory component
and severity of MCTD manifestations generally diminish. Pulmonary hypertension is the
leading cause of disease-associated death.
KEY POINTS

• Mixed connective tissue disease is characterized by the presence of anti-U1-RNP
antibodies.

• Most common features of this mixed clinical picture are arthralgia, Raynaud’s
phenomenon, sclerodactyly and proximal myopathy.

• Pulmonary hypertension is the most feared complication.

Questions

• What is the investigation of choice?

177

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 64
In any patient presenting with an acutely painful and swollen joint, the most important
diagnoses to consider are septic arthritis and crystal arthropathy. Crystal arthropathy
such as gout is more common than septic arthritis; and since this patient is well with no
discernible risk factors for sepsis, it is the most likely diagnosis here. The investigation of
choice is a prompt aspiration of the joint with assessment of the synovial ﬂuid for crystals
or bacteria (and if the latter are detected, culture to determine the causative organism and
its sensitivity to antibiotics).
Crystal arthropathy is caused by either uric acid (gout) or pyrophosphate (pseudogout) crystals precipitating out into the synovial ﬂuid, generating a brisk inﬂammatory
response. The classic clinical picture is discrete attacks of monoarticular inﬂammation
– often initially the metatarsophalangeal joint – followed by asymptomatic periods; in
more severe, longstanding cases, the disease can become polyarticular. Risk factors for
gout are under-excretion or over-production of urate, which is a product of DNA breakdown and present in large amounts in certain foods and alcohol. Urate crystals may also
deposit in the skin, causing painful discrete lumps known as tophi, or in the renal tract,
causing urate nephropathy or lithiasis.

!

Causes of over-production and under-excretion of urate
Over-production
Excess alcohol
High consumption of meat and shellfish
Chemotherapy
Haematological malignancy
Psoriasis

Under-excretion
Excess alcohol
Renal impairment
Loop diuretics
Low-dose aspirin

Investigations will reveal an elevated acute-phase response, often with a neutrophilia and
thrombocytosis due to the inﬂammatory response (although this can lead to diagnostic
confusion with septic arthritis). The urate level may be normal during an acute attack
and is therefore relatively unhelpful. Microscopy of the synovial ﬂuid will reveal needleshaped crystals that are negatively birefringent on polarized microscopy in cases of gout,
and positively birefringent brick-shaped crystals in pyrophosphate disease. It is worth
bearing in mind that crystals can occur as innocent bystanders in infection; so unless the
diagnosis is clear-cut, it is worth sending a synovial ﬂuid sample for culture. In chronic
disease, X-rays may reveal the classic punched-out erosions with sclerotic margins.
Osteopenia is characteristically absent. Pyrophosphate arthropathy may be associated
with radiological evidence of chondrocalcinosis.
Treatment of an acute attack includes anti-inﬂammatories such as non-steroidal antiinﬂammatories (NSAIDs), colchicine or steroids, depending on the patient’s comorbidities.
In this case, for example, the renal impairment is a relative contraindication for NSAIDs,
so low-dose colchicine or a short course of oral prednisolone might be appropriate.
Injection of the affected joint with corticosteroid and local anaesthetic will also offer
immediate and effective relief and should be offered to all patients in whom there is
no evidence of septic disease. In cases of gout, patients should be given lifestyle advice
which can have a huge effect on urate levels (e.g. reducing alcohol and meat intake) and,
where possible, offending medications should be stopped or switched to alternatives with
no impact on urate handling. Long-term treatment with urate-lowering therapy such as
allopurinol should be commenced if the patient experiences recurrent attacks, but its
178

Rheumatology

commencement can precipitate another gout attack and should be started only when an
acute attack is over and under anti-inﬂammatory cover. There is no long-term prophylaxis for pyrophosphate disease.
KEY POINTS

• Crystal arthropathy is a common cause of an acutely painful joint (but always consider
and rule out septic arthritis).

• Gout may be precipitated by diuretics, renal impairment and aspirin use, so is a
common clinical problem in general medicine.

• Diagnosis is based on identification of urate crystals in synovial fluid; serum levels may
be normal.

• Acute treatment relies on NSAIDS, colchicine or steroids.
• Lifestyle modification may prevent further attacks. If not, commence allopurinol under
anti-inflammatory cover.

RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN AND FEVERS

History
A 16-year-old Turkish boy is seen in the emergency department with abdominal pain
and fever. His right knee is also exquisitely tender and slightly swollen. He has suffered
recurrent attacks with a similar presentation since childhood, although normally they are
more severe and also include pleurisy. He has been told that ‘it runs in the family’. The
attacks resolve spontaneously and in between times he is entirely well.
Examination
This adolescent is very uncomfortable, with a temperature of 38.8°C. His pulse rate is
110/min, blood pressure 115/63 mmHg. He has marked abdominal tenderness with
rebound and guarding; his bowel sounds are reduced. There is a mild and cool effusion
of his right knee, which is extremely tender. The rest of his examination is normal.
Questions
• What diagnosis might explain recurrent abdominal pain, pleurisy and fever?
• How would you investigate this patient?
• What is the feared complication of the underlying diagnosis?
• How would you treat this patient?

181

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 65
The admitting senior house ofﬁcer decided to refer this adolescent to the surgical team as
an acute abdomen. Although the SHO made the right decision to admit under the surgical
team, it is worth keeping an open mind to the diagnosis in view of its recurrent nature
and family history. The combination of recurrent serositis (peritonitis and pleuritis), fever
and eastern Mediterranean origin raises the possibility of familial Mediterranean fever
(FMF) as the underlying diagnosis.
FMF is an autosomal recessively inherited periodic syndrome characterized by stereotyped attacks of fever and inﬂammatory features which last up to 4 days and then remit
spontaneously. The most common manifestations are:
•
•
•
•
•

fever
peritonitis
arthritis
pleuritis
rash (erysipelas-like).

The arthritis is classically monoarticular and symptoms often outweigh the signs, with
extreme tenderness despite only mild effusions and a marked absence of increased
temperature.
This patient should still be investigated for acute abdomen with blood tests including
inﬂammatory markers, amylase and lactate and imaging in the form of an abdominal and
erect chest X-ray. Patients in whom one suspects FMF should be referred to a specialist
centre for genetic testing.
One of the feared complications of FMF is the development of amyloidosis. Amyloidosis
is a multisystem disease caused by the deposition of insoluble protein in the extracellular
matrix: renal, cardiac and hepatic tissues are commonly affected. Primary amyloid (AL) is
formed from deposition of immunoglobulin light chains and occurs in isolation or in the
context of myeloma. Secondary or reactive amyloid (AA) is caused by the deposition of
amyloid A rather than light chains and may complicate any chronic infective, malignant
or inﬂammatory process such as FMF.
Colchicine is the treatment of choice. It is not only very effective at diminishing the
attacks of serositis in FMF, but has also been shown to reduce the development of renal
amyloidosis in these patients by up to two-thirds.
KEY POINTS

• Consider a periodic syndrome in anyone presenting with recurrent serositis and fever.
• The arthritis in FMF often generates a greater level of pain than one would expect from
the clinical signs.

with various problems including chest pains, occasional rashes and hair loss. She recently
visited her family in Jamaica and felt much worse, with a resurgence of all of her symptoms, particularly the rash. She is currently experiencing an attack of her typical central
chest pain which is sharp and relieved by sitting forward.

patient?

183

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 66
The patient’s current history and examination ﬁndings are consistent with pericarditis, a pericardial effusion (with possible cardiac tamponade) and pleural effusions. The
immediate investigations of choice are therefore an ECG and echocardiogram. The ECG
in pericarditis classically demonstrates widespread ST segment elevation in a saddleshaped form; in the presence of a pericardial effusion the complexes may also be small.
Echocardiography is critical to assess diastolic ﬁlling and guide decisions regarding
pericardiocentesis.
The underlying unifying diagnosis is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem
autoimmune condition characterized by antibodies directed against nuclear components. SLE is more common, and more severe, in people of Afro-Caribbean origin and
may present with multiple problems affecting skin, mucosa, serosa and internal organs.
Constitutional upset and Raynaud’s phenomenon are also frequently encountered. The
American College of Rheumatology devised classiﬁcation criteria to assist in recruitment
to SLE clinical trials; these are now frequently adopted as diagnostic criteria. Four out of
the eleven criteria must be met, either concurrently or sequentially, to make a diagnosis
of SLE; the present patient fulﬁls six of them.

antibodies

Serological indicators of active SLE include the following.
• There is an elevated ESR. The CRP, however, is classically normal, unless there is serosal (i.e. pleuropericardial) involvement – as in this case. In the absence of clear serosal
involvement, an elevated CRP in a lupus patient should prompt a search for infection.
• There is low complement (C3 and/or C4 counts) due to immune complex consumption.
• dsDNA titres in some patients mimic disease activity and a rapid rise in titre may
predate a clinical ﬂare.
Renal disease remains the most feared complication of lupus and all patients (including
this one!) should have their blood pressure checked, urine examined for casts and serum
creatinine checked regularly.
184

Rheumatology

The management of lupus depends on disease activity. For the majority with mild disease,
simple measures such as avoiding sun exposure and using NSAIDs for mild arthralgia
are sufﬁcient. For those with moderate disease, hydroxychloroquine, steroids and steroidsparing agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine are appropriate; but those with
organ-threatening disease will require more powerful immunosuppression in the form
of cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil. The anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody
rituximab may also be useful in refractory disease. This patient has signiﬁcant serosal and
haematological involvement so would need a course of steroids to get the disease under
control before commencing a steroid-sparing agent. If her urine dip and/or creatinine
indicate renal disease, a renal biopsy should be considered to guide decisions regarding
further immunosuppression.
KEY POINTS

• SLE is a classic autoimmune disease.
• Anti-nuclear factor is sensitive but not specific: a negative result in screening
investigations is therefore reassuring.

• Since renal involvement is the most feared complication, all lupus patients should have
their blood pressure and renal function checked, along with a urine dip to look for
haematuria.

CASE 67:

PAINFUL HANDS AND BREATHLESSNESS

History
A 36-year-old woman is referred by her general practitioner with cold, painful hands
and shortness of breath on exertion. Over the last 6 weeks she has noticed her ﬁngers
and hands turning blue, then white and ﬁnally red and painful in episodic attacks, particularly in the cold. In addition the skin on her ﬁngers feels taut, reducing her ability to
make a ﬁst. The shortness of breath and reduced exercise tolerance has developed insidiously over the same period but she has not had a cough or infective symptoms. She has
no history of, or risk factors for, respiratory disease.
Examination
This woman is dyspnoeic on walking from the waiting room to the clinic; her oxygen
saturations are initially 92 per cent but increase to 99 per cent with rest. She has no
peripheral stigmata of respiratory disease. The skin over her ﬁngers and hands is tight
and bound-down but is intact with no evidence of ulcers or vasculitis. The thickened
skin extends beyond her elbows and she also has restricted mouth opening. Her jugular
venous pulse is elevated, with a parasternal heave and a loud second heart sound, but
there is no peripheral oedema. In the respiratory system she has bibasal mid-to-late ﬁne
inspiratory crackles.
Questions
• What is the cause of this patient’s breathlessness and cardiorespiratory findings?
• What is the underlying diagnosis?
• What are the possible complications?
• How would you further investigate and manage this patient?

187

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 67
This woman has the clinical features of interstitial lung disease (progressive breathlessness, desaturation on exercise and typical crackles) and is developing right heart failure
(raised JVP, right ventricular heave and loud P2) as a result. The colour changes in her
hands are a very good description of triphasic Raynaud’s phenomenon: episodic vasospasm that may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary due to an underlying connective tissue disease. The combination of Raynaud’s phenomenon, skin tightening and interstitial
lung disease would strongly suggest an underlying diagnosis of scleroderma in this case.
Scleroderma is an uncommon disorder characterized by thickening of the skin and, to a
greater or lesser degree, ﬁbrosis of internal organs. The condition is classiﬁed according
to the extent of disease.
Localized scleroderma is restricted to the skin with no evidence of internal organ involvement. Patterns of limited disease occur as isolated ﬁbrotic plaques (morphoea) or bands
of affected skin (linear scleroderma, also known as ‘en coup de sabre’ when found on
the face).
Systemic sclerosis is divided into diffuse and limited forms.
• Diffuse systemic sclerosis is characterized by ﬁbrosis extending proximal to elbows or
knees. These patients are likely to describe recent-onset Raynaud’s phenomenon and
are at greater risk of developing cardiopulmonary, renal or gastrointestinal complications. Typically they have anti-topoisomerase-1 (anti-Scl70) antibodies.
• Limited systemic sclerosis results in distal ﬁbrotic skin disease. The associated
Raynaud’s phenomenon tends to be longstanding and these patients are more likely
to develop telangiectasias, calcinosis and pulmonary hypertension. The characteristic
antibody proﬁle is anti-centromere positivity.

Although this patient almost certainly has diffuse systemic sclerosis, the diagnosis
should be conﬁrmed serologically with an antibody screen (ANA, antiScl-70 and anticentromere). The extent of internal organ involvement should be ascertained by checking renal function and making a full assessment of her respiratory system. Appropriate
investigations would include an X-ray and high-resolution CT scan of her chest, along
with pulmonary function to assess lung volumes and gas transfer. Echocardiography will
determine the presence and severity of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.
There is no speciﬁc treatment for systemic sclerosis. Raynaud’s phenomenon is managed
by keeping warm and using vasodilators such as nifedipine. Interstitial lung disease may
188

Rheumatology

respond to immunosuppression with steroids and cyclophosphamide. Right heart failure
is managed with diuretic therapy. The risk of developing renal crisis is diminished by the
use of prophylactic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition.
KEY POINTS

• Scleroderma is characterized by skin thickening and a variable extent of internal organ
involvement.

• Limited disease is not necessarily more benign as a significant proportion develop
pulmonary disease.

PERSISTENT ULCERATION IN AN ELDERLY WOMAN

History
A 78-year-old woman is referred from a leg-ulcer clinic to rheumatology for advice. She
has been treated with compression bandaging for presumed venous ulcers for several
months, with no perceptible beneﬁt, and on a recent review was found to have a few
scattered lesions of palpable purpura, an elevated ESR and a very high rheumatoid factor.
Examination
This woman has palpable purpura over her feet and toes, with a shallow painful ulcer on
her left shin and one over her right ﬁrst metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. The edges of
the ulcers are punched out but not heaped up, and the bases are clean with no evidence
of infection. There is no clinical evidence of synovitis and the remainder of the examination is normal.

191

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 68
Palpable purpura may occur in conditions such as meningococcal sepsis and thrombocytopenic purpura, but one of the most common inﬂammatory causes of palpable purpura
is vasculitis. Although all of the small to medium vessel vasculitides can give rise to
purpura, the most common underlying conditions are Henoch–Schönlein purpura, leucocytoclastic vasculitis and cryoglobulinaemia.
Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin complexes that precipitate out in
the cold. Some cryoglobulins have rheumatoid factor activity, giving rise to a very high
RF titre in the absence of rheumatoid arthritis – as in this case. The complement is consumed during immune complex formation, giving rise to low serum levels of C3 and C4.
Cryoglobulinaemias exist in single and mixed forms.
• A single homogeneous form (25 per cent), also known as type I, can be essential or
idiopathic, but is often associated with myeloma, lymphoma or Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia.
• The mixed form (75 per cent) is further subdivided into mixed monoclonal (type II)
and polyclonal (type III), and both types may form complexes with self IgG (i.e. have
rheumatoid factor activity). Although the mixed cryoglobulinaemias can be essential,
type II is often associated with myeloma, lymphoma, Sjögren’s syndrome and infections (particularly hepatitis C). Type III is classically associated with autoimmune
inﬂammatory disease (particularly RA and SLE).
The complications of cryoglobulinaemia are classically cutaneous with palpable purpura,
petechiae, distal ulceration/necrosis and livedo seen most commonly. Other common
features to look out for are Raynaud’s phenomenon, arthritis, peripheral neuropathy and
renal disease. As renal involvement is the greatest predictor of outcome, this patient
should have her renal function and blood pressure checked, along with a urine dip checking for proteinuria or haematuria. Liver disease is present in up to 70 per cent due to
the association between hepatitis C infection and type II cryoglobulinaemia, so hepatitis
C serology should be checked in all patients with a suspected small to medium vessel
vasculitis.
Cryoglobulin levels themselves are diagnostic, but measuring them can be technically
challenging as signiﬁcant quantities are lost when the blood cools to below 37°C. Either
the blood should be drawn in the department where the testing is to take place or steps
be taken to incubate the blood during transfer to the laboratory.
Treatment of cryoglobulinaemia depends on the extent of disease and the association
with hepatitis C. For those with no evidence of hepatitis, treatment consists of cold
avoidance, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hydroxychloroquine,
escalating to corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents such as azathioprine if necessary.
Cytotoxic therapy (cyclophosphamide) or plasmapharesis is reserved for those with organ
or life-threatening disease. For patients with hepatitis-associated disease, the treatment
of choice is interferon-a with or without the antiviral ribavirin; these may have to be
combined with immunosuppressive agents if the vasculitis is very severe.

192

Rheumatology
KEY POINTS

• Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins (or complexes thereof) that precipitate out in the
cold.

• Consider cryoglobulins in patients with palpable purpura and skin ulceration.
• The most common mixed forms have rheumatoid factor activity and may produce a
very high RF titre.

• Testing for cryoglobulins requires the sample to reach the lab at 37°C!

A SORE THROAT, PAINFUL KNEES AND
FACIAL MOVEMENTS

CASE 69:

History
A 16-year-old boy is referred to the medical team with abnormal involuntary facial
movements. He was well until 8 weeks before admission when he developed a sore
throat and febrile illness, associated with pain and swelling in several large joints. The
symptoms began in his knees, before moving to his ankles and ﬁnally his elbows and
responded only partially to ibuprofen. However, he made a full recovery within 3 weeks.
For the last 24 hours his parents have noticed emotional lability and involuntary rapid
and purposeless movements, particularly in his face. He denies weakness or sensory loss.
Examination
This adolescent is well and not febrile. He has brief uncoordinated facial movements
consistent with chorea. His skin, nails and mucosal surfaces are normal. Cardiovascular
examination reveals a friction rub and pansystolic murmur in the mitral area. Respiratory
and abdominal examinations are normal. There is a cool effusion in his left elbow.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What investigations would you request?
• What are the treatment options?

195

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 69
The combination of a sore throat and febrile illness in a young person followed by a migratory
polyarthropathy, chorea and carditis is highly suggestive of rheumatic fever. This systemic
connective tissue disease occurs typically between 3 and 10 weeks after the original group A
streptococcal infection and, as in this case, chorea is often the most delayed manifestation.
The diagnosis is made on the basis of the Duckett Jones criteria: two minor or one major
plus two minor criteria are required, plus supporting evidence of preceding group A
streptococcal infection, such as elevated ASOT (see the box).

!

Duckett Jones criteria (1944)
Major criteria
Pancarditis

Endocarditis (most commonly mitral and aortic valves)
Myocarditis (cardiac failure and conduction defects)
Pericarditis

Polyarthritis

Migratory large-joint arthropathy

(Sydenham’s) Chorea

May be associated with emotional lability

Erythema marginatum

Erythematous rings on trunk and inside of limbs

Subcutaneous nodules

Firm, painless, may resolve rapidly

Minor criteria
Arthralgia
Fever
Elevated ESR/CRP
Prolonged PR interval
Previous rheumatic fever

The arthritis associated with rheumatic fever classically involves the large joints (knees,
ankles, elbows and wrists) and occurs in up to three-quarters of patients. It is mild, nonerosive and self-limiting, tending to resolve within 2–4 weeks.
The investigations of choice begin with an echocardiogram to assess valvular insufﬁciency and to identify a pericardial effusion. The speciﬁc antibody test used to help
conﬁrm a diagnosis of rheumatic fever is the antistreptolysin-O (ASO) and elevated titres
(>200 units) are found in up to 80 per cent of patients with rheumatic fever, although
high ASO titres may also be found in patients with other rheumatic diseases. Other possible, non-speciﬁc features of rheumatic fever include an elevated acute-phase response
(ESR/CRP), a normocytic anaemia, neutrophilia and hypoalbuminaemia.
Treatment is with penicillin (or erythromycin in those with penicillin sensitivity); the
inﬂammatory component of disease is treated with salicylates or, in the case of severe
disease, corticosteroids. Those with a history of conﬁrmed rheumatic fever are at lifetime
risk of developing recurrent disease with subsequent streptococcal infection and should
receive secondary prophylaxis in the form of continuous penicillin for 5 years or until
21 years of age, whichever is longer.
KEY POINTS

• Rheumatic fever may occur following streptococcal infection.
• Cardinal features are arthritis, carditis, rashes and chorea (a late sign).
• Penicillin is the treatment of choice. Corticosteroids may be required for the
inflammatory symptoms.

CASE 70:

A LUMPY RASH AND A SWOLLEN KNEE

History
A 24-year-old woman is referred by her general practitioner with a rash over the front of
her shins and an intermittently swollen knee. There is no relevant medical history. She is
a non-smoker who drinks around 8 units of alcohol per week and is taking no medication
except vitamin pills bought over the counter in a health food shop. Her mother has type
2 diabetes. She works as a teacher.
Examination
The lesions over this young woman’s shins are raised and tender. They are of differing
ages and sizes, between 5 and 20 mm, passing through the stages of a bruise as they fade.
There are no other skin lesions. Although she reports knee swelling in the past, there is
no current evidence of inﬂammatory arthropathy.
Questions
• What is the rash?
• What management would be appropriate?

197

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 70
The description of the rash is typical of erythema nodosum. This is most common over
the shins although it may occasionally be seen over the arms or thighs. Common causes
for erythema nodosum include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

pregnancy
inﬂammatory bowel disease
sarcoidosis
tuberculosis
streptococcal infection
drugs (sulphonamides, penicillin, oral contraceptives among others)
Behçet’s syndrome
rheumatic fever
idiopathic.

The history should be directed towards highlighting or eliminating these most common
underlying conditions by seeking out their associated symptoms. Direct questions in the
systems review might therefore include: pregnancy or contraceptive pill use; fever, sore
throat, cough or breathlessness; diarrhoea or abdominal pain; presence and pattern of
arthropathy. A detailed drug history is also mandatory.
Mild idiopathic erythema nodosum (as in this case) needs no speciﬁc treatment. If the
rash is troublesome, a non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID) or, if severe, corticosteroids are effective. Any underlying condition is treated independently of the rash.
KEY POINTS

• The rash of erythema nodosum is raised, tender lumps over the shins which discolour
like a bruise.

• It often does not require any specific treatment. Screening questions should be directed
at eliminating an associated underlying condition.

coincided with the development of the rash. Initially it was mild with ‘sock-marks’ around
her ankles, but now the swelling is more pronounced and has spread up to her knees. She
is otherwise well and on no medication.
Examination
This young woman has a maculopapular rash across the bridge of her nose and cheeks

199

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 71
This patient has lupus nephritis and needs urgent referral to renal services for consideration of a renal biopsy and then potent immunosuppression. The diagnosis of lupus is
suggested by the combination of:
•
•
•
•
•

classic malar rash
leucopenia
positive anti-nuclear factor
positive dsDNA antibodies
renal disease (elevated urea and creatinine, proteinuria and haematuria and
hypertension).

Renal biopsies are performed both for diagnosis and to aid prognostication. Lupus damages the kidneys by immune complex deposition – hence the low complement levels in
this patient, as they have been consumed. This can be observed with immunoﬂuorescence
studies of glomerular tissue. In addition, the biopsy will give an indication of how much
of the disease is acute (and therefore reversible) and how much damage is chronic and
non-salvageable.
Treatment of lupus nephritis focuses on tight control of blood pressure with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and powerful immunosuppression. All
patients should receive high-dose steroids (up to 1 mg/kg) and either cyclophosphamide
or mycophenolate mofetil. Both drugs are effective in this situation; but, as this patient
is of child-bearing age, mycophenolate mofetil may be preferable as cyclophosphamide
has an adverse effect on fertility. If the patient fails to respond to treatment, anti-B-cell
therapy or plasma exchange are alternative therapeutic options.
KEY POINTS

•
•
•
•

200

Renal disease is the most feared complication of SLE.

Most patients will require potent immunosuppression.
Cyclophosphamide reduces fertility and this side-effect should be specifically discussed
with patients of child-bearing age.

CASE 72:

A BREATHLESS RHEUMATOID PATIENT

History
A 46-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis attends an emergency review at his rheumatology department. His joint disease is well-controlled on methotrexate 20 mg/week.
Over the last few weeks, however, he has become increasingly short of breath with a
marked reduction in exercise tolerance. He has a dry, unproductive cough and, although
he denies infective symptoms, he recalls feeling feverish at the beginning of his illness.
He is a non-smoker and there is no relevant occupational history.
Examination
This man is mildly short of breath at rest (18 breaths per minute). He is not febrile.
Oxygen saturation is 98 per cent on room air, desaturating rapidly to 88 per cent on
exercise. Breath sounds are heard throughout both lung ﬁelds, with late inspiratory ﬁne
crackles bibasally. A radiograph is shown in Fig. 72.1.

Figure 72.1

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What other investigations should be done?

201

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 72

!

Differential diagnosis for a breathless rheumatoid patient

• Rheumatoid lung: interstitial lung disease, generally a non-specific interstitial
pneumonitis

• Drug reaction causing allergic alveolitis: classically reported for methotrexate
• Coexistent infection: bacterial or pneumocystis pneumonia, particularly in the
immunosuppressed and patients on steroids

• Pleural effusion: exudate with high LDH and low glucose
• Bronchiolitis obliterans
The chest X-ray reveals widespread but predominantly bibasal interstitial shadowing.
Further investigation of this particular patient should aim to differentiate between interstitial lung disease, methotrexate lung and coexistent infection. Bronchopneumonia is
unlikely given the lack of fever, sputum and features of consolidation, but PCP (pneumocystis pneumonia) may present in this way.
In terms of simple investigations, a full blood count can be very helpful. The FBC is classically normal in interstitial lung disease, but there may be an elevated white cell count
in infection and methotrexate reactions tend to be associated with an eosinophilia. The
C-reactive protein may be very elevated in bacterial infection (although make sure that
active inﬂammatory joint disease is not contributing to this). Special investigations are
very helpful in this case: lung function tests and a high-resolution CT of the chest are
investigations of choice.
Methotrexate lung is an idiosyncratic reaction (i.e. may occur at any time after introduction of the drug) but occurs more commonly in the ﬁrst 2–3 years of treatment. Most
cases resolve on cessation of the drug, but occasionally a short course of oral steroids
may accelerate resolution of the attack. There is very little data on whether the reaction
recurs on re-challenge, but most rheumatologists would be reluctant to re-introduce the
offending drug, even at a lower dose. Rheumatoid lung is harder to treat and may be
rapidly progressive (Hamman–Rich syndrome). In cases with radiological evidence of
active inﬂammation in the form of ground-glass shadowing rather than clear-cut ﬁbrosis, immunosuppression with steroids and cyclophosphamide may be appropriate. These
patients should be discussed with respiratory units with expertise in interstitial lung
disease.
KEY POINTS

• Breathlessness in rheumatoid patients is a common clinical problem.
• The key differential diagnoses are rheumatoid lung, infection or drug reaction
(alveolitis).

• Close liaison with respiratory units is important.

203

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 73
The likely diagnosis for this patient’s current presentation is pulmonary embolus (PE).
The history of sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath is characteristic
of PE, and the normal respiratory examination and chest X-ray is highly supportive, as
is the hypoxia. Although an ECG may demonstrate right heart strain in patients with
large emboli, the most common ﬁnding is simply a sinus tachycardia (or new-onset
atrial ﬁbrillation in the elderly). The diagnostic test for PE is a CT–pulmonary angiogram
(CT-PA) and the patient should be anticoagulated in anticipation of a positive result. The
history of lupus is highly relevant and, in combination with a previous pregnancy loss
and mild thrombocytopenia, raises the possibility of antiphospholipid syndrome.
Antiphospholipid syndrome is a hypercoagulable state characterized by recurrent
arteriovenous thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity in the presence of either a lupus
anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibody (both phospholipid-related proteins). The term
‘lupus anticoagulant’ is admittedly confusing in a pro-thrombotic state, but the in-vitro
test relies on prolonged coagulation (APTT) that is corrected not by addition of a clotting
factor but rather by the addition of phospholipid in excess. Although antiphospholipid
syndrome was originally described in lupus, its occurrence does not correlate with disease activity and it may indeed occur in patients with no clinical or serological evidence
of SLE.
The most common arteriovenous thrombotic events in antiphospholipid syndrome are
deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (as in this case), but any part of the
circulation may be involved, with arterial events such as myocardial infarction and stroke
carrying a high mortality rate. Poor placental circulation is thought to be responsible
for the high pregnancy morbidity, with recurrent ﬁrst- and second-trimester loss and a
higher rate of pre-eclampsia being typical clinical features. The Sapporro criteria for the
diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome require one clinical and one laboratory criterion
to be fulﬁlled; the laboratory criteria need to be met twice at least 6 weeks apart.

Additional clinical features may include:
•
•
•
•

cardiac valvular disease (up to a third have mitral valve prolapse)
livedo reticularis
mild chronic thrombocytopenia
neurological disease such as chorea or transverse myelitis.

Management of antiphospholipid syndrome is lifetime anticoagulation with warfarin,
typically aiming for an INR of 2.0–3.0. All patients should be advised to stop smoking.
Special attention should be paid to primary prevention of atheromatous disease with
aggressive blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes management. Oestrogen-containing
contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy are contraindicated in women with
antiphospholipid syndrome. Anticoagulation during pregnancy can be a challenge as
204

Rheumatology

warfarin is teratogenic and must be stopped before 6 weeks’ gestation. However, with
specialist obstetric care and the combination of low-dose aspirin plus low-molecularweight heparin, the rate of successful pregnancies has increased considerably.
KEY POINTS

• Antiphospholipid syndrome may occur independently of SLE.
• Recurrent miscarriage is a frequent clinical feature.
• Diagnostic tests are anticardiolipin antibodies and antiphospholipid antibodies.

CASE 74:

FEVER, RASH AND JOINT PAINS

History
A 28-year-old man is admitted to the infectious diseases unit with pyrexia of unknown
origin. For the last 10 weeks he has been feeling non-speciﬁcally unwell with joint pains,
muscle aches and weight loss. During this time he has had a recurrent fever, occasionally very high (>40°C) which has not responded to multiple courses of antibiotics. Of
note, the fever spikes only once or twice a day, usually in the morning or late afternoon;
in between febrile episodes his temperature is normal and he feels reasonably well. In
addition he has noticed a faint rash over his trunk which is most evident when he has
a temperature. During the course of his illness many of his joints have been painful and
stiff, and currently his knees, wrists and the small joints of his hands are worst affected.
Examination
This young man appears unwell but is not febrile. There is a very faint salmon-pink
rash over his abdomen and lymphadenopathy in the cervical and axillary regions.
Cardiorespiratory examination is unremarkable. There is two-ﬁngers breadth hepatomegaly but his spleen is impalpable. Musculoskeletal examination reveals widespread
mild synovitis in his hands and wrists and an effusion in his left knee.

207

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 74
The differential diagnosis in this situation is wide. Many of the features are relatively
non-speciﬁc, and the blood tests simply reveal evidence of marked systemic inﬂammation in the absence of clear bacterial infection or seropositivity. Diagnoses to consider
include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

infection
lymphoma
leukaemia
sarcoidosis
endocarditis
rheumatic fever.

However, the presence of the swinging daily (quotidian) rather than persistent fever with
spikes and the evanescent rash are characteristic of adult-onset Still’s disease – a systemic
inﬂammatory illness associated with a seronegative chronic polyarthropathy.
The most common features of adult-onset Still’s disease are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

arthralgia ± arthritis
characteristic fever
myalgias
rash
weight loss
lymphadenopathy
hepatosplenomegaly
abdominal pain
serositis (pleuropericarditis).

There is no diagnostic test for Still’s disease and often there is considerable delay as
patients undergo several negative investigations. However, an extremely elevated ferritin
(often >1000 mg/dL) is highly suggestive of the diagnosis and would certainly be an
investigation of choice in this case.
The treatment of choice is corticosteroid therapy, the dose of which is increased in line
with the severity of the patient’s illness. Many – this case included – may require doses
of up to 60 mg/day initially to get the disease under control before adding in a steroidsparing agent such as methotrexate to aid gradual steroid withdrawal.
Generally, patients with adult-onset Still’s disease fall into one of three categories: selflimiting illness, intermittent ﬂares of disease activity, or chronic arthritis. The overall
survival rate at 5 years is 90–95 per cent.
KEY POINTS

• Consider inflammatory disease in cases of pyrexia of unknown origin.
• The quotidian rash is characteristic of adult-onset Still’s disease.
• The serum ferritin is markedly elevated in Still’s disease.

CASE 75:

PAIN AND STIFFNESS IN SHOULDERS AND HIPS

History
A 72-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with a few weeks’ history of
pain and stiffness affecting her shoulders and hips. The pain began insidiously but is now
severe; her shoulders and neck are worst and affected symmetrically. Although she denies
objective weakness, the pain is limiting her activities of daily living and frequently wakes
her from sleep. The stiffness lasts several hours in the morning. Otherwise, she is entirely
well and has no medical history of note.
Examination
This elderly woman is uncomfortable and ﬁnds it difﬁcult to move from the chair to the
examining couch. She is generally tender around the neck, shoulders and pelvic girdle.
There is no evidence of synovitis but full range of movement is limited by periarticular
rather than true joint pain.

• What is the most significant complication?

209

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 75
The most likely diagnosis is polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), a systemic inﬂammatory
syndrome affecting the elderly that is characterized by bilateral pain and stiffness in the
shoulders and hip girdles. The stiffness can be profound and limits mobility although
true muscle weakness is not a feature. Physical examination is essentially unremarkable,
although patients with a marked constitutional upset due to PMR may appear unwell with
evidence of recent weight loss. The affected areas are diffusely tender, with movements
limited by pain. Synovitis has been reported, but care must be taken not to attribute joint
inﬂammation to PMR until other diagnoses have been excluded; for example, a signiﬁcant minority of RA patients may present with a polymyalgic onset.
The acute-phase response (classically ESR) is elevated in PMR, although can be normal
in a minority of cases; the diagnosis of PMR is a clinical one, and further investigations
are ‘screening tests’, performed to exclude alternative diagnoses.

!

Differential diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica
Rheumatoid arthritis

Small-joint arthropathy – the majority RF or ACPA positive

Infection

Fevers or localizing symptoms and signs, blood cultures may be
positive

Malignancy

Atypical presentation, suggestive features in history or
examination, poor response to therapy, investigations guided by
history and examination

Polymyositis

Muscle weakness, elevated CK, abnormal EMG or MRI findings

Fibromyalgia

Trigger points and normal ESR and CRP

Hypothyroidism

Stigmata of thyroid disease, elevated TSH, normal ESR and CRP

Depression

Normal physical examination, normal ESR and CRP

The treatment for PMR is low-dose corticosteroids. Prednisolone 15 mg daily should
sufﬁce, but may have to be increased according to weight. Many physicians would consider a dramatic response to low-dose predisolone as almost diagnostic for PMR, so if a
patient’s symptoms do not improve rapidly it is wise to re-evaluate the original diagnosis.
Most patients will successfully wean down and off steroids over 18 months or 2 years, but
if dose reduction is a problem, steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate may be beneﬁcial. All patients should receive concomitant bone protection with their corticosteroids.
The most signiﬁcant complication of PMR is the development of an associated temporal
(giant cell) arteritis, a granulomatous large-vessel vasculitis which may, if untreated, lead
to blindness. Any patient with a history of PMR should be assessed with this in mind
and asked to report any history of headaches, scalp tenderness or visual disturbance.
Diagnosing temporal arteritis is difﬁcult; it is based on a combination of the clinical
picture, an elevated acute-phase response and histological features on temporal artery
biopsy.
KEY POINTS

• Polymyalgia rheumatica is common and responds very swiftly to low-dose
corticosteroid therapy.

• The feared association is temporal (giant cell) arteritis, which may lead to blindness.

CASE 76:

PAINFUL EARS AND NOSE

History
A 50-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with attacks of painful ears and
tenderness across the nasal bridge, which has begun to collapse. During each episode, his
ears feel swollen, ‘like they’re burning’, and hot to touch; the bridge of his nose feels full
and painful, with occasional nose-bleeds. During this current attack, his ears and nasal
bridge have started to feel ﬂoppy. Otherwise he is well, with no past medical history of
note.
Examination
Both ears are tender and hot to touch, with boggy swelling and a purplish discoloration.
The earlobes are spared. His nasal bridge has collapsed, causing a saddle-nose deformity.
His right eye has an injected sclera and there is asymmetric polyarthritis affecting his
hands. The remainder of the examination is normal.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 76
The differential diagnosis of a collapsed nasal septum and saddle-nose deformity is:
• relapsing polychondritis
• Wegener’s granulomatosis
• congenital syphilis.
The auricular disease in this case is limited to the cartilage as the earlobe is spared. This
effectively rules out cellulitis and the most likely cause of such multifocal cartilaginous
inﬂammation is relapsing polychondritis. Relapsing polychondritis is characterized histologically by inﬂammatory inﬁltration and later ﬁbrosis of cartilage. Any cartilage, in any
location, is at risk, but the box shows classic sites for clinically relevant disease.

Diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis is clinical as there are no diagnostic tests – the
results of investigations in this case are typical. The ESR can be used as a predictor of
disease activity in some patients.
Treatment of relapsing polychondritis is with corticosteroids, the dose of which (20–
60 mg/day) depends on the severity of organ involvement and risk to major structures.
The majority of patients will need a protracted course of steroids, so steroid-sparing
agents should be considered at an early stage and bone protection is mandatory. Surgical
reconstruction of collapsed structures is not an option as the deformity tends to continue
postoperatively.

212

Rheumatology
KEY POINTS

• Relapsing polychondritis is a cause of painful ears, but the lobe is characteristically
spared, differentiating it from cellulitis.

• Any cartilaginous structure may be affected.

WEAKNESS AND A RASH

History
A 72-year-old woman is admitted by the medical team with muscle weakness and pain.
Her symptoms began insidiously over the last few weeks, but are now so severe she ﬁnds
it hard to climb stairs or raise her arms above her head. Fine movements and grip strength
are unaffected. She has also noticed a scaly rash over the back of her hands and her palms
are becoming cracked and unsightly. Otherwise she is well, with no medical history of
note. Systems review is unremarkable; she denies weight loss and in fact has noticed that
her abdomen is mildly swollen.
Examination
This elderly woman has marked proximal weakness, graded 2 to 3 out of 5 at shoulder
and hip in the absence of neurological features. She has a lilac discolouration over the
back of her eyes, a scaly rash on the back of her ﬁngers and papules over her metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Her palms are ﬁssured and cracked and nail-beds are ragged
with dilated nail-fold capillary loops. Cardiorespiratory examination is unremarkable.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 77
This elderly woman has a clear-cut proximal myopathy, with a classic history of insidious
loss of strength affecting large muscle groups at the shoulder and girdle. The differential
diagnosis is broad.

!

Differential diagnosis of proximal myopathy
Inflammatory myopathy

Poly- and dermatomyositis
Inclusion body myositis

Drug-induced myopathy

Neuromuscular disease

Cushing’s and Addison’s disease
Acromegaly

Metabolic disease

Glycogen storage disorders
Malabsorption and vitamin D deficiency

Rheumatic disorders

Polymyalgia rheumatica, fibromyalgia

The association of a proximal myopathy and a rash in this case, however, suggests the
diagnosis of dermatomyositis. This is an autoimmune inﬂammatory myositis and the
elevated CK, ESR and ANA are supportive of the diagnosis. The rashes over her face,
hands (the lesions over the knuckles are known as Gottron’s papules) and palms (so-called
mechanic’s hands) are also highly characteristic.
The gold standard investigations for inﬂammatory myopathy are:
• electromyography which demonstrates myopathic (not neuropathic) potentials
• muscle biopsy revealing a chronic inﬂammatory inﬁltrate and muscle necrosis (NB
inclusion-body myositis characteristically contains red-rimmed vacuoles with betaamyloid on biopsy).
MRI (T2-weighted and STIR for fat suppression) will reveal areas of oedema and inﬂammation and may be useful to delineate areas for biopsy and thereby increase diagnostic
yield. Further characterization of the clinical syndrome may also be derived from
myositis-speciﬁc antibodies. For example, patients with anti-Jo-1 antibody are at a
greater risk of developing inﬂammatory lung disease.
Inﬂammatory myositis is associated with an underlying malignancy in a signiﬁcant
minority of patients (up to 15 per cent) either at or soon after diagnosis. As a consequence, patients should have a thorough history and examination (including breast,
pelvis and prostate) performed speciﬁcally looking for occult malignancy; the level of
screening investigation is hard to stipulate, but a chest X-ray and mammogram would
constitute the bare minimum. This patient has signs suggestive of a pelvic malignancy
such as ovarian carcinoma and should undergo an urgent CT scan of her pelvis and
abdomen.
Inﬂammatory myositis is generally steroid responsive, although initially high doses
(up to 1 mg/kg) are required to get the disease under control before attempting a slow
withdrawal. It may take 2–3 years to get patients off steroids, and in many cases steroidsparing agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine are required. All patients should also
216

Rheumatology

receive bone protection, vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Occasionally diagnostic
confusion may arise between a ﬂare of inﬂammatory myositis and the development of
steroid myopathy. Helpful investigations at this stage are to repeat the CK and MRI as
both will be abnormal in a ﬂare of inﬂammatory disease and normal in steroid myopathy.
KEY POINTS

• (Dermato)myositis is an inflammatory cause of proximal myopathy.
• In the elderly, it may be associated with malignancy.
• The muscle disease is generally steroid responsive.

DIARRHOEA, RASH AND A STIFF BACK

History
A 41-year-old man presents to the rheumatology department with bloody diarrhoea,
ulcers over his shins and a painful, stiff back. Although his back stiffness began more
than 5 years ago, he chose to ignore it until recently when, in combination with his other

the morning and tend to ease by lunchtime. It has, on occasion, been associated with a
painful and swollen right knee. The diarrhoea and leg ulcers began six weeks previously
and he is awaiting a gastroenterology outpatient appointment.
Examination
This man has limited spinal movement in all planes with a Schober’s test reduced at

Questions
• What is the likely unifying diagnosis, and how would you confirm it?
• How would you manage this patient?

219

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 78
The most common unifying causes of bloody diarrhoea, rash and arthritis would be
Reiter’s syndrome or enteropathic (i.e. inﬂammatory bowel disease) arthritis. However,
the duration of the diarrhoea and the description of the rash would suggest enteropathic
arthritis is the most likely diagnosis.
A seronegative arthritis may develop in up to 15 per cent of patients with any form of
inﬂammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease or microscopic and collagenous colitis. The most common clinical presentations are a peripheral
arthritis (commonly divided into type I and type II) and spondyloarthritis.
• Type I enteropathic arthritis is an asymmetrical oligoarthritis which follows disease
activity in the bowel.
• Type II enteropathic arthritis is symmetrical and polyarticular and runs an independent course to bowel disease. Both forms of peripheral arthritis affect men and women
equally.
• Enteropathic spondyloarthropathy also runs an independent course and may pre- or
post-date the bowel disease by several years. It is more common in men than women
and presents with inﬂammatory spinal or sacroiliac pain that is very similar to ankylosing spondylitis.
The extra-articular features of enteropathic arthritis are:
• mucocutaneous: oral ulcers, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum
• ocular: anterior uveitis
• musculoskeletal: tendinopathy and enthesopathy, hypertrophic osteopathy.
Investigations reveal a non-speciﬁc elevated inﬂammatory response with a negative RF
or ANA (although beware, up to 60 per cent of UC patients are pANCA positive!) and
HLA-B27 is positive in 50–70 per cent of cases. The investigation of choice is endoscopy
to achieve a histological diagnosis of inﬂammatory bowel disease, and from a musculoskeletal point of view, the patient needs an MRI of the sacroiliac joints and lumbosacral
spine to delineate evidence of inﬂammatory arthritis.
Treatment of enteropathic arthritis is hampered somewhat by the fact that oral NSAIDs
may exacerbate inﬂammatory bowel disease. Available therapies range from localized
treatment with intra-articular steroid injections to systemic management with immunosuppressants such as sulphasalazine or anti-TNF-a agents. Interestingly, spinal disease
tends not to respond as well to conventional DMARDs as peripheral arthritis.
KEY POINTS

• The differential diagnosis of diarrhoea and arthritis includes reactive arthritis and
enteropathic arthritis.

• Spinal disease in enteropathic arthritis runs an independent course to bowel disease.

History
A 62-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with headache. The pain focuses
over the temporal areas, where his scalp also feels tender such that he ﬁnds it painful
to lie on his side at night. Over the same period as his headache has developed, he has
noticed pain and fatigue in his jaw when chewing his food. He is otherwise ‘reasonably
well’ but has been experiencing pain and stiffness in his shoulders and hips which he has
attributed to heavy gardening, and has lost a few kilograms in weight. His past medical
history and systems enquiry is unremarkable and he takes no regular medication.

Questions

221

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 79
The diagnosis is giant cell arteritis (GCA). This granulomatous vasculitis predominantly
affects patients over the age of 50 years of age and leads to inﬂammation and possible occlusion of the aorta and its major branches. Cranial GCA is the most frequently
reported, with a classic constellation of symptoms, many of which are evident in this
case:
•
•
•
•
•

headache
scalp tenderness
jaw claudication
visual disturbance (e.g. diplopia, amaurosis fugax, blindness)
tissue necrosis (scalp, tongue).

If patients do experience extracranial disease, the symptoms and signs will correspond
to the vascular territory involved. For example, mesenteric ischaemia will generate postprandial abdominal pain while iliac disease will lead to claudication.
Many GCA patients will have a history of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), complaining
of bilateral shoulder/pelvic girdle pain and stiffness, although marked constitutional
upset such as weight loss or fever tends only to occur in patients with GCA rather than
uncomplicated PMR.
This patient’s examination ﬁndings are classic for GCA, with tender, pulseless temporal
vessels. If the ciliary branches of the ophthalmic arteries are involved, visual symptoms
ensue and fundoscopy may reveal ischaemic optic neuritis or optic atrophy. Standard
simple investigations reveal a non-speciﬁc inﬂammatory picture, with an elevated ESR
and/or CRP, thrombocytosis and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia. The investigation of choice is a temporal artery biopsy demonstrating a granulomatous inﬂammation
and a disrupted internal elastic lamina or, less commonly, a diffuse and rather less speciﬁc lymphocytic inﬁltrate. The drawback with biopsy as the gold standard investigation is the presence of ‘skip lesions’ due to patchy involvement of the vessel, leading to
difﬁculties with false negative results. The diagnosis hinges on the complete picture of
clinical suspicion, serological and histological abnormalities.
The treatment of GCA is high-dose corticosteroids (1 mg/kg) and this should be commenced without delay in anyone in whom the diagnosis is suspected. This early use of
steroids is crucial to reduce the risk of sight loss and will not dramatically reduce the
diagnostic yield of a subsequent biopsy. All patients should receive bone protection
with bisphosphonates and calcium/vitamin D supplementation, and many will require
gastroprotection in the form of a proton-pump inhibitor. If visual symptoms are present
there should be close liaison with local ophthalmology services; in these cases aspirin
may provide additional beneﬁt and in the rare instance of sudden total blindness, intravenous methylprednisolone has been reported to restore vision if commenced within 24
hours. Patients should remain on high-dose steroids until symptoms, signs and laboratory
indices of inﬂammation have subsided. This can often take several weeks, and thereafter
a very gradual reduction of steroids can commence. As with other conditions requiring
long-term steroid therapy, methotrexate or other steroid-sparing agents may prove beneﬁcial. Cyclophosphamide is reserved for the minority of patients who fail to respond to
steroid therapy.

222

Rheumatology
KEY POINTS

• Temporal (giant cell) arteritis is the most common of the large-vessel vasculitides.
• The feared complication is blindness.
• Steroid treatment should be commenced without waiting for the diagnostic test
(temporal artery biopsy).

• Biopsies may lead to false negative results due to skip lesions.

CASE 80:

A PAINFUL SWOLLEN HAND FOLLOWING A FRACTURE

History
A 45-year-old woman fell from her horse and sustained a fracture of her distal radius.
Although her fracture healed appropriately with immobilization, the patient noticed that
once the cast was removed her wrist was sore and stiff. This deteriorated over a number
of weeks, such that her whole hand became painful and swollen.
Examination
The pain does not localize to the joints in particular, and indeed the whole hand appears
generally hypersensitive. The skin is shiny and purple and disproportionately sweaty
compared to the unaffected side.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the appropriate investigations?
• What treatment options are available?

225

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 80
This is a classic description of a regional pain syndrome – also known as chronic regional
pain syndromes (CRPS) or reﬂex sympathetic dystrophy. The condition classically occurs
after injury and is characterized by the rapid development of extreme pain that is out of
proportion to the initiating event and does not follow an anatomical pattern. In addition there is considerable swelling and the skin may display trophic changes, including
increased sweating. Vasomotor instability is also recognized.
Appropriate investigations would include C-reactive protein and/or ESR to rule out an
underlying inﬂammatory arthritis. X-ray features very early on in disease are normal.
With persistent disease, the most notable ﬁndings are soft-tissue swelling and patchy
osteopenia.
Thermography is a specialist investigation and has high sensitivity for thermal changes
in the affected limb.
Although there is no speciﬁc treatment for chronic regional pain syndromes, prolonged
rehabilitation with intensive physiotherapy can be very effective. Other treatment options
for resistant or severe disease include neuroleptics like gabapentin or local sympathetic
nerve blocks.
KEY POINTS

• Consider CRPS in any patient presenting with an isolated painful limb following injury.
• Trophic changes and vasomotor instability may help to differentiate CRPS from an
inflammatory arthritis.

CASE 81:

DIARRHOEA AND PAINFUL JOINTS

History
A 52-year-old man presents with a longstanding history of weight loss, diarrhoea and
painful, stiff hips and knees. The arthritis developed ﬁrst, affecting principally his hips
and knees but tending to move around. A rheumatoid factor has been checked in the
past and was negative, so he felt reassured. The diarrhoea then became an issue over
the last 6 months; he has intermittent abdominal pain and complains that the stools are
foul-smelling and hard to ﬂush away. There has never been any blood, mucus or slime.
With continuing diarrhoea he has lost weight (5 kg in 6 months), despite a good appetite.
Examination
There is evidence of recent weight loss and a mild effusion of the right knee. Otherwise
systems examination is normal.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you investigate and manage this patient?

227

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 81
The combination of diarrhoea and arthritis is not uncommon, and the likeliest diagnoses
are either a reactive or enteropathic (i.e. inﬂammatory bowel disease-associated) arthritis.
However, the diarrhoea is too longstanding to consider reactive disease, and inﬂammatory bowel disease would be likely to cause passage of blood or mucus and other extraintestinal features such as rashes, ulcers or ocular disease. This history is typical for a
malabsorption picture with steatorrhoea leading to fatty foul-smelling stools that ﬂoat
and are hard to ﬂush. This combination of malabsorption and arthritis should make one
consider Whipple’s disease – and this case is a classical presentation.
Whipple’s disease is a systemic illness caused by the Gram-positive bacillus Tropheryma
whippelii. Due to the multisystem nature of the condition, there is often considerable
diagnostic delay and the disease may be quite advanced before correct treatment is instituted. The symptoms of Whipple’s disease can be remembered thus:
Weight loss

Diarrhoea

Hyperpigmentation of the skin

The arthritis may appear as a migratory seronegative oligo- or polyarthritis, similar to a
spondyloarthropathy (there is an association with HLA-B27) and may precede the development of other symptoms by up to 10 years. Synovial ﬂuid from these patients is fairly
non-speciﬁc and inﬂammatory, but synovial biopsies may demonstrate the presence of
PAS-positive granules in so-called ‘foamy’ macrophages.
The diagnosis is made either histologically or by PCR. Jejunal biopsy may demonstrate
the inﬁltration of macrophages with diastase-resistant inclusions with positive PAS staining, whereas PCR can be performed on tissue from affected sites such as small bowel,
lymph node, synovial tissue and ﬂuid. PCR from peripheral blood does not have a high
diagnostic yield.
As for all patients with a malabsorptive history, the investigations should also assess
nutritional status, and calcium, B12/iron/folate and vitamin D levels should be checked.
The treatment of Whipple’s disease is protracted antibiotic therapy. Seek advice from an
experienced infectious diseases unit before commencing therapy.
KEY POINTS

• Although rare, consider Whipple’s disease in any patient presenting with
malabsorption, weight loss and arthritis.

• The diagnostic test is jejunal biopsy.

CASE 82:

CHRONIC EXTENSIVE MUSCLE PAIN

History
A 46-year-old woman is referred to the rheumatology department with a long history of
muscle pain and fatigue. Her symptoms developed insidiously and she now complains of
pain ‘all over her body’, poor sleep and exhaustion much of the time. She denies constitutional upset or speciﬁc symptoms but is ﬁnding it hard to work or care for her family.
Her medical history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medications.
Examination
This woman is well and has no peripheral stigmata of inﬂammatory disease. Although her
joints are mildly tender, there is no evidence of synovial thickening or effusion. Palpation
of a number of soft-tissue points is tender but her muscle strength is preserved. All systems examinations are normal.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 82
This patient has chronic pain, fatigue and soft-tissue tenderness in the absence of clinical or
serological evidence of inﬂammatory disease. The likely diagnosis is ﬁbromyalgia, a noninﬂammatory syndrome of unknown aetiology. Characteristic features of this condition are
diffuse pain, non-restorative sleep and trigger points of hyperalgesia (pain ampliﬁcation).
The symptoms tend to be chronic and are often present for months before patients seek
medical advice. In addition to these ‘classic’ symptoms, patients may complain of arthralgia, morning stiffness, depression, paraesthesiae and even Raynaud’s phenomenon.
The diagnostic clinical ﬁnding in ﬁbromyalgia (whether primary or secondary) is the
presence of trigger points: at least 11 out of a potential 18 speciﬁc tender points of hyperalgesia on the surface anatomy. These regions are exquisitely tender to mild pressure (i.e.
enough to blanch a thumbnail). The nine pairs of trigger points are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

occiput: muscle insertions at the base of the skull
trapezius: midpoint of the muscle belly
supraspinatus: medial border of scapula spine
gluteal: upper outer quadrant
greater trochanter: posterior to greater tronchanter
low cervical: muscle belly anterior to C5–7 spaces
second rib: second costochondral junction
lateral epicondyle: 2 cm distal to epicondyles
knee: proximal to medial joint line.

Since the differential diagnosis of ﬁbromyalgia encompasses inﬂammatory joint and connective tissue diseases, a limited screening set of investigations is appropriate, but the difﬁculty is deciding when to stop. The batch of investigations listed above effectively rules
out the most common diagnoses and therefore this patient does not require further tests.
Although primary ﬁbromyalgia is non-inﬂammatory and therefore associated with normal
investigations, secondary ﬁbromyalgia is not uncommon in patients with inﬂammatory
disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or SLE. In these cases, abnormal clinical ﬁndings and
laboratory results reﬂect the primary inﬂammatory disorder, rather than ﬁbromyalgia per se.
The management of ﬁbromyalgia has many components. Patient reassurance on several
points is crucial.
• Fibromyalgia is a real disease and they are not ‘mad’ or ‘making it up’.
• Although disabling, ﬁbromyalgia is not destructive or a threat to long-term health.
• Although many of the symptoms can be treated pharmacologically, self-management
is very effective and they have considerable control over the condition.
A combination of patient reassurance, education, graded aerobic exercise and management of sleep disturbance can be very successful. The most common pharmacological
intervention (which covers many of the components of treatment listed above) is a lowdose tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline; if side-effects such as dry mouth or
drowsiness cause problems, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may prove beneﬁcial.
KEY POINTS

• Fibromyalgia is a non-inflammatory syndrome characterized by chronic pain, poor
sleep and low mood.

• It commonly coexists with inflammatory disease such as RA or SLE.
• Patient reassurance is a critical component of therapy.

CASE 83:

INTRACTABLE SYNOVITIS

History
A 54-year-old woman is reviewed in the rheumatology clinic. She was diagnosed with
seropositive rheumatoid arthritis 14 years ago with prolonged early-morning stiffness, a small-joint arthropathy and a marked acute-phase response (elevated ESR and
C-reactive protein). Despite aggressive therapy with disease-modifying agents, she has
never achieved disease remission, continues to struggle with joint pains and stiffness and
struggles with activities of daily living. Her livelihood is at risk as she is unable to type
effectively. She has previously tried methotrexate but it produced marked nausea and
deranged liver function tests at 15 mg/week and had to be stopped. Hydroxychloroquine
and azathioprine were both ineffective. Current medications are leﬂunomide 20 mg oncedaily, prednisolone 4 mg once-daily, alendronate 70 mg weekly and calcichew D3 forte
once-daily.
Examination
This woman has marked synovitis with tenderness and swelling of many of her
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, her right wrist and
left knee. A radiograph is shown in Fig. 83.1.

231

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 83
This woman has severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that is refractory to standard DMARD
therapy, her current treatment being leﬂunomide, a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor, and
low-dose prednisolone. Her hand and wrist X-ray reveals advanced destructive rheumatoid disease, with extensive erosions, bone loss and joint destruction.
Disease activity in RA is measured by the disease activity score (DAS), which is a composite score of the clinical evidence of synovitis, the current inﬂammatory response and
the patient’s own assessment of their health. Clinical synovitis is scored by counting the
number of tender and swollen joints out of a total of 28 (shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs,
PIPs and knees). The patient’s ‘global health’ is determined by using a visual analogue
score system: the patient is presented with a horizontal line 100 mm long with 0 (no
arthritis activity) at one end and 100 (severe arthritis activity) at the other and is asked
to mark where on the line she feels her overall health lies. This is measured with a ruler
and expressed out of 100. A DAS calculator (available on-line) is required to calculate the
DAS and levels of activity are recorded as high (>5.1), moderate (3.2–5.1), low (2.6–3.19)
and remission (<2.6). This patient would certainly have a high disease activity score.
Patients who have high disease activity as determined by the DAS and have either failed
or failed to tolerate standard disease modifying therapy qualify for biologic therapy –
monoclonal antibodies that are directed against key components of the inﬂammatory
response.
The ﬁrst-line biologic therapy in use currently is with anti-TNF-a (such as inﬂiximab or
adalimumab, both monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF-a, or etanercept, a fusion
protein that acts as a decoy receptor for TNF-a). TNF-a blockade is highly effective in up
to 70 per cent of patients, reducing both inﬂammation and the progressive structural damage associated with severe active disease. All TNF inhibitors work best if co-prescribed with
methotrexate, even at low doses, but a few are licensed as monotherapy. Although generally safe and well-tolerated, the greatest risk is of increased infection rates. Of particular
concern is the reactivation of latent tuberculosis, so screening with a chest X-ray is mandatory before commencing treatment. As TNF-a is also a ‘tumour surveillance’ molecule,
there is a theoretical risk of increased malignancy with this treatment. This has not been
borne out in long-term safety data, with the possible exception of lymphoma. However, the
association between anti-TNF and lymphoma is also confounded by the fact that patients
with severe RA are more likely to develop lymphoma, regardless of anti-TNF exposure.
Second-line biologic therapies for RA include:
• rituximab – a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20-positive B-cells, and commonly used for those who fail to respond to TNF blockade
• abatacept – a decoy receptor preventing T-cell co-stimulation and activation
• tocilizumab – a monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-6 receptor.
Patients on biologic therapy should be carefully monitored and assessed for adequate
clinical response by rheumatology units with experience in the use of these agents.
KEY POINTS

• Patients with active RA despite DMARD therapy may qualify for biologic therapy.
• TNF-a inhibition is the first-line biologic therapy.
• All patients should be screened for tuberculosis prior to commencing treatment.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 84
Although one should consider malignancy in any smoker presenting with haemoptysis and an abnormal chest X-ray, the rapid renal impairment, constitutional upset and
marked inﬂammatory response make it more likely to be an inﬂammatory pulmonary–
renal syndrome such as a vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Goodpasture’s
disease. In addition, the chest X-ray is typical of pulmonary haemorrhage rather than
malignancy, with diffuse alveolar inﬁltrates and a ‘bat’s wing’ appearance of perihilar
shadowing. The presence of cANCA (cytoplasmic antineutrophil antibody) and anti-PR3
(antiproteinase) antibody suggest Wegener’s granulomatosis, although neither is diagnostic and both may be raised in malignancy or other vasculitides.
The gold standard investigation would be a tissue biopsy to identify the presence of a
granulomatous vasculitis. This patient with a raised creatinine would certainly require a
renal biopsy for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes.
The classic triad of Wegener’s granulomatosis is the presence of upper and lower respiratory tract disease and renal impairment.

The treatment for Wegener’s granulomatosis depends on the severity and extent of organ
involvement. ‘Limited’ Wegener’s affects only the upper respiratory tract and low-dose
septrin (oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) may prove beneﬁcial. Oral steroids are of
value in more severe disease and the steroid-sparing agent methotrexate may be used
234

Rheumatology

(with caution in combination with septrin). Deterioration of renal function and/or pulmonary haemorrhage carry signiﬁcant mortality and are indications for high-dose intravenous steroids, cyclophosphamide and/or plasma exchange.
KEY POINTS

• Small-vessel vasculitis may cause a pulmonary–renal syndrome.
• Wegener’s granulomatosis is characterized by upper and lower airway disease and
renal involvement.

• Nasal crusting, epistaxis and hearing loss are crucial symptoms to identify in the
history of a patient with suspected Wegener’s granulomatosis.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis, and which diagnosis is most likely?
• How would you manage this patient?

237

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 85
The differential diagnosis in this case of acute monoarthropathy includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

acute septic arthritis
reactive arthritis
enteropathic arthritis (i.e. associated with inﬂammatory bowel disease)
psoriatic arthritis
gonococcal arthritis
ankylosing spondylitis
crystal arthropathy (gout or pseudogout)
Behçet’s syndrome.

Although this patient is systemically well and septic arthritis is therefore relatively
unlikely, it should always be included in the differential as its consequences are so dire.
The presence of altered bowel habit makes reactive arthritis and enteric arthritis likely
contenders; the rash might suggest psoriatic arthritis; but the combination of rash, ocular
disease, self-limiting diarrhoea and an acute monoarthropathy make reactive arthritis the
most likely diagnosis.
Reactive arthritis is an inﬂammatory mono- or oligo-arthritis that occurs 1–4 weeks
after extra-articular infection, particularly by organisms with a predilection for mucosae
(classically genitourinary or gastrointestinal). The most frequently implicated organisms are Chlamydia (NB asymptomatic in women), Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia and
Campylobacter. Reactive arthritis is the most common inﬂammatory arthritis affecting
young adult men and, in addition to the arthropathy, may cause an enthesopathy or
a dactylitis; patients who are HLA-B27-positive are at greater risk of protracted oligoarticular disease and spinal or sacroiliac involvement. Reactive arthritis is associated with
a number of extra-articular features which should be speciﬁcally sought in the history of
anyone presenting with an acute mono-or oligo-arthropathy.

Reiter’s syndrome (as originally described) is considered a form of reactive arthritis with
a triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis and arthritis following infectious diarrhoea. Not all
patients with reactive arthritis have all components of the triad, and the term is best
avoided.
238

Rheumatology

The patient in this case has typical investigation results, with non-speciﬁc evidence of
inﬂammatory disease. There is no diagnostic test for reactive arthritis, but diagnosis is
based on a combination of the clinical picture and cultures from swabs, urine and stool.
Synovial ﬂuid cultures are, of course, negative. HLA-B27 is more prevalent in patients
with reactive arthritis than the normal population and may help with prognostication, but
it is not of value diagnostically. Radiographs are only helpful in chronic disease, when
sacroiliitis, ankylosis, enthesopathy, osteopenia and erosion may be evident.
Reactive arthritis is generally benign, with up to 80 per cent making a full recovery.
In anticipation of this, ﬁrst-line treatment for the arthritis is NSAIDs and/or localized
therapy in the form of aspiration and injection of the affected joint(s) with corticosteroid
and local anaesthetic. This would be an entirely appropriate approach in this case. For
those patients with refractory disease, disease-modifying agents such as methotrexate or
sulphasalazine are generally effective. The mucocutaneous features of reactive arthritis
are usually mild and self-limiting and may not require speciﬁc treatment. Liaison with
ophthalmological services for management of ocular disease is prudent, particularly in
cases of anterior uveitis. In cases with a clearly identiﬁed antecedent organism, antibiotic
therapy should also be commenced; this is particularly crucial for Chlamydia infection in
women, which may lead to reduced fertility in the future.
KEY POINTS

• Consider reactive arthritis in any patient presenting with a monoarthropathy.
• HLA-B27 is useful prognostically but not diagnostically in reactive arthritis.

CASE 86:

SWOLLEN ANKLES AND A RASH

History
A 28-year-old African-American man presents to the rheumatology department with a
2-week history of painful swollen ankles and a rash over his shins. His rash is ﬂuctuating with crops of raised tender lumps that fade spontaneously. His ankle pain initially
responded to a non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID), but over the last few days
has deteriorated such that he ﬁnds it hard to walk. His medical history is unremarkable,
except for an acutely painful red eye several months previously for which he saw an
ophthalmologist and was given steroid eye-drops. He cannot recall the diagnosis he was
given at the time. Systems review is unremarkable.
Examination
This man has synovitis affecting both ankles, with a mild effusion on the left and lesions
suggestive of resolving erythema nodosum over his shins.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What investigations would be helpful?
• How would you treat this patient?

241

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 86
The likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis or sarcoid is a multisystem inﬂammatory
disorder characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas in affected organs
(commonly lungs, skin, eyes and joints). The presence of ankle disease and erythema
nodosum is classic and when associated with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is referred
to as Löfgren’s syndrome. Although of acute onset, this has a more benign outlook than
chronic disease as it is exquisitely responsive to steroid therapy.

The most important investigation in this case is a chest X-ray to rule out pulmonary

Destructive bony lesions are characteristically absent in sarcoidosis unless the disease is
chronic. Where present, they are most commonly found in the hands, with soft-tissue
swelling, osteopenia, erosions and periosteal reactions. The wrists and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints are generally spared in sarcoid, which may help to differentiate sarcoid
from erosive disease such as rheumatoid. Although an elevated angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) level is frequently requested in cases of suspected sarcoidosis, it has little
diagnostic value as many with acute sarcoid have a normal ACE level and it is frequently
elevated in other conditions. The serum calcium must be measured; it may be elevated as
granulomas may enhance production of 1,25-dihydrocholecalciferol. Overall, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is usually clinical/radiological, but can be conﬁrmed by the detection
of non-caseating granulomas on biopsy (e.g. lung, lymph node).
Treatment of sarcoidosis depends on the severity and the extent of organ involvement.
In this case, his relatively mild arthritis and skin disease may respond to NSAIDs, colchicine or low-dose corticosteroid. Higher doses may be required for persistent arthritis (and
242

Rheumatology

methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent may be beneﬁcial in these cases). If one joint is
particularly troublesome, an intra-articular injection of steroid may abort an acute attack.
Ocular disease may also respond to topical steroid therapy, as it did in this patient. More
powerful systemic immunosuppression such as cyclophosphamide is reserved for neurological or life-threatening disease.
KEY POINTS

• Consider sarcoidosis in any patient presenting with ankle synovitis.
• All patients with sarcoid arthropathy should have a chest X-ray to identify potential
respiratory involvement.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 87
The symptom that causes most concern in this case is abdominal pain after eating:
such postprandial symptoms raise the suspicion of mesenteric ischaemia. The rash over
his abdomen and thighs is characteristic of livedo reticularis, and the patient’s marked
inﬂammatory response is somewhat out of keeping with his otherwise relatively mild
clinical presentation. The possibility of vasculitis must therefore be considered in this
case. Vasculitis can also cause marked constitutional upset and a normocytic anaemia
and thrombocytosis, all of which are evident in this patient. The symptom that points
to a particular diagnosis is testicular pain, which occurs most frequently in polyarteritis
nodosa.
Polyarteritis nodosa is an uncommon vasculitis of small and medium-sized arteries which
leads to a varied presentation. The most common features are listed in the box.

!

Clinical features of polyarteritis nodosa

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Constitutional: malaise, fever, weight loss
Cutaneous: palpable purpura, ulceration, livedo reticularis
Musculoskeletal: myalgia, arthralgia, arthritis
Renal: glomerulonephritis, leading to hypertension
Gastrointestinal: mesenteric angina
Neurological: mononeuritis multiplex, stroke, seizures
Genitourinary: testicular pain

The diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa can be difﬁcult as there are no diagnostic serological markers and the autoimmune proﬁle is characteristically negative. There is an
association with hepatitis B and hepatitis serology should be checked in all patients with
suspected vasculitis. Once the diagnosis is suspected, a tissue diagnosis should be sought
from a biopsy of an affected organ (e.g. skin, testicle, sural nerve). Angiography is the
investigation of choice if biopsy is not possible – and is crucial in this case to investigate/
delineate mesenteric arteritis. Typical ﬁndings of mesenteric arteriography in polyarteritis
nodosa are small aneurysms, occlusions and stenoses.
The treatment of polyarteritis nodosa depends on the extent and severity of the disease,
but steroids, steroid-sparing agents and cyclophosphamide are all used commonly; this
patient would certainly require high-dose steroids and cyclophosphamide to prevent
intestinal ischaemia and infarction. Plasmapheresis and antiviral therapy are recommended
as alternative treatment for patients who are positive for hepatitis B.
KEY POINTS

• Consider mesenteric ischaemia in any patient presenting with a systemic illness and
postprandial abdominal pain.

• Testicular pain is a characteristic feature of polyarteritis nodosa.
• Polyarteritis nodosa has an association with hepatitis B infection.

ANSWER 88
The combination of dry eyes, dry mouth and an inﬂammatory arthritis is highly suggestive of Sjögren’s syndrome. Sjögren’s syndrome may occur as a primary condition
(associated with anti-nuclear antibodies to Ro and La) or in association with another
connective tissue disease, most commonly RA. The exocrine glands become destroyed by
a lymphocytic inﬁltration which impairs tear and saliva production; the arthritis mimics
the distribution of RA but tends to be milder and non-erosive.
The most common symptoms of Sjögren’s syndrome are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

dry eyes and dry mouth (xerostomia)
arthritis
parotid gland enlargement
Raynaud’s phenomenon
constitutional upset (fever, fatigue)
rashes (cutaneous vasculitis, photosensitivity)
dyspareunia.

The objective assessment of dry eyes is based on the Schirmer’s test. A standardized piece of
ﬁlter paper is hooked under the lower eyelid and the amount of paper-wetting over 5 minutes is measured. Less than 5 mm would be highly suggestive of decreased tear production.
The overall prognosis of Sjögren’s syndrome is generally more benign than that of other
inﬂammatory diseases. Treatment of this patient would be essentially symptomatic.
Dry eyes may be improved by wearing spectacles with side shields to reduce evaporation; eye-drops (preservative-free artiﬁcial tears or lacrilube ointment) are required in
many patients. For those with severe disease, ophthalmology services may offer punctal
occlusion to reduce tear drainage. Severe surface disease such as scleritis or ulcers may
need topical steroids. Xerostomia may respond well to sugar-free sweets to stimulate
saliva production. All patients must pay particular attention to dental hygiene as accelerated caries is a frequent problem. For those with disabling lack of saliva production,
cholinergic drugs such as pilocarpine may be helpful but are associated with muscarinic
side-effects such as sweating or gastrointestinal disturbance. Her arthritis will probably
respond promptly to non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hydroxychloroquine or low-dose prednisolone.
Sjögren’s syndrome is often associated with a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia and
may progress to the development of a lymphoma. The risk of this transformation is probably less than originally estimated and may be less than 10 per cent. However, many units
would still screen with annual immunoglobulin proﬁling and patients should be vigilant
about the development/progression of lymphadenopathy or parotid swelling. Although not
relevant in this case, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies cross the placenta and cross-react with
the developing conducting system in the fetal heart. As a result, patients of child-bearing
age with Ro and La antibodies should be counselled regarding potential fetal heart-block
and should have antenatal care through an experienced high-risk obstetric unit.
KEY POINTS

• Dry eyes and a dry mouth are common symptoms in Sjögren’s syndrome.
• Sjögren’s syndrome is associated with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies.
• Patients with anti-Ro or anti-La antibodies who are pregnant should be reviewed by a
high-risk obstetric unit as there is risk of heart block in the developing fetus.

CASE 89:

GENITAL ULCERS AND A RASH

History
A 26-year-old Turkish man presents to his general practitioner with a painful apthous
ulcer on his scrotum. Although he has had oral ulcers on and off ‘for years’, this is the
ﬁrst episode in the genitourinary tract. He denies other genitourinary symptoms and is
not sexually active. Four weeks previously he experienced a rash over the front of his
shins: discrete red tender lumps appeared and then faded spontaneously, going through
colour changes like a bruise. On systems review he mentions that his right knee is intermittently painful and swollen, but denies any other problems.
Examination
This young man has a deep ulcer on his scrotum, but his penis is normal. He has no oral
ulcers. The sclera of his right eye is injected. He has a solitary brown slightly raised lesion
on his left shin and a small effusion in the right knee. He has an erythematous lesion in
the left antecubital fossa from blood donation 48 hours previously.
Questions
• What diagnosis does this patient’s combination of symptoms suggest?
• What is your differential diagnosis?
• What other features would you seek in the history?
• Is his racial origin relevant?
• What are the treatment options?

ANSWER 89
The combination of orogenital ulceration, arthritis, conjunctivitis and a rash suggests a
diagnosis of Behçet’s syndrome. The rash is a classic description of erythema nodosum,
a panniculitis associated with a number of inﬂammatory conditions; the skin reaction to
needlestick (in this case venesection for blood donation) is an example of pathergy, which
may be pathognomonic of Behçet’s disease.
Behçet’s is an autoimmune disease that affects men and women equally. However, this
patient’s racial origin is certainly helpful in this case as Behçet’s is more common in
those from Turkey, the Mediterranean and the Far East. The geographical risk is probably
a function of the disease’s association with HLA-B51. Although there are a number of
speciﬁc features which are typical of Behçet’s disease (outlined below), many are shared
with other inﬂammatory conditions and Behçet’s can present a diagnostic challenge.

!

Symptoms and signs of Behçet’s disease
Recurrent oral ulceration

At least three attacks per year

Recurrent genital ulceration

Most common on scrotum or vulva
Prone to scarring

Ocular disease

Anterior or posterior uveitis
Conjunctivitis
Corneal ulceration

Cutaneous disease

Erythema nodosum
Pathergy
Pseudofolliculitis/papulopustular lesions

Arthritis

Classically migratory mono- or oligoarthritis

Vascular diseases

Thrombosis and arterial aneurysms

Neurological disease

Headache
Aseptic meningoencephalitis
Intracranial hypertension may be due to venous sinus
thrombosis

The differential diagnosis for ulceration, arthritis, ocular disease and a rash is broad. You
must consider:
•
•
•
•
•

Crohn’s disease
reactive arthritis
systemic lupus erythematosus
vasculitis
sarcoidosis (although ulceration is atypical).

Owing to the breadth of the differential diagnosis, a detailed history and examination
(looking for speciﬁc features of the above) is mandatory. Unfortunately there is no diagnostic test for Behçet’s disease and laboratory ﬁndings are non-speciﬁc with an elevated
acute-phase response and a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia.
The treatment of Behçet’s depends on the constellation and severity of the symptoms.
Mucocutaneous disease can be effectively treated with colchicine, dapsone or thalidomide. In more severe disease, steroids (± steroid-sparing agents) or tacrolimus may be
required. Cyclophosphamide is generally reserved for life- or sight-threatening disease.

250

Rheumatology
KEY POINTS

• Although rare, consider Behçet’s syndrome in patients presenting with orogenital
ulceration and arthritis.

• The presence of the pathergy reaction may be helpful in the diagnosis of Behçet’s
syndrome.

CASE 90:

RASH, ARTHRALGIA AND FACIAL WEAKNESS

History
A 32-year-old American woman presents with ﬂu-like symptoms, painful hands and loss
of power down the right side of her face. She was previously ﬁt and well but on a recent
trip back to Wisconsin sustained an insect bite to the back of her knee and started to
feel unwell a week later. Her main complaints at that stage were headaches and fatigue,
with arthralgia in her hands, all of which she self-managed with paracetamol and
non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatories until her return to the UK. A few weeks have elapsed,
but she woke this morning with unilateral weakness of her facial muscles, including the
forehead.
Examination
This woman has a large (15 cm) circular rash over the back of her knee with a bright red
border and central clearing. Although her joints are tender, she has no clinical evidence
of synovitis. She has a facial nerve palsy on the left side.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• List its potential complications.
• What test would you order?
• How would you manage this patient?

253

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 90
The combination of rash leading to arthralgia and cranial neuropathy is a classic presentation of Lyme disease. It is a multisystem disease caused by infection with the tick-borne
spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi; the Ixodes tick commonly lives on deer and is endemic
in parts of the United States (including Wisconsin, as in this case). Lyme disease has three
clinical stages.
• Stage 1 is localized cutaneous disease. Classic sites for the tick to bite are warm,
moist areas like the back of the knee, axillae and under the breast. However, the tick
is very small and only half of patients with clear-cut Lyme disease may remember
the bite. The characteristic rash, called erythema chronicum migrans, develops from
the bite, ﬁrst as a macule and then a spreading annular lesion with central clearing.
This stage is associated with constitutional upset; fever and lymphadenopathy are not
uncommon. Arthralgia, rather than arthritis, is also a feature. Stage 1 tends to last a
few weeks.
• Stage 2 is disseminated disease. It characteristically occurs within a few months of
the rash and is dominated by neurological syndromes. The most common presentations are cranial neuropathies (particularly the seventh cranial nerve, as in this case),
headaches, meningoencephalitis and mononeuritis multiplex. Cardiac manifestations
include heart block and myocarditis. Although arthralgia and peri-articular disease are
not uncommon, true synovitis occurs only in stage 3 disease.
• Stage 3 produces chronic infection up to two years after the initial infection and leads
to asymmetrical oligoarthritis, particularly at the knee.
Diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on the clinical picture and serological evidence of
antibodies to Borrelia, but test results are complicated by a high rate of false positives in
endemic areas and false negatives in early disease. The prompt use of antibiotics in stage
1 may also diminish diagnostic yield. PCR, however, can detect Borrelia DNA in blood,
synovial ﬂuid and tissue and cerebrospinal ﬂuid.
The treatment of Lyme disease is antibiotic therapy, the dose and route of administration
depending on stage and severity of disease. Second- and third-generation cephalosporins
tend to be the treatment of choice, with oral courses of up to 1 month for cutaneous
disease alone and intravenous regimens for disseminated disease, but expert advice
should be sought from microbiological services. Localized joint disease may respond
well to intra-articular injection, synovectomy or hydroxychloroquine in addition to antimicrobial therapy.
KEY POINTS

• Lyme disease occurs following a tick bite.
• The characteristic features are rash, arthritis and nerve block.
• Treatment is with antimicrobial therapy.

CASE 91:

RASH AND ABDOMINAL PAIN IN AN ADOLESCENT

History
A 17-year-old youth is referred urgently to the rheumatology department with a rapidly
progressing rash over his buttocks and legs, and severe, cramping abdominal pain. The
rash began as ﬂat, red areas which became ‘bumpy’ and then developed into palpable
dark red–purple lumps that fail to blanch on pressure. The abdominal pain occurs in
spasms and does not appear to relate to food. His bowel habit is unchanged.
Examination
This youth is well but clearly very uncomfortable. His pulse rate is 84/min and blood
pressure 117/62 mmHg. He has palpable purpura over his buttocks and the backs of his
legs. His right ankle is mildly synovitic but otherwise his joints are normal and he has no
other stigmata of inﬂammatory disease. Palpation of his abdomen reveals diffuse tenderness but no guarding or rebound. There is no organomegaly and normal bowel sounds
are audible.
INVESTIGATIONS
A urine dipstick reveals 3+ protein but no blood.

Questions
• What are the common causes of purpura?
• What is the likely diagnosis in this case?
• How can this diagnosis be confirmed?
• How would you manage this patient?

255

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 91
Purpura are the result of a spontaneous extravasation of blood from the capillaries into
the skin. If small they are known as petechiae, when they are large they are termed ecchymoses. There is an extensive differential diagnosis for purpura:

!

Causes of purpura
Infection

Meningococcal disease (consider in any patient as it carries a high
mortality)
Infective endocarditis
Septicaemia

Thrombocytopenia

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
Marrow failure of any cause

Vascular defect

Senile or steroid-induced purpura
Vasculitis (especially Henoch–Schönlein purpura)

Coagulation defect

Haemophilia

Drugs

Steroids
Sulphonamides

The combination of palpable purpura (distributed particularly over the buttocks and
extensor surfaces of legs), abdominal pain, arthritis and renal disease is a classic presentation of Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP). HSP is a distinct and frequently self-limiting
small-vessel vasculitis that can affect any age; but the majority of cases present in children aged 2–10 years, in whom the prognosis is more benign than the adult form, often
remitting entirely within 3–4 months. The abdominal pain may mimic a surgical abdomen
and can presage intussusception, haemorrhage or perforation. The arthritis, in contrast, is
relatively mild and tends to affect the knees and ankles. Renal disease is generally mild
in children, but its presence and severity determine the prognosis of the condition. Many
will experience only a mild glomerulitis with microscopic haematuria, but a crescentic
glomerulonephritis may occur, with the development of nephrotic syndrome or acute
renal failure.
The diagnostic test is a skin biopsy which reveals a leucocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA
deposition in the affected blood vessels; IgA is also detectable in the renal mesangium.
Treatment depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, no speciﬁc therapy is
necessary. The arthritis will in general respond to non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs); steroid therapy is reserved for those with severe abdominal symptoms. If renal
disease is severe (deteriorating renal function, hypertension, nephrotic syndrome or crescents on renal biopsy), high-dose steroids and cytotoxics such as cyclophosphamide may
be effective ﬁrst-line; plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin may be tried in
refractory cases.
KEY POINTS

• Consider HSP in a patient with purpura affecting the back of the legs preferentially.
• Abdominal pain in these patients is a sinister symptom.
• The disease is milder in children and frequently remits spontaneously.

CASE 92:

WEIGHT LOSS AND CLAUDICATION IN A
YOUNG WOMAN
History
A 24-year-old Asian woman presents to her general practitioner with dramatic weight
loss and intermittent fever. Her symptoms have been present for several weeks, but over
the last few days she has developed difﬁculty walking. Although previously very ﬁt and
active, she can now walk only a quarter of a mile before developing fatigue and cramping
pain in her calves that forces her to stop. Once she has rested for a while, she is able to
continue walking again, but the symptoms return.
Examination
This young woman is well but her GP is unable to detect a blood pressure from the left
arm: the pulses are absent on that side and a subclavian bruit is clearly audible. The
opposite arm is normal. Further examination of her vascular system reveals another bruit
over her right femoral artery with decreased pulses distally on the same side. The rest of
her pulses are present and the remainder of her physical examination is normal.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• Are any particular blood tests helpful prior to referral?
• What investigation will the rheumatology department request?
• What is the management of this condition?

257

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 92
This patient gives an excellent history of claudication. She has both symptoms and signs
of vascular insufﬁciency but is far too young to have straightforward atheromatous disease. The most likely cause is a large-vessel vasculitis and her age and racial origin make
Takayasu’s arteritis the most likely cause.
Takayasu’s arteritis is an occlusive vasculitis leading to stenoses of the aorta and its
principal branches. The symptoms and signs of the disease depend on the distribution of
the affected vessel but upper limbs are generally affected more commonly than the iliac
tributaries. There are three phases to the disease:
• initial pre-pulseless stage with constitutional upset (fever, weight loss)
• inﬂammatory stage with vessel pain and tenderness
• pulseless stage with ischaemic symptoms.
Since the disease is a chronic relapsing and remitting condition, patients do not proceed
predictably through individual stages but may experience all three types of symptoms
simultaneously.
There are no speciﬁc blood tests for suspected Takayasu’s arteritis, but the detection of an
elevated inﬂammatory response and an anaemia of chronic disease or thrombocytosis are
supportive, so a full blood count and ESR might prove useful at the point of referral. The
investigation of choice that the rheumatology department will request is angiography,
which reveals long-segment stenoses. Although MR angiography (MRA) is an alternative
and carries no radiation risk, it may miss more proximal or distal stenoses. If the clinical
picture and arteriography are characteristic, there is no need to proceed to biopsy.
The mainstay of treatment is high-dose corticosteroids plus a steroid-sparing agent such
as methotrexate. Bone protection is mandatory with the corticosteroids, and aspirin and
antihypertensives should also be considered. Cyclophosphamide is reserved for those
patients who do not achieve remission with standard therapy. Surgical intervention such
as bypass or angioplasty may improve ischaemic symptoms once the inﬂammation is
under control.
KEY POINTS

• Takayasu’s arteritis is known as the pulseless disease and is a cause of vascular
insufficiency in those too young for atheromatous disease.

• Angiography is diagnostic.
• Surgery may be required once the patient is in remission.

CASE 93:

SWOLLEN CHEEKS IN AN ELDERLY MAN

History
A 79-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with bilaterally swollen cheeks.
He also complains of feeling ‘tired all the time’, weight loss and occasional night sweats.
Although he admits to an irritating dry cough he denies frank breathlessness or change in
exercise tolerance. His medical history includes hypertension, for which he takes ramipril.
Examination
This elderly man is slightly pale, with bilateral parotid enlargement and cervical
lymphadenopathy.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis for bilateral parotid enlargement?
• What other symptoms would you ask about in the history?
• What would you look for on physical examination?
• What screening tests would you consider?
• What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

259

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 93
The most common causes for bilateral parotid swelling in adults include:
• Sjögren’s syndrome
• sarcoidosis
• lymphoma.
This patient’s symptoms are relatively non-speciﬁc but there are some direct questions
that may lead you to suspect one potential diagnosis over another.
Patients with Sjögren’s syndrome may report dry eyes (often described as gritty rather
than dry) or a dry mouth, complaining that biscuits and bread are particularly difﬁcult
to swallow without water. Arthralgia is also a feature, but may be present in the other
conditions too. Dry eyes are assessed using Schirmer’s test: if the patient demonstrates
appropriate wetting of ﬁlter paper placed under the lower eyelid, signiﬁcant Sjögren’s is
unlikely. Screening tests for Sjögren’s include rheumatoid factor, ANA and anti-Ro and
anti-La antibodies.
Sarcoidosis tends to present with ankle (peri)arthritis, erythema nodosum and respiratory
symptoms due to interstitial lung disease. Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly
may also be evident on examination. Screening tests for sarcoidosis include checking
calcium and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels and a chest X-ray.
Lymphoma is one of the great mimics in medicine and can present in a myriad of ways.
The classic symptoms are of night sweats and weight loss; examination ﬁndings may be
limited to lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Investigations include immunoglobulins and serum electrophoresis.
This man has no history of the most common sicca features evident in Sjögren’s or the
arthropathy or rash associated with sarcoid. Although his dry cough might make you
consider sarcoid-related lung disease, his exercise capacity is undiminished and the ACE
inhibitor ramipril is the more likely culprit. His relatively advanced age makes malignancy one of the more likely differentials, and the combination of weight loss, night
sweats, parotid swelling and lymphadenopathy makes lymphoma the most likely diagnosis in this case.
KEY POINTS

• Bilateral parotid enlargement may be due to Sjögren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis or
lymphoma.

• Presentations of all three conditions may be relatively non-specific and rely on direct
questioning.

• Simple specific investigations may help to differentiate between potential causes.

CASE 94:

A SWOLLEN KNEE

History
A 35-year-old woman is seen in the emergency department with an acutely swollen left
knee. Despite the swelling, she complains of only minimal pain in the knee. There is no
history of trauma and she is otherwise entirely well with no other joint problems. She
denies risk factors for inﬂammatory disease and is on no regular medication.
Examination
Beyond a slightly warm effusion of the left knee her examination is totally unremarkable.
The admitting senior house ofﬁcer aspirates the effusion and discovers haemorrhagic
synovial ﬂuid.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• Which is the most likely in this case?
• How would you confirm the diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?

261

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 94
This woman has a haemarthrosis. The most common causes of blood in the joint are:
•
•
•
•

trauma
bleeding diathesis (including over-anticoagulation)
connective tissue disease (e.g. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome)
synovial tumours.

Given that she is previously ﬁt and well, with no history of trauma and no features of
connective tissue disease, the discovery of haemorrhagic synovial ﬂuid should raise the
possibility of a synovial tumour.
The most common primary synovial tumour is pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS).
PVNS is a benign tumour of the synovium or tendon sheath (in which case it is called
giant cell tumour of tendon sheath) which presents with isolated swelling in or near an
isolated joint or tendon. The tumour may invade into surrounding bone, causing erosions
or cysts.
The diagnosis is generally conﬁrmed by arthroscopy, biopsy and histological examination. Macroscopically the synovium is pigmented and proliﬁc with multiple villi, fronds
and nodularity. The histology is characteristic with demonstration of histiocytes, haemosiderin-containing cells and multinucleated giant cells. Alternatively (and probably most
appropriate in this case), MRI is also diagnostic as it highlights the haemosiderin-laden
nodules.
Management of PVNS is surgical, with complete synovectomy via an arthroscopic
approach.
KEY POINTS

• Consider synovial tumours in a patient with unexplained haemarthrosis.
• MRI is generally diagnostic.

263

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 95
This young girl has a persistent inﬂammatory arthopathy and an elevated acute-phase
response, which makes the likely diagnosis juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA affects
up to 0.1 per cent of the population and is classiﬁed broadly into:
•
•
•
•
•
•

oligoarticular arthritis (<5 joints; subdivided into persistent and extended)
polyarticular arthritis (>5 joints; subdivided into RF positive and RF negative)
systemic-onset JIA
enthesitis-related arthritis
psoriatic arthritis
other (not meeting above criteria).

The most common presentation for JIA is oligoarticular disease and (as in this case) the
knee is most commonly affected. Although initially fewer than ﬁve joints are affected,
after 6 months of disease the arthritis may progress to affect more than ﬁve joints; this
so-called ‘extended oligoarthritis’ carries a worse prognosis than the persistent counterpart. It is critical to bear in mind that up to 20 per cent of children with oligoarticular
disease develop anterior uveitis and the risk is higher in children who are ANA positive,
so this form of immunological screening is advisable. Since anterior uveitis may be
asymptomatic, early referral to ophthalmology services for slit-lamp examination is also
appropriate. If present, treatment of anterior uveitis is with topical steroid.
Polyarticular JIA essentially mirrors adult rheumatoid arthritis, with the exception of
two features: (a) the majority of polyarticular JIA patients are RF negative, and (b) JIA
may affect the distal interphalangeal joints (although curiously not in those who are RF
positive!). Systemic JIA disease has an identical presentation to adult-onset Stills with
spiking fevers, a salmon-pink evanescent rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly
and inﬂammatory arthritis. Enthesitis-related arthritis is linked to the presence of HLAB27 and often affects the lower limb, most commonly the foot, and sacroiliitis is rarer
than in adult disease. Childhood psoriatic arthritis tends to present as an oligoarthritis.
Fortunately children are generally more resistant to drug toxicity from NSAIDs or
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Given that this patient has not
improved on NSAIDs, it would be appropriate to opt for an intra-articular injection of
steroid into the affected knee and then resort to methotrexate in the face of recurrent
problems. For children with severe or resistant disease, the biologic therapy of choice is
etanercept, although it may cause ﬂares of eye disease in a minority of cases.
KEY POINTS

• The most common presentation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is oligoarticular disease.
• Check ANA status in a child with inflammatory oligoarthritis as it highlights those at
greater risk of developing anterior uveitis.

• Children tolerate NSAIDs and DMARDs better than adults!

CASE 96:

ACNE, ARTHRALGIA AND CHEST PAINS

History
A 22-year-old woman consults her general practitioner complaining of fever, joint pains
and chest pain. The joint pains began 3 weeks previously and affect the small joints of her
hands and wrists with moderate early-morning stiffness. The muscle pains are relatively
non-speciﬁc and are not associated with any loss of power. Overall she has derived some
beneﬁt from treatment with regular non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In
the last 48 hours, however, she has also developed a low-grade fever and a sharp rightsided chest pain on deep inspiration. She denies breathlessness or cough and has no risk
factors for pulmonary embolus. Her medical history includes acne, for which she has been
taking minocycline for the past year.
Examination
This young woman is well, with a normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturations. Her
temperature is 37.6°C. Although her joints are tender she has no objective evidence of
synovitis. Respiratory examination reveals a pleural rub over the painful area in the right
lower zone anteriorly but is otherwise normal.
The GP was concerned she has developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and ordered
some basic blood tests and an immunology screen.

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 96
This young woman has presented with arthralgia, serositis, a low-grade fever and positive anti-nuclear and histone antibodies. Her full blood count, inﬂammatory markers and
CK are normal, mitigating against infection, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE or inﬂammatory
myopathy. The use of the tetracycline minocycline for acne makes drug-induced lupus
the most likely unifying diagnosis.
Drug-induced lupus (DIL) generates a different spectrum of clinical manifestations from
idiopathic disease. DIL is less severe than idiopathic SLE, and nephritis or central nervous
system involvement is very rare. This case highlights the classic manifestations of DIL
with fever, myalgias, arthralgia/arthritis and pleuritis all being apparent. Interestingly a
signiﬁcant proportion of DIL patients with pulmonary involvement develop inﬁltrates,
which is relatively uncommon in idiopathic disease. In addition, the malar and discoid
rashes that are so characteristic for SLE are less common in DIL.
The diagnosis of DIL is made on the basis of the clinical picture, the presence of a precipitating drug and the immune proﬁle, which may help to differentiate drug-induced
and idiopathic disease.

The most common drugs responsible for a lupus-like syndrome are procainamide, hydralazine, quinidine, isoniazid, methyldopa, chlorpromazine and minocycline. Interestingly
minocycline induces anti-histone antibodies only in up to 15 per cent of cases, and up to
three-quarters of patients generate a positive pANCA.
Treatment involves stopping the offending medication and the symptoms will gradually
resolve. Some patients may use a course of NSAIDs to tide them over and a very small
minority with severe symptoms (e.g. pleuritis) may require corticosteroids.
It is worth remembering that the positive ANA may persist for months or even years
after resolution of the symptoms and it is not clinically relevant. Re-challenge with the
precipitating drug should be avoided wherever possible.
KEY POINTS

• Drug-induced lupus is less severe than SLE.
• It is generally associated with anti-histone antibodies.
• Clinical manifestations will disappear on stopping the drug, but the ANA may persist
for months or years.

CASE 97:

A BREATHLESS PATIENT WITH LUPUS

History
A 38-year-old man with an earlier diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is
admitted to the emergency department with progressive breathlessness. His diagnosis was
made several years previously while resident in India, on the basis of rashes, arthralgia,
ulcers and ‘lots of bad antibodies’. He was prescribed medication but admits he has never
complied except for a brief period when he took warfarin. He has become progressively
more breathless over the last few months, with his exercise tolerance falling from unlimited to only a few metres. He admits that his lupus symptoms have also been deteriorating
over the same period. There is no history of cough or infective symptoms.
Examination
This man has a marked malar rash and is short of breath at rest (18 breaths per minute).
His oxygen saturations on room air are 92 per cent at rest and on minimal exercise drop
to 85 per cent. His pulse rate is 93/min, blood pressure 118/68 mmHg. His jugular venous
pulse (JVP) is elevated with systolic v waves, and he has a pansystolic murmur over the
tricuspid area. There is also pulsatile hepatomegaly and pitting oedema to his knees.
Examination of the respiratory system is unremarkable.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis for the patient’s breathlessness?
• How would you investigate him?
• What are the treatment options?

267

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 97
This patient has progressive breathlessness, desaturates on exercise and has features of
right heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation. The diagnosis is pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The three main causes of PAH in patients with lupus include:
• interstitial lung disease
• pulmonary vasculopathy
• chronic thromboembolism.
In this case, vasculopathy or chronic pulmonary embolisms are the most likely given
the absence of clinical features of interstitial lung disease and his prior history of
warfarinization.

Appropriate investigations for PAH
Arterial blood gas

Assessment of respiratory failure

Pulmonary function tests

Identification of restrictive lung disease
Evaluation of gas transfer as measure of disease severity

Chest X-ray

Evidence of interstitial lung disease
Peripheral ‘pruning’ of vascular tree in occlusive vascular
disease

Echocardiography

Characterize degree of tricuspid regurgitation
Estimation of pulmonary arterial pressure
Evaluation of right ventricular function

CT-PA

Investigation of chronic thromboembolic disease

HRCT

Evaluation of interstitial lung disease (inflammatory vs fibrotic
change)

Cardiac catheterization

Formal evaluation of right heart pressures
Assessment of reversibility with vasodilators

In addition, the patient should have a full assessment for the complications of his SLE,
including an antibody and anti-phospholipid proﬁle. His peripheral oedema is probably
due to right heart failure; and his blood pressure is normal, suggesting his renal system
is uninvolved, but nonetheless his urine should be checked for protein and/or casts.
Management of PAH in these circumstances is based on management of the resultant
right heart failure with diuretics, digoxin to improve ventricular contractility and lifelong
anticoagulation. Patients who demonstrate improvement in their pulmonary pressures
with vasodilators may beneﬁt from calcium-channel blockade, intravenous prostacyclin
analogues or the endothelin antagonist bosentan. These patients should be referred to
specialist cardiorespiratory units experienced in the management of pulmonary arterial
hypertension.
KEY POINTS

• Pulmonary hypertension may develop as a complication of SLE.
• Basic investigations to assess the severity of PAH include chest X-ray, pulmonary
function tests and echocardiography and CT.

• Any patient with evidence of PAH should be referred promptly to a specialist unit for
further management.

CASE 98:

ANAEMIA AND WEIGHT LOSS IN A PATIENT WITH
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
History
A 79-year-old woman with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is reviewed in clinic.
Despite methotrexate therapy she has some persistent but mild early-morning stiffness
and swelling affecting her hands and wrists. She complains of being exhausted all of the
time and with a reduced appetite, and she has lost several kilograms in weight in the last
two months. She is a non-smoker and drinks only occasionally. Apart from the methotrexate she takes only paracetamol for pain. There is no other relevant medical histroy
and review of systems is otherwise normal.
Examination
This elderly woman is pale with evidence of recent weight loss. She has minimal synovitis in her metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and wrists. Examination is otherwise
unremarkable.

• What are possible causes of weight loss in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis?
• What is the most likely cause in this case?
• What is the most important investigation?

269

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 98
Weight loss is common in patients with inﬂammatory disease. The most important diagnoses to consider are:
• disease activity (likely, due to high levels of circulating cytokines, including TNF-a)
• occult infection
• malignancy.
In this case, the patient undoubtedly has uncontrolled disease activity; but her symptoms
and dramatic weight loss are out of keeping with her mild synovitis and only moderate
inﬂammatory response, so one should keep an open mind as to the underlying cause.
The critical feature of her full blood count is that the patient is profoundly anaemic.
Rheumatoid arthritis may case anaemia in several ways:
• anaemia of chronic disease
• drug-induced due to disease-modifying agents, such as methotrexate
• iron deﬁciency due to gastrointestinal blood loss (consider NSAID-induced peptic
ulcer disease or malignancy)
• associated haemolytic anaemia.
The majority of these causes lead to either normocytic or macrocytic anaemia; this
patient has microcytic red cells which suggest iron deﬁciency. Her reduced MCV is even
more marked considering her methotrexate therapy, which normally leads to a macrocytosis. Bear in mind that patients may develop anaemia for reasons independent of their
underlying inﬂammatory disease, so it is unwise to attribute a new anaemia simply to
their rheumatoid arthritis. A common cause of iron-deﬁciency anaemia in this age-group
is gastrointestinal malignancy, and this patient’s associated weight loss is also highly
suggestive of an occult cancer. The investigation of choice in this case is endoscopy of
the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts to identify a bleeding source, either an ulcer
or tumour.
KEY POINTS

• Anaemia and weight loss are both common in inflammatory disease and may be a
reflection of disease activity.

• Keep an open mind as to the underlying diagnosis in the presence of new clinical
•

270

features, or symptoms and signs that are out of keeping with the level of disease
activity.
The important other diagnoses to consider are occult infection or malignancy.

CASE 99:

A BREATHLESS PATIENT WITH DERMATOMYOSITIS

History
A 45-year-old woman has been admitted to the rheumatology ward with a diagnosis of
dermatomyositis. She is profoundly weak (muscle power 2/5 in all proximal groups) and
on admission received a pulse of intravenous methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide.
She remains on 60 mg prednisolone orally, bone protection and thromboprophylaxis. Ten
days after admission her muscle strength has not improved and the senior house ofﬁcer
is asked to review her as she has become acutely more breathless.
Examination
This woman appears exhausted and unwell with marked peripheral myopathy. She has a
temperature of 37.8°C and her oxygen saturation is 88 per cent on room air. Her pulse
rate is 92/min and blood pressure 125/86 mmHg. Her jugular venous pulse (JVP) is not
elevated and her heart sounds are normal with no peripheral oedema or evidence of deep
venous thrombosis. She is short of breath at rest (20 breaths per minute) with reduced
chest wall movements bilaterally. Her right mid-zone is dull to percussion with increased
vocal resonance. There are mild crackles throughout which clear with coughing.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis of breathlessness in this patient?
• What are the appropriate investigations?
• How would you manage her?

271

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 99
Patients with severe muscle weakness have several reasons for breathlessness. The main
differential diagnoses to consider are:
• ventilatory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness
• pneumonia, including due to aspiration and particularly in those who have received
immunosuppression
• interstitial lung disease
• pulmonary embolus due to immobility.
The clinical features in this case (fever and ﬁndings consistent with pneumonia), on a
background of profound immunosuppression, would make pneumonia the most likely
explanation for her deterioration. Infection is a signiﬁcant problem in this patient population: respiratory muscle weakness may lead to atelectasis and collapse which increase
the risk of infection. In addition, her orophayngeal muscles may be involved, leading to
aspiration. Although interstitial lung disease occurs in 5–10 per cent of dermatomyositis
patients, it typically develops more insidiously and presents with late or pan-inspiratory
crackles that do not clear with coughing (such clearing would be more suggestive of
transmitted sounds from upper airway secretions). Although she is on thromboprophylaxis which reduces the chance of pulmonary embolus and there is no history of pleuritic
chest pain or haemoptysis and her JVP is normal, thromboembolism should always be
considered.
Appropriate immediate investigations include:
• arterial blood gas to assess respiratory failure
• blood cultures to assess for infection
• chest X-ray looking for features of bronchopneumonia, collapse or interstitial lung
disease
• spirometry to assess reduction in vital capacity.
It would be appropriate to commence broad-spectrum antibiotics intravenously to cover
for aspiration and nosocomial infection (advice should be sought from local microbiology
services). She should receive chest physiotherapy to help clear secretions and reduce the
risk of lobar collapse. These patients may deteriorate rapidly and early review by respiratory and intensive care teams is appropriate.
KEY POINTS

• The differential diagnosis of breathlessness in patients with dermatomyositis includes
infection, ventilatory failure, interstitial lung disease and thromboembolism.

• Chest physiotherapy is central to management and should be instituted early.
• Seek advice from respiratory and intensive care teams promptly.

CASE 100:

ASTHMA, RHINITIS, FOOT DROP AND A RASH

History
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department unable to lift her right foot.
She was well the night before and noticed the problem immediately on waking in the
morning; she came straight to hospital as she was frightened she was having a stroke.
Her past medical history reveals poorly controlled adult-onset asthma for which she takes
inhaled steroids and beta-agonist, and persistent rhinitis for which she uses nasal spray.
She has no cardiovascular risk factors. She takes no oral medication and has no other
relevant medical or family history. Her only foreign travel was a two-week holiday in
Menorca 4 years ago. She does not smoke or drink.
Examination
This woman is well and not febrile. She walks with a high-stepping gait on the right side
to avoid her toes dragging on the ﬂoor. She has weakness of dorsiﬂexion and eversion of
the foot, with some reduced sensation over the top of the foot. There is a non-blanching
rash over her legs which she reports has been present for a week and is gradually deteriorating. The remainder of her examination is normal.

273

100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology

ANSWER 100
This patient has the clinical features of an acute common peroneal nerve palsy, with foot
drop and loss of sensation over the dorsum of the foot. In the absence of traumatic nerve
injury, the most likely underlying cause is mononeuritis multiplex. The most common
causes of mononeuritis multiplex are diabetes mellitus and the vasculitides; she has no
history of diabetes but does present with a vasculitic rash, history of adult-onset asthma,
rhinitis and a marked peripheral eosinophilia. The unifying diagnosis that encompasses
all these features is Churg–Strauss syndrome.
Churg–Strauss syndrome is a granulomatous vasculitis of small and medium-sized vessels
in association with a peripheral eosinophilia. It usually presents in those with a history
of allergy and the major clinical features listed in the box.

The diagnosis should be considered in any patient presenting with evidence of vasculitis
(in this case, non-blanching rash and mononeuritis multiplex), history of adult-onset
asthma, rhinitis or nasal polyposis and a peripheral eosinophilia. A signiﬁcant proportion
of patients have antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (characteristically pANCA) and
may have an elevated IgE. The diagnosis is often conﬁrmed with biopsy of an affected
organ (skin, nerve) which reveals a necrotizing vasculitis and small extravascular granulomas with central eosinophilic cores.
Churg–Strauss disease responds well to corticosteroid therapy. In this case, in which
neurological involvement is a predominant feature, high-dose oral prednisolone (1 mg/
kg up to 60 mg daily) or a pulse of intravenous methylprednisolone would be appropriate. Bone protection would also be mandatory and consideration may be given to the
use of steroid-sparing agents (e.g. methotrexate or azathioprine) if dose reduction proves
hard to achieve. Cyclophosphamide treatment is generally reserved for those with life- or
organ-threatening disease.
KEY POINTS

• Mononeuritis multiplex is a common presentation of systemic vasculitis.
• Consider Churg–Strauss syndrome in any patient with vasculitis, allergic history and
eosinophilia.

• Churg–Strauss syndrome responds well to corticosteroid therapy.

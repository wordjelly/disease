Chairman’s Note
is a pleasure to present the new edition of The Washington Manual ™
ItSubspecialty
Consult Series: Endocrinology Subspecialty Consult. This pocketsize book continues to be a primary reference for medical students, interns,
residents, and other practitioners who need ready access to practical clinical
information to diagnose and treat patients with a wide variety of disorders. Medical
knowledge continues to increase at an astounding rate, which creates a challenge for
physicians to keep up with the biomedical discoveries, genetic and genomic
information, and novel therapeutics that can positively impact patient outcomes. The
Washington Manual Subspecialty Series addresses this challenge by concisely and
practically providing current scientific information for clinicians to aid them in the
diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of common medical conditions.
I want to personally thank the authors, which include house officers, fellows, and
attendings at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes Jewish
Hospital. Their commitment to patient care and education is unsurpassed, and their
efforts and skill in compiling this manual are evident in the quality of the final
product. In particular, I would like to acknowledge our editors, Drs. Thomas J.
Baranski, William E. Clutter, and Janet B. McGill, and the series editors, Drs.
Katherine Henderson and Tom De Fer, who have worked tirelessly to produce
another outstanding edition of this manual. I would also like to thank Dr. Melvin
Blanchard, Chief of the Division of Medical Education in the Department at of
Medicine at Washington University School of Medicine, for his advice and
guidance. I believe this Subspecialty Manual will meet its desired goal of providing
practical knowledge that can be directly applied at the bedside and in outpatient
settings to improve patient care.

Preface
third edition of The Washington Manual ™ Endocrinology Subspecialty
This
Consult was written by Washington University endocrine fellows and faculty
members. The manual is designed to serve as a guide for students, house staff, and
fellows involved in inpatient and outpatient endocrinology consults. It is not meant
to serve as a comprehensive review of the field of endocrinology. Rather, it focuses
on practical approaches to endocrine disorders commonly seen in consultation, with
emphasis on key components of evaluation and treatment.
Several changes in content were made with the third edition. All chapters have
been updated to provide the latest information on the pathophysiology and treatment
of endocrine disorders. A new chapter has been added that covers Inpatient
Management of Diabetes. Drug dosing information was reviewed and updated in
each chapter. Clinical pearls are highlighted in boldfaced text within the chapters.
We are indebted to the remarkable efforts of the fellows and attending physicians
who contributed to the current edition of this manual and worked enthusiastically to
provide high-quality, contemporary, concise chapters.

Pituitary Adenomas
Zhiyu Wang and Julie Silverstein
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pituitary adenomas are benign neoplasms arising in the adenohypophysial cells.
Pituitary tumors constitute 10% of intracranial tumors.
The most frequent primary pituitary tumors are pituitary adenomas.
Pituitary adenomas occur in 10% to 15% of the general population1 and are
usually benign.
Most pituitary adenomas are sporadic, but some arise as a component of genetic
syndromes.
Pituitary carcinomas are rare.2

Classification
According to the tumor size, pituitary adenomas are classified as microadenomas
(<10 mm in greatest diameter) or macroadenomas (≥10 mm in greatest diameter).
Depending on the cell of origin, they can be hormone-producing, or functionally
inactive (Table 1-1).3

Etiology
Pituitary adenomas arise as a result of monoclonal pituitary cell proliferation.
Several different mutations have been associated with pituitary adenomas.4
Activating gsp mutations are present in 40% of GH-secreting adenomas. These are
point mutations of the G protein alpha subunit (Gs alpha) gene, which activate Gs
alpha protein and increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels,
leading to GH hypersecretion and cell proliferation.
H-ras gene mutations have been identified in metastatic pituitary carcinomas.
Pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) is abundant in all pituitary tumor types,
especially prolactinomas.
A truncated form of FGFR-4 is immunodetected in about a third of prolactinomas.
18

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) is characterized by combined tumor
formation or hyperfunction of pancreatic islets, anterior pituitary, and parathyroid
glands.
Carney’s complex is characterized by pituitary adenomas, cardiac myxomas,
schwannomas, and thyroid adenomas with spotty skin pigmentation.
Hypothalamic factors may promote and maintain growth of transformed pituitary
adenomatous cells. There is emerging data that dysregulation of cell-cycle control
proteins, and loss of reticulin network play a role in pituitary tumor formation.4
TABLE 1-1 FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF PITUITARY ADENOMAS

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The clinical presentation of pituitary adenomas depends on whether or not the
tumor is hormonally functional or nonfunctional and on whether or not there is
mass effect or hemorrhage.
19

The diagnosis is sometimes made when a pituitary tumor is found incidentally on
imaging studies performed for other reasons.5
Hormonal Hypersecretion
Prolactinomas (see Chapter 2, Prolactinoma)
Hyperprolactinemia causes hypogonadism in men and premenopausal women.
Men present with decreased libido and impotence. Women often present with
abnormal menses or infertility and galactorrhea.6 There is often a delay in the
diagnosis in postmenopausal women due to lack of clinical manifestations.
Somatotroph adenomas (see Chapter 3, Acromegaly)
Acromegaly is growth hormone oversecretion occurring in the postpubertal phase
of life. Gigantism is growth hormone excess that occurs before fusion of the
epiphyseal growth plates in children or adolescents. Acromegaly is characterized
by skeletal overgrowth and soft tissue enlargement. Acromegalic patients have an
increase in mortality related to associated cardiovascular, respiratory,
gastrointestinal, and metabolic disorders.7 The onset of acromegaly is insidious
and often results in a delay in diagnosis.
Corticotroph adenomas (see Chapter 14, Cushing’s Syndrome)
ACTH–secreting tumors cause Cushing’s disease. 8 The classic symptoms and
signs of hypercortisolism are not always present and are often not specific.
Obesity (predominantly central fat distribution), hypertension, glucose intolerance
or diabetes, hirsutism, and gonadal dysfunction are common. Hypercortisolism
produces skin thinning, easy bruising, abdominal striae, and proximal muscle
weakness (inability to climb stairs or rise from a deep chair). Psychiatric
abnormalities occur in 50% of patients (depression, lethargy, paranoia, and
psychosis). Long-standing Cushing’s disease can cause osteoporosis and aseptic
necrosis of the femoral and humeral heads. Patients may present with poor wound
healing and frequent superficial fungal infections.
Thyrotroph adenomas
Hyperthyroidism due to a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma is very rare.9
Thyrotroph adenomas usually present as large macroadenomas, and >60% are
locally invasive.
Gonadotroph adenomas
Gonadotroph adenomas are usually macroadenomas and present with visual
disturbances, symptoms of hypopituitarism or headache.10 Most are clinically
nonfunctioning.
Hormonal Hyposecretion (Hypopituitarism)
20

Hypopituitarism can be a result of any hypothalamic or pituitary lesion.11
Gonadotrophs are most commonly affected. Patients present with hypogonadism
with low or inappropriately normal FSH and/or LH levels (secondary
hypogonadism).
Corticotrophs and thyrotrophs are most resistant to mass effects and the last to lose
function. TSH or ACTH deficiency usually indicates panhypopituitarism. ACTH
deficiency causes secondary adrenal insufficiency. TSH deficiency causes
secondary hypothyroidism.
GH deficiency is often present when two or more other hormones are deficient.
Prolactin deficiency is rare and occurs when the anterior pituitary is completely
destroyed, as in apoplexy.
Mass Effect
Local effects are closely related to the size and location of the adenoma.
Headaches are common and may not correlate with the size of the adenoma.
Visual defects are also common.
Upward compression and pressure on the optic chiasm may result in bitemporal
hemianopsia, loss of red perception, scotomas, and blindness.
Lateral invasion may impinge on the cavernous sinus, leading to lesions of the
III, IV, VI, and V1 cranial nerves, causing diplopia, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia,
and facial numbness.
Direct hypothalamic involvement may cause several endocrine disorders such as:
Diabetes insipidus (see Chapter 4, Diabetes Insipidus).
Appetite/behavioral disorders (obesity, hyperphagia, anorexia, adipsia, and
compulsive drinking).
Sleep and temperature dysregulation.
Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, caused by inferior extension of the adenoma, is a
very rare presentation.
Uncinate seizures, personality disorders, and anosmia can occur if temporal and
frontal brain lobes are invaded by the expanding parasellar mass.
Pituitary Apoplexy
Pituitary apoplexy is an endocrine emergency, often resulting from spontaneous
hemorrhage and/or infarction of a rapidly growing or large pituitary adenoma.12
Symptoms include severe headache, neck stiffness, progressive cranial nerve
damage, bilateral visual disturbances, change in consciousness, cardiovascular
21

collapse, and coma. Acute adrenal insufficiency may also occur. Patients may
experience long-term pituitary insufficiency.
Pituitary imaging reveals intraadenomal hemorrhage and stalk deviation.

Differential Diagnosis
For a list of common sellar and parasellar masses, see Table 1-2.
Sellar/parasellar cysts
Craniopharyngiomas are the most common and are calcified, cystic,
suprasellar tumors arising from embryonic squamous cell rests of Rathke’s
cleft. Craniopharyngiomas have a bimodal peak of incidence, occurring
predominantly in children between the ages of 5 and 10 years; a second peak
occurs in late middle age.13 Craniopharyngiomas are slow growing. Large
craniopharyngiomas can obstruct CSF flow and cause increased intracranial
pressure. Children present with headache, vomiting, visual field deficits, and
growth failure. Adults may present with neurologic symptoms, anterior pituitary
hormone deficits, and DI.
Rathke’s cleft cysts are benign, noncalcified lesions that mimic hormonally
inactive adenomas or craniopharyngiomas. They have a particularly low
recurrence rate after partial excision.
Pituitary granulomas
Sarcoidosis of the hypothalamic-pituitary region occurs in most patients with
CNS involvement and can cause hypopituitarism with or without symptoms of
an intrasellar mass. Sarcoidosis has a predilection for the hypothalamus,
posterior pituitary, and cranial nerves.14 The most common hormonal
abnormalities are hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, mild hyperprolactinemia,
and DI.
Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis (LCH)
Langerhans’ histiocytosis is characterized by infiltration of dendtritic cells
(Langerhans’ cells). 15 It can be unifocal or multifocal and affect multiple
sites, such as bone, skin, lung, pituitary, hypothalamus, liver, and spleen.
LCH occurs more often in children and is almost always associated with
diabetes insipidus. Anterior pituitary dysfunction occurs in 20% of
patients.16
Hand–Schüller–Christian (HSC) disease includes the triad of DI,
exophthalmos, and lytic bone disease. Other features of the disease include
axillary skin rash and a history of recurrent pneumothorax. Children can
present with growth retardation and anterior pituitary hormone deficits.
22

MRI may reveal a thickened pituitary stalk or a diminished posterior pituitary
bright spot, and possibly bone lesions.
Hypophysitis is characterized by either focal or diffuse infiltration of the pituitary
by inflammatory cells.17
Lymphocytic hypophysitis affects mostly women in late pregnancy or during
the postpartum period. Other autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroiditis)
may also be present. The diagnosis is confirmed by histology or resolution of
the mass over time. Partial recovery of pituitary function and resolution of the
sellar mass can occur spontaneously or with use of corticosteroids and
hormone replacement.
Granulomatous hypophysitis is not usually associated with pregnancy.
Pituitary histology shows features of chronic inflammation and granulomas.
Pituitary hyperplasia usually presents as generalized enlargement of the
pituitary.18 Pituitary hyperplasia may be caused by:
Lactotroph hyperplasia during pregnancy
Thyrotroph hyperplasia secondary to long-standing primary hypothyroidism
Gonadotroph hyperplasia in long-standing primary hypogonadism
Very rarely, somatotroph hyperplasia in ectopic secretion of growth hormonereleasing hormone (GHRH)
TABLE 1-2 COMMON SELLAR AND PARASELLAR MASSES

23

Pituitary metastases most commonly arise from breast carcinomas (women) and
lung carcinomas. A rapidly enlarging mass is highly suggestive of a metastatic
lesion.19
Pituitary carcinomas are rare.19 They may produce GH, ACTH, or prolactin, or
they may be clinically nonfunctioning. The diagnosis can only be established when
the lesion metastasizes.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Hormonal hypersecretion
Prolactinoma
Serum prolactin levels are usually proportional to the tumor mass. Values are
24

generally >250 ng/mL in macroprolactinomas.6
Hyperprolactinemia between 20 and 200 ng/mL can be due to
microprolactinomas, stalk compression from a sellar masse, medication
induced hyperprolactinemia, or due to the “hook effect” (see Chapter 2,
Prolactinoma).
Acromegaly
GH secretion in normal subjects is pulsatile, diurnal, and affected by a
variety of factors.7
The initial laboratory tests to be ordered in a patient suspected of having
acromegaly should be IGF-1 and GH levels. Current guidelines recommend
an elevated IGF-1 and failure to suppress GH during an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) to confirm the diagnosis (see Chapter 3, Acromegaly).
Cushing’s disease
Patients with clinical signs or symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome should be
screened for Cushing’s disease with either a 24-hour urine free cortisol, a
low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, or a late-night salivary cortisol.8
An elevated ACTH level in the setting of biochemically confirmed Cushing’s
syndrome suggests either a pituitary source (Cushing’s disease) or ectopic
ACTH syndrome. A high-dose dexamethasone suppression test and/or
inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) can be used to differentiate between
the two (see Chapter 14, Cushing’s Syndrome).
TSH-secreting adenomas
Elevated thyroid hormone levels in the setting of an elevated or
inappropriately normal TSH suggests the diagnosis.9 An elevated pituitary
glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit (α-GSU) may be present.
Similar laboratory values may be seen in the presence of circulating
antibodies against TSH. Therefore, a methodologic interference in the
measurement of TSH must be ruled out. Dynamic testing, such as T3
suppression and TRH stimulation can be used to differentiate a TSHsecreting adenoma from thyroid hormone resistance syndromes.
Gonadotroph adenomas
Most non-functioning pituitary adenomas arise from gonadotroph cells.
Although circulating LH and FSH levels may be elevated in a minority of
patients, this is rarely clinically significant.
Hypopituitarism
Corticotropin deficiency (secondary adrenal insufficiency)
25

ACTH deficiency produces hypotension, shock, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and
hyponatremia (see Chapter 11, Adrenal Insufficiency).
Dynamic testing to evaluate the HPA axis can be done with a cosyntropin
stimulation test or insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
Cosyntropin stimulation test may be normal in recent-onset corticotropin
deficiency, because it takes time for adrenals to atrophy after acute
disruption of ACTH secretion.
Thyrotropin deficiency (secondary hypothyroidism)
A low serum free T 4 in the setting of an inappropriately low/normal TSH
suggests secondary hypothyroidism.20
A free T 4 level should be used as the follow-up test for secondary
hypothyroidism.
GH deficiency
Measurement of basal GH does not distinguish reliably between normal and
subnormal GH secretion.
Patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficits (three or four) and a low
IGF-1 are likely GH deficient.21
Low serum IGF-1 in a patient with pituitary disease may suggest the
diagnosis of GH deficiency.
Stimulation tests include the GHRH-arginine stimulation test and the insulin
tolerance test.
Gonadotropin deficiency (secondary hypogonadism)
May be secondary to hyperprolactinemia.
Normal menses in premenopausal women not on birth control suggests an
intact pituitary-gonadal axis. In female patients with abnormal menses, serum
LH/FSH, prolactin, and estradiol levels should be checked.
Low serum testosterone in the setting of an inappropriately low or normal LH
in males suggests the diagnosis.
Pituitary incidentalomas
Evaluation of pituitary incidentalomas should depend on the size of the lesion.
Macroadenomas should be screened for both hypersecretion
(hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, or Cushing’s disease) and hypopituitarism.
Visual field defects should also be evaluated if the tumor abuts the optic
chiasm.
Microadenomas should be screened only for hypersecretion. Evaluation for
26

hypopituitarism or visual abnormalities is not necessary unless the patient has
related symptoms or signs.
Asymptomatic non-functioning incidentalomas may be followed up by periodic
MRI for tumor growth. Tumor growth without treatment occurs in about 10% of
microadenomas and 24% of macroadenomas.5
Imaging Studies
Pituitary MRI: MRI with a focus on the pituitary (contiguous sections detect
lesions of 1 to 3 mm) is the best imaging study to visualize pituitary tumors.22 MRI
detects tumor effects on soft tissue structures, cavernous sinus or optic chiasm,
sphenoid sinus, and hypothalamus. T1-weighted sections in the coronal and
sagittal plane distinguish most pituitary masses. Pituitary adenomas usually take
up less gadolinium than the normal pituitary tissue but more than the CNS. T2weighted images are important for diagnosing high-signal hemorrhage. Teenage
girls exhibit increasing gland convexity during their menstrual cycle. During
pregnancy, the gland should normally not exceed 12 mm. A thickened stalk may
indicate the presence of hypophysitis, a granuloma, or an atypical chordoma.
Pituitary CT allows better visualization of bony structures, including the sellar
floor and clinoid bones. Calcifications associated with craniopharyngiomas,
which may not be visible on MRI, can be seen on CT.

TREATMENT
The goals of pituitary adenoma therapy are to alleviate local compressive mass
effects, to correct hormone hypersecretion, and preserve normal pituitary function.

Surgical Management
General indications:
Functioning GH-, TSH-, or ACTH-secreting adenomas, and nonfunctioning
macroadenomas.
Progressive compressive features including visual compromise,
hypopituitarism, or other CNS dysfunctions.
Hemorrhage especially with sudden visual field compromise.
Patients who are intolerant or resistant to medical therapy.
The transsphenoidal microsurgical approach is the procedure of choice for >90%
of pituitary tumors. The adenoma is selectively removed. Normal pituitary tissue
is identified and preserved if possible.
Major complications:
27

CSF leakage, DI, and SIADH are the most common transient complications
Iatrogenic hypopituitarism, permanent DI, or SIADH
Local damage

Radiotherapy
Pituitary irradiation is usually reserved for large tumors with incomplete resection
or for patients who have a contraindication for surgery.
Gamma knife delivers high-dose radiation to the tumor while sparing surrounding
tissue as compared to conventional radiation. They have similar long-term
efficacy.
Major complications include hypopituitarism (develops in up to 80% of patients
after 10 years), optic nerve damage, and brain necrosis. It is unclear whether or
not the risk of cancer is increased.

Medical Therapy
Dopamine agonists are usually the first line therapy for prolactinomas of all sizes.
They decrease hyperprolactinemia due to any cause and decrease the size and
secretion of most prolactinomas.6
Bromocriptine and cabergoline are both commonly used. Cabergoline is more
potent, better tolerated, and longer-acting as compared to bromocriptine.
Dopamine agonists can be added in combination with somatostatin analogs
(SSAs) for acromegaly therapy.
SSAs, including octreotide (Sandostatin) and lanreotide (Somatuline) bind to
somatostatin receptor subtypes (SSTRs) and act as inhibitors to a number of
endocrine cells.23
SSAs are the mainstay of medical therapy for acromegaly and TSH-secreting
pituitary adenomas.
The growth hormone receptor antagonist (Pegvisomant) inhibits peripheral GH
action. It is highly effective in reducing IGF-1 levels in acromegaly.
Temozolomide is an oral chemotherapeutic agent that has been used in the
treatment of aggressive pituitary tumors.24
Ketoconazole and metyrapone may be used to inhibit cortisol synthesis in
Cushing’s disease.8 Occasionally mitotane is used to achieve biochemical control.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Postsurgical patients should be evaluated for complete tumor resection and
28

hormone dysfunction in 4 to 6 weeks.
Follow-up after pituitary irradiation is essential, because the response to therapy
may be delayed and the incidence of hypopituitarism increases with time.
Follow-up MRI may not be necessary in patients with normal posttherapy pituitary
function, but should be done in patients with persistent or recurrent disease.

Prolactinoma
Mariko Johnson and Julie Silverstein
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Prolactinomas are prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors.

Classification
Based on size
Microprolactinomas are tumors <10 mm in greatest diameter.
Macroprolactinomas are tumors ≥10 mm in greatest diameter.
Based on local invasion
Microprolactinomas by definition are confined to the pituitary.
Macroprolactinomas can invade local structures such as the cavernous and
sphenoid sinuses and compress the optic chiasm.
Based on metastatic spread
Most prolactinomas are benign and confined to the pituitary.
Malignant prolactinomas are extremely rare and are defined by the presence of
metastases to the bone, lymph nodes, lung, liver, or spinal cord.

Epidemiology
Prolactinomas are the most common secretory pituitary tumors with an estimated
prevalence of 100 per million population.1 Large autopsy series have found
pituitary microadenomas in 10% of individuals.2 Prolactinomas account for 40%
of pituitary adenomas.3
Microprolactinomas occur more often in women with a female:male ratio of 20:1.4
Macroprolactinomas occur with similar frequency in men and women.4

Associated Conditions
31

Prolactinoma is the most frequent pituitary tumor occurring in the multiple
endocrine neoplasia syndrome.
Prolactinomas may also secrete other hormones. The most frequent mixed tumors
are growth hormone (GH)/prolactin-secreting adenomas.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Prolactinomas cause symptoms on the basis of hormonal secretion and mass effect.
Symptoms due to hyperprolactinemia can include galactorrhea and symptoms of
hypogonadism. Galactorrhea occurs via direct action of prolactin on the
estrogenized breast. Hypogonadism occurs due to inhibitory effects of prolactin
on gonadotropin secretion or via direct compression of gonadotrophs.
Therefore, hypogonadism can occur with tumors of any size and may be
reversible if prolactin levels are controlled.
Symptoms due to mass effect include headache and visual field defects.
Ophthalmoplegia and rhinorrhea are signs of more advanced disease.
Headaches are caused by the expanding tumor. Visual field defects are caused
by compression of the optic chiasm. Ophthalmoplegia may occur when tumors
expand laterally and invade the cavernous sinus. Rhinorrhea may occur if the
tumor invades the sphenoid or ethmoid sinuses or after rapid drug-induced
tumor shrinkage. Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency occur via direct
compression of thyrotrophs or corticotrophs by a macroprolactinoma. Unlike
hypogonadism, if these hormonal deficiencies are present as a result of a
macroprolactinoma, they are generally not reversible.
The clinical presentation of prolactinomas can vary based on the gender and age of
the patient.
Premenopausal women may present with galactorrhea and/or hypogonadism
(infertility, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea). Women who are amenorrheic for
long periods are at risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis and are less likely to
present with galactorrhea.
Postmenopausal women rarely present early in the course of disease since
menses are no longer present and galactorrhea is rarely present due to low
estrogen levels. Hyperprolactinemia is often not recognized in postmenopausal
patients until a prolactinoma has become sufficiently large to produce
symptoms of mass effect such as headache or visual field defects.
Men present with secondary hypogonadism and symptoms of decreased libido,
32

impotence, infertility, loss of body hair, or gynecomastia. More subtle
manifestations include decreased cognitive function and energy, and loss of
muscle and bone mass. Men almost never have galactorrhea.
The clinical presentation of prolactinomas can vary based on the size of the tumor.
Symptoms of mass effect generally only occur in the presence of a
macroadenoma.
History
The history should focus on symptoms of hormonal overproduction and mass effect.
It should also seek to define possible alternate causes for hyperprolactinemia.
Symptoms or history of hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, renal disease, or
cirrhosis should be sought. Current medications should be carefully reviewed. Any
family history of pituitary tumors or syndromes of endocrine neoplasia should be
noted.
Physical Examination
The physical examination should evaluate for bitemporal visual field defects,
galactorrhea (in premenopausal females), as well as for signs of hypothyroidism or
hypogonadism.

Diagnostic Criteria
The first requirement for a diagnosis of prolactinoma is a persistently
elevated prolactin level. The likelihood of prolactinoma can be roughly
estimated based on the degree of elevation in the prolactin.5
Levels above normal but <100 ng/mL: possible prolactinoma
Levels 100 to 200 ng/mL: likely prolactinoma
Levels >200 ng/mL: usually diagnostic of prolactinoma
Alternate causes of mild to moderate prolactin elevations should be considered
and if possible excluded (see Section on Differential Diagnosis).
Once persistent hyperprolactinemia is established and alternate causes excluded, a
pituitary protocol brain MRI should be performed to define tumor size and
anatomy. Microprolactinomas may be too small to be seen on MRI.
TABLE 2-1 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF HYPERPROLACTINEMIA:
MNEMONIC HIGH PROLACTIN

33

Differential Diagnosis
Many factors other than a prolactinoma can lead to hyperprolactinemia and a
differential diagnosis can be remembered using the mnemonic HIGH
PROLACTIN (Table 2-1).14
Medications
Many medications cause elevations in prolactin (Table 2-2). These include
dopamine antagonists as well as others.
Physiologic causes
Physiologic causes of increased prolactin levels include pregnancy and nipple
stimulation.
Lactotroph adenomas (prolactinomas)
Lactotroph hyperplasia
Lactotroph cells are inhibited by dopamine. Compression of dopamine-secreting
neurons, which are found in the hypothalamus and pituitary, releases this tonic
inhibition and permits lactotroph hyperplasia. Compression can occur due to tumors
of the hypothalamus, infiltrative diseases, disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary
stalk in head trauma, or non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas.
Hypothyroidism
Most patients with hypothyroidism have normal prolactin levels. Rarely, patients
with hypothyroidism present with elevated prolactin values. Thyroid hormone
replacement typically restores normal prolactin values.
Chest wall injury
Chest wall injuries, irritating lesions (e.g., herpes zoster), and spinal cord injuries
can activate neural reflexes similar to nipple stimulation and increase prolactin
levels.
34

TABLE 2-2 MEDICATIONS THAT MAY CAUSE HYPERPROLACTINEMIA

Renal or hepatic failure
Elevations in prolactin levels may be seen in renal or hepatic failure due to
decreased prolactin clearance.
Adrenal insufficiency
Glucocorticoids have a suppressive effect on prolactin gene transcription and
release.
Idiopathic hyperprolactinemia
In some patients with prolactin concentrations between 20 and 100 ng/mL, no cause
can be found. Some of these patients have undetectable lactotroph microadenomas.
Long-term follow-up has revealed that in one-third of these patients prolactin levels
return to normal, in 17% prolactin levels rise to 50% over baseline, and in the
remaining 50% prolactin levels remain stable or decrease.6
Macroprolactinemia (“Big Prolactin”)
Prolactin can circulate as a monomer or in aggregates (usually bound to IgG).
Monomeric hyperprolactinemia leads to classical symptoms and signs such as
35

menstrual disturbance and galactorrhea. In contrast, the presence of circulating
prolactin aggregates (macroprolactinemia) is felt to be a benign variant.7 In longterm follow-up of such patients, few had initial symptoms and none had symptom
progression.7 Macroprolactinemia can be distinguished from monomeric
hyperprolactinemia by polyethylene glycol precipitation. Some, but not all,
laboratories routinely test for macroprolactinemia.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Laboratory testing begins with a serum prolactin level.
If the serum prolactin is elevated, a serum TSH, a comprehensive metabolic panel,
and a pregnancy test (in premenopausal females) may be ordered to begin to rule
out secondary causes.
A prolactin with serial dilutions should be measured in all patients with a pituitary
macroadenoma who have a mild to moderate prolactin elevation to exclude the
Hook effect.
Distinguishing a prolactinoma from a nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma is
of utmost importance because prolactinomas are best treated medically,
whereas nonfunctioning tumors require surgery.
An immunoradiometric assay is frequently used for measurement of serum
prolactin levels. Falsely low values can occur when a large amount of prolactin
saturates the antibodies. This is known as the Hook effect.
Mild to moderate prolactin elevations (<200 ng/mL) in the setting of a pituitary
macroadenoma may be due to stalk compression but may also be due to the
Hook effect. This artifact can be excluded by performing an additional
prolactin determination on diluted serum. If the diluted specimen yields a value
that is the same or higher, the diagnosis of macroprolactinoma can be made.
Screening for hypopituitarism should be considered in all patients with
macroprolactinomas.
Imaging
MRI with gadolinium enhancement provides the best anatomic detail of the
hypothalamic-pituitary area.
Visual field testing should be obtained in patients with tumors that are adjacent to
or compressing the optic chiasm.

36

TREATMENT
All macroprolactinomas require treatment whether or not compressive
symptoms are present.
Not all microprolactinomas require treatment and should be treated only when
symptoms caused by hyperprolactinemia or rapidly increasing prolactin levels
indicative of an enlarging tumor are present. As such, microprolactinomas in
postmenopausal women rarely require treatment.
Prolactinomas are unique among pituitary tumors in that first-line treatment is
medical, not surgical.
The mainstays of management for prolactinomas are the dopamine agonists
bromocriptine and cabergoline.
Most patients will respond to therapy within weeks of initiation, as evidenced by
symptoms and prolactin levels. The majority of patients will also have a >25%
decrease in the size of the adenoma.3
A normal prolactin level should be the target of therapy for macroprolactinomas.
Restoration of gonadal function and relief from symptoms should be the goal of
therapy for microprolactinomas, and achieving a normal prolactin level may not
be necessary.

Medications
Bromocriptine
Bromocriptine is an ergot derivative D2 receptor agonist. It can be administered
orally once or twice a day at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg/day and produces reduction in
prolactin levels to the normal range in 70% to 90% of cases.1 Women resume
regular ovulatory menses, and galactorrhea should resolve after 2 to 3 months of
therapy. For macroprolactinomas, the reduction in tumor size is usually associated
with improved visual fields, reduction of hyperprolactinemia, and improvement in
other pituitary function (owing to reduced mass effect). Most series suggest that
bromocriptine therapy has little or no effect on later surgical results for
microadenomas; however, in patients with macroadenomas, bromocriptine treatment
lasting >6 to 12 weeks has been associated with perivascular fibrosis of the tumor,
which can complicate complete tumor resection.8 The most common side effects of
bromocriptine are nausea and vomiting. Orthostatic hypotension may occur when
initiating therapy.
Cabergoline
Cabergoline is a nonergot D2 receptor agonist with a long half-life, and can be given
37

orally at 0.25 to 1 mg twice a week. A large comparator study of cabergoline and
bromocriptine demonstrated the superiority of cabergoline over bromocriptine in
both efficacy and tolerability. 9 Cabergoline leads to a greater reduction in prolactin
secretion, decrease in tumor size, and improvement in gonadal function than
bromocriptine. Side effects are much less frequent and less severe than with
bromocriptine. Recent studies have shown that cabergoline can cause valvular
fibrosis at the higher doses used for treatment of Parkinson’s disease. 10 For
hyperprolactinemic disorders, a considerably lower dose of cabergoline is used. At
these lower doses, there appears to be minimal risk of valvular abnormalities though
large randomized studies have not yet been performed and the true risk remains to be
defined.10
Other dopamine agonists
Quinagolide is not yet approved for use in the United States.

Surgical Management
Pituitary surgery is reserved for patients who are refractory to or intolerant of
dopamine agonists, have persistent visual field deficits despite medical therapy, or
have other neurologic signs in the context of a cystic macroadenoma or pituitary
apoplexy.3 Pituitary surgery aimed at debulking the tumor to reduce the risk of
potential expansion is indicated for women with macroprolactinomas desiring
pregnancy. Trans-sphenoidal surgery by an experienced neurosurgeon can be offered
to patients with microadenomas who do not wish to receive lifelong medical
therapy.

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is not a primary therapy for prolactinomas. Its use is limited to patients
with macroprolactinomas that are refractory to medical treatment and surgery or in
the rare case of a malignant prolactinoma.3

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Pregnancy
During pregnancy, the normal pituitary increases in size, owing to marked
lactotroph hyperplasia due to the effect of estrogen on prolactin synthesis. The
risk of tumor expansion is small (<3%) for microprolactinomas but significant
(30%) for macroprolactinomas.11
Patients with prolactinomas wishing to become pregnant should be referred to
specialists in high-risk obstetrics and endocrinology.
38

No increase in adverse fetal events has been demonstrated with use of either
bromocriptine or cabergoline.12,13 However, experience with cabergoline in
pregnancy is more limited than bromocriptine, making bromocriptine the drug of
choice in pregnancy.
In women with microprolactinomas desiring fertility, bromocriptine should be
titrated to normalize prolactin levels and restore regular menses. Barrier
contraception should be recommended until menstrual cycles become regular so
that a pregnancy test can be performed immediately if a cycle is missed. Once
pregnancy is confirmed, bromocriptine should be discontinued in order to limit
fetal exposure to the drug.
In women with macroprolactinomas, control of tumor size should ideally be
attained prior to conception because of the growth potential of these tumors during
pregnancy. These patients should be pretreated with bromocriptine for a sufficient
period to cause substantial tumor shrinkage in addition to regular menses. Only
then should contraception be discontinued. If the tumor does not shrink sufficiently
in size, prepregnancy transsphenoidal surgical debulking can be considered. Once
pregnancy is achieved, bromocriptine should be discontinued followed by close
surveillance for symptoms of tumor enlargement.
Monitoring prolactin levels in pregnant patients is of no benefit, as levels do not
always rise during pregnancy and may not rise with tumor enlargement. Visual
field testing and imaging is reserved for patients with symptoms of tumor
enlargement. Reinstitution of bromocriptine therapy at the lowest effective dose
during pregnancy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic tumor
enlargement. Transsphenoidal surgery or delivery (if pregnancy is far enough
advanced) should be performed if there is no response to bromocriptine and
vision is progressively worsening.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Available guidelines suggest routine follow-up but do not specify an optimal
interval for biochemical or radiologic assessment.3
Our opinion is that once stable, prolactin levels should be followed on a yearly
basis and MRI evaluation should be repeated only if either clinical signs of tumor
growth appear or if prolactin levels rise significantly.
Visual field testing and MRI evaluation should be repeated at regular intervals if a
visual field defect was present at diagnosis.
Several recent studies demonstrate that cabergoline or bromocriptine can be
tapered safely in a subset of patients but the rate of remission has been variable
39

between studies.11
Tapering of dopamine agonists can be considered when the prolactin level has
been normal for at least 3 years and the size of the tumor has decreased
significantly.3 These patients require close follow-up to monitor for recurrence of
hyperprolactinemia and tumor growth.

Acromegaly
Nadia Khoury and Julie Silverstein
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acromegaly is a disorder characterized by overproduction of growth hormone
(GH).
Overproduction of GH results in progressive skeletal, skin, and organ growth that
is associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality if left untreated.

Definition
Acromegaly is growth hormone oversecretion occurring in the postpubertal phase
of life.
When GH oversecretion occurs before puberty, it may cause rapid growth and
hypogonadism with failure of growth-plate closure, resulting in gigantism.

Epidemiology
The incidence of acromegaly is low—about three cases per million people per
year.
Acromegaly is insidious, resulting in a lag time between disease onset and
diagnosis. Older studies indicate this was almost 10 years but newer studies
indicate this has decreased to 2 to 3 years.1

Pathophysiology
Acromegaly is most commonly due to a pure somatroph pituitary adenoma (60%).
Adenomas that secrete a combination of growth hormone and prolactin are also
seen (25%). Adenomas that secrete GH and TSH are rare.2
Molecular studies of the pathogenesis of somatotroph adenomas are ongoing. A
mutation in the Gsα protein has been seen in up to 40% of somatotroph
adenomas.2
GH secretion, stimulated by GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) from the
hypothalamus, causes increased IGF-1 secretion from the liver. Normally, GH
42

secretion is inhibited by both somatostatin from the hypothalamus and insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) from peripheral tissue. IGF-1 causes growth of bone and
cartilage, impaired glucose tolerance, and changes in protein and fat metabolism.

DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of acromegaly involves first recognizing the phenotype and then
performing the appropriate hormonal work up. Lastly, imaging of the pituitary is
performed.

Clinical Presentation
Patients with acromegaly present with skeletal overgrowth and soft tissue
enlargement. Changes can be subtle over time and may best be recognized by
comparing previous photographs of the patient. Symptoms related to hormonal
deficiencies may arise as a result of compression of the remaining pituitary gland by
the enlarging mass.
History
Patients may complain of having to increase hat, ring, or shoe size.
Headache is the second most common symptom, even when the adenoma is small.
The voice tends to be deeper, related to sinus and laryngeal hypertrophy.
Malodorous sweating, especially at night, may occur.
Paresthesias related to carpal tunnel syndrome and other peripheral neuropathies
occur, as do visual disturbances related to increased skeletal growth in the skull
or to compression of the optic chiasm by the pituitary adenoma.
Arthralgias and myalgais occur in 30% to 70% of patients with large joints
affected more prominently. Spinal osteoarthritis with resulting backache, usually
in the lumbar spine, also occurs. Rarely, spinal involvement leads to nerve
compression leading to lumbar spinal stenosis or sciatica.3
Dyspnea at rest or with exertion can happen with more advanced disease due to
remodeling of myocardium.
Endocrine symptoms related to compression of the remaining pituitary gland can
be those of hypothyroidism (cold intolerance, fatigue, weight gain), hypogonadism
(reduced libido, infertility, irregular menses), and hyperprolactinemia (irregular
menses, galactorrhea).
Physical Examination
Hypertension occurs in 20% to 50% of patients.4
43

The extremities are broad with wide, thick, and stubby fingers.
The nose is widened and thickened, the forehead and cheekbones are prominent,
and facial lines are more visible. Mandibular overgrowth leads to prognathism,
teeth separation, and jaw malocclusion.
Skin can be sweaty and oily (70%), as well as coarse and thick. Skin tags occur
more frequently and can grow in size.
While arthropathy occurs, objective findings are less prominent. Decreased joint
mobility may be seen in later disease. Joint effusions are rare.

Differential Diagnosis
Other causes of increased growth hormone must be excluded. Exogenous use of
GH should be considered in adolescent patients and body builders.
Pituitary somatotroph carcinoma is exceptionally rare.
Extra-pituitary GH oversecretion is rare but can occur with ectopic pituitary
adenomas in the sphenoid sinus or nasopharyngeal cavity or, much more rarely, by
a peripheral tumor such as a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. GHRH
hypersecretion that causes pituitary somatotrophs to oversecrete GH has been
seen with pancreatic and bronchial carcinoid tumors.
Acromegaly is seen with the genetic syndromes of McCune–Albright and Carney
complex. Acromegaly can be seen as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type
1 (MEN1) syndrome.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
The initial laboratory tests for a patient suspected of having acromegaly should be
IGF-1 and GH levels. Current guidelines recommend an elevated IGF-1 and
failure to suppress GH during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to confirm
the diagnosis. An OGTT may not be needed if GH and IGF-1 levels are elevated
in a patient with clear signs and symptoms of acromegaly.5
During an OGTT, blood is drawn at baseline for glucose and GH levels, 75 grams
of oral glucose is administered, and then blood is drawn for GH and glucose
every 30 minutes for 2 hours. Using ultrasensitive assays, if the GH level falls to
<0.3 mcg/L during the OGTT, acromegaly is excluded.4 False positives may occur
in patients with diabetes, chronic hepatitis, renal failure, and anorexia. Patients
with acromegaly can have suppressed GH levels (<0.3 mcg/L) during an OGTT.6
TRH or GHRH stimulation tests should not be used because they yield discordant
44

results.7
Assessment of the remainder of pituitary hormones, including measurement of
prolactin and free T4, should also take place. If indicated by symptoms, a
cosyntropin stimulation test to diagnose adrenal insufficiency may be needed.
Imaging
The initial imaging study should be magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
brain, with and without gadolinium contrast to evaluate for pituitary adenoma.
Radiographs of the extremities and cranium will show abnormalities related to
bone and cartilage overgrowth. Bone mineral density is not significantly
decreased but there is a higher prevalence of vertebral fractures.
Echocardiography can show hypertrophy of the interventricular septum and left
ventricular posterior wall as well as diastolic, and less often systolic,
dysfunction.

TREATMENT
The goals of treatment include relief of symptoms, reduced tumor volume, and
improvement of long-term morbidity and mortality. A GH level <1 mcg/L and an
IGF-1 level in the normal range is the goal.5
If left untreated, acromegalic patients live on average 10 years less than control
patients. Death is most commonly due to cardiovascular disease.
An algorithm presenting the three major treatment modalities is presented in Figure
3-1.

Medications
In general, all medical therapy for acromegaly should stop if a woman becomes
pregnant, due to lack of available safety information.8
Somatostatin Analogs
Somatostatin analogs, including octreotide (Sandostatin) and lanreotide
(Somatuline), act as agonists on somatostatin receptors on the tumor to decrease
GH secretion. These drugs are also available as monthly depot injections.
They achieve adequate IGF-1 suppression in up to 50% of patients.9
The use of these agents is most appropriate as first line therapy for tumors that
have a low probability of surgical cure, as a temporizing measure before surgery
to improve comorbidities, to control symptoms before radiation therapy achieves
full effects, or after surgery when full biochemical control is not achieved.8
45

The initial does of octreotide LAR is 10 mg IM q month. The dose is increased at
2 to 3 month intervals until plasma IGF-1 levels are normal or until a maximal
dose of 40 mg IM q month is reached.
FIGURE 3-1 Algorithm for Management of Acromeagly.
*Influence of tumor size on surgical outcome is uncertain. As a rough guideline,
tumor less than 2 cm has greater chance of surgical success.

The initial dose of lanreotide is 60 mg via deep SC injection q month. The dose is
increased as above until IGF-1 levels are normal or a maximal dose of 120 mg q
month is reached.
Side effects include abdominal bloating and cramping, which occur early and
46

usually improve over the first few months of treatment. Gallstones occur more
frequently but usually do not cause acute cholecystitis. Rarely, pancreatitis can
occur.
Patients should remain on the same dose for 3 months to assess adequacy of
treatment.
GH Receptor Antagonist: Pegvisomant
Pegvisomant (Somavert) blocks GH action in peripheral tissues by antagonizing
the GH receptor. This agent can be used when adequate biochemical control is not
achieved with other treatment modalities and possibly as monotherapy or in
combination with a somatostatin analog.
This results in normalization of IGF-1 levels in 89% of patients; however, a
significant rise in GH levels is seen. It is unclear whether or not this increase in
GH levels is associated with an increase in tumor size; however, two patients
have required surgery for rapidly enlarging pituitary tumors while receiving
pegvisomant.10
The initial dose is 10 mg SC q day. The dose is increased in 5 mg increments at 4week intervals until plasma IGF-1 is normal or a maximal dose of 30 mg is
reached.
25% of patients have elevated liver enzymes so these should be followed every 6
months.
Dopamine Agonists
The dopamine agonist cabergoline (Dostinex), inhibits secretion of GH by
stimulating dopaminergic receptors on the adenoma, though only <10% achieve
biochemical control with monotherapy.11
The initial dosing of carbegoline is 0.25 mg twice per week.
Side effects include nausea and orthostatic hypotension, so the medication should
be started at low doses and gradually titrated up. With long-term therapy, there
may be an increased risk of cardiac valvular abnormalities.

Radiation Therapy
Radiation therapy should never be used as first-line therapy. It is usually employed
after surgery fails to achieve hormonal control or decrease tumor growth.
Both conventional fractionated radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy
(gamma-knife) have been used to treat somatotroph adenomas. Treatment with
gamma-knife therapy appears to provide faster normalization of GH levels
47

(though studies are flawed by selection bias), with less damage to surrounding
brain tissue. Use of gamma-knife therapy is limited by tumor size and proximity to
the optic nerves.12
Full response to treatment with fractionated therapy may not be seen for up to 15
years.
Up to 60% of patients develop hypopituitarism after radiotherapy, with this rate
equal in conventional radiotherapy and gamma-knife therapy at 5 to 10 years.
There may be an increased risk of secondary tumors and stroke over time with
both forms of radiotherapy.8

Surgical Management
Surgery results in the most rapid reduction in GH levels. However, its efficacy
depends on the size of the adenoma and the experience of the surgeon.
Control rates quoted in studies are best achieved with an experienced
neurosurgeon, performing at least 50 pituitary operations per year.13
Trans-sphenoidal surgery is appropriate for intrasellar microadenomas,
noninvasive macroadenomas, and when the tumor is causing compressive
symptoms. Craniotomy is rarely required. Control rates for macroadenomas are
lower (~50%) than for microadenomas (90%). Tumors with cavernous sinus
involvement or transcapsular intraarachnoid invasion have even lower cure rates.

COMPLICATIONS
The standardized mortality ratio for patients with acromegaly is 1.72. Insulin
resistance develops due to elevated IGF-1 levels. Patients must be screened for
development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Pituitary dysfunction, including hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, adrenal
insufficiency, and hyperprolactinemia may occur due to local tumor effects and
must be adequately screened for as described in Diagnostic Testing section.
Obstructive sleep apnea occurs in 25% to 60% of patients with acromegaly.
Though this may improve with treatment of acromegaly, some will continue to
require nocturnal positive end-expiratory pressure.
Cardiovascular morbidity is increased related to hypertension, left ventricular
hypertrophy, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and arrhythmias. Standard
management of these complications is needed.
Although it is controversial whether or not acromegalics have an increased risk of
cancer, the rate of death is higher in patients with acromegaly who have colon
cancer.4 Current guidelines recommend at least one baseline colonoscopy and
48

follow-up based on international guidelines for colonic polyps.8

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Biochemical testing:
In patients who have undergone surgery, IGF-1 and GH levels should be
checked 3 months after surgery. An IGF-1 level in the normal range or random
GH <1 mcg/L by ultrasensitive assay define control.5
An OGTT can also be used to assess outcome. Although many authors
recommend using a nadir GH level <0.3 mcg/L to define control, current
guidelines recommend a nadir GH level <0.4 mcg/L.14
Only IGF-1 levels are measured with GH receptor antagonist therapy and the
OGTT should not be used in patients receiving somatostatin analogs. A full
assessment of pituitary function should occur 3 months after surgery.
Ongoing assessment for pituitary dysfunction is needed after radiation therapy.
Tumor control by imaging
Repeat MRI can be performed at 3 to 4 months after surgery to establish a
baseline. Initial MRI after starting medical therapy should be at 3 to 6 months.8
The subsequent timing of MRI depends on disease control. If disease control is
achieved by surgery, MRI may only be needed every 2 to 3 years. In patients
who are not adequately controlled, MRI should likely be followed yearly.
With growth hormone receptor antagonist therapy, an MRI should be performed
6 months after initiation of therapy and then yearly because of the potential risk
of tumor enlargement.

Diabetes Insipidus
Prajesh M. Joshi and Julie Silverstein
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder of water balance caused by the non-osmotic
renal loss of water leading to the excretion of a large volume of dilute urine.
Polyuria is defined by a 24-hour urine output >30 to 50 mL/kg in adults and >100
mL/kg in children.1

Classification
Central DI is caused by either complete or partial deficiency of antidiuretic
hormone (ADH) secretion from the posterior pituitary gland.
Nephrogenic DI is caused by end-organ unresponsiveness of the kidneys to ADH.
It can be complete or partial.
Dipsogenic DI is caused by excessive and inappropriate fluid intake due to a
defect in thirst mechanism.1,2

Epidemiology
All forms of DI are rare with an estimated prevalence of central DI of 1/25,000. 3
No gender predilection has been seen. Most cases present in adulthood, although
familial central DI and nephrogenic DI usually present during childhood.
Overall incidence of transient DI after transsphenoidal surgery of the pituitary has
been reported to be 18.3% to 31%, while only 0.5% to 2% of patients develop
permanent dysfunction. Approximately 67.5% to 80% of patients with clinical
evidence of postoperative DI need treatment with DDAVP (an ADH analog) at
least once during the course of their management.1

Etiology
See Table 4-1 for a list of causes of diabetes insipidus.
51

Central DI is caused by destruction of ADH-producing cells in the hypothalamus
and posterior pituitary gland. The destruction can be traumatic, infectious,
neoplastic, or infiltrative in origin resulting in complete or partial lack of ADH.
Nephrogenic DI is caused by either congenital or acquired impaired renal
responsiveness to ADH.

Pathophysiology
ADH is synthesized in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the
hypothalamus and transported to the posterior pituitary gland for storage and
secretion. Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus are very sensitive to changes in
plasma osmolality, primarily determined by the sodium concentration.
The release of ADH is inhibited until the osmolality rises above a threshold level,
after which ADH secretion rises rapidly in proportion to the plasma osmolality.
ADH is also secreted in response to volume depletion.
TABLE 4-1 CAUSES OF DIABETES INSIPIDUS

52

ADH primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to
increase water reabsorption.
The effects of ADH are mediated via a G protein-coupled V2 receptor that signals
the translocation of aquaporin-2 channels into the apical membrane of the
principal cells in the collecting duct. In conjunction with aquaporin-3 and
aquaporin-4 channels on the basal–lateral surface of these cells, water is then
allowed to flow freely down the osmotic gradient from the relatively dilute
tubular fluid to the highly concentrated renal medulla. Therefore, decreased
production or activity of ADH results in impaired water reabsorption in the
nephron, leading to a dilute urine and loss of free water.
An intact thirst mechanism is very effective in preventing hypernatremia
(hypertonic dehydration). DI leads to a decrease in the absorption of free water
which leads to an increase in basal plasma osmolality of as little as 1% to 2%
which is sufficient to induce thirst. Once this threshold is reached, even a small
53

increase in hypertonicity stimulates a very large increase in water intake, which
prevents hypernatremia.

DIAGNOSIS
Patients with DI present with increased thirst and polyuria, with urine volume
typically exceeding 3 L/day. Symptoms of hypernatremia (e.g., weakness, altered
mental status, coma, or seizures) may develop with significant or rapid dehydration.

Clinical Presentation
History
A thorough history including the patient’s age, the rate of onset, duration and
degree of polyuria, family history, history of head trauma/surgery, dietary habits,
fluid intake, the presence/absence of thirst, the presence of headaches or vision
changes, medication history, the presence of psychiatric illness, and a history of
diabetes mellitus and/or renal failure is essential for diagnosis and to differentiate
DI from other causes of polyuria.
A history of nocturia is often present in DI.
Patients with DI often crave cold liquids.
Physical Examination
Orthostatic hypotension and skin tenting may be signs of volume depletion.

Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnosis of DI is made when polyuria is present in the setting of an
inappropriately low urine osmolality (<300 mOsm/kg) for a given plasma
osmolality. The urine specific gravity is usually <1.001 to 1.010.1,2
Plasma sodium may be normal or elevated (i.e., in someone who does not have an
intact thirst mechanism).

Differential Diagnosis
Several conditions can present with polyuria. Simultaneous measurement of urine
and plasma osmolality is essential to differentiate the various causes.
Hypotonic polyuria (Uosm <300 mOsm/kg) can be either physiologic (due to an
increase in free water intake leading to appropriate suppression of ADH, free
water diuresis, and a normal serum osmolality) or pathologic (due to a decrease
in the production or action of ADH).
54

A fully concentrated urine (urine osmolality 800 to 1200 mOsm/kg) in the
setting of hypernatremia essentially rules out DI and other causes should be
considered (e.g., insensible water losses from skin, lungs, and GI tract and/or salt
loading from feedings, medications, or intravenous fluids).
Non-hypotonic polyuria (Uosm >300 mOsm/kg) is caused by solute diuresis,
most commonly due to diuretics and hyperglycemia. Glucosuria in the setting of a
urine specific gravity >1.010 is characteristic of polyuria due to hyperglycemia. If
glucose is absent in the urine, other less common types of solute diuresis (such as
relief from urinary obstruction, recovery from renal failure, or administration of
large amounts of sodium, mannitol or radiocontrast dye) should be considered.
If hyponatremia is present, polyuria is most likely due to primary polydipsia.
Chronic hypokalemia and hypercalcemia can cause partial nephrogenic DI. On
the other hand, hypokalemia can also be a consequence of DI, and hypercalcemia
can be caused by volume depletion. Patients with chronic kidney disease may also
develop partial DI as a consequence of defects in the renal concentrating capacity.

Diagnostic Testing
Water (Fluid) Deprivation Test
This is the standard method for differentiating polyuria caused by primary
polydipsia, central and nephrogenic DI.
This test is unnecessary, and could even be dangerous, in the setting of
hypertonic hypernatremia, in which primary polydipsia is not a consideration.
Likewise, if the patient has hypotonic hyponatremia, DI is virtually ruled out.
Therefore, a water deprivation test should only be performed in a patient with
hypotonic polyuria with a normal plasma sodium/osmolality.
Procedure
Drugs that influence ADH secretion or action should be discontinued if
possible. Caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco should be avoided for at least 24
hours.
Patient’s water intake is restricted starting after dinner unless the patient is
producing >10 L of urine/day, in which case the deprivation test is only done
during the day under close supervision. Body weight, plasma osmolality, serum
sodium, urine osmolality, and urine volume should be followed hourly.
Fluids are withheld until,Body weight decreases by 5% and plasma sodium and
osmolality reach the upper limits of normal (sodium >145 mEq/L and
osmolality >295 mOsm/kg)ORA stable hourly urinary osmolality (variation of
55

<5% over 3 hours) is established.
Interpretation of the test
In healthy individuals, water deprivation increases plasma osmolality, which
stimulates ADH secretion resulting in retention of water by the kidney (hence
increasing urine osmolality).
In complete DI, with absent ADH or ineffective ADH, the urine osmolality
remains less than plasma osmolality.
In partial DI and primary polydipsia, urine osmolality will be greater than
plasma osmolality, but the urine will remain sub-maximally concentrated.
If a diagnosis of primary polydipsia has been excluded, ADH can be given to
help differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI. DDAVP (desmopressin)
0.03 mcg/kg can be given subcutaneously and urine osmolality measured at 30,
60, and 120 minutes. If the urine osmolality increases >50% from the level
achieved during dehydration, the diagnosis of central DI is established.
Plasma vasopressin should be measured before and after water deprivation
unless the results are unequivocal. The levels should be analyzed as a function
of the concurrent plasma and urine osmolality.5 Patients with central DI and
primary polydipsia have basal levels of plasma ADH that are subnormal.
Patients with nephrogenic DI have normal to elevated basal levels. During
water deprivation, ADH levels rise in primary polydipsia and nephrogenic DI
but remain subnormal in central DI.
Pitfalls of water deprivation test
The diagnosis of partial DI may be difficult, since there may be enough ADH
secretion to partially concentrate the urine.
ADH secretion or action should be normal in patients with primary polydipsia,
but the associated chronic polyuria can lead to “washout” of the medullary
interstitium, resulting in loss of the transtubular osmolar gradient that is
required to maintain the maximum urinary concentrating ability of the kidneys,
hence making it difficult to differentiate from partial DI.
Hypertonic Saline Test
The hypertonic saline test may be used if the water restriction test is inconclusive
or cannot be performed. It may be useful to diagnose partial central DI, partial
nephrogenic DI, and primary polydipsia.3
Hypertonic (3%) saline is infused at 0.05 to 0.1 mL/kg/minute for 1 to 2 hours, and
plasma osmolality and sodium are measured every 30 minutes.
ADH is measured once the serum sodium and osmolality are above the upper
56

limits of normal (sodium >145 mEq/L and osmolality >295 mOsm/kg).
Normograms have been established to distinguish between primary polydipsia,
partial central DI, and partial nephrogenic DI. However, this test may be
contraindicated in patients at risk for complications of volume overload (e.g.,
those with underlying heart disease or congestive heart failure).

TREATMENT
Replacement of Water Deficit
Water deficit should be calculated and replaced orally with water whenever
possible. Hypotonic saline can be given intravenously in a patient who cannot
tolerate oral intake.
If hypernatremia has developed rapidly over a period of hours, the water deficit
can be corrected to decrease the plasma sodium at 1 mEq/L/hour. If hypernatremia
developed slowly, the rate should be no more than 0.5 mEq/L/hour, up to a
maximum of 8 to 10 mEq/L/day, using the smallest volume of fluid possible to
avoid cerebral edema.4
The water deficit can be calculated from the serum sodium using the following
formula:
Water deficit (L) = Total Body Water* × ([Na+]serum – 140) ÷ 140
For example, if a 70 kg man has serum sodium of 150 mEq/L, the calculated water
deficit is 3 L [{0.6 × 70 × (150 – 140)} ÷ 140]. To decrease the sodium at a rate of
0.5 mEq/L/hour, 3 L of D5W can be administered over 20 hours [(150–140 mEq/L)
÷ 0.5 mEq/L/hour] at a rate of 150 mL/hour (3 L ÷ 20 hours)
Alternatively, the change in serum sodium for each liter of fluid given can be
approximated from the following equation:
Change in serum Na+ = ([Na+]infusate – [Na+]serum) ÷ (Total Body Water* + 1)
For the same person, the calculated decrease in sodium per liter of D5W would
be (0 – 150) ÷ (0.6 × 70 + 1) = –3.5 mEq/L. To decrease the sodium at an initial
rate of 0.5 mEq/L/hour, D5W should be infused at approximately 143 mL/hour (0.5
mEq/L/hour ÷ 3.5 mEq/L × 1000 mL). This formula is particularly useful when
choosing a hypotonic fluid other than D5W.
*Total body water = Total body weight in kg × 0.6 in men/0.5 in women
It should be noted that both of these strategies offer only approximations of the
expected change in sodium and the rate of infusion needs to be adjusted to account
for other ongoing free water losses.
57

The fluid infusion rate may need to be decreased if DDAVP is used to treat DI, and
plasma sodium and volume status should be assessed frequently (every 2 to 4
hours).

Treating the Underlying Defect
Central DI
DDAVP (desmopressin) is an ADH-analog, which is a potent antidiuretic with no
vasopressor activity and a longer duration of action than ADH. It is the most
common agent used to treat central DI. It is available in parenteral, oral, and
intranasal preparations.
DDAVP given intravenously or subcutaneously has a rapid onset of action and is
usually given at a dose of 1 to 2 mcg once or twice daily.
Intranasal DDAVP also has a rapid onset of action and can be given at a dose of 1
to 4 sprays/day (1 spray = 10 mcg) in 1 to 3 divided doses/day.
Oral DDAVP has an onset of action of 30 to 60 minutes and can be given at a dose
of 0.1 to 0.4 mg one to four times a day with a maximum dose of 1.2 mg/day.
Use of oral DDAVP has been shown to be very effective, but may be limited in
some patients owing to variable gut absorption and reduced bioavailability.
Conversion from intranasal to parenteral preparation is easily accomplished by
reducing the dose by a factor of ten; conversion from intranasal to oral requires
that the dose be titrated due to the variable bioavailability with oral preparations.
Acute Postsurgical Central DI
Patients who are awake and alert and have an intact thirst mechanism should be
able to maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent hypernatremia. Although these
patients may not need drug therapy, they need to be closely monitored and drug
therapy should be considered in patients who develop bothersome nocturia.
If DDAVP is indicated, a simple and safe method of dosing a patient who has an
intact thirst mechanism and who is tolerating oral intake is to start with 0.05 to 0.1
mg of oral DDAVP and assess for response (decreased urine output, increased
urine osmolality, and decreased thirst). If the response is not appropriate within a
few hours, the dose should be increased by 0.1 mg every few hours until an
appropriate response (urine output <300 mL/hour) is achieved. The patient should
continue to receive DDAVP on an as needed (PRN) basis until a stable regimen is
found.
Throughout the dose titration, patients should be given free access to water and
told to drink only when thirsty to avoid water intoxication and hyponatremia.
58

If oral intake is inadequate, intravenous administration of hypotonic fluid (D5W,
45% NaCl or 0.2% NaCl) should be used. Normal saline should be avoided in
patients with DI unless needed for initial volume resuscitation/hypovolemia
(solute load to kidneys worsens renal water loss).
Chronic Central DI
Chronic DI in patients with an intact thirst mechanism should be treated with a
fixed dosing regimen of DDAVP. The lowest possible dose (based on patient’s
symptoms) should be used to minimize the risk of hyponatremia. Patients are
usually able to correct their free water losses by increasing their fluid intake
(directed by their thirst mechanism).
Bedtime dosing of DDAVP helps some patients to reduce disabling nocturia.
Management is extremely difficult in adipsic patients with DI. In general, they are
managed with a fixed dose of DDAVP and adequate hydration. They are
instructed to adjust their fluid intake based on indirect indicators of water balance
(e.g., daily weight measurements) or serum sodium when feasible.
Nephrogenic DI
In acquired nephrogenic DI, correction of associated electrolyte disorders or
discontinuation of offending drugs usually improves diabetes insipidus.
A low sodium diet and a thiazide diuretic (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once or
twice daily) can be used to control nephrogenic DI.
Thiazides cause an overall reduction in electrolyte-free water excretion by
stimulating proximal tubular sodium and water reabsorption, hence diminishing
sodium/water delivery to the ADH-sensitive sites in the collecting tubules.
Amiloride, which is a potassium sparing diuretic, may enhance the effect of
thiazide diuretics by increasing sodium excretion and the resulting antipolyuric
response to volume depletion. It can be used in lithium-induced DI because it acts
by blocking sodium channels in the collecting ducts through which lithium enters
and interferes with the tubular response to ADH.
NSAIDs can also be a useful adjunct to treatment because they may decrease
glomerular filtration as well as decrease the synthesis of prostaglandins that
normally antagonize the action of ADH.
DDAVP may be effective in patients with partial nephrogenic DI.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Diabetes Insipidus After Pituitary Surgery
59

Transient DI usually develops on postoperative days 1 to 3 and generally lasts 1 to
7 days.5
Although rare, DI after transsphenoidal surgery can be associated with a triphasic
pattern characterized by early DI, followed by normal urine output (or SIADH)
due to release of stored hormone (lasts 24 hours to several days), followed by
permanent DI (occurs once the hormone stores are depleted).4
Microadenoma (secondary to stalk manipulation and exploration), intraoperative
CSF leak, non-pituitary sellar lesions (i.e., craniopharyngiomas or rathke’s cleft
cysts), young age, male sex, suprasellar extension, and Cushing’s disease have
been shown to be predictors for DI after pituitary surgery.6
Postoperative pituitary patients require close monitoring of their fluid intake and
output, electrolytes, and urine specific gravity.
Treatment is the same as in acute postsurgical central DI (see Treatment section).

COMPLICATIONS
Overtreatment and undertreatment can result in hyponatremia and hypernatremia,
respectively. Therefore, frequent monitoring is recommended.
It is essential for a patient with DI to have access to water. A patient, who loses
access to water, as may occur during a medical emergency or surgery, is at high
risk for dehydration and hypernatremia. Under these circumstances, urine output
and serum sodium concentration should be followed closely and hypotonic fluid
and DDAVP (on a PRN basis) should be administered.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients with central DI treated with DDAVP on a fixed dosing schedule should be
monitored for the development of hyponatremia.
Weight monitoring at home can be used for estimation of water loss/retention in
adipsic patients.
Occasional withdrawal of DDAVP is reasonable to confirm recurrence of
polyuria.

PATIENT EDUCATION
All patients with DI should be educated to wear or carry a medical alert tag or
card.
All patients with DI (and their family members) should be educated about the signs
and symptoms of hyper/hyponatremia.

Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone
Scott Goodwin and Thomas J. Baranski
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definitions
The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a
disorder in which water excretion is impaired by the unregulated secretion of ADH
leading to free water retention and varying degrees of dilutional hyponatremia.1

Epidemiology
Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients,
with a prevalence estimated to be as high as 30% in some series.2

Etiology
The causes of SIADH are summarized in Table 5-1.
Prognosis is dependent on the underlying etiology as well as the severity of the
hyponatremia and associated symptoms. SIADH usually resolves with therapy for
the underlying etiology.

Pathophysiology
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is a key component of
the homeostatic mechanisms that regulate water balance.
In normal individuals, ADH is released from cells in the neurohypophysis in
response to increased serum osmolality or decreased intravascular volume. ADH
exerts its activity in the kidneys via the vasopressin V2 receptor to increase water
permeability at the distal tubule and collecting duct of the nephron, enhancing
water reabsorption at these sites.3
With excess ADH, dilutional hyponatremia develops because water cannot be
excreted normally. Therefore, the hallmark of SIADH is an inappropriately
elevated urine osmolality in the setting of a low plasma osmolality.3
62

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
As with other causes of hyponatremia, symptoms are dependent on the degree of
hyponatremia and the rapidity at which it develops.
It is rare to have symptoms with serum sodium levels of ≥125 mEq/L, but with
acute hyponatremia (<48 hours) patients may complain of malaise and nausea.4
At serum sodium levels of <125 mEq/L, patients may present with
neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms, ranging from muscular weakness, headache,
lethargy, ataxia, and psychosis to cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure
(ICP), seizures, and coma.4
Signs of either volume depletion or overload are not consistent with SIADH and
should prompt an evaluation for other causes of hyponatremia.5

ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE

Diagnostic Criteria
SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion, and therefore, other causes of hyponatremia
must be ruled out.
Essential diagnostic criteria include:1–3
Low plasma osmolality: a plasma osmolality <275 mOsm/kg is consistent with
SIADH, and will rule out hypertonic causes of hyponatremia.
Inappropriately elevated urine osmolality and urine sodium concentration: a
urine osmolality >100 mOsm/kg and urine sodium concentration >20 to 40
mEq/L are consistent with SIADH.
Euvolemia: volume depletion or overload should prompt an evaluation for an
alternative diagnosis.
Normal renal, adrenal, and thyroid function tests.
No recent use of diuretic agents.
Supplemental diagnostic criteria that are not needed to make a diagnosis of
SIADH, but could be useful in situations of uncertainty, include:
Abnormal water load test, which is defined as the inability to excrete at least
80% of a water load (20 mL/kg water ingested in 10 to 20 minutes) after 4
hours and/or the failure to dilute urinary osmolality to <100 mOsm/kg. This test
should be administered after the serum sodium level is >125 mEq/L through
water restriction and/or saline administration.
No significant correction of plasma sodium with volume expansion, but
improvement after fluid restriction.

Differential Diagnosis
SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion that should be differentiated from other known
causes of euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia. Euvolemic hypotonic
hyponatremia is characterized by low to normal total body sodium and normal to
elevated total body water.1
65

The most common cause of euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia is SIADH, but
other causes of euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia that must be excluded include:2
Hypothyroidism rarely causes hyponatremia, and the mechanisms by which this
occurs are not entirely understood. Proposed mechanisms include dysregulation
of ADH release or clearance, or both, as well as effects on vascular tone,
cardiac output, and renal blood flow.
Adrenal insufficiency is also an unusual cause of hyponatremia. ADH is an
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretagogue and is subject to negative
feedback by glucocorticoids. Hyponatremia from adrenal insufficiency is
thought to be caused by the loss of negative feedback on ADH secretion.
Primary polydypsia may lead to hyponatremia if free water intake exceeds the
capacity of the kidneys to excrete free water.
Potomania was classically described in binge beer drinkers, but is now found
more commonly in people with unusual dietary habits or eating disorders (e.g.,
anorexia nervosa). These patients develop hypotonic hyponatremia in the
setting of dilute urine because of low solute intake and excretion. Free water
clearance is dependent on solute excretion by the kidneys. If solute intake is
decreased because of a restricted diet, solute excretion will also be decreased,
and the kidneys will not be able to clear as much free water.
Thiazide diuretics typically cause hypotonic hyponatremia associated with
hypovolemia, but patients can be euvolemic if free water intake is increased to
compensate for thirst and volume depletion.
Reset osmostat syndrome is a variant of SIADH in which there is a shift in the
set-point for ADH release to a lower plasma osmolality. Therefore, the patient
may have inappropriately concentrated urine in the setting of hypotonic
hyponatremia, but will be able to dilute urine normally in response to a water
load and concentrate urine in response to dehydration.
Nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis is a rare genetic
syndrome in which all of the criteria for SIADH are met, but in which ADH
levels are undetectable. It results from gain-of-function mutations in the renal
vasopressin V2 receptor causing increased water resorption.6

TREATMENT
SIADH is usually self-limited, and the primary management strategy is to correct
the underlying etiology. However, immediate treatment strategies are based on the
severity of the hyponatremia and any associated symptoms.
Rate of correction:
66

Overly aggressive correction of hyponatremia may result in the development of
central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), a potentially devastating neurologic
condition; therefore, correction of hyponatremia should always be done with
caution. If the rate of development of hyponatremia is rapid (<48 hours), an
equally rapid rate of correction is felt to be safe. However, resolving the
symptoms should be the primary goal, whereas correction to normonatremia
should be performed more judiciously.7 In cases where the acuity or chronicity
of the hyponatremia is not known, the rate of correction should be limited to 1
to 2 mEq/L/hour for the first 3 to 4 hours, and by no more than 0.5 mEq/L/hour
thereafter, for a maximum correction of 10 mEq/L per 24 hours.7
With any chosen therapeutic strategy, plasma sodium, and volume status should be
assessed frequently (initially every 2 hours, and reduced to every 4 hours when
the correction rate is stable) to monitor and make adjustments to therapy.

Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Fluid restriction is the mainstay of therapy for most patients with SIADH so that
free water excretion in the urine exceeds dietary intake. In asymptomatic
hyponatremia due to SIADH, an appropriate prescription for fluid restriction can
be estimated by measuring plasma sodium and a spot urine sample for sodium.
These values can then be used to determine the urine-to-plasma (U/P) electrolyte
ratio:
U/P ratio = ([Na+]urine + [K+]urine) ÷ [Na+]plasma
where [Na+]urine = mEq/L of sodium in the urine, [K+]urine = mEq/L of potassium in
the urine, and [Na+]plasma = mEq/L of sodium in the plasma.
If the U/P ratio is ≥1, free water should be maximally restricted. If the ratio is 0.5
to 1, free water should be restricted to ≤500 mL/day, and if the ratio is ≤0.5, free
water should be restricted to ≤1000 mL/day.8

Medications
First Line
Intravenous saline can improve SIADH-induced hyponatremia if the osmolality of
the intravenous fluid is greater than the osmolality of the urine. This usually
requires the use of hypertonic saline. Hypertonic saline should be reserved
ONLY for treatment of acute or symptomatic hyponatremia. 8 Many strategies
have been employed to calculate the initial rate of hypertonic saline. One simple
67

formula to estimate the increase in plasma sodium for one liter of fluid:
Change in [Na+]plasma = ([Na+]infusate – [Na+]plasma) ÷ (total body water + 1)
where [Na+]infusate = mEq/L of sodium in the infusate (e.g., 3% saline is 513
mEq/L), and total body water = body weight (kg) × (0.6 for men or 0.5 for
women). For example, if a 70 kg man is having seizures and has a plasma sodium
of 110 mEq/L, the calculated increase in sodium per liter of 3% saline would be
(513 – 110) ÷ (0.6 × 71) = 9.4 mEq/L. To increase the sodium at an initial rate of
2 mEq/L/hour, 3% NaCl should be infused at 213 mL/hour (2 mEq/L/hour ÷ 9.4
mEq/L × 1000 mL). If one can estimate the expected change of sodium in 1 L of
intravenous fluid, a rate can be calculated for that infusion to avert overcorrecting too quickly.
Oral salt tablets increase serum sodium by the same mechanism as hypertonc
saline. Salt tablets are usually reserved for treatment of chronic or asymptomatic
hyponatremia.7
Second Line
Loop diuretics can enhance the effect of solute loading with oral salt or
intravenous saline by increasing free water excretion and impairing the renal
responsiveness to ADH.7
Demeclocycline acts on the renal collecting tubules to diminish responsiveness to
ADH, resulting in increased free water excretion. The typical dose of 300 to 600
mg twice daily is typically reserved for chronic or asymptomatic SIADH-induced
hyponatremia.7 The major side effect is nephrotoxicity, so renal function should
be monitored closely.
Vasopressin receptor antagonists exert their activity on renal V2 receptors
resulting in a selective water diuresis without affecting sodium excretion.7,9
Examples include intravenous conivaptan and oral tolvaptan. Multiple studies
have shown these agents to effectively increase serum sodium level when
compared to placebo. However, trials comparing vasopressin receptor
antagonists versus traditional therapies (water restriction or salt administration)
have not been performed.10,11 Intravenous conivaptan can exert its effect in as
little as 1 to 2 hours, permitting a more rapid initial elevation on serum sodium.10
While this may be an initial benefit in patients who are symptomatic, careful
monitoring must be maintained to avoid overly rapid correction of hyponatremia.
Thirst increases significantly with these agents and water restriction is needed to
ensure the rise of serum sodium.11 The financial expense also limits the use of
these agents. Therefore, the vasopressin receptor antagonists are typically used in
conjunction with traditional therapies in the rare patients who have severe
68

hyponatremia (serum sodium <115 to 120) and neurologic symptoms.9

Evaluation of Thyroid Function
William E. Clutter
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The major hormone secreted by the thyroid is thyroxine (T4), which is converted
by deiodinases in many tissues to the more potent triiodothyronine (T3). Both are
reversibly bound to plasma proteins, primarily thyroxine-binding globulin
(TBG), and also thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA) and albumin. Only the
free (unbound) fraction enters cells and produces biologic effects.
T4 secretion is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). In turn,
pituitary TSH secretion is inhibited by thyroid hormones, forming a sensitive
negative-feedback loop that keeps free T4 levels within a narrow normal range.
TSH secretion is stimulated by hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone
(TRH).
Diagnosis of thyroid disease is based on clinical findings, palpation of the thyroid,
and measurement of plasma TSH and thyroid hormones.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Thyroid palpation determines the size and consistency of the thyroid, and the
presence of nodules, tenderness, or a thrill. Auscultation may detect a bruit over
the gland in severe hyperthyroidism.
Examination of the eyes includes assessment for lid lag and proptosis in
suspected hyperthyroidism and periorbital edema in suspected hypothyroidism.
Skin examination may reveal warm, moist skin in hyperthyroidism and dry, cool
skin or myxedema in hypothyroidism. Neurologic signs include brisk tendon
reflex relaxation and fine tremor in hyperthyroidism and delayed reflex relaxation
in hypothyroidism.

Diagnostic Testing
70

Laboratories1
Thyroid-stimulating hormone
Plasma TSH is the initial test of choice in most patients with suspected
thyroid disease, except when thyroid function is not in a steady state or TSH
secretion by the pituitary may be abnormal (Table 6-1).
TSH levels are elevated in even very mild primary hypothyroidism and are
suppressed to <0.1 μU/mL in even very mild hyperthyroidism. Therefore, a
normal plasma TSH level excludes hyperthyroidism and primary
hypothyroidism. Because even slight changes in thyroid hormone levels affect
TSH secretion, abnormal TSH levels are not specific for clinically important
thyroid disease. Changes in plasma TSH lag behind changes in plasma T4, and
TSH levels may be misleading when plasma T4 levels are changing rapidly, as
during treatment of hyperthyroidism, or in the first few weeks after changes in
the dose of thyroxine.
TABLE 6-1 PLASMA TSH MEASUREMENT

Plasma TSH is mildly elevated (<20 μU/mL) in some euthyroid patients
recovering from nonthyroidal illnesses and in mild (or subclinical)
hypothyroidism.
TSH levels may be suppressed to <0.1 μU/mL in severe nonthyroidal illness,
in mild (or subclinical) hyperthyroidism, and during treatment with dopamine
or high doses of glucocorticoids (Table 6-2). Also, TSH levels remain <0.1
μU/mL for some time after hyperthyroidism is corrected. TSH levels
decrease in the first trimester of pregnancy (owing to thyroid stimulation by
chorionic gonadotropin) and may fall to <0.1 μU/mL.
TSH levels are usually within the reference range in secondary
hypothyroidism due to pituitary or hypothalamic disease, and are not useful
for detection of this rare form of hypothyroidism.
71

Plasma free T4
Measurement of plasma free T4 confirms the diagnosis and assesses the severity
of hyperthyroidism when plasma TSH is <0.1 μU/mL (Table 6-3). It is also used
to diagnose secondary hypothyroidism and adjust thyroxine therapy in patients
with pituitary disease. Most laboratories measure free T4 by one of several types
of immunoassay.
Plasma free T4measured by equilibrium dialysis
Plasma free T4 by equilibrium dialysis (ED) is the most reliable measure of
clinical thyroid status, but results are seldom rapidly available. ED is needed only
in rare cases in which the diagnosis is not clear from measurement of plasma TSH
and free T4 by immunoassay.
Plasma total T4
Plasma total T4 assays measure both bound and free hormone. Because altered
levels of TBG cause abnormal total T4 levels in euthyroid patients, total T4 is less
reliable than free T4 and should not be used, except when free T4 may be
artifactually elevated by heparin treatment (see Effect of Drugs on Thyroid
Function Tests in this chapter). Some common causes of increased TBG are
estrogen treatment, including oral contraceptives, and pregnancy. Low TBG levels
are common in cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and many severe illnesses.
TABLE 6-2 CAUSES OF A SUPPRESSED PLASMA TSH

TABLE 6-3 APPROPRIATE USES OF PLASMA FREE T4

Plasma total T3
Although T3 is the biologically active hormone, much of it is derived from
72

deiodination of T4 within target cells, making T4 the major circulating thyroid
hormone. Plasma T3 level is affected by alterations in plasma TBG just as is
plasma T4. This test has very limited use in the evaluation of suspected thyroid
disease,
and should only be measured in patients with suspected
hyperthyroidism with suppressed plasma TSH but normal plasma free T4.
Some of these patients have clinical hyperthyroidism with elevation of plasma T3
alone (T3toxicosis). Plasma T3 assays are not useful in the diagnosis of
hypothyroidism. Many laboratories offer assays of plasma free T3, but their
reliability is unknown.
Plasma thyroglobulin
Thyroglobulin (Tg), the precursor of thyroid hormones, is a glycoprotein
synthesized only by thyroid follicular cells. Most thyroglobulin is broken down
within the thyroid to release T4 and T3, but a small amount enters the circulation
intact. Plasma thyroglobulin levels are increased in all thyroid diseases and are
undetectable when all thyroid tissue has been removed. The only use of plasma
thyroglobulin assays is monitoring of patients with papillary or follicular
thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy to detect persistent or recurrent
disease.
An assay for antithyroglobulin antibodies should always be done in
conjunction with the thyroglobulin assay, since the presence of such antibodies
renders the thyroglobulin assay useless.
Antithyroid antibodies
Patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, painless
thyroiditis, and Graves’ disease) often have autoantibodies against thyroid
peroxidase, thyroglobulin, or both. Measurement of these antibodies has a very
limited role in thyroid diagnosis. They can be used to confirm that primary
hypothyroidism or a euthyroid goiter is due to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, but this
diagnosis can usually be made on clinical grounds.
Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins
Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs) are autoantibodies to the TSH
receptor that mimic the stimulatory effect of TSH on thyroid growth and hormone
production, and cause hyperthyroidism in Graves’ disease. Measurement of these
antibodies is seldom needed to make this diagnosis, which is usually obvious on
clinical grounds. Its primary use is in pregnant women with a history of
Graves’ disease treated by radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy. These
patients may still have high levels of TSI, which can no longer produce
73

hyperthyroidism in the mother, but can cross the placenta and cause neonatal
hyperthyroidism. Assay of TSI in the third trimester has some value in predicting
this rare complication.
Plasma calcitonin
Calcitonin is the secretory product of thyroid parafollicular or C cells. Although it
has no apparent physiologic role, it is a useful tumor marker for medullary
carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT), which is derived from parafollicular cells.
Mild elevations of plasma calcitonin are not specific for MCT.
Radioactive iodine uptake
Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) is the percentage of a small oral dose of
iodine-131 (131I) retained by the thyroid after 24 hours. It occasionally helps in
differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism (see Chapter 8), and is also used to
calculate the dose for RAI therapy. Large doses of exogenous iodine in the form of
x-ray contrast media or iodine-containing drugs suppress RAIU temporarily. The
normal range of RAIU for dietary iodine intake in the United States is 10% to
30%. Note that RAIU is a number, not an image.
Imaging
Although thyroid imaging tests are widely used, they have very limited value in the
assessment of patients with suspected thyroid disease, since clinically important
abnormalities of thyroid anatomy are readily assessed by palpation.
Radioisotope thyroid scan
Radioisotope thyroid scans use technetium-99m pertechnetate, which is taken up
by the sodium-iodine symporter of thyroid cells. These scans can determine the
functional activity of thyroid nodules: hypofunctioning (“cold”), isofunctioning
(“warm”), or hyperfunctioning (“hot”).
Almost all thyroid carcinomas are hypofunctioning, but unfortunately for the
usefulness of this test, so are most benign nodules, resulting in a very low
positive predictive value (PPV). This test has been supplanted in the evaluation
of thyroid nodules by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).
The only indication for radioisotope thyroid scanning is the presence of a single
palpable thyroid nodule in a patient with hyperthyroidism. If the nodule is
hyperfunctioning and causing hyperthyroidism, it is assuredly benign and does
not require biopsy. On the other hand, a hypofunctioning nodule in a gland
affected by Graves’ disease should be evaluated by FNAC.
Ultrasonography
High-resolution ultrasonography (US) of the thyroid has become widely used,
74

despite a lack of evidence that its use improves the clinical outcome in patients
with thyroid disease. Its primary role is in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. It
differentiates solid from cystic nodules and may be used to guide fine-needle
biopsy, particularly of nonpalpable nodules.
The critical limitation of US is the high prevalence of incidental thyroid
nodules, which are found in 20% to 60% of the population. Most of these
nodules are of no clinical importance, and their detection leads only to
unnecessary anxiety, further testing, and even unnecessary surgery. US has no
role in the evaluation of diffuse goiters, or of patients with hypo- or
hyperthyroidism.
Diagnostic Procedures
Fine-needle aspiration cytology
FNAC is the method of choice for evaluating thyroid nodules for the presence of
malignancy. It is a safe and simple bedside procedure, and provides a definitive
diagnosis in the great majority of patients. If the specimen obtained is inadequate for
diagnosis, the procedure should be repeated. Complications are rare and consist
mostly of transient painful swelling of the nodule due to bleeding within it.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Effect of nonthyroidal illness on thyroid function tests
Many illnesses alter thyroid tests without causing true thyroid dysfunction (the
nonthyroidal illness or euthyroid sick syndrome).2 These changes must be
recognized to avoid mistaken diagnosis and therapy.
The low T3syndrome occurs in many illnesses, during starvation, and after
trauma or surgery. Conversion of T4 to T3 by type 1 deiodinase is decreased,
and plasma T3 levels are low. Plasma free T4 and TSH levels are normal. This
may be an adaptive response to illness, and thyroid hormone therapy is not
beneficial.
The low T4syndrome occurs in severe illness. Plasma total T4 levels fall due to
decreased levels of TBG and perhaps due to inhibition of T4 binding to TBG.
Plasma free T4measured by equilibrium dialysis usually remains normal.
However, when measured by commonly available immunoassays, free T4 may
be low. TSH levels decrease early in severe illness, sometimes to <0.1
μU/mL. During recovery they rise, sometimes to levels higher than the
normal range (although rarely >20 μU/mL).
75

Effect of drugs on thyroid function tests
A number of drugs affect thyroid function tests (Table 6-4). Iodine-containing
drugs (amiodarone
and radiographic contrast media) may cause
hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism in susceptible patients. Other drugs alter
thyroid function tests, especially plasma total T4, without causing true thyroid
dysfunction. In general, plasma TSH levels are reliable in determining whether
true hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism is present.
TABLE 6-4 EFFECTS OF DRUGS ON THYROID FUNCTION TESTS

Evaluation of thyroid function in pregnancy
Thyroid hormone is critical for fetal brain development, and several changes
occur in maternal thyroid function during pregnancy. 3 TBG and total T4levels
rise early in pregnancy. Chorionic gonadotropin is homologous to TSH, and very
high levels in the first trimester stimulate the TSH receptor, causing a transient
fall in TSH levels by stimulating T4 secretion. The mother usually remains
euthyroid, but rarely she develops a transient clinical hyperthyroidism, often
associated with hyperemesis gravidarum.
76

The placenta contains high levels of type 3 deiodinase (D3), which
inactivates T4 and severely limits T4 transfer from mother to fetus.
Nevertheless, some T4 crosses the placenta and is important for early fetal
brain development. In mothers with preexisting hypothyroidism, increased
T4metabolism by placental D3 means that their levothyroxine dose must
usually be increased to maintain euthyroidism. Urinary iodine excretion
increases, and in areas of iodine deficiency, it becomes more difficult for the
thyroid to maintain adequate hormone secretion, with development of a
transient goiter. If the iodine deficiency is too severe, the fetus receives
inadequate thyroid hormone, and endemic cretinism results.
Thyroid disorders and pregnancy often coincide (because of the frequency of
thyroid disease in young women). Important interactions between the two
include (a) the normal decrease in TSH in the first trimester, which may be
mistaken for hyperthyroidism; (b) in hypothyroid women, the frequent need to
increase levothyroxine dose in pregnancy; (c) the complexity of treating
hyperthyroidism in pregnant women without adversely affecting the fetus; and
(d) the occasional occurrence of a transient hyperthyroidism caused by painless
thyroiditis in the months after delivery.

Euthyroid Goiter and Thyroid Nodules
William E. Clutter
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Euthyroid goiter is defined as thyroid enlargement with normal thyroid function.
There are three forms: diffuse goiter, multinodular goiter (MNG), and a
solitary thyroid nodule.
The diagnosis of euthyroid goiter is based on palpation of the thyroid and
evaluation of thyroid function. If the thyroid is enlarged, the examiner should
determine whether the enlargement is diffuse or multinodular, or whether a single
nodule is palpable.

Epidemiology
All three forms of euthyroid goiter are common, especially in women. Imaging
studies, such as thyroid scans or ultrasonography, provide no useful additional
information about goiters that are diffuse or multinodular by palpation and should not
be performed in these patients. Furthermore, 20% to 60% of people have
nonpalpable thyroid nodules that are detectable by ultrasound. These nodules
rarely have any clinical importance, but their incidental discovery may lead to
unnecessary diagnostic testing and treatment.

EUTHYROID DIFFUSE GOITER
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Almost all euthyroid diffuse goiters in iodine-sufficient regions such as the United
States are caused by chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).
Iodine deficiency also causes diffuse colloid goiter in much of the world. Because
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis may also cause hypothyroidism, plasma thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) should be measured even in patients who are clinically euthyroid.
78

The presence of antithyroid antibodies confirms the diagnosis of Hashimoto’s
disease, but this test is seldom needed. Thyroid imaging should not be performed.

DIAGNOSIS
Diffuse goiter is diagnosed by thyroid palpation. Imaging is not needed and often
detects incidental, clinically unimportant nodules.
Small diffuse goiters usually are asymptomatic, and therapy is seldom required.
Larger goiters may cause compressive symptoms such as dysphagia, dyspnea, or
neck fullness.

TREATMENT
Patients should be followed annually with thyroid palpation and measurement of
plasma TSH to monitor for the development of hypothyroidism. Most diffuse goiters
do not progressively enlarge, but in a few, thyroidectomy may be needed to relieve
compressive symptoms or for cosmetic reasons.

MULTINODULAR GOITER
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
MNG is caused by nodular hyperplasia of thyroid follicles. It occurs most commonly
in iodine-deficient regions, but is also very common in iodine-sufficient areas such
as the United States, primarily in older patients and in women.

DIAGNOSIS
MNG is diagnosed by thyroid palpation. Most patients are asymptomatic and
require no treatment. In a few patients, hyperthyroidism (toxic MNG) develops
(see Chapter 8). In some patients, the goiter causes compressive symptoms, and
treatment is required.
The risk of malignancy in MNG is comparable to the frequency of incidental
thyroid carcinoma in clinically normal glands. Evaluation for thyroid carcinoma
with fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is warranted if there is a dominant
nodule (a nodule that is disproportionately larger than the other nodules).
Some centers have adopted a policy of performing thyroid ultrasonography (US) in
all patients with MNG, and evaluating all nodules larger than 1 cm by FNAC.
This policy dramatically increases the number of thyroid biopsies and the cost of
managing this common condition. There is no evidence that routine thyroid US
79

improves clinical outcomes in patients with MNG, and it is not
recommended.1

TREATMENT
Subtotal thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with compressive
symptoms. If the patient is a poor candidate for surgery or refuses surgery, a high
dose (about 50 mCi) of radioactive iodine (RAI) will reduce gland size and
improve symptoms in most patients.2
Thyroxine treatment has little if any effect on the size of MNGs and should not be
used.

SINGLE THYROID NODULES
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Single thyroid nodules are palpable in about 5% of women and 1% of men. They are
usually due to benign nodular hyperplasia or thyroid adenomas, but about 5% are
thyroid carcinomas, and the main diagnostic task is diagnosing or excluding
carcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most thyroid nodules present as a painless lump in the neck discovered by the
patient or physician.
Clinical findings that increase the likelihood of carcinoma include age <20
years, the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy, a history of radiation to the head
or neck in childhood, and a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or
multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes type 2A or 2B. A hard, fixed
nodule; recent nodule growth; or hoarseness due to invasion of the recurrent
laryngeal nerve also suggests malignancy. However, most patients with thyroid
carcinomas have none of these risk factors, and their lesions cannot be
distinguished clinically from benign nodules. Thus, nearly all palpable single
thyroid nodules should be evaluated with FNAC.
A few solitary thyroid nodules are adenomas producing hyperthyroidism (see
Chapter 8). Some thyroid nodules present with the sudden onset of pain and
tenderness, indicating hemorrhage into a preexisting, usually benign, nodule.
80

Solitary nodules rarely cause compressive symptoms.

Diagnostic Testing
Plasma TSH should be measured, since a nodule in a hyperthyroid patient is more
likely to be benign. If plasma TSH is suppressed, a radioisotope thyroid scan
should be performed. If the nodule is hyperfunctioning and causing
hyperthyroidism, it is assuredly benign and does not require biopsy. On the other
hand, a hypofunctioning nodule in a gland affected by Graves’ disease should be
evaluated by FNAC. This is the only indication for radioisotope scanning in
patients with a thyroid nodule.
Plasma calcitonin should be measured if there is a family history of medullary
carcinoma or MEN 2A or 2B.
The key diagnostic evaluation is FNAC, the results of which are classified into
five major diagnostic categories3 (Table 7-1):
Nodules with benign cytology should be reevaluated periodically by palpation,
since there is a low risk of false-negative cytology. Repeat biopsy should be
considered if the nodule enlarges. Levothyroxine therapy has little or no effect
on the size of single thyroid nodules, and is not indicated.
If the specimen is nondiagnostic or unsatisfactory, the biopsy should be
repeated.
Nodules with malignant cytology or cytology suspicious for malignancy should
be treated by total thyroidectomy followed by treatment described in the
Thyroid Carcinoma section in this chapter.
TABLE 7-1 DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES OF FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION
CYTOLOGY

About 5% to 15% of nodules with atypical cytology are malignant. These
lesions are usually evaluated by repeat biospy. If the repeat biopsy does not
provide a definitive diagnosis, a lobectomy is often performed, with
completion thyroidectomy if carcinoma is confirmed.
Nodules that are follicular neoplasms are malignant 15% to 30% of the time.
81

These patients should be treated with a lobectomy, with completion
thyroidcdectomy if carcinoma is confirmed.
Some centers have adopted a policy of performing thyroid US in all patients with a
single palpable nodule, and performing FNAC on all nodules larger than 1 cm.
Some ultrasonographic features of thyroid nodules are suggestive of malignancy,
but they are neither sensitive nor specific enough to establish or exclude the
diagnosis. There is no evidence that routine thyroid US improves clinical
outcomes in these patients, and it is not recommended.

THYROID CARCINOMA
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Most thyroid malignancies are differentiated carcinomas arising from follicular cells
(papillary or follicular carcinomas) (Table 7-2).4 These cancers retain many
properties of normal thyroid cells: they take up iodine and synthesize
thyroglobulin, although less efficiently than normal thyroid tissue. Their growth
and function is stimulated by TSH. These three properties are used in treatment
and follow-up of thyroid carcinoma.

Classification
The most common type of thyroid cancer is papillary carcinoma, which is a
slow growing tumor that may remain localized for years. It characteristically
metastasizes first to cervical lymph nodes. Microscopic foci of papillary
carcinoma are common at autopsy. Thus, a small papillary carcinoma found
incidentally in a thyroid removed for other reasons, is usually not clinically
important.
Follicular carcinoma is more aggressive, and may metastasize early to lung and
bone. Many thyroid cancers have mixed papillary and follicular morphology;
these behave like papillary carcinoma.
Anaplastic carcinoma is a rare, rapidly progressive thyroid cancer with a very
poor prognosis.
TABLE 7-2 MAJOR TYPES OF THYROID CANCER

82

Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT) arises from C cells (parafollicular
cells). Plasma calcitonin is elevated and useful for diagnosis. Most cases of
medullary carcinoma are sporadic. However, MCT is a component of MEN 2A
and 2B, as well as familial MCT syndrome, which are all caused by mutations of
different regions of the RET proto-oncogene.

DIAGNOSIS
Thyroid cancer usually presents as an asymptomatic single nodule. It is not painful
or tender, and does not cause hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Clinical findings
that increase the probability of carcinoma in a nodule are listed in this chapter in the
section Single Thyroid Nodules. The diagnostic procedure of choice is FNAC.

TREATMENT
Treatment of Papillary and Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma
The initial treatment of papillary and follicular carcinoma is total thyroidectomy.
In all patients with follicular carcinoma, and in patients with papillary carcinoma
who have characteristics that place them at increased risk of tumor recurrence
(Table 7-3) , thyroid remnant ablation is performed. RAI is taken up by tumor
cells only if TSH levels are elevated, so levothyroxine therapy is withheld until
plasma TSH is >30 μU/mL (usually about 2 weeks); then 30 to 100 mCi of RAI is
given. A whole body RAI (WBI) scan is usually performed several days after the
ablation dose. The purpose of remnant ablation is to destroy remaining normal and
malignant thyroid tissue, to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence, and facilitate
monitoring patients for recurrence.
To inhibit growth of residual tumor cells, patients are then treated with
levothyroxine at a dose that suppresses plasma TSH to below the normal
range. In patients with risk factors for recurrence or with known metastatic
disease, plasma TSH should be maintained at about 0.1 μU/mL. In low-risk
patients, plasma TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 μU/mL.
83

WBI scans are then done at 6 to 12 month intervals. Usually the required elevation
of plasma TSH is achieved by stopping levothyroxine therapy for about 2 weeks,
although recombinant human TSH can be injected instead. If RAI uptake by
functioning thyroid tissue is detected, patients are treated with RAI (usually
100 to 200 mCi). One or more RAI treatments usually eradicate remaining tumor.
WBI scanning can be discontinued after two consecutive negative scans.
TABLE 7-3 FACTORS THAT INCREASE RISK OF RECURRENCE OR
MORTALITY IN PAPILLARY THYROID CANCER

Patients require lifelong monitoring, since papillary thyroid cancer may recur
after a long interval. Plasma thyroglobulin is measured at the time of WBI
scanning (when TSH levels are elevated and secretion by remaining tumor is
stimulated), and then at 6 to 12 month intervals while the patient is taking
suppressive levothyroxine therapy. A rising thyroglobulin level indicates tumor
recurrence and the need for further RAI therapy.
Most differentiated thyroid carcinomas can be cured, even if metastatic at the
time of diagnosis. Only about 5% of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma
die of the disease. Rarely, patients develop progressive disease that does not take
up RAI. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been used experimentally with some
partial responses.

Treatment of Medullary Carcinoma5
The primary therapy for medullary carcinoma is total thyroidectomy. Early detection
by genetic testing for the RET mutation is critical in kindreds with familial MCT,
MEN 2A, or MEN 2B. Plasma calcitonin is used to monitor patients for recurrence.
Levothyroxine replacement should be adjusted to keep plasma TSH level within the
normal range. RAI therapy is not useful.

INCIDENTALLY DETECTED THYROID NODULES
Given their high prevalence, thyroid nodules are often found incidentally by
imaging tests done for unrelated reasons. There is general agreement that nodules
<1 cm in diameter do not require FNAC; a reasonable policy is to monitor such
84

patients by annual thyroid palpation and to perform FNAC if a nodule becomes
palpable.
The management of incidental, nonpalpable thyroid nodules >1 cm in diameter is
controversial. Some advocate the use of FNAC in all such nodules, but there is no
evidence that this policy improves clinical outcomes. Given the excellent
prognosis of thyroid carcinoma diagnosed when it becomes palpable, there is
little reason to believe that earlier diagnosis will improve survival.6

Hyperthyroidism
William E. Clutter
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hyperthyroidism is the syndrome caused by thyroid hormone excess. Thyrotoxicosis
is a synonym. It affects about 2% of women and 0.2% of men.

Etiology
Graves’ disease 1 is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, especially in
young patients. This autoimmune disorder may also cause proptosis
(exophthalmos) or pretibial myxedema, neither of which is found in other causes
of hyperthyroidism (Table 8-1).
Toxic multinodular goiter (MNG) is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in older
patients.
Unusual causes of hyperthyroidism include iodine-induced hyperthyroidism
(usually precipitated by drugs such as amiodarone or radiographic contrast
media), thyroid adenomas, subacute thyroiditis (a painful tender goiter with
transient hyperthyroidism), painless thyroiditis (a nontender goiter with transient
hyperthyroidism, most often seen in the postpartum period), and factitious
hyperthyroidism (surreptitious ingestion of thyroid hormone). The other causes of
hyperthyroidism are extremely rare.

Pathophysiology
Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disorder in which autoantibodies (thyroidstimulating immunoglobulins, TSIs) bind to the thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH) receptor and mimic the effects of TSH. Graves’ disease is much more
common in women. It occurs at any age, but is most common in young adults. A
family history of Graves’ disease or Hashimoto’s disease is common. Patients
have a diffuse goiter, which is soft and nontender. Increased blood flow
sometimes causes a thyroid bruit or thrill. There is diffuse hyperplasia of
follicular cells with a lymphocytic infiltrate. The natural history of Graves’
86

disease may be marked by exacerbations and remissions of hyperthyroidism.
Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s disease are clearly related. Both are
autoimmune in origin and cluster in the same families, and antithyroid antibodies
are present in both. Sometimes, one evolves into the other (e.g., patients with
Graves’ disease may later become hypothyroid even if treated only with
antithyroid drugs). Graves’ disease includes two extrathyroidal signs caused by
the underlying autoimmune disease, not by thyroid hormone excess. They are not
seen with other causes of hyperthyroidism.
Graves’ ophthalmopathy, characterized by inflammation and edema of
retroorbital tissues (extraocular muscles and fat), causes forward protrusion of
the globe (proptosis or exophthalmos).
TABLE 8-1 CAUSES OF HYPERTHYROIDISM

Pretibial myxedema, a rare plaque-like thickening of the skin over the shins, is
due to accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the dermis.
In toxic multinodular goiter (MNG), areas of autonomous function (i.e., not
regulated by TSH) develop within a MNG and produce excess thyroid hormone.
Patients are usually elderly and have a longstanding MNG.
Thyroid adenomas occasionally cause hyperthyroidism. Thyroid carcinomas
produce hormone very inefficiently and almost never cause hyperthyroidism, so a
thyroid nodule in a hyperthyroid patient is usually benign.
Certain forms of thyroiditis disrupt follicles, release stored hormone, and cause
transient hyperthyroidism (lasting from a few weeks to a few months), often
followed by a similar period of hypothyroidism.
Subacute thyroiditis is a granulomatous inflammation that causes a painful,
tender goiter.
87

Painless thyroiditis is a form of lymphocytic thyroiditis that may cause
hyperthyroidism, especially in the postpartum period (i.e., the first few months
after delivery). Patients often have a small diffuse nontender goiter, and may be
suspected of having Graves’ disease. Although some authors refer to
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis as a rare cause of hyperthyroidism, these patients likely
have coexisting Graves’ disease.
Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon; German for iodine
plus German eponym for Graves’ disease) usually occurs in patients with
euthyroid goiters after large doses of iodine (e.g., x-ray contrast medium or
amiodarone). Presumably, areas of autonomous function in these glands produce
excess thyroid hormone only when high iodine levels permit. After iodine
exposure ends, hyperthyroidism gradually resolves. Amiodarone also produces
direct toxic effects on the thyroid which may contribute to hyperthyroidism.
Factitious use of thyroid hormone is usually for the purpose of weight loss.
Recently, hyperthyroidism due to thyroid hormone-containing “nutritional
supplements” has been reported.
Very high levels of chorionic gonadotropin (which weakly cross-reacts with the
TSH receptor) secreted by trophoblastic tumors can cause hyperthyroidism.
TABLE 8-2 MANIFESTATIONS OF HYPERTHYROIDISM

DIAGNOSIS
88

Clinical Presentation
Symptoms include heat intolerance and weight loss (due to increased metabolic
rate), weakness, palpitations, oligomenorrhea, and anxiety (Table 8-2) . Signs
include brisk tendon reflexes, fine tremor, proximal weakness, stare, and eyelid
lag. Cardiac abnormalities may be prominent, including sinus tachycardia, atrial
fibrillation, and exacerbation of coronary artery disease or heart failure. In the
elderly, hyperthyroidism may present with only atrial fibrillation, heart failure,
weakness, or weight loss, and a high index of suspicion is needed to make the
diagnosis.
Graves’ disease may cause additional findings that are not due to hyperthyroidism
(Table 8-3). Symptoms of ophthalmopathy include increased lacrimation, foreign
body sensation, conjunctival redness, and periorbital edema. Fibrosis of
extraocular muscles can cause diplopia. Rarely proptosis threatens vision by
corneal exposure (due to incomplete lid closure) or compression of the optic
nerve.
TABLE 8-3 MANIFESTATIONS OF GRAVES’ DISEASE

Diagnostic Testing
Hyperthyroidism should be suspected in any patient with compatible symptoms, as it
is a readily treatable disorder that may become very debilitating.
Plasma TSH is the best initial diagnostic test, as a TSH level >0.1 μU/mL
excludes clinical hyperthyroidism. If plasma TSH is <0.1 μU/mL, plasma free
thyroxine (T4) should be measured to determine the severity of hyperthyroidism and
as a baseline for therapy. If plasma free T 4 is elevated, the diagnosis of clinical
hyperthyroidism is established.
If plasma TSH is <0.1 μU/mL but free T4 is normal, the patient may have
clinical hyperthyroidism due to elevation of plasma triiodothyronine (T3)
alone (T3toxicosis); plasma T3 should be measured in this case.
89

TSH may also be suppressed by severe nonthyroidal illness (see Chapter 6).
These patients have normal or low plasma free T4 and low plasma T3.
Finally, mild (or subclinical) hyperthyroidism may lower TSH to <0.1 μU/mL
and, therefore, suppression of TSH alone does not confirm that symptoms
are caused by hyperthyroidism.
Thyroid imaging with ultrasound or radionuclide scan is not useful in
diagnosing hyperthyroidism.

Differential Diagnosis
The cause of hyperthyroidism should be determined, since this affects the choice of
therapy (Table 8-4). Differential diagnosis is based on:
Palpation of the thyroid. Almost all hyperthyroid patients with a diffuse nontender
goiter have Graves’ disease, but this is also rarely due to postpartum or painless
thyroiditis. Patients without palpable thyroid enlargement almost always have
Graves’ disease, but the possibility of factitious hyperthyroidism should be
considered if there is no goiter. The diagnosis of toxic MNG or hyperthyroidism due
to a thyroid adenoma is made by palpating multiple nodules or a single nodule. A
painful, tender thyroid indicates subacute thyroiditis.
The presence of proptosis or pretibial myxedema, which indicate Graves’
disease (although many patients with Graves’ disease lack these signs).
Recent pregnancy, neck pain, or iodine administration, which suggest other
causes.
TABLE 8-4 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF HYPERTHYROIDISM

TABLE 8-5 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF HYPERTHYROIDISM BASED
ON RAIU

90

Most cases are due to Graves’ disease or toxic MNG, and the diagnosis is usually
obvious from the clinical findings and palpation of the thyroid. In a few patients
with a diffuse goiter or with no thyroid enlargement, 24-hour radioactive iodine
uptake (RAIU, Table 8-5) is needed to distinguish Graves’ disease (in which
RAIU is elevated) from diseases in which RAIU is low.

Treatment
Some forms of hyperthyroidism (subacute or postpartum thyroiditis) are transient
and require only symptomatic therapy.
Three methods are available for definitive therapy (none of which controls
hyperthyroidism rapidly): RAI, thionamides, and subtotal thyroidectomy. During
the initial phase of treatment, patients are followed by clinical evaluation and
measurement of plasma free T4. Plasma TSH is useless in assessing the initial
response to therapy, as it remains suppressed until after the patient becomes
euthyroid.
Regardless of the therapy used, all patients with Graves’ disease require lifelong
follow-up for recurrent hyperthyroidism or development of hypothyroidism.

Symptom Relief
A β-adrenergic antagonist (such as atenolol 25 to 100 mg daily) is used to relieve
symptoms such as palpitations, tremor, and anxiety, until hyperthyroidism is
controlled by definitive therapy, or until transient forms of hyperthyroidism subside.
The dose is adjusted to alleviate symptoms and tachycardia, and then reduced
gradually as hyperthyroidism is controlled. Verapamil at an initial dose of 40 to 80
mg orally tid can be used to control tachycardia in patients with contraindications to
β-adrenergic antagonists.

Choice of Definitive Therapy in Graves’ Disease
In Graves’ disease, RAI therapy is the treatment of choice for almost all
patients. It is simple and highly effective, but it cannot be used during
91

pregnancy or lactation.
Propylthiouracil (PTU) should be used to treat hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.
Long-term control of Graves’ disease with thionamides is achieved in less than
one-half of patients, and these drugs carry a small risk of life-threatening side
effects. They are used in patients with Graves’ disease who refuse RAI therapy.
Thyroidectomy should be used in patients who refuse RAI therapy and who
relapse or develop side effects with thionamide therapy.

Choice of Definite Therapy in Other Causes of Hyperthyroidism
Toxic MNG and toxic adenoma should be treated with RAI (except in pregnancy).
Transient forms of hyperthyroidism caused by thyroiditis should be treated
symptomatically with atenolol.
Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is treated with methimazole and atenolol until the
patient is euthyroid.
Although treatment of some patients with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism
with glucocorticoids has been advocated, nearly all patients with amiodaroneinduced hyperthyroidism respond well to thionamide therapy.2

RAI Therapy
A single dose of iodine-131 permanently controls hyperthyroidism in about 90%
of patients, and further doses can be given if necessary. A pregnancy test is done
immediately before therapy in potentially fertile women. A 24-hour RAIU is
usually measured and used to calculate the dose.
Thionamides interfere with RAI therapy and should be discontinued 3 to 7 days
before treatment. If iodine therapy has been given, it should be discontinued at
least 2 weeks before RAI therapy.
Most patients with Graves’ disease are treated with 8 to 10 mCi; treatment of toxic
MNG requires higher doses.
Several months are usually needed to restore euthyroidism. Patients are evaluated
at 4- to 6-week intervals, with assessment of clinical findings and plasma free T4.
If thyroid function stabilizes within the normal range, the interval between
follow-up visits is increased gradually to annual intervals. If hypothyroidism
develops, thyroxine therapy is started.
If symptomatic hyperthyroidism persists after 6 months, RAI treatment is
repeated.
Side effects
92

Hypothyroidism occurs in more than half of patients within the first year and
continues to develop at a rate of approximately 3% per year thereafter.
Because of the release of stored hormone, a slight rise in plasma T4 may occur
in the first 2 weeks after therapy. This development is important only in
patients with severe cardiac disease, which may worsen as a result. Such
patients should be treated initially with thionamides to restore euthyroidism and
to deplete stored hormone before treatment with RAI.
No convincing evidence has been found that RAI has a clinically important
effect on the course of Graves’ eye disease. It does not increase the risk of
malignancy. No increase in congenital abnormalities has been found in the
offspring of women who conceive after RAI therapy, and the radiation exposure
to the ovaries is low, comparable to that from common diagnostic radiographs.
Unwarranted concern for potential teratogenic effects should not influence
physicians’ advice to patients.

Thionamides
Methimazole and PTU inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by thyroid peroxidase.3
PTU also inhibits extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 by type 1 deiodinase.
Once thyroid hormone stores are depleted (after several weeks to months), T4
levels decrease.
These drugs have no permanent effect on thyroid function. In the majority of
patients with Graves’ disease, hyperthyroidism recurs within 6 months after
therapy is discontinued. Spontaneous remission of Graves’ disease occurs in
approximately one-third of patients during thionamide therapy, and in this
minority, no other treatment may be needed. Remission is more likely in mild
hyperthyroidism of recent onset, and if the goiter is small.
Because of a better safety profile, methimazole should be used instead of PTU
except in specific situations (see below).4
Initiation of therapy. Before starting therapy, patients must be warned of side
effects and precautions. Usual starting doses are PTU, 100 to 200 mg orally tid, or
methimazole, 10 to 40 mg orally daily; higher initial doses can be used in severe
hyperthyroidism.
Follow-up. Restoration of euthyroidism takes up to several months. Patients are
initially evaluated at 4-week intervals with assessment of clinical findings and
plasma free T4. If plasma free T4 levels do not fall after 4 to 8 weeks, the dose
should be increased. Doses for PTU and methimazole, respectively, as high as
300 mg orally qid, or methimazole, 60 mg daily, may be required. Once the
93

plasma free T4 level falls to normal, the dose is adjusted to maintain plasma free
T4 within the normal range.
There is no consensus on the optimal duration of therapy, but periods of 6 months
to 2 years are most common. Patients must be monitored carefully for recurrence
of hyperthyroidism after the drug is stopped.
Side effects are most likely to occur within the first few months of therapy.
Minor side effects include rash, urticaria, fever, arthralgias, and transient
leukopenia.
Agranulocytosis occurs in about 0.3% of patients treated with thionamides.
Other life-threatening side effects include hepatitis, vasculitis, and druginduced lupus erythematosus. These complications usually resolve if the drug is
stopped promptly, but fatal hepatitis is more common with PTU than
methimazole.
Patients must be warned to discontinue the drug immediately if jaundice or
symptoms suggestive of agranulocytosis develop (e.g., fever, chills, sore
throat) and to contact their physician promptly for evaluation. Routine
monitoring of the white blood cell (WBC) count is not useful for detecting
agranulocytosis, which develops suddenly.

Subtotal Thyroidectomy
This procedure provides long-term control of hyperthyroidism in most patients.
Surgery may trigger a perioperative exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, and patients
should be prepared for surgery by one of two methods.
Methimazole is given until the patient is nearly euthyroid. Supersaturated
potassium iodide (SSKI), 80 mg (2 drops) orally bid, is then added 1 to 2
weeks before surgery. Both drugs are stopped postoperatively.
Atenolol (50 to 100 mg daily) is started 1 to 2 weeks before surgery. The dose
of atenolol is increased, if necessary, to reduce the resting heart rate below 90
beats/minute and is continued for 5 to 7 days postoperatively. SSKI is dosed as
indicated previously.
Clinical findings and plasma free T4 and TSH should be assessed 4 to 6 weeks
after surgery. If thyroid function is normal, the patient is seen at 3 and 6 months,
and then annually. If symptomatic hypothyroidism develops, thyroxine therapy is
started. Mild hypothyroidism after subtotal thyroidectomy may be transient, and
asymptomatic patients can be observed for an additional 4 to 6 weeks to
determine whether hypothyroidism will resolve spontaneously. Hyperthyroidism
94

persists or recurs in 3% to 7% of patients.
Complications of thyroidectomy include hypothyroidism in 30% to 50% of
patients and hypoparathyroidism in 3%. Rare complications include permanent
vocal cord paralysis, resulting from recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and
perioperative death. The complication rate appears to depend on the experience
of the surgeon.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Mild (or subclinical) hyperthyroidism is diagnosed when the plasma TSH is
suppressed to <0.1 μU/mL, but the patient has no symptoms that are definitely
caused by hyperthyroidism, and plasma levels of free T4 and T3 are normal.
Because subclinical hyperthyroidism increases the risk of atrial fibrillation in
the elderly and those with heart disease; and predisposes to osteoporosis in
postmenopausal women, it should be treated in these patients. Asymptomatic
young patients with mild Graves’ disease can be observed at semiannual intervals
for spontaneous resolution of hyperthyroidism, or the development of symptoms
and increasing free T4 levels that warrant treatment.
Urgent therapy is warranted when hyperthyroidism exacerbates heart failure or
coronary artery disease and in rare patients with severe hyperthyroidism
complicated by fever and delirium (thyroid storm).5 Concomitant diseases should
be treated intensively, and confirmatory tests should be obtained before therapy is
started, including serum TSH and free T4.
PTU, 300 mg orally q6h, should be started immediately. PTU is preferred over
methimazole because it inhibits conversion of T4 to T3.
Iodide (SSKI, 2 drops orally q12h) should be started after the first dose of
PTU, to inhibit thyroid hormone secretion rapidly.
Propranolol, 40 mg orally q6h (or an equivalent dose of a parenteral βantagonist), should be given to patients with angina or myocardial infarction,
and the dose should be adjusted to control tachycardia. Propranolol may benefit
some patients with heart failure and marked tachycardia but can further impair
left ventricular systolic function. In patients with clinical heart failure,
propranolol should be given only with careful monitoring of left ventricular
function.
Plasma free T4 is measured every 3 to 7 days, and the doses of PTU and iodine
are gradually decreased when free T4 approaches the normal range. RAI
therapy should be scheduled 2 weeks after iodine is discontinued.
95

Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. 6 Hyperthyroidism increases the risk of
miscarriage, preeclampsia, premature labor, and low birth weight, so it must be
controlled. If hyperthyroidism is suspected, plasma TSH should be measured.
Plasma TSH declines in early pregnancy owing to the thyroid-stimulating effects
of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), but rarely to <0.1 μU/mL. If TSH is <0.1
μU/mL, the diagnosis should be confirmed by measurement of plasma free T4.
RAI therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy, and these patients should be
treated with PTU. Methimazole is not used because it is associated with certain
congenital defects. The dose should be adjusted at 4-week intervals to maintain
the plasma free T4 near the upper limit of the normal range. The dose required
often decreases in the later stages of pregnancy. It is important to avoid
overtreatment, since PTU crosses the placenta and can cause fetal
hypothyroidism.
Atenolol, 25 to 50 mg orally daily, can be used to relieve symptoms while
awaiting the effects of PTU.
TSIs also cross the placenta and can cause fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism. In
pregnant women who have previously been treated with RAI or thyroidectomy
and are no longer hyperthyroid, measurement of plasma TSI in the third
trimester helps assess the risk of neonatal hyperthyroidism.
Newborns should be monitored carefully for hyperthyroidism.
After delivery, methimazole should be substituted for PTU. Women treated with
methimazole may safely breastfeed.
Treatment of Graves’ ophthalmopathy. Mild or moderate ophthalmopathy often
resolves spontaneously and may require no treatment. Symptoms of conjunctival
irritation respond to lubricant eye drops (e.g., Refresh eye drops) and ointment at
bedtime (e.g., Refresh PM), which also protect against exposure keratitis. More
severe ophthalmopathy, with the risk of visual loss, should be treated with
glucocorticoids in consultation with an experienced ophthalmologist.

Hypothyroidism
William E. Clutter
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hypothyroidism is the syndrome caused by thyroid hormone deficiency. It is
common, especially in women, with a prevalence of about 2% (compared with 0.1%
for men). The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 7.5% in women and
3% in men, and increases with age. Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most
common congenital defects (about 1 in 5000 births).

Etiology
Primary hypothyroidism (resulting from disease of the thyroid itself) accounts for
more than 95% of cases (Table 9-1).
Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s disease) is by far the most
common cause. It is an autoimmune disorder in which the thyroid is damaged by
cell-mediated immunity.
Iatrogenic hypothyroidism due to thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine (RAI,
iodine-131) therapy is also common.
Transient hypothyroidism occurs in painless (or postpartum) thyroiditis and
subacute thyroiditis, usually after a period of hyperthyroidism.
Drugs that may cause hypothyroidism (usually in patients with underlying
autoimmune thyroiditis) include iodine-containing drugs such as amiodarone,
lithium, interferon-α and interferon-β, interleukin-2, thalidomide, bexarotene,
and sunitinib. Thionamide drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism can cause
hypothyroidism if the dose is excessive.
Secondary hypothyroidism due to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency
is uncommon but may occur in any disorder of the pituitary or hypothalamus,
including surgery, trauma, or radiation to the area. However, it rarely occurs
without other evidence of pituitary disease.
Rare hemangiomas that express thyroid hormone deiodinase type 3 (which
converts thyroxine [T4] to inactive reverse triiodothyronine [rT3]) have been
98

reported to cause hypothyroidism, a syndrome called consumptive
hypothyroidism.
Thyroid hormone resistance caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptorbeta gene usually does not cause symptoms of hypothyroidism, since increased
levels of thyroid hormone compensate for defective responsiveness.

Pathophysiology
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) is much more common
in women, and increases in prevalence with age. The disease gradually impairs
the thyroid’s ability to produce hormone, prompting a compensatory rise in TSH
secretion. This additional stimulus maintains normal thyroid hormone levels for a
time (a state called subclinical hypothyroidism). In many of these patients,
hormone production eventually falls despite high TSH levels, and frank clinical
hypothyroidism develops. Patients usually have antithyroid antibodies
(antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin), but cellular immunity is more
important in thyroid dysfunction. They may have autoimmune disease of other
endocrine glands (such as Addison’s disease), and often have a family history of
either Hashimoto’s or Graves’ disease. There is lymphocytic infiltration of the
thyroid, fibrosis, and variable degrees of follicular destruction. Depending on the
extent of follicular damage and lymphocytic infiltration, it causes an atrophic,
impalpable thyroid or a firm, nontender diffuse goiter. (Hashimoto’s disease is
also the most common cause of euthyroid goiter in the United States.)
TABLE 9-1 CAUSES OF HYPOTHYROIDISM

Iatrogenic hypothyroidism is a common complication of treatment for
hyperthyroidism. After radioactive iodine therapy, it may occur quickly, or not
99

until years later. Hypothyroidism always follows the complete or near-complete
thyroidectomy done for thyroid cancer, and may occur after subtotal
thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism.
Most cases of congenital hypothyroidism are caused by dysplasia or aplasia of
the thyroid, with little or no detectable thyroid tissue. Rarely, genetic defects of
hormone synthetic enzymes, or maternal treatment with antithyroid drugs or iodine
cause congenital hypothyroidism with a goiter.
Drug-induced hypothyroidism can occur during treatment of Graves’ disease with
thionamides. Occasionally, iodine excess or lithium (which inhibit thyroid
hormone secretion) cause hypothyroidism, usually in patients with underlying
autoimmune thyroiditis.
Most cases of hypothyroidism are permanent, but self-limited forms of thyroiditis
(painless lymphocytic thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis) cause transient
hypothyroidism, usually after a period of hyperthyroidism. Painless thyroiditis is
most common in the postpartum period.
In secondary hypothyroidism there are usually other pituitary hormone
deficiencies, and since TSH is not elevated, there is no goiter.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Hypothyroidism causes a variety of symptoms, many of which are nonspecific
(Table 9-2). It usually develops gradually, and the onset of symptoms is insidious.
TABLE 9-2 SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF HYPOTHYROIDISM

The most specific findings are cold intolerance (feeling cold when others are
comfortable) and delayed relaxation of tendon reflexes. Patients may or may not
100

have a goiter. Other symptoms include mild weight gain (due to decreased
metabolic rate), fatigue, somnolence, poor memory, constipation, menorrhagia and
impaired fertility, myalgias, and hoarseness. Other signs include bradycardia,
facial and periorbital edema, dry skin, and nonpitting edema (myxedema) that
results from accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in interstitial spaces.
Hypothyroidism does not cause marked obesity.
Rare manifestations include hypoventilation, hypothermia, pericardial or pleural
effusions, deafness, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Laboratory findings may include hyponatremia and elevated plasma levels of
cholesterol, triglycerides, and creatine kinase. Primary hypothyroidism may cause
hyperprolactinemia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) may show low voltage and Twave abnormalities.

Diagnostic Testing
Hypothyroidism is common, readily treatable, and should be suspected in any patient
with compatible symptoms, especially in the presence of a diffuse goiter or a history
of RAI therapy or thyroid surgery.
In suspected primary hypothyroidism, plasma TSH is the best initial diagnostic
test. A normal value excludes primary hypothyroidism, and a markedly elevated
value (>20 μU/mL) confirms the diagnosis. It is seldom necessary to measure
thyroid autoantibodies, since Hashimoto’s thyroiditis accounts for almost all
spontaneous hypothyroidism.
Mild elevation of plasma TSH (<20 μU/mL) may be caused by nonthyroidal
illness, but usually indicates mild (or subclinical) primary hypothyroidism, in
which thyroid function is impaired but increased secretion of TSH maintains
plasma free T4 levels within the reference range.
These patients may have nonspecific symptoms compatible with hypothyroidism
and a mild increase in serum cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol. They develop clinical hypothyroidism at a rate of about 2.5% per
year.
In patients with mildly elevated plasma TSH, the test should be repeated with
measurement of plasma free T4 to confirm the diagnosis.
If secondary hypothyroidism is suspected because of evidence of pituitary
disease (e.g., a known sella turcica or hypothalamic mass, or a history of pituitary
surgery, radiation, or trauma), plasma free T4should be measured. A low value
is diagnostic of secondary hypothyroidism in this setting.
Plasma TSH levels are usually within the reference range in secondary
101

hypothyroidism and cannot be used alone to make this diagnosis.
Patients with secondary hypothyroidism should be evaluated for other pituitary
hormone deficits and the pituitary should be imaged with magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI).

TREATMENT
Levothyroxine is the drug of choice. The average replacement dose is 1.6 mcg/kg
orally daily, and most patients require doses between 75 and 150 mcg daily. In
elderly patients, the average replacement dose is lower. The need for lifelong
treatment should be emphasized.
Levothyroxine should be taken 30 minutes before a meal, since dietary fiber and
soy products interfere with its absorption. It should not be taken together with
medications that inhibit its absorption including calcium or iron
supplements, cholestyramine, sucralfate, and aluminum hydroxide.
Other drug interactions that increase thyroxine clearance and dose
requirement include estrogen, rifampin, some anticonvulsants (carbamazepine,
phenytoin, and phenobarbital), and some anticancer drugs (imatinib and
bexarotene). Newer anticonvulsants have not been reported to cause this
interaction. Amiodarone blocks conversion of T4 to T3, and also increases
levothyroxine dose requirements.
Initiation of therapy. Young, otherwise healthy adults should be started on 1.6
mcg/kg daily. This regimen gradually corrects hypothyroidism, since thyroxine has
a half-life of 7 days, and several weeks are required to reach steady-state plasma
levels of T4. Symptoms begin to improve within a few weeks. In otherwise
healthy elderly patients, the initial dose should be 50 mcg daily. Patients with
cardiac disease should be started on 25 to 50 mcg daily and monitored carefully
for exacerbation of cardiac symptoms.
Dose adjustment and follow-up
In primary hypothyroidism, the goal of therapy is to maintain plasma TSH
within the normal range. Plasma TSH should be measured 6 to 8 weeks after
initiation of therapy. The dose of levothyroxine should be adjusted in 12 to 25
mcg increments at intervals of 6 to 8 weeks until plasma TSH level is normal.
Thereafter, annual TSH measurement is adequate to monitor therapy. TSH
should also be measured frequently in the first trimester of pregnancy, since
the thyroxine dose requirement increases at this time (see Pregnancy section
under Special Considerations).
102

In secondary hypothyroidism, plasma TSH cannot be used to adjust
therapy. The goal of therapy is to maintain the plasma free T4near the
middle of the reference range. The dose of levothyroxine should be adjusted
at 6- to 8-week intervals until this goal is achieved. Thereafter, annual
measurement of plasma free T4 is adequate to monitor therapy.
Side effects. Overtreatment produces iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, indicated by a
subnormal TSH level, and should be avoided since it increases the risk of
osteoporosis and atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease may be exacerbated by treatment of hypothyroidism.
The dose of levothyroxine should be increased slowly, with careful attention to
worsening angina, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
In patients with concomitant adrenal failure, correction of hypothyroidism may
exacerbate the symptoms and signs of adrenal failure.
In patients with pituitary disease and secondary hypothyroidism, the pituitary–
adrenal axis should be assessed and treatment of secondary adrenal failure
started before treatment of hypothyroidism.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Mild (or Subclinical) Hypothyroidism
Patients with mild hypothyroidism should be treated with levothyroxine if any of
the following are present:
symptoms compatible with hypothyroidism,1
a goiter,
hypercholesterolemia that warrants treatment,
pregnancy, or
the plasma TSH is >10 μU/mL.
Untreated patients should be monitored annually, and levothyroxine should be
started if symptoms develop or serum TSH increases to >10 μU/mL.

Pregnancy
Thyroxine dose requirement increases by an average of 50% in the first half of
pregnancy owing to accelerated conversion of T4 to reverse T3 by placental
deiodinase type 3.2
In women with primary hypothyroidism, plasma TSH level should be measured as
soon as pregnancy is confirmed and monthly thereafter through the second
103

trimester.3 The levothyroxine dose should be increased as needed to maintain
plasma TSH level within the normal range.
An alternative approach is to instruct patients to increase their levothyroxine dose
by 1 to 2 pills per week as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, and to monitor and
adjust the dose as above.4
After delivery, the prepregnancy dose should be resumed.

Problems with Treatment
Treatment of most cases of hypothyroidism is simple and straightforward.
Occasionally, it is difficult to achieve a levothyroxine dose that normalizes TSH
level, or a dose that was adequate no longer maintains a normal TSH level. Common
explanations for this include:
Poor or erratic medication compliance. Directly observed therapy at weekly
intervals may be necessary in some cases.
Drug interactions (see Treatment section in this chapter).
Pregnancy, in which the dose requirement increases in the first trimester.
Gradual failure of remaining endogenous thyroid function after RAI treatment
of hyperthyroidism.

Diagnosis of Hypothyroidism in Severely Ill Patients
In severe nonthyroidal illness, the diagnosis of hypothyroidism may be difficult
(see Chapter 6).5 Plasma total T4 and free T4 measured by routine assays may be
low.
Plasma TSH is the best initial diagnostic test. A normal TSH value is strong
evidence that the patient is euthyroid, except when there is evidence of
pituitary or hypothalamic disease or in patients treated with dopamine or high
doses of glucocorticoids.
Marked elevation of plasma TSH (>20 μU/mL) establishes the diagnosis of
primary hypothyroidism.
Moderate elevations of plasma TSH (<20 μU/mL) may occur in euthyroid
patients with nonthyroidal illness and are not specific for hypothyroidism.
Plasma free T4 should be measured if TSH is moderately elevated, or if
secondary hypothyroidism is suspected, and patients should be treated for
hypothyroidism if plasma free T4 is low. Thyroid function in these patients should
be reevaluated after recovery from illness.

104

Emergent Therapy for Hypothyroidism is Rarely Necessary
Most patients with hypothyroidism and concomitant illness can be treated in the
usual manner. However, hypothyroidism may impair survival in critical illness by
contributing to hypoventilation, hypotension, hypothermia, bradycardia, or
hyponatremia. Little evidence supports the contention that severe hypothyroidism
alone causes coma or shock; most reports of myxedema coma predate recognition
that nonthyroidal illness itself lowers thyroid hormone levels (see Section Diagnosis
of Hypothyroidism in Severely Ill Patients in this chapter).
Hypoventilation and hypotension should be treated intensively, along with any
concomitant diseases. Confirmatory tests (plasma TSH and free T4) should be
obtained before thyroid hormone therapy is started in a severely ill patient.
Levothyroxine, 50 to 100 mcg IV, can be given q6 to 8h for 24 hours, followed
by 75 to 100 mcg IV daily until oral intake is possible. Replacement therapy
should be continued in the usual manner if the diagnosis of hypothyroidism is
confirmed. No clinical trials have determined the optimum method of thyroid
hormone replacement, but this method rapidly alleviates thyroxine deficiency
while minimizing the risk of exacerbating underlying coronary disease or heart
failure.
Such rapid correction is warranted only in extremely ill patients. Vital signs
and cardiac rhythm should be monitored carefully to detect early signs of
exacerbation of heart disease.
Hydrocortisone, 50 mg IV q8h, is usually recommended during rapid replacement
of thyroid hormone, because such therapy may precipitate adrenal crisis in
patients with adrenal failure.

THYROIDITIS
General Principles
There are several types of thyroiditis that may cause hyperthyroidism,
hypothyroidism, or a euthyroid goiter.6
Autoimmune or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (See the Section Pathophysiology in this
chapter)
Painless thyroiditis (also known as postpartum or silent thyroiditis) is an
autoimmune disorder that is most common in the first 6 months of the postpartum
period. The incidence is believed to be approximately 10% in the United States.
It is characterized by a small, nontender diffuse goiter, and transient
hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism, although only one phase may be
105

recognized clinically.
Hypothyroidism is usually transient, but may be permanent.
Hyperthyroidism results from follicular damage and release of stored hormone
by a lymphocytic infiltrate. Consequently, radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU)
is very low. Antithyroid peroxidase antibodies may be present.
The diagnosis should be suspected in women with symptoms of hyperthyroidism
or hypothyroidism within 6 months of delivery. Plasma TSH and free T4 should
be measured to confirm the functional state. The hyperthyroid phase can be
distinguished from Graves’ disease by the absence of proptosis (which is seen
only in Graves’ disease), measurement of RAIU (if the patient is not nursing),
and repeating thyroid function tests after several weeks to assess for
spontaneous improvement.
Symptoms of hyperthyroidism should be treated with a β-adrenergic
antagonist. Thionamides are not useful, since thyroid hormone synthesis is
already suppressed.
Symptomatic hypothyroidism is treated with replacement therapy with
levothyroxine for 2 to 3 months followed by discontinuation for 4 to 6 weeks
and measurement of plasma TSH level. Women with a history of postpartum
thyroiditis have a higher risk of developing hypothyroidism in later life.
Subacute thyroiditis (also known as de Quervain’s or granulomatous thyroiditis)
is characterized by a painful, tender goiter and transient hyperthyroidism resulting
from release of stored thyroid hormone, followed by transient hypothyroidism. It
is the most common cause of thyroid pain. It frequently occurs after an upper
respiratory tract infection and is thought to have a viral etiology.
Symptoms of hyperthyroidism occur in ~50% of patients and can be treated with
a β-adrenergic antagonist.
Pain should be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs);
corticosteroid treatment may be needed in severe cases.
Thionamides or RAI are not useful.
Transient hypothyroidism may be treated with levothyroxine for 3 to 6 months.
Acute infectious thyroiditis. Infection of the thyroid by bacteria, fungi,
mycobacteria, or parasites is rare. It may occur in immunosuppressed, elderly, or
debilitated patients, or in patients with underlying thyroid disease. Patients are
acutely ill, with fever, chills, dysphagia, anterior neck pain, and swelling. The
thyroid is tender. Patients are usually biochemically euthyroid. Diagnosis is made
by fine-needle aspiration, with Gram’s staining and culture of the aspirate.
Antibiotics and drainage of abscess are the mainstays of treatment.
106

Reidel’s thyroiditis is a very rare fibrosing thyroiditis that may be part of a
systemic fibrosing process. Patients present with a painless, hard, fixed goiter.
Patients are initially euthyroid, but hypothyroidism eventually develops.
Treatment is primarily surgical, although therapy with glucocorticoids and
methotrexate may be tried early in the course of the disease.

Adrenal Incidentaloma
Shunzhong Bao and Simon J. Fisher
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Adrenal incidentalomas are masses (>1 cm) found incidentally during
radiographic imaging of the abdomen or chest. By definition, patients do not
present for evaluation of signs or symptoms of adrenal diseases.
This does not mean the patients do not have any symptoms or signs associated with
it.

Epidemiology
Using computed tomography (CT) scanning, the prevalence of adrenal
incidentalomas in the general population is ~3%, and increases with age. In
autopsy series, adrenal masses between 2 mm and 4 cm in size have been reported
as high as 8.7%.1
Bilateral masses were found in 10 to 15 percent of cases.

Etiology
In one of the largest databases to date with 1004 adrenal incidentalomas, the
National Italian Study Group has confirmed that the most common finding (85%)
on evaluation with hormone testing is a nonfunctioning mass (cortical adenoma,
myelolipoma, cyst, ganglioneuroma, or other).2
Evaluation of the remaining masses revealed subclinical Cushing’s syndrome
(9.2%), pheochromocytoma (4.2%), aldosterone-secreting adenoma (1.6%), and a
single virilizing tumor. Table 10-1 lists several common diagnoses associated
with adrenal incidentalomas.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
108

A thorough history for any symptoms of hormonal dysfunction and possibility of
malignancy should be completed.
Special effort should be made to elicit any subtle symptoms and physical
examination signs suggesting specific hormonal hyperfunction or malignancy:
Cushing’s syndrome (weight gain, moon facies, central obesity,
supraclavicular fat pads, thinned skin, easy bruising, striae, acne, proximal
muscle weakness, irregular menses, hirsutism, hypertension, diabetes, and
vertebral compression fractures);
Pheochromocytoma (hypertension, paroxysms of headache, palpitations,
anxiety attacks, perspiration, and/or pallor). About 15% patients with
pheochromocytoma do not have hypertension.
Aldosterone-secreting adenoma (hypertension or hypokalemia);
TABLE 10-1 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ADRENAL
INCIDENTALOMA

Malignancy (weight loss, history of primary nonadrenal cancers, lymphoma,
and virilizing signs or symptoms suggestive of adrenocortical carcinoma).
A known history of malignancy makes metastasis to the adrenal gland more
likely.

Diagnostic Criteria
In evaluating such a mass, the major concerns to address are:
Is the mass benign or malignant?
109

Does the mass secrete hormones, or is the mass nonfunctioning?

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Nearly all patients with an adrenal incidentalomas should be screened for
subclinical Cushing’s syndrome and pheochromocytoma. Hyperaldosteronism
should be screened for in hypertensive patients. Patients with virilization should
be screened for adrenocorticol carcinoma.
Subclinical Cushing’s syndrome: 2009 AACE/AAES Guidelines 3 suggest a 1 mg
dexamethasone suppression test to rule out subclinical Cushing’s syndrome.
Other screening tests that can be used are the midnight salivary cortisol level or a
24-hour urine cortisol level.
Subclinical pheochromocytoma: screen with plasma metanephrine and
normetanephrine or 24-hour urine metanephrine and normetanephrine.
Hyperaldosteronism:
serum potassium and
plasma
aldosterone
concentration/plasma renin activity ratio (PAC/PRA) >20 is suggestive of
hyperaldosteronism.
A dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) level should be determined if
virilizing signs or symptoms are present.
Any positive results on these screening tests should prompt further evaluation.
Please refer to chapters on Conn’s syndrome (Chapter 13), Cushing’s syndrome
(Chapter 14), and Pheochromocytoma (Chapter 15) for more detailed discussions
of these tests and their interpretation.
Imaging
The probability of an adrenal mass being malignant directly correlates with its
size. Tumor diameters ranging from 3 to 6 cm have been proposed as cutoffs that
should lead to surgical resection. A Mayo Clinic retrospective analysis of 342
adrenal masses removed over a 5-year period revealed that all adrenocortical
carcinomas were ≥4 cm in diameter. In a larger retrospective series from Italy, a
4 cm cutoff was 93% sensitive for adrenocortical carcinoma, but 76% of lesions
>4 cm were benign.
CT scan may be useful in establishing whether an adrenal mass is benign or
malignant. A homogeneous adrenal mass <4 cm with smooth borders and an
attenuation value <10 Hounsfield units strongly suggests a benign lesion.4,5
Diagnostic criteria are not as clear for lesions measuring 4 to 6 cm, but if they are
110

hormonally inactive and have a clear benign appearance on CT scan, such lesions
can be monitored. Lesions >6 cm, regardless of appearance on CT scan, are
more likely to be malignant, and surgical referral is warranted. All lesions >4
cm with undeterminant imaging characteristics need to be referred for surgery.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appears to be as effective as CT scanning in
distinguishing benign and malignant masses,5 with benign adenomas exhibiting
signal drop on chemical shift imaging with intensity similar to that of T2-weighted
images of the liver. Pheochromocytomas generally exhibit hyperintensity on T2weighted imaging. Again, lesions >6 cm in diameter by MRI are more likely to be
malignant, even if they have a benign appearance on MRI, and should prompt
surgical referral.
Diagnostic Procedures
Fine-needle aspiration and tissue biopsy
Biopsy of the adrenal mass is generally not advised, as it is rarely helpful.
The major exception is a patient with a known extraadrenal primary malignancy. In
this case, biopsy may help distinguish recurrence and metastasis of cancer from a
benign adenoma.
Biopsy should be done only if pheochromocytoma has been ruled out by
biochemical testing, as biopsy of a pheochromocytoma can precipitate a
hypertensive emergency.

TREATMENT
At the completion of the clinical, biochemical, and radiologic evaluation
described previously, any mass that suggests primary adrenocortical malignancy
by size or by radiologic characteristics warrants surgical removal, as long as the
patient is a good surgical candidate.
Metastatic cancer or a primary nonadrenal cancer, such as lymphoma,
generally no surgical removal is needed, but rather treatment of the primary
cancer.
Adrenal function is unlikely to be hindered by tumor invasion, because more than
70% to 80% of the gland function must be interrupted to pose any risk for adrenal
crisis.
Pheochromocytomas should be surgically removed (see Chapter 15 for a more
detailed discussion).
Aldosterone-secreting adenomas should be considered for surgical removal.
However, it is not easy to differentiate between aldosterone-secreting adenomas
111

and primary adrenal hyperplasia. The distinction between these two is crucial,
since aldosterone-secreting tumors are best treated surgically, while medical
management is preferred for primary adrenal hyperplasia.
Prior to surgical excision of an adrenal mass, it is important to exclude
pheochromocytoma and to assess for excess cortisol secretion.
The diagnoses of a hormonally hypersecreting adrenal mass and adrenocortical
carcinoma are not mutually exclusive. It is common for adrenocortical carcinomas
to release excessive cortisol.
If there is any suspicion of excessive cortisol secretion, one should be aware of
the possibility of adrenal crisis during or after the surgery. It has been reported
several times in the literature that even mild cortisol hypersecretion of one
adrenal gland may atrophy the contralateral adrenal gland.
When the hyperfunctioning adrenal gland is removed, the atrophied gland may not
be able to compensate in the setting of postsurgical recovery. These patients
should be covered with stress-dose steroids during surgery and receive a
corticotropin stimulation test after surgery to diagnose any resulting adrenal
insufficiency.
Patients who fail postoperative corticotropin stimulation testing may require
months of glucocorticoid replacement before recovery of the hypothalamicpituitary–adrenal axis. Thus, even if the size of the mass warrants its removal, the
patient should still undergo a complete biochemical workup to rule out subclinical
Cushing’s syndrome or pheochromocytoma.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
If the history, physical examination, and hormonal and radiologic evaluations are
not suggestive of either a primary adrenal carcinoma or a hypersecreting
adenoma, then it is reasonable to conclude that the incidentaloma is benign, but
follow-up is necessary.
Patients should be evaluated annually with a thorough history and physical
examination for development of overt signs of hypersecretion or malignancy.
Schedules for follow-up by repeat radiologic imaging and biochemical analyses
remain controversial.
Imaging should be repeated in 3 to 6 months, and nodules that enlarge should be
removed.6 Nodules that remain stable in size are very unlikely to be malignant,
and the risk of further imaging outweighs the benefits.7
Biochemically, patients should be evaluated annually for at least 5 years.3

Adrenal Insufficiency
Zhiyu Wang and Kim Carmichael
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a clinical syndrome arising from disruption of the
normal hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis regulation of steroidogenesis.
In 1855, Thomas Addison first described his eponymous syndrome, which was
characterized by wasting and hyperpigmentation, and identified its cause as
destruction of the adrenal gland.1

Classification
Primary AI (Addison’s disease) corresponds to dysfunction at the level of the
adrenal gland from any cause.
Secondary AI refers to ACTH deficiency. It can be due to dysfunction of either the
hypothalamus or pituitary gland.

Epidemiology
Chronic primary adrenal insufficiency has a prevalence of 90 to 140 per million
and an incidence of 4.7 to 6.2 per million/year in Caucasian populations. The age
at diagnosis peaks in the fourth decade of life.2
Secondary adrenal insufficiency has an estimated prevalence of 150 to 280 per
million with a peak age of diagnosis in the sixth decade of life.2
Both conditions are more prevalent in women than in men.

Etiology
For a complete list of causes of adrenal insufficiency, see Table 11-1.
Primary AI
When Thomas Addison described his initial case in 1855, tuberculosis was the
most common etiology for primary AI, and it remains a major factor in the
developing world.3
114

Over the years, autoimmune destruction of the adrenal gland (autoimmune
adrenalitis) has emerged as the leading cause of primary AI in the United States. It
can be isolated or occur as part of an autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS,
types I and II)4 (see Chapter 36).
Hereditary factors are increasingly recognized in primary AI.5
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia causes functional abnormalities of adrenal steroid
biosynthesis enzymes, leading to impaired cortisol synthesis (see Chapter 12).
Other etiologies to consider for primary AI include the following:2
Disseminated tuberculosis, fungal infections, human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-related opportunistic infections (most commonly cytomegalovirus
[CMV]).
Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage associated with coagulopathies or sepsis.
Metastatic cancer involving more than 80% to 90% of the total adrenal mass.
TABLE 11-1 CAUSES OF ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY

115

Some medications can also potentially precipitate symptomatic adrenal
insufficiency in a person with limited adrenal reserve.
Rifampin and phenytoin increase cortisol metabolism.
Ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, etomidate, and suramin decrease cortisol
secretion by inhibiting cortisol biosynthesis.
116

Secondary AI
Iatrogenic
Sudden cessation of exogenous glucocorticoid therapy is a common clinical
problem and is the most frequent cause of secondary AI. Exogenous
glucocorticoid administration via any route may lead to suppression of the HPA
axis depending on the dose and duration of therapy.6
Megestrol acetate (Megace) can suppress the HPA axis to cause adrenal
insufficiency; affected patients need to be supported with exogenous
glucocorticoids until the axis recovers following discontinuation of megestrol
acetate.7
Hypothalamic-pituitary
Among patients with pituitary or hypothalamic disorders, a pituitary mass is
usually associated with panhypopituitarism caused either by tumor growth or
treatment with surgery or irradiation.
Other causes include autoimmune lymphocytice hypophysitis, infectious and
infiltrative diseases, pituitary infarction or hemorrhage, and head trauma.
Isolated ACTH deficiency is rare.
Mutations of genes important for pituitary development or ACTH synthesis are
also rare.

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis of AI is critical but often difficult. It depends on a high index of clinical
suspicion for the disease that is further corroborated by biochemical evidence.
Despite the various testing options available, no single test classifies all patients
accurately.
The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency requires clinical judgment, as more than one
biochemical test is often needed. It is important to look for internal consistency
among the various tests.

Clinical Presentation
The clinical presentation of AI can be variable and is dependent on the level of the
hypothalamic-pituitary–adrenal axis that is affected, as well as the rate and extent
of loss of adrenal function.
Patients may remain undiagnosed for quite some time until a significant physical
stressor precipitates an adrenal crisis—an endocrine emergency.

117

Acute AI (Adrenal Crisis)
Acute AI most often occurs in patients with primary AI. It is critical to recognize
the clinical syndrome because acute adrenal crisis is an endocrine emergency that
requires prompt treatment.8
Clinical features include:
Usually precipitated by acute stress (surgery, infection, or bilateral adrenal
hemorrhage).
Shock with severe volume depletion and hypotension that is out of proportion to
the severity of the current illness.
May include nausea and vomiting with a history of weight loss and anorexia,
abdominal pain (“acute abdomen” if the etiology is acute adrenal infarction or
hemorrhage), fatigue, fever, confusion or coma, electrolyte abnormalities
(especially hyperkalemia), and eosinophilia.
Chronic Primary Adrenal Insufficiency
Chronic primary adrenal insufficiency is more insidious in its onset.2
A significant illness can transform latent chronic primary AI into a life-threatening
adrenal crisis. Hence, early recognition and diagnosis is essential.
In its early stage, the presenting symptoms may be nonspecific:
Chronic malaise, generalized weakness, myalgias, weight loss;
Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and chronic abdominal pain.
Primary AI often leads to both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency.
Lack of feedback inhibition on the pituitary by cortisol leads to increased
ACTH secretion, which stimulates the melanocortin receptor to upregulate
melanin synthesis, and causes generalized hyperpigmentation of the skin and
mucosa.
Mineralocorticoid deficiency results in renal salt wasting. Patients often present
with salt craving, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, as well as volume depletion and
hypotension.
Adrenal androgen secretion is lost, which is clinically more apparent in women
who may complain of loss of axillary and pubic hair, and impairment of
wellbeing.
Patients with autoimmune adrenalitis may have evidence of other autoimmune
diseases such as hypo- or hyperthyroidism, type 1 diabetes, or vitiligo.
Patients with longstanding adrenal insufficiency can also manifest psychiatric
symptoms, ranging from impairment in memory to depression and psychosis.
118

Secondary AI
Patients with secondary AI present with many of the same symptoms as chronic
primary AI. They may rarely present acutely with pituitary apoplexy.
In addition to AI symptoms, secondary AI patients may experience other pituitary
hormone deficiency symptoms such as amenorrhea, decreased libido, or
hypothyroidism. Mass effects (headaches or visual field defects) from a pituitary
or hypothalamic tumor may also be present.
In contrast to primary AI, secondary AI patients do not manifest
hyperpigmentation, because their ACTH is not elevated.
Secondary AI patients also have less prominent electrolyte abnormalities, volume
depletion, and hypotension, because the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system is
usually intact.

Diagnostic Testing
A multistep approach is needed to document:
Whether there is inadequate cortisol secretion by the adrenals.
Whether the cause of adrenal insufficiency is lack of ACTH.
Once AI is documented, a cause should be sought and treated as appropriate.
Laboratory Studies
Testing for Inadequate Cortisol Secretion
Inappropriately low cortisol production is the sine qua non finding in the diagnosis
of AI of any cause.
Basal Cortisol Measurements
Basal cortisol levels of ≥19 mcg/dL rule out AI, whereas early morning (8 AM to
9 AM) cortisol values ≤3 mcg/dL are indicative of the disorder. All other patients
need dynamic testing.9
In interpreting the results, it is important to remember that estrogen therapy raise
plasma corticosteroid-binding globulin and, therefore, cortisol concentrations.
Corticotropin Stimulation Tests
The corticotropin stimulation tests are the most widely used dynamic tests to
assess adrenal function.9,10
The corticotropin (standard 250 mcg or low-dose 1 mcg) can be given
intravenously or intramuscularly. Plasma cortisol is measured before and 30 and
60 minutes after corticotropin.
Peak serum cortisol levels >18 mcg/dL (500 nmol/L) or, preferably, 20 mcg/dL
119

(550 nmol/L), excludes primary adrenal insufficiency and severe chronic
secondary adrenal insufficiency.
The low-dose corticotropin stimulation test has been proposed as a more sensitive
test, especially for mild secondary AI and after treatment with
glucocorticosteroids. However, this concept remains controversial.11,12
It is important to note that the corticotropin stimulation tests may be normal in
recent-onset secondary AI.
Screening with the corticotropin stimulation test for AI after pituitary surgery
should be done at least 4 to 6 weeks after the surgery, since adrenal atrophy
develops only gradually after the onset of ACTH deficiency.
Furthermore, chronic partial secondary adrenal insufficiency may not be
detected by the corticotropin stimulation test.
An insulin tolerance test (ITT) may be needed in these patients (see subsequent
text).
Most steroid replacements (e.g., cortisone, hydrocortisone, and prednisone)
interfere with the radioimmunoassay for serum cortisol. Therefore, patients
already receiving such replacement should have their dose delayed on the day of
testing until after the cosyntropin stimulation test.
If adrenal crisis is suspected, intravenous saline and dexamethasone, 4 mg IV q6h,
should be started until the corticotropin stimulation test can be performed. In this
acute setting, dexamethasone is the preferred glucocorticoid, because it does not
cross-react with the cortisol in the assay and permits subsequent testing.
Insulin Tolerance Test
ITT is regarded as the gold standard in the assessment of suspected secondary AI,
since hypoglycemia is a powerful stressor that results in rapid activation of the
HPA axis.9
Intravenous insulin at a dose of 0.1 to 0.15 U/kg is given to achieve hypoglycemia.
Plasma glucose and cortisol are measured at 0, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes
after insulin infusion.
Adequate hypoglycemia of <40 mg/dL with neuroglycopenic symptoms is
essential.
Normal subjects have a plasma cortisol increase to at least 18 mcg/dL. Use of the
higher cutoff point (≥20 mcg/dL) is preferable to avoid underdiagnosis of AI.
During the test, close supervision is mandatory. Cardiovascular disease or a
history of seizures are contraindications to performing this test.
Adrenal Function During Critical Illness
Evaluating the HPA axis during critical illness can be challenging.13
120

Cortisol levels vary broadly with disease severity.
Inappropriately low cortisol levels can be seen during critical illness with a
structurally normal HPA axis (“relative” adrenal insufficiency).
Severely ill patients also have decreased cortisol-binding proteins, which leads
to an increase in the ratio of free to bound serum cortisol.
Recommendations from the American College of Critical Care Medicine have
suggested that AI in critically ill patients is best diagnosed by a basal cortisol
level of <10 mcg/dL or an incremental response <9 mcg/dL after standard 250
mcg corticotropin stimulation test.
In light of these issues, there is currently no consensus regarding the precise
diagnostic criteria in critical care settings.
Differentiating Primary and Secondary AI
Baseline ACTH Concentration14,15
The cosyntropin stimulation test alone does not definitively differentiate between
primary and secondary disease.
A baseline ACTH level obtained at the same time as a basal cortisol level can be
helpful in this regard. A disproportionately elevated baseline plasma ACTH level
with a concurrently low basal serum cortisol suggests primary AI. On the other
hand, secondary AI patients have low serum cortisol with a low or low-normal
baseline plasma ACTH level.
CRH Stimulation Test
The CRH stimulation test has utility for differentiating a pituitary from
hypothalamic etiology of AI.16
The plasma ACTH usually peaks at 15 to 30 minutes and cortisol value peaks 30
to 45 minutes following CRH administration in AI patients due to a hypothalamic,
but not pituitary, etiology.
CRH stimulation testing has limited usefulness due to its cost, availability, and
limited data.
Renin and Aldosterone Concentrations
Mineralocorticoids as well as glucocorticoids are usually affected in primary AI.
Aldosterone levels are typically low, associated with elevated rennin activity in
this setting.17
In secondary AI, the rennin–angiotensin–aldosterone system can function normally.
Autoantibodies
At the time of onset of clinically apparent autoimmune AI, adrenal antibodies are
121

detected in more than 90% of patients. The presence of autoantibodies will often
predate the onset of AI. 4 Abnormal antibodies are more common if there is
associated vitiligo or alopecia.
The presence of adrenal cortex antibody (ACA) and 21-hydroxylase
(CYP21A2) antibody is used to assist the diagnosis of autoimmune AI in clinical
practice. The presence of both antibodies makes the diagnosis likely up to 99%.18
A range of autoantibodies against other steroidogenic enzymes and other endocrine
cells such as 17-α-hydroxylase antibodies, P450 side-chain cleavage antibodies
and 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3-β HSD) antibodies are also present in
some patients.
Evaluation of other endocrine gland dysfunction associated with autoimmune
adrenal insufficiency may be sought by measuring serum calcium, islet cell
antibodies, TSH, and tests of gonadal function. Consideration should also be
made for vitamin B12 deficiency and autoimmune hepatitis or hemolytic anemia.
In boys who have isolated primary adrenal insufficiency and neurologic symptoms,
serum concentrations of very-long-chain fatty acids (>24 carbon chain length)
should be measured to exclude adrenoleukodystrophy.19
Imaging
Radiologic imaging should only be performed once laboratory diagnosis of
adrenal insufficiency is made. An exception to this role is a case in which a
patient is suspected of having a pituitary or hypothalamic tumor.20
MRI imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary region is superior to CT in most
situations connected with secondary AI. Analysis of sagittal and coronal sections
provides the most information.
CT should be obtained if bone invasion or calcifications in a craniopharyngioma
need to be demonstrated.
CT and MRI are often used to image the adrenal glands as well. In autoimmune
adrenalitis, imaging often reveals small or absent adrenal glands. Enlarged or
calcified adrenals may suggest an infectious, hemorrhagic or malignant diagnosis.
Diagnostic Procedure
CT-guided adrenal biopsy is not usually required except in the differential
diagnosis of AI in patients with a presentation suspicious for metastases, in whom
a known primary remains unidentified but pheochromocytoma has been
excluded.21
Adrenal biopsy may have additional diagnostic value in patient with other
122

infiltrative etiologies.

TREATMENT
Acute Treatment
Adrenal crisis is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate treatment.
Therapy should not be delayed to perform diagnostic studies or await laboratory
results.
If there is no history suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, other causes of shock also
need to be considered.
Volume replacement using normal saline is essential to reverse hypotension and
electrolyte abnormalities.
While blood for serum cortisol, ACTH, and serum chemistry is drawn, “stressdose” steroids should be started.
If the diagnosis is unclear, 4 mg IV dexamethasone (instead of hydrocortisone)
should be given first, followed by corticotropin stimulation testing.
In patients with a clearly identified history of adrenal insufficiency, either
dexamethasone (4 mg IV q12h) or hydrocortisone (50 to 100 mg IV q6–8h) can
be given until their condition has stabilized.
Once the stressor has been alleviated, steroid doses can be tapered over 1 to 3
days to an oral maintenance daily dose.
In the acute setting, mineralocorticoid replacement is not useful, as it takes several
days for its sodium-retaining effects to become apparent; intravenous saline alone
will suffice.
Any signs or symptoms of adrenal crisis should resolve quickly, generally over the
following 1 to 2 hours after glucocorticoid therapy.

Maintenance Treatment
Maintenance therapy involves glucocorticoid replacement at physiologic levels.
Many maintenance treatment regimens have been suggested.
Chronic therapy for patients with either primary or secondary adrenal
insufficiency requires glucocorticoid replacement with hydrocortisone 15 to
30 mg/day PO or its equivalent (prednisone 4.0 to 7.5 mg/day PO).
The glucocorticoids can be administered in 1 to 3 divided doses. It is generally
best to give a single dose in the morning to mimic the physiologic diurnal
variation. If the patient thinks he or she could benefit from a split-dose regimen,
123

usually the larger dose is given in the morning and the smaller dose later in the
day.
Treatment should be tailored (using the lowest dose possible) to the
patient’s symptoms so as to avoid fatigue, weight loss, hyponatremia, and, in
primary adrenal insufficiency, hyperpigmentation.
One should also avoid the complications of excess glucocorticoid
replacement, such as weight gain, osteoporosis, and immune compromise.
Treatment surveillance is mainly based on clinical grounds, taking into account
signs and symptoms potentially suggestive of over replacement or underreplacement. No laboratory assessment has proven to be reliable for monitoring
replacement quality.
Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency should also receive mineralocorticoid
replacement. Fludrocortisone is given at a dose of 0.05 to 0.2 mg PO daily, and
is titrated to the patient’s symptoms of orthostasis, blood pressure normalization,
normalization of potassium levels, and suppression of plasma renin activity to the
middle to upper end of the normal range.
Replacement of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has positive effects on
wellbeing and mood in some patients with both primary and secondary AI. 22,23
Recommended doses are 25 to 50 mg daily in the morning. However, there is still
lack of pharmaceutically controlled preparations and large-scale studies for
DHEA therapy.

Treatment for Specific Situations
Stress dosing
Supplementary glucocorticoid dosing should be based on the likelihood and
degree of adrenal suppression, the degree of medical or surgical stress, and the
cardiovascular and metabolic response to the therapy.
Patients and their families may be advised to increase the daily glucocorticoid
dose during febrile illness, upper respiratory infection, nausea, vomiting, or any
other undue physical stress.
In addition to aggressive hydration, the usual daily dose can initially be doubled
and then doubled again if symptoms of AI persist. An injectable dexamethasone
kit can be prescribed for home use. When the acute illness has resolved,
patients may return to their usual daily replacement doses within 1 to 3 days.
If at any time there is uncertainty regarding the status or safety of the patient, the
patient should be immediately brought to the nearest hospital for intravenous
steroids.
124

Perioperative dosing
During the perioperative and postsurgical period, inadequate steroid coverage
may be manifested by signs and symptoms of impending adrenal crisis such as
hypotension, nausea, vomiting, or fever.
Determining the appropriate coverage for surgical procedures is dependent on
the complexity and duration of the procedure.
For minor procedures with local anesthesia and most radiologic studies, the
patient’s usual daily dose should suffice. This should NOT be withheld
under any circumstances and if the patient is fasting a dose should be given
parenterally.
For moderate procedures involving general anesthesia, patients should
continue their usual daily steroid dose preoperatively and then receive
hydrocortisone 25 mg IV q8h intravenously during the procedure.
For major operations involving cardiothoracic or abdominal cavities,
patients should be given their baseline daily dose preoperatively and then
receive hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h during the procedure.
Glucocorticoid can usually be rapidly tapered to usual dose over 1 to 2
days.24
Secondary adrenal insufficiency.
There is no need for mineralocorticoid replacement. However, other pituitary
hormone deficiencies may need to be replaced.
Thyroid disease
If a patient is concurrently diagnosed with both adrenal insufficiency and
hypothyroidism, the patient must first receive adequate glucocorticoid
replacement before initiating thyroid hormone therapy to avoid precipitating
adrenal crisis.
In patients with adrenal insufficiency and unresolved hyperthyroidism,
glucocorticoid replacement should be doubled or tripled, since
hyperthyroidism increases cortisol clearance.2
Pregnancy
Increased cortisol-binding globulin, antimineralocorticoid action of increased
progesterone, and increased plasma renin activity are characteristic
physiologic changes that occur in the later stages of pregnancy.
Therefore, in the third trimester, glucocorticoid replacement doses may need to
be doubled. Fludrocortisone is adjusted according to blood pressure and serum
potassium level.
During labor, adequate normal saline hydration and hydrocortisone 25 mg IV
125

q6h should be administered. At the time of delivery, or if labor is prolonged,
hydrocortisone should be administered intravenously in a dose of 100 mg q6h
or as a continuous infusion.
After delivery, the dose can be tapered rapidly to maintenance within 2 to 3
days.2

PATIENT EDUCATION
All patients with adrenal insufficiency should obtain a medical-alert bracelet
indicating the diagnosis of steroid dependence, and a physician’s number to call.
In addition, every patient should have with them prefilled syringes of
dexamethasone (4 mg/mL in saline solution); the patient and one or more
responsible family or household members should be instructed on how to inject
the dexamethasone in case of emergency (e.g., massive blood loss, inability to
maintain oral intake, or presence of any of the symptoms of adrenal crisis).
Instruction should also include the need to be brought to medical attention
immediately in presence of symptoms of adrenal crisis.

Adult Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
Judit Dunai and Kim Carmichael
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) consists of a group of autosomal recessive
genetic disorders characterized by functional abnormalities of adrenal steroid
biosynthetic enzymes, leading to impaired cortisol biosynthesis, and a
compensatory increase in serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).1–3
High ACTH levels induce hyperplastic changes of the dysfunctional adrenal tissue
and increase production of virilizing steroids with little or no increase in cortisol
production.
Classic CAH is responsible for most cases of pseudohermaphroditism in females
and about 50% of all cases of ambiguous genitalia.
A spectrum of phenotypes is observed. A severe form with concurrent aldosterone
deficiency results in salt wasting, and a form with apparently normal aldosterone
biosynthesis leads to various degrees of virilization. Together, these are called
classic CAH. Milder, nonclassic forms that maybe asymptomatic are often
associated with postnatal androgen excess.1

Epidemiology
About 95% of cases result from 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
Five to eight percent of cases are due to 11-β-hydroxylase deficiency, which is
the second most common enzyme deficiency and is characterized by virilization
and low-renin hypertension. For details on this topic, please refer to an excellent
review by Nimkarn and New4 as discussion of CAH in this chapter is limited to
21-hydroxylase deficiency.
The incidence of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency is thought to be 1 per 14,000
births.
The carrier frequency is 1 in 60.
The majority of cases of classic CAH are discovered during childhood;
however, better understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of CAH has
129

led to frequent discoveries of its milder, nonclassic forms during adulthood.
The overall incidence of nonclassic CAH is not known but appears to be 0.1% to
0.2% in the general population. 11-β-hydroxylase deficiency occurs in 1 per
100,000 births.4

Etiology
Deficient cortisol production is the key aberration in CAH, and mastery of the
adrenal steroid biosynthesis pathway is essential to understanding the
pathogenesis of the disease and the rationale behind treatment (Fig. 12-1).
Differing mutations occurring in CYP21A2, the gene encoding 21-hydroxylase
(P450c21) affect the severity and expression of the disease.5
FIGURE 12-1 The adrenal steroid biosynthesis pathway.

Mutations associated with large reductions in enzyme activity result in severe
deficiencies of aldosterone and cortisol, whereas mutations associated with
milder reductions result in less severe hormone abnormalities and a nonclassic
course.
Some patients with nonclassic CAH have one allele of the 21-hydroxylase gene
with a “severe” mutation and one allele with a “mild” mutation. Thus, the severity
of the phenotype in compound heterozygotes is determined by the less severe
mutation.1
The reduction in cortisol levels stimulates ACTH release by the pituitary, in turn
causing increased production of cortisol precursors, such as progesterone and 17130

OH progesterone (17-OHP), which may be metabolized to androgen precursors
(see Fig. 12-1).

Classification
Three-fourths of patients with classic CAH are “salt wasters,” as they have no
21-hydroxylase activity and produce insufficient aldosterone to retain sodium.
The remaining one-fourth of patients, who produce low but detectable enzyme
activity, retain enough ability to produce aldosterone, and, although virilized, do
not sodium waste, and so are known as “simple virilizers.”
Those who retain 20% to 60% of enzymatic activity typically present in adulthood
with more subtle, nonclassic forms, and acute adrenal crisis is uncommon.3
Patients with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency are at high risk for development of
adrenal insufficiency without exogenous glucocorticoid administration.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents at birth or within several weeks of
birth with hypotension as a result of adrenal insufficiency.
Simple virilizing 21-hydoxylase deficiency is usually diagnosed shortly after
birth in females owing to external genital abnormalities (clitoral enlargement,
fusion of the labial folds, formation of urogenital sinus), but for boys the diagnosis
can be delayed for years until signs of androgen excess develop.
The symptoms of nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency may be subtle or even
absent. It can present at any age after birth usually with hyperandrogenic
symptoms such as cystic acne, hirsutism, infertility, and irregular menses. These
symptoms can wax and wane over time. Males with nonclassic CAH may
experience infertility and acne.
In children of both sexes, nonclassic CAH may be diagnosed during a work-up for
premature pubarche or accelerated linear growth with advanced bone age.
The differential diagnosis for nonclassic CAH in adults is limited but includes
polycystic ovarian syndrome, virilizing adrenal or ovarian tumors, and
exogenous anabolic steroid use.
Physical Examination
In nonclassic CAH females, hyperandrogenic features dominate the physical
examination. Hirsutism is the single most common symptom, followed by
131

oligomenorrhea and acne.1
Men might present with small testes compared to the phallus, oligospermia,
infertility, and short stature.
Final adult height may be reduced owing to premature closure of epiphyses due to
androgen excess.

Diagnostic Testing
Classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency is characterized by significantly elevated
levels of 17-OHP in infancy, with varying degrees of virilization that may not
become apparent until later in childhood.
Screening newborns for CAH minimizes delay in diagnosis and reduces morbidity
from adrenal crisis. A few nonclassic CAH cases are detected by newbornscreening, but most are missed because of borderline or normal 17-OHP.
Hormonal Evaluation
Early morning 17-OHP levels should be drawn during the follicular phase in
women. A 17-OHP of <200 ng/dL makes CAH unlikely, and a value >400
ng/dL has been reported to have 100% specificity and 90% sensitivity.6
The gold standard for hormonal diagnosis is the cosyntropin stimulation test,
which should be done for values between 200 ng/dL and 400 ng/dL.
250 mcg of synthetic ACTH is administered IV and plasma concentrations of
17-OHP is measured at baseline and at 60 minutes after the drug is given;
reference values for the local laboratory should be obtained. Patients with
non-classic CAH will usually have 17-OHP values >1000 ng/dL.1
Plasma cortisol is measured at baseline and at 30 minutes after stimulation.
If the post-ACTH cortisol level is <20 mcg/dL, the patient should be made
aware of the need to take additional glucocorticoids during times of
physiologic stress. Please see Chapter 11 for details on diagnosing adrenal
insufficiency.
Genotyping should only be done if cosyntropin stimulation results are equivocal
and for purposes of genetic counseling.7
First-degree family members of affected patients should be screened for CAH
because of the potential absence of clinical signs and potential harm that may
result if a patient does not receive therapy.

TREATMENT
132

Medical Therapy
The goal of therapy in CAH is to both correct the deficiency in cortisol secretion
and to suppress ACTH overproduction.
Therapy consists of a balance between sufficient glucocorticoid replacement to
suppress the overproduction of androgens and to prevent adrenal crises in classic
cases, while avoiding complications related to glucocorticoid excess.
Treatment for classic “salt-wasting” CAH is glucocorticoid and
mineralocorticoid replacement and sodium chloride supplementation.1
Treatment of adults with nonclassic21-hydroxylase deficiency should only be
undertaken for infertility or hyperandrogenism that is unacceptable to the patient.
There are no reports of death from adrenal insufficiency as a result of nonclassic
CAH in the medical literature; therefore, stress dose steroids are usually not
required unless subnormal cortisol response was demonstrated during cosyntropin
stimulation. See Chapter 11 for details on diagnosis and management of adrenal
insufficiency.
Hydrocortisone is the preferred treatment in children because of improved
clinical outcomes with respect to final adult height.
Typical dose is 10 to 15 mg/m2/day of hydrocortisone in two or three divided
doses.
After completion of linear growth, long-acting glucocorticoids are preferred.
Dexamethasone (Decadron) given in the evening (0.25 mg) is often considered
to be the most effective treatment in adults and can reduce hirsutism and
irregular menstruation within months.1
Aldosterone biosynthetic defect is clinically apparent only in the salt-wasting
form. However, subclinical aldosterone deficiency is present in all forms and
can be evaluated by the aldostetrone to plasma renin activity (PRA) ratio.
All patients with elevated PRA or decreased aldosterone to PRA ratio benefit
from mineralocorticoid therapy and adequate dietary sodium supplementation.1
Maintenance of sodium balance reduces vasopressin and ACTH levels,
allowing the use of lower glucocorticoid doses.
Sensitivity to mineralocorticoids may vary over time, and the need for
mineralocorticoid replacement should be reassessed periodically.

COMPLICATIONS
Unfortunately, treatment outcome in CAH is often suboptimal either due to
incomplete suppression of hyperandrogenism or, conversely, due to
133

overtreatment-induced hypercortisolism. Both of these can result in decreased
final adult height, 1.7 to 2.0 SD below the average in the normal population.2
Final adult height may be improved in children with advanced bone age, predicted
to be at least one standard deviation below midparental target height, with the use
of growth hormone and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists.8
For management of adrenal crisis in classic, salt-wasting CAH (see Chapter 11).

MONITORING
Monitoring the effects of steroid replacement is crucial. 17-OHP levels are
relatively resistant to suppression by glucocorticoids, and thus, a normal 17-OHP
level often represents overtreatment. Overtreatment can cause iatrogenic
Cushing’s syndrome and lead to reduced bone mineral density.
17-OHP levels should be maintained at the upper end of normal to mildly
supranormal levels. Androstenedione levels are more sensitive to suppression
and may be a better indicator of replacement dosing, with a goal of keeping the
androstenedione levels in the upper one-third of normal range.
Mineralocorticoid replacement may be monitored by following blood pressure and
potassium levels.
Elevated renin levels or hypotension may signify insufficient mineralocorticoid
replacement.
Adrenal imaging should be reserved only for those with an atypical clinical or
biochemical course. There is insufficient data to recommend routine screening for
adrenal masses.
Pregnancy in classic CAH should be managed by an endocrinologist experienced
in this area. Women with nonclassic CAH generally do not require glucocorticoid
therapy during pregnancy. Treatment of prenatal CAH is regarded as
experimental.1
Discussion of prenatal counseling, diagnosis, and treatment of CAH is beyond the
scope of this chapter, and the reader is referred to the following reviews.1,9,10

Conn’s Syndrome
Mariko Johnson and Thomas J. Baranski
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Primary aldosteronism, also known as Conn’s syndrome, is defined as
inappropriate (renin-independent) overproduction of aldosterone. Primary
aldosteronism must be distinguished from secondary aldosteronism, which is
appropriate (renin-dependent) increased production of aldosterone in response to
relative hypovolemia as is seen in renovascular hypertension and with diuretic
therapy.

Classification
Distinguishing between unilateral and bilateral disease is of utmost importance
because it determines therapy. Unilateral disease is confined to a single adrenal
gland and is usually treated with surgery. Bilateral disease is present in both adrenal
glands and is usually treated medically.

Epidemiology
The true prevalence of primary aldosteronism is not known. Older literature had
suggested a low prevalence of <1% in hypertensive patients. More recent literature
suggests a prevalence of up to 10% in hypertensive patients.1

Etiology
Primary aldosteronism can be caused by several adrenal disorders:
Aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA)
Adrenal gland hyperplasia (unilateral or bilateral)
Aldosterone-secreting adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC)
Aldosterone-secreting ovarian tumor
Familial hyperaldosteronism
136

Pathophysiology
Aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa and is synthesized and released in
response to renin-dependent production of angiotensin II. However, serum
potassium, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), dopamine, and atrial natriuretic
peptide (ANP) also affect its production and secretion. Aldosterone-induced sodium
retention and potassium wasting do not lead to generalized edema or profound
hypokalemia because of “aldosterone escape,” in which an increase in urinary
sodium and decrease in urinary potassium excretion counteract the acute effects of
excess aldosterone. This phenomenon is thought to be mediated by increased
secretion of ANP induced by hypervolemia, decreased abundance of the thiazidesensitive NaCl co-transporter, and pressure natriuresis.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The classic findings in primary aldosteronism are hypertension and hypokalemia.
However, it is now understood that the most common presentation of primary
aldosteronism is normokalemic hypertension. Hypertension is usually, but not
always, present2, but hypokalemia is present in less than half of confirmed cases.1,3
History
Symptoms related to hypokalemia, such as muscle weakness and cramping, can
occur. Other symptoms are nonspecific and may include headache, fatigue,
palpitations, and polyuria. A careful medication history is important, as many
antihypertensives can interfere with diagnostic testing, as can licorice ingestion or
use of chewing tobacco. A family history of early onset primary aldosteronism,
hypertension, or cerebrovascular events should raise suspicion for familial
hyperaldosteronism.
Physical Examination
There are no specific physical findings in primary aldosteronism, though
hypertension is present in the majority of cases.

Diagnostic Criteria
The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism is based on the demonstration of reninindependent overproduction of aldosterone.

Differential Diagnosis
137

Adrenal gland hyperplasia and aldosterone-secreting adenomas account for
the majority of cases of primary aldosteronism. Other causes are rare and
account for <3% of cases.
APAs account for approximately one-third of cases of primary aldosteronism.
They are seen on occasion in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.
Adrenal gland hyperplasia, also known as idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA),
accounts for approximately two-thirds of cases of primary aldosteronism and may
affect one or both adrenal glands.
Aldosterone-secreting ACC is rare, and only a subset of these tumors will secrete
aldosterone. These tumors often come to attention as a result of pain from local
invasion or cosecretion of cortisol and/or adrenal androgens, which lead to
symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome and/or virilization.
Aldosterone-secreting ovarian tumor as a cause of primary aldosteronism is
extremely rare.
Familial hyperaldosteronism
Familial hyperaldosteronism (FH) type 1, also called glucocorticoidremediable aldosteronism (GRA), is inherited in an autosomal-dominant
fashion and is usually associated with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. It is
caused by recombination between the promoter regions of 11-β-hydroxylase
(CYP11B1) and the coding regions of 18-hydroxylase (CYP11B2), such that in
the chimeric gene, ACTH (rather than renin or serum potassium) drives the
expression of aldosterone synthase and aldosterone production. In contrast to
most patients with primary aldosteronism who develop hypertension between
the third and fifth decades, GRA patients develop hypertension at birth or in
early childhood. Patients with GRA are usually normokalemic because their
aldosterone release has the same circadian pattern as that of ACTH, and,
therefore, aldosterone secretion is above normal for only part of the day.
However, these patients can develop marked hypokalemia when treated with
thiazide diuretics. Patients with GRA also tend to have an increased prevalence
of early cerebrovascular complications, especially hemorrhagic strokes from
ruptured intracerebral aneurysms.
Familial hyperaldosteronism type 2 is ACTH independent and leads to the
occurrence of APA, IHA, or both, in an autosomal-dominant pattern. Although
the exact genetic defect is unknown, a locus on chromosome 7p22 has been
implicated.

Diagnostic Testing
Diagnostic testing for primary aldosteronism aims to establish renin-independent
138

aldosterone excess and determines whether the source is unilateral or bilateral via
the three-step algorithm shown in Figure 13-1:
Screening for renin-independent aldosterone production
Confirmation of renin-independent aldosterone production
Localization of aldosterone production
FIGURE 13-1 Approach to the patient with suspected primary aldosteronism.

and treatment of patients with primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical
practice guideline. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2008;93(9):3266–3281.

Laboratories
Screening for renin-independent hyperaldosteronism is recommended in patient
groups with a relatively high prevalence, including patients with:
Moderate to severe hypertension (blood pressure >160–179/100–109 mm Hg)
Drug-resistant hypertension
Hypertension of any stage associated with spontaneous or diuretic-induced
hypokalemia
Hypertension associated with adrenal incidentaloma
139

Hypertension with a family history of early-onset hypertension or
cerebrovascular accident at an early age (<40 years)
Hypertension and a first-degree relative with primary aldosteronism4
Screening for GRA via PCR-based genetic testing should be considered in patients
with confirmed primary aldosteronism and any of the following:
Onset prior to 20 years of age
Family history of primary aldosteronism
Personal or family history of stroke prior to age 404
Clinicians should ensure that potassium is replete, sodium intake is liberalized,
and certain interfering substances are discontinued for at least 4 weeks before
proceeding with screening. Interfering medications include diuretics (particularly
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone) and products
derived from licorice root, such as chewing tobacco.
The two tests ordered for biochemical screening for primary
hyperaldosteronism are the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and the
plasma renin activity (PRA). The aldosterone renin ratio (ARR) can be
calculated from these two values and is equal to PAC/PRA. A PAC >20 ng/dL
and an ARR >30 (units are ng/dL per ng/mL/hour) used together have a 90%
sensitivity and specificity for primary hyperaldosteronism.5 Using these values
as screening cutoffs is reasonable, though they are not universally agreed upon.
Borderline results should be interpreted with caution; testing can be repeated if
interference from medications is suspected or patients can proceed directly to
confirmatory testing. Use of the ARR alone without consideration of the PAC
may be misleading. For example, a subset of patients with essential hypertension
may have elevated ratios by virtue of very low PRA without concomitant
elevation in PAC.
Many medications (particularly antihypertensives) can interfere with the PAC or
ARR but do not necessarily need to be discontinued before testing. However, the
results of testing should always be interpreted after taking into account potential
interference (see Table 13-1). For example, angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may raise the PRA
and lead to a false-negative result for the ARR in patients with primary
aldosteronism. However, an elevated ARR in the context of ACE inhibitor or
ARB treatment is highly suggestive of primary aldosteronism. If a false screening
result is suspected, interfering medications should be discontinued and
hydralazine, verapamil, or alpha adrenergic blockers such as doxazosin used to
control blood pressure. An interpretation of the possible combinations of PAC
140

and PRA can be found in Table 13-2.
Confirmation of renin-independent hyperaldosteronism is made by documenting
nonsuppression of aldosterone during sodium loading. Oral and intravenous
sodium loading tests are the most commonly used confirmatory tests. The
principle underlying testing is that an increase in intravascular volume should
decrease renin release and subsequent aldosterone production in patients without
primary aldosteronism. Sodium loading may lead to volume overload, especially
in patients with compromised left ventricular function or renal failure, and must
be closely monitored. Potassium should be adequately replaced prior to initiation
of either test.
TABLE 13-1 MEDICATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT SCREENING FOR
PRIMARY ALDOSTERONISM

Oral sodium loading test
The patient is instructed to consume 6 g/day of sodium, either from dietary
sources or sodium chloride tablets. Potassium must be measured daily and
replaced as needed, because sodium loading in patients with primary
aldosteronism leads to potassium wasting. A 24-hour urine collection is started
no sooner than the third day and assayed for urine aldosterone, sodium, and
creatinine. Urine aldosterone excretion >12 to 14 mcg per 24 hours confirms
nonsuppressibility of aldosterone. Adequacy of sodium loading is documented
by urinary excretion of sodium >200 mEq/day.4
TABLE 13-2 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR HYPERTENSION AND
HYPOKALEMIA

141

Intravenous sodium loading test
Two liters of normal saline are infused intravenously over 4 hours into the
recumbent patient. Potassium repletion should be confirmed before but does not
need to be monitored during saline infusion. A PAC >10 ng/dL at 4 hours
confirms and a PAC <5 ng/dL refutes the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. A
PAC between 5 ng/dL and 10 ng/dL is considered a “grey zone.”4
Alternate testsThe protocols for alternate tests including the fludrocortisone
suppression test and captopril challenge test are detailed elsewhere.4 The use
of the fludrocortisone suppression test is limited by the need for inpatient
admission for monitoring purposes. The captopril suppression test is an
acceptable but less standardized alternative if sodium loading is
contraindicated as in heart or renal failure.
Imaging and Diagnostic Procedures
Localization of aldosterone production is essential to direct therapy in patients
with primary aldosteronism who desire a surgical cure, because only patients with
unilateral disease are likely to derive benefit from surgery. As a rule, imaging is not
a reliable way to distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease but should be
performed to identify tumors likely to be malignant. Adrenal vein sampling (AVS)
remains the localization procedure of choice for patients seeking a surgical cure.
Adrenal imaging
A computed tomography (CT) of the adrenal glands should be performed to
identify adrenocortical carcinoma, which tends to be large (>4 cm) and has a
characteristic CT appearance. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study can be
substituted if CT is contraindicated. Imaging should not be used alone to localize
aldosterone production because it cannot reliably distinguish between a unilateral
142

and a bilateral source. For example, IHA and a nonfunctioning adrenal
incidentaloma may coexist. In these cases, a unilateral adrenal mass would be
detected on imaging, but the source of aldosterone excess would be bilateral.
Conversely, APAs may be too small to be detected by CT. In that situation, the
presence of “normal” adrenal glands might incorrectly imply a bilateral source of
aldosterone excess. Concordance between CT and AVS is only approximately
50%.6,7
Adrenal vein sampling
AVS is expensive, invasive, and technically difficult, but is 95% sensitive and
100% specific for detection of unilateral disease.6 Almost all patients will
require AVS to localize the source of aldosterone excess. Patients with GRA are
an exception to this rule since their disease is always bilateral. Some groups also
make an exception for patients younger than age 40 with a solitary unilateral
adenoma because nonfunctioning adenomas are less common in this age group.6,8
AVS involves catheterization of the bilateral adrenal veins. A continuous
cosyntropin infusion (50 mcg/hour) may be begun 30 minutes before
catheterization and continued throughout the procedure. The infusion stimulates
aldosterone production, thereby minimizing the effect of stress-induced
fluctuations on aldosterone production, avoiding the problem of sampling when an
APA might be hormonally silent, and maximizing the cortisol gradient between the
adrenal vein and vena cava, which is used to confirm successful placement of the
catheter. Blood samples from bilateral adrenal veins and a single peripheral vein
are then obtained for the measurement of plasma aldosterone and cortisol. Right
and left adrenal aldosterone concentrations should be divided by their respective
cortisol concentrations to correct for dilutional effects. The right and left cortisol
corrected aldosterone levels can then be compared. A lateralization ratio of more
than 4:1 is indicative of unilateral aldosterone excess. A ratio of <3:1 suggests a
bilateral source. A ratio between 3:1 and 4:1 is inconclusive. An
adrenal/peripheral vein cortisol ratio of 10:1 confirms successful adrenal vein
catheterization.
Other tests
Other ancillary tests can be used in cases where AVS is unsuccessful, though none
have been validated. As such, many clinicians avoid them altogether and instead
repeat AVS or decide between surgical and medical therapy on the basis of
clinical evidence or imaging. The postural stimulation test (in which a
paradoxical fall in PAC occurs from a supine 8 AM sample to a sample obtained
after 4 hours of upright posture in the presence of an APA) is used rarely. Adrenal
scintigraphy with a 131I-labeled cholesterol analog and measurement of plasma
18-hydroxycorticosterone levels are no longer used in most centers.
143

TREATMENT
Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for unilateral disease. Medical therapy
is the treatment of choice for bilateral disease or for patients with unilateral disease
who are poor surgical candidates.

Medications
Spironolactone (12.5–400 mg orally daily) is the primary mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonist used in the treatment of primary aldosteronism. Although
doses up to 400 mg daily have traditionally been used, recent guidelines suggest a
maximum dose of 100 mg.4 Spironolactone is rapidly effective in correcting
hypokalemia, but its antihypertensive effects may not be apparent for several
weeks. Antiandrogenic side effects, including gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction,
impotence, and decreased libido in men and menstrual irregularities in women,
limit its tolerability.
Eplerenone (25–50 mg orally twice daily) is a new highly selective
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist currently approved for treatment of
essential hypertension. It has 60% of the potency of spironolactone but has fewer
side effects due to its extremely low binding affinity for both the androgen and
progesterone receptors. The improved tolerability of eplerenone needs to be
weighed against its greater cost and the lack of clinical trials thus far supporting
its use in primary aldosteronism.
Amiloride (5–20 mg orally daily) and triamterene (100–150 mg orally twice
daily) are potassium-sparing diuretics that block the aldosterone-sensitive sodium
channel in the collecting tubules. They are less efficacious than the
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists but can be considered as adjunct therapy
or as monotherapy if other agents are poorly tolerated. Since these agents do not
block the aldosterone receptor itself, they do not prevent the deleterious effects of
aldosterone on the cardiovascular system. Side effects include dizziness, fatigue,
and nausea.
Dexamethasone (0.125 mg orally at bedtime, titrated as needed) and prednisone
(2.5 mg orally at bedtime, titrated as needed) are the glucocorticoids of choice in
the treatment of GRA and work by partially suppressing ACTH secretion by the
pituitary. They should not be used for treatment of primary aldosteronism due to
other causes. Dexamethasone and prednisone are preferable to hydrocortisone due
to their longer half lives and should be given at bedtime to suppress the early
morning ACTH surge. The lowest effective dose should be used to minimize risk
for iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome. Treatment with a glucocorticoid alone may not
144

be sufficient to normalize blood pressure and the addition of a mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonist may be required.
Other antihypertensive agents may need to be used in combination with a
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist if blood pressure remains uncontrolled.

Surgical Management
Laparoscopic total adrenalectomy performed by an experienced surgeon is the
treatment of choice for unilateral disease because it may eliminate the need for
antihypertensive medication, reduce the number of antihypertensives needed, and
correct endogenous aldosterone overproduction. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is
associated with shorter hospital stays and lower morbidity than an open approach.
Partial adrenalectomy should not be performed because AVS cannot determine
whether a single APA or unilateral hyperplasia is the cause of aldosterone excess.
Preoperative management goals are adequate blood pressure control and
correction of hypokalemia. Typically, an aldosterone receptor antagonist is
recommended prior to surgery.
Postoperative management can be guided by PAC, which should be measured to
confirm surgical cure shortly after surgery. Serum potassium should be followed,
as hypokalemia corrects quickly after adrenalectomy, and supplements should be
discontinued. Mineralocorticoid antagonists should be discontinued and other
antihypertensive therapy reduced as tolerated based on blood pressure. Maximum
improvement in blood pressure is usually achieved in the first 6 months after
surgery, but blood pressure can continue to fall for up to 1 year. 4 Since
aldosterone production in the remaining adrenal gland can initially be suppressed,
a sodium-rich diet and weekly monitoring of serum potassium levels are
recommended for the first month after surgery.

COMPLICATIONS
Studies have indicated that long-term exposure to aldosterone excess may lead to
structural damage of both the cardiovascular system9 and kidneys10,11 that is
independent of blood pressure. Patients with primary aldosteronism are not only at
increased risk for surrogate endpoints such as left ventricular hypertrophy12 and
diastolic dysfunction,13 but they are also at increased risk for hard cardiovascular
endpoints14 as compared to patients with essential hypertension. Aldosterone has
also been implicated in the development of endothelial dysfunction15 and arterial
stiffness.16 Glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin excretion are both higher
in patients with primary aldosteronism than in patients with essential hypertension,
and long-term follow-up of these patients suggests that these parameters are
145

reversible with appropriate treatment of the aldosterone excess.17

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Although blood pressure improves and serum potassium levels normalize in most
patients with surgically treated primary aldosteronism, the presence of preexisting
essential hypertension, end-organ damage, changes in vascular tone, or
nephrosclerosis may contribute to postoperative hypertension, which persists in
between 40% and 70% of patients despite complete correction of the
hyperaldo​steronism.18–20
Factors that predict an increased chance for surgical cure include the following:
presence of an APA, preoperative response to spironolactone, younger age (<44
years), shorter duration of hypertension (<5 years), preoperative use of fewer
antihypertensives (≤2 agents), higher preoperative ARR, and a family history of
hypertension in no more than one first-degree relative.19,20
Clinical trial evidence as to whether treatment of aldosterone excess in primary
aldosteronism reduces morbidity and/or mortality is not currently available.

Cushing’s Syndrome
Scott Goodwin and Julie Silverstein
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Cushing’s syndrome is a clinical condition resulting from prolonged exposure to
excessive glucocorticoids from either endogenous or exogenous sources.
The most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is from the administration of
exogenous glucocorticoids.

Classification
Cushing’s syndrome can be divided into two categories based on pathophysiology:
ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent (see Table 14-1).
ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism is the most common cause of endogenous
Cushing’s syndrome and may be due to an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor, an
ectopic ACTH syndrome, or an ectopic-corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)
syndrome.
When Cushing’s syndrome is secondary to an ACTH-secreting pituitary
adenoma, it is called Cushing’s disease, which was originally described by
Harvey Cushing in 1932.1 ACTH secretion from the pituitary adenoma
stimulates the over-production of glucocorticoids from the adrenal glands.
Ectopic-ACTH syndromes lead to bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia and
hyperfunction. Small cell carcinoma of the lung is the most common cause of
ectopic ACTH secretion.
In ectopic CRH syndrome, CRH secretion by the primary tumor causes
hyperplasia of pituitary corticotrophs, consequent hypersecretion of ACTH,
bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, and finally cortisol hypersecretion.2 It is
extremely rare.
ACTH-independent forms of Cushing’s syndrome are due to exogenous
glucocorticoids or primary adrenal disorders. Examples include adrenal
adenomas, carcinomas, and nodular adrenal hyperplasias.
148

Epidemiology
Cushing’s syndrome is exceedingly rare with an annual incidence of only 0.7 to 2.4
per million and is slightly more common in women than men.1

Associated Conditions
Carney’s complex is an autosomal-dominant syndrome characterized by
micronodular adrenal hyperplasia and pituitary adenomas, testicular and thyroid
tumors, cardiac atrial myxomas, pigmented lentigines, blue nevi, and
schwannomas.
McCune–Albright syndrome is characterized by hypercortisolism from
hyperplastic adrenal macronodules, as well as café-au-lait spots and polyostotic
fibrous dysplasia.2,3
TABLE 14-1 CAUSES OF CUSHING’S SYNDROME

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients present with a wide spectrum of manifestations ranging from subclinical
to overt symptoms, depending on the underlying etiology, and the duration and
149

intensity of excess glucocorticoid production.
The signs and symptoms of this syndrome are often nonspecific and there are
inherent limitations in the diagnostic testing, making the diagnosis of Cushing’s
syndrome one of the most challenging in endocrinology.
Some of the findings suggestive of Cushing’s syndrome are presented below (also
see Table 14-2). However, it is important to note that none of them are truly
pathognomonic of the syndrome, requiring a high degree of clinical suspicion to
diagnose Cushing’s syndrome.1,2
Progressive central obesity involving the abdomen, face, and neck (buffalo
hump, moon facies, supraclavicular fat pads, and exophthalmos from
retroorbital fat deposition).
Metabolic complications include glucose intolerance (owing to stimulation of
gluconeogenesis by cortisol and peripheral insulin resistance caused by
obesity), and hypertension (through poorly understood multifactorial
etiologies), both of which confer increased cardiovascular risk, a major cause
of morbidity and death in patients with Cushing’s syndrome.1 Severe
hypertension and hypokalemia are more commonly seen in patients with ectopic
ACTH syndrome because the very high serum cortisol levels overwhelm the
capacity of the 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme, which
oxidizes cortisol to inactive cortisone in renal tubules, thereby resulting in
activation of mineralocorticoid receptors.2
TABLE 14-2 SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS IN PATIENTS WITH CUSHING’S
SYNDROME

Dermatologic manifestations include skin atrophy (thinning of the stratum
150

corneum), fragile skin with easy bruisability, wide purple striae (due to the
stretching of fragile skin), cutaneous fungal infections, and hyperpigmentation
(in ectopic ACTH syndrome).
Reproductive changes include menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, oily facial
skin with acne, and other signs of virilization (temporal balding, deepening
voice), especially in women with adrenal carcinoma.
Musculoskeletal manifestations are proximal myopathy, muscle wasting
(resulting from the catabolic effects of excess glucocorticoid on skeletal
muscle), and osteoporosis (caused by decreased bone formation, increased
bone resorption, and decreased intestinal and renal calcium reabsorption).
Vertebral compression fractures, pathologic fractures of the rib or long bones,
and aseptic necrosis of the femoral heads may also be present.
Neuropsychiatric changes can include labile mood, agitated depression,
anxiety, panic attacks, mild paranoia, impaired short-term memory and
cognition, and insomnia.

Differential Diagnosis
Pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome is characterized by mild hypercortisolism and may
be difficult to distinguish from true Cushing’s syndrome.
Causes include depression, alcoholism, medications, obesity, psychiatric
illness, stress/trauma/acute illness, and states of elevated cortisol-binding
protein (pregnancy, estrogen therapy).4,5
The distinguishing feature of this disorder is that the laboratory and clinical
findings of hypercortisolism disappear if the primary process is successfully
treated.4,5
The metabolic syndrome which is characterized by central obesity, hypertension,
and glucose intolerance may mimic Cushing’s syndrome.
The polycystic ovarian syndrome may present with menstrual irregularities and
hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne) which can be features of Cushing’s syndrome.

Diagnostic Testing
The biochemical diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome involves three critical steps:
(1) Documenting the presence of hypercortisolism (Does the patient have
Cushing’s syndrome?)
(2) Determining if the cortisol excess is ACTH-independent or ACTH-dependent
(Does the patient have primary adrenal disease or an ACTH-secreting tumor?)
(3) Determining the source of the ACTH in the ACTH-dependent form (Does the
151

patient have Cushing’s disease or ectopic ACTH syndrome?)
Does the patient have Cushing’s syndrome?
The 24 hour urine free cortisol measurement is one of the most frequently
utilized tests for the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome. The patient can be
assumed to have Cushing’s syndrome if basal urinary cortisol excretion is 3 to
4 times higher than the normal range on at least two separate occasions. The
evaluation can then proceed to the next step of establishing the cause for the
hypercortisolism. If it is equivocally increased—that is, above the upper limit
of normal, but not quite 3 to 4 times as much—the patient needs to be
reevaluated after several weeks or undergo further testing (see subsequent text
and Table 14-3).6–8
The 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test is another commonly
used screening test. Unfortunately, this test is associated with a high falsepositive rate (Table 14-4) and it should not be used as the sole criterion for
making the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome. Some authors suggest obtaining a
dexamethasone level at the same time as cortisol. A low dexamethasone level
suggests noncompliance, individual variation in dexamethasone metabolism, or
drug effects on dexamethasone metabolism.6–8
Some endocrinologists prefer to use the 48 hour, 2 mg/day low-dose
dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) as a screening test in patients who
have conditions associated with overactivation of the HPA axis (e.g., in
patients with certain psychiatric conditions, obesity, alcoholism, or diabetes
meliitus) because in some studies it has been shown to have a higher specificity
than the 1 mg test.6
The late evening salivary cortisol is another validated screening test with
distinct advantages: it is noninvasive, saliva is easily collected, cortisol is
stable in saliva even at room temperature for several days, and it can be
performed by the patient at home.6,9
The CRH after-dexamethasone test may be useful to differentiate patients
with Cushing’s from those with pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome. Compared to
patients with Cushing’s syndrome, depressed patients continue to show a
suppressed plasma cortisol (<1.4 mcg/dL) even after CRH infusion, which
reflects preserved sensitivity of ACTH secretion to dexamethasone
suppression.6
Does the patient have ACTH-independent or ACTH-dependent Cushing’s
syndrome?
This question can be answered by measuring plasma ACTH levels and basal
152

serum cortisol.1,6
Undetectable or low levels of ACTH (<5 pg/dL) in a patient with a serum
cortisol concentration >15 mcg/dL characterizes a primary adrenal source
(ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome). If ACTH-independent Cushing’s
syndrome is suspected, thin-section computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) of the adrenal glands looking for an adrenal mass is
indicated.
ACTH levels >15 pg/dL typically indicate an ACTH-dependent cause, and the
next step involves a search for the source of the high ACTH (pituitary vs.
nonpituitary).

HYPERCORTISOLISM

BIOCHEMICAL TESTS FOR CUSHING’S SYNDROME

153

An ACTH level in the 5 to 15 pg/dL range is considered indeterminate and
should be repeated. If the ACTH level remains consistently in the indeterminate
range, a CRH-stimulation test can be performed. After CRH infusion, if the
peak ACTH response is blunted (<10 pg/dL), an ACTH-independent (adrenal)
cause is likely. However, if there is >50% increase in mean plasma cortisol
from baseline after CRH infusion, an ACTH-dependent cause is then more
likely.
Does the patient have Cushing’s disease or ectopic ACTH syndrome?
There can be considerable overlap in ACTH levels between patients with
Cushing’s disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome, but the distinction between the
two is critical as it significantly influences treatment. Several tests can be
utilized to aid in the differentiation between pituitary Cushing’s disease and
nonpituitary (ectopic) ACTH syndrome (see Table 14-5).
154

TABLE 14-5 TESTS TO DIFFERENTIATE CUSHING’S DISEASE FROM
ECTOPIC ACTH SYNDROME

The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST) takes advantage of
the fact that high doses of glucocorticoids partially suppress ACTH secretion
from most corticotroph pituitary adenomas whereas most non-pituitary tumors
155

associated with ectopic ACTH are resistant to feedback inhibition (exceptions
include carcinoid tumors of the bronchus, thymus, and pancreas). The high-dose
test can be administered as a standard 2-day test (2 mg, every 6 hours × 8
doses) or as a single overnight 8 mg dose (see Table 14-5). If the urine free
cortisol suppresses >90%, or the plasma cortisol suppresses >50% from
baseline, Cushing’s disease is most likely. An MRI of the pituitary gland should
be obtained next.1,6
Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) is an invasive procedure that involves
measuring the central-to-peripheral ACTH gradient and may be useful when the
source of ACTH production (i.e., pituitary vs. ectopic) remains elusive despite
other non-invasive testing (i.e., when there is cortisol suppression on HDDST
[suggesting Cushing’s disease] in the setting of a negative pituitary MRI). See
Table 14-5 for more details.1,2
111In-octreotide or pentetreotide scintigraphy can detect some ectopic
ACTH-secreting tumors, although neither is specific for ACTH-secreting
tumors.

TREATMENT
Treatment is based on the source of the hypercortisolism, so the need for an
accurate diagnosis cannot be overemphasized. The goal of treatment is to reverse
the clinical manifestations of hypercortisolemia by decreasing cortisol secretion
to normal levels.
In exogenous Cushing’s syndrome , gradual withdrawal of the glucocorticoid is
important because most patients on long-term therapy will have some degree of
HPA-axis suppression with resultant adrenal insufficiency if therapy is abruptly
discontinued.
In ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome , adrenal imaging by either CT or
MRI will demonstrate unilateral or bilateral disease. Patients should be referred
for adrenalectomy. During and after unilateral adrenalectomy, patients should
receive glucocorticoid replacement until the HPA axis recovers from the
prolonged suppressive effects of glucocorticoid excess. Patients with bilateral
adrenalectomy require lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
replacement.10,11
In Cushing’s disease, a transsphenoidal microadenectomy is the treatment of
choice for patients with a clearly circumscribed microadenoma. In other cases,
subtotal resection of the anterior pituitary may be performed. Patients with
incomplete resection of the tumor may undergo repeat surgery or pituitary
156

irradiation with either conventional radiation or stereotactic radiation with the 60
Co gamma knife. Pituitary irradiation may not control the hypercortisolemia for
months to years, and patients require medical therapy until the full effects of the
radiation are seen. Surgical cure with transsphenoidal adenomectomy can be
assessed on postoperative day 2 to 3 with morning cortisol and ACTH levels,
which are undetectable with successful complete resection of the tumor. During
and after transsphenoidal resection of the adenoma, patients require
glucocorticoid replacement until recovery of the HPA axis.11
Ectopic ACTH–dependent Cushing’s syndrome should be confirmed with
imaging studies, including CT, MRI, and/or scintigraphy. Tumors that can be
localized by imaging studies should be removed surgically. If the source is an
occult tumor or if there is metastatic disease, medical treatment is required.
Bilateral adrenalectomy may be performed in refractory cases.11

Medications1,10,11
Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that inhibits 17 to 20 lyase, 11-β-hydroxylase,
and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme. It is usually the first-line medication.
Its cortisol-reducing effects are dose-dependent and can be seen rapidly. The
major side effect is liver toxicity. Other side effects include gynecomastia,
impotence, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Doses range from 200 to 1200 mg
orally daily in 2 to 3 divided doses.
Mitotane inhibits cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and 11-β-hydroxylase.
Mitotane induces permanent destruction of adrenocortical cells and, therefore, can
be used to achieve medical adrenalectomy as an alternative to surgical
adrenalectomy. Glucocorticoid replacement is started at initiation of mitotane
treatment. Mineralocorticoid treatment may eventually be required. Side effects
are generally dose dependent and include gastrointestinal symptoms, weakness,
lethargy, leukopenia, gynecomastia, and hypercholesterolemia. Doses start at 0.5
grams orally at bedtime and are increased slowly to 2 to 3 g/day in 3 to 4 divided
doses for a total of 6 to 9 months.
Metyrapone inhibits 11-β-hydroxylase. Major side effects include increased
androgens, hypertension, and hypokalemia through increased 11deoxycorticosterone. Doses range from 250 to 1000 mg orally, given every 6
hours. Lower doses of 500 to 750 mg orally daily can be used when given in
combination with ketoconazole and/or aminoglutethimide.
Aminoglutethimide is an anticonvulsant that inhibits the cholesterol side-chain
cleavage enzyme. The usual dose is 250 mg 2 to 3 times a day. Side effects
include gastrointestinal upset, lethargy, ataxia, hypothyroidism, headache, bone
157

marrow suppression, and skin rash. It is not as effective for monotherapy as
ketoconazole or metyrapone, and thus is frequently used in combination with other
agents.
Other agents with limited or modest anti-corticosteroid capabilities include
Mifepristone (RU486), somatostatin receptor ligands (Octreotide, Lanreotide,
Pasireotide), Etomidate, and dopamine receptor agonists (Bromocriptine or
Cabergoline).

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Nelson’s syndrome can occur in patients with Cushing’s disease (pituitary
adenoma) who have refractory disease and are treated with bilateral
adrenalectomy. It results in enlargement of the pituitary and extreme elevations in
serum ACTH levels. The patient develops hyperpigmentation associated with the
high ACTH levels. Pituitary irradiation before bilateral adrenalectomy may
prevent this syndrome.11
There have been rare cases of Cushing’s syndrome during pregnancy. Pregnant
patients may be treated effectively with transsphenoidal surgery for Cushing’s
disease.12 Bilateral adrenalectomy may also be performed. Metyrapone and
aminoglutethimide may be used during pregnancy, but mitotane and ketoconazole,
which are teratogenic, are contraindicated.11

PROGNOSIS
Untreated Cushing’s syndrome is often fatal, with most deaths resulting from
cardiovascular/thromboembolic complications or bacterial/fungal infections.
Effective therapy, either by surgical cure or by pharmacologic control of
hypercortisolism, leads to gradual improvement in the symptoms and signs of
Cushing’s syndrome over a period of 2 to 12 months. Hypertension, glucose
intolerance, osteoporosis, and psychiatric symptoms generally improve but may
not resolve completely.2,13
Cure rates after transsphenoidal surgery for Cushing’s disease range from 80% to
90%, depending on the various criteria used to define a cure. Cure is likely if the
patient develops hypocortisolism in the first few days to weeks after surgery.
Postoperative random plasma cortisol levels of <2 mcg/dL have been used to
designate remission and a low recurrence rate of approximately 10% in 10
years.11 Remission is also achieved in an additional 45% to 80% of patients
undergoing pituitary irradiation after unsuccessful pituitary surgery. 11 Most
patients are rendered hypoadrenal for months to years after the procedure. During
158

this period, they require glucocorticoid replacement therapy.
The HPA axis must be evaluated 6 to 12 months after surgery to determine the
potential need for lifetime exogenous steroid replacement therapy. Patients with
panhypopituitarism subsequent to surgery require lifetime monitoring and titration
of hormone replacement therapy.11
Patients with adrenal adenomas and benign ACTH-secreting tumors that can be
completely resected can be cured. However, patients with ectopic ACTH
secretion or adrenocortical carcinoma may have a poor prognosis associated with
the underlying malignancy. These patients are rarely cured, but the
hypercortisolemia can be controlled with medications or bilateral
adrenalectomy.13

Pheochromocytoma
Prajesh M. Joshi and Simon J. Fisher
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pheochromocytoma refers to a tumor arising from catecholamine-producing
chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Similar catecholamine-producing tumors
that occur within sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia are classified as
extraadrenal paragangliomas.
Although adrenal and extraadrenal tumors can present in a similar fashion, it is
important to differentiate between them not only for anatomical and surgical
reasons, but also because they have distinct characteristics such as association
with malignancy and genetic predisposition to various syndromes.
The term pheochromocytoma comes from the Greek words phaios, meaning
“dusky,”
and chromo, meaning “color.” The first description of a
pheochromocytoma is credited to Frankel, who reported finding bilateral adrenal
tumors on autopsy in an 18-year-old woman in 1886.
For educational purposes, the “rule of tens” has historically been used to describe
pheochromocytoma as being 10% malignant, 10% extraadrenal, 10% familial, and
10% in children. However, with enhanced detection capabilities and genetic
screening, emerging evidence has made many changes to this “rule.”

Definition
Pheochromocytomas are neuroendocrine tumors arising from catecholamineproducing chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.1
Tumors arising from extraadrenal chromaffin tissue (sympathetic or
parasympathetic paraganglioma) are referred to as extraadrenal paragangliomas.2
Extraadrenal pheochromocytomas are most commonly located in the carotid body
of the head and neck, in the mediastinum (1%), close to the inferior vena cava and
abdominal aorta alongside the sympathetic ganglia, in the organ of Zuckerkandl
(7% to 10%), and near the urinary bladder.3,4

Classification
161

Pheochromocytomas can be classified into adrenal (90%) and extraadrenal tumors
(9% to 23%).5,6
Adrenal tumors are usually benign and secrete both epinephrine and
norepinephrine in at least half of all cases. Extraadrenal paragangliomas are
either sympathetic, which secrete norepinephrine and/or dopamine and have a
more aggressive, metastatic nature, or are parasympathetic, which are mostly
silent tumors.
Pheochromocytomas can also be classified as sporadic (solitary, unilateral, and
intraadrenal tumors) or familial (also typically intraadrenal, but often multicentric
and bilateral).

Epidemiology
The prevalence of pheochromocytoma in patients with hypertension is 0.1% to
0.6%7
Approximately 5% of all asymptomatic adrenal incidentalomas >1 cm in size are
pheochromocytomas.8
Most pheochromocytomas are sporadic, but up to 25% have been reported as
hereditary.
Its prevalence in MEN (multiple endocrine neoplasia) 2A syndrome presenting
with medullary thyroid cancer is approximately 42%.9
Prevalence of pheochromocytoma metastases is up to 5% in adrenal
pheochromocytoma. The rate of metastases increases to 33% for extraadrenal
tumors.

Etiology
Pheochromocytomas can occur in the context of autosomal dominant hereditary
syndromes. The hereditary basis for pheochromocytomas is more frequent than
previously thought, with an estimated prevalence of 24%.7
Germline mutations in various genes have been identified to be responsible for
familial pheochromocytomas: RET proto-oncogenes in MEN 2; tumor suppressor
genes such as VHL in von Hippel–Lindau syndrome and NF1 in von
Recklinghausen’s disease; and genes encoding the B and D subunits of
mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB and SDHD, respectively) in
familial nonsyndromic paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. Mutation of the
succinate dehydrogenase subunit C has only been reported in parasympathetic
paragangliomas thus far.10 More recently, germline mutation of FP/TMEM127 has
been associated with pheochromocytoma but not paraganglioma.11
162

Pathophysiology
Improved knowledge of catecholamine metabolism under normal and disease
states associated with elevated catecholamine release provides better
understanding of pheochromocytoma and the utility and limitations of biochemical
tests for its diagnosis.
Norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves acts locally and is metabolized
locally so that only a small proportion enters the bloodstream. In contrast,
adrenomedullary cells secrete catecholamines directly into the bloodstream.
Most of the norepinephrine produced and released by sympathetic nerves is
metabolized within the nerves by monoamine oxidase (MAO) to
dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG).
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in extraneuronal cells, such as smooth
muscle cells or liver cells, metabolizes norepinephrine to normetanephrine
(epinephrine to metanephrine), and DHPG formed in nerves is converted to 3methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG). Sympathetic nerves lack COMT.
Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), the major end product of norepinephrine and
epinephrine metabolism, is produced almost exclusively from metabolism by the
liver of circulating catecholamines and their metabolites. The majority of VMA is
derived from circulating DHPG and MHPG, most of which is derived from
neuronal norepinephrine metabolism, which explains why VMA is a relatively
insensitive marker for pheochromocytoma.
Approximately 90% of metanephrines and up to 40% of normetanephrines are
formed from metabolism of epinephrine and norepinephrine within the adrenals
before release into the circulation, making it the single largest source in the
body.12,13
Over 94% of elevated plasma normetaneprhines and metanephrines are derived
from metabolism of catecholamines by COMT within the tumor cells independent
of catecholamine release, which gives support to rationale for measuring
metanephrines and normetanephrines in diagnosing pheochromocytoma.14

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Patients with pheochromocytoma often experience a characteristic paroxysm or
crises caused by the release of catecholamines.
163

The classic symptomatic triad includes episodes of headache, sweating, and
palpitations.6 In the presence of hypertension, this triad is found to be 91%
sensitive and 94% specific for pheochromocytoma (Table 15-1).15
Hypertension is the most common feature and occurs in more than 90% of
patients and is paroxysmal in 25% to 50%.17
Headache may vary in duration and intensity and can occur in up to 80% to 90% of
symptomatic patients, with palpitations occurring in 64%.6 Generalized sweating
is present in up to 57% of patients. Other less frequent symptoms include
pallor, dyspnea, generalized weakness, blurry vision, panic attacks, weight loss,
polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, and unexplained cardiopulmonary dysfunction.
TABLE 15-1 SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS IN PATIENTS WITH
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA16

Patients with pheochromocytoma may also be completely asymptomatic. In a
Mayo Clinic series of 150 patients, ~10% of patients with a pheochromocytoma
were discovered incidentally on abdominal computerized technology (CT)
scanning. Another series from the Cleveland Clinic of 33 patients showed that
nearly 58% of patients diagnosed with adrenal pheochromocytoma were
asymptomatic and their adrenal tumors were an incidental finding on imaging done
for other reasons.18 Therefore, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma requires a high
164

index of suspicion, especially in patients with one or more of the following:
Refractory hypertension and/or onset of hypertension before 20 years of age;
Non-exertional palpitations, spells, diaphoresis, headache, or tremor;
Familial syndrome (e.g., MEN2, NF1, VHL) or a family history of
pheochromocytoma;
Incidental adrenal mass with imaging characteristics consistent with
pheochromocytoma (marked enhancement on contrast CT or high-signal
intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]);
Hypertensive response during anesthesia and surgery;
Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
Paroxysms associated with pheochromocytoma may be precipitated by
displacement of abdominal contents (e.g., lifting or palpation). Typically,
paroxysms last 30 to 40 minutes and occur with sufficient frequency for an event
to be observed within 1 to 2 days. Paroxysms tend to increase in frequency and
severity over time. Blood pressure can be elevated, often to alarming levels,
when measured during a paroxysm.
Several medications may precipitate a hypertensive crisis in the setting of
pheochromocytoma (Table 15-2). These drugs should be avoided until
pheochromocytoma has been excluded or resected or the patient has been
premedicated with a α-adrenergic antagonist.
Physical Examination
Hypertension is the most common physical examination finding in
pheochromocytoma. It is usually severe, refractory to conventional therapy, and
associated with signs of end-organ damage such as proteinuria or retinopathy;
however, it may also resemble essential hypertension in the absence of
paroxysms.
TABLE 15-2 DRUGS THAT MAY PRECIPITATE HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS
IN THE SETTING OF PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA

165

Rare presentations include episodic hypotension (when the tumor secretes only
epinephrine) or rapid cyclic fluctuations of blood pressure. (See Table 15-1 for
more symptoms and signs of pheochromocytoma.)

Diagnostic Criteria
Definitive diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is made by a biochemical evaluation
followed by anatomical and functional imaging to localize the tumor.

Differential Diagnosis7
Endocrine: hyperthyroidism, carcinoid, hypoglycemia, medullary thyroid
carcinoma, mastocytosis, menopausal symptoms
Cardiovascular: heart failure, arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, baroreflex
failure
Neurologic: migraine, stroke, meningioma, postural orthostatic tachycardia
syndrome (POTS)
Miscellaneous: porphyria, panic disorder or anxiety, use of sympathomimetic
drugs, MAO inhibitors, clonidine withdrawal, illicit drugs (i.e., cocaine).

Diagnostic Testing
There are two essential components to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma: (a)
biochemical confirmation, and subsequently (b) anatomic localization of the
tumor.
Laboratories
Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma requires biochemical evidence of excessive
catecholamine production by the tumor, which is achieved by measurements of
catecholamines and certain catecholamine metabolites in plasma or urine (see
166

Table 15-3).
TABLE 15-3 PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF BIOCHEMICAL
ASSAYS FOR PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA

The potentially fatal consequences of a missed diagnosis necessitate the need for a
laboratory test with high degree of sensitivity. Plasma free metanephrines and
urinary fractionated metanephrines have been shown to offer the highest
sensitivity for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, and the current consensus
statements from the First International Symposium on Pheochromocytoma
recommend measurements of plasma free metanephrines
or urinary
fractionated metanephrines, or both as the initial test.2 A summary of the
performance characteristics of the plasma and urine tests is presented in Table
15-3.
Dietary factors, drugs, or inappropriate sampling conditions can interfere with
biochemical testing (see Table 15-4).7 These confounders can be avoided by
fasting and abstaining from beverages containing caffeine (even partially
decaffeinated beverages) overnight before blood draws. Patients should also be
placed supine for at least 20 minutes before sampling to avoid false positive
results. Acetaminophen is known to interfere with analytic method during assaying
of plasma free metanephrines, hence its avoidance is recommended to avoid false
results.22 Tricyclic antidepressants and phenoxybenzamine are major causes of
false-positive results on urinary and plasma normetanephrine and
norepinephrine.23

167

TABLE 15-4 FACTORS INTERFERING WITH BIOCHEMICAL TESTING

The high degree of sensitivities of these biochemical tests means that negative test
results essentially rule out pheochromocytoma; however, a positive test does not
always reliably indicate presence of the disease. Most true positive results can be
distinguished from false positives by the magnitude of increases in test results
above the reference range. Rather than values slightly above normal, biochemical
parameters are typically elevated more than two- to threefold above normal when
a pheochromocytoma is present.
Although there is no consensus on whether plasma or urine measurements are
preferred, given 97% to 99% sensitivity, plasma metanephrines are the best initial
test in patients with high pretest probability of disease (MEN2, von HippelLindau syndrome, and previously surgically cured pheochromocytomas). Normal
plasma normetanephrine (NMN) and metanephrine (MN) levels essentially rule
168

out a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma except in patients with small and
microscopic tumors (<1 cm) and those with dopamine-secreting tumors.
However, given an 85% to 89% specificity, elevated plasma NMN and MN
levels, unless markedly increased (two- to threefold above normal), need to be
further confirmed with more specific tests such as 24-hour urine metanephrines
and catecholamines (98% specific).20
Before repeating the tests, careful consideration of the various causes of falsepositive results from medications and other factors is warranted (Table 15-4).
The much-improved biochemical assays for catecholamines and their metabolites
have made pharmacologic stimulation and suppression tests for
pheochromocytoma largely unnecessary. However, the clonidine suppression test
and glucagon stimulation test are occasionally helpful. The clonidine suppression
test may be useful when plasma catecholamines are elevated but nondiagnostic. A
decrease in plasma norepinephrine by >50% is the normal expected response to
clonidine suppression, whereas consistently elevated levels suggest
pheochromocytoma. False-positive results can occur in patients taking tricyclic
antidepressants or beta-blockers. A more than three fold rise in plasma
norepinephrine after administration of glucagon diagnoses pheochromocytoma
with high specificity, but the test has low sensitivity. Premedication with a αadrenergic blocker is necessary to limit the potential pressor response to
norepinephrine.23
Electrocardiography
Signs of left ventricular hypertrophy can be seen in EKG due to persistent
hypertension.
Imaging
Radiologic evaluation should be initiated only after catecholamine excess has
been confirmed biochemically. In situations of a high-pretest probability, less
compelling biochemical evidence might justify imaging studies.
Based on the First International Symposium on Pheochromocytoma, there was no
consensus on CT scan or MRI as the preferred imaging for initial localization of a
tumor.
Because ~95% of pheochromocytomas are intraabdominal, an abdominal CT or
MRI scan is usually obtained first.
CT has high sensitivity of 85% to 94% for detecting adrenal pheochromocytoma
(90% for extraadrenal, metastatic, or recurrent pheochromoccytoma) but a
specificity of only 29% to 50%. Following an unenhanced CT with contrast169

enhanced and delayed contrast-enhanced CT imaging for adrenal lesions improves
sensitivity to 98% and specificity to 92%.24 If the CT is negative in a
biochemically positive pheochromocytoma, the next step is MRI.
Pheochromocytomas usually appear round or oval, with clear margins, usually >3
cm in diameter with heterogeneous texture punctuated by cystic areas on imaging
studies. Due to their low lipid content, their unenhanced CT density is >10
Hounsfield units (HU) and the contrast washout is <50% at 10 minutes.25
Chemical shift MRI is used to differentiate adrenal masses based on
presence/absence of fat similar to the CT. The hypervascularity of
pheochromocytoma makes them appear characteristically bright, with a high
signal intensity on T2 sequences and no signal loss on opposed phase images.
MRI has high sensitivity in detecting adrenal diseases (93% to 100%), but its
specificity has been reported to be around 50%.26
Functional imaging should always be performed after anatomic imaging
(regardless of whether CT and MRI are positive or negative) to localize the
primary tumor and rule out multifocal tumors or metastases.
For many years, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) has been used for diagnostic
imaging in pheochromocytoma because of its resemblance to norepinephrine, with
123 I-MIBG being superior to 131 I-MIBG.27,28
An octreotide scan (111 In-octreotide) is insensitive (<30%) but may detect
tumors in unusual locations when MIBG scans are negative, especially metastatic
pheochromocytoma. Octreotide scans have been shown to be better than 123 IMIBG scan in detecting malignant/metastatic pheochromocytoma (87% vs. 57%
of lesion).
All rapidly metabolizing cells take up glucose, so imaging with FDG-PET is nonspecific for pheochromocytoma but may be good for localizing dedifferentiated
and/or rapidly growing pheochromocytoma tumors. Adrenal tumors associated
with a VHL gene mutation, extraadrenal paragangliomas, and metastatic
paragangliomas are best imaged by [18F] FDA PET.
Diagnostic Procedures
Genetic screening is currently recommended for patients diagnosed with
pheochromocytoma before age 50 years, bilateral adrenal tumors, multiple
paragangliomas, or who have a family history of pheochromocytoma or
paraganglioma.7

TREATMENT
170

Surgical resection is the definitive therapy for pheochromocytoma.29
Removing a pheochromocytoma is a high-risk surgical procedure, and an
experienced surgeon–anesthesiologist team is required. In addition, patients must
undergo appropriate medical preparation to control the effects of excessive
adrenergic stimulation and prevent intraoperative hypertensive crisis. An
endocrinologist or other physician experienced in the management of
pheochromocytoma should supervise preoperative therapy.
Pheochromocytomas have traditionally been resected through a transabdominal
approach. However, refinements in radiologic localization have permitted an
increase in laparoscopic resections through a flank incision, which is currently the
procedure of choice for patients with solitary intraadrenal pheochromocytomas.
Laparoscopic approach usually results in less intraoperative blood loss, shorter
operative time and length of hospital stay, and lower costs compared to open
adrenalectomy.
For intraadrenal sporadic pheochromocytoma, the entire gland should be removed.
Patients with familial pheochromocytomas (MEN2 or von Hippel–Lindau disease)
have a high incidence of bilateral disease and usually require bilateral
adrenalectomies. When bilateral adrenalectomy is planned, the patient should
receive perioperative “stress-dose” glucocorticoid coverage and appropriate
postoperative glucocorticoid management.

Preoperative Management
The main goal of preoperative management of a pheochromocytoma is to
normalize blood pressure, heart rate, and function of organs by restoring volume
and preventing surgery-induced catecholamine storm.
Without adequate preparation for surgery, perioperative mortality has been found
to be 30% to 45%.30,31
α-adrenergic antagonists, calcium channel blockers, or angiotensin receptor
blockers are recommended medications.30,31
No consensus exists regarding the exact time of preoperative adrenergic blockade.
In most medical centers, adrenergic blockade is usually started 7 to 14 days
preoperatively to have adequate time to normalize blood pressure and heart rate
and to expand the contracted blood volume.
α-Adrenergic Blockade
Phenoxybenzamine (α-adrenergic blocker) is the preferred drug for preoperative
preparation to control blood pressure.
171

Phenoxybenzamine is an irreversible, long-acting, nonspecific α-adrenergic
antagonist. A starting dose of 10 mg orally once or twice a day is titrated (in
divided doses to between 20 and 100 mg total daily dose) until the patient’s blood
pressure and symptoms are controlled.
Other α-adrenergic blockers such as prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin that are
short-acting and specific to the α-1-receptor have also been used in place of
phenoxybenzamine.
α-adrenergic blockade has shown to have significant impact on surgical outcome
with fewer perioperative complications.32
Volume expansion (e.g., with oral salt supplements or intravenous fluids) helps
minimize orthostatic hypotension associated with α-adrenergic blockade.
Tachycardia may develop during α-blockade and require treatment with a βblocker. However, β-blockers should not be started until after adequate αadrenergic blockade is achieved (usually 2 to 3 days later) to prevent a
paradoxical rise in blood pressure due to unopposed α-adrenergic receptor
stimulation.
Underlying cardiomyopathy (due to chronic catecholamine exposure) may also
become evident with the initiation of β-adrenergic blockade, resulting in acute
pulmonary edema. Therefore, when the β-blocker is administered, it should be
used cautiously and at a low dose (e.g., 10 mg of propranolol every 6 hours to
start), with the dose increased as necessary to control the tachycardia (goal heart
rate is 60 to 80 beats/minute).
Intraoperative hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias usually occur during
anesthesia induction, intubation, or tumor manipulation.
Acute hypertensive crises should be treated intravenously with sodium
nitroprusside, phentolamine, or nicardipine. Lidocaine or esmolol can be used for
cardiac arrhythmias.
After tumor resection, patients may experience mild hypotension, but severe
hypotension can be avoided with aggressive fluid replacement. Approximately
10% to 15% of patients may experience postoperative hypoglycemia that can be
managed by short-term infusion of glucose.
Other Agents
Preoperative treatment with a calcium channel blocker has also been
demonstrated as an effective medical preparation before surgery. Calcium channel
blockers can be used as supplements to α- and β-adrenergic blockade to achieve
blood pressure control or as an alternative therapy if adrenergic blockade causes
severe side effects.
172

Metyrosine (1 to 2 g orally daily), an agent that inhibits catecholamine
biosynthesis, may be added to phenoxybenzamine therapy, or used for patients
who cannot be treated with the typical α- and β-adrenergic blockade protocol
because of intolerance or cardiopulmonary reasons. Metyrosine is also useful for
long-term management of inoperable patients.

Perioperative Risk Factors
Risk factors for perioperative complications such as hypertension include high
norepinephrine production, large tumor size (>4 cm), high blood pressure at
presentation and after α-adrenergic blockade, and a more pronounced postural drop
in blood pressure after preoperative treatment.33

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Malignant Pheochromocytoma
Approximately 10% of all catecholamine-secreting tumors are malignant. Other
than local invasion or distant metastases, there are no distinctive histologic or
biochemical characteristics that differentiate benign from malignant
pheochromocytomas.7 However, recent studies have shown that patients harboring
a succinate dehydrogenase B mutation are more likely to develop malignant
disease. Tumors that are large (>5 cm) or have an extraadrenal location have a
higher risk for malignant disease.6
The most common sites of metastases are the bones, lungs, liver, and lymph nodes.
There remains no effective treatment for malignant pheochromocytoma. Although a
reduction in tumor size is palliative, a distinct survival advantage of debulking is
unproven. Reduced tumor burden can help with subsequent radiation therapy,
which may be useful for treatment of symptomatic bone metastases. 131 I-MIBG
therapy can be used as a therapeutic option if the tumor is shown to have MIBG
uptake. If there is no radionuclide uptake, then combination chemotherapy with
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine may result in tumor regression
and symptom relief in up to 50% of patients, but the responses are short-lived.10

Pregnancy
Pheochromocytoma is a rare but potentially lethal cause of hypertension during
pregnancy, with features similar to those in the general population. However, if
hypertension and proteinuria occur, pheochromocytoma may be difficult to
distinguish from preeclampsia.
Diagnosis is still made on the basis of elevated plasma and/or urinary fractionated
173

metanephrines and anatomic localization by MRI. Nuclear scintigraphy and
stimulation tests are considered unsafe during pregnancy.
Women should be prepared for surgery with phenoxybenzamine followed by βblockade as necessary for tachycardia. Although phenoxybenzamine is considered
to be safe for the fetus, it does cross the placenta and can cause perinatal
depression and transient hypotension.
If the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is made before 24 weeks of gestation,
surgical resection is usually performed. After 24 weeks of gestation, medical
management is continued until fetal maturation (as close to term as possible), at
which time combined cesarean delivery and tumor resection are performed.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Long-term follow-up is indicated in all patients, even in those apparently cured.
Catecholamines and metanephrines should be rechecked 1 week after surgery to
assess the adequacy of tumor resection by monitoring for a return to the laboratory
reference range. If the levels are normal and the patient remains asymptomatic,
biochemical screening should be performed annually for the next 5 years and
biannually thereafter. Biochemical testing should also be performed if symptoms
suspicious for pheochromocytoma recur.
Patients with familial tumor syndromes, bilateral tumors, or paragangliomas
should be monitored annually.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
In a large surgical series, overall perioperative mortality and morbidity rates were
2.4% and 24%, respectively. Surgical removal of a pheochromocytoma does not
always lead to long-term cure of pheochromocytoma or hypertension, even in
patients with a benign tumor. In one series, pheochromocytoma recurred as a
benign or malignant tumor in 14% of patients with an apparently benign tumor at
the time of surgical resection.
Hypertension-free survival in patients without recurrence was 74% at 5 years and
45% at 10 years. Survival does not appear to be affected by the site of the tumor.
Patients with malignant pheochromocytoma have a 5-year survival of ~40%.

Amenorrhea
Sara Chowdhury and Amy E. Riek
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The menstrual cycle is determined by interactions between the hypothalamicpituitary–ovarian (HPO) axis and the uterus.
At the level of the ovary, the menstrual cycle is divided into the follicular phase
and luteal phase. Growth of a dominant ovarian follicle and ovulation occurs
during the follicular phase. After ovulation, the luteal phase begins in which the
ovary secretes hormones that are needed for the embryo to implant in the uterus.
Disturbance of complex hormonal feedback loops at any level—the hypothalamus,
pituitary, ovary, or uterus—can lead to disruption of the normal menstrual cycle,
including cessation of menses.

Hypothalamic-Pituitary–Ovarian Axis
The hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which
stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland.
During the late luteal phase, GnRH is secreted in a slow pulsatile manner (pulses
every 90 to 120 minutes) by neurons with inherent rhythmic behavior, known as
the “pulse generator.” This favors FSH secretion. Subsequently, FSH stimulates
ovarian follicles to develop. The follicle with the most FSH receptors becomes
the dominant follicle. The maturing follicle secretes estradiol in response to FSH.
Estradiol production in the ovary occurs according to the two-cell theory, which
involves interaction between the theca and granulosa cells of the follicle. The
theca cells surrounding the follicles produce androgens, which are aromatized to
estradiol by neighboring granulosa cells. Increasing levels of estradiol provide
negative feedback to the pituitary to suppress FSH.
Estradiol is also involved in a positive feedback loop that increases the frequency
of GnRH pulses to every 60 minutes (during the follicular phase) and it acts
directly on the pituitary to stimulate LH secretion.
178

LH causes further increases in estradiol production by the ovary which is a factor
in increasing pituitary sensitivity to GnRH. This heightened sensitivity results in a
rapid rise in LH production, the LH surge, which stimulates ovulation. The LH
surge lasts approximately 50 hours. About 36 hours after the LH surge, ovulation
occurs and the oocyte is released from the dominant follicle at the surface of the
ovary.
Progesterone levels start increasing just before ovulation. After ovulation, the
theca and granulosa cells in the ruptured follicle differentiate and together form
the corpus luteum, which continues to secrete progesterone.
The exact mechanism that stops the LH surge is not known. However, it is
postulated that the increase in progesterone levels provides a negative feedback
loop to decrease GnRH pulsatility (every 3 to 5 hours), which inhibits further LH
secretion by the pituitary but favors FSH synthesis.
FSH stimulates estrogen production during the luteal phase, which occurs similar
to the two cell theory as described above. FSH has little influence on
progesterone production. Progesterone levels rise and peak around day 8 of the
luteal phase, which lasts about 14 days total.
In absence of pregnancy, the corpus luteum starts to regress (luteolysis). This
causes an abrupt decline in progesterone levels and also a decrease in estadiol
levels. The decrease in these hormones causes an increase in GnRH pulsatility,
which results in the start of another menstrual cycle.

The Uterus
Throughout the menstrual cycle, the endometrium responds to hormones secreted
from the ovaries.
Estrogens secreted during the follicular phase stimulate the proliferative phase of
the endometrium. The proliferative phase starts with menses and ends with
ovulation.
After ovulation, progesterone and estrogen secreted during the luteal phase
corresponds to the secretory phase of the endometrium. This phase promotes
several changes in the endometrium to prepare for implantation.
If there is no implantation of an embryo, the endometrium enters the degenerative
phase as a result of progesterone and estrogen decline during luteolysis. The
reduction of these hormones results in sloughing of the endometrium and the onset
of menses.
If implantation takes place, the embryo secretes human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG). This maintains progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum and is
179

essential for the continuation of pregnancy.

Physiology
Puberty is characterized by the onset of regular menstrual cycles and development
of secondary sexual features. The average time between the onset of thelarche
(breast development) and menarche (onset of menses) is 2 years.
The age of menarche is variable depending on genetic and socioeconomic factors.
The mean age of menarche in the United States is approximately 12.8 years. There
are differences in the age of menarche among racial groups.
An average adult menstrual cycle lasts approximately 28 days and usually has little
cycle variability between the ages of 20 and 40 years.
There is considerably more variation in a woman’s menstrual cycle for the first 5
to 7 years after menarche and for the last 10 years before menopause.
The mean age of menopause in the United States is 51 years, but may occur earlier
in smokers, nulliparity, or those with a family history of early menopause. It is
common in the preceding 2 to 8 years before menopause to have irregular menses
and breakthough bleeding, since the normal ovulatory cycle is interspersed with
anovulaory cycles of varying length. Cessation of menses before age 40 is
generally considered premature menopause.

Definitions
Amenorrhea is the absence of menses or abnormal cessation of menses. This can
be a temporary, intermittent, or a permanent condition.
Patients should be evaluated if they meet the following criteria1.
No menses by age 14 in the absence of growth or development of secondary
sexual characteristics.
No menses by age 16 regardless of the presence of secondary sexual
characteristics.
In previously menstruating women, the absence of menses for an interval of time
equal to three previous cycles or 6 months.
Oligomenorrhea is defined as <9 menstrual cycles a year.

Classification
Traditionally, amenorrhea has been classified as primary or secondary.
Primary amenorrhea describes patients who have never menstruated.
Secondary amenorrhea describes patients who previously menstruated, but
180

have subsequently stopped.
The classical distinction serves little practical purpose as the differential
diagnoses between the two are very similar. However, epidemiologic data are
presented below according to the traditional classification.
The new approach is to group causes of amenorrhea based on the level of
involvement in the regulatory system.1,2
Disorders of the genital outflow tract and uterus
Disorders of the ovary
Disorders of the pituitary
Disorders of the hypothalamus
Other endocrine causes

Epidemiology
The prevalence of amenorrhea not resulting from pregnancy, lactation, or menopause
is 3% to 4%.3

Etiology
There are several potential causes amenorrhea as listed in Table 16-1.
The most common causes of amenorrhea are polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS), hypothalamic amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemia, and ovarian failure.3
Women who do not menstruate within 3 months after the discontinuation of oral
contraceptives should be evaluated for amenorrhea.
The most common etiologies by the traditional classification of primary
amenorrhea are4
Chromosomal abnormalities causing gonadal dysgenesis (premature depletion
of all ovarian oocytes and follicles [50%])
Hypothalamic causes (20%)
Congenital anatomic lesions of reproductive organs (20%)
Pituitary causes (5%)
Other (5%)–-combination of enzyme deficiencies, receptor mutations,
polycystic ovary syndrome
Once pregnancy is excluded, the most common areas that are affected in the
traditional classification of secondary amenorrhea are3,5
Ovaries (40%)
Hypothalamus (35%)
181

Pituitary (19%)
Uterus (5%)
Other (1%)
TABLE 16-1 ETIOLOGIES OF AMENORRHEA

182

If patients are of typical age (>40 years) and/or with usual associated symptoms
(e.g., hot flashes, vaginal dryness), then physiologic menopause should be
considered.

Selected Disorders
Turner syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality caused by the absence of an X
chromosome (45,XO). Patients have normal development of the external female
genitalia, uterus, and fallopian tubes until puberty, at which time there is failure of
sexual maturation owing to lack of estrogen because the ovaries are replaced with
fibrous tissue.
Swyer’s syndrome (46,XY) is characterized by individuals with normal
karyotype, gonadal dysgenesis, and female genitalia. The most frequent gene
defect in these individuals is a mutation in the SRY gene (sex-determining region
of the Y chromosome). Since the frequency of gonadal tumors is high, gonads
should be removed at the time of diagnosis.
Müllerian agenesis, also known as vaginal agenesis, results in congenital absence
of a vagina and abnormal uterine development. Affected individuals are
phenotypically and genetically female. Physical findings are a shortened or absent
vagina and small masses resembling a rudimentary uterus or absence of a uterus.
This disorder is associated with urogenital abnormalities in 1/3 of patients, such
as horseshoe kidney, pelvic kidney, and unilateral renal agenesis.
Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) (also known as testicular feminization) is
characterized by a 46,XY karyotype. Patients appear as women and breast
development occurs during puberty form peripheral conversion of testostertone to
estradiol. The uterus, fallopian tubes, and the upper third of the vagina are absent.
It is caused by a defect in the androgen receptor that results in resistance to the
actions of testosterone. It presents similar to Müllerian agenesis, but patients with
complete AIS lack pubic hair. The testes can often be palpated in the labia or
inguinal region and should be surgically removed after puberty due to an
increased risk of malignancy.
Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is congential GnRH
deficiency that can be inherited or occur sporadically. If it is associated with
anosmia, Kallmann’s syndrome should be suspected. These disorders cause
amenorrhea owing to absence of GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus.
Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea excludes pathologic disease. It is marked
by abnormal GnRH secretion, resulting in low or low-normal levels of serum
FSH and LH, absent LH surge, anovulation, and a state of estrogen deficiency.
Three main causes are stress, exercise, or weight loss.
183

Hyperandrogenism from any source can lead to amenorrhea due to chronic
anovulation. These disorders include late-onset congential adrenal hyperplasia,
Cushing’s syndrome, PCOS (see Chapter 20), exogenous androgen use, or adrenal
tumors.
Premature ovarian failure (POF) is characterized by amenorrhea, estrogen
deficiency, and elevated FSH in patients younger than 40 years of age. Ovarian
function may fluctuate. Up to 40% of women with POF may have other
autoimmune endocrinopathies such as autoimmune thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes
mellitus, hypoparathyroidism, myasthenia gravis, and, very rarely, Addison’s
disease (see Chapter 36).
Hyperprolactinema can result from a prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor,
disruption of the pituitary stalk, medications, or increased thyrotropin-releasing
hormone release due to hypothyroidism. Prolactin is thought to suppress GnRH
secretion which leads to amenorrhea.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Important elements to obtain as part of the history include the following:
Age of menarche
Frequency and length of previous menstrual cycles
Sexual activity
Number of pregnancies and any complications
Family history of pubertal development, menarche, and menstrual history (e.g.,
constitutional delay of puberty)
Family history of genetic defects
Weight changes, dietary habits
Exercise regimen
Psychosocial stressors
Prescription medication or illicit drug use
Gynecologic surgery/instrumentation or infection
History of chemotherapy, central nervous system (CNS), or pelvic radiation
Symptoms of estrogen deficiency (e.g., hot flashes, vaginal dryness, decreased
libido)
184

Symptoms of endocrine diseases (e.g., hypothyroidism, galactorrhea)
Symptoms of mass effect (e.g., headache, visual disturbance)
History of anosmia (Kallmann’s syndrome)
Cyclic abdominal pain and breast changes (outflow obstruction or Müllerian
agenesis)
Physical Examination
It is important to include weight, height, breast examination, and pelvic
examination.
Review of the growth chart may indicate constitutional delay of growth and
puberty.
In cases of primary amenorrhea, assess Tanner stage and the presence or absence
of secondary sexual characteristics.
Short stature, webbed neck, and widely spaced nipples should raise suspicion of
Turner syndrome.
A blind or absent vagina with breast development suggests Müllerian agenesis,
transverse vaginal septum (pubic hair present), or AIS (minimal or no pubic hair).
Patients with hirsutism or male-pattern hair loss should have a free serum
testosterone level checked. Signs of virilization (deepening of the voice,
clitoromegaly, increased muscle mass) on physical examination should always
prompt further evaluation for an androgen-secreting tumor.
Central obesity, supraclavicular fat pads, easy bruising, skin thinning, proximal
muscle weakness, glucose intolerance, and hypertension should raise the
suspicion of Cushing’s syndrome.
Acanthosis nigricans is associated with insulin resistance, a feature of PCOS, and
HAIR-AN syndrome (hyperandrogenism insulin resistant acanthosis nigricans).

Diagnostic Testing
Figure 16-1 provides an algorithm for the diagnostic workup of amenorrhea,
listing the most common causes.
Work-up of secondary amenorrhea starts with a measurement of β-hCG to rule
out pregnancy.
Rule out pregnancy by checking b-hCG.
Other basic laboratory tests should include thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH), prolactin (PRL), and FSH. Serum estradiol levels can fluctuate
significantly in all disorders and must be interpreted with caution and based on
185

the clinical scenario.
Elevated FSH levels (hypergonadotropic amenorrhea ~ 40% of cases) suggests
an ovarian etiology and gonadal failure.6
In primary amenorrhea with the absence of secondary sexual characteristics,
a karyotype analysis should be performed to rule out a chromosomal
abnormality such as Turner syndrome (45,XO), POF (46,XX), or to assess
for the presence of an occult Y chromosome, which is associated with an
increased risk for gonadal tumors.
FIGURE 16-1 Diagnostic algorithm for amenorrhea.

In women under age 30 years with POF, a karyotype analysis should also be
performed to assess for mosaic Turner’s syndrome and other various
chromosomal abnormalites.3
Other causes for ovarian failure such as ovarian tumors, prior trauma, pelvic
radiation, and chemotherapy should be evaluated.
186

Normal FSH levels (normogonadotropic amenorrhea ~30% of cases)6
In primary amenorrhea, normal gonadotropins with evidence of estrogen
production (breast development) could point to anatomic defects (i.e.,
Müllerian agenesis, AIS) or outflow tract obstruction (i.e., imperforate
hymen, vaginal septum, cervical, or vaginal agenesis).
In primary amenorrhea, a pelvic ultrasound should be performed to confirm
the presence of a uterus and Müllerian structures. Absence of Müllerian
structures should prompt further evaluation with a karyotype analysis and
serum testosterone level.
In secondary amenorrhea, if there is a history of uterine infection or
instrumentation, the possibility of outflow obstruction (Asherman’s
syndrome) should be addressed (see progestin challenge test below).
Low or low-normal FSH levels (hypogonadotropic amenorrhea ~30% of
cases)6
Low gonadotropin levels point to a central etiology (hypothalamic or
pituitary pathology), and a cranial MRI is indicated in most cases to rule out
a hypothalamic or pituitary lesion before other etiologies are considered.
In primary amenorrhea, the most common cause is constitutional delay of
puberty (10% of cases). Other causes are hypothalamic or pituitary
disorders, idiopathic GnRH deficiency, Kallman’s syndrome, or functional
hypothalamic amenorrhea.
In secondary amenorrhea, the most common cause is functional hypothalamic
amenorrhea. Panhypopituitarism secondary to space-occupying lesions,
infiltrative diseases, pituitary apoplexy, previous surgery, or radiation are
other causes of hypogonadotropic amenorrhea with low estrogen production.
Elevated prolactin
Further evaluation and management for women with hyperprolactinemia is
discussed in Chapter 2.
Elevated or low TSH
Evaluation and treatment for patients with thyroid disorders is covered in
Chapters 8 and 9.
Assess uterine outflow tract obstruction is by performing a progestin challenge
test. The patient is prescribed medroxyprogesterone, 10 mg orally daily for 10
days and the presence of withdrawal bleeding rules out an outflow tract
obstruction.
Failure to respond to the progestin challenge with bleeding suggests either
inadequate estrogen production to support endometrial proliferation or outflow
187

tract obstruction.
To differentiate these possibilities, the challenge is repeated with a combination
of estrogen and progesterone (conjugated equine estrogen [Premarin] 1.25 mg
orally daily or estradiol 2 mg daily for 21 days followed by progesterone as
noted, or with progesterone added during days 12 to 21). Failure to bleed in
response to this combination regimen strongly suggests outflow obstruction and
should lead to anatomic investigation by hysterosalpingogram or hysteroscopy.
Unfortunately, withdrawal bleeding correlates poorly with estrogen status and
should be interpreted with caution. Up to 20% of women with estrogen
production and amenorrhea will have no withdrawal bleeding, thus a falsepositive result. Up to 40% to 50% of women with disorders causing low
estrogen production will have withdrawal bleeding, giving a false-negative
result.3
In the presence of hirsutism and other signs of androgen excess such as acne,
seborrhea, and alopecia, causes of hyperandrogenic anovulation should be
evaluated.
Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common cause of hyperandrogenic
anovulation, but it is a diagnosis of exclusion (see Chapter 20).
A 17-hydroxyprogesterone level should be measured to rule out nonclassic
congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH); 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most
common cause of nonclassic CAH (see Chapter 12).
Testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) should be
measured, and, if elevated (total testosterone, >200 ng/dL; DHEA-S, >600
mcg/dL), appropriate imaging should be ordered to evaluate for the presence of
an adrenal or ovarian tumor.
Cushing’s syndrome can be ruled out with a 1 mg overnight dexamethasone
suppression test or 24-hour urine free cortisol (see Chapter 14).

TREATMENT
Treatment of amenorrhea is directed at correcting the underlying etiology when
possible and, if desired by the patient, helping to achieve fertility. Another aim
is to prevent complications, such as osteoporosis.
Patients with primary amenorrhea should be counseled about the underlying
cause and their potential for achieving sexual maturation, induction of menses, and
reproduction. Induction of puberty should be pursued under the direction of a
specialist because the timing of menarche can greatly affect epiphyseal closure
and final adult height.
188

Patients with congenital anatomic abnormalities may require surgical
correction. Patients with Y chromosomal material and residual testes should have
their testes excised after puberty owing to the increased risk of testicular cancer
after age 25.7
Women with gonadal dysgenesis or failure can now carry a pregnancy on their
own with the use of donor oocytes and new assisted reproductive technologies.
For women with ovaries but no uterus, their own oocytes can be used and the
embryos can be transferred to a gestational carrier.
Ovulation and fertility can often be restored in patients with hypothalamic
amenorrhea through administration of pulsatile GnRH therapy. GnRH is
injected every 1 to 2 hours by a programmable pump to simulate endogenous
pulsatile GnRH secretion. Treatment with pulsatile GnRH achieves fertility in
~90% of women after six cycles and carries a low risk of multiple pregnancies.8
Patients with anovulation due to pituitary disease do not respond to GnRH
therapy and require therapy with exogenous gonadotropins if fertility is desired.
Pure recombinant FSH and LH can be used in an effort to achieve fertility, but this
should be done only under the direction of an experienced specialist. Patients
should be warned that the chances of having a multiple pregnancy with this
method are high.
Correcting the precipitating factors for functional hypothalamic disorders usually
restores the normal menstrual cycle. In patients with amenorrhea caused by eating
disorders or excessive exercise, a modest increase in caloric intake or decrease
in athletic training can restore regular menses.
Oral contraceptives may decrease bone turnover and preserve bone density.
Adequate calcium and vitamin D should also be recommended.
Patients with either hypothalamic or pituitary disease who do not desire fertility
and patients with secondary ovarian failure can simply be treated with hormone
replacement therapy until the age of menopause, at which time continuing hormone
replacement becomes controversial and will need to be addressed on an
individual basis.
Every woman should be counseled about the potential risks of hormone
replacement therapy such as increased incidence of stroke, thromboembolic
events, and breast cancer.
Smoking cessation should be advised before the initiation of oral contraceptive
agents because of the increased risk of deep venous thrombosis.
Specific therapy for PCOS is discussed in Chapter 20, and is aimed at controlling
hirsutism, resuming menstruation, achieving fertility, and avoiding long-term
189

sequelae of PCOS (glucose intolerance, endometrial hyperplasia, and possibly
cardiovascular complications).
Management for patients with hyperprolactinemia or prolactinoma is discussed in
Chapter 2.

Gynecomastia
Scott Goodwin and Simon J. Fisher
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Gynecomastia is a glandular enlargement of the male breast that is often
asymmetrical or unilateral and may be tender.1

Classification
Gynecomastia commonly occurs during the neonatal period, in puberty, with aging,
and as a side effect of several medications.
Gynecomastia can be divided into two large categories: physiologic or pathologic
gynecomastia.
Physiologic gynecomastia occurs in the presence of normal fluctuations in
hormonal levels observed at different ages. Treatment is typically not
necessary, as the gynecomastia often resolves spontaneously.
Transient gynecomastia occurs in 60% to 90% of newborns due to high levels
of circulating estrogen during pregnancy and typically regresses within 2 to 3
weeks after birth.1
Pubertal gynecomastia usually occurs in adolescents between the ages of 13
and 14 years, regresses within 18 months, and is uncommon after age 17.
Gynecomastia results from transient imbalance of estrogen–androgen levels
during puberty as estradiol concentrations rise to adult levels before
testosterone concentrations.1
Gynecomastia of aging can occur in otherwise healthy older males in their
50s to 80s and is related to decreased testosterone synthesis leading to a
relative increase in the estrogen-to-androgen ratio. Aging-associated
increased body fat also contributes to gynecomastia via increased adipose
tissue aromatization of testosterone to estradiol and of androstenedione to
estrone.1
Pathologic gynecomastia is due to a congenital or acquired disease causing an
191

imbalance of estrogen to androgen hormones in the circulation.
In contrast to women, estrogen is the only hormone that promotes breast
growth and development in men.
Fundamentally, the pathogenesis of gynecomastia results from an increase in
the estrogen-to-androgen ratio, which occurs via excessive estrogen
production, deficient androgen production, increased estrogen precursors
available for peripheral conversion, blockage of androgen receptors, and/or
increased binding of androgen to sex-hormone binding globulin.

Etiology
The common causes of gynecomastia are summarized in Table 17-1.
TABLE 17-1 CAUSES OF GYNECOMASTIA

Associated Conditions
Conditions that decrease the production and effect of androgens2:
In primary hypogonadism there is a deficiency in testosterone production that
leads to a compensatory increase in LH release and enhanced aromatization of
testosterone to estradiol, resulting in relative estrogen excess, thereby
producing gynecomastia.
Primary hypogonadism can be due to testicular disorders such as trauma,
192

infections, vascular insufficiency, infiltrative disorders, congenital
abnormalities (such as Klinefelter’s syndrome), or enzymatic defects in the
testosterone biosynthesis pathway.
Secondary hypogonadism can also be associated with gynecomastia, although
this is less common. In secondary hypogonadism, the pituitary gland fails to
produce LH, leading to decreased testosterone secretion, but the adrenal cortex
continues to produce estrogen precursors that are aromatized in extraglandular
tissues. The net effect is an estrogen–androgen imbalance, which can sometimes
lead to excess production of breast tissue.
In androgen insensitivity syndrome there is ineffective testosterone action due
to defects in or absence of intracellular androgen receptors in target tissues.
Therefore, genotypic male patients appear as phenotypic females with breasts
that resemble those of a normal woman.
Conditions that increase the production of estrogen2:
Certain tumors secrete estrogen, causing patients to develop gynecomastia.
Examples include Leydig and Sertoli cell tumors and feminizing adrenocortical
carcinomas.
Patients with true hermaphroditism may have gynecomastia due to increased
estrogen production from the ovarian component of their gonads.
Germ cell tumors of the testes or bronchogenic carcinomas can secrete human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which in turn stimulates Leydig cell aromatase
activity leading to increased conversion of androgen precursors to estrone and
estradiol, resulting in gynecomastia.
Drugs can cause gynecomastia via several mechanisms3 (Table 17-1):
Analogs of estrogen and gonadotropins directly increase estrogenic activity in
the plasma.
Antiandrogens, such as spironolactone (Aldactone), block androgen receptors,
thereby increasing the relative estrogen-to-androgen ratio.
Some drugs, such as alkylating agents and ketoconazole (Nizoral), suppress
testosterone biosynthesis leading to increases in the estrogen-to-androgen ratio.
Other drugs induce gynecomastia by as yet unidentified mechanisms.
Systemic illnesses have been associated with gynecomastia2:
Cirrhosis: roughly two-thirds of patients with cirrhosis have gynecomastia due
to increased production of androstenedione from the adrenals as well as
enhanced aromatization of androgens to estrone and estradiol.
End-stage kidney disease: as many as 50% of patients with end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis have gynecomastia as a result of Leydig cell
193

dysfunction, leading to decreased testosterone levels.
Gynecomastia has also been associated with malnutrition, refeeding syndrome,
and thyrotoxicosis.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
True gynecomastia is characterized by a symmetric ridge of glandular tissue, is
rubbery to firm in consistency, and contains a fibrous-like cord.
Pseudogynecomastia presents with no discrete mass.1
Key elements in the history include a detailed medication list, the timing of the
onset, presence of breast pain, and symptoms of systemic illnesses such as liver
disease, renal disease, or thyrotoxicosis.
Physical examination should focus on breast and testicular exams as well as an
assessment for virilization.

Differential Diagnosis
Gynecomastia is caused by excessive estrogen action or an increased estrogen-toandrogen ratio. True gynecomastia needs to be differentiated from breast cancer
and pseudogynecomastia.
Pseudogynecomastia occurs commonly in obese men and is characterized by
adipose tissue deposition without glandular proliferation.4
Male breast cancer is rare and is generally unilateral and eccentric in location
rather than symmetric to the nipple and may be associated with skin changes.5

Laboratory Evaluation
In the biochemical workup of gynecomastia, testosterone, estradiol, LH, prolactin,
TSH, and hCG levels are measured to differentiate among various etiologies.6
Interpretation of abnormal plasma LH and testosterone levels: an elevated LH
and low testosterone are seen in primary hypogonadism. If both LH and
testosterone levels are low, secondary hypogonadism is likely, provided prolactin
levels are normal. If prolactin is elevated in this setting, it implies that
hyperprolactinemia is the cause of the hypogonadism. An elevation of both LH
and testosterone levels characterizes androgen resistance in the presence of
normal thyroid function. Elevated LH and testosterone in the presence of a
suppressed TSH level suggests hyperthyroidism as a cause for the gynecomastia.
An elevated b-hCG level suggests an hCG-secreting neoplasm. Further evaluation
194

should include testicular ultrasound to rule out testicular germ-cell tumors. If the
patient has a normal testicular ultrasound, then a chest radiograph or abdominal
computed tomography (CT) scan is necessary to localize an extragonadal germ
cell tumor or bronchogenic carcinoma.
An elevated estradiol level should be investigated with testicular ultrasound to
rule out a Leydig or Sertoli cell tumor. If the ultrasound is normal, an adrenal CT
scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated to rule out an adrenal
neoplasm. Workup should include a 24-hour urinary 17-ketosteroids level, which
are elevated in adrenocortical carcinoma. If the adrenal imaging studies are
negative, workup should focus on causes of increased extraglandular aromatase
activity.
If none of the above workup is revealing, a diagnosis of idiopathic gynecomastia
may be entertained.

TREATMENT
The approach to treatment depends on the etiology of the gynecomastia. Depending
on the condition, appropriate treatments could include observation, surgery,
and/or medical therapy. When an underlying cause for gynecomastia is identified,
treatment of that condition typically resolves the gynecomastia.
If the patient is taking medications associated with gynecomastia, discontinuation
of the offending drugs is appropriate. Resultant symptomatic improvement
generally confirms the diagnosis of drug-induced gynecomastia.
A more conservative approach with periodic follow-up is appropriate if
gynecomastia is asymptomatic and discovered during routine examination in a
patient with no underlying disease and not taking medications associated with
gynecomastia.

Nonpharmacologic Therapy
Observation is the initial step for most peripubecent males and for most men after
stopping any potentially offending medications.

Medical Therapy
Medical therapy is most effective during the earlier phases of gynecomastia.
Medical therapy is usually reserved for men with severe painful gynecomastia
while surgery is being contemplated.
Several classes of medications have been studied, but none are currently approved
by the FDA for treatment of gynecomastia.
195

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as Tamoxifen 10 mg
orally twice a day or Raloxifene 60 mg daily, have been used and shown to be
effective for patients with painful gynecomastia.6,7 However, these medications
do not result in complete regression of breast tissue. Additionally, use of these
agents is associated with adverse side effects such as headache, nausea,
impotence, and loss of libido, and patients tend to relapse after the medication
has been discontinued.
Testosterone replacement is only useful in hypogonadal men. It has no utility in
eugonadal men and, in some cases, could actually worsen gynecomastia due to
aromatization of the additional testosterone to estradiol.

Surgical Management
Surgery is indicated if there is continued growth, tenderness, malignancy, cosmetic
problems, or severe psychological problems or if the underlying cause cannot be
corrected.8

Hirsutism
Mariko Johnson and Kim Carmichael
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hirsutism is the development of excessive androgen-dependent terminal body hair
in a male distribution in a woman.
True hirsutism needs to be differentiated from hypertrichosis, a condition in
which there is an increase in androgen-independent total body hair.

Epidemiology
Hirsutism affects 5% of women of reproductive age and is commonly accompanied
by other cutaneous manifestations such as acne and temporal hair loss.1

Etiology
Hirsutism is caused by increased androgen production by the ovaries or adrenal
glands or increased target-organ responsiveness to androgen.
Although it may be a normal variant of hair growth, hirsutism can also be the first
sign of a serious endocrine disorder.

Pathophysiology
Androgens are necessary for the growth of sexual hair and transform vellus hair
into terminal hair in sex-specific areas. Vellus hairs are fine, soft, and
nonpigmented. Terminal hairs are thick, coarse, and pigmented.
The growth cycles of terminal hairs are nonsynchronous and last approximately 4
months. Results of hormonal therapy for hirsutism may not be apparent for 6
months due to the long duration of the growth cycle.
The levels of circulating androgens do not always correlate with the extent of
hirsutism. Local conversion of testosterone to the more potent dihydrotestosterone
and variability in sensitivity of the hair follicle to androgen also affect hair
197

growth. Therefore, hirsutism can occur in the presence of normal circulating
androgen levels.

DIAGNOSIS
The clinician should keep in mind the following three goals in the approach to the
patient with hirsutism:
Determine the underlying etiology, excluding rare but serious conditions first.
Assess the degree of hirsutism in terms of objective measures and hirsutismrelated patient distress.
Assess reproductive goals, since hormonal treatment cannot be used in patients
seeking pregnancy.

Clinical Presentation
History
Most women with hirsutism have either the idiopathic form or polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS). However, it is very important to exclude rare but serious
causes of hirsutism such as androgen-secreting neoplasms or other underlying
endocrinopathies.
The following clinical features are suggestive of an ovarian or adrenal
neoplasm:
Virilization (voice deepening, increased muscle mass, clitoromegaly, breast
atrophy)
Late onset of symptoms (during or after the third decade of life)
Rapid progression of hirsutism
Significant elevations in levels of androgen
Hirsutism can be seen in serious endocrine disorders such as Cushing’s syndrome,
thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, severe insulin-resistance syndromes, or
acromegaly. However, all of these disorders usually present with other typical
disease-specific manifestations and are not a cause of isolated hirsutism.
Even if no symptoms of a serious endocrine disorder are elicited, a full history
including age of onset, distribution of hair growth, rapidity of progression, and
associated features such as acne or temporal balding should be sought.
A menstrual history is very important in the differential diagnosis of hirsutism.
The presence of irregular menses distinguishes PCOS from idiopathic hirsutism.
Irregular menses that are acquired with an onset after menarche may suggest one
198

of the less common endocrinopathies listed since irregular menses due to PCOS
usually present at menarche.
A weight history should also be elicited since gradual weight gain over time is
more consistent with and can worsen hirsutism due to PCOS, whereas rapid
weight gain may suggest Cushing’s syndrome.
Certain medications can cause hirsutism, including oral contraceptives containing
androgenic progestins, danazol, anabolic or androgenic steroids, and valproic
acid.
A fraction of women presenting with hirsutism will have nonclassic congenital
adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which may be suggested by ethnic background or
family history.
Clinicians should always assess the degree to which patients are distressed by
their hirsutism, since idiopathic hirsutism that does not cause patient distress
does not require treatment.
Clinicians should always discuss reproductive goals, since hormonal treatments
cannot be used in patients seeking pregnancy.
Physical Examination
Physical examination should include measurement of height, weight, and blood
pressure and calculation of body mass index.
An objective assessment of hair distribution and quality of hair should be
documented. A simple scoring scale can be used, such as the modified scale of
Ferriman and Gallwey in which a score of 0 to 4 is given for each of the nine
androgen-dependent sites (see Figure 18-1).
Skin should be examined for acne, seborrhea, temporal balding, acanthosis
nigricans, striae, abnormal thickness, or bruising.
Signs of virilization such as deepening of the voice, increased muscle mass, and
clitoromegaly should be carefully sought.
FIGURE 18-1 Modified Ferriman–Gallwey scale for assessing hirsutism. (Modified
from Hatch, et al. Hirsutism: Implications, etiology, and management. Am J Obstet
Gynecol 1981;140:815–830.)

199

Diagnostic Criteria
A Ferriman–Gallwey score ≥8 has traditionally defined hirsutism, since 95% of
white and black women of reproductive age have a score <8 (see Figure 18-1).
The Ferriman–Gallwey score has several limitations, the most important of which
are
“Normal” hair growth varies by ethnic group. Women of Mediterranean origin
tend to have more hair, whereas Asian women have less hair in androgendependent areas.
Previous cosmetic treatments may not allow for accurate assessment of hair
growth.
The scale does not reflect the degree of distress the hirsutism causes an
individual patient.
Therefore, clinicians should not be dogmatic in their approach and should instead
focus their effort on uncovering and treating serious disorders that cause
hirsutism. Once an underlying condition has been excluded, the clinician can focus
on the cosmetic concerns of the individual patient.

Differential Diagnosis
Causes of hirsutism are listed in Table 18-1 and fall into the following general
categories:
Polycystic ovary syndrome
200

PCOS is the most common cause of hyperandrogenism in women of reproductive
age. The criteria for diagnosis are menstrual irregularity and clinical or biochemical
evidence of hyperandrogenism. Hirsutism usually develops within the first several
years after menarche. Insulin resistance is thought to play a role in this disorder by
promoting ovarian hyperandrogenism. Insulin and androgens also decrease the sex
hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) concentration, thereby increasing the free
testosterone level. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of PCOS are
discussed in Chapter 20.
TABLE 18-1 CAUSES OF HIRSUTISM

Idiopathic hirsutism
Idiopathic hirsutism can be diagnosed when regular menses, normal serum
androgen levels, and no identifiable underlying disorder are present. It may
represent a mild form of PCOS, but the absence of irregular menses distinguishes
this disorder from PCOS.
Ovarian neoplasms
Androgen-secreting tumors of the ovary usually occur later in life and progress
rapidly. Sertoli–Leydig cell tumors, hilus-cell tumors, and granulosa-theca cell
tumors are a few examples.
201

Adrenal neoplasms
Adrenal neoplasms can secrete dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S),
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, cortisol (Cushing’s
syndrome), and in rare instances, testosterone.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
CAH usually presents at birth or in early infancy, but late-onset or nonclassic
forms of CAH present at puberty with hirsutism and menstrual irregularity. The
nonclassic form of CAH is usually due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency and results in
excessive production of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione.
Other causes
Certain medications, conditions associated with pregnancy, and other
endocrinopathies are rare causes of hirsutism (see Table 18-1).2

Diagnostic Testing
Patients with isolated mild hirsutism do not require testing for elevated androgen
levels.
Patients with moderate or severe hirsutism, or hirsutism of any degree associated
with symptoms compatible with PCOS or an androgen-secreting neoplasm, should
be evaluated for androgen excess. These symptoms include
Signs of virilization
Rapid progression of hirsutism
Menstrual irregularity
Acanthosis nigricans
Central obesity
Patients with features of an underlying endocrine disorder should be evaluated for
that disorder.
Laboratory Studies
Serum testosterone
Serum testosterone can be measured either as total or free testosterone and
provides the best overall estimate of androgen production in hirsute women. Free
testosterone, the biologically active form, is typically elevated in women with
androgen excess even when total levels are within the normal range. Therefore,
free testosterone is the most sensitive test for androgen excess, but reliability of
the assay (particularly radioimmunoassays) is variable. Testing for total
testosterone is widely available and better standardized. Serum total testosterone
is often >200 ng/dL in women with androgen-secreting tumors. 1 Patients with
202

PCOS or idiopathic hirsutism typically have normal or slightly elevated levels of
testosterone.
Serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
Measuring DHEA-S is indicated to rule out adrenal androgen excess when signs
of virilization are present or symptoms are abrupt in onset and rapidly
progressive. Women with androgen-secreting adrenal tumors typically have
DHEA-S levels >700 mcg/dL.1
Serum prolactin
Prolactin can be measured in women with hirsutism and irregular menstrual
cycles to rule out hyperprolactinemia.
Serum thyroid stimulating hormone
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) can be measured in women with hirsutism
and irregular menstrual cycles to rule out hypothyroidism.
Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone
Measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone is useful to differentiate between lateonset CAH and PCOS. Testing in women of Hispanic, Yugoslav, or Eastern
European Jewish origin may have a higher yield due to increased prevalence.
Because oral contraceptives and/or antiandrogens are the first-line treatments for
hirsutism due to late onset CAH and PCOS,3 formal diagnosis of late onset CAH
may not be necessary unless pregnancy is desired.
Screening tests for Cushing’s syndrome
Cushing’s syndrome and PCOS can present in a similar fashion with hirsutism,
irregular menses, and weight gain. Screening tests for Cushing’s syndrome include
the low dose dexamethasone suppression test, 24-hour urine collection for free
cortisol, or measurement of late-night salivary cortisol. For a full description of
these tests, see Chapter 14.
Other tests
Tests to rule out insulin resistance syndromes or acromegaly may also be
warranted in the appropriate clinical setting.
Imaging
Radiologic studies, such as pelvic ultrasound and abdominal CT and MRI, are
indicated only if a tumor is suspected.

TREATMENT
Treatment for hirsutism should focus first on identification of treatable underlying
disorders. For idiopathic hirsutism or hirsutism due to PCOS, an underlying
203

etiology is not yet well defined.
Patients may be treated systemically with medications and/or locally with direct
hair removal according to patient preference.
The response to pharmacologic therapy is slow, and a trial of at least 6 months
should be given before doses are changed or new medications are added.
None of the pharmacologic treatments for hirsutism result in permanent hair
removal, and hirsutism generally recurs with discontinuation of therapy.

Medications
Hormonal treatment for hirsutism should only be considered in women not
desiring pregnancy.
Oral contraceptives are the first-line medical therapy for hirsutism in most cases.
If response is inadequate after 6 months of treatment with oral contraceptives, an
antiandrogen can be added. Because of their teratogenic potential,
antiandrogens should never be used in premenopausal women unless
adequate contraceptive measures are used. Other agents are not considered
first-line agents for hirsutism.
Oral contraceptives
Combination estrogen–progestin oral contraceptives are the best first-line
agents in patients who do not desire pregnancy.
A preparation that contains ethinyl estradiol in conjunction with a progestin with
minimal androgenic activity (desogestrel or norgestimate) or antiandrogenic
activity (drosperinone) should be selected.
Oral contraceptives act to reduce hirsutism through a variety of mechanisms.
They cause a suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) release, leading to
decreased ovarian androgen production; an increase in SHBG levels, thereby
lowering the free testosterone level; and a mild reduction in adrenal androgen
production, and they slightly inhibit the binding of androgen to its receptor.
Antiandrogens
Spironolactone (100 to 200 mg orally daily) can decrease the effect of
androgens by blocking the androgen receptor. When used in combination with
an oral contraceptive, both androgen levels and action are decreased.
Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia, and a potassium level should be
checked after initiation of therapy and with dose titration. Menstrual
irregularity can be prevented by concomitant use of oral contraceptives.
Finasteride (5 mg orally daily) competitively inhibits 5-α-reductase and can
also be used to treat hirsutism by reducing dihydrotestosterone levels.
204

Flutamide is not FDA approved for treatment of hirsutism, and its use is limited
as it can cause hepatotoxicity.3 Topical antiandrogens are not currently
recommended due to inconclusive data regarding their efficacy. Cyproterone
acetate is an antiandrogen widely available worldwide but not currently
available in the United States.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists
GnRH agonists inhibit ovarian androgen production by inhibiting gonadotropins.
The ensuing estrogen deficiency can be treated with a combination estrogen–
progestin pill. The GnRH agonist–oral contraceptive combination is more
cumbersome, more expensive, and has not been shown to be more efficacious than
the antiandrogen–contraceptive combination. Therefore, it should only be used as
second-line therapy in cases of severe hirsutism, and bone density should be
monitored during treatment.3
Glucocorticoids
Glucocorticoids, which suppress adrenal androgen production, are no longer
considered a first-line treatment option for hirsutism due to nonclassical CAH,
as oral contraceptive pills and antiandrogens may be more efficacious and have
a better side effect profile.3
Glucocorticoids can be used as a second-line treatment for hirsutism in CAH
patients with a poor response to, intolerance of, or contraindication to oral
contraceptives and/or antiandrogens.3
Dexamethasone (0.2 to 0.5 mg) or prednisone (5 to 10 mg) should be taken at
bedtime to suppress the nocturnal surge of ACTH.
Insulin-lowering drugs
The benefits of the insulin-sensitizing drugs (metformin and the thiazolinediones)
in treating hirsutism are not well established and as such cannot be recommended
for treatment of idiopathic hirsutism.3 However, metformin is often prescribed to
treat the metabolic derangements of PCOS.
Other
Topical eflornithine applied twice daily can be used for treatment of facial
hirsutism.

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Nonpharmacologic treatment should be considered in all patients, either as the sole
treatment or as an adjunct to drug therapy. Weight loss should be encouraged in
overweight or obese women, as it can lower androgen levels and improve hirsutism.
Bleaching, waxing, shaving, depilatories, electrolysis, and laser treatment are all
205

ways of removing undesired hair. Electrolysis and laser treatment can be expensive,
time consuming, and painful but can have long-lasting effects.

PATIENT EDUCATION
Pharmacologic treatment for hirsutism can be expected to reduce, not eliminate,
terminal hair growth. Realistic goals of treatment should be explained to patients

Male Hypogonadism
Shunzhong Bao and Stephen J. Giddings
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Symptoms of male hypogonadism depend on the age of the patient at the onset
of disease.1 The production of an adequate amount of testosterone is necessary for
the development of external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics in
children and adolescents. In adults, androgen production is necessary for the
maintenance of lean body mass, bone mass, libido, sexual function, and
spermatogenesis.1–3 Men with a total testosterone level less than ~300 ng/dL often
develop symptoms and signs of hypogonadism that can have long-term clinical
effects.

Definition
Male hypogonadism is defined as the failure of the testes to produce
testosterone, sperm, or both.

Classification
Hypogonadism is classified as primary, secondary, and combined primary and
secondary hypogonadism.
Primary hypogonadism is caused by failure of the testis (hypergonadotropic
hypogonadism).
Secondary hypogonadism is caused by defects at the hypothalamic-pituitary level
(hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism).
The combined form, manifested by both testicular and hypothalamic-pituitary
defects, may occur with hemochromatosis, sickle cell disease, thalassemia,
glucocorticoid treatment, alcoholism, and DAX-1 mutations, and in older men.
Late-onset of hypogonadism is a distinct clinical syndrome associated with age,
which is characterized by symptoms of and a deficiency in serum testosterone
levels.4
Rarely, hypogonadism can be due to defects at the receptor level as seen in
207

androgen-resistance syndromes, which are characterized by resistance to the
effects of testosterone.

Epidemiology
Four to 5 million men in the United States have hypogonadism.
In longitudinal studies, as men advance in age, total testosterone declines. Serum
testosterone declines at ~1% to 2% a year after age 30. It is estimated that 30% to
40% of men older than 65 years of age, and 79% to 80% of men older than age 80
have hypogonadism.1,5,6

Etiology
Primary Hypogonadism
Developmental defects
Klinefelter’s syndrome is the most common congenital defect causing male
hypogonadism (1 in 1000 males). Clinical features include small, firm testis;
varying degrees of impaired sexual development; azoospermia; gynecomastia;
and elevated gonadotrophins. The underlying defect is the presence of an extra
X chromosome, 47, XXY being the most common. Diagnosis is confirmed by
karyotype analysis.7
The 46,XY/XO karyotype (mosaic for loss of Y chromosome) clinically
presents with a broad spectrum from Turner syndrome to mixed gonadal
dysgenesis (MGD), male pseudohermaphroditism (MPH), or phenotypically
normal male. The gonads vary from streak to normal testes. If both a streak
gonad and a dysgenetic testis (“mixed gonadal dysgenesis”) are found, there is
at least a 20% risk of developing gonadoblastoma. Therefore, gonadectomy
should be performed.8,9
Mutations in genes encoding testosterone synthesis and secretion can lead to a
decrease or absence of testeosterone secretion. This occurs in the first trimester
of pregancy, leading to incomplete virilization.
Acquired diseases
Mumps is the most common infection affecting the testis and may lead to
infertility and reduced testosterone levels.
Radiation affects both spermatogenesis and testosterone production. Impaired
testosterone production is caused by reduced blood flow to the testis. The
extent of damage to Leydig cells is directly related to the dose of radiation and
inversely related to age.10
208

Drugs such as ketoconazole (Nizoral), spironolactone (Aldactone), and
cyproterone interfere with testosterone synthesis. Enzyme-inducing drugs, such
as phenytoin (Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Carbatrol), can lower bioavailable
testosterone, raise SHBG and LH levels, and decrease metabolic clearance.
Ethanol ingestion reduces testosterone levels by inhibiting the synthesis of
testosterone and impairing the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Cyclophosphamide
and other alkylating agents can induce infertility. Spironolactone, cyproterone,
cimetidine, and omeprazole compete for the androgen receptor causing
gynecomastia and impotence.1,11
Systemic illnesses, such as renal failure (testicular failure, hyperprolactinemia),
liver failure (both testicular failure and inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary
axis), sickle cell disease, chronic illness, thyrotoxicosis, HIV, and immune
disorders can lead to hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism.
Secondary Hypogonadism
Congenital disorders
Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is a rare heterogeneous
disorder caused by isolated GnRH deficiency.
Affected individuals present in teenage years because of deficient sexual
maturation. They have a normal male phenotype at birth because maternal
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulates normal sexual
differentiation in the first trimester.
Affected individuals have impaired phallic development characterized by
microphallus at birth owing to lack of testosterone production in the final
trimester. Clinical features include delayed bone age (typically not beyond
11 to 12 years in males), osteopenia, eunuchoid body proportions,
gynecomastia, and delayed puberty. These patients have low testosterone and
LH levels.
Male patients with testes ≥4 cm have incomplete IHH, but those with testes
<4 cm have complete IHH. Gonadotropin and testosterone values cannot
differentiate between the two disorders.
IHH must be differentiated from delay of puberty, and the diagnosis cannot be
made until patients are >18 years of age. Pulsatile GnRH treatment induces
full pubertal development.
Karyotype analysis is not recommended unless multiple congenital anomalies
are present or if there is a suspicion of Prader–Willi syndrome (deletion of
15q11–q13). IHH has been associated with mutation in KAL1 (X-linked
recessive), GNRHR (autosomal recessive), and FGFR1 (autosomal
209

dominant).
Kallmann’s syndrome is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and
hyposmia with or without other nongonadal anomalies. Some patients with the
X-linked form have a deletion of the KAL1 gene located on short arm of the X
chromosome, which prevents migration of GnRH neurons to the brain from the
olfactory placode during embryogenesis. Patients may also have midfacial
clefting, renal agenesis, and neurologic abnormalities (deafness, cerebellar
dysfunction, mental retardation, eye abnormalities).11
Secondary hypogonadism can also occur in Laurence–Moon syndrome and
Bardet–Biedl syndrome.
Androgen receptor dysfunction causes incomplete virilization in 46XY males,
who have bilateral testes and normal testosterone production. The diagnosis
should be considered in girls with inguinal or labial masses, women with
primary amenorrhea, adolescent girls who become virilized and develop
clitoromegaly, adolescent boys who have persistent gynecomastia and fail to
undergo puberty, and adult males with undervirilization or infertility associated
with azoospermia or severe oligospermia.
In addition, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be caused by impaired
development of the pituitary gland. Mutations in the PROP1 gene result in
absence of several pituitary hormones, including growth hormone, thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, and gonadotropins. PROP1 encodes a
protein expressed in the embryonic pituitary necessary for function of POU1F1,
which codes for a pituitary transcription factor. HESX1 gene mutations result in
septooptic dysplasia, which may include poor development of the pituitary.12
Acquired disorders
Any disease that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by one of the following
mechanisms leads to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
Hypothalamus—impairs GnRH secretion.
Pituitary stalk—inhibits GnRH from reaching the pituitary gland.
Pituitary gland—directly impairs LH and FSH secretion.
Mass lesions of the pituitary or hypothalamus preferentially affect
gonadotropins. In many patients with space-occupying lesions,
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and TSH are unaffected. Gonadotropin
deficiency may result from a space-occupying lesion of the sella, either by
destroying the pituitary gland or by interrupting the nerve fibers that bring
GnRH to the hypophyseal circulation. Patients present with headaches, visual
disturbances, and variable manifestations of hypopituitarism.
210

ACTH-producing tumors can cause impotence, decreased libido, and
infertility. Testosterone levels are low, and GnRH-stimulated LH
concentrations are suppressed.
Prolactinoma affects pulsatile GnRH secretion, subsequently causing
hypogonadism. Men have low testosterone levels and attenuated pulsatile LH
secretion. Treatment with dopamine agonists can normalize prolactin levels and
restore sexual function.
Infiltrative diseases such as Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis and sarcoidosis may
involve the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, thereby causing hypogonadism.
Hemochromatosis can cause selective gonadotropin deficiency owing to
deposition of iron in the pituitary cells.
Leydig cell tumors and adrenal tumors produce estradiol, leading to
gynecomastia and gonadotropin deficiency. hCG secreted by choriocarcinoma
can increase estradiol levels and suppress gonadotropins.
Trauma severing the pituitary stalk, postinfectious lesions of the central
nervous system (CNS), vascular abnormalities of the CNS, critical illness,
chronic narcotic administration, exogenous steroids, brain irradiation, and
pituitary apoplexy are some other causes of secondary hypogonadism.
Traumatic brain injury may cause temporary or persistent pituitary hypofunction
of one or several axes (up to 68.5%).13,14 The most commonly affected is the
pituitary gonadal axis (up to 22.7% in some series). This is followed in
frequency by growth hormone deficiency (~18.2%) and ACTH and TSH (both
5% or less).15
Excessive exercise can cause hypothalamic hypogonadism in men similar to
exercise-induced hypothalamic amenorrhea in women. Serial measurement of
testosterone levels has been proposed as one means of screening for
overtraining syndromes in elite male athletes.
Chronic opiate use may also suppress the pituitary–gonadal axis and result in
profound suppression of testosterone. This effect may be ameliorated by
participation in substance abuse programs or by switching to buprenorphine.
Primary hypothyroidism can cause hyperprolactinemia and hypogonadism (due
to elevated thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH]).

Pathophysiology
The testis functions as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary–gonadal axis. A
hypothalamic pulse generator resides in the arcuate nucleus, which releases
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the hypothalamic-pituitary portal
211

system.
In response to these pulses of GnRH, the anterior pituitary secretes the
gonadotropins—follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)
—which in turn stimulate gonadal activity.
LH and FSH control testosterone production by Leydig cells and spermatozoa
production by seminiferous tubules. GnRH, LH, and FSH secretion is controlled
by negative feedback from the testis by testosterone and inhibin B. Testosterone is
the major product of Leydig cells. LH stimulates the testis in a pulsatile manner,
resulting from the pulsatile GnRH secretion by the hypothalamus. An adult testis
produces approximately 7 mg of testosterone daily. FSH is necessary for
seminiferous tubule growth. FSH and LH control seminiferous tubule production
of sperm. The action of LH is through local secretion of testosterone. Both FSH
and testosterone are required to stimulate spermatogenesis quantitatively.
LH secretion is negatively regulated by testosterone, estradiol, and
dihydrotestosterone (DHT). FSH is under the negative influence of inhibin B and
testosterone. They are stimulated in a pulsatile fashion by GnRH.
Sixty percent of testosterone is transported in plasma bound to sex hormone–
binding globulin (SHBG), 1% to 3% is free, and the remainder is bound to
albumin. Both free testosterone and albumin-bound testosterone are
bioavailable.16
Circulating SHBG levels (and, therefore, total testosterone) can be increased in
chronic hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, HIV infection, estrogen use, and anticonvulsant
use. Reduction in SHBG level is associated with aging, obesity, low-protein
states (nephrotic syndrome), hypothyroidism, hyperinsulinism, and glucocorticoid
use.17–20
Approximately 6% to 8% of testosterone is converted to more potent DHT by 5-αreductase in prostate, testis, liver, kidney, and skin. A small proportion (0.2%) of
testosterone is converted to estradiol by aromatase.
The actions of testosterone are the combined effects of testosterone, plus its active
androgenic (DHT) and estrogenic (estradiol) metabolites.1
The testosterone-receptor complex is responsible for gonadotropin regulation,
stimulation of spermatogenesis, and virilization of the Wolffian ducts, whereas the
DHT-receptor complex mediates virilization of the external genitalia during
embryogenesis and most of the virilization that occurs at male puberty. Estradiol
inhibits gonadotropin secretion and promotes epiphyseal maturation in the
adolescent male.
Hypogonadism may occur if the hypothalamic-pituitary–gonadal axis is interrupted
at any level.7
212

Primary hypogonadism results if the testis does not produce the amount of sex
steroid sufficient to suppress secretion of LH and FSH to normal levels.
Secondary hypogonadism may result from failure of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse
generator or from inability of the pituitary to respond with secretion of LH and/or
FSH.
Most commonly, secondary hypogonadism is observed as one aspect of multiple
pituitary hormone deficiencies resulting from malformations or lesions of the
pituitary that are acquired postnatally.

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is based on a thorough history, physical examination, and laboratory
data. The general scheme for assessment of hypogonadism is outlined in Figure
19-1.
Testosterone levels are high in the morning and reach nadir in the afternoon. The
magnitude of this diurnal rhythm decreases with age. In men 30 to 40 years old,
testosterone levels were 20% to 25% lower at 1600h than 0800h, compared to
10% difference in men 70 years old.21 Although diurnal variation is less, older
men who are thought to have low testosterone by virtue of an afternoon
measurement should be retested with a morning testosterone measurement.
Late-onset hypogonadism is a distinct entity. The diagnosis is still controversial
since testosterone levels naturally decline with age. There is no cut off of
testosterone level for diagnosis. Generally speaking, the diagnosis is made based
on total testosterone levels that are lower than the limit of young normal range in
context of symptoms or signs suggesting hypogonadism.2,22 There is a consensus
that patients with serum total testosterone levels below 230 ng/dL will usually
benefit from testosterone replacement.2,22

Clinical Presentation
Clinical features depend on whether the impairment involves spermatogenesis or
testosterone secretion, or both. It also depends on the time of onset of the defect.
Impaired spermatogenesis typically leads to reduced sperm count and testicular
size.

hormone; LH, luteinizing hormone; PRL, prolactin; TSH, thyroid-stimulating
hormone.

Reduced testosterone production during the first trimester of pregnancy leads to
partial virilization—ranging from severe deficiency causing posterior labial
fusion to mild deficiency resulting in hypospadias. Complete lack of testosterone
during this period results in female external genitalia (both clitoris and labia).
If the defect occurs during the third trimester, it leads to micropenis and
cryptorchidism.
If testosterone production is inhibited before puberty, males will fail to initiate
(average age 14) or complete puberty (completed in 3 to 4 years).
Postpubertal deficit leads to decreased libido, muscle mass, hair growth, energy,
mood, concentration, hematocrit, and bone mass. Decreased libido and fatigue are
most readily experienced, whereas other symptoms take years to manifest. Longstanding hypogonadism in males manifests with decreased facial hair growth
(female hair distribution) and development of fine wrinkles at the corners of the
mouth and eyes.
Hypogonadism has been associated with several comorbid conditions, including
metabolic syndrome, diabetes, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, and erectile
dysfunction.
Primary hypogonadism is more common than the secondary form and is more
likely to be associated with a decrease in sperm production than in a decrease in
testosterone production.
Primary hypogonadism is more likely to be associated with gynecomastia.
Supranormal serum FSH and LH levels stimulate testicular aromatase to increase
the conversion of testosterone to estradiol, resulting in elevated levels of estradiol
relative to testosterone.
History
214

History should include developmental milestones, with emphasis on sexual
development, current symptoms, and information pertaining to possible causes.
History of ambiguous genitalia; micropenis; cryptorchidism; failed or delayed
puberty; or decrease in libido, sexual function, and/or energy gives clues
regarding time of onset of the hypogonadism.
Inquiry should be made into the rapidity of onset and progression of the symptoms,
presence or absence of early morning erections, and changes in voice, muscle
strength, or hair growth.
Ask about history of headache, visual problems, symptoms suggestive of kidney or
liver disease, depression, thyroid disease, drug abuse, chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, and anosmia.
History of ethanol abuse, opiate abuse, history of brain trauma injury, and
medication history can yield important clues regarding the etiology of the disease.
Patients should also be screened for sleep apnea symptoms. It is unknown if
obstructive sleep apnea precedes testosterone deficiency or is a clinical
manifestation of it.
Inquire about history of other comorbid diseases such as metabolic syndrome,
diabetes, osteoporosis, bone fracture, and coronary artery disease.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination should be done to look for the presence of
eunuchoid proportions (a lower body segment [floor to pubis] that is more than 2
cm longer than upper body segment [pubis to crown], and an arm span that is more
than 5 cm longer than height), other developmental anomalies, visual problems,
abnormal hair distribution, and gynecomastia.1
Examination of the external genitalia should include measuring testicular size
(normal, 4 to 7 cm) and volume (normal, 15 to 30 mL) and Tanner stage for
adolescents. Consistency of the testicle should also be noted. Typically, firm
testes are associated with Klinefelter’s syndrome owing to hyalinization or
fibrosis. Small, rubbery testes are characteristically found in prepubertal males,
whereas postpubertal testicular atrophy results in a soft or mushy consistency.
Gynecomastia may be present, as may increased body fat and reduced muscle
mass.
Physical findings are not always present in adults, since some secondary sexual
characteristics, such as reduced muscle mass, may take years to develop. In such
instances, appropriate laboratory evaluation may be helpful.

Diagnostic Criteria
215

The history and physical examination will suggest hypogonadism and laboratory data
will reveal an unequivocal lower level of testosterone, usually <300 ng/dL. Further
categorization into a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or combined hypogonadism is
necessary. The diagnosis of late onset of hypogonadism is made in a similar manner.

Differential Diagnosis
Patients with other diseases may present with similar signs and symptoms. Patients
with headaches, visual problems, galactorrhea, papilledema, or optic disc pallor
should raise concern for a pituitary tumor. Malaise, fatigue, anorexia, and weight
loss are seen in hypopituitarism.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Initial laboratory evaluation should include (preferably morning between 8 AM
and 10 AM) testosterone, FSH, LH, and prolactin levels. Presence of low
testosterone with elevated FSH and LH denotes primary hypogonadism, whereas
low testosterone and low or normal FSH and LH levels indicate secondary
hypogonadism.
A man with total testosterone levels below 300 ng/dL is likely hypogonadal, but
levels need to be repeated. Levels between 200 and 400 ng/dL should be repeated
with measurement of free testosterone. Diurnal variations in the levels of
testosterone need to be considered when interpreting results. As men age, there
may be less diurnal variation, but sampling time may still be important in some
individuals. Thus, it is preferable to obtain an AM level after one low
testosterone level measurement.
Measuring free testosterone becomes important when an abnormality affecting
SHBG levels is suspected. Obesity may cause a decrease in sex hormone–binding
globulin, thereby causing a lowered total testosterone but normal free
testosterone.
Semen analysis is the best means of analyzing sperm count and is typically
ordered for men who desire fertility. It should be performed after 1 to 3 days of
sexual abstinence and examined within 2 hours of specimen collection. Sperm are
analyzed for number, motility, and morphology. Typically, normal semen analysis
parameters are >20 × 106 sperm per mL, >50% progressive motility, and >30%
normal morphology (lower limits are permissible for patients desiring artificial
reproductive technology). Abnormal results might be caused by recent fever,
trauma, or drug exposure that can transiently impair spermatogenesis.
216

Subnormal sperm count and supranormal serum FSH in the setting of normal serum
testosterone concentration and normal LH concentration indicate damage to
seminiferous tubules (resulting in loss of inhibin feedback on FSH secretion),
whereas testosterone production by Leydig cells remains normal.
If secondary hypogonadism is suspected, a prolactin level, TSH, free thyroxine
(T4), and cortisol (8 AM level or cosyntropin stimulation testing) should be
performed.
Other laboratory tests may be indicated if HIV, ESRD, hemochromatosis,
Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis, or sarcoidosis is suggested.
Imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated if a low testosterone level and
low LH or elevated prolactin level is found. If other pituitary hormones are
abnormal or if visual field abnormalities or other neurologic abnormalities are
present, an MRI of the pituitary gland must be ordered to rule out a lesion. If an MRI
is contraindicated, although of inferior quality, a head computed tomography (CT)
scan with and without contrast could be performed to visualize larger lesions.

TREATMENT
Medications
Testosterone should be administered only to men who are hypogonadal, as
evidenced by symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and a
distinctly subnormal serum testosterone concentration. Increasing the serum
testosterone in a man who has symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism but has
normal testosterone concentrations will typically not relieve those symptoms.
Treatment for both primary and secondary hypogonadism consists of replacing
testosterone. The following are initial dose and preparation recommendations.
Testosterone enanthate/cypionate intramuscular injections, 75 to 100 mg weekly
or 150 to 200 mg every 2 weeks
Testosterone gel (Androgel or Testim), 2.5 to 5 g applied topically to upper arm
or other covered area each day
Transdermal testosterone (Androderm), 5 mg patch daily
Scrotal patch, 6 mg patch daily (hair needs to shaved and adhesive may not last
24 hours)
Buccal tablet (Striant), 30 mg twice daily
Generally, the gels are the most costly, whereas patches and injectable esters are
217

the least expensive. The possibility of skin transfer of the gel to a female partner
or children in close contact is possible and needs to be avoided by washing
thoroughly before close contact.2

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Therapeutic lifestyle changes are also indicated in treating male hypogonadism. It
is still controversial if physical inactivity, alcohol, and smoking decrease
testosterone levels. However, physical inactivity leads to obesity, which
increases SHBG, while alcohol and smoking have detrimental effects on seminal
parameters.
Urgent surgical correction is needed if cryptorchidism is found.
A pituitary or hypothalamus mass might need surgical or radiation therapy or
medical therapy for prolactinoma.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Patients with secondary hypogonadism desiring fertility can be treated with
pulsatile GnRH or gonadotropins with hCG. Spermatogenesis can also be
stimulated by GnRH in men who have secondary hypogonadism from
hypothalamic disease. Replacement of GnRH in a physiologic manner will cause
secretion of LH and FSH, which in turn will stimulate the testes to produce
testosterone and sperm. hCG stimulates the testes to make testosterone and is
especially useful in stimulating both testosterone and sperm production. FSH is
typically not used, since it is extremely costly and LH and hCG alone can
stimulate spermatogenesis.2,23,24
Use of gonadotropins in conjunction with artificial reproductive technologies is
also a consideration.
Some experts also suggest considering short-term testosterone therapy as an
adjunctive therapy in HIV-infected men with low testosterone levels and weight
loss to promote weight maintenance and gains in lean body mass and muscle
strength,2 or for hypogonadal men receiving high doses of glucocorticoids to
promote preservation of lean body mass and bone mineral density.2

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Serum testosterone measurements are helpful to assess the adequacy of treatment
and should be checked 2 to 3 months after initiating treatment. They should be
measured midway between injections in patients receiving injectable testosterone.
The dosage should be adjusted to maintain total testosterone levels in the mid218

normal range (400 to 700 ng/dL). In patients treated with a testosterone patch,
levels should be checked 3 to 12 hours after application. With use of the gel or
buccal tablets, serum levels of testosterone can be measured at any time and
should be in the mid- or low-normal range.
In postpubertal men, it is reasonable to treat with the minimum amount of
testosterone that alleviates symptoms of decreased libido, impaired sexual
function, and energy levels.
In primary hypogonadism, normalization of serum LH can be used as a surrogate
marker to determine the adequacy of therapy.
Assessment of effectiveness is very reasonable after 3 months of treatment. If there
is no improvement in symptoms and signs, the treatment should be terminated.
Assessment of bone density at 2-year intervals is advised in hypogonadal men
and serum testosterone measurements should be obtained in all men with less than
normal bone mineral density.12
Transdermal testosterone patches can be associated with skin rash and itching and
may require application of corticosteroid cream. Men treated with testosterone
injections will have wide swings of plasma testosterone levels and can develop
emotional and physiologic effects. These include breast tenderness, hyperactivity
at peak levels, and at the nadir fatigue, depression, or anger. Thus, it is advisable
to start at lower doses, especially in older men, and then titrate upward to reduce
mood fluctuations. Buccal preparations can cause gingival irritation, taste
perversion, and bitter taste.
Patients receiving testosterone should be monitored for potential side effects,
including benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, erythrocytosis, and the
development or worsening of sleep apnea. Other minor effects are acne/oily skin
and reduced sperm production/infertility.
Digital rectal examination (DRE) and measurement of prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) should be performed in all men 50 years or older before initiation
of testosterone therapy and at 3 to 6 months, and then annually thereafter. African
Americans and any man with a history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative
should be monitored after age 40. Some experts recommend that patients should
be promptly referred for a prostate biopsy if a nodule is palpated by DRE or if the
PSA is elevated >1.4 ng/mL and PSA increasing at a rate >0.4 ng/dL/year.
Discontinuation of therapy may be warranted.21 However, the use of PSA as a
screening and following up for prostate cancer is still very controversial. The
benefits and risks should be thoroughly discussed with patients.
The hemoglobin and hematocrit should be monitored after 3 to 6 months and then
219

yearly to screen for the development of erythrocytosis. If the hemotocrit increases
to above 54%, testosterone replacement needs to be held until the hematocrit
decreases to a safe level. The patient may need to be further evaluated for hypoxia
and sleep apnea.2
Obstructive sleep apnea may worsen. Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea such
as daytime drowsiness or witnessed apnea should be evaluated at each visit.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Normalizing testosterone levels typically leads to improvement in symptoms and
normal virilization in men in 3 to 6 months.
Dramatic improvements in muscle mass and bone density may be seen in the first
year of treatment.
Typically, by 24 months, men with osteopenia/osteoporosis reach and maintain
normal bone mineral density.
Increases in lean body mass, prostate volume, erythropoiesis, energy, and sexual
function occur within the first 6 months.
Ten percent of patients with IHH (including Kallmann syndrome), previously
thought to require lifelong therapy, were found to have sustained remission of IHH
after discontinuation of hormonal therapy. Therefore, it is reasonable to try brief
discontinuation of hormonal therapy to assess reversibility of hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism after full virilization is achieved.25
A 30-year retrospective study from Japan showed long-term administration of
hCG/ hMG for 12 to 240 months (average 56 +/– 11) resulted in sperm production
in 71% of the large testes subjects (testis volume >4 mL), but only in 36% of the
small testes subjects (testis volume <4 mL).26

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Nadia Khoury and Janet B. McGill
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was first described in 1935 by Stein and
Leventhal as a syndrome of signs and symptoms including amenorrhea, hirsutism,
enlarged ovaries, and obesity. 1 It is also commonly associated with
hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia.
PCOS is a heterogeneous disorder with manifestations that vary from person to
person. It has a large impact on fertility, morbidity, and mortality. Its pathogenesis
has not been clearly established.

Epidemiology
PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age,
affecting between 4% and 12% of women.2 In women with type 2 diabetes, the
prevalence is higher, up to 27%.3

Pathophysiology
The etiology of PCOS remains unknown. A prominent feature of the syndrome is
that reproductive (hyperandrogenism, anovulation) and metabolic (insulin
resistance, obesity) disorders coexist in varying degrees.
Women with PCOS have increased lutenizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency and
amplitude, which is likely due to accelerated GnRH pulse frequency from the
hypothalamus. Increased LH pulse frequency favors earlier differentiation of
granulosa cells, disordered follicular development, and increased androgen
production by theca cells in the ovary, leading to persistence of
hyperandrogenemia, normal to low estradiol levels but elevated estrone levels.
Elevated androgens in combination with low progestin levels due to multiple
anovulatory cycles feed back to the hypothalamus to further accelerate GnRH
pulse frequency, creating a vicious cycle.4
Androgen synthesis in the theca cells is augmented by upregulation of enzymes
involved in the androgenic pathway, in particular cytochrome P-450c17 and 17b223

hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.4
Increased steroidogenesis may involve the adrenal gland as well, though the
contribution of the adrenal gland in most cases is difficult to determine and is
controversial.
Hyperinsulinemia further fuels this cycle by priming theca cells for LH-stimulated
androgen synthesis. Insulin also decreases the synthesis of sex hormone binding
globulin (SHBG), the effect of which is increased androgen bioavailability.
PCOS is a complex polygenic disease. It is currently the subject of multiple
linkage and case-control studies to identify possible candidate genes.

DIAGNOSIS
PCOS is a disorder with multiple manifestations that vary between individuals and
may also vary over time in the same individual.

Clinical Presentation
Most of the features of the syndrome develop at the onset of puberty, and severity
varies from mild hirsutism to amenorrhea and infertility. Infertility may be the
presenting complaint. Most patients are overweight, but the degree of weight gain is
variable and influenced by ethnicity.
History
Menstrual history is a critical part of the evaluation for PCOS. Onset of
menarche, menstrual interval and regularity, missed periods, and history of
irregular bleeding should be documented. Patients should be asked about
contraception, unprotected sex, and prior pregnancies.
Irregular menses are commonly associated with chronic oligo- or anovulation.
This can result in endometrial hyperplasia, manifesting as dysfunctional uterine
bleeding.
Less commonly, women with PCOS present with secondary amenorrhea (~24%).
These women respond less favorably to treatment.
Women with PCOS may take longer to conceive. A subset of women has persistent
anovulation and infertility.
The onset and severity of hirsutism and acne should be recorded. Androgen
excess can result in hirsutism, acne, seborrhea, and androgenic alopecia (male
pattern baldness) that often starts at menarche but may occur or progress with
weight gain. Frank alopecia is rare in PCOS.
Central visceral obesity (android type) affects 40% to 50% of women with
224

PCOS. Interestingly, the mean body mass index (BMI) of women with PCOS in
the United States is 35 to 40 kg/m2, but in Europe and other countries it is 25 to 28
kg/m2 or less.5
Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance can be present even in the absence of
obesity, but these conditions are exacerbated by the presence of it.
Sleep apnea or sleep-disordered breathing may be present.
Family history may reveal relatives with other manifestations of insulin resistance,
including diabetes and hypertension.
Physical Examination
Hirsutism is characterized by excess terminal pigmented hair in a male pattern of
distribution and commonly occurs on the chin, upper lip, periareolar area, and the
lower abdomen. It can be scored by the Ferriman–Gallwey system, discussed in
Chapter 18.
Assess the degree of acne and male-pattern baldness.
Acanthosis nigricans, a marker of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, can be
appreciated as velvety, symmetric hyperpigmented plaques that commonly occur
on the posterior neck, axilla, elbows, face, knuckles, and groin.
To assess cardiovascular risk, accurate blood pressure measurement is
important. Waist and hip circumferences may also be helpful as a waist-to-hip
ratio >0.85 and waist circumference >100 cm are associated with cardiovascular
morbidity.6

Diagnostic Criteria
The criteria used to diagnose PCOS have evolved over 20+ years. The first
guidelines were published by a NIH working group in 1990. The Rotterdam
PCOS Consensus Working Group then published guidelines in 2003, adding
pelvic ultrasound criteria. The Androgen Excess Society favors a hybrid system
identifying hyperandrogenism as the primary defect, indicating that lack of
hyperandrogenism, regardless of the presence of menstrual irregularities, makes
the diagnosis of PCOS less certain.7 These guidelines are compared in Table 201.
TABLE 20-1 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR PCOSA,B

225

Exclusion of other etiologies of female hyperandrogenism is essential for the
diagnosis of PCOS with all of the guidelines.

Differential Diagnosis
Conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis of PCOS include late-onset
congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), androgen-secreting adrenal or ovarian
tumors, Cushing’s syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, pregnancy, hypothyroidism,
acromegaly, and drug-induced disorders.
Late-onset CAH is more common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, and
patients may appear more virilized than a typical patient with PCOS and have a
family history of infertility, hirsutism, or both.
With androgen-secreting neoplasms, symptoms start later and are more severe
and progressive.
Cushing’s syndrome may present at any time, be slowly progressive, and when
mild, look similar to PCOS.
In hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism, symptoms of androgen excess are
less prominent.
Other phenotypic features of acromegaly should help with this diagnosis.
Drugs such as topical and oral androgens, valproate, and cyclosporine can
cause hyperandrogenism and variable degrees of menstrual irregularities.

226

Diagnostic Testing
The laboratory workup is initially aimed at excluding other disorders. There is no
universally accepted definition for PCOS based on hormonal criteria.
Laboratory Studies
To rule out other disorders, start with measurement of testosterone and
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels, which will both be markedly
elevated in virilizing adrenal or ovarian tumors, >200 ng/dL and >600 mcg/dL
respectively. Serum LH is usually normal or slightly elevated. A random 17hydroxyprogesterone level of <200 ng/dL excludes non-classical CAH. An
overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression of morning cortisol to <1.2 ng/mL
or normal 24-hour urine for free cortisol rules out Cushing’s syndrome.
Hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism are not usually associated with
hyperandrogenemia, but a serum prolactin and TSH level should be checked in
any woman with menstrual irregularity.
The following hormonal abnormalities can be seen in women with PCOS:
Roughly 80% have total and free testosterone levels in the upper normal to twofold or higher range. Because of decreased production of hepatic SHBG, the
total testosterone may be in the normal range while the free testosterone is
elevated. DHEA-S levels are sometimes mildly elevated.
Elevated LH and normal FSH, resulting in an elevated LH/FSH ratio may be
observed, but due to the pulsatile nature of gonadotropin secretion and day-today variability, gonadotropin levels are too insensitive to confirm the
diagnosis. LH levels could be useful as a secondary parameter, especially in
lean women with amenorrhea.
Serum estrone may be increased, while serum estradiol is usually normal to low
normal.
Prolactin can be mildly elevated.
Impaired glucose tolerance (and even frank diabetes) may be diagnosed in 30%
to 40% of women when tested with a 75 g, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT).8 Fasting blood glucose levels may be normal. The 2003 guidelines
suggest screening all women with a BMI > 27 kg/m2 with an OGTT.
Atherogenic lipid profiles are observed with increased prevalence in women
with PCOS, even after adjusting for BMI. The characteristics of an atherogenic
profile include high very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), high low-density
lipoprotein (LDL), and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Low HDL levels
are associated with obesity and high LDL levels with hyperandrogenemia.
227

Imaging
The specific ultrasound characteristics proposed by the 2003 consensus are (a)
presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2 to 9 mm in diameter and
(b) increased ovarian volume (>10 mL) and stroma. Only one ovary meeting these
criteria is sufficient. The subjective appearance of polycystic ovaries should not be
substituted for this definition. These ultrasound criteria do not apply to women on
oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). If there is evidence of a dominant follicle (>10
mm), the scan should be repeated.9

TREATMENT
Treatment of PCOS should be individualized to the patient, including her goals of
care.
Several treatment options exist for each of the manifestations of PCOS. Most
manifestations can be reversed by improving insulin resistance, either by weight
loss or with medication.
Typically, response to therapy is slow, with clinical changes lagging behind
biochemical improvement by several months.
Pregnancy should be excluded before initiation of pharmacologic therapy with
oral contraceptives or antiandrogens.

Medications
Oral Contraceptives
OCPs are standard therapy for those who do not desire pregnancy. OCPs interrupt
the cycle of hyperandrogenemia and oligomenorrhea. They allow the resumption
of normal menses and prevent the chronic, unopposed, estrogenic stimulation of
the endometrium.
OCPs lower androgen levels by 50% to 60%.10 Hirsutism and acne respond well.
Typically, treatment should be initiated by a combination preparation that contains
ethinyl estradiol in conjunction with a progestin with low androgenic activity such
as norgestimate or desogestrel.11
Drospirenone is a progestin with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity
that is approved for use in combination with ethinyl estradiol.
Cyproterone acetate is a unique progestin/antiandrogen that inhibits the binding of
testosterone and 5-α-dihydrotestosterone to the androgen receptor. It is marketed
outside the Unites States in combination with ethinyl estradiol for use as an OCP.
Recent studies have raised concerns about increased risk of thromboembolism
228

with the antiandrogenic progestins.12
The choice of an OCP, and indeed the use of any OCP, should be individualized
based on the degree of insulin resistance, degree of androgenicity, anthropometric
characteristics, and presence of other risk factors for metabolic, cardiovascular,
and thromboembolic complications. Insulin resistance can potentially be
worsened by OCP use.11
Contraindications for OCP therapy must be considered, including age, smoking,
and prior thromboembolic disease.
In women who do not desire (or cannot take) oral contraceptive therapy,
intermittent oral progestin therapy with a 7- to 10-day course of
medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) every 1 to 3 months can be considered.
Although this therapy can offer endometrial protection, it does not reduce the
effects of hyperandrogenism such as hirsutism and acne.
Insulin Sensitizers
The use of medications that improve insulin sensitivity was initially based on the
observation that interventions that improve insulin resistance, such as weight loss,
reduce androgen levels and induce ovulation. The clinical response to insulinlowering therapy does not seem to be related to the magnitude of insulin
resistance.
Although not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
treatment of PCOS, metformin effectively decreases testosterone levels and
fasting insulin and glucose levels. It improves ovulation in multiple studies, but
there is no overall increase in live births as compared to placebo across multiple
studies.13 Metformin can be used in pregnancy (category B). Effective doses of
metformin are between 1500 and 2000 mg/day, although randomized studies have
not been done.
Thiazolidinediones may be effective. The initial studies were done with
troglitazone, which has since been removed from the market. Newer agents
(rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) have shown similar effects in increasing insulin
sensitivity, decreasing testosterone levels, and inducing ovulation.14 Rosiglitazone
has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and is not
recommended. These agents should not be used in women who desire pregnancy
(category C).
Antiandrogens
Antiandrogens can be used in conjunction with oral contraceptives to derive
further benefit when hirsutism is the primary complaint. Because of the teratogenic
229

potential of antiandrogens, they must be used only when women are treated with
effective contraception.
Spironolactone (50 to 100 mg twice daily) inhibits androgen biosynthesis in the
adrenal and ovary, inhibits 5-α-reductase, and decreases the effect of androgens
by blocking the androgen receptor. When used alone, it has minimal effects on
free testosterone levels. When used in combination with an oral contraceptive,
both androgen levels and androgen action are decreased due to synergistic
actions.
Finasteride (5 mg daily) and flutamide (250 mg bid) can also be used to treat
hirsutism. Flutamide may cause hepatotoxicity.
Enflornithine hydrochloride 13.9% cream, which slows hair growth, can be used
to treat facial hirsutism. It is usually not covered by insurance. Topical minoxidil
can be used for male pattern hair loss.
Other Pharmacologic Interventions
More recently, studies in women with PCOS have used agents like Orlistat to
achieve weight loss and have shown reduction of testosterone levels in addition to
weight loss.15
Simvastatin, used in combination with an OCP, and atorvastatin, tested without
concomitant OCP use, improved testosterone levels, hirsutism (simvastatin plus
OCP), and lipid profiles.16,17

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Weight reduction should be a central feature to any treatment plan of PCOS. This is
generally done with caloric restriction and increased aerobic exercise. Studies have
shown no benefit to restricting carbohydrates as opposed to fat.18

COMPLICATIONS
Infertility is one of the biggest concerns for women with PCOS.
It is important to complete a basic infertility evaluation of the couple, including
a semen analysis of the man, to rule out other contributing factors.
Weight loss and insulin sensitizers, such as metformin, may induce ovulatory
cycles and permit conception. Clomiphene citrate is a triphenylethylenederived nonsteroidal agent that is theorized to function at the level of the
hypothalamus as an antiandrogen to restore gonadotropin secretion. It is
superior to metformin in achieving conception, but there is a relatively high rate
of multiple pregnancies. Combination of clomiphene with metformin may
230

increase pregnancy rates. If pregnancy is not achieved after 6 to 9 months of
clomiphene with or without metformin, the patient should be referred to a
fertility specialist for use of injectable gonadotropins or in vitro fertilization.
An increased incidence of spontaneous miscarriage is associated with PCOS.
Treatment with metformin may reduce the rate of miscarriage.
If pregnancy does occur, there is an increased risk for pregnancy-induced
hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, pregnancy loss, and preterm
labor.
The prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes is increased
in women with PCOS, who have a 3 to 7 times greater risk of developing
diabetes. This association is present in both obese and lean women with PCOS.19
Women with a family history of type 2 diabetes are at even greater risk for
development of diabetes.
Hypertension is not common in young women with PCOS, but studies have shown
that a longer or irregular menstrual cycle length can lead to a two-fold increase in
risk for hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension increases dramatically by
the time of perimenopause.
Women with PCOS also have an increased risk for dyslipidemia and have been
shown to have abnormal vascular function, higher rates of coagulopathy, and
increased markers of inflammation. There is likely an increased cardiovascular
risk, but this research is still on-going.20
Unopposed estrogenic stimulation of the uterus may increase the likelihood of
endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
The long-term metabolic and cardiovascular disease risks associated with PCOS
heighten the importance of proper diagnosis and follow-up.
BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure determinations are recommended
for all women with PCOS.
Oral glucose tolerance testing (75 g, 2 hour) is recommended for those with
obesity, advanced age, personal history of gestational diabetes, or family history
of type 2 diabetes mellitus.21 This should be repeated every 2 years or annually if
impaired glucose tolerance is found.22
Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including tobacco abuse, sleep
apnea, and hyperlipidemia, should be assessed annually.
In women with PCOS, relative hyperandrogenemia and increased risk for glucose
intolerance and dyslipidemia persist after menopause, so ongoing screening is
231

warranted.23

Hypercalcemia
Nadia Khoury and Kim Carmichael
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Calcium homeostasis maintains serum calcium levels by balancing dietary intake
with urinary excretion and formation of new bone. Daily calcium intake is about 1
g, with 150 mg of that being absorbed. Effective calcium absorption is dependent
on vitamin D. Absorbed calcium is incorporated into bone or excreted by the
kidneys.
Calcium circulates both free (~50%) or bound to protein or anion. The free,
ionized portion is sensed and regulated. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is released
when calcium is low. It causes bone resorption, calcium reabsorption in the
kidney, and increased production of activated vitamin D in the kidney, all leading
to a rise in calcium. PTH-mediated bone resorption is mediated by the RANKRANK ligand-OPG system.

Definition
Hypercalcemia is an elevation of free, ionized calcium in the serum. Elevated total
serum calcium can occur without increased ionized calcium if calcium-binding
proteins are elevated, but this does not constitute hypercalcemia.

Epidemiology
Depending on the population being studied, hypercalcemia affects up to 0.1% to
2.6% of hospitalized patients.1
The two most common causes
of hypercalcemia
are primary
hyperparathyroidism (PHP)
and malignancy-associated hypercalcemia
(MAH). PHP accounts for 50% to 60% of outpatient hypercalcemia, while MAH
is the most common cause of inpatient hypercalcemia, occurring in 20% to 30% of
malignancies.2

Pathophysiology
234

Hypercalcemia can result from increased bone resorption, vitamin D-dependent
mechanisms, other hormonal mechanisms, drugs, milk–alkali syndrome, and
miscellaneous other causes.
Increased bone resorption leading to hypercalcemia has multiple etiologies,
including the following:
Elevated PTH levels, seen in PHP. PHP is most commonly (80%) due to a
single benign adenoma (see Chapter 22 for more details) but can be due to fourgland hyperplasia or carcinoma, most commonly as part of a multiple endocrine
neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.3
In chronic kidney disease an appropriately elevated PTH, termed secondary
hyperparathyroidism, can occur due to hypocalcemia and vitamin D
deficiency. When PTH secretion becomes autonomous in CKD, it is termed
tertiary hyperparathyroidism and usually results in hypercalcemia.
Malignancy can lead to hypercalcemia via four mechanisms, three of which are
directly related to increased bone resorption.4 First, systemic secretion of
PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), termed humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy
(HHM), is seen primarily in squamous cell carcinomas. It can also be seen in
cancers of the kidney, ovary, and bladder. It is a frequent complication in
patients with lymphomas associated with human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia
virus 1 (HTLV-1). Second, in cancers with extensive skeletal metastases (e.g.,
multiple myeloma, breast cancer), local osteolytic hypercalcemia occurs. Local
release of cytokines leads to osteoclast differentiation and inhibition of
osteoblasts, leading to bone destruction.5 Examples of these cytokines include
TGF-b, interleukins-1 and -6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Third,
rarely, ectopic PTH secretion from carcinomas of the lung, thymus, ovary, and
undifferentiated neuroendocrine tumors can cause hypercalcemia. Fourth,
lymphoma and some ovarian dysgerminomas can cause hypercalcemia by
increasing 1-hydroxylation of vitamin D, leading to increased calcium
absorption via higher 1,25-OH-vitamin D levels.
Thyrotoxicosis leads to hypercalcemia due to increased bone turnover (with
greater proportional osteolysis) in 15% to 20% of patients with
hyperthyroidism.6
Excessive intake of vitamin A (>50,000 to 100,000 IU daily) rarely causes
hypercalcemia. This can be seen with supplement ingestion or in the use of
retinoic acid derivates in treatment of some malignancies. This process is
likely mediated through elevated interleukin-6 levels.7
Prolonged immobilization typically causes bone resorption with hypercalciuria
that, in rare cases, may also cause hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia due to
235

immobilization is more common in children and adolescents, but has also been
described in burn patients, patients with spinal cord injuries or other severe
neurologic deficits, and patients with underlying high bone-turnover states (e.g.,
Paget’s disease).8 The mechanism by which this occurs is not entirely known,
but is thought to be due to an uncoupling of bone turnover with increased
osteoclast and decreased osteoblast activity.
Elevated vitamin D levels lead to hypercalcemia by increasing intestinal calcium
absorption.
Chronic ingestion of more than 50,000 to 100,000 IU/day of ergocalciferol
(vitamin D2) or cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is required to produce significant
hypercalcemia in normal individuals. Because vitamin D is highly fat soluble,
intoxication may persist for weeks. Excessive or accidental ingestion of
1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) can also lead to hypercalcemia, but should resolve
within days after discontinuation.9
Granulomatous diseases may cause hypercalcemia through increased
conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D by macrophages, which is insensitive
to feedback regulation by calcium or PTH. Hypercalcemia develops in 10% to
20% of patients with sarcoidosis and has also been associated with
lymphomas, berylliosis, Crohn’s disease, Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG)
therapy, and lipoid pneumonia. It is seen in various granulomatous processes
including Wegener’s granulomatosis, eosinophilic granuloma, acute
granulomatous pneumonia, and granulomatosis of the liver, and due to talc and
silicone. Several infectious causes, including tuberculosis, histoplasmosis,
candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, and cat scratch fever have also been
implicated.10
The third most common cause of hypercalcemia is the milk–alkali syndrome
resulting from ingestion of large amounts of milk or calcium carbonate, as in the
treatment of dyspepsia or osteoporosis. The hypercalcemia is associated with
metabolic alkalosis and renal insufficiency. Typically, >5 g of calcium per day is
required to produce the syndrome, but this is dependent on individual patient
susceptibility (intestinal absorption and renal clearance of calcium).11
Many medications have been associated with hypercalcemia.
Thiazide diuretics, in particular, are frequently implicated as a cause of
hypercalcemia. However, hypercalcemia due to thiazides is typically mild and
transient (1 to 2 weeks) unless some other high bone-turnover state is present,
such as PHP.
Lithium therapy may also lead to hypercalcemia in 15% to 60% of patients by
236

an unknown mechanism that shifts the set point for calcium sensing at the
parathyroid gland.12
Additional medications that have been reported to cause hypercalcemia include
estrogens used in the treatment of breast cancer with bony metastases, growth
hormones in intensive care unit patients, ganciclovir in renal transplantation,
omeprazole in acute interstitial nephritis, 8-Cl-cAMP chemotherapy,
manganese toxicity, foscarnet, hepatitis B vaccination, and theophylline.10
Other endocrine disorders can lead to hypercalcemia. Adrenal insufficiency has
been associated with hypercalcemia. Primary adrenal failure has been implicated
more commonly, but there are case reports in secondary adrenal failure as well.
The exact pathophysiology is not known, but hypercalcemia is thought to be
caused by a decrease in intravascular volume and relative hemoconcentration of
serum albumin and bound calcium. Hypercalcemia is an infrequent complication
o f pheochromocytoma and may be associated with PHP as part of MEN2A. In
addition, PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia is implicated in pheochromocytoma.
Rarely, islet cell tumors of the pancreas can lead to hypercalcemia. This is either
in association with MEN, through PTHrP, or through secretion of vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to a syndrome of hypercalcemia with watery
diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria.13
Hypercalcemia can be seen in resolving acute kidney injury due to
rhabdomyolysis where calcium previously deposited in injured muscle is
mobilized. This is exacerbated by a degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism due
to the acute kidney injury.
Familial hypocalcuric hypocalcemia (FHH) causes a long-standing asymptomatic
hypercalcemia. It is caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the
calcium sensing receptor, leading to an increased set point for calcium
homeostasis leading to mildly elevated PTH, hypocalcuria, and hypermagnesemia.
Complications are rare.
In the past, aluminum intoxication was a significant problem in patients with
chronic kidney disease treated with hemodialysis. These patients were at
increased risk for hypercalcemia because aluminum accumulation in bone resulted
in diminished osteoblastic activity and reduced calcium incorporation into the
skeleton. When treated with calcitriol, enhanced gut absorption of calcium along
with calcium in the dialysate increases the amount of bioavailable calcium flux
into the body without an active reservoir to store the extra calcium, thereby
resulting in hypercalcemia.

DIAGNOSIS
237

The symptoms and signs of hypercalcemia often correlate with the age of the
patient; the underlying disease process; concurrent comorbidities; and the degree,
duration, and rate of development of hypercalcemia. Patients who are older or
who have significant comorbidities are more likely to be sensitive to the effects of
hypercalcemia. Likewise, hypercalcemia associated with malignancies or
infectious disorders may present with symptoms of the underlying disease, which
may overlap with mild symptoms of hypercalcemia.
In general, levels <12 mg/dL are asymptomatic; levels >15 mg/dL may cause
severe symptoms such as coma and cardiac arrest. However, long-standing or
slowly developing hypercalcemia may be well tolerated, whereas rapidly
progressing hypercalcemia is more likely to be symptomatic.

Clinical Presentation
Hypercalcemia affects multiple organ systems. The saying “stones, bones,
(psychiatric) moans, and (abdominal) groans” is a useful tool for remembering the
most common symptoms.
Hypercalcemic, or parathyroid, crisis is hypercalcemia resulting in detiorataion of
clinical status. Features include acute kidney injury, somnolence and coma,
cardiac arrest, severe and recurrent peptic ulcer disease, calcifying pancreatitis,
nephrocalcinosis, and recurrent nephrolithiasis. Most cases are due to PHP.14
History
Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common but are usually subtle. Patients with
chronic, mild hypercalcemia complain of fatigue, difficulty concentrating,
depression, and anxiety. Some may complain of headaches, emotional lability, and
irritability. With more severe hypercalcemia, especially with a rapid rise or in
elderly patients, alterations in the sensorium, including coma, weakness,
personality changes, hallucinations, and psychosis can occur.
Hypercalcemia may be associated with hypertension and, rarely, with
bradyarrhythmias.14 Ventricular arrhythmias have also been reported, but without
proven causality. Chronic hypercalcemia can cause calcified myocardial fibers,
heart valves, and coronary arteries.
Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal complaint associated with
hypercalcemia. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Due to
increased gastric acid and pancreatic enzyme secretion, severe and recurrent
peptic ulcer disease and pancreatitis can occur, but this is most commonly seen in
association with MEN, type 1.
Polyuria and polydipsia may develop as chronically elevated calcium levels cause
238

nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nephrolithiasis is associated with long-standing
hypercalcemia, most commonly in the setting of PHP. Renal insufficiency
secondary to chronic hypercalcemic nephropathy may be irreversible. Type 1
renal tubular acidosis infrequently occurs. Acute hypercalcemia can cause acute
kidney injury due to direct renal vasoconstriction and volume depletion.
Skeletal manifestations of hypercalcemia depend on the underlying
pathophysiology. Patients with hyperparathyroidism may develop osteoporosis or
osteitis fibrosa cystica. Patients with an underlying malignancy may present with
bone pain due to metastases or pathologic fractures.
Physical Examination
Physical examination findings in hypercalcemia are scant. Rarely, corneal
examination will show band keratopathy—visible as a horizontal band across the
cornea in the area exposed between the eyelids on slit lamp examination.

Diagnostic Testing
The work-up of hypercalcemia is primarily based on laboratory examination. This
is guided by a comprehensive history including symptoms of other endocrine
disorders, prescribed and over-the-counter medications, and occupational
exposures.
FIGURE 21-1 Algorithm for Hypercalcemia.

239

One must first identify true hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia without elevated
ionized calcium can occur in hyperalbuminemia, severe dehydration, or multiple
myeloma with a calcium-binding paraprotein. Elevated ionized calcium with
normal serum calcium may be seen in hypoalbuminema due to malnutrition or
chronic liver disease.
240

Laboratory Studies
Serum calcium needs to be adjusted for changes in albumin and pH. Acidosis
decreases and alkalosis increases ionized calcium. Calcium should be changed by
0.8 mg/dL for every 1 g/dL change in albumin outside of the normal range.
Start with measurement of intact PTH. If this elevated, it is most likely PHP. To
differentiate PHP from FHH, measure spot urinary calcium and creatinine and
calculate a fractional excretion of calcium—if this is <1%, it favors FHH. An
elevated calcium and PTH can also be seen in lithium use.
If PTH is suppressed, look for other causes of hypercalcemia.
Malignancy leading to hypercalcemia is usually readily evident and therefore
measurement of PTHrP is not needed.
Measure 1,25-OH-Vitamin D next. If this is elevated, consider chest x-ray and
CBC to evaluate for lymphoma or other granulomatous disease such as
sarcoidosis.
If 25-OH-Vitamin D but not 1,25-OH-Vitamin D is elevated, consider
exogenous vitamin D intoxication.
Other laboratory work-up of hypercalcemia should be guided by history and could
include thyroid-stimulating hormone (there may be a concominant elevated
chloride) or cortisol (in the setting of weakness, hypotension, and hyponatremia).
Other tests include vitamin A levels, urinary catecholamines for
pheochromocytoma, and evaluation for multiple myeloma.
Electrocardiogram
Electrocardiographic findings may include a shortened QT interval and mild
prolongations of the PR and QRS intervals. With severe hypercalcemia, there may
be alterations in the T-wave configuration, as well.15

TREATMENT
Determining when to treat hypercalcemia depends on its chronicity and the degree
of elevation.
Most patients with PHP have mild elevations in calcium (<12 mg/dL) and do not
require active treatment. They need to be educated and modify their lifestyle as
outlined in the Lifestyle/Risk Modification section.
Even those with serum calcium above 12 mg/dL may not require treatment if this
level is chronic. Usually, if the rise to this level is acute, patients are symptomatic
and require active treatment.

241

Medications
T h e primary focus of treating acute hypercalcemia is to increase urinary
calcium excretion. Patients should be aggressively hydrated with normal saline
over 24 to 48 hours to lower the serum calcium concentration by as much as 3 to 9
mg/dL, depending on the initial degree of hypercalcemia. Close monitoring is
needed, as fluid overload can develop, especially if there is underlying cardiac or
renal insufficiency. The traditional use of loop diuresis with saline hydration has
recently been questioned.16 Loop diuresis should be reserved for the setting of
fluid overload. Aggressive diuresis in a volume-depleted patient may worsen the
hypercalcemia by exacerbating the volume loss. In addition, precautions should be
taken to prevent potassium and magnesium depletion.
Bisphosphonates
Intravenous bisphosphonate treatment provides a longer term solution to
hypercalemia when a cause has been identified and reversible causes have been
fixed. Bisphosphonates are analogs of pyrophosphate that are concentrated in
areas of high bone turnover and inhibit both calcification and osteoclastic bone
resorption.
These agents have maximum effect at 2 to 4 days and last 3 to 4 weeks. Two agents
are FDA approved—pamidronate and zoledronic acid. While zoledronic acid
has been found to be slightly more potent in head-to-head studies and has a shorter
infusion time, pamidronate is less expensive and nearly as efficacious.17
Both agents are well tolerated, and side effects are usually mild and transient.
Fever is the most common reaction to intravenous administration. Renal toxicity is
the most common serious side effect—doses should be given over a longer period
of time or possibly reduced if renal insufficiency is present. Osteonecrosis of the
jaw is a rare complication of bisphosphonate therapy, but should be considered
when treating patients who have had a recent dental procedure or who are
planning for major dental surgery.
Calcitonin
Until the time when bisphosphonates reach potency, salmon calcitonin administered
subcutaneously or intramuscularly (4 U/kg every 12 hours, increased up to 6 to 8
U/kg every 6 hours) can be used as a temporizing measure. It acts quickly—within
6 to 8 hours—and has few side effects. Unfortunately, it is a relatively weak agent,
only lowering serum calcium concentrations by 1 to 2 mg/dL, and acquired
resistance often develops within the first 48 hours, limiting its use.

242

Other Treatments
Dialysis against a no- or low-calcium bath may be needed in the setting of acute
symptomatic hypercalcemia and renal or cardiac insufficiency leading to volume
overload.
Gallium nitrate inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption, takes several days to work,
and lasts 1 week. Its use is limited by need for a 5-day-long infusion and severe
side effects including renal failure, hypophosphatemia, and anemia.
Mithramycin inhibits osteoclast RNA synthesis. It is rarely used because of its
severe side effects including renal and liver toxicity, nausea, thrombocytopenia,
and extravasation reactions.
Hypercalcemia in hematologic malignancies and granulomatous diseases
associated with increased production of 1,25(OH)2D may be treated effectively
with moderately high-dose glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone 40 to 60 mg daily).
Glucocorticoids increase urinary calcium excretion and decrease intestinal
calcium absorption, but may also have direct antitumor effects. Calcium levels
usually fall within 48 hours, with a peak response in 7 to 10 days.2
Corticosteroids are also effective therapy for hypercalcemia related to adrenal
insufficiency and excessive vitamin A or D ingestion.
Ketoconazole acts as an inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 hydroxylation of
25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, and may also be effective in treating hypercalcemia
caused by vitamin D intoxication.
Cinacalcet is a calcimemetic that increases the sensitivity of the calcium sensing
receptor, leading to reduced PTH levels. It is currently approved for treatment of
secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease where it reduces
adverse outcomes from hypercalcemia. It is not yet approved for PHP but can be
used in parathyroid carcinoma or PHP that persists after surgery or when surgery
is no longer feasible.18
A monoclonal antibody against RANK ligand, denosumab, was recently approved
for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Studies of its use in MAH are
ongoing.17

Surgical Management
Parathyroidectomy by an experienced surgeon is the mainstay of therapy for
symptomatic PHP and asymptomatic disease in the presence of renal dysfunction,
osteoporosis, or calcium >1 mg/dL of the upper limit of normal. 19 This is discussed
in more detail in Chapter 22.

243

Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Patients with mild and moderate hypercalcemia should be instructed to avoid
factors that exacerbate hypercalcemia. These include lithium, thiazide diuretics,
volume depletion, prolonged bed rest, and a diet high in calcium (>1 g/day).
Patients should be instructed to maintain adequate hydration (about 3 L/day) to
prevent nephrolithiasis.

Hyperparathyroidism
Shunzhong Bao and Dwight A. Towler
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hyperparathyroidism is defined as the elevated production of parathyroid hormone
(PTH) by the parathyroid glands.

Classification
Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) occurs when one or more of the
parathyroid glands produce an excessive amount of PTH for the amount of
calcium present in the blood.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is a normal elevation in the production
of PTH that occurs in response to a derangement in calcium homeostasis that
causes, or would otherwise lead to, frank hypocalcemia (e.g., renal failure,
hyperphosphatemia, or vitamin D deficiency).
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism develops in the setting of long-standing severe
sHPT with parathyroid hyperplasia. The increased mass of parathyroid gland
produces a constitutive excess of PTH, even after correcting underlying
derangement in calcium phosphate homeostasis. This is most commonly seen in
the setting of renal transplantation for chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Epidemiology
pHPT is one of the most common causes of hypercalcemia, especially in the
outpatient setting. pHPT is a relatively common disease that affects about 1:1000
of the adult population. Women with the disease outnumber men by as much as
3:1, and the disease most commonly presents after age 45.
A small increase in the incidence of non-endocrine malignancies (breast cancer,
squamous cell skin cancer, colon cancer, renal parenchymal cancer) has been
reported in patients with pHPT, but the reason for the association is not known.
An association with thyroid cancer has also been reported; however, it is not
246

clear if the reported incidence is higher simply because of increased detection
during the evaluation and management of pHPT. The genetic association with
multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) is detailed below.
Overall, the effect of mild pHPT on mortality is still being evaluated and debated.
However, recent data from PEARS (the Parathyroid Epidemiology and Audit
Research Study) suggest that mild pHPT (i.e., calcium never over 12 mg/dL, no
parathyroid surgery or renal complications) may increase morbidity and mortality.
The association between moderate to severe pHPT and all-cause mortality—
particularly from cardiovascular disease and malignancy—is more firmly
established. Increasing calcium levels have also been shown to be an independent
risk factor for death.1

Etiology
PTH is typically secreted by the parathyroid gland as an 84 amino acid
polypeptide often referred to as “intact PTH.” The single most important regulator
of PTH secretion is the level of serum ionized calcium, which acts through the
calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to produce rapid (within seconds) and
relatively large responses in PTH secretion to small changes in calcium.2
The synthesis and processing of PTH within the parathyroid gland also adapt
quickly to changes in calcium levels, and parathyroid hyperplasia may develop in
response to more chronic hypocalcemia. Phosphate and vitamin D levels are also
important in the regulation of PTH, with higher levels of phosphate and lower
levels of vitamin D increasing synthesis and secretion of PTH. Long-standing
phosphate excess and vitamin D insufficiency in CKD cause parathyroid gland
proliferation and hyperplasia via paracrine TGF-alpha signals, culminating in
tertiary HPT.3
The effects of PTH are mediated primarily through the PTH/ PTHRP receptor
(PTHR1), a transmembrane G protein–coupled receptor found in the kidneys,
intestine, vascular smooth muscle, and bone.4
PTH causes an increase in serum calcium through three mechanisms5.
In the kidney, PTH acts to increase calcium and decrease phosphate
reabsorption. PTH-dependent reabsorption of calcium occurs in the distal
convoluted tubule via activation of the TRPV5 calcium channel. Phosphate
reabsorption is reduced by PTH in the proximal tubule via inhibition of NaPiIIc and NaPi-IIa sodium-phosphate co-transporters.
PTH acts to increase the activity of 1α-hydroxylase in proximal tubular cells,
increasing the level of 1,25(OH)2D over several hours, and ultimately leading
to increased absorption of calcium and phosphate by the small intestine.
247

Prolonged secretion of PTH also increases bone resorption and decreases bone
mass—although this is more variable than the response elicited by PTHrP, the
PTHR1 ligand causing humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. When given
intermittently, PTH increases bone mass. This anabolic response occurs in part
via PTH downregulation of osteocyte sclerostin, a negative regulator boneforming Wnt-LRP5/6 signals.6 This may explain why bone mass is often
preserved to within normal limits in patients with mild pHPT. Nevertheless,
total bone mass most frequently improves in patients following
parathyroidectomy for pHPT.

Pathophysiology
Primary Hyperparathyroidism
pHPT is the inappropriate secretion of PTH from one or more of the parathyroid
glands that leads to hypercalcemia.
A single benign parathyroid adenoma is found in 80% to 90% of cases. Overexpression of cyclin D1, encoded by the PRAD1 oncogene, is observed in ~30%
of adenomas. There are several genetic abnormalities that may contribute to the
development of parathyroid hyperplasia, including sporadic mutations in the
multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1) gene that occur in 12% to 16% of single
adenomas.7,8 Recent data suggest that the common CaSR 986S allele may also
increase the risk of pHPT.
Four-gland hyperplasia is seen in approximately 6% of cases. Parathyroid
carcinoma is reported to occur in 0.5% to 1% of cases, but is probably in the
lower half of this range. Carcinomas may have characteristic pathologic findings,
but are often only distinguished from adenomas by the degree of vascular/local
invasion or the presence of lymph node metastases.7–9
Familial hyperparathyroidism is rare and is most commonly associated with
MEN1 and MEN2A.
MEN1 is caused by a defect in gene encoding the tumor suppressor menin and is
inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. It is most commonly associated with
parathyroid hyperplasia, pancreatic tumors, and pituitary adenomas, although it
may also be associated with other tumors. Hypercalcemia can be found in
approximately 95% of those with MEN1, typically developing around age 25
years as the earliest manifestation of the syndrome. Although it may be associated
with a single parathyroid adenoma at presentation, it almost always involves
multiglandular hyperplasia.
MEN2 is inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion and is associated with
248

defects in the RET proto-oncogene. It is characterized chiefly by medullary
thyroid cancer, which occurs with complete penetrance, and with
pheochromocytoma. Approximately 25% to 35% of patients develop asymmetric
parathyroid hyperplasia in MEN2A.9
Less commonly pHPT may be caused by familial isolated hyperparathyroidism or
is part of the hyperparathyroidism–jaw tumor syndrome. These are associated
with mutations in the HPRT2 gene encoding parafibromin, a transcriptional
suppressor of the PRAD1 oncogene. It is important to consider since the risk for
developing parathyroid carcinoma is greatly increased to approximately 10%.
Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is an autosomal-dominant disorder
that is caused by a heterogeneous spectrum of mutations of the CaSR that shift the
set point for serum calcium to a higher level. FHH is typically asymptomatic and
is thought to be a rare disorder with estimates of prevalence as low as 1 in
78,000, and as high as 1 in 15,625 in Scotland and 1 in 31,250 in Australia.
Nevertheless, since the biochemical abnormalities in FHH overlap with those of
pHPT, the diagnosis must be considered; otherwise, a patient may undergo an
unnecessary parathyroidectomy that is rarely curative in this disorder.10,11
Lithium therapy can produce alterations in calcium metabolism that mimic the
changes in FHH and resolve when lithium is withdrawn (see Chapter 21).
Secondary and Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism
sHPT is a physiologic response in the production of PTH by the parathyroid
glands, most often in response to hypocalcemia, vitamin D insufficiency, or
hyperphosphatemia. It occurs commonly in CKD, but can occur in other settings
including chronic hepatobiliary disease. Vitamin D deficiency is an oftenoverlooked cause of sHPT that may be misdiagnosed as “incipient” pHPT or
normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism (normal calcium, elevated PTH).12
Concurrent measurement and consideration of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and
urinary 24-hour calcium helps to avoid this mistake, since both are reduced with
sHPT due to vitamin D deficiency.
sHPT develops in virtually all patients with CKD. Both decreased production of
1,25(OH)2D and phosphate retention are involved. Even in the early stages of
renal impairment, production of 1,25(OH)2D may be decreased, leading to a
decline in calcium absorption in the gut. Diminished phosphate clearance by the
kidneys leads to hyperphosphatemia, with excess phosphate forming complexes
with free ionized calcium ions. This decreases activation of the parathyroid gland
CaSR, thus increasing PTH release. In addition, hyperphosphatemia impairs renal
1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), lowering 1,25(OH)2D production and directly
249

stimulating PTH synthesis and secretion by the parathyroid gland.
Hyperphosphatemia-induced FGF23 elevation also suppresses renal CYP27B1.
Uremia may also produce changes associated with PTH-resistance in bone.13
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is said to be present when autonomously elevated
PTH levels are associated with hypercalcemia following long-standing sHPT.
Under chronic stimulation to produce PTH, the parathyroid glands hypertrophy
over time and, in some patients, become resistant to normal feedback mechanisms
and therefore autonomously produce PTH. This is commonly seen in end-stage
renal disease requiring hemodialysis and after prolonged periods of sHPT, and
can first become clinically significant following renal transplantation with
cessation of dialysis.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
pHPT is now most often diagnosed incidentally following the evaluation of an
asymptomatic elevation of serum calcium. Eighty percent of cases are
asymptomatic.
It is important to elicit any history of previous hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia,
history of recurrent nephrolithiasis, history of low bone mass, bone pain, fracture
(especially vertebral fracture or loss in height of ≥ 2), history of hyperuricemia,
gout, or pseudogout.
The classic symptoms and findings of hyperparathyroidism are summarized in the
mnemonic “bones, stones, abdominal moans, psychic groans, and hypertones.”
Many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, but many have non-specific
symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, nocturia or polyuria, constipation,
neuromuscular dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric disturbances that may improve
after parathyroidectomy. Nephrolithiasis is the most common renal manifestation
of pHPT and occurs in approximately 15% to 20% of patients. Other renal
manifestations include hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, renal tubular dysfunction,
and chronic renal insufficiency.14
The skeletal manifestation of classic, severe HPT is osteitis fibrosa cystica, which
presents with typical radiographic features, including a “salt-and-pepper”
appearance of the skull, bone cysts, and brown tumors of the long bones.
However, this condition is now seen in <1% of patients with pHPT.
The most characteristic skeletal finding is decreased bone mass with redistribution
250

reflecting PTH’s catabolic effects on periosteal cortical bone and anabolic effects
on endosteal and cancellous bone (greatest loss at the distal one-third radius
>hip> spine). Bone mass is often globally preserved in patients with mild pHPT.
In severe sHPT, a “rugger jersey” spine appearance can be seen on lateral CXR
due to sclerosing of vertebral endplates with rarified vertebral bone body. The
distal clavicles can also be eroded.
sHPT due to severe vitamin D deficiency may present with osteomalacia because
of abnormal mineralization of bone. Uremic bone disease, also termed renal
osteodystrophy, is a multifactorial and mixed bone disorder that arises in part due
to sHPT in CKD.
Physical Examination
Typically, there are no physical findings in patients with hyperparathyroidism.
Some nonspecific findings may be present: confusion, mental status changes,
possible findings of nephrolithiasis, possible findings of arthritis, slow pulse,
proximal muscle weakness (e.g., difficulty in rising from a squatting position), and
decreased bowel sounds with history of constipation.
A palpable neck mass should raise concerns of malignancy (thyroid/MEN,
metastasis; up to 50% of parathyroid carcinomas may exhibit a palpable neck
mass).

Diagnostic Criteria
pHPT is diagnosed if an elevated PTH level is found in the setting of
hypercalcemia. PTH can be in normal range but inappropriately high for ambient
hypercalcemia. This is commonly seen in the setting of magnesium deficiency, and
frankly elevated PTH levels arise with magnesium repletion. The condition of
FHH needs to be excluded (see Differential Diagnosis).
sHPT is diagnosed in the setting of low calcium or low normal calcium with
elevated PTH. This condition is mostly caused by severe vitamin D deficiency,
calcium deficiency with chronic gastrointestinal malabsorption, and in end-stage
renal disease. It is estimated that 90% of patients with CKD develop sHPT by the
time hemodialysis is initiated.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed in patients with persistently elevated
PTH levels that cannot be medically managed following long-standing sHPT,
most commonly due to end-stage renal disease or chronic gastrointestinal
malabsorption. It is estimated that up to 30% of renal transplant patients may have
tertiary HPT with hypercalcemia clinically manifest following the cessation of
dialysis and with only one functional kidney.
251

Differential Diagnosis
There are essentially only three other considerations in the differential diagnosis
for a persistently elevated calcium and PTH level—FHH, lithium therapy, and
parathyroid carcinoma. Lithium use can easily be determined by the history. On
the other hand, differentiating patients with pHPT from patients with FHH can be
difficult.
The presentation of FHH is typically benign, and rates of nephrolithiasis are no
different from those in the general population.
Patients with FHH typically have calcium levels that are high normal or mildly
elevated, and PTH levels are typically inappropriately normal or mildly elevated
(almost always <100 pg/mL) in the absence of concomitant vitamin D deficiency.
Family and personal history can be helpful in differentiating pHPT from FHH.
Because FHH is a lifelong autosomal-dominant condition, an elevated calcium
level early in life is highly suggestive of the disease, and any previously normal
calcium level essentially rules out the disease. Likewise, a strong family history
of benign hypercalcemia, especially if it was not cured by “neck surgery,” is
suggestive of FHH.10,11
FHH is typically associated with a low 24-hour urine calcium excretion
(usually <100 mg/day; vitamin D insufficiency must be excluded) as compared to
pHPT, which often is associated with elevated calcium excretion (>4 mg/kg/24
hours).
Calcium excretion may be more accurately determined by the ratio of calcium
clearance (CLcalcium) to creatinine clearance (CLcreatinine). The ratio, the fractional
excretion of calcium, can be calculated from the following formula:
CLcalcium/CLcreatinine = (U-Ca × S-Cr)/(U-Cr × S-Ca), or (U-Ca/S-Ca) ÷ (U-Cr/SCr).
where U-Ca and U-Cr represent values of calcium and creatinine from a 24-hour
urine collection and S-Ca and S-Cr are spot serum values. A value of <0.01 is
highly suggestive of FHH, and a value >0.02 essentially rules out the condition,
but overlap between urine calcium excretion in pHPT and FHH does occur.
Family history and CaSR genetics help when the ratio is equivocal (0.01 to 0.02).
Gastrointestinal malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease) and vitamin D insufficiency
must be excluded. Repletion of vitamin D is necessary to provide an accurate
assessment of urine calcium excretion.
Thiazide diuretics will decrease urine calcium excretion and may need to be
252

discontinued if the diagnosis is in question. Usually the actions of thiazides will
disappear after a few days, but there are reports of continued effects on calcium
handling for up to a few months in some patients. The patients’ calcium and PTH
should be reassessed in 2 to 3 months after the thiazide is discontinued.15
Levels of phosphorus can be low in either pHPT or FHH, but can be normal in
either condition as well.
For the case of the patient who is found to have an elevated PTH in the setting of a
normal calcium level, the differential diagnosis includes “incipient” pHPT
(thought to be the earliest stage of pHPT), FHH, and sHPT.
sHPT is most often due to vitamin D deficiency, chronic gastrointestinal
malabsorption, or renal failure. Therefore, levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
creatinine, and 25(OH)D should be determined.
The 25(OH)D level should be repleted to a value of at least 30 ng/mL. It is
generally safe to replace vitamin D in patients with mild pHPT (50,000 IU q week
× 4 weeks, then 50,000 IU q month for 1 year), with little change in serum or
urinary calcium levels. However, serum and urinary calcium should be monitored
after the first month of therapy, since a rare patient may develop worsening
hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria.16,17
Malignancy is also a common cause of hypercalcemia (see Chapter 21). Outside of
parathyroid carcinoma, malignancy-associated hypercalcemia arising from
ectopic PTH production is exceedingly rare. In most cases, hypercalcemia of
malignancy is caused by PTH–related peptide (PTHrP), but dysregulated
1,25(OH)2D synthesis can drive hypercalcemia in leukemias and lymphomas. In
both of these settings, serum intact PTH levels are low normal or frankly
suppressed.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Measure albumin-corrected calcium or ionized calcium, in conjunction with PTH,
phosphorus, and magnesium.
Complete metabolic profile with creatinine, calcium, albumin, bicarbonate, liver
enzymes, and alkaline phosphatase.
Corrected serum calcium = total measured calcium + (4-albumin concentration)
× 0.8, with calcium in mg/dL, and albumin in gm/dL.
Twenty-four-hour urinary calcium and creatinine to calculate renal calcium
clearance and weight-normalized calcium excretion.
253

Serum 25-(OH)D. Vitamin D deficiency is common, and often concomitant with
pHPT.
Serum 1,25 (OH)2D levels, SPEP /UPEP with immunofixation and/or serum
immunoglobulin free light chains with CKD, TSH, and serum PTHrP (only as
needed as part of the workup for hypercalcemia).
Imaging
Neck ultrasonography has been reported to have a sensitivity of 72% to 89% in
detecting solitary adenomas, but has poor sensitivity for detecting multigland
disease. An advantage of ultrasonography is the ability to fully image the thyroid
gland and help characterize any thyroid nodules that also may require surgical
management.
99mTc-sestamibi scanning exhibits sensitivity similar to ultrasound and is
reported to be 68% to 95% in detecting single adenomas, but like ultrasound has
poor sensitivity for detecting multigland disease. Because 99mTc-sestamibi is
also taken up by thyroid tissue, false positives may occur. An advantage of
scintigraphy, however, is that it can detect ectopic glands outside the neck,
identifying adenomas missed by ultrasound.
Therefore, some favor a combined approach to preoperative evaluation. Highresolution neck ultrasonography (US) and 99mTc-sestamibi scanning—planar,
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), or SPECT coupled with
anatomic X-ray CT overlay (SPECT/CT)—have emerged as the two most useful
imaging techniques for locating a single parathyroid adenoma versus multigland
disease prior to surgery in patients with pHPT. 7 The combination of preoperative
US followed by SPECT/CT as needed localizes 95% of solitary adenomas, and
prospectively guides the selection of patients as candidates for minimally
invasive surgery.
Bone mineral density measurement by dual electron X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) is important in hyperparathyroidism patients. It is one indicator of disease
severity. Multiple sites should be measured including distal one-third radius,
spine, and hip.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should not be commonly used for localization
of parathyroid adenomas and are usually reserved for possible parathyroid
carcinoma, failed parathyroidectomy or recurrent disease.

TREATMENT
Primary Hyperparathyroidism
254

The only curative treatment for pHPT is parathyroid surgery and is recommended
for all patients with symptomatic disease.
However, in asymptomatic patients, the difficulty is in determining which patients
are most appropriate for surgery versus watchful waiting. The recent data from
PEARS (The Parathyroid Epidemiology and Audit Research Study) suggests that
mild pHPT (i.e., calcium never over 12 mg/dL, no parathyroid surgery or renal
complications) may increase morbidity and mortality. Moreover, cortical bone
loss is progressive in the absence of surgery, and over a 15-year period, one-third
of pHPT patients progress to meet surgical criteria. Thus, consensus guidelines
concerning surgery in mild pHPT may change in the foreseeable future.
The calcium level, phosphate, and PTH should be followed at least semiannually,
and renal function and DXA bone density (distal radius, hip, and spine) should be
monitored annually in patients who do not undergo surgery.
Surgical Management
Consensus guidelines formulated in 2009 recommend parathyroid surgery under the
following conditions18:
Age <50 years
Albumin corrected serum calcium >1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, or
any prior hypercalcemic crisis.
Reduction in bone mineral density at any site to a T score < –2.5 or prior fragility
fracture (also consider clinical fracture equivalents, e.g., >2" loss in height or
morphometric vertebral fracture).
GFR <60 mL/minute, or 70% of the age-adjusted norm.
Patients for whom close medical follow-up is either not possible (e.g., risk of
dehydration and hypercalcemic crisis is significant) or is not desirable.
While symptomatic nephrolithiasis is an indication for surgery, hypercalciuria
alone (>400 mg daily) is no longer considered as a guideline criteria for surgery.
However, hypercalciuria decreases renal salt and water retention, and the
individual pHPT patient’s risk for dehydration and hypercalcemic crisis should
be considered.
The appropriate surgical procedure depends on the underlying cause of the
disease. If a single adenoma (80% to 85%) is suspected by history or
preoperative localization, the diseased gland can be removed by a minimally
invasive approach. Because the half-life of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone
(iPTH) is very short, intraoperative measurements can be very helpful in
determining the success of the operation as each abnormal gland is removed. If
255

imaging demonstrates a likely single adenoma, the surgeon can resect the
suspected gland and monitor iPTH levels to ensure that the adenoma was
appropriately removed. A drop of 50% from baseline is good evidence of a
successful parathyroidectomy.
In those suspected to have multigland disease, a more traditional bilateral
approach is often used. If hyperplasia of all four glands is found, all parathyroid
tissue is removed except for a small remnant that is left in situ or transplanted to
the non-dominant forearm musculature. A small amount of tissue may also be
cryopreserved in the event that the transplanted tissue fails to engraft in the
muscle.
Several surgical approaches, radio-guided mini-invasive approach, unilateral
mini-invasive approach, bilateral exploration, and conversion to bilateral
exploration have very comparative probability of cure (95.5% to 99%) and
morbidity (0.5% to 3%).19
Complications of parathyroid surgery include the so-called “hungry bone
syndrome,” in which profound hypocalcemia develops, requiring parenteral
calcium supplementation. Rates of postsurgical hypocalcemia may be higher in
those with hyperplasia than in those with a single adenoma, and in younger
patients. Persistent hypoparathyroidism may also occur, mainly in those who have
had surgery for parathyroid hyperplasia. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury occurs
in 1% to 2% of surgeries. In general, improved outcomes correlate directly with
the experience of the surgeon.
Medications
In those patients who do not meet the recommended guidelines for surgical
intervention, and in those who either refuse surgery or are poor surgical
candidates, medical management may be appropriate.
General management: adequate hydration should be ensured, as should a
moderate calcium intake (~1000 mg/day).
Thiazide diuretics and other drugs (e.g., excessive over the counter anti-acid use)
that can exacerbate hypercalcemia should be avoided.
Bisphosphonates are effective treatments for osteoporosis and have shown
promise in preventing loss of bone mass associated with pHPT. Alendronate has
been best-studied, implementing osteoporosis treatment regimens of 10 mg/day or
70 mg/week. While bone mass is preserved, hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria
are generally not controlled long-term.20
Estrogens have been shown to lower serum and urinary calcium levels, decrease
bone resorption and preserve bone mass in postmenopausal women with mild
256

pHPT. However, use of estrogens for pHPT is not preferred due to adverse
effects of hormone replacement therapy and the need for high doses of estrogen for
maximal effect. Raloxifene has potential for decreasing serum calcium and has
fewer adverse effects associated with hormone replacement; however, further
studies are required before it can be recommended for use in pHPT.
The calcimimetic cinacalcet hydrochloride represents a highly useful and
promising new class of medications. Cinacalcet hydrochloride is a type II
calcimimetic that increases the parathyroid gland CaSR to serum calcium levels,
thus decreasing PTH production and release. Cinacalcet is currently FDA
approved for treatment of sHPT and parathyroid carcinoma. However, cinacalcet
also controls PTH and calcium levels in patients with pHPT, and can be used to
control serum calcium in patients with symptomatic hypercalcemia who are
unable to undergo surgery. Cinacalcet is usually initiated at 30 mg PO twice daily
and then increased with titration to serum calcium responses. Note that cinacalcet
does not improve bone mineral density, and only surgery has been shown to
reduce fracture risk in pHPT. Cinacalcet is also a useful therapy for bridging
severely hypercalcemic/hypercalciuric patients until surgery. The drug has a very
short half-life, and can be stopped the day prior to surgery.
Percutaneous ethanol ablation of parathyroid adenomas has been recently
advocated as a therapeutic alternative for patients with pHPT.
To date, in the setting of pHPT only parathyroid surgery has been demonstrated to
decrease risk of hip fracture and reverse bone loss as a clinically relevant
primary endpoint. Since parathyroid surgery is curative in the vast majority of
patients, it should be viewed as the preferred definitive therapy for pHPT.

Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
Treatment should be directed to the correction of the causes leading to
hyperparathyroidism. Surgery should not be pursued in most patients.
Medications
Vitamin D deficiency is relatively easy to correct. In general, vitamin D stores
should be repleted until the 25(OH)D level is >30 ng/mL. Vitamin D deficiency is
common, and thus a frequent concomitant of pHPT. An established replacement
regimen in the setting of pHPT when surgery is not indicated is ergocalciferol
(vitamin D2) 50,000 IU PO per week for 4 weeks, then 50,000 IU per month.
Even prior to surgery for pHPT, the initiation of this vitamin D replacement
regimen is appropriate. In total, approximately 600,000 IU to 750,000 IU of
vitamin D is required to replete a severely deficient patient, assessed by
257

monitoring serum 25(OH)D levels after 3 months of therapy. Oral cholecalciferol
(vitamin D3) at 1000 to 2000 IU daily can be used for maintenance, and may
possess more favorable pharmacodynamic properties and bioactivity.
Managing CKD causing sHPT can be far more challenging. The goal of therapy is
to maintain PTH levels in the acceptable range based on the stage of CKD in
order to prevent both renal osteodystrophy (high-turnover bone disease) due to
hyperparathyroidism and adynamic (low turnover) bone disease due to overly
suppressed PTH levels.
The initial goal is to decrease the calcium-phosphorus product to <55 mg2/dL2,
primarily by decreasing dietary uptake of phosphorus from the gut. In patients
with CKD, the goal for daily intake of phosphorus is <800 to 1000 mg/day, and
consultation with a dietitian is necessary to help patients achieve this goal.
Ultimately, most patients will require therapy with phosphorus-binding agents.
The aluminum-containing agents that were once used have been linked to
osteomalacia and encephalopathy and are now avoided. Currently, the
mainstays of therapy are inexpensive calcium-based binders such as calcium
carbonate and calcium acetate. Calcium acetate has the benefit of binding
more phosphorus with less calcium being absorbed per milligram of elemental
calcium than calcium carbonate. To minimize calcium absorption, the dose
should be limited to <2000 mg/day and titrated to the lowest dose needed to
maintain a PO4 level between 2.7 and 5.5 mg/dL (depending on the stage of
CKD).
However, recent data have now significantly called into question whether
calcium-based phosphate binders should be used. Sevelamer is a copolymer
that binds to dietary phosphate and prevents absorption. As compared to
sevelamer, calcium-based binders significantly reduce bone mass (over
suppression of PTH) and increase vascular calcification in CKD. Because of
the severe cardiovascular mortality associated with vascular calcification in
ESRD, non-calcium based phosphate binders such as sevelamer are seen as
preferable by many nephrologists.21,22
Once the levels of calcium and phosphorus are in an acceptable range, vitamin
D therapy may be necessary to lower PTH levels into the target range.
Calcitriol or one of its analogs can be used to stabilize or reduce PTH levels to
an acceptable range (the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes
Quality Initiative guidelines for iPTH are currently 150 to 300 pg/mL).
Newer analogs of vitamin D (doxercalciferol and paricalcitol) have less
calcemic and phosphatemic effects, but to date have not been proven to be more
effective or safer than calcitriol. Over suppression of PTH and attendant
258

negative impact on bone and vascular calcium accrual should be avoided.
Calcimimetics are a useful new therapy for hyperparathyroidism and have recently
been approved by the FDA for the treatment of sHPT in patients on dialysis.
Cinacalcet is the first available calcimimetic and has been shown to produce a
dose-dependent reduction in PTH as well as a decrease in the calcium–phosphate
product. The initial dose of cincalcet is 30 mg/day, and incremental BID dosing
increases can be made every 2 to 4 weeks to 60, 90, and 180 mg/day until goals
are achieved. Serum calcium and phosphorus should be measured within 1 week
and at frequent intervals during dose titration to monitor for hypocalcemia. Intact
PTH can be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in
dose.23
Surgical Management
Finally, surgical parathyroidectomy may become necessary in those with severe
sHPT.
The indications for parathyroidectomy are
Failure of maximal medical management with hypercalcemia, hypercalcuria,
PTH >800 pg/mL, hyperphosphatemia (with calcium-phosphorus product > 70
mg2/dL2), osteoporosis, and symptoms: pruritis, pathologic bone fracture,
ectopic soft tissue calcifications, severe vascular calcification, calcific uremia
arteriolopathy (a.k.a. calciphylaxis), or bone pain
Medical observation not possible
Patient preference

Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism
In patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism, medical treatment is not curative. The
mainstay of treatment for tertiary hyperparathyroidism is surgery.24
Surgical Management
Evidence-based recommendation is still lacking. However, some experts agree the
indications for parathyroidectomy in patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism
include the following:
Severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium >12 mg/dL)
Symptomatic hyperparathyroidism: fatigue, pruritis, bone pain or pathologic bone
fracture, peptic ulcer disease, mental status changes, history of renal calculi
Osteoporosis or high risk for osteoporotic fracture

259

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
The calcium level, phosphate, and PTH should be followed at least semi annually,
and creatinine measurements and bone density should be monitored annually.

Hypocalcemia
Prajesh M. Joshi and Michael P. Whyte
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hypocalcemia is a common problem with multiple etiologies.
Calcium homeostasis is essential for normal cell function, neural transmission,
membrane stability, bone structure, blood coagulation, and intracellular signaling.
Unrecognized or poorly treated hypocalcemic emergencies can lead to significant
morbidity or mortality.

Definition
Hypocalcemia is defined as serum ionized calcium <4.5 mg/dL or serum total
calcium <8.6 mg/dL with a normal serum albumin.
Normal reference range for serum total calcium is between 8.6 and 10.3 mg/dL
(2.15 to 2.58 mmol/L) and that for ionized calcium is 4.5 to 5.1 mg/dL (1.13 to
1.28 mmol/L).
Hypocalcemia can be classified into acute and chronic.

Epidemiology
Hypocalcemia is estimated to occur in up to 88% of patients in an intensive care unit
(ICU) and 26% of those admitted to a non-ICU facility.

Etiology
Causes for hypocalcemia can be broadly classified (see Table 23-1) into:
Inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) production (Hypoparathyroidism)
PTH resistance
Inadequate vitamin D
Resistance to vitamin D
Miscellaneous causes

262

Pathophysiology
Approximately 99% of body calcium is found in bone. Of the 1% that is found in
extracellular fluid, 50% is in the free (biologically active) ionized form, 40% is
bound to protein (predominantly albumin), and 10% is complexed with anions
(e.g., citrate or PO4).1
Variations in serum calcium levels depend upon serum pH, protein and anion
levels, and calcium-regulating hormone function.
Approximately 500 mg of calcium are removed from healthy bones daily and
replaced by an equal amount. Calcium absorbed by the intestines is matched by
urinary calcium excretion. Despite these large fluxes of calcium, serum levels of
ionized calcium remain stable because of the rigid control by PTH and vitamin D
levels and the vital role of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR).
TABLE 23-1 CAUSES OF HYPOCALCEMIA

263

Calcium-sensing Receptor
Changes in extracellular calcium levels are detected by a large extracellular
amino-terminal region of the CaSR, a 7-transmembrane receptor found upon the
cell membrane of parathyroid and kidney cells.
Binding of calcium to the CaSR induces activation of phospholipase C through the
G-protein signaling pathway. This leads to increases in free intracellular calcium
concentration and, in turn, reduces transcription of the PTH gene. Conversely, a
decrease in extracellular calcium increases PTH secretion.
CaSR also regulates calcium excretion by the kidneys.
Parathyroid Hormone
PTH is secreted by chief cells in the parathyroid gland in response to decreases in
ionized calcium.
It acts to maintain calcium levels by direct action on bone to promote resorption
and on the kidney to conserve calcium and excrete phosphate. It also indirectly
enhances intestinal calcium absorption by mediating renal production of the active
vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D, also referred to as
calcitriol).
Vitamin D
Vitamin D is derived from dietary sources or from conversion of cholesterol
precursors in the dermis by exposure to UV light.
Vitamin D is converted to more potent 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) by the
liver and then to the active form 1,25(OH)2D by PTH-regulated 1α-hydroxylase in
the proximal renal tubular cells.
Active vitamin D (calcitriol) stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium and
regulates PTH release.
To form vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), lightly pigmented individuals require at
least 10 minutes of sun exposure daily, whereas individuals with darker skin may
require longer exposure.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Ionized calcium levels, rather than serum total calcium primarily determine
symptoms due to hypocalcemia.1
Low extracellular fluid ionized calcium enhances neuromuscular excitability, an
264

effect accentuated by hyperkalemia or hypomagnesemia.1
Symptoms of hypocalcemia are more prominent and life-threatening when the
presentation is acute; chronic hypocalcemia may cause few, if any, symptoms.1
History
Patients with moderate to severe hypocalcemia often present with symptoms of
tetany that include circumoral paresthesias, distal extremity numbness and
tingling, and carpopedal spasm—the classic example of which is the main
d’accoucheur (midwife) posture. This involves adduction of the thumb, flexion of
the metacarpal joints, and flexion of the wrist.
Patients may also develop potentially life-threatening laryngeal stridor due to
laryngeal spasm.
CNS manifestations like seizures, irritability, confusion, and delirium can occur.
Children with chronic hypocalcemia may have mental retardation, and adults may
develop worsening dementia. Mental retardation is typically irreversible, but
dementia in adults can improve in 50% of cases with correction of hypocalcemia.
Calcification of the basal ganglia may result in movement disorders.2
Cardiac manifestations including syncope, congestive heart failure, and angina
occur in the acute setting.
Gastrointestinal symptoms include biliary colic, intestinal colic, and dysphagia
from smooth muscle contractions. Diarrhea and/or gluten intolerance may be seen
in cases of hypocalcemia that are due to malabsorption (e.g., from celiac sprue).
Chronic manifestations include cataracts, dry skin, coarse hair, brittle nails,
psoriasis, chronic pruritus, and poor dentition.
Related medical history may include pancreatitis, renal or liver failure,
gastrointestinal disorders, and hyperthyroidism or hyperparathyroidism.
Pertinent surgical history includes thyroid, parathyroid, or bowel surgeries or
recent neck trauma.
Inquiry should be made about administration of radiocontrast media, estrogen,
loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, denosumab, calcium supplements, antibiotics,
and anti-epileptics to exclude secondary hypocalcemia.
Family history of hypocalcemia may aid in the diagnosis of inherited conditions.
Physical Examination
The two classic physical examination findings include Chvostek’s sign and
Trousseau’s sign.
Chvostek’s sign is elicited by tapping the facial nerve 2 cm in front of the tragus
265

and observing for ipsilateral contraction of facial muscles. The sign is neither
sensitive nor specific and may be seen in normocalcemic individuals. If patients
are undergoing parathyroidectomy, a Chvostek’s sign should be elicited prior to
surgery to determine the reliability of this sign.
Trousseau’s sign is elicited by inflating a blood pressure cuff to 20 mm Hg above
the systolic blood pressure for 3 minutes and observing for main d’accoucheur
posturing of the hand. It is reported to have a better sensitivity and lower falsepositive rate compared to Chvostek’s sign.
Cardiopulmonary examination: S3 gallop and rales on auscultation suggests heart
failure. Wheezing and stridor might result from bronchospasm and laryngospasm.
Skin examination: impetigo herpetiformis, a form of acute pustular psoriasis, is
associated with hypocalcemia in pregnancy.
Features of Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) may be seen (please see
below for details).

Differential Diagnosis
Inadequate PTH Production (Hypoparathyroidism)
Hypoparathyroidism is defined as an inappropriately low secretion of PTH for
given ionized calcium. Characteristic laboratory findings of hypoparathyroidism
are hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia with normal renal function. Twentyfour-hour urinary excretion of calcium is low, as is the blood 1,25(OH)2D level.
Hypoparathyroidism may have a surgical, autoimmune, familial (genetic), or
idiopathic origin. All varieties share the same symptoms, although hereditary
hypoparathyroidism tends to have a gradual presentation.
Postoperative hypoparathyroidism
Postoperative hypoparathyroidism occurs on postoperative days 1 to 2 as a
complication of parathyroid and thyroid surgery, although may occur years after
the procedure. Patients undergoing thyroidectomy for Graves’ disease are more
likely to experience postoperative hypocalcemia than for other etiologies.3 The
incidence of hypoparathyroidism has been related more to the experience of the
surgeon than to the exact procedure performed.
In the setting of parathyroidectomy, use of the intraoperative PTH values has
been useful in predicting risk for developing postoperative hypocalcemia.4 A
combination of an early postoperative intact PTH (60 minutes postsurgery) <14
ng/mL and a serum calcium <8 mg/mL at 6 hours postoperative had 88%
specificity in predicting hypocalcemia in a retrospective study.5
266

Postoperative hypocalcemia may occur after multiple blood transfusions due to
calcium chelation by citrate preservative in the blood.
Postoperative hypocalcemia also results from “hungry bone syndrome” after
surgery for either primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism. It is caused by
rapid formation of calcium-containing hydroxyapatite crystals in the “hungry
bone” when PTH action suddenly stops. This can also be seen in the setting of
total thyroidectomy in patients with hyperthyroidism, or in treatment of longstanding metabolic acidosis.
Hungry bone syndrome can be distinguished from hypoparathyroidism by
measuring phosphorous and PTH levels. Phosphorus is low and the PTH
appropriately elevated in hungry bone syndrome.
Hypoparathyroidism associated with autoimmune destruction
The PTH gland destruction occurs either in isolation or as part of type 1
autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS1) (see Chapter 36).
APS1 can be sporadic or autosomal recessive, caused by mutations in the
autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene located on chromosome 21q22.3.
The destruction consists of the classic triad of hypoparathyroidism, adrenal
insufficiency, and mucocutaneous candidiasis, two of which (diagnostic dyad)
are required for diagnosis. The typical presentation is childhood candidiasis,
followed by hypoparathyroidism, and then adrenal insufficiency during late
childhood. The disease may also be associated with hypgonadism, hepatitis,
pernicious anemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroid disease,
alopecia, and vitiligo.6
Antibodies against a parathyroid autoantigen, NACHT leucine-rich-repeat
protein 5 (NALP5), which is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of
parathyroid chief cells, has been identified in 49% of APS1 with
hypoparathyroidism.7 Patients with APS1 and isolated autoimmune
hypoparathyroidism often have antibodies to CaSR. Although its role in the
pathogenesis of the disease is unclear, stimulation of CaSR has been
suggested.8
Hypoparathyroidism secondary to developmental disorders
This hypoparathyroidism results from agenesis or dysgenesis of the parathyroid
glands. This is often associated with the DiGeorge’s syndrome, in which
malformation of the third and fourth branchial pouches causes absence of the
thymus and parathyroids. The DiGeorge syndrome presents with CATCH-22
(cardiac anomalies, abnormal facies, thymic aplasia, cleft palate, and
hypocalcemia seen with a deletion in chromosome 22).
267

An autosomal dominant syndrome with hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renal
dysplasia (HDR) has been reported with presence of asymptomatic
hypocalcemia with undetectable or normal PTH.9 This has been shown to be
caused by mutations in the transcription factor GATA3.10
Radiation therapy and infiltration
Rarely, hypoparathyroidism has been described due to direct destruction of the
parathyroid glands in patients who are transfusion-dependent through iron
deposition, copper deposition in Wilson’s disease, and aluminum deposition in
dialysis patients. Infiltration of the gland by metastatic carcinoma,
granulomatous disease, or amyloidosis can also cause hypoparathyroidism, as
can extensive radiation to the neck and mediastinum.
Defect in CaSR receptor
Autosomal dominant hypocalcemic hypercalciuria occurs as a result of gain of
function mutation of gene encoding the CaSR leading to decrease in secretion of
PTH.11
Activating antibodies to the CaSR has been suggested as a pathogenesis in
autoimmune hypoparathyroidism.8
Similar effects are seen with use of calcimimetic agents, such as cinacalcet.
These agents bind to the CaSR and lower the threshold for its activation by
extracellular calcium. As a result, PTH release from parathyroid cells
decreases. Hypocalcemia has been described in up to 5% of these patients.
Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism
Rare cases of autosomal dominant familial isolated hypoparathyroidism have
been reported in association with mutation of preproparathyroid hormone
gene.12 Glial cells missing homolog B (GCMB), a transcription factor, is
essential for development of the parathyroid gland. Autosomal recessive
mutation in the gene encoding this molecule are uncommon cause of
hypoparathyroidism.13
PTH Resistance
Pseudohypoparathyroidism
This cluster of inherited disorders is caused by decreased end-organ responses
to PTH. The biochemical abnormalities mimic those of hypoparathyroidism
(i.e., low serum calcium, high phosphorus); however, the PTH level is
elevated.
There are multiple possible defects in the PTH–receptor complex; therefore,
there are several phenotypic presentations.
268

Pseudohypoparathyroidism is classified into types 1 and 2. Type 1 is further
subdivided into types 1a, 1b, and 1c.
Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1 is caused by deficiency of α subunit of Gs,
the signaling protein that couples PTH-receptor/adenylate cyclase complex
and yields cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a secondary
messenger in the cell. Patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1 do not
have a physiologic increase in cAMP in the urine after intravenous infusion
of PTH. The defect of the Gs-alpha protein is not confined to the effects of
PTH, but also affects other hormonal systems (e.g., resistance to glucagon,
thyroid-stimulating hormone, gonadotropins) that use cAMP as a second
messenger.
Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, the most common variant, presents
with the physical features of AHO, which include short metatarsals and
metacarpals, short stature, rounded facies, obesity, mental retardation, and
heterotopic ossification. The defect is due to mutation of the GNAS gene,
which encodes the Gs-alpha protein and is located on chromosome 20.
Inheritance of the disease is autosomal dominant, and the expression of the
gene is tissue specific and imprinted, with the maternal allele being
expressed in the kidney. Therefore, if one inherits the defective allele from
the mother, hypocalcemia is present. If the allele is inherited from the
father, there is the physical appearance of AHO, but serum calcium
homeostasis is maintained. This latter disorder is termed
pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.
Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b is characterized by a defective kidney
response to PTH. The patients do not have AHO; instead, they often have
skeletal findings consistent with hyperparathyroidism. These patients have
normal Gs-alpha protein, with hormonal resistance to PTH—an impaired
cAMP response to PTH, suggesting that the defect resides within the
receptor. The level at which the receptor is affected is not yet clear.
Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1c presents with resistance to PTH along
with multiple other hormones with physical features of AHO. A normal
Gs-alpha protein expression distinguishes this condition from
pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a. Molecular studies suggest that these
patients have GNAS mutations that result in functional defects of Gs-alpha
protein that are not apparent in conventional in-vitro assays.14
Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 2 patients respond to PTH administration
with an appropriate increase in urinary cAMP, but fail to increase urinary
phosphate, suggesting that the defect is located downstream to the generation
269

of cAMP. If the patient presents with hypocalcemia, hypophosphaturia, and
elevated immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, first rule out
vitamin D deficiency, which has a similar presentation. In patients with a
vitamin D deficiency, all parameters return to normal after vitamin D
administration. Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 2 is quite rare, with <50
cases having been described.15
Magnesium deficiency
Magnesium deficiency impairs PTH secretion from parathyroid glands or stops
PTH biosynthesis. PTH resistance occurs when serum magnesium
concentrations fall below 0.8 mEq/L (1 mg/dL or 0.4 mmol/L). Decreased PTH
secretion occurs in patients with more severe hypomagnesemia. Malabsorption,
diuretics, parenteral fluid administration, chronic alcoholism, and cisplatin
therapy are the most common causes of hypomagnesemia.
Hyypocalcemia secondary to hypomagnesemia is resistant to administration of
calcium and vitamin D.
Restoration of the calcium levels can occur only after the magnesium deficiency
is corrected. Levels of phosphorus are not elevated in patients with
hypomagnesemia (as found in hypoparathyroidism), which probably is related
to associated nutritional deficiencies.
These patients present with low or inappropriately normal PTH levels in the
presence of hypocalcemia.
Vitamin D Deficiency
Vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of hypocalcemia, which is caused
by several mechanisms: (a) decreased absorption of dietary calcium; (b)
decreased renal reabsorption of calcium; and (c) resistance to the osteoclastic
effects of PTH on bone.
In vitamin D deficiency and hypocalcemia, the compensatory increase in PTH
results in mild increases in serum calcium. However, this comes at the expense of
serum phosphate, since PTH increases phosphaturia. These combined effects lead
to a loss of bone mineralization and, if uncorrected, cause syndromes of rickets
and osteomalacia.
Rickets occurs in growing bone, typically in children, and results from
diminished calcification of cartilage at the physis. The typical presentation
involves bowing of the limbs and cupping of the costochondral junctions (the
rachitic rosary).
Osteomalacia occurs after growth plates close and has a clinical appearance
that may be difficult to distinguish from osteoporosis. Patients frequently have
270

hypophosphatemia.
Vitamin D deficiency may occur with inadequate exposure to sun, inadequate
dietary supply of vitamin D, or intestinal malabsorption of fatty acids.
Patients of darker skin pigmentation have decreased conversion of vitamin D2 to
calcidiol for a given amount of sunlight.
Dietary insufficiency may occur in those who live in areas where vitamin D
supplementation of dairy products is not standard practice. In addition, an
inadequate dietary intake may occur in the elderly or in breastfed infants of
vegetarian mothers.
Malabsorption may occur in patients with gastrojejunostomy, gastric resection, or
celiac disease causing deficiency. Liver disease with decreased synthetic function
can cause vitamin D deficiency from several sources: impaired 25-hydroxylation
of vitamin D, decreased bile salts with malabsorption of vitamin D, decreased
synthesis of vitamin D-binding protein, or other factors. Patients with chronic
pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency, and steatorrhea have malabsorption of
calcium and vitamin D.
Vitamin D Resistance
Patients with vitamin D–dependent rickets type 1, also known as pseudovitamin D
deficiency, have a genetic deficiency of 1α-hydroxylase. This condition is rare
and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion typically manifesting prior to 2
years of age. These patients have normal or elevated levels of 25(OH)D, and
calcitriol administration can correct the defect.
Vitamin D–dependent rickets type 2, also known as hereditary calcitriol resistant
rickets, involves typical symptoms of rickets as well as alopecia. It is inherited as
an autosomal recessive disease and is the result of a mutation in the vitamin D
receptor gene. These patients have high serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D and can be
treated with high doses of calcium as well as calcitriol. Calcium infusions are
required if the resistance is complete.
Miscellaneous Causes of Acute Hypocalcemia
Acute hyperphosphatemia can acutely lower calcium level, which is typically
seen in rhabdomyolysis or tumor lysis syndrome. Rapid release of phosphorous
from injured muscle cells or dying tumor cells can quickly complex calcium. This
can be compounded by the acute renal failure often associated with these
conditions.
In addition, malignancy can cause hypocalcemia as a result of osteoblast
activation in patients with blastic metastases from breast or prostate cancer via
271

deposition of calcium in the lesions.
Chelation of calcium by citrate (anticoagulant in banked blood or plasma),
lactate, gadolinium-based contrast material used in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI, gadodiamide and gadoversetamide), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) reduce serum ionized calcium concentrations, but not serum total calcium
concentrations. Calcium is also chelated in acute pancreatitis, most likely due to
the release of free fatty acids. The degree of hypocalcemia seen with pancreatitis
can be a prognosticator, with lower levels predicting a worse prognosis.
Most patients in the ICU do not have an identifiable cause of hypocalcemia.
Sepsis, especially if caused by gram-negative microorganisms, is associated with
hypocalcemia, via endotoxins. Mortality rates increase among patients with sepsis
and hypocalcemia.
Multiple medications cause hypocalcemia. Those that inhibit bone resorption
include calcitonin, plicamycin, gallium nitrate, and estrogens. Cimetidine
decreases gastric pH, slowing fat breakdown, which is necessary to complex
calcium for gut absorption. Anticonvulsants may stimulate microsomal enzymes
with resultant abnormal metabolism of vitamin D. Reports also show that
phenytoin interferes with the intestinal absorption of vitamin D. Patients on
anticonvulsant therapy may present with hypocalcemia, normal calcitriol levels,
and increased PTH levels.
An increasing number of cancer patients are being treated with intravenous
bisphosphonates for hypercalcemia or metastatic bone disease. In the setting of
severe vitamin D deficiency, these patients can develop symptomatic
hypocalcemia. This is most frequently reported with use of zoledronic acid, likely
due to both its potency and frequency of use. Use of intravenous bisphosphonates
is contraindicated in the setting of vitamin D deficiency; therefore, prior to use,
serum 25(OH)D level should be obtained.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory Evaluation
A patient with hypocalcemia should have his/her serum albumin quantified.
To correct the total serum calcium in the setting of hypoalbuminemia, use the
following equation:
Corrected Ca2+ = [4 – serum albumin (g/dL)] × 0.8 + serum Ca2+ (mg/dL)
Alternatively, one can measure serum ionized calcium directly. However, this test
272

is less reliable with a single measurement. It can be falsely elevated with
prolonged ischemia of the arm during acquisition of the serum sample.
Other tests should include measurement of serum phosphorus, intact PTH,
magnesium, creatinine, and vitamin D metabolites.
A low 25(OH)D level suggests vitamin D deficiency from poor nutritional intake,
lack of sunlight, or malabsorption. Low levels of 1,25(OH)2D in association with
high PTH suggest PTH resistance or failure to induce the 1 a-hydroxylase, as
observed in patients with chronic renal failure, vitamin D–dependent rickets type
1, and pseudohypoparathyroidism.
Urinary cAMP may help to differentiate hypoparathyroidism from
pseudohypoparathyroidism types 1 and 2.
Electrocardiography
The ECG finding of hypocalcemia includes prolongation of the QTc interval and
shortening of RR interval, all proportional to the degree of hypocalcemia.16,17
Imaging
Skeletal x-rays show rickets or osteomalacia with pathognomonic “Looser zones”
best observed in the pubic ramus, the upper femur, and the ribs.

TREATMENT
Treatment depends on the severity and rapidity of development of hypocalcemia.
Goals of treatment include alleviation of symptoms, correction of serum calcium to
acceptable level, and avoidance of hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia.
The indications for emergent correction of hypocalcemia include severe
symptomatic tetany, stridor due to laryngospasm and bronchospasm, or seizures.

Medications
Acute Hypocalcemia
This emergent condition is treated by replacing calcium intravenously with
either calcium gluconate or calcium chloride. A 10 mL solution of 10% calcium
gluconate (1 ampule) can be given over 10 minutes (rule of 10s) and can be
repeated once or twice; calcium chloride, if used, is equally effective. Patients
should be monitored using telemetry to detect cardiac arrthymias. The effect of
this bolus is transient, and prolonged intravenous therapy should follow.
For urgent, but non-emergent hypocalcemia, replacement with 1 mg/kg/hour of
273

elemental calcium as an intravenous piggyback can be administered over several
hours (10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate or 1 ampule = 93 mg elemental calcium).
As such, if 6 ampules of calcium gluconate are mixed in 500 mL of D5W, a drip
rate of 0.92 mL/kg/hour will provide 1 mg/kg/hour of elemental calcium.
Bicarbonate and phosphate solutions cause calcium to precipitate and should not
be run simultaneously. Serum calcium should be measured every 4 to 6 hours
during intravenous infusion and the rate adjusted to maintain a serum calcium
level of 8 to 9 mg/dL.
Chronic Hypocalcemia
Chronic management of hypocalcemia is accomplished using oral calcium salts,
vitamin D metabolites and less commonly thiazide diuretics. Magnesium
supplementation is needed for magnesium depletion.
The goal of chronic calcium replacement therapy is to keep the calcium in the
low range of normal, especially in hypoparathyroid states to avoid
hypercalciuria. Approximately 1.5 to 3 g of elemental calcium should be given as
a dietary supplement to ensure adequate intake. Supplementation should be given
with meals to increase absorption and prevent hyperphosphatemia. There are
multiple different preparations of oral calcium; in general, calcium carbonate is
the cheapest, although absorption may be less than with other products.
Vitamin D supplementation is typically given as ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). This
preparation is the least expensive and has the longest biological half-life. The
typical dose range for patients with hypoparathyroidism is on the order of 50,000
to 100,000 IU orally daily (1.25 to 2.5 mg/day). Serum 25(OH)D levels can be
measured along with serum calcium levels to assess for adequacy of treatment.
Vitamin D is extremely lipophilic and may require several weeks to reach a
steady state with a new dose. Calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D), which has rapid onset of
action and a shorter half-life (8 hours), may also be given with a typical starting
dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mcg orally daily.
Hypocalcemia Secondary to Hypoparathyroidism and Pseudohypoparathyroidism
Initial management is done with oral administration of calcium supplements,
however, in patients with severe hypoparathyroidism, treatment with calcitriol is
required due to lack of PTH-mediated conversion of inactive vitamin D
(25(OH)D) to active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D).
The aim in these patients is to maintain serum calcium at the lower end of the
normal range to avoid development of hypercalciuria with a risk of
274

nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis due to loss of the renal calcium-conserving
effect of PTH in hypoparathyroidism.
Teriparatide has been shown to be effective in treatment of long-term
hypoparathyroidism, but concerns about safety with long-term treatment have
prevented its chronic use.5 However, in the postparathyroidectomy setting, it
could be used to decrease hospitalization and expedite achievement of
normocalcemia.

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
In patients with a higher risk of developing permanent hypoparathyroidism,
parathyroid tissue may be autotransplanted into the brachioradialis or
sternocleidomastooid muscle at the time of parathyroidectomy.

COMPLICATIONS
The goal of treatment of chronic hypocalcemia is a low-normal serum calcium
level (8 to 8.5 mg/dL). If the calcium is kept below this level, the patient remains
at risk for symptoms of hypocalcemia or cataracts. A higher calcium level may
predispose patients to nephrolithiasis.
In chronic hypocalcemia, the calcium-phosphate product (calculated by
multiplying the calcium by the phosphate level) should be monitored. The goal is
a product <60 to avoid calciphylaxis. In addition, 24-hour urine calcium-tocreatinine ratio should be periodically checked for hypercalciuria. The ratio is
determined by dividing urine calcium by urine creatinine. The ratio should be
lower than 0.2; if it is higher, there is an increased risk of development of renal
stones, particularly calcium phosphate stones.
If hypercalcemia develops, vitamin D and calcium supplementation should be
withheld until levels return to normal. The doses should be decreased. The effects
of calcitriol typically last one week, but ergocalciferol can last more than 1
month.
Patients treated with teriparatide for long duration have a potential risk for
development of osteosarcoma.

PROGNOSIS
The prognosis for correcting hypocalcemia is good but is dependent upon the
etiology. Most symptoms can be alleviated. However, cataract or mental retardation
from long-standing hypocalcemia cannot be reversed.

Vitamin D Deficiency
Amy E. Riek, Ana Maria Arbelaez, and Carlos BernalMizrachi
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Physiology
Vitamin D is a nutrient and a pro-hormone largely regulated by environmental
factors, including diet and exposure to the sun.1,2
There are several nutritional forms of vitamin D: D3 (cholecalciferol), which is
generated in the skin of animals, and D2 (ergocalciferol), which is derived from
plants. In this chapter, any mention of vitamin D implies vitamin D2 or vitamin D3.
D2 and D3 are biologically inert. To become physiologically active, vitamin D
requires a first hydroxylation in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D,
and then a second hydroxylation in the kidney to its active hormonal form 1α, 25dihydroxyvitamin D, or 1,25(OH)2D.
The main role of vitamin D in the body is calcium and phosphorous homeostasis,
and deficiency of vitamin D is associated with negative balance of these minerals
and osteomalacia. However, more extensive roles for vitamin D are suggested by
the discovery of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the extrarenal production of
active vitamin D in almost all tissues in the body. These observations have
opened a new area of study in the physiologic and pharmacologic actions of
vitamin D.
Synthesis of Vitamin D
The skin is the main organ responsible for vitamin D production. Sunlight
exposure, especially ultraviolet B (UVB) photons between 290 and 315 nm,
causes photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC or provitamin D3) in skin to
form previtamin D3, which isomerizes into vitamin D3 proportionally to the
number of UVB photons that penetrate the epidermis.
Lengthy sun exposure does not produce toxic levels of vitamin D3 because sunlight
278

itself induces photodegradation of previtamin D3 and vitamin D3, thereby
regulating the total output in the circulation and preventing intoxication.
Vitamin D3 then binds to the vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and is transported in
the circulation.
Dietary Intake of Vitamin D
Vitamin D is fat soluble and principally absorbed in the proximal small intestine.
Absorption of dietary vitamin D requires bile salts and an intact absorptive
surface.
Enterocytes absorb vitamin D by passive diffusion and secrete it into the
lymphatics in the form of chylomicrons. Endothelial lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes
triglycerides from chylomicrons, producing chylomicron remnants that are rapidly
cleared via the liver. Most vitamin D is metabolized in this fashion.
Metabolism of Vitamin D
Once vitamin D enters the circulation from the skin or from the lymph via the
thoracic duct, it is rapidly stored in fat or metabolized in the liver. Fat stores of
vitamin D are used during the winter; however, obese individuals are only able to
increase their blood levels of vitamin D by half when compared with individuals
of normal weight.
The first step in the metabolic activation of vitamin D is hydroxylation of carbon
25, which occurs primarily in the liver. Several hepatic cytochrome P-450s have
been shown to 25-hydroxylate vitamin D compounds. CYP2R1, present in the
liver and in testis, appears to be the critical 25-hydroxylase involved in both
vitamin D3 and vitamin D2 metabolism. Mutations in the CYP2R1 gene have been
identified in patients with low 25(OH)D levels and rickets.
25(OH)D is the major circulating form of vitamin D and has a half-life in human
circulation of 10 days to 3 weeks. Hepatic 25-hydroxylation is poorly regulated.
Serum levels of 25(OH)D increase in proportion to cutaneous synthesis and
dietary intake of vitamin D, and thus represent the best indicator of vitamin
D status (Figure 24-1).
The second step in vitamin D activation is the formation of 1,25(OH)2D by 1αhydroxylase, mainly in the kidney. The half-life of 1,25(OH)2D in circulation of
humans is approximately 4 to 6 hours. A congenital defect in renal tubular 1αhydroxylase enzyme expression results in vitamin D–dependent rickets type I.
Numerous cells and tissues including prostate, breast, colon, lung, placenta,
pancreatic beta-cells, bone cells, activated immune cells, vascular wall and
279

parathyroid cells express 1α-hydroxylase and are able to transform 25(OH)D to
its active hormonal form. This increased local production of active vitamin D
serves as an autocrine–paracrine factor, which is fundamental for cell-specific
functions. The contribution of these extrarenal sources to circulating 1,25(OH)2D
levels is minimal and only occurs during pregnancy, chronic renal failure,
sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, granulomatous disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis.
Renal 1α-hydroxylase activity is highly regulated and functions to maintain serum
calcium at normal levels. Low plasma calcium stimulates this enzyme by inducing
parathyroid hormone (PTH) expression. Increased serum PTH enhances renal
production of 1,25(OH)2D directly by induction of 1α-hydroxylase expression and
indirectly by the hypophosphatemia resulting from PTH-induced renal phosphate
wasting. This compensatory event keeps the 1,25(OH)2D hormone concentration
nearly constant despite low levels of 25(OH)D. Elevated 1,25(OH)2D
concentrations can mislead physicians into thinking that patients are vitamin
D sufficient when they may be severely vitamin D deficient.
Vitamin D is excreted principally in the bile. Although some of it is reabsorbed in
the small intestine, the enterohepatic circulation of vitamin D is not considered to
be an important mechanism to sustain adequate levels. Vitamin D is also
catabolized to more water-soluble compounds, which are transported by DBP and
albumin and excreted by the kidney.
Catabolism of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D is carried out by 24-hydroxylase,
which catalyzes a series of oxidation steps resulting in side chain cleavage and
inactivation. The kidney is the major site of vitamin D catabolism.
1,24,25(OH)D or 24,25(OH)D compounds are generated in the kidney under
normal conditions; however, 24-hydroxylase is expressed throughout the body and
attenuates the cellular responses induced by 1,25(OH)2D. 1,25(OH)2D controls its
own degradation directly by stimulating 24-hydroxylase activity or indirectly by
reducing PTH levels.
FIGURE 24-1 Synthesis and effects of vitamin D.

280

In the plasma, vitamin D is transported bound to plasma proteins. More than 99%
of circulating vitamin D metabolites are protein-bound, mostly to DBP, and
minimally to albumin and lipoproteins. DBPs have the highest affinity for 25(OH)D
and 24,25(OH)2D and less affinity for 1,25(OH)2D. The levels of 1,25(OH)2D are
normally 1000 times lower than those of 25(OH)D. DBP may be reduced by liver
disease, nephrotic syndrome, or malnutrition. DBP may be increased during
pregnancy and estrogen therapy. Despite changes in DBP, the circulating
concentration of free vitamin D active hormone remains constant. Therefore, DBP
works as a buffer, preventing deficiency and/or intoxication of the active compound.
DBP also facilitates 25(OH)D entry into the proximal tubule cells by a receptormediated uptake of DBP in the brush border. Megalin facilitates the endocytosis of
the DBP and 25(OH)D complex. Once inside, 25(OH)D is released and is converted
into 1,25(OH)2D in the mitochondria by 1α-hydroxylase.

281

Molecular Actions of Vitamin D
The VDR is expressed in almost all human tissues. 1,25(OH)2D binds to the VDR,
which acts as a ligand-activated transcription factor to regulate the expression of
vitamin D–responsive genes. The VDR has a 100-fold affinity for 1,25(OH)2D
compared to 25(OH)D or other dihydroxy metabolites of vitamin D. Upon binding
to VDR, vitamin D forms a heterodimeric complex with the retinoic acid X
receptor, and the complex interacts with vitamin D–responsive elements on DNA
and promotes transcription of vitamin D–regulated genes.
Specific mutations in the VDR gene cause vitamin D–dependent rickets type II due
to 1,25(OH)2D resistance. Some VDR genetic variants are associated with
changes in mineral homeostasis, skeletal remodeling, and modulation of cell
proliferation.

Classification
Vitamin D status is usually estimated by measuring plasma 25(OH)D levels.
Evidence that healthy outdoor workers, farmers, and lifeguards have 25(OH)D
concentrations of 44 to 70 ng/mL suggest that an optimal healthy level may be higher
than the accepted levels reported to prevent rickets and osteomalacia, though the
majority of evidence to support this has been observational rather than
interventional. Newer biomarkers such as intestinal calcium absorption and maximal
PTH suppression have suggested that higher levels of 25(OH)D may be beneficial,
but the specific levels reported by various studies have not been consistent, and the
correlation of these levels in all age groups and races has not been tested. Therefore,
based upon the best available evidence regarding clinical outcomes, primarily
regarding bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk, the Institute of Medicine
recently recommended the following classification for vitamin D status.3 An
important concept is that most patients with suboptimal vitamin D levels are not
hypocalcemic.
Vitamin D Deficiency—25(OH)D levels <12 ng/mL.
Vitamin D Insufficiency—25(OH)D levels 12 to 20 ng/mL.
Vitamin D Adequacy—25(OH)D levels 20 to 50 ng/mL.
Vitamin D Toxicity—25(OH)D levels >150 ng/mL and hypercalcemia.4,5

Epidemiology
The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is dependent upon the definition of
deficiency, but appears to be widespread in all age groups. Latitude, time of day,
season of the year, and race have a dramatic influence on the cutaneous production
282

of vitamin D3 (see Section Etiology). Data from The National Health Nutrition and
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–2006 demonstrated 25(OH)D levels under 16
ng/mL (the median level of insufficiency) in 18.8% of those sampled: 10.6% of nonHispanic whites, 53.6% of non-Hispanic blacks, and 27.2% of Mexican Americans.6
The group at greatest risk includes African American men and women who live in
the northern latitudes throughout the year. A study in noninstitutionalized elderly men
and women in Boston (latitude 42°) during the winter showed vitamin D deficiency
[25(OH)D level <20 ng/dL] in 73% of blacks and 35% of whites, with severe
vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D level <10 ng/dL] in 21% of African American and
11% of white subjects.7

Etiology
Decreased bioavailability
Decreased fat absorption (malabsorption) resulting from cystic fibrosis, celiac
disease, Whipple’s disease, Crohn’s disease, gastric bypass surgery, or
medications that reduce cholesterol absorption.8
Obesity causing increased vitamin D deposits in fat but decreased
bioavailability for other tissues.
Increased catabolism
Anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, highly active anti-retroviral therapy
(HAART), and transplant antirejection medications.
Decreased synthesis of 25(OH)D
Liver cirrhosis (proportional to disease severity—25(OH)D <16 ng/mL found
in approximately 66% of patients with Child–Turcotte–Pugh class B or C and
96% of patients awaiting liver transplantation).9
Increased urinary loss of 25(OH)D
Nephrotic syndrome (via loss of 25(OH)D bound to DBP in urine).
Decreased synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) [via hyperphosphatemia-mediated decrease in
1α-hydroxylase activity in early stages, tubular destruction and reduced
substrate 25(OH)D availability in late stages, 25(OH)D <30 ng/mL present in
87.5% stage V CKD patients].10
Rickets
Heritable disorders (vitamin D–dependent rickets types I, II, III; X-linked
hypophosphatemic rickets; autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets;
autosomal-recessive hypophosphatemic rickets).
283

Acquired disorders: tumor-induced osteomalacia.
Increased conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D
Primary hyperparathyroidism [via PTH-induced tubular 1α-hydroxylase
acceleration of 25(OH)D to conversion; vitamin D insufficiency reported in
53% and vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <12 ng/mL) in 27%].11
Granulomatous disorders [sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and lymphoma; via
cytokine induction of macrophage 1α-hydroxylase, converting 25(OH)D to
1,25(OH)2D].
Accelerated metabolism
Hyperthyroidism

Risk Factors
In the absence of the disease states described above, any factor that impairs skin
production or dietary intake of vitamin D can contribute to vitamin D deficiency.
The median dietary intake of vitamin D varies from 160 IU/day to 396 IU/day for
various populations in the United States assessed by NHANES 2005–2006.12
Total-body sun exposure for 15 minutes easily provides 10,000 IU vitamin D per
day for a Caucasian adult, or 50 to 100 times the average food intake of vitamin
D.13 Therefore, food intake is not a critical source to maintain vitamin D levels in
those with adequate sun exposure.
Many factors reduce vitamin D synthesis in the skin, including time spent indoors,
use of sunscreens due to greater awareness of skin cancer, higher latitude, winter
season, higher melanin content of the skin, and age-related decline in epidermal 7DHC. For example, sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) of eight reduces
vitamin D3 production by about 98%. The concentration of previtamin D in the
skin reaches equilibrium in Caucasians within 20 minutes of UV exposure, but it
takes 3 to 6 times longer for dark-skinned people to reach the equilibrium
concentration.13
Therefore, the following environmental factors represent risk factors for vitamin D
deficiency in otherwise healthy people:
Premature birth
Pigmented skin
Low sunshine exposure
Breast-feeding
Use of sunscreen
Indoor activities
284

Obesity
Advanced age
Seasons
Latitudes further from the equator

Prevention
The most efficient way to maintain vitamin D levels is through moderate sun
exposure. As described above, total-body sun exposure for 15 minutes easily
provides 10,000 IU vitamin D per day for a Caucasian adult.13
Few commonly consumed foods are naturally good sources of vitamin D. Fish is
the primary natural food source of dietary vitamin D3; wild salmon (3.5 oz)
provides 600 to 1000 IU. The same amount of mackerel, sardine, or tuna fish
provides between 200 and 300 IU, whereas cod liver oil (1 tsp) provides
between 600 and 1000 IU and egg yolks 20 IU of vitamins D2 and D3. Few
sources of vitamin D2 are regularly eaten; sun-dried shiitake mushrooms provide a
good source of vitamin D2.5
In the United States, the major dietary source is fortified foods. For example, a
glass (8 oz) of fortified milk, orange juice, yogurt; 3 oz of fortified cheese; or a
serving of fortified breakfast cereal each provides 100 IU vitamin D3.5
Infants who are nourished exclusively by nursing must get vitamin D supplements
or sun exposure to ensure adequate intake because breast milk is a poor source of
this vitamin.

Associated Conditions
Bone Effects of Vitamin D
As a person becomes 25(OH)D deficient, intestinal absorption of calcium and
phosphorus decrease, serum ionized calcium levels drop, and a compensatory
synthesis and secretion of PTH is stimulated (secondary hyperparathyroidism).
Increased plasma PTH levels maintain serum calcium levels by enhancing renal
production of 1,25(OH)2D, by increasing bone turnover and bone loss, and by
promoting tubular calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion. Increased
1,25(OH)2D induces intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus and
stimulates osteoclast activity, which increases the availability of calcium and
phosphorus in the blood.8
Rickets or osteomalacia caused by deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or
285

phosphorus can impair normal mineralization of bone. In children, inadequate
mineralization of the osteoid and cartilage in the growth plates causes rickets, a
disease characterized by widening at the end of the long bones, prominent
costochondral junctions (rachitic rosary), deformations in the skeleton including
frontal bossing, and deformities of the lower limbs causing bowed legs and
knocked knees. In adults, failure to mineralize the bone matrix is termed
osteomalacia, a disease characterized by generalized bone pain, muscle
weakness, waddling gait, and pseudofractures, a classical radiologic feature
characterized by areas of cortical lucency with surrounding sclerosis in the long
bones.
Vitamin D–dependent rickets/osteomalacia
Nutritional rickets/osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency is most commonly
seen in infants with prolonged breast-feeding who do not receive vitamin D
supplementation or adequate exposure to sunlight. All infant formulas in the
United States are fortified with at least 400 IU/L of vitamin D. The American
Academy of Pediatrics recommends vitamin D supplementation to all infants
who receive <1 L (or 1 quart) of vitamin D–fortified formula to ensure total
daily intake of 400 IU.14 Nutritional rickets/osteomalacia is also seen in
elderly people with dark skin and with limited exposure to sunlight. Patients
will have low serum calcium and phosphorus and high PTH levels. In adults,
ergocalciferol doses of 50,000 IU weekly for 8 to 10 weeks along with
calcium supplementation of 1000 mg/day has been used for rickets
treatment.15 Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and urine
calcium/creatinine ratios are measured before and 4 weeks after initiation of
therapy, and every 3 months thereafter. Radiographs are obtained to
document healing of rachitic changes.
Vitamin D–dependent rickets type I, also called pseudovitamin D
deficiency rickets, usually manifests before 2 years of age. It has an
autosomal-recessive inheritance and is linked to chromosome 12q14. It is
caused by a defect in renal tubular 1α-hydroxylase enzymes that convert
25(OH)D into the active 1,25(OH)2D. Serum calcium levels are usually low
or normal, 25(OH)D levels are normal or high, 1,25(OH)2D levels are low,
and PTH is high secondary to hypocalcemia. Serum phosphorus is usually
low owing to high PTH and low 1,25(OH)2D levels. Treatment involves
replacement with calcitriol (1,25[OH]2D), and the aim of therapy is to
maintain serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and PTH levels
within normal limits.
Vitamin D–dependent rickets type II, also called hereditary vitamin D–
286

resistant rickets, is very rare. It has autosomal-recessive inheritance and is
associated with end-organ resistance to calcitriol, resulting from mutations in
the gene that encodes the VDR. Affected children are normal at birth, but
metabolic bone disease presents early within the first 2 years of life. Serum
calcium is low, PTH is high, 25(OH)D is normal to high, and 1,25(OH) 2D is
normal to high. Treatment involves high doses of calcitriol and calcium.
Long-term central venous infusion of calcium is an alternative for severely
resistant patients.
Vitamin D–independent rickets/osteomalacia
X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is an X-linked dominant genetic
disorder (Xp22). It is caused by a defect in PHEX (phosphate-regulating
endopeptidase), which lyses a circulating factor that causes renal phosphate
losses. Patients with this disorder also have defective 1,25(OH)2D synthesis
secondary to low levels of plasma phosphorus. Patients have low
1,25(OH)2D, low phosphorus, normal calcium, and normal PTH levels.
Treatment includes supplementation with phosphorus and vitamin D.
Autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets results from a mutation in
fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) that causes increased levels of this
phosphatonin leading to large renal losses of phosphate. FGF23 directly
inhibits renal 1α-hydroxylase and, therefore, 1,25(OH)2D synthesis. The
clinical manifestations and treatment are similar to X-linked
hypophosphatemic rickets.
Autosomal-recessive hypophosphatemic rickets results from a homozygous
mutation in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), which is made in the osteocytes.
DMP1 inhibits secretion or production of FGF23, and mutation results in
release of the inhibition of FGF23, thereby causing phosphaturia and
osteomalacia. Clinical features are similar to those of autosomal-dominant
rickets.
Tumor-induced osteomalacia is characterized by increased production of
phosphatonins by sclerosing tumors of mesenchymal origin. Patients have
increased renal phosphate losses and a compensatory rise in 1,25(OH)2D
synthesis. Treatment includes repletion of phosphorus, tumor resection, and
somatostatin analogs.
Hypophosphatemia with hypercalciuria is a result of an autosomalrecessive defect in type 2c Na-PO4 cotransport in the renal proximal tubule.
Patients have low phosphorus and a compensatory rise in vitamin D, which
causes increased intestinal calcium absorption and hypercalciuria. Treatment
287

includes phosphorous supplementation.
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a systemic disorder characterized by decreased bone mass and
microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and
increased susceptibility to fractures of the hip, spine, and wrist. Secondary
hyperparathyroidism has been proposed as the principal mechanism connecting
vitamin D deficiency with the pathogenesis of decreased BMD and
osteoporosis.
Despite the fact that higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with
higher BMD in all population subgroups (NHANES III), the ability of vitamin
D supplements to prevent fractures continues to be debated. Vitamin D and
calcium supplementation (1000 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D per
day) significantly reduced the risk of hip fractures by 43% and nonvertebral
fractures by 32% among 3270 postmenopausal women who were vitamin D–
deficient (mean 25(OH)D, 16 ng/mL) and increased 25(OH)D levels to 42
ng/mL after treatment.16 In a recent meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation
(700 to 800 IU) reduced hip fractures by 26% and nonvertebral fractures by
23%, compared to subjects without vitamin D supplementation.17 In contrast, a
subgroup analysis of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) reported that the
supplementation of 36,282 postmenopausal women for 7 years with vitamin D3
(400 IU) and calcium carbonate (1000 mg) failed to prevent hip fractures
despite slight improvement in hip BMD in the treated group when compared to
placebo. Several issues have been raised regarding this study that limit its
interpretation, including lower rates of adherence to therapy, higher calcium
intake at baseline in study participants, and perhaps the selection of a
suboptimal vitamin D3 supplement. In the WHI study, the serum 25(OH)D
increased by only ~2.8 ng/mL.18 The randomized trial of vitamin D and calcium
for the secondary prevention of osteoporosis related fractures in the elderly
(RECORD) showed no prevention of a second fracture for patients receiving
1000 mg/day of calcium and 800 IU/day of vitamin D3.19 However, multiple
questions have been raised altering the interpretation of these results. First, the
placebo group was allowed to receive calcium and vitamin D regardless of the
intervention. Second, there was poor compliance with the regimen. Reports of
compliance in the first year were 60% and 47% in the second year. Third, the
achieved mean 25(OH)D concentrations were only 24.8 ng/mL in the vitamin D
treatment group. When hip fractures were shown to improve with vitamin D, the
optimal fracture prevention occurred when 25(OH)D concentrations achieved
were 36 to 40 ng/mL. These concentrations were reached only in trials that
288

gave 700 to 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 to subjects with mean baseline
concentrations between 17 and 31 ng/mL. Therefore, optimal fracture
prevention may require intakes of >700 to 800 IU/day vitamin D3 in
populations with baseline 25(OH)D concentrations <17 ng/mL.17,20
Non-calcemic Actions of Vitamin D
A growing body of evidence from both rodent models and humans suggests that
maintaining optimal vitamin D stores is important for overall health and not just
bone health. Although much of the data are correlational at this point, the weight
of the evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may lead to worsening of
known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The outcomes of prospective
randomized controlled clinical trials will be essential.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)
The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is higher in women with type 2 diabetes.
Analysis of NHANES III and the Workforce Diabetes Study confirmed that
patients with 25(OH)D levels >30 ng/mL have about one-third the risk of
developing diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance when compared with those
with vitamin D levels <24 ng/mL.21,22 Studies in rodents have suggested that
vitamin D deficiency may lead to impaired insulin secretion and to insulin
resistance. In humans, the insulin sensitivity index, as assessed by
hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic clamps, improves in direct relationship with
ambient levels of vitamin D; moreover, interventional studies in vitamin D–
deficient subjects have shown improved insulin sensitivity in glucose-intolerant
subjects after replacement of vitamin D.23 However, several interventional
trials found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on glucose metabolism.24,25
Type 1 diabetes mellitus
Type 1 DM is recognized as a T-cell–mediated autoimmune disease. Vitamin D
compounds are known to suppress T-cell activation and to alter the antigenpresenting capacity of macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as modulate
their cytokine release. These actions may protect beta cells against autoimmune
injury. Several epidemiologic studies have described a correlation between
geographic latitude and the incidence of type 1 diabetes.26 A previous study has
shown that 25(OH)D levels are lower in patients newly diagnosed with type 1
diabetes compared to healthy controls. The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the
Young (DAISY) reported that the presence of autoantibodies to islet cells
inversely correlated with maternal dietary vitamin D intake during pregnancy.
In addition, in patients with rickets, the incidence of childhood diabetes is 3
times higher than the incidence in healthy children.27 Case-control studies have
289

shown that treatment of children with 400 IU or less vitamin D per day did not
reduce the risk of developing type 1 DM.28 However, the only prospective
study based on the assessment of vitamin D intake during infancy (of 10,821
children) showed that vitamin D supplementation in infants with doses of 2000
IU/day for a year decreased the risk of developing type 1 DM by 80% by the
age of 30 years.29 Additional studies are needed to determine whether vitamin
D should be started during pregnancy and to determine the ideal vitamin D
doses without side effects.
Hypertension
Interventional studies suggest that vitamin D replacement decreases blood
pressure. In an 8-week treatment study consisting of oral calcium and vitamin
D3 replacement in elderly women with vitamin D deficiency, plasma 25(OH)D
levels increased to ≥25 ng/mL and systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased
significantly, by 13 mm Hg, compared with the calcium-only treated control
group.30 UVB exposure by skin-tanning sessions increased plasma 25(OH)D
levels to 40 ng/mL and decreased blood pressure in mildly hypertensive
patients.31 However, oral administration of 1,25(OH)2D has not shown
consistent blood pressure effects, possibly due to discrepancies in the
population plasma vitamin D status, as well as different vitamin D doses and
duration of the vitamin D replacement.
Vitamin D suppresses the renin–angiotensin system. In animal models, vitamin
D downregulates renin gene promoter activity independent of calcium
metabolism. Mice lacking the VDR exhibit hypertension and cardiac
hypertrophy due to increased renin expression and plasma angiotensin II
production.32 Oral administration of vitamin D in spontaneously hypertensive
rats decreased blood pressure as well as improved endothelial cell–dependent
vasodilation.33,34 In humans, there is an inverse relationship between vitamin D
levels and plasma renin levels. Interventional studies with oral synthetic
vitamin D replacement lowered plasma renin in nondiabetic vitamin D–
deficient patients.35 This evidence supports the conceptual relationship
between vitamin D and the renin–aldosterone system in essential hypertension
and the beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure.
Cardiovascular disease
Vitamin D not only alters the hormones involved in the pathophysiology of
hypertension and diabetes, but it also has a direct effect on the vasculature. The
expression of VDRs and the activation of vitamin D by the 1α-hydroxylase
enzyme in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells suggest the importance
of vitamin D in vascular cell metabolism.36,37 Vitamin D deficiency is more
290

prevalent in patients with peripheral vascular disease, and vitamin D levels are
inversely correlated with vascular resistance in hypertensive patients.
Cardiovascular events are more prevalent during winter months and at
increased geographic latitudes where average serum vitamin D levels are the
lowest.38
Epidemiologic studies have found an association between vitamin D
insufficiency, reflected by low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, and higher
rates of CVD morbidity39,40 and mortality.41–43 Controversy regarding the
effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular disease stems from several
interventional trials including the WHI.44,45 In a randomized controlled trial,
2686 men and women aged 65 or older were randomly assigned to receive
either 100,000 IU of oral vitamin D every 4 months or matching placebo (an
average of 833 IU/day). After 5 years of followup, there were no significant
differences in the incidence of ischemic heart disease or stroke. In the WHI,
36,282 postmenopausal women were randomized to vitamin D (400 IU) and
calcium carbonate (1000 mg) daily versus placebo for 7 years. The intervention
failed to prevent coronary or cerebrovascular disease when compared to those
in the placebo group. As mentioned above, however, there were limitations to
this study and well-designed medical trials with appropriate doses of vitamin
D supplementation are required to clarify the effects of vitamin D in
cardiovascular disease.46–48
Immunity
The VDR is present in macrophages and T lymphocytes. 1,25(OH)2D acts as an
immune system modulator, preventing excessive expression of inflammatory
cytokines and increasing the “oxidative burst” potential of macrophages.49 Most
importantly, vitamin D stimulates antimicrobial peptides (cathelicidin and betadefensin 2) that exist in neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer cells, and in
epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, where they play a major role in
protecting against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. African Americans, known to
have increased susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB), are reported to have low
serum levels of 25(OH)D and inefficient induction of cathelicidin expression.
Adding vitamin D to serum from African Americans increased cathelicidin
production by macrophages and accelerated rates of TB-microbe killing.
Cathelicidin and beta-defensin 2 display broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity,
including antiviral activity, and have been shown to inactivate the influenza
virus.50 Volunteers inoculated with live attenuated influenza virus during winter
are more likely to develop fever and serologic evidence of an immune response
compared to those inoculated during summer, suggesting a correlation between
291

vitamin D levels and the recurrent seasonality of the influenza epidemics.51
Increased vitamin D levels by UV radiation and cod liver reduces the incidence
of respiratory infections in children.52 This suggests that differences in the
ability to produce vitamin D may contribute to susceptibility or resistance to
microbial infection.
Antiproliferative effects
The active vitamin D metabolite, in addition to regulating calcium–phosphate
homeostasis and bone mineralization, induces in vitro cell cycle arrest,
differentiation, and apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells.53 Patients with
genetic VDR polymorphisms, specifically the Bsm I genotype bb, have twice
the incidence of colon, prostate, and breast cancer. The VDR FokI
polymorphism modifies prostate cancer risk; men with the less functional FokI
ff genotype are more susceptible to this cancer in the presence of low 25(OH)D
levels.54
The Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a prospective cohort study, found a
17% reduction in total cancer incidence and a 29% reduction in total cancer
mortality for every 10 ng/dL increase in serum 25(OH)D level.55 However,
data from NHANES III did now show any association between 25(OH)D level
and total cancer mortality.56 Results from several interventional trials with
osteoporosis as the primary outcome and cancer risk determined by secondary
analysis of safety data have been conflicting, but these have all relied upon
subjects notifying the investigators of their diagnosis. Therefore, interventional
trials of vitamin D with cancer risk and cancer mortality as a primary outcome
are needed to clarify this possible relationship.
In colon cancer, the evidence of an association with vitamin D is substantial.
Most studies that have examined circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and
subsequent risk of colorectal cancer or adenoma found a lower risk associated
with higher 25(OH)D concentrations. In the recent analysis of the Nurses’
Health Study, colon cancer risk negatively correlated with 25(OH)D
concentrations; patients with 25(OH)D concentrations of 39.9 ng/mL had
approximately half the relative risk (RR) of developing colon cancer (RR,
0.53; confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 1.04) compared to patients with levels
<16 ng/mL. Benefit from higher 25(OH)D concentrations was observed for
older women with cancer at the distal colon and rectum, but was not evident for
those at the proximal colon. In a prospective study of 1954 men, vitamin D
intake of 233 to 652 IU/day decreased the relative risk of developing colon
cancer by half compared to men with a vitamin D intake <6 to 94 IU/day. The
WHI found that women at enrollment who had low blood vitamin D levels
292

(<12.4 ng/mL) had a greater than two-fold risk of bowel cancer compared to
those with vitamin D levels >23.4 ng/mL, but there was no evidence that
treatment with calcium (1000 mg/day) and vitamin D (400 IU/day) reduced
bowel cancer occurrence over the 7 years of follow-up.54,57–59 Based on these
and previous studies, the estimated optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations
associated with reduced incidence of colonic adenomas are 30 to 35 ng/mL,
though further interventional trials are needed.
In prostate cancer, epidemiologic and laboratory data support the role of
vitamin D in the growth and differentiation of human prostatic cells.60 In a
Finnish study, prostate cancer incidence was assessed in 18,966 men, ages 40
to 57, over 14 years. Those with 25(OH)D levels below 16 ng/mL had a 70%
higher incidence rate of prostate cancer than those with levels 16 ng/mL or
above. For younger men with 25(OH)D levels below 16 ng/mL, the incidence
of prostate cancer was 3.5 times higher than for those with levels of 16 ng/mL
or above, and the incidence of invasive cancer was 6.3 times higher. A few
small phase II trials showed evidence that 1,25(OH)2D alone or in combination
with antimitotic chemotherapy decreases prostate cancer progression, but
further studies are needed.
In breast cancer, combined analysis of 1760 women from two trials reporting
risk of breast cancer by quintiles of 25(OH)D showed that a 50% reduction of
breast cancer risk was associated with 25(OH)D levels of 50 ng/mL compared
to those with levels of 10 ng/mL.61 In addition, women in the lowest quartile of
serum 1,25(OH)2D had a risk of breast cancer 5 times higher than those in the
highest quartile.62 Low 1,25(OH)2D levels were also associated with faster
progression of metastatic breast cancer.63 Animal studies confirmed that
1,25(OH)2D inhibits breast cancer, but interventional studies in humans are still
pending.64
Myopathy
Muscle weakness is a common clinical feature in patients with vitamin D
deficiency. It may affect fracture risk by altering the susceptibility to falls.
Combined evidence from five studies including 1237 patients showed that
vitamin D intake reduced the risk of falling by 22% (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to
0.92). In a recent double-blinded study, elderly ambulatory subjects taking 700
IU vitamin D plus 500 mg calcium had a 46% decreased risk of falling
compared to those taking placebo. Fall reduction was most pronounced in less
active women. Poor physical performance and a greater decline in physical
performance in 1234 older men and women were found when serum 25(OH)D
concentrations were below 20 ng/mL. Hypovitaminosis D myopathy may be
293

present even before biochemical signs of bone disease develop. Full
normalization of hypovitaminosis D myopathy demands high-dose vitamin D
treatment for 6 months or more. There is also evidence that idiopathic low back
pain in patients with vitamin D deficiency markedly improves when levels are
restored. Low levels of 25(OH)D are also common in patients with
fibromyalgia and chronic refractory nonspecific musculoskeletal pain.20
Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory
diseases and affects about 1% of the population in the United States.
Epidemiologic studies have reported low serum levels of vitamin D and its
metabolites in patients with RA.65 Small interventional studies in RA with
high-dose oral alfacalcidol (form of vitamin D) therapy showed a positive
effect on disease activity in 89% of the patients, and only 11% of patients
showed no improvement.66 In psoriatic arthritis, oral administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 showed an improvement in disease symptoms.67 In the Iowa Women’s
Health Study, women who received less <200 IU of vitamin D in their diets
each day were 33% more likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis than women
who received more.65 These results provide evidence that VDR ligands can be
of potential clinical use for the treatment of RA.
Multiple sclerosis
Epidemiologic data correlate the geographic location and the prevalence of MS.
In women, the Nurses’ Health Study and Nurses’ Health Study II results confirm
a protective effect of vitamin D on the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). The
relative risk of developing MS was decreased by 60% when comparing women
with an intake of ≥400 IU/day with women not taking supplemental vitamin
D.68,69 No prospective studies have addressed this hypothesis.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
The majority of cases of vitamin D deficiency are largely asymptomatic unless
severe enough to lead to rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults.
Therefore, clinical suspicion should be high in any patient presenting with
comorbid diseases or environmental factors that place them at higher risk for
vitamin D deficiency (see Sections Etiology and Risk Factors).

294

Physical Exam
Physical exam is typically unremarkable unless progression to rickets or
osteomalacia has occurred (see Section Associated Conditions).

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
25(OH)D is the major circulating form of vitamin D and serum levels increase in
proportion to cutaneous synthesis and dietary intake of vitamin D, thus
representing the best indicator of vitamin D status. Classification of vitamin D
status is described in Section Classification.
Previous reports suggest that IDS RIA or ADVANTAGE CPBA system assays for
25(OH)D might not detect vitamin D2 levels, which will give misleading results
and could lead to misdiagnosis and subsequent dangerous consequences for the
patient. Lab-specific assay characteristics should be verified prior to
treatment.70,71

TREATMENT
Medications
The vitamin D dose depends on the target concentration of 25(OH)D desired. New
clinical research indicates that the vitamin D intake used to prevent rickets is
much lower than the requirement for prevention of osteoporosis related bone
fractures, cancer, and improvement of the metabolic abnormalities described
previously. However, the ideal oral intake of vitamin D that provokes healthy
effects without side effects has not been completely elucidated.
Vitamin D is available in two forms for supplementation: ergocalciferol (vitamin
D2) made from yeast fat exposed to UV light and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)
obtained from animal fat. Some data has shown that vitamin D2 is one-third less
potent than vitamin D3 and has a shorter duration of action relative to vitamin D3
(<14 days).72 However, recent evidence found that a daily dose of 1000 IU of
vitamin D2 daily was as effective as 1000 IU of vitamin D3 in maintaining 25hydroxyvitamin D3 levels.73 The half-life of 25(OH)D in the circulation is
reported to be approximately 1 month in humans. Conventional pharmacology
indicates it should take at least four half-lives before a drug’s equilibrium is
achieved.4 Increased responsiveness to vitamin D administration is seen more in
thin patients with low vitamin D levels at baseline using low vitamin D doses and
295

long duration of vitamin D supplementation. An increased dose of vitamin D does
not increase the plasma 25(OH)D levels proportionally. Previous studies indicate
that 75% or more of the molecules of vitamin D that enter to the body are
catabolized and excreted without becoming 25(OH)D. Generally, 100 IU/day for
8 months increases 25(OH)D levels by 1 ng/mL.4
The current recommendations, based on the assumption that young and middleaged adults are more likely than older adults to be exposed to sunlight, are as
follows: 400 IU/day for infants, 600 IU/day for children and adults up to age
70 years, and 800 IU/day for those older than 70 years. These doses are
adequate to reach the current recommended 25(OH)D level of 20 ng/mL in the
majority of adults. Subgroups of the population such as obese individuals,
pregnant women, and patients with nephrotic syndrome and chronic renal failure
require 1000 to 2000 IU of vitamin D3 daily or 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 every 2
weeks to prevent vitamin D deficiency during the winter months. The Food and
Nutrition Board guidelines specify 4000 IU vitamin D3 as the highest vitamin D
intake that healthy adults can consume without risking toxicity.3
In the United States, the only pharmaceutical preparation of vitamin D is vitamin
D2. The recommended dose of ergocalciferol to treat vitamin D deficiency is
50,000 IU every week for 8 weeks. If the patient does not achieve 25(OH)D
levels >30 ng/mL, then another 8 weeks of therapy is recommended. If the
25(OH)D levels are >30 ng/mL, then follow with maintenance therapy of 50,000
IU every other week or once a month depending on the etiology of the vitamin D
deficiency. In patients with obesity, nephrotic syndrome, or malabsorption, or in
patients taking anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, HAART (AIDS treatment), and
transplant antirejection medications, ergocalciferol loading doses (50,000
IU/week) should be administered for longer periods (8 to 12 weeks). If 25(OH)D
levels are still <30 ng/mL after a loading dose, repeat for another 8 to 12 weeks
of treatment. Maintenance doses in this special subgroup of patients should be
50,000 IU every week or every other week.5
Another way to replace vitamin D is to administer it as a single large dose, either
orally or through injection. This approach, known as stoss therapy, should be
closely monitored by an experienced physician.74

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Sun exposure very efficiently forms vitamin D3. In summer months, total-body sun
exposure for 15 to 30 minutes in Caucasian adults generates about 250 mcg (10,000
IU) of vitamin D3/day, with no signs of vitamin D–induced intoxication. In a
296

randomized control study in a psychogeriatric nursing home, exposure to UV
irradiation with half of the minimal erythematous dose on 1000 cm2 of the back 3
times per week for 12 weeks increased plasma 25(OH)D to the same levels as those
who received oral 400 IU/day of vitamin D3. Exposure of face, forearms, and hands
(total exposed skin area was 426 ± 32 cm2) to sunlight for 15 minutes and calcium
supplementation may be safe and effective in increasing BMD and reducing the risk
of fracture in chronically hospitalized elderly women with Alzheimer’s disease.
Most tanning beds emit 2% to 6% UVB radiation. In patients with malabsorption,
tanning-bed exposure is a potential source of vitamin D supplementation.5

COMPLICATIONS
Multiple medications can interact with vitamin D. Cholestyramine, Colestipol,
mineral oil, Orlistat, and Olestra (a fat substitute) reduce vitamin D absorption.
Administration of ketoconazole 300 to 1200 mg daily in healthy men for 7 days
decreased serum 1,25(OH)2D levels. Anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, HAART
(AIDS treatment), and transplant antirejection medications activate the destruction
of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D to inactive compounds.
Hypersensitivity to vitamin D supplementation can occur in patients with primary
hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, TB, or lymphoma. In primary
hyperparathyroidism, production of 1,25(OH)2D is persistently upregulated by
high PTH concentrations, and 1,25(OH)2D concentrations correlate directly with
serum 25(OH)D. However, the current data provide preliminary evidence that
vitamin D repletion in patients with mild primary hyperparathyroidism does not
promote an increase in serum calcium and has beneficial effects by decreasing
PTH levels and bone turnover. 11 We recommend assessment of plasma calcium
and urinary calcium/creatinine ratio (see Section Monitoring) in the first 2 weeks
of the vitamin D replacement and then monthly during replacement.
Vitamin D toxicity
Toxicity is extremely rare and generally occurs by accidental or uninformed
consumption of very high doses of vitamin D. Toxicity occurred with ingestion
of more than 40,000 IU/day, which reflects 4 times the maximum vitamin D
(10,000 IU) acquired by sunshine exposure. Concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D are
not increased by vitamin D intoxication but free 1,25(OH)2D levels are
generally high.3,75
Hypercalcemia (>11 mg/dL) is the main criterion for vitamin D–induced
toxicity. The clinical manifestations include anorexia, nausea and vomiting,
297

hypotonicity, lethargy, constipation, generalized pain, conjunctivitis, fever,
chills, thirst, and weight loss. Hypercalcemia can result in a loss of the urinary
concentrating mechanism of the kidney tubule, resulting in polyuria and
polydipsia. The prolonged ingestion of excessive amounts of vitamin D and the
accompanying hypercalcemia can result in metastatic calcification of soft
tissues—including the kidney, blood vessels, heart, and lungs—and increased
risk for nephrolithiasis.
The only treatment for vitamin D toxicity is to decrease the hypercalcemia by
forcing a negative calcium balance. Glucocorticoids, intravenous saline,
furosemide, calcitonin, or a bisphosphonate has been used. Because vitamin D
is stored in fat, vitamin D intoxication may persist for weeks after vitamin D
ingestion is terminated. The elimination half-life of vitamin D is about 3 weeks
to 1 month. Persistent treatment with corticosteroid or an oral bisphosphonate
for this period is required.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
The most sensitive clinical index of safety during vitamin D replacement is
measurement of urinary calcium. This is measured by morning calcium-tocreatinine ratio (normal values are <1 mmol/mmol or <0.35 mg/mg in a wellhydrated patient). An elevated calcium-to-creatinine ratio increases the risk for
nephrolithiasis, and increased caution in replacement dosing, hydration, and
monitoring should be exercised. However, hypercalciuria cannot be excluded if the
urinary creatinine concentration is >40 mg/dL.76 Given that during vitamin D
replacement serum 25(OH)D is at the plateau concentration by 1 month, we suggest
an assessment of serum calcium and urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio 2 to 4 weeks
after starting vitamin D replacement therapy. We recommend repeating these studies
monthly for 1 or 2 months because the plateau of 25(OH)D concentration may be
slightly underestimated in some cases.

Osteoporosis
Amy E. Riek, Kathryn Diemer, and Roberto Civitelli
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder in humans, and the
spectrum of osteoporosis and low bone mass affects more than 43 million people
in the United States1 and 200 million worldwide.2 Approximately 2 million
osteoporotic fractures occur each year in the United States, with significant
associated morbidity and mortality, particularly related to hip fractures, and
economic costs are projected to reach $25 billion by 2025.3
Significant advances in diagnostic testing since the early 1990s have made
osteoporosis relatively easy to diagnose. Multiple pharmacotherapeutic agents are
available that enhance bone density and decrease the rates of fracture at various
clinical sites.
A significant percentage of patients with osteoporosis, including those who have
already experienced fractures, are not appropriately diagnosed and treated.

Definition
Osteoporosis, which literally means “porous bone,” is a disorder characterized by
low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone that leads to a decrease
in bone mass, enhanced bone fragility, and a consequent increase in the risk of
fractures.4

Classification
Clinically, osteoporosis may be diagnosed on the basis of any fragility or lowtrauma fracture (fall from standing height or less or a bone that breaks under
conditions that normally would not cause fracture), regardless of bone mineral
densitometry testing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has established osteoporosis by criteria
based on bone densitometry testing. The T-score is the difference, in standard
deviation units, between a patient’s bone mineral density (BMD) and that of a
young adult reference mean (see Bone Mineral Density Testing in this chapter).
304

Diagnostic categories are based on the lowest T-score out of the lumbar spine,
total hip, and femoral neck (not individual vertebrae or Ward’s triangle).5
Normal: BMD within 1 SD of the young adult reference mean (T ≥ –1.0)
Low bone bass (“osteopenia”): BMD between 1 and 2.5 SDs below the young
adult reference mean (–2.5 < T < –1.0)
Osteoporosis: BMD ≥ 2.5 SDs below the young adult reference mean (T ≤ –
2.5)
Established or severe osteoporosis: BMD ≥ 2.5 SDs below the young adult
reference mean (T ≤ –2.5) and the presence of one or more fragility fractures
The WHO classification was established in postmenopausal women and thus does
not apply to premenopausal women or younger men (but can be applied to
perimenopausal women and men >50 years). In premenopausal women and men
<50 years, the diagnosis of osteoporosis cannot be made based on BMD alone,
and these patients should have their bone density classified by Z-scores
(compared to age-matched reference mean).6
“Within the expected range for age”: BMD within 2.0 SDs of the reference
mean (Z > –2.0)
“Below the expected range for age”: BMD ≥ 2.0 SDs below the reference
mean (Z ≤ –2.0)
T-scores should be based on a Caucasian, gender-specific reference mean, and Zscores should be based on a gender- and race-specific reference mean.6

Epidemiology
Approximately 8 million women and 2 million men in the United States have
osteoporosis, and an additional 34 million have low bone mass and are at risk for
the development of osteoporosis.1
The prevalence of low bone mass and progression to osteoporosis increases with
age, from 54% and 4%, respectively, in women age 50 to 59 years, to 43% and
52% in those age 80 to 85 years.7
There are racial/ethnic differences in prevalence as reported on older women from
recent NHANES 2005–2006 data, with low bone mass and osteoporosis reported
in 52% and 11%, respectively, of non-Hispanic white older women, 36% and 7%
of non-Hispanic black women, and 38% and 10% of Mexican American women.8

Pathophysiology
Total bone mineral content in adults is dependent on peak bone mass achieved
305

during early adulthood and level of bone remodeling. Bone remodeling takes
place throughout childhood and adulthood and is a result of the balance of
concurrent bone resorption and new bone formation. Osteoporosis can result from
either inadequate bone mass accrual in the first 2 to 3 decades of life and failure
to achieve expected peak bone mass or from increased bone remodeling and bone
loss with age.9
Peak bone mass is generally reached at approximately age 25 to 30 and is
primarily determined by genetic factors, including race and gender. However,
potentially modifiable environmental and metabolic conditions, such as nutritional
status, calcium intake, physical activity level, tobacco use, hormonal deficiencies,
and other medical comorbidities, can also affect the level of peak bone mass
achieved.9
Black women and men typically achieve higher levels of peak bone mass than
white women, which is a key contributor to the lower rates of osteoporosis and
fractures in these groups. Men typically have a BMD that is 8% to 18% greater at
different sites than women. However, such difference is in most part accounted
for by the fact that male bones are larger than female bones, resulting in higher
BMD values, as detected by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Adults
who do not achieve their predicted peak bone mass are at risk of developing
osteoporosis at an earlier age.9
When the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation, the overall
increased rate of bone turnover leads to a net loss of bone mass. Men and women
slowly begin to lose peak bone mass at a rate of ~0.5% to 1% per year starting at
approximately age 35. The rate of net bone loss is increased after menopause in
women, as estrogen deficiency enhances osteoclast activity via loss of estrogen
inhibition of osteoclastogenic factors. This accelerated rate of bone loss is most
prominent in areas of trabecular bone, such as the spine, and may result in a rate
of loss of bone mass of 3% to 5% per year for up to 10 years. The rate of bone
loss in areas with more cortical bone, such as the hips, tends to be delayed and
less rapid. Because men achieve a higher peak bone mass initially and do not
usually go through a rapid period of bone loss, in the absence of secondary
disorders, bone loss does not tend to reach levels that increase the risk for
fractures until age 65 to 70.9

306

Risk Factors
Multiple risk factors have been shown to be independently associated with low
bone mass (Table 25-1). Some of these risk factors are modifiable and are
important to address in a regimen to prevent or treat osteoporosis.10
There are also many chronic medical conditions and medications that are risk
factors for causing secondary osteoporosis (Table 25-2).10
Osteoporotic fractures typically result from falls in adults with low bone density.
As such, risk factors for falling independent of those for low bone mass are
important contributors to morbidity from osteoporotic fractures (Table 25-3).10

Prevention
Most patients with osteoporosis are asymptomatic until they develop fractures.
Regardless whether a diagnostic test for osteoporosis is requested, prevention
strategies should focus on reduction of risk factors (Tables 25-1 and 25-2).
Based on the prevalence of the condition, accessibility of diagnostic testing, and
available treatment options, several national societies have issued guidelines for
identifying subjects at risk of fragility (low trauma) fractures (Table 25-4).10–12 In
general, all groups agree that women who present with fragility fractures in the
absence of trauma should be tested, but opinions vary on whether and under which
conditions adults without fractures should be tested. Most U.S. guidelines
support bone density testing all women over age 65, with some supporting
testing all men over age 70, regardless of risk factors. In younger adults, testing
is typically recommended in the presence of previous fractures or risk factors for
osteoporosis. Of note, although the majority of data on the diagnosis and treatment
of osteoporosis is in white women, the recommendations for screening for
osteoporosis are irrespective of race.

Associated Conditions
Osteoporotic fractures
Fragility fractures are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in adults
with osteoporosis. The most common sites for osteoporotic fractures are the hip,
the spine, and the distal radius (forearm or wrist). Approximately 1.5 million
osteoporotic fractures occur each year in the United States, including 700,000
vertebral fractures, 300,000 hip fractures, 200,000 wrist fractures, and 300,000
other fractures.9
In white women age 65 to 85, it is estimated that 90% of all vertebral fractures,
90% of all hip fractures, 70% of all forearm fractures, and 50% of all other
fractures are attributable to osteoporosis. The corresponding rates in black
women are 80% for vertebral fractures, 80% for hip fractures, 60% for forearm
fractures, and 40% for all other fractures. In both races, a smaller percentage of
fractures can be attributed to osteoporosis in women younger than age 65, but a
larger percentage can be attributed to osteoporosis in women older than 85.13
A 50-year-old white woman has an approximately 40% risk of experiencing an
osteoporotic fracture during her lifetime (compared to the 23% risk in a man),
including a 15% risk of a having a vertebral fracture, a 17% risk of having a hip
fracture, and a 16% risk of having a wrist fracture. With the anticipated aging of
the population, osteoporotic fractures are predicted to increase several-fold
worldwide by 2050.14
Hip fractures are the most devastating cause of morbidity and mortality
attributable to osteoporosis. Mortality rates in the first year following fracture
are 20%, and an additional 50% lose daily functioning, resulting in only 30% of
patients regaining their prefracture level of function. Many patients lose
independence and require long-term care. Treatment of hip fractures and their
associated complications is responsible for the majority of the cost of treating
309

osteoporosis, estimated at $14 billion in 1995 and $17 billion in 2001.9
Vertebral fractures are also associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Vertebral fractures tend to be more occult than hip fractures, with only onethird presenting clinically. As opposed to hip and wrist fractures, most vertebral
fractures are not related to acute trauma and can result from routine everyday
activities. Up to 20% of patients require hospitalization, and vertebral fractures
are associated with chronic back pain, loss of height, and kyphosis. Multiple
vertebral fractures can result in the development of restrictive lung disease or
gastrointestinal complications that have been shown to decrease quality of life
across several domains. Most important, long-term prospective studies have
shown that vertebral fractures, whether symptomatic or not, are associated with a
15% to 30% increased rate of overall mortality, including increased risk of
mortality secondary to all cancers, specifically lung cancer.9,15
Prior osteoporotic fracture represents the greatest risk factor for future
fracture with relative risk ranging from 1.4 to 4.4 depending on the site of initial
fracture.16

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most patients with osteoporosis are asymptomatic until they develop fractures. As
such, the history and physical examination are usually not sufficiently sensitive until
the advanced stages of disease to make a diagnosis of osteoporosis in the absence of
diagnostic testing. However, a complete assessment of the patient’s history and
physical findings may suggest a high likelihood of low bone mass, the presence of an
occult fracture, or of other modifiable risk factors even before bone density is
assessed. A thorough history will also identify exposure to medications or the
presence of diseases that are known to affect bone metabolism.17 Men are more
likely than women to have secondary osteoporosis. Recent findings suggest that a
laboratory evaluation, including serum testosterone, is recommended in men, as
75% of men had a secondary cause of their osteoporosis.18
History
The primary focus should include all risk factors for low bone mass, fracture, and
falling to address prevention strategies (Tables 25-1 through 25-3).
Physical Examination
The physical exam should include assessment of findings suggestive of fracture
310

and/or disability contributing to fracture risk:
Loss of height
Kyphosis
Chest deformity
Rib-pelvis overlap
Respiratory difficulty
Protuberant abdomen and GI symptoms
Impaired ambulation

Diagnostic Criteria
See Classification Section.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Laboratory assessment of asymptomatic postmenopausal women with osteoporosis
led to identification of a secondary etiology in 47%.17 Laboratory analysis on all
patients should include
Chemistry panel, including calcium, phosphorus, creatinine
Hepatic function panel including liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, total
protein, albumin
25-OH vitamin D (25(OH)D)
Further testing as clinically indicated could include
Intact PTH
24-hour urine for calcium and creatinine
Thyroid function tests
Serum or urine protein electrophoresis
24-hour urine for cortisol
Antibodies for assessment of celiac disease
Testosterone (men only)
Bone turnover markers are rarely used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
Although they do have some utility in predicting fracture risk in population-based
studies,19 their high biologic and analytical variability limit their diagnostic
usefulness in individual subjects. They could be used after initiation of
antiresorptive treatment as indicators of adherence to treatment.
311

Markers of bone formation: serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin
Markers of bone resorption: serum C-telopeptide (CTX) and urine Ntelopeptide (NTX)
Imaging
Bone mineral density testing
The standard of care for diagnosis and evaluation of adults for osteoporosis
is to assess BMD. Several radiologic tests are available to measure BMD,
including central and peripheral dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA),
central and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and
quantitative ultrasonography (QUS).
Decreased BMD is a strong predictor of subsequent fracture. On average, the
risk of fracture approximately doubles for each 1 SD decrease in the T-score.
Although decreased bone density at one site allows the diagnosis of
osteoporosis to be made and increases the risk for fracture at all sites, the best
predictor of fracture at a specific site is the bone density at that site. This is
most important at the hip, which is the fracture site most associated with
morbidity and mortality. For each 1 SD decrease in hip BMD, the risk of hip
fractures increases by 2.6-fold, that of vertebral fractures by 1.8-fold, that of
wrist fractures by 1.4-fold, and the risk of all fractures increases by 1.5-fold.
The risk of a subsequent hip fracture associated with decreased BMD at other
sites is somewhat lower.20,21
Central (includes torso, pelvis, proximal femurs) DXA
DXA imaging, the current standard method for bone density testing, requires a
low level of radiation exposure (approximately one-tenth that of a traditional
X-ray) and has excellent precision and reproducibility.6
The recommended sites to measure are the spine and the proximal femur,
with the distal radius being an alternate possibility. BMD results are
calculated as the bone mineral content divided by the area of bone measured
(g/cm2). In the lumbar spine, measurements are generally made at the L1, L2,
L3, and L4 vertebrae and vertebrae-specific and total L1–L4 spine BMD
data are given. At the hip, measurements are made in three different areas: at
the femoral neck, the greater trochanter, and the intertrochanteric area, which
includes part of the proximal diaphysis. A total proximal femur BMD is also
calculated as the sum of bone mineral content of all three areas divided by
the total area. An area roughly corresponding to the Ward’s triangle is no
longer used for diagnostic purposes. The femoral neck BMD, composed
almost equally of cortical and trabecular bone, is a very good predictor of
312

fracture risk; whereas the total proximal femur BMD is generally used for
monitoring changes.6
Results of BMD testing are then reported in comparison to reference ranges
and normalized to the standard deviation of the reference population. The Tscore represents the difference, in SD units, between the patient’s BMD and
the average peak BMD of young healthy adults of the same gender, while the
Z-score represents the patient’s BMD in SDs after subtracting the average
BMD of adults of the same age and gender. The T-score and Z-score are
interpreted as described in the Classification section. A critical
consideration to keep in mind is that T-scores (and Z-scores) are techniquespecific; since different normative databases are used, T-scores obtained
from different methods for assessing bone density are not comparable. For
estimation of fracture risk and diagnosis of osteoporosis, only central DXA
T-scores are used. As described in the Classification section, the lowest of
total spine, total proximal femur, or femoral neck BMD determines the
diagnosis of low bone mass or osteoporosis.6
Several important factors should be considered with respect to sites for
DXA. For a full assessment of a patient’s bone mass and more accurate
determination of fracture risk, bone density testing should be obtained of both
the spine and hip. Nonetheless, since in the early postmenopausal period
bone loss occurs more rapidly in the spine, this site is often more helpful in
women younger than 65 or within 15 years of menopause. Furthermore,
vertebral fractures are the most common type of fracture in this age group. In
older subjects, the bone density of the spine may be falsely elevated by
osteoarthritis of the spine or vascular calcification, so bone density of the
hip is often more clinically useful, especially since hip fractures become
more of a clinical concern. Adults with primary hyperparathyroidism lose
bone most rapidly in the distal radius, so this site would be preferred in this
circumstance. Finally, patients with a prior fracture should not have the
fracture site included in DXA assessment, as BMD will be falsely elevated.6
Quantitative CT scanning can be performed by any commercially available
CT scanner. Similarly to central DXA, it measures BMD of the hip and spine
and has a similar ability to predict fractures. Unlike DXA, it is a measure of
volumetric density and reports results in g/cm3. It, therefore, may have utility in
patients at extremes of size (extremely thin or extremely obese) and is less
affected by superimposed osteoarthritis. However, quantitative CT scanning is
more expensive, requires a larger dose of radiation, and is not frequently used
clinically.22 Furthermore, based on the criteria of the National Osteoporosis
313

Foundation, it cannot be used for the diagnosis of osteoporosis or low bone
mass.10
Peripheral (extremities excluding the proximal femurs) bone density testing
can be performed with DXA, QCT, or QUS. Sites that can be measured include
the forearm, finger, and heel. The primary benefits of peripheral bone
densitometry techniques are the portability of the equipment and the ability of
the tests to be performed in a primary care office. While these modalities have
been shown to be predictive of fractures, there are no universally accepted
diagnostic criteria for the variety of machines available, and the precision of
the machines does not allow their use for monitoring response to therapy.
Peripheral testing has not been fully endorsed for use in the diagnosis of
osteoporosis, but if peripheral testing is performed, abnormal results should be
followed up with a central DXA to establish or confirm the diagnosis.23
Conventional radiography (plain films) is generally an unreliable marker of bone
mass, as 30% of bone must be lost before changes are evident on X-ray. If
osteopenia is suggested by radiographs, bone densitometry should be performed
to confirm low bone mass.24

TREATMENT
Indications for treatment10
All adults with osteoporotic fractures
All adults over age 50 with DXA T-score ≤ –2.5 of the femoral neck or spine
(osteoporosis)
All adults over age 50 with DXA T-score between –1.0 and –2.5 (low bone
mass) with 10-year risk for hip fracture ≥3% or major osteoporotic fracture
≥20%
The WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) was recently developed
to
estimate
10-year
fracture
risk and
is
available
at
www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX. This algorithm integrates age, gender, ethnicity,
geographic locality, weight, height, personal and family fracture history,
tobacco use, glucocorticoid use, diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol
use, and femoral neck BMD to produce an estimated fracture risk in patients
with a diagnosis of low bone mass. However, it has not been validated in
currently or previously treated patients, and it cannot be used for treatment
monitoring.25
All patients should be evaluated for risk factors for osteoporosis. The
nonpharmacologic and lifestyle recommendations (see Lifestyle/Risk
314

Modification section) should be suggested to all adults, including those who do
not meet the criteria for specific pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis, to
prevent the development of osteoporosis.

Medications
First Line
For information about osteoporosis medications, see Tables 25-5 and 25-6.
Aminobisphosphonates: alendronate (Fosamax), Risedronate (Actonel,
Atelvia), Ibandronate (Boniva), and Zoledronic acid (Reclast). The
aminobisphosphonates have a chemical structure that resemble pyrophosphate and
are powerful inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. All agents have
been shown to improve bone density at 3 years at various sites in the skeleton
a nd decrease the rates of hip and vertebral fractures (except ibandronate,
which has only been shown to decrease vertebral fractures).26–34
Oral aminobisphosphonates approved by the FDA for the treatment of
osteoporosis include alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate, with dosing
regimens ranging from daily to monthly. Alendronate is available with
supplemental vitamin D, and risedronate is available with supplemental
calcium. Oral aminobisphosphonates are poorly absorbed and should be taken
early in the morning with a glass of water followed by at least 30 minutes
without recumbency, food, or other medications to prevent retention of the
pills in the esophagus. Recently approved Atelvia may be taken with breakfast,
but still requires 30 minutes without recumbency. Antacids and calcium limit
their absorption. In the randomized, placebo-controlled trials with alendronate,
risedronate, and ibandronate, there was no significant difference in the rate of
gastrointestinal side effects between the agents and placebo, and more recent
once-weekly and once-monthly dosing regimens have improved compliance.
However, in clinical practice, about 10% of patients have gastrointestinal
distress, and severe erosive esophagitis related to pill “reflux” is a rare but
serious complication. Recently, concerns have been raised regarding a possible
increased risk of esophageal cancer, but this is rare and causative data are
conflicting. However, oral formulations should not be given to those with
Barrett’s esophagus or gastrointestinal disease.35
Intravenous formulations approved by the FDA for osteoporosis include
ibandronate and zoledronic acid, with dosing every 3 or 12 months,
respectively. The infusion can cause an acute phase “flu-like” reaction in some
patients, but this is tempered by pretreatment with acetaminophen.36
315

Aminobisphosphonates are cleared by the kidney, and renal failure has been
reported with intravenous formulations, so creatinine should be checked prior
to each infusion. This association has not been demonstrated with ibandronate,
so this may be a preferred choice in patients with chronic kidney disease, but
GFR <30 mL/minute (<35 mL/minute for zoledronic acid) is a
contraindication to treatment.37 Atrial fibrillation has been found to be
associated with zoledronic acid administration in one trial, but this has not been
confirmed in any other trials with the same or other aminobisphosphonates.27

BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD) AND FRACTURES

316

Osteonecrosis of the jaw is a rare complication of treatment, occurring in
1/10,000 to 1/100,000 patients, usually related to oral bone trauma and
infection. Patients receiving high cumulative intravenous doses, typically in the
setting of malignancy, are at increased risk, but at the doses of
aminobisphosphonates used for osteoporosis osteonecrosis of the jaw is
extremely rare. Defining its real incidence is complicated by the often
inconsistent definition of the syndrome. Nonetheless, current recommendations
are to delay the initiation of aminobisphosphonates until after any planned
oral surgery and avoid oral surgery as much as possible while on these
medications.38
Recently, reports of subtrochanteric fractures, also called “atypical femoral
fractures,” have emerged in patients exposed to aminobisphosphonates. These
are non-traumatic, transverse or slightly oblique, non-union fractures of the
subtrochanter or femoral diaphysis sometimes called “chalk-stick” fractures.
While the cause of these fractures is not entirely clear, they may be related to
underlying abnormal bone quality. Whether they are caused or prevented by
aminobisphosphonates remains to be seen, as these fractures also occur in
subjects who have not received these drugs. A link to prolonged inhibition of
bone turnover has been postulated but not demonstrated. Even assuming that
atypical femoral fractures are a complication of therapy, it is estimated that at
most 1 occurs for every 100 “routine” hip fractures prevented. Nonetheless,
because of these increased concern about long-term effects of bisphosphonates
on bone mineralization and turnover, in subjects with less severe osteoporosis
(no prior fracture or T-score ≥ –3.5) a drug holiday of <2 years following 5
years of aminobisphosphonate treatment does not appear to increase fracture
317

risk. If an atypical fracture occurs, the aminobisphosphonate should be
discontinued, with consideration of initiation of alternative therapies.39
Other contraindications to aminobisphosphonates include drug class
hypersensitivity and hypocalcemia.
Raloxifene (Evista) is an orally formulated selective estrogen receptor modulator
that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis. It exhibits proestrogenic effects on certain tissues and anti-estrogenic effects on other tissues,
exhibiting beneficial effects on bone by blocking the activity of cytokines that
stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Raloxifene has been shown in
randomized controlled trials lasting up to 3 to 4 years to improve BMD at the
spine and the hip and to decrease the rate of new vertebral fractures.40
Raloxifene has not been found to have a significant impact on hip or total
nonvertebral fractures. Therefore, the ideal candidate for raloxifene is a woman
who has predominantly decreased BMD at the spine with more preserved levels
of bone density at the hip, especially a woman who cannot tolerate an
aminobisphosphonate.
Raloxifene decreases total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol in a manner similar to estrogen, but does not raise high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides as estrogen does. Raloxifene
does not reduce hot flashes. It does increase the risk of deep venous
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in a fashion similar to estrogen, which is
thus a contraindication to its use. However, raloxifene does not stimulate the
endometrium or breast and does not increase the risk of endometrial
hyperplasia or cancer or breast cancer. In fact, a significant decrease in
estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer as a secondary end point was found in
a large clinical trial with raloxifene.41,42
Because of the adverse cardiovascular events associated with estrogen use, the
RUTH study was performed to study the cardiovascular impact of raloxifene.
This randomized controlled trial of postmenopausal women with coronary heart
disease (CHD) or risk factors for CHD were followed for 5.6 years with no
significant difference in the risk of primary coronary events between the
raloxifene and placebo groups. The study did show a decrease in the risk of
breast cancer, but an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and fatal
strokes in the treatment arm, although total all-cause mortality was similar
between groups. Therefore, these risks need to be weighed against the benefits
of reducing vertebral fractures and the risk of breast cancer in women
considered for raloxifene therapy.41
Teriparatide (Forteo) is a recombinant formulation of the active 34 N-terminal
318

peptide portion of parathyroid hormone, and it is FDA-approved for osteoporosis.
Although continuous exposure to PTH (as in patients with primary
hyperparathyroidism) leads to increased bone resorption, intermittent exposure
has been shown to stimulate bone formation. Teriparatide is the first bone
“anabolic” agent introduced for clinical use; unlike pharmacologic agents that
decrease bone resorption, teriparatide works by stimulating new bone formation.
Its mechanism of action is not completely clear, but it has been shown to act at
different steps in the osteoblast differentiation program, including recruitment of
new osteoblasts, stimulating the activity of existing osteoblasts, and prolonging
their survival.43
Teriparatide is administered by daily subcutaneous injections, at a dose of 20
mcg, and increases BMD at the spine and hip by 19 months to a greater extent
than any of the aminobisphosphonates. It also decreases vertebral fractures and
total nonvertebral fractures, but hip fracture improvement has not yet been
demonstrated.44
Because of its significant cost, teriparatide should generally be reserved for
patients with severe or established osteoporosis, particularly those who
cannot tolerate or have not responded well to bisphosphonates. Mild
hypercalcemia develops within 4 to 6 hours after injection, but serum calcium
returns within the normal range thereafter. High doses of teriparatide in rats
resulted in an increased rate of osteosarcoma, though this has not been seen in
human trials. Teriparatide thus carries a black-box warning about
osteosarcoma and is contraindicated in those with preexisting
hypercalcemia, metastatic bone disease, or increased risk for
osteosarcoma (Paget’s disease, prior radiation therapy to bone, open
epiphyses). Treatment is not recommended for >2 years.43
Denosumab (Prolia) is the most recently FDA-approved drug for the treatment of
osteoporosis. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) is
released by osteoblasts and is essential to stimulate the differentiation of
osteoclasts. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody against RANKL, thus inhibiting
osteoclast bone resorption. In fact, it is the most powerful inhibitor of bone
resorption among the drugs used in osteoporosis. Similar to other bone resorption
inhibitors, denosumab also decreases osteoblast-mediated bone formation,
because bone resorption and formation are so tightly coupled. Denosumab is
administered by subcutaneous injection of 60 mg every 6 months.45
In a study of postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis (23% with prior
fracture and average spine T-score –2.8), denosumab improved BMD in the
total hip, femoral neck, and spine at 3 years compared to placebo. Additionally,
319

the relative risk of fracture was reduced by 68% for vertebral, 40% for hip,
and 20% for nonvertebral fractures. The risk reduction in vertebral fracture
was independent of age, baseline bone turnover, baseline BMD, baseline
fractures, and prior treatments for osteoporosis. These reductions are
comparable to those of zoledronic acid and teriparatide.46
Adverse effects reported with denosumab include skin infections, eczema
and/or rash, and pancreatitis. As with all antiresorptive medications,
hypocalcemia and drug hypersensitivity are contraindications. Osteonecrosis of
the jaw has been reported with denosumab in two cases after more than 3 years
of treatment. No “atypical” fractures have emerged in any denosumab trials do
far.45 Denosumab is not cleared by the kidney, so adjustment for renal failure is
not necessary. However, in 38% of patients, bone biopsy at 3 years showed no
tetracycline labeling, suggestive of virtually absent bone formation.47 Given the
risk of low turnover bone disease in patients with chronic kidney failure,
extreme caution should be taken as the long-term effects of denosumab in this
population are unclear. Denosumab is approved for patients with osteoporosis
at high risk of fractures, and in those who are intolerance or insensitive to other
therapies.
Second Line
Estrogen/hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is FDA-approved only for the
prevention of osteoporosis and improves bone density by inhibiting osteoclast
activity. Little of the clinical data assessing the impact of estrogen have been in
women with documented osteoporosis. As a result, most of the data on estrogen
are more appropriate to interpret for prevention rather than treatment of
osteoporosis.
Estrogen alone or in combination with progestin improves BMD in the spine
and hip at 3 years in recently postmenopausal women.48 The WHI demonstrated
that combination estrogen–progesterone replacement therapy decreases the rate
of total fractures, vertebral fractures, hip fractures, and other osteoporotic
fractures by 24%, 34%, 34%, and 23%, respectively.49
Extraskeletal effects of HRT are numerous. In the WHI, although the rate of
colon cancer was decreased by 37%, the overall rate of adverse events,
including a 29% increase in CHD, a 41% increase in stroke, a 111% increase
in deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and a 26% increase in breast
cancer, exceeded the benefits, including fracture reduction. Similar rates of
fracture reductions were found in the estrogen-alone group in women of the
WHI who previously had a hysterectomy, with fewer of the adverse effects
320

seen in the combination estrogen/progesterone group. Additionally, no
increased risk cardiovascular disease was demonstrated in women within 10
years of menopause.50
Little prospective data actually exist in patients with known osteoporosis; only
one published small trial found a decrease in vertebral fractures with
transdermal estrogen.51 Based on the lack of data in treating known
osteoporosis and the balance of adverse events shown in the WHI, HRT has
largely fallen out of favor for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. In
women considering HRT for relief of menopausal symptoms, it should be used
in the lowest effective doses for the shortest possible time period, and these
women may gain benefit in BMD and fracture risk. However, other treatments
should be strongly considered first for osteoporosis prevention in women with
no other indication for HRT.
Calcitonin (Miacalcin) is an endogenous peptide that enhances BMD by inhibiting
osteoclast activity. Calcitonin is available in both subcutaneous and intranasal
forms, but the intranasal route has been most studied. The daily intranasal
formulation is approved by the FDA for osteoporosis in women who are at least 5
years postmenopause.
The beneficial effects on BMD of the spine are generally less with calcitonin
than with most of the other agents available to treat osteoporosis, with no
differences with placebo after 2 years. Minimal to no impact has been seen on
BMD of the hip. In the Prevent Recurrences of Osteoporotic Fracture (PROOF)
study, only the 200 IU/day dose was found to decrease vertebral fractures after
5 years, and there was no significant decrease in hip or nonvertebral
fractures.52
Calcitonin is typically a second- or third-line agent for the treatment of
osteoporosis and is primarily reserved for patients with either
contraindications to or intolerable side effects from other agents, particularly
bisphosphonates. It can rarely cause nasal irritation and epistaxis. However,
intranasal calcitonin has been found to be beneficial in treating the pain of
acute vertebral compression fractures.53
Unapproved medications
Strontium ranelate, a strontium salt of ranelic acid, is approved in an oral
formulation for the treatment of osteoporosis in more than 70 other countries,
primarily in Europe. Strontium has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral
fractures by 40%, with hip fracture reductions of 36% in an older subgroup of
patients. It was well tolerated with no significant adverse events reported.
However, its mechanism of action remains puzzling, as there is no strong
321

evidence that it affects bone remodeling in any way, and whether its stimulatory
action on the calcium sensing receptor contributes to the beneficial effect on
fracture prevention is unclear.54 Strontium ranelate is not currently approved by
the FDA, but strontium citrate is available in the US in over-the-counter food
supplements. However, this preparation has no fracture data. It should be noted
that strontium is retained in the mineral phase of bone, and since the atom has a
higher X-ray absorbance than calcium, exposure to strontium leads to a
spurious increase in bone density using DXA.
Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a thiazide diuretic typically used to treat
hypertension that is not approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, it
is recognized that HCTZ treatment increases BMD, and a large population
cohort study found that adults taking thiazide diuretics experienced significantly
fewer hip fractures, especially if they had been receiving treatment for >1
year.55 This was traditionally thought to be by inhibiting the thiazide-sensitive
sodium chloride co-transporter (NCC) in the distal tubule, which promotes
reabsorption of calcium from the urine, making HCTZ an effective treatment for
hypercalciuria, which can contribute to low bone mass. More recently, the
NCC was found to be expressed in human osteoblasts, and thiazides were
shown to stimulate osteoblast differentiation, suggesting these drugs may have
an additional direct bone-forming effect.56 Hypercalcemia and other electrolyte
disturbances are the primary adverse effects of HCTZ and especially need to be
monitored in the elderly.
Combination Therapy
Several different combination regimens of dual antiresorptive agents have been
studied with variable results. Adding alendronate or risedronate to regimens of
patients already taking hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has shown additive
effects on bone density. Similar results were found by adding raloxifene to
alendronate. However, these studies only demonstrated impact on BMD and have
not been large enough or long enough to assess fracture risk.57 In the absence of
such data, the increased adverse effects and cost of treating need to be considered
before initiating dual therapy with these agents.
With the addition of teriparatide to medications for osteoporosis, the most
promising drug combination was speculated to be teriparatide with an
aminobisphosphonate, as these potent drugs have different mechanisms of effect
and could potentially work synergistically. However, subsequent clinical data
have contradicted this. Several studies, including one in men,58 have found that
combination therapy with teriparatide and alendronate is less effective than
teriparatide alone at improving BMD and increasing new bone formation.59 More
322

promise has been shown with sequential treatment, and in a recent study, BMD
improvements with one year of teriparatide therapy were maintained or improved
with subsequent alendronate but lost if therapy was not followed by an
aminobisphosphonate.60 Therefore, the typical approach currently is to
immediately start an aminobisphosphonate following discontinuation of
teriparatide treatment to maintain the improved bone strength.

Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Lifestyle modifications are crucial to osteoporosis treatment and prevention. Adults
with osteoporosis should be encouraged to stop smoking and avoid excessive
alcohol intake. Dietary and activity modifications should be made as described
below.
Diet
Adequate intake of calcium is essential to achieve peak bone mass in early
adulthood and to maintain bone mass throughout postmenopausal life.61 Vitamin D
increases calcium absorption in the intestine and calcium reabsorption in the
kidney. Vitamin D is supplied both in the diet and in the conversion from skin
precursors in the presence of sunlight. Elderly adults, especially those who are
chronically ill or institutionalized, have a high prevalence of vitamin D
deficiency, as they have limited exposure to sunlight. 62 The majority of clinical
trials have found that supplementation with calcium and vitamin D has a modest
beneficial effect on BMD. Most important, one study of elderly women in nursing
homes found that supplementation with calcium and vitamin D decreased the rate
of hip and other fractures.63 Additionally, a meta-analysis found that
supplementation with 700 to 800 IU of vitamin D demonstrated decreased risk of
hip and nonvertebral fracture in elderly adults.64
Calcium
The recommended daily intake varies somewhat in different consensus
guidelines, but in general is at least 1000 mg daily of elemental calcium in
adults under age 50 and 1200 mg daily of elemental calcium in adults over
age 50.9,10 Foods rich in calcium include milk, yogurt, cheeses, sardines, and
fortified juices. The average daily calcium intake in adults from nondairy foods
is 250 mg/day. For dairy products, on average, 8 ounces of milk, 6 ounces of
yogurt, or 1.5 ounces of cheese contain 300 mg of elemental calcium.9
Essentially all of the clinical trials in adults with osteoporosis that have
included dietary assessments of calcium intake have found that the dietary
calcium intake of most adults is significantly below recommended levels.61 As
323

such, most adults both with and without osteoporosis require calcium
supplementation. There are a multitude of calcium supplements available, most
as either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate. It is important to realize that the
recommendations for calcium are for elemental calcium and that many overthe-counter calcium supplements are labeled by the amount of calcium
carbonate (40% elemental) or citrate (21% elemental) per pill. Calcium
salts are best absorbed with meals.
A recent meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials of calcium supplementation (without
vitamin D) in older adults that assessed cardiovascular outcomes found an
increased risk of myocardial infarction with calcium supplementation. The
implications of this analysis are yet to be fully understood, but currently it
seems prudent to advise patients to optimize calcium intake from dietary
sources rather than from supplementation whenever possible.65
Vitamin D
The optimal level of 25(OH)D is thought to be between 30 and 60 ng/mL.
Within this range, mineral homeostasis is balanced with optimization of
intestinal calcium absorption and mineralization. However, vitamin D
deficiency or insufficiency are very common.62 In all patients being evaluated
for bone health, a 25(OH)D level should be measured. If <30 ng/mL,
supplementation with ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) 50,000 IU weekly, should be
started and continued for 8 weeks with repeat 25(OH)D level to ensure it is
>30 ng/mL. Thereafter, monthly or twice monthly dosing with 50,000 IU of
ergocalciferol or daily dosing with cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 1000 to 2000
IU daily is typically necessary to maintain healthy 25(OH)D levels.62
All patients should have calcium and vitamin D intake addressed with nutritional
deficiencies treated prior to initiation of pharmacotherapy.
Activity
Weight-bearing exercise should be encouraged. Multiple small observational and
randomized controlled trials have shown that regular exercise can help maximize
peak bone mass in young women, decrease age-related bone loss, actually
improve BMD in some circumstances, and help maintain muscle balance and
strength. The goal should be to exercise for 30 to 60 minutes at least 3 times per
week. High-impact weight-bearing activities, such as brisk walking, jogging,
weight lifting, and racket sports, are beneficial forms of exercise. Non-weightbearing activities, such as swimming, are of more questionable benefit.66 The
Nurses’ Health Study demonstrated that for every 3 metabolic equivalents per
week of activity in postmenopausal women without osteoporosis, hip fracture was
324

decreased by 6%.67
Patients should be assessed for reversible causes of falls such as overmedication,
neurologic or vision problems, and poor footwear. For patients at high risk of
falling, hip protectors worn under their clothes have been shown to decrease the
rate of hip fractures by 60%.68

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is the most common form of secondary
osteoporosis and fractures. Doses of 2.5 to 5.0 mg prenisolone equivalents for more
than 3 months double the risk for fracture.69 Low-trauma vertebral and hip fractures
occur in glucocorticoid-treated patients even at bone density levels that would
otherwise be associated with low fracture risk. Glucocorticoids inhibit osteoblast
function and cause osteocyte apoptosis thus decreasing bone formation. Although
bone remodeling is generally decreased by glucocorticoids, there is still an
imbalance favoring bone resorption. Therefore, resorption inhibitors, in particular
aminobisphosphonates have a role in preventing bone loss in these patients.
However, continued suppression of bone turnover is not ideal in chronic
glucocorticoid users. Teriparatide has been demonstrated to be more effective than
aminobisphosphonates in this population both for increasing BMD and decreasing
fractures.70 Therefore, in the absence of contraindications, it is preferred as the
initial therapy for patients with severe glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, though
aminobisphosphonates may be beneficial in early stages before bone loss occurs,
and should always be started following teriparatide treatment.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Follow-up of patients with osteoporosis includes monitoring for complications,
continued risk factors, side effects, and response to treatment.
Continued assessment should take place for modifiable risk factors for fall such as
gait disorders, visual problems, or sedating medications (see Table 25-3). Height
should be followed on a regular basis to screen for asymptomatic vertebral
fractures.
In general, antiresorptive therapy with HRT, raloxifene, or denosumab needs to be
continued long term, as the beneficial effect on BMD is lost over time after
stopping treatment. As noted earlier, bisphosphonates can be discontinued, at least
temporarily, after 5 to 6 years of treatment. Based on their long-term retention in
bone, the need for continuous treatment beyond 5 to 6 years is questionable.
Repeat BMD measurements should be made on the same DXA machine as results
325

cannot be compared between different machines. Each DXA facility should
perform a precision analysis averaged over all technologists for the facility when
a DXA system is purchased and when the skill level of any technologist changes.
A precision analysis consists of the measurement of 15 representative clinic
patients 3 times or 30 patients 2 times, with repositioning after each scan.6 The
facility-specific LSC values for each site should be included on each DXA report,
and changes in BMD should not be reported as significant unless greater than
LSC. In general, BMD changes need to be at least 3% to be considered
significant, as the precision of most bone densitometers is approximately 1% to
1.5%, but it is important to remember that stable as well as increased BMD
represent a favorable response to treatment.10 Significantly decreased BMD
suggests that diet, activity, other risk factors, compliance, and medications be
reassessed for possible needed changes.
BMD should be reevaluated after 12 to 18 months to assess response to therapy.
Once a favorable response has been demonstrated, bone densitometry can
potentially be measured every 2 years in lower-risk patients. Patients who are
being screened for osteoporosis but are not on treatment should wait at least
2 years before undergoing repeat bone density testing.10

Paget’s Disease of Bone
Scott Goodwin and Michael P. Whyte
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Paget’s disease of bone (PDB) is characterized by acquired, focal acceleration of
bone turnover (remodeling and expansion) and compromised structure that lead to
weak bone predisposed to fracture. It is also referred to as osteitis deformans and
was first described in 1877 by Sir James Paget.1,2

Classification
PDB can be localized to one skeletal area (monostotic) or affect multiple parts of
the skeleton (polyostotic).

Epidemiology
PDB is the second most common metabolic bone disorder in older adults (after
osteoporosis). The prevalence is slightly greater in men than women.3
PDB shows a distinctive geographic distribution globally. It occurs most
commonly in Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. It is
uncommon in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Interestingly, however, the
prevalence of PDB is similar in both white and black Americans.3
PDB typically manifests in middle age or later and is considered uncommon in
adults younger than 40 years of age. Population studies using radiographs and
autopsy have found prevalence of 1% in adults older than age 40 years in the
United States.2

Etiology
The etiology of PDB has been debated for decades and remains unsolved today.
Evidence suggests there are both genetic and environmental factors that influence the
changes associated with Pagetic bone.
332

Genetic factors: 5% to 40% of patients with PDB have a first-degree relative
also with this bone disorder. 4,5 Two gene mutations have been described.
However, these mutations do not account for all cases. One mutation disrupts
sequestosome 1/p62. The other mutation consists of defects within a valosincontaining protein.2
Environmental influences: PDB due to a viral infection of osteoclasts has been
postulated since the 1970s. Evidence to support this began with the visualization
using electron microscopy of viral-like inclusion bodies in osetoclasts and virallike antigens using immunohistochemical techniques.6 However, these
observations have not always been replicated and actual viruses have not been
isolated from Pagetic bone.

Pathophysiology
The pathogenic abnormality in PDB is enhanced osteoclast activity. The osteoclasts
in patients with Pagetic bone are excessively multinucleated, increased in number,
and size with up to 100 nuclei (5 to 10 normal). The increased osteoclast activity
results in three distinct clinical phases of the disease. Different parts of the skeleton
may simultaneously be in different stages7,8:
The initial osteolytic phase features intense bone resorption by the Pagetic
osteoclasts, usually in the long bones, pelvis, and/or the skull.
In the mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic phase, active bone resorption by osteoclasts
leads to increased and uncooridinated bone formation by reactive osteoblasts.
The late sclerotic phase is characterized by continued bone formation, resulting in
thickened disorganized bone of poor quality.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The majority of patients with PDB are asymptomatic, and the disease is
diagnosed incidentally on radiographs or for the investigation of an elevated
serum alkaline phosphatase.
If there are symptoms, the two most common are bone pain and joint pain.9
The bone pain is typically constant, is deep-seated, may be worse at night, and
frequently increases with weight bearing. The severity of pain does not always
correlate with radiographic findings and tends to be more prominent with
advanced lytic lesions.
Secondary osteoarthritis and corresponding joint pain frequently develop,
333

particularly in weight-bearing joints, especially the hip and the knee. Several
mechanisms are responsible including uneven bony expansion resulting in a
deformed base for articular cartilage, compromised space due to bony
overgrowth, and altered joint mechanics secondary to bony deformities.
Physical signs of PDB can include bony deformities such as bowing of the limbs,
kyphosis or scoliosis, and enlargement of the skull (which can lead to cranial
nerve compromise and/or deafness). Local skin warmth over pagetic lesions may
also develop secondary to increased bony vascularity.
The prevalence of skeletal involvement of PDB by location are shown in Table
26-1.
TABLE 26-1 FREQUENCY OF SKELETAL SITES INVOLVED IN PAGET’S
DISEASE (%)

Diagnostic Testing
Evaluation of patients with PDB can include radiographs, a bone scan, and
laboratory assessment including markers of bone turnover. The order in which the
tests are obtained typically depends on whether PDB is suspected from symptoms
or diagnosed incidentally.
A bone scan is the best test for defining the extent of this disease. Bone scans are
more sensitive, but less specific than traditional radiographs. They can detect
15% to 30% of lesions not detected by plain films.7 Radiographs can be obtained
of painful areas or areas that are abnormal on the bone scan to confirm the
diagnosis and to assess the degree of abnormalities.2
An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level is the most useful biochemical
marker to assess the degree of osteoblast activity. Alkaline phosphatase levels
correlate to the extent of disease on bone scan.10 However, investigators must
334

remember that sources for an elevated alkaline phosphatase level include the liver
and bone. Differentiation of these two sources can be made by either
fractionating the alkaline phosphatase level or by assaying serum gamaglutamyltransferase (GTT). A normal GTT will effectively rule out hepatic source
and then imaging studies could be pursued, as described, to search for bony
lesions.
At the time of initial diagnosis, markers of both bone formation and bone
resorption can be useful.
Alkaline phosphatase (total or bone specific) is a good marker to assess bone
formation.
Other bone markers, such as urinary hydroxyproline, serum osteocalcin,
procollagen type I N-terminal peptide (NTX), and/or procollagen type 1 Cterminal peptide (CTX) usually require the use of referral laboratories and are
therefore not routinely measured10,11
Additional optional testing
If the traditional tests above are inconclusive, some additional laboratory and
imaging tests may be useful.
Serum calcium and phosphorous concentrations are usually normal in PDB.
Hypercalcemia in ambulatory patients suggests presence of a second disorder
such as primary hyperparathyroidism.
Additional radiologic testing is generally unnecessary except to evaluate for
complications. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) help to evaluate for malignant degeneration or neurologic complications,
such as spinal stenosis.
Bone biopsy is usually not required to make a diagnosis of PDB but is obtained
primarily when concern arises for malignant degeneration.

TREATMENT
The primary goals of treatment are to decrease pain and to hopefully decrease the
rate of bone turnover to prevent progression of disease and the development of
complications.
The following are generally accepted indications for treatment12:
Symptomatic disease: bone pain, deformities, or neurologic symptoms
Patients preparing for elective orthopedic surgery on involved joints (in an
effort to decrease bony vascularity)
TABLE 26-2 PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OPTIONS
335

Asymptomatic patients with evidence of increased bone turnover are at risk for
complications based on the areas involved:
Lytic lesions in long bones with a high risk for developing fractures
Disease in proximity to joints with risk of developing secondary
osteoarthritis
Disease in the spine because of the risk of developing spinal stenosis
Disease in the skull because of the risk of deafness and cranial nerve palsy

Medications
The newer generation, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are the perferred
treatment for those PDB patients requiring therapy. These agents are now
available in oral (aldendronate and risedronate) or intravenous (pamidronate and
zolendronate) formulations (Table 26-2). These agents have shown to decrease
bone turnover (as measured by the decline in serum alkaline phosphatase levels)
as well as improve/relieve symptoms.12,13
Supplemental calcium and vitamin D can be given to prevent defective bone
mineralization, although this complication is much less common with the newer
bisphosphonates.
Older generation bisphosphonates, etidronate, and tiludronate are less effective in
improving symptoms and decreasing markers of bone turnover. They are generally
not given as first-line treatment.2,12
Calcitonin is another older agent that can be considered for patients who are
unable to tolerate bisphosphonates. Calcitonin is somewhat more effective in PDB
when given as an injection (subcutaneous or intramuscular) than when given
nasally. Unfortunately, symptoms and increases in bone turnover usually recur
336

soon after stopping this therapy.12

Surgical Management
Surgical therapy may be helpful for some complications of PDB. The most
common indication is a joint replacement, usually of a hip or a knee, for
secondary osteoarthritis.14
Other reasons to consider surgical intervention are for a complicated nonhealing
fracture, bowing deformities of long bones, spinal stenosis, and focal nerve root
compression syndromes.
Bisphosphonate therapy can be initiated prior to elective surgery to decrease bone
vascularity and the risk of intraoperative bleeding.12

COMPLICATIONS
Multiple complications can occur in patients with PDB (Table 26-3), although
most are infrequent.
Fractures are one of the most common complications and occur in 6% to 7% of
patients.14 Fractures occur most commonly in the femur, tibia, and humerus and
are often associated with poor healing and nonunion.
Neurologic complications can occur because of either direct nerve root
compression by pagetic bone or diversion of blood flow to bone. Spinal stenosis
is an important neurologic complications. Deafness occurs in 10% to 30% of
patients with disease affecting the skull.7
Cardiovascular complications are much less common than previously thought,
particularly high-output heart failure.
TABLE 26-3 POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS IN PAGET’S DISEASE

337

Malignant sarcomatous degeneration is an uncommon but severe and usually
life-threatening complication of PDB, occurring in <1% of patients and most
commonly in those with severe polyostotic disease.15
The most commonly involved bones, in descending order, are the femur,
humerus, pelvis, skull, and facial bones.
Malignant transformation may lead to a sudden or severe increase in pain, a
palpable mass, a rise in the alkaline phosphatase, and/or a pathologic fracture.
The prognosis is poor, with a 50% mortality rate at 6 months and a 5-year
survival rate of only 5% to 15%.15 A small percentage of patients with limbbone sarcomas without evidence of metastatic disease can be treated with wide
surgical excision/amputation and aggressive chemotherapy and/or radiation
therapy.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Follow-up of patients with PDB includes monitoring their symptoms as well as
sometimes following markers of bone turnover occasionally supplemented with
radiologic studies.
Symptoms are usually initially monitored every 3 months in those on therapy and
338

every 6 to 12 months in those not on treatment. The markers of bone resorption
typically improve quickly within days, whereas the markers of bone formation
take longer to improve, often up to 1 month.2,7,12
The alkaline phosphatase is the easiest of the markers of bone turnover to follow
and is usually the only one needed in follow-up. The alkaline phosphatase could
be checked every 3 to 4 months during therapy until it normalizes. It is usually
followed annually in those not on treatment. Retreatment with another course of a
bisphosphonate should be considered if the alkaline phosphatase increases by
>20% to 25% above the posttreatment nadir.2,10,11
Serial measurements of other markers of bone turnover could be useful in those
with highly active lytic disease, especially if the alkaline phosphatase is
relatively normal.10,11
Indications for subsequent X-rays are new symptoms or worsening of stable
symptoms, trauma, concern for a fracture, and concern for sarcomatous
degeneration.

Standards of Care for Diabetes Mellitus
Prajesh M. Joshi and Janet B. McGill
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Standards of care for patients with diabetes are developed by consensus
committees both in the United States and abroad to facilitate the application of
evidence-based medicine to all patients with diabetes.
The stated goals of these committees are to provide practical guidelines for healthcare providers that will reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from acute and
chronic complications of diabetes.
Health-care providers are expected to know the health risks associated with
diabetes, and to be able to develop treatment strategies for individual patients to
attain the stated targets. Although individual patients may require modification of
treatment targets, providers should strive to achieve the stated goal in the majority
of patients with diabetes.
Third party payers are beginning to utilize these treatment targets as benchmarks
for evaluation of services and for payment.
Standards of care for patients with diabetes have been established by the
American Diabetes Association (ADA), the American Association of Clinical
Endocrinologists (AACE), and the European Association for the Study of
Diabetes (EASD) in conjunction with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).
Other groups such as the Joint National Committee for the Study of Hypertension
(JNC VII) and the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) have addressed specific
comorbid conditions.
Most of the recommendations from these consensus groups are similar; however,
there are key differences that will be pointed out in this chapter.
Original studies and grade of evidence supporting the recommendations discussed
in this chapter are referenced in the consensus documents. And the diagnostic and
treatment strategies have been discussed in Chapter 28 and Chapter 29.

SCREENING FOR DIABETES MELLITUS
341

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
Type 1–prevention trials suggest that measurement of autoantibodies identifies
individuals at risk for developing the disease. Testing may be appropriate in highrisk individuals with prior history of transient hyperglycemia, those who have
close relatives with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), or in the context of clinical research
studies. However, widespread screening is generally not recommended for lowrisk populations.1
Counseling regarding the risk of developing T1DM should be provided to those
who have positive antibody titers.
TABLE 27-1 CRITERIA FOR TESTING FOR DIABETES IN
ASYMPTOMATIC ADULTS

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
The ADA recommends screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at age 45
OR in adults who are overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) with additional risk
factors (Table 27-1 for screening recommendations).
AACE recommends annual screening of all individuals who are risk for
developing T2DM. The risk factors include family history of T2DM;
cardiovascular disease; overweight or obese; sedentary lifestyle; nonwhite
342

ethnicity; previously identified impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired
fasting glucose (IFG) and/or metabolic syndrome (see Chapter 29); hypertension;
increased levels of triglycerides, low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol, or both; history of gestational diabetes mellitus, history of
delivery of an infant with a birth weight >9 pounds (4 kg); polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS); and antipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia and/or severe
bipolar disease.2
The EASD and ECS recommend using a risk-assessment tool such as the
Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) to assess the 10-year risk of T2DM,
and performing laboratory testing that includes a diagnostic oral glucose tolerance
test (OGTT) on persons at high risk.3
The same tests are used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. Diagnostic
criteria are covered in Table 29-2 in Chapter 29.
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) performed in a laboratory using a method that is
National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) certified and
standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) assay, has
recently been added as one of the tests for screening and diagnostic test for
diabetes (Table 27-2).4
TABLE 27-2 CORRELATION BETWEEN HBA1C AND MEAN PLASMA
GLUCOSE1

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose
intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy.
Screening for diabetes in pregnancy is important to ensure optimal maternal and
fetal outcomes.
343

Because the number of pregnant women with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes has
increased with the ongoing epidemic of obesity, patients with preconception
T2DM may be wrongly classified as gestational. Hence ADA recommends
screening women with risk factors for diabetes (see Table 27-1 ) using
standard diagnostic testing at the first prenatal visit. Women who satisfy
diagnostic criteria should receive a diagnosis of overt diabetes.1
All pregnant women previously undiagnosed with diabetes should undergo GDM
testing with a 75 gm OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. The OGTT should
be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. The
diagnosis of GDM is made if any of the following criteria are met1,5:
Fasting plasma glucose ≥92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L)
1-hour plasma glucose ≥180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L)
2-hour plasma glucose ≥153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L)
Women with GDM should also be tested at 6 to 12 weeks postpartum to detect
persistence of diabetes and followed more closely in subsequent years.

PREVENTION OF DIABETES
Several randomized controlled studies have shown that diabetes can be prevented
in individuals at high risk with either lifestyle modification or with medication.6,7
All three-consensus groups recommend counseling in lifestyle management to
reduce weight in those who are overweight and to increase physical
activity.1–3
Studies of lifestyle management that have resulted in weight loss of ≥5% through
diet and exercise (150 minute/week) have demonstrated up to 58% reduction in
risk of progression to diabetes.6,7
Based on these clinical trials, lifestyle changes with a goal weight loss of at least
7% and moderate physical activity ~150 minutes/week are recommended for
prevention of progression from IFG or IGT to diabetes.1–3
Medications that have proved effective in preventing diabetes include
metformin, α-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acarbose), orlistat, and
thiazolidinediones. None of these drugs have been approved by the FDA in the
United States for use in prediabetes/prevention of progression of diabetes. After
consideration of cost, side effects, and lack of persistence of their effect in
clinical trials, ADA recommends against the use of these drugs in
prediabetes/prevention of progression of diabetes. However, if lifestyle
management fails, metformin therapy could be considered.1,2
344

GLYCEMIC CONTROL
Targets for glycemic control in diabetes reflect evidence from randomized
controlled trials that have demonstrated protection from long-term microvascular
complications. Reduction in macrovascular events has not been demonstrated in
clinical trials comparing tight versus less tight glycemic control. However, longterm follow-up of the DCCT and UKPDS cohorts has demonstrated risk reduction
of macrovascular disease in tight control group. It is, therefore, important to
individualize the goal HbA1c according to the risk of hypoglycemia, presence of
comorbidities, and life expectancy.1
In pregnancy, glycemic targets are lower than in nonpregnant adults to mimic nondiabetic pregnant women, and to ensure optimal fetal outcomes.
The two primary ways to monitor glycemic control are self-monitored blood
glucose (SMBG) and HbA1c.4
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using a real-time sensor that measures
glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid has become an ancillary method for
glucose monitoring and management.4

Self-monitoring of Blood Glucose
The frequency of SMBG should range from 1 to 4 or more readings per day,
depending on the intensity of therapy and risk of hypoglycemia. In patients with
T1DM and T2DM on multiple insulin injections or insulin pump as well as
pregnant women taking insulin, more frequent testing (three or more times a day)
is necessary to reach HbA1c targets.1 The optimal frequency, timing, and overall
utility of SMBG for noninsulin treated patients with T2DM is a matter of debate.
SMBG is generally checked before meals and at bedtime, with periodic checks
of glucose during the postprandial period and during sleep.
The capillary blood glucose levels are 10% to 15% lower than plasma glucose
levels. Newer blood glucose meters are calibrated to report plasma glucose
values, so each patient should be informed whether his/her meter reports plasma
values.4
If there is a discrepancy between SMBG values reported by the patient or depicted
in meter readings and the HbA1c, it may be useful to measure postprandial
glucose 1 to 2 hours after meals. Persistently high HbA1c despite lower than
expected blood glucose readings, or wide fluctuations in blood glucose, should
prompt further investigation, which is often done best by a certified diabetes
educator (CDE).

345

TABLE 27-3 GLYCEMIC TARGETS FOR ADULTS WITH DIABETES

The HbA1c reflects blood glucose levels over the previous 2 to 3 months. The
HbA1c should be monitored every 3 months until a patient reaches goal, and
then every 6 months if the patient is at target and stable. Use of point-of-care
HbA1c test enables timely decisions on therapeutic changes during office visits.
Table 27-2 lists correlation between HbA1c and mean plasma glucose levels. A
calculator for converting HbA1c results into estimated average glucose (eAG) is
available at http://professional.diabetes.org/eAG.1,4
Guidelines for glycemic goals established by consensus groups are listed in Table
27-3.1–3
The goals for glycemic control should be individualized. HbA1c goal may be
near normal (<6%) for individuals with short duration of diabetes, long life
expectancy, and no significant cardiovascular disease if possible to achieve it
without hypoglycemia; and less stringent targets may be appropriate for those with
a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, extensive comorbid
conditions, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, and
difficult to manage long-standing diabetes. Targets for children are adjusted to
permit scrupulous avoidance of serious hypoglycemia.1,2
HbA1c can be misleading in patients with certain forms of anemia and
hemoglobinopathies. HbA1c assay without interference from abnormal
hemoglobins (list of assays and impact of abnormal hemoglobin on them is
available
at http://www.ngsp.org/factors.asp) should be used for
346

hemoglobinopathies with normal red cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell trait). HbA1c
is unreliable for diagnosis and management in conditions of abnormal cell
turnover as in pregnancy or anemia from hemolysis and iron deficiency.4

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
The ADA and EASD have developed a consensus statement on the management of
hyperglycemia in diabetes. The basic tenets are early intervention with metformin
and lifestyle therapy, which include medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and exercise
with frequent adjustment to achieve the glycemic goal. Diabetes Self-Management
Education (DSME) is an integral part of management strategy.

Diabetes Self-Management Education
Patients with newly diagnosed as well as established diabetes should receive
comprehensive DSME by a CDE. This approach should be patient centered and
done in collaboration with health-care professionals.

Lifestyle Therapy
Nutrition recommendations need to be individualized with consideration to the
patient’s level of overweight, ethnicity, diabetes therapy, and food choices.
Carbohydrate intake monitoring with carbohydrate counting, exchanges, or
experience-based estimation have been shown to improve glycemic control.
Aerobic exercise of at least 150 minutes (50% to 70% of maximum heart rate) per
week and supplemental repetitive resistance training are recommended for all
adults with diabetes in the absence of contraindications.
Studies have shown that high levels of physical activity, either as part of a daily
work routine or for pleasure, are associated with reduced cardiovascular risk in
both primary and secondary prevention that is equivalent to first-line
pharmacologic therapy. Health-care providers should assess the level of physical
activity in patients with diabetes and provide encouragement to reach the target of
150 minutes of aerobic exercise weekly or 10,000 steps daily. Physical
limitations should be addressed and alternative exercise programs developed as
needed.
Nutrition advice specific to cardiovascular risk reduction includes avoidance of
trans and saturated fats, increased intake of fiber, and intake of five or more
servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Reduction of salt intake is advised in
persons who are hypertensive. This advice should be provided to all patients as
part of routine health-care visits and included in MNT instructions.
347

Smoking cessation is critically important for persons with diabetes, and
counseling regarding smoking cessation should be documented in medical
records.

Drug Therapy
Medication intervention should normally begin with metformin, with other agents
added sequentially to achieve glycemic targets.
Earlier treatment with insulin is recommended to correct blood glucose level
>250 to 300 mg/dL at presentation or any time in the course of treatment.
Hypoglycemia is a limiting factor in the glycemic management of diabetes.
Glucose values <70 mg/dL should be treated with 15 to 20 g of glucose
(preferred) or other carbohydrate, and rechecked in 15 minutes. Persons at
risk for severe hypoglycemia should have a prescription for glucagon and
instructions for use by a companion.

Bariatric Surgery
Gastric banding or bypass surgery should be considered in morbidly obese T2DM
individuals (BMI >35 kg/m2), especially when lifestyle and pharmacologic
therapies have failed to achieve the goals of therapy.
Bariatric surgery has resulted in near or complete normalization of glycemia in
~55% to 95% of patients with T2DM in various studies.10

PREVENTION OF COMPLICATIONS DUE TO DIABETES
Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in patients with
diabetes. Diabetes confers an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome,
myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, peripheral vascular
disease, and sudden death that is 2 to 5 times the risk in nondiabetic comparator
groups.
Persons with diabetes also experience greater morbidity after vascular events, and
interventions such as coronary angioplasty may not be as effective at reducing
morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic comparison
groups. Although the increased risk is not entirely explained by usual risk factors,
studies have shown that aggressive management of hypertension and lipids and the
use of antiplatelet agents in patients with diabetes can reduce the risk of
cardiovascular events, and that the benefits of treatment of each risk factor in
348

diabetes may exceed the benefits in lower risk cohorts.
Consequently, health-care providers are expected to address cardiovascular risk
in a comprehensive manner, and achieve targets that are more stringent for blood
pressure, lipids, and healthy lifestyles than in nondiabetic patients.

Hypertension
Hypertension is present in more than 75% of persons with T2DM, and more than
50% of persons with T1DM.1–3,11,12
Blood pressure reduction has been shown to reduce the frequency of myocardial
infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes-related deaths. In addition,
blood pressure reduction slows the progression of nephropathy, retinopathy, and
vision loss.
Blood pressure should be checked at every visit in patients with diabetes.
Lifestyle therapy and medical treatment should be considered if the blood pressure
is ≥130/80 mm Hg. Lifestyle therapy for hypertension includes weight loss,
DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension)-style diet, moderation of alcohol
intake, and increased physical activity. DASH-style diet consists of decrease in
sodium and increase in potassium intake.
All of the consensus guidelines suggest using angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as initial
therapy because of proven benefit in lowering cardiovascular mortality and
progression of both retinopathy and nephropathy in individual with diabetes.
Second- and third-line treatment with diuretics, β-blockers, or calcium channel
blockers should be tailored to the individual patient. β-blockers are indicated in
patients who have had a myocardial infarction, heart failure, or for rate control in
atrial fibrillation. Vasodilating agents such as carvedilol or nebivolol may be
particularly useful in patients with diabetes, since they do not worsen insulin
resistance or symptomatic peripheral vascular disease.
Use of ACEIs in diabetic patients with blood pressure below the stated target of
130/80 mm Hg and with retinopathy or microalbuminuria may provide protection
from progression of these complications. ACEIs and ARBs have been associated
with birth defects, so caution is advised in premenopausal women, especially
those women who indicate a desire to become pregnant or who are not using
adequate birth control.

Hyperlipidemia
Diabetic patients should have a fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, low-density
349

lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) checked
yearly. Lipid targets for patients with diabetes are listed in Table 27-4.1–3,13,14
Therapy is initially directed toward meeting the LDL cholesterol goal. A
secondary goal is to raise HDL cholesterol above the gender-specific target. For
those with triglycerides ≥200 mg/dL, current National Cholesterol Education
Program/Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines have established a non-HDL
cholesterol (total HDL cholesterol) target of <130 mg/dL as the secondary goal.
TABLE 27-4 LIPID TARGETS FOR PERSONS WITH DIABETES

If the triglyceride level is >500 mg/dL, therapy should first be directed at lowering
triglycerides to prevent pancreatitis.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have provided the greatest benefit in
350

patients with diabetes, and should be considered first-line therapy. Combination
therapy with fibrates, fish oil, or niacin may be needed in selected patients to
achieve HDL and triglyceride targets. Additional LDL lowering with ezetimibe or
a bile acid sequestrant may be required to reach LDL targets. For specific
recommendations on treatment of hyperlipidemia, please refer to Chapter 33.

Retinopathy
Patients with diabetes are at risk for retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy poses a
serious threat to vision and is the leading cause of blindness in middle-aged
Americans.1,2
Annual dilated ophthalmologic evaluations are recommended to monitor
retinopathy.
Newly diagnosed T1DM patients should have an initial dilated eye examination
within 3 to 5 years after onset of their disease. Persons with T2DM should have a
comprehensive eye examination at the time of diagnosis and yearly thereafter.15
Women who are planning a pregnancy, or who present early in pregnancy, should
have a comprehensive eye examination due to the risk of development or
progression of retinopathy during pregnancy. An eye examination should be
performed in the first trimester with close follow-up throughout the pregnancy and
for 1 year postpartum.
Eye examinations more frequently than once a year should be done in patients with
active retinopathy and in patients receiving active treatment for retinopathy.
Laser photocoagulation therapy has been the mainstay treatment for preservation of
vision in diabetic retinopathy, but it does not restore lost vision. Close
ophthalmologic follow-up is recommended to determine the timing and extent of
laser or other therapies.

Nephropathy
Diabetic nephropathy accounts for nearly 50% of end-stage renal disease in the
United States and is a leading cause of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.1,2
The earliest sign of diabetic nephropathy is microalbuminuria, which can be
measured by albumin-to-creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample or by the more
cumbersome method of 24-hour or timed collections of urine, which do not lead to
improved accuracy.
Microalbuminuria is defined as a albumin:creatinine ratio of 30 to 300 mcg/mg,
and macroalbuminuria is defined as albumin:creatinine ratio of ≥300 mcg/mg.
Macroalbuminuria carries a worse prognosis with regard to progression of kidney
351

disease and need for renal replacement therapy.
In patients with T1DM, testing for albuminuria should be performed within 5 years
of diagnosis and repeated annually. Testing should be done at the time of
diagnosis and annually in persons with T2DM.
Microalbuminuria should be confirmed in two of three tests within 3 to 6 months to
eliminate positive tests due to transient conditions such as exercise, urinary tract
infections, hematuria, viral illness, and hyperglycemia. Once microalbuminuria
is diagnosed, treatment should begin with either an ACEI or an ARB (even if
normotensive), hypertension should be treated to goal, and glycemic control
should be optimized. These treatments can slow the progression of diabetic
nephropathy. If the patient develops clinical macroalbuminuria (>300 mcg/mg or
300 mg/24 hours) modest dietary protein restriction to 0.8 g/kg/day may help slow
progression of this renal complication.
Serum creatinine should be measured annually in patients with both T1DM and
T2DM. Calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be done
using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. The MDRD
eGFR
formula
can
be
found
at:
www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.cfm.
Recent studies have shown that kidney function can decline in the absence of
albuminuria and retain pathologic features of diabetic nephropathy. Careful
attention to blood pressure and glycemic control, along with the use of ACEIs or
ARBs, can slow the progression of kidney disease.
When the eGFR is <60 mL/minute/1.73 m2 by the modified MDRD formula, testing
for anemia, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone should be undertaken and
abnormal values treated. A referral to a nephrologist is recommended in all
patients with eGFR <60 mL/minute/1.73 m2, regardless of etiology.

Neuropathy
Neuropathy is considered a microvascular complication of diabetes, which can
present in several forms, generally categorized as focal or diffuse and involving
peripheral sensory, autonomic, or sensory plus motor pathways.1,2
The most common forms are distal symmetric sensorimotor diabetic
polyneuropathy (DPN) and autonomic neuropathy involving gastrointestinal,
genitourinary, and cardiovascular systems, as well as contributing to
hypoglycemic unawareness. Focal neuropathy is less common and typically
presents acutely.
Diagnosis of Neuropathy
352

Evaluation of possible neuropathy should begin with a thorough history of
symptoms such as pain, numbness, paresthesias, weakness in the feet or hands,
early satiety, or erectile dysfunction. A neurologic examination should be
performed annually and should evaluate deep tendon reflexes and various sensory
modalities (pain/temperature, vibration, light touch, and joint position sense).
Individuals with diabetes should undergo annual screening for DPN using tests
such as pinprick sensation, vibration perception (using a 128-Hz tuning fork), and
10 g monofilament sensory testing. Sensitivity of detecting DPN increases to
>87% with combination of these tests.
Sensory testing with a 10 g monofilament detects the presence or absence of
“protective sensation.” Loss of monofilament sensation and vibration is predictive
of foot ulcers.
Treatment of Neuropathy
Although there is no specific therapy that alters the course of DPN, strict control
of blood glucose, with attention to reducing glucose fluctuation, may prevent
progression.
Symptomatic pain relief can be attained, through the use of some anticonvulsant
medications, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors. Large-fiber neuropathies are managed with strength, gait, and balance
training; pain management; orthotics to treat and prevent foot deformities; and
surgical reconstruction in some cases. Small-fiber neuropathies are managed by
foot protection, supportive shoes with orthotics, regular foot and shoe inspection,
prevention of heat injury, and use of emollient creams.
Gastroparesis symptoms respond to dietary changes and prokinetics like
metoclopramide or erythromycin. Erectile dysfunction is treated with
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, intracorporeal or intraurethral
prostaglandins, vacuum devices, or penile prosthesis.
A multidisciplinary approach should be adopted to manage patients with foot
ulcers or at high risk for foot ulcers due to conditions such as Charcot deformity.

Lower Extremity Complications
Patients with diabetes develop foot problems owing to a combination of vascular
and neurologic compromise and poor wound healing.1,2
Diabetes is the leading cause of nontraumatic lower extremity amputation in the
United States.
Annual foot examinations should include evaluation of touch and vibration sense
353

(Semmes-Weinstein 10 g monofilament and 128 mHz tuning fork), deep tendon
reflexes, and pedal pulses. At every visit, the feet should be visually inspected for
skin breakdown, callus, discoloration, or signs of vascular or neurologic disease.
Individuals with foot ulcers or at high risk for foot ulcers should be managed by a
multidisciplinary team to ensure healing and prevent recurrence.

ANTIPLATELET THERAPY
Treatment with low-dose (75 to 162 mg/day) aspirin has been shown to reduce
recurrence of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (~30%) and
stroke (~20%) in persons with diabetes.
Low-dose aspirin is recommended as primary prevention measure for individuals
with T1DM and T2DM at increased cardiovascular risk (10-year risk >10%).
The evidence is, however, insufficient to recommend aspirin in lower risk
individuals. Aspirin should be used as a secondary prevention strategy in those
patients with CVD with diabetes.
Other antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel are a reasonable alternative to aspirin
when the patient is intolerant to aspirin.

Screening for Cardiovascular Disease
Routine screening of asymptomatic patients for coronary artery disease is not
recommended by the ADA due to evidence that shows no difference in outcome
measures with screening stress electrocardiograms and no difference in intensive
medical therapy versus invasive revascularization. However, individuals with
typical or atypical cardiac symptoms and an abnormal resting ECG should undergo
exercise stress cardiac testing.1

IMMUNIZATIONS
Influenza vaccine should be administered annually to all diabetic patients ≥6
months of age, beginning each October.
The pneumococcal vaccine should be administered once the diagnosis of diabetes
is established to all patients ≥2 years of age. Other specific vaccines are left to
clinical judgment.

INPATIENT MANAGEMENT
Hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients is recognized as an important modifiable
contributor to increased morbidity and mortality. Persons with diabetes (whether
354

previously diagnosed or not) are admitted to the hospital more often than
individuals without diabetes, and the stress of acute illness and surgery can cause
hyperglycemia in previously nondiabetic individuals. Therefore, more than half of
patients in some intensive care units (ICUs) and 25% of ward patients will
require management of hyperglycemia.16
In a joint consensus statement, the ADA and AACE made the following
recommendations:
Identify all patients with a known diagnosis of diabetes clearly in the medical
record.
Measure blood glucose on admission and institute point-of-care glucose testing
in all patients with a prior diagnosis of diabetes, in those with hyperglycemia
identified in the hospital, and in those with high-risk medical or surgical
illnesses or procedures.
Target blood glucose for non-ICU, nonpregnant patients should be premeal of
<140 mg/dL, with random blood glucose values <180 mg/dL. To avoid
hypoglycemia, the insulin regimen should be reassessed if blood glucose
declines below 100 mg/dL.
Target blood glucose for ICU patients should be maintained between 140 and
180 mg/dL.
Use of continuous insulin infusion has been shown to be the most effective
method to achieve glycemic control in ICU settings, to treat diabetes
hyperglycemic emergencies, and in labor and delivery.
Scheduled subcutaneous insulin for medical and surgical ward patients should
include the following components:
Basal insulin using an intermediate (NPH) or long-acting (glargine or
detemir) insulin preparation, which should be marked “Do not hold.”
Prandial insulin using a rapid-acting preparation (lispro, aspart, glulisine),
with orders to give immediately with the meal and held if the meal is missed
or not eaten.
Correction factor using a rapid-acting preparation (lispro, aspart, glulisine),
to be given at prespecified times and at intervals at least 4 hours apart to
avoid stacking doses.
Orders for treatment of hypoglycemia with oral carbohydrate source if mild and
the patient is able to take oral nutrients (intravenous if unable to handle oral
intake) should be prespecified, along with retest intervals and physician
notification.
Safety is of paramount importance in the management of inpatient
355

hyperglycemia, so a systems approach with appropriate training, boundaries,
and monitoring is needed to ensure success.
Follow-up of patients who were hyperglycemic during their hospital stay is
appropriate, either to adjust newly instituted therapy or to perform diagnostic
testing for diabetes.

OUTCOMES
Optimum care of patients with diabetes prevents acute complications and reduces
the risk of development of long-term complications of this disease. This can be
accomplished through patient education, regular health screening, medical care,
laboratory evaluation, and timely referral to specialists.

Diabetes Mellitus Type 1
Judit Dunai and Janet B. McGill
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an illness in which autoimmune destruction of
pancreatic beta cells causes insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia.
Insulin deficiency can lead to acute metabolic decompensation known as diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA); however, exogenous insulin taken in excess can produce
life-threatening hypoglycemia.
Chronic hyperglycemia is the root cause of disabling microvascular complications
and contributes to macrovascular disease.
The treatment goal of T1DM is normalization of blood glucose (BG) by
physiologically based insulin replacement therapy.

Epidemiology
The overall prevalence of the disease is 0.25% to 0.5% of the population, or 1 in
400 children and 1 in 200 adults in the United States.
The incidence of T1DM is increasing in developed countries, and it is appearing
at younger ages.1,2
The peak onset occurs at age 10 to 12 years, but it can be diagnosed from a few
months of age into the ninth decade of life.
Males and females are equally affected.
T1DM accounts for 5% to 10% of all cases of diabetes and needs to be accurately
diagnosed so that insulin therapy is not delayed or withheld inappropriately.

Etiology and Pathogenesis
The autoimmune process that selectively destroys pancreatic beta cells is Tcell mediated with an unknown antigenic stimulus, in genetically susceptible
individuals.3,4
Environmental factors, including coxsackie and rubella viruses, and dietary
factors, such as early exposure to cow’s milk, have been implicated.
358

Insulitis (lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islets) is an early finding,
followed by apoptosis of beta cells, which leads to their virtual absence later
in the disease course.
Antibodies to beta-cell antigens can be found in the majority of patients before
diagnosis, and for some time after the onset of clinical diabetes.
These disease markers are antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase
(GAD65), to tyrosine phosphatases IA-2 and IA-2 beta, and to insulin (IAA).
Of these markers, GAD65 is positive in 80% of children and adults near the
time of diagnosis, whereas IA-2 and IAA are positive in ~50% of children
and are less likely to be present in adults.
The presence of two antibodies has high sensitivity and specificity for rapid
progression to insulin dependency and may help clarify the diagnosis in some
patients.
In cases of T1DM in which no evidence of autoimmunity can be detected, the
classification used is idiopathic T1DM.
Several organ-specific autoimmune diseases occur with increased frequency in
patients with T1DM, including autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s and
Graves’ diseases), Addison’s disease, pernicious anemia, celiac sprue, vitiligo,
alopecia, and chronic active hepatitis.5,6
In a study of 265 adults with T1DM, the risk of thyroid disease was 32% for the
proband, 25% for siblings, and 42% for parents, with females more commonly
affected than males.
The risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease increases with age, so
periodic screening should continue throughout adulthood in patients with T1DM
and their family members.
The genetic susceptibility to T1DM is manifested by linkage with several gene
loci and association with HLA-DR and DQ.7
Genome-wide association studies identified additional risk loci BACH2,
C1QTNF6, CTSH, and PRKCQ.7
The IDDM1 gene located in the HLA region of chromosome 6p21.3, and the
IDDM2 gene in the region 5′ upstream of the insulin gene on chromosome
11p15.5 contribute 42% and 10%, respectively, to the observed familial
clustering.
In the family of a patient with T1DM, the risk of an identical twin developing
T1DM is 50%, an offspring is 6%, and a sibling is 5%.
The striking familial discordance supports the importance of environmental
factors.
359

Pathogenesis of Complications
Patients with both T1DM and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are susceptible to
organ dysfunction that is caused by long-term exposure to hyperglycemia and
which leads to devastating morbidity and mortality.8
The microvascular complications of diabetes are retinopathy, nephropathy, and
neuropathy.
Although they share some pathogenic features, they may not appear at the same
time or with the same severity in all individuals with diabetes. The pathogenesis
of each of these complications includes increased oxidative stress or the
generation of reactive oxygen species with inadequate scavenger activity.
Advanced glycation end-products are formed by processes of glycation and/or
oxidation of proteins, nucleotides, and lipids, and have intrinsic cellular
toxicity.
High levels of glucose and reactive oxygen species have been shown to increase
diacylglycerol and stimulate protein kinase C activity, causing alterations in
intracellular signal transduction and production of cytokines and growth
factors.9
Glucose enters peripheral nerves by mass action, is converted first to sorbitol by
aldose reductase, and is then converted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase.
These saccharides produce osmotic stress, increase glycation, and cause
alterations in the NADH/NAD ratio, which collectively contributes to nerve fiber
damage and loss leading to the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.
Diabetic retinopathy is associated with the adverse effects of hyperglycemia on
the vascular endothelium and upregulation of cytokines such as vascular
endothelial growth factor.
In diabetic nephropathy, hyperglycemia induces transforming growth factor β,
which stimulates matrix synthesis and inhibits matrix degradation in renal
mesangial cells. Investigational agents that target these processes are currently in
clinical development.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
T1DM develops most commonly in childhood but can present at any age.
Because 80% of cases occur without a positive family history, symptoms may be
overlooked until hyperglycemia reaches critical levels.
The prodromal symptoms are related to hyperglycemia and include weight loss,
360

polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, and blurred vision. If diabetic ketoacidosis
(DKA) is present, the patient might complain of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
myalgias, and shortness of breath and exhibit changes in mental and hemodynamic
status.
History
In previously diagnosed patients, the history of present illness should document
the duration of the illness, frequency of hyper- and hypoglycemia, results of selfmonitored BG (SMBG) testing, dietary habits, and the status of any microvascular
or macrovascular complications.
The history of present illness or medication history should record the insulin
regimen in detail and should provide an assessment of adequacy of, or problems
with, the regimen.
In female adolescents and adult women, menstrual, sexual, and gestational
histories should be elicited and the method of birth control should be documented.
Smoking behavior, alcohol and drug use, and socioeconomic status and social
support are all important factors in the care of a patient with T1DM.
Physical Examination
If the patient presents in DKA, signs of dehydration and acidosis, such as
tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, and dry mucus membranes, might be evident.
Fruity odor to the breath reflects the presence of ketones.
Routine follow-up physical examinations should document height, weight, and
Tanner staging in children to determine that growth and development are
advancing normally.
Blood pressure and heart rate are important measures for all patients with T1DM.
At least annually, the physical examination should include skin, funduscopic, oral,
thyroid, and cardiovascular examinations, as well as sensory testing and foot
screening.
Dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist is recommended at 3 to 5 years of
T1DM duration, with scheduling of repeat examinations based on clinical
findings.

Diagnostic Testing
The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, based upon the guidelines of the American
Diabetes Association (ADA) is one of four abnormalities of glucose
metabolism10:
361

Hyperglycemia symptoms and a random venous plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL.
Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL, confirmed on a second sample if <200
mg/dL.
Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) ≥6.5 percent (using an assay that is certified by the
National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program).
Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Two-hour plasma glucose level
of ≥200 mg/dL after ingestion of a 1.75 g/kg glucose drink. However, OGTT is
rarely needed to diagnose T1DM.
Typically, people with T1DM present with symptoms of hyperglycemia,
possibly DKA), and markedly elevated blood glucose, random plasma glucose
≥200 mg/dL.
After the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made, T1DM must be differentiated
from other types of diabetes.
This is based upon clinical presentation (body habitus, age, signs of insulin
resistance, history (family history), and if necessary, laboratory studies.
If patient has not had DKA and the diagnosis of T1DM is unclear, testing for
islet-specific pancreatic autoantibodies, GAD65, or the 40K fragment of
tyrosine phosphatase IA-2B (also known as ICA), or IAA or C-peptide level
can be useful.10
C-Peptide levels are typically low or undetectable in patients with T1DM.
Of note, the absence of pancreatic autoantibodies does not rule out T1DM.
Also, antibodies may be present in up to 30 percent of individuals with other
forms of diabetes.
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) should be measured 2 to 4 times per year, and a lipid
profile, serum creatinine and electrolytes, and urine microalbumin-to-creatinine
ratio should be checked at least annually in adolescents and adults. Screening for
thyroid antibodies is recommended, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
should be checked annually if the patient is antibody positive or has a goiter.10

TREATMENT
Goals of Treatment
The goal of diabetes treatment is to maintain the BG as close to normal as
possible and to avoid hypoglycemia.
All patients with T1DM require insulin therapy, and early achievement of a nearnormal HbA1c has been shown to preserve residual beta-cell function and to
reduce long-term complications.11
362

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and its follow-up study
have shown that every 1% reduction in HbA1c reduces retinopathy by 33%,11,12
microalbuminuria by 22%,13 and neuropathy by 38%.14
Tight control early on, during the first 5 to 10 years of diabetes before the
manifestation of complications, confers long-term risk reduction, supporting the
hypothesis that hyperglycemia induces organ toxicity that can be selfperpetuating (glycemic memory).
In children, the therapeutic goals include ensuring normal growth and development
and the scrupulous avoidance of severe hypoglycemia at young ages.
In the postpubertal adolescent and adult patient, maintenance of normal blood
pressure, achievement of target lipid levels, smoking cessation, aspirin use in
patients older than age 40, and preconception counseling are important treatment
goals. (Please refer to Chapter 27 for detailed recommendations.)

Glucose Monitoring
Patients with T1DM should be encouraged to do SMBG at least 4 times daily so
that appropriate insulin adjustments can be made based on ambient glucose levels.
These recommendations may be modified for children with school considerations.
Increased monitoring is required during acute illnesses, for intense exercise, and
before and during pregnancy.
Alternate site testing; rapid readings; and meters with averaging, graphing, and
download functions have helped patients with the challenging task of SMBG.
Periodic monitoring during the nighttime is recommended for all patients to
check for nocturnal hypoglycemia.
Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGM) are now available to assist
with diabetes management. This is a supplemental tool especially useful for
those with hypoglycemia unawareness.
CGM devices measure glucose level in the interstitial fluid on a nearcontinuous basis, providing information about the direction, magnitude and
duration of glycemic fluctuations.
The use of CGM-directed therapy has been shown to decrease the frequency
of hypoglycemia and improve HbA1c.15,16

Diet
Patients should receive Medical Nutrition Thereapy (MNT), which is an
individualized assessment and instruction on diet and is most effectively
provided by a registered dietitian.
363

The caloric requirement for people with moderate physical activity is
approximately 35 kcal/kg/day, but there is significant variation from person-toperson and day-to-day.10
Individualized instruction should consider the patient’s caloric needs, ethnicity,
habits, constraints, and prescribed insulin regimen.
The diet for patients with diabetes should aim to achieve an ideal HbA1c, blood
pressure, and lipid profile.
Attention should be payed to balancing energy intake and expenditure to avoid
excess weight gain.
Patients on fixed-dose insulin regimens need to have a consistent day-to-day
carbohydrate intake.
Mastery of either an exchange system or carbohydrate-counting allows for
flexibility in meal planning, and helps avoid postprandial hypo- or
hyperglycemia.5
Review of dietary principles is a cost-effective way to help the patient achieve
treatment targets.

Medications
Insulin Therapy
Insulin regimens must be individualized to cater to a given patient’s lifestyle and
comorbidities.
Insulin types and pharmacokinetics are shown in Table 28-1.
Flexible insulin regimens with multiple daily injections (MDI) or use of an
insulin pump can best approximate the physiologic insulin response (Table 28-2).
Insulin prescriptions consisting of a long-acting basal, and rapid-acting
preprandial insulin formulations (given based on carbohydrate intake), are best
suited for reaching HbA1c goals while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia.
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via an insulin pump has the
added benefit of allowing for variable basal rates and flexibility in delivering
bolus insulin doses.
TABLE 28-1 INSULIN TYPES AND PHARMACOKINETICSA

364

TABLE 28-2 MDI INSULIN DOSING REGIMEN

The DCCT and other studies have clearly demonstrated that patients are more
likely to achieve glycemic targets using intensified insulin therapy with basal
and bolus components than with conventional therapy with one or two
injections.11
Decisions about the appropriate insulin regimen should be made with the
365

patient’s abilities and scheduling constraints in mind.
In general, patients need an intermediate- or long-acting insulin to cover basal
needs and a rapid- or short-acting insulin to provide meal coverage.
When initiating or changing an insulin regimen, an estimation of the total daily
dose (TDD) should be made. Individual requirements vary, but usually range
from 0.5 to 0.8 U/kg/day, higher if insulin resistance is present.
Historically, the most widely prescribed regimen was “split-mixed,” which used
NPH as the basal insulin and a short- or rapid-acting analog before breakfast and
dinner.
Use of this regimen presumed that the patient would eat lunch at a standard time,
because the morning NPH is likely to peak at about midday. Patient scheduling
problems and the erratic pharmacokinetics of NPH have made this regimen less
popular.
If NPH is used, the dose will be about 0.2 U/kg, twice a day.
The most commonly prescribed regimens for patients with T1DM by
endocrinologists today are MDI or CSII. These regimens use the concepts of
basal and bolus (premeal) dosing.
Multiple Daily Injections
The basal dose is generally 45% to 55% of the total daily dose (TDD), ~0.4
U/kg/day, and is often given in one injection of insulin, glargine or detemir, at
bedtime. Many patients take their basal insulin in the morning, or about 0.2 U/kg
twice daily.
The basal insulin dose is adjusted so that the fasting BG is routinely within the
target of 80 to 120 mg/dL, and there is <30 mg/dL variation between evening
and morning values.
Changes in weight, exercise, persistent hyperglycemia, or frequent
hypoglycemia should prompt reconsideration of the basal insulin dose.
Bolus doses are administered to cover carbohydrate intake and to correct high BG
readings. Premeal bolus doses are determined by one or more of the following
methods:
Fixed amount before each meal, ~0.13 U/kg or one-sixth of the TDD.
Fixed dose before each meal as above plus a sliding scale “correction factor”
(see subsequent text) based on the premeal SMBG.
Carbohydrate counting plus “correction factor” uses variable amounts
depending on the anticipated carbohydrate intake and the premeal SMBG.
Both the patient and the physician need to learn important concepts to succeed in
366

the use of MDI regimens. If fixed amounts of premeal insulin are to be used, the
patient should have a clear idea of the prescribed meal plan and be able to
follow it precisely.
Alternatively, the patient can adjust the premeal dose based on the anticipated
carbohydrate content, which allows greater flexibility. To do this, the physician
or diabetes educator must determine the “insulin-to-carbohydrate” ratio,
which can be calculated by dividing 500 by the TDD.
A patient who takes 50 U of insulin daily needs 1 U of insulin for every 10 g
of carbohydrate intake.
The patient needs to learn which foods contain carbohydrate, how to estimate
the grams of carbohydrate in the serving provided, and how to calculate the
premeal dose.
Additional adjustments are sometimes made for high-fat meals or for meals
that have high fiber content.
Occasional postprandial SMBG is needed to test whether the “insulin- tocarbohydrate” ratio is correct or whether the patient has been able to
estimate the carbohydrate content of the meal appropriately.
In addition to covering calories, the patient must be able to compensate for high
or low BG readings. An individualized sliding scale, known as the correction
factor is determined, which provides the number of units to be added (or
subtracted) to each premeal dose. The correction factor is estimated by
dividing 1800 by the TDD.
Sample Calculations
Example 1: a modestly overweight patient takes 60 U of insulin daily. His current
BG is 178 mg/dL, and he is about to eat a meal with 90 g of carbohydrate. His
physician has told him that his target SMBG is 120 mg/dL. What dose of rapidacting insulin should he take?
Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio = 500/60 = 1 U insulin/8.33 g.
Correction factor = 1800/60 = 30 (predicts that 1 U insulin drops the BG 30
mg/dL) 90 g carbohydrates/8.33 g/U insulin = ~10 U insulin to cover
carbohydrates.
SMBG – target BG = 178 mg/dL – 120 = 58 mg/dL. He will take 2 U insulin as
correction.
Thus, the patient should take 12 U of rapid-acting insulin.
Example 2: a thin, insulin-sensitive patient takes 30 U of insulin per day. If this
patient has a current BG of 178 mg/dL and is about to eat her usual meal
367

containing 45 grams of carbohydrate, how much insulin should she use?
Insulin to carbohydrate ratio = 500/30 = 1 U insulin/16.66 g.
Correction factor = 1800/30 = 60 (predicts that 1 U insulin will drop the BG 60
mg/dL).
45 g carbohydrates/16.66 g/U insulin = ~3 U insulin to cover carbohydrates.
SMBG – target BG = 178 – 120 = 58 mg/dL.
She will take 1 U insulin as correction.
Thus, this patient should take 4 U of rapid-acting insulin. Using an insulin pen
that provides doses in half units, this patient may elect to take 3.5 units.
Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion
Insulin pump therapy has become an accepted alternative to MDI and has both
advantages and disadvantages.
Technologic advances have contributed to smaller pumps with features such as
multiple basal rates, dose calculators, and alternate dosing modalities.
CSII systems now include continuous glucose monitoring, which assist with dosing
adjustments. CSII offers the patient with T1DM the greatest flexibility and is more
socially acceptable than needles and syringes for frequent dosing. Insulin pumps
are the size of a pager and contain 180 to 300 U of insulin in a specialized syringe
that is connected to a subcutaneous (SC) catheter by thin tubing.
The SC catheter should be changed and repositioned every 3 days. The pump is
preprogrammed to infuse the basal rate of insulin, but the patient must activate the
pump to deliver bolus doses at the time of the meal or when a correction is
needed.
Only rapid-acting insulin is used. Diabetes education from an educator
experienced in CSII is necessary to teach the patient how to use the pump, which
requires several hours of instruction.
Insulin dose prescribing is conceptually similar to MDI; however, the TDD is
reduced 10% to 20%.
The basal rate (equal to one-half of the new TDD) is divided by 24 and
programmed as an hourly rate. For example, a patient taking 48 U/day with
MDI will need ~20 U for basal requirements, or ~0.8 U/hour to start. The basal
rate can be adjusted to accommodate nighttime low BG, morning rise, and
increased or decreased activity during the day. The basal rate can be
temporarily reduced for exercise or the pump can be put in suspended mode for
hypoglycemia.
Bolus dosing is handled similarly to MDI, with a key exception. Today’s insulin
368

pumps can administer doses in very small quantities, so the correction factor
can be prescribed as a fraction. The opportunity to give smaller doses is
helpful for children and insulin-sensitive patients.
The major disadvantage of CSII is the high cost of an insulin pump and supplies.
Because only rapid-acting insulin is used, if there is a pump or catheter failure,
the BG can rise quickly and DKA can ensue within 12 hours of the interruption of
insulin delivery.
Another potential disadvantage is the risk of catheter-site infection, which is
minimized by instruction in semi-sterile techniques.
Adjusting Insulin Doses
Insulin dose adjustments or changes to the insulin regimen are made after
evaluating SMBG values and looking for patterns.
The efficacy of a specific rapid-acting insulin dose is monitored by the SMBG
that follows the dose in question (e.g., postprandial or noon SMBG reflects the
breakfast dose of rapid-acting insulin).
Intermediate and long-acting insulin doses are evaluated by scrutinizing the SMBG
after the injection (e.g., morning SMBG to determine adequacy of evening dose)
and review of overall frequency of hyper- and hypoglycemia.
Diabetes educators are skilled at insulin dose adjustments and provide a valuable
resource for patients who are experiencing problems keeping their glucose values
near the target range.
Diabetes education is cost-effective and necessary to achieve tight glycemic
control while avoiding hypoglycemic episodes.
Adjunct Therapy
Pramlintide (Symlin), a synthetic analog of the beta-cell secretory product amylin,
is approved for use as adjunctive therapy to insulin in patients with T1DM. It is
given as a separate injection of 15 to 45 mcg before meals, and helps reduce
postprandial glucose excursions by suppressing glucagon and enhancing satiety.
It has a modest effect on HbA1c of about 0.5%, and may contribute to modest
weight loss. Side effects are nausea, vomiting, and increased risk of
hypoglycemia. Insulin adjustments are needed when pramlintide is prescribed.17,18

Diabetic Ketoacidosis
DKA is the direct result of relative insulin deficiency; dehydration and excess
counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol) are
369

accelerating factors.
Typically, an exacerbating factor can be identified: new diagnosis of diabetes,
omission of insulin doses, infection, pregnancy, trauma, emotional stress,
excessive alcohol ingestion, myocardial infarction, stroke, intercurrent illness,
hyperthyroidism, Cushing’s disease, or, rarely, pheochromocytoma.
The major clinical features of DKA are hyperglycemia, dehydration, acidosis,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, change in hemodynamic status, and altered
mental status.
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of DKA begins with insulin levels that are insufficient to
support peripheral glucose uptake and to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis.
Hyperglycemia is further driven by increases in the counterregulatory hormones
glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, and growth hormone. Activation of catabolic
pathways in muscle and fat produce amino acids and free fatty acids, which fuel
hepatic gluconeogenesis and ketone production.
The osmotic diuresis imposed by hyperglycemia causes marked fluid and
electrolyte losses, further stimulating catecholamine release.
Catecholamines are antagonistic to insulin action and contribute to increased
lipolysis, which pumps free fatty acids into the circulation that then undergo fatty
acid oxidation to ketone bodies.
Volume depletion decreases renal blood flow, which contributes to reduced
excretion of glucose and ketones and increased serum levels of creatinine and
potassium.
Acidosis ensues when the levels of acetone, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate
exceed the buffering capacity of bicarbonate and the respiratory response.
Low Paco2 reflects the respiratory effort and the severity of the metabolic
acidosis.
The presence of an anion gap and low bicarbonate in the setting of high BG and an
ill-appearing patient should prompt immediate treatment for DKA while
confirmatory laboratory evaluation is under way. The differential diagnosis for
anion-gap acidosis is outlined in Table 28-3.
Symptoms
The symptoms of DKA are nonspecific and include anorexia, nausea, vomiting
(coffee ground emesis in 25%), abdominal pain, and myalgias or weakness.
Polyuria and polydipsia are characteristic of high BG, but may become blunted
370

due to vomiting, reduced renal clearance, and altered mental status as the severity
of DKA worsens.
Hyperpnea is noted with mild acidosis, and the patient may complain of shortness
of breath. Kussmaul breathing is a sign of a critically ill patient.
The physical examination reveals tachycardia, hypotension, or orthostatic
hypotension, dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, abdominal tenderness, and
other signs of clinical events that may have prompted the DKA episode. Mental
status can be normal or severely compromised. Signs of a concurrent illness or
event that precipitated the DKA may be present.
Laboratory Findings
Laboratory findings of DKA include the following: glucose >250 mg/dL,
glycosuria, an elevated anion gap (normal gap is ≤12), and the presence of serum
or urine ketones.
The anion gap is calculated as follows: (Anion gap = Na+ – [Cl + HCO3]). The
serum bicarbonate is typically <15 mEq/L, the PCO2 <40 mm Hg, and the arterial
pH <7.3.
Creatinine and K+ are generally increased above baseline.
If hypokalemia is present at the time of diagnosis, the patient has severe K+
depletion and requires careful monitoring.
TABLE 28-3 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ANION-GAP ACIDOSIS
(THE MUDPILES MNEMONIC)

371

Often the initial potassium level is high, and the ECG should be checked for
signs of hyperkalemia, which include peaked T waves, shortened QT intervals,
widened QRS complexes, and flattened or absent P waves.
Later in the course of treatment, if hypokalemia occurs, a repeat ECG might
show ST-segment depression, flattened or inverted T waves, a prolonged QT
interval, and appearance of U waves.
Hyponatremia may be present, but the measured serum sodium should be corrected
for the high glucose (add 1.6 to the reported sodium for every 100 mg/dL that the
glucose is >100 mg/dL), and may be further depressed by high triglycerides.
Amylase and lipase may be elevated via unclear mechanisms, do not necessarily
indicate pancreatitis, and resolve with treatment of the DKA.
Treatment of DKA
Clinical Evaluation and Triage
Intensive care admission is required for patients with hemodynamic instability or
mental status changes, for pediatric patients, or if frequent monitoring is not
possible on a medical ward.
Hemodynamic monitoring may be required for patients in shock, with possible
sepsis, with DKA complicated by myocardial infarction, or in patients with endstage renal disease or chronic heart failure.
372

Nasogastric tube placement may be needed for patients with hematemesis or for
comatose patients.
Fluids and Electrolytes
Fluid resuscitation in adults should begin with normal saline at 1 L/hour unless
there is a contraindication (chronic heart failure, end-stage renal disease).
The typical total body water deficit is 4 to 6 L, sodium deficit is 7 to 10
mEq/kg, K+ deficit is 3 to 5 mEq/kg, and PO4 deficit is 5 to 7 mmol/kg. If the
corrected sodium is normal or high on repeat testing, change the intravenous
fluids to 0.45% NaCl; continue 0.9% saline if it is low.
When the K+ drops to <5.0 mEq/L and the patient has adequate urine output, add
20 to 30 mEq K+ to each liter of intravenous fluid.
Plan to correct the water and salt deficits over 24 hours, slower in children. The
starting fluid administration rate for children should be 10 to 20 mL/kg/hour
and should not exceed 50 mL/kg over the first 4 hours of therapy.
Patients presenting with DKA have a total body PO4 depletion due to osmotic
diuresis, although this may not be apparent on presentation because insulin
deficiency and acidosis cause PO4 to shift out of cells. Serum PO4 levels decrease
with insulin therapy. Except in very severe cases of hypophosphatemia (serum
PO4 <1.0 mg/dL) or concomitant cardiorespiratory compromise, routine
administration of PO4 has not been shown to be beneficial and may, in fact, be
harmful because excess replacement can cause hypocalcemia.
Bicarbonate therapy in DKA is controversial and it should not be routinely
administered, unless the serum pH is <7.0 or the patient has life-threatening
hyperkalemia.
Insulin and Glucose
Initial intravenous loading bolus 0.1 to 0.15 U/kg of regular (R) insulin followed by
continuous infusion 0.1 U/kg/hour (100 units R insulin/100 mL normal saline
solution). Children should not receive intravenous bolus doses of insulin; infusion
should be started.14
Monitor serum glucose every hour and expect the BG to decline by 50 to 75
mg/dL/hour. A slower response could indicate insulin resistance, inadequate fluid
resuscitation, or improper insulin delivery.
As the acidosis clears, the glucose is likely to fall more rapidly. When the serum
glucose is <250 mg/dL, add 5% dextrose to the intravenous fluids, and decrease
the insulin infusion rate by up to one-half.
If the glucose infusion rate is kept stable, the insulin infusion requirements will be
373

more predictable.
Continue intensive insulin therapy and monitoring until the patient is tolerating oral
intake and the anion-gap acidosis has resolved. As the acidosis resolves, the
anion gap closes, arterial and venous pH rise, and serum bicarbonate rises.
The ADA position paper regarding the treatment of DKA states that criteria for the
resolution of DKA include a glucose <200 mg/dL, a serum bicarbonate ≥18
mEq/L, and a venous pH >7.3.19,20
Patients recovering from DKA may develop a transient non–anion gap
hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis that occurs because of urinary loss of
“potential bicarbonate” in the form of ketoanions and their replacement by
chloride ions from intravenous fluids. This non–anion-gap acidosis is transient
and has not been shown to be clinically significant, except in renal failure.
Common error: the hyperglycemia will respond to treatment faster than the
acidosis will resolve. Do not decrease or discontinue the insulin infusion
when glucose levels approach the normal range. This can lead to worsening
of the ketoacidosis. Instead, continue the intravenous insulin infusion, but adjust
the dose and/or add 5% dextrose. If 5% dextrose is infused at excessively rapid
rates, the BG will increase, and the transition to SC insulin will be delayed.
Monitoring
Fingerstick BG every hour during insulin infusion.
Electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels every 2 to 4 hours
until the K+ has stabilized and the anion gap acidosis is resolved.
Serum ketones or β-hydroxybutyrate level by fingerstick on admission only. Use of
the fingerstick β-hydroxybutyrate test to follow DKA treatment is under review.
Intake and output, weight.
Transition to Subcutaneous Insulin
Continue the intravenous insulin infusion and intravenous fluids until the acidosis
has cleared, the glucose is <250 mg/dL, and the patient is able to eat.
Note: it is possible for the patient to attempt a small or clear liquid meal while
on an insulin drip, but the drip rate may need to be increased for the meal hour
and then returned to the usual rate.
Make the transition to subcutaneous insulin before a meal or at bedtime, but not
during the middle of the night or between meals.
If the patient has been previously diagnosed, give the usual premeal insulin dose
plus any correction factor, and cover basal needs with intermediate- or longacting insulin.
374

For example, if the drip can be stopped at noon, give a premeal dose of shortacting insulin according to the patient’s usual schedule and add a partial dose
of NPH to cover until dinner or bedtime.
Start basal insulin (NPH, detemir [Levemir], or glargine [Lantus]) and shortacting insulin 1 to 2 hours before stopping the insulin drip.
Reduce the rate of intravenous dextrose to ≤100 mL/hour or discontinue it if
the patient is able to eat.
Note that intravenous fluids may need to be continued until the serum
creatinine has returned to baseline.
Problem Solving
Recurring DKA should prompt additional history to search for precipitating causes.
Insulin pump malfunction, noncompliance with insulin doses, social distress,
medication problems, or concomitant illness should warrant attention of an
experienced diabetes care provider.
Newly diagnosed patients require additional time in the hospital for the institution
of an insulin regimen and diabetes education.

CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
Care of the patient with T1DM includes screening for microvascular and
macrovascular complications, and the application of proven therapies to reduce
morbidity and mortality.
Tight glycemic control prevents against macrovascular disease, as established by
the DCCT and the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications
(EDIC) study.11,12,13
Maintaining strict glycemic control in type 1 diabetics has beneficial effects on
primary and secondary prevention of microvascular complications; this was
demonstrated by the DCCT.11
The best-studied intervention in T1DM is the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs) to prevent progression of microalbuminuria to
macroalbuminuria and slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy.21
ACEIs may also slow the progression of retinopathy.
ACEIs should be started if blood pressure increases above the normal range for
the patient’s age or even at or below goal blood pressure (130/80) when
persistent microalbuminuria is identified.10
ACEIs should be avoided in premenopausal women who are not using effective
birth control, are planning a pregnancy, or who are pregnant, due to the risk of
375

birth defects.
Blood pressure control, lipid parameters, and other prevention measures are
covered in Chapter 27 and Chapter 29.
Preconception counseling is mandatory for young women with T1DM, and very
tight glucose control with near-normalization of glucoses is recommended before
conception and during pregnancy for optimal maternal and fetal outcomes.

Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
Zhiyu Wang and Janet B. McGill
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) results from a combination of resistance to
insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response.1
It is a metabolic disorder with carbohydrate intolerance as the cardinal feature.

Epidemiology
Diabetes has an estimated total prevalence of 23.5 million among people ≥20
years of age, or 10.7% of the adult population.2 T2DM accounts for about 95% of
all cases of diabetes in the United States and is a growing public health concern.
Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and a leading
cause of morbidity and mortality in other countries.
Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, blindness in individuals
age 20 to 74 years, and nontraumatic limb amputation.
The major cause of mortality in diabetes is cardiovascular, and the diagnosis of
diabetes confers a two- to four-fold increase in cardiovascular risk.

Etiology
The etiology of T2DM is multifactorial. It is complex and involves the interaction of
genetic and environmental factors.
Patients often have a family history of T2DM, supporting the role of genetic
predisposition in the pathogenesis.
Genome-wide association studies have contributed to our understanding of the
genetic architecture of T2DM. While many genetic loci have been associated with
T2DM, these new discoveries represent but a small proportion of the genetic
variation underlying the susceptibility to this disorder.3
A number of environmental factors have been shown to play a critical role in the
378

development of T2DM.
Sex, age, and ethnic background are important factors in determining risk of
developing T2DM.
Excessive caloric intake leading to obesity, especially visceral adiposity, and
physical inactivity contribute significantly to insulin resistance and, in
epidemiologic studies, are the factors associated with the increasing incidence
of T2DM.
Lifestyle modification that includes weight loss and exercise improves insulin
resistance and prevents diabetes in high-risk cohorts.4

Pathophysiology
Insulin resistance, the inability of cells to respond to stimulation by insulin, is
present in most individuals with T2DM.5
Insulin resistance precedes the onset of T2DM by years.
The cellular features of insulin resistance include reduction of nonoxidative
glucose storage as glycogen, impaired fatty acid oxidation and reduced ability
to switch between fatty acid and glucose oxidation during hyperinsulinemia.
Mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity may be reduced in insulinresponsive tissues of persons with insulin resistance.6
Inflammation also plays a role in insulin resistance, and elevated levels of free
fatty acids and inflammatory markers are present. Insulin sensitivity declines
with age, but this may be due to the changes in body composition that occur
with aging.7
Insulin deficiency, on the other hand, typically follows a period of
hyperinsulinemia, which compensates for insulin resistance.8
The initial defects in insulin secretion are loss of first-phase insulin release and
loss of the oscillatory secretion pattern. The clinical correlate of this early
defect is postprandial hyperglycemia. Further decline in insulin secretion leads
to inadequate suppression of hepatic glucose output and presents clinically as
fasting hyperglycemia.
Hyperglycemia and T2DM develop when insulin secretion by pancreatic beta
cells is inadequate to meet the metabolic demand.
Hyperglycemia contributes to impaired beta-cell function and worsening insulin
deficiency, a phenomenon known as glucose toxicity.
Chronic elevation of free fatty acids, another characteristic of T2DM, may
contribute to reduced insulin secretion and islet cell apoptosis.
There are no definitive histopathologic findings of insulin resistance; however,
379

increased cellular triglyceride and reduced numbers of mitochondria may be seen.
Histopathologic changes in the islets of Langerhans in long-standing T2DM
include amyloid accumulation and a reduction in the number of insulin-producing
beta cells.
Longitudinal data from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) suggest
progressive beta-cell failure occurs during the lifespan of individuals with
T2DM. Early in the course of diabetes, improvement in insulin secretion can be
achieved by reducing insulin resistance and improving hyperglycemia, thereby
reducing the functional defects imposed by hyperglycemia and elevated free fatty
acids.9
The definitive tests for insulin resistance measure insulin-mediated glucose uptake
and/or hepatic glucose output and are available in research settings.
In the clinical settings, insulin resistance is often inferred when features of the
metabolic syndrome are present, with or without a diagnosis of diabetes.

Classification
In addition to type 1 diabetes (T1DM), T2DM, and gestational DM, the American
Diabetes Association (ADA) classifies a heterogeneous group of hyperglycemic
disorders as “other specific types of diabetes.”1
The most common of this group of disorders are the drug- or chemical-induced
forms of diabetes. Typical offending agents include glucocorticoids, nicotinic acid,
thiazides, β-adrenergic agonists, atypical antipsychotic agents, and some
antiretroviral agents. Hyperglycemia can be relatively mild or quite severe with the
institution of these therapies.
Pancreatic disease can result in partial or complete insulin deficiency. Patients
with hemochromatosis or advanced cystic fibrosis may present with nonketotic
hyperglycemia. Pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, pancreatic neoplasia, or
fibrocalculous pancreatopathy may cause insulin deficiency, and insulin therapy
may be needed early in the course of the illness.
TABLE 29-1 MONOGENIC FORMS OF DIABETES

380

Diabetes can occur with critical illness and other endocrine diseases such as
Cushing’s syndrome and acromegaly. Resolution of the diabetes often occurs
when the hormone excess is corrected.
Diabetes can be due to genetic defects of the beta-cell and/or insulin action. It
consists of monogenic and polygenic forms.
The monogenic forms of diabetes generally occur in young patients, often in the
first two to three decades of life, although if only mild asymptomatic elevations
in blood glucose (BG) occur the diagnosis may be missed until later in life
(Table 29-1).10
Maturity-onset diabetes in the young (MODY) is one of the common
monogenetic forms of diabetes. It is a genetically and clinically
heterogeneous group of disorders resulting from mutations in any one of at
least six different genes, which cause a primary defect in pancreatic beta cell
function. MODY often presents with mild to moderate nonketotic
hyperglycemia in young adults with a family history. Obesity and insulin
resistance are not characteristic features of MODY. Most of the T2DM that
is diagnosed in children and teenagers is not MODY, but is rather early onset
classic T2DM.11
There are other rare monogenetic forms of diabetes, including mitochondrial
381

gene defects and defects in the insulin molecule or insulin receptor (type A
insulin resistance).
TABLE 29-2 METABOLIC SYNDROME

Patients with Down’s syndrome, patients with Prader–Willi syndrome, and
others may develop diabetes as a consequence of obesity.
Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is an insulin-deficient form of
diabetes that develops more slowly than classic T1DM and is associated with
other autoimmune diseases.12 The majority of patients with LADA require
exogenous insulin within 5 years of diagnosis. Later in the course of the illness,
patients with LADA may become C-peptide negative and are at risk for
ketoacidosis. When LADA is suspected, testing for anti-GAD antibodies and Cpeptide may help rule in or rule out the diagnosis.

Risk Factors
Individuals at high risk for the development of T2DM can often be identified before
the onset of clinical diabetes.13 Risk factors for the development of T2DM include
Older age
Overweight or obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m2)
Physical inactivity
First-degree relative with diabetes
Members of high-risk ethnic population (e.g., African American, Latino, Native
American, Asian American, Pacific Islander)
Women who delivered a baby weighing >9 lb or were diagnosed with gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM)
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome
A1C ≥5.7%, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG)
Other conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., metabolic syndrome,14
defined as three or more of the characteristics listed in Table 29-2, acanthosis
nigricans)
382

Diagnosis
Clinical Presentation
Mild hyperglycemia is asymptomatic. Patients presenting with symptoms of
polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia, polyphagia, fatigue, weight changes, or blurred
vision are likely to have significant BG elevation and may have been undiagnosed
for some time.
Patients who present with complaints of extremity pain, sexual dysfunction, or
visual changes from diabetic retinopathy are likely to have been hyperglycemic
for years before being diagnosed with diabetes.
History
Medical history of a patient with diabetes should include documentation of:
The onset and progression of diabetes, with information about episodes of diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA), prior response to medications, and level of glycemic control.
Health behaviors, such as frequency of self-monitoring of BG, use of medical
nutrition therapy (MNT), and exercise frequency and intensity, should be
recorded.
Usual BG values and problems with both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia require
assessment to plan changes in therapy.
Symptoms of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia should be elicited to augment a
careful review of glucose records or meter readings.
The past medical history (PMH) should record history of diabetes-related
complications.
Macrovascular: coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral
vascular disease.
Microvascular: retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy including history of
foot ulceration or joint problems.
Other: psychosocial problems, dental disease.
The vaccine status should be recorded. Menstrual history, pregnancy history,
and use of contraception need to be addressed in the PMH of adolescent and
adult women.
Physical Examination
Physical examination may be completely normal or may include hypertension,
obesity, or acanthosis nigricans.
Funduscopic examination may be normal or abnormal (dot hemorrhages, exudates,
383

neovascularization, or laser scars).
The cardiovascular examination for patients with diabetes should include carotid
and peripheral pulses.
Examination of the feet, including skin, nails, joints, and sensation with a 10 g
Semmes-Weinstein monofilament, should be done at regular intervals.
The diagnosis of neuropathy is based on a combination of symptoms and physical
findings, with documented decrease in more than one sensory modality (e.g.,
absent reflexes plus loss of vibratory sensation).

Diagnostic Criteria
Classically, diabetes has been diagnosed on the basis of prospective
epidemiologic data associating circulating glucose levels with the future
development of diabetes retinopathy. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes and
prediabetic conditions are listed in Table 29-3.
ADA current criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes1
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5%;
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL and confirmed on a second sample;
2-hour plasma glucose is ≥200 mg/dL after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT);
Or a random BG of ≥200 mg/dL accompanied by classic symptoms of
hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis.
In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, tests should be confirmed by
repeat testing.
Categories of increased risk for diabetes
This is an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels do not meet
criteria for diabetes, yet are higher than those considered normal.1
TABLE 29-3 DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES

384

They have been referred to as having prediabetes, indicating the relative high
risk for the future development of diabetes. They may be at higher risk for
cardiovascular events even in the absence of T2DM.
These patients are defined as having:
IFG (FPG 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL);
IGT (2-hour values on the 75 g OGTT of 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL);
Or HbA1c of 5.7% to 6.4%.
Testing for T2DM in asymptomatic patients
Although the effectiveness of early identification of prediabetes and diabetes
through mass testing of asymptomatic individuals has not been proven
definitively, prediabetes and diabetes meet established criteria for conditions
in which early detection is appropriate.
ADA recommends testing for diabetes in asymptomatic patients based on their
risks.13
Testing to detect T2DM in asymptomatic people is recommended in adults of
any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) and who have ≥1
risk factors for diabetes.
In those without risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.
HbA1c, FPG, or 2-hour 75 g OGTT are appropriate tests.
If tests are normal, repeat testing is recommended at least at 3-year intervals.

Diagnostic Testing
385

Routine laboratory testing of a patient with T2DM should include the following:
HbA1c, chemistry panel, fasting lipid profile, urine microalbumin (usually done
as microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio on a random spot urine sample), and liver
function panel.
HbA1c should be done at diagnosis and at least semiannually. If the HbA1c is
significantly above the target of 7% and therapy is being changed, it should
be checked every 1 to 3 months.
Liver function testing is required for monitoring of statin and
thiazolidinedione (TZD) therapies and should be considered for all patients
with insulin resistance due to the increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD).
Patients with T2DM and proteinuria or renal insufficiency require increased
surveillance of renal parameters.
A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG)

TREATMENT
T2DM is best managed with a multidisciplinary team, including doctors, diabetes
educators, pharmacists, dietitians, and support groups.13
Diabetes is a lifelong disease, and health care providers have almost no control
over the extent to which patients adhere to the day-to-day treatment regimen.
Therefore, it is critical for the health care professional to understand the context in
which patients are taking care of their disease, and carefully engage patients in the
therapeutic process. Any plan should recognize diabetes self-management
education (DSME) and on-going diabetes support as an integral component of
care.
Diabetes therapy should be individually designed to achieve glycemic, blood
pressure, lipid, and prevention targets while accommodating the patient’s age and
socioeconomic and cultural status and presence of complications of diabetes and
other medical conditions (see Chapter 27 for further details).

LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION
Lifestyle modification incorporating both MNT and physical activity is the firstline therapy for the prevention of diabetes and treatment of new-onset T2DM.
Weight loss has been shown to reduce insulin resistance. Moderate weight loss
(7% body weight) and regular physical activity (150 minutes/week) with
dietary strategies are effective in reducing the progression from prediabetes to
386

diabetes.4
Weight loss is recommended for all overweight or obese individuals who have
or are at risk for diabetes.14
Individuals who have prediabetes or diabetes should receive individualized
MNT as needed to achieve treatment goals.
Low-carbohydrate or low-fat calorie-restricted diets are effective for shortterm weight loss. Several randomized controlled trials suggested lowcarbohydrate diets (<130 g/day) achieved more weight loss than low-fat
diets and a greater decrease of Hb1Ac in T2DM patients.15
Monitoring carbohydrate intake remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic
control.
Structured exercise interventions have been shown to lower Hb1Ac in T2DM
patients.16 In the absence of contraindications, T2DM patients should be
encouraged to perform resistance training 3 times/week and at least 150
minute/week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (50% to 70% of
maximum heart rate).17
However, the UKPDS study showed that only 8% of patients treated with dietary
therapy alone were able to achieve and maintain glycemic control over a 9-year
period.18

Medications
Oral hypoglycemic agents (Tables 29-4 and 29-5)
Metformin
Metformin is the only biguanide available in the United States.19
It decreases hepatic glucose output and lowers fasting glycemia.
Metformin monotherapy decreases HbA1c by 1% to 2%.
Metformin is related to either weight stability or modest weight loss.
The most common adverse effect is gastrointestinal intolerance. Metformin
may interfere with Vitamin B12 absorption. Renal dysfunction is considered
a contraindication to metformin use.
Sulfonylureas
Sulfonylureas enhance insulin secretion.
They can lower HbA1c by 1% to 2%.
The major adverse effect is hypoglycemia, especially in the elderly. Weight
gain is common following sulfonylurea therapy.

Glinides are short-acting insulin secretagogues. They bind to a different site
within the sulfonylurea receptor. They have a shorter half-life than the
sulfonylureas and must be administered more frequently.
Glinides decrease HbA1c by 1% to 1.5%
They have similar adverse effects to sulfonylureas.
TZDs
TZDs are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g modulators.
They decrease the sensitivity of muscle, fat, and liver to insulin.
Monotherapy with TZDs has demonstrated a 0.8% to 1.8% decrease in
HbA1c.
The most common adverse effects are weight gain, fluid retention, and an
increased incidence of fractures in women.
Several meta-analyses have suggested a 30% to 40% relative increase in risk
for MI with rosiglitazone, which is no longer available for use. Pioglitazone
has been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.
α-Glucosidase inhibitors
α-Glucosidase inhibitors reduce the rate of digestion of polysaccharide in the
proximal small intestine, lowering postprandial glucose without causing
hypoglycemia.
They decrease HbA1c by 0.6% to 1.2%.
Increased gas production and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common
side effects.
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors)
DPP-4 inhibitors are small molecules inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down
endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) and glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Therefore, they enhance the effects of
GLP1 and GIP, increase glucose-mediated insulin secretion, and suppress
glucagon secretion and gastric emptying.
DPP-4 inhibitors lower Hb1Ac by 0.6% to 1.8% and are weight neutral.
The potential side effect is to interfere with immune function. Dosage needs
adjustment for impaired renal function except for linagliptin.

TABLE 29-5 ORAL COMBINATION PILLS

Colesevelam hydrochloride (WelChol)
WelChol is a resin originally developed for the treatment of high LDL. It also
lowers HbA1c in patients with T2DM by 0.4% to 0.6%.20
Bromocriptine mesylate (Cycloset)
Cycloset lowers HbA1c by 0.4% to 0.6%.
The major side effect is orthostatic hypotension and syncope.
Because the agents have different mechanisms of action, most have been tested
for use in combination with the other classes. Appropriate patient-specific
prescribing can often provide excellent glycemic control with low risk of
hypoglycemia, weight gain, and adverse effects.
390

Non-insulin injectable hypoglycemic agents
GLP-1 agonists
Exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon) and liraglutide (Victoza) are GLP-1
mimetics. They bind to the GLP-1 receptors on the pancreatic beta cells and
augment glucose-mediated insulin secretion. They also suppress glucagon
secretion and slow gastric motility.
GLP-1 agonists decrease HbA1c by 0.5% to 2%, mainly by lowering
postprandial glucose.
They have a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, but have an
ancillary benefit of contributing to weight loss while lowering blood
glucose.
Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients taking exenatide, although the
actual incidence is not known.
GLP-1 agonists are administered subcutaneously once or twice daily. A once
weekly formulation of exenatide is in phase 3 clinical development.
Pramlintide (Symlin)
Symlin is a synthetic analogue of the beta cell hormone amylin. It slows
stomach emptying, improves satiety, and inhibits glucose-dependent glucagon
production, which is reflected in reduced postprandial glucose and modest
weight loss.
Symlin decreases HbA1c by 0.5% to 0.7%.
The major side effects are gastrointestinal in nature.
It is given in doses of 30 to 120 mcg subcutaneously before each meal.
Symlin is approved for use in patients with T2DM who are also taking
insulin.
Insulin (see Chapter 28 for an overview of insulin types and pharmacokinetics.)
When adding insulin in the management of inadequately controlled T2DM,
generally the oral antidiabetic agents can be continued. (Table 29-6)
Initially, a basal insulin can be added at bedtime. The long-acting insulins
glargine (Lantus) and detemir (Levemir) have been shown to cause less
nighttime hypoglycemia when used with oral agents in an evening dosing
regimen.
If the response to one or more oral agents has been poor, or a contraindication
develops, a more complex insulin regimen might be required. Multiple daily
dosing regimens have been used to achieve tight glucose control and reduce the
risk of hypoglycemia by carefully adjusting the premeal doses according to
391

ambient BG, anticipated carbohydrate intake, and activity level.
Insulin requirements vary with changes in weight, diet, activity, concomitant
medication use, acute illnesses, and infections.
The regimen should be tailored to the patient’s needs and abilities.
Diabetes education is highly recommended when insulin is started or when the
regimen is changed.
Instruction in signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and in methods of
treatment is required.
Instruction in the use of glucagon should be provided to the patient’s
household members.
Concentrated insulin
U500 (500 U/mL) is available only as Humulin R, or regular.
It is an option for patients who require exceptionally large doses of insulin.
An endocrinology consultation should be sought if U500 insulin use is
contemplated.

Bariatric Surgery
Bariatric surgery that involves either gastric banding or bypassing sections of the
small intestine can be an effective weight loss treatment, particularly for severe
obesity.
Bariatric surgery has been shown to lead to near or complete normalization of
glycemia in 50% to 90% of T2DM patients.21
The mechanisms of glycemic improvement, long-term benefits and risks, and costeffectiveness of bariatric surgery in T2DM need further investigation.
Bariatric surgery should be considered for T2DM adults with BMI ≥35 kg/m2,
especially if their diseases are difficult to control with lifestyle and
medications.11
Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support general recommendation for
bariatric surgery in T2DM patients with BMI <35, however some patients may
benefit from the procedure.
Patients who have undergone bariatric surgery need lifelong lifestyle support and
medical monitoring.

Prevention of T2DM
Randomized controlled trials have shown that early interventions significantly
decrease the rate of onset of diabetes in high-risk individuals. The ADA
392

recommends prevention of T2DM.13
Prediabetic patients are recommended to have an effective ongoing support
program for weight loss of 5% to 10% of body weight and increase in physical
activity to at least 150 minute/week of moderate activity.
TABLE 29-6 INSULIN REGIMENS FOR DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2

In addition to lifestyle counseling, metformin can be considered in those who are
at very high risk for developing diabetes (combined IFG and IGT plus other risk
factors) and who are obese and <60 years of age.
Follow-up counseling and monitoring for development of diabetes should be
performed annually.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Nonketotic Hyperosmolar Coma
Nonketotic Hyperosmolar Coma (NKHC) evolves over a period of time but
presents emergently when neurologic deterioration occurs in the setting of high
glucose levels and dehydration.
Elderly or disabled patients with significant hyperglycemia who are unable to
compensate for the free water loss with oral intake are predisposed to develop
393

this syndrome.22
Patients with NKHC present with a plasma glucose that is generally >600 mg/dL,
normal or slightly elevated anion gap, increased BUN and creatinine, increased
serum osmolality, and a free water deficit of 2 to 6 L.
The initial goal of therapy is to replace volume and correct the free water deficit
with the infusion of appropriate intravenous fluids.
The nature of the fluids (isotonic vs. hypotonic) administered and the rate of
infusion are determined by the clinical circumstances.
As in DKA, patients in NKHC also present with total body K+ deficit.
Intravenous insulin should be given as repeated intravenous bolus doses (0.1
U/kg/1 to 2 hours) or via insulin drip (see Chapter 28 for further details).
The glucose may decline more rapidly in NKHC than in DKA. Electrolytes and
the clinical status of the patient should be checked closely and intravenous
fluids adjusted accordingly.
Neurologic changes should be evaluated to rule out stroke or other central
nervous system (CNS) conditions.
Mortality is high in patients who present with NKHC due to age and underlying
conditions.

Inpatient Management of Diabetes
David A. Rometo and Garry Tobin
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hyperglycemia is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients, including those
with previously diagnosed diabetes, those diagnosed with diabetes during the
admission, and those with acute illness, stress, or intervention-induced
hyperglycemia.
Hypoglycemia is less common, and is most often caused by therapy to treat or
prevent hyperglycemia.
Guidelines defining appropriate glucose targets and how to achieve them in
hospitalized patients have been published by several organizations. They are
specific to either a critically ill or non-critically ill patient population (Table 301).1
The use of insulin to treat hyperglycemia is almost universally favored over oral
hypoglycemic therapy in the hospital setting.
Diabetes care is more complex than ordering the correct dose of medication.
Coordination of care between physicians, nurses, nurse assistants, dietary staff,
diabetes educators, and social workers is important to allow for appropriate
timing of glucose measurement, insulin administration, meal/nutrition delivery,
treatment of hypoglycemia, patient self-management education, and discharge
planning.

Epidemiology
It is estimated that 22% of all inpatient (IP) hospital days are incurred by patients
with diabetes.1
Hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL) is found on 46% of all blood glucose (BG) readings
in intensive care units (ICUs), and 31.7% of all non-ICU readings (from a 2007
survey of over 12 million point-of-care (POC) glucose readings from 126 US
hospitals).2

Outcomes
397

BG <60 or >110 mg/dL are associated with higher inpatient mortality.3
Non-critically ill patients with previously diagnosed diabetes who are
hyperglycemic while hospitalized have increased in-hospital mortality compared
to euglycemic patients. Those without a prior diagnosis of diabetes but with new
hyperglycemia while hospitalized have an even greater increase in mortality
compared to euglycemic patients. Critically ill patients with newly diagnosed
hyperglycemia also have higher inpatient mortality rates than patients with known
diabetes or with euglycemia.4
Patients who are hyperglycemic at admission and are placed on TPN have
increased mortality compared to those on TPN who were euglycemic at
admission.5
Patients who have had an episode of hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) in the hospital
have increased in-hospital mortality, longer hospital stays, increased hospital
charges, and increased rates of discharge to skilled nursing facilities.6
TABLE 30-1 RECOMMENDED GLUCOSE TARGETS FOR INPATIENTS

Intensive insulin therapy administered by a variable dose IV infusion improves
many clinical outcomes in ICU settings, including reductions in wound infections
and in organ failure after cardiothoracic surgery. However, the risk of
hypoglycemia is increased and may contribute to increased mortality in medical
ICU settings.1
Only small-scale clinical trials of insulin therapy in non-critically ill inpatients
have been conducted.

DIAGNOSIS
For diagnostic criteria for diabetes, see Chapter 29.

Acute or Chronic Hyperglycemia?
Inpatient hyperglycemia can be defined as any blood glucose value >140
mg/dL.
398

Checking a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) can distinguish acute hyperglycemia from
undiagnosed diabetes, the latter likely having an HbA1c > 6.5%.1 Hemoglobin
A1c values are affected by hemoglobinopathies, acute blood loss, and blood
transfusion. These issues must be taken into consideration when ordering a HbA1c
in the hospital.

Glucose Monitoring
“Fingerstick” or capillary BG testing using point-of-care (POC) glucose meters is
an integral part of diabetes management in hospitalized patients. The timing of
glucose checks should be adjusted to the patient’s clinical condition. Glucose
testing is performed hourly in patients receiving insulin by IV infusion, every 4 to
6 hours in patients who are NPO, or who are receiving enteral nutrition or TPN.
Monitoring of blood glucose should be performed 30 to 60 minutes before meals
in patients who are eating meals so that prandial and correction factor insulin can
be administered before the meal. In general, inpatients receiving insulin should
have their blood glucose checked ≥4X daily.
Attention should be paid to the limitations of the glucose analyzer and the source of
the specimen. Measurement of glucose with standardized lab measurements,
including blood gas analyzers and the clinical chemistry laboratory, are more
accurate than POC technology.
The source of the patient’s sample (arterial, capillary, central venous), the
patient’s clinical conditions (anemia, hypoxia, poor peripheral perfusion) and
current medications (acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, IVIG, peritoneal dialysis) can
all affect the POC glucose results.
Anemia (Hct <34%) has been shown to cause significant error, overestimating
glucose with POC glucose meters. Dosing insulin based on falsely elevated
glucose values may contribute to hypoglycemia in intensively treated patients in
ICU settings. The use of formulas to correct BG for the level of anemia has been
shown to reduce hypoglycemic events in ICU patients.7
Meters using glucose dehydrogenase enzymatic strips are affected by maltose in
IVIG and Icodextrin peritoneal dialysis solution, and therefore should be used
with caution in healthcare facilities.7
In the absence of an interfering substance, the current FDA standard for POC
glucose meters is +/– 20% accuracy above 75 mg/dL, and +/– 15% for <75
mg/dL, 95% of the time. This standard may be lowered to +/– 10% in the future.
Arterial blood measured by POC glucose meters is more accurate than capillary
glucose, and should be used when available in ICU patients on IV insulin.8

399

MANAGEMENT OF THE NON-CRITICALLY ILL
Assessment
A history of diabetes should include the age of onset, duration, type of diabetes,
and history of DKA or other diabetes-related hospitalizations.
Ability to monitor blood glucose at home, frequency of home monitoring and
availability of supplies is an important part of the history that will be useful for
discharge planning.
The home anti-diabetes medications, including insulin doses and regimen, should
be documented in detail. “Sliding scale” does not describe a specific regimen,
and provides insufficient information. When the patient adjusts their insulin dose
at home, recording either the adjustment scale (e.g., 1 unit/10 g of carbohydrate
plus correction of 1 unit/30 mg/dL over 150 mg/dL) or typical doses (e.g., 5 to 10
units before meals) is necessary to discern insulin needs in the hospital.
Calculation of the typical total daily dose (TDD) taken at home is very helpful for
medication reconciliation.
Appropriateness of the home regimen can be assessed by obtaining a history of
prior HbA1c values, frequency of hypoglycemia, injection site problems, and
reported adherence to the regimen.
Risk factors for inpatient hypoglycemia include low weight, advanced age,
chronic kidney disease or renal impairment, liver dysfunction, autonomic
instability, hypoglycemia unawareness, and malnutrition.
Ongoing assessment of nutritional intake, including dextrose containing IV fluids,
is necessary when prescribing insulin or other anti-diabetes therapies.
Note corticosteroid use as this will affect the planned dosage regimen.

Oral Hypoglycemics
Oral and non-insulin injectable hypoglycemic agents are generally
discontinued in the hospital setting, although selected anti-diabetic agents may
be used in inpatients with stable kidney function and nutritional intake.
Sulfonylureas may contribute to hypoglycemia, particularly during periods of poor
intake or NPO status.
Metformin is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment, and in situations of
possible fluctuation in kidney function, such as during IV contrast studies or
surgery.
Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitors may be options for those with mild
hyperglycemia (see Chapter 29).
400

Other agents such as thiazolidinediones and GLP analogs have contraindications
that may apply to hospitalized patients.1

Insulin Therapy
Insulin is the most accepted anti-hyperglycemic medication in the IP setting since it
can be used in patients with varying severities of illness and titrated to the
individual patient needs. The major adverse effects of insulin relate to the
difficulty with individualized dosing, causing some patients to have persistent
hyperglycemia and/or episodes of hypoglycemia.
Target glucose levels set by the ADA/AACE guidelines are based on clinical
experience and judgment, as no large clinical trial has been conducted to
determine the best target range in non-critically ill patients. These guidelines
recommend a fasting blood glucose <140 mg/dL, and random BG <180 mg/dL.1
Glucose levels <100 mg/dL should prompt reconsideration of insulin doses, and
levels below 70 necessitate a dose change (unless the event is easily explained by
another factor).1
DKA and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic coma are considered “never
events” by CMS and may result in loss of Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement for
the hospitalization if the cause is due to inappropriate treatment of patients with
diabetes while hospitalized. Discontinuation of insulin or providing inadequate
doses of insulin can result in these events during hospitalization.
Patients Taking Oral Nutrition
For patients eating meals, a subcutaneous basal-bolus regimen consisting of
basal, prandial, and correction doses of insulin is recommended. AACE/ADA
guidelines recommend the use of insulin analogs in the hospital setting. Basal
insulin is provided by NPH, glargine or detemir in single or divided daily doses.
Use of a rapid acting analogue (aspart, lispro, glulisine) is recommended for
prandial and correction doses of insulin. Correction doses, previously known as
“sliding scale”, are added to the prandial insulin to correct glucose values above
a specified target.
The efficacy and safety of a basal-bolus regimen was tested against “sliding scale”
regular insulin alone in a RCT trial of non-critically ill insulin-naïve patients with
type 2 diabetes on medicine wards in the RABBIT 2 trial. Patients were placed
on a basal-bolus regimen based on weight and level of hyperglycemia, and the
dose was titrated based on a treatment algorithm. More patients on basal-bolus
therapy reached target BG <140 than the sliding scale group, and there was no
difference in hypoglycemia.9
401

The starting doses for an inpatient basal-bolus regimen could be determined by
either 1) a logical adjustment of home insulin therapy, based on the medication
history and patient’s condition, or 2) the “start from scratch” approach, often a
weight-based method of dosing, taking additional patient-specific risk factors into
consideration.
Table 30-2 shows a basal-bolus insulin dosing algorithm. Determination of the
TDD of insulin needed by the patient is the first step in planning an insulin
regimen.
Some hospitals offer a “diabetic,” “carb-consistent,” or “carb-restricted” diets.
The dose of prandial insulin may need to be reduced if the diet contains <60 g of
carbohydrate per meal (check with dietary services about the carbohydrate
content of regularly ordered diets).
TABLE 30-2 SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN DOSING ALGORITHM

402

The choice of correction dose scale is determined by the patient’s sensitivity to
insulin. This can be inferred by their TDD of insulin. Those using >100 units/day
would require the “insulin resistant” scale, while those using <50 units/day would
apply the “insulin sensitive” scale on this algorithm.
Mixed insulins (such as NPH 70/regular 30 and analog mixes) increase the risk of
hypoglycemia in the hospital. Mixed insulin regimens should be converted to
basal-bolus regimens during the IP stay.
NPO
403

In general, basal insulin doses should be continued during short periods of
NPO status, such as for tests. The prandial insulin should be held and sliding
scale doses reconsidered, possibly only administered if the BG is >200 mg/dL.
During prolonged periods of NPO status, low-dose dextrose may be required
in addition to basal insulin or an insulin drip for insulin-deficient patients to
avoid the development of ketones or iatrogenic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
The following scenario is a relatively common occurrence and can be prevented:
hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL) is discovered prior to the scheduled basal insulin
dose in a patient with T1DM and the dose is held. Twelve to 16 hours later
(longer if the patient is receiving correction doses), the patient is found to have
DKA. Adjustment of the basal insulin dose is the recommended approach
depending on the proximal cause of the hypoglycemia. The risk for DKA is much
less in type 2 diabetes (T2DM), but inappropriate holding of a basal insulin dose
will likely result in poor glycemic control for the following day.
Blood glucose should be monitored every 4 to 6 hours while NPO on insulin.
Enteral Tube Feeding
When possible, tube feedings in hyperglycemic IP should be continuous for 24
hours. This may help simplify the dosing schedule of insulin and prevent errors
and hypoglycemia.
Products containing a lower concentration of simple carbohydrate may be
appropriate choices for persons with hyperglycemia.
A recent RCT in 50 hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia on tube feeds
showed basal glargine with correction dose regular insulin was equivalent to
regular sliding scale with NPH added only for persistent hyperglycemia.
However, 48% of the patients in the sliding-scale group needed added NPH.
These patients had higher glucose at randomization and tended to have diabetes
prior to admission.10
Basal insulin can be provided as glargine or detemir given once or twice daily, or
human NPH in divided doses every 6, 8, or 12 hours. Dividing the basal insulin
into 2 to 4 doses offers opportunities for dose adjustment if there are problems
with the tube feeds.
Orders should include instructions for starting dextrose containing IV fluids if
insulin has been administered and the tube feed is interrupted.
Bolus tube feeds are handled similar to the patient taking PO with regularly
scheduled doses of short-acting insulin based on the carbohydrate content of the
feeding.
404

Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)
Intravenous nutrition containing a mix of macro- and micronutrients has a profound
effect on glucose and insulin requirements. Failure to control blood glucose in
patients receiving TPN has been associated with poor patient outcomes.
To determine a starting dose of insulin, the total daily carbohydrate intake should
be calculated, and the initial insulin dose is based on this value. A common
starting ratio is 1 unit: 10 g carbohydrate.
Insulin can be mixed in the TPN infusate. This ensures that when the TPN stops,
the insulin also stops, reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. Small doses of basal
insulin should be given subcutaneously in patients with T1DM to reduce the risk
of DKA during periods between TPN infusions.

Special Circumstances
Corticosteroids
The use of oral, IV, and IM corticosteroids can cause or exacerbate
hyperglycemia. The effect is most pronounced in the postprandial state.
Hyperglycemia secondary to once-daily prednisone can be managed with a dose of
NPH at the time of the steroid administration, or with higher meal doses of rapid
acting insulin. Multiple daily doses of dexamethasone or methylprednisolone can
be offset by giving NPH at the time of each dose.
If the patient has persistent hyperglycemia despite attempts at insulin dose
adjustment, consider IV insulin with titration protocol to achieve glucose targets
and to determine daily insulin requirements.11
The insulin dose should be proactively, preemptively increased when high-dose
corticosteroids are planned. While the exact dose adjustment is not known, it is
often necessary to increase doses dramatically.
Insulin Pump Therapy
For patients who are using an insulin pump prior to admission, inpatient diabetes
management can sometimes be achieved with pump continuation and diabetes
self-management. This requires that the hospital have strict policies and
procedures in place, as there are issues of medical/legal liability for selfadministered medications in the hospital. A patient must show the physical and
mental capacity for self-management with the pump, and staff must document the
timing and amount of insulin administered in the medical record.1
Obtaining an endocrinology consultation or assessment by a certified diabetes
educator (CDE) to evaluate the appropriateness of the insulin pump regimen, and
405

to make setting adjustments when hyper- and hypoglycemia, are encountered is
recommended.
Hospitals without policies and procedures in place or experienced staff to ensure
safe insulin pump use should disallow pump use and convert patients to an
appropriate basal/bolus subcutaneous regimen.
The use of an insulin pump can increase the risk of DKA due to tube or catheter
occlusion or insufficient insulin in the reservoir.
U-500 Insulin
U-500 insulin is concentrated 5 times compared to the standard U 100 insulin.
One mL of U-500 contains 500 units of regular insulin, compared to 100 units of
U-100 insulin.
The use of U-500 insulin requires special care and is generally discouraged in
the hospital setting.
Patients with severe insulin resistance, often needing more than 200 units/day of
U-100 insulin, may use U-500 at home prior to admission. It is generally
prescribed as TID before meals or QID with a bedtime dose.
Studies have been done regarding its use in the hospital setting. If it is available in
the hospital pharmacy, precautions must be made to prevent dosing or medication
substitution errors.
When possible, the U-500 home dose should be converted to a basal/bolus
regimen using U-100 insulin in the hospital.
If U-500 insulin is needed for control of hyperglycemia, the doses should be
written in volume (e.g., 0.1 cc instead of 10 units) to prevent errors. Having the
dose predrawn in pharmacy might be necessary to avoid having the concentrated
insulin on the floor.
A predetermined lower dose should be given for any missed meal to ensure basal
coverage, and to decrease hypoglycemic events while NPO.

MANAGEMENT OF HYPERGLYCEMIA IN THE CRITICALLY
ILL
Hyperglycemia is a common finding in patients in the ICU, occurring in both
diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Numerous observational studies have shown
that hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in
patients in ICUs, including postoperative cardiac and general surgery patients,
patients with acute myocardial infarction and stroke, and general medicine
patients.
406

Historically, a few single-center randomized trials had shown that treating
hyperglycemia in critically ill patients could reduce morbidity and mortality.
More recent multicenter trials have demonstrated that hypoglycemia and intensive
glycemic control were associated with adverse outcomes, including increased
hospital mortality.

Clinical Trials
Van den Berghe et al. 2001. This randomized trial in a single surgical ICU
showed that mortality was reduced in hyperglycemic patients assigned to
intensive insulin treatment (goal glucose 80 to 110 mg/dL) compared with
standard care (IV insulin to goal glucose 180 to 200 mg/dL).12
Van den Berghe et al. 2006. This trial applied the intensive intervention of the
earlier study to patients in a medical ICU, and showed significantly reduced
morbidity, but not in-hospital mortality, in patients assigned to the intensive
treatment arm. Those staying in the ICU <3 days had increased mortality, while
those staying ≥3 days had decreased mortality, but this was statistically
insignificant. There were more hypoglycemic events in the intensive therapy
group, but no associated hemodynamic instability or seizures.13
NICE-SUGAR 2009. Compared to the single-center Van den Berghe studies, this
multinational study compared critically ill medical and surgical patients expected
to remain in the ICU >3 days randomized to intensive glucose control (81 to 108
mg/dL) versus conventional glucose control (180 mg/dL or less). NICE-SUGAR
demonstrated that intensive treatment increased the incidence of hypoglycemia
(6.8 vs. 0.5%) and 90-day mortality (27.5 vs. 24.9%). Trauma patients and those
on corticosteroids did show mortality benefit with intensive control, but did not
reach statistical significance.14
There were numerous methodologic differences in the studies mentioned above,
including methods of measuring blood glucose and the nutritional support of the
different patient populations.1

Therapy
Target Glucose
ADA/AACE guidelines have set a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL for critically ill
patients, with recommendations to start IV insulin therapy when the BG goes above
180 mg/dL. Greater benefit may be realized at the lower end of this range, and some
patients may benefit from a lower target range. However, a target range below 110
mg/dL is not recommended (Table 30-1).1
407

Medications
In critically ill patients admitted to the ICU, oral hypoglycemic agents and
subcutaneous insulin should be stopped. Insulin in critically ill patients should be
given intravenously.
Most ICUs now have standardized glucose algorithms, generally managed by ICU
nurses, which have been shown to be valid ways to manage glucose. The most
effective glucose algorithms are dynamic and incorporate the rate of glucose
change into the insulin dose adjustments (Table 30-3).15
Insulin Adjustments
Changes in the insulin-infusion rate are predicated on the current blood glucose,
rate of change from past measurements, changes in the clinical condition, and
changes in carbohydrate intake.
For example, a change in the 5% dextrose infusion rate from 150 mL/hour (180 g
carbohydrates normalized during a 24-hour period) to 75 mL/hour (90 g
carbohydrates normalized during a 24-hour period) will require a decrease in the
insulin infusion rate in order to prevent hypoglycemia. In critically ill patients,
multiple sources of carbohydrate need to be taken into consideration when
calculating the insulin dose, such as parenteral nutrition, enteral tube feeds, and
dextrose-containing IV fluids.
Nutrition, whether enteral or parenteral, should be given as a continuous infusion
rather than intermittent boluses to prevent significant fluctuations in blood
glucose. It is often critical to reassess caloric intake every 12 to 24 hours.
The patients most at risk for hypoglycemia are those with kidney or liver
failure. Close attention to details and a less aggressive upward titration in
patients with liver and renal failure allow insulin drips to be used safely.
ICU patients in general are not able to perceive, much less respond, to low glucose
levels. Thus, avoidance of hypoglycemia is entirely the responsibility of the
physicians and staff managing the insulin and nutrition orders.
Transition from IV to Subcutaneous Insulin
At the time of transfer from the ICU, intravenous insulin doses need to be
converted to a subcutaneous insulin regimen. Using an insulin sliding scale alone
results in rebound hyperglycemia, and could risk the development of severe
hyperglycemia.16
Subcutaneous insulin should overlap with IV insulin to prevent hyperglycemia
after discontinuation of an insulin drip. The first dose of long-acting insulin should
be given 2 to 3 hours prior to the end of the IV drip.17
408

For patients with diabetes, the subcutaneous insulin regimen doses can be
estimated from a TDD that is 75% to 80% of the total insulin received via IV in
the prior 24 hours.1
When non-diabetic patients with stress hyperglycemia are transitioned to
subcutaneous insulin, using 60% to 70% of the daily IV dose is an appropriate
starting place. The daily insulin requirement may fall as patients recover from
stress due to illness or surgery. For example, in patients who are recovering from
cardiothoracic surgery, the subcutaneous insulin dose may need to be tapered
rapidly, with daily changes in the subcutaneous TDD until a stable regimen is
established.
TABLE 30-3 IV INSULIN INFUSION PRINCIPLES

409

DISCHARGE
Patients with prior or newly diagnosed diabetes (or missed diagnosis) who have
hyperglycemia during admission have higher rates of re-hospitalization than
euglycemic patients.18
Discharge planning should include instruction in basic diabetes management skills,
410

such as glucose monitoring and insulin injections, as appropriate.
Follow-up with a healthcare provider skilled in diabetes management will help
with adherence and prevent readmissions for diabetes-related problems.

Select Discharge Regimen
The AACE bases its 2010 discharge recommendations for those with prior
diabetes on the level of glucose control or severity of disease prior to admission.
Those at goal (A1C < 7) should return to previous therapy, while those not at goal
should intensify therapy, including continuing basal-bolus therapy at hospital
doses for an A1C > 9%. Adjustments to this regimen should be made based on
glycemic control in the hospital and risk of hypoglycemia.
Though not recommended for inpatient use, mixed insulin can be beneficial for
convenience, improving adherence, and reducing errors (compared to the complex
basal-bolus regimen) for patients who require insulin at discharge. Lingvay et al.
showed that 0.2 U/kg/day of a rapid-acting analog 70/30 mix, divided into BID
equal doses administered via pen, in addition to metformin, was effective and safe
in treatment-naïve persons with newly diagnosed diabetes. The average HbA1C
declined from 10.8% to 5.9% in 3 months, and the hypoglycemia rate over 3 years
was 0.51 mild events/person-month.19
Treatment of diabetes diagnosed during the hospitalization (with elevated A1C
proving preadmission hyperglycemia) should follow outpatient guidelines (see
Chapter 27).
For those requiring insulin for corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia, a plan to
taper the insulin dose during steroid taper should be included in the discharge
plan.

Education and Supplies
All patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, those with uncontrolled diabetes prior
to admission, and those who will require hypoglycemic therapy after discharge
would benefit from diabetes education from a CDE during the hospital stay. Early
consultation of these services will allow for repeat visits and assessment of
retention. Education should include:
Assessment of level of understanding related to the diagnosis of diabetes
Self-monitoring of BG and explanation of home BG goals
Definition, recognition, treatment, and prevention of hyper- and hypoglycemia.
Information on consistent eating patterns
Insulin administration (if appropriate)
411

Sick day management
It is also important to ensure that the patient will have all the needed equipment
and supplies at home, and be able to afford and obtain them. Supplies may include
glucose meter, test strips, lancets, needles, syringes, urine ketone strips, and a
Glucagon kit.1

Follow-up Care
Short-term follow up with a healthcare provided skilled in diabetes management
should be scheduled for patients with new or changed diabetes treatment
regimens.
The discharge summary should include the extent of inpatient hyperglycemia, the
A1C on admission, and any medication changes made, and should be
communicated in a timely manner to the out-patient provider.
Patients may also need a phone contact for problems with hyperglycemia or
hypoglycemia that develop after discharge.

Hypoglycemia
Nadia Khoury and Philip E. Cryer
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Glucose is the principle metabolic fuel for the brain under physiologic conditions.
This makes it essential for the body to protect itself against hypoglycemia and for
plasma glucose to be maintained in a narrow range.
This regulation occurs in the postprandial state due to increased insulin secretion
from the beta cell and increased glucose use and energy storage by target tissues.
In the postabsorptive (fasting) state, plasma glucose is maintained between
approximately 70 and 100 mg/dL. It can fall further without causing symptoms in
some individuals, especially young women.
The body has multiple counter-regulatory mechanisms to prevent or correct
hypoglycemia.1 These include, in order of occurrence, decreased insulin secretion
followed by increased secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon and
epinephrine) that amplify release of glucose from liver stores (glycogenolysis),
increase glucose production and release by the liver (gluconeogenesis), and
further reduce glucose use by tissues. All of these mechanisms serve to raise
plasma glucose levels. Later, other counter-regulatory hormones (cortisol and
growth hormone) assist in defending against hypoglycemia.

Definition
Hypoglycemia is a plasma glucose concentration low enough to cause signs or
symptoms. Due to shifting thresholds of symptoms with recurrent hypoglycemia
(hypoglycemic symptoms occur at lower BG) or poorly controlled diabetes
(hypoglycemic symptoms occur at higher BG), it is not possible to identify a
single plasma glucose value that defines hypoglycemia.
Hypoglycemia is most convincingly documented by Whipple’s triad of signs or
symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, a low measured plasma glucose
concentration, and relief of symptoms or signs on raising the glucose levels.
Documentation of Whipple’s triad is especially important in the non-diabetic
patient because hypoglycemia is rare in this population.
414

Documentation of low blood glucose in the setting of symptoms in a diabetic
patient using insulin or insulin secretagogue therapy is preferable but less
critical because hypoglycemia is common.

Pathophysiology
Hypoglycemia occurs, in general, when disappearance of glucose from the
circulation is greater than the appearance of glucose in the circulation.
Sources of circulating glucose include exogenous glucose from ingested
carbohydrates and endogenous processes such as hepatic gluconeogenesis and
glycogenolysis and renal gluconeogenesis.

DIAGNOSIS
Traditional classification schemes have placed hypoglycemia occurring in nondiabetic individuals into categories of fasting or postprandial (after meals).
Alternatively, classification of hypoglycemia may be based on patient
characteristics: That occurring in those who are ill or on medication or those who
are seemingly well.2
Reactive hypoglycemia is a term no longer in use that described a functional
disorder with postprandial hypoglycemia symptoms without demonstration of
Whipple’s triad.

Clinical Presentation
Symptoms of hypoglycemia can be classified as neurogenic symptoms that result
from activation of the sympathetic nervous system, and neuroglycopenic
symptoms that result from inadequate delivery of glucose to the brain (Table 311).3
Neurogenic and neuroglycopenic symptoms normally begin to occur at a glucose
level of approximately 50 to 55 mg/dL. Lower glucose levels may be associated
with cognitive and behavioral changes and may produce coma, convulsions, and
even death.
History
A detailed history is essential and should include the following: The circumstances
of the episode and its temporal relationship to meals or exercise, associated
symptoms, weight changes, recurrence of the episode, drug/alcohol history,
medication history, history of gastric surgery, personal or family history of diabetes
or of multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1) or MEN-associated conditions,
415

comorbid conditions, and symptoms of other hormone deficiencies.
Physical Examination
Acutely, hypoglycemia can present with changes in mental status and even focal
neurologic findings that are usually transient.
Chronic or recurrent hypoglycemia may have no obvious physical signs, but may
result in weight gain or subtle neurologic deficits.
There are no specific physical findings associated with insulinoma. A complete
physical examination may reveal other causes of hypoglycemia, including signs of
chronic alcohol use, other hormone deficiencies, or MEN1.

Diagnostic Criteria
Confirmation of low blood glucose by a reliable laboratory method rather than with
self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is essential in the work-up of
hypoglycemia in the non-diabetic. If the patient’s apparent hypoglycemia was
asymptomatic, it is important to consider artifacts caused by improper collection,
storage, or error in analytic methods. Measured plasma glucose can drop 10 to 20
mg/dL/hour after the blood sample is drawn, so it is important for samples to be
processed quickly. In addition, large numbers of blood cells, as in patients with
leukemia, can consume plasma glucose, thereby artifactually lowering the measured
value, even in the presence of glycolytic inhibitors.4
TABLE 31-1 SYMPTOMS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA

TABLE 31-2 CAUSES OF HYPOGLYCEMIA IN ADULTS

416

Differential Diagnosis
In the ill or medicated person without diabetes, there are four main causes of
hypoglycemia (see Table 31-2):
Drugs are the most common cause of hypoglycemia.5 Insulin, sulfonylureas, and
alcohol account for the majority of cases. Although hypoglycemic agents used
in the treatment of diabetes are the drugs most often implicated in iatrogenic
hypoglycemia, it is important to remember that many other medications—some
of which are commonly used—can also lower blood sugar. Included in this list
are salicylates, quinine, quinolone antibiotics (especially gatifloxacin),
haloperidol, disopyramide, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, bblockers, pentamidine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and propoxyphene.
Ingestion of alcohol during prolonged fasting (i.e., an alcohol binge) may lead
to hypoglycemia by inhibition of gluconeogenesis.
In critical illness, such as end-stage liver disease, renal failure, starvation, and
sepsis, glucose utilization may exceed production, thereby causing
417

hypoglycemia.
Counter-regulatory hormone deficiencies (adrenal insufficiency, growth
hormone deficiency) rarely cause hypoglycemia.
Non-islet cell tumors can cause hypoglycemia, albeit rarely. Malignancies such
as lymphoma, hepatoma, some sarcomas, and teratomas can cause
hypoglycemia by secretion of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), which can
increase glucose use and suppress production.6
In the seemingly well individual, hypoglycemia generally results from one of two
causes:
Hypoglycemia can be accidental, malicious, or surreptitious.
Factitious hypoglycemia should be considered in any patient with a history of
psychiatric illness, or access to insulin or oral hypoglycemia agents (e.g.,
health care workers, friends and relatives of people with diabetes).7
Endogenous hyperinsulinism may be due to the following:
Insulinoma is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by excessive
insulin secretion by a pancreatic beta-cell tumor, leading to primarily fasting
but occasionally postprandial hypoglycemia. The incidence of insulinoma is
one to two cases per million patient-years. The median age at presentation is 47
with a slight female predominance. Malignant insulinoma, which occurs in 10%
of all such tumors, is more common in older patients.8 In younger patients,
insulinoma is more frequently associated with MEN1. Insulinomas associated
with MEN may be multifocal or malignant and may secrete other hormones such
as gastrin or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
Noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS) leads to
neuroglycopenic spells typically after a meal. It occurs predominately in men
and is due to diffuse islet hypertrophy and sometimes, hyperplasia.9
Some patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery develop postprandial
endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia through a yet unknown
mechanism.10
Rarely, the presence of autoantibodies against insulin can cause a picture of
predominantly reactive hypoglycemia, or antibodies against the insulin receptor
can present as fasting hypoglycemia.

Diagnostic Testing
Evaluation of hypoglycemia involves demonstration of Whipple’s triad with
simultaneous laboratory evaluation. When Whipple’s triad has not been documented
or laboratory evaluation has not been done during symptomatic hypoglycemia, it is
418

necessary to recreate the circumstances in which symptoms occur either through a
monitored 72-hour fast for a history of fasting hypoglycemia or a mixed meal
challenge for a history of postprandial hypoglycemia.
Laboratory Evaluation
Laboratory evaluation should start with confirmation that hypoglycemia has
occurred and there is a risk of recurrence. The focus should then be placed on
documentation of insulin and C-peptide levels during an episode of
symptomatic hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <54 mg/dL).
If the C-peptide is low in the presence of high measured insulin, exogenous insulin
is the probable etiology. With high insulin and high C-peptide, screening for
sulfonylurea, and non-sulfonylurea (repaglinide and nateglinide) secretagogues
should be performed to rule out surreptitious or inadvertent drug use. Insulin
antibodies should also be considered and ordered early in the course of the workup when there is a suspicion of exogenous insulin administration.
During a 72-hour fast, the fast is ended once symptomatic hypoglycemia is
documented and appropriate samples are collected. Diagnostic values include the
following:
glucose <54 mg/dL,
insulin ≥3 μU/mL,
C-peptide ≥0.2 nmol/L,
proinsulin ≥5.0 pmol/L,
β-hydroxybutyrate ≤2.7 mmol/L, and
negative screen for insulin secretagogues.
If Whipple’s triad has been previously documented, the diagnostic fast can be
concluded with these measurements at an asymptomatic plasma glucose of
<54 mg/dL.
If Whipple’s triad has not been previously documented, the fast should be
continued until symptoms occur even if this means a lower blood sugar. Once
symptomatic, the patient can be treated with 1 mg intravenous glucagon. An
increase in glucose of >25 mg/dL over 30 minutes is consistent with the
diagnosis of endogenous hyperinsulinemia.2
For postprandial hypoglycemia, a mixed meal challenge including foods
recognized by the patient to cause hypoglycemia should be performed over 5
hours. An oral glucose tolerance test should never be used to diagnosis
postprandial hypoglycemia. The same laboratories that are obtained in a fasting
challenge are obtained in the mixed meal challenge.
419

Imaging and Diagnostic Procedures
Once a diagnosis of endogenous hyperinsulinemia is made clinically and
biochemically, insulinoma localization is usually performed first by dual-phase
thin-section multidetector computed tomography (CT). Alternative imaging
procedures include MRI or transabdominal ultrasonography. These methods
detect 75% of insulinomas.1
Endoscopic ultrasound with the possibility of fine needle aspiration allows
preoperative localization of the vast majority of insulinomas.11

TREATMENT
Immediate treatment of hypoglycemia is necessary to prevent further decline in
blood glucose, neuroglycopenia, and its associated adverse outcomes.
To prevent recurrent hypoglycemia, identification and correction of the underlying
mechanism are necessary. For insulinoma, surgical resection is preferred.

Medications
Immediate treatment of severe hypoglycemia includes oral or intravenous
dextrose [initial bolus of 1 ampule D50 (25 g) followed by infusion of glucose to
maintain blood glucose >100 mg/dL] or 1 mg intramuscular or subcutaneous
glucagon.
Conscious patients may be given readily absorbable carbohydrates orally in the
form of fruit juices or glucose tablets.
Medical therapy with diazoxide (notable side effects include edema and
hirsutism), verapamil, or octreotide is reserved for patients with endogenous
hyperinsulinism who are not surgical candidates, who have recurrent disease and
refuse reoperation, or who have inoperable disease.
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, diazoxide, and octreotide may be helpful in NIPHS
or postgastric bypass hypoglycemia.
Oral formulations of inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), such as
everolimus, have recently been used with some success for refractory
hypoglycemia in malignant insulinoma.12 Studies have shown improvement in
glucose levels with and without tumor regression.

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
If surgical or medical treatments fail, frequent daytime feedings and provision of
large amounts of uncooked cornstarch at bedtime or even overnight gastric
420

glucose infusion may be necessary.
Patients should be educated about the symptoms of hypoglycemia and the
appropriate corrective measures (including when to seek medical attention), and
diabetic patients should be provided with a medical alert bracelet and a glucagon
emergency kit.

Surgery
The treatment of choice for insulinoma is surgical resection, usually via a
laparoscpic procedure. For solitary adenomas, surgery is curative.
Multiple insulinomas associated with MEN1 are treated with an 80% subtotal
pancreatectomy, although the recurrence rate is still 21% at 20 years.
Partial pancreatectomy in NIPHS and postbariatric surgery hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia is sometimes curative.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Drug treatment of diabetes is, by far, the most common cause of hypoglycemia.
Iatrogenic hypoglycemia from insulin and insulin secretagogues limits the
glycemic management of diabetes.
Recurrent morbidity and sometimes mortality can result from insulin or insulin
secretagogue-induced hypoglycemia, and the risk or occurrence of hypoglycemia
can abrogate the full realization of the vascular benefits of glycemic control.
Persons with type 1 diabetes experience innumerable episodes of hypoglycemia
each year and most experience at least one severe episode each year.
Hypoglycemia is less common in type 2 diabetes but carries a bigger burden of
morbidity and mortality due to the 20-fold greater prevalence of the disease.1
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that people with diabetes
become concerned about developing hypoglycemia at blood glucose <70 mg/dL
(3.9 mmol/L). At this level, patients should consider actions including repeat
measurement, carbohydrate ingestion, and avoiding exercise or driving until the
glucose level is raised.
In both type 1 and long-term type 2 diabetes, glucose counter-regulatory
mechanisms may be reduced or lost. When hypoglycemia is caused by exogenous
insulin or insulin secretagogue, reduction in ambient insulin level is not possible.
Both glucagon secretion and epinephrine responses may be attenuated. This
cluster of abnormal responses leads to the clinical syndromes of defective
glucose counterregulation
and hypoglycemia unawareness which are
associated with 25-fold or greater and six-fold or greater risks of severe
421

hypoglycemia respectively.
In addition, repeated hypoglycemia shifts glycemic thresholds for epinephrine
secretion and awareness of hypoglycemia. This phenomenon is known as
hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) and is a common
complication of tight glycemic control in people with diabetes.13 In most cases,
avoidance of hypoglycemia for 2 to 3 weeks can restore awareness.14

Obesity
David A. Rometo, Dominic N. Reeds, and Richard I. Stein
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Obesity constitutes the condition of excessive adiposity.
It is classified using body mass index (BMI).
BMI =weight in kilograms/square of the height in meters, or kg/m2.
Alternatively, lb/in2 × 703.
For adults, obesity is defined as having a BMI ≥ 30.
For children, obesity is having a BMI ≥ 95th percentile for sex/age on a BMI
growth chart (http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm).
Adults with significant muscle mass (athletes, bodybuilders) can have elevated
BMIs without excess fat. If adiposity is minimal on physical examination, they are
not obese.

Classification
Overweight describes adults with BMI between 25 and 30, and children with
BMI in the 85th to 95th percentile.
Obesity can be classified by severity and by distribution
Class 1: BMI 30 to 34.9
Class 2: BMI 35 to 39.9
Class 3: BMI ≥40 (extreme)
Central or visceral-abdominal obesity: waist circumference >102 cm (40 in)
in men, >88 cm (35 in) in women.
Gluteal-femoral obesity: adiposity distributed over the buttocks and upper legs
without the above waist circumference
The term morbid obesity has been used to describe patients with a BMI ≥ 35 with
a comorbid condition, a BMI ≥ 40 (used interchangeably with extreme), and with
424

weights >150 kg.

Epidemiology
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has been
tracking/estimating overweight/obesity in the US since 1960. The rates began to
significantly increase between 1976 and 1994. The most recent evaluation of
NHANES data showed further increases in obesity prevalence from 1999 to 2008
for men, but the trend began to plateau after 2003. There was no significant trend
in obesity prevalence for women during this 10-year period.1
African American (AA) and Hispanic women have the highest rates of overweight
and obesity.
Health risks associated with obesity may be lower for AAs than whites at the same
BMI level.
NHANES also tracks obesity in children and adolescents. Among all, 16.9% of
children age 2 to 19 had a BMI ≥ 95th percentile in 2007 to 2008 (triple the
prevalence from 1980). There has been a significant rise in the prevalence of BMI
≥ 97th percentile for boys age 6 to 19 since 1999.
Prevalence of BMI ≥ 95th percentile is highest among Hispanic boys and
adolescent AA girls.2
The normative growth curves for children are based on historical data.
Therefore, as the population increases in weight, more than 5% of children
today can be ≥ 95th percentile for BMI.

Etiology/Pathophysiology
Obesity is the result of the interaction among the environment, polygenic genetic
factors, and behavior of an individual. Fundamentally, these interactions result in the
imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, or an imbalance between
caloric intake/fat synthesis and fat oxidation. Excess caloric energy is stored as
triacyl​glycerols in adipocytes.
Genetics
Although polygenic inheritance may play a large role in susceptibility to obesity
amongst close relatives, identifiable monogenic obesity, usually extreme obesity
with early onset, is very rare.
Mutations of leptin, leptin receptor, prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
(PPAR) gamma 2 result in syndromic conditions and are inherited in a recessive
425

pattern. They are seen in consanguineous pedigrees.3
Melanocortin 4-receptor (MC4-R) mutation is non-syndromic and autosomal
dominant.4
Prader–Willi results from the deletion of paternally derived chromosome 15q11–
13, resulting in hyperphagia at a young age. Anecdotally, parents must padlock the
refrigerator and pantry.5
Hypothalamic Obesity
Results from damage to the satiety/hunger signaling regions of the hypothalamus,
leading to insatiable appetite and overeating. This is sometimes seen after
craniopharyngioma resection.
Medications
Antipsychotics: both typical and atypical
Antidepressants: paroxitine, tricyclics
Neuroleptics: gabapentin, valproic acid
Beta-blockers
Glucocorticoids
Some hypoglycemic agents: insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (TZDs)

Associated Conditions
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
Only 20% of obese people have T2DM, while 80% of those with T2DM are
obese.
The risk for T2DM increases with weight at a BMI of 23 for women (RR1.3).6
Weight gain of >5 kg after age 18 increases risk of T2DM.7
Coronary artery disease (CAD): correlation begins with increasing BMI within the
normal range.8
Congestive heart failure: increased risk 5% to 7% for every 1 kg/m2 above 309
Cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia,
dyslipidemia (high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein [HDL])
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)
Venous thromboembolism
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gallstones, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH)/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
426

Osteoarthritis (OA), gout
Increased risk of colorectal, esophageal, kidney, pancreatic, thyroid, endometrial,
gallbladder, and postmenopausal breast cancers. A weaker correlation exists for
leukemia, malignant melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and
premenopausal breast cancer.10

Mortality
Obesity is associated with increased all-cause mortality in several large
retrospective and prospective studies.
In the year 2000, there were 111,909 excess deaths associated with/attributed to
obesity, according to conservative interpretation of NHANES data.11
Mortality rate increases 30% for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI over 25.12
Men over 50 years old who have never smoked have a two- to three-fold
increase in risk of death if BMI > 30.13
Disease-specific mortality. Prospective studies show increase in mortality with
every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI above 25.12
T2DM (HR 2.16)
CAD (HR 1.39)
Cancer (HR 1.1)
Life expectancy is reduced by 7 years in those at age 40 with a BMI > 30
compared to normal weight, and reduced by 14 years if they also smoke.14

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients often do not present with a complaint about body weight, and thus a
practitioner should be very sensitive when addressing the issue, tying the need for
weight loss to medical issues and not communicating disapproval or blame. It is
only rarely necessary to rule out secondary causes of obesity. Red flags that would
prompt this include rapid weight gain without an attributable cause or symptoms of
new onset fatigue or skin coloration changes. Otherwise, review of the medication
list, history, and physical examination should be adequate to raise a clinical
suspicion of Cushing’s syndrome, thyroid illness, or hypothalamic obesity.
Hyperthyroidism may also present with weight gain, although this is less common
than weight loss. The evaluation of associated cardiovascular risk and comorbidities
may prompt medical treatment and prevention, but it is also useful to determine the
risks and benefits of the treatments for obesity itself.
427

History
Family history should include obesity, diabetes, and early-onset CAD in parents
and siblings.
Weight history should start with childhood/adolescence and include previous
weight loss attempts. A behavioral assessment for underlying eating disorders
should also be obtained when a clinical suspicion arises.
To evaluate for OSA, it is important to elicit a history of snoring and apneic
episodes (ask sleeping partner), as well as excessive daytime sleepiness (can use
the Eppworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS)
Review systems for hypo-/hyperthyroidism, Cushing’s, OA, gout, GERD,
CAD/PAD, incontinence (weight loss and bariatric surgery may alleviate
incontinence by decreasing intra-abdominal pressure).
Discuss current lifestyle: diet, activity level, smoking, recent smoking cessation
(can cause significant weight gain), alcohol, recreational drug use (indicator of
poor outcomes with weight loss and bariatric surgery), life stressors.
Physical Examination
In addition to a routine exam, the exam of the obese patient should identify
comorbid conditions and secondary causes of weight gain.
Measure height and weight after removing the shoes, coat, and any other
accessories. Having the patient change into an appropriate-size gown will both
provide an accurate and comparable weight for future visits and facilitate the
remainder of the physical exam.
Measure the waist circumference using a tape measure, with the patient standing
after relaxed exhalation. Keep the tape parallel to the floor at the level of the right
lower costal margin (see Figure 32-1). This measurement can function as a
starting point to monitor the effects of intervention, though there can be significant
variability when abdominal folds are present.
It is very important to have a gown, scale, and tape measure that accommodate
the severely obese, and that clinic protocols minimize embarrassment to the
patient.
Use a size-appropriate cuff to measure the blood pressure.
Look for a narrow/crowded oropharynx, neck circumference >17 inches,
pulmonary rales, right-sided heart failure (jugular venous distension,
hepatosplenomegaly, lower extremity edema), goiter, deep tendon reflexes (brisk
or delayed relaxation), tremor, facial plethora, purple abdominal striae, bruising,
thin
skin,
acanthosis
nigricans,
proximal
weakness,
428

supraclavicular/dorsoclavicular fat, hirsutism, acne, paniculitis, cellulitis, and
candidiasis in deep skin folds.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Routine laboratory tests: fasting blood glucose, fasting lipid panel, thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH), complete metabolic panel including alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline
phosphatase.
Though NAFLD is common in obesity (present in 85% of those with a BMI >
40), other causes of liver dysfunction should be ruled out (as clinically
indicated) before ascribing transaminitis to obesity.15
Additional laboratory testing to diagnose suspectedsecondary causes of
obesity and comorbidities:
Cushing’s syndrome: proximal muscle weakness, moon face, hyperpigmented
stretch marks, mood change (see Chapter 14)
PCOS: Rotterdam criteria include two out of anovulation, physical, or
biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism, radiographic evidence of
polycystic ovaries (see Chapter 20)
FIGURE 32-1 Guide to measuring waist circumference

429

OHS: OSA, dyspnea on exertion, cyanosis. Check arterial blood gas on room
air.16
Screening for genetic causes of obesity is not cost effective or recommended.
Imaging
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), CT, and MRI do not have a clear role in
clinical practice.
Diagnostic Procedures
If a patient has symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness,
observed apneas), polysomnography should be obtained.17 Among patients in whom
there is a clinical suspicion of an underlying disorder contributing to obesity,
appropriate lab testing should be performed.
Miscellaneous
430

Routine evaluation for CAD is not indicated in asymptomatic obese patients without
diabetes. Evaluation of any suspected comorbidities (e.g., CAD, GERD) should be
conducted according to current evidence- or expert opinion–based standards and
guidelines. These are beyond the scope of this text.

TREATMENT
Benefits of Weight Loss
Five percentage weight loss achieved using lifestyle intervention (diet and
exercise) can reduce fasting glucose and reduce the need for diabetes
medications.
Those with prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose)
have a decreased incidence of progression to T2DM with as little as 4 kg of
weight loss when combined with regular physical activity, as seen in the Diabetes
Prevention Program.18
Improvement in triglycerides and HDL. Weight loss without changing
macronutrients rarely dramatically alters LDL cholesterol.19
For every 1 kg loss, systolic and diastolic blood pressure fall 1 mm Hg.20
It should be noted that the recommendations for weight loss in this chapter do not
pertain to obese pregnant women. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends
that women with a prepregnancy BMI > 30 gain 11 to 20 lbs during pregnancy.21

Weight Loss Goals
A reasonable, achievable, safe, and effective goal is 5% to 10% weight loss, at a
rate of 1 to 2 lbs/week over 6 months, with lifelong weight maintenance.
Weight loss >2% per week increases the risk of cholelithiasis and should be
avoided after the first few weeks, when weight loss is typically more rapid.

Diet
Long-term (i.e., >1 year) weight loss is challenging to achieve. Patients
participating in dietary modification programs may benefit from behavioral
modification programs to reduce long-term recidivism.
An energy deficit (calories burned minus calories eaten) of 500 to 1000 kcal/day
will result in 1 to 2 lbs loss/week.
Very low-calorie diets (<800 kcal/day) can result in 20% weight loss in 4 months,
but increase the risk of gallstones and do not have added benefit in long-term
weight loss.19
431

Low-Fat or Low-Carbohydrate Diets
A low-fat diet (<30% of calories from fat, >50% from carbohydrates) has been the
recommended diet by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) since at least the
mid-1990s. Very low-fat diets (<15% from fat), such as the Ornish diet, are quite
high in carbohydrates and can exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia
in patients with diabetes. The LEARN diet (lifestyle, education, attitudes,
relationships, and nutrition) recommends <10% of calories from saturated fat,
55% to 60% from carbohydrates, and overall calorie restriction.22
Low-carbohydrate diets are another option, with variable popularity. The USDA
recommended daily allowance (RDA) for carbohydrate is 130 g. Lowcarbohydrate diets have less than this amount, but can vary widely in
carbohydrate, protein, and fat content. A ketogenic diet contains a level of
carbohydrates so low that glycogen stores are depleted, glucose is produced from
amino acids and triglycerides by gluconeogenesis, and hepatic fatty acid
metabolism results in increased circulating and urinary ketone bodies. This begins
at below 50 g of carbohydrates/day. These diets, including the Atkins™ diet,
often allow ad lib protein and fat ingestion to achieve satiety. Patients tend to
automatically eat a calorie-restricted diet when given these parameters, due to
increased satiety and/or fewer palatable food choices. The Zone® diet limits
carbohydrates to 40% of a calorie-restricted diet, but is not ketogenic.22
Several studies have contrasted the efficacy and metabolic effects of lowcarbohydrate and low-fat diets to achieve weight loss. Initial 6-month weight loss
is often greater in the low-carbohydrate diet, but several studies show that weight
loss is equal to low-fat diets by 1 year. 23 Randomized control trials (RCTs) show
HDL and triglycerides improve more on low-carbohydrate diets, but LDL
improves more on low-fat diets.24 An RCT comparing the Atkins™, Zone ®,
LEARN, and Ornish diets showed that Atkins™ resulted in more weight loss,
higher HDL, lower triglycerides, better blood pressure, and same LDL at 1 year
compared to the other diets.22
These findings were confirmed with a 2-year-long multi-center RCT of 307
patients that compared a low-carbohydrate diet (starting at 20 g/day) and a lowfat diet. The low-carbohydrate diet resulted in improved weight loss at 3 months,
lower diastolic blood pressure for most of the 24 months, lower triglycerides and
VLDL up to 12 months, and higher HDL throughout the entire 2 years. The low-fat
diet group had better LDL for the first 6 months. There were no serious
cardiovascular events in either group.25
Low-Fat or Low-Carbohydrate Diets in Diabetes
432

A low-carbohydrate diet would reduce average blood glucose levels in patients
with T2DM by limiting postprandial glucose excursions from absorbed dietary
carbohydrates, in addition to any improvement in insulin sensitivity from weight
loss. The above studies either examined all patients, or excluded diabetics.
In patients with insulin resistance/glucose intolerance, 48 hours of calorie
restriction with a low-carbohydrate diet results in a greater decrease in
intrahepatic triglyceride content, hepatic glucose output, fasting glucose level, and
insulin resistance compared to a low-fat diet.26
The ADA now recommends either a low-fat or low-carbohydrate (≤130 g/day)
diet for weight loss in overweight/obese patients with T2DM.
A meta-analysis indicated that low-carbohydrate diets showed improvement in
A1c and triglycerides in diabetic patients compared to low-fat diets, but no
statistically significant difference in weight or lipids.27
A 4-year RCT of overweight, newly diagnosed T2DM patients assigned to a
Mediterranean diet (increased unsaturated fats, <50% calories from
carbohydrates) or low-fat diet showed significant reduction in the need to start
oral hypoglycemics with the low-carbohydrate diet.28
A low-carbohydrate Mediterranean diet (LCM: <35% calories from
carbohydrates) was compared to the ADA-recommended low-fat diet in
overweight T2DM patients for 1 year. LCM showed a statistically significant
improvement in triglycerides, A1c, fasting glucose, HDL, and LDL compared to
the low-fat diet. Improvements in weight were similar.29
A ketogenic diet in obese diabetic patients for 24 weeks resulted in a lower A1c,
weight, and triglycerides, a higher HDL, and reduction in diabetes medications
compared to a low glycemic index diet (and a mean LDL increase of only 1.3
mg/dL) for those who completed the trial.30
Authors’ conclusion: for overweight or obese patients without diabetes,
prediabetes, or dyslipidemia, any diet that creates an energy deficit to induce and
maintain weight loss will be beneficial. For patients with these conditions, a lowcarbohydrate approach may provide additional metabolic and cardiovascular risk
factor benefit, and may reduce the use of diabetes medications, compared to a
low-fat diet. Long-term studies of cardiovascular and microvascular outcomes
have not been done to compare these two strategies.
Special Considerations for Low-Carbohydrate Diet
Before recommending carbohydrate restriction to an individual patient, consider
the potential consequences of increasing the other macronutrients, which a patient
may do to replace the carbohydrates in meals. Patients with significant chronic
433

kidney disease may benefit from protein limitation, those with CAD and elevated
LDL need to restrict cholesterol and saturated fats, and those with primary
hypertriglyceridemia need to strictly limit total fat intake. Specifying protein and
fat quality and content, or avoiding a low-carbohydrate approach completely, may
be appropriate in these individuals.
Those with T2DM will need a medication adjustment that reflects this change in
diet, specifically to prevent hypoglycemia. Sulfonylureas, prandial insulin, and
basal insulin doses may need to be decreased or discontinued. These changes
should be made proactively, and further adjustments made based on frequent
monitoring of blood glucose levels.
Use caution with low-carbohydrate diets among obese patients with type 1
diabetes who are prone to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and/or severe
hypoglycemia. A ketogenic diet is not recommended for type 1 diabetes, as it has
not been adequately studied in this population and may increase the risk of DKA.

Physical Activity
An increase in physical activity alone, without caloric restriction, does not result
in significant or sustainable weight loss, but regular physical activity helps to
maintain weight loss and prevent weight gain during and after successful dieting.31
Before starting an obese patient with cardiovascular disease risk factors on a
moderate to intense exercise program, a provider should consider evaluation with
an exercise stress test based on current guidelines.32
Recommended physical activity for weight loss is 30 to 45 minutes of aerobic
activity at moderate intensity, 3 to 5 days per week, and gradual increase in
frequency and duration from there. Those who were previously inactive should
start with 10 minutes/day and gradually increase low-intensity activity. To
maintain weight loss long-term, many studies show that 60 to 75 minutes of
moderate-intensity activity daily is needed. This kind of exercise can be done
in/around the home and be divided into several sessions/day to increase
compliance.19
Physical activity level and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with decreased
cardiovascular disease risk factors, independent of obesity. Patients should be
encouraged to continue exercise even if weight loss goals are not met in order to
achieve these potential benefits.33

Lifestyle Change Programs
Just giving a list of goals to a patient regarding his/her caloric intake and exercise
requirements does not result in significant weight loss or medical benefit. The use
434

of behavior modification techniques to help the patient modify his/her diet and
physical activity may improve adherence and sustained weight loss.
Success is correlated with frequency of visits to a provider managing weight loss,
which is unrealistic in a physician practice. The patient can be referred to a
dietitian, a comprehensive medical weight management program, or to a
commercial weight loss program to provide this frequency/intensity. Examples
of behavioral topics addressed typically include social support for
dietary/activity changes, overcoming high-risk situations (e.g., parties, restaurants,
cold weather for exercise), maintaining motivation over time, and emotional
eating.
One should assess the patient’s desire and willingness to make lifestyle changes,
and set realistic goals to promote an energy deficit. A common first step is for the
patient to keep a food diary (paper-and-pencil or computer/web-based),
recording all foods and drinks for at least 3 days, including a weekend day. It is
helpful for the patient and practitioner to know the patient’s current energy intake
to make an evaluation and initiate a change, though patient self-reporting can be
highly inaccurate and unreliable.
To promote honest recording, it is essential for the practitioner to be
nonjudgmental when reviewing a patient’s food diary. It will be most helpful for a
practitioner and patient to generate concrete changes for the patient’s eating (e.g.,
cut fast food to one time per week, eliminate caloric soft drinks) and physical
activity (e.g., walk for 30 minutes, 3 times per week), and problem-solve
barriers, in order for patients to achieve success.

Medical Therapy
Pharmacotherapy can be added to lifestyle modification if the patient was unable
to achieve weight loss goals with lifestyle alone. Overall, medical therapy
provides modest benefit during treatment, but needs to be continued lifelong to
maintain weight loss. There is limited data on improvements in morbidity, and
none on mortality, with drug-induced weight loss.
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommends that medications
for weight loss only be used in patients with a BMI > 30, or >27 with a
comorbidity that may improve with weight loss.
FDA Approved
Anorexiant sympathomimetics are Schedule IV drugs due to potential for abuse.
They were FDA approved for short-term use only (12 weeks) prior to new
standards set in 1996. They are not recommended for prolonged use or sustained
435

weight loss and carry significant cardiovascular side effects.
Phenteremine (Adipex-P): 18.75 to 37.5 mg/day taken before breakfast or
divided BID. Efficacy: in RCT, lost 13 kg versus 4.8 kg with placebo in 36
weeks.34
Phendimetrazine (Bontril): 105 mg PO daily before breakfast (slow-release
capsule)
Diethylpropion: 75 mg PO daily (controlled-release capsule)
Orlistat (Xenical, Alli) acts as an intestinal lumen lipase inhibitor, decreasing the
absorption of ingested fats, thereby increasing the fecal fat content. It is the only
medication approved for prolonged use (4 years) by the FDA.
120 mg PO TID with any fat-containing meal. Each meal should contain <30%
calories from fat.
Produced 11% versus 6% weight loss in 1 year. Reduced conversion from
prediabetes to diabetes at 4 years. Reduction in LDL also seen.35
Less than 1% of the drug is absorbed into the blood stream, so the side effects
are mostly lower GI, including fatty/oily stool, increased defecation, and fecal
urgency. These occur within the first 4 weeks in 15% to 20% of patients, then
resolve spontaneously. A patient should start this medication over the weekend
(with easy access to a restroom) so the initial effects do not interfere with
work/school.
It also blocks the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, so patients should also take
a daily multivitamin 2 hours before or after orlistat.
Sibutramine (Meridia) was previously the only appetite suppressant approved for
long-term use (2 years) for weight loss. It was voluntarily taken off the market in
October 2010 after the Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (SCOUT)
showed that there was a 16% increase in the relative risk of nonfatal MI and
stroke, and about a 5% weight loss.36
Off-Label Use
Antidepressants
Fluoxetine 60 mg/day showed 4.8 kg versus 2.4 kg loss with placebo at 6
months, with half regained at 1 year.37
Bupropion SR 400 mg/day showed 10.1% versus 5% weight loss at 24 weeks.
Weight loss was sustained at 48 weeks.38
Antiepileptics
Topiramate: 6.5% versus 2% at 6 months. Side effects include somnolence and
436

metabolic acidosis.39
Zonisamide: 9.6 versus 1.6% at 32 weeks.40
Diabetes drugs
Metformin, pramlintide, exenatide, and liraglutide have been shown to be
either weight-neutral or weight loss inducing compared to insulin,
sulfonylureas, and TZDs. Regarding the injectable therapies, nausea and
decreased caloric intake may be the mechanism for this effect.

BARIATRIC SURGERY
Bariatric surgery encompasses any surgery on the gastrointestinal system that is
meant to result in weight loss for the obese patient. These procedures cause weight
loss by a combination of restriction and malabsorption. Restrictive procedures
physically limit the amount of food that can be eaten in a short amount of time before
the patient feels satiated or even nauseated, thereby significantly reducing daily
caloric intake without inducing hunger. A malabsorptive procedure limits the
exposure of fully digested food (after mixing with bile and pancreatic enzymes) to
the small intestinal lumen.

Eating disorder

Improvement in Comorbidities with Surgical Therapy
Diabetes resolution, see Results under section on Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.
Hypertension: resolved in 62%. Resolved or improved in 78.5%.
OSA: resolved in 85.7%.41
NAFLD: 84% resolution of steatosis at 2 years.42
High triglycerides, low HDL: 85% remission.
OHS: 76% remission after 2 years.43
GERD: 95% resolution/significant improvement almost immediately.44
Osteoarthritis: 50% of patients are able to decrease pain medication dose.45
Mortality: 40% decrease in long-term all-cause mortality despite an increase in
deaths from non-disease (accidents, suicides, etc.). There was a reduction in
death rate from diabetes (92%), CAD (59%), and cancer (60%) in a matched
control study of nearly 10,000 surgery patients with mean 7.1-year follow-up.
This equated to preventing 136 deaths per 10,000 surgeries.46

Preoperative Care
Optimize glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Determining the need for
medications including insulin and their doses to achieve control prior to surgery
may help predict the chances of complete remission.
A perioperative glycemic control plan should be discussed preoperatively,
including discontinuation of oral hypoglycemics at admission, and anticipating
that those requiring insulin and those having diabetes for over 10 years
preoperatively are likely to continue to require medication after discharge.
Estrogen therapy should be discontinued 1 month prior to surgery to reduce risk of
thromboembolic events. Some form of contraception should be used in
premenopausal women before and for 1 year after surgery. Women with PCOS
may have a significant and rapid improvement in fertility postoperatively.
Smokers should stop smoking at least 8 weeks prior to surgery and have a plan to
maintain cessation postoperatively.
Evaluation for deep vein thrombosis and consideration of preoperative inferior
438

vena cava (IVC) filter placement in high-risk patients.
Psychiatry or psychology evaluation is mandatory, as significant mental illness and
eating disorders can result in morbidity and mortality after surgery.
Prior to malabsorptive procedures, micronutrient deficiencies including vitamin D
should be assessed and treated.
Patients at risk for cardiac disease should undergo risk stratification/evaluation for
perioperative beta-blockade according to current guidelines.
Preoperative weight loss using meal replacements (shakes or bars) is often done to
attempt to reduce liver volume and to potentially improve outcomes.43
FIGURE 32-2 A. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. B. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric
banding.

Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB)
Combines both restrictive and malabsorptive elements (see Figure 32-2A).
A small proximal gastric pouch, 10 to 30 mL, is created. This provides the
restrictive component.
Procedure
The jejunum is transected 15 to 100 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. The
proximal end of the distal jejunum is anastomosed to the gastric pouch, creating
the Roux limb, which will carry food away from the stomach. The free distal
439

portion of the proximal jejunum is anastomosed to the Roux limb 75 to 150 cm
from the gastric pouch, creating the biliopancreatic limb. This will carry bile,
gastric, and pancreatic secretions to mix with ingested food at the point where the
Roux and biliopancreatic limbs meet.
Ingested food, therefore, bypasses most of the stomach, the duodenum, and the
proximal jejunum, and is not broken down by digestive enzymes to enhance
absorption until mixing with them in the distal jejunum. The entire ileum is still
present for nutrient absorption, making malabsorption a small contributor to
weight loss compared to earlier surgeries, which resulted in significant
malabsorption.
Results
Seventy percentage excess weight loss at 1 year. Twenty percentage weight
regain between 2 and 5 years, then plateau (15 year follow-up showing 50%
EWL).47
Resolution of diabetes: >80% complete resolution (normoglycemic off
medications) often within weeks. Those with diabetes > 10 years and those who
require insulin treatment prior to surgery are less likely to achieve complete
resolution, but still have significant improvements in control with less need for
medication. These metabolic improvements often precede clinically detectable
weight loss.41,48
Also reduces the conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes by 30fold.49
Surgical Complications
30-day mortality: 0.2% laparoscopic, 2.1% open (higher BMI, more severe
comorbidities).50
Bowel leak, ulcer, gastro-gastric fistula, PE, MI, pneumonia, wound infection,
SBO, stomal stenosis, nausea, incisional hernia, suboptimal weight loss.
Rates of surgical complications including mortality in any bariatric procedure are
variable, and associated with the experience of the performing surgeon.
Medical Complications
Cholelithiasis, nutritional deficiencies, dumping symptoms—common
Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia—rare

Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding
A purely restrictive procedure with the benefits of adjustability and reversibility
440

(see Figure 32-2B).
Procedure
A n inflatable band is placed around the top of the stomach, creating a gastric
pouch. The gastric fundus is stitched to the area above the band. A subcutaneous
port is placed in the anterior abdomen. There is no rearrangement of gastrointestinal
sequence. The amount of band inflation can be adjusted by accessing the
subcutaneous port with a needle, and adding or subtracting saline. The bariatric
surgeon will frequently assess symptoms and rate of weight loss to determine the
need for adjustment.
Results
35% to 45% EWL at 2 to 10 years51.
Resolution of diabetes in 60% at 2 years, proportional to weight loss.
Complications
Operative mortality 0.1%.51
Acute obstruction, PE, MI, band slippage, esophageal dilation, band erosion,
balloon failure, port malposition, band and port infections, maladaptive eating,
suboptimal weight loss.

Less Common Surgeries
Vertical banded gastroplasty: 15 to 45 mL pouch, 10 to 11 mm outlet, replaced
by LAGB because the latter is less invasive, adjustable, reversible, and has better
outcomes.
Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD): subtotal gastrectomy (200 to 500 mL pouch).
Small intestines divided 250 cm from the cecum and the proximal portion of the
distal segment is anastomosed to the gastric pouch, creating the alimentary limb.
The biliopancreatic limb is anastomosed to the ileum 50 cm from the cecum. BPD
is less restrictive but much more malabsorptive than RYGB. Protein calorie
malabsorption, steatorrhea, iron and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, and
metabolic bone disease are common. It is rarely performed in the United States
anymore, but may be appropriate for some patients with a BMI > 60.
Sleeve gastrectomy: resection of the greater curve of the stomach, preserving the
gastric antrum. This leaves a path for food along the lesser curve, from the
esophageal to the pyloric sphincter, but greatly reduces gastric volume.
BPD with duodenal switch: BPD, but with a sleeve gastrectomy, and the
441

alimentary limb is anastomosed to the gastric pylorus.

Postoperative Care
Diet
There are minor differences in the recommendations for RYGB and LAGB, and
these details are beyond the scope of this text.
Stages I–III (at least 5 weeks): initially clear liquid (always sugar-free) slowly
advanced to solid protein (>60 g/day), fruits, vegetables, and salads (chewing
thoroughly), avoiding rice, bread, and pasta. Multiple small meals. Greater than
1.5 L fluid daily. Do not drink until 30 minutes after meals.
Stage IV: balanced meals including whole grains, using small plates and utensils,
and vitamin/mineral supplements (1 to 2 chewable multivitamins per day,
containing iron, calcium, and B-complex).43
Diabetes Control
See Chapter 30.
Avoid long-acting insulin in the immediate perioperative period. IV insulin can be
used intra/postoperatively if necessary. All oral and non-insulin injectable
hypoglycemic agents should be avoided during hospitalization.
Achieving inpatient glucose control should be no different than other postoperative
populations. Critically ill patients require IV insulin titrated per protocol to keep
BG in the 140–180 mg/dL range. In non-critically ill patients, long-acting insulin
analogues should be used to achieve target fasting glucose <140. A correctiondose of rapid-acting insulin should also be given every 4 to 6 hours for
hyperglycemia.
In the only published RCT of inpatient diabetes management after gastric bypass,
those treated with 0.3 U/kg glargine once daily plus sliding scale had improved
glucose control compared to those on sliding scale regular insulin only, without
significant hypoglycemia.52
The basal insulin requirements may fall significantly over several postoperative
days as glycogen stores are depleted and insulin resistance wanes. Fixed-dose
prandial insulin should not be needed, as the Stage I diet is carbohydrate-free
liquids. Insulin can be discontinued if the patient has T2DM and continues to meet
glycemic targets without insulin.
There are no published guidelines regarding outpatient management of glucose
control after weight loss surgery. The following is the authors’/editors’ personal
recommendation.
442

At discharge, some patients may still require basal insulin to maintain a fasting
blood glucose <140 mg/dL. They can be placed on metformin titrated to
maximum dose as tolerated if not contraindicated. They can be discharged on
their hospital dose of basal insulin, and instructed to check glucose fasting
daily. When fasting glucoses fall below 100, basal insulin doses can be
reduced by 20%. This reduction can be repeated when fasting glucose again
falls below 100 mg/dL, until insulin can be discontinued.
It is unknown how often a patient with T2DM will require prandial insulin on
the prescribed low-carbohydrate diet (Stage I–III). Those that do should be
very cautious and check 2-hour postprandial blood glucose to monitor for
hypoglycemia. A plan to titrate down this dose for postprandial lows should be
provided to the patient at discharge.
Once a patient is no longer on insulin, he/she can remain on metformin until the
A1c falls into the normal range.
An A1c under 5.7 and a fasting glucose under 100 on no hypoglycemic medication
are indicative of diabetes remission. The effect of continued metformin treatment
on weight regain and diabetes recurrence after weight loss surgery has not been
assessed.
Hyperlipidemia
There is no evidence to support empiric discontinuation of statin therapy after
surgery. Routine monitoring is recommended, following National Cholesterol
Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) guidelines.53
Hypertension
Hypotension may develop postoperatively in the setting of poor fluid intake, leading
to hypovolemia. Consider holding diuretic therapy until adequate intake is confirmed
to avoid hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.
Gallbladder Disease
300 mg/day ursodiol for 6 months reduces clinically significant gallstone disease in
patients who have not undergone prophylactic cholecystectomy.54
Skeletal/Mineral Homeostasis
Obese patients presenting for bariatric surgery have high rates of vitamin D
deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. In RYGB, dietary calcium
bypasses the duodenum, where vitamin D-dependent calcium absorption takes
place. There is increased risk of hypocalcemia and secondary
443

hyperparathyroidism in the absence of supplementation.55
After RYGB, routine daily vitamin D and calcium supplementation (1500 mg +
800 IU) improves vitamin D levels and prevents hypocalcemia in vitamin D
deficient patients, but secondary hyperparathyroidism may persist.56
Urine N-telopeptides and serum osteocalcin rise while bone mineral density falls.
The fall in bone density and increased bone turnover can be attributed to weight
loss itself, as there is a decrease in the mechanical weight-bearing of bones when
significant weight is lost. DXA may not truly reflect the change in bone density
when the density of surrounding tissues drastically changes over a period of
months.57
In a RCT of 60 women with vitamin D insufficiency prior to surgery, 50,000 units
ergocalciferol/week for 1 year after RYGB showed:
Significant improvement in vitamin D levels, fewer patients with deficiency
No difference in calcium, PTH, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urine Ntelopeptides
Hip bone mineral density fell 0.08% versus 0.12%
Rate of hypertension resolution: 75% versus 32% (p = 0.029)
The authors concluded that all patients undergoing RYGB should receive daily
elemental calcium 1500 mg, and cholecalciferol 2000 IU. Patients with low
vitamin D levels preoperatively should also be treated with 50,000 IU
ergocalciferol weekly, checking a vitamin D level every 6 to 12 months.58
Calcium carbonate preparations should be chewable and taken with food to assist
absorption. Calcium citrate will be better absorbed, and can be taken without
food, as it does not need acidic gastric contents.
The Endocrine Society guidelines recommend vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus,
PTH, and alkaline phosphatase levels be checked every 6 months.53
Osteoporosis treatment with IV bisphosphonates is preferred over orals due to
concern over absorption and anastomotic ulceration, but only after correction of
vitamin D deficiency and with adequate calcium supplementation.43
Micronutrient Deficiencies after RYGB
Iron deficiency is found in 25% to 75% of patients by 5 to 10 years. Iron is
absorbed predominantly in the duodenum and requires gastric acid for optimal
absorption. Deficiency should be monitored for biannually with CBC and iron
studies, and treated. It should be prevented in menstruating women after RYGB
with twice-daily 65 mg elemental iron supplementation. Vitamin C
coadministration (and taking separately from calcium supplementation) will help
444

iron absorption. IV iron is sometimes needed if oral supplementation fails to
correct deficiency.
B12 deficiency (in RYGB) is found in 8% to 40% of patients by 1 year. Routine
supplementation with vitamin B12 > 350 ug/day is appropriate in all RYGB
patients. Biannual assessment of B12 status is recommended.
Folate deficiency can be prevented with folic acid 400 mcg/day, which may be
included in multivitamin preparations.
Thiamine deficiency, which can lead to Wernicke encephalopathy, is seen in
patients with recurrent/persistent vomiting needing IV fluids. Consider thiamine
supplementation for those patients.43
Copper deficiency is increased after gastric bypass, as copper is absorbed in the
stomach, duodenum, and upper jejunum. Signs include anemia, leukopenia, and
neurologic manifestations similar to B12 deficiency. Prevention strategies beyond
multivitamin are unclear, but persistent illness/anemia after correcting for other
deficiencies should prompt evaluation for copper deficiency. IV copper may be
necessary in patients with a deficiency.
Dumping Syndrome
Abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, diarrhea, lightheadedness, flushing,
tachycardia, and syncope shortly after eating in patients who have had RYGB. It
results from the consumption of carbohydrate-dense or hypertonic foods and
beverages that enter the intestines quickly. It has been reported in 70% to 76% of
RYGB patients, but may serve an important role in behavior adjustment, causing
patients to avoid behaviors that lead to the uncomfortable symptoms.
Behaviors that prevent or lessen these symptoms include eating small frequent
meals, not drinking until 30 minutes after meals, and avoiding simple sugars,
replacing them with fiber, complex carbohydrates, and protein.53
Postprandial Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia
Presents with neuroglycopenic symptomatic hypoglycemia after meals. Diagnosis
is made by a negative 72-hour fast for hypoglycemia, but positive
hyperinsulinemia with hypoglycemia within 5 hours after a mixed meal tolerance
test, and negative imaging for an insulinoma. This rare syndrome presents between
years 2 and 9 postoperatively from RYGB.
Medical management includes low-carbohydrate meals, acarbose, calcium channel
blockers, diazoxide, and octreotide. Refractory patients have been treated with
80% pancreatectomy with improvement, but not absolute resolution. Pathology
suggests islet hyperplasia.59

Dyslipidemia
Mariko Johnson and Anne C. Goldberg
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has developed optimal
ranges for fasting levels of all four lipid parameters for adults.1 Dyslipidemia can
be diagnosed if any of the following are present:
Total cholesterol >200 mg/dL
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol >100 mg/dL
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol <40 mg/dL
Triglycerides >150 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia usually fits one of four general patterns:
Isolated hypertriglyceridemia
Isolated elevation in LDL-cholesterol
Combined elevation of triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol
Any of the above with the addition of a low HDL-cholesterol

Epidemiology
Dyslipidemia is very common in Western society. It affects 90% of patients with
coronary artery disease2 and close to 30% of patients without clinical coronary
disease.3

Etiology
It is widely accepted that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in the
development of dyslipidemia.
The underlying pathophysiology of dyslipidemia in most cases is likely complex
and remains obscure. However, certain cases have a clear genetic basis, and in a
subset of these, a well-defined underlying mechanism exists (see Table 33-1).
451

Differential diagnosis of the major lipid abnormalities is summarized in Table 332.

Prevention
Diet, exercise, and weight loss play a large role in the prevention and treatment of
dyslipidemia.

Associated Conditions
Dyslipidemia is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular,
cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease. Targeted lowering of LDLcholesterol has demonstrated a benefit in both primary and secondary prevention
of coronary disease.4 Elevated triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol likely
confer additional risk, although the benefit of lowering triglycerides and raising
HDL-cholesterol is less well established.
TABLE 33-1 REVIEW OF MAJOR GENETIC DYSLIPOPROTEINEMIAS

452

TABLE 33-2 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF MAJOR LIPID
ABNORMALITIES

453

Dyslipidemia is often associated with a constellation of additional metabolic
abnormalities including obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and fatty liver
disease.
Severely elevated triglycerides are a risk factor for pancreatitis.

DIAGNOSIS
Screening for dyslipidemia should be performed at least once every 5 years
beginning at age 20 and in high-risk patients diagnosed with vascular disease,
diabetes, or pancreatitis.1 Certain physical examination findings (see Physical
Examination section) can be a clue to a lipid disorder and should prompt a screening
lipid panel (see Table 33-1).

454

Clinical Presentation
History
The history should focus on identification of secondary causes of dyslipidemia or
family history of premature coronary disease, and evaluation of cardiovascular risk
factors. Consideration of secondary causes requires that the clinician pay attention to
diet, medications, and alcohol consumption in addition to comorbid conditions (see
Table 33-2). A detailed family history should also be sought, as a strong family
history of premature coronary disease may suggest a genetic dyslipoproteinemia (see
Table 33-1). Determination of risk factors is important because cardiovascular risk
determines an individual patient’s goal LDL-cholesterol, thereby affecting treatment
(see Section Treatment).
Physical Examination
The physical examination should focus on identification of occult vascular disease
(bruits) and physical findings that suggest a severe dyslipoproteinemia, such as
tendon xanthomas, palmar xanthomas, eruptive xanthomas, tuberous xanthomas,
xanthelasma, lipemia retinalis, or premature arcus corneae.

Diagnostic Testing
The fasting lipid panel is the cornerstone of diagnosis.
Most laboratories directly measure levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and
HDL-cholesterol, but calculate LDL-cholesterol. If triglycerides are >400 mg/dL,
calculated LDL-cholesterol measurements are not reliable and direct LDLcholesterol should be measured.
A new diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia should prompt screening for diabetes,
hypothyroidism, and renal failure.
A new diagnosis of elevated LDL-cholesterol should prompt screening for
hypothyroidism, obstructive liver disease, and the nephrotic syndrome.

TREATMENT
The NCEP adult treatment panel (ATP) III guidelines define a stepwise approach
to the patient with dyslipidemia.1 An update to these guidelines was published in
20045 and release of revised guidelines is expected in 2012. The guidelines make
optimization of LDL-cholesterol the primary target of therapy but guide clinicians
in addressing abnormalities in other lipid parameters.
Step 1: Treat severely elevated triglycerides.
455

If triglycerides are severely elevated (>500 mg/dL), this must be addressed
before LDL-cholesterol as it predisposes to pancreatitis.
Treatment should include:
A very low fat diet (<15% of calories from fat)
Increased physical activity
Weight loss if overweight
Drug therapy with a fibrate or niacin (if necessary)
Once triglycerides are <500 mg/dL, clinicians can turn their attention to LDLcholesterol targets.
Step 2: Determine coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.
The ATP III guidelines provide a formal method of CHD risk assessment.
TABLE 33-3 ADULT TREATMENT PROGRAM III (ATP III) CATEGORIES
OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD) RISK

ATP III recognizes five categories of CHD risk—very high, high, moderately
high, moderate, and lower risk. These CHD risk categories are defined in
Table 33-3 and risk can be assigned using the following algorithm:
Task 1: Determine whether CHD or a CHD risk equivalent is present.
CHD
Diabetes
Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease
Peripheral artery disease
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
456

Task 2: Determine what CHD risk factors are present.
Cigarette smoking
Hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive
medication)
Low HDL-cholesterol (<40 mg/dL)
High HDL-cholesterol (≥60 mg/dL) serves as a “negative” risk factor if present,
removing one risk factor from the total count
Family history of premature CHD (CHD in a male first degree relative < age
55 or CHD in a female first degree relative < age 65)
Age (Men ≥ age 45 or Women ≥ age 55)
Task 3: Assess risk level for patients with CHD or a CHD risk equivalent.
All patients with CHD or a CHD risk equivalent fall into the high or very
high-risk categories.
High risk: CHD or a CHD risk equivalent without additional CHD risk
factors
Very high risk: CHD with combined with multiple, severe, or poorly
controlled CHD risk factors, diabetes, acute coronary syndrome, or
metabolic syndrome.
Once risk category is determined, clinicians can skip to Step 3.
Task 5: Assess risk level for patients without CHD or a CHD risk
equivalent.
Patients without CHD or a CHD risk equivalent can fall into any of the four
following categories:
Low risk: 0 to 1 CHD risk factors are present
Moderate risk, moderately high risk, high risk: 2+ CHD risk factors are
present
If risk category is determined, clinicians can skip to Step 3. If risk category
has not yet been determined, clinicians must move to Task 6.
Task 6: Calculate Framingham score for patients with 2+CHD risk factors.
A Framingham score can be calculated and translated into a 10-year CHD
risk using the system outlined in Table 33-4.
Patients with 2+ CHD risk factors can then be assigned a risk level based on
10-year CHD risk.
Moderate risk: 2+ risk factors and 10-year CHD risk <10%
Moderately high risk: 2+ risk factors and 10-year CHD risk 10% to 20%
457

High risk: 2+ risk factors and 10-year CHD risk >20%
Risk category for all patients should now be determined and clinicians can
move to Step 3.
Step 3: Determine LDL goal and initial treatment strategy.
An LDL-cholesterol goal and initial treatment strategy can be determined
directly from the CHD risk (see Table 33-5).
The NCEP guidelines recommend two basic interventions to reduce
LDL-​cholesterol.
Therapeutic lifestyle changes are recommended for all patients whose
LDL-cholesterol is above goal and in all very high-risk patients.
Dietary changes (saturated fat <7% of calories, cholesterol <200 mg/day,
consideration of soluble fiber at doses of 10 to 25 g/day and plant
phytosterols at doses of 2 g/day)
Increased physical activity
Weight management
Drug therapy should be started at the thresholds recommended by the NCEP
(see Table 33-5).
In low- and moderate-risk patients, a three-month trial of TLC alone prior
to drug therapy is permitted.
In high-risk patients (those in the moderately high-, high-, and very highrisk categories), drug therapy should be initiated immediately and an LDLcholesterol lowering of 30% should be targeted.
Step 4: Choose appropriate drug therapy if it is indicated.
The NCEP guidelines defer the choice of drug to the clinician though we
recommend that a statin be the first-line agent. The potency of available
statins can be found in Table 33-6.
Four additional classes of drugs can be used to lower LDL-cholesterol if statins
are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or if additional LDL-cholesterol
lowering is needed. Efficacy and side effects of the different classes vary and
are summarized in Table 33-7.
Bile acid sequestrants are safe and effective if significant isolated LDLcholesterol lowering is needed. Bile acid sequestrants may elevate
triglycerides and so should be avoided in cases of combined hyperlipidemia.
Niacin is an excellent choice if LDL-cholesterol lowering needs are modest,
particularly if triglycerides are also elevated.
Fibrates are less often used because they can increase risk of myopathy when
458

used in combination with statins and may paradoxically increase LDLcholesterol when triglycerides are also elevated. Fibrates lower LDLcholesterol in the setting of normal triglycerides.

Ezetimibe is an efficacious LDL lowering agent, but data on benefit in
clinical endpoint studies is limited.6,7
Step 5: Assess response to therapy and titrate drug therapy.
Response to therapy can be assessed every 6 weeks and drug therapy titrated until
LDL-cholesterol goals are met.
Step 6: Manage the metabolic syndrome.
The metabolic syndrome is a common constellation of cardiovascular risk factors
affecting around 25% of Americans.8

TABLE 33-8 ADULT TREATMENT PROGRAM III (ATP III) DIAGNOSTIC
CRITERIA FOR THE METABOLIC SYNDROME

The defining characteristics of the metabolic syndrome9 can be found in Table
463

33-8.
It has not yet been established whether the presence of the metabolic syndrome
confers a cardiovascular risk equal to or greater than the sum of its individual
components.
Dietary modification, increased physical activity, and management of
cardiovascular risk factors are the cornerstones of therapy.
Step 7: Manage elevated non-HDL-cholesterol (elevated triglycerides).
ATP III recommends treatment beyond LDL-cholesterol lowering when
triglycerides are ≥200 mg/dL.
If triglycerides remain ≥200 mg/dL after LDL-cholesterol goals are achieved, a
goal for non-HDL-cholesterol should be set 30 mg/dL higher than the original
LDL-cholesterol goal.
Non-HDL-cholesterol can be calculated according to the following formula:
Non-HDL-cholesterol = total cholesterol—HDL-cholesterol.
Non pharmacologic therapy is very important in the management of elevated
triglycerides and should include:
Encouraging weight loss and exercise
Decreasing alcohol intake
Controlling hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus
Avoiding simple sugars and very high carbohydrate diets
Changing oral estrogen replacement to transdermal estrogen
If non-HDL-cholesterol remains elevated despite nonpharmacologic therapies,
LDL-cholesterol lowering therapy can be intensified or triglyceride-lowering
agents such as fibrates, niacin, or omega-3 fatty acids can be added.
Step 8: Manage low HDL-cholesterol.
If HDL-cholesterol remains low (<40 mg/dL), niacin or fibrate treatment can be
started or intensified.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Statin intolerance
Adverse reactions to statins can be idiosyncratic and may not occur with a
different statin or a lower dose.
Pravastatin and fluvastatin appear to have less intrinsic muscle toxicity than
other statins and may be useful if patients experience myalgias with other
statins.10
464

Significant LDL-cholesterol lowering can be achieved with low-dose statins
using every other day or weekly dosing if the minimum dose of a daily statin is
not tolerated.11–15
Musculoskeletal complaints in patients on statins are not always due to statin
use. These patients should be assessed for hypothyroidism, vitamin D
deficiency, depression, and rheumatologic disease.
Liver function test abnormalities
Transaminitis with statin use may be transient and mild elevations (<3 × upper
limit of normal) can simply be monitored.
Changing the statin, lowering the dose, or choosing an agent from a different
class should be considered when serum transaminases remain persistently
elevated >3 × upper limit of normal).16
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (fatty liver) is not a contraindication to statin
use.16
Statin use can be considered in chronic well-compensated liver disease after
consideration of the risk benefit ratio.
The elderly
ATP III does not place age restrictions on treatment of hypercholesterolemia in
elderly adults.
Young adults (men ages 20 to 35 and women ages 20 to 45)
ATP III recommends TLC for young adults once LDL-cholesterol level ≥130
mg/dL.
Drug therapy should be considered in the following high-risk groups:
Men who both smoke and have elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (160 to 189
mg/dL)
All young adults with LDL-cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL
All young adults with an inherited dyslipidemia
Diabetics and other high-risk patients
ATP III recognizes the benefit of statin therapy in high-risk patients and gives
clinicians the option of treating with statins even when baseline LDLcholesterol is not elevated (<100 mg/dL).
Niacin can be used judiciously in well-controlled diabetic patients already on
antidiabetic therapy, since therapy can be intensified to compensate if
hyperglycemia develops.
Pregnancy
As a rule, lipid-lowering drugs should be avoided in pregnancy and statins, niacin,
465

and ezetimibe are contraindicated.

REFERRAL
Patients with hyperlipidemia are often managed very successfully by primary care
providers.
Endocrinology referral should be considered in cases of severe dyslipidemias
after exclusion and treatment of secondary causes.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Fasting lipid panels can be checked every 6 to 12 weeks during medication
titration.
Once lipid goals are achieved, fasting lipid panels should be assessed every 4 to 6
months.
Transaminases can be monitored with addition or dose titration of statins, fibrates,
or niacin and every 6 months once the regimen is stable.
Other laboratory studies are assessed to evaluate for side effects as determined by
symptoms. Creatinine kinase can be checked to distinguish myalgias (muscle pain
without muscle damage) from myopathy (muscle pain due to muscle damage) in
patients taking statins.

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes
Shunzhong Bao and Thomas J. Baranski
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes are sporadic or hereditary
neoplastic disorders of more than one endocrine organ. Broadly, there are two
distinct syndromes: MEN1 and MEN2. Each of these syndromes is characterized
by complete penetrance but variable expressivity. The main subtypes of MEN2
are MEN2A, with its variant, familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC), and
MEN2B.
Both MEN syndromes have an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and
provide examples of different genetic mechanisms of tumorigenesis. MEN1 is
caused by loss of function or inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. MEN 2, on
the other hand, is caused by gain of function or activation of a proto-oncogene.

Definition
MEN1 is defined as presence of at least two of three main MEN1 tumor
types: parathyroid, pituitary, and enteropancreatic. Familial MEN1 is defined
as one index case plus one relative with at least one of the three main MEN1
tumor types.
MEN2 is subclassified into three syndromes: MEN2A, FMTC, and MEN2B.
MEN2A is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by medullary thyroid
cancer (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia.
FMTC is a variant of MEN2A. There is a strong predisposition to MTC but not
for the other clinical manifestations of MEN2, such as pheochromocytoma, or
hyperparathyroidism.
MEN2B is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by MTC, marfanoid
habitus, medullated corneal nerve fibers, ganglioneuromatosis of the gut and
oral mucosa, and pheochromocytoma; hyperparathyroidism is absent.

Epidemiology
469

MEN1 is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with an incidence of 2 to 20 per
100,000 in the general population (see Table 34-1).
MEN2 is also a rare autosomal-dominant syndrome with an estimated incidence of
1 to 10 per 100,000 in the general population. It has been identified in 500 to
1000 kindred worldwide. MEN2A accounts for 80% of cases, FMTC for 15%,
and MEN2B for 5%.

Etiology
Multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (see Table 34-1)
The gene for MEN1 has been identified and is located on the long arm of
chromosome 11 (11q13). The MEN1 gene functions as a tumor suppressor gene
and encodes a 610 amino acid nuclear protein called menin. The complete
function of menin is not yet fully known, although studies suggest it might have a
role in transcriptional regulation. Although ~10% of MEN1 mutations arise de
novo, more than 400 different germline mutations have been identified.
TABLE 34-1 GENERAL FEATURES OF MEN1 AND MEN2 SYNDROMES

Rare germline mutations in other genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor gene have been implicated in MEN1-like syndromes.1,2
470

There is no correlation between the genotype and phenotype in MEN1, making
genetic screening and rational therapeutic intervention difficult.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2
Nearly all patients with the MEN2 syndrome will develop medullary thyroid
carcinoma (MTC), which is derived from the cells of the neural crest rather
than from thyroid follicular cells. Approximately 25% of patients with MTC
have one of the MEN2 variants. Pheochromocytoma is the second most
common tumor in MEN2 and is present in ~50% of patients.
The gene for MEN2 has been identified and its function well characterized.
MEN2 is caused by specific mutations in the RET (REarranged during
Transfection) proto-oncogene, located on chromosome 10 (10q11-2),
containing 21 exons and encoding a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor.3
In contrast to MEN1, there is a high degree of correlation between a specific
RET mutation and clinical phenotype. Among all, 80% to 98% of cases of
MEN2A and FMTC are caused by mutations involving exon 10 or exon 11 that
lead to ligand-independent homodimerization of the receptor with constitutive
activation and downstream signaling of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinase pathway.
In most MEN2A kindreds, one of four cysteine residues (C634, C609, C618,
C620) in the RET extracellular domain has been involved.4
On the other hand, more than 95% of MEN2B cases exhibit a single mutation at
codon 918 met to thr mutation in exon 16, and 2% to 3% have a mutation at
codon 883 in exon 15 that leads to autophosphorylation and alteration of
substrate specificity. Therefore, these are the exons that are routinely screened
for RET mutations, and because of the tight genotype–phenotype correlation,
both genetic screening as well as curative therapeutic interventions are
feasible.3

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 1
Although the presentation can be variable, the three most common features of the
MEN1 syndrome are parathyroid, enteropancreatic, and pituitary tumors. Thus
clinically, a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism and either a pituitary
adenoma or an islet cell tumor is considered to have MEN1.5 The incidence of
MEN1 has been estimated from randomly chosen postmortem studies to be 0.25%
471

and to be 1% to 18% among patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, 16% to
38% among patients with gastrinomas, and <3% among patients with pituitary
tumors (see Table 34-2).5
Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common and earliest manifestation
of MEN1 and occurs in nearly 95% of patients by the age of 50 years.
Hyperparathyroidism in MEN1, compared to its sporadic counterpart, typically
presents around at age 20 to 25 years (vs. 55 to 60 years), with an equal maleto-female ratio (compared to 1M:3F ratio), and involves all four glands (rather
than a single adenoma). Although most patients are asymptomatic, they may
present with typical symptoms and signs of hypercalcemia (polyuria, myalgias,
fatigue, renal stones).
Enteropancreatic tumors are the second most common tumors and occur in
30% to 80% of MEN1-affected individuals. They can be functional or
nonfunctional. Symptoms of hormone excess usually occur by age 40, although
with biochemical testing and imaging asymptomatic tumors in carriers can be
identified much earlier.
Gastrinoma is the most common enteropancreatic tumor, presenting in ~50%
of MEN1 patients. An initial diagnosis of gastrinoma should suggest MEN1,
because 25% to 30% of all gastrinoma patients have MEN1. The tumor
causes hypergastrinemia with increased gastric acid output (Zollinger–
Ellison syndrome). It is usually multicentric and has malignant potential.
More than half of the gastrinomas in MEN1 have already metastasized before
diagnosis, although the metastatic tumors in MEN1 are usually less
aggressive than sporadic gastrinoma tumors. These tumors account for the
major morbidity and mortality associated with MEN1. They are often located
in the duodenum and may be associated with pancreatic tumors. Patients may
present with peptic ulcer disease, diarrhea, cachexia, and abdominal pain.
Insulinoma is the second most common enteropancreatic tumor, occurring in
~10% of patients with MEN1 syndrome. Most insulinomas arise
spontaneously because <5% of patients with insulinoma have MEN1
syndrome. Patients typically present with fasting hypoglycemia. The finding
of inappropriately elevated plasma levels of insulin, C-peptide, and
proinsulin in a hypoglycemic patient is highly suggestive of insulinoma. The
tumors are usually too small to be identified by computed tomography (CT)
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but intraoperative ultrasound usually
identifies the tumor within the pancreas. For further details, see Chapter 31.
TABLE 34-2 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF MEN1, MEN2A, AND
472

MEN2B

Pituitary tumors. Anterior pituitary adenomas are seen in 15% to 90% of
patients with MEN1 and are the initial presenting tumors in 10% to 25% of
cases. Two-thirds are microadenomas, which are usually functional and
commonly secrete prolactin, resulting in the expected symptoms of prolactin
excess (amenorrhea and galactorrhea in women; impotence in men). Nearly
one-fourth of these pituitary tumors secrete growth hormone resulting in
acromegaly, and a smaller percentage secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) resulting in Cushing’s disease. The presentation, diagnosis, and
management are similar to those of sporadic pituitary adenomas (see Chapter
1).
Other tumors. Patients with MEN1 syndrome can also present with multiple
lipomas, facial angiofibromas, and collagenomas. Adrenocortical tumors, both
functional and nonfunctional, occur in 5% to 40% of patients with MEN1.
Hypercortisolism can be ACTH-dependent (pituitary adenoma or ectopic
473

ACTH syndrome) or ACTH-independent (adrenal adenoma). Although
statistically most cases are caused by pituitary adenomas, it is nevertheless
important to differentiate between the various causes by biochemical testing
(see Chapter 14).
Carcinoid tumors are present in ~3% of MEN1 patients. Nearly all carcinoid
tumors in MEN1 originate in tissues arising from the embryologic foregut.
Thymic carcinoids are predominantly seen in males, can be asymptomatic until
a late stage, and tend to be more aggressive than in sporadic tumors. Bronchial
carcinoids, by contrast, tend to occur mainly in females, can secrete ACTH, and
may present with Cushing’s syndrome. Gastric enterochromaffin-like cell
carcinoids have been found incidentally during gastric endoscopy for
gastrinoma in MEN1. Carcinoid syndrome generally does not occur unless the
tumor has metastasized to the liver (see Chapter 35).
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2
The presenting features of MEN2 are largely dependent on the subtype (see Table
34-2). However, the common underlying feature in virtually all patients with
MEN2A, MEN2B, and FMTC is the development of MTC, which is the most
common cause of morbidity and death in patients with the MEN2 syndrome.6
MTC is the first clinical manifestation in MEN2 kindreds because of its earlier
and higher penetrance, occurring in nearly all patients with MEN2. MTC is
preceded by C-cell hyperplasia (CCH), with resultant secretion of calcitonin,
which serves as an excellent plasma tumor marker. CCH progresses to
microscopic MTC, followed by local disease (usually multicentric), and
eventually by metastatic disease (commonly to lymph nodes, lung, liver, and
bones). MTC usually presents as a thyroid nodule and/or increased serum
calcitonin.
The severity of MTC depends on the MEN2 subtype. It tends to be more
aggressive in MEN2B, usually presenting before 5 years of age and as early
as infancy.6
By contrast, MTC is the only manifestation of FMTC (a variant of MEN2A)
and has an indolent clinical course. FMTC presents later in life, with a peak
incidence in the fourth and fifth decades. It tends to be less aggressive than
the other subtypes of MEN2. The criteria to characterize kindred as having
FMTC include MTC in more than 10 carriers in the kindred, multiple
carriers or affected members older than age 50, and an adequate history to
rule out pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism. Such strict diagnostic
criteria are necessary because some MEN2A patients may manifest only
474

MTC and thus be incorrectly designated as FMTC, with the resulting danger
of missing a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.
Pheochromocytoma. Almost one-half of the patients with MEN2A and MEN2B
have pheochromocytoma. Compared to sporadic cases, pheochromocytoma in
MEN2 is almost always benign, bilateral, and confined to the adrenal glands
and presents earlier in life. If unrecognized, it can present as hypertensive
crisis during surgery for MTC early in childhood. The clinical presentation,
diagnosis, and management are similar to that seen in sporadic cases (see
Chapter 15). The earliest reported age of diagnosis of pheochromocytomas is
12 years old in patients with 918 codon RET mutation.7
Primary hyperparathyroidism is seen in about one-third of the patients with
MEN2A, but it is absent in MEN2B. It is usually caused by four-gland
hyperplasia, although it is less aggressive than in MEN1. The clinical
presentation, diagnosis, and management are similar to those in MEN1 and that
seen in sporadic cases (see Chapter 22). It is important to evaluate the
parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy for patients with MEN2A because
they may be enlarged even though the preoperative calcium level is normal.
Cutaneous lichen amyloidosis (CLA) can occur in some MEN 2A or FMTC
families. This is most often associated with mutations in the RET codon 634. It
presents with intensive pruritis and is sometimes difficult to treat. The
American Thyroid Association recommends that patients with lichen planus
amyloidosis or pruritis in the central upper back be tested for the presence of a
634 codon mutation.8,9
Other features associated with MEN2B. In addition to MTC and
pheochromocytoma, patients with MEN2B also manifest a characteristic
marfanoid habitus, but do not have lens subluxation or aortic disease.10
Ganglioneuromas occur in 95% of MEN2B patients, which can present at the
lips, eyelids, and tongue, giving these patients a characteristic phenotype that
can be apparent at birth.
Intestinal ganglioneuromatosis can occur as early as infancy with
gastrointestinal motility disorders. One study reported 90% of patients had
colonic disturbances, typically chronic constipation since birth.9

Diagnostic Criteria
MEN1 is present if the patient has two of the three main MEN1-related tumors:
parathyroid, pituitary, and enteropancreatic. Familial MEN1 is diagnosed as at
least one case of MEN1 plus a first-degree relative with one of the three tumors.5
475

The MEN2 syndrome is diagnosed in a patient with personal or family history
of MTC and positive germline RET gene mutation. This is a great example of a
genetic disorder in which genetic testing allows for early diagnosis and effective
prophylactic surgical intervention. In patients who present with a suspicious
thyroid nodule, fine-needle aspiration biopsy may establish the diagnosis of MTC.
The MEN 2A syndrome is diagnosed in a patient with personal or family history
of the presence of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and primary
hyperparathyroidism associated with a germline RET mutation. Clinical
diagnosis of MEN 2A can be made if at least two of the classical clinical features
of MEN 2A are present in the index case or two generations, even in the absence
of an autosomal dominant familial inheritance pattern or RET mutation. In the
presence of a germline RET mutation and in the absence of any clinical features,
that individual is said to be at risk for the clinical features of MEN 2A, and
appropriate medical management should be followed.
Familial MTC is a clinical variant of MEN2A. There is no other manifestation of
MEN2. To prove that a particular kindred has FMTC, it is necessary to
demonstrate the absence of a pheochromocytoma or primary hyperthyroidism in
two or more generations within a family or to have a RET mutation identified only
in kindreds with FMTC. It is very difficult to be sure that FMTC is the diagnosis
instead of MEN 2A.
The MEN2B syndrome is diagnosed in a patient with personal or family history
of MTC and positive germline RET gene mutation at 918 or 883. The index
patient or family member can have clinical manifestation of MTC,
pheochromocytoma, and other features associated with MEN2B such as
marfanoid habitus, ganglioneuromas, intestinal ganglioneuromatosis.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
MEN1
The diagnostic tests are the same as sporadic counterparts. Laboratory tests are
directed to gain evidence for hyperparathyroidism (PTH, total and ionized
calcium), pituitary tumors (prolactin, ACTH, GH, and its glucose suppression
tests, alpha subunit, TSH), insulinoma(Glucose, Insulin, C-peptide, Betahydroxybutyrate, Proinsulin, Sulfonylurea, and meglitinide screen),
glucagonoma (CBC, a normochromic, normocytic anemia is common;
hypoaminoacidemia), gastrinoma, carcinoid tumors.
DNA testing in diagnosis or screening MEN1 is still very controversial.
476

MEN2
Biochemical tests are not required for diagnosis of MEN2, but maybe useful
for disease follow-up and diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism and
pheochromocytoma. Most useful tests are calcitonin, CEA, calcium. The
plasma free metanephrines and normetanephrines, or 24-hour urine
metanephrines and normetanephrines are useful tests in diagnosis and follow-up
for pheochromogyctoma. PTH can be obtained if hyperparathyroidism is
suspected.
Once an index case is identified (any patient with MTC), the individual should
be referred for genetic counseling. The counseling should include, but is not
limited to, the scope and severity of the disease, responsibility of the competent
patient or guardian to inform family members for testing, and option of prenatal
or preimplantation diagnostic testing if patient in childbearing age.
Most laboratories screen for the five most commonly mutated codons in exons
10 and 11 (C634R, C609, C611, C618, and C620) for MEN2A, and codons
918 and 883 for MEN2B. If the initial analysis is negative, then the remaining
exons can be sequenced.9
To find a laboratory that provides specific needs for your patient, go to
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GeneTests/lab?db=GeneTests. Only if the
patient tests positive for a mutation in one of these exons should RET molecular
genetic analysis be extended to the patient’s first-degree relatives (parents and
children). If either parent tests positive, all the at-risk family members should
be tested for that mutation.
The main indications for molecular genetic testing include
Confirmation of diagnosis of MEN2A, FMTC, and MEN2B
Presymptomatic screening of family members at risk
Identification of germline mutations to distinguish sporadic from familial
MTC
Given a relatively low false-negative rate (2% to 5%), if an individual tests
negative for the RET mutation, he or she is not likely to be at risk for
development of the MEN2 syndrome. In such cases, the patient could have a
sporadic MTC or pheochromocytoma.
Less likely is the possibility of a highly unusual or new RET mutation. Although
entirely replaced by RET mutation analysis for carrier diagnosis, the calcitonin
test can be used in such situations in which the MEN2 carrier ascertainment
with DNA testing is not helpful or no RET mutation is detected.
It is important to note that RET genetic testing does not obviate the need for
477

biochemical studies to detect pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism in
MEN2 patients. In addition, RET genetic testing before symptoms develop
cannot identify spontaneous mutations that have not yet occurred.
Imaging
MEN1
Neck ultrasonography should be done in primary hyperparathyroidism. It has
been reported to have a sensitivity of 72% to 89% in detecting solitary
adenomas.
99mTc-sestamibi scan. The sensitivity is similar to ultrasound and is reported
to be 68% to 95% in detecting single adenomas. An advantage of scintigraphy
is that it can detect ectopic glands outside the neck. Therefore, some favor a
combined approach to preoperative evaluation, which has been shown to more
accurately predict solitary adenomas than either approach alone.
Pituitary MRI and computed tomography (CT) should be done if pituitary
tumor is suggested. MRI is the single most specific and sensitive imaging
technique in diagnosing pituitary mass.
Somatostatin receptor imaging with 111-Indium-penetreotide (Octreoscan) and
SPECT has a higher sensitivity than all other imaging modalities in localizing
enteropancreatic tumors and is particularly useful in identifying liver and bone
metastases.
Endoscopic ultrasound is especially valuable in imaging small pancreatic
endocrine tumors.
MEN2
Neck ultrasonography by a skilled neck ultrasonographer is mandatory to
visualize superior mediastinum and central and bilateral lateral neck
compartments in MEN2 patients or suspecting MTC.
Chest CT, neck CT, three-phase contrast-enhanced multidector liver CT,
or contrast-enhanced MRI is indicated if metastatic MTC is suspected.
Abdominal or adrenal CT or MRI is required in localized pheochromocytoma.
Pheochromocytoma is most present on adrenal glands.
Other imaging options used in localizing pheochromocytoma are 123-Imetaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and 111-In-pentetreotide
scintigraphy (Octreoscan). For details, please refer to Chapter 15.
Diagnostic Procedures
MEN1
478

The diagnosis and follow-up of MEN1 components are mainly based on
biochemical laboratory tests and imaging.
Endoscopic biopsy might be useful in diagnosing certain enteropancreatic
tumors. Skin biopsy may be helpful in diagnosing cutaneous tumors associated
with MEN1, such as angiofibromas and collagenomas.
MEN2
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is safe for the diagnosis of MTC and suspected
lymph node metastasis.
Several studies have suggested that measurement of calcitonin in the FNA
washout fluid from suspected local recurrences and lymph node metastases may
have higher sensitivity and specificity.
Skin biopsy may be useful in establishing the diagnosis of ganglioneuromas in
MEN2B and CLA in MEN2A.
Rectal biopsy or endoscopic intestinal biopsy may be useful in establishing the
diagnosis of ganglioneuromatosis.

TREATMENT
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 1
Patients with MEN1 are not treated until there is clinical or biochemical evidence
of a characteristic disease because there is no genotype–phenotype correlation,
and, consequently, there is no rationale for prophylactic intervention in an attempt
to prevent the disease. However, a patient with a known MEN1 mutation should
be followed closely for evidence of the tumors that are characteristically
associated with this syndrome.
Hyperparathyroidism
The principle and modality in treating MEN1-associated hyperparathyroidism is
similar to sporadic hyperthyroidism. For details, please see Chapter 22.
Parathyroid tumors. The most common surgical approach is either a four-gland
parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation, or a 3.5-gland parathyroidectomy.
Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is not recommended, as the
hyperparathyroidism in MEN1 patients is invariably due to hyperplasia of all
four glands.
A decrease in PTH >50% from baseline indicates adequate resection of
parathyroid tissue. There is a high incidence of recurrence. In one series, 10
years after parathyroidectomy, 50% of the MEN1 patients had recurrent
hyperparathyroidism.
479

Because calcimimetics have proved effective in the treatment of patients with
hypercalcemia from other causes, they also have a role in treating persistent or
recurrent hypercalcemia following surgery in MEN1 patients.11
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome
Proton pump inhibitors are the treatment of choice to effectively control
hypergastrinemia, but they are administered at double the usual dose (e.g.,
omeprazole 40 mg orally daily; pantoprazole 80 mg orally daily).
The role of surgery in management of gastrinoma in MEN1 is still controversial.
It is usually reserved for patients who (a) are refractory to or intolerant of
medical therapy, (b) have gastrinomas >2 cm, (c) are at increased risk of
metastasis (family history), and (d) are free of liver metastasis. Outcomes of
surgery are also relatively poor in MEN1 patients (only 16% disease-free
survival), compared to those with sporadic gastrinomas (45% disease-free
survival).
Patients with persistent or recurrent gastrinomas after surgery could undergo
repeat surgery or medical therapy with five-fluorouracil, octreotide, or
interferon.
For patients with hepatic metastases, surgical debulking and/or hepatic artery
chemoembolization may be employed. Chemotherapy with streptozotocin and
doxorubicin can also be considered for patients with metastatic gastrinomas.
However, observation is often preferable due to the indolent behavior of the
metastases in many patients and the relative lack of efficacy of these agents.
Nonfunctioning pancreaticoduodenal tumors
How and when to have surgery is still very controversial. Most expert advocate
surgery to cure or to prevent malignancy transformation and metastasis. If the tumor
is >1 cm by imaging, surgery is generally offered. The generally applied operative
procedure has consisted of enucleation of tumors in the pancreatic head and
concomitant distal 80% subtotal pancreatic resection.12
Insulinoma
Surgery is the treatment of choice for insulinoma and is usually curative. For
other islet cell tumors, surgery is still a first-line indication, since medical
therapy alone is unsatisfactory.
Tumor recurrence is treated symptomatically with agents such as octreotide.
Other functional tumors, VIPoma, glucagonoma, and somatostatinoma.
These tumors are very rare, but have a high risk of malignancy. When clinically
evident, 30% to 50% patients have metastatic lesions already.
Radical surgery is generally offered. For liver metastases, liver resection, or
480

radio​frequency ablation should be considered to alleviate severe hormonal
symptoms.13
Intrathoracic neoplasia
Benign and malignant intrathoracic neuroendocrine tumors occur in approximately
5% of MEN1 patients. Malignant thymic carcinoid present at an advance stage and
are incurable. Prophylactic thymectomy at the time of parathyroidectomy is not
totally preventive.14
Pituitary and other tumors
The treatment for MEN1 patients with these tumors, as well as those with carcinoid
or adrenocortical tumors, is similar to that for patients who develop these tumors
sporadically. After medical or surgical treatment, patients should be followed for
recurrence or persistent disease, as is usually done.

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2
Medullary thyroid carcinoma
The decision to perform prophylactic thyroidectomy in MEN2 patients should
be based on the results of RET mutation testing, rather than on biochemical
(calcitonin) testing. This recommendation is derived from the fact that there is
not only a clear relationship between the particular RET codon mutation and
aggressiveness of the MTC, but that early detection and intervention can
significantly alter the clinical course of MTC. Therefore, the timing of
prophylactic thyroidectomy is dependent on the risk-group stratification based
on the RET codon mutation.
In patients >5 years old with MEN2A or FMTC with thyroid nodules <5 mm on
neck ultrasound and serum calcitonin <40 pg/mL, a total thyroidectomy without
prophylactic lymph node dissection is recommended.9
In MEN2B patients >1 year with thyroid nodules <5 mm on ultrasound and
serum calcitonin level <40 pg/mL, a total thyroidectomy with a prophylactic
central neck dissection without lateral compartment neck dissection is
recommended.
For clinically apparent diseases, the preoperative evaluation should include
basal calcitonin, CEA, and calcium (albumin corrected or ionized) and RET
proto-oncogene mutation analysis. Preoperative screening for
pheochromocytoma should begin by age 8 for MEN2B and mutated RET codon
of 634 and 630, and by age 20 for other RET mutations.9
For patients with local lymph node metastases, or calcitonin >400 pg/dL, further
imaging tests such as preoperative chest CT, neck CT, and three-phase contrast481

enhanced multidetector liver CT or contrast-enhanced MRI can be considered.
For limited local metastatic disease to regional lymph nodes in the central
compartment, a total thyroidectomy coupled with level VI compartmental
dissection is appropriate.
For presence of extended metastatic disease, less aggressive neck surgery may
be appropriate to preserve speech, swallowing, and parathyroid function while
maintaining regional disease control to prevent central neck morbidity. These
patients should be referred to a well-designed clinical trial.
After thyroidectomy, patients are followed with serial calcitonin measurements,
as it is often the first index of persistent or recurrent MTC. Local disease can
be surgically resected, whereas widespread metastases are difficult to cure
since conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy is not very effective.15
Pheochromocytoma
Treatment of pheochromocytoma in MEN2 is similar to that in sporadic cases (see
Chapter 15). If a pheochromocytoma is detected at the same time as MTC,
adrenalectomy should be performed before thyroidectomy with appropriate
adrenergic blockade to avoid intraoperative catecholamine crisis. Laparoscopic
adrenalectomy is the recommended surgical approach.
Hyperparathyroidism
Those at risk for hyperparathyroidism (with mutations in codons 611, 618, 620,
and 634) should be screened annually with ionized calcium and intact PTH,
starting at age 15.
Hyperparathyroidism is managed with subtotal parathyroidectomy or total
parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation. If parathyroid hyperplasia is found
at the time of thyroidectomy, this should be considered as hyperparathyroidism
even in the absence of biochemical evidence of disease.15

PATIENT EDUCATION
Counseling of patients and family members is an important part of disease
management. A genetic counseling referral should be obtained. Useful websites

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 1
Once an index case of MEN1 is identified, genetic counseling and testing should
482

be considered but not absolutely required for all family members. The age to start
screening is still controversial. Direct DNA analysis for mutations in the MEN1
gene identifies patients who have inherited a mutated allele and are destined to
develop MEN1.14
Once an individual is identified as high risk for MEN1 (positive gene test or
family history), periodic biochemical screening to detect symptoms related to
hormone excess associated with the tumors characteristic of MEN1 should be
carried out. However, as mentioned previously, because of a lack of genotype–
phenotype correlation, prophylactic treatments have no beneficial role in patients
with MEN1.
On the basis of current consensus guidelines, a proposed screening scheme for
tumor expression in a carrier of MEN1 mutation is as follows16,17:
Hyperparathyroidism. Serum ionized calcium and PTH annually, starting at age
8. A neck ultrasonography or sestamibi scan should be considered if
biochemical tests are positive.
For patients diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism with or without surgery
management, measurement of calcium (albumin corrected total calcium or
ionized calcium) and creatinine annually may be sufficient. Bone density at
vertebra, hip, and forearm every 1 or 2 years is recommended.
Enteropancreatic tumors. Fasting gastrin and secretin-stimulated gastrin
annually starting at age 20. An octreotide scan should be considered if
biochemical tests are positive.
Insulinoma. Fasting glucose with or without insulin annually, starting at age 5 to
20. Selective measurement of pancreas vein insulin during arterial calcium
infusion may also be considered based on the clinical picture.
Glucagonoma. Chromogranin A and glucagon annually, starting at age 20 for
other enteropancreatic tumors as indicated, followed up with octreotide scan,
CT, or MRI if biochemical tests are positive.
Pituitary tumors. Prolactin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) annually
starting at age 5. MRI if biochemical tests are positive.
Imaging studies to detect or follow enteropancreatic tumors should be
performed every 1 to 3 years depending on the risk and rate of
growth.CT/MRI or endoscopic ultrasound are the usual imaging modalities.5

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2
Medullary thyroid carcinoma
A key issue is to distinguish individuals who have MEN2 from those with
483

sporadic MTC. This is particularly relevant for individuals who present with
multifocal MTC with a negative family history. Because MTC is the first
clinical manifestation and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in
patients with MEN2A, MEN2B, and FMTC, total thyroidectomy with regional
lymphadenectomy is the treatment of choice for MTC whether patients have
hereditary or sporadic disease.18,19
All patients thought to have sporadic MTC should undergo RET mutation
analysis as ~40% to 50% of putative sporadic cases have been shown to harbor
germline RET mutations.
For patients with RET mutation who elect to wait for prophylaxis
thyroidectomy, calcitonin, neck ultrasonography should be obtained every 6 to
12 months.
For patients who achieve a complete biochemical cure, long-term biochemical
monitoring of annual measurement of serum calcitonin is required.
For patients with detectable basal serum calcitonin levels postoperatively,
basal calcitonin and CEA levels should be obtained approximately every 6
months to determine their doubling time (DT). Ongoing follow-up of these
tumor markers and physical examination should occur at one-fourth the shortest
DT or annually, whichever is more frequent. The timing of follow-up anatomic
imaging may be based on the relative stability of these tests, presence or
absence of symptoms, and the location of known or likely sites of metastasis.
For patients in a family that meets clinical criteria for MEN 2A or 2B, or FMTC
but no RET gene mutation has been found, periodically screening for MTC
(neck US, calcitonin measurement) and associated primary
hyperparathyroidism (albumin-corrected calcium or ionized calcium) and
pheochromocytoma (plasma free metanephrines and normetanephrines, or 24hour urine metanephrines and normetanephrines) should be done as indicated
by the family phenotype. Screening should continue at 1- to 3-year intervals at
least until age 50 or 20 years beyond the oldest age of initial diagnosis in the
family, whichever is latest.
Pheochromocytoma
Screening for pheochromocytoma with annual plasma and/or urinary
fractionated metanephrine measurements is done in all MEN2 patients. The age
at which to begin the screening also depends on specific codon mutations.
Screening should start between age 5 and 8 in families with high-risk mutations
(codons 611, 618, 634, and 918), and between age 10 and 15 in those with
mutations in less high-risk codons (codon 768). An abnormal biochemical test
should be followed by CT or MRI to localize tumors. Some advocate routine
484

imaging every 3 to 5 years, even in the presence of normal biochemical tests.
Women with a RET mutation associated with MEN 2 who are pregnant or
planning to become pregnant should be screened biochemically for
pheochromocytoma.
For patients status-post pheochromocytoma resection, biochemical testing
should be obtained 4 to 6 weeks postsurgery, then yearly if blood pressure is
under control. If bilateral adrenalectomy has been done, the screening interval
can be lengthened since extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma in MEN syndrome is
very rare.
Approximately one-fourth of patients with no known family history of
pheochromocytoma may have an inherited disease caused by a mutation other
than RET, including mutations in the genes for von Hippel–Lindau (VHL),
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and genes encoding the B and D subunits of
mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB and SDHD). Therefore, any
patient with presumably sporadic pheochromocytoma in the following clinical
settings should be screened for mutations in these genes using a stepwise
approach:
Bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma without MTC: First screen for
mutations in VHL; if negative, then screen for mutations in RET.
Age <20 with sporadic unilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma: First screen
for mutations in VHL; if negative, then screen for mutations in RET; if
negative, then screen for mutations in SDHB.
Age >20 with sporadic unilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma: First screen
for mutations in SDHB; if negative, then screen for mutations in SDHD.
Hyperparathyroidism
The screening and follow-up is as in MEN1. Hyperparathyroidism is absent in
MEN2B patients.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 1
The mortality of MEN1 is not well documented. Pancreatic malignancy and
malignant thymic carcinoids are the principal causes of disease-related death in
MEN1.20 Our institution reported that nearly half of patients (46%) died of causes
related to MEN1 at a mean age of 50. The most common causes of mortality are
malignant islet cell tumors (24%) at average age of 46, followed by malignant
carcinoid (10%) at age 53 and ulcer disease (10%) at age 56.20 A report from
485

Mayo Clinic showed 28% patients died of MEN1-related causes, the most
common being metastatic islet malignancy (58.8%). The overall 20-year survival
of MEN1 patients was 64%, compared to 81% for age- and gender-matched
controls.21
Rarely patients died of hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid malignancy is very rare
but is reported.22 The major problem with hyperparathyroidism is postsurgical
recurrence. The recurrence rate for subtotal parathyroidectomy or total
parathyroidectomy in MEN1 is as high as 55% in 10 years.23
Malignant insulinoma is the major cause of disease-related death. Malignancy rate
is higher with MEN1-associated insulinoma compared to sporadic insulinoma. At
diagnosis, more than 50% of patients were found to have metastatic disease.
Gastrinoma also has high tendency for malignancy in MEN1. The cure rate by
surgery is very low (0% to 10%). The majority (50% to 70%) of patients with
tumor >2 cm on imaging had lymph node involvement. However, these patients
have excellent long-term survival rate without surgery, and even with apparent
metastatic disease they have a 15-year survival of 52%.24
Nonfunctioning pancreatic tumor is currently the most common entity requiring
surgery.25 Nonfunctioning tumors account for 35% to 55% of all pancreatic
endocrine tumors and most commonly present in the fourth or fifth decade of life.
Approximately two-thirds of nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors are
malignant.

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2
Eventually all patients develop medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is the major
cause of MEN2-related death. Using a prior TNM classification system, 10-year
survival rates for stages I, II, III, and IV are 100%, 93%, 71%, and 21%,
respectively.26
Prophylactic thyroidectomy can potentially cure individuals who test positive for
the RET mutation.
Medullary thyroid carcinoma in patients with MEN2B is more aggressive than in
MEN2A or FMTC, and surgery is often not curative. 9 In one large study, death
from MTC occurred in 50% of those with MEN2B but only 9.7% of those with
MEN2A.27
Pheochromocytoma occurs in approximately 40% of patients with MEN2A and
probably a similar percentage in MEN2B. Malignant cases are very rare. No
cases of death secondary to catecholamine crisis have been reported.28
Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs in 10% to 25% of patients with MEN2A and
486

is almost always multiglandular. In expert parathyroid surgical centers, the
recurrence rate after apparently successful subtotal parathyroidectomy is very
low.29

Carcinoid Syndrome
Judit Dunai and Thomas J. Baranski
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Carcinoid syndrome refers to the cluster of symptoms mediated by the systemic
release of vasoactive compounds and hormones produced by carcinoid
tumors.
Carcinoid tumors are rare, slow-growing neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), arising
from enterochromaffin cells. They have been reported in a wide range of organs,
but most commonly involve the gastrointestinal and bronchopulmonary tracts.1–3
Carcinoid tumors contain neurosecretory granules that synthesize, store, and
release substances, such as serotonin, histamine, prostaglandin, kallikrein,
bradykinin, substance P, gastrin, corticotropin as well as many others. 3,4 The most
prominent of these substances is serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), the degradation
of which results in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is excreted in the
urine.
The liver inactivates the bioactive products of carcinoid tumors and hence the
carcinoid syndrome is not seen in most cases until hepatic metastases has
occurred.1
Most carcinoid tumors are discovered incidentally. Carcinoid tumors commonly
present with nonspecific findings due to local mass effect and their diagnosis is
challenging. The classic carcinoid syndrome (flushing, diarrhea, wheezing,
right-sided heart disease) is only seen in about 10% of the cases.
Most carcinoid tumors have metastasized at the time of presentation. Therefore,
management requires a multidisciplinary approach that focuses on symptom
management and surgical removal of tumor burden.
Although originally named for their presumed indolent nature as “carcinoid”,
meaning carcinoma-like, these tumors are no longer thought to be benign.
Patients with NETs have an increased incidence of synchronous nonendocrine
malignancy.2

490

Epidemiology
The overall prevalence of carcinoid tumors in the United States is estimated to be
1 to 2 cases per 100,000 persons. However, considering their indolent nature, the
true incidence and prevalence is difficult to assess and it is likely to be higher.
According to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database,
the incidence of these tumors has increased over the last 30 years. Whether this is
a reflection of advanced imaging techniques and better reporting or a true increase
is unclear.4
Risk factors include female sex, African American ancestry, smoking and family
history of MEN1 or neurofibromatosis.2

Historical Aspects
The term karzinoide was first introduced by Oberndorffer in 1907 to describe
intestinal tumors that histologically resembled carcinomas but did not behave in
their aggressive manner. Recognition of the endocrine-related properties of these
tumors occurred several years later.
In 1948, Rapport isolated serotonin and, a year later, Lembeck confirmed that this
substance was responsible for carcinoid syndrome in a patient with ileal
carcinoid tumor.

CLASSIFICATION
Historically, carcinoid tumors were classified according to their embryologic site
of origin into carcinoids of the foregut (15%; bronchi, stomach, thymus and
duodenum), midgut (75%; small intestine, appendix, proximal large bowel), and
hindgut (15%; distal colon, rectum). This classification emphasized the
clinicopathologic differences between tumors of various locations, but has proven
to be too imprecise in predicting the tumor’s behavior and prognosis and is no
longer used.
In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) presented new classifications
based on site of origin and differentiation.4 This classification is clinically and
prognostically more useful, providing information about tumor behavior and
therapeutic consequences.
Well-differentiated endocrine tumor—Ki67 < 2% (a proliferation grade),
absent cytologic atypia, and angioinvasion
Well-differentiated endocrine carcinoma—Ki67 > 2%, evidence of
lymphovascular invasion, presence of metastasis
Poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma—Ki67 > 15%, cellular atypia,
491

necrosis
Mixed exocrine—endocrine tumors and tumor-like lesions—previously termed
adenocarcinoid.
More than 55% of carcinoid tumors are located in the gastrointestinal tract and
~30% are in the bronchopulmonary system.
Within the gastrointestinal tract, carcinoids of the small intestine (ileum) are the
most common (45%), followed by tumors of the rectum (20%), appendix (17%),
colon (11%), and stomach (7%).1

Histology
“Typical” carcinoids have a characteristic histologic appearance of monotonous
sheets of small round cells with uniform nuclei and cytoplasm without
pleomorphism or mitoses. “Atypical” carcinoids have features associated with
more aggressive behavior, such as greater nuclear atypia, higher mitotic rates,
and/or necrosis.5
On electron microscopy, the cells in most tumors have membrane bound secretory
granules which contain a variety of biogenic amines and hormones characteristic
of NETs.1
They are positive for immunohistochemical staining for one or more
neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin A and synaptophysin; this
confirms the diagnosis.1
The proliferation potential is evaluated with staining for the proliferation marker
Ki67 which is expressed as a percentage.

Pathology
Molecular Pathogenesis
The molecular pathogenesis of carcinoid tumors is incompletely understood.
Most gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoids are sporadic and may exhibit a loss of
heterozygosity of chromosome 18.4
Sporadic foregut carcinoids, as well as those associated with multiple endocrine
neoplasia 1 (MEN1) (primary hypergastrinemia [Zollinger–Ellison syndrome]),
display allelic losses at chromosome 11q13. 2,6 Somatic MEN1 gene mutations
have also been reported in one-third of sporadic foregut tumors.
Duodenal carcinoid tumors (localized in or close to the ampulla of Vater) produce
somatostatin and are associated with neurofibromatosis-1. The NF1 gene is
located on chromosome 17q11.2.2
492

For midgut carcinoids, the major areas of chromosomal loss are 18q (54%), 9p
(15%), 11q (13%), and 16q (12%).
Bronchial carcinoids are associated with mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor
gene and abnormal expression of proteins involved in apoptosis, including Bcl-2
and Bax.
The expression of various growth factors (basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular
endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor α and β, trefoil peptides,
and platelet-derived growth factor) and some of their receptors has also been
reported in carcinoid tumors.
Biochemistry
Midgut carcinoids contain the enzyme dopa decarboxylase, which converts 5hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) into serotonin (5-HT).7
Foregut and hindgut carcinoids lack dopa decarboxylase and cannot synthesize
serotonin. Foregut carcinoids often secrete histamine, while hindgut tumors tend to
be hormonally silent.
Serotonin is largely responsible for the classic symptoms of carcinoid
syndrome, including diarrhea, bronchospasm. The cause of flushing is
uncertain, but has been attributed to prostaglandins, kinins and serotonin.8

DIAGNOSIS
Symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome vary in intensity and timing and are usually
vague, nonspecific, and organ-related, causing relatively long delays in diagnosis.
The average time from symptom onset to diagnosis is more than 9 years.
The differential diagnosis for carcinoid syndrome is listed in Table 35-1.
Many carcinoid tumors are found incidentally during surgery for other reasons,
usually at appendectomy (1 of 300 appendectomies) or surgery for acute
pancreatitis, or surgery for bowel obstruction or diseases of the female
reproductive tract.
Small bowel carcinoids commonly metastasize to mesenteric lymph nodes, causing
fibrosis, and contraction of the mesentery, which in turn leads to kinking of the
bowel resulting in intermittent bowel obstruction. Also mesenteric vessels can
become occluded leading to intermittent ischemia, causing abdominal pain,
nausea, and vomiting.1
Occasionally, a carcinoid tumor can be the lead point for an intermittent intestinal
intussusception.
The lungs and liver metabolize many of the substances secreted by carcinoid
493

tumors, thereby preventing their release into the systemic circulation until
metastases develop. This may explain why patients who have carcinoid tumors
typically have the syndrome only if they have hepatic metastases. However,
extraintestinal carcinoids can cause carcinoid syndrome in the absence of hepatic
metastasis.4
TABLE 35-1 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CARCINOID SYNDROME

Carcinoid syndrome occurs in only 10% of all patients with carcinoid tumor, and
it is most often associated with midgut tumors, whereas bronchial and other
extraintestinal carcinoids rarely cause the syndrome.

Signs and Symptoms
Flushing is usually dry without diaphoresis and occurs in 85% of patients with
carcinoid syndrome, usually of faint pink to red color and involves the face and
upper trunk down to the nipples.
Flushing is initially provoked by alcohol and food containing tyramines (blue
cheese, chocolate, red wine). With time, flushing may occur spontaneously.
It typically lasts for 1 to 5 minutes and may occur many times per day.
Flushing associated with foregut tumors is more intense, lasts for hours, is
494

frequently followed by telangiectasias, and involves the upper trunk and the
limbs.
Diarrhea is usually secretory (watery, nonbloody) and persists with fasting.
Stools may vary from a few to >30/day and can be explosive. If accompanied by
severe abdominal cramping, diarrhea could be due to mesenteric fibrosis.
Diarrhea is usually not temporally related to flushing episodes.
Bronchospasm—Among all, 10% to 20% of patients with carcinoid syndrome
have wheezing and dyspnea, often during flushing episodes.
Carcinoid heart disease—carcinoid heart disease can be seen in 60% to 70% of
patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors.
It is characterized by fibrous thickening of the endocardium, valve leaflets,
atria, and ventricles.
Valvular heart disease is the most common pathologic feature, with tricuspid
valve regurgitation and pulmonary valve stenosis seen in 97% and 88% of
patients, respectively.
Clinical manifestations are those of right-sided valvular heart disease and
include peripheral edema, ascites, and pulsatile hepatomegaly.
Carcinoid crisis—carcinoid crisis is a life-threatening form of carcinoid syndrome
that is triggered by specific events such as anesthesia, surgery, or chemotherapy,
which presumably stimulates the release of an overwhelming amount of
vasoactive compounds.
Symptoms include flushing with extreme changes in blood pressure, and may
also include arrhythmias, bronchospasm, and altered mental status.
Other manifestations—pellagra dermatisis (hyperkeratosis and pigmentation),
Peyronie’s disease of the penis, occlusion of the mesenteric arteries and veins,
and intraabdominal/retroperitoneal fibrosis leading to intestinal and/or urethral
obstruction may also be present.
Rarely, carcinoid tumors of foregut or of hindgut origin can cause bone metastases.
These tumors can secrete corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) resulting in ectopic Cushing’s syndrome, or
growth hormone resulting in acromegaly.

Biochemical Testing
Given the various other conditions apart from the carcinoid syndrome that result in
diarrhea or flushing, one must verify that the presenting symptoms are due to an
actively secreting carcinoid tumor.
495

The most useful initial screening test for carcinoid syndrome is a measure of 24hour urinary excretion of 5-HIAA. The 5-HT released by functional tumors is
metabolized by monoamine oxidase to 5-HIAA, which can be measured in the
urine. This test has a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of nearly 100%.1
The low sensitivity is not surprising, given that many carcinoid tumors, do not
secrete 5-HT. The normal range of 5-HIAA excretion is <6 mg/day.
Most patients with the carcinoid syndrome have urinary 5-HIAA levels
>100 mg/day; in one study the range was from 99 to 2070 mg/day.9 However,
in other patients with the carcinoid syndrome, only modest elevations (up to 30
mg/day) are seen, comparable to that observed in patients with celiac sprue,
Whipple’s disease, or after the ingestion of high tryptophan-containing foods.
Before ordering the measurement of urinary 5-HIAA, it is critical to note factors
that can lead to false-positive test results (Table 35-2).
5-HIAA levels appear to correlate well with tumor mass, and can be used as a
marker for the extent of disease and to follow response to treatment.
Although urinary 5-HIAA excretion is useful in patients with midgut carcinoid
tumors, this test may not be useful in patients with suspected foregut carcinoids
that lack the enzyme needed to convert 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HPT) to 5-HT. 5
Consequently, foregut carcinoids will have high levels of 5-HPT. This metabolite,
however, cannot be accurately measured in clinical laboratories within the United
States currently, and, therefore, other studies need to be performed to directly
localize the tumor.
Another commonly used biomarker is chromogranin A (CgA) . It is a glycoprotein
secreted by NETs along with other hormones. Unlike 5-HIAA, plasma CgA
testing does not rely on serotonin secretion and can detect nonsecreting tumors.10
It is a sensitive marker of carcinoid tumors but has poor specificity.
TABLE 35-2 SOURCES OF ERROR IN URINARY 5-HIAA TESTING

496

False-positive results may be seen in renal and liver failure, inflammatory
bowel disease, physical stress and trauma, and hypergastrinemia caused by
achlorhydria (e.g., chronic use of proton pump inhibitors, atrophic gastritis,
or retained gastric antrum).
A false-positive rate of 40% is also seen in patients with multiple myeloma.
Due to its poor specificity and possibility of false-positive results, CgA
measurements are not generally used for the diagnosis of the carcinoid
syndrome. Nevertheless, it is a good marker of tumor progression and can be
used to monitor treatment. An increased CgA level has been shown to be an
independent predictor of poor overall survival and correlates with tumor
burden (except in gastrinoma).
According to recent reports, whole blood serotonin concentration can be used
when urinary 5-HIAA yields equivocal results, although the specificity of this test
is undetermined. In addition, several factors can affect total blood serotonin
levels. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) reduce blood serotonin
concentrations,
whereas
paragangliomas,
such
as
extra-adrenal
pheochromocytomas, can increase serotonin levels.
If the preceding biochemical tests are normal or only marginally elevated in a
patient who describes obvious flushing and other features of the carcinoid
syndrome, provocative testing with epinephrine (starting at 2 mcg intravenous
boluses up to a maximum of 10 mcg) or intravenous pentagastrin (0.06 mg/kg
body weight) might be considered, both of which have nearly 100% sensitivity.11
The test is considered positive if the patient has flushing, hypotension, and
tachycardia that appear between 45 and 120 seconds after an injection and lasts
for at least 1 minute. The test is stopped after the first positive response.
The advantage of the pentagastrin provocation test over the epinephrine test is
that it induces flushing in patients with either foregut or midgut tumors.12

Imaging
Once the biochemical diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome is confirmed, the tumor
must be localized. Using a combination of imaging modalities is often the most
helpful.1
Abdominal CT scanning is the diagnostic procedure of choice for tumor
staging, as it identifies the primary tumor and mesenteric lymph node
enlargement.
Triphasic CT of the liver should be considered because the liver is the most
common site for metastasis.
497

Carcinoids that have infiltrated have a characteristic CT appearance that is
spiculated with a stellate pattern.
The combination of single photon emission CT (SPECT) and CT allows hybrid
imaging and has 100% sensitivity compared to 80% sensitivity with CT alone.4
The presence of somatostatin receptors in carcinoid tumors has allowed the use of
indium-111 octreotide scintigraphy for tumor imaging. This test has >90%
sensitivity in patients with carcinoid syndrome and 80% to 90% sensitivity in
asymptomatic patients.
Specificity is lower because scintigraphy is positive in many other tumors,
granulomas, and autoimmune diseases. Also, a smaller number (approximately
60%) of atypical carcinoids express somatostatin receptors. Therefore,
abdominal CT and scintigraphy have complementary roles in localization
procedures, with the added advantage of octreoscan in predicting responses to
octreotide therapy.1
Other modalities such as MRI (sensitive for detecting extrahepatic disease),
endoscopic ultrasound/intraoperative ultrasound, and video capsule endoscopy
are usually reserved for those patients with suspected carcinoid tumors that have
not been localized by CT or the octreoscan.
Chest CT scan can be used to localize bronchial carcinoid tumors, and
echocardiography can help in establishing the severity of carcinoid heart disease.
Imaging by PET is not routinely recommended, but as neuroendocrine markers
become available, it has the potential to become a highly sensitive technique.13

TREATMENT
The key management issues in patients with carcinoid tumors include symptom
control, biochemical control (lowering or normalizing 5-HIAA levels), objective
tumor control, and improvement of quality of life.

Surgical Management
Surgery plays an important role in the management of patients with small bowel
carcinoids even for those with metastatic disease.4,14
Resection of the primary tumor and nodal metastasis can help relieve symptoms of
gastrointestinal obstruction and ischemia.13
For appendiceal carcinoid tumors, size has been shown to be the best predictor of
prognosis.1
According to current guidelines tumors <1 cm can be treated with appendectomy
alone.
498

Tumors larger than 2 cm or those with lymphatic invasion, high proliferative
index, and positive tumor margins require right hemicolectomy.15
Management of tumors between 1 and 2 cm is controversial. More aggressive
management is usually employed for the young and for those with
mesoappendiceal involvement.
Carcinoid tumors of the small intestine can metastasize irrespective of size.
They are generally removed by small bowel resection with removal of involved
mesentery and mesenteric lymph nodes.
Resection of the primary tumor should be accompanied by careful evaluation for
synchronous tumors or metastasis, which is seen in up to 40% of patients with
midgut carcinoids.13
Radical excision of the rectum is recommended for rectal carcinoids and radical
colectomy for colonic carcinoids.
Bronchial carcinoids are usually removed surgically.
Metastatic Disease
More than 90% of patients with the carcinoid syndrome have metastatic disease
(except bronchial and ovarian tumors, which may cause symptoms without
metastasis).
Potentially curative surgery can be offered to the rare patient with resectable
hepatic or isolated brain metastasis, or to patients with bronchial and ovarian
carcinoids. For others, cytoreductive resection should be considered.14,16
The goals of palliative surgery in patients with metastatic disease include
stabilization of symptoms and lowering of 5-HIAA levels. Hepatic arterial
embolization represents an alternate cytoreductive option for those who are not
surgical candidates.
Intraoperative carcinoid crisis is a rare but serious potential complication that can
be precipitated by surgery or anesthesia. Therefore, pre- and intraoperative
somatostatin analogue administration is required in patients with functional
carcinoids.13

Medical Management
Somatostatin analogues (SSA) are the mainstay of symptomatic therapy in
patients with carcinoid syndrome.17 Sandostatin and Lanreotide have
demonstrated symptomatic relief in 50% to 70% of patients and biochemical
response in 40% to 60% of patients.1
A depot form of octreotide LAR can be administered more conveniently on a
499

monthly basis. Studies have shown equal efficacy with both lanreotide SR and
octreotide.
Tachyphylaxis is commonly seen after about 12 months and can be overcome
with a higher dose or with the addition of interferon-α.
Side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea but usually
resolve within a few days.
Cholelithiasis and biliary sludge can develop as a long-term complication in up
to 50% of patients because octreotide reduces postprandial gallbladder
contractility and emptying. Prophylactic treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid
may help reduce this complication.
SSA treatment of asymptomatic patients with elevated 5-HIAA may stabilize the
progression of carcinoid heart disease.
The role of SSA in nonfunctional tumors is controversial. Recent evidence from
the placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective randomized study of the effect
of octreotide LAR in the control of tumor growth in patients with metastatic
neuroendocrine midgut tumors (PROMID) trial demonstrated evidence for
ocreotide LAR’s utility in tumor stabilization of both functional and nonfunctional
tumors.18
Cytotoxic chemotherapy (streptozocin, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil,
doxorubicin) has had limited success in the treatment of metastatic carcinoid
tumors.
Novel agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of
rapamycin have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects in patients with
advanced NETs and are under investigation.
Specific treatments for the various symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome in addition
to SSA are often helpful. Drugs such as prednisone, phenoxybenzamine, and
chlorpromazine have shown efficacy for patients with flushing and severe
diarrhea. Histamine blockers are useful for gastric carcinoids that secrete
histamine.19

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
The efficacy of various therapies may be evaluated by the magnitude of their
biochemical response (e.g., >50% reduction in urinary 5-HIAA levels) or tumor
response rate (e.g., reduction in tumor size on imaging studies).
There is limited evidence for recommendation for follow-up after resection of a
carcinoid tumor. Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
include physical examination and history with tumor markers every 6 months for 1
500

to 3 years and imaging as clinically indicated.13
Routine cardiac evaluation to detect early carcinoid heart disease might improve
prognosis.

PROGNOSIS
Carcinoid tumors are slow-growing, and even with metastases survival is
measured in terms of years rather than months.
Prognosis is based on the location, size, invasiveness, and histology of the primary
tumor.
The best 5-year survival rates are for appendiceal tumors (~71% to 100%),
similar to rectal tumors (~75% to 100%), followed by bronchopulmonary
tumors (~75%), stomach (51% to 91%), small intestine (52% to 77%), and
colon (33% to 75%).20
The presence of functional abnormalities of the tricuspid valve and the
carcinoid syndrome portends a poorer median survival.
Data from the U.S. National Carcinoid Register showed an overall median 5year survival for all patients of 82%. Median survival in patients with
localized tumors was 94%, in those with regional lymph node metastases was
64%, and in those with metastatic tumors was 0% to 27%.20

Polyendocrine Syndromes
Prajesh M. Joshi, Kavita Juneja, and Janet B. McGill
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Polyendocrinopathy is a heterogeneous group of disorders leading to destruction
or dysfunction of multiple endocrine glands and possibly involving other tissues.
The pathogenesis may be immune mediated, infiltrative, cellular destruction due
to various genetic defects or a combination of these.
The autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes (APS) are the most commonly
encountered of the polyendocrinopathies, and are characterized by loss of immune
tolerance to self-antigens leading to autoimmune destruction of endocrine glands
and other tissues.
Thomas Addison was the first to describe the clinical and pathologic features of
adrenocortical failure in patients with pernicious anemia in 1849.1 Later, Schmidt
described the occurrence of lymphocytic infiltrates of thyroid and adrenal glands
in autopsy specimens of two patients dying from Addisonian crisis (Schmidt
syndrome).2
APS (previously autoimmune polyglandular syndrome) can be classified into types
1 (APS1) and types 2–4 (APS2, APS3, APS4). Their features are summarized in
the Table 36-1.

Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome 1
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1)—also called autoimmune
polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED)—is a rare
monogenic autosomal recessive autoimmune disorder (GenomeNet classification
OMIM 240300) consisting of the classical triad of chronic mucocutaneous
candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s
disease). APECED develops in childhood and results in tissue-specific
503

autoimmunity, leading to loss of function in multiple organs.
Apart from the major clinical manifestations, primary hypogonadism, type 1
diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroid disease, lymphocytic hypophysitis, chronic
atrophic gastritis with pernicious anemia, celiac disease, alopecia, vitiligo, and
autoimmune hepatitis have also been reported in APS1. Type 1 diabetes mellitus
and autoimmune thyroid disease are seen less commonly than in other APS types.

Epidemiology
APS1 is a rare condition, most commonly prevalent in the Sardinians (1:14,000),
Finns (1:25,000), and Iranian Jews (1:9000).3
TABLE 36-1 AUTOIMMUNE POLYENDOCRINE SYNDROMES

Etiology
APS1 is caused by mutations in AIRE gene (21.q22.3), 6 which encodes the AIRE
protein, a transcription factor exclusively expressed in the medullary thymic
epithelial cells. The AIRE protein mediates the expression of peripheral tissue
antigens, a function that is required for the deletion of auto reactive T-cells and
504

the establishment of self-tolerance. Mutations in this gene presumably lead to
incomplete negative selection and escape to the periphery of self-reactive T-cells,
which in turn, initiate the destruction of self-tissues.7 Approximately 60 types of
mutations in AIRE gene have been reported thus far.8
The presence of a mutation in the AIRE gene leads to proliferation of self reactive
T-cells and formation of autoantibodies with destruction of affected organs.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
A complete and thorough history including family history is essential for the
proper evaluation and management of patients with the APSs.
Chronic infection of the skin and mucous membranes with candida albicans
usually occurs as the first major manifestation of APS1, typically presenting in
infancy. It is present in 97% of cases by 30 years of age.8
Clinical symptoms of oral candidiasis include soreness, redness, oral ulceration,
and white-gray plaques in the mouth. Esophageal inflammation causes
odynophagia and substernal pain. Involvement of intestines causes abdominal
pain, flatulence, and diarrhea. Infection of skin manifests with rash, chronic
onychomycosis of fingernails and toenails and genital discharge. Transformation
to squamous cell carcinoma has been reported when oral and esophageal
candidiasis is not strictly controlled.11
Hypoparathyroidism is the second most common major component of APS-1 and
presents with symptoms of hypocalcaemia including muscle cramps, circumoral
paraesthesia, and seizures, as well as airway obstruction when severe.
Adrenal insufficiency is typically the last major component of the syndrome to
develop and presents with symptoms of fatigue, salt craving, weight loss,
increased pigmentation of the skin, and mucous membranes and hypotension.
In some cases, these major components may be preceded by symptoms of chronic
diarrhea, keratitis, periodic rash with fever, severe constipation, autoimmune
hepatitis, alopecia, and vitiligo.11
Physical Examination
Evidence of mucocutaneous candidiasis, dental enamel hypoplasia, and nail
dystrophy are seen in APS1.
Presence of Chvostek’s and Trousseau’s signs, muscle twitching and cramping
505

suggest hypoparathyroidism.
Orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are signs of
adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency that is not diagnosed for a lengthy
period of time may lead to Nelson’s syndrome, characterized by high ACTH and
hyperpigmentation with characteristic darkening of the palmar creases.

Diagnostic Criteria
APS1: Classic diagnostic criterion consists of presence of at least two of the major
components: Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and primary
adrenocortical insufficiency. Confirmation by genetic testing is recommended.

AUTOIMMUNE POLYENDOCRINE SYNDROME 2
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 2 (APS2) is characterized by the coexistence of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency with autoimmune thyroid disease
and/or type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is more common than APS1. The components
may not be diagnosed concurrently; consequently, the entire syndrome may not be
manifest until adulthood. The presence of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency and
autoimmune thyroiditis was previously termed Schmidt’s syndrome. The
combination of type 1 diabetes mellitus with autoimmune adrenal insufficiency
and/or autoimmune thyroiditis and was called the Carpenter syndrome.12
Patients with the more common organ-specific autoimmune disorders, type 1
diabetes, and autoimmune thyroid disease commonly have co-existing
endocrinopathies without the presence of Addison’s disease. Hence, some experts
have proposed to classify them into APS types 3 and 4.13
APS type 3 includes thyroid autoimmune disease with other autoimmune diseases
excluding autoimmune adrenal insufficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and chronic
candiasis.
APS type 4 is defined as two or more organ-specific autoimmune diseases that do
not fall into either of the above types.
As in APS1, autoimmune involvement of other organs is not uncommon, and may
include primary hypogonadism, type 1 diabetes mellitus, chronic thyroiditis,
lymphocytic hypophysitis, chronic atrophic gastritis with pernicious anemia,
celiac disease, alopecia, vitiligo, and autoimmune hepatitis.
506

Epidemiology
APS2 is has an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1.4 to 2.0 per
100,000.13 This syndrome occurs in approximately half of the cases of
autoimmune Addison’s disease. 4 It is three times more common in females.
Adrenal failure is the initial endocrine abnormality in approximately half the
cases.5
APS3 and 4 are the most common, with prevalence of up to 1% of the population.

Etiology
Familial clustering of APS2 and its component disorders suggest a strong genetic
component. Pedigree analyses of most APS2 families suggest polygenic inheritance.
The association with HLA alleles in chromosome 6p21 has been recognized with
autoimmune diseases for several decades. The class II HLA haplotypes DR3 and
DR4 are strongly linked with component disorders of this syndrome. The highest risk
of development of both Addison’s disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated
with a heterozygous HLA-DR4-DQ8/HLA-DR3-DQ2 genotype.9 Potentially
complex interaction between non-HLA loci {cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4
(CTLA-4)} and the environment has also been proposed in pathogenesis of the
syndrome.

Risk Factors
Apart from genetic factors, environmental factors have been associated with
APS2. Administration of interferon-α has been associated with development of
21-hydroxylase autoantibodies, islet autoantibodies, and thyroid autoantibodies
along with their respective autoimmune diseases.10
Pregnancy is generally associated with decreased immune function; however,
postpartum thyroiditis has been observed in approximately one-third of patients
with type 1 diabetes.
Prolamins, or proteins rich in proline and glutamine that resist intestinal
peptidases, are known triggers for celiac disease. Gliadin (from wheat), and
related proteins in barley, rye, corn, and some oats are implicated in the
pathogenesis of celiac disease.
The hygiene hypothesis proposes that a decline in communicable diseases,
especially helminthic infestation, contributes to an increase in the incidence of
allergy, asthma and autoimmune diseases.19

DIAGNOSIS
507

Clinical Presentation
History
Family history and knowledge of increased risks for other endocrine disorders is
key to the diagnosis of a polyendocrinopathy syndrome.
Adrenal involvement is the initial manifestation of APS2 in half the cases. Other
components may precede the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency or follow it by
years to decades.
History of polyuria and polydipsia suggests presence of type 1 diabetes mellitus
and weight gain/weight loss, heat/cold intolerance, and constipation/hyperdefection suggests autoimmune thyroid disease.
Amenorrhea and hot flashes in a young woman should prompt a work-up for
ovarian failure, whereas decreased libido and sexual function may suggest
testicular failure in males. In both cases, gonadotropins LH and FSH will be
elevated, while estrogen and testosterone are low. Specific antibodies have not
been identified, so these diagnoses are based on physiologic diagnosis in
susceptible individuals.
Patchy depigmentation of skin, loss of hair, papulovesicular rash, unexplained
anemia, chronic diarrhea, or jaundice is typical manifestations of the secondary
associated autoimmune diseases including vitiligo, alopecia areata/totalis,
pernicious anemia, celiac disease, or autoimmune hepatitis.
Development of additional endocrine disorders may complicate the clinical
picture of the preexisting disease. For example, symptomatic hypotension or
hypoglycemia leading to a decrease in insulin dosing in a patient with type 1
diabetes may be manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. In a patient with
autoimmune hypothyroidism and APS, an increase in requirement for thyroid
hormone replacement to maintain euthyroidism may reflect malabsorption of drug
due to the onset of celiac disease.
Physical Examination
The signs of primary adrenal insufficiency include hypotension, hyponatremia, and
hyperpigmentation (see APS1 section).
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus will present with hyperglycemia, generally
developing more rapidly in younger patients but more slowly in older patients.
(See Chapter 28).
Slow relaxation phases of deep tendon reflexes and periorbital edema are signs of
hypothyroidism, while proptosis, presence of lid lag, and fine tremors suggest
hyperthyroidism (see Chapter 8 and Chapter 9)
508

Pernicious anemia (PA) may present with anemia or symptoms of peripheral
neuropathy. Undiagnosed, PA can cause profound anemia and neurologic
symptoms including cerebellar signs and ataxia.
Vitiligo and alopecia areata are less common components of all of the autoimmune
polyglandular syndromes. Vitiligo associated with these conditions is
progressive, with a nonsegmental distribution and often occurs at sites of friction
and trauma.14 Alopecia areata presents as patchy non-scarring alopecia and may
progress to total loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis) or total loss of body hair
(alopecia universalis).15
Itchy papulovesicular lesions on extensor surfaces suggest dermatitis
herpetiformis, which is associated with celiac disease.

Diagnostic Criteria
APS2: Diagnosis requires presence of autoimmune Addison’s disease with
autoimmune thyroid disorder and/or type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune adrenal
insufficiency is the defining component of this syndrome.
APS3–4: The diagnosis rests on the presence of multiple autoimmune diseases in
the same individual, diagnosed in any order and at any age.

Differential Diagnosis of Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndromes
Several genetic and acquired syndromes include multiple endocrine organ failure
or dysfunction. These polyendocrinopathy syndromes are listed in Table 36-2.
Other syndromes associated with specific autoimmune glandular dysfunction are
noted to occur in conjunction with systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid
arthritis or other collagen vascular diseases. These include Type B insulin
resistance, immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune neutropenia, and hemolytic
anemia.

Diagnostic Testing
Many of the autoimmune disorders that make up the APS have long prodromal
phases during which time tissue-specific autoantibodies appear in the serum. The
repertoire of autoantibodies present in a given individual serves as a guide to
diseases that may develop, as the risk for a given disease tends to increase as the
number and quantity of autoantibodies targeting that tissue increases. For example,
the 5-year risk of developing type 1 diabetes in first-degree relatives of affected
individuals is >50% if multiple anti-beta cell autoantibodies are present.
Laboratory Testing
509

The major laboratory approaches to the diagnosis of the APS are serologic tests
for autoantibodies against involved glands and tissues, and evaluation of endorgan function and hormone secretion.
IgG-neutralizing autoantibodies against type 1 interferons, including interferon-α
subtypes and interferon-w, virtually confirm the diagnosis of APS1 when clinical
presentation does not fulfill the classic diagnostic criterion and when thymoma
and myasthenia gravis have been excluded. Genetic testing to look for mutations in
the AIRE gene is now available. A good laboratory can detect mutations in the
AIRE gene in >95% of cases.8
Evaluation for the presence of adrenal (21-hydroxylase), thyroid (peroxidase and
thyroglobulin), islet cell (insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and IA-2A), and
parietal cell (H+/K+-ATPase) autoantibodies ( Table 36-3) may assist in
confirming clinical suspicion of tissue autoimmunity or in assessing risk for future
endocrine disorders, although serologic testing should not replace careful clinical
assessment of organ-specific diseases.
Endocrine organ function should be evaluated by laboratory measurement of
appropriate hormones: Adrenal (cosyntropin-stimulation testing, serum
electrolytes, aldosterone, and renin), thyroid (thyroid-stimulating hormone and
free thyroxine), pancreatic islet (fasting glucose or glucose tolerance testing),
parathyroid (ionized serum calcium and intact parathyroid hormone), and gonads
(estrogen or testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone).
In a patient with anemia, a low serum vitamin B12 level suggests pernicious
anemia which can be further evaluated with anti-parietal cell antibodies, antiintrinsic factor antibodies and serum gastrin level.

512

Patients with iron deficiency without a history of blood loss should be evaluated
for celiac disease with tissue transglutaminase IgA autoantibodies and total IgA
level. Endoscopy with small bowel biopsy is necessary for confirmation of celiac
disease.

513

TREATMENT
At the present time, there are no safe and effective therapies targeting the
generalized autoimmunity that underlies the pathogenesis of the APSs. Patients
with APS require close monitoring, and the clinician should maintain a high index
of suspicion for the development of additional autoimmune diseases in these
individuals.
Therapies for the individual components of the syndromes are discussed in other
chapters and the management of each disease is essentially the same for the patient
with APS. A few points deserve special consideration:
Patients with APS1 and chronic oral candidiasis should be treated aggressively
with antifungal medication (fluconazole) and closely monitored given the
elevated risk of oral cancers in these individuals. In addition, good oral
hygiene and abstinence from smoking and alcohol is helpful to prevent
candidiasis.
Thyroid hormone replacement in a patient with hypothyroidism may precipitate
life-threatening adrenal crisis if concomitant adrenal insufficiency is present. It
is wise to evaluate adrenal function by dynamic testing in patients with multiple
autoimmune endocrinopathies prior to starting levothyroxine therapy.
Pernicious anemia is treated by oral vitamin B12 in high doses or intramuscular
injections of cyanocobalamin.
Celiac disease generally responds to a gluten-free diet; however, mineral and
vitamin supplementation may be required if significant malabsorption persists.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
A high index of suspicion is required whenever one autoimmune disease is
diagnosed in order to prevent morbidity and mortality from other associated
diseases.
Follow up with a specialist, particularly an endocrinologist, is advised.
Proper psychological and social support is important for these patients.
Patients should be educated about symptoms of potential new serious components.
Patients should be provided with appropriate written instructions or should be
advised to wear medical alert bracelets in case of emergent situations.

Endocrine Disorders in HIV/AIDS
Scott Goodwin, Paul Hruz, and Kevin Yarasheski
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is transmitted by exchange of infected
blood, semen, or vaginal secretions through mucosal membranes. HIV targets
CD4+ T lymphocytes, where it integrates into the host DNA, replicates, and
produces new virions that infect and reduce T-cell numbers. This weakens host
immunity and renders the host susceptible to common pathogens.1
Currently, there is no vaccine or cure for HIV. However, since the mid-1990s the
use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced HIV-related
morbidity and mortality so effectively that HIV infection is now considered a
chronic manageable infection.1
HIV infection and HAART are associated with several endocrine, metabolic,
anthropomorphic, and cardiovascular complications.
All patients with HIV infection are at risk for endocrine disorders. Reasons
include increased inflammation (HIV replication, obesity), AIDS wasting,
presence of opportunistic infections, HAART toxicities, immune reconstitution
syndrome, genetic risk, and traditional environmental factors.2
In general, the signs and symptoms of endocrine disorders in patients with HIV
infection do not differ from those observed in immunocompetent individuals.
Please refer to the previous chapters for specific examples of presentations for
each given disorder.

DIAGNOSIS
A full health history should include: Personal or family history of cardiovascular
risk factors, autoimmune disorders, duration of HIV infection, history of viral
resistance, previous and current antiretroviral therapies, physical activity level
and current diet.
General examination of each organ system (detailed in previous chapters), and
517

query for changes in body composition and fat redistribution (peripheral
lipoatrophy, visceral lipohypertrophy, lipomas, “buffalo hump”). Lipoatrophy
(specifically loss of fat in the face and extremities) and lipohypertrophy (visceral
adiposity, dorsocervical fat pad, breast enlargement) are common. Skinfold
thickness, limb, abdomen, and chest circumference, and the waist-to-hip ratio can
quantify/document these changes. Consider visceral adiposity when: Waist-to-hip
ratio >0.90 in men and >0.80 in women; or abdominal circumference >102 cm in
men and >88 cm in women.3
In general, the diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and laboratory testing for
specific endocrine disorders in patients with HIV infection do not differ from
those observed in immunocompetent individuals. Please refer to the previous
chapters for specific examples of the diagnostic procedures for each given
disorder.

TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DISORDERS
The successful management of HIV-infected patients with or at-risk for
endocrinopathies requires an integrated approach that addresses predisposing
factors, optimal antiretroviral therapies, management of comorbidities, and selective
use of pharmacologic agents with awareness of potential drug–drug interactions.

Glucose Intolerance, Insulin Resistance, and Type 2 Diabetes
In people with HIV, disorders of glucose metabolism are multifactorial: HAART
toxicity (especially protease inhibitors), restoration of health with HAART,
immune reconstitution syndrome, family history, and body composition changes
(including lipoatrophy and visceral adiposity) are all contributing factors.1
Protease inhibitors, especially Indinavir, Lopinavir, and Ritonavir, are associated
with increased insulin resistance via blockade of the peripheral glucose
transporter GLUT4, as well as increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and
glycogenolysis.4–6
Hypoadiponectinemia is common and contributes to insulin resistance.2
Screen for abnormal glucose metabolism in HIV-infected patients as described in
Chapter 29. A fasting blood sugar measurement is simple and cost effective. Oral
glucose tolerance testing should be performed for those with risk factors for
diabetes. Monitor glycemic control before and after changes in HAART.
The mainstay of treatment in people with HIV with insulin resistance is metformin
with or without a sulfonylurea or insulin. The newer incretin class of diabetic
medications have not yet been thoroughly investigated for safety and efficacy in
518

this specific patient population.

Lipid Disorders
Fasting hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
levels are the most common lipid changes in HIV-infected patients.7
Obtain a fasting lipid profile in all HIV-infected patients. Monitor
lipid/lipoprotein levels before and after changes in HAART. If abnormalities are
not detected, annual repeat testing is adequate.7
Mild to moderate elevations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels
are also common. For markedly elevated LDL cholesterol levels, consider dietary
counseling to reduce saturated fat intake and efforts to increase physical activity.
The presence of an underlying genetic dyslipidemia should also be considered.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has issued comprehensive
guidelines for the treatment of dyslipidemia in HIV-infected persons, and
adherence to National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommendations
with the stratification of goals according to coronary heart disease (CHD) risk
categories is advisable (see Chapter 33).
Lipid-lowering agents should be specific for the type of dyslipidemia: Fibrates
and/or omega-3-fatty acids for fasting hypertriglyceridemia, HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitors for high LDL-cholesterol level. Simvastatin and lovastatin should be
avoided in patients receiving protease inhibitor-based HAART (CYP3A4
inducers and inhibitors).7

Thyroid Function
The management of HIV-infected patients diagnosed with either hyper- or hypothyroidism is similar to that for non-HIV-infected individuals (see Chapter 8 and
Chapter 9).
The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in HIV-infected patients is low and rarely
caused by the direct manifestations of active disease (such as Pneumocystis
carinii–induced thyroiditis). Therefore, routine screening in asymptomatic
patients is not generally necessary.2
Patients with a clinical history suggestive of hyper- or hypothyroidism can be
screened with standard thyroid studies (i.e., serum thyroid-stimulating hormone
[TSH] alone or together with total or free thyroxine [T4] levels). Interpret these
with caution, recognizing that changes indicative of nonthyroidal illness (normal
or low TSH with low T4 levels) may be present in seriously ill patients or
patients with advanced HIV. In early HIV infection, thyroid-binding globulin
519

levels can be elevated, resulting in high total T4 levels and normal TSH levels. In
such patients, free T4 levels are generally normal.8 A tender thyroid gland in a
patient with advanced HIV disease requires a fine needle aspiration biopsy with
culture to exclude an opportunistic infection.

Adrenal Function
Although adrenal insufficiency is frequently considered in patients with HIVinfection, the signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid deficiency are relatively
nonspecific and often overlap with the manifestations of AIDS. True adrenal
insufficiency is uncommon with HIV infection.9
In HIV infection, changes in the adrenal function are adaptive, and for the most part
do not require treatment. Subclinical changes include: Diminished responsiveness
to ACTH, a higher morning cortisol, and lower dihydroepiandrosterone levels.10
Cushing’s syndrome is often suspected based on lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy
noted in HIV patients treated with HAART. However, HIV patients have normal
suppression of cortisol levels following dexamethasone administration.
Routine screening for adrenal disease is not necessary. In symptomatic patients
( s e e Chapter 11) a standard ACTH stimulation test can be performed. If
hypercortisolemia is suspected, a 24-hour urinary free cortisol measurement or a
dexamethasone suppression test can be performed (see Chapter 14).
In patients with advanced disease, opportunistic infection of the adrenal gland is a
rare, but reported phenomenon. Tissue is required for definitive diagnosis and a
fine needle aspiration biopsy is preferred when technically feasible.

Gonadal Function
Male hypogonadism is a common finding, particularly with advanced HIV disease.
It can affect up to 40% of HIV-infected men and the cause is likely multifactorial.2
Hypogonadism can contribute to the AIDS wasting syndrome; low testosterone
levels are associated with loss of lean muscle tissue.
Testosterone levels vary during the day, so it is advisable to screen for
hypogonadism with an early morning serum collection. Sex-hormone binding
globulin levels are often elevated in HIV-infected men; therefore, total
testosterone levels may be normal despite low free testosterone levels. If
testosterone levels are low, measurement of gonadotropin levels (luteinizing
hormone [LH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]) can distinguish between
primary and secondary disease.11
Testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men with HIV results in
520

improved sexual functioning, mood, energy, and an increase in lean body mass.11

Bone and Mineral Metabolism
HIV-infected people have an increased risk for low bone mineral density. This
appears to be multifactorial due to malnutrition, vitamin D deficiency,
hypogonadism, as well as traditional risk factors.12 Screening for
osteopenia/osteoporosis should follow standard guidelines (see Chapter 25).
Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of the hip and lumbar spine is the most
reliable and quantifiable. Assessment of calcium and vitamin D status (25-OH
vitamin D level) can also be helpful.13
Published reports of safe and effective treatments for low bone mineral density in
HIV-patients are lacking. HIV-infected patients with a fragility fracture, or
postmenopausal HIV-infected women with osteoporosis may be candidates for
treatment with a bisphosphonate, unless other contraindications exist.

Fat Redistribution
Fat redistribution in HIV patients includes peripheral lipoatrophy, visceral
lipohypertrophy, and a combined phenotype (lipoatrophy plus lipohypertrophy).
These changes are often associated with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.2
Several etiologies have been proposed, but to date no simple mechanism has been
identified.
Increased physical activity and dietary modifications can reduce visceral adiposity
and lipohypertrophy, but do not improve lipoatrophy.
Tesamorelin (Egrifta) is a growth hormone secretagogue that has recently been
approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. It is
generally not recommended for use in individuals with insulin resistance or recent
history of malignancies.14
Lipoatrophy is stigmatizing and only minor improvements occur with changes in
antiretroviral therapy (e.g., switch from stavudine or zidovudine to tenofovir or
abacavir). In HIV, pioglitazone (Actos) does not appreciably increase limb
adiposity, but improves insulin sensitivity. Infusion of biodegradable or
permanent synthetic fillers has been used to treat facial lipoatrophy.14

Professor Sir John Dewhurst 
xiii 
Professor Sir John Dewhurst died on 1 December 2006. 
Jack, as he was known to all his colleagues, was a doyen 
amongst obstetricians and gynaecologists of the twentieth 
century. His reputation was internationally renowned 
and he became a worldwide expert in paediatric and adolescent 
gynaecology, for which he received due accolade. 
He was also an outstanding teacher of obstetrics and 
gynaecology, and, as such, this textbook, which he began 
in the 1970s, is testament to his dedication to the passing 
on of knowledge to others. In 1976 he became President 
of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 
a post he held for 3 years, for which he was subsequently 
knighted. He retired in 1986 after a long and dis tinguished 
career, but his legacy lives on and he will be remembered 
with great affection and professional respect by all who 
knew him.

Preface to the Eighth Edition 
xiv 
As I write this, it is almost 40 years since the 1st edition 
of DewhurstÕ s Postgraduate Obstetrics and Gynaecology was 
published. There are only a very few books that have 
stood the test of such longevity and it is a tribute to the 
concept that Jack Dewhurst had that the book continues 
now into its 8th edition. Jack Õ s concept was to provide the 
postgraduate student with an advanced and integrated 
text for education and it is that philosophy which carries 
into this, the 8th, edition. No textbook can be totally comprehensive, 
and any postgraduate student reading this 
text we hope will be stimulated by the knowledge gained 
to go on and acquire further, more in - depth and specialist 
knowledge. 
This edition has been redesigned with the hope that the 
readers will acquire knowledge in as quick and as comprehensive 
a way as possible. The specialty continues to 
develop and advance and gynaecology particularly is 
becoming increasingly a medical specialty and less of a 
surgical one. This of course is to the benefi t of women as 
therapeutic advances offer them an increasing range of 
options to improve their quality of life. Obstetrics becomes 
increasingly focused on differentiating between the 
normal and the complicated pregnancy, with increasing 
emphasis on improved treatments for medically compromised 
mothers and fetuses and subsequently neonates. 
Again, quality of life is the overriding tenet as the practice 
of obstetrics and gynaecology improves worldwide. 
It is still extremely sad that a quarter of a million 
women die every year worldwide as a result of childbirth 
and it is hoped that this volume will make some contribution 
towards improving these fi gures. 
Many new authors have accepted the challenge to contribute 
to this edition and, along with those authors who 
have contributed in the past, I offer my sincere thanks for 
the time and effort they have put into constructing their 
chapters. We hope we have done this in a way that the 
reader will fi nd intellectually challenging and rewarding. 
Finally, I would like to thank my secretary, Liz Manson, 
who has been the tower of strength behind the production 
of this volume, and also the team at Blackwell Publishing, 
which has changed several times during the nidation of 
this edition but has never wavered in their endeavour to 
achieve the fi nal vision.

Preface to the First Edition 
xv 
Our purpose in writing this book has been to produce a 
comprehensive account of what the specialist in training 
in obstetrics and gynaecology must know. Unfortunately 
for him, he must now know a great deal, not only about 
his own subject, but about certain aspects of closely allied 
specialties such as endocrinology, biochemistry, cytogenetics, 
psychiatry, etc. Accordingly we have tried to offer 
the postgraduate student not only an advanced textbook 
in obstetrics and gynaecology but one which integrates 
the relevant aspects of other subjects which nowadays 
impinge more and more on the clinical fi eld. 
To achieve this aim within, we hope, a reasonable 
compass we have assumed some basic knowledge which 
the reader will have assimilated throughout his medical 
training, and we have taken matters on from there. 
Fundamental facts not in question are stated as briefl y as 
is compatible with accuracy and clarity, and discussion is 
then devoted to more advanced aspects. We acknowledge 
that it is not possible even in this way to provide all the 
detail some readers may wish, so an appropriate bibliography 
is provided with each chapter. Wherever possible 
we have tried to give a positive opinion and our reasons 
for holding it, but to discuss nonetheless other important 
views; this we believe to be more helpful than a complete 
account of all possible opinions which may be held. We 
have chosen moreover to lay emphasis on fundamental 
aspects of the natural and the disease processes which are 
discussed; we believe concentration on these basic physiological 
and pathological features to be important to the 
proper training of a specialist. Clinical matters are, of 
course, dealt with in detail too, whenever theoretical discussion 
of them is rewarding. There are, however, some 
clinical aspects which cannot, at specialist level, be considered 
in theory with real benefi t; examples of these are 
how to palpate a pregnant woman Õ s abdomen and how 
to apply obstetric forceps. In general these matters are 
considered very briefl y or perhaps not at all; this is not a 
book on how things are done, but on how correct treatment 
is chosen, what advantages one choice has over 
another, what complications are to be expected, etc. 
Practical matters, we believe, are better learnt in practice 
and with occasional reference to specialized textbooks 
devoted solely to them. 
A word may be helpful about the manner in which the 
book is set out. We would willingly have followed the 
advice given to Alice when about to testify at the trial of 
the Knave of Hearts in Wonderland, Ô Begin at the beginning, 
keep on until you come to the end and then stop Õ . 
But this advice is diffi cult to follow when attempting to 
fi nd the beginning of complex subjects such as those to 
which this book is devoted. Does the beginning lie with 
fertilization; or with the events which lead up to it; or 
with the genital organs upon the correct function of which 
any pregnancy must depend; or does it lie somewhere 
else? And which direction must we follow then? The disorders 
of reproduction do not lie in a separate compartment 
from genital tract disease, but each is clearly 
associated with the other for at least part of a woman Õ s 
life. Although we have attempted to integrate obstetrics 
with gynaecology and with their associated specialties, 
some separation is essential in writing about them, and 
the plan we have followed is broadly this Ð we begin with 
the female child in utero , follow her through childhood to 
puberty, through adolescence to maturity, through pregnancy 
to motherhood, through her reproductive years to 
the climacteric and into old age. Some events have had to 
be taken out of order, however, although reiteration has 
been avoided by indicating to the reader where in the 
book are to be found other sections dealing with different 
aspects of any subject under consideration. We hope that 
our efforts will provide a coherent, integrated account of 
the fi eld we have attempted to cover which will be to the 
satisfaction of our readers.

The physiological changes of pregnancy are strongly 
proactive, not reactive, with the luteal phase of every 
ovulatory menstrual cycle Ô rehearsing Õ for pregnancy [1] . 
Most pregnancy - driven changes are qualitatively in place 
by the end of the fi rst trimester, only maturing in magnitude 
thereafter. This chapter gives a brief overview of the 
major changes. 
Maternal response to pregnancy 
Normal pregnancy evokes a systemic infl ammatory 
response, which includes the endothelium [2] . This may 
explain the greater risk of cardiovascular disease in later 
life of parous women in comparison with nulliparous 
women. Markers of oxidative Ô stress Õ rise progressively 
throughout the fi rst and second trimesters, but plasma 
concentrations of some endogenous antioxidants, such as 
superoxide dismutase, rise in parallel. The free radical 
superoxide is generated through a variety of pathways, 
including placental ones, but is more damaging when 
converted to the peroxide radical, a reaction catalysed by 
free iron in the plasma. Increasing concern is being 
expressed about over - supplementation with iron, especially 
in conjunction with vitamin C (which increases 
absorption) in pregnant women without evidence of iron 
defi ciency and several studies have shown evidence of 
increased oxidative stress in such women [3] . Conversely, 
the low dietary selenium intake in women in the UK may 
predispose to lower activity of the antioxidant glutathione 
peroxidase and thioredoxin systems in pregnancy. 
Immunology 
Only two types of fetal tissue come into direct contact 
with maternal tissues: the villous trophoblast and the 
extravillous trophoblast. Villous trophoblast, which is a 
continuous syncytium, is bathed in maternal blood but 
seems to be immunologically inert and never expresses 
HLA class I or class II molecules. Extravillous trophoblast 
is directly in contact with maternal endometrial/decidual 
tissues and does not express the major T - cell ligands, 
HLA - A or HLA - B; the HLA class I molecules which are 
expressed are the trophoblast - specifi c HLA - G and HLA - C 
and HLA - E. The decidual uterine natural killer (NK) cells, 
the main type of decidual lymphocyte, differ from those 
in the systemic circulation. They express surface killer 
immunoglobulin- like receptors (KIRs), which bind to 
HLA - C and HLA - G on trophoblast. HLA - E and HLA - G 
are effectively monomorphic, but HLA - C is polymorphic, 
with two main groups, HLA - C1 and the HLA - C2. The 
KIRs are very highly polymorphic, but again fall into two 
main classes, KIR - A (non - activating) and KIR - B (multiply 
activating). Thus the very polymorphic KIR in maternal 
tissues and the polymorphic HLA - C in the fetus make up 
a potentially very variable receptor Ð ligand system. 
The effect of this on implantation has been inferred 
from indirect evidence. Both recurrent miscarriage and 
pre - eclampsia are associated with poor trophoblast invasion. 
The maternal KIR genotype may be AA, AB or BB. 
Since the identifi able trophoblast HLA - C allotypes are 
HLA - C1 and HLA - C2, there are nine possible combinations. 
It has been shown that if the maternal KIR haplotype 
is AA, and the trophoblast expresses any HLA - C2, 
then the possibility of miscarriage or pre - eclampsia is 
signifi cantly increased. However, even one KIR - B provides 
protection [4] . HLA - C2 is highly inhibitory to trophoblast 
migration, and thus appears to need Ô activating 
KIR Õ to overcome it. 
The uterus 
The fi rst - trimester human embryo appears to gain nutrients 
histiotrophically, from the endometrial glands. These

glandular secretions are rich in carbohydrates, lipids and 
growth factors and can well support early growth while 
the conceptus is small [5] . The outer third of the myometrium, 
as well as the endometrium, is anatomically 
changed by pregnancy, and once a pregnancy has gone 
beyond the fi rst trimester, these changes appear to be 
irreversible. The most striking change is in the spiral 
arteries, which undergo extensive remodelling. Extravillous 
trophoblast attacks these vessels as interstitial cells 
within the stroma, and as endovascular cells within the 
vascular lumen. In normal pregnancy, the summed effects 
are the conversion of these vessels into fl oppy thin - walled 
vessels that do not respond to vasoconstrictor stimuli, so 
allowing the maximum fl ow to reach the placenta. This 
remodelling is only completed in the early second trimester, 
but is impaired in both pre - eclampsia and normotensive 
intrauterine growth restriction. 
The uterus must be maintained in quiescence until 
labour is initiated. The mechanisms responsible for this 
have not been fully elucidated, but include locally - 
generated nitric oxide, probably acting through cyclic 
GMP or voltage - gated potassium channels, while a 
number of hormones such as prostacyclin, prostaglandin 
(PG)E2 and calcitonin gene - related peptide act through G s 
receptors, and are relaxatory. 
The cardiovascular system 
There is a signifi cant fall in total peripheral resistance by 
6 weeks Õ gestation to a nadir of about 40% by mid - 
gestation, resulting in a fall in afterload. This is Ô perceived Õ 
as circulatory underfi lling, which activates the renin Ð 
angiotensin Ð aldosterone system and allows the necessary 
expansion of the plasma volume (PV) (Fig. 1.1 ) [6,7] . By 
the late third trimester, the PV has increased from its 
baseline by about 50% in a fi rst pregnancy and 60% in a 
second or subsequent pregnancy. The bigger the expansion, 
the bigger, on average, the birthweight of the 
baby. The total extracellular fl uid volume rises by about 
16% by term, so the percentage rise in PV is disproportionate 
to the whole. The plasma osmolality falls by about 
10 mosmol/kg as water is retained. 
The heart rate rises synchronously, by 10 Ð 15 bpm, so 
the cardiac output begins to rise [8] . There is probably a 
fall in barorefl ex sensitivity as pregnancy progresses, 
and heart rate variability falls. Stroke volume rises a little 
later in the fi rst trimester. These two factors push the 
cardiac output up by 35 Ð 40% in a fi rst pregnancy, and by 
about 50% in later pregnancies; it can rise by a further 
third in labour (Fig. 1.2 ). Table 1.1 summarizes the percentage 
changes in some cardiovascular variables during 
pregnancy. 
Measuring systemic arterial blood pressure in pregnancy 
is notoriously diffi cult, but there is now broad consensus 
that Korotkoff 5 should be used with auscultatory 
techniques [9] . However measured, there is a small fall in 
systolic, and a greater fall in diastolic, blood pressure 
during the fi rst half of pregnancy, resulting in an increased 
pulse pressure. The blood pressure then rises steadily, in 
parallel with an increase in peripheral sympathetic activity, 
and even in normotensive women there may be some 
late overshoot of non - pregnant values. Supine hypotension 
occurs in about 8% of women in late gestation as the 
uterus falls back onto the inferior vena cava, reducing 
venous return. 
The pressor response to angiotensin II is reduced in 
normal pregnancy but is unchanged to noradrenaline. 
The reduced sensitivity to angiotensin II presumably protects 
against the potentially pressor levels of angiotensin 
II found in normal pregnancy and is associated with 
lower receptor density; plasma noradrenaline is not 
increased in normal pregnancy. Pregnancy does not alter 
the response of intramyometrial arteries to a variety of 
vasoconstrictors. Nitric oxide may modulate myogenic 
tone and fl ow - mediated responses in the resistance vasculature 
of the uterine circulation in normal pregnancy. 
The venous pressure in the lower circulation rises, 
for both mechanical and hydrodynamic reasons. The 
pulmonary circulation is able to absorb high rates of 
fl ow without an increase in pressure so pressure in the 
right ventricle, and the pulmonary arteries and capillaries, 
does not change. Pulmonary resistance falls in 
early pregnancy, and does not change thereafter. There 
is progressive venodilatation and rises in venous distensibility 
and capacitance throughout a normal pregnancy, 
possibly because of increased local nitric oxide 
synthesis.

Fig. 1.2 Major haemodynamic changes 
associated with normal human pregnancy. 
The marked augmentation of cardiac 
output results from asynchronous increases 
in both heart rate (HR) and stroke volume 
(SV). Despite the increases in cardiac 
output, blood pressure (BP) decreases for 
most of pregnancy. This implies a very 
substantial reduction in total peripheral 
vascular resistance (TPVR).

The respiratory system 
Tidal volume rises by about 30% in early pregnancy to 
40 Ð 50% above non - pregnant values by term, with a fall in 
expiratory reserve and residual volume (Fig. 1.3 ) [10] . 
Neither forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) nor peak 
expiratory fl ow rate are affected by pregnancy, even in 
women with asthma. The rise in tidal volume is largely 
driven by progesterone, which appears to decrease the 
threshold and increase the sensitivity of the medulla 
oblongata to carbon dioxide. Respiratory rate does not 
change, so the minute ventilation rises by a similar 
amount. This over - breathing begins in every luteal phase; 
the Pco2 is lowest in early gestation. Progesterone also 
increases erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase concentration, 
which will also lower Pco2. Carbon dioxide production 
rises sharply during the third trimester, as fetal metabolism 
increases. The fall in maternal Pco2 allows more 
effi cient placental transfer of carbon dioxide from the 
fetus, which has a Pco2 of around 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa). The 
fall in Pco2 results in a fall in plasma bicarbonate concentration 
(to about 18 Ð 22 mmol/L compared with the 
normal of 24 Ð 28 mmol/L), which contributes to the fall in 
plasma osmolality; the peripheral venous pH rises slightly 
(Table 1.2 and Fig. 1.4 ). 
The increased alveolar ventilation results in a much 
smaller proportional rise in Po2 from about 96.7 to 
101.8 mmHg (12.9 Ð 13.6 kPa). This increase is offset by the 
rightward shift of the maternal oxyhaemoglobin dissociation 
curve caused by an increase in 2,3 - diphosphoglycerate 
(2,3 - DPG) in the erythrocytes. This facilitates oxygen 
unloading to the fetus, which has both a much lower Po2 
(25 Ð 30 mmHg, 3.3 Ð 4.0 kPa) and a marked leftward shift of 
the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, due to the lower 
sensitivity of fetal haemoglobin to 2,3 - DPG. 
There is an increase of about 16% in oxygen consumption 
by term due to increasing maternal and fetal demands. 
Since the increase in oxygen - carrying capacity of the 
blood (see section Haematology) is about 18%, there is

Haematology 
The circulating red cell mass rises by 20 Ð 30% during pregnancy, 
with increases in both cell number and size. It rises 
more in women with multiple pregnancies, and substantially 
more with iron supplementation ( . 29% compared 
with 17%). Serum iron concentration falls, the absorption 
of iron from the gut rises and iron - binding capacity rises 
in a normal pregnancy, since there is increased synthesis 
of the .1 - globulin, transferrin. Plasma folate concentration 
halves by term, because of greater renal clearance, 
although red cell folate concentrations fall less. In the late 
1990s, one - fi fth of the female population aged 16 Ð 64 in 
the UK were estimated to have serum ferritin levels below 
15 . g/L, indicative of low irons stores [12] ; a similar 
survey appears not to have been undertaken since then 
(UK Scientifi c Advisory Committee on Nutrition Report 
actually a fall in arteriovenous oxygen difference. 
Pulmonary blood fl ow, of course, rises in parallel with 
cardiac output and enhances gas transfer. 
Pregnancy places greater demands on the cardiovascular 
than the respiratory system [11] . This is shown in the 
response to moderate exercise (Table 1.3 ).

pregnancy. 
2008). Pregnant adolescents seem to be at particular risk 
of iron defi ciency. Even relatively mild maternal anaemia 
is associated with increased placental weight/birthweight 
ratios and decreased birthweight. However, inappropriate 
supplementation can itself be associated with pregnancy 
problems (see above) [13] . Erythropoietin rises in 
pregnancy, more so if iron supplementation is not taken 
(55% compared with 25%) but the changes in red cell 
mass antedate this; human placental lactogen may stimulate 
haematopoiesis. 
Pro rata, the PV increases more than the red cell mass, 
which leads to a fall in the various concentration measures 
that incorporate the PV, such as the haematocrit, 
haemoglobin concentration and red cell count. The fall in 
packed cell volume from about 36% in early pregnancy 
to about 32% in the third trimester is a sign of normal 
plasma volume expansion. 
The total white cell count rises, mainly because of 
increased polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Neutrophil 
numbers rise with oestrogen concentrations and peak 
at about 33 weeks, stabilizing after that until labour and 
the early puerperium, when they rise sharply. Their 
phagocytic function increases during gestation. T and B 
lymphocyte counts do not change but their function is 
suppressed, making pregnant women more susceptible to 
viral infections, malaria and leprosy. The uterine NK cells 
express receptors that recognize the otherwise anomalous 
combination of human lymphocyte antigens (HLA - C, - E 
and - G) expressed by the invasive cytotrophoblasts. This 
is likely to be central to the maternal recognition of the 
conceptus [14] (see above). 
Platelet count and platelet volume are largely unchanged 
in most pregnant women, although their survival is 
reduced. Platelet reactivity is increased in the second and 
third trimesters and does not return to normal until about 
12 weeks after delivery. 
Coagulation 
Continuing low - grade coagulopathy is a feature of 
normal pregnancy [15] . Several of the potent procoagulatory 
factors rise from at least the end of the fi rst trimester 
(Fig. 1.5 ). For example, factors VII, VIII and X all rise, 
and absolute plasma fi brinogen doubles, while antithrombin 
III, an inhibitor of coagulation, falls. The erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate rises early in pregnancy due 
to the increase in fi brinogen and other physiological 
changes. Protein C, which inactivates factors V and VIII, 
is probably unchanged in pregnancy, but concentrations 
of protein S, one of its cofactors, fall during the fi rst two 
trimesters. An estimated 5 Ð 10% of the total circulating 
fi brinogen is consumed during placental separation, 
and thromboembolism is one of the main causes of 
maternal death in the UK. Plasma fi brinolytic activity is 
decreased during pregnancy and labour, but returns to 
non - pregnant values within an hour of delivery of the

50 mmol/L, but creatinine clearance begins to fall during 
the last couple of months of pregnancy, so plasma creatinine 
concentration rises again. 
Total body water rises by about 20% during pregnancy 
(. 8.5 L) with a very sharp fall in plasma osmolality 
between weeks 4 and 6 after conception, possibly through 
the actions of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). 
The volume - sensing arginine vasopressin release mechanisms 
evidently adjust as pregnancy progresses. As well 
as water present in the fetus, amniotic fl uid, placenta and 
maternal tissues, there is also oedema fl uid and increased 
hydration of the connective tissue ground substance with 
laxity and swelling of connective tissue. 
The pregnant woman accumulates some 950 mmol of 
sodium in the face of high circulating concentrations of 
progesterone, which competes with aldosterone at the 
distal tubule. The potentially natriuretic prostacyclin also 
rises markedly, with a small rise in atrial natriuretic 
peptide (ANP). This stimulates the renin Ð angiotensin 
system, with increased synthesis and release of aldosterone 
from the fi rst trimester. The raised plasma prolactin 
may also contribute to sodium retention. It is 
assumed that glomerulotubular balance must also change 
in pregnancy to allow the sodium retention that actually 
occurs. There is a fall of some 4 Ð 5 mmol/L in plasma 
sodium by term, but plasma chloride does not change. 
Curiously, some 350 mmol of potassium are also retained 
during pregnancy, in the face of the much - increased GFR, 
substantially raised aldosterone concentrations and a 
relatively alkaline urine. Renal tubular potassium reabsorption 
evidently adjusts appropriately to the increased fi ltered 
potassium load. 
Serum uric acid concentration falls by about one - 
quarter in early pregnancy, with an increase in its fractional 
excretion secondary to a decrease in net tubular 
reabsorption. The kidney excretes a progressively smaller 
proportion of the fi ltered uric acid, so some rise in serum 
uric acid concentration during the second half of pregnancy 
is normal. A similar pattern is seen in relation to 
urea, which is also partly reabsorbed in the nephron. 
Glucose excretion may rise 10 - fold as the greater fi ltered 
load exceeds the proximal tubular Tmax for glucose 
(. 1.6 Ð 1.9 mmol/min). If the urine of pregnant women is 
tested suffi ciently often, glycosuria will be detected in 
50%. The excretion of most amino acids increases, which 
is curious since these are used by the fetus to synthesize 
protein. The pattern of excretion is not constant, and 
differs between individual amino acids. Excretion of the 
water - soluble vitamins is also increased. The mechanism 
for all these is inadequate tubular reabsorption in the face 
of a 50% rise in GFR. 
Urinary calcium excretion is also twofold to threefold 
higher in normal pregnancy than in the non - pregnant 
woman, even though tubular reabsorption is enhanced, 
presumably under the infl uence of the increased concentrations 
of 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D. To counter this, 
The renal system 
The kidneys increase in size in pregnancy mainly because 
renal parenchymal volume rises by about 70% with 
marked dilatation of the calyces, renal pelvis and ureters 
in most women [17] . Ureteric tone does not decrease, but 
bladder tone does. The effective renal plasma fl ow (ERPF) 
is increased by at least 6 weeks Õ gestation and rises to 
some 80% by mid - pregnancy falling thereafter to about 
65% above non - pregnant values (Fig. 1.6 ). This increase 
is proportionally greater than the increase in cardiac 
output, presumably refl ecting specifi c vasodilatation, 
probably via increased renal prostacyclin synthesis. The 
glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) also increases, by about 
45% by the ninth week, only rising thereafter by another 
5 Ð 10%, but this is largely maintained to term, so the fi ltration 
fraction falls during the fi rst trimester, is stable 
during the second, and rises towards non - pregnant values 
thereafter. However, these major increments do not 
exhaust the renal reserve. The differential changes in 
ERPF and GFR in late pregnancy suggest a mechanism 
acting preferentially at the efferent arterioles, possibly 
through angiotensin II. 
The fi ltered load of metabolites therefore increases 
markedly, and reabsorptive mechanisms frequently do 
not keep up (e.g. glucose and amino acids; see below). 
These changes have profound effects on the concentrations 
of certain plasma metabolites and electrolytes and 
Ô normal Õ laboratory reference ranges may thus be inappropriate 
in pregnancy. For example, plasma creatinine 
concentration falls signifi cantly by the fourth week of 
gestation and continues to fall to mid - pregnancy, to below 
Fig. 1.6 The changes in renal function during pregnancy are 
largely complete by the end of the fi rst trimester and are thus 
proactive not reactive to the demands of pregnancy. The 
fi ltration fraction falls during the fi rst trimester but begins to 
return to non - pregnant levels during the third trimester.

Maternal Physiology 11 
Carbohydrates/insulin resistance 
Pregnancy is hyperlipidaemic and glucosuric. Although 
neither the absorption of glucose from the gut nor the 
half- life of insulin seem to change, and the insulin 
response is well - maintained, by 6 Ð 12 weeks Õ gestation 
fasting plasma glucose concentrations have fallen by 
0.11 mmol/L, and by the end of the fi rst trimester the 
increase in blood glucose following a carbohydrate load 
is less than outside pregnancy [21] . This increased sensitivity 
stimulates glycogen synthesis and storage, deposition 
of fat and transport of amino acids into cells. The 
uptake of amino acids by the mother for gluconeogenesis 
may also be enhanced. After mid - pregnancy, resistance to 
the action of insulin develops progressively and plasma 
glucose concentrations rise, though remaining below 
non- pregnant levels (Fig. 1.7 ). Glucose crosses the placenta 
readily and the fetus uses glucose as its primary 
energy substrate, so this rise is presumably benefi cial to 
the fetus. Fetal and maternal glucose concentrations are 
signifi cantly correlated. 
The insulin resistance is presumably largely endocrine - 
driven, possibly via increased cortisol or human placental 
lactogen. Plasma leptin concentrations are directly correlated 
with insulin resistance during pregnancy [22] 
while concentrations of glucagons and the catecholamines 
are unaltered. Adiponectin concentrations fall in 
pregnancy and are negatively correlated with fasting 
insulin concentrations and white fat mass. Adiponectin 
concentrations are also low in other insulin - resistant 
states, but whether this is cause or effect is still 
uncertain. 
Lipids 
Total plasma cholesterol falls early in pregnancy, reaching 
its lowest point at 6 Ð 8 weeks, but then rises to term. There 
is a striking increase in circulating free fatty acids and 
complex lipids in pregnancy, with approximately threefold 
increases in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) 
triglycerides and a 50% increase in VLDL cholesterol 
by 36 weeks [23] , which is probably driven by oestrogens. 
High - density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is also 
increased. Birthweight and placental weight are directly 
related to maternal VLDL triglyceride levels at term. 
The hyperlipidaemia of normal pregnancy is not atherogenic 
because the pattern of increase is not that of atherogenesis, 
although pregnancy can unmask pathological 
hyperlipidaemia. 
Lipids undergo peroxidation in all tissues as part of 
normal cellular function. Excess production of lipid can 
result in oxidative stress, with damage to the cell membrane. 
During normal pregnancy, increases in plasma 
lipid peroxides appear by the second trimester in step 
with the general rise in lipids and may taper off later 
in gestation [24] . As the peroxide levels rise so do those 
of vitamin E and some other antioxidants; this rise 
is proportionately greater than that of peroxides so 
intestinal absorption doubles by 24 weeks, after which it 
stabilizes. Renal bicarbonate reabsorption and hydrogen 
ion excretion appear to be unaltered during pregnancy. 
Although pregnant women can acidify their urine, it is 
usually mildly alkaline. 
Total protein and albumin excretion both rise during 
pregnancy, to at least 36 weeks, due to the increased GFR, 
and changes in both glomerular and tubular function. 
Thus in late pregnancy, an upper limit of normal of 
200 mg total protein excretion per 24 - hour collection is 
accepted. The assessment of proteinuria in pregnancy 
using dipsticks has been shown to give highly variable 
data. 
The gastrointestinal system 
Taste often alters very early in pregnancy. The whole 
intestinal tract has decreased motility during the fi rst two 
trimesters, with increased absorption of water and salt, 
tending to increase constipation. Heartburn is common as 
a result of increased intragastric pressure. Hepatic synthesis 
of albumin, plasma globulin and fi brinogen increases, 
the latter two suffi ciently to give increased plasma concentrations 
despite the increase in PV. Total hepatic synthesis 
of globulin increases under oestrogen stimulation, 
so the hormone - binding globulins rise. There is decreased 
hepatic extraction of circulating amino acids. 
The gallbladder increases in size and empties more 
slowly during pregnancy but the secretion of bile is 
unchanged. Cholestasis is almost physiological in pregnancy 
and may be associated with generalized pruritus 
but only rarely produces jaundice. 
Energy requirements 
The energy cost of pregnancy includes Ô stored Õ energy in 
maternal and fetal tissues, and the greater energy expenditure 
needed for maintenance and physical activity. The 
weight gained during pregnancy arises from the products 
of conception, the increased size of maternal tissues such 
as the uterus and breasts, and the greater maternal fat 
stores. The basal metabolic rate has risen by about 5% by 
the end of pregnancy in a woman of normal weight [18] . 
The average weight gain over pregnancy in a woman of 
normal body mass index (BMI) is about 12.5 kg. The 
average weight gain from pre - pregnancy values at 6 Ð 18 
months after delivery is 1 Ð 2 kg, but in about one - fi fth of 
women can be 5 kg or more [19] . Obese women usually 
put on less weight during pregnancy, but retain more post 
partum. A 5 - year follow - up of nearly 3000 women found 
that parous women gained 2 Ð 3 kg more than nulliparous 
women during this time. They also had signifi cantly 
greater increases in waist/hip ratio, an independent risk 
factor for future cardiovascular disease [20] . 
12 Chapter 1 
binding globulins for thyroxine, corticosteroids and the 
sex steroids, also affect the mother Õ s endocrinological 
function. The fetoplacental unit synthesizes very large 
amounts of oestrogens and progesterone, both probably 
being concerned with uterine growth and quiescence 
and with mammary gland development. However, they 
also stimulate synthesis of a variety of other important 
hormones. Oestrogens stimulate both the synthesis of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its 
tyrosine kinase receptors and angiogenesis; the two are 
linked. VEGF appears to interact with other placentally 
produced hormones and angiopoietin - 2 as major players 
in the development of the villous capillary bed in early 
human pregnancy. The peroxisome proliferator - activated 
receptor - . (PPAR . ) is a member of the nuclear receptor 
superfamily and has an important role in modulating 
expression of numerous other genes. It is expressed in 
human villous and extravillous cytotrophoblast. PPAR . 
binds to, and is activated by, natural ligands such as 
eicosanoids, fatty acids and oxidized low - density lipoproteins. 
Studies in knockout mice have shown it to be essential 
for placental development. 
The hypothalamus and pituitary gland 
The pituitary gland increases in weight by 30% in fi rst 
pregnancies and by 50% subsequently. The number of 
lactotrophs is increased and plasma prolactin begins 
to rise within a few days of conception and by term 
may be 10 Ð 20 times as high as in the non - pregnant 
woman; the secretion of other anterior pituitary hormones 
is unchanged or reduced. hCG and the gonadotrophins 
share a common . - subunit, and the rapidly 
rising hCG concentration suppresses secretion of both 
follicle- stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, 
thus inhibiting ovarian follicle development by a blunting 
of response to gonadotrophin - releasing hormone. 
physiological activities are protected. Lipid peroxidation 
is also active in the placenta, increasing with gestation. 
Since the placenta contains high concentrations of unsaturated 
fats under conditions of low P a o2 , antioxidants such 
as vitamin A, the carotenoids and provitamin A carotenoids 
are required to protect both mother and fetus from 
free radical activity. 
Early in pregnancy fat is deposited but from mid - 
pregnancy it is also used as a source of energy, mainly by 
the mother so that glucose is available for the growing 
fetus [25] and to provide energy stores for the high metabolic 
demands of late pregnancy and lactation. The accurate 
measurement of pregnancy - related fat deposition is 
technically diffi cult, but total accretion is estimated at 
about 2 Ð 6 kg. The absorption of fat from the intestine is 
not directly altered during pregnancy. The hormone 
leptin acts as a sensor alerting the brain to the extent of 
body fat stores. Concentrations rise threefold during 
pregnancy and are directly correlated with total body fat; 
they are not related to the basal metabolic rate during 
gestation. Recent animal studies suggest that the hypothalamus, 
which contains the appetite - regulating centres, 
is desensitized to the effects of leptin in pregnancy. This 
allows the mother to eat more than she otherwise would 
consider doing, with consequent fat deposition. 
Endocrine systems 
The placenta is a powerhouse of hormone production 
from the beginning of gestation and challenges the mother 
Õ s autonomy. 
Placental hormones 
hCG is the signal for pregnancy, but indirect effects, such 
as the oestrogen - driven increased hepatic synthesis of the 
Fig. 1.7 Responses in normal pregnant 
women to a 50 - g oral glucose load during 
early and late pregnancy. During early 
pregnancy there is a normal plasma insulin 
response with a relative reduction in 
plasma glucose concentrations compared 
with the non - pregnant state. In contrast, 
during late pregnancy plasma glucose 
concentrations reach higher levels after a 
delay despite a considerably enhanced 
insulin response, a pattern which could be 
explained by relative resistance to insulin. 
Maternal Physiology 13 
albumin concentration falls, but unbound ionized calcium 
is unchanged. Synthesis of 1,25 - dihydroxycholecalciferol 
increases, promoting enhanced gastrointestinal calcium 
absorption. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates the 
synthesis of 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D in the proximal 
convoluted tubule. There is a fall in intact PTH during 
pregnancy but a doubling of 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D; 
PTH - related protein (PTHrP) is also present in the maternal 
circulation. The main sources of PTHrP are the fetal 
parathyroid gland and the placenta. It is presumably placentally 
derived PTHrP that is transferred into the maternal 
circulation and affects calcium homeostasis by acting 
through the PTH receptor. 
Renal hormones 
The renin Ð angiotensin system is activated from very early 
in pregnancy (see section on the cardiovascular system 
above). A vasodilator component to the renin Ð angiotensin 
system has recently been described in which angiotensin 
1 Ð 7 is the agonist; angiotensin 1 Ð 7 rises during pregnancy 
and may stimulate release of both nitric oxide and prostacyclin. 
Synthesis of erythropoietin appears to be stimulated 
by hCG; its concentration rises from the fi rst 
trimester, peaking in mid - gestation and falling somewhat 
thereafter. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator, synthesized 
mainly in the renal endothelium. Concentrations 
begin to rise rapidly by 8 Ð 10 weeks of gestation, being 
fourfold higher than non - pregnant values by the end of 
the fi rst trimester. 
The pancreas 
The size of the islets of Langerhans and the number of . 
cells increase during pregnancy, as does the number of 
receptor sites for insulin. The functions of the pancreas in 
pregnancy are considered above. 
The endothelium 
The endothelium synthesizes a variety of hormones, both 
vasodilator (e.g. prostacyclin, VEGF - A, nitric oxide) and 
vasoconstrictor (e.g. endothelin - 1). The vasodilators are 
mostly upregulated in pregnancy, and allow the early fall 
in total peripheral resistance. Interestingly, although the 
lipid profi le in pregnancy appears to be atherogenic, 
endothelial function in normal pregnancy, as assessed 
by fl ow - mediated dilatation, is not impaired. This may be 
due to the increased oestradiol concentrations, which 
upregulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase. 
Conclusion 
This chapter attempts to outline the physiology of normal 
pregnancy. The changes mostly begin very early indeed, 
and it may be that two of the major problems of pregnancy, 
intrauterine growth retardation and pre - eclampsia, 
Thyroid - stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion responds 
normally to hypothalamic thyrotropin - releasing hormone 
(also synthesized in the placenta). Adrenocorticotrophic 
hormone (ACTH) concentrations rise during pregnancy, 
partly because of placental synthesis of ACTH and of a 
corticotrophin - releasing hormone and do not respond to 
normal control mechanisms. 
The adrenal gland 
Both the plasma total and the unbound cortisol and other 
corticosteroid concentrations rise in pregnancy, from about 
the end of the fi rst trimester. Concentrations of cortisol - 
binding globulin double. Excess glucocorticoid exposure 
in utero appears to inhibit fetal growth in both animals 
and humans. However, the normal placenta synthesizes 
a pregnancy - specifi c 11 . - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 
which inhibits transfer of maternal cortisol. The marked 
rise in secretion of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone in 
pregnancy has already been mentioned. Synthesis of the 
weaker mineralocorticoid 11 - deoxycorticosterone is also 
increased by the eighth week of pregnancy, and actually 
increases proportionally more than any other cortical 
steroid, possibly due to placental synthesis. 
The measurement of plasma catecholamines has inherent 
diffi culties, but there is now broad consensus that 
plasma catecholamine concentrations fall from the fi rst to 
the third trimester. There is some blunting of the rise in 
noradrenaline (refl ecting mainly sympathetic nerve activity) 
seen on standing and isometric exercise in pregnancy, 
but the adrenaline response (predominantly adrenal) is 
unaltered [26] . 
The thyroid gland 
hCG may suppress TSH in early pregnancy because they 
share a common . - subunit. The thyroid remains normally 
responsive to stimulation by TSH and suppression 
by triiodothyronine (T3). There is a threefold rise in 
the thyroid Õ s clearance of iodine, allowing the absolute 
iodine uptake to remain within the non - pregnant range. 
Thyroid - binding globulin concentrations double during 
pregnancy, but other thyroid - binding proteins do not 
increase. Overall, free plasma T3 and thyroxine (T4) concentrations 
remain at the same levels as outside pregnancy 
(although total levels are raised), and most 
pregnant women are euthyroid. Free T4 may fall in late 
gestation [27] . 
Calcitonin, another thyroid hormone, rises during the 
fi rst trimester, peaks in the second and falls thereafter, 
although the changes are not large. It may contribute to 
the regulation of 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D. 
The parathyroid glands and 
calcium metabolism 
Calcium homeostasis changes markedly in pregnancy 
[28,29] . Maternal total plasma calcium falls because

very early normal pregnancy adaptation may help us to 
understand the abnormal. 
Summary box 1.1 
¥ Each ovulatory menstrual cycle prepares the potential 
mother for the physiological changes of pregnancy. 
Progesterone is the prime mover, and before conception 
initiates such changes as increased tidal volume, heart rate 
and glomerular fi ltration rate, as well as endometrial 
priming. These changes are proactive, not reactive, and in 
normal pregnancy are greater than physiologically 
necessary. 
¥ Early pregnancy is associated with a systemic 
infl ammatory response. The mother Õs immune response is 
altered to allow implantation and placentation and the 
remodelling of the spiral arteries. 
¥ Total peripheral resistance falls very early, followed by the 
blood pressure; plasma volume and cardiac output rise. 
Alveolar ventilation and oxygen -carrying capacity increase 
more than oxygen consumption. Even normal pregnancy is 
associated with low -grade coagulopathy. 
¥ Renal fi ltration increases very early. The rise in fi ltered 
sodium load activates the renin Ðangiotensin system, 
allowing sodium retention and the increased plasma 
volume. Plasma concentrations of various analytes are 
reduced both because of increased fi ltration and plasma 
volume expansion. Aminoaciduria and glycosuria are 
common. 
¥ The average weight gain over pregnancy in a woman of 
normal BMI is about 12.5 kg. Some of this is usually 
retained after delivery. Pregnancy is associated with insulin 
resistance and hyperlipidaemia; there is considerable fat 
deposition. 
¥ The placenta is a powerhouse of hormone and cytokine 
synthesis, modifying the mother Õs physiology for the 
demands of pregnancy.

The placenta was already recognized and venerated by 
the early Egyptians, while it was the Greek physician 
Diogenes of Apollonia ( c . 480 bc ) who fi rst ascribed the 
function of fetal nutrition to the organ. Aristotle (384 to 
322 bc ) reported that the chorion membranes fully enclose 
the fetus, but it was only in 1559 during the Renaissance 
that Realdus Columbus introduced the term Ô placenta Õ , 
derived from the Latin for a fl at cake. 
Structural characteristics of the 
human placenta 
Placental shape 
On the gross anatomic level, the placenta of eutherian 
animals can be classifi ed according to the physical interactions 
between fetal and maternal tissues [1] . Such interactions 
may be restricted to specifi c sites or may be found 
covering the whole surface of the chorionic sac and the 
inner uterine surface. On this gross anatomical level, the 
human placenta is classifi ed as a discoidal placenta, confi ning 
interactions to a more or less circular area (Fig. 2.1 a). 
Materno-fetal interdigitations 
The next level of classifi cation is based on the interdigitations 
between maternal and fetal tissues. In the human 
placenta maternal and fetal tissues are arranged is such a 
way that there are three - dimensional tree - like structures 
called villous trees of fetal tissues that fl oat in a lake of 
maternal blood [1] . Like the knots and branches of a tree, 
the fetal tissues repeatedly branch into smaller and 
slender villi (Fig. 2.1 b). 
Materno-fetal barrier 
On the level of interactions between uterine and fetal 
tissues, the human displays an invasive type of implantation 
and placentation [1] . The uterine epithelium is penetrated, 
and invasion of fetal cells into maternal tissues 
results in erosion into maternal vessels leading to bathing 
of placental villi in the mother Õ s blood. An epithelial layer 
termed villous trophoblast , which comes into direct contact 
with maternal blood and which builds the placental 
barrier between maternal and fetal tissues, covers placental 
villi (Fig. 2.1 c). 
This type of placentation is termed haemomonochorial 
since on the maternal side there is only blood and no 
longer blood vessels (haemo) and on the fetal side there 
is only one layer of trophoblast (monochorial) between 
maternal blood and the fetal capillaries (Fig. 2.1 c). 
Vascular arrangement 
It is not only the thickness and exact histological nature 
of the placental barrier that defi nes the rate of diffusional 
exchange. Another important determinant is the direction 
of blood fl ows of mother and fetus in relation to each 
other. The vascular arrangement of the human placenta 
cannot be clearly defi ned due to the branching of the 
villous trees into all directions and a respective maternal 
blood fl ow somehow bypassing these branches. Therefore, 
this unpredictable and variable fl ow pattern has been 
termed multivillous fl ow (Fig. 2.1 d) [1] .

Summary box 2.1 
¥ The human placenta is a discoidal placenta. 
¥ The interdigitations between maternal and fetal tissues are 
arranged as tree -like structures called villous trees, which 
are surrounded by a multivillous fl ow of maternal blood.

maternal blood and fetal tissues (haemomonochorial 
placentation).

basal plate is a colourful mixture of fetal trophoblasts and 
maternal cells of the decidua, all of which are embedded 
in trophoblast - secreted matrix - type fi brinoid, decidual 
extracellular matrices, and fi brin - type fi brinoid. At the

eccentric position on the fetal side of the placenta [1] . The 
average measures of a delivered placenta at term are as 
follows: diameter 22 cm, central thickness 2.5 cm, and 
weight 450 Ð 500 g. However, one has to keep in mind that 
these data may vary considerably due to the mode of 
delivery, especially content versus loss of maternal and/ 
or fetal blood. 
Tissue a rrangements 
On the fetal side of the placenta, the avascular amnion 
covers the chorionic plate . Underneath the amnion, chorionic 
vessels continue with those of the umbilical cord 
and are arranged in a star - like pattern. At the other end, 
these vessels continue with those of the villous trees 
where the capillary system between arteries and veins is 
located. The villous trees originate from the chorionic 
plate and fl oat in a lake of maternal blood [1] . On the 
maternal side of the placenta, the basal plate is located (Fig. 
2.1 b). It is an artifi cial surface generated by separation of 
the placenta from the uterine wall during delivery. The

These spaces fl ow together forming larger lacunae ( lacunar 
stage ), and are fi nally separated by parts of the syncytiotrophoblast 
(trabeculae) that cross the syncytial mass 
from the embryonic to the maternal side [1] . 
At the end of this stage, at day 12 post conception, the 
process of implantation is completed. The developing 
embryo with its surrounding extraembryonic tissues is 
totally embedded in the endometrium, and the syncytiotrophoblast 
surrounds the whole surface of the conceptus. 
Mesenchymal cells derived from the embryo spread 
over the inner surface of the trophoblast (the extraembryonic 
mesoderm), thus generating a new combination of 
trophoblast and mesoderm, termed chorion . 
The development of the lacunar system subdivides the 
placenta into its three compartments. 
1 The embryonically oriented part of the trophoblast 
together with extraembryonic mesoderm will develop 
into the chorionic plate . 
2 The trabeculae will become the anchoring villi , while 
the growing branches will develop into fl oating villi . The 
lacunae surrounding the villi will turn into the intervillous 
space . 
3 The maternally oriented part of the trophoblast 
together with components of maternal decidual tissues 
will develop into the basal plate . 
Early v illous s tage 
Starting on day 12 post conception, proliferation of 
cytotrophoblast pushes trophoblasts to penetrate the 
syncytial trabeculae, reaching the maternal side of the 
syncytiotrophoblast by day 14. Further proliferation of 
trophoblasts inside the trabeculae (day 13) stretches 
the trabeculae resulting in the development of syncytial 
side branches fi lled with cytotrophoblasts (primary 
villi) [1] . 
Shortly after, the mesenchymal cells from the extraembryonic 
mesoderm follow the cytotrophoblast and penetrate 
the trabeculae and the primary villi, thus generating 
secondary villi with a mesenchymal core. At this stage, 
there is always a complete cytotrophoblast layer between 
penetrating mesenchyme and syncytiotrophoblast. 
Around day 20 Ð 21, vascularization (development of 
new vessels from haemangioblastic precursor cells) 
within the villous mesenchyme gives rise to the formation 
of fi rst placental vessels ( tertiary villi ). Only later will the 
connection to the vessel system of the embryo proper be 
established via the umbilical cord. 
The villi are organized in villous trees that cluster 
together into a series of spherical units known as lobules 
or placentomes. Each placentome originates from the chorionic 
plate by a thick villous trunk stemming from a 
trabecula. Continuous branching of the main trunk results 
in daughter villi mostly freely ending in the intervillous 
space, the fl oating villi. 
Placental d evelopment 
Trophoblast l ineage 
At the transition between morula and blastocyst, the trophoblast 
lineage is the fi rst to differentiate from the inner 
cell mass, the embryoblast (Fig. 2.2 ) [2] . Only after attachment 
of the blastocyst to the endometrial epithelium does 
further differentiation of the trophoblast occur. Exact 
knowledge of the processes in the human is still lacking, 
but it is anticipated that at this stage the fi rst syncytial 
fusion of trophoblasts takes place. Fusion of those trophoblasts 
in direct contact with maternal tissues as well 
as the embryoblast generates the very fi rst syncytiotrophoblast 
and only this layer is able to penetrate the 
uterine epithelium (Fig. 2.2 ). 
Prelacunar s tage 
At day 7 Ð 8 post conception, the blastocyst has completely 
crossed the epithelium and is embedded within the 
endometrium. The developing embryo is completely surrounded 
by the growing placenta, which at this stage 
consists of the two fundamental subtypes of the trophoblast. 
The multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast is in direct 
contact with maternal tissues, while the mononucleated 
cytotrophoblast as the stem cell layer of the trophoblast 
is directed towards the embryo. 
All the differentiation and developmental stages of the 
placenta described so far take place before fl uid - fi lled 
spaces within the syncytiotrophoblast can be detected. 
This is why this stage is termed Ô prelacunar Õ [1] . 
Lacunar s tage 
At day 8 Ð 9 post conception, the syncytiotrophoblast generates 
a number of fl uid - fi lled spaces within its mass. 
Fig. 2.2 During implantation of the blastocyst, trophoblast cells 
in direct contact with maternal tissues syncytially fuse and give 
rise to the syncytiotrophoblast. Only this multinucleated tissue is 
able to penetrate the uterine epithelium and to implant the 
developing embryo.

Plugging of spiral arteries 
The invasion of extravillous trophoblasts is the ultimate 
means of transforming maternal vessels into large - bore 
conduits that enable adequate supply of oxygen and 
nutrients to the placenta [1,7] . However, free transfer of 
maternal blood to the intervillous space is only established 
at the end of the fi rst trimester of pregnancy [8] . 
Before the free transfer of maternal blood can occur, the 
extent of invasion and thus the number of endovascular 
trophoblasts is so great that the trophoblasts aggregate 
within the vessel lumina and plug the distal segments of 
the spiral arteries (Fig. 2.3 ). Hence, before 10 Ð 12 weeks of 
gestation, the intervillous space contains mostly glandular 
secretion products from the eroded uterine glands 
together with a plasma fi ltrate that is free of maternal 
blood cells ( histiotrophic nutrition ) (Fig. 2.3 ) [8,9] . 
The reason for such a paradoxical plugging of already 
eroded and transformed arteries may be because the lack 
of blood cells keeps the placenta and the embryo in a 
low - oxygen environment of less than 20 mmHg in the 
fi rst trimester of pregnancy. This low - oxygen environment 
may be necessary to reduce formation of free 
Trophoblastic cell columns 
During penetration of the syncytial trabeculae, the 
cytotrophoblasts reach the maternal endometrial tissues 
while the following mesenchymal cells do not penetrate 
to the tips of the trabeculae. At the tips of the anchoring 
villi multiple layers of cytotrophoblasts develop, 
referred to as trophoblastic cell columns (Fig. 2.3 ) [1,3] . 
Only those cytotrophoblasts remain as proliferative stem 
cells that are in direct contact with the basement membrane 
separating trophoblast from mesenchyme of the 
anchoring villi. 
Subtypes of extravillous trophoblast 
The formation of cell columns does not result in a complete 
layer of a trophoblastic shell but rather is mostly organized 
as separated columns from which extravillous trophoblasts 
invade into maternal uterine tissues (Fig. 2.3 ) [1] . All 
these cells migrate as interstitial trophoblast into the 
endometrial stroma [4] , while a subset of the interstitial 
trophoblast further penetrates the wall of the uterine spiral 
arteries ( intramural trophoblast ), fi nally reaching the vessels Õ 
lumen ( endovascular trophoblast ) (Fig. 2.3 ) [5] . Another 
subset of the interstitial trophoblast penetrates the walls 
of uterine glands, fi nally opening such glands towards 
the intervillous space ( endoglandular trophoblast ) (Fig. 2.4 ) 
[6] . Some of the interstitial trophoblasts fuse and generate 
Fig. 2.3 Schematic representation of the 
developing embryo and its surrounding 
tissues at about 8 Ð 10 weeks of pregnancy. 
The amnionic cavity with the embryo inside 
is marked off by the amnion that has 
already contacted the chorion. From the 
chorion, villous trees protrude into the 
intervillous space where some villi have 
direct contact with the basal plate 
(anchoring villi). At these sites trophoblastic 
cell columns are the source for all 
extravillous trophoblast cells invading 
maternal tissues. Interstitial trophoblast 
cells derived from these columns invade 
endometrium and myometrium, while a 
subset of these cells penetrates the spiral 
arteries fi rst as intramural and then as 
endovascular trophoblast cells . Onset of 
maternal blood fl ow into the placenta starts 
in the upper regions of the placenta (the 
abembryonic pole) where development is 
slightly delayed. The local high 
concentrations of oxygen contribute to the 
regression of villi at the abembryonic pole. 
This in turn leads to the formation of the 
smooth chorion, the fetal membranes.

Fig. 2.4 Trophoblast differentiation and subtypes. The 
trophoblast lineage is the fi rst to develop at the blastocyst stage. 
From this stage onwards, further differentiation leads to the 
generation of the syncytiotrophoblast and subsequently to the 
two main trophoblast types of placental villi, villous 
cytotrophoblast and villous syncytiotrophoblast. The trophoblast 
cells that start to invade maternal tissues are termed extravillous 
trophoblast. From the interstitital trophoblast all other subtypes 
of extravillous trophoblast develop.

radicals that affect the growing embryo in this critical 
stage of tissue and organ development [10,11] . 
Onset of m aternal b lood fl ow 
At the end of the fi rst trimester the trophoblastic plugs 
become pervious and maternal blood cells enter the intervillous 
space, establishing the fi rst arterial blood fl ow to 
the placenta ( haemotrophic nutrition ) [8,11] . The infl ow 
starts in those upper parts of the placenta that are closer 
to the endometrial epithelium (the abembryonic pole of the 
placenta) (Fig. 2.3 ). These sites are characterized by a 
slight delay in development since the deeper parts at the 
embryonic pole have been the fi rst to develop directly after 
implantation (Fig. 2.3 ). Therefore, at these upper sites the 
plugs inside the vessels contain fewer cells, enabling 
blood cells to penetrate the plugs earlier, and thus blood 
fl ow starts at these sites fi rst. Here the placental villi 
degenerate in larger parts and the chorion becomes secondarily 
smooth. The regression leads to the formation of 
the fetal membrane or chorion laeve. The remaining part 
of the placenta develops into the chorion frondosum , the 
defi nitive disc - shaped placenta. 
Basic s tructure of v illi 
Villous t rophoblast 
The branches of the syncytial trabeculae are the forerunners 
of the placental villi. Throughout gestation the 
syncytial cover remains and forms the placental barrier 
between maternal blood fl oating in the intervillous space 
and the fetal vessels within the mesenchymal core of the 
villi [1] . 
Villous c ytotrophoblast 
The layer of mononucleated villous cytotrophoblast cells 
is the basal layer of the villous trophoblast compartment 
resting on the basal lamina underneath the multinucleated 
layer of syncytiotrophoblast (see Fig. 2.1 c) [1] . 
Villous cytotrophoblasts are a heterogeneous population: 
a subset proliferate throughout gestation (in contrast to 
the mouse, which terminally differentiates its chorionic 
trophoblast in mid - gestation), some exhibit a progenitor 
status because they can be induced to differentiate along 
the extravillous pathway, while others are in varying 
stages of differentiation, preparing for syncytial fusion 
directed by the transcription factor GCM1 (glial cell 
missing - 1) [12,13] . The number of villous cytotrophoblasts 
continuously increases during pregnancy, from 
about 1 . 10 9 at 13 Ð 16 weeks to about 6 . 10 9 at 37 Ð 41 
weeks of gestation. These cells are gradually dispersed 
into a discontinuous layer in the third trimester due to the 
rapid expansion and specialization of the peripheral placental 
villi responsible for gas and nutrient exchange. 
Villous cytotrophoblasts do not normally come into 
direct contact with maternal blood, unless focal damage 
occurs to the overlying syncytiotrophoblast: if focal areas 
of syncytiotrophoblast are lost, for example due to focal 
necrosis, the defi cit is fi lled with fi brin - type fi brinoid (a 
maternal blood clot product) that covers the exposed 
cytotrophoblasts [14] . 
The Placenta and Fetal Membranes 21 
(IUGR) this physiology is likely disturbed in favour 
of greater apoptotic shedding, while in cases of pre - 
eclampsia this physiology is disturbed in favour of both 
greater apoptotic shedding and the release of necrotic and 
aponecrotic material into the maternal circulation [15,18] . 
Trophoblast release 
Throughout gestation, syncytial knots are released into 
the maternal circulation and are mostly lodged in the 
capillary bed of the lung [19 Ð 21] . Hence, they can be 
found in uterine vein blood but not in arterial or peripheral 
venous blood of a pregnant woman. It has been estimated 
that in late gestation up to 150 000 such corpuscles 
or 2 Ð 3 g of trophoblast material can enter the maternal 
circulation each day [1] . 
Current knowledge places the multinucleated syncytial 
knots as products generated by apoptotic mechanisms 
[15,20] . As such, they are surrounded by a tightly sealed 
plasma membrane not releasing any content into the 
maternal blood. Hence, induction of an infl ammatory 
response in the mother is not a normal feature of pregnancy. 
However, during placental pathologies with a 
disturbed trophoblast turnover such as pre - eclampsia, 
the release of syncytiotrophoblast material is altered 
[20,22,23] . This necrotic or aponecrotic release of trophoblast 
material could contribute to the endothelial damage 
typical of pre - eclampsia [19,20,22,23] . 
Villous stroma 
The stromal villous core comprises the population of 
fi xed and moving connective tissue cells, including: 
¥ mesenchymal cells and fi broblasts in different stages of 
differentiation up to myofi broblasts [24] ; 
¥ placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells); and 
¥ placental vessels with smooth muscle cells and endothelial 
cells [1] . 
Oxygen as regulator of villous development 
There is increasing recognition of the role that oxidative 
stress inside the placenta plays in the pathophysiology of 
pregnancy disorders ranging from miscarriage to pre - 
eclampsia [1,8,10,11,25,26] . During the fi rst trimester, 
villous trophoblast is well adapted to low oxygen, and it 
appears that trophoblast is more susceptible to raised 
oxygen rather than low oxygen [20,27] . Hence, during the 
fi rst trimester if the abembryonic part of the placenta is 
oxygenated by onset of maternal blood fl ow, villi display 
increased evidence of oxidative stress, become avascular 
and fi nally regress. These physiological changes result in 
the formation of the smooth chorion, the chorion laeve 
(see Fig. 2.3 ). 
If such early onset of maternal blood fl ow and consequently 
early onset of oxygenation also occurs in the 
embryonic part of the placenta, damage to the whole 
placenta will result. The most severe cases are missed 
Syncytiotrophoblast 
The syncytiotrophoblast is a multinucleated layer without 
lateral cell borders, hence there is a single syncytiotrophoblast 
covering all villi of a single placenta [1] . Microvilli 
on its apical surface provide amplifi cation of the surface 
(sevenfold) and are in direct contact with the maternal 
blood fl oating within the intervillous space (see Fig. 2.1 c). 
Growth and maintenance of the syncytiotrophoblast is 
dependent on the fusion with the underlying cytotrophoblasts, 
since syncytial nuclei do not proliferate. 
Within the syncytiotrophoblast the incorporated nuclei 
fi rst exhibit a large and ovoid shape, while during maturation 
they become smaller and denser. Finally, they 
display envelope convolution, increased packing density 
and increased heterochromatinization [15] . These are the 
typical features of apoptosis, a physiological process in 
the normal placenta. 
Syncytial fusion by far exceeds the needs for growth of 
the placental villi. Continuous syncytial fusion brings 
new cellular material into the syncytiotrophoblast including 
proteins like Bcl - 2 and Mcl - 1 that focally retard apoptosis 
[16] . Although a subset of syncytial nuclei is capable 
of RNA transcription in normal pregnancy [17] , syncytial 
fusion remains critical for maintaining the functional 
and structural integrity of the syncytiotrophoblast, for 
example secretion of hormones such as chorionic gonadotrophin 
and the surface expression of energy - dependent 
transporters for the uptake of molecules such as glucose 
or amino acids. Consequently, the nuclei that are incorporated 
into the syncytiotrophoblast remain within this 
layer for at least 3 Ð 4 weeks. Then, the older nuclei accumulate 
and are packed into protrusions of the apical 
membrane known as syncytial kots [15] . 
Trophoblast turnover 
Like every epithelium, the villous trophoblast exhibits the 
phenomenon of continuous turnover comprising [1] : 
1 proliferation of a subset of cytotrophoblast progenitor 
cells; 
2 differentiation of post - proliferative mononucleated 
daughter cells (2 . 3 days); 
3 syncytial fusion of fi nally differentiated cells with the 
overlying syncytiotrophoblast; 
4 further differentiation and maturation within the syncytiotrophoblast 
(3 Ð 4 weeks); 
5 ageing and late apoptosis at specifi c sites of the 
syncytiotrophoblast; 
6 packing of old material into syncytial knots; and fi nally 
7 extrusion of membrane - sealed apoptotic corpuscles 
(syncytial knots) into the maternal circulation. 
The majority of apoptotic syncytial knots are extruded 
from the syncytiotrophoblast surface into the maternal 
circulation [16] . In pathological pregnancies the molecular 
control of trophoblast differentiation is altered. In 
cases of severe early - onset intrauterine growth restriction

Layers of the c horion l aeve 
The layers of the chorion laeve, from the fetal to the 
maternal side, are as follows (Fig. 2.5 ). 
1 Amnionic epithelium . A single cuboideal epithelium 
secreting and resorbing the amnionic fl uid and involved 
in removal of carbon dioxide and pH regulation [31] . 
2 Amnionic mesoderm . A thin layer of avascular connective 
tissue separated from the amnionic epithelium by a basement 
membrane. 
3 Chorionic mesoderm . This second layer of connective 
tissue is separated from the amnionic mesoderm by 
slender fl uid - fi lled clefts. It is continuous with the connective 
tissue of the chorionic plate, which contains the 
branching vessels to and from the umbilical and villous 
vessels. 
4 Extravillous trophoblast of the fetal membranes . This specifi 
c type of extravillous trophoblast does not display 
invasive properties and is separated from the chorionic 
mesoderm by a basement membrane. 
5 Capsular decidua . This layer of maternal cells is directly 
attached to the extravillous trophoblast. At the end of the 
implantation process, the decidua closes again over the 
developing embryo, generating the capsular decidua. 
During the early second trimester, the capsular decidua 
comes into direct contact with the opposite wall of the 
uterus, causing obliteration of the uterine cavity. 
miscarriages, while less severe cases may continue but 
may lead to pathologies such as pre - eclampsia and IUGR 
[8,11] . It is becoming increasingly evident that the aetiology 
of pre - eclampsia involves increased oxidative stress, 
mostly without changes in the extravillous subset of trophoblast 
[28] . Recent data point to hyperoxic changes or 
to the occurrence of fl uctuating oxygen concentrations 
[20,29] .

is a simple epithelium that secretes and resorbs the amnionic

chorionic mesoderm) are separated by fl uid - fi lled clefts. The 
extravillous trophoblast of the fetal membranes displays a 
non - invasive phenotype and is embedded in a self - secreted 
matrix, termed matrix - type fi brinoid. Finally, on the maternal 
side, the fetal membranes are covered by the capsular decidua of 
maternal origin.

Fetal m embranes 
During early embryonic development, the amnionic cavity 
increases in size and fi nally surrounds and encases the 
complete embryo. Fluid accumulation within the amnionic 
cavity leads to complete separation of the embryo 
from surrounding extraembryonic tissues, leaving only 
the developing umbilical cord as the connection between 
placenta and embryo. The amnionic mesenchyme comes 
into direct contact with the chorionic mesoderm lining the 
inner surface of the chorionic sac (see Fig. 2.3 ). Both tissue 
layers do not fuse, and it remains that amnion and chorion 
can easily slide against each other [1,30] . 
As described above, it is only at the implantation/ 
embryonic pole that the defi nitive placenta develops. 
Owing to regression of villi, most of the surface of the 
chorionic sac (about 70%) develops in such a way that the 
early chorionic plate, together with the amnion, remnants 
of villi and the covering decidual tissues ( capsular decidua ), 
fuse and form a multilayered compact structure termed 
the chorion laeve or fetal membranes. 
The Placenta and Fetal Membranes 23 
Doppler ultrasound in placental assessment is determining 
maternal fl ow in the uterine arteries [36] . This screening 
test is performed either at the 18 Ð 20 week anatomical 
ultrasound or at a separate 22 - week visit [37] . Integration 
of placental ultrasound, uterine artery Doppler and fi rst - 
and second - trimester biochemistry screening tests (PAPP - 
A, hCG, PP13 and AFP) is an effective way of screening 
for serious placental insuffi ciency syndromes before they 
threaten fetal viability, thereby directing care to a high - 
risk pregnancy unit [38,39] . 
Pregnancies with multiparameter placental dysfunction 
in the 19 Ð 22 week window exhibit a 40% positive 
predictive value of delivery before 32 weeks due to 
clinical complications of placental insuffi ciency (IUGR, 
pre - eclampsia, abruption, stillbirth). Placental villous infarction 
complicates over 60% of such cases yet maternal 
thrombophilia is rare [38] . Since the normal healthy placenta 
expresses surface anticoagulant proteins, abnormal 
formation of the placenta may be the underlying cause of 
multifocal placental infarction. If this is the case, placental 
function testing in subsequent pregnancies may be a 
better determinant of future risk than maternal thrombophilia 
screening in the non - pregnant period. 
Colour power Doppler 
Colour power angiography (CPA) is an extented application 
in Doppler ultrasound and velocimetry. CPA 
can be used to map the vasculature within the placenta 
when combined with three - dimensional reconstruction 
(Fig. 2.6 ). This technique is able to identify red blood cells 
in vessels with a diameter of more than 200 . m [40] . 
Because the technique is three - dimensional, it can also 
be used to measure the proximal uterine arteries and 
therefore determine uterine artery blood fl ow rather 
than the descriptive assessment of the fl ow velocity waveform 
used in current practice. 
Characteristics of the chorion laeve 
After separation from the uterine wall, the fetal membranes 
have a mean thickness of about 200 Ð 300 . m at 
term [1] . The presence of the capsular decidua on the 
outer surface of the fetal membranes after delivery indicates 
that separation of the membranes takes place 
between maternal tissues rather than along the materno - 
fetal interface. Owing to the absence of vascular structures 
inside the connective tissues of the fetal membranes, 
all paraplacental exchange between fetal membranes and 
fetus has to pass the amnionic fl uid.

Ultrasound 
Using ultrasound just a few days after the expected menstrual 
period, a gestational sac with a diameter of 2 Ð 3 mm 
can be detected within the uterine endometrium. 
Developmental changes in the structure and organization 
of the placenta and membranes can be seen by ultrasound 
[32] . Minor anatomical variations, such as cysts and lakes, 
can readily be distinguished from lesions that destroy 
functioning villous tissue, such as infarcts and intervillous 
thrombi. Small placentas typically have eccentric 
cords, due to chorionic regression, and can have progressive 
parenchymal lesions, features typical of early - onset 
IUGR [33] . It is important to document placental location 
and cord insertion. Pathological placental invasion (placenta 
percreta) may be suspected by ultrasound, and can 
be confi rmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [34] . 
Doppler ultrasound 
Pulsed and colour Doppler ultrasound are valuable techniques 
for placental assessment. Umbilical cord fl ow can 
be visualized at 7 Ð 8 weeks, though end - diastolic fl ow 
(EDF) is not established until 14 weeks. Early - onset IUGR 
may be characterized by absent EDF in the umbilical 
arteries even by 22 weeks [33] , associated with small malformed 
placentas and defective angiogenesis in the gas - 
exchanging terminal placental villi [35] . A major role for

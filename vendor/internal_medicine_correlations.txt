PREFACE
Why did we go to medical school? What was
the beautiful vision of yourself in the future,
when you set out to challenge obstacles, conquer barriers and commit yourself to
medicine?
Hold On! You are ALMOST DONE!
The energy you need for your final push
lies in the sacred vision you had of yourself
when you started. Go back. Go back in time
and remember your MCAT and medical
school application essay and your personal
statement for your residency application. I
still have mine.
I wrote in flowery words about compressing all the desire of thousands of years of

23/1624

human history in the single moment of cosmic understanding that allows us to heal the
world, grow an immortal soul, have a heart
perfumed by love and bring into existence by
our own constant work a better civilization
where there are no separate groups, and
people live with hope, peace, art, music, science and freedom from fear and pain.
My faculty advisor said, “Conrad, aren’t
you weird enough already? Take that out of
your statement.”
I kept it in.
Go back to beginning. Don’t stop five
minutes too soon. What you have in your
hands will help you.
Save the world. Save the world outside
you with medicine. Save the world inside you
with hard work and eternally fragrant love.
Conrad Fischer, MD

INTRODUCTION
AND HOW TO USE
THIS BOOK
Look for the precise sequence through time
to manage the computer-based case simulation (CCS) portion of the exam. That is the
primary purpose of Correlations and Clinical Scenarios: Internal Medicine. You will
find direction on exactly how long to move
the clock forward in time and the precise sequence of which text or treatment should be
done first in managing a patient. This will
cover the order in which to give treatments,
order tests and how to respond to test

26/1624

results. All CCS-related instructions appear
in RED TYPE.
If you have never seen a particular case or
you are a physician in a specialty other than
internal medicine, this book is especially for
you. It never has statements about “using
your judgment” because you basically do not
have any in these areas. If you want a cookbook that says, “Do this, do that, do this”,
then you have the right book in your hands.
All initial case presentations and their continuing scenarios appear in yellow boxes.
This book will prepare you for the multiple choice questions that comprise the majority of the exam as well as the computerbased case simulations and the new basic
science foundations that have just been added to the exam.
USMLE Step 3 or COMLEX Part 3 is the
last phase in getting your license. Most of
you are in residency and have no time to
study. It’s totally uncool that they changed

27/1624

the exam just before YOU are about to take
it! I am 100% sure it was not meant personally to torture you alone.
Here is how to best use this book:
First read the disease or subspecialty in
any standard text book. I personally suggest
either my own Master the Boards Step 3, or
Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment.
The cases in this book are meant to further interrogate your understanding of the
subject. There are hundreds of new multiple
choice questions that are not in anyone’s Q
bank.
Every single case has numerous basic science foundations (which appear in blue
boxes) added to it so you will have a solid understanding of it simply by following along in
the case. You do not have to search through
any of your old step 1 books or basic science
texts. If I thought a basic science correlate
was important, I have put it in. If I did not
think it was important I left it out.

28/1624

Finally, I always wanted to write
something specifically for CCS. This is it. Because new test changes are frightening and
the basic science questions are new for step
3, I decided to make one book to cover both
things.
Bon appetite!

CHAPTER 1

53/1624

CARDIOLOGY
CASE 1: Pulmonary Edema
Setting: emergency department (ED)
CC: “I can’t breathe.”
VS: R: 28 breaths/minute; BP: 150/98
mm Hg; P: 118 beats/minute; T: 97°F
HPI: A 63-year-old woman presents to
the ED with shortness of breath that
started earlier in the day and worsened
over several hours. She says the dyspnea is “like swimming a whole pool underwater.” It is worsened by exertion
and relieved by sitting up.
She has a history of hypertension
and a myocardial infarction 2 years ago.

54/1624

She takes “a bunch of pills” every day,
which she cannot remember the name of.
Her physician does not have privileges at
your hospital, so the record is not
available.
ROS:
No chest pain
No history of valve disease
PE:
Chest: rales 2/3 up bilaterally
Cardiovascular: jugulovenous distention (JVD), an extra sound on
auscultation
Extremities: bilateral pitting edema up
to the knees

55/1624

What is the mechanism of the
finding on the heart examination?
a. Rapid filling of the ventricle during
diastole
b. Rupture of the chordae tendineae
c. Fibrinous exudate in between the heart
and the pericardium
d. Aberrant conduction tract at the atrioventricular (AV) node
e. Increased gradient of pressure between
the left ventricle (LV) and the aorta
Answer a. Rapid filling of the ventricle during diastole
An S3 gallop is most likely in pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure (CHF).
When the mitral valve opens in diastole, the
massive fluid overload in the lungs rapidly
spills into the ventricle making a “splash” of
fluid called an “S3 gallop.”

56/1624

Rupture of the chordae tendineae (choice
b) happens acutely as a complication of
myocardial infarction 1 to 2 weeks after the
muscle dies and necroses. Fibrinous exudate
(choice c) is the cause of a rub in pericarditis.
Aberrant conduction (choice d) is from short
PR or preexcitation syndromes such as
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.
The ausculatory finding of WPW is a loud S1
from early closure of the mitral valve. Increased gradient of pressure is from aortic
stenosis. The stenotic valve blocks flow out,
so that in severe disease, the pressure in the
LV is 50 to 70 mm Hg greater than what is
found in the aorta.

Orthopnea is venous pooling in the chest
when lying flat.

57/1624

Edema is found on examination.
What is the mechanism?
a. Decreased hydrostatic pressure of the interstitial fluid
b. Decreased oncotic pressure
c. Alteration of the diffusion coefficient (KF)
of the capillary
d. Increased hydrostatic pressure in the peripheral capillaries
e. Increased hydrostatic pressure in the
glomerular capillaries
Answer d. Increased hydrostatic pressure
in the peripheral capillaries
Peripheral edema of CHF is from back pressure from the heart resulting in increased
hydrostatic pressure in peripheral capillaries. Because of gravity, the lowest, or most
“dependent” areas of the body have the
highest hydrostatic pressure. This increases

58/1624

filtration across the capillary membrane.
There is no change in the oncotic pressure in
CHF, and the intrinsic nature of the capillary
wall, or KF, does not change.

The patient is moved from the stretcher in the triage area of the ED already

Initial Orders:

Furosemide and morphine IV
Nitroglycerin (paste cutaneously)
Chest x-ray, electrocardiogram
(ECG), arterial blood gas (ABG)

59/1624

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) for
equivocal cases when diagnosis is
uncertain
As you move the clock forward 15 to
30 minutes, the patient begins to feel
better. If a loop diuretic such as furosemide is effective, urine will be made
within 30 minutes. If not, give an additional IV dose of a loop diuretic at
least every 30 minutes until urine is
made. Make sure you repeat vital
signs in acutely ill patients every 15 to
30 minutes especially when giving
medications that can lower blood
pressure (BP) such as diuretics, nitrates, morphine, and angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
On a single-best-answer question,
never consult a cardiologist for pulmonary edema management. You are
expected to manage cases like this on

60/1624

your own. The majority of patients
with acute pulmonary edema will respond to preload reduction alone.

Nitrates:
• Mainly venous dilators
• Decrease preload more than afterload

If furosemide is not in the choices,
which drug should you choose as
an alternative that has the same
mechanism of action?
a. Spironolactone
b. Acetazolamide
c. Bumetanide

61/1624

d. Chlorthalidone
e. Conivaptan
Answer c. Bumetanide
The loop diuretics are furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and ethacrynic acid. They inhibit the Na+/K+/2Cl− pump in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This is the
site where 25% of sodium is reabsorbed in
the kidney. Spironolactone blocks aldosterone’s effect at the late distal tubule and early
collecting duct. Spironolactone and eplerenone specifically block the epithelial sodium
channel (ENaC). Acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase. It is effective at the proximal tubule and is rarely used as a diuretic and
never for acute pulmonary edema. Chlorthalidone is a thiazide diuretic inhibiting approximately 6% to 7% of total sodium absorption
at the distal tubule. Conivaptan inhibits the
V2 receptor of the collecting duct. V2-receptor antagonists are replacing demeclocycline

62/1624

in the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone
(SIADH). Conivaptan and tolvaptan exclusively block water reabsorption by blocking
antidiuretic hormone (ADH).

After a second dose of furosemide, the
patient fails to produce urine in significant amount and her shortness of
breath worsens. Her respiratory rate
increases from 26 to 36 breaths/
minute. Her BNP level is markedly elevated, but it is of marginal value in a
person who comes in with an obvious
presentation of pulmonary edema.

63/1624

Which test will make the most
difference in the management of
acute pulmonary edema?
a. BNP
b. Chest x-ray
c. ABG
d. ECG
e. Echocardiogram
Answer d. ECG
If the ECG shows an arrhythmia such as
ventricular tachycardia (VT) or atrial fibrillation (AFib) or flutter, you may be able to
quickly restore cardiac output by performing
immediate synchronized cardioversion. In a
healthy person, atrial systole provides only a
small amount to the overall LV filling and
cardiac output, on the order of 10% to 15%.
In a person with dilated cardiomyopathy or
valve disease, atrial systole or “kick” is

64/1624

essential to providing a much greater percentage, such as 30% to 50%. With cardiomyopathy, AFib can propel the patient into
flash pulmonary edema. Echocardiography
does not change acute management. It is essential to long-term treatment to know if
there is systolic or diastolic dysfunction, but
this has no effect on acute pulmonary edema
management.

You move the clock forward 10 to 20
minutes, and the results of the test are
automatically sent to you. You will receive the notice, “report available.”
ECG: Sinus tachycardia
ABG: pH 7.48; partial pressure of
carbon dioxide (PCO2) 28 mm Hg;
partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) 58
mm Hg on 50% face mask

65/1624

Chest x-ray: Pulmonary vascular
congestion, cardiac enlargement,
and pleural effusion

Pleural effusion in CHF is from increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic
pressure. The mechanism is the same as
in peripheral edema (Figure 1-1).

66/1624

Figure 1-1. Pulmonary edema. Note indistinct vasculature,
perihilar opacities, and peripheral interstitial reticular opacities. Although this is an anteroposterior film, making cardiac size more difficult to assess, the cardiac silhouette still
appears enlarged. (Reproduced with permission from Loscalzo J. Harrison’s Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,
2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill Education; 2013.)

67/1624

Atrial stretch creates BNP production.
BNP excretes water and salt through the
kidney.

Additional doses of diuretic and
morphine are given. IV nitroglycerin
is given with no effect. As you move
the clock forward, oxygen saturation
on 50% or 100% face mask hovers
near 90%. Always recheck vital signs
every 15 to 30 minutes in patients as
unstable as this. On the computerbased case simulation (CCS), you
should order a consultation with cardiology and critical care on a patient
not responding to preload reduction.
Consultants on CCS will never give
specific treatment or testing advice.

68/1624

Maximum Preload Treatment + Persistent Hypoxia = Intensive Care
Unit Placement

Morphine works by dilating pulmonary
veins and decreasing hydrostatic pressure in capillaries.

What is the mechanism of the
medication you should try next?
a. Dilation of afferent arteriole of glomerulus
b. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition
c. Vasoconstriction of arterioles
d. Positive inotrope and vasodilation

69/1624

e. Venodilation
Answer
d.
vasodilation

Positive

inotrope

and

Dobutamine acts as both a positive inotrope,
increasing contractility, and as a peripheral
vasodilator. This allows greater forward flow
of blood. Dopamine will increase contractility but is a vasoconstrictor on peripheral vessels. Dopamine increases afterload.
The patient in placed on dobutamine
and transferred to the intensive care
unit (ICU). Many patients in these circumstances are intubated for mechanical ventilation. If your case describes a
failure to improve with dobutamine or
the phosphodiesterase inhibitors milrinone or inamrinone, then intubation is
correct. Continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive

70/1624

airway pressure (BiPAP) can be tried to
keep the patient from being intubated.
Ventilators have frequent complications
with pneumonia, and CPAP or BiPAP
can save a person from this
complication.
On Step 3 CCS, it is unlikely to combine the details of acute pulmonary edema management with long-term treatment issues such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), betablockers, spironolactone, and digoxin.
These issues are addressed in separate
cases.
The final point of management addressed is why a patient develops acute
pulmonary edema. Less than 0.1% of patients with CHF are admitted in this condition. If someone presents with acute
pulmonary edema, the most likely precipitants of decompensation are

71/1624

Nonadherence to medication
Ischemia
Arrhythmia
Infection
If you see patients who are taking
their medications but still develop pulmonary edema, the most important first
step is to exclude arrhythmia. If there
are no arrhythmias, you must exclude
ischemia as a cause of decompensation.
People do not develop pulmonary edema
for no reason. Exclude coronary artery
disease when you have no clear reason
for the acute episode of pulmonary
edema.

Pulmonary Edema Precipitants

72/1624

• Ischemia
• Arrhythmia
• Infection
• Nonadherence to medications

CASE 2: Congestive Heart
Failure
CC: “I’ve been short of breath off and on
for a few months.”
VS: R: 18 breaths/minute; BP: 142/92
mm Hg; P: 78 beats/minute; T: 97°F
HPI: A 54-year-old man with a history
of hypertension for the last 5 years
presents to the ambulatory care center
with intermittent episodes of dyspnea.

73/1624

These episodes are worse with exertion,
particularly walking up stairs.
ROS:
No chest pain
No palpitation
No syncope
Occasional orthopnea and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea
PE:
Cardiovascular: no JVD, 2/6 murmur
at the apex radiating to the axilla, S4
gallop
Extremities: 2+ pitting edema

What is the mechanism of the S4
gallop on examination?
a. Rapid ventricular filling in diastole
b. Calcification of the mitral valve

74/1624

c. Atrial systole into the noncompliant
ventricle
d. Shunt from left to right
Answer c. Atrial systole into the noncompliant ventricle
Normally, the atrium should contract and
the blood will easily enter the ventricle
without a sound. This is because the ventricle should relax to receive the blood.
Hypertension causes thickening of the LV.
Compliance = volume change/pressure
change. A noncompliant ventricle exhibits a
large change in pressure with only a small
change in volume.
Calcification of the mitral valve (choice b)
is from mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis gives
a diastolic murmur. Shunt from left to right
(choice d) is a ventricular septal defect,
which gives a continuous “machinery
murmur.”

75/1624

Initial Orders:
ECG
Chest x-ray
Transthoracic echocardiogram
On a CCS case, as you move the clock
forward, results of tests will automatically be sent to your screen. You will see
the notice “report available.” In a relatively stable office or ambulatory case,
you do not have to see the patient each
time a result comes back. You can let the
test results accumulate and see the patient in 1 to 2 weeks for a case such as
this.
Test Results:
ECG: left ventricular hypertrophy, SV1
and RV5 >35 mm
Chest x-ray: left ventricular
hypertrophy

76/1624

Echocardiogram: dilated left ventricle;
32% ejection fraction (EF); modest
mitral regurgitation (MR)
Some segmental wall motion abnormalities present
Because of dilated cardiomyopathy, you
start an ACE inhibitor, such as lisinopril
or enalapril. CCS does not allow you to
test doses, and you cannot order medications by class name. You must enter
“lisinopril” on a CCS case, and are not
allowed to order just “ACE inhibitor.” In
a single-best-answer question, never order a cardiology consultation in a CHF
case. You are expected to manage CHF
without consultation. The only way to
know if this person had systolic or diastolic dysfunction is with echocardiogram. Hypertension initially gives hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but over
time, the heart tires and begins to dilate.

77/1624

This can eventually lead to a dilated
cardiomyopathy.

What is the main difference
between ACE inhibitors?
a. Efficacy in lowering mortality in CHF
b. Usefulness in hypertension
c. Dosing
d. Propensity to cause cough
e. Propensity to cause hyperkalemia
Answer c. Dosing
The only major difference between ACE inhibitors is dosing. All lower mortality in
systolic dysfunction and all cause cough and
hyperkalemia.

78/1624

ACE increases bradykinin, which causes
cough.

ACE inhibitors increase potassium by
blocking aldosterone release.

Which of the following is most
likely to lower this patient’s
mortality?
a. Metoprolol
b. Digoxin
c. Furosemide
d. Spironolactone
e. Hydrochlorothiazide
Answer a. Metoprolol

79/1624

Beta-blockers lower mortality in systolic dysfunction. The effect of beta-blockers is not
ubiquitous to the entire class of medications.
Beta-blockers useful for CHF are:
• Metoprolol
• Carvedilol
• Bisoprolol
Digoxin does not lower mortality in CHF.
Spironolactone is most useful in severe class
III and IV CHF in which there is dyspnea
with minimal exertion or at rest. Loop diuretics such as furosemide are frequently used
to decrease fluid overload, but they do not
lower mortality. Thiazide diuretics are used
for hypertension, but the effect in CHF is not
beneficial beyond just controlling BP.

The patient returns a week after starting the ACE inhibitor and beta-

80/1624

blocker. He denies having a cough, but
his dyspnea is not improved. You increase the dose, and on follow-up a
week later, he is still symptomatic.
Spironolactone is added orally. Although spironolactone was invented
as a potassium-sparing diuretic, the
dose used in CHF is well below the diuretic dose. Like most medications in
CHF that lower mortality, it is used to
inhibit the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Loop diuretics such as
furosemide are used to control symptoms of fluid overload such as edema.
Two weeks later, the patient’s symptoms of dyspnea are well controlled.

Which should you test for?
a. Potassium level
b. Sodium level

81/1624

c. Repeat echocardiogram
d. Holter (24-hour) ambulatory ECG
monitor
e. Urine electrolytes
Answer a. Potassium level
All the medications the patient is on can alter the potassium level. ACE inhibitors, betablockers, and mineralocorticoid-receptor
blockers such as spironolactone can increase
potassium levels, and furosemide can lower
potassium levels. Although CHF and a number of the medications used can alter sodium
levels, there is no point in routinely monitoring the blood or urine sodium level because
there is nothing you will do different therapeutically. In the absence of symptoms,
neither the Holter monitor nor echocardiogram are useful. To assess intermittent arrhythmia, such as nonsustained VT or AFib,
24-hour ambulatory ECG or Holter

82/1624

monitoring is useful. If there is severe hyperkalemia with the use of ACE inhibitors or
ARBs, the solution is to switch to hydralazine
and nitrates. This combination both dilates
arterioles directly with hydralazine and
dilates coronary arteries so blood is not
“stolen” away from the coronary arteries.

Furosemide inhibits potassium reabsorption at the thick ascending limb of
the loop of Henle.

If there are persistent symptoms despite the use of ACE inhibitors, betablockers, spironolactone, and loop diuretics, the next medication to add is
digoxin. Digoxin does not lower mortality. This is the most commonly

83/1624

tested point about digoxin. It decreases symptoms and decreases rates
of hospitalization, but does not lower
mortality.

Which of these is most likely to
inhibit androgens?
a. Enalapril
b. Losartan
c. Carvedilol
d. Spironolactone
e. Digoxin
f. Furosemide
g. Indapamide
h. Hydrochlorothiazide
Answer d. Spironolactone

84/1624

Spironolactone is a direct antagonist of the
androgens
(dehydroepiandrosterone
[DHEA] and androstenedione) that originate
from the adrenal gland as well as an inhibitor of the gonadal androgen testosterone. It
inhibits both the receptor as well as androgen production. When this occurs, switch
spironolactone to eplerenone. Eplerenone
has a proven mortality benefit without the
antiandrogenic adverse effects. Spironolactone is so antiandrogenic that it is used with
the specific therapeutic intent of inhibiting
androgens in women with acne, hirsutism,
and male pattern hair loss.
The vast majority of cases of CHF are
controlled with ACE inhibitors, betablockers, spironolactone, diuretics, and
digoxin. If the patient is still short of
breath, and the QRS interval is wide,
resynchronization with a biventricular

85/1624

pacemaker is very useful in getting
both ventricles to contract together. An
implantable defibrillator will decrease
mortality, but because its only function
is to restart the heart if the person actually has sudden death, it will not decrease symptoms.
Ultimately, cardiac transplantation
is sometimes needed if there are persistent symptoms despite maximum medical
therapy.

Do not combine ACE with ARB medication. Combining will not improve morbidity or lower mortality.

86/1624

Which decreases mortality in
diastolic dysfunction?
a. Metoprolol
b. Digoxin
c. Furosemide
d. Enalapril
e. Eplerenone
f. Valsartan
g. Nothing is proven to lower mortality in
diastolic dysfunction.
Answer g. Nothing is proven to lower mortality in diastolic dysfunction.
Diastolic dysfunction is also called “heart
failure with preserved EF” because there is a
normal EF. There is no medication that is
clearly proven to lower mortality in this diastolic dysfunction. We use beta-blockers, diuretics, and sometimes calcium channel

87/1624

blockers (CCBs), but that does not mean they
are proven to lower mortality.

The most accurate method for assessing
EF is nuclear ventriculogram or multigated angiogram (MUGA). Nucleotide angiography surpasses echocardiogram for
accuracy of EF measurement.

CASE 3: Acute Coronary
Syndrome
Setting: ED
CC: “My chest hurts, Doc.”
VS: R: 23 breaths/minute; BP: 144/94
mm Hg; P: 104 beats/minute; T: 99.8°F

88/1624

HPI: A 68-year-old man who has had
crushing, substernal chest pain for the
past 15 to 20 minutes arrives at the ED.
He immediately called 911 for an ambulance right after the pain began. He has
had “chest discomfort” a few times before when walking up stairs in his
home, but it was a “vague soreness” that
lasted 1 to 2 minutes and stopped right
after he got to the top of the stairs.
Today, the pain was more severe in intensity and did not stop.

Cardiovascular: normal
Lung sounds normal
Head, ears, eyes, nose, throat

On the CCS, choose parts of the physical
examination based on what could be
abnormal.

Initial Orders:
ECG
Creatine kinase myocardial band (CKMB)
Troponin
Myoglobin
Aspirin
Nitroglycerin sublingual

90/1624

Morphine

All patients admitted to the hospital
need complete blood counts (CBCs), urinalysis (UA), basic metabolic panels,
and chest x-rays.

As the clock is moved forward 15 to 20
minutes, the CK-MB, troponin, and
myoglobin levels all revert to normal.
The ECG shows ST-segment elevation
in leads V2 through V4. The patient describes his pain as “sore, squeezing,
and pressure-like.” He is somewhat
short of breath.

91/1624

What test becomes abnormal
first?
a. CK-MB
b. Troponin
c. Myoglobin
Answer c. Myoglobin
Myoglobin level increases as early as 1 to 4
hours after the onset of myocardial damage.
Elevation of myoglobin level is absolutely not
specific to cardiac muscle. You do not see an
elevated myoglobin level because of its specificity to heart tissue. You order a myoglobin test because a normal test at 4 hours
strongly excludes a current infarction. CKMB and troponin levels do not begin to increase until 4 to 6 hours after the onset of
damage.

92/1624

What is the mechanism of the
drug you should add?
a. Blockade of P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate
(ADP) receptor
b. Potentiation of antithrombin III
c. Thrombin inhibition
d. Plasmin inhibition
e. Dihydropyridine receptor inhibition
Answer a. Blockade of P2Y12 ADP receptor
All patients with unstable angina (acute
coronary syndrome [ACS]) need two antiplatelet medications. A second drug is added
to aspirin. Clopidogrel, prasugrel, and
ticagrelor work through inhibiting the ADP
receptor on the platelet. Heparin is not as
useful in an acute ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (MI) as it is in unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation
MI (NSTEMI).

93/1624

• Potentiation of antithrombin III = heparin
• Thrombin inhibition = argatroban,
lepirudin
• Plasmin inhibition = aminocaproic acid
(This is always wrong in coronary
syndromes.)
• Dihydropyridine receptor inhibition = CCB

Aspirin and clopidogrel are started.
Nitroglycerin, morphine, ACE inhibitor, metoprolol, and a statin are given
as well. Medications on CCS are considered to be administered as soon as
you verify them on the electronic order
system. There is no time delay to drug
administration on CCS. There is a
modest improvement in pain and no
change in vital signs. Angioplasty is
superior to thrombolytics in terms of
outcomes such as mortality, incidence

94/1624

of CHF, and recurrences of chest pain.
Only 20% of hospitals in the United
States can do urgent angioplasty with
intervention. Your question will
clearly tell you if the catheterization
laboratory is close enough to get the
balloon inflated within 90 minutes of
the patient with chest pain arriving at
the ED.

Up to how long after the onset of
chest pain should thrombolytics
be given?
a. 30 minutes
b. 90 minutes
c. 3 hours
d. 4.5 hours
e. 12 hours

95/1624

Answer e. 12 hours
Thrombolytics are useful for an ST-segment
elevation MI for 12 hours after the onset of
pain. They do not work for NSTEMI. Use
them for 3 to 4.5 hours for a stroke. It is very
easy to confuse the question “how long after
onset of pain” with “how long after coming
to the ED” should thrombolytics be used.
Once in the ED, you should have thrombolytics in the patient’s needle within 30 minutes
of coming to the door.

Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is
good for 12 hours after onset of chest
pain.

96/1624

TPA is used only for chest pain with ST
elevation and new left bundle branch
block (LBBB).

The patient is at a hospital with an interventional cardiac catheterization
laboratory. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is performed. A
sirolimus-coated stent is placed and the
vessel diameter is increased in size
from 2 mm to 4 mm.

What is the increase in the
amount of flow with this increase
in vessel size?
a. 2×
b. 4×

97/1624

c. 8×
d. 16×
Answer d. 16×
Use Poiseuille’s equation: Flow is proportional to the radius raised to the fourth
power. So a doubling in radius or diameter
will increase flow by 2 × 2 × 2 or 16 times.
Flow is inversely proportional to the length
of the tube and the viscosity of the liquid.
Length and viscosity cannot be changed in
coronary syndromes.
This equation explains why interventions
that increase the interior lumen diameter are
the ones that improve flow and mortality.
Beta-blockers such as metoprolol lower mortality, but they are not as dependent on time.
In other words, although it is urgent to deliver anticoagulants and PCI, you are not
pressed for time in administering betablockers.

Cardiovascular: systolic murmur,
crescendo-decrescendo heard best in
the second right intercostal area

Where will the murmur radiate
to?
a. Axilla
b. Lower left sternal border
c. Carotids
Answer c. Carotids
Aortic stenosis (AS) murmur will project up
the aorta toward the direction of the carotid
arteries. MR radiates to the axilla. MR is
pansystolic (or holosystolic) and will obscure
hearing either S1 or S2. Aortic regurgitation

101/1624

(AR) radiates down the lower left sternal
border. AR is a diastolic decrescendo
murmur.

Why is there a delay between the
closure of the mitral and tricuspid
valves (S1) and the beginning of
the murmur?
a. Insufficient backflow of blood
b. Rapid aortic filling
c. Isovolumetric contraction
d. Isovolumetric relaxation
e. Shunt circulation
Answer c. Isovolumetric contraction
At the start of ventricular contraction, blood
does not move across the aortic valve. It
takes time for actin and myosin filaments to
shorten and to increase LV pressure to the

102/1624

point where blood moves. Blood does not
move until it exceeds diastolic pressure,
which is usually around 80 mm Hg. When
LV pressure exceeds diastolic pressure, the
aortic valve will open and blood will exit the
LV and enter the aorta. This is when the
murmur occurs.
The murmur of AS is delayed after S1 until LV pressure increases enough to open the
aortic valve.
No Blood Movement = No Murmur

On auscultation, maneuvers are performed in the office to see what the
diagnosis is, before an echocardiogram is performed. Squatting and leg
raise increase venous return to the
heart. Standing suddenly and the
Valsalva maneuver will decrease venous return to the he art. This patient’s

103/1624

murmur of AS will become louder with
squatting and leg raises and quieter
with standing and Valsalva
maneuvers.

AS narrows the aortic valve.
According to the Reynolds
number, as diameter decreases,
turbulence should decrease. Why
does the narrowing caused by AS
provide turbulence enough to
produce a murmur, if the total
flow is decreased?
a. Viscosity increases.
b. Viscosity decreases.
c. Velocity increases more than diameter
decreases.

104/1624

d. Increased filling actually increases total
flow in AS.
e. Dilated cardiomyopathy compensates.
Answer c. Velocity increases more than
diameter decreases.
Velocity is inversely proportional to surface
area. As the surface area decreases, velocity
increases. However, the velocity increases
with the value of πr2. Hence, you have less
blood moving through the aortic valve, much
faster. Flow is down, velocity is up. This is
what creates the turbulence that produces a
murmur that you can hear.

105/1624

Initial Orders and Results:
Chest x-ray: left ventricular hypertrophy, clear lung fields
ECG: left ventricular hypertrophy
Echocardiogram: aortic stenosis, symmetrical ventricular hypertrophy

Oximeter: normal
The patient returns to discuss the findings with you after several weeks. His
symptoms of breathlessness are about
the same.

Which therapy will decrease the
progression of AS?
a. Diuretics
b. ACE inhibitors
c. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)
d. Beta-blockers
e. CCBs
f. None
Answer f. None
No medication has ever been shown to decrease the rate of progression of AS. AS is an

107/1624

idiopathic disorder of increasing fibrosis,
sclerosis, and calcification of the aortic valve
(Figure 1-2). None of these medications will
decrease progression, and some, such as diuretics, can be dangerous in terms of decreasing LV filling pressure.

You move the clock forward 3 to 6
months on a CCS case. The patient reports worsening dyspnea and he has
had an episode of syncope. You recommend valve repair. He is now 79 years
old.

Which is best for this patient?
a. Balloon valvuloplasty
b. Open aortic valve commissurotomy
c. Replace with metal valve
d. Replace with bioprosthetic valve
Answer d. Replace with bioprosthetic valve

109/1624

Balloon valvuloplasty is not a good choice for
stenotic aortic valves. The valve will only
restenose and worsen. In addition, the procedure may simply create aortic regurgitation. The same is true of an open
commissurotomy.
Replacement of aortic valves is clearly the
best choice when symptoms of shortness of
breath or syncope develop. A bioprosthetic
valve is preferred because it does not need
anticoagulation with warfarin. On average it
will last 10 years, but in an elderly, relatively
sedentary person, it may last 15 years. Metal
valves need an international normalized ratio (INR) higher than 2 to 3 because metal
valves are so thrombogenic. This puts an elderly person at very high risk of bleeding.
The patient refuses to undergo valve
replacement surgery. He says, “I’m too
old,” and leaves the office. He comes

110/1624

back a few months later. His exercise
tolerance has decreased, and he becomes dyspneic even walking across his
own living room. He had two more
episodes of syncope. He is now ready
for valve replacement.

What test should you do prior to
surgery?
a. Holter monitor
b. Troponin or CK-MB
c. Arterial blood gas
d. Cardiac catheterization
e. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
Answer d. Cardiac catheterization
There is a very high incidence of coronary
artery disease in those with AS. Frequently,

111/1624

simultaneous coronary bypass surgery is
done in 50% to 70% of patients. Troponin
and CK-MB testing are only for ACS. A PET
scan measures the uptake of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose. It is useful to tell the content of solid
lesions to see if there is cancer inside. Cancers generally have an increased metabolic
rate of glucose, and the PET scan will light
up with a cancer.

Which has the shortest survival in
AS?
a. Syncope
b. Angina
c. CHF
d. Left ventricular hypertrophy
Answer c. CHF
By the time the heart dilates in size, nothing
can be done to restore it to normal size and

112/1624

shape. This is why replacement of the aortic
valve should occur before cardiac dilation
has occurred. Angina is the most common
and earliest finding of AS and can be easily
reversed by coronary bypass surgery.

CASE 5: Mitral Stenosis
Setting: office or ambulatory clinic
CC: “I get short of breath.”
VS: R: 26 breaths/minute; BP: 108/72
mm Hg; P: 104 beats/minute; T: 99.8°F
HPI: A 26-year-old woman comes to
the office with increasing shortness of
breath and palpitations over the last
several months. She also has hemoptysis. She emigrated from South America
several years ago. She has no fever.
PMHX: rheumatic fever as a child

113/1624

Medications: none
PE:
Cardiovascular:
Third heart sound in diastole just after
S2
Diastolic rumbling murmur
All heard best at apex
Loud S1

What is the basis of the loud S1?
a. Calcium is crunchy.
b. Fibrous bands are being broken.
c. The mitral valve is still open when LV
pressure becomes high.
d. AFib eliminates atrial systole.
e. There is left ventricular noncompliance.

114/1624

Answer c. The mitral valve is still open
when LV pressure becomes high.
S1 is created by the sound of the mitral valve
closing. The loudness is created by a delay in
closure from fibrous tissue delaying its
movement. This means LV pressure builds to
a much higher level before it closes than it
would in a healthy person. It is like “slamming” a stuck door.
The sound is not caused by breaking
either calcium or fibrous tissue. AFib does
not impair mitral closure in anyone. The LV
has normal compliance in mitral stenosis
(MS). MS is a problem with emptying the atrium that has nothing to do with LV
compliance.

Rheumatic fever is by far the most common cause of MS.

115/1624

Loud S1 is a “slam of the door.”

What causes the hemoptysis?
a. Tricuspid stenosis
b. Left-to-right shunting
c. Right-to-left shunting
d. Pulmonary hypertension
e. Atrial septal defect
Answer d. Pulmonary hypertension
Stenosis of the mitral valve causes pulmonary hypertension. This “stretches” the vessels
of the pulmonary vasculature until they
burst. It is a kind of super-exaggerated increase in the hydrostatic pressure of the pulmonary veins to the point where the integrity
of the delicate pulmonary capillaries bursts.

116/1624

The majority of the symptoms of MS can
be related back to the pulmonary
hypertension.
• Dyspnea and orthopnea
• Ascites, edema, and hepatosplenomegaly if
right heart failure occurs

Besides obstruction of flow, which
of these contributes to create
pulmonary hypertension?
a. Increased carbon dioxide (CO2) content
b. Decreased pH
c. Hypoxia
d. Respiratory alkalosis
Answer c. Hypoxia
Hypoxia constricts pulmonary blood vessels.
Pulmonary vasculature has profound autoregulatory controls that shunt blood flow away
from the hypoxic parts of the lung. This is

117/1624

because flow in the lungs is supposed to collect oxygen, therefore, vasoconstriction in
hypoxic areas is to decrease flow away from
those areas. If the whole lung has hypoxic
flow, there will be a global vasoconstriction
of the pulmonary vessels.

Pulmonary hypertension is the root of
all MS symptoms.

The patient has been getting progressively more short of breath. Although
dyspnea used to occur only with significant exertion, it is now interfering
with the patient’s ability to walk up
stairs. She occasionally has palpitations. An ECG in the office shows normal sinus rhythm.

118/1624

Initial Orders:
Chest x-ray
Echocardiogram
Basic metabolic panel (CHEM-7)
Sodium-restricted diet
Furosemide orally
As you move the clock forward 3 to 4
days, the results come back as:
Chest x-ray:
Straightening of left heart border, elevation of left mainstem bronchus,
second density behind the heart
Echocardiogram:
Moderate MS with marked dilation
of left atrium (LA)
Valve diameter 1.2 cm2
No thrombi in atrium
Mild calcification of mitral valve

119/1624

Chemistry:
Sodium 129 mEq/L (normal 135−145
mEq/L)
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 24 mg/dL
(normal 6−14 mg/dL)

On chest x-ray, what elevates the
left mainstem bronchus?
a. The LV pushes it up.
b. The LA pushes it up.
c. The pulmonary artery is enlarged.
d. The right ventricle (RV) is hypertrophic.
Answer b. The LA pushes it up.
The LA is the most posterior structure in the
heart. It sits behind the heart and can appear
as a “double density” behind the heart. LA
enlargement obliterates the aortopulmonary

120/1624

knob or window on the left-hand side (Figure 1-3).

121/1624

What is the mechanism of
hyponatremia and high BUN?
a. From sodium-restricted diet
b. Atrial natriuretic peptide
c. Decreased aldosterone level
d. Decreased permeability of collecting duct
e. Decreased stimulation macula densa
Answer b. Increased ADH and atrial natriuretic peptide
Stretching of the atrium releases atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) as it does in all forms of
CHF or anything that increases fluid in the
heart. It is very hard to decrease serum sodium levels just from a sodium-restricted diet.
Low tissue perfusion and decreased sodium
load to the kidney should increase stimulation of the macula densa and increase renin
and not decrease it. Both low perfusion of
the juxtaglomerular complex and stimulation

122/1624

of the macula densa will increase aldosterone
levels, not decrease them in any form of
CHF.
Low perfusion pressure of the carotid
body will signal the brain to make more ADH
in the hypothalamus. Increased ADH increases the permeability of the collecting
duct; it does not decrease it. Increased permeability of the collecting duct will reabsorb
free water into the body, not lose free water.
Decreased renal perfusion results in prerenal azotemia and an elevation of BUN. This
is true of cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, or
CHF.

Which finding will be present on
ECG?
a. SV1 + RV5 >35 mm
b. Enlarged P wave in V1
c. Biphasic P wave in V1

123/1624

d. aVL >13 mm
Answer c. Biphasic P wave in V1
A biphasic P wave in V1 is a sign of left atrial
hypertrophy. The LA is the most posterior
structure in the heart. Enlargement will pull
electrical forces away from the anterior chest
wall. The first deflection will be upright from
the right atrium. The second deflection will
be sharply posterior from the enlarged LA,
pulling the electricity backward.
SV1 + RV5 > 35 mm or aVL > 13 mm =
Left Ventricular Hypertrophy
Enlarged P wave in V1 = Right Atrial
Hypertrophy
Muscle = Electricity on Electrocardiogram
More Muscle = More Electricity

124/1624

The patient comes back in 2 weeks to
discuss her test results. Her symptoms
are not better despite diuretics and
salt restriction. Palpitations are more
frequent. An in-office ECG shows AFib.
You offer the patient balloon valvuloplasty, but she declines it. Metoprolol
is started to control her heart rate. The
patient does not return for 6 months.
She is pregnant and her obstetrician
has referred her to you because of
markedly worse dyspnea, palpitations, and the new onset of dysphagia
(Figure 1-4).

125/1624

ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

126/1624

Dysphagia in MS is from an enlarged LA
pressing on the esophagus.

Plasma volume increases by 50% in
pregnancy, worsening fluid overload in
MS.

What is the mechanism of the
increase in plasma volume in
pregnancy?
a. Red blood cell production decreases.
b. Aldosterone level increases.
c. The maximum osmolarity of urine
decreases.
d. Hypothalamic osmoreceptors reset and
ADH level increases.

127/1624

e. Glomerular filtration rate decreases.
Answer d. Hypothalamic osmoreceptors reset and ADH level increases.
Pregnancy changes the level at which the osmolarity receptors in the hypothalamus
would shut off ADH production. ADH secretion continues at an osmolarity of 280
mOsm when a nonpregnant person would
have it shut off. Pregnancy increases the
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increases permeability of the collecting duct,
thereby increasing free water reabsorption.
The patient agrees to balloon valvuloplasty in the sixth month of her pregnancy, which markedly relieves symptoms. To control her heart rate, metoprolol is continued.

128/1624

Beta-blockers and calcium channel
blockers are safe in pregnancy.

Endocarditis prophylaxis is not used for
MS.

CASE 6: Atrial Fibrillation
Setting: ED
CC: “I feel a fluttering in my chest.”
VS: R: 32 breaths/minute; BP: 118/88
mm Hg; P:128 beats/minute, irregularly irregular; T: 98.1°F
HPI: A 42-year-old gastroenterologist
comes to the office with 1 single day of

129/1624

palpitations and fluttering in his chest.
He has never had this before. He denies
chest pain, light-headedness, or shortness of breath. He is very anxious. He
drinks a large amount of vodka at night
four to five times a week and frequently
travels to present papers at international meetings.
PMHX: none
Medications: none
Each part of the physical examination
on CCS takes the same amount of time,
no matter the case.
PE:

Extremities: no edema

130/1624

Initial Orders:
ECG
CHEM-7
Chest x-ray
Oximeter
CBC
As you move the clock forward 10 to 20
minutes, all the laboratory results come
back as normal except for the ECG. The
ECG shows AFib at a rate of 125 to 130
beats/minute. The QRS duration is normal (Figure 1-5).

Medicine, A Comprehensive Study Guide, 7th ed. New York:
McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

When is immediate electrical
cardioversion for AFib correct?
a. Palpitations not improved with
medication
b. Severe anxiety
c. Pallor, sweating, and decreased capillary
refill
d. BP 78/50 mm Hg and chest pain
Answer d. BP 78/50 mm Hg and chest pain
Electrical cardioversion is indicated for tachyarrhythmias when there is life-threatening hemodynamic instability, such as chest
pain, CHF caused by the arrhythmia, decreased systolic BP, or hemodynamically related confusion.

132/1624

Although uncomfortable, none of the other symptoms described here are severe
enough to put the patient through the risk
and discomfort of electrical cardioversion.
Pallor, anxiety, sweating, and palpitations
are all subjective, hard to measure, and not
life-threatening.

Cardioversion works by causing the simultaneous depolarization of all the myocytes in the heart.

What is the most common cause
of AFib?
a. Caffeine
b. Cocaine
c. Hypertension
d. Hyperthyroidism

133/1624

e. Ischemia (coronary disease)
Answer c. Hypertension
AFib occurs most commonly as a result of
structural abnormalities of the heart caused
by hypertension, cardiomyopathy, or valvular heart disease.
Although it is commonly believed that
caffeine causes AFib, this has not been
shown to be true. Caffeine and cocaine can
speed up rate-controlled atrial arrhythmia,
but it is unlikely that caffeine alone can
cause AFib in a normal heart.
Hyperthyroidism can cause AFib, but it is
a far less common cause than hypertensive
heart disease. It is rare for ischemia or
coronary disease to present with AFib in the
absence of other structural heart disease.

The patient is uncomfortable from
palpitations but is

134/1624

hemodynamically stable. What
treatment is first?
a. Quinidine
b. Heparin
c. Warfarin
d. Metoprolol
e. Depends on results of the echocardiogram
Answer d. Metoprolol
Rate control with either a beta-blocker, CCB,
or digoxin is the first step in managing rapid
AFib. Rate control is more important than
trying medications such as quinidine, amiodarone, flecainide, or propafenone to chemically convert AFib into normal sinus
rhythm. Anticoagulation is not needed for
AFib present for <48 hours. The echocardiogram results may help tell who needs anticoagulation, but controlling the rapid

135/1624

ventricular response is not dependent on
echocardiogram findings.

What is the mechanism of rate
control in AFib or flutter (Figure
1-6)?

Figure 1-6. Atrial flutter. (Reproduced with permission
from Conrad Fischer.)

136/1624

a. Inhibition of “Funny” sodium channels in
the sinoatrial (SA) node
b. Stimulation of outward potassium
channels
c. Inhibition of conduction in the AV node
d. Blocking Purkinje fibers
Answer c. Inhibition of conduction in the
AV node
Any beta-blocker will work to slow AV nodal
conduction in atrial arrhythmias. Only the
CCBs diltiazem or verapamil slow conduction to control rapid rate.

Alcohol intoxication causes atrial
fibrillation.

137/1624

After metoprolol or diltiazem, the patient’s heart rate reduces to 80 beats/
minute. All symptoms resolve. Admittance to the ICU is not necessary and
the patient is placed on a regular hospital ward. Heparin is not necessary.
The echocardiogram shows a normal
heart size and shape with no significant valvular disease and no thrombi.
The AFib does not stop, but the rate remains controlled and there are no
symptoms.

What is the best therapy?
a. Aspirin
b. Warfarin
c. Dabigatran
d. Rivaroxaban

138/1624

Answer a. Aspirin
CHADS is an acronym for risk factors for
stroke in AFib. If the CHADS score is 0 or 1,
aspirin alone is sufficient. If the CHADS
score is 2 or more, use warfarin, dabigatran,
or rivaroxaban.
C = Congestive heart failure
H = Hypertension
A = Age > 75 years
D = Diabetes
S = Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (Either of these alone
is worth 2 points and indicates
automatic anticoagulation
medication.)
This patient has a CHADS score of zero,
and aspirin alone is sufficient.

139/1624

Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor. No INR monitoring is needed.

Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor. No
INR monitoring is needed.

CASE 7: Supraventricular
Tachycardia, Ventricular
Tachycardia, and WolffParkinson-White Syndrome
Setting: ED
CC: “I think I have palpitations.”
VS: R: 34 breaths/minute; BP: 138/88
mm Hg; P: 160 beats/minute; T: 99.8°F

140/1624

HPI: A 19-year-old woman presents to
the ED complaining of palpitations. She
is anxious and her chest is uncomfortable from the rapid heart rate. She is
not confused, and there is no “chest
pain.” She is a generally healthy person,
and this is the first time she has been to
an ED. She drank four Red Bull energy
drinks today.
PMHX: none
Medications: none
Initial Orders:
CHEM-7
CBC
Echocardiogram
ECG
Calcium and magnesium levels

141/1624

What does the ECG show (Figure
1-7)?

Figure 1-7. Supraventricular tachycardia. (Reproduced
with permission from Conrad Fischer.)

a. AFib
b. Atrial flutter
c. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)
d. VT

142/1624

Answer c. Supraventricular tachycardia
(SVT)
The first part of the ECG reading, on the left,
shows sinus rhythm because of the presence
of P waves and a normal QRS duration <100
msec. On the right, there is a narrow complex (<100 msec) tachycardia with no P
waves, no fibrillatory waves, and no flutter
waves. That is the definition of SVT. If there
are clear P waves, then it is not SVT.

SVT and atrial flutter are regular in
rhythm. Fibrillation is irregular.

What is the mechanism of the
patient’s SVT today?
a. Caffeine
b. Ischemia

143/1624

c. Abnormal conduction pathway at the AV
node
d. Ectopic focus in the ventricle
e. Thrombus in the atrium
Answer c. Abnormal conduction pathway
at the AV node
The vast majority of SVT is based on abnormal “wiring” at the AV node or an AV nodal
reentry. Caffeine does not create SVT. Ischemia is a prominent cause of ventricular
arrhythmias but, virtually never, atrial arrhythmias. Ectopic ventricular foci create
VT, not SVT. AFib leads to stasis in the atrium that creates thrombi, but thrombi do not
create SVT.

The patient is lying on her stretcher
continuing to feel palpitations. Her BP
is now 112/82 mm Hg. Carotid sinus

144/1624

massage is attempted, but it is not effective. Adenosine is given with two
sequential boluses, but the SVT persists. Move the clock forward 5 to
10 minutes on CCS after vagal maneuvers and adenosine administration.

Carotid massage increases vagal tone to
convert SVT.

Adenosine most often works to convert
SVT.

145/1624

If you are uncertain about patient status,
click on “Interval History” to getan
update.

Because the patient is hemodynamically stable, there is no indication for
cardioversion. Palpitations do not
count as hemodynamic instability. BP
remains at 118/80 mm Hg. Diltiazem
or verapamil is given as an IV bolus,
and you move the clock forward 5 to
10 minutes. All IV agents that may potentially affect the cardiac conduction
system should be given under telemetry or continuous cardiac monitoring. The telemetry monitor now shows
VT (Figure 1-8).

146/1624

What should you do first?
a. Consult cardiology.
b. Transfer the patient to the ICU.
c. Check vital signs.
d. Perform synchronized cardioversion.
e. Perform unsynchronized cardioversion.
Answer c. Check vital signs.
Any change in a patient’s cardiac rhythm requires the BP to be checked immediately. If

147/1624

VT results in hypotension, you need immediate synchronized cardioversion. If VT persists, but BP stays normal, use amiodarone
first, possibly followed by lidocaine or procainamide if there is no response to
amiodarone.
Do not ever order consultations for a
person who is unstable and needs immediate
help. The CCS Step 3 examination expects
you to help the patient, not to defer responsibility. On CCS, consultants never tell you
what to do. They just say “I saw your patient;
I have no specific recommendations. Do
what you think is right.”
Do not ever transfer an unstable or potentially unstable patient to another part of
the hospital without first starting treatment
and ordering tests. Both a transfer and a
consultation are inappropriate first responses on the Step 3 examination because
they make you look like an idiot who cannot
care for a sick patient.

148/1624

Shock Unstable Ventricular Tachycardia
Unstable =
• Chest pain
• Systolic <90 mm Hg
• CHF
• Confusion from hypoperfusion

As you order vital signs, the clock will
automatically move forward 2
minutes. If you have not already done
so, order calcium, magnesium, oxygen, and potassium levels. Low levels
of all of these are associated with developing arrhythmias, particularly
ventricular arrhythmias. Do not wait
for the results to give magnesium. Giving magnesium can help correct
ventricular arrhythmia. Do not give

149/1624

calcium or potassium without being
sure the level is low.
When the clock is moved forward 2
minutes, the patient’s BP is 140/90 mm
Hg. Palpitations are the only symptom.
VT persists.

What should you do?
a. Perform synchronized cardioversion.
b. Perform unsynchronized cardioversion.
c. Give amiodarone.
d. Give quinidine.
Answer c. Give amiodarone.
Use amiodarone first for hemodynamically
stable VT. Amiodarone is a clear first choice
as an antiarrhythmic for both VT and
ventricular fibrillation. Although lidocaine is
a second-line drug, Step 3 does not put you

150/1624

in “hairsplitting” decisions where lidocaine
could be a choice. The wrong answers are
clearly wrong. Quinidine is a rarely used
class Ia agent for atrial arrhythmias, and
there is no point in cardioverting VT until
medications have been tried and failed.

After amiodarone, the rhythm converts to normal sinus at a rate of 70
beats/minute. Symptoms of palpitations resolve.

What most likely led to this
situation in which SVT
deteriorates to VT after the use of
verapamil?
a. Dilated cardiomyopathy
b. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
c. WPW syndrome

151/1624

d. Brugada syndrome
Answer c. WPW syndrome
WPW is notorious for worsening after the
use of CCBs (Figure 1-9). WPW is one of the
only syndromes to alternate SVT with VT.
Dilated cardiomyopathy may have worsening
systolic function with the use of a prominent
negative inotrope such as verapamil, but
neither dilated nor hypertrophic cardiomyopathy alone will result in an arrhythmia just
from use of a CCB.

153/1624

Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder
leading to syncope and sudden death in association with a right bundle branch block
pattern on an ECG. It is more common in
persons of Asian ethnicity.

What is the mechanism of
arrhythmia formation in WPW?
a. Elimination of normal AV node
b. Bundle branch block in ventricles
c. Accessory bundle of Kent
d. Loss of normal calcium channel in the AV
node
Answer c. Accessory bundle of Kent
WPW is an anatomic defect in the conduction system of the AV node. An abnormal accessory pathway is present. Calcium channel
blocking medications produce blockade in
the normal AV nodal tissue forcing cardiac

154/1624

conduction down the abnormal accessory
pathway in the bundle of Kent. This can lead
to either SVT or VT, although SVT is more
common.

Besides the CCBs that were used
in this patient, what is the
medication most dangerous in
WPW?
a. Digoxin
b. Beta-blockers
c. Procainamide
d. Sotalol
Answer a. Digoxin
Digoxin has a strong blocking effect on normal AV nodal conduction tissue. This effect
forces conduction down the abnormal pathway. This occurrence is much less common
with beta-blockers. Procainamide is the best

155/1624

therapy for WPW during arrhythmia. In this
case, it was not known that WPW was the
cause of the VT and that is why the standard
of care for VT, which is amiodarone, was
used. In the future, if WPW leads to SVT or
VT, procainamide is the best drug therapy.

Which part of the ECG is most
affected by WPW (Figure 1-10)?

Figure 1-10. The PR interval is shortened (double arrow)
and a delta wave (upsloping initial QRS segment) is seen

156/1624

(arrow, shaded area). (Reproduced with permission from
Knoop KJ, et al. The Atlas of Emergency Medicine, 3rd ed.
New York: McGraw-Hill; 2010.)

a. PR segment depression
b. PR interval <120 msec
c. PR interval >200 msec
d. Wide QRS complex
e. Long QT interval
Answer b. PR interval <120 msec
The accessory bundle of Kent conducts faster
than the normal AV node. This make the PR
interval shorter than the lower limit of normal, which is 120 msec.

The slowest conduction in the normal
heart is the AV node.

157/1624

The patient is admitted to the ICU,
which is appropriate for patients with
WPW presenting with VT. Patients
with asymptomatic WPW or just SVT
can be sent to the regular hospital
ward. Order an echocardiogram if not
already done. Now that the patient is
stable, consult cardiology and electrophysiology. The patient needs evaluation for a permanent repair with radiofrequency catheter ablation.

WPW syndrome is readily cured with
catheter ablation.

HPI: It is 2 o’clock in the morning on
July 2 during your postgraduate year 2
(PGY-2). The intern finished medical
school about an hour ago and is looking
to your expert leadership with a patient
admitted to the hospital a week ago for
an anterior wall myocardial infarction
(AWMI). The patient developed hypotension and lightheadedness a few
hours ago and was moved to the ICU.
He is a 67-year-old man with recurrent
episodes of chest pain during this hospital stay. He was treated with thrombolytics on admission. An echocardiogram on hospital day 3 showed EF at

159/1624

34% and decreased anterior wall
motion.

PE:
Cardiovascular: bilateral JVD, no
murmurs
Chest: clear to auscultation
Extremities: small amount of edema
Skin: diaphoretic

160/1624

What is the mechanism of
response to this hypoperfusion?
a. Increased beta-1-stimulation of peripheral
vessels
b. Increased beta-2-stimulation of peripheral vessels
c. Decreased vagal stimulation of arterioles
d. Increased alpha-1-stimulation of peripheral vessels
e. Central alpha-2-stimulation
Answer d. Increased alpha-1-stimulation of
peripheral vessels
α1-Stimulation is a vasoconstrictor of peripheral vessels. This will shunt blood from
the skin, which is approximately 5% of blood
flow into the central circulation, such as the
heart and brain. Alpha-1-stimulation also
constricts muscle vessels resulting in more
shunting of blood to central organs.

161/1624

Beta-2-stimulation dilates skeletal muscle,
which is undesirable with cardiac pump
dysfunction.
Acetylcholine and parasympathetic stimulation do not touch peripheral vessels.
Alpha-2-stimulation prevents the release of
norepinephrine from nerves. Alpha-2-stimulation will result in vasodilation and will
lower BP.

Acetylcholine neither constricts nor
dilates skin and muscle arterioles.

Norepinephrine is an alpha-1-agonist.

162/1624

After moving the clock forward 10 to
15 minutes, repeat vital signs: R: 28
breaths/minute; BP: 96/58 mm Hg;
P:118 beats/minute.

What is the right step?
a. Bolus dextrose 5% in water (D5W)
b. Bolus half normal saline (NS)
c. Bolus NS
d. NS and dopamine
e. Ringers lactate and levarterenol
Answer c. Bolus NS
It is inappropriate to try to increase BP with
D5W. The best initial fluids to raise BP are
either NS or Ringer lactate (RL). Do not start
pressors such as dopamine or levarterenol
without first trying fluids. This is particularly

Initial Orders:
Bolus NS
ABG
Chest x-ray, portable
CBC
CK-MB

Why does the mechanism of NS
make it the best fluid for
hypotensive patients?
a. Lactate is converted to bicarbonate by the
liver.
b. NS has higher tonicity compared to other
fluids.

164/1624

c. D5W increases free water loss at the
kidneys.
d. NS increases oncotic pressure of the
capillaries.
Answer b. NS has higher tonicity compared
to other fluids.
NS has considerably higher osmotic content
compared with that of D5W or half NS. This
increases its tonicity and is more likely to
keep the fluid in the vascular space. The majority of D5W and half NS will leave the vascular space and enter the interstitial fluid
space. Although this may increase the overall
volume status of the patient, it will not increase the BP as much as either NS or RL.
NS does not contain lactate; RL has the lactate that is converted to bicarbonate by the
liver. Because NS has no protein, it will not
increase the oncotic pressure of the vascular
space.

165/1624

If two to three fluid boluses with NS do
not raise BP >90 mm Hg, then use
levarterenol or pseudoephedrine.

Levarterenol and pseudoephedrine are
pure alpha-1-agonists.

After each fluid bolus, move the clock
forward 5 to 10 minutes, and recheck
BP. This patient’s BP stays at 94/60
mm Hg and his pulse rate remains 120
beats/minute. His neck veins are increasingly distended. His lungs remain clear. ABG results show PO2 68
mm Hg on room air with respiratory
alkalosis. A chest x-ray reveals a

166/1624

cardiac shadow slightly enlarged bilaterally. His CK-MB level is elevated.

Monitoring CK-MB level is better than
monitoring troponin level at detecting
reinfarction.

What can be done first to detect
the etiology?
a. Cardiac catheterization
b. Coronary angiography
c. A >10 mm Hg decrease in BP on
inhalation
d. Transesophageal echocardiogram
e. Holter monitoring

167/1624

Answer c. A >10 mm Hg decrease in BP on
inhalation
Hypotension + JVD + Tachycardia =
Pericardial Tamponade
Pulsus paradoxus is a >10 mm Hg decrease
in BP on inhalation. Pulsus paradoxus can be
checked at the bedside and is a good way to
tell if the heart is being compressed. On inhalation, venous return to the right side of
the heart increases. Normally, the heart expands in external diameter. When compressed by tamponade fluid, the heart cannot enlarge in total size. What happens when
there is right-sided heart enlargement when
the total cardiac size cannot increase? The
RV enlarges from venous return on inhalation and compresses the LV. The right side of
the heart expands in size; the left side of the
heart is “squished” smaller. This decreases
BP.

168/1624

Tamponade seen on ECG has “electrical
alternans,” which is alternating large
and small QRS complexes.

NS is continued and pulsus paradoxus
is found on examination. It is far more
important to perform pericardiocentesis to remove fluid than to wait for
an echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization. Removing as little as 50 mL
of fluid will allow the heart to expand
and increase BP. On CCS, order the
procedure you need. Because you do
not know which procedures will need
a consultation on the computer program, just order the procedure and the
program will tell you when a consultation is needed first.

169/1624

What will be found on
echocardiogram as the first sign
of cardiac tamponade?
a. LV compression in systole
b. LV compression in diastole
c. RV compression in diastole
d. Opening of ventricular septal defect
e. LA dilation
Answer c. RV compression in diastole
The right side of the heart collapses first because the walls are thinner and more easily
compressed (Figure 1-11). All compressions
from pericardial effusion happen in diastole
when the heart is trying to fill (Figure 1-12).

Critical Care, 3rd ed. New York, McGraw-Hill; 2005).

172/1624

Cardiac catheterization shows equalization or pressures in all chambers in
diastole.

With bedside needle pericardiocentesis,
the BP immediately increases after
withdrawing 100 mL of straw-colored,
nonbloody fluid. As you move the clock
forward, the BP drops again the following day. Management of a recurring pericardial effusion is with surgical placement of a “window” or hole
through which the fluid can drain into
the pleural space (Figures 1-13 and
1-14). Once the fluid drains into the
pleural space, it can easily be reabsorbed there. The most likely cause of
pericardial effusion in the patient is the
recent series of myocardial infarctions.

173/1624

Dressler syndrome, or post-MI pericardial inflammation is a rare event because of the routine use of aspirin in all
patients. Despite this, the most likely
explanation is the inflammation created by the multiple MIs.

acute MI. She underwent angioplasty
and was started on aspirin, ticagrelor,
atorvastatin, metoprolol, enalapril, and
nitroglycerin, and placed in the ICU.
You are now called because the nurse
found the patient to be suddenly
confused.

Chest: clear to auscultation

Which is most important?
a. Atropine
b. Transcutaneous pacemaker
c. Transvenous pacemaker
d. Epinephrine
e. Levarterenol
Answer a. Atropine
Bradycardia with symptoms needs atropine
to speed up the heart rate and raise BP. All of

177/1624

the treatments listed will raise BP, but atropine is most appropriate. Atropine works
faster than either form of pacemaker and is
considerably more comfortable than the
transcutaneous pacemaker. Epinephrine will
both speed the heart rate and raise BP, but it
is a disaster to use in acute MI. Epinephrine
will provoke ischemia that can be fatal. It is
wrong to use the alpha-1-agonist levarterenol
without first using atropine, fluids, and a
pacemaker. Alpha-agonists are used to raise
BP when you cannot correct or control the
underlying cause.

Initial Orders:
Atropine IV
NS bolus
ECG
CK-MB, troponin

178/1624

CHEM-7 (electrolytes), calcium,
magnesium
Atropine and NS are given. Remember
that on CCS, treatments are considered “administered” the instant you
confirm them. However, unless you
move the clock forward, you cannot
detect an effect of the treatment. As
you move the clock forward 5 minutes,
recheck the vital signs. If atropine is
going to be effective, it will work instantly, but this cannot be detected on
CCS unless there is a movement forward in time.

In symptomatic bradycardia, atropine is
more important than etiology.

179/1624

Atropine blocks the effect of acetylcholine at the SA and AV nodes.
Acetylcholine slows heart rate.

How does atropine increase heart
rate in bradycardia?
a. Decreases potassium efflux
b. Increases the rate of IF or “Funny” sodium
channels
c. Prolongs phase-2 calcium entry
d. Increases the velocity in Purkinje fibers
e. Increases the conduction speed at the
Bachmann bundle in the atria
Answer b. Increases the rate of IF or
“Funny” sodium channels
Phase 4 in nodal tissue is flattened or slowed
by acetylcholine. Atropine makes it rise

180/1624

faster. Phase 4 is created by “Funny” sodium
channels or IF. Faster IF channels equate to
faster depolarization in nodal tissue.
Atropine speeds the rate at which both the
SA and AV nodes depolarize. This is identical
to the effect norepinephrine has.
On Nodal Tissue:
Atropine = Decreased Acetylcholine = Increased Norepinephrine Effect
Decreased Acetylcholine = Faster Phase 4 =
Faster IF = Faster Heart Rate

Phase 4 depolarization in nodal tissue is
the site of the vagal effect on heart rate.

As you move the clock forward, the
pulse rate increases from 40 to 50

181/1624

beats/minute; BP rises from 70/40 to
84/50 mm Hg. You give an addition
stat dose of atropine and another bolus of NS and move the clock forward 5
minutes. Repeat the vital signs, which
takes 2 minutes of “simulated time” on
CCS. The pulse rate is now 55 beats/
minute and BP is 106/60 mm Hg. If
the BP had not risen to a systolic
above 90 mm Hg, the answer would
have been, “transcutaneous pacemaker.” The stat ECG report returns
10 minutes after ordering it indicating
third-degree (complete) heart block at
a rate of 40 beats/minute.

182/1624

How can the ECG report show the
heart rate at 40 beats/minute,
when the heart rate has increased
at the time of the report?
a. Any test ordered on CCS is done instantly.
It was ordered when the rate was 40
beats/minute.
b. CCS is not based on time.
c. ECG cannot be done stat on CCS.
Answer a. Any test ordered on CCS is done
instantly. It was ordered when the rate was
40 beats/minute.
When writing original orders, the heart rate
was 40 beats/minute. All test are considered
“done” at the instant you confirm the order.
The report comes up later as you pass the
time on the clock with the notice “report
available.” You can cancel any order you do
not want by double clicking on the order

183/1624

before the report comes back. You will always be asked to confirm everything on CCS
two to three times before it is implemented.
It is critical that you understand that tests
are done instantly, otherwise you will give
extra treatment the patient does not need,
thinking “Hey, why is the heart rate still low?
I should give more atropine!” No. The ECG
report is delayed, and the patient has improved since the test was done.

Test reports on CCS always list the exact
time they were ordered.

You ask for an “Interval History” at
the physical examination tab. The patient reports feeling much better and
the confusion has resolved. BP is 106/

184/1624

60 mm Hg. Cannon A waves are still
present. Lungs are clear. You order a
temporary transcutaneous pacemaker
to be placed on the patient’s chest wall.
It will not fire if you set the low limit of
the heart rate to 50 beats/minute and
the patient’s heart rate continues higher than that.

What is the mechanism of the
cannon A wave?
a. Atrial systole against a closed tricuspid
valve
b. Shunt through a patent foramen ovale
c. Ventricular systole
d. Back pressure from the ventricle when the
mitral valve opens

185/1624

Answer a. Atrial systole against a closed tricuspid valve
The A wave is a sign of atrial systole in the
jugular vein. It is normal to have an A wave.
It is abnormally large in complete heart
block because the atrium is often contracting
when the tricuspid valve is closed. Complete
or third-degree heart block means that the
atria and ventricles are contracting with no
relationship to each other (Figure 1-15).
Normally, the tricuspid valve is always open
when the atrium is contracting. Now it will
sometimes be closed, and the blood will rush
backward into the neck veins like a person
bouncing up on a trampoline. “Boing” and
the blood moves backward into the neck
veins.

Bradycardia + Hypotension + Cannon
A Waves = Complete Heart Block

Cannon A waves indicate third-degree
AV block.

When BP normalizes (systolic > 100 mm
Hg) in an ICU patient, you can move the
clock forward at greater intervals such as
2 to 4 hours. On CCS, you can never tell
in advance precisely when the case will
end in “simulated” time. You have 10 to
25 minutes of “real” time, which is your
time for each case. It can be

187/1624

disconcerting when you suddenly see a
screen that says, “This case will end in 5
minutes of real time.” Test takers often
become anxious because there is no objective way to verify whether the case is
ending. It could be because you achieved
the objectives and the test has run its
course, or because you made a mistake.
Make liberal use of the “interval history”
button, which is the only means of obtaining a status report on your patient.
In a patient such as one with complete
heart block, the emphasis will be on initial management.

You move the clock forward 2 hours
and BP remains at 108/70 mm Hg. A
repeat ECG shows persistent complete
heart block. Order a transvenous

188/1624

pacemaker. Make sure you have discontinued the beta-blockers. CCS will
not send you a message saying, “Hey,
you idiot! Stop giving drugs that slow
the heart rate in symptomatic
bradycardia.”

Which wall of the heart is most
likely to have infarcted in this
patient?
a. Anterior
b. Inferior
c. Lateral
d. Posterior
Answer b. Inferior
An inferior wall infarction is most frequently
associated with AV nodal block and

189/1624

bradycardia. When it is accompanied by
nausea and vomiting, it is from direct inflammation of the diaphragm related to the
infarction. When associated with bradycardia, it is from increased vagal tone inhibiting
the SA node. This is sometimes called the
Bezold-Jarisch reflex.

Inferior MI stimulates vagal tone.

What coronary vessel led to AV
block in this patient?
a. Left main
b. Left circumflex
c. Right coronary
d. Left anterior descending
e. Septal perforators

190/1624

Answer c. Right coronary
The right coronary artery is the most frequent source of the blood supply to the AV
node. If there was just a vagal reflex, it would
produce sinus bradycardia. This is why a
permanent pacemaker is so frequently necessary in patients with ischemia-induced
complete heart block. The damage is often
permanent.

Later the same day, a transvenous
pacemaker is placed. An ECG is obtained, showing functioning pacer
spikes and a wide QRS complex. The
heart rate is 70 beats/minute and BP
is 118/70 mm Hg. Mentation is normal, and there is no chest pain.

191/1624

What is the mechanism of wide
QRS complex in this case?
a. Pacer impulses travel slowly from myocyte
to myocyte instead of down the normal
His-Purkinje system.
b. The pacer lead is in the atrium.
c. Smooth muscle junctions are not functioning in paced rhythm.
d. The pacer lead is overly fibrosed, blocking
impulse propagation.
e. Intercalated discs do not function between
myocytes with pacemakers.
Answer a. Pacer impulses travel slowly
from myocyte to myocyte instead of down
the normal His-Purkinje system
All pacemakers placed in ventricles produce
a wide complex. You cannot put the lead in
the atrium because in this case, the AV node

192/1624

is injured, and the impulse would not conduct to the ventricle.

An echocardiogram confirms an inferior wall MI. The pacemaker is functioning normally. Metoprolol and enalapril are restarted. Chemistry is
normal including calcium and magnesium levels. CK-MB level is elevated.
Several hours later, BP suddenly drops
to 80/40 mm Hg. Pulse rate is 70
beats/minute, which is the set rate of
the pacemaker, and pacemaker spikes
are seen. Chest is clear to auscultation.
Neck vein distention is visible.

What is the most likely cause of
the hypotension?
a. Free wall rupture

193/1624

b. Valve rupture
c. Septal rupture
d. Right ventricular infarction
Answer d. Right ventricular infarction
Right ventricular infarction accompanies inferior wall MI in 30% to 40% of patients.
This is because they both have the same arterial supply, which is the right coronary
artery. The test is to flip the ECG leads to the
right side of the chest and get a right
ventricular ECG. There is no specific therapy
except to load fluids.
After a bolus of NS, BP rises and symptoms resolve.

What murmur would you expect
with the history of MR?
a. Pansystolic
b. Crescendo-decrescendo systolic
c. Diastolic decrescendo
d. Midsystolic extra sound with late murmur
e. Continuous “machinery” murmur
Answer a. Pansystolic
MR obscures both S1 and S2 sounds and can
also be described as “holosystolic.” The
crescendo-decrescendo murmur is either
aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy. A diastolic decrescendo
murmur (choice c) is aortic regurgitation.
The midsystolic extra sound with murmur is
mitral valve prolapse. A continuous machinery murmur (choice e) is patent ductus
arteriosus.

Initial Orders:
Echocardiogram
ECG
Chest x-ray
CHEM-7
As an office-based case of someone
who is generally asymptomatic, you
can bring your patient back to the office on CCS in 2 to 4 weeks after the
initial visit. Nonacute chronic cases do
not have precise parameters to guide
the time interval between visits because it is not clear and therefore, you
will not be graded on it.

197/1624

Test Results:
Echocardiogram: moderate MR, EF
62%, LV end-systolic diameter 35
mm
Chemistry: normal
ECG: LV hypertrophy

What is the mechanism of LV
hypertrophy?
a. Increasing wall thickness decreases wall
tension according to the Laplace law.
b. Increasing wall thickness generates
hypertension.
c. Wall thickness has no impact on the Laplace law.
d. Increasing radius will decrease the wall
tension.

198/1624

Answer a. Increasing wall thickness decreases wall tension according to the Laplace
law.
Increasing LV wall thickness decreases wall
tension.
Law of Laplace: Radius × Pressure =
Wall Tension Wall Thickness
This is why decreasing BP will decrease wall
tension as well. This is also why the radius of
the LV chamber increases its rate of dilating
once dilation begins. The bigger or wider the
LV, the faster it will dilate. This is why BP
has to be controlled before LV dilation
occurs.

The wider a chamber is, the faster it
widens.

199/1624

Which is more accurate for
assessing LV hypertrophy?
a. Transthoracic echocardiogram
b. MUGA (nuclear ventriculogram)
c. ECG
d. Catheterization
Answer a. Transthoracic echocardiogram
An echocardiogram is far more accurate than
ECG for LV hypertrophy. The MUGA or nuclear ventriculogram assesses EF and does
nothing to assess LV thickness. A nuclear
ventriculogram is the single most accurate
method of assessing EF. Catheterization
looks at valve function and pressure gradients but does not evaluate LV wall thickness.

Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium uptake
in the distal tubule.

When the patient is lying on a
table and you lift the patient’s legs
in the air, the murmur of MR
increases in intensity. What is the
mechanism?
a. Increasing afterload
b. Increased myocardial oxygen
consumption
c. Decreased atrial filling pressure
d. Pooling blood in abdomen
e. Increased venous return/preload
Answer e. Increased venous return/preload

201/1624

Leg raises and squatting from a standing position will increase venous return to the
heart and increase filling pressure. MR, AR,
MS, and AS will all increase in loudness or
intensity with maneuvers such as these,
which put more blood in the heart.

What is the best medical
management of the MR?
a. No changes are needed; continue
chlorthalidone.
b. Use endocarditis prophylaxis when bloody
dental work is planned.
c. Add a beta-blocker.
d. Switch chlorthalidone to lisinopril.
e. Add spironolactone.
f. Switch chlorthalidone to furosemide.
Answer d.
lisinopril.

Switch

chlorthalidone

to

202/1624

Regurgitant cardiac lesions, such as MR and
AR, are best managed with vasodilators such
as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or nifedipine. We
think there is some benefit in decreasing the
rate of progression of regurgitation.
None of these valvular lesions has sufficient turbulence to need endocarditis
prophylaxis. Beta-blockers and spironolactone would offer no benefit for a person with
a normal EF. There is no fluid overload, so
switching to a loop diuretic offers nothing for
this patient.

You stop chlorthalidone and start
lisinopril. Advance the clock 1 to 2
weeks to check BP and for adverse effects of ACE inhibitors such as cough,
angioedema, and hyperkalemia. On
return 2 weeks later, the patient feels
well and her BP is 118/78 mm Hg. You
schedule an appointment 3 months

203/1624

into the future. BP is again well controlled. After another 3 months, you
repeat the echocardiogram with these
results: EF 55%, left ventricular endsystolic diameter 45 mm.

What is the effect on handgrip as
an ausculatory maneuver on this
patient?
a. It decreases venous return, softening the
murmur.
b. It increases venous return, improving or
softening the murmur.
c. It increases afterload, worsening the
murmur.
d. Handgrip has no effect on regurgitant
lesions.

204/1624

Answer c. It increases afterload, worsening
the murmur.
Handgrip is based on the patient squeezing
the examiner’s hand. This increases afterload
by compressing the arteries of the arm. This
has an effect the opposite of that of an ACE
inhibitor and will, therefore, worsen regurgitant lesions such as AR and MR. The
volume of blood in the arm is too small to
make a meaningful increase in venous
return.
You schedule the patient to return for
repeat echocardiogram in 3 months.
On return, EF decreases from 55% to
50% and LV end-systolic diameter increases from 45 mm to 48 mm. The patient has no symptoms at rest or with
usual exertion. She has been fully adherent to the lisinopril.

205/1624

What is the right action?
a. Institute no change and instruct the patient to return for follow-up in 3 to 6
months.
b. Switch the ACE inhibitor to an ARB.
c. Add an ARB to the ACE inhibitor.
d. Refer the patient for catheter or surgical
valve repair or replacement.
e. Add metoprolol to the patient’s medication regimen.
Answer d. Refer the patient for catheter or
surgical valve repair or replacement.
Surgical repair or replacement of the mitral
or aortic valve must be done for regurgitant
lesions before the patient develops symptoms. Once the ventricle dilates, there is no
way to reverse the dilation and that is why
anatomic correction must be done when the
EF starts to drop. Vasodilators cannot

206/1624

reverse LV dilation, they can only prevent it
from occurring.

Replacement

Which physical finding should
you check for?
a. Enlarged liver
b. Loss of hair and sweat glands in legs
c. Enlarged spleen
d. Ascites and hemorrhoids
Answer b. Loss of hair and sweat glands in
legs
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) predisposes to loss of skin appendages such as hair
follicles and sweat glands. Pulses are lost in
very late disease.

209/1624

S4 is heard with atrial systole into a noncompliant left ventricle.

What is the best initial step?
a. Angiography
b. Ankle-brachial index (ABI)
c. Refer to vascular surgery
d. Doppler ultrasounds of lower extremities
Answer b. Ankle-brachial index (ABI)
ABI is the clear first choice in the evaluation
of PAD. It serves to establish a diagnosis, although it does not determine the precise location of the lesion. An ABI <0.9 indicates
vascular disease.
It is premature to go straight to angiography. Angiography is the most accurate
test, but it is not the one to establish an

210/1624

initial diagnosis of PAD. It can reveal the
anatomic location to determine the site of
repair.
Doppler ultrasounds are not needed if
you can feel a pulse. They are also not as important as determining the difference in BP
between upper and lower extremities. You
should not refer to vascular surgery for a
simple diagnostic procedure such as ABI,
which you can do.

In the upright position, where is
BP the highest?
a. Brain
b. Carotid
c. Brachial
d. Legs
Answer d. Legs

211/1624

BP is greater in the legs than the arms when
standing because of the effect of gravity. The
difference is based on a patient’s height, but
it would be expected to be at least 60 to 80
mm Hg greater in the lower extremities.
When lying flat, BP should be equal in the
arms and legs. If, when lying flat, BP is more
than 10% less in the legs than in the arms
(ABI <0.9), obstruction to flow is present.
Severe PAD is an ABI <0.6.

Which BP medication is best for
PAD?
a. ACE inhibitor
b. Beta-blocker
c. CCB
d. Diuretic

213/1624

e. Alpha-1-antagonist
Answer a. ACE inhibitor
ACE inhibitors have some impact in modifying the progression of disease in PAD. CCBs
are not particularly effective in PAD. The benefit of a CCB, alpha-antagonist, and diuretic
are not more than the benefit of simply controlling BP. There is no disease-modifying effect of the medications listed above on PAD.

CCBs do not benefit the atherosclerotic
plaque in the intimal lining of vessel.

Smooth muscle in arteries is exterior to
the intimal lining; relaxing it does not
open the vessel in PAD.

214/1624

You switch the nifedipine to lisinopril
and add aspirin. You begin the discussion of tobacco cessation by asking if
the patient has a goal to stop smoking
and try to arrange follow-up to set a
quit date. On CCS, remember to always do patient counseling on all lifestyle issues such as weight loss, exercise, diabetic diets, and tobacco cessation. All “population health” issues are
major concerns of the Step 3 examination. This can be very difficult to remember for residents trained to focus
only on current symptoms in a
patient.

Which medication is most
effective in PAD?
a. Ticlopidine

215/1624

b. Cilostazol
c. Pentoxifylline
d. ACE inhibitors
Answer b. Cilostazol
The single most effective medication in PAD
is cilostazol. This is a medication that is used
for only this single indication. It is not used
for coronary, carotid, or cerebrovascular disease. Ticlopidine is a nearly extinct drug to
inhibit platelets. It is a P2Y ADP receptor
antagonist like clopidogrel, but should rarely
be used because of neutropenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
Pentoxifylline is an older medication for PAD
that has been replaced by cilostazol.

Ticlopidine can be offered as a wrong
answer choice on the Step 3

216/1624

examination. Ticlopidine causes neutropenia and TTP.

What is the mechanism of
cilostazol?
a. Thrombin inhibition
b. Decrease cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
c. Increases plasmin activation
d. Phosphodiesterase inhibition
e. Inhibits calcium activation of clotting
cascade
Answer d. Phosphodiesterase inhibition
Cilostazol inhibits phosphodiesterase. This
increases cAMP. There is both inhibition of
platelet activation and some inhibition of
vascular smooth muscle. It both prevents

217/1624

platelet aggregation and has some vasodilatory effect.

Pentoxifylline increases “rheology” or diapedesis of red blood cells—great mechanism, no clinical benefit.

Metformin is fine in PAD. No disease
management (DM) regimen is superior
to another in PAD.

End all ambulatory cases with education, counseling, or advising on lifestyle
issues:
• Obesity: weight loss
• Diabetes: diet and exercise

218/1624

• Hypertension: diet and sodium
restriction
• Hyperlipidemia: weight loss

The results of the repeat LDL test is
142 mg/dL. The patient has started
lisinopril and aspirin and continued
his metformin.

What should be done about his
LDL level?
a. Diet and exercise alone for 3 to 6 months
and repeat
b. Statin
c. Niacin
d. Ezetimibe

219/1624

Answer b. Statin
PAD is equivalent to coronary disease, so it is
important to lower the LDL to <100 mg/dL
in patients with PAD. With an LDL of 142
mg/dL, diet, exercise, and weight loss are insufficient to control the level. Statins are
therapeutically equivalent for use on Step 3.
Niacin is not as effective as a statin. Niacin is
relatively contraindicated in diabetes because it can cause glucose elevation.
Ezetimibe lowers LDL, but has no proven
mortality benefit or proof that it alters the
natural history of any form of vascular
disease.

Get LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dL in
PAD—the same as in coronary disease.

220/1624

Which is most effective to help
stop smoking?
a. Education methods
b. Nicotine gum
c. Nicotine patch
d. Bupropion
Answer d. Bupropion
Nicotine patches and gums are more effective than education alone, but bupropion or
varenicline is more effective than nicotine
replacement.
Advance the clock 2 to 4 weeks. The patient returns using an ACE inhibitor,
cilostazol, metformin, and aspirin. He
wants to try to stop smoking and
agrees to start bupropion and return
for follow-up in 2 weeks. The pain is

221/1624

unchanged. Over the next 6 months, the
patient stops smoking. Repeat LDL is
85 mg/dL and BP 124/78 mm Hg. On
CCS, you never know where the case
will stop. Keep advancing the clock.
Your case may not have the happy ending this one does. If symptoms worsen
in your case despite maximum medical
therapy, do an angiogram in preparation for revascularization angioplasty
or bypass.

BP goal with PAD is <130/80 mm Hg.

222/1624

Which of these is a standard
preventive measure in this
patient?
a. Abdominal aorta ultrasound
b. Chest computed tomography (CT)
c. Exercise tolerance test
d. Renal artery stenosis screening
e. Prostate specific antigen (PSA)
Answer a. Abdominal aorta ultrasound
All men who were ever smokers need an ultrasound to exclude aneurysm. This should
be done once between the ages of 65 and 75
years. This is not true for women or
nonsmokers. PSA is not recommended for
any group. There is no lung cancer screen
with chest CT for smokers that is clearly effective or recommended.
Exercise tolerance testing is not a screen
for asymptomatic patient. Abdominal aortic

223/1624

aneurysm (AAA) screening is standard for
asymptomatic persons.

For statins, liver function tests are
standard, not creatinine kinase (CK)
levels.

CASE 12: Syncope
Setting: ED
CC: “She passed out!”
VS: R: 14 breaths/minute; BP:124/75
mm Hg; P:76 beats/minute; T: 97.5°F
HPI: A 65-year-old woman is brought
to the ED by ambulance after losing
consciousness in church. The patient
was in her usual state of health until she

224/1624

woke up lying on her back in church.
She was transferred to a stretcher and
brought to the ED. The onset of loss of
consciousness (LOC) was sudden. She
cannot recall how long it lasted, but
friends say it was only for a few
minutes. When she awoke, she knew
where she was immediately. Currently,
she feels fine.
PMHX:
Osteoarthritis
Diverticulosis
Medications:
Acetaminophen one to two times a day
PE:
General appearance: older woman sitting up on stretcher looking her stated
age; comfortable; not diaphoretic
Cardiovascular: no murmur

225/1624

Neurological: normal
ROS:
Denies chest pain, dyspnea, headache
Denies bowel or bladder incontinence
She “felt shaky and sweaty” before the
episode. She “felt very hot.”
As you move the clock forward 5 to 10
minutes and take an interval history,
you will find that the vast majority of
cases of syncope do not change. Syncope
is extremely common, and in the majority of patients, the etiology is never
found. The most important part of syncope evaluation is the history.

Why do atrial arrhythmias
generally not lead to syncope?
a. The rate is not fast enough.
b. Atrial systole eventually occurs.

226/1624

c. Stroke volume remains intact.
d. Vasoconstriction compensates.
e. α1-Receptors upregulate.
Answer c. Stroke volume remains intact.
Only 10% to 15% of cardiac output is dependent on the atrial contribution to
ventricular filling. Loss of atrial systole
leaves stroke volume intact in most cases. VT
markedly decreases cardiac output and
ventricular fibrillation eliminates it.
Here are the two key questions and the
examination for syncope:
1. Was the loss of consciousness gradual or sudden?
If gradual (patients are shaky,
sweaty, lowering themselves to the
ground or to a seated position),

227/1624

Hypoglycemia
Hypoxia
Drug toxicity or alcohol
Vasovagal
If sudden (patients feel fine, then
wake up on the floor),
Neurological or seizure
Cardiac: arrhythmia or obstructive
disease
2. Was regaining of consciousness
gradual or sudden?
If gradual,
Seizure: Patients are “post-ictal” in
that they need time to become normal over a few minutes to hours.
If sudden (“like a light switch turned
off and on”),
Cardiac: arrhythmia, ischemia,
structural

228/1624

3. Examination
Arrhythmia rarely reveals an abnormality on cardiac examination.
Murmurs: hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy (HOCM) versus
aortic stenosis versus mitral stenosis
Initial Orders:
ECG
Telemetry monitoring
CK-MB, troponin
Echocardiogram
Head CT
CHEM-7
Urine toxicology screen (some cases)
Patients with syncope do not need to
be placed in the ICU just for syncope.
They only need the ICU if ventricular
arrhythmia is found. Admit the patient
to the regular hospital ward but order

229/1624

telemetry. Ninety percent of mortality
with syncope is from a cardiac problem. You can view your syncope case
as (exclude MI and arrhythmia) for
those patients with no clear etiology at
the beginning. If your case presents a
person who is shaky and sweaty with
a documented low glucose (<60 mg/
dL), then you do not have to place the
person on telemetry or order echocardiography. If your case is clearly hypotensive from pulmonary embolus,
they need TPA and should be admitted
to the ICU.
Syncope can be either considered
one of the most complicated conditions
with a broad differential or one of the
simplest with the same list of tests for
almost everyone.

230/1624

If there is no clear etiology from the patient’s history, order
• ECG and telemetry
• Echocardiogram
• CK-MB, troponin
• Head CT

It is very unlikely to have a significant
obstructive lesion with no murmur on
examination.

As with many patients with syncope, as
you move the clock forward 2 to 4 hours,
there is no change in status, no new
symptoms, and the tests return as
normal.

231/1624

ECG: normal sinus rhythm with no
ST- or T-wave abnormalities
Echocardiogram: mild MR, no wall
motion abnormalities
CK-MB, troponin, head CT: normal
Continue to advance the clock on
CCS until the tests are all normal. Keep
the patient in the hospital for 24 hours of
telemetry monitoring.

Do not order any consultations for syncope patients unless a cardiac abnormality is found.

Regurgitant lesions do not cause
syncope.

232/1624

Do not order carotid Doppler ultrasounds in syncope.

Why does carotid stenosis not
cause syncope?
a. It is too gradual in onset.
b. The posterior circulation supplies the
brainstem.
c. Anterior circulation flows to the reticular
activating system.
d. Vertebrobasilar circulation comes straight
off the carotid.
Answer b. The posterior circulation supplies the brainstem.
The “sleep–wake” center for the brain is in
the brainstem. Anterior or carotid circulation
does not supply the brainstem. A patient can

233/1624

have a 100% occlusion of both carotid arteries and not lose consciousness. The patient
may develop a stroke of the middle and anterior cerebral artery circulation, but will not
lose consciousness.

Only posterior circulation (vertebral and
basilar artery) occlusion causes syncope.

Stenosis lesions rapidly decrease stroke
volume and cardiac output.

235/1624

CHAPTER 2

236/1624

HEMATOLOGY
CASE 1: Iron Deficiency
Anemia
Setting: office
CC: “I feel tired.”
VS: R: 18 breaths/minute; BP: 110/70
mm Hg; P: 87 beats/minute; T: 97.8°F
HPI: A 32-year-old woman with several weeks of increasing tiredness and fatigue visits your office. She says she
feels worse after walking up stairs and
improves with rest. Her menstrual periods last 5 days and are regular.
PE:

237/1624

General appearance: normal
Cardiovascular: normal
Chest: clear to auscultation
Initial Orders:
Complete blood count (CBC)
Thyroid function tests (thyroxine [T4],
thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH])
Oximeter
The patient does not return for her
scheduled office visit the following week.
She comes 2 months later because her
fatigue has worsened and now interferes with functioning. She is now dyspneic with significant exertion, such as
walking two flights of stairs.
Previous Laboratory Test Results:
Thyroid function: normal
Oximeter: 98%
CBC:

238/1624

Hematocrit: 28%
Hemoglobin: 9 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 74
fL
White blood cells (WBCs): 7000/μL
Platelets: 378,000/μL

Which of these does not cause this
patient’s type of anemia?
a. Sideroblastic
b. Folic acid deficiency
c. Iron deficiency
d. Chronic disease
e. Thalassemia
Answer b. Folic acid deficiency
Folic acid deficiency is associated with macrocytosis and large cells. The others all cause

239/1624

microcytic anemia. Expect an MCV >100 fL
in folic acid deficiency.

Orders:
CBC
Iron, total iron-binding capacity
(TIBC), ferritin level
Reticulocyte count
Peripheral smear
Schedule an office visit for the following day (laboratory test results
should be back by then)

The computer-based case simulation
(CCS) always tells you precisely when
the results of the laboratory tests return.
It will say “Report Available” and give a
precise time.

240/1624

Which of these can be associated
with target cells?
a. Autoimmune hemolysis
b. Iron deficiency
c. Folic acid deficiency
d. Vitamin B12 deficiency
Answer b. Iron deficiency
Any of the microcytic anemias can be associated with target cells. The most likely of all
the anemias to cause target cells is
thalassemia. Both alpha- and betathalassemia can cause target cells and
thalassemia can also be caused by
thalassemia trait. Autoimmune hemolysis
causes spherocytes, not target cells.

241/1624

What is the mechanism of target
cell formation?
a. Precipitation of hemoglobin in the red
blood cell (RBC) membrane
b. Excess cell membrane bunching up on the
surface
c. Loss of membrane from protein loss
d. Cellular dehydration
e. Ankyrin and spectrin deficiency
Answer b. Excess cell membrane bunching
up on the surface
Target cells are formed exclusively from excess RBC membrane. The amount of hemoglobin is too small for the size of the covering. The excess membrane “bunches up” on
the cell surface.

242/1624

The patient returns the following day.
You never have to be uncertain about
the time to have the patient come back
on CCS, because when you order the
tests, it will tell you when the report
will be back.
CBC:
Hematocrit: 23%
Hemoglobin: 7 g/dL
MCV: 70 fL
WBCs: 7,400/μL
Platelets: 578,000/μL
Iron: low
TIBC: elevated
Ferritin level: low
Reticulocyte count: 1%
Peripheral smear: microcytic, hypochromic cells; no target cells; no
schistocytes or fragmented cells

243/1624

Red blood cell distribution width
(RDW): elevated

What is the mechanism of
elevated TIBC?
a. Decreased saturation of the transferrin
transport protein
b. Decreased saturation of transferring in
storage in marrow
c. Increased hepcidin
d. Iron is locked in macrophages
Answer a. Decreased saturation of the
transferrin transport protein
Transferrin transport two iron atoms on
each molecule. This is the fast transporter in
plasma of iron to be incorporated into hemoglobin and into cells. A high capacity on a

244/1624

protein such as transferrin means that it is
empty or unoccupied. Iron locked in macrophages is the mechanism of the anemia of
chronic disease.

Ferritin is a hollow ball of proteins that
stores iron in tissue. Free iron is toxic.

What is the significance of the
high platelet count?
a. None, it is an expected part of iron deficiency anemia.
b. It is a marker of additional disease and
needs investigation.
c. Essential thrombocytosis will develop.
Order a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation
test.

245/1624

Answer a. None, it is an expected part of
iron deficiency anemia.
Platelet elevation is an expected feature of
iron deficiency anemia. The etiology may be
that erythropoietin has some stimulatory effect on megakaryocytes. No further evaluation is needed.

Thrombocytosis in iron deficiency needs
no further investigation.

RDW is found to be elevated.
What is the mechanism?
a. In iron deficiency, new cells are larger.
b. In iron deficiency, new cells are smaller.
c. Microcytosis becomes stable.

246/1624

Answer b. In iron deficiency, new cells are
smaller.
As you run out of iron, the cells become
smaller. The RBC is a “bad of hemoglobin.”
If there is no iron to make hemoglobin from,
then the cells become smaller. It is like making smaller sandwiches when you run low on
food.

The patient returns feeling tired. Her
stool is heme negative. The presumed
mechanism of her iron deficiency anemia is menstruation in a woman. Her
menstrual periods do tend to be somewhat heavy. Oral ferrous sulfate is
started, and you ask her to return in 2
weeks.

247/1624

What will change first in response
to iron replacement?
a. MCV
b. Reticulocyte count
c. Hemoglobin level
d. RDW
Answer b. Reticulocyte count
Reticulocytes are the measure of new cell
formation. Reticulocyte concentration has to
increase first for any of the other features of
a CBC to change.

Reticulocytes: Methylene blue stains ribosomal RNA from residual endoplasmic reticulum.

248/1624

The patient returns in 2 weeks. The repeat hematocrit test shows that the
level rose from 23% to 25%. The reticulocyte count rises only from 1% to
2.5%.

Which of the following
over-the-counter substances may
be impeding the absorption of
iron?
a. Cimetidine
b. Vitamin C
c. Vitamin D
d. Carbonated beverages
Answer a. Cimetidine
Anything that raises the gastric pH will inhibit iron absorption. H2-blockers, proton

249/1624

pump inhibitors, and liquid antacids can all
impair iron absorption. Carbonated beverages and vitamin C can increase iron absorption because they acidify the stomach.

High pH (basic) inhibits iron absorption. Acid, like vitamin C, increases iron
absorption.

The patient admits to taking both liquid antacids and H2-blockers. She did
not think to tell you because she did
not consider them important, saying,
“Well, I don’t need a prescription for
them, so I didn’t think of them as a
medication.” You ask her to stop taking them and start taking vitamin C.
She continues the oral ferrous sulfate.

250/1624

Move the clock forward another 2
weeks. She returns feeling better except that her stool, she says, is black
and she is constipated.

Oral ferrous sulfate causes constipation
and black stool.

Everyone on iron should be given a stool
softener, such as docusate.

How can you differentiate the
effect of oral ferrous sulfate from
gastrointestinal bleeding?
a. Iron is stool-guaiac negative.

251/1624

b. Iron is stool-guaiac positive.
c. Upper endoscopy is needed to be sure.
d. Colonoscopy is needed to be sure.
Answer a. Iron is stool-guaiac negative.
Oral ferrous sulfate, or elemental iron,
causes constipation because only 1% to 2% of
it is absorbed. The remaining iron in the
bowel lumen causes constipation. It is also
guaiac or heme negative. Colonoscopy would
not be useful even if there was upper
gastrointestinal (GI) tract bleeding.

FerroUS iron is normal in the U.S.

What is the normal function of
hepcidin?
a. Stores iron in the liver

252/1624

b. Stores iron in the marrow
c. Master regulator of the rate of iron absorption in the bowel
d. Liver regulator of excretion bilirubin
e. Transports iron from destroyed RBCs to
the liver for recycling
Answer c. Master regulator of the rate of
iron absorption in the bowel
Hepcidin is made by the liver to stop excess
iron absorption in the bowel. Hepcidin prevents hemochromatosis by blocking iron
transport from enterocytes in the bowel wall
into the portal system. Hepcidin keeps iron
in the bowel.

Iron is absorbed in the duodenum.

253/1624

Eight weeks after the starting iron and
stopping antacids, the patient returns.
Her symptoms are resolved and her
hematocrit is 36%.

CASE 2: Thalassemia
Setting: office
CC: “I didn’t know my blood count was
low.”
VS: normal
HPI: A 28-year-old woman comes for
preemployment screening tests prior to
her first job as a fellow in orthopedic
surgery. She has never had a CBC before and did not know her hematocrit
was low.

254/1624

Hematocrit: 28%
Hemoglobin: 10 g/dL
MCV: 65 fL
Smear: target cells

Which is most likely to be found
in this patient?
a. Her RBC count is elevated.
b. Her platelet count is elevated.
c. Her TIBC is elevated.
d. Her iron level is elevated.
Answer a. Her RBC count is elevated.
Thalassemia is associated with an increase in
the RBC count. This patient most likely has
thalassemia because it is a microcytic anemia
with a very low MCV and no symptoms. This
is because the RBC count goes up, which
maintains the hematocrit. Also, target cells

255/1624

are most likely in a person with thalassemia.
Platelet count elevation (choice b) is found in
iron deficiency anemia.

Iron studies are ordered and the
patient returns in 2 days to
discuss the results. Which of the
following is most likely to be
found?

Answer b. Normal (iron, TIBC, ferritin)

256/1624

Iron studies are normal in thalassemia. High
circulating iron (choice a) level indicates
sideroblastic anemia. The most accurate test
for sideroblastic anemia is a Prussian blue
stain. Low iron level with a low iron-binding
capacity is the anemia of chronic disease.
Choice d is iron deficiency anemia. Up to
one-third of those with iron deficiency anemia can have a normal ferritin level. This is
because ferritin is an acute phase reactant
and its level increases with infection, cancer,
and stress in the same way a white count or
sedimentation rate would.

Prussian blue is an iron stain. Sideroblastic anemia has iron built up in RBC
mitochondria.

257/1624

Target Cells = Low Hemoglobin (Hb) in
the Large RBC Membrane

The patient comes back to discuss her
CBC and iron study results. She does
not understand how her RBC count
can be up, and her hematocrit level
can be down.

What else besides thalassemia can
do this?
a. Hypoxia and polycythemia vera
b. Leukemia and essential thrombocytosis
c. Hereditary spherocytosis
d. Autoimmune hemolysis
Answer a. Hypoxia and polycythemia vera

258/1624

Besides thalassemia, hypoxia causes an increased RBC count. These patients and those
with polycythemia vera will have an excessively
high
hematocrit
concentration.
Thalassemia is a cause of anemia. It is easy
to confuse hypoxia with polycythemia vera
because both have supranormal high hematocrit levels.

The repeat CBC and iron studies are
normal. You inform the patient that
she likely has thalassemia trait. You
do not offer an electrophoresis because
it will not change your management of
this patient’s medical care. She is requesting the electrophoresis because
she “just wants to know.”

259/1624

What do you tell her?
a. You refuse because you do not want to be
manipulated by another doctor.
b. You refuse, because it will not change her
treatment.
c. You agree because you should do any test
that is not harmful or expensive.
d. You agree because she has a right to know
what type of thalassemia she has.
Answer d. You agree because she has a
right to know what type of thalassemia she
has.
The patient does not know if she has alphathalassemia or beta-thalassemia and she
wants to know. Patients do not have a right
to “any test they want.” This is true even if
they are paying cash and the test is uncomplicated. For example, I do not have a right
to demand an abdominal computed tomography (CT) “just because I want to know.”

260/1624

The physician is not obligated to perform
tests unless they have direct medical benefit.

You perform the hemoglobin electrophoresis and reschedule the patient in
a week to discuss results.

Which electrophoresis result is
most likely in this patient?

Answer a. Normal
This person has thalassemia trait. Alphathalassemia trait will give a normal electrophoresis. This is very hard for most people to
understand. The electrophoresis does not tell

261/1624

the total amount of hemoglobin. It tells the
relative percentages of each subtype. In
alpha-thalassemia trait, all the types of
hemoglobin are decreased, but they are decreased in normal proportions.
Choice b is more severe alphathalassemia. This would present with a lower
hematocrit level and symptoms. Choice c is
beta-thalassemia
major,
not
betathalassemia trait.

HbH = Tetrads of Four Beta-chains

Four genes are needed to fully produce
alpha-chains.

262/1624

How many genes are deleted in
this patient?
a. 1
b. 2
c. 3
d. 4
Answer b. 2
Alpha-thalassemia trait is defined at the deletion of two of the normal four genes responsible for alpha-chain production. One
gene deletion is clinically normal. One gene
deletion is a “silent carrier” in which the CBC
is normal. Four gene deletions is not compatible with life. The fetus would die in utero
of heart failure. You cannot survive without
any alpha-chains.

263/1624

• Hemoglobin Bart’s (HbBart) = Four
Genes Deleted
• HbH = Three Genes Deleted
• Silent Carrier = One Gene Deleted

The patient is informed that she has
alpha-thalassemia trait with two genes
deleted. She is always asymptomatic.
There is no treatment for her to correct
the disorder.

What benefit is there in knowing
she has alpha-thalassemia trait?
a. There is no benefit except for her own
knowledge.
b. The trait progresses to thalassemia major
in some cases.

264/1624

c. The patient can have genetic counseling
for reproductive purposes.
Answer c. The patient can have genetic
counseling for reproductive purposes.
For a person considering reproduction,
thalassemia trait has enormous significance.
A person may choose not to reproduce with a
person who also has a thalassemia trait to
avoid a risk of thalassemia major. The couple
may choose to have amniocentesis or other
testing done during pregnancy to assess a
baby that has been conceived.

What is the most precise method
of determining this patient’s type
of thalassemia?
a. Genetic testing
b. Bone marrow
c. Electrophoresis—as precise as it gets

265/1624

Answer a. Genetic testing
The only way to be certain of the number of
genes deleted is by genetic testing. Bone
marrow shows nothing specific.

Which form of thalassemia has
high reticulocytes?
a. Alpha-thalassemia trait
b. Three-gene-deleted alpha-thalassemia
c. Beta-thalassemia trait
d. Beta-thalassemia major
Answer b.
thalassemia

Three-gene-deleted

alpha-

The deletion of three genes results in a much
lower hematocrit that needs periodic transfusion. The RBCs are made in increased
number, but they have a very short survival.

266/1624

CASE 3: Vitamin B12 Deficiency (Alcoholism, Peripheral
Neuropathy)
Setting: office
CC: “I have numbness and tingling in
my feet.”
HPI: A 78-year-old man comes to your
office with several weeks of progressive
weakness and fatigue. He easily tires
when exerting himself. Over the last 1 to
2 weeks, he has developed a “tingling” in
his feet that he describes as a “pins and
needles” sensation.
PMHX:
Alcoholism
Hypertension
Diabetes

267/1624

Medications:
Enalapril
Metformin
PE:
General: tired older man
Cardiovascular: 2/6 murmur at apex
radiating to axilla
Chest: clear
Neurological: decreased sensation
symmetrically over the lower extremities bilaterally; normal position
and vibratory sensation

How can you tell the difference
between peripheral neuropathy
from alcohol, diabetes, or vitamin
B12 deficiency by symptoms
alone?
a. Duration

268/1624

b. Intensity
c. Location
d. Impossible to tell
Answer d. Impossible to tell
Peripheral neuropathy is indistinguishable
based on the etiology. All etiologies cause bilateral symptoms, which are more noticed in
the feet, slowly progressive, and defined as
“pins and needles” sensations. The precise
mechanism of the damage to myelin in vitamin B12 deficiency is not precise. Diabetes
and alcohol can also cause deficits of position and vibratory sense.

All peripheral neuropathy is from damaged myelin.

269/1624

Discuss the patient’s alcohol use with
him. Use the CAGE questions:
Are you trying to Cut down the
amount of alcohol you use?
Does it make you Annoyed when

opener in the morning?
Initial Orders:
CBC
Basic metabolic panel (CHEM-7)
Calcium and magnesium levels
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
Vitamin B12 and folate levels
Although the most accurate test of
peripheral neuropathy is the electrodiagnostic test (i.e., nerve conduction
studies), this test should not be done

270/1624

routinely for either diabetes or vitamin B12 deficiency. It should be a clinical
diagnosis.

The precise mechanism of myelin damage in vitamin B12 deficiency is not clear.

You advance the clock 1 week.
CBC Results:
Hematocrit: 28%
MCV: 118 fL
WBCs: 2800/μL
Platelets: 120,000/μL
Vitamin B12 level: borderline low
Folate: normal

271/1624

Calcium, magnesium: normal
Glucose: 185 mg/dL
HbA1c: 8.5%

Vitamin B12 is essential for methyl transfer in DNA production (Figure 2-1).

272/1624

Figure 2-1. Role of cobalamin (vitamin B12) and folic acid
in nucleic acid and myelin metabolism. Lack of either cobalamin or folic acid retards DNA synthesis (A) and lack of cobalamin leads to loss of folic acid, which cannot be held intracellularly unless polyglutamated. Lack of cobalamin also
leads to abnormal myelin synthesis, probably via a deficiency in methionine production (B). CH3, methylium
cation; CoA, coenzyme A; ?, possible. (Reproduced with permission from Chandrasoma P, Taylor CR. Concise Pathology, 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 1998.)

Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause
pancytopenia or anemia alone.

What is the goal of glucose in a
diabetic?
a. It depends on whether it is type 1 or 2
diabetes.
b. The goal is between 80 and 110 mg/dL.
c. The goal is HbA1c <6.5%.

273/1624

d. The goal is HbA1c <7%.
e. The goal is HbA1c <10%.
Answer d. The goal is HbA1c <7%.
You should add medications until the HbA1c
is <7%. The initial diagnosis of diabetes is a
HbA1c >6.5%.

With a HbA1c >7%, you should add a
second oral hypoglycemic. Which
second agent to add is not clear. Metformin is first. As a second, you can
add a sulfonylurea, rosiglitazone,
nateglinide (or repaglinide), or a
dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin,
or linagliptin.

274/1624

What test should be done to
confirm the presence of vitamin
B12 deficiency?
a. Methylmalonic acid level
b. Anti-intrinsic factor/antiparietal cell
antibodies
c. Schilling test
d. Homocysteine level
Answer a. Methylmalonic acid level
Methylmalonic acid levels build up in vitamin B12 deficiency. Homocysteine level increases in both vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can have a low
normal level in 10% to 20% of patients
routinely. Anti-intrinsic factor, antiparietal
cell antibodies, and the Schilling test are not
used to discover whether there is a vitamin
B12 deficiency. They are used to identify the
etiology of the deficiency.

275/1624

Orders:
Second oral hypoglycemic agent
Methylmalonic acid level
Dilated eye examination
Advance the clock to get the results of
the methylmalonic acid (MMA) level,
which turns out to be elevated. The
point of doing the anti-intrinsic factor
and antiparietal cell antibody tests is
to determine the etiology of the vitamin B12 deficiency, which is particularly
important in this case.
Both antibodies are negative.

What is the most likely cause of
the vitamin B12 deficiency?
a. Blind loop syndrome
b. Pernicious anemia

276/1624

c. Metformin use
d. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use
e. Dietary deficiency
Answer c. Metformin use
Metformin decreases intestinal absorption of
vitamin B12 in 10% to 30% of patients.

Metformin causes decreased ileal absorption of vitamin B12. Calcium supplementation corrects it.

What is the difference between
megaloblastic and macrocytic
anemia?
a. MCV

277/1624

b. Vitamin B12 etiology
c. Folate deficiency etiology
d. Hypersegmented neutrophils
Answer d. Hypersegmented neutrophils
Macrocytic just means an MCV >100 fL. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency both cause
macrocytosis and megaloblastosis. They are
indistinguishable based on hematologic findings (Figure 2-2).

Figure 2-2. Peripheral blood smear from a patient with
vitamin B12 deficiency showing oval macrocytes (A) and hypersegmented neutrophil (B). (Reproduced with permission
from Lichtman MA, et al. Lichtman’s Atlas of Hematology.
2007, www.accessmedicine.com.)

278/1624

Folate is not needed for myelin
formation.

Vitamin B12 is given orally. Two weeks
later, laboratory test results show an
elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
and indirect bilirubin. The smear still
shows hypersegmented neutrophils.

Why did the hematologic picture
not improve?
a. Vitamin B12 is malabsorbed and needs to
be given by injection.
b. It needs more time to recover.
c. Diabetes prevents cell formation until it is
corrected.

279/1624

Answer a. Vitamin B12 is malabsorbed and
needs to be given by injection.
Whether the malabsorption is caused by
calcium-dependent ileal malabsorption or
pernicious anemia, you need to give vitamin
B12 by intramuscular injection. Step 3 does
not test dosing, but does test route of administration. The LDH and indirect bilirubin are
elevated because there is an “ineffective
erythropoiesis.” Cells are made in the marrow, but destroyed just after production.

Reticulocyte count is low in vitamin B12
deficiency from early cell destruction.

Expect a hypercellular bone marrow in
vitamin B12 deficiency.

280/1624

Intramuscular vitamin B12 is given.
Reticulocytes are expected to be produced in 2 to 3 days.

What should you test for
immediately after replacement?
a. Potassium level
b. Calcium level
c. LDH and bilirubin
d. Hematocrit
Answer a. Potassium level
The potassium level can suddenly drop after
giving vitamin B12. Changes in LDH and bilirubin are of no clinical significance. You
have to wait 1 to 2 weeks to see a meaningful
change in hematocrit. Potassium is “packaged up” into an enormous number of new

281/1624

cells. If rapid cell breakdown causes hyperkalemia, then vitamin B12 replacement is one
of the only things in which rapid cell formation can cause low potassium.

Potassium is 95% intracellular.

Neuropathy can improve if it is minor
and of short duration.

CASE 4: Sickle Cell
Setting: emergency department (ED)
CC: “I have really bad pain in my legs,
back, and chest.”

282/1624

VS: R: 28 breaths/minute; BP: 152/88
mm Hg; P: 110 beats/minute; T:
101.8°F
HPI: A 28-year-old man with a history
of sickle cell (SS) disease arrives at the
ED with recurrence of a pain crisis. This
is the same as his usual crisis. He has
been noncompliant with hydroxyurea.
Besides pain, he has had fever. At home,
it was 102°F.
PMHX:
Gallstones
Osteomyelitis
Skin ulcers
Pneumonia
Priapism episode in past

283/1624

Gallstones in SS disease are from an aggregation of chronically high indirect bilirubin levels.

The mechanism of skin ulcers is not
clear, but poor flow is likely.

Medications:
Folic acid
Hydroxyurea (not taking)
Oxycodone

What is the most important step
at this time?
a. Perform physical examination.

284/1624

b. Draw blood cultures and start antibiotics.
c. Begin intravenous (IV) fluids.
d. Restart hydroxyurea
e. Obtain old records to confirm SS in this
patient.
Answer b. Draw blood cultures and start
antibiotics.
Because doing the physical examination advances the clock and moves “Simulated
Time,” this is a “Save-a-Life Point.” Infection
in SS is easily fatal unless rapidly treated.
Start antibiotics immediately. Pneumococcus, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, and Salmonella can all be growing in the blood at the
time of the first temperature elevation.
Sickle Cell + Fever = Blood Cultures +
Ceftriaxone NOW!

285/1624

Sickle cell anemia eliminates the spleen
through the process of autoinfarction.

No Spleen = Encapsulated Organisms
Kill the Patient

PE:
Chest: some rales at left base; decreased excursion from splinting
Extremities: ulcer with superficial
purulent material over anterior
shin; scarring from old ulcers
scattered on legs
Heart: 1/6 systolic murmur
Neurological: nonfocal
Genitals: normal

286/1624

What causes priapism in SS
disease?
a. Stasis in penis
b. Arterial insufficiency
c. Stasis and infarction of prostatic plexus of
veins
d. Decreased hemoglobin concentration
Answer c. Stasis and infarction of prostatic
plexus of veins
The same stasis and infarction of flow that
cause chest syndrome, retinal lesions, skin
lesions, and stroke, also diminishes flow out
of the penis as veins pass through the
prostate.

SS disease is associated with decreased
nitric oxide, causing priapism, which is

287/1624

similar to how pulmonary hypertension
develops.

The patient is very uncomfortable. Because you will be treating patients unfamiliar to you in an ED setting, you
will be confronted with people you are
not sure have SS crisis. Ethically, it is
better to treat everyone as having a
genuine event and give pain medications. The most important part of this
case is to give oxygen, fluids, and antibiotics before all other considerations.
Stopping the crisis and preventing
septic death from an autosplenectomized adult with SS disease is the most
important task.
Initial Orders:

288/1624

Oxygen
Normal saline (NS) continuously
Ceftriaxone (if febrile)
Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) IV
CBC and peripheral smear
Liver function tests (LFTs)
Reticulocyte count
Chest x-ray
Electrophoresis (if patient is unknown to you)
Urinalysis (UA) and blood cultures (if
not done)
Folic acid

Any patient in pain can have hypertension and tachycardia. Treat the pain first
and recheck blood pressure and heart
rate.

289/1624

SS disease originates from a single
amino acid substitution. Valine replaces
glutamic acid at position 6

You move the clock forward 1 hour
and check to see that the pain has improved with “Interval History.”
Rechecking oxygen saturation is always a good idea because the root
cause of SS crisis is an abnormal crystallization of sickle hemoglobin at low
oxygen states.
Test Results:
CBC and peripheral smear: hematocrit 28%; smear: sickled cells, WBCs
18,000/μL (Figure 2-3)
LFTs: indirect bilirubin elevated 2.5
mg/dL

290/1624

Reticulocyte count: 15%
Chest x-ray: left lower lobe infiltrate
UA: no WBCs

Figure 2-3. Sickle cells. Homozygous sickle cell disease. A
nucleated red blood cell and neutrophil are also in the field.

291/1624

Why are there high levels of bilirubin
and bilirubin stones in SS disease?
• Normal RBCs live 90 to 120 days.
• Sickle RBCs live only 10 to 20 days.

Everyone with SS disease has a reticulocyte count 5 to 10 times higher than normal because cells are rapidly destroyed.

SS disease is a chronic, partially compensated hemolytic anemia.

Although the chest x-ray shows an infiltrate, the patient is already on

292/1624

antibiotics for fever. Other antibiotic
choices are levofloxacin, moxifloxacin,
or adding vancomycin to the ceftriaxone. This is all to cover pneumococcus.
WBC counts are routinely elevated in
SS disease. This is an expected finding
and is part of the chronic hyperactivity of the marrow.

Expected Abnormalities in Sickle Cell
Disease
• Reticulocyte count 5% to 25%
• High indirect bilirubin level
• Elevated WBC count

293/1624

Salmonella is the most common documented cause of osteomyelitis in SS
disease.

Pulmonary hypertension is common in
SS disease from deficient nitric oxide
(NO).

You move the clock forward 1 day
after the initial laboratory test results
are checked and oxygen, fluids, pain
medications, and antibiotics are
ordered. On hospital days 2 and 3, the
hematocrit levels drop from 28% to
25% to 20%.

294/1624

What is the most likely cause?
a. Folic acid insufficiency
b. Parvovirus
c. Sepsis
d. Sickle cell crisis itself
Answer b. Parvovirus
Parvovirus can “freeze” the marrow in SS
disease. It has a predilection for infecting
those with hemoglobinopathy. Folic acid deficiency can definitely lead to a sudden stop
in RBC production, so you should check to
see if you remembered to order a folic acid
test. Sepsis can stop marrow production but
should not work this fast. You should not
ascribe sudden drops in hematocrit levels to
the SS crisis alone. Pain crises are not the
same as hemolytic events. The etiology of
pain in SS crisis is not precisely clear, but it
is definitely not the same as seeing a drop in
hematocrit.

295/1624

Orders:
Reticulocyte count
Repeat CBC
Folic acid if not ordered
The reticulocyte count comes back as
2%. This is far too low for SS disease
especially in a person on folic acid.
Orders:
Parvovirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for DNA
IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) if the
hematocrit level continues to drop
Transfusion

The most accurate test for SS disease is
hemoglobin electrophoresis.

296/1624

Sickle cell trait is increased in certain
countries because it stops the spread of
malaria by destroying the first infected
cells.

Despite giving oxygen and adding
vancomycin to ceftriaxone and
hydration, the patient’s chest pain
and hypoxia worsen. What is the
next step?
a. Change antibiotics.
b. Provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
c. Perform exchange transfusion.
Answer c. Perform exchange transfusion.
Exchange transfusion is the fastest way to
terminate a pain crisis. It involves replacing

297/1624

the majority or the patient’s blood. This effectively eliminates the sickling. Indications
for exchange transfusion are:
• Acute chest syndrome not responding (hypoxia worsens)
• Central nervous system (CNS) events or
stroke
• Priapism
• Retinal infarction

Order a hematology consultation for a
patient with severe sickle crisis, especially for one needing an exchange
transfusion. Move the clock forward a
few hours. After the transfusion, the
patient’s symptoms resolve. Cultures
do not grow an organism. Move the
clock forward 6 to 12 hours at a time.
On hospital day 7, the patient is
ready to leave. You get the message

298/1624

“This case will end in 5 minutes of real
time.”
What are your final orders?
Folic acid test
Pneumococcal vaccine (if not previously given in last 5 years)
Hydroxyurea
Follow-up office visit in 1 week

Hydroxyurea increases levels of fetal
hemoglobin.

Sickle cell disease predisposes to dehydration by impairing renal tubular concentrating ability.

299/1624

CASE 5: Autoimmune
Hemolysis
Setting: ED
CC: “I feel very weak and my skin has
turned yellow.”
VS: R: 26 breaths/minute; BP: 102/64
mm Hg; P: 118 beats/minute; T: 99.8°F
HPI: A 43-year-old woman recently
treated for a dental abscess with amoxicillin presents to the ED with 2 days of
progressively worsening weakness, fatigue, and yellow skin. She says that her
friends told her that her eyes have
turned yellow.
PMHX:
Dental abscess
Root canal performed 4 days ago

300/1624

Medications:
Amoxicillin for last 4 days
PE:
Skin: jaundiced
Head, ears, eyes, nose, throat
(HEENT): scleral icterus
Abdomen: soft, nontender, no spleen
felt
Initial Orders:
LFTs
CBC
UA
LDH
Move the clock forward only enough
time to obtain test results. There is no
way to tell from the jaundice and icterus
whether this is from a biliary source or
is hepatic or hemolytic in nature. You

301/1624

can only tell once you know whether it is
direct bilirubin or indirect bilirubin.

Which form of hemolysis
produces bilirubin in the urine?
a. None
b. Spherocytosis
c. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
d. Autoimmune
e. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
(PNH)
Answer a. None
Only direct bilirubin goes into the urine. Indirect bilirubin does not go into urine. Hemolysis produces indirect bilirubin, which is
not water soluble. There are two ways to get
tests. One is: “Hey, I will order a bunch of
tests because I do not know what is there!”

302/1624

The other is: “Direct bilirubin from hepatitis
or obstructive jaundice goes into the urine.
Indirect bilirubin from hemolysis does not
go into the urine. I am getting the UA to
prove or disprove, whether there is bilirubin
in the urine, so I can establish a diagnosis.”

Move the clock forward 30 to 50
minutes.
Laboratory Test Results:
LFTs: normal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT); total bilirubin 8
mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.8 μmol/L
CBC: hematocrit 26%; MCV 105 fL;
platelets normal; WBCs 7400/μL
UA: no urobilinogen; no RBCs
LDH: elevated

303/1624

These results exclude a liver source of
jaundice. Drug-induced hepatitis elevates AST, and viral hepatitis elevates
ALT.

Why is MCV elevated?
a. Reticulocytes are larger than mature cells.
b. Lipids stick to RBCs making them look
larger.
c. Myelodysplasia has developed.
d. Folic acid deficiency developed.
Answer a. Reticulocytes are larger than
mature cells.
New cells or reticulocytes are slightly larger
than mature RBCs. You should expect a
slightly elevated MCV with hemolysis. Although lipids do sometimes stick to cells
making them larger, this has nothing to do

304/1624

with this case. It is unlikely folic acid deficiency can develop in 1 to 2 days and change
MCV like this.

LDH level increases with any form of
cell destruction.

Orders:
Repeat CBC
Haptoglobin
Reticulocyte count
Coombs test
Peripheral smear

305/1624

Which of the following is most
likely to give spherocytes on
smear?
a. Autoimmune hemolysis
b. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency
c. PNH
d. Cold agglutinin disease
Answer a. Autoimmune hemolysis
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies grab
onto a piece of the RBC membrane. Macrophages and the spleen remove pieces of the
membrane. This produces a tighter, smaller
cell with less membrane but the same
amount of hemoglobin. This produces a cell
that is small and round—a spherocyte.

306/1624

Move the clock forward 1 hour.
CBC: hematocrit 24%
Haptoglobin: decreased
Reticulocyte count: 8%
Coombs test: positive IgG warm
antibody
Smear: no schistocytes; no fragmented cells; spherocytes are seen

Hereditary spherocytosis is most likely
to enlarge the spleen.

What is the difference between a
direct and indirect Coombs test?
a. There is no difference in vitro.

307/1624

b. A direct Coombs test detects IgG attached
to RBCs; an indirect Coombs test detects
antibodies in circulation.
c. A direct Coombs test leads to cell destruction; an indirect Coombs test does not.
Answer b. A direct Coombs test detects IgG
attached to RBCs; an indirect Coombs test
detects antibodies in circulation.
In a direct Coombs test, antibodies attach to
RBCs. The antibodies are used against Fc receptors to detect clumping. In an indirect
Coombs test, neutral sheep RBCs are introduced into patient serum. Antibodies then
attach to the RBCs. Although an indirect
Coombs test implies a higher level of antibody than a direct Coombs test, the clinical
implications are negligible.

308/1624

Splenic enlargement needs time.
Autoimmune hemolysis is too acute to
enlarge the spleen.

When the Coombs test result is positive
and you see a clear decrease in haptoglobin and elevation in reticulocyte
count and jaundice, you know this is
autoimmune hemolysis. You should
add glucocorticoids, such as prednisone or methylprednisolone, and repeat the CBC in 4 to 6 hours.

Penicillins destroy RBCs with a hapten
mechanism. Antibodies are made to
both the RBC membrane and penicillin.

309/1624

Where are the RBCs being
destroyed?
a. Spleen
b. Liver
c. Intravascular
Answer a. Spleen
Warm IgG antibodies lead to destruction of
RBCs in the spleen. Cold immunoglobulin M
(IgM) antibodies destroy RBCs in the liver.
IgG antibodies can be treated with steroids.
IgM antibodies do not respond to steroids.

IgM cold agglutinins originate from mycoplasma and Epstein-Barr virus.

310/1624

IgM-induced hemolysis does not respond to steroids or splenectomy.

Methylprednisolone and folic acid are
started. You move the clock forward 8
hours and then 24 hours. The repeat
CBC shows a dropping hematocrit
from 24% to 22% to 20%, and a transfusion of two units of packed RBCs is
given. The hematocrit stays at 20%.
Two more units raise the hematocrit
concentration from 20% to 21%.

Each unit of packed red blood cells
should increase the hematocrit concentration by 3 points.

311/1624

What should you do to increase
the hematocrit concentration?
a. Remove the spleen today.
b. Start IVIG.
c. Add dexamethasone to
methylprednisolone.
d. Perform plasmapheresis.
Answer b. Start IVIG.
IVIG can help rapidly interrupt immune-mediated hemolysis if it is from a drug such as
penicillin or on an autoimmune basis. There
is no benefit to using multiple glucocorticoids. Plasmapheresis only removes circulating antibodies and does not work in hemolysis from a hapten mechanism. It will work
with HUS or thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP).
Removing the spleen is effective in preventing recurrences of immune-mediated
cell destruction, but should not be done first.

312/1624

IVIG saturates Fc receptors on
macrophages.

IVIG prevents the macrophage from
“grabbing” the IgG on the RBC and
dragging it off to be destroyed in the
spleen.

Azathioprine and cyclophosphamide are
effective, but take a month to work.

Rituximab works for both cold agglutinins (IgM) and warm (IgG) by inhibiting
CD20 cells.

313/1624

Death from autoimmune or warm IgG
hemolysis is very rare. If steroids do
not control the disease and transfusions
do not increase the cell count, IVIG can
work acutely. Azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab are immunosuppressives but take several weeks to
work. Splenectomy prevents recurrences in 70% of patients.

CASE 6: Glucose-6-Phosphate
Dehydrogenase Deficiency
Setting: ED
CC: “My urine is dark.”
VS: R: 25 breaths/minute; BP: 110/70
mm Hg; P: 105 beats/minute; T: 101°F

314/1624

HPI: A 23-year-old man comes to the
ED with complaints of a few hours of
dark urine and fatigue. He had been
having a cough with sputum and fever
for the past 2 days. His condition suddenly got worse after his temperature
went up early today. He has not started
any new medications recently.
PE:
Chest: rales at right base
Abdomen: nontender liver
Neurological: normal
Skin: yellow
Initial Orders:
CBC
Chest x-ray
LFTs
UA
Oximeter

315/1624

Fever, cough, and sputum are clearly a
respiratory infection. The question is:
Why is the patient suddenly fatigued
and why the jaundice?
Laboratory Test Results:
CBC: hematocrit 30%; MCV 90 fL;
WBC and platelet counts normal
Chest x-ray: right lower lobe infiltrate
LFTs: total bilirubin 6.8 mg/dL; direct
bilirubin1.2 mg/dL; LDH elevated,
AST and ALT normal
UA: dipstick positive for blood, but no
RBCs seen
Oximeter: 92% on room air
High indirect bilirubin, high LDH, and
anemia are clear for hemolysis. The
chest x-ray and hypoxia on oximeter indicate pneumonia.
Orders and Results:
Reticulocyte count: 4%

316/1624

Coombs test: negative
Repeat hematocrit: 29%
Start ceftriaxone and azithromycin
Reticulocytes can take several days to
increase to their full range. The negative
Coombs test only really excludes
autoimmune hemolysis. Lack of chronicity excludes PNH. The absence of
splenomegaly and recurrences excludes
hereditary spherocytosis.

Always do a peripheral smear on cases of
hemolysis.

Order and Results:
Peripheral smear: bite cells, no schistocytes, no fragmented cells

317/1624

As you move the clock forward to get
results, you will never lose points by
reviewing the chart too much if you
are uncertain. Bite cells are indicative
of G6PD deficiency.

G6PD catalyzes the initial step in the
hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt.

Which of the following should be
tested first to find G6PD
deficiency?
a. G6PD level
b. Complement levels
c. Brilliant cresyl blue stain for Heinz bodies
d. Genetic studies

318/1624

Answer c. Brilliant cresyl blue stain for
Heinz bodies
Heinz bodies are not visible on routine peripheral blood smear. You can clearly miss
G6PD deficiency by missing Heinz bodies
unless you specifically look for them (Figure
2-4). G6PD levels are normal on the day of
an acute hemolytic event because only older,
deficient cells are destroyed.

319/1624

Figure 2-4. Heinz bodies. Supravital stain. These bodies
are particles of denatured hemoglobin, usually attached to
the inner face of the red blood cell membrane. (Reproduced
with permission from Lichtman MA, et al. Lichtman’s Atlas
of Hematology. 2007, www.accessmedicine.com.)

After acute hemolysis, only cells with a
normal G6PD level are left behind.

Why are there no fragmented cells
in G6PD deficiency?
a. Cells are taken to the spleen for
destruction.
b. Cells “dissolve” or melt rather than
fragment.
c. Cell destruction happens in the spleen.
Answer b. Cells “dissolve” or melt rather
than fragment.

320/1624

In G6PD, deficient cells are destroyed by oxidant stress in the vessels, but they do not
“fragment” into pieces.

G6PD reduces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH).

Oxidants, such as superoxide anion
(O2−) and hydrogen peroxide, are
formed within RBCs, thereby oxidizing
Hb.

Move the clock forward until you have
the result of Heinz body stain. The

321/1624

presence of Heinz bodies and bite cells
are the best you can do to establish a
diagnosis of G6PD deficiency on the
day of the acute hemolytic event.

Heinz bodies are precipitated oxidized
hemoglobin in the RBC membrane.

Which of the following is the most
common cause of acute hemolytic
events in G6PD deficiency?
a. Fava beans
b. Infection
c. Dapsone
d. Primaquine

322/1624

Answer b. Infection
Although the original description of hemolysis in G6PD deficiency was in patients with
malaria who get primaquine, this is far less
common a cause of hemolysis than infection.
Infections are simply a far more common occurrence than the use of dapsone, primaquine, and fava beans although all of these
cause hemolysis.

NADPH is needed for glutathione reductase to protect the cell from oxidant
stress.

323/1624

The follow-up CBC the next day
shows no significant change in
hematocrit. What is the
treatment?
a. Supportive, no specific therapy
b. Steroids
c. Intravenous G6PD
d. IVIGs
Answer a. Supportive, no specific therapy
Nothing reverses the oxidant stress of infection on cells deficient in G6PD. The most deficient cells are destroyed immediately. The
ones with borderline levels will survive with
bite cells and Heinz bodies. You have to wait
2 months and recheck the G6PD level.

324/1624

G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive

X-linked recessive inheritance expresses
almost exclusively in male patients.

CASE 7: Paroxysmal Nocturnal
Hemoglobinuria
Setting: office
CC: “My urine is dark when I get up in
the morning.”
VS: R: 24 breaths/minute; BP: 110/70
mm Hg; P: 78 beats/minutes; T: 97.8°F
HPI: A 24-year-old man with intermittent episodes of dark urine in the morning comes to your office. He has been
feeling “weak and tired” for months. He
gets short of breath when he is walking
up stairs and is easily fatigued. He does

326/1624

not have a fever and has not had any infections in the past.
PMHX: deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
of portal vein 2 years ago treated with 6
months of warfarin
Medications: none
PE:
General: pale and tired, yellow tone to
sclerae
Cardiovascular: 1/6 systolic murmur
Extremities: no edema, no tenderness
Neurological: normal
Initial Orders:
CBC
UA
CHEM-7
LFTs

327/1624

What is the most common cause
of hematuria?
a. Infection
b. Stones
c. Trauma
d. Neoplasia
Answer a. Infection
By far, the most common cause of dark urine
from hematuria is infection, although dysuria (frequency, urgency, burning) should
also be present and is not in this patient.
Renal and bladder stones can certainly be
the cause, but would usually be accompanied
by flank pain. Although 2% to 5% of patients
with renal cell cancer have polycythemia
from excess erythropoietin production, it is
far more common for renal cancer to present
with hematuria and anemia.

328/1624

There is no point in discussing dark urine without first excluding infection.

Move the clock forward only 1 to 2
days. Even though the test results may
come back in just 2 to 4 hours if
ordered “Routine,” do not keep a patient waiting for hours in the office for
these test results. Have the patient go
home and come back to receive the
results.
Reports:
CBC: hematocrit 28%; WBCs 2,800/
μL (low); platelets 94,000/μL (low)
UA: dipstick positive for hemoglobin,
no urobilinogen; no WBCs
CHEM-7: potassium (K) 5.3 mEq/L;
otherwise normal

329/1624

LFTs: indirect bilirubin 4.2 mg/dL
(elevated); LDH elevated

Rapid hemolysis causes hyperkalemia.

Intravascular hemolysis gives hemoglobin in urine, with no RBCs.

Orders:
Peripheral smear
Reticulocyte count
Haptoglobin level
Coombs test

330/1624

Have the patient return the following
day to discuss laboratory test results:
Smear: schistocytes, fragmented cells
Reticulocytes: 14%
Haptoglobin: decreased
Coombs test: negative

Haptoglobin binds and transports newly
released hemoglobin from destroyed
RBCs to spleen and liver for recycling.

Free Hb and iron are damaging to the
kidneys. Haptoglobin grabs it before it
“burns” the kidney.

331/1624

Hb is oxidized in the kidney to
hemosiderin.

What is the mechanism of renal
damage from hemoglobin?
a. Glomerulonephritis
b. Nephrotic syndrome
c. Acute tubular necrosis
d. Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of
antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)
e. Obstruction
Answer c. Acute tubular necrosis
When haptoglobin is used up, free hemoglobin filters in the kidney and oxidizes the
tubules potentially leading to renal failure
from acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Hemosiderin in the urine is an indication of this

332/1624

severe oxidative toxicity to the kidney. Cells
in the tubules and macrophages pick up discarded iron and store it in tissue as hemosiderin. When seen on UA, hemosiderin is a
bad thing. It means enough free iron and
hemoglobin have been released to overwhelm the haptoglobin, and now the macrophages are grabbing it to store it in tubule
cells. The tubule cells then die, slough off,
and end up in the patient’s urine as
hemosiderin.

Steps in Hemosiderin Production and
Renal Injury
1. Macrophages scavenge
bad iron.
2. Macrophages make hemosiderin in
tissue.
3. Hemosiderin “cooks” the tubule cells.

333/1624

4. Dead cells fall into the urine.

Hemosiderin in Urine = Zombie Tubule
Cells

On the Step 3 examination, prognosis
questions are often asked. They are
phrased as: “What can the patient
expect?”
The patient has hemolysis with
pancytopenia. The presence of schistocytes and fragmented cells indicates intravascular hemolysis. The Coombs test
is negative. Haptoglobin is more likely
to be low in intravascular hemolysis.
There is the DVT in an unusual site.

334/1624

Pancytopenia + Intravascular Hemolysis + Clots = PNH

What is the most accurate test to
establish a diagnosis of PNH?
a. Sugar water (sucrose hemolysis) test
b. CD55 and CD59 by flow cytometry
c. Ham test
d. Complement levels
Answer b. CD55 and CD59 by flow
cytometry
CD55 and CD59 are the markers for
complement-removing proteins indicating
the deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), a protein that characterizes PNH.
Normally, complement attaches to cells, but
is removed by certain proteins before they

335/1624

are able to destroy the RBC. These proteins
act as complement-removing factors and are
sometimes
called
decay-accelerating
factors. They anchor to the RBC on GPI.
PNH is a genetic defect in GPI. The
complement-removing proteins do not attach. Cells are then destroyed by
complement.

The mutation-damaging GPI is on the
stem cell.

PNH Stem Cell Defect = Pancytopenia

Which of these is not in the
prognosis of PNH?
a. Iron deficiency anemia

336/1624

b. Myelodysplasia
c. Polycythemia vera
d. Recurrent DVT
e. Acute myeloid leukemia
Answer c. Polycythemia vera
As a clonal stem cell defect, PNH can transform into a number of hematologic malignancies, such as acute leukemia. Aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia are routine findings. The only way to cure PNH, therefore, is
with a bone marrow transplant to remove
the underlying stem cell defect. Because of
the morbidity and mortality associated with
the bone marrow transplant procedure,
treatment with chronic transfusion and iron
replacement is often preferred.

337/1624

The only way to cure PNH is bone marrow transplantation.

What is the original root cause
defect of PNH?
a. The mutation is in the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class A
(PIGA) gene.
b. There is a failure to produce the anchoring protein, GPI.
c. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) or CD55
and CD59 cannot attach.
d. The complement stays attached to the
RBCs.
e. RBCs are destroyed.

338/1624

Answer a. The mutation is in the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis,
class A (PIGA) gene.
The sequence of events in PNH starts with
choice a (PIGA is defective). Without PIGA,
the GPI anchor is not made. Without the GPI
anchor, DAF and CD59 do not attach to the
RBC membrane. Without DAF and CD59,
the complement stays attached and destroys
cells. The root cause of everything, however,
is the defect or mutation in the PIGA gene
(Figure 2-6).

339/1624

Figure 2-6. The complement cascade and the fate of red
blood cells (RBCs). A. Normal red blood cells are protected
from complement activation and subsequent hemolysis by
CD55 and CD59. These two proteins, being glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked, are missing from the surface
of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) red blood
cells as a result of a somatic mutation of the X-linked PIGA
gene that encodes a protein required for an early step of the
GPI molecule biosynthesis.
B. In the steady state, PNH erythrocytes suffer from
spontaneous (tick-over) complement activation, with consequent intravascular hemolysis through formation of the
membrane attack complex (MAC); when extra complement
is activated through the classical pathway, an exacerbation
of hemolysis will result. (Reproduced with permission from
Luzzato L, et al. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and
eculizumab. Haematologica 210;95(4):523−526.)

340/1624

Why is there more hemolysis at night?
Lower respiratory rate increases the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2),
which makes slight acidosis, in turn, activating more complement.

The patient’s low cytometry shows a
deficiency of CD55 and CD59. You get
the message, “This case will end in 5
minutes of real time.” Your final orders should be:
Supplement with iron and folic acid.
Transfuse as needed.
Give steroids when the transfusion
requirement is large.
Give eculizumab to decrease transfusion dependence.

341/1624

Eculizumab is an antibody against C5
complement.

Eculizumab removes complement from
RBCs.

Steroids may diminish complement
activation.

CASE 8: Hemolytic Uremic
Syndrome and Thrombotic
Thrombocytopenic Purpura
Setting: ED

342/1624

CC: “My urine is dark.”
VS: BP: 92/50 mm Hg; P: 125 beats/
minute; T: 102°F
HPI: A 43-year-old man with a recent
diarrheal episode for 5 days arrives at
the ED. He says that dark urine and fatigue developed over the last day. He
has been febrile. There is some blood in
the stool. His skin has been yellow.
Initial Orders:
Normal saline
CHEM-7
LFTs
CBC
UA
Blood cultures
Chest x-ray
When a patient is febrile and tachycardic with a systolic blood pressure <100

343/1624

mm Hg, give fluids while waiting for the
initial set of laboratory test results.
Nothing is more important than hydration in a hypotensive patient. Although
there are no respiratory symptoms, on
CCS it is acceptable to order a chest xray on every patient with a fever.
PE:
Abdomen: mild diffuse tenderness
Chest: clear
Neurological: normal

Fever =
• UA
• Blood cultures
• Chest x-ray

344/1624

Move the clock forward to get laboratory test results:
CHEM-7: blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
34 g/dL; creatinine 1.8 mg/dL
CBC: hematocrit 32%; platelets
78,000/μL
UA: hemoglobin present; no bilirubin
Blood cultures: normal
Chest x-ray: normal
Liver: bilirubin 5 mg/dL, 80% indirect; LDH elevated

What is the most appropriate next
step for this patient?
a. Check the laboratory test results for
hemolysis, hydrate, and observe.
b. Start ciprofloxacin.

345/1624

Answer a. Check the laboratory test results
for hemolysis, hydrate, and observe.
Do not start antibiotics in this patient. With
hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency, HUS is possible. Antibiotics can
worsen HUS.

When antibiotics kill organisms, they release toxin, potentially worsening HUS.

Orders:
CBC
Renal and LFTs
Peripheral smear
Stool culture on sorbitol MacConkey
agar

346/1624

Sorbitol MacConkey agar is the specific
test for Escherichia coli O157:H7.

Escherichia coli O157:H7 slowly ferments sorbitol.

Repeat laboratory test results come
back in 30 minutes in the ED:
CHEM-7: BUN 44 g/dL; creatinine
2.1 mg/dL
CBC: hematocrit 30%; platelets
52,000/μL
Peripheral smear: schistocytes, fragmented cells

347/1624

Do not order either antibiotics or
platelets. Platelets in HUS and TTP
can worsen the disorder by creating
more clumping out of platelets in
small blood vessels.

Escherichia coli O157:H7 elicits a Shiga
toxin.

HUS and thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP) originate from a deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin domain 13
(ADAMTS 13) (Figure 2-7).

348/1624

Figure 2-7. Pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP). Normally, the ultra-high-molecular-weight
multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) produced by the
endothelial cells are processed into smaller multimers by a

349/1624

plasma metalloproteinase called ADAMTS 13. In TTP, the
activity of the protease is inhibited, and the ultra-highmolecular-weight multimers of vWF initiate platelet aggregation and thrombosis. (Reproduced with permission from
Longo DL, et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine,
18th ed. 2012, www.accessmedicine.com.)

You move the clock forward 12 hours
and recheck the laboratory test results
because rising BUN and creatinine
levels, as well as a dropping platelet
count, are very distressing. You will
want to give platelets as the count
drops, especially if it goes below
50,000/μL, but do not do it. They
clump out and precipitate in the brain
and kidney.
On the second hospital day, do an
“Interval History.” The patient is reported as developing confusion. You review
the repeat laboratory test results:

350/1624

CHEM-7: BUN 58 g/dL; creatinine
2.4 mg/dL
CBC: hematocrit 26%; platelets
44,000/μL

ADAMTS 13 dissolves von Willebrand
factor (vWF). Without it, platelets stay
excessively aggregated and adherent.

With worsening renal function, confusion, fever, and intravascular hemolysis, and decreasing platelet concentration, the patient is now defined as
having TTP. You must not give platelets. Instead, order plasmapheresis
when TTP is severe, or as in this case,
worsening.

351/1624

Plasmapheresis in TTP is not done to remove something from the patient’s
blood; it is done to add ADAMTS 13
from normal plasma.

Orders:
Move the patient to the intensive care
unit (ICU).
Repeat CBC, BUN, and creatinine
tests.
Consult hematology (remember, consultants on CCS never tell you what
to do).
Order plasmapheresis.

352/1624

ADAMTS 13 cleaves vWF, freeing platelets from each other.

Plasmapheresis adds ADAMTS 13 back
to the patient.

In the ICU after plasmapheresis, the
patient’s confusion resolves. The platelet count starts to rise and the BUN and
creatinine levels stop decreasing. Sorbitol MacConkey culture grows
Escherichia coli O157:H7.
The case ends with the patient still
in the ICU. If your case continues, transfer the patient back to the hospital floor 1
to 2 days after the BUN, creatinine, and
platelet counts improve.

353/1624

In TTP, 100% of patients have low platelet counts and hemolysis, but only 50%
of the patients have neurologic problems
(Figure 2-8).

CASE 9: Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura
Setting: office
CC: “I have bleeding from my nose.”
HPI: A 32-year-old woman with epistaxis for the past few days visits your
office. The patient says she has a
lifelong history of bleeding, but cannot
remember precisely what the problem is
that she bleeds from. She says “they always give me some pills for a week and
it all gets better.” She has some “dark
spots” on her legs as well. Her menstrual periods can be very heavy at times.
Medications: none regularly

355/1624

PE:
General: healthy appearing
HEENT: moderate epistaxis
Skin: petechiae on bother lower
extremities
Initial Orders: (done stat)
CBC
Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR)
Many offices and large practices have
the ability to do laboratory tests on-site
and can order the tests and request immediate results. On CCS, if you are uncertain what you can order, just place
the order and the program will tell you
if there is anything else you must do to
get the results.
Report Available:

356/1624

CBC: platelet count 27,000/μL
PT, aPTT, INR: all normal

Patients who are unstable can be sent to
the hospital ED. You can order initial
tests and treatments from the office and
then send the person to the higher level
of care.

You move this patient to the ED of the
hospital. Every time you move a patient, all the original orders go with
them unless you specifically stop them.
In the ED, orders are:
Repeat CBC
PT, aPTT, INR
Prednisone

357/1624

Abdominal ultrasound
Hematology evaluation
As you advance the clock, the laboratory test results return:
CBC: platelets: 22,000/μL; hematocrit 40%
PT, aPTT, INR: all normal
Abdominal ultrasound: normal
spleen size
Hematology evaluation: “Your patient has been seen. We have no specific recommendations. Please order
any tests or treatments you feel are
indicated.”

Prednisone decreases the affinity of
macrophages for platelets.

358/1624

Antiplatelet antibodies are too nonspecific to be worthwhile.

One hour after transfer to the ED, the
patient’s bleeding worsens. There is
melena, more petechiae, and hematuria. A repeat CBC shows platelet
level at 8000/μL.

Which is the fastest way to raise
the platelet count in idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)?
a. Prednisone
b. Dexamethasone
e. Platelet transfusion
d. IVIG

359/1624

e. Romiplostim or eltrombopag
Answer d. IVIG
IVIG works faster than any other method of
increasing the platelet count and is more effective. Steroids work by inhibiting the affinity of the macrophage for the Fc end of the
antibodies attached to platelets. Platelet
transfusions do not work because as soon as
the platelets enter the body, they are covered
with antiplatelet antibodies and rapidly
destroyed.

What is the mechanism of IVIG in
increasing platelet count?
a. Inhibition of neutrophils
b. Stimulation of megakaryocyte growth
c. Supersaturation of Fc receptors on
macrophages
d. Inhibition of leukotrienes

360/1624

e. Inhibition of interleukin
Answer c. Supersaturation of Fc receptors
on macrophages
Antiplatelet antibodies cover the surface of
platelets. Macrophages attach to the Fc receptor and “grab” the platelets and bring
them to the spleen for destruction.

Megakaryocytes are produced in very
high amounts in ITP.

No test can diagnose ITP. Bone marrow
is sometimes evaluated to exclude a production problem by finding large numbers of megakaryocytes.

361/1624

IVIG is ordered. Move the clock forward 1 to 2 hours and recheck the
platelet count. If there is severe, lifethreatening bleeding 6 hours after the
start of steroids and IVIG, you may
have to consider platelet transfusion.
Platelet transfusion is rarely done for
three reasons:
1. Bleeding is rarely severe enough to
need platelets.
2. Steroids are usually quite efficacious,
starting within hours.
3. Platelets are consumed as soon as
you infuse them into the patient.

No one knows why ITP occurs.

362/1624

New platelets have an increased size or
“mean platelet volume.”

As you move the clock forward, the
platelet count stabilizes. If this problem recurs, send the patient for evaluation for splenectomy. If you move the
clock forward, and ITP recurs after removing the spleen, start romiplostim
or eltrombopag.

What is the precise location of
platelet destruction in ITP?
a. Intravascular
b. Spleen
c. Kupffer cells of liver
d. Tissue

363/1624

Answer b. Spleen
After being covered with antiplatelet antibodies and grabbed by macrophages, the
platelets are actually destroyed in the spleen.
This is why splenectomy is so effective in
controlling ITP.
No Spleen = No Platelet Removal

Rh0(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) or
anti-D antibodies have nothing to do
with platelets. They stuff up the
macrophages.

Romiplostim and eltrombopag are
thrombopoietin. They stimulate megakaryocyte growth.

364/1624

Rituximab removes CD20 lymphocytes,
which make antibodies against platelets.

ITP cases end when the platelet counts
start to rise and bleeding stops. The
platelet count does not have to increase
to normal levels. It just has to start
rising. Steroids for initial therapy and
adding IVIG for life-threatening bleeding remain the standard of care. The
most likely fundamental of the basic
science question on the Step 3 examination for ITP will be to know the mechanism of how IVIG works. The fragment antigen binding (Fab) end of IVIG
has nothing to do with platelets. IVIG
mechanism is involved entirely with
blocking the macrophage. If the macrophage is fully saturated with Fc ends of

365/1624

IVIG or RhO(D) immune globulin
(RhoGAM) (anti-D antibodies), there is
no room to bind the Fc ends of the immunoglobulins attached to platelets.
Rituximab works by removing the
lymphocytes that make the antibodies
that attack platelets. You know that
rituximab removes CD20-positive
lymphocytes. This is the same mechanism for how it works in cold agglutinin
disease and how it works in rheumatoid
arthritis.
Romiplostim and eltrombopag are
stimulants of megakaryocytes. They are
thrombopoietin. These medications are
used when splenectomy does not control
the disease. It seems that ITP is not entirely a “destruction problem” and that
stimulating production seems to help.

366/1624

CASE 10: Von Willebrand
Disease
Setting: office
CC: “I took aspirin, and when I cut myself shaving I bled for 2 days!”
VS: normal
HPI: A 23-year-old woman who is generally healthy comes to your office because of abnormal bleeding after a
minor cut. It stood out because she usually never takes aspirin, but this time
after using aspirin for a headache, the
skin kept oozing blood for more than 2
days.
PMHX: prolonged bleeding after dental
extraction in past
Medications: none

367/1624

PE:
Skin: bleeding from skin nick/cut when
shaving; some petechiae of lower
extremities
Initial Orders:
CBC
PT and aPTT
CHEM-7
LFTs
Move the clock forward until the time
that says “Report Available” for the
CBC, PT, and aPTT. All bleeding problems need at least these tests. LFTs are
done because most clotting factors are
made in the liver.

Which of these is not made in the
liver?
a. Factor VIII and vWF

368/1624

b. Factor IX and X
c. Fibrinogen
d. Factor II, VII
e. Albumin
Answer a. Factor VIII and vWF
Factor VIII and vWF are made under the endothelial cell lining of the vasculature. That
is precisely where they are needed when a
person is cut and that is where they are both
made and stored. All of the other clotting
factors are made in the liver. That is why the
PT and aPTT tell more about liver function
than the transaminases AST and ALT. You
can damage a tiny part of the liver (<5%) and
have a huge bump up in AST/ALT levels, but
you need to damage 70% to 80% of the liver
before you even begin to see a synthetic abnormality of the clotting factors.

369/1624

Platelet-Related Bleeding
• Skin–petechiae
• Nasal–epistaxis
• Gums and gingiva
• Vaginal

Factor-Related Bleeding
• Joints–hemarthrosis
• Muscles and hematoma

Move the clock 30 to 60 minutes to get
the stat laboratory test report.
CBC: hematocrit 38%; MCV 88 fL;
WBCs 8000/μL; platelets 225,000/
μL (normal)
PT: 12 seconds (normal)

370/1624

aPTT: 70 seconds (abnormally
prolonged)
Chemistry and LFTs: normal; normal LDH

Causes of prolonged aPTT
• Deficiency of factor VIII, IX, XI, XII
• Acquired inhibitors of these factors
• von Willebrand disease (vWD)
• Antiphospholipid syndromes

Why can this not be hemophilia
A?
a. Would not present first at this age
b. Wrong type of bleeding
c. Expressed only in men
d. All of the above

371/1624

Answer d. All of the above
Hemophilia A should present as delayed
bleeding into a joint in a male child.

Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive
disorder:
• Men only
• Y chromosome does not count
• Homozygous females are rare

The patient’s bleeding stops. You send
her home. The “bleeding time” test is
not necessary. You already know she
has prolonged bleeding. Also, the
bleeding time test is too nonspecific to
be useful. Any platelet disorder will
give a prolonged bleeding time.

372/1624

Orders:
vWF antigen level
vWF activity (ristocetin cofactor and
collagen activity) level

vWD is autosomally transmitted, either
dominant or recessive based on subtype.

Which cell in marrow makes
VWF?
a. Neutrophils
b. RBCs
c. Megakaryocytes
d. Lymphocytes
Answer c. Megakaryocytes

373/1624

Besides endothelial cells and the connective
tissue of the vessel wall, vWF is also made by
megakaryocytes.

Why is the aPTT level increased in
vWD?
a. vWF is in the clotting cascade.
b. Factor VIII is bound to vWF.
c. vWD has an antiphospholipid antibody.
Answer b. Factor VIII is bound to vWF.
When vWF level is decreased, it is not there
to bind factor VIII. This elevates the aPTT,
but the function of factor VIII, which is a coagulant factor (the antihemophilic factor A),
is not impaired. The other name for vWF is
“factor VIII antigen.” You should expect to
see an elevated aPTT in half of patients with
vWD.

374/1624

The vWF antigen level is low. The ristocetin cofactor activity level is
markedly impaired. You repeat the
test the patient off aspirin and it persists. There is no active bleeding. This
is likely type I vWD, which is seen in
about 80% of cases. The patient needs
her wisdom teeth removed. You are
planning to give desmopressin acetate
(DDAVP) or desmopressin prior to the
procedure.

What is the mechanism of
DDAVP?
a. Increased production of vWF
b. Increased expression of vWF receptors
c. Inhibition of ADAMTS 13
d. Release of subendothelial stores of vWF
and factor VIII

375/1624

e. Inhibition of plasmin
Answer d. Release of subendothelial stores
of vWF and factor VIII
DDAVP releases what has already been made
under endothelial stores. Aminocaproic acid
and tranexamic acid work by inhibiting
plasmin.

Type I vWD is a deficiency of vWF or
antigen.

vWF acts in two ways:
1. Platelet to platelet IIb/IIIa
(aggregation)
2. Platelet to vessel wall Ib/IX
(adherence)

376/1624

DDAVP is given and the dental extraction is performed. Bleeding persists
and a subsequent dose of DDAVP is
ineffective.

At this point, what medication
should you use?
a. Aminocaproic acid
b. Factor VIII replacement
c. Protamine sulfate
d. Steroids
Answer b. Factor VIII replacement
Factor VIII and vWF (antigen) travel bound
together. That is why you can use DDAVP for
hemophilia treatment and you can use factor
VIII replacement of vWD. Thrombin splits
factor VIII off vWF. Aminocaproic acid is a

377/1624

plasmin inhibitor of marginal value. Protamine reverses heparin.

Type I vWD is autosomal dominant–half
of children inheriting the gene mutation
will be affected.

After giving factor VIII replacement,
the bleeding stops. Counsel the patient
not to use aspirin or aspirin-containing
products. Advance the clock until you
get the “Case will end in 5 minutes of
real time” screen. No additional orders
are necessary.

CASE 11: Clotting Factor
Deficiency

378/1624

Setting: office
CC: “My surgeon told me to see about
my bleeding risk before surgery.”
HPI: A 50-year-old woman comes to
see you about an elevated aPTT that her
surgeon found prior to a planned
lumpectomy for breast cancer. She had
her screening mammogram at age 50
years and a small abnormality was
found. Needle biopsy showed infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Bleeding was not
excessive at the time of the biopsy. The
patient is perimenopausal now and her
menstrual periods have always been
modest in intensity, lasting 3 to 4 days.
PMHX: normal vaginal delivery for
children; no additional bleeding
Medications: none
PE: normal

379/1624

Initial Orders:
CBC
PT, aPTT, INR
LFTs

Hemophilia is not expressed in women.

Hemophilia does not present at this age
without abnormal bleeding.

Move the clock forward 1 week to get
test results. This is a preoperative
clearance case and is not an emergency. In preoperative clearance
cases, never write the phrase “cleared

380/1624

for surgery.” If there is nothing to do,
write “Medically optimal for procedure. No further medical management
needed prior to procedure.”
Laboratory Test Results:
CBC and LFTs: normal
PT and INR: normal
aPTT: prolonged to 65 seconds
Order a mixing study first when evaluating clotting factor deficiencies. Any
clotting factor deficiency will correct
to a normal aPTT when mixed 50:50
with normal plasma. This is because
the clotting factor level has to be decreased by 70% to 80% before the
aPTT will even begin to elevate. Often,
the coagulation test will not be abnormal until the clotting factor deficiency
is as much as 85% to 90%.

381/1624

If the aPTT does not correct or attain a normal level when mixed with
normal plasma, it likely means the
presence of a clotting factor inhibitor.
Acquired inhibitors of factor VIII and
IX can occur with aging and may not
have serious pathologic significance.
However, factor inhibitors can be
caused by cancer.

Deficiencies correct aPTT to normal.
Inhibitors do not correct to normal.

The mixing study shows a normalization of aPTT. Order a hematology consultation to show that you “know
when to get help,” but remember that

382/1624

consultants will never tell you concretely what to do.
Because this is a clotting factor deficiency, you should order specific clotting factor levels. The patient’s gender
and age eliminate the possibility of
hemophilia.
Orders:
Factor XI level
Factor XII level

Factor XII deficiency is never associated
with bleeding and never needs
treatment.

383/1624

Factor XIII deficiency does cause bleeding, but it is not in the clotting cascade,
so aPTT is normal.

Factor XIII is “clot stabilizing factor”
and may make fibrin permanently resistant to the effects of plasmin.

Reports:
Factor XI 15% of normal level
Factor XII 90% of normal level
Because the patient does not bleed under normal activity, there is no regular
therapy to use. With a lumpectomy, the
patient is about to undergo a serious
operative procedure. You should tell

384/1624

the surgeon to give her fresh frozen
plasma (FFP) an hour prior to the procedure. Factor XI replacement is not
available in the United States. The
value of aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid for surgical procedures with
factor XI deficiency is not clear. Both
agents inhibit plasmin and prevent the
breakdown of fibrin. The basic science
mechanism question is clear. Whether
to use them before operative procedures in factor XI deficiency is not clear.

Give FFP before operative procedures to
patients with factor XI deficiency.

FFP has all clotting factors except:

385/1624

• Factor VIII
• vWF

CASE 12: Thrombophilia (Hypercoagulable States): Deep
Venous Thrombosis and
Heparin-Induced
Thrombocytopenia
Setting: ED
CC: “My leg is swollen.”
VS: R: 14 breaths/minute; BP: 126/86
mm Hg; P: 84 beats/minute; T: 100.8°F
HPI: A 34-year-old woman comes to
your hospital ED by taxicab after getting off a plane from Gujarat, India. She
developed pain in her leg that she

386/1624

noticed when disembarking from the
plane. Her leg feels tight and “swollen.”
She denies dyspnea, chest pain, or lightheadedness.
PMHX: tobacco smoker
Medications: oral contraceptives
PE:
Cardiovascular: normal
Chest: normal
Extremities: swelling of left leg, warm
to touch

Homans sign (pain in calf on dorsiflexion) has limited accuracy.

387/1624

A pain in the leg after a long flight
and immobility is a clear risk for DVT.
But even a long plane ride should not
be enough to make a normal person
clot. Plane rides unmask underlying
thrombophilia (hypercoagulable
state). This history, however, is
enough to warrant therapy without
waiting for results of duplex
ultrasound.
Initial Orders:
Lower extremity duplex ultrasound
Enoxaparin (low molecular weight
heparin [LMWH])
Chest x-ray
Oximeter
CBC, INR, PT, aPTT

388/1624

Clots, such as DVT or pulmonary embolus, give fever.

Results:
The duplex ultrasound shows a large
clot in the femoral vein.
The chest x-ray, CBC, and oximeter
results are all normal.
Even though the patient denies dyspnea, on CCS you can order “extra”
tests that are reasonably related to the
chief complaint. You will not lose
points for getting an x-ray or oximeter
for someone at risk of pulmonary embolus (PE). You will not lose points for
getting a baseline CBC in someone you
are potentially going to anticoagulate.

389/1624

Orders:
Enoxaparin to continue
subcutaneously
Warfarin with target INR 2 to 3

You do not have to order a thrombophilia evaluation for the first clot.

Warfarin inhibits factors II, VII, IX, and
X.

The patient should not be admitted to
the hospital just for a DVT. The patient can inject her own LMWH and be

390/1624

discharged with follow-up by her own
doctor or an ambulatory care clinic. It
takes at least 2 to 3 days for the INR
to change in response to warfarin.
Warfarin only stops production of
new clotting factors, it does not alter
the effect of clotting factors already
present.

Make sure you advise the patient to stop
smoking!

Warfarin causes skin necrosis with protein C deficiency because protein C is an
anticoagulant.

391/1624

Protein C:
• It has the shortest half-life of any
factor.
• It is vitamin K dependent.
• Warfarin removes the anticoagulant.

The patient is moved to the “Home”
location. Move the clock 3 days forward for a visit in the office location.
Perform “Interval History” to check
symptoms. You will need to check the
INR every 1 to 2 days until the patient
reaches a “steady state” on her warfarin dose.

392/1624

Which form of thrombophilia
should be tested for this patient?
a. None
b. Protein C
c. Protein S
d. Antithrombin III
e. Antiphospholipid (APL) syndrome
f. Factor V Leiden mutation
g. Homocysteine
Answer a. None
It is an attractive choice to want to test for a
form of thrombophilia in this patient. It just
does not matter on the first clot. The intensity of warfarin to an INR of 2 to 3 is the same
whether there is a thrombophilia or not. The
duration of anticoagulation is the same at 6
months. None of these thrombophilias is
proven to need lifelong anticoagulation with

393/1624

a single clot. In this patient’s case, the main
management is to tell her to stop smoking
and stop using oral contraceptives.

Orders:
CBC
INR
The patient’s CBC is normal. After 3
days on warfarin, the patient’s INR is
1.5. You advise the patient strongly to
stop smoking and stop using oral contraceptives as a form of contraception.
She needs to continue enoxaparin
(LMWH) for several more days until
her INR is <2.

394/1624

Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant just like protein C.

You have a daily check of the INR with
the patient coming to the office each
day. Three days later (after 6 days of
warfarin), her INR is 2.1 and you stop
enoxaparin. Advise the patient that
she will need 6 months of therapy and
that she should come in every 2 to 3
days for INR monitoring until you
know the level is stable.

Factor V Leiden mutation is the most
common genetic cause of thrombophilia.

395/1624

Mechanism of Factor V Mutation
• Factor V does not respond to protein
C.
• Protein C usually inhibits factor V.
• When mutated, factor V is resistant to
protein C.
• The mechanism is the same as that in
protein C deficiency.

Over the next 6 months, the patient’s
INR stays in the range of 2 to 3 and
she is asymptomatic. Warfarin is
stopped. A year later she develops
shortness of breath over a few hours.

396/1624

Which form of thrombophilia is
most likely to have a recurrent
clot?
a. All are equal
b. Protein C
c. Protein S
d. Antithrombin III
e. APL syndrome
f. Factor V Leiden mutation
g. Homocysteine
Answer e. APL syndrome
APL is most likely to recur and it is the only
form of thrombophilia in which you may
consider lifelong therapy with warfarin from
the first clot. Because this patient does not
have lupus or any other sign of autoimmune
disease, there was no point in testing her.
The most likely cause of this person’s clot

397/1624

was smoking
contraception.

in

a

person

on

oral

The patient in the ED is markedly hypoxic and tachycardic. A CT angiogram
shows a clot. Her blood pressure is
normal and thrombolytics are not
used. She is given a bolus of IV unfractionated heparin. The follow-up aPTT
shows little elevation. A second IV bolus of heparin is given with only a
slight rise in aPTT.

What is the reason for lack of
response to IV heparin?
a. All are equal
b. Protein C
c. Protein S
d. Antithrombin III

398/1624

e. APL syndrome
f. Factor V Leiden mutation
g. Homocysteine
Answer d. Antithrombin III
When a patient is resistant to the effects of
IV heparin, it is most likely from antithrombin deficiency. Heparin works through potentiating the effects of antithrombin. Antithrombin is a misnomer in that it inhibits
the effect of not only thrombin, but also the
effect of all the clotting factors in the whole
cascade. You recognize it when you bolus
with IV heparin and there is no response.

APL Syndromes
• Lupus anticoagulant
• Anticardiolipin antibodies
• May raise aPTT, but cause clotting

399/1624

The Russell viper venom test is the most
accurate test for lupus anticoagulant.

The patient becomes stable by the end
of the first hospital day. Heparin is
continued. Warfarin is started. On the
third hospital day, the platelet count
begins to drop from 170,000/μL to
120,000/μL to 100,000/μL.

After stopping heparin, what is
most appropriate course of
action?
a. Give antiplatelet factor IV antibodies
b. Order serotonin release assay
c. Start argatroban
d. Start enoxaparin

400/1624

Answer c. Start argatroban
Argatroban is a direct-acting thrombin inhibitor. There is no cross-reaction with heparin. Enoxaparin is a type of heparin. You
must stop all forms of heparin when faced
with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
(HIT).
It is not appropriate to wait for confirmatory laboratory testing for HIT. Although
antiplatelet factor IV antibodies and serotonin release assay are the most accurate tests,
it is more important to switch therapy.

HIT presents with thrombosis, not
bleeding. Platelets “clump out.”

CHAPTER 3

403/1624

ENDOCRINOLOGY
CASE 1: Diabetes—Initial Diagnosis and Treatment
Setting: office
CC: “I get thirsty a lot.”
VS: R: 12 breaths/minute; BP: 144/92
mm Hg
HPI: A 53-year-old man comes for
evaluation of his borderline high blood
pressure (BP) and some intermittent
sense of increased thirst. The patient
has had BP readings of 134/86 mm Hg,
148/96 mm Hg, and 142/90 mm Hg on
the last three visits. He has been reluctant to start antihypertensive

404/1624

medications and, instead, has been trying to correct it with exercise and
weight loss. He has been trying for 9
months. His weight has increased by 4
lb.
PMHX: obesity
ROS: increased frequency of urination,
no burning, no urgency, no hesitancy
Medications: none
PE:
General: comfortable
Heart, Lung, Abdomen: normal
Initial Orders: (obtained fasting)
Basic metabolic panel (CHEM-7)
Complete blood count (CBC)
Urinalysis (UA)
Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)

405/1624

Lipid panel (low-density lipoprotein
[LDL], high-density lipoprotein
[HDL], triglycerides, total cholesterol)
If the case gives the option for examining laboratory test results on the same
day as the original visit, do so. If not,
then reschedule the patient for the following week on the computer-based
case simulation (CCS).

Always do an “Interval History” on any
patient returning for a new office
appointment.

There is no change in the patient’s
symptoms of intermittent thirst and

406/1624

inability to control his weight with diet
and exercise.
Laboratory Test Results:
CHEM-7: glucose 218 mg/dL; blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) 22 g/dL; creatinine 0.7 mg/dL; bicarbonate 24
mEq/L; potassium (K) 4.0 mEq/L
CBC: normal
UA: mild glucose (100 mg/dL); no
white blood cells, no red blood cells
HbA1c: 8.4%
Lipid panel (LDL, HDL, triglycerides,
total cholesterol): LDL 145 mg/dL,
others normal

Obesity increases annually and so does
diabetes.

407/1624

Adipose tissue must have insulin for
glucose to enter.

More Obesity = More Tissue Resistance = More Insulin Need

Insulin uses a tyrosine kinase receptor
(Figure 3-1).

408/1624

Figure 3-1. Model of insulin receptor signaling. The insulin
receptor is composed of two and two subunits linked by disulfide bonds. Binding of insulin to the extracellular subunits activates a tyrosine kinase present in the cytoplasmic
domain of the subunit. The activated kinase autophosphorylates specific tyrosine residues in the subunit. Receptor kinase activation is also the critical first step in a cascade
of intracellular events that begins with phosphorylation of

409/1624

multiple docking proteins (insulin receptor substrates
[IRSs]). Once activated, these multifunctional proteins initiate complex intracellular signaling pathways. Binding of
IRS to phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-K) initiates one
of the major pathways effecting carbohydrate, protein, and
lipid metabolism, including translocation of the glucose
transporter, GLUT-4, to the cell surface and the inactivation, by phosphorylation, of glycogen synthase kinase 3
(GSK3) and subsequent dephosphorylation and activation
of glycogen synthase, thus stimulating glucose storage. In
contrast, mitogenic effects of insulin are mediated by a
mitogen-activating protein (MAP) kinase pathway. (Reproduced with permission from McPhee SJ, Hammer GD.
Pathophysiology of Disease: An Introduction to Clinical
Medicine, 6th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2010.)

Lifestyle modifications of weight loss
and exercise have already failed in
this patient. You should stil l order
“Advise,” “Educate,” and “Counsel” for
both as well as a diabetic diet.
However, given the increase in weight
despite 6 months of previous efforts,
you need to start medications. The

410/1624

same is true for hyperlipidemia. Metformin is the best initial therapy for
obesity-related type 2 diabetes. It will
not cause hypoglycemia and it will not
increase weight. Sulfonylurea medications will do both of these things.

If people could do it, weight loss and exercise would eliminate 25% of diabetes
immediately.

Exercising muscle does not need insulin.
Resting muscle does need insulin.

411/1624

What receptor is affected most by
exercise?
a. GLUT1 in brain
b. GLUT2 in kidney and bowl
c. GLUT3 in neurons
d. GLUT4 in skeletal muscle
Answer d. GLUT4 in skeletal muscle
Exercise does not affect any of the glucose
transporters except the one in skeletal
muscle.

Diagnosis of Diabetes
• HbA1c >6.5%
• Two fasting glucose test results >125
mg/dL
• Oral glucose tolerance test

412/1624

• Single glucose test result >200 mg/dL
with symptoms

Orders:
Metformin
Statin medication
Advise weight loss, exercise, diabetic
diet
Salt-restricted diet
Nutrition evaluation
Urine microalbumin

Neural tissue does not use insulin for
glucose transport.

413/1624

What is the mechanism of the
patient’s polyuria?
a. Saturation of SGLT2 in the proximal
tubule
b. Insufficient insulin at the kidney tubule
c. Deficient antidiuretic hormone (ADH) effect at the collecting duct
d. Deficient ADH release from the posterior
pituitary
e. Saturation of glucose transporters in the
distal tubule
Answer a. Saturation of SGLT2 in the proximal tubule
The threshold for beginning to spill glucose
into urine is a serum glucose level above
about 180 to 200 mg/dL. This level drops
with age and older people will spill glucose
into urine at a lower blood level. The receptor for glucose on the tubule lumen side is the

414/1624

SGLT2. This is a cotransporter with sodium.
Transport maximum for the tubule is about
375 mg/dL. This means all glucose reabsorption is fully maximized at all the tubules at a
serum glucose level of 375 mg/dL. Between
200 and 375 mg/dL, you can still increase
glucose reabsorption because not all the
nephrons hit 100% saturation at the same
blood level.

Nephrons are a “parallel circuit.” Not all
saturate at the same glucose level.

SGLT2 receptors in the kidney are in the
proximal tubule.

415/1624

The patient returns in 1 week. His
symptoms of thirst and polyuria have
already improved. He had been getting up three times a night to urinate
and now it is only once. He is fully adherent to metformin and statin. His
BP is 138/92 mm Hg, and microalbumin is present in his urine.

Metformin works by blocking
gluconeogenesis.

Drugs that increase insulin level drive
glucose and lipids into cells, including
adipose tissue cells.

416/1624

Because metformin does not increase insulin level, it does not increase weight
gain.

Because the patient has microalbuminuria, an angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should be
started. All ACE inhibitors are totally
identical therapeutically in terms of
their benefit. The only difference is
dosing, which is not covered on CCS.
The BP goal in a diabetic patient is
<130/80 mm Hg, so this patient needs
to start an ACE inhibitor to control BP
as well. There is no point in checking
the HbA1c level so soon after starting
oral hypoglycemic medications. It
takes 1 to 2 months for HbA1c to have
a meaningful change.

417/1624

Red blood cells live 90 to 120 days.
HbA1c measures average glucose over
this time.

Orders:
ACE inhibitor (enalapril, lisinopril,
ramipril)
Serum glucose

What is the mechanism of ACE
inhibitor benefit for
microalbuminuria?
a. Dilation of afferent arteriole increases
glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
b. Dilation of efferent arteriole decreases
glomerular hypertension.
c. Decreased BP protects the tubules.
d. Aldosterone inhibition affects the kidney.

418/1624

Answer b. Dilation of efferent arteriole decreases glomerular hypertension.
Angiotensin II (ANGII) normally constricts
the efferent arteriole. ACE inhibitors inhibit
ANGII and dilate the efferent arteriole. This
will have a brief effect on decreasing GFR,
but overall, decreasing intraglomerular pressure protects the kidney vasculature from
damage. This is similar to how decreasing
hypertension decreases the risk of stroke or
coronary disease. Briefly, there is decreased
perfusion pressure, but in the long term, it
protects the vasculature of both the brain
and the heart.

ACE inhibitors decrease hydrostatic
pressure in the glomerular capillary.

419/1624

Metformin is contraindicated in renal
insufficiency to avoid lactic acidosis.

The patient is given prescriptions for
lisinopril, metformin, and a statin. A
prescription is also given for a home
BP monitor and fingerstick glucose
monitoring. He returns in 2 weeks and
his BP is 132/84 mm Hg. His home
glucose test results are: 182 mg/dL,
170 mg/dL, 184 mg/dL, 165 mg/dL.
Because the patient’s glucose levels
are not fully controlled on metformin,
add a second agent. It is not clear
which one to use and the Step 3 examination will not ask you unless there is
a specific contraindication to one of
them.

420/1624

Everyone on a statin should have aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) checked.

Orders:
Add a second oral hypoglycemic
medication.
Sulfonylurea (e.g., glyburide, glipizide, glimepiride)
Thiazolidinedione (e.g.,
rosiglitazone)
Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor (e.g., sitagliptin, saxagliptin,
linagliptin)
Order liver function tests (LFTs)
Bring the patient back in 1 week to the
office. The second agent will have

421/1624

started to work, but sulfonylureas
may not have a peak effect for 2 to 3
weeks. If your case presents a person
2 to 3 months after the start of treatment, obtain an HbA1c measurement.

Mechanism of Action
• Sulfonylurea increases insulin release
from the pancreas.
• Thiazolidine increases peripheral insulin sensitivity.
• DPP-IV blocks the metabolism of incretins and increases the level of glucagonlike peptide (GLP) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP).

422/1624

Incretins (GIP and GLP) increase insulin
and decrease glucagon release from the
pancreas.

The patient returns in 2 weeks and he
is on two oral hypoglycemic medications. His BP is 124/78 mm Hg. His
home glucose test results are: 124 mg/
dL, 136 mg/dL, 120 mg/dL, and 128
mg/dL. The goal of LDL is <100 mg/dL
in diabetes because it is an equivalent
of coronary disease. Keep moving the
clock forward doing vaccinations and
health maintenancein diabetes until
you get the screen that says, “Case ends
in 5 minutes of real time.” The complication of diabetes and routine preventive medicine will be covered in the next
case.

423/1624

CASE 2: Diabetes—Prevention
of Complications
Setting: office
CC: “I am here to follow up on my
medication.”
VS: blood pressure: 134/94 mm Hg;
pulse rate: 84 beats/minute
HPI: A 54-year-old man, who was diagnosed with diabetes last year, comes to
your office for a follow-up appointment.
He was placed on metformin and a sulfonylurea, which controlled his glucose
levels for most of the last year. Currently, he has started to have some episodes of nocturia one to two times a
night. He insists he is fully adherent to
his medications.

424/1624

PMHX:
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
Microalbuminuria
Medications:
Metformin, atorvastatin, lisinopril,
glimepiride
Initial Orders:
HbA1c
CHEM-7
LFTs
UA, urine microalbumin
Lipid panel (LDL, HDL, triglycerides,
total cholesterol)
The patient returns 1 week later to receive the results of his laboratory tests:
HbA1c: 7.8%
Serum glucose: 195 mg/dL

425/1624

UA negative for protein, small glucose
found; positive urine microalbumin
Transaminases normal
LDL: 80 mg/dL, others normal

Microalbuminuria is caused by a loss of
negative charges on the glomerular
basement membrane.

Statins cause LFT elevation much more
often than causing creatinine kinase
level elevation.

The HbA1c goal level is <7%.

426/1624

Although the patient’s HbA1c concentration is not much above the target,
he is having a recurrence of his symptoms of polyuria. Also, the goal of BP
in a diabetic is <130/80 mm Hg. You
have to add an additional agent. It is
not clear which medication to add as
the second drug in a diabetic.

Where is the majority of glucose
absorbed in the nephron?
a. Proximal tubule
b. Loop of Henle
c. Distal tubule
d. Collecting duct
Answer a. Proximal tubule

427/1624

One hundred percent of glucose should be
absorbed by the end of the proximal tubule.
There should be no glucose entering the loop
of Henle. Some nephrons begin to saturate
the SGLT transporter at a serum glucose
level of 200 mg/dL. This is “threshold.” All
are saturated at glucose level 375 mg/dL.
Any rise in serum glucose level above 375
mg/dL will go straight into the urine.

Insulin has no effect on the secondary
active transport of the proximal tubule.

Any Glucose in Urine = Some Blood
Glucose Levels >200 mg/dL

428/1624

The transport maximum for the tubule
375 mg/dL.
No further increase in reabsorption is
possible.

You add a calcium channel blocker or
beta-blocker as the second antihypertensive agent. Never combine an ACE
inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor
blocker (ARB). Even though the mechanisms are different, there is no efficacy in combining them. Besides BP
control, there is nothing more you can
do to prevent proteinuria when a patient is on an ACE inhibitor.
Orders:
Amlodipine
Sitagliptin

429/1624

Continue lisinopril, atorvastatin,
metformin, glimepiride

Thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone)
• Increase peripheral insulin sensitivity
• Contraindicated in congestive heart
failure (CHF) and fluid overload

Glucose reabsorption is by secondary
active transport with sodium.
It is the same mechanism in the small
bowel.

430/1624

DPP-IV breaks down incretins (GIP and
GLP).

The patient does not return for 2
months. He says, “I am fine; my fingersticks are all 110 to 135 and my
home BP monitor shows 110 over 70 to
125 over 75.” His nocturia has resolved. His weight is 7 lb less than the
last visit, which you ascribe to the
DPP-IV inhibitor, sitagliptin. He is
sometimes constipated by it, but it
does not bother him.

What is the mechanism of weight
loss with DPP-IV inhibitors?
a. GIP slows gastric motility.

431/1624

b. Lower glucose slows motility—glucose is
cathartic.
c. GLP stimulates motilin release.
d. DPP-IV drugs decrease acetylcholine.
Answer a. GIP slows gastric motility.
Gastric motility is directly slowed by incretins such as GIP. The old name for GIP was
“gastric inhibitory peptide.” Motilin does increase gastric motility, but GLP does not
stimulate it. The other gastrointestinal (GI)
tract hormones secretin and cholecystokinin
also decrease gastric motility. DPP-IV inhibitors block the metabolism of incretins. Exenatide and liraglutide on injectable medications that are long-lasting synthetic
incretins.

432/1624

Exenatide (synthetic GIP produces significant weight loss by slowing stomach
motility.

Calcium channel blockers also cause
constipation by inhibiting intestinal
smooth muscle.

The patient’s current vital signs and
laboratory test results are:
BP <130/80 mm Hg
LDL <100 mg/dL
HbA1c <7%
On CCS, if you are moving the clock
forward and if the case does not end, it

433/1624

may mean it is waiting for you to do
routine health maintenance and preventive medicine.
Orders:
Dilated ophthalmologic examination
(refer to ophthalmology)
Monofilament examination of the feet
The eye examination shows nonproliferative retinopathy at this time. The foot
examination is normal. The patient is
maintained for a long time on the same
medications. If your case shows complicationson a return visit much later, the
responses are:
Neuropathy: Start gabapentin, lamotrigine, or pregabalin.
Constipation or diabetic gastroparesis: Start erythromycin or
metoclopramide.

434/1624

Proliferative retinopathy: Inject vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) inhibitors or do laser
photocoagulation.

Mechanism of Complication of Diabetes
Neuropathy:
• Peripheral nerves have blood vessels
feeding them or “vasonervorum.” Diabetes damages this microvasculature
and starves peripheral nerves.
Gastroparesis:
• Diabetics have a decreased ability to
sense gastric and intestinal distention,
which is a part of neuropathy that also
affects GI tracts.
• Motilin is decreased; erythromycin increases motilin release.

435/1624

Proliferative Retinopathy:
• Blood flow to the retina is decreased
from microvascular insufficiency.
• Distal vessels release humoral factors
that stimulate vessel growth.
• Overgrown vessels in the retina block
vision (Figure 3-2).
• VEGF inhibitors stop the abnormal
new vessels from growing and blocking
vision.
• Ranibizumab and bevacizumab are
VEGF inhibitors that stop macular degeneration and inhibit diabetic
retinopathy.
• Laser photocoagulation decreases production of these growth factors (Figure
3-3).

CASE 3: Diabetic Ketoacidosis
Setting: emergency department (ED)
CC: “He is confused and breathing fast.”
VS: R: 34 breaths/minute; BP: 106/68
mm Hg; P: 122 beats/minute; T: 99.8°F
HPI: A 34-year-old man with a history
of type 1 diabetes is brought to the ED
by his family for confusion and lethargy
for the last day. The patient has been a
lifelong diabetic who also has some unclear psychiatric issues. The family says
he stopped taking his insulin a few days
ago for unclear reasons—he may have
just run out of his medications.
PE:
General: lethargic, disoriented, rolling
around in bed, respiratory distress

439/1624

Chest: clear to auscultation
Abdomen: soft, nontender
Cardiovascular: no murmur, no gallop
Neurological: unable to determine
whether there are focal deficits
Initial Orders:
CHEM-7
Normal saline (NS) bolus
Arterial blood gas (ABG)
UA
Acetone, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels
Electrocardiogram (ECG)

What is the single most important
test in diabetic ketoacidosis
(DKA)?
a. Glucose level
b. pH
c. Ketone and/or acetone levels

440/1624

d. Serum osmolarity
Answer b. pH
The glucose level is not as important as
knowing if the patient is acidotic. Glucose
levels can fluctuate wildly from high to medium, but if the patient’s pH on an ABG or serum bicarbonate on chemistry is near normal,
it does not matter. The same is true of
ketones, acetone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, or
acetoacetate. The level of these ketone bodies
is not as important as the level of accumulated acid.

Glucose, ketones, and osmolarity are not
as important as pH and bicarbonate
levels.

441/1624

Move the clock forward the absolute
minimum amount of time needed to
get results of the ABG. Recheck vital
signs and consult the intensive care
unit if it has not already been done.
Re-bolus with intravenous (IV) fluids.
Use NS or Ringer lactate. More than
half the problem in DKA is inadequate
amounts of fluid.
Laboratory Test Results:
CHEM-7:
Glucose 725 mg/dL
Bicarbonate 12 mEq/L
Chloride 100 mEq/L
K 6.4 mEq/L
Sodium 126 mEq/L

442/1624

ABG: pH 7.12; partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) 28 mm Hg; partial
pressure of oxygen (PO2) 95 mm Hg
UA: glucose 1000 mg/dL; ketones
+++
Acetone, beta-hydroxybutyrate
levels: markedly elevated
ECG: sinus tachycardia, normal T
wave, no ST abnormalities
Glucose 100 Up = Sodium 1.6 Down

For every 100 mg/dL above normal
glucose level, sodium level is decreased
by 1.6 mEq/L.

443/1624

What is the mechanism of the
artificial decrease in sodium?
a. It is a laboratory artifact.
b. Acid interferes with sodium
measurement.
c. Hyperglycemia pulls water out of cells, diluting out the sodium.
d. Ketone bodies bind sodium, removing it
from circulation.
Answer c. Hyperglycemia pulls water out of
cells, diluting out the sodium.
Knowing the numerical relationship between
sodium and glucose is indispensable to accurately assessing the anion gap. In addition,
because hyponatremia causes confusion and
hyperglycemia causes confusion, it is important to be able to address and correct the
proper abnormality. When glucose levels
markedly increase, it pulls water out of cells.

444/1624

Because the total number of sodium molecules do not change, the extra water in the
vascular space drives the sodium level down.

Insulin uses a tyrosine kinase receptor.

Acid stimulates hyperventilation at the
brainstem.

What is the mechanism of
hyperkalemia?
a. Transcellular shift (exchange) for acid
(H+)
b. Failure of renal excretion
c. Cell lysis

445/1624

d. Potassium bound by ketone bodies
Answer a. Transcellular shift (exchange)
for acid (H+)
When acid or hydrogen ions (H+) build up in
the blood, the majority of live cells in the
body buffer the acid by absorbing it. To
maintain electrical neutrality, the cells will
release a K+ for each H+ it picks up. In addition, insulin drives potassium into cells with
glucose. If there is no insulin, the cells will
not receive potassium. Also, insulin has a
direct stimulatory effect on sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ATPase). Without insulin, the cells will not
pick up insulin by stimulation of Na+/K+ATPase.

446/1624

Did you know insulin stimulate Na+/K+ATPase to drive K+ into cells?

Two liters of NS were given in the first
hour. A meaningful fluid bolus is 20
mL/kg. Repeat the chemistry level
every 1 to 2 hours to guide fluid and
insulin dosing and to determine the
need for IV bicarbonate. It is not precisely clear when IV bicarbonate is
needed, but for most cases, when the
pH is <7.2, it is acceptable to use.
Orders:
IV insulin continuous drip
NS bolus
CHEM-7
Venous blood gas

447/1624

Move the patient to the intensive care
unit (ICU) if not done

Hyperkalemia is expected in all patient’s
with metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap.

Why is the K+ level increased?
There is a transcellular shift with H+.
There is no insulin to drive Na+/K+ATPase.

448/1624

What is the difference between
venous pH and arterial pH?
a. Venous < Arterial
b. Arterial > Venous
c. Equal
Answer c. Equal
If there is no respiratory disease, arterial and
venous pH should be essentially equal. A difference of a few hundredths of a point is clinically irrelevant. This is why you can use venous blood gasses (VBGs) to monitor DKA response to management. There is no reason to
torture patients with the pain of an arterial
puncture for no reason when you can do a
venous puncture.

449/1624

Use venous blood gasses to monitor
DKA response to therapy.

Move the clock forward every 15 to 30
minutes for the first hour or two. Use
“Interval History” to see if there is a
clinical response to the use of fluids
and insulin. There should be a measurable effect within 30 minutes to IV insulin and massive volume replacement. If there is no improvement, repeat the “bolus NS” and “IV insulin”
orders.
Orders:
VBG
CHEM-7
NS bolus

IV insulin

What is the mechanism of
lethargy and confusion in DKA?
a. Acid inhibits neural transmission.
b. Hyponatremia is the mechanism.
c. Hyperosmolarity dehydrates brain cells.
d. Hyperkalemia interferes with neural
transmission.
Answer c. Hyperosmolarity dehydrates
brain cells.
Serum osmolarity is usually dependent entirely on serum sodium content. In severe
hyperglycemia, the extremely high glucose
level acts as an osmotic draw on brain cells.
This dehydrates them, and central nervous
system (CNS) neural function, especially for

451/1624

cognitive purposes,
dehydrated.

is

worse

when

Serum Osmolarity = (2 × Serum
Sodium [mEq/
L]) + (Glucose
[mg/dL]/18) +
(BUN [g/dL]/
2.8)

The brain does not think well with high
osmolarity sucking out the water.

The brain switches to using ketones for
fuel.

452/1624

After 2 hours, the patient’s lethargy
resolves, and normal mentation returns. The repeat laboratory test results are:
Glucose 245 mg/dL
K 4.8 mEq/L
Serum bicarbonate 18 mEq/L
pH 7.32

What is the biggest change you
must make in management?
a. Stop IV insulin; switch to subcutaneous
delivery.
b. Switch to oral fluids.
c. Add potassium to fluids.
d. Move the patient out of ICU.
Answer c. Add potassium to fluids.

453/1624

As the potassium starts to drop into the normal range, add potassium replacement. This
is because the body becomes massively depleted of potassium because of the metabolic
acidosis. Acidosis takes potassium out of
cells. High blood potassium is excreted at the
kidney to protect the heart from fatal arrhythmia. When acidosis corrects, potassium
shifts back into cells and blood levels will
drop below normal.

During acidosis, potassium is excreted
from kidneys.

The body becomes massively depleted of
potassium during metabolic acidosis.

454/1624

Potassium is added to routine IV fluids.
Repeat the VBG every 2 hours until the
pH nears the normal 7.4.
You do not have to wait for the
ketones to disappear to transfer the patient out of the ICU. The ketone bodies
are like garbage that needs time to clear
away.
When serum bicarbonate level rises
above 20 to 22 mEq/L and pH is above
7.35, you can transfer the patient out of
the ICU.

When cells cannot take up glucose because of a lack of insulin, they switch to
lipids and free fatty acids as an alternate
fuel source. Free fatty acids,

455/1624

unfortunately, come with a toxic end
product called ketones. This is why:
• No insulin ensures no glucose uptake.
• Cells eat fatty acids and make ketones.
• Ketones create acid.

Ketones are acid end products of lipid
metabolism.

CASE 4: Hypothyroidism
Setting: office
CC: “I just feel so weak and tired.”
VS: R: 10 breaths/minute; BP: 135/94
mm Hg; P: 56 beats/minute; T: 96.8°F

456/1624

HPI: A 48-year-old woman with progressively worsening fatigue and tiredness developing over the last several
months comes to your office. She says
she, “has gotten to the point where
everything is a struggle.” She has also
been gaining weight and suffering from
constipation.
PMHX:

Skin: course, thick hair
Initial Orders:
CBC
CHEM-7
Thyroid function tests (TFTs): free
thyroxine (T4), thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH)
Calcium, magnesium levels

In office-based cases, advance the clock
to the time and day when the test results
all list “Report Available.”

458/1624

Advance the clock 1 week to have the
patient revisit.
Laboratory Test Results:
CBC: hematocrit 34%; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 90 fL
CHEM-7: normal except sodium 132
mEq/L
Free T4: low
TSH: high
Calcium, magnesium levels: normal
Low T4 + High TSH =
Hypothyroidism

Normocytic anemia is part of
hypothyroidism.

459/1624

T4 is anabolic. Without it, things do not
grow—like red blood cells.

Low T4 causes low sodium level.
Low T4 impairs free water clearance.

The patient is certainly very happy to
know she has a clear medical reason
for her tiredness and possibly her
depression.

The patient asks why she feels
cold all the time, and why her
temperature is low?
a. Pituitary insufficiency

460/1624

b. Concomitant adrenal insufficiency
c. Because T4 directly stimulates heat production in cells
d. From the hyponatremia and anemia
Answer c. T4 directly stimulates heat production in cells
The metabolic rate of all mature cells in the
body is under the direct control of thyroid
hormone except for the adult brain, the
spleen, and the uterus. We are 98.6°F even
when the ambient temperature is lower than
that because the rate of Na+/K+-ATPase in
almost all bodily tissues is under the control
of thyroid hormone. T4 controls the “thermostat” for the body. The patient’s inability to
generate a faster rate of metabolism lowers
her temperature and makes her feel colder.

461/1624

Low T4: Bowels slow = Constipation
High T4: Bowels fast = Frequent bowel
movements

Coarse, thick hair and dry skin are a
routine finding in hypothyroidism.

Which of the following acts as a
steroid hormone?
a. T4
b. TSH
c. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)
d. Reverse triiodothyronine (T3)
Answer a. T4

462/1624

T4 is produced from the amino acid tyrosine,
but it has a steroid hormone mechanism of
action. Steroid hormones have a receptor in
the cytosol or the nucleus and work by creating new mRNA and new proteins. They are
not stored in vesicles and they have protein
carriers. T4 follows all these pathways in its
mechanism of action. Reverse T3 is metabolically inactive, so it has no steroid effect.
TSH and TRH are peptide hormones.

Peptide Hormones
• No protein carrier
• Short half-life
• Cell surface receptor
• Work through G-proteins and second
messengers

463/1624

Steroid hormones do not use G-proteins.

Orders:

464/1624

What is the mechanism of
bradycardia in hypothyroidism?
a. T4 is needed for myocardial contractility.
b. T3 speeds conduction at the atrioventricular (AV) node.
c. T4 has a permissive effect on
catecholamines.
d. Hypothyroidism causes involution or loss
of sinoatrial (SA) node tissue.
Answer c. T4 has a permissive effect on
catecholamines.
The root cause of bradycardia in hypothyroidism is the combined effect on catecholamines with T4. Without T4, there is a
decreased effect of both norepinephrine and
epinephrine at both the SA and AV node. In
addition, hypothyroidism leads to a decreased metabolic requirement of almost all
the cells in the body. Low T4 and low T3

465/1624

levels mean the muscles use less oxygen and
need less perfusion (Figure 3-4).

Figure 3-4. The hypothalamic−pituitary−thyroid axis.

thyrotropin G-protein-coupled receptor. (Goldsmith LA, et
al. Fitzpatrick’s Dermatology in General Medicine, 8th ed.
[online] New York: McGraw-Hill; 2012.)

Hypothyroidism causes bradycardia because of loss of catecholamine stimulation
on the heart as well as decreased demand
from a “slower” running body. This is the
same reason people gain weight with
hypothyroidism.

T4 is converted to T3 in tissues.

T3 is much more active than T4.

467/1624

Why is T3 more active than T4?
a. T3 is more protein bound.
b. T3 leaves plasma and enters the cell much
more easily.
c. T4 has a shorter half-life.
d. Reverse T3 directly inhibits T4 tissue
effect.
e. Reverse T3 is converted to T4.
Answer b. T3 leaves plasma and enters the
cell much more easily.
T4 is converted to T3 by 5-iodinase at the
level of the tissues peripherally to increase
the metabolic activity of those tissues. T3 is
less protein bound and therefore can enter
the cell and be more active. This also gives T3
a shorter half-life. T4 is more protein bound
and is therefore less active.
More Protein Binding = Less Activity

468/1624

The patient returns in 1 week to report
on the effect of thyroid hormone replacement and discuss laboratory test
results:
CHEM-7: glucose 145 mg/dL
LDL and triglycerides: elevated

What explains these laboratory
test results abnormalities?
a. Glucagonoma is often present with
hypothyroidism.
b. Hypothyroid states require less fuel.
c. Hypothyroidism provokes diabetes.
d. The patient has thyroid hepatopathy.
Answer b. Hypothyroid states require less
fuel.

469/1624

If thyroid hormone controls so much of the
metabolic activity of the body, it is logical
that a slower body needs less fuel. If Na+/K+ATPase is not sufficiently stimulated and the
patient’s bowels, muscles, and heart do not
do as much work, then the fuels, such as
glucose and fats, build up. This is why hypothyroidism is associated with weight gain.
The patient has been taking levothyroxine for 1 week and reports a slight increase in
energy and a brighter mood. There is no
change in weight, skin, or BP. You schedule a
1-month follow-up appointment because
changes with thyroid hormones are very
slow. T4 needs time to take effect and
changes in the levothyroxine dose should not
be done more frequently than every 6 to 8
weeks.

470/1624

Rapid increases in thyroid
hormone dosing is dangerous in
which of these?
a. Diabetes
b. Coronary disease
c. Stroke
d. Renal insufficiency
Answer b. Coronary disease
Thyroid hormone controls metabolic rate.
Rapid increases in thyroid hormone increase
metabolic activity and myocardial demand.
Hyperthyroidism can provoke myocardial
ischemia by increasing total body oxygen
consumption rates.

471/1624

Go slowly when increasing thyroid hormone replacement in patients with
coronary disease.

Low thyroid hormone levels cause polysaccharides to accumulate in vessel
walls, making them stiff. Stiff vessels
cause hypertension.

The patient returns 6 weeks later feeling much improved. She feels more energetic and her constipation has resolved. Her weight has decreased by 6
lb (2.7 kg); her pulse rate is 65 beats/
minute; her BP is 134/78 mm Hg; and
her temperature is 97.4°F.

472/1624

Orders:
T4 and TSH
Long-term hypothyroidism management is easy. If T4 is low and TSH is
high, continue to increase the levothyroxine dose every 6 to 8 weeks. All
symptoms will resolve.

CASE 5: Hyperparathyroidism
Setting: ED
CC: confusion, lethargy, and
constipation
VS: R: 12 breaths/minute; BP: 145/94
mm Hg; P: 86 beats/minute; T: 97.8°F
HPI: A 34-year-old man is brought to
the ED by his family because of

473/1624

lethargy. He lives alone and was not answering the phone for several days. His
father has to have the lock broken to get
into the house. He was found on the
floor disoriented and awake only
enough to say he is constipated and has
abdominal pain.
PMHX: none
Medications: none
“Altered mental status of unclear etiology”: These orders should be written
even before doing the physical examination because the physical examination
moves the clock forward. Legal drugs
(e.g., opiates) kill far more people than illegal drugs, so immediately give the patient naloxone as an opiate antagonist.
Give naloxone (it is always safe in patients with acute altered mental
status).

474/1624

Give thiamine.
Start dextrose.
Order calcium, sodium, glucose, magnesium levels; oximeter; computed
tomography (CT) of the head; urine
toxicology screen.

Acute opiate withdrawal will not kill the
patient!

PE:
Neurological: lethargic, unable to
follow commands
Cardiovascular: normal
Abdominal: decreased bowel sounds

475/1624

Extremities: decreased skin turgor

Do not give flumazenil! Benzodiazepine
withdrawal causes seizures.

Initial Orders:
Naloxone, thiamine, dextrose IV stat
NS bolus, then continuous
CHEM-7
CBC, UA, head CT scan
LFTs
Urine toxicology screen

476/1624

Sodium alters brain neural transmission; potassium does not.

Both renal and liver failure cause
encephalopathy.
Order BUN, creatinine, and transaminases levels.

With acute confusion, move the clock
forward only 5 to 10 minutes. On CCS,
although everything you order is considered to be done instantly, you cannot
see the effect of it unless you move the
clock forward. For example, if you order
naloxone, it is given instantly, but you
cannot determine on CCS that it is

477/1624

effective unless you move the clock and
do an “Interval History” or occasionally
get a spontaneous nurse’s note telling
you an update on the status.

You move the clock forward 5
minutes. There is no effect from either
the glucose or the naloxone. The bolus
of NS is given because the patient is
extremely dehydrated. You move the
clock forward another 15 minutes to
get the results of the serum chemistry,
CT, and UA.

One of the great magical things about
the Step 3 examination on CCS is that

478/1624

the patient can be in multiple places at
the same time. The blood tests, CT, and
urine sample will all be listed as obtained at the exactly same time.

Laboratory Test Results:
Total calcium: 16 mg/dL (normal
9−10.5 mg/dL)
BUN: 70 g/dL (normal 7−20 g/dL)
Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL (normal
0.7−1.2 mg/dL)
Bicarbonate: 21mEq/L
CBC, transaminases, head CT, and
urine toxicology: normal

479/1624

What is the mechanism of altered
mental status in this patient?
a. Dehydration
b. Hypokalemia
c. Sepsis
d. Metabolic acidosis
Answer a. Dehydration
Severe hypercalcemia is routinely associated
with massive volume depletion. This is why
the BUN-to-creatinine ratio is so high. Potassium does not alter CNS neural activity.
Potassium will alter cardiac conduction, but
not neural conduction. Although there is a
slight metabolic acidosis, it does not cause
altered mental status.

480/1624

Acidosis can be caused by renal insufficiency or parathyroid hormone (PTH)
inhibiting bicarbonate absorption at the
proximal tubule.

Reorder a fluid bolus and run IV fluids
continuously. The most important
management of severe hypercalcemia
is restoring fluid balance. NS by itself
increases calcium excretion from the
kidney.
Do NOT give furosemide before giving liters of fluid!

481/1624

Never use thiazides in hypercalcemia:
Thiazides increase calcium levels.

What is the mechanism of
thiazides in increasing calcium
levels?
a. They increase calcium reabsorption at the
distal tubule.
b. They decrease calcium filtration at the
glomerulus.
c. They increase PTH effect at the bone.
d. They block phosphate metabolism.
Answer a. They increase calcium reabsorption at the distal tubule.
Calcium is reabsorbed at the distal tubule.
Phosphate is usually absorbed at the proximal tubule.

482/1624

As soon as you confirm the presence of
hypercalcemia, you should hydrate the
patient and give bisphosphonates, as
well as look for the cause.
Orders:
PTH level
Phosphate level
Pamidronate
Re-bolus NS
You move the clock forward 1 hour.
Move this patient with acute, unresolving mental status changes to the
ICU and give him more fluids. Bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate
or zoledronic acid, will take 1 to 3
days to work, so any effect you see on
improvement of the calcium level in
the first few hours is entirely due to

483/1624

NS increasing the excretion of calcium
at the kidney.

What is the mechanism of massive
volume depletion in
hypercalcemia?
a. Blockage of ADH production in the
hypothalamus
b. Blockage of ADH release from the posterior pituitary gland
c. Blockage of ADH effect on the collecting
duct in the kidney
d. Constriction of the afferent arteriole
Answer c. Blockage of ADH effect on the
collecting duct in the kidney
ADH stimulation of the kidney needs normal
calcium
and
potassium
levels.

484/1624

Hypercalcemia causes nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus (NDI).

Hypokalemia and hypercalcemia cause
nephrogenic NDI.

After 2 hours, the patient wakes up
somewhat but is still lethargic. He
complains of abdominal pain.
Laboratory Test Results:
Calcium: 14.7 mg/dL
Phosphate: 1.5 mg/dL (normal
2.4−4.1 mg/dL)
PTH: elevated

485/1624

Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclasts in
the bone.

What is the mechanism of high
calcium causing lethargy and
constipation?
a. Inhibition of acetylcholine reuptake at the
neuromuscular junction
b. Somatostatin release
c. Raising the threshold for depolarization of
neural tissue
d. Blockade of β-receptors
Answer c. Raising the threshold for depolarization of neural tissue
High calcium levels inhibit neural hyperexcitability. High calcium levels move the
threshold for depolarization higher and

486/1624

farther away from the resting membrane
potential.
High Calcium Level = Short QT on ECG
Low Calcium Level = Prolonged QT on
ECG
Because of the continued high calcium
level and the persistence of symptoms
despite hours of hydration, you give
calcitonin. Calcitonin works much
faster than bisphosphonates, but will
wear off.

Calcitonin rapidly inhibits osteoclast
activity.

487/1624

After giving calcitonin, move the clock
forward 2 to 4 hours. Continue to give
NS in large volumes. You will only
give furosemide if the person is not
producing urine. This is entirely possible because hypercalcemia can create severe prerenal azotemia. It can
also be associated with CHF.

Loop diuretics increase calcium excretion at the loop of Henle.

By the second hospital day, massive
volume replacement of 4 to 8 L should
have improved the patient’s mental
status. His abdominal pain has

488/1624

improved and he is able to have a
bowel movement. Hyperparathyroidism is confirmed again.
Orders:
Consult endocrinology.
Move the patient to a hospital ward.
Continue hydration and
bisphosphonates.
Order a nuclear sestamibi parathyroid scan.
Repeat calcium, BUN, creatinine,
and phosphate levels.

A nuclear sestamibi scan is to localize
which of the four parathyroid glands has
to be removed.

489/1624

Hyperparathyroidism—85% occurs from
a solitary adenoma.
Remove it!

PTH:
• Reabsorbs calcium from bone
• Reabsorbs calcium at the distal tubule
• Increases activation of vitamin D
• Blocks phosphate absorption at the
proximal tubule

When asymptomatic, you do not need to
remove the parathyroid gland unless:
• There is bone disease (osteoporosis).
• There are kidney stones.
• There is decreased renal function.

490/1624

• Calcium levels are more than 1 point
above normal when the patient is
younger than 50 years old.

Your case may go as far as rechecking
the calcium and phosphate levels after
removal of the adenoma. Most cases of
hyperparathyroidism present as
asymptomatic elevation in the calcium
level. This case was to help you understand the key basic science foundations
of severe hypercalcemia.

CASE 6: Hypercortisolism
Setting: office
CC: “My face is getting fat and hairy.”

HPI: A 27-year-old woman comes to
your office concerned that her face is
getting “fatter and rounder” despite the
fact that she exercises and restricts her
diet. She has an increasing acne problem. She was referred to you by her dermatologist who she was seeing for the
acne and thinning hair on her scalp.

c. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
head
d. High-dose dexamethasone suppression
e. Random serum cortisol
Answer a. A 24-hour urine cortisol
Cortisol levels have tremendous fluctuation
during the day. Randomly testing for blood
or urine cortisol is useless and always the
wrong answer. Every time you get anxious or
get a parking ticket, your cortisol level goes
up. The 24-hour urine cortisol test tells the
average cortisol level over the past day.
The “1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test” is too nonspecific. If the

494/1624

morning cortisol level remains elevated, it
can be from anxiety, depression, or alcoholism. A normal test result excludes
hypercortisolism.

Never start with a head MRI in endocrine disorders.

Initial Orders:
Comprehensive metabolic panel
(CHEM-20)
Lipid panel
UA
24-hour urine cortisol collection

495/1624

Which of the following is the only
hormone made continuously?
a. Cortisol
b. Testosterone
c. T4
d. Growth hormone (GH)
e. ACTH
Answer c. T4
All hormones are made in pulsatile fashion
except for T4 and T3, which are made continuously. They are all subject to feedback inhibition—after production, they go back and
shut off their own stimulatory hormone.
Cortisol does feedback inhibition on the
pituitary and hypothalamus to shut off
ACTH and corticotropin-releasing hormone
(CRH).

496/1624

Cortisol is glucuronidated or “sugar
coated” to come off the binding protein
and be excreted in the urine.

Move the clock forward 1 to 2 weeks
to have the result of the 24-hour urine
test.
CHEM-20: potassium borderline
low; bicarbonate elevated; glucose
185 mg/dL
Lipid panel: LDL and triglycerides
elevated
UA: normal
24-hour urine cortisol collection:
elevated

497/1624

What is the mechanism of low
potassium and high bicarbonate?
a. Volume depletion
b. Mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol
c. 11-Deoxycorticosterone elevation
d. ACTH effect on kidney
Answer b. Mineralocorticoid effects of
cortisol
Adrenal hormones are not purely of one
single effect. Cortisol has some mineralocorticoid or aldosterone-like effect. That is also
why the potassium level is low. Aldosterone
levels are likely low in hypercortisolism. This
is because cortisol raises BP.
1. High BP shuts off renin.
2. No Renin = No ANGII
3. No ANGIII + Low Potassium = No Aldosterone Synthesis

498/1624

Mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) effect
• Potassium (K+) excretion
• Hydrogen (H+) excretion
• Sodium reabsorption

The patient is relieved to know that
she has a diagnosis that can explain
her facial fatness and truncal obesity.

The patient wants to know if the
acne and hirsutism are also
related to this same problem.
What do you tell her?
a. Yes, she is secreting more testosterone.
b. Yes, adrenal androgen excess accompanies Cushing syndrome.

499/1624

c. Yes, cortisol suppresses estrogen
production.
d. No, unfortunately you must find a second
tumor.
Answer b. Yes, adrenal androgen excess accompanies Cushing syndrome (Figure 3-5).
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione are cosecreted with hypercortisolism. In addition, there is some
androgen-like effect of cortisol. Acne, male
pattern hair loss, and excess hair on the face
in women is part of hypercortisolism. This is
the same reason this patient is infertile. Excess androgens are interfering with her ovulatory cycles.

501/1624

Excess androgen levels cause acne. Sebaceous glands have testosterone
receptors.

The patient is delighted that she can
get “one stop shopping” to fix her fat
face, obese trunk, acne, and restore
her periods and fertility. She wants to
know where the lesion is.

What test do you order next?
a. ACTH level
b. MRI of head
c. CT of adrenals
Answer a. ACTH level

502/1624

If the ACTH level is high, then the source is
the pituitary or an ectopic focus, such as the
lungs. If the ACTH level is low, then the
source is the adrenal glands.

High Cortisol = High Lipids
Cortisol causes lipolysis.

The patient returns in 1 week. Always
follow BP in any person who was hypertensive. Her BP is 148/94 mm Hg.
The laboratory test results show:
ACTH: elevated
Glucose: 176 mg/dL

503/1624

What is the mechanism of
hypertension?
a. Cortisol increases the number of α-receptors in the vasculature.
b. Hyperglycemia increases osmotic pressure in vessels.
c. Increasing norepinephrine accompanies
hypercortisolism.
Answer a. Cortisol increases the number of
α-receptors in the vasculature.
There is an increased effect of catecholamines, not an increased level. Cortisol has a
permissive effect on catecholamines in the
vasculature. This is by the direct effect of alpha-1-receptors on vasoconstriction. Glucocorticoids increase the number of alpha-1-receptors as well as potentiating the effect on
norepinephrine and epinephrine at currently
existing receptors. This is why a bolus of
steroids in sepsis has such an immediate

504/1624

effect in raising BP. There is a slower
aldosterone-like effect at the kidney, increasing sodium reabsorption.

Hypercortisolism causes striae and easy
bruising.

Skin is made of collagen protein.
Cortisol breaks down proteins to use the
amino acids for gluconeogenesis.

After you have established the presence of hypercortisolism with a
24-hour urine cortisol collection, use
the ACTH level to determine the

505/1624

location. When the ACTH level is
proven elevated, then do a high-dose
dexamethasone suppression test to
distinguish between a pituitary source
and an ectopic source.
Order:
High-dose dexamethasone suppression test

Response to high-dose dexamethasone:
• The pituitary gland will suppress the
ACTH level.
• Ectopic foci will not suppress the
ACTH level.

506/1624

The patient has suppression of the
ACTH level. You now order an MRI of
the head to find a lesion. All of this
testing is so that you will remove the
correct part of the body. Because 10%
of the population has an abnormal
pituitary on MRI, you must never
start with a scan. You might end up
removing the pituitary inappropriately if the source is really elsewhere.

Cortisol causes osteoporosis by directly
breaking down bone.

Cortisol increases osteoclast activity.

507/1624

The MRI shows a lesion in the pituitary. You consult a neurosurgeon for
removal.

What is the most likely histology?
a. Hyperplasia
b. Adenoma
c. Neoplasia
Answer b. Adenoma
Most functional pituitary tumors are adenomas. They retain the ability to be suppressed by feedback inhibition but only with
high-dose dexamethasone administration.

508/1624

Bone matrix is protein and is broken
down to amino acids for
gluconeogenesis.

Which of the following is the
greatest or major mechanism of
how cortisol increases serum
glucose level?
a. Increasing gluconeogenesis
b. Decreasing glucose excretion at kidney
c. Having a permissive action on glucagon
d. Blocking uptake into tissues like muscle
and adipose
Answer d. Blocking uptake into tissues like
muscle and adipose
Although cortisol does increase gluconeogenesis and breaks down glycogen by

509/1624

permissive action on glucagon, the major
mechanism is blocking uptake into peripheral tissues.
Move the clock forward to follow up
after removal of the pituitary lesion.
Make sure you replace thyroid hormone
and sex hormones in addition to giving
prednisone or hydrocortisone. Recheck
the patient’s chemistry looking for a
normal glucose, potassium, sodium,
and bicarbonate levels.

CASE 7: Acromegaly
Setting: office
CC: “I’m sleepy all day long, and my
wife says I snore.”

510/1624

VS: R: 12 breaths/minute; BP: 158/98
mm Hg; PR: 78 beats/minute; T: 97.8°F
HPI: A 48-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes comes to the office
because he has daytime somnolence and
his wife complains that he snores. He is
also here for routine management of
diabetes and hypertension.
ROS:
Shoe, hat, and ring size started increasing over the last 1 to 2 years
Body odor

HEENT: large nose, lips, and jaw;
teeth widely spaced
Cardiovascular: 3/6 pansystolic murmur radiating to axilla
Initial Orders:
HbA1c
CHEM-7
Lipid panel

What is the best initial test?
a. Insulinlike growth factor (IGF)
b. GH
c. MRI head
d. Glucose suppression test

512/1624

Answer a. Insulinlike growth factor (IGF)
IGF has a longer half-life than GH. Because
GH has a shorter half-life, elevated levels are
harder to detect. Never start with a scan of
the head in endocrinology. Do the MRI of the
brain only after the disorder has been biochemically confirmed.

IGF is protein bound, giving it a long
half-life.

When is GH release maximal?
a. On waking
b. 30 minutes before waking
c. Middle of the night
d. Before sleep
Answer c. Middle of the night

513/1624

Deep sleep is the stimulant for the normal
diurnal variation in GH level. Cortisol level
increases 30 minutes before waking.

Move the clock forward 1 week.
Laboratory Test Results:
HbA1c: 7.2%
CHEM-7: glucose 145 mg/dL; BUN
and creatinine: normal
Lipid panel: elevated LDL and
triglycerides
IGF: markedly elevated

Acromegaly grows sweat glands!

514/1624

Growth Hormone Mechanisms
• Acts as antiinsulin
• Raises serum glucose
• Raises free fatty acid level

Acromegaly causes hypertension.

You increase the dose of metformin
and discuss possibly adding a second
oral hypoglycemic agent to get the
HbA1c concentration under 7%. You
inform the patient that both his diabetes and hypertension may be from
acromegaly, but you need to confirm
the etiology.
Orders:

515/1624

Glucose suppression test

IGF causes obstructive sleep apnea by
growing neck tissues.

Erectile Dysfunction Etiology
• Diabetes
• Hypertension
• Vascular disease
• Associated with sleep apnea

IGF and GH fail to suppress with glucose loading. This is a failure of the
normal feedback inhibition

516/1624

mechanism. You order an MRI and
ask the patient to return to discuss the
results. The patient comes back the
following week and you inform him
that the scan does show a pituitary lesion, and transsphenoidal surgery is
needed to remove it. You also tell him
that his diabetes may resolve when
you remove the lesion.

If GH is an antiinsulin that raises
glucose and free fatty acid levels,
why does it produce another
hormone call insulinlike growth
factor? What is insulinlike about
it?
a. Effect on hormone sensitive lipase
b. Effect on protein synthesis

517/1624

c. Effect on lipids
Answer b. Effect on protein synthesis
GH is an antiinsulin in terms of its glucose
and lipid effect. GH stimulates production of
IGF at the liver and skeletal muscle. IGF is
insulinlike, not GH. IGF increases protein
synthesis, amino acid uptake into cells, and
DNA synthesis.

Both IGF and insulin use a tyrosine
kinase receptor.

The patient is frightened by the idea of
“brain surgery” and does not come
back to see you for a year. Order an
“Interval History.” His erectile disfunction, body odor, and sleep apnea

518/1624

have all worsened. In addition, his
numbness and tingling in the first
three fingers of both hands have
worsened by use. He has become immobile because of knee pain.
Physical Examination:
Facial features coarsened
Knees enlarged and abnormally
shaped
New 3/6 pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla

Uncontrolled IGF leads to misshapen
joints and arthropathy.

519/1624

IGF expand proteins abnormally.

Orders:
Glucose, HbA1c, lipids
Repeat MRI of head
Echocardiogram

What is the mechanism of the
carpal tunnel syndrome?
a. Abnormal protein growth in the canal
b. Sodium alteration
c. Potassium alteration
Answer a. Abnormal protein growth in the
canal

520/1624

Acromegaly results in a protein expansion in
the canal that the median nerve travels
through. This compresses the nerve. Carpal
tunnel syndrome is the most common neuropathy in acromegaly.
One week later the patient returns. He
is becoming short of breath with exertion. His test results show that his
glucose level is 195 mg/dL; his HbA1c
concentration is 8.4%; his MRI shows
an enlarging pituitary lesion; and his
echocardiogram shows moderate
mitral regurgitation with an ejection
fraction of 32%.

Mechanism of Cardiomyopathy
• IGF causes abnormal cardiac shape.

521/1624

• Hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia cause coronary disease.

What cancer should you test the
patient for?
a. Colon
b. Lung
c. Prostate
d. Gastric
Answer a. Colon
IGF leads to excess colonic polyp formation.
This increases the risk of colon cancer.

522/1624

Which of the following will most
likely resolve after removing the
pituitary gland?
a. Hyperlipidemia
b. Carpal tunnel
c. Cardiomyopathy
d. Joint abnormality
Answer a. Hyperlipidemia
Because the high lipid level results from the
antiinsulin effect of GH, it will likely resolve
after the GH is decreased. The other problems are from a permanent growth of protein
and will not “resorb” after the GH and IGF
levels drop. You have to remove the pituitary
gland before these problems advance.

523/1624

The most common cause of death from
acromegaly is cardiomyopathy from
coronary disease.

A month later you are seeing the patient at a follow-up appointment after
the removal of his pituitary gland. He
has been started on thyroid hormone
replacement and prednisone.

Additional therapies to lower GH and
IGF levels:
• Pegvisomant
• Octreotide (somatostatin)
• Cabergoline

524/1624

Pegvisomant is a direct GH receptor
antagonist.

Move the clock forward another 2 to 4
weeks. Recheck glucose and HbA1c
levels because the patient may have a
decreased need for diabetes medication. Treat the mitral regurgitation
with ACE inhibitors as you would for
any person with mitral regurgitation.

CASE 8: Hyperaldosteronism
Setting: ambulatory care center
CC: “My legs feel like lead.”

525/1624

VS: BP: 168/98 mm Hg; P: 72 beats/

HPI: A 43-year-old man comes to clinic
because his “arm and legs feel like they
weigh 100 pounds each.” There is a progressive slowness for muscle weakness.
It is equal in all four extremities, started
6 months ago, and is slowly progressive
and uncomfortable.
ROS:
No visual problems; no diplopia
No respiratory problems

Initial Orders:

527/1624

CHEM-7, CBC
ECG
UA
Calcium, magnesium, phosphorus
Thyroid function (T4, TSH)
Generalized weakness is hard to evaluate. It has to be distinguished from
the fatigue or tiredness of anemia
versus decreased motor strength from
thyroid, calcium, potassium, or magnesium abnormalities. This patient
has actual muscle weakness, not fatigue and shortness of breath after exertion. Because it is generalized and
continuous, it is hard to say that it is
myasthenia.

• Myasthenia: worse at end of day

528/1624

• Guillain-Barré: acute, several days, ascends from legs upwards
• Botulism: acute, descends from face
• Tick paralysis: diffuse, overwhelming,
sudden
• Hypokalemia: diffuse, can be chronic if
undetected; rare with K >2.5 mEq/L

Move the clock forward to get the blood
chemistry results immediately. The patient should be brought back no later
than the following day.
CHEM-7: sodium normal; K: 2.4
mEq/L
ECG: S wave deep in leads V1 and V2;

Hypertrophy (LVH)

The most urgent step is to replace the
potassium. The route of administration is dependent on the setting of
your case. The setting or location of

530/1624

treatment is an essential feature of the
Step 3 examination. Because this is an
ambulatory care patient who has been
living like this for months, you do not
need to hospitalize the patient. Use oral potassium replacement for outpatients. If the patient is hospitalized,
you should never discharge a patient
with an abnormal potassium
level—either high or low.

What is the mechanism of the
patient’s muscle weakness?
a. The resting membrane potential is excessively low.
b. The Na+/K+-ATPase pump is inactive.
c. The ungated potassium channel is closed.

531/1624

d. The voltage gate potassium channels stay
open.
Answer a. The resting membrane potential
is excessively low.
Resting membrane potential is based on potassium levels. The threshold for depolarization is about –45 mV. When you move the
resting membrane potential down from –70
to –80 or to –90 mV you are moving further
away from threshold. There is no effect on
Na+/K+-ATPase. The ungated channels have
more potassium leaving the cell.

Potassium Replacement Rates
• Oral: No maximum rate of
replacement
• IV: <10 to 20 mEq/h

532/1624

Muscles cannot contract if they cannot
depolarize.

You order potassium tablets and instruct the patient to take them with a
lot of water. Ask the patient to return
the following day to recheck the potassium level. It is completely possible
to replace the potassium over 1 to 2
days.
The Interval History shows that
the patient reports much greater mobility and strength and his potassium
level is now 3.1 mEq/L.

533/1624

Low serum potassium (K) pulls potassium ions (K+) out of cells. Hitting the
threshold for depolarization is harder
when cells have low K+.

Further potassium replacement continues over the next 2 to 3 days. Bring
the patient back frequently to recheck
his levels. You should also see a resolution of U waves on the ECG.

Both high and low potassium levels
cause arrhythmia.

534/1624

Low K levels decrease conduction
through the His-Purkinje system.

By the following week, the potassium
level has normalized. All muscle weakness has resolved. The polyuria has
resolved as well.

Hypokalemia causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

ADH does not work effectively with low
K or high calcium (Ca) levels.

535/1624

The patient’s repeat blood pressure
level is 168/100 mm Hg.

What is the mechanism of
hypertension?
a. ANGII constricting arterioles
b. Excess ADH acting as vasopressin
c. Aldosterone increasing sodium absorption
at late distal or early collecting duct
d. Smooth muscle hyperplasia of arteries
e. Catecholamine excess
f. Renin excess
Answer c. Aldosterone increasing sodium
absorption at late distal or early collecting
duct
High BP with low serum potassium level is
most likely hyperaldosteronism. Although all

536/1624

the features listed cause hypertension, none
of them is particular to this case. The main
feature of basic science correlates for the
Step 3 examination is not just to know
something is happening, but to know precisely why it is happening. Aldosterone
works by increasing sodium reabsorption at
the cortical portion of the collecting duct.
That is the early part of it, where it meets the
distal convoluted tubule (DCT).
Hypertension + Hypokalemia =
Hyperaldosteronism

What is the difference between
ADH and vasopressin?
a. Production site
b. Storage site
c. Chemical structure
d. Amount and target organ

537/1624

Answer d. Amount and target organ
ADH is made in the hypothalamus at the
paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. It is
not made in the posterior pituitary. ADH is
transported down the pituitary stalk to the
posterior pituitary where it is stored. ADH
works at the kidneys on the V2 receptor of
the collecting duct. ADH inserts aquaporin
to increase permeability to water so it can be
reabsorbed. Vasopressin is the same substance, but stimulates the V1 receptor in the
vasculature to cause vasoconstriction.

ADH absorbs water.
Vasopressin constricts vessels.

A 1% osmolarity change increases ADH.

538/1624

A 10% volume change increases ADH.

High ADH levels constrict vessels at
high levels and we call it vasopressin.

The patient has persistent hypertension. Because potassium is normal,
muscle weakness has resolved, but
you need to investigate the diagnosis
of primary hyperaldosteronism or
Conn syndrome.
Orders:
Plasma aldosterone
Plasma renin
CHEM-7

539/1624

Which of the following is
consistent with primary
hyperaldosteronism?

Answer b. Aldosterone high and renin low
When aldosterone is being produced
autonomously, the ratio of aldosterone to
renin is 20:1. Any cause of dehydration or
renal artery stenosis can raise both the renin
and aldosterone levels.

540/1624

The patient returns in 1 week.
Report:
Aldosterone level high, renin level
low (ratio 25:1)
Serum bicarbonate level elevated

Metabolic alkalosis is from aldosterone
increasing hydrogen ion (H+) excretion.

What is the precise location and
mechanism of H+ loss?
a. Proximal tubule
b. Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)
c. α-Intercalated cells
d. Aquaporin

541/1624

Answer c. α-Intercalated cells
In the late distal tubule and early collecting
duct, there are two cells on which aldosterone has its primary effect (Figure 3-6). The
alpha-intercalated cells reabsorb sodium and
excrete an H+. The ENaC reabsorbs sodium
and excretes potassium. ENaC is the precise
site
of
potassium
loss
from
hyperaldosteronism.

542/1624

Figure 3-6. Mechanism of aldosterone action. Aldosterone
enters principal cells and interacts with cytosolic aldosterone receptors. The aldosterone-bound receptors interact
with nuclear DNA to promote gene expression. The
aldosterone-induced gene products activate sodium channels and sodium pumps to increase sodium reabsorption.
Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, are also capable of binding
to the aldosterone receptor. However, they are inactivated
by 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD). ATP, adenosine triphosphate; K, potassium; Na, sodium. (Reproduced

What is the most common cause
of primary hyperaldosteronism?
a. Unilateral adenoma
b. Bilateral adenoma
c. Unilateral hyperplasia

543/1624

d. Bilateral hyperplasia
e. Cancer or neoplasia
Answer a. Unilateral adenoma
Unilateral adenoma accounts for 60% to
80% of cases. Only 3% is unilateral hyperplasia. Most of the rest is bilateral hyperplasia. Only 1% to 2% is cancer or neoplasia.

Normal Stimulants to Renin
• Low sodium level
• Beta-1-stimulation
• Low pressure at juxtaglomerular
complex

544/1624

Which test should be done next to
confirm the presence of primary
hyperaldosteronism?
a. Salt load, then aldosterone level
b. Salt load, then renin level
c. CT of adrenal glands
d. MRI of adrenal glands
e. Exploratory laparotomy
Answer a. Salt load, then aldosterone level
This is a functional test of the adrenal
glands. Always do functional tests before
scans in endocrinology. If you take out the
adrenal glands inappropriately, you cannot
put them back in.
• Normal: Salt loading in the diet suppresses aldosterone level.
• Abnormal: Salt loading does not suppress
aldosterone level.

545/1624

The failure of the normal feedback inhibition is a disease. High salt levels in a person
with high BP should suppress renin and
aldosterone.

The zona glomerulosa makes
aldosterone.

The following week the patient’s salt
loading test shows a persistent high
aldosterone level despite 5000 mEq/
day in the diet. The adrenal CT shows
a bilateral hyperplasia.

What is the treatment?
a. Open surgical removal

546/1624

b. Laparoscopic removal
c. Spironolactone
d. Prednisone
e. Removal of pituitary gland
Answer c. Spironolactone
Adenomas and cancer are removed by laparoscopic surgery. Bilateral hyperplasia is
treated with the aldosterone receptor antagonist spironolactone. Removing the pituitary
gland will do nothing because the pituitary
exerts no control on aldosterone production.
Aldosterone is controlled by renin.

Direct Stimulants to Aldosterone
Synthesis
• Angiotensin II
• Hyperkalemia

547/1624

There is no edema with hyperaldosteronism because of “sodium escape” at the
kidney.

After 1 week on spironolactone, the
patient’s BP has lowered to 134/84
mm Hg. He feels less tired.

What do you have to monitor for?
a. Low sodium
b. High sodium
c. High potassium
d. Metabolic alkalosis
Answer c. High potassium

548/1624

Because spironolactone is an aldosterone receptor antagonist, some people develop high
potassium levels. Spironolactone blocks the
ENaC and the intercalated cells.
Two months later the patient comes
because of pain in his chest. The discomfort is bilateral. There is enlargement of breast tissue consistent with
gynecomastia.

What is the mechanism?
a. Spironolactone inhibits androgens.
b. Prolactin levels have increased.
c. Estrogen release has increased.
d. Progesterone level has increased.
Answer
a.
androgens.

Spironolactone

inhibits

549/1624

Spironolactone inhibits androgens. This
causes enlargement of breast tissue or
gynecomastia. In polycystic ovary syndrome,
spironolactone treats hirsutism and helps restore menstruation.
Spironolactone is stopped and eplerenone is started. Eplerenone is an alternate mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that does not inhibit androgen receptors. Move the clock forward 1
month at a time until the CCS program
ends the case. Monitor the patient’s
CHEM-7 looking for potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate abnormalities.

CASE 9: Prolactinoma

level is normal. Bring the patient back
in a few days to discuss the results of the
prolactin level. Of all the endocrinopathies, prolactin is unique in that so
many medications and mechanical
problems like nipple stimulation can
cause hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea (Figure 3-7).

c. SSRIs
d. Cimetidine
e. Verapamil
f. Opiates
Answer c. SSRIs
SSRIs are just not clearly associated with increased prolactin levels.

554/1624

• Dopamine inhibits prolactin release.
• Antipsychotics decrease dopamine
levels.

The patient returns and her prolactin
level is elevated.

Which of the following
endocrinopathies is associated
with high prolactin level?
a. Estrogen deficiency
b. Addison disease
c. Cushing syndrome or hypercortisolism
d. Hypothyroidism
e. GH deficiency

555/1624

Answer d. Hypothyroidism
It is reasonable to exclude hypothyroidism in
any person with hyperprolactinemia. Increased estrogen directly stimulates the pituitary to release prolactin. This is the mechanism in pregnancy of how breast glands normally grow. The placenta makes estrogen.
Estrogen makes prolactin. Prolactin makes
the breast glands grow.

What is the mechanism of high
prolactin level in hypothyroidism?
a. T4 normally suppresses prolactin release.
b. TRH level is increased.
c. Hypothyroidism decreases dopamine
release.
d. TSH stimulates prolactin.
Answer b. TRH level is increased.

556/1624

TRH stimulates prolactin release. This is
usually only at pathologically increased
levels of TRH such as found in hypothyroidism. Low T4 level removes feedback inhibition on TRH. Very high TRH level stimulates
prolactin.

Opiate substance abusers have erectile
dysfunction.

Opiates increase prolactin level.

Because of the high prolactin level and
the absence of identifiable causes of
hyperprolactinemia, you send the patient for an MRI of the head.

557/1624

What functional biological test is
there of prolactin?
a. Metoclopramide stimulation test
b. Dopamine suppression test
c. Estrogen stimulation test
d. Naloxone stimulation test
e. None
Answer e. None
High Prolactin + Exclude Correctable Causes = Brain MRI
An MRI is done. The patient returns
for the results and is told she has a
5-mm lesion in the pituitary gland.

558/1624

What is the next best step?
a. Refer to neurosurgery
b. Radiation treatment
c. Octreotide
d. Cabergoline
e. Pergolide
Answer d. Cabergoline
Cabergoline is an oral dopamine receptor
antagonist that causes less nausea and
vomiting than bromocriptine. This is clearly
the first line of therapy for all microadenoma. Surgery is done if the lesion is
larger than 3 cm or the dopamine agonist
has failed. Radiation is a third or fourth attempt at treatment. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue. There is no significant efficacy with a somatostatin analogue. Prolactinomas are managed exactly opposite to

559/1624

acromegaly. Surgery is the first-line treatment in acromegaly.

Cabergoline is an ergot derivative.

Transsphenoidal surgery is performed.
Prednisone, T4, and sex hormones replacement therapy is started. Follow
up with the patient until the program
ends the case.

CHAPTER 4

562/1624

NEUROLOGY
CASE 1: Stroke
Setting: emergency department (ED)
CC: “My arm is weak.”
VS: BP: 188/115 mm Hg; P: 90 beats/
minute; T: 100.1°F; R: 14 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 58-year-old man with half an
hour of right arm and leg weakness was
sent to the ED in an ambulance by his
family. His family noticed the arm and
leg weakness immediately because it
happened while at dinner when it looked
like he got up and tripped. On lifting him
up, they found the whole right side of his

563/1624

body weak and his speech had become
garbled.
PMHX:
Hypertension
Tobacco smoking
Medications:
Nifedipine
Lisinopril
PE:
Neurological: clear weakness on right
side 2/5 power, right facial droop
Cardiovascular: normal
Abdominal: normal

Grading of Power on Neurological
Examination
0/5: Flaccid, completely paralyzed.

564/1624

1/5: Muscle twitch, no movement.
2/5: If examiner lifts extremity, patient can move it side to side.
3/5: Patient can hold up extremity
against gravity only. No load bearing.
4/5: Weak.
5/5: Normal.

What is the most urgent step?
a. Control blood pressure (BP).
b. Order computed tomography (CT) of
head.
c. Give aspirin.
d. Give thrombolytics.
Answer a. Control blood pressure (BP).
All of these are important in a stroke, but the
point of this question is that you cannot give

565/1624

any form of anticoagulation without first excluding hemorrhage. You must not send
someone off to a CT without giving the first
dose of antihypertensive medication.

Initial Orders:
Labetalol intravenously (IV)
Head CT without contrast
Complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT),
electrocardiogram (ECG)
Neurology or stroke team evaluation

CT with contrast is used to look for cancer or infection.

566/1624

Blood does not need contrast to be
visible.

You move the clock forward 5 minutes.
It is expected that the stroke team
evaluation will occur within 5 minutes
after the initial physician evaluation.
More than any other disease, stroke
evaluation is on a precise expectation
of time frame. The head CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expected to occur within 15 minutes of the
initial physician evaluation with a
reading by an expert in 20 minutes.

567/1624

Why is stroke more sensitive to
time than any other tissue or
organ damage?
a. Brain tissue has no glycogen stores.
b. Carbon dioxide accumulation is more
damaging to central nervous system (CNS)
tissue.
c. Acid (hydrogen ion [H+]) accumulation is
more damaging to CNS tissue.
d. Ketones cannot supply energy to cerebral
tissue.
Answer a. Brain tissue has no glycogen
stores.
Your brain wants 100% glucose. Because
there is no glycogen storage in the brain, it
needs all its food to be brought in continuously by blood flow. This is perhaps the
single most important “basic science fundamental” to know for a stroke: The brain has
no glycogen stores. Brain tissue uses glucose

568/1624

as a fuel almost exclusively. Ketones can be
used, but it takes time for them to be produced and for the brain to switch the biochemistry to be able to consume them. Carbon dioxide and acid dilate cerebral vasculature to increase flow to hypoxic brain tissue, but they are not damaging.

Cerebral tissue lives mostly on glucose.

Move the clock forward 5 minutes and
recheck the patient’s BP. Acute BP control with labetalol, nitroprusside, enalaprilat, or nimodipine will start to
have an effect instantly if the drug is
working. You cannot give thrombolytics if the BP is >180/110 mm Hg, so

569/1624

controlling BP is indispensable to
proper management.

You must practice the computer-based
case simulation (CCS) cases before entering the examination.

Orders:
Vital signs (under the “Physical Examination” tab on top)
Two to five minutes later, the repeat
BP level is 180/112 mm Hg.
Give another dose of IV labetalol.
The most important thing to remember
about using acute BP-lowering medications on CCS is that the route of

570/1624

administration be IV. The specific agent
is not as important. However, you cannot order medications by class on CCS;
you must write orders by name of medication. You cannot order “BP drug” or
“beta-blocker.” You have to order
“labetalol.”

The onset of action for IV labetalol is 2
to 5 minutes.

Two to five minutes later, the repeat
BP level is 170/104 mm Hg.

571/1624

What is the mechanism of action
of labetalol?
a. Beta-1, central alpha-1
b. Beta-1, peripheral alpha-1
c. Beta-1 and 2, peripheral alpha-1
d. Beta-1 and 2, central alpha-2
Answer c. Beta-1 and 2, peripheral alpha-1
Labetalol and carvedilol are the two combined
alpha/beta-blockers.
They
are
nonspecific beta-blockers and also block
peripheral alpha-1-receptors. Peripheral alpha-1-receptors are the mechanism of how
norepinephrine raises BP. Alpha-1-constriction is a rapid and powerful way to alter BP.

Do not lower BP more than 25% on first
day.

572/1624

Move the clock forward 10 to 15
minutes until the CT report is available. Because hemorrhages cause
15% of strokes, you have to exclude
bleeding before any anticoagulation
medications can be given.
Head CT: no blood, no masses
Repeat BP 158/98 mm Hg
ECG: left ventricular hypertrophy,
unchanged from previous ECG
CBC, PT/aPTT: normal

What should you do next?
a. Lower BP further.
b. Give aspirin.
c. Give thrombolytics.
d. Give clopidogrel.
e. Give heparin.

573/1624

Answer c. Give thrombolytics.
Thrombolytics are the standard of care for
acute nonhemorrhagic stroke within the first
3 to 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms.
Most clinicians would use it up to 4.5 hours
after onset, but the Step 3 examination will
avoid all potential controversy and will make
it either clearly less than 3 hours or more
than 4.5 hours from the time of onset.

Repeat the neurological examination
to confirm the findings.

Which of the following is most
likely to be found?
a. Unilateral blindness
b. Bitemporal hemianopsia
c. Homonymous hemianopsia
d. None

574/1624

Answer c. Homonymous hemianopsia
When you have a patient with a stroke causing loss of motor strength on one half of the
body, you should expect the visual field to be
lost on the same side. Half of each eye’s visual field will be lost.

Right side weakness: right visual field
loss

When are the other choices correct?
• Aspirin: Use if presenting after 4.5
hours.
• Clopidogrel: If the patient is already on
aspirin, switch from aspirin after 4.5
hours.
• Heparin: Never give for stroke.

575/1624

• Dipyridamole: If the patient is already
on aspirin at the time of a stroke, add
to aspirin.

Never combine aspirin with clopidogrel
for stroke!

Combining aspirin with dipyridamole is
good.
Combining aspirin with clopidogrel is
bad.

Thrombolytics are given. Move the
patient to the hospital ward. The intensive care unit (ICU) is not needed.

576/1624

On CCS, there is no way to physically
move the patient to a place called
“stroke unit.” The stroke unit is not
one of the five places you have to
choose from on CCS locations.
• All of the previous orders will follow
the patient in any location.
• Vital signs are done on CCS with
each move.
• Unless you see it on your screen under “Orders,” it is not being done.

CBC, PT, and aPTT prior to
thrombolytics:
• Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
are contraindications.

577/1624

Which best describes the
mechanism of thrombolytics?
a. Prevents fibrinogen activation
b. Cleaves fibrin into D-dimers
c. Removes fibrin split product from fibrin
d. Increases action of plasmin on factor XIII
Answer b. Cleaves fibrin into D-dimers
Thrombolytics activate plasminogen into
plasmin. Plasmin cleaves newly produced
fibrin strands into their breakdown product,
which is D-dimers. Fibrin split products
(FSPs) are liberated from fibrinogen to activate it into fibrin. Thrombin is what cleaves
off the FSPs. Factor XIII is a clot-stabilizing
factor that solidifies a clot.

The patient has been moved to the hospital ward after the use of

578/1624

thrombolytics. His repeat BP is 156/96
mm Hg. There is a slight improvement
in his right-sided weakness during the
repeat neurological examination.

You will never get in trouble on the CCS
by reviewing charts or examining patients too often!

Once thrombolytics are given and the
follow-up neurological examination is
done, you should explore reasons for
the emboli going to the brain.
Orders:
Echocardiogram
Telemetry

579/1624

Carotid artery duplex Doppler
ultrasound

Where is the source site of the clot
or stroke in this patient?
a. Anterior cerebral
b. Middle cerebral
c. Posterior cerebral
Answer b. Middle cerebral
Upper and lower extremity hemiparesis, facial droop, and expressive aphasia are classic
for middle cerebral artery stroke.
Anterior Cerebral Stroke:
• Cognitive and psychiatric deficit
• Lower extremity weakness > upper extremity weakness
• Urine incontinence

580/1624

Posterior Circulation (Vertebral or
Basilar):
• Loss of consciousness
• Dysarthria, diplopia, dysphagia, dizziness
• Bilateral defects

Do not order carotid artery Doppler ultrasound for posterior circulation
defects!

Carotid arteries do not anatomically
supply the vertebral or basilar artery.

As you move the clock forward to get
the results remember to order:

581/1624

Physical therapy and rehabilitation
evaluations
Restart aspirin 24 hours after
thrombolytics
If the patient was on aspirin, switch to
clopidogrel or add dipyridamole
Echocardiograms, telemetry, and carotid artery Doppler ultrasounds are
often unrevealing in a stroke. If there is
>70% stenosis on the affected side, refer
the patient to vascular surgery for
endarterectomy. We do not know what
to do about asymptomatic carotid
artery stenosis.

CASE 2: Parkinson Disease
Setting: office
CC: “My walking is getting really slow.”

582/1624

HPI: A 74-year-old man with progressive inability to walk over the past year
comes to your office. He also has a hard
time getting up from a seated position
and he becomes lightheaded when he
tries.
PMHX: ostearthritis
Medications: acetaminophen
PE:
General: immobile, seems very “grimfaced”
Neurological:
Tremor at rest at 3 cycles/second, cogwheeling present
Slow gait; significant retropulsion. He
cannot easily turn.
Initial Orders:
MRI of head

583/1624

CHEM-20
The patient’s diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) is obvious on examination.
There is no test to specifically diagnose
PD. An MRI of the head can be used to
see if there are previous strokes that led
to the PD. All of your Step 3 examination
questions on PD will concern drug therapy, and the basic science fundamental
questions will be on the mechanisms of
these treatments.

Which should be tested for on
examination?
a. Hyperreflexia
b. Orthostatic hypotension
c. Spasticity of muscles
d. Decreased papillary reflexes

584/1624

Answer b. Orthostatic hypotension
Patients with PD frequently have orthostatic
hypotension. This is why they cannot easily
get up from a seated position. When rising,
the autonomic nervous system is slow to respond. The normal increase in pulse rate and
vasoconstriction is not occurring. When a
normal person stands, the baroreceptors in
the carotid sinus and atria sense the decrease
in pressure or stretch. Because these are
mechanoreceptors, firing is decreased. The
medulla does not perceive the change in posture and there is no output to the sinoatrial
(SA) node to increase firing or to the arterioles to contract. Hence, BP is abnormally low
when standing and patients can experience
syncope. This is like “cogwheel rigidity” of
the autonomic nervous system.

585/1624

Response to Standing
• Normal: vasoconstriction and
tachycardia
• PD: inappropriately low pulse rate

In PD, phase 4 depolarization of the SA
node stays abnormally flat.

The patient has orthostasis on examination as well as decreased facial
movements (hypomimia). The main
thing that bothers him is slow gait and
general immobility. He is not as
bothered by the tremor because it
stops when he reaches for something.
Orders:

586/1624

Anticholinergic agent (benztropine,
trihexyphenidyl)

The mechanism by which anticholinergics improve PD is unknown.

Why does decreasing acetylcholine increase dopamine?
We do not know!

Instead of the previously scheduled
2-week follow-up appointment, the
patient is brought back in 4 days by
his wife. He has abdominal pain, dry
mouth, and urine retention.

587/1624

Which of the following should you
also ask about or examine for?
a. Bradycardia
b. Memory difficulty
c. Diarrhea
d. Constricted pupils
Answer b. Memory difficulty
Acetylcholine helps with memory formation.
Inhibition of acetylcholine (ACh) will provoke dementia. This is why anticholinergic
medication like benztropine is hard to use in
those older than 65 to 70 years old. It worsens Alzheimer disease. This is why we use
drugs like donepezil, rivastigmine, and
galantamine for Alzheimer disease. They increase ACh and improve memory. In addition, inhibiting ACh should cause tachycardia, constipation, and dilate pupils.

588/1624

More ACh = More Memories
Less ACh = Less Memories

Anticholinergics worsen glaucoma.
Dilated Pupils = Blocked Canal of
Schlemm

You stop the benztropine and start
amantadine. When you see the patient
again in 2 weeks, there is no significant improvement.

What is the next step to try?
a. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor (tolcapone, entacapone)
b. Ropinirole or pramipexole

589/1624

c. Bromocriptine
d. Selegiline
Answer b. Ropinirole or pramipexole
These medications are direct-acting dopamine receptor agonists. They have less efficacy
than levodopa/carbidopa, but they have less
adverse effects as well. The standard of care
in most PD is to try a dopamine receptor agonist at the beginning of treatment.
Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist but
is a derivative of ergot, and thereby has more
adverse effects, such as nausea and vomiting.
In choosing treatment, if two medications
have the same efficacy, use the one with less
adverse effects.
Selegiline is a monamine oxidase (MAO)
inhibitor. This class of drugs decreases the
metabolism of dopamine, but the efficacy is
unclear.

590/1624

Amantadine efficacy is limited.

Amantadine may increase dopamine release from the substantia nigra.

You start ropinirole and see the patient again in 2 weeks. He has modest
improvement in mobility and orthostasis. Over the next year, he is
stable then begins to deteriorate
again. You now add levodopa/
carbidopa, and he markedly improves.

What is the mechanism of
carbidopa?
a. Direct dopamine agonist

591/1624

b. Inhibition of dopamine decarboxylase
c. Decreased urinary excretion of dopamine
d. Synergistic with dopamine at substantia
nigra
Answer b.
decarboxylase

Inhibition

of

dopamine

Levodopa normally has a very short half-life.
It, therefore, will decompose and not allow
transfer across the blood brain barrier into
the brain. Carbidopa is a peripheral dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor. This allows a
greater level to enter the brain.

You see the patient at 2-week intervals
and increase the dose of levodopa/
carbidopa. Perform a neurological examination and check for orthostasis at
each visit. The patient is not fully controlled after 2 months.

592/1624

What should you do?
a. Nothing more can be done.
b. Add tolcapone or entacapone.
c. Order deep brain stimulation.
Answer b. Add tolcapone or entacapone.
Tolcapone and entacapone are COMT inhibitors. They block the metabolism of dopamine in the brain. They enhance activity of
dopamine at the substantia nigra. They have
definite efficacy but are exclusively an addon therapy to levodopa/carbidopa. They will
not work by themselves.
After a few days on the new medications, the good news is, the patient has
much better mobility. The bad news is,
he has started to develop visual hallucinations and sees “bugs coming out of
the walls.”

593/1624

What is the mechanism of the
hallucinations?
a. It is the direct toxicity of the COMT
inhibitor.
b. The patient has decreased serotonin
levels.
c. Dopamine increases psychosis.
d. Decreased ACh increases psychosis.
Answer c. Dopamine increases psychosis.
The difficulty of medicating patients with PD
is that the massive increase in dopamine can
cause psychosis in some patients. The dose
needed to control PD may mean that the
only way to get the PD controlled is to give
enough dopamine even though it may lead to
the adverse effect of psychosis. The treatment is quetiapine, which is an antipsychotic
medication with the lowest amount of parkinsonian adverse effects.

594/1624

Anti-Parkinson disease (PD) medications cause psychosis.
Antipsychosis medications cause PD.
Anti-PD medications cause dementia.
Anti-dementia medications cause PD.

CASE 3: Myasthenia Gravis
Setting: office
CC: “I feel so weak at the end of the
day.”
VS: BP: 112/72 mm Hg; P: 90 beats/
minute; T: 99.8°F (37.7°C); R: 18
breaths/minute
HPI: A 54-year-old woman comes to the
office with increasing muscle weakness
and tiredness over the past few months.

595/1624

She feels “totally spent” at the end of the
day and her “arms and legs feel like
lead.” She feels so tired that she has a
hard time finishing meals.
ROS:
Double vision
No fever, no headache, no weight loss
PMHX: none
Medications: none
PE:
General appearance: tired, but fully
alert
Neurological: decreased muscle
strength in all four extremities
equally; normal deep tendon reflexes
(DTRs); normal pupillary response
Head, ears, eyes, nose, throat
(HEENT): bilateral ptosis

596/1624

Initial Orders:
Anti-ACh receptor antibodies
Anti-muscle specific kinase (MuSK)
antibodies
Chest x-ray

Edrophonium (Tensilon) test is neither
as sensitive or specific as antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is not a disease you start to treat empirically unless the patient experienced an acute,
overwhelming presentation of weakness threatening breathing. MG is
generally a disease that progresses
over months.

597/1624

Report:
Anti-ACh receptor (AChR) antibodies
positive
Anti-MuSK antibodies present
Chest x-ray: normal
Anti-AChR antibodies are positive in
90% of those with MG. If patients
present with MG limited to the eyes
with diplopia, the sensitivity falls to
50%. Anti-MuSK antibodies are generally used in patients whose anti-AChR
antibodies are negative.

Anti-MuSK is for those with false negative AChR antibodies.

598/1624

What is usually the most common
presentation of MG?
a. Proximal muscle weakness
b. Diaphragm and respiratory muscle
weakness
c. Difficulty chewing and diplopia
d. Upper extremity and hip girdle weakness
e. Four-limb paralysis
Answer c. Difficulty chewing and diplopia
MG usually presents with diplopia and decreased ability to chew because they are the
only two muscles used regularly. Because
MG is a decremental decrease in strength on
repetitive use, the patient must be using the
muscles in order for it to be noticed.

599/1624

What is the difference between
pyridostigmine, neostigmine, and
edrophonium?
a. Dosing and duration of effect
b. Mechanism of action
c. Adverse effects
d. Site of action
Answer a. Dosing and duration of effect
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are all essentially identical except for how long they last
and therefore how frequently they are dosed.
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors all block the
metabolism or breakdown of ACh at the
neuromuscular junction. This increases the
level and the clinical effect.

ACh receptors on muscle are nicotinic.

600/1624

ACh receptors in the lung, bladder,
bowel, saliva, and eye are muscarinic.

The patient is started on pyridostigmine. Move the clock forward 2 days.
Do an “Interval History” to confirm
the effectiveness of the medication. The
patient reports a moderate improvement with pyridostigmine. You decide
to confirm the diagnosis with additional testing before just increasing
the dose.

What is the most accurate test for
MG?
a. Biopsy
b. Single-fiber electromyography (EMG)

601/1624

c. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and
aldolase
d. ACh level
Answer b. Single-fiber electromyography
(EMG)
EMG involves the placement of a needle into
the muscle, and repetitive stimulation is sent
through it. In MG, there is a clear decrease in
muscle strength and frequency of contraction in response to nerve stimulation. More
electrical jolts produce fewer muscular
contractions.

Single-fiber EMG confirms the diagnosis as MG. You increase the dose of
pyridostigmine. Do a chest CT as soon
as the diagnosis of MG is confirmed.
This is to exclude thymic hyperplasia

602/1624

and thymoma associated with MG. If
it is found, it will need to be removed.

In children, the thymus gland
“programs” T lymphocytes for action.

The thymus gland has little residual
function in adults and can be removed
without major adverse effect.

Move the clock forward and see the
patient every month. Perform a neurological examination at each visit to assess the effectiveness of your medications. The patient is lost to follow-up

603/1624

for a few months and runs out of medications. When she returns, the patient
has an overwhelming weakness and
respiratory distress.

What is the treatment that will
have the fastest effect for this
acute myasthenic crisis?
a. Start intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
b. Give steroids.
c. Remove the thymus gland.
d. Give anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs
(e.g., etanercept).
e. Give cyclosporine.
Answer a. Start intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
Acute myasthenic crisis is treated with IVIG
or plasmapheresis. IVIG is much easier to

604/1624

use. Plasmapheresis has the same difficulty
as setting up dialysis. The presumed mechanism of IVIG is that the Fc portions of the
immunoglobulins will “stuff up” or fully saturate the Fc receptors on the macrophage.
The macrophage then can no longer remove
ACh receptors at the neuromuscular junction
(Figure 4-1). Anti-tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) medications have no benefit in MG.
Steroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and
cyclophosphamide take weeks or months to
work.

605/1624

Figure 4-1. Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis.
Acetylcholine released at the nerve ending by the nerve impulse normally binds with acetylcholine receptors. This
evokes the action potential in the muscle. In myasthenia
gravis, antiacetylcholine receptor antibody binds to the
acetylcholine receptor and inhibits the action of acetylcholine. Bound antibody evokes immune-mediated destruction of the endplate. (Reproduced with permission
from Chandrasoma P, Taylor CE. Concise Pathology, 3rd
ed., New York: McGraw-Hill; 1998.)

606/1624

MG will impair the patient’s ability to
inhale.

Acute myasthenic crisis = IVIG or
plasmapheresis

Plasmapheresis removes antibody that
attacks ACh receptors.

IVIG blocks macrophages that attack
ACh receptors.

IVIG and pyridostigmine are started.
The patient is moved to the ICU. After

607/1624

24 hours, she starts to improve. After
2 days, she is breathing normally and
able to walk. Move the patient to the
ward and advance the clock. After another day, send the patient home.

Never send the patient home directly
from ICU.

After the patient is discharged, she
does well for a few months, and then
the disease starts to progress. See the
patient on CCS at 1-month intervals
and do an “Interval History” and
neurological examination each time.
The patient’s symptoms worsen on
maximal pyridostigmine.

608/1624

What is the next step?
a. Give IVIG.
b. Perform a thymectomy.
c. Add neostigmine.
Answer b. Perform a thymectomy.
The thymus gland programs the T cells that
attack the neuromuscular ACh receptor. Removing the thymus gland in MG is like removing the spleen in a person with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Thymectomy markedly improves neuromuscular
function in the majority of patients. It will
not have much effect in those who are older
than 60 to 70 years of age in whom T-cell
function is already set and thymus removal
will alter little.

609/1624

You cannot move to a place called
“Operating Room.”

Order the procedure you need. CCS will
tell you if a consultation is required.

The patient undergoes thymectomy.
Over the next few weeks symptoms
have mild improvement, but the patient cannot function normally. There
is additional drug therapy to consider
in patients with MG:
Cyclosporine
Azathioprine
Tacrolimus or sirolimus

610/1624

What is the mechanism of these
medications?
a. Neutrophil inhibition
b. Interleukin-1
c. Leukotriene inhibition
d. Decrease of T-cell activation
e. Prostaglandin activation
Answer d. Decrease of T-cell activation
Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor. Azathioprine, its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine
(6MP), and tacrolimus all inhibit activation
of T cells. The major defect in MG is
abnormal T-cell activation directed against
the ACh receptor. Sometimes glucocorticoids
can be used in the short term for control of
MG over a few weeks. These other medications are then used to get the patient off
steroids.

611/1624

Make sure you exclude thymic hyperplasia and thymoma in MG.

MG is always progressive on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. They do not
interrupt the disease process.

Order each of the immunosuppressive
drugs and advance the clock 1 month. It
takes 2 to 3 months to see a maximal
effect of these medications. They are
slow in action. It is impossible to be
sure which one will work in advance.

612/1624

Check the renal function of patients on
cyclosporine.

CASE 4: Subarachnoid
Hemorrhage
Setting: ED
CC: “My head hurt real bad, then I
passed out.”
VS: BP: 154/94 mm Hg; P: 110 beats/
minute; T: 100.8°F; R: 18 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 34-year-old woman with no significant past medical history is brought
by ambulance to the ED after passing
out in the nave of Le Parker Meridien
hotel. She was sitting at lunch with her

613/1624

mother and suddenly developed an excruciating headache. She woke up a few
minutes later while being loaded into
the ambulance.
Medications: none
PE:
General: uncomfortable, shielding her
eyes
HEENT: photophobia and neck stiffness present
Neurological: no focal deficits

Why is this not meningitis?
• Sudden in onset
• Loss of consciousness
Initial Orders:
• Head CT

614/1624

What is “special” about the CT to
order?
a. Use contrast.
b. Order thin cuts through the base of the
brain.
c. Wait 24 to 48 hours for greater sensitivity.
Answer b. Order thin cuts through the base
of the brain.
Because blood is heavier than cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), you should do thin cuts through
the base of the brain to detect small bleeds.
The blood will have settled to the base of the
brain by gravity. Contrast is used to detect
abscess and neoplasia. Waiting markedly decreases the sensitivity of the CT for blood.

615/1624

Any adult admission to hospital should
have:
• CBC
• Basic metabolic panel (CHEM-7)
• ECG
• Chest x-ray
• Urinalysis (UA)
You will not lose points by ordering
these tests on CCS and you may “trip”
over the diagnosis by accident.

The maximum sensitivity of a CT is
within the first 12 hours after the bleed.

Advance the clock just enough to get
the results of the CT scan. You cannot

616/1624

initiate therapy until you know if there
is blood.
Report:
Head CT: subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH) diffusely surrounding brain
(Figure 4-2)

617/1624

hemorrhage. Notice the hemorrhage pattern fills the
cerebrospinal fluid spaces at the base of the brain and
around the brainstem. (Reproduced with permission from
Doherty GM. Current Diagnosis & Treatment: Surgery,
13th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2010.)

618/1624

If the CT were negative, what test
would have been next?
a. Lumbar puncture (LP)
b. MRI
c. Digital subtraction angiogram
Answer a. Lumbar puncture (LP)
The sensitivity of CT in SAH is 92% to 95%
on the first day and approaches 100% in the
first 6 to 12 hours. MRI is not as useful to detect blood. The key points on LP in SAH are:
• There is a high opening pressure.
• There is no change in cell count from tube 1
to tube 4.
• Xanthochromia starts in 2 hours.
• Spectrophotometry detects bilirubin 12
hours after a bleed.

619/1624

The patient’s BP is 146/92 mm Hg. She
is awake and uncomfortable, shading
her eyes.

What should you do about the
patient’s elevated BP?
a. No therapy is indicated.
b. Give IV fluids and phenylephrine to raise
it further.
c. Give labetalol to lower it further.
Answer a. No therapy is indicated.
Modest hypertension probably helps cerebral perfusion in SAH. It is clear that attempting to decrease BP to a low pressure, for example, <120/80 mm Hg, in this patient is
likely dangerous. This would represent a
>25% drop from the original BP of 154/94
mm Hg and might impair cerebral perfusion.

620/1624

There is no clear benefit to using fluids and
phenylephrine or dopamine to raise BP
more.

What is the mechanism of loss of
consciousness in SAH?
a. Increased intracranial pressure suddenly
decreases CNS perfusion.
b. Vasospasm.
c. Potassium alteration.
Answer a. Increased intracranial pressure
suddenly decreases CNS perfusion.
Bleeding into the brain increases the intracranial pressure and decreases the ability of
blood to get into the brain. This is why hypotension is so dangerous after an SAH. Therapeutic hypertension with fluids and pressors
(phenylephrine or dopamine) is not clearly
beneficial. Vasospasm occurs after SAH in
response to the bleeding. Vasospasm is not

621/1624

the cause of the loss of consciousness. It is a
reaction to it.
Move the patient to the ICU.
Consult neurosurgery.
Repeat vital signs every 2 hours, especially watching for extremes of
BP.

Which is the best method to find
the location of the bleed?
a. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA)
b. MRI
c. Repeat CT
Answer a. Digital subtraction angiography
(DSA)
DSA is the best method to determine the location of the aneurysm. You need to find the

622/1624

site of the lesion and repair it as soon as possible. Do not delay the DSA. The greatest
chance of rebleeding is on the first day of the
bleed. Half of people who rebleed will die.

Get a move on! Get the DSA.

What is the most common cause
of SAH?
a. Sudden hypertension
b. Spontaneous rupture of a saccular aneurysm of the circle of Willis
c. Trauma
d. Vasculitis
Answer b. Spontaneous rupture of a saccular aneurysm of the circle of Willis

623/1624

As much as 2% to 5% of the population has
saccular aneurysm of the circle of Willis at
autopsy. Almost all remain unruptured at the
time of death. It is not clear why some rupture and others do not. Although cigarette
use and hypertension are associated with
rupture, this is not a direct temporal relationship such as “I was fine until I smoked
that cigarette.”

The DSA shows the location of the aneurysm to be the anterior communicating artery. The patient’s BP is 142/
90 mm Hg.

What is the best way to fix it?
a. Craniotomy and open repair
b. Endovascular coiling and embolization
with platinum wire

624/1624

c. Laparoscopy
d. Nimodipine
Answer b. Endovascular coiling and embolization with platinum wire
Endovascular coiling clots off the site of the
bleed and does not require craniotomy. Laparoscopy is for the pelvis and abdomen.
Nimodipine is used to prevent subsequent
stroke but does not fix the site of the
aneurysm.

Platinum wire
• Does not oxidize
• Is biologically inert

Nimodipine

625/1624

• Is a calcium channel blocker
• Prevents vasospasm
• Decreases risk of “downstream” stroke
• Does not prevent rebleeding

Once the DSA shows the location of the
aneurysm, order the endovascular repair procedure with coiling and embolization. If this is a multiple choice
question and the stem says “Coiling is
not available at your hospital,” the answer is “Transfer to a hospital that
does coiling/embolization.” Do not alter the proper care of a patient around
the logistics at your hospital. Move
hospitals rather than do a procedure
that is not ideal.

626/1624

Get patients what they need.
Never do an inadequate procedure because it is not available at your
institution.

Alter logistics to get right care.
Do not alter right care around logistics.

The patient undergoes the platinum
wire coiling procedure and the site of
the aneurismal bleed is repaired.
Nimodipine is ordered and the patient’s BP is 134/88 mm Hg.
The following treatments are not
clearly beneficial and we do not recommend their routine use:
Hypothermia

627/1624

Antiepileptic drugs
Steroids
Statins

CASE 5: Guillain-Barré
Syndrome
Setting: ED
CC: “My legs are weak.”
VS: BP: 110/70 mm Hg; P: 110 beats/
minute; T: 97.8°F; R: 12 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 43-year-old man comes to the
ED with bilateral leg weakness, which
he has been experiencing for the past 2
days. For the first day it was minor and
did not interfere with function. On the

628/1624

day of admission, he has become unable
to walk. He is brought by ambulance.
PMHX: none
Medications: none
PE:
General: awake and alert
Neurological examination: bilateral
leg weakness, equally on both sides;
absence of ankle jerk and knee jerk
reflexes
Chest: clear
Cardiovascular: normal
HEENT: normal pupil reflexes; no
ptosis
Initial Orders:
Forced vital capacity (FVC)
Peak inspiratory capacity

629/1624

Oximeter

Which of the following will lead to
the patient’s death?
a. Sepsis
b. Respiratory failure
c. Seizure
d. Encephalitis
Answer b. Respiratory failure
When weakness ascends up to the diaphragm, it will potentially impair breathing.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is ascending
weakness with the loss of reflexes. MG is
weakness that is slowly progressive and distinctly worsens with repetitive use.

630/1624

There is a slight decrease in FVC and a
peak inspiratory pressure of −24 cm
H2O. There is no fever. Because there
is impairment of respiratory functioning, the person should be placed in the
ICU. You do not want the patient to
develop respiratory failure unobserved on a regular hospital ward.

Which of the following will stay
intact in this patient?
a. Elastic recoil
b. Ability to cough
c. Total lung capacity
d. Inspiratory reserve volume
Answer a. Elastic recoil
Elastic recoil is not based on muscular exertion. GBS only impairs muscular exertion. It

631/1624

has no effect on tissue characteristic, such as
elastic fibers or the flexibility of the chest
wall. Total lung capacity is decreased because it is based partly on the inspiratory reserve volume, which will be markedly reduced in this patient.

What is the most accurate
diagnostic test?
a. Nerve biopsy
b. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) testing
c. Serum anti-nerve immunoglobulin G
(IgG)
d. LP
e. Lumbosacral spine CT/MRI
Answer b. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV)
testing
A needle is placed at one end of the nerve
and an electrical impulse is administered. A

632/1624

positive test shows decreased F-wave transmission. There is no such test as a “serum
anti-nerve IgG.” Although LP is often done,
it is more useful for excluding other diseases
than it is to specifically show something
pathognomonic for GBS.

Orders:
Start IVIG.
Do LP.
Test NCV.
Move the patient to ICU.

Which of the following is most
likely found on LP in GBS?
a. Moderate elevation of lymphocytes
b. High protein with normal cell count
c. Low glucose and neutrophils
d. High protein and high lymphocyte count

633/1624

Answer b. High protein with normal cell
count
The LP is done to exclude CNS infection. You
should find a normal CSF cell count in GBS.
There is no specific finding on LP that confirms GBS.

IVIG should be ordered stat without
waiting for a laboratory confirmation
of the diagnosis. GBS can result in permanent neurological disability and
there is no reason to delay therapy although it does not work overnight.
CSF shows normal cell count and
elevated protein. NCV testing takes
more time to perform and receive
results.

634/1624

Ask anyone with GBS about the
following:
• Recent vaccinations
• Diarrheal episodes or gastrointestinal
(GI) tract infections

Campylobacter infection is the most
common identifiable event causing GBS.

IVIG = Plasma Exchange (Plasmapheresis) for Efficacy

What is the mechanism
underlying GBS?
a. Interleukin elevation
b. Antibodies attacking CNS white matter

635/1624

c. Antibodies attacking peripheral nerve
myelin
d. Infarction of vasonervorum
Answer c. Antibodies attacking peripheral
nerve myelin
In GBS, antibodies attack the myelin, stripping it off and damaging conduction.
Without myelin, NCV is slow. Campylobacter
provokes the production of these antibodies
for an unknown reason. The vasonervorum
is damaged in diabetes peripheral neuropathy and vasculitis. Multiple sclerosis damages CNS white matter.

“Molecular mimicry” means something
in myelin seems to “mimic” the cell surface of campylobacter.

636/1624

In the ICU, the patient is reported as
“looking fine” and the postgraduate
year 3 (PGY3) resident wants to transfer the patient out immediately. He
says “the saturation is normal.”

How would you best follow the
patient’s respiratory condition?
a. Serial arterial blood gas (ABG)
measurements
b. Peak inspiratory flow
c. Pulse oximetry
d. Forced expiratory volume at 1 second
(FEV1)
Answer b. Peak inspiratory flow
You want to know if the respiratory muscles
are weakening before the patient’s oxygen
saturation level drops. You cannot wait for

637/1624

the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2)
to rise before determining that the patient
needs intubation. It will be too late. The
same is true of oxygen saturation. The PCO2
and oxygen saturation do not change until
there is outright respiratory failure. Peak inspiratory pressure predicts who is about to
have respiratory failure before it occurs.

Do not wait for desaturation or respiratory acidosis!
Use peak inspiratory pressure to follow
GBS!

Thirty percent of patients with GBS need
intubation.

638/1624

GBS is a demyelinating disease decreasing muscle strength (Figure 4-3).
The diaphragm is a muscle.

peripheral nerves. (Reproduced with permission from
Longo DL, et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine,
18th ed., Vol. 2. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2012.)

Peak inspiratory pressure starts to improve as does the FEV1 on bedside spirometry. You transfer the patient out of
the ICU. Consult medical rehabilitation,
physical therapy, and the hospital social worker. The Step 3 examination is
also very big on asking “what will you
tell the patient?” in terms of prognosis.
Twenty percent of patients will not recover muscle strength and it will take
months for full recovery in the patients
who do recover.

Ineffective Therapy in GBS
• Glucocorticoids

641/1624

• Combining IVIG and plasmapheresis
• Cyclosporine
• IVIG blocks macrophages.
• Blocked macrophages cannot attack
myelin.

CASE 6: Dementia
Setting: office
CC: “My memory is getting bad.”
HPI: A 77-year-old former chairman of
medicine at your medical school comes
to see you for initial testing for memory
loss. He wants to get an initial evaluation by you privately before his wife
and children find out he may have serious memory loss.

642/1624

PMHX:
Localized prostate cancer surgically
resected 10 years ago
Sober alcoholic; last drink 2 years ago
Medications: none
PE:
General: charming older gentleman;
no abnormalities noted
Neurological: no focal deficits, able to
remember only two of three objects at
5 minutes. No cogwheel rigidity. No
myoclonus. No movement disorder.
Initial Orders:
Head MRI
Vitamin B12 and methylmalonic acid
level
Thyroid function tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], thyroxine [T4])

643/1624

Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) Venereal
Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)
test

Alzheimer disease: neurofibrillary
tangles, amyloid plaques

Vivid hallucinations with
exquisite detail are characteristic
of
a. Alzheimer disease
b. Lewy body dementia
c. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
d. Multiinfarct (vascular) dementia
Answer b. Lewy body dementia

644/1624

Lewy body dementia is characterized by parkinsonism and extremely vivid hallucinations with great detail. There is no specific
test and no treatment beyond the dopamine
agonists and dopamine replacement that you
would use for Parkinson disease.

The patient returns a week later to
discuss the laboratory test results. He
feels the same. He loves what he is doing, but just gets forgetful.
Reports:
Head MRI: normal
Vitamin B12 and methylmalonic acid
levels: normal
TSH and T4: normal
VDRL: normal

645/1624

Which of these is characterized by
rapid progression and
myoclonus?
a. Alzheimer disease
b. Frontotemporal dementia (Pick disease)
c. CJD
d. Multiinfarct (vascular) dementia
Answer c. CJD
CJD can take a person from normal function
to death in 3 to 6 months. There is no effective therapy for CJD. CSF shows the 14-3-3
protein, which spares the patient a need for
brain biopsy for definitive diagnosis.

CJD is associated with prions. They are
• Transmissible
• Cause spongiform encephalopathy

646/1624

• Do not grow or replicate in the
laboratory

You explain to the patient he might
have early Alzheimer-type dementia
or mild cognitive impairment. He
wants to start therapy. You order
donepezil.

Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine increase CNS ACh level.

647/1624

Which of these is characterized by
choreiform movement and
emotional lability?
a. Huntington disease
b. Frontotemporal dementia (Pick disease)
c. CJD
d. Normal pressure hydrocephalus
Answer a. Huntington disease (HD)
HD is characterized by
• Dementia at an early age
• Emotional lability
• Movement disorder or chorea

HD has CAG trinucleotide repeat genetic
sequences.

648/1624

HD Treatment
• Tetrabenazine
• Increases dopamine
• Improves movement disorder

Over the next 6 to 12 months, the patient’s memory loss continues to progress. You add memantine to his
donepezil. Get a neurology consultation, but do not expect them to tell you
anything.

Memantine Mechanism
• N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
• Neuroprotective

649/1624

Combine
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
(donepezil)
and
Memantine

The patient’s memory stabilizes over
the next 6 months.

CASE 7: Meningitis
Setting: ED
CC: “My head hurts.”
VS: BP: 145/92 mm Hg; P: 108 beats/
minute; T: 102.8°F; R: 23 breaths/
minute

650/1624

HPI: A 31-year-old man comes to the
ED with 1 day of severe fever, headache,
and neck stiffness. He is very uncomfortable and is lying on the stretcher
with a pillow over his face. He has been
nauseated and vomited several times.
PMHX: none
Medications: none

What should you do next?
a. Perform a physical examination.
b. Give ceftriaxone and vancomycin IV.
c. Give ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and dexamethasone IV.
d. Order a head CT.
e. Order blood cultures.
Answer e. Order blood cultures.

651/1624

If this is “real life,” order blood cultures, antibiotics, and the steroids even before you do
the physical. This is because the presentation
of a chief complaint with fever, headache,
stiff neck, and what seems to be photophobia
is so clear for meningitis that getting the antibiotics ready in the shortest period of time
is the most important thing you can do.
However, remember that on CCS, the instant
you order a test or a treatment, it is considered “administered” by the program. That
means you just want to get the blood cultures
to determine the specific organism involved
rather than having the antibiotics given before an LP.

The “instant” you order something on
CCS, it is considered “Administered.”
Ordered = Administered on CCS

652/1624

Timing is critical with meningitis! Move
fast!

PE:
General: very uncomfortable man.
Trying not to move.
Neurological: no focal deficits; cranial nerves intact
Musculoskeletal: neck inflexible
HEENT: photophobia present
Initial Orders:
LP

653/1624

What do you expect to see on CSF
if this is viral meningitis?
a. Protein extremely high, lymphocytes
elevated
b. Glucose low, neutrophils elevated
c. Protein mildly elevated, lymphocytes
elevated
d. Thousands of white cells with 90%
neutrophils
Answer c. Protein mildly elevated, lymphocytes elevated
You should know what you expect to see on
the test you order before it is done. Viral
meningitis has an elevated white blood cell
(WBC) count that is mostly lymphocytes.
The CSF protein can be normal or mildly elevated. Bacterial meningitis has a predominance of neutrophils.

654/1624

Head CT Before LP
• Focal neurological findings
• Papilledema
• Severe confusion (makes neurological
examination incomplete)

As soon as the LP is done, advance the
clock just a few minutes and order the
antibiotics. Your whole aim in meningitis should be to give the antibiotics
as soon after the LP as possible. You
do the head CT before an LP in some
patients because of the possibility that
the intracranial pressure is increased
unevenly in the skull. Focal findings
and papilledema indicate a possible
mass lesion and an LP may lead to
herniation. Meningitis increases

655/1624

intracranial pressure, but it is increased evenly throughout the brain
and that is why herniation does not
occur just from the elevated intracranial pressure of meningitis.
Orders:
Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and dexamethasone IV
Droplet isolation

What class of medication does
vancomycin belong to?
a. Glycopeptide
b. Penicillin
c. Aminoglycoside
d. Vancomycin
Answer a. Glycopeptide

656/1624

Glycopeptides are glycosylated cyclic nonribosomal peptides. The glycopeptides are
vancomycin, teicoplanin, and telavancin.

What is the mechanism of action
of vancomycin?
a. Ribosomal
b. Cell wall
c. Protein synthesis
d. DNA gyrase
Answer b. Cell wall
Vancomycin inhibits the backbone polymers
of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria.
Because gram-negative bacteria form
through a different mechanism, vancomycin
has no effect on gram-negative organisms.
Macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) inhibit ribosomes. Quinolones inhibit DNA gyrase,

657/1624

which is the enzyme needed to unwind DNA
so it can be replicated.

Vancomycin inhibits the cell wall
through a different mechanism than do
cephalosporins and penicillin.

Blood cultures were obtained and the
LP performed. Move the clock forward
to obtain results. Patients are placed
on droplet isolation until you are sure
the organism is not Neisseria
meningitidis.
Report:
CSF: 2400 WBCs; 87% neutrophils
Protein: 89 mg/dL (elevated)

658/1624

Gram Stain Characteristics of
Organisms
• Positive diplococci: Pneumococcus
• Negative diplococci: Neisseria
• Positive cocci in clusters:
Staphylococcus
• Pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli: Haemophilus
• Positive rod: Listeria

The Gram stain shows gram-positive
diplococci.

What would you do differently
based on this finding?
a. Stop ceftriaxone.
b. Stop vancomycin.

659/1624

c. Stop droplet isolation.
d. Add penicillin.
e. Stop dexamethasone.
Answer c. Stop droplet isolation.
Droplet isolation is only needed for Neisseria meningitidis. You should not alter the antibiotics until the results of culture and sensitivity are known. If the organism is fully
sensitive, a penicillin or cephalosporin is superior in efficacy to vancomycin. If the organism if penicillin resistant, vancomycin is
needed.
Dexamethasone must be continued because it decreases both neurological injury
from meningitis as well as mortality.

660/1624

For which organism do steroids
give the greatest mortality
benefit?
a. Pneumococcus
b. Neisseria
c. Staphylococcus
d. Haemophilus
e. Listeria
Answer a. Pneumococcus
The reason for the benefit being greatest
with pneumococcus is not clear. Steroids decrease inflammation in general.

Move the clock forward 6 to 12 hours
and reexamine the patient. You know
it is bacterial meningitis from the
thousands of neutrophils on CSF as
well as the Gram stain. Bacterial

661/1624

meningitis is profoundly damaging to
the brain and it is important to be sure
there is no neurological damage.
PE:
Neurological examination: nonfocal,
more comfortable
HEENT: photophobia and neck stiffness still present

What is the most common
neurological sequela from
meningitis?
a. Memory loss
b. Hearing loss
c. Respiratory distress
d. Visual disturbances
Answer b. Hearing loss

662/1624

The most common neurological effect of
meningitis is hearing loss. Patients on initial
presentation can have ocular problems such
as double vision. Untreated meningitis can
result in hydrocephalus. It is not clear why
there is more damage to the eighth cranial
nerve than the other parts of the system.

Which site of the brain is most
involved in this patient?
a. Parenchyma
b. Arachnoid
c. Dura
d. Ventricles
Answer b. Arachnoid
The part of the brain most affected by meningitis is the leptomeninges or immediate
covering of the brain. The arachnoid is under
the dura and this is the main part affected.

663/1624

Encephalitis infects the brain parenchyma.
None of these infections is in the ventricles.

Move the clock forward another 6 and
then 12 hours. Once the patient is
stable, you should look for a source of
the meningitis.
Order:
Head CT/MRI
Chest x-ray

Sources of Pneumococcal Meningitis
• Sinusitis
• Mastoiditis
• Pneumonia

664/1624

Why is intracranial pressure up in
meningitis?
• Vasogenic edema
• Cytotoxins from neutrophils
• Inflammation of arachnoid villi

What is the mechanism of
hydrocephalus developing as a
complication of meningitis?
a. Inflamed arachnoid villi cannot drain
CSF.
b. Granuloma forms.
c. Cells undergo coagulation necrosis.
d. Fibrinoid necrosis occurs.
Answer a. Inflamed arachnoid villi cannot
drain CSF.

665/1624

CSF normally drains out of arachnoid villi.
When they are inflamed by infection or
blocked by red blood cells, hydrocephalus
can develop. This is the mechanism of developing hydrocephalus from subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

On the second hospital day, you are
called by the nurse because the patient
has suddenly turned bright red. On examination his skin is red. Vancomycin
is infusing.

What is the mechanism of this
“red man syndrome?”
a. Allergy
b. Histamine release from mast cells
c. IgE
d. Neutrophil dysfunction

666/1624

Answer b. Histamine release from mast
cells
Vancomycin provokes a histamine release
from mast cells when infused rapidly. The
solution is to slow the rate of infusion.
On the following day, the CSF and
blood cultures are reported as growing
Streptococcus pneumonia that is sensitive to penicillin. A head CT shows no sinusitis and no mastoiditis.
Orders:
Stop vancomycin.
Continue ceftriaxone (or ampicillin).
Continue steroid.
Keep the patient in the hospital for at
least 10 days of IV antibiotics.

667/1624

Routine repeat LP is not needed.

CASE 8: Head TraumaSubdural
Setting: ED
CC: “Hit in head playing football”
VS: BP: 144/92 mm Hg; P: 54 beats/
minute; T: 100.8°F; R: 18 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 20-year-old college student was
hit in the head when he was tackled in a
football game. The patient had just received a thrown ball and was immediately tackled and knocked into a nearby
wall striking his head. He lost consciousness. The patient awoke about 10

668/1624

minutes later and was disoriented when
loaded into the ambulance.

Cushing Reflex
• Increased intracranial pressure
• Hypertension
• Bradycardia

PMHX: none
Medications: none
PE:
General: groggy, somewhat lethargic
Neurological examination: no focal
deficits detected

669/1624

HEENT: pupils equally round and
reactive
Initial Orders:
Head CT without contrast

What is the mechanism of dilated
pupil in intracranial bleeding?
a. Hypertension from any cause
b. Brainstem stroke
c. Compression of third cranial nerve
d. Meningeal irritation
Answer c. Compression of third cranial
nerve
Large bleeds that cause uncal herniation will
compress the third cranial nerve. The parasympathetic fibers are on the outside of the
nerve and will be damaged first.

670/1624

Parasympathetic fibers normally constrict a
pupil. If you compress the parasympathetic
fibers on the outside of the third cranial
nerve, the pupil will dilate.

The dilation of a pupil is on the same
side as a bleed.

Advance the clock. The CT scan is performed and you are waiting for the report. Repeat the physical examination
after 15 to 30 minutes in severe head
trauma.
PE:
General: more lethargic, difficult to
arouse

Neurological examination: hard to
assess because of altered mental
status; some weakness of left side of
body
HEENT: dilation of right pupil only

What is the mechanism of the
“lucid interval” in which the
patient awakens, then loses
consciousness?
a. Constriction of cerebral vessels
b. Accumulation of blood in skull decreasing
perfusion
c. Cerebellar dysfunction
d. Decreased myocardial contractility
Answer b. Accumulation of blood in skull
decreasing perfusion

672/1624

Both subdural and epidural hematoma can
cause a “lucid interval.” The initial loss of
consciousness (LOC) is from the shock of
head trauma. This is the same as in a concussion. After the patient awakens, there can be
an accumulation of blood in the skull. This
accumulation of blood increases intracranial
pressure and decreases cerebral perfusion.
The decrease in perfusion causes a second
loss of consciousness. This is the reason we
must observe people who have had head
trauma. We are observing for an increase in
intracranial pressure from blood that subsequently alters mental status.

As soon as the mental status and neurological examination start to deteriorate, you should immediately intubate
and hyperventilate the patient. If the
CT results are not back, you should
still do this.

673/1624

Indication for Intubation after Head
Trauma
• Worsening mental status
• New focal neurological deficits
• Unilateral dilated pupil
Pupil dilates = Herniate = Do
not wait = INTUBATE +
hyperventilate!

What is the mechanism of a
beneficial effect in
hyperventilating intracranial
hemorrhage?
a. Decreased PCO2 constricts cerebral
vessels.
b. Increased oxygen constricts cerebral
vessels.
c. Raising pH increases cerebral perfusion.

674/1624

d. Bicarbonate improves perfusion.
Answer a. Decreased PCO2 constricts
cerebral vessels.
Cerebral vasculature is very sensitive to concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2). When
CO2 is high, cerebral vessels dilate to remove
this metabolic waste product. When CO2 is
low, the blood vessels will constrict and perfusion decreases. In a normal person, this
small change in overall intracranial volume
will not have a meaningful impact on cerebral perfusion, but when you have a massive
increase in intracranial pressure a small
change in volume can result in a big drop in
pressure. This decrease in pressure is to help
slow down uncal herniation until you have
time to surgically decompress the skull and
drain the blood out. Hyperventilation is a
bridge to surgical decompression.

675/1624

Low compliance creates big changes in
pressure with small changes in volume.
The skull has low compliance:
Small Decrease in Volume = Big
Decrease in Pressure

Move the clock forward to allow the
intubation and to get results of the CT
scan. Hyperventilation is a temporary
bridge to the definitive procedure,
which is surgical decompression.
Report:
Head CT: large subdural hematoma
on right side, midline shift present
(Figure 4-4)

676/1624

SC, et al. Principles and Practice of Hospital Medicine. New
York: McGraw-Hill; 2012.)

677/1624

Vasoconstriction from hyperventilation
wears off rapidly.

Blood in brain causes fever.
Any clot or collection of blood causes
fever.

Orders:
Mannitol IV
Neurosurgery evaluation
Craniotomy and drainage
Move to ICU if not already done
ECG

678/1624

You cannot move the patient to a location called “Operating Room.” Order the
procedure the patient needs (e.g., craniology/drainage).

Move the clock only 15 to 30 minutes
in a rapidly developing case such as
this. Reexamine the neurological system each time.
Report:
ECG: deeply inverted T waves

Target PCO2 25 to 30 mm Hg with
hyperventilation

679/1624

Intracranial bleeding and head trauma
are associated with T-wave inversion on
ECG.

“Cerebral T waves”
• Massive sympathetic outflow
• Vasoconstriction of coronary arteries

Leave the patient in the ICU after the
craniotomy and drainage. Place a
ventriculostomy tube for both drainage
and pressure monitoring. Do not move
the patient out of the ICU until the
ventriculostomy is removed and the
neurological examination stabilizes. On
CCS, a case of massive intracranial
bleeding with herniation and the need

680/1624

for emergency surgical decompression
will emphasize initial management.

Which of the following is proven
to benefit this patient?
a. Methylprednisolone (steroids)
b. Pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitors)
c. Antiepileptic drugs
Answer b. Pantoprazole (proton pump
inhibitors)
Stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump
inhibitors (PPIs) is indicated in head trauma,
burns, and those undergoing mechanical
ventilation.

CHAPTER 5

683/1624

GASTROENTEROLO
CASE 1: Gastrointestinal
Bleeding
Setting: ED
CC: “My stool is black.”
VS: BP: 96/56 mm Hg; P: 108 beats/
minute; T: 98.8°F; R: 22 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 76-year-old man with a history
of aortic stenosis (AS) comes with 3
days of multiple red, black stools. He
had five episodes just today. He is dyspneic on exertion and comes now because of tiredness.

684/1624

PMHX:
AS
Hypertension
Former tobacco smoker
Hyperlipidemia
Medications:
Atorvastatin
Nifedipine
PE:
Cardiovascular: 3/6 murmur radiating to carotid arteries
Abdomen: soft, nontender

What is the most important first
step to take with this patient?
a. Check for orthostasis.
b. Start normal saline (NS) bolus.
c. Order a colonoscopy.

685/1624

d. Order an upper endoscopy.
Answer b. Start normal saline (NS) bolus.
Fluid resuscitation is by far the most important thing you can do for a person with a large
gastrointestinal (GI) tract bleed. It is far
more important to restore perfusion pressure than to look for the precise etiology of
the bleed. Also, a tachycardia (pulse rate
>100 beats/minute) at rest or systolic blood
pressure (SBP) <100 mm Hg indicates a 30%
blood volume loss. For an average-sized person, this is 1.5 to 2 L of volume lost.
Orthostasis implies the loss of about 15% to
20% of blood volume. This person’s current
blood pressure (BP) (96/56 mm Hg) and
pulse rate (108 beats/minute) imply that
more volume has been lost than would occur
with mere orthostasis. When intravascular
volume is low, there should be an increase in
heart rate and a vasoconstriction of peripheral vessels to fully correct BP.

686/1624

Orthostasis:
Check BP and pulse rate when the patient is laying down, then sitting up or
standing:
• Increase in pulse rate >10 beats/
minute
• Decrease in systolic BP >20 mm Hg

Orthostasis: 15% to 20% volume lost
SBP <100 mm Hg or pulse rate >100
beats/minute = 30% blood volume lost

Orthostasis is detected by:
• Decreased firing of mechanoreceptors
• Carotid, aortic arch

687/1624

Where is the information
processed that detects decreased
firing of carotid and aortic
baroreceptors resulting in
vasoconstriction and tachycardia?
a. Frontal lobes
b. Medulla oblongata
c. Hypothalamus
d. Thalamus
e. Internal capsule
Answer b. Medulla oblongata
The medulla receives information from the
stretch or mechanoreceptors of the carotid
artery, atria, and aortic arch. Decreased
pressure in peripheral pressure or
mechanoreceptors results in decreased firing. The medulla will respond with a peripheral vasoconstriction and tachycardia.
Norepinephrine
will
stimulate

688/1624

alpha-1-receptors in arterioles causing vasoconstriction. This compensation is incomplete when changing position if there is >15%
to 20% blood volume loss.

Initial Orders:
NS or Ringer lactate bolus
Complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT),
type and cross, CHEM-20
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Pantoprazole IV
GI consult
Move the clock forward 15 minutes
and recheck both blood pressure and
pulse rate. If the SBP is <100 mm Hg,
reorder a bolus of intravenous (IV)
NS. If after two boluses, the SBP is still

689/1624

low, transfer the patient to the intensive care unit (ICU).
On the computer-based case simulation (CCS), the consultant does not tell
you what to do, but in this case, getting
a GI consultation implies you know they
are needed for serious GI tract bleeding.
Report:
CBC: hematocrit 32%; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 82 fL; platelets
185,000/μL
PT, aPTT: normal
Chemistry: blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) 32 g/dL (elevated); creatinine
1.1 mg/dL
ECG: no ST-T or T-wave
abnormalities

690/1624

The first CBC is not accurate in acute
bleeding. You must always repeat it to
see the trend.

If the PT or aPTT is prolonged
(elevated), what is the best way to
correct it?
a. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
b. Vitamin K orally
c. Vitamin K IV
d. Cryoprecipitate
Answer a. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
The fastest way to correct a coagulopathy is
with FFP. Vitamin K needs at least 12 to 24
hours to work in order to generate clotting
factors. If there is liver insufficiency, then
FFP will not work at all. Cryoprecipitate is a

691/1624

condensation of clotting factors from pooled
multiple donors. You will collect 50% of the
clotting factors in 10% of the volume of fluid.
Cryoprecipitate is best when you need
enormous amounts of clotting factors and
FFP is not enough or the volume of FFP required to provide that amount of clotting
factor would be too great.

Which of the following is in
highest concentration in
cryoprecipitate?
a. Fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor
b. Factor II, VII
c. Factor XI, X
d. Factor XII
Answer a. Fibrinogen, von Willebrand
factor

692/1624

Cryoprecipitate is especially high in fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor
VIII. The reason we never use cryoprecipitate first for anyone is that we use desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) for vWF and recombinant factor VIII for hemophilia and
those with von Willebrand disease (vWD)
not responding to DDAVP.

Cryoprecipitate is a pooled product.
Pooled products transmit more viruses.

The patient’s repeat BP is 100/64 mm
Hg and pulse rate is 102 beats/minute.
Orders:
Bolus NS
CBC

693/1624

BUN level rises with decreased renal
perfusion or prerenal azotemia.

Why does the BUN level rise in
prerenal azotemia?
a. Angiotensin breaks down proteins.
b. Catecholamine release breaks down
proteins.
c. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increases
urea absorption at the collecting duct.
d. ADH decreases urea excretion at proximal
tubule.
Answer c. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increases urea absorption at the collecting
duct.
When ADH increases the permeability of the
collecting duct to water, it also stimulates

694/1624

urea transporters that increase urea reabsorption. This helps maintain the high osmolarity of the renal medulla so that water
can be reabsorbed. Although urea is a metabolic end product of protein metabolism,
neither angiotensin nor catecholamines has
any effect on protein production or destruction. Angiotensin does increase urea levels.

ADH stimulates UT1 or “urea transporter 1” in the collecting duct to absorb
urea.

More ADH = More Urea Reabsorbed

Blood in the upper GI tract increases
BUN level.

695/1624

With major GI tract bleeding, move
the clock forward 15 to 30 minutes. IV
fluids and proton pump inhibitors
(PPIs) should be running
continuously.

Which therapy has a definite
benefit in acute upper GI tract
bleeding?
a. PPI
b. H2-blocker
c. Sucralfate
d. Nasogastric tube
e. Iced saline lavage
Answer a. PPI
PPIs do have a benefit in stopping and controlling acute upper GI tract bleeding. This

696/1624

has never been shown with the H2-blockers
or sucralfate. The nasogastric (NG) tube has
extremely little benefit. There is no therapeutic intervention with an NG tube. The
iced saline lavage is useless.

Move the clock forward to get CBC
results:
The repeat CBC shows hematocrit
level at 29% and platelet count at
165,000/μL.

What mechanism explains the
drop in hematocrit concentration
from 32% to 29% in this patient?
a. Continued upper GI tract blood loss
b. Continued lower GI tract blood loss
c. Dilution from hydration

697/1624

Answer c. Dilution from hydration
It is expected that patients will have a decrease of 3 to 4 points in hematocrit concentration just from hydration of fluids. You
should only consider a decrease more than
this amount to be significant.

Black Stool or Melena = Upper GI Tract
Source
Upper GI Tract Source = Proximal to
Ligament of Treitz

Which of the following is a
definite benefit of an NG tube?
a. Decreases mortality
b. Can help determine source of bleeding
c. Stops rate of blood loss

698/1624

d. Eliminates need for endoscopy
Answer b. Can help determine source of
bleeding
If you are going to do upper endoscopy in a
patient, NG tube placement is useless and
painful. If you do not know whether to scope
from above or below, an NG tube is occasionally useful to help localize the source of
bleeding to the upper GI tract. The problem
with the NG tube, besides its discomfort, is
that a negative lavage misses 30% of bleeding especially if it is in the duodenum. Red
blood from the NG tube indicates an upper
GI tract source. Only the use of an NG tube
definitively excludes an upper GI tract
source if you see bile in the aspirate.

An NG tube misses 30% of upper GI
tract bleeds.

699/1624

A CBC after 2 hours of hydration
shows the following:
Hematocrit 23%
Platelets 145,000/μL

What would be the likely cause of
death in a patient with GI tract
bleeding?
a. Stroke
b. Myocardial infarction
c. Congestive heart failure (CHF)
d. High output cardiac failure
e. Renal failure
Answer b. Myocardial infarction
Decreased oxygen-carrying capacity to the
myocardium leads to ischemia. Myocytes in
the heart cannot distinguish between

700/1624

hypoxia, coronary stenosis, or anemia. Ultimately, with severe bleeding and anemia,
the patient will infarct his heart. This patient
has AS. That implies a 50% to 70% chance of
coronary disease as well. An older person
needs to keep the hematocrit concentration
>25% to 30%. A young, healthy person can
easily tolerate a hematocrit level of 20% or
25% until his or her bone marrow recovers in
2 to 3 weeks.

Older people or those with coronary disease die at hematocrit levels that just
make a younger person tired.

After several hours, do an “Interval
History.” Also do an Interval History
if there is a change in laboratory

701/1624

values such as this drop in hematocrit
concentration.
The patient reports feeling lightheaded and short of breath. This is an
absolute indication for transfusion in
addition to a dropping blood count on
CBC.
Orders:
Packed red blood cells
CBC
Upper endoscopy

Hematocrit should increase by 3 points
for each unit of packed red blood cells
given.

702/1624

On CCS, treatments like transfusion are
considered done or “administered” immediately, but you cannot detect the effects of them until after you move the
clock forward and get a repeat test.

After an hour post transfusion, you repeat the CBC and see the following:
Hematocrit: 25%
Platelets: 132,000/μL

At what platelet count should you
order a platelet transfusion?
a. <150,000/μL
b. <100,000/μL
c. <50,000/μL

703/1624

d. <10,000/μL
Answer c. <50,000/μL
Give platelets when the level drops below
50,000/μL when patients are bleeding or going for surgery. If a patient is not bleeding,
you never need to keep the count that high.

Death from GI tract bleed is from inadequate fluid resuscitation.

The upper endoscopy was performed
and no varices were found, but there is
an ulcer in the duodenum with a visible bleeding vessel. The vessel was injected with epinephrine and electrical
diathermy or cautery was applied and
the bleeding has ceased.

704/1624

What would be done differently if
there were esophageal varices?
a. Octreotide and banding
b. Octreotide and sclerotherapy
c. Propranolol
d. Blakemore tube
e. Surgical shunt
f. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt (TIPS)
Answer a. Octreotide and banding
Octreotide decreases acute variceal bleeding.
Banding stops bleeding vessels. Sclerotherapy is only done if banding cannot be performed for a technical reason. Sclerotherapy
has far greater risk of ulceration and stricture later. Propranolol prevents subsequent
bleeding. Beta-blockers have no effect in
acute GI tract bleeding.

705/1624

A Blakemore tube is rarely ever used. It is
a temporary procedure to tamponade bleeding vessels until surgery or the TIPS procedure can be done.

Octreotide is a somatostatin.
Somatostatin decreases portal
hypertension.

After the procedure, repeat the CBC
several times every few hours. Continue the PPI. When the CBC shows the
hematocrit level has stabilized, the patient can be transferred out of the ICU.

CASE 2: Achalasia

706/1624

Setting: ambulatory care center
CC: “Food gets stuck when I eat.”
HPI: A 37-year-old woman with difficulty swallowing over the past few
months comes to the ambulatory care
center. She says that the difficulty has
been with solid food as well as liquids. It
has continued to worsen. She now
wakes up with undigested food particles
on her pillow. There is no pain on
swallowing.
ROS:
No tobacco use
Minimal alcohol consumption
Twelve-pound weight loss over 3
months
PMHX/Medications: none
PE:

707/1624

General: no visible distress
Abdomen: normal
Chest: normal
Rectal: stool heme negative
Initial Orders:
Comprehensive metabolic panel
(CHEM-20)
Chest x-ray

Barium is okay to start with for dysphagia cases.

Esophagus: Barium is useful.
Stomach: Barium is not useful.

708/1624

Ambulatory cases should be moved forward a week at a time if there is a new
diagnosis to make. Chronic, long-term
disease is moved forward at 1-month to
3-month intervals. Any patient with GI
tract bleeding should have a GI consultation ordered.

A week later, the patient feels the
same. Dysphagia for solid food and liquid continues. Food particles continue to be found on her pillow in the
morning.
Reports:
CHEM-20: BUN 4 g/dL (slightly
low); albumin 3.6 g/dL
Chest x-ray: widening at the top of
the mediastinum

709/1624

Wide Mediastinum
+ Chest pain = Dissection
+ Dysphagia = Esophagus

Dysphagia with pain on
swallowing is odynophagia. In a
person with acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) and a CD4 cell count <100
cells/mm3, what is the first step?
a. Endoscopy
b. Fluconazole
c. Stool candida culture
d. Serum candida antigen
e. Chest computed tomography (CT)
Answer b. Fluconazole

710/1624

AIDS with a CD4 cell count <100 cells/mm3
plus odynophagia indicates esophageal candidiasis in 90% of patients. Because there is
such a high likelihood of candida in AIDS,
this is one of the few times you can use empiric therapy to confirm a diagnosis. There is
no such test as serum candida antigen. If
there is no response, then do an endoscopy.

Never culture stool for yeast! Everyone
has yeast in their stool.

Schedule the patient to see a gastroenterologist and order a barium esophagram. There is no blood test for any
form of dysphagia.
Report:

711/1624

Barium esophagram: wide at top,
narrow at bottom (Figure 5-1)
Gastroenterologist: no specific recommendations; order what you
think is necessary

Figure 5-1. Esophageal achalasia. Note dilation of the esophageal body, retained barium, and distal esophageal narrowing (bird’s beak). (Reproduced with permission from
Doherty GM. Current Diagnosis & Treatment: Surgery,
13th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2010.)

What is the most accurate
diagnostic test?
a. Endoscopy
b. Manometry
c. Biopsy
d. Secretin stimulation test
Answer b. Manometry
The single most accurate test for achalasia is
manometry. This is never a test that is done
first. Manometry is the right answer when a
patient has a swallowing disorder and no
clear diagnosis after barium and endoscopy.

714/1624

Proximal esophagus: skeletal muscle.
Distal esophagus: smooth muscle.

Smooth muscle is connected by gap
junctions. When stretched, it contracts
as a syncytium.

Now consider the occurrence of
intermittent chest pain in a man
whose ECG and stress test are
normal. The chest pain is brought
on by cold drinks. It is prevented
by calcium channel blockers and
nitrates. What is the most
accurate test?
a. Barium
b. Manometry

715/1624

c. Endoscopy
Answer b. Manometry
Esophageal spasm is characterized by intermittent severe contraction of the smooth
muscle of the esophagus. Manometry is most
accurate. Calcium channel blockers and nitrates relax smooth muscle.

Consultations on CCS will not tell you
what to order. In this case, order the upper endoscopy yourself. If consultants
told you what to order, then the Step 3
examination could not test your knowledge level.

Move the clock ahead until you see
“Report Available” on the upper

716/1624

endoscopy. The report shows smooth
mucosa with no lesions and narrowing at the distal esophagus.

Plummer-Vinson Syndrome
• Iron deficiency without bleeding
• Some transform to squamous cell
cancer

Barrett Esophagus Histology
• Columnar metaplasia
• Becomes adenocarcinoma, not
squamous

717/1624

Why does the lower esophageal
sphincter (LES) tighten in
achalasia?
a. Loss of myenteric plexus
b. Loss of Auerbach plexus
c. Decrease in vasoactive intestinal peptide
(VIP)
d. Excess vagal tone
Answer a. Loss of myenteric plexus
Achalasia is the loss or degeneration of the
inhibitory neurons of the esophageal wall.
There is incomplete peristalsis. Auerbach
plexus is what is lost in Hirschsprung
disease.

It is not known why the neurons degenerate in achalasia.

718/1624

What causes the receptive
relaxation that opens the stomach
from 50 mL to 2000 mL on
eating?
a. Epinephrine
b. VIP
c. Dopamine
d. Norepinephrine
e. Serotonin
Answer b. VIP
Stretch receptors in the stomach detect increased volume and through vagal stimulation release VIP. VIP is what opens the stomach for receptive relaxation.

VIP opens GI tract sphincters.

719/1624

Now that achalasia is confirmed, a
dilation procedure with an endoscope
or surgical myotomy can be performed. Dilation procedures are less
invasive, but also have a higher risk of
perforation.
For those declining either procedure, botulinum toxin, or Botox, can be
injected into the LES. These injections
have less complications, but they also
wear off after a few months or a year.

What is the mechanism of
botulinum toxin?
a. Decreased release of acetylcholine from
the presynaptic terminal
b. Blockade of acetylcholine receptor
c. Increased acetylcholine esterase
d. Blockage of the sodium channels

720/1624

Answer a. Decreased release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal
Botulinum toxin prevents the release of vesicles of acetylcholine in response to depolarization of the nerve. The nerve impulse hits
the neuromuscular junction, but no neurotransmitter is released and the muscle
relaxes.
Most people choose endoscopic dilation.
This can be curative. See the patient
immediately after the procedure to
check for perforation. Then ask her to
return several times over the next
month to be sure the procedure is effective. If successful, it should be fully
curative.

721/1624

CASE 3: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
Setting: office
CC: “Heartburn”
HPI: A 27-year-old man with several
months of epigastric discomfort and a
burning sensation in his chest comes to
see you at your office. He says that the
discomfort is worse after he lies down
for a while. He often has a bad taste in
his mouth like “I am sucking on a handful of coins.”
PMHX:
Recurrent pharyngitis
Hoarseness
Chronic cough

722/1624

Acid hits the back of the throat causing
pain.

Twenty-five percent of patients with
chronic cough have reflux disease.

Acid hits the carina causing cough.

Medications:
Multiple short courses of antibiotics
for pharyngitis and cough
Cimetidine intermittently

723/1624

What physical finding is
characteristic of gastroesophageal
reflux disease (GERD)?
a. Epigastric tenderness
b. None
c. Loss of dental enamel
d. Parotid gland enlargement
Answer b. None
GERD is entirely a symptom complex. There
is no physical finding. Loss of dental enamel
and parotid gland enlargement are from
vomiting in anorexia or bulimia, not GERD.
PE: normal
Abdomen: nontender epigastric area

724/1624

GERD is often misdiagnosed as:
• Pharyngitis
• Laryngitis
• Bronchitis

Acid hits the vocal cords causing
hoarseness.

Initial Orders:
PPI, such as omeprazole

Why is cimetidine only effective in
two-thirds of patients?
a. Incomplete inhibition of parietal cell
b. Increase in gastrin production

725/1624

c. Tachyphylaxis (it wears off)
d. Helicobacter pylori
Answer a. Incomplete inhibition of parietal
cell
Histamine is one of three stimulants to the
production of acid at the parietal cell of the
stomach. Because histamine potentiates the
effect of acetylcholine from the vagus nerve
as well as the effect of gastrin, there is a 60%
to 70% reduction in acid production. At least
one-third of patients will not have their acid
production controlled by an H2-blocker such
as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine.

The patient returns the following
week. He has only partial improvement in his symptoms. The bad taste
in his mouth persists.

726/1624

Which cranial nerve is
responsible for the bad taste in his
mouth?
a. V
b. VII
c. VIII
d. IX
e. XII
Answer d. IX
Acid hits the back of the tongue producing a
bitter taste that is often described as “metallic.” Cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) and
X (vagus) transport the sense of taste from
the back of the tongue. The bitter taste receptors and perception are at the back of the
tongue to inhibit the likelihood of aspiration
into the airway. Sweet taste receptors are at
the anterior portion of the tongue and are

727/1624

controlled by the facial nerve, cranial nerve
VII.

After several more weeks of return
visits, it is clear that the PPI is not
completely controlling the patient’s
symptoms.

GERD should be controlled by PPIs in
95% of patients.
Failure of PPI = Confirm the Diagnosis

What should you do to confirm
the diagnosis?
a. Double the dose of the PPI.
b. Do an endoscopy.

728/1624

c. Do a 24-hour pH monitor.
d. Put in an NG tube for acid output.
Answer c. Do a 24-hour pH monitor.
The most accurate test of GERD is the
24-hour pH monitor. Because PPIs are
amazingly effective at 95% symptom control,
the failure of PPI treatment means there is a
20:1 chance that the diagnosis is not really
GERD. Endoscopy can show Barrett esophagus and erosive esophagitis, but you cannot tell that acid is refluxing by endoscopy
alone.

Substances that dilate the LES
• Nicotine
• Alcohol
• Caffeine
• Chocolate

729/1624

• Peppermint

The 24-hour pH monitor confirms the
presence of GERD. The patient continues to be bothered by symptoms of
heartburn. You are planning a surgical or endoscopic procedure to tighten
the LES.

What test should you do prior to a
Nissen fundoplication or other
LES-tightening procedure?
a. Esophageal manometry
b. Chest CT
c. Nuclear gastric emptying test
Answer a. Esophageal manometry

730/1624

You have to be sure the ability of the esophagus to contract is normal prior to an
LES-narrowing procedure. If you tighten the
LES, and esophageal contractility is inadequate, you will create a blockade like
achalasia.

Nuclear gastric emptying using bariumsoaked bread tests for diabetic
gastroparesis.

After the procedure, symptoms resolve
for 2 years. There is a recurrence of
GERD-like symptoms and PPIs are
now given regularly. PPIs control the
symptoms. Upper endoscopy shows
columnar metaplasia.

731/1624

What is the management?
a. Distal esophagectomy
b. Endoscopic mucosal resection
c. PPIs and repeat endoscopy in 2 to 3 years
d. Repeat surgical tightening
Answer c. PPIs and repeat endoscopy in 2
to 3 years
Barrett esophagus or columnar metaplasia of
the distal esophagus is managed by doing
surveillance endoscopy every 2 to 3 years.

• Patients with Barrett esophagus have a
0.5% per year chance of esophageal
cancer.
• Patients with low-grade dysplasia need
repeat endoscopy every 6 months.

732/1624

• Patients with high-grade dysplasia
need endoscopic mucosal resection.

Most patients with GERD do not progress to Barrett esophagus and only a
very few go on to cancer.

CASE 4: Peptic Ulcer Disease
Setting: office
CC: “My stomach hurts.”
VS: BP: 118/86 mm Hg; P: 84 beats/
minute; T: 97.8° F; R: 16 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 43-year-old infectious diseases
doctor visits to your office complaining

733/1624

of epigastric pain over the past few
weeks. The patient is extremely tense,
undergoing a divorce, and has been
having increasing epigastric pain despite the use of H2-blockers and liquid
antacids at first and now omeprazole.

What is the most common cause
of epigastric pain?
a. GERD
b. Nonulcer (functional) dyspepsia
c. Duodenal ulcer
d. Gastric ulcer
e. Gastritis
Answer b. Nonulcer (functional) dyspepsia
Fifty to ninety percent of epigastric pain is
functional dyspepsia and no etiology is ever
found. Ulcers make up only 10% to 15% of
epigastric pain. Nonulcer dyspepsia is like a

734/1624

tension headache. It is, by far, the most common cause of the pain and nothing of the
mechanism is clear.

PMHX: none
Medications: omeprazole only

“Alarm symptoms” indicating urgent
endoscopy:
• Weight loss
• Blood in stool or anemia
• Dysphagia

ROS:
No weight loss

735/1624

No blood in stool
No dysphagia

Which is reliably associated with
tenderness on examination?
a. Duodenal ulcer
b. Pancreatitis
c. Gastric ulcer
d. Nonulcer dyspepsia
Answer b. Pancreatitis
Only pancreatitis is routinely associated with
epigastric tenderness. Ulcer disease is tender
only about 10% of the time.

PE:

736/1624

General: anxious, well-built muscular man
Abdomen: soft, nontender
Initial Orders:
Upper endoscopy
Gastroenterology evaluation
Continue omeprazole

When is “scope” the answer for epigastric pain?
• Alarm symptoms
• Bleeding
• Age >45 to 55 years
• Symptoms not resolving with PPIs

737/1624

Upper endoscopy shows a large gastric ulcer. A biopsy is obtained for H.
pylori. The rapid urease test is positive
for Helicobacter.

How is a gastric ulcer managed
differently than a duodenal ulcer?
a. PPIs are not used.
b. Repeat the endoscopy and do a biopsy in 4
to 8 weeks.
c. Treat H. pylori.
Answer b. Repeat the endoscopy and do a
biopsy in 4 to 8 weeks.
A gastric ulcer is associated with cancer. A
duodenal ulcer is not associated with cancer.
Re-scope the gastric ulcer to be sure it has
resolved and there is no cancer. The

738/1624

indication for endoscopy in this patient was
the failure of antisecretory therapy with
PPIs.

Orders:
Continue PPI
Start amoxicillin and clarithromycin

Gastric ulcer: 4% cancer
Duodenal ulcer: 0% cancer

How does H. pylori survive in the
acid of the stomach?
a. Flagella keeps it in the lumen of the
stomach.
b. Bicarbonate production increases.

739/1624

c. Urease makes ammonia to neutralize acid.
d. Urease inhibits the proton pump.
Answer c. Urease makes ammonia to neutralize acid.
Helicobacter has urease. Urease makes ammonia out of urea. Ammonia (NH3) binds
acid (H+) and turns it into ammonium
(NH4+). This is how acid is neutralized. That
is the fundamental basic science you need to
know about ulcers.

Helicobacter neutralizes acid with
ammonia.

740/1624

For which of the following is
treatment for Helicobacter NOT
indicated when found?
a. GERD
b. Duodenal ulcer
c. Gastric ulcer
d. Gastritis
e. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
lymphoma (MALToma)
Answer a. GERD
Helicobacter does not cause GERD. It is associated with all the others and is largely the
causative organism.
Six weeks after therapy, the patient’s
symptoms have resolved. Repeat endoscopy does not reveal evidence of ulcer
or cancer. All patients with evidence of

741/1624

Helicobacter should be tested to confirm that it has been eradicated.

When positive, these tests indicate a current infection
• Breath testing
• Stool antigen

CASE 5: Zollinger-Ellison
Syndrome
Setting: office
CC: “Why do my ulcers keep coming
back?”

742/1624

VS: BP:114/74 mm Hg; P: 88 beats/
minute; T: 97.8°F; R: 14 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 43-year-old man who was recently tested and treated for a gastric
ulcer now comes to your office with recurrence of epigastric pain. The eradication of the last gastric ulcer was confirmed by repeat endoscopy several
weeks after treatment. A biopsy showed
no cancer at the time. Testing for active
Helicobacter infection was negative as
well. He restarted a PPI 2 weeks ago but
still has epigastric discomfort. He took
ibuprofen for a few days for the pain.
ROS:
Diarrhea several times a day
Medications:
Esomeprazole
Ibuprofen

743/1624

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) are the second most common
cause of ulcers.

1. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandins.
2. Prostaglandins make gastric mucus.
3. Gastric mucus protects against acid.

PE:
Abdomen: soft, nontender, hyperactive bowel sounds
Skin: vesicular lesions on extensor
surfaces

744/1624

Which of these tests cannot
determine if H. pylori infection is
current and active?
a. Stool antigen
b. Breath testing
c. Serology
d. Biopsy
Answer c. Serology
The presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG)
alone for serology for H. pylori cannot show
that the infection is active. Serology cannot
tell old versus new infection. We tend to use
the stool antigen test more often for technical reasons—it is easier to do and no equipment is needed—in an office. Biologically,
carbon-labeled urea and stool antigen testing
are equal.

745/1624

Breath Test Mechanism
1. The patient drinks urea that is labeled
with radioactive carbon.
2. Urease splits off the ammonia.
3. Ammonia (NH3) binds to acid and
stays in the gut as NH4+.
4. Carbon dioxide (CO2) with label (C13
or C14) is exhaled and detected.

Initial Orders:
Do a Helicobacter stool antigen test.
Continue esomeprazole.
Stop ibuprofen.

746/1624

Exclude persistent Helicobacter infection as a cause of treatment failure first.

If Helicobacter was not eradicated
with PPI, amoxicillin, and
clarithromycin, what would be the
first step?
a. Retreat with the same regimen.
b. Continue PPI; switch antibiotics to metronidazole, tetracycline, and bismuth
subsalicylate.
c. Obtain sensitivity testing of the organism.
d. Repeat the endoscopy.
e. Add an H2-blocker.
Answer b. Continue PPI; switch antibiotics
to metronidazole, tetracycline, and bismuth
subsalicylate.

747/1624

Manage persistent Helicobacter infections as
a failure of antibiotics and possible resistance to the original antibiotics. Switching the
medications and trying that for 2 to 3 weeks
is easier than waiting for sensitivity testing.
Bismuth’s effect is to suppress Helicobacter
infection.

The Interval History shows that the
patient says his pain persists. He saw
another clinician, who ordered a serum gastrin level, which is elevated.

What is the meaning of the
elevated gastrin?
a. Everyone on a PPI has an elevated gastrin,
it means nothing at this time.
b. He has Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES).
c. The patient must have a pancreatic lesion.

748/1624

Answer a. Everyone on a PPI has an elevated gastrin, it means nothing at this time.
Gastrin levels should not be evaluated while
patients are on PPIs. Every time you lower
gastric acidity with a PPI, H2-blocker, or liquid antacid, the gastrin level will rise. To
diagnose ZES or gastrinoma, you need to
evaluate the gastrin level after stopping PPI
therapy.

Acid is feedback inhibition on gastrin.
NORMAL: Low Acid = High Gastrin

Have the patient return to discuss the
results of Helicobacter testing.

749/1624

Also, any time you have a complicated case that fails primary therapy,
order a consultation in the area. This
shows that you know when you need
help.
Report:
Stool antigen is negative for
Helicobacter.
Order:
Upper endoscopy
Move the clock forward to get the endoscopy done. If pain persists after
NSAIDs are stopped and persistent
Helicobacter infection has been excluded, you need to scope the patient.
Report:

750/1624

Upper endoscopy: multiple, large ulcers in second and third portions of
duodenum

Evaluate gastrin level after stopping PPI
therapy when the patient has
• Large ulcers (>1 cm)
• Multiple ulcers
• A recurrence of symptoms after
Helicobacter eradication
• Distal ulcers (past the first part of the
duodenum)

Hold the PPIs for a day and recheck
the gastrin level or measure gastric
acid output with a tube.

751/1624

High Acid + High Gastrin = ZES

The patient comes to the office after
not taking a PPI for 2 days and has
both the gastrin level and the gastric
acid output measured. Both are elevated, but the gastrin level is only marginally elevated and not higher than
1000 pg/mL.

When gastrin levels are
equivocally elevated, what test
will confirm gastrinoma?
a. Ultrasound
b. CT
c. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
d. Secretin suppression test
e. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)

752/1624

Answer d. Secretin suppression test
Secretin should normally lower gastrin
levels. Secretin decreases acid by releasing
bicarbonate-rich fluid from the pancreas. Secretin also shuts off acid production by decreasing gastrin by a direct suppressive effect. In gastrinoma, the gastrin level will not
go down with secretin.
Endocrine disorders must always be confirmed with a function test before an imaging
test. You cannot tell the functional content of
a lesion by ultrasound (US), CT, or MRI.
EUS is an excellent test for locating lesions
in the pancreas, but it cannot show the functional content of the lesion.

1. Gastrin stimulates parietal cells to
make acid.
2. Acid in the duodenum makes secretin.

753/1624

3. Secretin releases 2 to 3 L/day of
bicarbonate-rich fluid from the
pancreas.

Normal: Secretin suppresses gastrin to
stop acid production.
Gastrinoma: Secretin cannot suppress
gastrin.

The patient returns earlier than expected because of sudden worsening of
diarrhea during the test for gastric
acid output and gastrin levels while
stopping the PPI. Both gastrin and
acid levels were high. In addition,

754/1624

there was a change in stool
“character.”

What is the mechanism of the
diarrhea?
a. Acid inactivates lipase.
b. Acid increases GI tract motility.
c. Gastrin opens sphincters.
d. It is caused by bacterial overgrowth from
long-term PPI use.
e. Pepsin deactivation
Answer a. Acid inactivates lipase.
Lipase in the duodenum works at a pH >4.
When acid is massively overproduced as it is
in gastrinoma, you frequently get diarrhea. It
is effectively a steatorrhea. Pepsin that is
made in the stomach is inactivated by basic

755/1624

pH in the duodenum. This is why the
physiologic effect of pepsin is limited and it
is not necessary for life.
Acid in the duodenum actually decreases
gastric motility. Gastrin directly stimulates
stomach motility and growth. The acid the
gastrin makes slows the small bowel
motility.

Normal GI tract physiology:
• Acid in the duodenum slows stomach
emptying.
• Acid inactivates lipase.
• Base inactivates pepsin.

Gastric acid output and gastrin level
are high. The patient’s diarrhea resolves with restarting a PPI. You can

756/1624

cure gastrinoma by surgical removal
if the lesion is solitary. If it is metastatic, the patient will need lifelong
PPIs and there is no cure.
Orders:
Abdominal CT
Calcium level
The abdominal CT and MRI do not
show metastatic disease. The calcium
level is normal. There was actually an
increase in the gastrin level with the
use of secretin. High calcium level with
gastrinoma would have meant hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism with gastrinoma means possible
multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)
syndrome.

757/1624

When do you look for MEN?
• Hypercalcemia
High Calcium + Gastrinoma =
Look for MEN

Why is there a paradoxical rise in
gastrin with the use of secretin in
gastrinoma (ZES)?
a. Secretin directly stimulates gastrin in
gastrinoma.
b. Cholecystokinin level increases.
c. Bicarbonate release raises pH and removes any residual feedback inhibition on
G cells.

758/1624

Answer c. Bicarbonate release raises pH
and removes any residual feedback inhibition on G cells.
Gastrinoma is an adenoma. Adenomas can
return some residual normal feedback inhibition sensitivity. When secretin causes the
ductal cells of the pancreas to release
bicarbonate-rich fluid, there is loss of the
normal feedback inhibition provided by acid.
If the abdominal CT does not show
metastases, order an EUS and nuclear
somatostatin scan. When using both
modalities, you exceed 95% sensitivity
in finding metastatic gastrinoma. You
want to be sure the disease is local before you go in and resect it.
Orders:
EUS
Nuclear somatostatin scan

759/1624

Both tests have negative results. The
patient should undergo surgical resection of the gastrinoma and the disorder
will resolve.

Gastrinoma leads to increased somatostatin receptors in the GI tract.

CASE 6: Inflammatory Bowel
Disease
Setting: ED
CC: “I have blood in my stool.”
VS: BP:110/70 mm Hg; P: 84 beats/
minute; T: 101.1°F; R: 12 breaths/
minute

760/1624

HPI: A 23 -year-old medical student
arrives at the ED with blood and mucus
in her stool that she says has been going
on for several weeks to months. She also
has low-grade fever and weight loss.
The frequency of bowel movements has
increased and that is why she has come
today to the ED.
ROS: joint pain, diffusely
PMHX: none
Medications: Patient tried ciprofloxacin for diarrhea with no effect.
PE:
General: tired, weak, and angry
appearing
Abdomen: soft, nontender
Skin: red-brown tender lesion below
the knees
Initial Orders:

761/1624

CBC
Stool studies: culture, ova/parasite
examination
CHEM-20
IV NS
Orthostatic BP assessment

Which one of these is associated
with blood?
a. Giardia
b. Entamoeba histolytica
c. Cryptosporidia
Answer b. Entamoeba histolytica
The only protozoan that gives blood in stool
is Entamoeba. Infection of any kind is highly
unlikely to be going on for “weeks to
months.” It is very rare for any infection to
last more than a few days. Infections are

762/1624

generally all self-limited and last for <1
week.

Forms of Diarrhea Never with Blood
• Viral
• Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus
cereus
• Giardia
• Cryptosporidia
• Cholera

One hour later in the ED, the initial reports are ready:
CBC: hematocrit 32%; normal MCV;
white blood cells (WBCs) 14,500/μL;
platelets 535,000/μL

763/1624

CHEM-20: potassium normal; albumin 2.7 g/dL (low); calcium 7.2 mg/
dL (low)
Stool studies: results pending for the
culture, ova/parasite examination
Orthostatic BP: not present

Platelet and WBC level can be elevated
from any inflammatory stress.

Low Albumin Level = Low Total Calcium Level

Albumin down 1 g/dL = Calcium down
0.8 mg/dL

764/1624

This is chronic diarrhea and it is
nearly impossible to have an infection
such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, or
Shigella going on for weeks or months.
There is evidence of malnutrition or
malabsorption with the low albumin.

What test distinguishes between
anemia of chronic disease and
malabsorption with both iron and
vitamin B12/folate deficiency?
a. Reticulocyte count
b. Red cell blood distribution width (RDW)
c. MCV
Answer b. Red blood cell distribution width
(RDW)

765/1624

RDW is a measure of how similar all the cells
are in size. If all cells are the same size, the
RDW is low, because there is no “distribution” of width, they are all the same. If some
cells are small and some are large, the
“mean” corpuscular volume or MCV will be
normal, but the RDW will be increased. This
is because some cells will be small and some
large, with a normal average.
All nutritional deficiencies give a low reticulocyte count.

For chronic diarrhea cases, hydrate
the patient and move the clock forward to get stool study results. Once
you have excluded infections, order
endoscopy and GI evaluation.
Reports:
Stool culture: no growth
RDW: Increased

766/1624

Stool ova/parasites: negative
Several weeks of bloody diarrhea, mucus, fever, and weight loss are suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) in general. There is no clear way
to distinguish between Crohn disease
(CD) of the colon and ulcerative colitis
(UC) without endoscopy and sometimes biopsy.

What is the difference between UC
and CD?
a. Joint pain
b. Iritis and uveitis
c. Sclerosing cholangitis
d. Skin symptoms: pyoderma gangrenosum
and erythema nodosum
e. No difference

767/1624

Answer e. No difference
The extraintestinal manifestations of both
forms of IBD are identical. CD affects the
large bowel in 40% of patients, and when
this happens, CD can give sclerosing
cholangitis. They can both give eye, skin,
joint, and liver abnormalities.

Sigmoidoscopy reveals an inflamed
mucosa consistent with IBD.
Orders:
Steroids IV
Iron studies, vitamin B12 level,
methylmalonic acid level
Mesalamine

Mesalamine

768/1624

• 5-ASA derivative
• Less adverse effects than sulfasalazine
Budesonide
• Oral steroid for IBD
• Extensive first-pass effect at liver
• Decreases systemic toxicity

Move the case forward 1 day. On the
second hospital day, the frequency of
diarrhea is reported as much decreased after the start of steroids and
mesalamine.
Iron studies: low iron, high ironbinding capacity
Vitamin B12 level low, methylmalonic
acid level high

769/1624

• Iron is absorbed in the duodenum.
• Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the terminal
ileum.

What is the greatest difference
between CD and UC?
a. Response to mesalamine
b. Fistulae
c. Response to steroids
Answer b. Fistulae
CD causes fistulae, perirectal disease, and
can affect any level in the bowel from mouth
to anus. All IBD is treated with the 5-ASA
medication mesalamine.

Transmural granuloma causes fistulae.

770/1624

Which is consistent with CD?
a. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody
(ANCA) positive, Anti-Saccharomyces
cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) negative
b. ANCA negative, ASCA antibody
positive
Answer b. ANCA negative, ASCA positive
It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish
between CD and UC especially when they
both involve the large bowel. UC is ANCA
positive/ASCA negative. The mechanism behind all of this is not clear.

By the third hospital day, the frequency of bowel movements and presence of blood is greatly decreased.
Transfer the patient home. Every time
you try to take the patient off steroids,
her diarrhea, pain, bleeding, and

771/1624

mucus recur. Mesalamine is not
enough to maintain them in remission.

Which therapy should you
choose?
a. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine
b. Methotrexate
c. Cyclophosphamide
d. Mycophenolate
Answer
a.
6-mercaptopurine

Azathioprine

or

These agents are immunosuppressive agents
that help wean a patient off steroids and prevent recurrence. Methotrexate is for rheumatoid arthritis, not IBD. Mycophenolate and
cyclophosphamide are useful in lupus nephritis, but not IBD.

772/1624

Perirectal Disease = Ciprofloxacin and
Metronidazole

Rising Alkaline Phosphatase = Sclerosing Cholangitis
Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) = Best Test
Treat with cholestyramine or ursodeoxycholic acid.

• Cholestyramine binds bile in the bowel
lumen.
• Ursodeoxycholic acid prevents bile
formation.

773/1624

Inflammatory bowel disease is a disorder that goes through intermittent
periods of relative activity and inactivity. Several years later, the patient develops abdominal pain and a
mass that is palpable. Despite
mesalamine and steroids, a fistula develops between the bowel and the skin
of the anterior abdominal wall.

What is the mechanism of the best
therapy?
a. Interleukin inhibition
b. Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
c. Anti-CD20 antibody
d. Phospholipase inhibition
Answer b. Inhibition of tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)

774/1624

The anti-TNF medications are best used to
close up fistulae in CD. Fistulae develop in
the skin, vagina, and between bowel loops.
Anti-TNF medications can reactivate tuberculosis (TB) and it is important to screen
with a purified protein derivative (PPD) or
interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) prior
to using them. You do not have to complete
all 9 months of therapy with isoniazid to
safely use the anti-TNF drugs. These drugs
are: infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab.

What is the mechanism whereby
TB is reactivated by anti-TNF
medications?
a. They directly stimulate the growth of
mycobacteria.
b. They suppress lymphocyte function.
c. TNF keeps granulomas intact.
d. No mechanism is known.

775/1624

Answer c. TNF keeps granulomas intact.
TB is contained by the immune system and
walled off in granulomas. TB can exist in a
nonreplicative dormant state for many years
inside a granuloma. TNF is the chemical signal the body uses to maintain the granuloma.
When TNF is inhibited, the granuloma “unlocks” and TB starts to replicate again.

Starting the anti-TNF medication
leads to resolution of the fistula over a
few days. The medication also has an
excellent effect on the primary disease,
and the frequency of blood and
diarrhea markedly improves.

Screening for Colon Cancer in IBD
Patients

776/1624

• Colonoscopy
• After 8 to 10 years of colon
involvement
• CD patients also if the colon is
involved

Features that do not change with disease activity:
• Sclerosing cholangitis
• Pyoderma gangrenosum

Move the clock forward 1 to 3 months
at a time. Continue mesalamine
chronically.
On CCS, it can be confusing if you
think you have done everything, but the

777/1624

case does not end. Remember to do
healthy maintenance such as vaccinations and tobacco cessation.

CASE 7: Celiac Disease
Setting: office
CC: “I’ve had diarrhea for months!”
VS: BP: 110/72 mm Hg; P: 76 beats/
minute; T: 98° F; R: 14 breaths/minute
HPI: A 28-year-old woman with persistent diarrhea over several months
visits you at your office. She has lost 15
lb in the last 6 months. She bruises easily and her menstrual periods are
heavy. Her stool has a “greasy” quality
and does not flush down the toilet easily
because it floats at the top of the water.

778/1624

The entire bathroom is abnormally
malodorous after bowel movements.
PMHX:
Iron deficiency ascribed to heavy
menstruation
Medications:
Ferrous sulfate
PE:
General: thin and tired
Abdomen: soft, nontender, normal
sized organs
Lung, Heart: normal
Skin: several bruises on legs
Initial Orders:
Stool culture, WBCs, ova/parasites
CBC
CHEM-20

779/1624

Even though an infection is very unlikely to persist for several months, you
must first exclude an infectious cause in
diarrhea before going to other tests such
as endoscopy. It is also very unlikely to
have a 15-lb weight loss from an infectious diarrhea.
Report:
Stool Culture, WBCs, Ova/Parasites:
negative
CBC: hematocrit 30%; MCV 85 fL;
WBCs 3,200/μL (low); platelets
118,000/μL (low)
RDW 25% (markedly elevated)
CHEM-20: albumin 4.5 g/dL; calcium
6.8 mg/dL (low)

780/1624

Some Iron-Deficient Cells + Some Vitamin B12-Deficient Cells = Dimorphic or
Two Distinct Cell Problems
Normal MCV + High RDW = Dimorphic Red Blood Cell
Population

What is the fastest way to
diagnose vitamin B12 deficiency?
a. Vitamin B12 level
b. Peripheral smear
c. Methylmalonic acid (MMA) level
d. Schilling test
e. Anti-intrinsic factor antibody
Answer b. Peripheral smear

781/1624

In vitamin B12 deficiency, the smear will
show hypersegmented neutrophils. Vitamin
B12 levels, if low, are very specific, but they
can be in the normal range in 20% to 30% of
those with vitamin B12 deficiency. MMA
levels are elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency
also. A Schilling test is never done—it is an
old test to determine the etiology of vitamin
B12 deficiency.

Normal average number of WBC lobes =
3.5

The Interval History shows the patient
continues to have diarrhea, has lost
another 2 lb of weight in the last 3
weeks, and continues to have “oily”
stool. The peripheral smears shows

782/1624

hypersegmented WBCs are present
with target and hypochromic cells.

What is the best initial test for the
presence of fat in stool?
a. Colonoscopy
b. Sudan black stain
c. Maltese cross
d. A 72-hour fecal fat
Answer b. Sudan black stain
Sudan black is a fat stain. A 72-hour fecal fat
is an antiquated test for fat malabsorption.
Maltese crosses are for detecting fat in urine.
Colonoscopy is not a good test for fat malabsorption. Fat is not absorbed in the colon.
Water and salt are absorbed in the colon.

783/1624

The colon absorbs no fat.

Reports:
Sudan black stain of stool: fat
globules
Vitamin B12 level: low
Stool heme: negative
Serum iron: low
Ferritin: low
Total iron-binding capacity: elevated
PT and aPTT: both prolonged

What is the mechanism of iron
deficiency?
a. Bleeding
b. Duodenal malabsorption
c. Gastric malabsorption

784/1624

d. Colon malabsorption
Answer b. Duodenal malabsorption
The duodenum is the site of absorption of all
divalent cations such as calcium, magnesium, and iron. The stomach does not absorb
iron. This patient has no blood in the stool,
so it is not bleeding. The reason the iron deficiency is not from menstruation is that the
MCV is normal, not low.

Divalent cations absorbed at duodenum:
• Calcium (Ca++)
• Iron (Fe++)
• Magnesium (Mg++)

Vitamin K malabsorption can cause
bruising.

785/1624

The patient returns in a week to discuss her laboratory results, which
show that she has fat malabsorption
with iron and vitamin B12 deficiency
as well as hypocalcemia

Low calcium etiology:
• Duodenal malabsorption
• Decreased fat-soluble vitamin absorption (vitamins A, D, E, and K)
• Decreased vitamin D

Low Vitamin D = Low Phosphate

Orders:

786/1624

Antitissue transglutaminase
Antiendomysial antibodies
Antigliadin antibodies

Which of these is safe to eat in this
disorder?
a. Wheat
b. Rice
c. Oats
d. Barley
e. Rye
Answer b. Rice
Foods safe in gluten-sensitive enteropathy
are rice, corn, soy, and potatoes. Flour based
on these foods are safe.

787/1624

All of the antibody tests (transglutaminase, endomysial, and gliadin) are
positive. You explain to the patient
that she has gluten-sensitive enteropathy or celiac disease. Iron deficiency
is caused by destruction of villi in the
duodenum. Calcium deficiency is
caused both by loss from duodenal absorption as well as loss of vitamin D
because of fat malabsorption. You advise the patient to remove all foods
with gluten from her diet, such as
wheat, rye, oats, and barley.

Vitamin B12 is lost because of terminal
ileum destruction.

788/1624

Coagulopathy and bruising are caused
by vitamin K malabsorption.

The Step 3 examination likes to ask
you “what will you tell the patient
about his or her prognosis?” They expect you to be able to communicate
appropriately with patients about
what will happen to them in the
future.
The patient asks what she can expect after removing gluten (wheat, rye,
oats, barley) from her diet.

789/1624

What do you tell her about the
future?
a. She will have instant symptom resolution
in 24 to 48 hours.
b. She will experience a gradual resolution of
symptoms and all malabsorption over a
few weeks.
c. She will have no change in symptoms, but
bruising and bone, iron, and vitamin B12
abnormalities will resolve.
d. She can restart eating gluten-containing
foods 6 to 12 months after abstention. It
will all resolve permanently.
Answer b. She will experience a gradual
resolution of symptoms and all malabsorption over a few weeks.
Celiac disease is based on circulating antibodies. It takes several weeks for them to resolve even after stopping exposure to gluten.
The disorder, however, is permanent. If she

790/1624

begins to eat gluten again, it will all recur.
There is no cure for celiac disease. Symptoms resolve with removing the gluten antigen over time, but the hypersensitivity will
recur with reexposure.

What is the basis of the
autoantibody?
a. IgA
b. IgG
c. IgM
d. IgE
Answer a. IgA
Most of the autoantibodies in celiac disease
are IgA autoantibodies. Antitissue transglutaminase, antiendomysial antibodies, and
antigliadin antibodies are all largely IgA
antibodies.

791/1624

Bone loss is from secondary hyperparathyroidism in celiac disease.

The patient stops all gluten-containing
food. On her return in 6 weeks, symptoms of diarrhea start to improve. The
consistency of her stool stops being
oily and floating. She gains 3 lb.
Orders:
Repeat antibody titers
Calcium level
CBC
Small bowel biopsy

792/1624

Antibody titers should improve with the
elimination of gluten from the diet.

Repeat titers improve as does the calcium level and hematocrit. The small
bowel biopsy must be done to exclude
bowel wall lymphoma. Repeat small
bowel biopsy is done after several
months to check for restoration of the
flattened villi.

CASE 8: Hemochromatosis
Setting: office
CC: “My joints hurt and my skin is turning dark.”

793/1624

VS: BP: 104/74 mm Hg; P: 76 beats/
minute
HPI: A 54-year-old man with progressive arthralgia of the lower extremities,
tiredness, and fatigue comes to the office
because his wife says his skin is darkening. She also brought him for his erectile
dysfunction.
PMHX:
Type 2 diabetes
ROS:
Dyspnea on exertion
Medications:
Metformin, repaglinide

794/1624

What is the mechanism of the
repaglinide?
a. Increased insulin release from the
pancreas
b. Peripheral insulin sensitization
c. Decreased gluconeogenesis
d. Increased levels of incretins (glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide [GIP], glucagonlike peptide [GLP])
Answer a. Increased insulin release from
the pancreas
Repaglinide and nateglinide are insulin
secretagogues that function in the same way
as sulfonylureas. They increase insulin release from the pancreas. They can, therefore,
cause hypoglycemia and weight gain.

PE:

795/1624

General: tired, dark skin clearly
obvious
Extremities: no joint swelling, no
deformity
Abdomen: enlarged spleen
Genitals: testicles small
Initial Orders:
CBC
Liver function tests
CHEM-20
Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
Testosterone level
Abnormal Reports:
Albumin 2.5 mg/dL (low)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
123 units/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 145 units/L (both three
times the upper limit of normal)
HbA1c 7.2%

796/1624

Free and total testosterone decreased

Which is the best initial test for to
give a specific diagnosis?
a. Liver biopsy
b. Iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC),
ferritin
c. Hemochromatosis (HFE) gene test
d. MRI
Answer b. Iron, TIBC, ferritin
Iron and ferritin levels are elevated. TIBC is
decreased. Hemochromatosis is a collection
of information that can be difficult to put together. There is no single physical finding
that is specific for the disorder. It is a collection of abnormalities that only in a pattern
suggest iron overload.
• Liver disease

797/1624

• Joint pain
• Hypogonadism
• Hypopituitarism
• Diabetes

The patient’s diabetes may be from undiagnosed hemochromatosis.

Joint pain in hemochromatosis is from
the calcium pyrophosphate deposition of
pseudogout.

The patient’s iron and ferritin levels
are elevated and the transferring saturation is over 80%. The patient refuses liver biopsy.

798/1624

Patients can refuse procedures on
CCS. A spontaneous note will pop up as
you move the clock forward saying “Patient declines procedure.”
Orders:
HFE gene
Liver MRI
The HFE gene test is abnormal and the
liver MRI shows markedly increased
iron.

What is the best initial therapy?
a. Phlebotomy
b. Deferoxamine
c. Deferasirox
d. Deferiprone
Answer a. Phlebotomy

799/1624

Phlebotomy is able to remove far more iron
than a chelating agent. The chelating agents
are used when someone receives frequent
transfusions and you cannot treat with phlebotomy. Deferoxamine is much harder to use
than deferasirox or deferiprone because it
must be given by subcutaneous injection.
Deferasirox and deferiprone are administered orally.

What is the site of the
fundamental defect that causes
hemochromatosis?
a. Duodenum
b. Liver
c. Heart
d. Pituitary
Answer a. Duodenum

800/1624

The genetic defect that leads to hemochromatosis causes the overabsorption of iron in
the duodenum. Normally, hepcidin is made
by the liver and stops iron absorption when
the body has what is required. In hemochromatosis, there is persistent iron absorption.
This leads to accumulation in the liver, heart,
pituitary, pancreas, joints, and skin.

Iron accumulation in the pituitary gland
decreases levels of luteinizing hormone
(LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH).

The patient is not enthusiastic about
repeated episodes of phlebotomy.

801/1624

What do you tell him the most
common cause of death is without
phlebotomy?
a. Cirrhosis
b. Liver cancer
c. Cardiac failure
d. Diabetes
Answer a. Cirrhosis
Liver disease kills more people than heart
failure in hemochromatosis. The causes of
death in patients with hemochromatosis are
as follows:
• Cirrhosis: 60%
• Hepatoma: 20%
• Cardiac failure: 15%

802/1624

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is the most
common heart disease associated with
hemochromatosis.

After telling the patient he will have
progressive cirrhotic death or liver
cancer without phlebotomy, he agrees
to the phlebotomy.

CASE 9: Pancreatitis
Setting: ED
CC: “My stomach hurts and I am
vomiting.”
VS: BP: 92/60 mm Hg; P: 124 beats/
minute; T: 101.5°F; R: 22 breaths/
minute

803/1624

HPI: A 45-year-old woman comes to
the ED with 2 days of abdominal pain
and 1 day of increasingly severe nausea
and vomiting. She has never had this
before. The pain makes it difficult for
her to find a comfortable position in the
bed and she is trying to hold herself still.
Vomiting has bile but no blood. Pain is
described as “sore,” “dull,” and very
severe.
PMHX: obesity; denies significant alcohol use
Medications: none
PE:
General: obese woman lying still,
uncomfortable
Abdomen: severe midepigastric tenderness; some guarding; not rigid
Initial Orders:

804/1624

Amylase, lipase
CBC
CHEM-20
NPO (nil per os or no eating)
IV NS: high volume
IV hydromorphone (Dilaudid)

• Pancreatitis causes fever.
• Most deaths from pancreatitis are from
inadequate fluid resuscitation.

Which cause of pancreatitis is
increasing in incidence the most?
a. Alcohol
b. Gallstones
c. Trauma
d. Drug induced
e. Cancer

805/1624

Answer b. Gallstones
The incidence of gallstones is markedly increasing. Gallstones leave the gallbladder
and get stuck in the ductal system at the
point where they can block the pancreatic
duct. Any stone, stricture, tumor, or obstruction can cause pancreatitis. Greater obesity
increases the incidence of gallstones.

Obesity = Cholesterol = Gallstones

IV fluids are started in high volume.
Pain medications are given and the
clock is moved forward to obtain the
laboratory test results.
On CCS, acute pancreatitis should
be treated as an assessment for possible

806/1624

ICU placement until you know that BP
and pulse rate are stable. Reexamine
the patient and repeat the vital signs in
30 minutes and again in 1 hour until
you know the patient is stable.

• Massive amounts of intravascular fluid
leaks into tissues.
• Inflammatory mediators in pancreatitis cause a massive capillary leak.

Repeat VS in 30 minutes: BP: 96/62 mm
Hg; P: 118 beats/minute; T: 101.5°F; R:
18 breaths/minute
Amylase 850 units/L (elevated)
Lipase 754 units/L (elevated)
CBC: WBC 15,500/μL

807/1624

CHEM-20: normal bilirubin; normal
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); normal AST

Pain can cause tachycardia and
hyperventilation.

Pancreatitis increases the WBC count
because of inflammation.

An abdominal US is performed to determine the etiology of the pancreatitis. You do not need to do a US to
prove there is pancreatitis. The presence of pain, nausea, vomiting, tenderness, and high amylase/lipase

808/1624

prove the presence of pancreatitis. The
sonogram is to detect stones in the
ducts and gallbladder.
Orders:
Abdominal US
Triglyceride level
Calcium
Oximeter

Pancreatitis causes hypoxia by capillary
leak in the lungs (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]).

Move the clock forward 4 hours.

809/1624

VS: BP: 100/70 mm Hg; P: 114 beats/
minute
Report:
Abdominal US: stones in gallbladder; dilated pancreatic duct, no
stone in duct
Triglyceride level: 445 mg/dL
Calcium: normal
Oximeter: 97% on room air

Triglycerides >1000 mg/dL cause
pancreatitis.

High calcium level causes pancreatitis.
Pancreatitis causes low calcium level.

810/1624

1. Dead Pancreas = Malabsorption of Fat
2. Fat in the bowel binds calcium in the
bowel.
3. Calcium bound in the bowel decreases
blood calcium.

What is the utility of a CT scan in
this patient?
a. Confirm the severity of the ductal
obstruction.
b. Look for pancreatic necrosis.
c. Confirm the diagnosis of infected necrotic
pancreatitis.
d. Determine the severity of disease.
Answer b. Look for pancreatic necrosis.
Pancreatic necrosis easily becomes infected.
You must give antibiotics such as imipenem

811/1624

or meropenem if there is necrosis before it
becomes infected. You are doing the CT scan
to see if there is >30% necrosis. If there is
>30%
necrosis,
give
imipenem
or
meropenem and do a CT-guided biopsy. If
there is necrosis that is already infected, the
pancreas must be surgically debrided.
No test can determine the severity of
pancreatitis disease in the first 48 hours of
presentation of acute pancreatitis. No radiologic test can tell that the pancreatitis is infected. Only a needle biopsy by CT guidance
can do that.
More than 30% Necrosis of Pancreas =
Antibiotics and Needle Biopsy Infected Necrotic Pancreatitis = Surgical
Debridement

812/1624

No radiologic test can determine
infection.

IV fluids and pain medication continue
for the patient. The abdominal CT
shows pancreatitis and gallstones in
the gallbladder. The CT does not show
necrosis of the pancreas and no stones
are seen in the ductal system. There is
currently no ductal dilation.
By the end of the second hospital
day, the patient’s BP is 110/74 mm Hg
and his pulse rate is 90 beats/minute.
Interval History:
Pain and nausea have improved
considerably.

813/1624

Which of the following is most
likely to benefit this patient?
a. NG tube placement
b. MRCP
c. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
d. Surgical evaluation for cholecystectomy
Answer d. Surgical
cholecystectomy

evaluation

for

Even though the ducts are not currently
dilated, the cause of pancreatitis in this patient is a stone that caused obstruction and
passed. You need to get the rest of the stones
out of there before another obstruction
occurs.
An NG tube is useless in acute pancreatitis. MRCP and ERCP are not needed if there
is no evidence of ductal dilation.

814/1624

The obstruction is assessed and treated.
After the acute episode of pancreatitis
has resolved and the gallbladder is removed, you should expect the case to
end.

CHAPTER 6

817/1624

NEPHROLOGY
CASE 1: Acute Kidney Injury,
Prerenal Azotemia
(Dehydration)
Setting: emergency department (ED)
CC: Tired, weak, and short of breath
VS: BP: 168/106 mm Hg; P: 89 beats/
minute; T: 97.8°F; R: 28 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 62-year-old woman comes to
the ED with 1 day of severe shortness of
breath and cough. She says “it came on
all of a sudden” when she was largely at
rest. She is extremely obese and does not

818/1624

move most of the time. She is adherent
to her medications most of the time.
PMHX:
Congestive heart failure (CHF)
Hypertension
Obesity
Medications:
Lisinopril, carvedilol, digoxin
On the computer-based case simulation
(CCS), dyspnea and serious blood pressure (BP) abnormalities are two of the
main problems that need treatment and
testing to be ordered before the physical
is done. For dyspnea, order oxygen, oximeter, and chest x-ray (sometimes arterial blood gas [ABG]). For symptomatic hypertension, order labetalol, enalaprilat, or nitroprusside intravenously (IV).

819/1624

PE:
General: morbidly obese; hard to
examine
Chest: incomplete examination because
of obesity, possible rales at bases
Extremities: edema; one leg more
swollen than the other
Cardiovascular: no murmurs heard;
no gallops
Initial Orders:
Chest x-ray
Oximeter
ABG
Oxygen
Basic metabolic panel (CHEM-7)
Electrocardiogram (ECG)

820/1624

1. Hypertension increases myocardial
work.
2. More work requires more oxygen
(O2) consumption.
3. More O2 consumption leads to more
ischemia.
4. More ischemia leads to a less mobile
heart.
5. A less mobile heart exacerbates CHF.

Which medication is missing
from this patient’s treatment that
would lower her risk of death
from CHF?
a. Spironolactone
b. Furosemide
c. Nifedipine

821/1624

d. Amiodarone
Answer a. Spironolactone
Although a diuretic is good to prevent fluid
overload, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists like spironolactone and eplerenone
are superior for lowering mortality. Calcium
channel blockers help to control BP, but do
nothing for mortality benefit in CHF.

Move the clock forward 15 minutes
and look at the Interval History: The
patient feels better with the oxygen,
but the diagnosis is not clear. There
are no clear rales, jugulovenous distention (JVD), or S3 gallop.
Report:
Chest x-ray: enlarged heart; no abnormalities, clear in lung fields; incomplete study from obesity

822/1624

Oximeter: 92%
ABG (on room air): pH 7.49; partial
pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2)
30 mm Hg; partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) 64 mm Hg
CHEM-7: blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
12 g/dL; creatinine 0.8 mg/dL
ECG: sinus tachycardia, right bundle
branch block
The patient does not improve.
Order:
Furosemide IV

What is the site of action of
furosemide?
a. Tip of loop of Henle
b. Thick ascending limb (TAL) of loop of
Henle

823/1624

+

+

c. Na /K -ATPase
d. Inhibition of aquaporins at loop of Henle
Answer b. Thick ascending limb (TAL) of
loop of Henle
Loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, and indapamide do not actually work at
the tip of the loop. They work at the TAL of
the loop (Figure 6-1). This is the site where
25% of sodium (Na) is absorbed at the nephron. Blocking absorption at the TAL cannot
be compensated for by sodium absorption at
the distal tubule. This is why loop diuretics
are so effective at removing fluid from the
body.

used in clinical medicine. (Reproduced with permission
from Fuster V, et al. Hurst’s The Heart, 13th ed. New York:
McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

Furosemide inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl–
pump in TAL.

825/1624

After two repeated doses and urine
production, the patient is still dyspneic. Prior to your receiving the patient, the ED attending ordered a computed tomography (CT) angiogram
with contrast. He was concerned
about a pulmonary embolus in light of
the dyspnea, incomplete examination,
and relatively normal chest x-ray.
Sudden Dyspnea + Clear Lungs =
Possible Pulmonary Embolus
You do not agree with the diagnosis of
pulmonary embolus and think this is
CHF.
Orders:
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
Addition furosemide

826/1624

The BNP is markedly elevated. After
another 30 minutes, the patient produces voluminous urine. Dyspnea improves. Furosemide is continued at
high doses by your postgraduate year
1 (PGY1) intern overnight after you go
home. The CT angiogram shows no
clot. The physical examination (PE) is
excluded.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is produced by atrial stretch in fluid overload.

Now that the dyspnea has improved,
move the clock forward to the second
\day.

827/1624

Orders:
Echocardiogram
CHEM-7
Troponin
Report:
Echocardiogram: decreased diastolic
function; increased left ventricle
(LV) thickness; 64% ejection fraction
Troponin: normal
Chemistry: BUN 28 g/dL; creatinine
1.8 mg/dL; potassium (K) 3.2 mEq/L

Loop diuretics inhibit absorption of potassium at TAL.

828/1624

LV hypertrophy is from hypertension.

Later in the day, the chemistries are
repeated.
BUN: 37 g/dL
Creatinine: 2.5 mg/dL

BUN-to-Creatinine Ratio
>20:1 = Prerenal Azotemia =
Decreased Perfusion
<15:1 = Intrarenal Acute Kidney Injury = Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)

829/1624

Which of the following laboratory
values suggest ATN?
a. Creatinine level rising 5 points in a day
b. Urine sodium >40 mEq/L
c. Urine osmolarity >500 mOsm/kg
d. Fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa)
<1%
e. Urine eosinophils
Answer b. Urine sodium >40 mEq/L
ATN is the death of kidney tubule cells.
Tubule cells normally absorb sodium. If they
are dead, sodium cannot be absorbed and
the urine sodium level rises. Nothing raises
creatinine 5 points a day. Even an anephric
person with zero renal function does not increase the creatinine by 5 points in a day.
High urine osmolarity is found in prerenal
azotemia. A dehydrated person increases water reabsorption from the kidneys. Urine

830/1624

eosinophils are found in allergic interstitial
nephritis.

Do not forget to move the patient out of
the ED after the initial set of laboratory
tests and treatments!

Contrast agents cause ATN. Look for:
• Urine sodium >40 mEq/L
• Urine osmolarity <350 mOsm/kg

The patient does not feel the rising creatinine. Her dyspnea has improved
with BP control to 118/70 mm Hg.
Repeat Laboratory Test Results:

831/1624

BUN: 48 g/dL
Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL
Urine sodium: 12 mEq/L
Urine osmolarity: 840 mOsm/kg
Serum bicarbonate (HCO3): 34
mEq/L (elevated)

Which of the following do you
expect in this patient?
a. Granular or muddy brown casts
b. Hansel stain positive
c. Urine specific gravity 1.001
d. Hyaline casts
e. Maltese crosses
Answer d. Hyaline casts
Hyaline casts are expected in prerenal
azotemia. They are accumulated Tamm-

832/1624

Horsfall protein, which solidifies into a hyaline cast when the person becomes “dry.” In
this patient, it is very important to make a
precise diagnosis. If it is overdiuresis, you
may need to give a small amount of IV fluids.
Granular or muddy brown casts occur in
ATN. They are dead tubular epithelial cells.
Hansel and Wright stains are used to detect
eosinophils in urine in allergic interstitial
nephritis. Urine specific gravity is low
(<1.010) in ATN. Dead tubule cells (ATN)
cannot reabsorb water, so the urine is dilute.
Maltese crosses are fat bodies in urine seen
in hyperlipidemia.

What is the mechanism of
elevated bicarbonate level in this
patient?
a. Prerenal azotemia increases bicarbonate
production at the distal tubule.

833/1624

b. Proximal tubule absorption of bicarbonate
is increased.
c. Acid excretion at the proximal tubule is
increased.
Answer a. Prerenal azotemia increases bicarbonate production at the distal tubule.
Volume contraction increases renin and angiotensin II. Increased angiotensin II
(ANGII) increases aldosterone production.
Aldosterone excretes acid in the distal tubule
and increases new bicarbonate production.
Decreased Body Volume = Metabolic
Alkalosis or Contraction Alkalosis

Tubules absorb sodium and water. Dead
tubules (ATN) result in:
• Dilute urine (<350 mOsm/kg)
• High sodium level (>40 mEq/L)

834/1624

Urine specific gravity approximates urine osmolarity.
• Specific Gravity 1.001 = Osmolarity
<100 mOsm/kg
• Specific Gravity 1.040 = Osmolarity
>500 mOsm/kg

Sodium Absorption in the Kidney.
• It is the greatest energy-using step in
the kidney.
• Sixty-seven percent is absorbed in the
proximal tubule.

What was the most likely etiology
of the patient’s dyspnea on
presentation?
a. Hypertension

835/1624

b. Renal injury
c. Fluid overload
Answer a. Hypertension
Hypertension was likely the etiology of the
shortness of breath in this person. Because
the BUN-to-creatinine ratio later became
clearly 20:1 with low urine sodium level and
high urine osmolarity, it becomes clear that
this is all prerenal azotemia from overdiuresis. At the beginning, it is often not clear.
Contrast agents are most dangerous in those
with decreased renal perfusion.

Stop medications and cancel tests on
CCS by double clicking on them. CCS
will always ask you to confirm
everything you do two to three times.

836/1624

Discontinue the diuretics and order IV
fluids. Repeat the chemistry levels 12
and 24 hours later to be sure the patient is going in the right direction.

Contrast may have contributed to
some kidney injury in this patient
in addition to prerenal azotemia.
What therapy reverses ATN?
a. Nothing
b. Bicarbonate
c. N-acetylcysteine
d. Low-dose dopamine
Answer a. Nothing
There is no therapy proven to reverse ATN.
It is like sunburn. You cannot reverse ATN,
you can only prevent it. Hydration, N-

837/1624

acetylcysteine, and bicarbonate all have
some effect in preventing contrast-induced
renal failure. They cannot reverse it once it
has occurred. Low-dose “renal” dopamine is
worthless. It is always a wrong answer.

Low-dose dopamine is useless for kidney
injury.

Prevent contrast-induced renal injury:
• Give 1 to 2 L hydration.

What should be changed in
chronic medications?
a. Continue spironolactone.
b. Stop digoxin.

838/1624

c. Add angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).
Answer b. Stop digoxin.
Digoxin and spironolactone have no benefit
in diastolic dysfunction. There is no point in
adding an ARB to an angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The patient needs
to have her BP controlled, which will avoid
decompensated CHF. Use beta-blockers,
ACE inhibitors, and possibly calcium channel blockers.
Repeat the chemistries to see that the
BUN and creatinine levels have both
started to decrease. Do it often so you
know when you can stop hydration.

CASE 2: Acute Renal Failure
(Rhabdomyolysis)

839/1624

Setting: ED
CC: “My muscles hurt and my urine is
dark.”
VS: BP: 112/70 mm Hg; P: 108 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R: 18 breaths/minute
HPI: A 27-year-old man arrives at the
ED by ambulance after undergoing the
physical fitness test for being a firefighter. He had to lift a 150-lb bag, run up a
flight of stairs while carrying it, and
proceed across a balance beam. He then
had to do 50 pushups and 50 sit-ups. At
the end, he developed dark urine and
diffuse muscle pain.
PMHX/Medications: none
PE:
General: weak, tired, and in pain
Heart, Lung, Abdomen: normal

840/1624

What would be the most likely
cause of death in this patient?
a. Dehydration
b. Renal failure
c. Hyperkalemia
d. Hyperphosphatemia
e. Hypocalcemia
Answer c. Hyperkalemia
The single most important fact about rhabdomyolysis is knowing that hyperkalemia
causes death when it is severe. Everything in
this list occurs, but the one that kills you is
hyperkalemia.

• High Potassium Level = ECG
• Ninety-five percent of potassium in the
body is intracellular.

841/1624

Rapidly Destroyed Cells =
Hyperkalemia

Initial Orders:
ECG
CHEM-7
Bolus IV saline
Urinalysis (UA)
Creatine phosphokinase (CPK)
Calcium
Phosphate
Rhabdomyolysis is a case where timing is essential. Exclude hyperkalemia
and cardiac toxicity immediately.
Order potassium level and ECG even
before the PE.

842/1624

Peaked T Waves = Give Calcium Chloride (or Gluconate)

Reports:
ECG: peaked T waves
CHEM-7: potassium 6.8 mEq/dL;
BUN 26 g/dL; creatinine 1.5 mg/dL
UA: dipstick + blood
Calcium level: 6.8 mg/dL (low)
Phosphate: elevated

Why do we give patients calcium
to protect the heart?
a. It drives calcium back into the cells.
b. It blocks norepinephrine release.
c. It raises the threshold for depolarization.

843/1624

d. It decreases conduction velocity in HisPurkinje tissue.
Answer c. It raises the threshold for
depolarization.
Calcium makes it harder for neural tissue to
depolarize. This is a good thing if the
myocardium might abnormally depolarize
and lead to arrhythmia. This is sometimes
referred to as “membrane stabilization.” To
depolarize, neural and muscle tissue must
become more positive until it hits a
“threshold” or trigger point to depolarize.
Resting or baseline membrane potential is
often at −70 to −90 mV. The cells must increase to −50 or −45 mV before the
threshold for depolarization is reached. Calcium raises the level so the threshold is more
“out of reach” and depolarization does not
occur.

High Calcium = Harder to Depolarize
Low Calcium = Easier to Depolarize

There is no maximum rate of calcium infusion. Calcium channels are closed at
baseline.

IV calcium is given and IV fluids are
running. Now you must give medication to lower the blood potassium
level.
Orders:
Insulin
Glucose
Repeat chemistry

845/1624

Urine myoglobin

Insulin drives potassium into cells by
stimulating Na+/K+-ATPase.

The type of fluids in rhabdomyolysis is
not clear. Use normal saline (NS) for
now.

Urine dipstick cannot distinguish
between
• Red blood cells (RBCs)
• Hemoglobin
• Myoglobin

846/1624

Move the clock forward 15 minutes.
Repeat potassium level: 6.2 mEq/L
Urine microscopic: no RBCs seen
CPK: 28,000 units/L

CPK levels are not dangerous until above
5000 to 10,000 units/L.

What causes hypocalcemia?
a. Decreased parathyroid hormone (PTH).
b. Binding by sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase
(SERCA).
c. Urinary loss.
d. Suppression of vitamin D.

847/1624

Answer b. Binding by sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA).
SERCA has calcium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) pumps that pull calcium into
storage. When muscles are damaged by
rhabdomyolysis, the exterior membrane becomes permeable to calcium in blood. The
muscle then binds up all the calcium by
pumping it into SERCA. Normally SERCA
only has contact with the interior of the
muscle cells. In rhabdomyolysis, the interior
now contacts blood calcium.

Damaged muscle binds calcium.

848/1624

Where in the hospital should this
patient be placed?
a. Place the patient in the intensive care unit
(ICU).
b. Keep the patient in ED for the first 24 to
48 hours.
c. Place the patient in the hospital ward.
d. Discharge the patient after his potassium
level is corrected.
Answer a. Place the patient in the intensive
care unit (ICU).
After initial administration of fluids and correcting the potassium level, you can move
the patient to the ICU. The indication for
ICU placement is hyperkalemia with ECG
changes. Patients can go to a regular hospital
ward just for hydration for rhabdomyolysis.
Renal insufficiency is not an indication for
ICU placement. Even in rhabdomyolysis, the

849/1624

creatinine level cannot rise more than 1 to 2
points a day.

What is the mechanism of
hyperphosphatemia?
a. Binding to muscle
b. Release from muscle
c. Renal insufficiency
d. Hyperparathyroidism
Answer b. Release from muscle
The majority of phosphate is in muscles and
inside cells. Destroyed cells and muscle release phosphate and potassium and bind
calcium.
Continue IV fluids at high volume to
“flush out” the kidneys. It is not clear if
bicarbonate or mannitol make a clear

850/1624

difference in outcomes. The proposed
mechanism of bicarbonate is that it
prevents precipitation of CPK and myoglobin in the kidney tubule. The idea of
mannitol is to decrease the duration of
contact of myoglobin with the kidney
tubule—like taking your hand off a hot
stove.
Move the clock forward 4 hours and
repeat the potassium and chemistry
levels.
Keep the patient in the ICU until the
potassium level is repeatedly normal
and the ECG is normal. Move the patient
to the floor. When on the floor, you do
not need to do the chemistry more often
than twice a day.
Move the clock forward until you
see:
No rise in creatinine level and no need
for dialysis

851/1624

CPK levels drop below 1000 units/L
At that point you can discharge the patient from the hospital if the case has
not ended already.
Do not be dismayed if many acute
cases give you the “this case will end in 5
minutes of real time” screen before you
can send the patient home. In those
cases, the emphasis is simply on initial
management.

CASE 3: Glomerulonephritis
(Immunoglobulin A)
Setting: office
CC: “I have blood in my urine.”
VS: BP:143/92 mm Hg; T: 98°F

852/1624

HPI: A 34-year-old man comes to your
office after noticing what he thinks is
blood in his urine off and on for the past
few months. The first time he had it, his
other physician gave him an antibiotic.
Now it has recurred. He has a sore
throat the day before each episode.
PMHx/Medications: none
PE: normal
Initial Order: UA

Hematuria Causes
• Stones
• Infection
• Glomerulonephritis
• Tumor (renal or bladder cancer)
• Trauma

853/1624

The UA can be done immediately.
There can be no meaningful discussion
about dark urine or blood in the urine
without the UA results.
Report:
RBCs 100 to 200
No white cells
No protein

Which is associated with
necrotizing granulomas?
a. Wegener granulomatosis
b. Churg-Strauss syndrome
c. Goodpasture syndrome
d. Microscopic polyangiitis
e. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)
Answer a. Wegener granulomatosis

854/1624

As the name Wegener granulomatosis implies, this disease is associated with granulomas. All of the listed disorders are systemic
diseases and Wegener granulomatosis is a
systemic vasculitis involving the skin, joints,
eyes, brain, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract
with special localization to the upper and
lower respiratory tract.
Upper and Lower Respiratory Tract + Cytoplasmic Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic
Antibody (cANCA) = Wegener = Steroids +
Cyclophosphamide

PAN is associated with chronic hepatitis
B and C.

855/1624

With just some hematuria, but no protein, there is no immediate therapy
needed. You can schedule the patient
to follow up with you in a month to see
if there is persistence and further evaluation is needed.

Which disease is associated with
linear deposits in the glomerulus
on biopsy?
a. Wegener granulomatosis
b. Churg-Strauss syndrome
c. Goodpasture syndrome
d. Microscopic polyangiitis
e. PAN
Answer c. Goodpasture syndrome

856/1624

Only Goodpasture syndrome has linear
deposits.
Lung + Kidney + Antibasement Membrane Antibodies = Goodpasture
Syndrome

A month later the patient has a recurrence of hematuria. There is no
pharyngitis this time.
Repeat UA:
RBCs 100 to 200
Dysmorphic RBCs
No protein

Which of the following has
“dysmorphic” RBCs?
a. Stones

857/1624

b. Infection
c. Glomerulonephritis
d. Tumor (renal or bladder cancer)
e. Trauma
Answer c. Glomerulonephritis
RBCs
can
become
misshapen
or
“dysmorphic” as they pass through an abnormal glomerulus in glomerulonephritis.
Nevertheless, any persistent or recurrent
hematuria needs evaluation with a culture
and ultrasound of the urinary system. You
must exclude stones and anatomic problems
with the urinary system with hematuria.

Orders:
Urine culture
Ultrasound of urinary system

858/1624

Polycystic kidney disease most commonly presents with recurrent
hematuria.
• Stones
• Recurrent pyelonephritis

Move the clock forward a week. Recurrent episodes of hematuria need
investigation.
Report:
Urine culture: no growth
Ultrasound: normal; no stones; no
hydronephrosis; no cysts

859/1624

Which is most likely to present
with recurrent abdominal pain
that is worse on eating?
a. Wegener granulomatosis
b. Churg-Strauss syndrome
c. Microscopic polyangiitis
d. PAN
Answer d. PAN
PAN is a systemic vasculitis that spares the
respiratory system. There is no single clear
feature because, like Wegener granulomatosis, it is a systemic vasculitis involving
the skin, joints, eyes, brain, and GI tract. Because of the presence of narrow vessels in
the arterial system of the bowel, pain related
to eating, or “intestinal angina” occurs. Look
for an abnormal GI angiogram or sural nerve
biopsy. Treat with steroids and cyclophosphamide
as
you
would

and

Churg-Strauss

Vasculitis + Asthma + Eosinophils =

The patient returns in a month. The
UA now shows (Figure 6-2) the
following:
RBCs 100 to 200
Dysmorphic RBCs
RBC casts
Mild proteinuria

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is
the most common glomerulonephritis.

What else besides the kidney is
routinely involved in IgA
nephropathy?
a. Nothing
b. GI tract
c. Joints

862/1624

d. Skin
e. Lung
Answer a. Nothing
IgA nephropathy is monosymptomatic to the
kidney alone. Henoch-Schönlein purpura involves the GI tract, joints, and skin. Oddly,
although Henoch-Schönlein has a more serious systemic presentation at first, it nearly
always resolves spontaneously and permanently in >95% of patients. It is IgA nephropathy that is much more dangerous. There is
chronic and recurrent kidney disease in 60%
to 70% of patients and a third will end up on
dialysis with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

A month later, the hematuria persists
in the patient’s urinalysis. The BUN
and creatinine levels are normal but

863/1624

start to slightly elevate after a few
months.

Which test can confirm IgA
nephropathy?
a. Renal biopsy only
b. Skin biopsy
c. GI biopsy
d. IgA level in blood
Answer a. Renal biopsy only
The difficulty of IgA nephropathy diagnosis
is that only the renal biopsy can establish a
diagnosis. Checking IgA levels in blood is
unreliable.

864/1624

See the patient at 1 month, 3 months
and 6 months. If hematuria persists or
the creatinine level stays elevated, order the kidney biopsy. Also order a
nephrology consultation.
On CCS, if a consultation is felt to
be needed prior to a procedure, the test
will tell you. Just order the procedure
you feel is necessary. Never wait for a
consultant to tell you to do anything, it
will not happen.

Which form of IgA-mediated
disease has treatment that will
reverse it?
a. IgA nephropathy
b. Celiac disease
c. Henoch-Schönlein purpura
d. None

865/1624

Answer d. None
Stopping gluten and wheat in the diet is not
the same as having a treatment that will reverse it. There is no therapy that will allow a
person with celiac disease to eat wheat. No
therapy reverses IgA-mediated disease. We
have steroids for IgG- and IgE-mediated
disease.

The renal biopsy shows IgA deposition
in the kidney and the diagnosis is confirmed. There is no definitive therapy
for IgA nephropathy. Over time, about
a third of patients progress and proteinuria worsens. When this happens,
order prednisone and ACE inhibitors.
There is a difference between the questions “What will you do?” and “What
treatment stops the disease?”

866/1624

There is no treatment that can stop IgA
nephropathy.
Use ACE inhibitors and steroids.

If the case allows, move the clock forward 1 to 2 years. If the creatinine level
starts to rise, refer the patient for renal
transplant screening. There is no cure
for IgA nephropathy. You have to
transplant the kidney.

CASE 4: Nephrotic Syndrome
(Membranous)
Setting: office
CC: “Why are my legs swollen?”

867/1624

VS: BP: 112/70 mm Hg; P: 92 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R:12 breaths/minute
HPI: A 34-year-old man comes to see
you at your office for swelling of both of
his legs developing slowly over several
months. He has seen another physician
who gave him a diuretic to decrease the
swelling, but there was no
improvement.
PMHX:
Hyperlipidemia for 3 years
Medications:
Simvastatin
ROS:
Several colds and sinus infections over
the past year
Anxiety about swelling
Denies pain, dyspnea

868/1624

PE:
General: emotionally distressed
Chest: clear to auscultation
Cardiovascular: no murmurs, no
gallops
Extremities: bilateral lower extremity
edema to the knees
Head, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat
(HEENT): mild periorbital edema
Initial Orders:
UA
Echocardiogram
Comprehensive metabolic panel
(CHEM-20)
Liver function tests
Lipid panel

869/1624

Periorbital edema is a main clue to low
albumin as etiology.

Move the clock forward just enough to
get the results. The patient is described
as visibly anxious and you need to discuss the results with him as soon as
possible.
Report:
Urinalysis: 4+ protein, oval fat
bodies
Echocardiogram: normal
CHEM-20: albumin 2.1 mg/dL
Liver function tests: normal
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 145
mg/dL; triglycerides 500 mg/dL
(elevated)

870/1624

What is the best way to tell
whether a patient’s albumin level
is low from liver disease or
another cause?
a. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
b. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
c. Prothrombin time (PT)
d. Liver sonogram
e. Alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyl transferase (GGTP)
Answer c. Prothrombin time (PT)
If the albumin level is low, but the PT is normal, the liver is definitely not the cause of
the low albumin level. It is impossible for the
liver to be synthetically normal enough to
make clotting factors but not normal enough
to make albumin. The liver does not selectively fail to produce one protein such as

871/1624

albumin, but still make other proteins such
as clotting factors. The AST and ALT can be
normal when the liver is nearly dead. You
have to have live cells to make transaminases. Dead livers do not shed AST/ALT.
Bald people do not shed hair.
A liver sonogram tells nothing about the
synthetic capacity of liver. Alkaline phosphatase and GGTP assess the biliary system.
Obstruction elevates the levels of both.

Binge drinking elevates GGTP first.

The world’s best test of liver synthetic
function is PT!

UA in hyperlipidemia

872/1624

• Oval fat bodies
• Maltese crosses

Nephrotic Syndrome =
• Hyperalbuminuria +
• Hypoalbuminemia +
• Edema +
• Hyperlipidemia

The patient is actually quite relieved to
hear the results of the tests. He feels
this explains why, as a young man, he
had hard-to-control hyperlipidemia.

873/1624

Edema = Low Oncotic Pressure + Increased Sodium Absorption

Why does this patient have
frequent respiratory infections?
a. The function of the neutrophils is
decreased.
b. IgG is lost in urine.
c. Antibodies are not made when the albumin level is low.
d. Lipids inactivate lymphocytes.
Answer b. IgG is lost in urine.
The precise etiology of infections in nephrotic syndrome is not entirely clear, but likely
reflects loss of immunoglobulins in urine.

874/1624

Keep BP under 130/80 mm Hg in nephrotic syndrome.

You tell the patient to increase the dose
of his statin medication and to return
to check his BP. Although nephrotic
syndrome is not a coronary artery disease equivalent, the lower the triglycerides and LDL are, the better it will
be for his nutritional status.
Orders:
Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio
Nephrology evaluation
Nutrition evaluation
Low sodium diet
ACE inhibitors

875/1624

Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio =
24-hour urine collection
• Ratio of 3:1 = 3 g/24 h excreted
• Ratio of 5:1 = 5 g/24 h excreted

Which of these medications
should you ask the patient about
having used?
a. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs)
b. Lamotrigine
c. Proton pump inhibitors
d. Quinolone
Answer a. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs)
NSAIDs have a clear association with the development
of
membranous

876/1624

glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome.
The other medications listed cause allergic
interstitial
nephritis,
not
nephrotic
syndrome.

Cancer, especially lymphoma, causes
nephrotic syndrome.

The patient comes back in 2 weeks.
The swelling is worse in one leg than
the other. Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound shows a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The patient is started on
enoxaparin and warfarin. His urine
protein-to-creatinine ratio is 7:1.

877/1624

Urine Protein-to-Creatinine Ratio >3.5
= Nephrotic Syndrome
>3.5 g of protein/24 h = Nephrotic
Syndrome

Renal function varies with posture.
Matching protein with creatinine corrects for the alteration in renal function
during the day.

What is the mechanism of DVT in
nephrotic syndrome?
a. Urine loss of clotting factors (II, VII, IX,
X).
b. Overproduction of clotting factors.

878/1624

c. Urine loss of protein C, S, and
antithrombin.
d. Low albumin level leading to stasis.
Answer c. Urine loss of protein C, S, and
antithrombin.
Together with all the protein lost as albumin
is also the loss of natural anticoagulants.
Nephrotic syndrome is a hypercoagulable
state. Protein C, protein S, and antithrombin
are lost in the same way that albumin is lost.
In addition, there is iron, zinc, and copper
deficiency because the carrier proteins for
these metals are lost as well.

Carrier protein loss leads to deficiency of
• Iron (transferrin)
• Copper (ceruloplasmin)
• Zinc

879/1624

The patient declines a kidney biopsy
that you order. The note says, “Patient
declines biopsy because he does not
understand what difference it will
make in therapy.”
Orders:
Antinuclear antibody (ANA), hepatitis B and C serology
human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic
autoantibody (ANCA)
Cryoglobulins

Chronic hepatitis causes vasculitis that
can involve the kidney.

880/1624

Hepatitis C causes cryoglobulins.
Treat with interferon, ribavirin, and
either telaprevir or boceprevir.
(Three drugs for hepatitis C)

In 2 weeks, the patient’s edema has
only worsened. All the results of the
tests ordered are normal. He agrees to
kidney biopsy.

The loss of high density lipoproteins in
the urine signals very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons to increase lipid levels. Lipoprotein signals
prompt the clearance of lipids from

881/1624

blood. Without lipoproteins, lipids build
up.

The renal biopsy shows membranous
glomerulonephropathy. The patient is
placed on prednisone orally and returns every month, but after 3 months
there is no improvement in urine protein excretion or serum albumin levels.

What should you add to therapy?
a. Add cyclophosphamide.
b. Add cyclosporine.
c. Add rituximab.
d. Add tacrolimus.
e. All are viable options.

882/1624

Answer e. All are viable options.
It is not precisely clear as to which therapy to
use. Although cyclophosphamide has been
used for a long time, there is also significant
risk of adverse effects.

Mechanism of Action
• Cyclosporine: calcineurin inhibition
inactivating T cells
• Tacrolimus: calcineurin inhibition
• Rituximab: anti-CD20 antibody

Over the next several months, the nephrotic syndrome improves. It is not possible to give a definite answer as to
which of these therapies is better than
the other. All have fairly good efficacy.

883/1624

Many cases of nephrotic syndrome
spontaneously resolve over time. ACE
inhibitors and lipid-lowering therapy
should be continued until that happens.

CASE 5: End-Stage Renal Failure and Dialysis
Setting: office
CC: “My kidneys are failing, do I need
dialysis?”
VS: BP: 152/92 mm Hg; P: 64 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R: 22 breaths/minute
HPI: A 67-year-old man with a history
of hypertension and diabetes who has
had renal insufficiency for several years
now comes to the office for evaluation of
his kidneys. The patient is obese and has

884/1624

had difficulty controlling both his diabetes and high BP. He is adherent to diet
and tries to exercise.
PMHX:
Hypertension for 12 years
Diabetes for 8 years
Tobacco in the past; quit 15 years ago
Medications:
Lisinopril
Nifedipine
Sitagliptin
Glyburide
PE:
General: tired, but comfortable
Extremities: edema present
Chest: basilar rales bilaterally
Cardiovascular: S4 gallop; no
murmurs

885/1624

Initial Orders:
CHEM-7
UA
Complete blood count (CBC)

Which is not an indication for
dialysis?
a. Fatigue
b. Hyperkalemia
c. Fluid overload
d. Encephalopathy
e. Metabolic acidosis
f. Pericarditis
Answer a. Fatigue
Everyone is fatigued or tired. This is too nonspecific a finding. All the others, potassium,
fluid, pericarditis, acidosis, and encephalopathy are definitely indications for

886/1624

immediate dialysis. Despite control of BP
and diabetes, many people have worsening
renal dysfunction that will need dialysis.
Your job is to detect who is having worsening
creatinine clearance (<30 mL/minute) and
will need dialysis before their condition gets
bad enough to have metabolic acidosis and
these other findings.

As usual, the patient returns in 1 to 2
weeks for evaluation of his laboratory
test results.
Reports:
CHEM-7: BUN 48 g/dL; creatinine 4
mg/dL; potassium 4.9 mEq/L; bicarbonate 19 mEq/L
UA: protein 2+
CBC: hematocrit 32%; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 85 fL

887/1624

Renal failure decreases erythropoietin
level, resulting in anemia (Figure 6-3).

888/1624

Figure 6-3. Regulation of red blood cell production by
erythropoietin. If the ability of blood to carry oxygen decreases because of a fall in numbers of red blood cells (e.g.,
normal cell death, pathological destruction of red blood
cells, bleeding, etc.), the kidney senses lower partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) levels and increases the levels of
erythropoietin (EPO). EPO then signals the bone marrow to
increase production of red blood cells. (Reproduced with
permission from Kibble JD, Halsey CR: The Big Picture:
Medical Physiology, 1st ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2009.)

Orders:
Vascular access placement (arteriovenous [AV] graft)
Phosphate level
Calcium level
Nephrology evaluation

Acid production: 1 mEq/kg per day

889/1624

There is no other way to excrete it than
through the kidneys.

What is the most common cause
of death with ESRD over time,
even on dialysis?
a. Infection
b. Coronary disease
c. Sodium disorder
Answer b. Coronary disease
Renal insufficiency greatly accelerates the
process of atherosclerosis.

The patient is seen by a vascular surgeon to place an AV graft. The patient

890/1624

is tired, but otherwise not significantly
different than usual.
Reports:
Calcium level low
Phosphate level high

The calcium level is low from decreased
levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D.
Replace calcium and vitamin D in renal
failure.

Hyperparathyroidism from low calcium
levels damages bone.

891/1624

Orders:
Oral vitamin D and calcium carbonate replacement
CBC
CHEM-7
Move the clock forward 4 to 6 weeks.
It takes this long to place an AV fistula
and to allow it time to epithelialize
and “mature” enough to be usable for
dialysis.
In ESRD, always get a chemistry
level every time you see a patient.
Nephrology is a laboratory specialty.
There is no significant physical finding
to follow.
Report:
Chemistry: BUN 54 g/dL; creatinine
4.5 mg/dL
CBC: hematocrit 29%

892/1624

Phosphate: elevated

Phosphate-lowering medications bind
phosphate in the bowel:
• Calcium carbonate
• Lanthanum
• Sevelamer

Lanthanum and sevelamer are “rare
earths” that bind phosphate in the
bowel without affecting calcium levels.
Once you get to the level of needing oral phosphate binders, patients definitely need dialysis. This is true even if
pericarditis, encephalopathy, dangerous hyperkalemia, or fluid overload

893/1624

have not yet occurred. Do not wait for
these dangerous developments on CCS.
Orders:
Phosphate binders
Calcium
Vitamin D
Dialysis
Erythropoietin

The only anemia of chronic disease
treated with dialysis is ESRD.

After 6 weeks, the graft of the AV fistula should be sufficiently mature to allow vascular access. You should expect
every patient on dialysis to be on:

894/1624

Calcium replacement
Vitamin D
Oral phosphate binder (calcium carbonate, sevelamer, lanthanum)
Erythropoietin
BP and lipid control
This treatment should continue
permanently.

CASE 6: Syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone
Setting: ED
CC: “My husband has been really
confused.”
VS: BP:112/76 mm Hg; P: 98 beats/
minute; T: 99°F; R: 22 breaths/minute

895/1624

HPI: A 58-year-old man with lung cancer diagnosed several weeks ago is admitted to the ED. He has been undergoing a staging evaluation and has not
started therapy. He is brought in by his
wife because he has been increasingly
confused over the past 2 days.
PMHX:
Tobacco smoking for 30 years, quit 5
years ago
Hypertension
Medications:
Amlodipine
If CCS describes “Acute mental status
changes of unclear etiology,” order
naloxone, dextrose, and thiamine first.
Acute confusion, like hypotension and
dyspnea, is a reason to initiate therapy
before PE.

896/1624

PE:
General: visibly agitated and confused
Neurological: lethargic, confused, only
able to state his name; examination
incomplete secondary to inability to
follow commands
Cardiovascular: normal
Abdomen: normal
Initial Orders:
CHEM-20
Oximeter
Calcium
Head CT

Which of these will not cause
confusion?
a. Hyponatremia
b. Hypernatremia

897/1624

c. Hyperkalemia
d. Hypercalcemia
e. Hypoxia
Answer c. Hyperkalemia
Potassium disorders do not cause altered
mental status. Potassium disorders lead to
cardiac conduction abnormalities by altering
the resting membrane potential. Altered
mental status and confusion are caused by:
• Any sodium or glucose disorder
• High calcium
• Hypoxia
• Anatomic abnormalities of the brain
• Intoxication
• Liver or renal failure
These are also the same things that cause
seizures.

898/1624

The worst form of confusion is a seizure!

Resting membrane potential is strongly
based on ungated potassium channels.

If a patient can speak, but does not know
his name, it is a psychiatric problem.

Advance the case the smallest amount
of time to get the first test results. On
CCS, you do not have to do anything
to get the reports of tests as long as
you advance the clock. There is no difference between the “On” and “In”

899/1624

types of time advance. If it is 9 a.m., it
is the same to say advance “IN 15
minutes” or “ON 9:15 a.m.”
Report:
CHEM-20: sodium 112 mEq/L; BUN
8 g/dL; creatinine 0.7 mg/dL
Oximeter: 97% on room air
Calcium: 9.2 mg/dL (normal)
Head CT: no metastases

Sodium kills with seizures.

Volume status is the key to diagnosing
sodium disorders.

900/1624

• High volume: CHF, cirrhotic,
nephrotic
• Low volume: diuretics, Addison
disease
• Normal: syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone
(SIADH), pseudohyponatremia, psychogenic polydipsia

Depolarization is based on the rapid influx of sodium.

PE:
Extremities: no edema, no
dehydration

901/1624

Neurological: lethargic, stuporous
You will never lose points on CCS by
examining a patient too much.
Orders:
3% hypertonic saline
Conivaptan IV
Repeat chemistry
Urine sodium, urine osmolarity
Uric acid level
Transfer patient to ICU

With hyponatremia, a healthy person
would make:
• Maximally dilute urine (lowest possible osmolarity)
• Minimum urine sodium (<10 mEq/L)

902/1624

Laboratory tests are always done first
(before other procedures) on CCS. If a
test (urine sodium) and a treatment (hypertonic saline) are ordered simultaneously, the test is always done first.

Low sodium level alters the depolarization of neural tissue.

What is the mechanism of
conivaptan?
a. It resets the hypothalamic osmostat.
b. It is a V1-receptor antagonist.
c. It is a V2-receptor antagonist.
d. It is a V2-receptor stimulant.

903/1624

e. It inhibits the posterior pituitary release of
antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
Answer c. It is a V2-receptor antagonist.
Conivaptan and tolvaptan are peripheral
V2-receptor antagonists. They inhibit the effect of ADH on the collecting duct. They inhibit permeability of the collecting duct so it
cannot reabsorb water.

Normal minimum urine osmolarity: 50
mOsm

The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is
the site of the minimum osmolarity of
urine.

904/1624

Move the clock forward 30 to 60
minutes and reexamine the neurologic
system and recheck the sodium level.
Report:
Urine sodium 64 mEq/L (high)
Urine osmolarity 480 mOsm/kg
Orders:
CHEM-7

Each aquaporin passes 1,000,000 water
molecules/second reabsorbing back into
the body.

905/1624

Conivaptan prevents placement of
aquaporins in the collecting duct.

Advance the clock 1 to 2 hours at a
time for the first 12 hours in severe hyponatremia. Severity in hyponatremia
is based on the symptoms, not the
number.
Severe Hyponatremia = Seizures,
Coma, or Profound Confusion
Report:
Sodium 114 mEq/L after 2 hours of
treatment
Uric acid level low (diluted by excess
free water)

906/1624

Increase sodium level by 6 to 12 points
over 12 hours in patients with severe
hyponatremia.

The sodium content of NS is 154
mEq/L, while this patient has a
sodium level of 112 or 114 mEq/L.
What will be the effect of giving
NS to this person?
a. Too rapid an increase in serum sodium
b. Too slow an increase in serum sodium
c. No effect
d. Decrease in serum sodium
Answer d. Decrease in serum sodium
NS drops serum sodium levels in SIADH.
This is one of the hardest things to understand about the disorder. It has to do with

907/1624

osmolarity. The osmolarity of NS is less than
the patient’s urine. NS osmolarity is 308
mOsm/kg (Na 154 mOsm/kg + chloride [Cl]
154 mOsm/kg). The urine osmolarity of this
patient is 480 mOsm/kg. This means that
NS is actually more dilute than the patient’s
urine. Although the sodium level of NS is
greater than that in the patient’s serum, the
patient’s urine is more dilute. Each liter of
NS will give net free water compared with
the patient’s urine, and the serum sodium
level will drop.
If you give a diuretic such as furosemide
with the NS, you will improve the patient’s
serum sodium level. This is because loop diuretics will decrease the urine osmolarity.

Never give NS alone in SIADH! It makes
it worse!

908/1624

Furosemide drops urine osmolarity so
net free water is lost.

After 4 hours, the serum sodium level
rises to 117 mEq/L. Symptoms start to
improve and the patient is less
confused.

What happens when the sodium
level is brought up too rapidly?
a. Monocular blindness
b. Central pontine demyelinization
c. Cerebral edema
d. Transverse myelitis
Answer b. Central pontine demyelinization

909/1624

Remember to keep the rate of the rise of the
sodium level slow. If a low sodium level is
brought up too fast, there is central pontine
myelinolysis, or osmotic demyelinization
syndrome. This syndrome is delayed several
days after the correction of the sodium. It
looks like a brainstem stroke with dysarthria,
dysphagia, diplopia, and mental status
changes.
Increase the sodium 12 to 18 points
over the first 24 to 48 hours. Once sodium is on the rise, there is no benefit to
elevating it rapidly. For the long term,
this patient has an uncorrectable cause
of SIADH with his lung cancer. The patient will need either demeclocycline or
tolvaptan to prevent a recurrence of
symptomatic hyponatremia.

910/1624

Demeclocycline and tolvaptan
• Inhibit ADH effect on the collecting
duct

CASE 7: Hypernatremia (Central Diabetes Insipidus)
Setting: hospital ward
CC: “I feel tired and confused.”
VS: BP: 102/72 mm Hg; P: 104 beats/
minute; R: 23 breaths/minute
HPI: A 27-year-old man came to the ED
yesterday after head trauma and loss of
consciousness from a motorcycle accident. The initial head CT was normal.
He was visibly intoxicated from alcohol
and it was unsafe to discharge him

911/1624

without reliable observation. After a
few hours, he improved, but now he is
confused again.
PMHX/Medications: none
PE:
Neurological: lethargic, confused, and
unable to name the date, the president,
or the place where he is right now; focal neurological signs cannot be assessed because of patient confusion
Heart, Lungs, Abdomen: normal

Except for reflexes, the neurological examination is based on the ability of the
patient to follow commands.

912/1624

You cannot assess papilledema with a
confused person. The head needs to be
still.

Initial Orders:
Head CT
CHEM-7
Oximeter
Liver function
Urine toxicology screen

Delirium tremens cannot start on the
same day as the last drink.

913/1624

Alcohol withdrawal is based on the stiffening of cell membrane, which is missing the “relaxing” effect of alcohol.

Report:
Head CT: no bleeding
CHEM-7: sodium 165 mEq/L (normal 135−145 mEq/L); BUN 45 g/dL;
creatinine 1.8 mg/dL
Oximeter: normal
Liver function: normal
Urine toxicology screen: no opiates;
cocaine and marijuana present

914/1624

Which of the following is most
likely to kill a person who is in
withdrawal?
a. Marijuana
b. Alcohol
c. Cocaine
d. Opiates
Answer b. Alcohol
Alcohol can kill a person who is intoxicated
or in withdrawal with neurological toxicity.
No one has ever died from marijuana intoxication or withdrawal. Marijuana is damaging to short-term memory. This is reversible after abstention for 1 month. This patient is confused because of dehydration.

Dehydration

915/1624

• High sodium level
• High BUN-to-creatinine ratio >20:1

Order dextrose 5% in water (D5W) as
soon as you know that the patient has
dehydration. NS will help as well, but
because there seems to be a free water
deficit, then give free water. The intake and output on the patient has not
been recorded. There is no way to assess how much urine he has been putting out over the past day.
Orders:
Bolus D5W and continuous
Repeat CHEM-7
UA
Urine sodium and urine osmolarity
Monitor input and output

916/1624

D5W acts as free water replacement.

One hundred percent free water would
cause hemolysis.
Dextrose prevents hemolysis.

What happens to the dextrose in
D5W?
a. It enters the RBC.
b. It is metabolized.
c. Nothing, it stays in circulation in plasma.
d. It is converted into protein.
Answer b. It is metabolized.
D5W is, essentially, pure free water replacement. You cannot give water alone as IV

917/1624

fluids because it would lead to hemolysis in
the veins through which it was being infused.
The point of the dextrose is to keep the fluid
from being so hypotonic or hyposmolar that
cells would swell and burst. The pancreas
senses the dextrose as sugar. Insulin will put
the excess sugar into storage as glycogen or
triglycerides (adipose), or the dextrose will
simply be consumed as fuel for cells. No
matter the metabolic pathway, to storage or
consumption, the dextrose goes away, and
only the water is left in the body.

Hypernatremia and Dehydration
• High Urine Output = Diabetes
Insipidus
• Low Urine Output = Dehydration

918/1624

Advance the clock 1 hour, then a
second hour, and assess the urine output and urine laboratory test values.
Nurses report two urinations over the
next 2 hours with 400 mL in each one.
Normal urine output is 0.5 to 1 mL/kg
per hour so this is voluminous, especially considering hypernatremia.
Reports:
Sodium: 167 mEq/L
UA: no white blood cells (WBCs);
specific gravity 1.002
Urine sodium: 12 mEq/L
Urine osmolarity: 80 mOsm/kg

Normally, where is the point of
maximum osmolarity of the
kidney?
a. Glomerular capsule

919/1624

b. The tip of the loop of Henle
c. The TAL of the loop of Henle
d. DCT
Answer b. The tip of the loop of Henle
Maximum osmolarity should be 1200
mOsm/kg and should be at the tip of the
loop of Henle. The ability of any species to
survive in hostile environments facing dehydration is based on how high the osmolarity can be made at the tip of the loop of
Henle.

Minimum concentration: distal tubule

Orders:
D5W bolus and continuous

920/1624

Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) IV

DDAVP can be given IV, by nasal spray,
or subcutaneously.

On CCS, if you order a test and a
treatment at the same time, the test is
done first. So to see the effect of the
DDAVP, you have to move the clock
forward and repeat the testing. If you
order both the urine osmolarity and
the vasopressin at the same time, it
will not reflect the effect of the drug.
CCS does not have delays in the administration of drugs or obtaining
tests and results as you would in real
life.

921/1624

Advance the clock 30 minutes. This
should be enough time to see an effect of
the DDAVP on the urine osmolarity, sodium, and volume. If the patient is
severely confused, transfer the patient
to the ICU.

After vasopressin administration,
which values are consistent with
central diabetes insipidus (CDI)?

Answer b. Urine osmolarity 700 mOsm/kg
(rises), urine sodium 60 mEq/L (rises), urine
volume drops.

922/1624

CDI will normalize in response to vasopressin administration, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) will not. You do not
have to see a maximal increase in urine osmolarity (1200 mOsm/kg) in response to
vasopressin. You just have to see a significant rise in urine osmolarity and a drop in urine volume. Patients with diabetes insipidus
(DI) urinate so much that a decrease in
volume in response to vasopressin should be
obvious within 1 to 2 hours.

Nephrogenic DI results from hypercalcemia and hypokalemia.

Orders:
Urine sodium
Urine osmolarity

923/1624

CHEM-7
Do frequent neurological examinations on patients with severe DI. Rapid
increases in serum sodium levels can
lead to markedly worsening mental
status and seizures.
Report:
Urine sodium: 48 mEq/L
Urine osmolarity: 550 mOsm/kg
CHEM-7: sodium 165 mEq/L

What mechanism is responsible
for the development of DI in this
patient?
a. Alcohol effect on the kidney
b. Trauma to the hypothalamus
c. Undiagnosed electrolyte disturbance

924/1624

d. Damage to the stalk of the pituitary gland
Answer d. Damage to the stalk of the pituitary gland
Head trauma most often produces a temporary CDI from damage to the pituitary stalk.
When the stalk alone is damaged, the hypothalamus is still producing ADH. To have
permanent CDI, there has to be loss of both
storage of ADH in the posterior pituitary as
well as the production of ADH. Electrolyte
(calcium, potassium) disturbance and alcohol cause nephrogenic DI, not central DI.

How much fluid is missing or
needs to be replaced in this
patient?
a. Two liters
b. Five liters

925/1624

c. Cannot be determined with present
information
Answer c. Cannot be determined with
present information
You must have the patient’s weight to know.
You must calculate the fluid deficit to know
how much water to give. You cannot determine how much fluid is missing without the
body weight.
• Men: 60% is water weight
• Women: 50% is water weight
This patient’s sodium is 165 mEq/L,
which is 25 points above the normal value of
140 mEq/L. There is about 20% of fluid
missing (18% to be absolutely precise). (A
man weighing 100 kg will have 60 L of water.
Sixty percent of 100 kg is 60 L, and 20% of
that is 12 L.) This person’s fluid deficit is 10
to 12 L, but you cannot determine that
without knowing the body weight.

926/1624

Move the clock forward; hydration
(D5W) and vasopressin continue to be
given.
Repeat CHEM-7: sodium 154
mEq/L

Do not lower the sodium more than 0.5
to 1 mEq/h or the patient will seize.

Why do seizures develop with a
rapid decrease in sodium level?
a. Hemolysis
b. Cerebral edema
c. Myelinolysis
d. Renal failure

927/1624

Answer b. Cerebral edema
When the plasma osmolarity is rapidly decreased, the cells of the brain are relatively
hypertonic, or hyperosmolar compared to
plasma. This will result in brain edema and
seizures. All sodium level changes (up or
down) must occur slowly.

A high sodium level in brain cells results
in osmotic draw into cells, causing
edema.

Correct the sodium level over 2 to 3
days. When the neurological examination normalizes, the patient can be
transferred out of the ICU. You cannot
tell if the CDI will be permanent until
you observe the patient over time.

928/1624

CASE 8: Hyperkalemia (Tumor
Lysis Syndrome)
Setting: hospital ward
CC: “I feel weak since my
chemotherapy.”
VS: BP:112/72 mm Hg; P: 88 beats/
minute; T: 100.2°F; R: 16 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 32-year-old woman admitted
for combination chemotherapy for nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is in the hospital the night after the administration
of the medications. She had IV fluids
started the morning of the chemotherapy. She received cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vincristine,
and prednisone. She is now feeling
severe muscle weakness.

929/1624

PMHX: stage IV lymphoma with widespread disease including bone marrow
Medications:

Allopurinol

Allopurinol
• Inhibits xanthine oxidase
• Inhibits production of uric acid

PE:
General: weak and tired
Neurological: normal, no focal

Allopurinol is a hypoxanthine analog.

Initial Orders:
CHEM-20
UA
Uric acid level

Continue allopurinol
ECG
Phosphate and magnesium levels

931/1624

Hydration and allopurinol are standard
before chemotherapy to prevent tumor
lysis syndrome.

Move the case forward the shortest
amount of time to get the potassium
level. The single most important thing
is to exclude a dangerous level of hyperkalemia and cardiac toxicity from
it.
Report:
Potassium 6.8 mEq/dL
UA: normal
Uric acid level: elevated
ECG: widening of QRS, flat T wave
Phosphate: elevated

932/1624

Hyperkalemia + ECG Changes = Calcium Chloride (or Gluconate) IV

• Calcium protects the heart from
hyperkalemia.
• Calcium raises the threshold at which
depolarization occurs.

What is the mechanism of a high
phosphate level?
a. Muscle breakdown
b. Release from lymphocytes
c. Binding with potassium
d. Renal failure
Answer a. Muscle breakdown

933/1624

Phosphate is released from intracellular storage. There is no direct effect of potassium on
phosphate. Although renal failure is associated with high phosphate level from the inability to excrete it, this could not happen in
just 1 day. Even if uric acid were to cause
renal failure, it would not become evident on
the same day.

• If the patient is allergic to allopurinol,
use febuxostat.
• Febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase
inhibitor.

Immediately after the hyperkalemia
and ECG abnormalities are discovered, the patient is given calcium
chloride, glucose, and insulin. Move

934/1624

the clock forward and recheck the potassium level. The potassium level
should start to improve within 30
minutes.

Insulin stimulates Na+/K+-ATPase to
drive potassium into cells.

How does hyperkalemia cause
muscle weakness?
a. It inhibits acetylcholine release at the
neuromuscular junction.
b. It prevents repolarization.
c. It interferes with the actin-myosin
interaction.
d. It blocks calcium release from SERCA.

935/1624

Answer b. It prevents repolarization.
Repolarization is based on potassium being
extruded from cells to lower the cell to a negative polarity. In other words, the positively
charged potassium ion (K+) has to leave the
cell so that it can go back to its resting membrane potential, which is −70 to −90. If the
blood level of potassium is markedly increased, the potassium cannot leave the cell.
In fact, potassium can go backwards into the
cell through the ungated potassium
channels.

Increased Blood K = K Cannot Leave
Cells
K Cannot Leave Cells = No
Repolarization
No Repolarization = No Depolarization

936/1624

All This = Muscle Becomes Weak and
Patient Dies of Arrhythmia

Several hours later, the potassium
level has been normalized and the
muscle weakness has resolved. Repeat
chemistry shows the creatinine level
rises from 0.8 to 1.5 mg/dL. Uric acid
is still up. Six hours later, despite fluids and allopurinol, the creatinine
goes to 1.7 mg/dL.

What is the mechanism of uric
acid’s damaging effect on the
kidney?
a. Tubular damage
b. Vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole

937/1624

+

+

c. Interference with TAL Na /K /2Cl
pumps

–

d. Vasa recta toxicity
e. Glomerular damage
Answer a. Tubular damage
Uric acid causes acute tubular necrosis. Uric
acid and oxalic acid are two forms of crystals
that both damage the kidney. You can see the
crystals on a urinalysis. You must lose more
than 50% of renal function before the creatinine will even begin to rise. When allopurinol damages the kidney, it is from allergic interstitial nephritis.

Diagnosing Etiology of Renal Failure
• Allopurinol: Hansel stain for
eosinophils
• Uric acid: urine crystals

938/1624

Report:
UA: no WBCs, uric acid crystals seen
Hansel stain (urine eosinophils):
negative
As hydration and allopurinol have not
been able to control the uric acid−induced renal failure, you add rasburicase. The following day, the uric acid
level normalizes. BUN and creatinine
levels come back down to normal 2
days later. Allopurinol and febuxostat
do not decrease uric acid levels once it
is formed. They only prevent
formation.

Rasburicase dissolves uric acid into
allantoin.

939/1624

Allantoin benignly goes out through the
kidneys.

Rasburicase “melts” uric acid. It is a
uricase!
Increasing urate oxidase!

Case Summary:
Tumor lysis syndrome is a known entity after chemotherapy, particularly
for lymphoma. Prevention with hydration and either rasburicase or allopurinol is standard. Rasburicase may be
better than allopurinol and that is the
lesson learned from this case. Elevations in potassium, phosphate, and uric

940/1624

acid levels are well known. There is no
clear benefit of routine urinary
alkalinization.

CASE 9: Renal Tubular
Acidosis
Setting: hospital ward
CC: “My head hurts and the light hurts

HPI: A 45-year-old man with acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is
admitted to the hospital for fever, headache, and stiff neck. The head CT was
done by the ED physician and was negative. Symptoms have been going on for

941/1624

5 to 10 days. He is not adherent to his
antiretroviral therapy. His CD4 count is
“around 50 [cells/mm3],” but he has not
seen a doctor for months.

CT before lumbar puncture (LP):
• Focal findings
• Papilledema
• Severe confusion
• Possibly in immunocompromised
persons

PMHX:

Oral thrush
Herpes simplex

942/1624

Medications: nonadherent
PE:

down on stretcher
HEENT: photophobia and nuchal rigidity are present; fully alert; no focal findings detected
Initial Orders:
LP
Serum cryptococcal antigen
CD4 level
Genotyping

Genotype = HIV viral sensitivity testing

943/1624

Advance the clock just enough to get
the results of the LP. Although the
most common cause of meningitis is
Cryptococcus, you want to get the LP
to quickly exclude bacterial
meningitis.

What is the fastest way to tell the difference between bacterial and fungal
meningitis?
• Cell count
• Thousands of Polymorphonuclear
Leukocytes (PMNLs) = Bacterial
Meningitis
• Ten to Hundreds of Lymphocytes =
Fungal, Viral, Rickettsia

944/1624

Report:
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): 117 ×
109/L WBCs, 94% lymphocytes
Opening pressure elevated
Gram stain negative
Protein elevated
Although this elevation of lymphocytes
does not prove a patient has Cryptococcus, in the context of HIV, treatment for Cryptococcus is best. Do not
wait for the results of cryptococcal antigen level.

The India ink capsule stain is 60% sensitive and an antiquated test.
Use the cryptococcal antigen test.

945/1624

The India ink capsule stain uses the
large, sugary glycocalyx around Cryptococcus to repel the ink.

What is the best initial therapy for
Cryptococcus?
a. Caspofungin
b. Fluconazole
c. Amphotericin
d. Itraconazole
Answer c. Amphotericin
Amphotericin, often combined with 5-flucytosine (5-FC) is the best therapy for
Cryptococcus. Caspofungin does not cover
Cryptococcus. Fluconazole does not have as
much efficacy and benefit in mortality as
amphotericin.

946/1624

Caspofungin inhibits 1,3-glucan linkage
in the fungal cell wall.
Cryptococcus does not have this bond.

Amphotericin inhibits ergosterol in the
fungal cell wall.

Amphotericin is started. The cryptococcal antigen comes back the next
day markedly elevated. CD4 is 18
cells/mm3 and the genotype shows a
fully sensitive virus. Antiretroviral
drugs are started. After 5 days on amphotericin, the chemistry test results
are:
Potassium 3.0 mEq/L (low)

947/1624

Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
Serum bicarbonate 18 mEq/L (normal 22−26 mEq/L)
Sodium 140 mEq/L
Chloride 112 mEq/L (elevated)

What causes this change in
laboratory results?
a. Sepsis
b. Lactic acidosis
c. Amphotericin effect on the distal tubule
d. 5-Flucytosine toxicity
Answer c. Amphotericin effect on the distal
tubule
Amphotericin use has a clear association
with distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The
anion gap is normal (Na+ 140 mEq/L) - (Cl–
112 mEq/L + HCO3– 18 mEq/L) = 10 mEq/L.

948/1624

Sepsis and lactic acid give an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis. The two most
common causes of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis are diarrhea and RTA.

RTA and Diarrhea
• High chloride level
• Normal anion gap

Which test can be used to
distinguish diarrhea and RTA as
the cause of normal anion gap
metabolic acidosis?
a. Serum bicarbonate level
b. Sodium level
c. Urine anion gap (UAG)
d. Response to antibiotics

949/1624

Answer c. Urine anion gap (UAG)
UAG = Na+ – Cl–
Na+ > Cl– = Positive UAG = RTA
Na+ < Cl– = Negative UAG = Diarrhea
UAG is based on the kidney excreting
acid or hydrogen ion (H+) bound to ammonium chloride or NH4Cl–. In diarrhea, this
mechanism works, because the kidney
works. In RTA, the kidney does not work, so
it cannot excrete acid.

The urine anion gap is the hardest thing
to understand in nephrology.

Report:

950/1624

Urine sodium level is greater than
urine chloride level
Repeat potassium: 3.0 mEq/L

Distal RTA on amphotericin is an expected event.
Everyone gets it after a few days.

Amphotericin inhibits the ability of the
distal tubule to excrete acid.

951/1624

Which of the following should be
found with amphotericin?

Answer b. Urine pH is high (>5.5), serum K
is low, and stones can form.
Distal RTA is a defect in the ability of the
kidney to excrete acid. This makes the urine
pH alkalotic (Figure 6-4). In an alkalotic (pH
> 5.5) urine, stones are more likely to form.
In most types of distal RTA, you can treat
with bicarbonate because the proximal tubule is where the bicarbonate is absorbed
and it still works. This is why distal RTA can
be treated with bicarbonate if you cannot reverse the cause.

952/1624

Medicine, 18th ed., Vol. 2. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2012.)

In proximal RTA (choice a) the urine pH
rises when bicarbonate is administered because the kidney is not able to absorb it. This
is why proximal RTA cannot be fully treated
with just giving bicarbonate. The patient will
not be able to absorb it. Because the urine

953/1624

ends up being acidotic (pH < 5.5) after all
the bicarbonate runs out of the body, stones
are not formed. Stones more often form in a
higher urine pH.
Replace potassium. Everyone on amphotericin for more than a few days develops a reversible distal RTA and will
need potassium replacement. After 7 to
10 days, you can safely switch the amphotericin to oral fluconazole, and the
RTA and increased creatinine should
all spontaneously resolve.

Distal RTA of amphotericin is self-limited after stopping it.
• Proximal RTA is treated with diuretics.
• Diuretics induce volume contraction
and increase aldosterone.

954/1624

• Increased aldosterone excretes acid at
the distal tubule.

has no symptoms.

958/1624

Cardiac Output × Peripheral Resistance = Blood Pressure

The amount of time between return
visits in hypertension evaluation is not
precise. You are safe at having the patient come back in 1 to 2 weeks.
Report:
BP 146/94 mm Hg
Cholesterol and LDL: normal

Besides screening for
hyperlipidemia, what other
screening tests are routine for this
person at age 49?
a. ECG
b. Colonoscopy

959/1624

c. Prostate specific antigen (PSA)
d. Chest x-ray
e. None
Answer e. None
Colonoscopy starts at age 50 in a person at
average risk with no family history of colon
cancer. PSA testing is not recommended: It
does not lower mortality and only increases
the morbidity of unnecessary procedures. A
screening chest x-ray is neither sensitive nor
specific for anyone, including smokers.
“Screening” means testing an asymptomatic population.

Which form of secondary
hypertension should you test the
patient for?
a. Pheochromocytoma

960/1624

b. Hyperaldosteronism (Conn syndrome)
c. Renal artery stenosis
d. None
Answer d. None
In the absence of specific symptoms, physical findings, or laboratory abnormalities, you
should not be routinely tested for any of
these.

Advise, educate, and counsel the patient on weight loss, exercise, sodium
restriction, and diet. Have him return
at 1 month intervals to assess compliance. Nutrition evaluation should occur for every patient with hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia. The
Step 3 examination will want you to
vigorously pursue lifestyle

961/1624

modifications and not pursue unnecessary laboratory evaluation.
For hypertension, no laboratory
test is “essential” in an asymptomatic
person with hypertension. Do not forget
to “Educate,” “Advise,” and “Counsel”
every patient.

Weight loss and exercise decrease BP by
decreasing peripheral resistance.

Move the clock forward at 1-month intervals for 3 to 6 months to assess the
efficacy of lifestyle modifications.
VS: BP 152/95 mm Hg

962/1624

Orders:
Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)

HCTZ
• Blocks sodium reabsorption at the
distal tubule
• Can block only 6% to 7% of sodium
• Increases calcium reabsorption

Advance the clock only 1 week after introducing new medications. This is to
check for both efficacy and adverse
effects.
Repeat BP: 150/92 mm Hg

963/1624

Only 60% to 70% of patients with hypertension have their BP level controlled
with one BP medication.

Without sufficient control, it is not
clear which BP medication should be
added as a second agent.
Orders:
Add an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker,
or calcium channel blocker.

Angiotensin normally
• Increases aldosterone
• Increases ADH
• Increases thirst

964/1624

• Increases sodium absorption at the
proximal tubule
• Vasoconstricts peripheral vessels

Move the clock forward 1 week. If a BP
medication works, it will be evident in
24 to 48 hours and the dose can be increased. If there is a “compelling indication” such as another disease, for example, diabetes (ACE, angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]), myocardial infarction (MI) (beta-blocker), or osteoporosis (HCTZ), always start with the
therapy that will also benefit the other
compelling indication.

965/1624

Beta stimulation normally
• Increases heart rate
• Increases stroke volume
• Increases renin release

ACE Inhibitor Cough
• From bradykinin increase

You do not have to investigate secondary hypertension unless BP is uncontrolled with the use of two to three medications. Once BP is brought under 140/
90 mm Hg, do not add further medications unless the patient is diabetic or
has end-organ damage. In those cases,

966/1624

continue to add medication until the BP
is <130/80 mm Hg.

Calcium Channel Blocker Adverse Effect
• Constipation
• Edema

CHAPTER 7

969/1624

PULMONARY
CASE 1: Asthma
Setting: emergency department (ED)
CC: “I can’t breathe.”
VS: BP: 124/76 mm Hg; P: 112 beats/
minute; T: 97°F; R: 32 breaths/minute
HPI: A 32-year-old man comes to the
ED with 1 day of severe shortness of
breath after several days of cough. He
has a long history of asthma, which is
usually mild. He has only been hospitalized once before several years ago. He
stopped using his inhalers 2 weeks ago
because he ran out of medications.

970/1624

PMHX:
Asthma
Allergies (ragweed, pollen)
Medications:
Albuterol intermittently
Fluticasone inhaler

What is the best way to tell how
severe the patient’s asthma
exacerbation is?
a. Pulmonary function test (PFT)
b. Respiratory rate
c. Wheezing on examination
d. Prolonged expiratory phase
e. Oximeter
Answer b. Respiratory rate
If the respiratory rate is low at 10 to 14
breaths/minute, it does not matter how

971/1624

much the patient says he feels short of
breath or if there is wheezing. You can have
wheezing but not be in severe distress. You
can have extremely severe asthma, and
wheezing can stop when all air movement
stops. An oximeter can show a normal saturation or one that is >90% to 92% with very
severe asthma. A person can be markedly hyperventilating to maintain a normal partial
pressure of oxygen (PO2) and oxygen
saturation.

Respiratory rate is the fastest way to tell
the degree of respiratory illness.

Effects of Hyperventilation
• Lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) by 4 mm Hg

972/1624

• Raise PO2 by 5 mm Hg

For every 4-point DEcrease in PCO2,
the PO2 should INcrease 5 points.

Acute asthma in the ED is a case when
orders should be done even before the
physical examination.

Orders:
Oxygen
Oximeter
Arterial blood gas (ABG)
Chest x-ray
Peak expiratory flow

973/1624

If tests and treatments are ordered at
the same time on the computer-based
case simulation (CCS), the test is always done first. If you order the oximeter and ABG at the same time as
oxygen, the test will not reflect the
treatment.
PE:
General: clear respiratory distress,
sitting on edge of bed trying to catch
his breath
Chest: bilateral wheezing, prolonged
expiratory phase
Abdomen: soft, nontender
Cardiovascular: no murmurs, no
gallops

974/1624

What part of pulmonary function
testing would wheezing
correspond to?
a. Increased total lung capacity (TLC)
b. Increased residual volume (RV)
c. Decreased forced vital capacity (FVC)
d. Decreased forced expiratory volume at 1
second (FEV1)
e. Decreased expiratory reserve volume
Answer d. Decreased forced expiratory
volume at 1 second (FEV1)
Wheezing is entirely an expiratory problem
in which there is an abnormal narrowing of
the airway decreasing the FEV1. Wheezing is
an audible decrease in FEV1.

975/1624

As soon as wheezing is detected on examination, inhaled or nebulized albuterol should be ordered. There is no
contraindication to inhaled albuterol
in anyone. In addition, glucocorticoids
should be ordered as soon as possible
because there is a delay of 4 to 6 hours
in seeing a clinical effect of steroids.
Orders:
Albuterol nebulizer
Methylprednisolone intravenously
(IV)

Albuterol is a beta-2-agonist.

Reports:

976/1624

Oximeter: 94% saturation
ABG: pH 7.52; PCO2 24 mm Hg; PO2
70 mm Hg
Chest x-ray: no infiltrates, no
pneumothorax
Peak expiratory flow: 150 L/second

WARNING! Next part is hard! Numbers ahead!

If a healthy person were to
hyperventilate himself to a PCO2
of 24 mm Hg, what should the
expected PO2 be?
a. 70 mm Hg
b. 80 mm Hg
c. 100 mm Hg
d. 120 mm Hg

977/1624

e. 150 mm Hg
Answer d. 120 mm Hg
Because the PO2 should go up if the PCO2
goes down, a 16-point decrease in PCO2
should result in a 20-point increase in PO2.
This is the “alveolar gas equation.”
1. Atmospheric pressure 760 mm Hg minus
47 mm Hg for water = 713 mm Hg
2. 21% of this 713 is oxygen = 150
3. Inhaled alveolar air: PO2 150
4. 150 – PCO2/0.8 = expected PO2
5. 24/0.8 = 30
6. 150 – 30 = 120

Hyperventilation should raise the PO2 in
a healthy person.

978/1624

Which part of the PFTs does peak
flow most closely correspond to?
a. FVC
b. FEV1
c. Residual volume
Answer b. FEV1
Peak flow is the maximum rate of exhalation.
FEV1 is a volume of air to move in 1 second,
but the peak flow is the maximum rate. FEV1
is similar to the distance you must drive.
Peak flow is similar to the maximum speed
of the car.

There is no maximum dose of albuterol
inhaler.

979/1624

Move the clock forward 15 minutes.
Order:
Interval History
Vital signs (to recheck respiratory
rate)
Albuterol nebulizer

Decreasing PCO2 raises pH.
PCO2 down 10 mm Hg = pH up 0.08

Report:
The patient is still very dyspneic and
has difficulty speaking in complete
sentences.

980/1624

The patient’s respiratory rate is 30
breaths/minute.

Which of the following will work
as an acute rescue medication in
asthma exacerbation?
a. Theophylline
b. Cromolyn
c. Ipratropium
d. Omalizumab
e. Montelukast
Answer c. Ipratropium
Ipratropium and tiotropium have some effect in asthma. They are quaternary amine
anticholinergic agents. They inhibit acetylcholine effect and act locally in the lungs
because they are not absorbed. The other

981/1624

medications are third-line drugs in the
chronic maintenance of preventing asthma
exacerbation. None of them works in acute
circumstances. Theophylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (Figure 7-1).

982/1624

participation of several interacting inflammatory cells,
which result in acute and chronic inflammatory effects on
the airway. (Reproduced with permission from Longo DL, et
al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th ed., Vol.
2. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2012.)

983/1624

Omalizumab:
• Monoclonal antibody
• Inhibits immunoglobulin E (IgE)

Ipratropium Mechanism:
• Dilates bronchial smooth muscle
• Decreases secretions of bronchial
glands

Cromolyn Mechanism:
• Prevents mast cell degranulation
• Prevents release of histamine

Montelukast Mechanism:

984/1624

• Leukotriene receptor antagonist
• Decreases bronchospasm
• Does not work acutely

Move the clock forward and reexamine the patient.
Orders:
Albuterol nebulizer
Ipratropium nebulizer
Continue steroids
Magnesium IV

Magnesium has a mild relaxing effect on
bronchial smooth muscle.

985/1624

As you move the clock forward, use
15- to 30-minute intervals. This patient has now received multiple doses
of albuterol, ipratropium, magnesium,
and steroids. There is nothing more in
terms of medications that can be done.
Epinephrine adds nothing to albuterol. There is no greater efficacy of epinephrine compared to albuterol, but
considerably more adverse effects
particularly in those with a history of
heart disease.
Orders:
Repeat ABG: pH 7.34; PCO2 46 mm
Hg
Transfer the patient to the intensive
care unit (ICU) and consider intubating the patient because of the increased PCO2 respiratory acidosis.

986/1624

When asthmatics become tired, respiratory failure can happen very
suddenly.

Any respiratory acidosis in asthma is
life-threatening.

With severe asthma, your patient may
or may not be described as needing
ICU care. The key issue for you is to
know that even a slight respiratory
acidosis or slight increase in PCO2 is an
indication for ICU transfer. If there is
no respiratory failure, put the patient
on the regular hospital ward until the
respiratory rate normalizes to less

987/1624

than 20 breaths/minute and dyspnea
decreases. If the patient is described as
needing ICU and ventilator management, you can expect the stay to be
brief, such as 1 to 2 days, and then the
patient will go back to the floor.
After moving the clock forward and seeing the symptoms
improve, switch steroids to oral
prednisone. Once stable on oral medication and inhaled steroids and albuterol, the patient can be safely transferred home.

CASE 2: Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease
Setting: office

988/1624

CC: “I get short of breath when I walk
up a flight of stairs.”
VS: BP: 110/70 mm Hg; P: 64 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R:12 breaths/minute
HPI: A 75-year-old long-term male
smoker comes to the office with increasing dyspnea when walking, especially
upstairs. The patient had been a smoker
of one pack/day for 50 years. He quit 2
years ago. This is the first time he has
had a decrease in exercise tolerance as
he could walk two to three blocks before
becoming short of breath.
ROS:
No cough, no sputum, no fever
No weight loss
PMHX:
Diabetes: well controlled
Medications:

989/1624

Metformin, glyburide
PE:
Chest: no wheezing, no rales, no
rhonchi
Cardiovascular: no murmurs
Extremities: some clubbing, no edema
Initial Orders:
Oximeter
Chest x-ray
PFTs

There are no unique physical findings in
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD).
At very late stages of the disease, patients can develop a barrel chest.

990/1624

What is the physiologic basis of a
barrel chest?
a. Increased fibrosis of lungs
b. Increased residual volume
c. Decreased compliance
d. Decreased FEV1
Answer b. Increased residual volume
As air becomes trapped in the lungs, the diaphragm flattens and the chest enlarges.
These increased volumes are all residual
volume, or the part of the air that cannot be
exhaled. This is all a sign of increased total
lung capacity, but not usable lung. The usable part of lung volume, the FEV1 and FVC,
both diminish (Figure 7-2).

991/1624

Figure 7-2. Cellular mechanisms in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. Cigarette smoke and other irritants activate epithelial cells and macrophages in the lung to release
mediators that attract circulating inflammatory cells, including monocytes (which differentiate to macrophages
within the lung), neutrophils, and T lymphocytes (T helper
[TH1] and TC1 cells). Fibrogenic factors released from epithelial cells and macrophages lead to fibrosis of small

992/1624

airways. Release of proteases results in alveolar wall destruction (emphysema) and mucus hypersecretion (chronic
bronchitis). (Reproduced with permission from Brunton LL,
et al. Goodman & Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of
Therapeutics, 12th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

FEV1/FVC Down + Residual Volume
Up = COPD

Report:
Oximeter: 94% room air saturation
Chest x-ray: clear lung fields, hyperaeration, some flattening of
diaphragm

Which of these becomes abnormal
first in COPD?
a. TLC
b. FEV1

993/1624

c. Forced expiratory flow 25% to 75%
(FEF25–75%) or peak mid-maximal flow
d. Forced vital capacity (FVC)
Answer c. Forced expiratory flow 25% to
75% (FEF25–75%) or peak mid-maximal
flow
The FEF25–75% will become abnormal first
in COPD. This is the middle part of the
breath. FEF25–75% decrease will precede a
decrease in the FEV1.

FEF25–75% indicates a small airway.
Small airways collapse first.

As radius decreases, the pressure of
collapse increases.

994/1624

Law of Laplace
P = T/R
Where P is pressure, T is wall tension,
and R is radius

Move the clock forward 1 week. The
patient still reports decreased exercise
tolerance. The patient’s PFTs show:
Decrease in FEF25–75%
FEV1 65% of predicted
FVC 80% of predicted

What is the best therapy to use
first?
a. Tiotropium
b. Terbutaline

995/1624

c. Inhaled fluticasone (steroid)
d. Theophylline
Answer a. Tiotropium
Tiotropium and ipratropium are the best initial inhalers for COPD. It is not clear whether
albuterol should be used first as well. The
other answers are clearly wrong. Terbutaline
is a beta-2-specific agonist with very little efficacy. Theophylline is an add-on drug as
fourth or fifth line to try to keep patients off
oral steroids.

Terbutaline is a beta-2-specific agonist.

Tiotropium
• Antimuscarinic drug

996/1624

• Dilates bronchi
• Decreases secretions

You advance the clock 1 week. The patient reports dry mouth and constipation. Tiotropium inhibits the muscarinic receptors in the
Bowel (constipation)
Bladder (urinary retention)
Eye (worsens glaucoma by dilating
the pupil)
Salivary glands (dry mouth)

The neuromuscular junction has nicotinic receptors for acetylcholine.

997/1624

It is not affected by tiotropium.

Stop the tiotropium. However, not all
patients with COPD will respond to albuterol. Only half have asthma-like
“reactive airways” disease. Do PFTs
before and after the use of albuterol
and see if there is an improvement.

Pre- and post-bronchodilation PFTs
• Do FEV1 before and after albuterol
administration.
• If there is a 12% increase in FEV1, it indicates reversible airway disease.

998/1624

There is a 20% rise in FEV1 with albuterol. You start the medication and
advance the clock. The patient is still
not controlled and you add an inhaled
steroid to therapy.

Inhaled steroids are all identical in
efficacy
• Fluticasone
• Beclomethasone
• Triamcinolone

The patient returns in 1 week much
improved with greater exercise tolerance. He is then lost to follow-up for a
year during which time he does not

999/1624

return. The next time you see the patient he is much more short of breath
with dyspnea starting at half-a-block
exertion.

In severe COPD, which of these is
most likely to be found on this
patient’s PFTs?

Answer b. FEV1 and FVC both down
With severe COPD, FEV1 and FVC go down,
but FEV1 decreases even more. TLC goes up,

1000/1624

but it is not useful. It is all unusable residual
volume.

COPD is from the loss of elastin fibers
(Figure 7-3).

Basic metabolic panel (CHEM-7)
Complete blood count (CBC)

Which of the following is a feature
of this patient’s disorder?
a. Decreased lung compliance
b. Increased lung compliance
c. Hypersensitivity of central
chemoreceptors
Answer b. Increased lung compliance

1002/1624

COPD is an increase in lung compliance. Patients can inhale, but cannot exhale. This is
why they retain carbon dioxide (CO2). They
cannot move the air. There is an insensitivity
of central chemoreceptors to CO2 and acid.
This is part of why there is a blunted respiratory drive.

Three drives for respiration
• Increased CO2
• Acid (hydrogen ion)
• Decreased PO2

Because of shortness of breath, have
the patient return in just 1 to 2 days to
see if there is improvement. He is
somewhat improved, but exercise

1003/1624

intolerance makes it impossible for
him to walk the two flights of stairs in
his own house.
ABG Report: pH 7.37; PCO2 60 mm
Hg; PO2 59 mm Hg; saturation 89%

Central chemoreceptors are stronger
than peripheral chemoreceptors.
• Central CO2 and acid
• Peripheral oxygen

Report:
CBC: hematocrit (Hct) 55%; mean
corpuscular volume (MCV) 78 fL

1004/1624

CHEM-7: bicarbonate 36 mEq/L
(elevated)
Chronic Hypoxia = Increased
Erythropoietin = High Hematocrit
(Polycythemia)

Polycythemia from hypoxia gives small
cells (low MCV).

The patient meets criteria for chronic
home oxygen. Low-flow oxygen (1–2
L/minute) lowers mortality. Low-flow
oxygen in hypoxic COPD lowers mortality. Criteria for home oxygen use
are:

1005/1624

PO2 <55 mm Hg or saturation <88%
PO2 <60 mm Hg or saturation <90%
with polycythemia or pulmonary
hypertension

Peripheral chemoreceptors for oxygen
Detect PO2 <60 mm Hg

The patient is started on oxygen and
continued on tiotropium, albuterol, and
inhaled steroids. Bicarbonate level is elevated in the kidney by carbonic anhydrase in response to the chronic elevation of PCO2.
When CCS says, “Case will end in 5
minutes of real time,” it does not mean

1006/1624

you made a mistake. It does give you an
opportunity to do any health maintenance you may have forgotten.
Final Orders:
Flu vaccine yearly
Pneumococcal vaccination for anyone
with COPD
Chronic Respiratory Acidosis =
Metabolic Alkalosis

Oxygen prevents fatal pulmonary
hypertension.

CASE 3: Pneumonia

1007/1624

Setting: ED
CC: “Cough, shortness of breath, and
chest pain”
VS: BP: 108/72 mm Hg; P: 112 beats/
minute; T: 102.8°F; R: 26 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 68-year-old man with several
days of increasing cough, discolored
sputum production, and chest pain arrives at the ED. The pain is sharp, right
sided, and worsens when he takes a
deep breath. He has had a fever of
102°F at home. The dyspnea markedly
worsened today, and that is what made
him come to the hospital.
PMHX:
Tobacco smoking in past; quit 15 years
ago
Medications:

1008/1624

Vitamins
On CCS, for dyspnea, order oxygen, oximeter, and chest x-ray.

For routine fever evaluation, how
much testing should you order
just because of the presence of a
fever?
a. Chest x-ray
b. Chest x-ray, urinalysis (UA)
c. Chest x-ray, UA, blood culture
d. Chest x-ray, UA, blood culture, stool
culture
e. Chest x-ray, UA, blood culture, stool culture, urine culture
Answer c. Chest x-ray, urinalysis (UA),
blood culture

1009/1624

These are the tests of fever evaluation just
for a person with no other localizing symptoms. You can order this on CCS for any
fever.
Initial Orders:
Oximeter, chest x-ray, oxygen
Blood cultures, UA
PE:
General: fatigued, tired
Chest: right-sided crackles in lung field
Abdomen: nontender, no
organomegaly
Cardiovascular: no murmurs, no
gallops

Which of the following is the
greatest determinant of the need
for hospital admission?
a. Hypoxia and hypotension

1010/1624

b. Number of lobes involved
c. Age and medication use
d. Organism type and previous intubation
e. Number of previous episodes of
pneumonia
Answer a. Hypoxia and hypotension
Admission to the hospital is based on the
severity of the disease. The severity of pneumonia is based on the presence of hypoxia,
hypotension, altered mental status, and renal failure.
All the other features, such as age, the
number of previous illnesses, and the number of lobes involved, are important, but not
nearly so important as hypoxia and hypotension. If you have only one lobe involved in a
young person, but the patient is hypotensive
(systolic blood pressure [SBP] <90 mm Hg)
or hypoxic, then the young patient needs to
be admitted.

1011/1624

Mycoplasma pneumonia involves five
lobes, but it is mild and does not cause hypoxia or hypotension. The same is true of Chlamydia pneumonia. So admission is not
based on etiology, it is based on the severity.

Move the clock forward to the minute
you need to get the results of the
oximeter.
Because you ordered the oxygen
and oximeter at the same time, the oximeter reading will not reflect the oxygen administration. Tests ordered at
the same time as treatments do not reflect the treatments.
Results:
Oximeter: 91% saturation on room
air

1012/1624

Saturation <92% = PO2 at least <70 mm
Hg = Severe pneumonia

Pneumococcus
• Most common community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP)
• Environmental source or reservoir
unknown

You can repeat the oximeter reading
now that the patient is on oxygen. It
will reflect the use of oxygen now that
you have moved the clock forward.
In pneumonia, it is key to
Assess oxygenation and blood pressure (BP) immediately.

1013/1624

Get x-ray results and start antibiotics
within 30 minutes of the patient’s arrival in the ED.
Advance the clock 10 to 20 minutes to
get x-ray results.
Orders:
ABG

ABG helps answer the question, “Ward
or ICU?”

Hypotension + Severe Hypoxia (PO2
<60 mm Hg) = ICU

1014/1624

Report:
Chest x-ray: right middle and right
lower lobe infiltrates; effusion on
right
UA: no white blood cells (WBCs), no
protein
ABG: pH 7.46; PCO2 34 mm Hg; PO2
65 mm Hg

Hyperventilation should mean respiratory alkalosis.
PCO2 down 10 mm Hg = pH up 0.08

What test should you use first to
detect pleural effusion?
a. x-ray

1015/1624

b. Computed tomography (CT)
c. Ultrasound
d. Thoracentesis
Answer a. X-ray
All detect a pleural effusion. Start with the xray.

Decubitus x-ray detects pleural effusion.
Effusions Move = Layer Out

Orders:
Ceftriaxone IV
Azithromycin IV
Decubitus x-ray
Transfer patient to hospital floor

1016/1624

What difference does it make if
there is an effusion?
a. No difference in treatment
b. Placement of patient in ICU
c. Need for thoracentesis
d. Difference in antibiotic choice
Answer c. Need for thoracentesis
Thoracentesis is needed if there is an effusion to see if there is empyema. Empyema
means an infection in the pleural space, not
just that there is fluid transudatively moving
into the pleural space. An empyema is infected exudate. If there is empyema, drainage
with a chest tube is needed because it will act
like an abscess. In addition, undrained empyema can also slow scar formation and
tighten the lungs and destroy lung function.

1017/1624

The patient is moved to the hospital
ward. All orders for decubitus films,
oxygen, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone
go with the patient. Move the clock
forward to get results of the films.

Ceftriaxone inhibits cell wall production.

Azithromycin inhibits ribosomal production of protein.

Report:
Decubitus x-ray: layering out of effusion seen

1018/1624

Orders:
Thoracentesis under sonographic
guidance
Pulmonary consultation

Which quality of pleural fluid is
the strongest indication for chest
tube drainage?
a. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >60% of
serum
b. pH <7.2
c. Protein >50% of serum
d. WBC count 500/μL
Answer b. pH <7.2
Unquestionably, the strongest indication for
chest tube drainage is a low pleural fluid pH.

1019/1624

This is the greatest indicator of severe infection. LDH >60% of serum and protein >50%
of serum indicate an exudative effusion, but
not clearly an infection. WBC count in pleural fluid is strangely not as accurate an indicator of infection as it is in urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and ascites.

Normal pleural fluid pH is 7.6.

Pleural Fluid Report:
pH: 7.5
Protein and LDH: slightly elevated
WBCs: 486/mm3
The patient is on oxygen and antibiotics. Repeat the oximeter on oxygen to
ensure adequate oxygenation. As soon

1020/1624

as hypoxia, fever, and hypotension improve, the patient can be safely discharged home on oral azithromycin.
The same criteria for admission
(CURB)—Confusion, Uremia, Respiratory distress, BP low—are the same
as for discharge. In the absence of
CURB, the patient can leave.

Pneumonia vaccine should be given to
prevent infection with other serotypes.

CASE 4: Pneumocystis
Pneumonia
Setting: ED

1021/1624

CC: “I keep coughing and I can’t
breathe.”
VS: BP: 108/72 mm Hg; P: 88 beats/
minute; T: 101.4°F; R: 26 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 54-year-old man with acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) arrives at the ED with several days of increasing dyspnea and cough. The dyspnea is definitely worse on exertion and
that is the main reason he has come to
the ED. The cough is dry and nonproductive: “Nothing comes up when I
cough.” He has not measured his
temperature.
PMHX:
AIDS: does not know his CD4 count
Oral thrush

1022/1624

Medications: none for past 6 months;
“I’m supposed to be taking something,
but I don’t know the name of it.”
ROS:
Inspiratory “catch”—sharp pain under
sternum when he breaths in
PE:
General: thin, wasted appearance
Chest: clear bilaterally
Abdomen: normal
Cardiovascular: normal
Initial Orders:
Oximeter, oxygen, ABG, chest x-ray
CBC
CD4 count
LDH

1023/1624

Pneumococcus is the most common CAP
in patients with AIDS.

Reports:
Oximeter: 94% room air saturation
Although the most common CAP in
AIDS is pneumococcus, the patient has
a dry cough and normal lung
examination.

Interstitial pneumonia is associated with
a nonproductive cough.

1024/1624

Reports:
ABG: pH 7.49; PCO2 32 mm Hg; PO2
70 mm Hg (on room air)
Chest x-ray: bilateral interstitial
infiltrates
CBC: WBCs 3200/μL (low); Hct:
34%; MCV 88 fL
LDH: 825 units/L (elevated)

Interstitial Infiltrates
• Pneumocystis
• Mycoplasma
• Chlamydia pneumonia
• Viral
• Coxiella

1025/1624

“Empty” Alveoli = Dry Cough

What is this patient’s
alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient?
a. 20 mm Hg
b. 24 mm Hg
c. 30 mm Hg
d. 40 mm Hg
e. 45 mm Hg
Answer d. 40 mm Hg
A-a gradient = 150 – (PCO2/0.8 + PO2)
150 – (32/0.8 + 70)
150 – (40 + 70)
150 – 110 = 40 mm Hg

1026/1624

Any cell breakdown causes high levels of
LDH.

Why does mycoplasma not appear
on Gram stain?
a. No cell wall
b. Intracellular
c. Too small
d. No stainable DNA
Answer a. No cell wall
Mycoplasma does not have a true cell wall.
Mycoplasma is encased in a cell membrane
that does not pick up Gram stain. Chlamydia
and viruses are intracellular. Gram stain
does not stain DNA, it stains the cell wall.

1027/1624

Normal LDH strongly excludes Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP).

Once you have the results of the chest
x-ray, you can order therapy. Unlike
the other forms of pneumonia, PCP is
not covered by the usual CAP drugs of
ceftriaxone and azithromycin or a
quinolone such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gemifloxacin.

What is the indication for giving
steroids in PCP?
a. PO2 <80 mm Hg or A-a gradient >25 mm
Hg
b. PO2 <70 mm Hg or A-a gradient >25 mm
Hg

1028/1624

c. PO2 <70 mm Hg or A-a gradient >35 mm
Hg
d. PO2 <60 mm Hg or A-a gradient >35 mm
Hg
Answer c. PO2 <70 mm Hg or A-a gradient
>35 mm Hg
Glucocorticoids such as prednisone give a
50% decrease in mortality in a person with
severe PCP. Use of steroids are absolutely
lifesaving in severe disease. Never be worried
about short-term steroid use in acutely ill patients even if they are immunocompromised.

Orders:
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(TMP-SMZ) IV
Prednisone orally
Pulmonary consultation

1029/1624

Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL)

TMP-SMZ is a folate antagonist.

Advance the clock to get the results of
the bronchoscopy. There should be an
immediate improvement in respiratory status the same day with the use
of steroids. Steroids will decrease fluids or swelling in the interstitial membrane and allow greater transfer of
oxygen from the alveolus to the
arteriole.
Reports:
BAL: P. jiroveci found

1030/1624

CD4: 18

Pneumocystis jiroveci (Figure 7-4)
• It is a fungus by DNA classification.
• Antifungal drugs do not work.

Figure 7-4. Pneumocystis pneumonia. A silver stain of this
material from the lung reveals folded cysts, some of which
contain comma-shaped spores. (Reproduced with

1031/1624

permission from Connor DH, et al., eds. Pathology of Infectious Diseases, vol. 1. New York: Appleton & Lange; 1997.)

Over the next several days, there is no
change to therapy. Decreasing the
steroid dosage will happen after 5
days. Do an “Interval History” every
day the patient is in the hospital to
confirm improvement. Serum chemistry should be done at least every 2
days in a hospitalized patient undergoing active IV treatment.

Pneumocystis jiroveci
• Formerly Pneumocystis carinii
• Does not grow on fungal media

1032/1624

Reports:
Interval History: “Improved shortness of breath”
Chemistry:
Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL (elevated)
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): normal
Sodium: 130 mEq/L (normal 135–145
mEq/L)
Glucose: 165 mg/dL

TMP decreases the tubular secretion of
creatinine.

All pneumonias cause the syndrome of
inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic
hormone (SIADH).

1033/1624

Steroids increase glucose:
• Decreased uptake by muscle
• Increase gluconeogenesis
• Permissive action on glucagon

What should you do about these
laboratory abnormalities?
a. No action is needed.
b. Stop steroids.
c. Stop TMP-SMZ and switch to IV
pentamidine.
d. Stop TMP-SMZ and switch to aerosolized
pentamidine.
Answer a. No action is needed.
Move the clock forward and repeat the laboratory tests. You do not need to do anything
for these laboratory abnormalities at this

1034/1624

mild level. Prednisone is lifesaving in severe
PCP and a glucose level of 165 mg/dL is clinically irrelevant for a short period of 2 to 3
weeks. A mild bump up in creatinine level
has very limited clinical significance. You
will be switching to oral TMP-SMZ at 10 to
14 days to complete the full 3 weeks orally if
the patient is stable. Also, IV pentamidine is
even more nephrotoxic than TMP-SMZ.
Aerosolized pentamidine is completely
inadequate at acute therapy. It is a fourthline choice used rarely, if at all for prophylaxis of PCP.

TMP decreases the tubular secretion of
creatinine.

1035/1624

Advance the clock and recheck the
laboratory test results. If there is no
further deterioration in chemistry
levels, just continue the same treatment. Start antiretroviral medications,
such as efavirenz, emtricitabine, and
tenofovir. When the patient is improved and ready for discharge, longterm prophylaxis with oral TMP-SMZ
is used lifelong, or until the patient’s
CD4 count is brought up above 200
with antiretroviral treatment (ART).
Steroids are tapered down so that they
stop at the time the patient is switched
from full-dose IV or oral TMP-SMZ to
the prophylactic dose.

When the patient’s CD4 level increases:
• Continue lifelong ART.

1036/1624

• Stop prophylactic medications when
the CD4 count is above 200 cells/mm3.

CASE 5: Tuberculosis
Setting: ED
CC: “Fever, cough, sputum, weight loss”
VS: BP: 112/70 mm Hg; T:101.4°F; R:
18 breaths/minute
HPI: A 34-year-old immigrant from
Asia comes to the ED with fever, cough,
and sputum with some hemoptysis developing over a few weeks. The patient
has lost 15 pounds unintentionally over
the past few weeks.
PMHX: alcoholism

1037/1624

Medications: none
PE:
Head, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat
(HEENT): normal, no adenopathy
Chest: scattered rales, no consolidation
Cardiovascular: no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Initial Orders:
Chest x-ray
Oxygen
Oximeter
A patient with these symptoms can also
be put on isolation from the beginning.
You will not lose points for doing so.
Report:
Chest x-ray: apical infiltrate (Figure
7-5)
Oximeter: 95% saturation on room air

1038/1624

Orders:
Respiratory isolation
Sputum acid fast stain
Mycobacterial culture

1039/1624

Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) Skin
Testing
• Not for acute diagnosis
• Not for symptomatic persons
• Not with fever, cough, sputum,
abnormal x-ray

PPD screens asymptomatic groups.
PPD detects previous exposures in highrisk groups.

The patient is placed on respiratory
isolation. Some providers, based on
the x-ray and the clarity of the diagnosis, may choose to add ceftriaxone
and azithromycin. Do not start

1040/1624

empiric tuberculosis (TB) medication
until you have obtained sputum acidfast cultures. You will want to give the
sample every chance to grow.

Obtain sputum acid-fast cultures before
starting anti-TB medications.

Acid-fast culture is the only way to determine the sensitivity of an organism.

The patient is placed on respiratory
isolation. His fever persists at 101°F
and then 101.5°F.

1041/1624

Report:
Acid-fast stain: positive (Figure 7-6)
Once the acid-fast stain is positive, order four TB medications and vitamin
B6 (pyridoxine).
Orders:
Rifampin
Isoniazid
Pyrazinamide
Ethambutol
Vitamin B6
Liver function tests (LFTs) (aspartate
aminotransferase [AST], alanine
aminotransferase [ALT])

1042/1624

Figure 7-6. Note the rounded granuloma. This biopsy
shows old tubercle bacilli walled off in the lung. (Reproduced with permission from Ryan KJ, et al. Sherris Medical
Microbiology, 5th ed., New York: McGraw-Hill; 2010.)

Isoniazid increases urinary loss of pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

1043/1624

Move the clock forward to get the results of LFTs and see if there is a
change in them by the use of TB
medication.

TB medications are eliminated by hepatic p450 systems.

The patient must remain on isolation
until repeat acid-fast stains of sputum
show that the TB has been cleared
from the smear and the patient is not
dangerous to others.
Results: baseline LFTs are normal.

1044/1624

What test will tell first if the
acid-fast bacilli are the organism
Mycobacterium tuberculosis or
another species in the genus
Mycobacteriaceae?
a. Culture
b. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
c. Response to therapy
d. No way to tell
Answer b. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)
PCR takes infinitesimally small amounts of
genetic material from an organism and multiplies it in order to detect the speciation of
the organism before the cultures grow. Mycobacterial culture can take 4 to 6 weeks to
grow. The PCR can speciate the organism in
a day.

1045/1624

There is no difference in the appearance
of mycobacteria on a smear.

The patient remains in the hospital on
respiratory isolation. Respiratory isolation can be very lonely and depressing. Staff do not visit you as often, and
when they do, it is briefer and there is
much less discussion.
After 7 days in the hospital, you repeat the sputum smear because the patient states “I can’t stand it in isolation.
I have to get out of here as soon as
possible.”
Report:
The repeat acid-fast bacillus (AFB)
stain at 7 days is positive.

1046/1624

What test can be done to prove
whether the mycobacteria on the
stain are alive or dead?
a. Nothing can be done.
b. Use a PCR assay.
c. Wait for the results of the culture.
d. Do interferon provocation testing.
Answer c. Wait for the results of the
culture.
You cannot do anything right away to tell if
the AFB are alive or dead. PCR will tell the
species, but cannot tell if they are viable AFB
that can spread disease, or just dead, old
AFB.

1047/1624

After 10 days in isolation, the patient
says that he is walking out of the hospital: “You can’t stop me!”

What can you do to control this
potential TB transmission
problem?
a. Arrest him and put him in prison.
b. Place a guard at the door to enforce
isolation.
c. Consult the ethics committee.
d. You can do nothing; he is an adult who is
free to go.
Answer b. Place a guard at the door to enforce isolation.
He does not have the right to leave the hospital as long as he has AFB in his sputum

1048/1624

that may be viable. As long as a patient can
transmit TB, you have the right to incarcerate him in the hospital. Because you are not a
police officer, you do not have the right to arrest or imprison him. There is no point in
consulting an ethics committee for a clear,
straightforward problem. It does not matter
what they say. It is not an ethics problem. It
is an infection control problem.
Active TB in Sputum = Mandatory Respiratory Isolation

From whom you mainly isolating
the patient?
a. General unexposed public
b. Household contacts
c. Friends and family
Answer a. General unexposed public

1049/1624

Interestingly, the family is not the biggest
concern. They have already been exposed.
You are isolating the patient from other patients and the general public who has never
been exposed to TB. The patient is already
on TB medications and is much less infectious now than he was before he came to the
hospital. You are isolating him from new
contacts.
After another week, the repeat AFB
stain is negative, and the patient is released from the hospital. He will get
all four TB drugs for the first 2
months, then continue isoniazid and
rifampin alone for another 4 months.

Pulmonary TB

1050/1624

• Total therapy: 6 months

Bone, Central Nervous System (CNS),
Miliary, or Pregnant Patient
• Total therapy: 9 months

Toxicity
• Pyrazinamide: hyperuricemia
• Rifampin: red secretions, body fluids
• Ethambutol: optic neuritis, color vision
problems

When the final “Case will end in 5
minutes of real time” screen pops up,

1051/1624

do not forget to order TB screening for
the patient’s contacts. Either the PPD
skin test or the in vitro interferon
gamma release assay is used. Both
tests indicate the need for 9 months of
treatment with isoniazid and vitamin
B6 to prevent possible reactivation of
TB in those previously exposed.

CASE 6: Pulmonary Embolus
Setting: ED
CC: “I’m having a hard time catching
my breath.”
VS: BP: 108/68 mm Hg; P:108 beats/
minute; T: 101°F; R: 24 breaths/minute
HPI: A 42-year-old woman, coming
from India, just deplaned at the airport,

1052/1624

feeling very short of breath, and was
brought immediately to the ED. She was
on a flight from Mumbai, through
Dubai to New York, and started feeling
dyspneic about an hour before landing.
The flight stewards thought she might
be having a panic attack and had her lie
down on the floor in the first class cabin, but saw no improvement in her
symptoms. The woman is on a stretcher
in your ED with oxygen in place, and
she is feeling anxious.
PMHX: ovarian cysts
Medications: none
As with most of the CCS pulmonary and
dyspnea cases, order oxygen, oximeter,
chest x-ray, and ABG.
PE:
General: anxious, sweating

1053/1624

Chest: clear to auscultation, no rales,
rhonchi, or crepitations
Cardiovascular: normal
Abdomen: benign
Oxygen is considered to be administered
immediately, but tests ordered at the
same time are considered to be done
first. It is much harder to interpret an
oximeter or ABG while the person is on
oxygen. It is never precisely clear how
much oxygen patients are really getting
except when they are on ventilator
support.
Report:
Oximeter 90% room air saturation
Chest x-ray: normal
ABG: pH 7.47; PCO2 31 mm Hg; PO2
62 mm Hg

1054/1624

CCS is designed to assess your ability to
determine just the right timing of tests
versus treatments or both.

What should you do next for this
person?
a. Order a ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan.
b. Give the patient heparin.
c. Move the patient to ICU and do a CT
angiogram.
d. Perform and embolectomy.
e. Order an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.
Answer b. Give the patient heparin.
This is enough information to indicate the
need to start therapy. The acute onset of
shortness of breath without wheezing on examination or the rales of congestive heart
failure (CHF) has a high predictive value for
pulmonary embolus (PE). The number one

1055/1624

issue in PE management is, in fact, making
sure you know not to wait for specific tests
like a CT angiogram, VQ scan, or lower extremity Doppler ultrasound to start therapy.
Acute Hypoxia + Normal Lung Examination and Chest X-Ray = PE

Little else besides PE causes severe desaturation and clear lungs.

Peripheral chemoreceptors:
• Aortic arch hypoxia
• Stimulation PO2 <60 mm Hg

1056/1624

How will you determine the need
for thrombolytics?
a. Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound
b. Hypotension and right-sided heart strain
on echocardiogram or electrocardiogram
(ECG)
c. CT angiogram
d. VQ scan and d-dimer
Answer b. Hypotension and right-sided
heart strain on echocardiogram or electrocardiogram (ECG)
Thrombolytics are used for the most severe,
large clots. This question basically asks if you
know how to assess the severity of the clot.
Large clots block blood flow. Blocked blood
flow decreases BP and causes back pressure
in the heart. Clot size on CT is not as important as decreased heart function.

1057/1624

Severe Dangerous Clot = Hypotension
and Abnormal Heart Pressure

With a large clot, which test gives
the first abnormal result?
a. Right ventricular hypertrophy
b. Right bundle-branch block
c. Increased pulmonary artery (PA) pressure
d. Increased wedge pressure
e. ECG with S1Q3T3 pattern
Answer c. Increased pulmonary artery (PA)
pressure
Big clots block PAs. Blocked PAs give pulmonary hypertension, which is largely saying
the same thing. Right ventricular hypertension happens later. ECG findings occur after
that. Wedge pressure indicates left atrial
pressure. Wedge pressure is measured on a

1058/1624

right-sided heart catheter but has nothing to
do with right-sided heart pressures.

Large clots cause pulmonary
hypertension.

Orders:
ECG
Echocardiogram
Activated partial thromboplastin time
(aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR)
CT angiogram

Low molecular weight heparin has equal
efficacy to IV heparin.

1059/1624

Heparin works by potentiating
antithrombin.
It prevents clot formation, but does not
destroy old clots.

The patient is on oxygen and heparin.
Repeat oximeter shows the saturation
largely unchanged at 91% to 92%. On
a 50% facemask saturation, it is still
at 93% to 94%.

When the ECG does show an
abnormality, what is the most
common abnormality found?
a. S1Q3T3 pattern
b. Nonspecific ST-T wave changes

1060/1624

c. Right bundle-branch block
d. Tall R waves in V1 and V2 (right ventricular hypertrophy)
Answer b. Nonspecific ST-T wave changes
The reason for the nonspecific ST- and Twave changes is not precisely clear. The other findings going along with right-sided
heart strain may have more specificity for a
PE, but are much less common, being seen in
<25% of patients.
Clots and hematomas give fever.

Coagulation Studies
Done at baseline for those patients who
need anticoagulation therapy.

1061/1624

Reports:
ECG: sinus tachycardia with T-wave
flattening in I, aVL, and V5 and V6
aPTT, PT, INR: normal
CT angiogram: large clot in PAs
bilaterally
With persistent hypoxia despite increasing administration of oxygen
and signs of right-sided heart strain,
the patient should be placed in the ICU
and thrombolytics (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]) given.

The ventilation-to-perfusion ratio (V:Q)
mismatch prevents increased oxygenation despite giving oxygen to the patient.

1062/1624

Report:
Echocardiogram: PA pressure 54
mm Hg (elevated); decreased right
ventricular motion; enlarged right
atrium

Which form of thrombophilia
changes initial therapy?
a. None
b. Antiphospholipid syndrome
c. Protein C or S deficiency
d. Factor V Leiden mutation
Answer a. None
Thrombophilias make no difference in acute
management. You use heparin followed by
6 months of warfarin initially with all of
them. All of them get an INR of 2 to 3 with

1063/1624

the first clot. That is why there is no point in
testing for them with a first clot. They do not
change management.
If a clot is found on CT, then Doppler ultrasounds of the legs do not
matter.
If a clot is found on Doppler ultrasounds of the legs, then CT does not
matter.

All that matters is:
Clot versus No Clot

Doppler ultrasounds are 60% to 70%
sensitive for the PE source.

1064/1624

What is the mechanism of
thrombolytics?
a. Plasmin breaks fresh clots into d-dimers.
b. Fibrinogen is activated to fibrin split
products.
c. They inhibit the cascade start (factor XII
and VII).
d. They break up fibrinogen after factor XIII
stabilizes it.
Answer a. Plasmin breaks fresh clots into ddimers.
Thrombolytics activate plasminogen into
plasmin. Plasmin dissolves recently activated
fibrin into d-dimers. Plasmin will not specifically break up clotting that has been
cross-linked and stabilized by factor XIII. It
is thrombin that activates fibrinogen by
splitting off fibrin-split products.

1065/1624

Thrombin activates fibrinogen, creating
split products.
Plasmin destroys fibrin, creating Ddimers.

After administering thrombolytics,
both oxygenation and BP improve in
the patient.
Repeat VS: P: 98 beats/minute; BP
118/74 mm Hg
Repeat ABG: pH 7.42; PCO2 38 mm
Hg; PO2 74 mm Hg
Orders:
Transfer patient to ward.
Continue heparin.
Start warfarin.

1066/1624

Measure INR.
Do CBC.

• If heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
(HIT) develops, use argatroban.
• Argatroban is a direct-acting thrombin
inhibitor.

After transferring the patient to the
hospital ward, repeat the physical examination. Move the clock forward 1
day at a time after moving the patient
to the hospital ward. Repeat the CBC
and INR each day looking for HIT and
to achieve a therapeutic INR of 2 to 3.
You will not see an effect of warfarin

1067/1624

for several days and should not expect
to see a fully therapeutic INR for 5 to 7
days.

Use IVC filter:
• For bleeding
• When anticoagulation cannot be used
• When there is a recurrence while fully
anticoagulated

Warfarin
• Inhibits factors II, VII, IX, X
• Needs 3 days to work

1068/1624

After 5 days, the patient’s INR rises to
2.4. You can stop the heparin when the
INR comes above 2 and discharge the
patient. The length of therapy should
be 6 months.

CASE 7: Sarcoidosis
Setting: office
CC: “I get tired and winded when I
walk.”
VS: BP: 110/70 mm Hg; T: 98°F; R: 14
breaths/minute
HPI: A 32-year-old African American
woman comes to the office complaining
of intermittent episodes of shortness of
breath. She has been told she has
asthma and is intermittently placed on

1069/1624

albuterol inhalers and oral steroids. Her
shortness of breath clears up and she
stops all medications until it recurs a
few months later. She also has a cough
that is not productive of sputum.
PMHX:
Skin lesions intermittently:
undiagnosed
Medications:
None routinely; steroids and inhaled
beta-agonists intermittently
PE:
General: well-nourished
Chest: some crepitations bilaterally
Skin: dark lesion on face, reddishbrown tender lesions on shins
Cardiovascular: loud P2
Initial Orders:

1070/1624

Chest x-ray
Pulse oximeter

Pulmonary hypertension causes a loud
P 2.

The patient returns a week later to
discuss the findings on the chest x-ray.
There is no shortness of breath acutely
and no treatment is started.
New visits to the clinic or office
should always start with an “Interval
History” to see what has been going on
since the last visit. In this way, you will
assess both new symptoms and the response to new medications.
Interval History: “Patient has
some mild decrease in exercise

1071/1624

tolerance, but it has not changed recently. No dyspnea with household and
work activities.”
Report:
Chest x-ray: bilateral hilar
adenopathy

Hilar Adenopathy Etiology
• Lymphoma
• Thyroid
• Teratoma
• Sarcoid
• TB

1072/1624

With no fever, weight loss, or palpable
peripheral adenopathy, it is hard to
conclude that this is lymphoma or malignancy. Tuberculosis should give
fever, cough, and sputum and would
not give a “waxing and waning”
presentation with intermittent episodes. Although there are no interstitial
infiltrates, early sarcoid can present
just with hilar adenopathy. The majority will never progress to having
interstitial infiltrates.
Orders:
PFTs
Calcium blood
Calcium urine
Angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) level
CHEM-20

1073/1624

Reports:
Calcium: blood normal, urine
elevated
ACE: elevated

Granulomas in sarcoid produce vitamin
D.

Calcium is freely filtered at the
glomerulus.

Report:

1074/1624

PFTs

Which of these is consistent with
sarcoidosis?

Answer c. FEV1 58% [decreased], FVC 60%
[decreased], TLC 56% [decreased]
Sarcoidosis is a pulmonary fibrosis that results in restrictive lung disease. All of the lung
volumes are decreased, but they are down
proportionately. The ratio of FEV1 to FVC is
normal. Restrictive lung disease is present in

1075/1624

sarcoid even when there is only adenopathy
visible on the chest x-ray. Early fibrosis will
not be visible on the chest x-ray.
The patient is informed that she likely
has sarcoidosis (Figure 7-7). The skin
lesions are likely sarcoid as well. Only
10% of patients with sarcoidosis have
an elevated blood calcium level, but
60% to 75% have elevated urine calcium levels.

by an antigen-presenting cell (macrophage or dendritic

1077/1624

cell). The processed antigen is presented to a T-cell receptor
(TCR) of a T lymphocyte via an human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) class II molecule. Once the HLA receptor and TCR
have bound the processed antigen, numerous lymphokines
and cytokines of the T helper 1 (Th1) class are released that
lead to T-cell proliferation, recruitment of monocytes, and
eventual granuloma formation. A few of these lymphokines
and cytokines are shown, with those released by the
antigen-presenting cells on the left and those released by
lymphocytes on the right. IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin;
TNF, tumor necrosis factor. (Reproduced with permission

General Medicine, 8th ed. [online] New York: McGraw-Hill;

Which of the following is the most
accurate test?
a. Lymph node biopsy on bronchoscopy
b. BAL with increased CD4 cells
c. Biopsy of erythema nodosum on shins
d. ACE level
Answer a.
bronchoscopy

Lymph

node

biopsy

on

1078/1624

The biopsy of a lymph node is the single
most accurate test. You can biopsy a peripheral node if it is present and affected. The
BAL should show an increase in the ratio of
CD4 helper cells to CD8 suppressor cells.
ACE level is neither sufficiently sensitive or
specific enough to be the most accurate diagnostic test.
The biopsy of erythema nodosum is specifically incorrect because it will show panniculitis or inflammation of soft tissues, but
no granulomas.

Sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas.

Erythema nodosum does not show
granulomas in sarcoid!

1079/1624

Which of the following is the most
common site of sarcoid outside
the lung?
a. Liver
b. Skin
c. CNS
d. Cardiac
e. Salivary gland
Answer b. Skin
All of the listed sites can be involved in sarcoidosis, but the most common area outside
the lung is the skin. The liver, spleen, and
kidney are involved, but they are almost always clinically silent.

Cardiac Sarcoid
• Atrioventricular (AV) block

1080/1624

• Restrictive cardiomyopathy

Neurosarcoidosis
• Hypothalamus
• Pituitary
• Bilateral facial palsy

The patient undergoes transbronchial
biopsy, which shows noncaseating
granulomas (Figure 7-8) in the
lymph nodes. Currently, she is not
short of breath.

1081/1624

Figure 7-8. Schematic representation of initial events of
sarcoidosis. The antigen-presenting cell and helper T-cell
complex leads to the release of multiple cytokines. This
forms a granuloma. Over time, the granuloma may resolve
or lead to chronic disease, including fibrosis. APC, antigenpresenting cell; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.

York: McGraw-Hill; 2012.)

What is your next step?
a. Treat with intermittent pulses of prednisone to prevent exacerbations.
b. Treat with cyclophosphamide.
c. Treat with prednisone when episodes of
shortness of breath arise.
d. Treat with anti-tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) medications.
Answer c. Treat with prednisone when
episodes of shortness of breath arise.
Asymptomatic sarcoidosis needs no therapy.
When symptoms arise, they should quickly
resolve when treated with steroids. This is
exactly what has been happening to the patient when she got labeled as asthmatic. Steroid doses would improve the sarcoidosis, but

1083/1624

it would seem to the physician as improving
asthma.

The diffusing capacity of the lungs for
carbon monoxide (DLCO) is low in
sarcoid.

Carbon monoxide diffuses through tissue 200 times easier than oxygen.

On CCS, this sarcoidosis case is to be
seen “as needed” on the clock. If there
are no symptoms, no treatment or testing is needed.

1084/1624

CASE 8: Pulmonary
Hypertension
Setting: office
CC: “I really get out of breath when I
walk around.”
VS: BP: 114/72 mm Hg; P: 90 beats/
minute; T: 99.8°F; R:14 breaths/minute
HPI: You are visited at your office by a
34-year-old woman with recently diagnosed CREST (calcinosis cutis,
Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal
motility disorder, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome and with increasing dyspnea especially on exertion
that has been slowly progressive over
several months. She originally presented last year with triphasic color
changes and pain of Raynaud

1085/1624

phenomenon. Nifedipine partially controls this. Her skin has been tightening
up, but she is still mobile. Her reflux disease is well maintained on omeprazole.
She has no cough, fever, or sputum.
PMHx/Medications: as above
PE:
General: thin woman
Chest: no rales; no crepitations; no
dullness to percussion
Cardiovascular: loud P2, no murmur
Skin: immobile, sclerodactyly present;
few telangiectasia
Initial Orders:
Chest x-ray
Echocardiogram
Oximeter
CBC
Report:

1086/1624

Oximeter: 91% to 92% saturation on
room air
Because oxygen saturation is >90% on
room air, you do not order supplemental oxygen. Clearly, the patient desaturates when walking around, as oxygen
demand increases. Schedule a repeat
visit in a few days after the test results
are back.

What do you expect to find on the
CBC?
a. Increased platelets
b. Hct increased, MCV decreased
c. Hct decreased, MCV decreased
d. Normal
e. WBC count increased
Answer b. Hct increased, MCV decreased

1087/1624

The body’s response to chronic hypoxia is to
increase erythropoietin and red blood cell
(RBC) production. This decreases MCV.
Erythropoietin is produced at the kidney,
which is also the site of detection of chronic
hypoxia.

What is the physiologic
mechanism of a loud P2?
a. Tricuspid stenosis
b. Pulmonic stenosis
c. Pulmonary hypertension
d. Aortic stenosis
e. Atrial septal defect
Answer c. Pulmonary hypertension
The P2 is the second part of the S2 heart
sound. When there is pulmonary hypertension, the normal P2 becomes like a “slammed

1088/1624

shut door,” and it is a sign of both increased
pressure and decreased flow out of the pulmonary valve.

Reports:
Chest x-ray: enlarged right ventricle
on lateral x-ray
Echocardiogram: pulmonary hypertension, increased right ventricular
wall thickness, and right ventricular
hypertrophy

What is the mechanism of
pulmonary hypertension in this
patient?
a. CREST causes primary pulmonary hypertension with normal lung parenchyma.
b. The patient has pulmonary fibrosis.

1089/1624

c. Hypoxia led to vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature, which led to pulmonary hypertension.
d. Right-to-left shunting through a patent
foramen ovale puts desaturated blood in
the lungs.
e. Carbon dioxide retention makes the pulmonary vasculature dilate.
Answer a. CREST causes primary pulmonary hypertension with normal lung
parenchyma.
CREST syndrome includes primary pulmonary hypertension. It is called “primary” entirely because the lung parenchyma is normal. Anyone with lung fibrosis or COPD has
pulmonary hypertension from decreased
compliance of the lung and the greater work
of the right ventricle. Primary pulmonary hypertension leads to hypoxia. Hypoxia further
constricts pulmonary vessels. The origin of

1090/1624

the defect, however, is the idiopathic narrowing of the PA.

CREST Pulmonary Hypertension
• Excess prostacyclin
• Excess endothelin

The patient returns in 3 months feeling worsening dyspnea.
PE:
Abdomen: enlarged liver
Extremities: peripheral edema

Pulmonary Hypertension = Decreased
RV Filling

1091/1624

Decreased RV Filling = Increased Hydrostatic Venous Pressure

Increased venous hydrostatic pressure
transudates edema into tissues.

Orders:
Furosemide orally is started.
Over the next few weeks, the patient
continues to have worsening dyspnea
on exertion. Oxygen saturation hovers
at 89% to 90%. Oxygen is started.

Oxygen vasodilates pulmonary
vasculature.

1092/1624

Oxygen decreases pulmonary
hypertension.

Progression of dyspnea continues. The
patient feels fine at rest on oxygen but
quickly desaturates on exertion. The
repeat echocardiogram shows
worsening PA pressure.
Orders:
Warfarin to INR 2 to 3
Pulmonary consultation
Evaluation for right-sided heart
catheterization and vasoreactivity
test
Trial of calcium channel blockers

1093/1624

Anticoagulation for:
• Sluggish blood flow +
• Intrapulmonary thrombosis +
• Dilated right side of heart

The patient returns in 2 weeks. There
is no significant improvement in
symptoms. Right-sided heart catheterization was equivocal for improvement with calcium channel blockers
(e.g., diltiazem). Pulmonary consultation, as do all consultations on CCS,
does not give specific advice.
Orders:
Continue home oxygen, warfarin,
and furosemide.

1094/1624

Begin trial of bosentan (or
ambrisentan).

Bosentan or Ambrisentan
• Endothelin-1 antagonists
• Decrease growth of PA

After 2 weeks, on return, the patient is
no better. Her oxygen saturation hits
90% on a 3-L nasal canula and her exercise tolerance is deteriorating.
Orders:
Add epoprostenol.
Add sildenafil.

1095/1624

Epoprostenol
• Prostacyclin analogue
• Prostaglandin I2
• Eicosanoid derivative
• Inhibits platelet activation
• Vasodilatory

Sildenafil
• Phosphodiesterase inhibitor
• Cyclic guanosine monophosphate
(cGMP) inhibitor
• Prolongs nitric oxide effect
• Vasodilates pulmonary vasculature

Over time, severe pulmonary hypertension may need lung transplantation.

1096/1624

The management of primary pulmonary hypertension is extremely difficult.
There is no medical therapy to cure or
permanently halt the disorder. Most
treatment is a matter of trial and
error.

CHAPTER 8

1099/1624

RHEUMATOLOGY
CASE 1: Rheumatoid Arthritis
Setting: office
CC: “My hands hurt.”
VS: normal
HPI: A 38-year-old woman with pain
in her hands for the past year visits you
at your office. She takes acetaminophen
and over-the-counter nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with
some relief. The pain began in several
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of
the hands with the thumb especially affected. Pain has started in the feet as
well, affecting the metatarsophalangeal

1100/1624

(MTP) joints. She has difficulty moving
the joints when getting out of bed or
after staying in one position too long.
The pain is worse in the morning, but
improves as she starts to move around
over the course of the day over the next
1 to 2 hours.
PMHX: none
Medications:
Ibuprofen
Acetaminophen
PE:
Musculoskeletal
“Boggy” swelling of several small joints
in each hand and foot symmetrically
Decreased grip strength of hands
One elbow minimally involved
Skin: no nodules in skin

1101/1624

Chest: dullness and decreased breath
sounds at left base
Initial Orders:
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (antiCCP)
Rheumatoid factor (RF)
x-ray of hands
Chest x-ray

The cause of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
is unknown.

Short-term steroid therapy can sometimes help acutely.

1102/1624

Chronic NSAID use: 20% chance of ulcer
per year

The patient continues to use ibuprofen
for pain with some relief.
Reports:
ESR: 68 mm/h
CRP: elevated
Anti-CCP: positive
RF: positive
X-ray of hands: normal joints
Chest x-ray: effusion on one side

1103/1624

What is the difference in the
overall clinical value of CRP and
ESR?
a. None
b. ESR is for diagnosis; CRP is for follow up.
c. ESR is more sensitive for RA.
d. CRP is better for predicting mortality.
e. ESR is more useful in response to therapy.
Answer a. None
There is no overall difference in the use of
ESR or CRP in either diagnosis or the response to treatment. There is no clear area in
which there is a definite benefit of one versus
the other in testing, treatment, or prognosis.
Anti-CCP is the most specific of the
tests for RA.

1104/1624

RF: immunoglobulin M (IgM) against
the Fc portion of IgG

Which of these is essential to
diagnose RA?
a. Abnormal x-ray
b. Nodules
c. Anti-CCP or RF positive
d. Anemia
e. Arthrocentesis
Answer c. Anti-CCP or RF positive
There must be some laboratory evidence of
RA to establish a diagnosis. There is no one
single test to establish a diagnosis of RA even
though the anti-CCP is the most specific of
the tests. An anti-CCP antibody result alone,
without the involvement of multiple small

1105/1624

joints, morning stiffness >1 hour, and a duration of several months is not RA. Normocytic anemia happens from the anemia of
chronic disease and is completely nonspecific. Nodules are only present in 20% of patients, though they can be present in the lung
and eyes. An abnormal x-ray is most certainly not essential for establishing a diagnosis of RA. The entire point of using
disease-modifying
antirheumatic
drugs
(DMARDs) is to prevent the development of
an abnormal result shown on x-ray.

The “bogginess” felt on palpation during
the examination is overgrown synovial
lining.

RF is associated with

1106/1624

• Hepatitis C
• Cryoglobulins
• Endocarditis
• Tuberculosis
• Age

Positive RF does not equal RA.
Positive RF alone does not equal anything.

What is unique about the pleural
effusion of RA seen in this
patient?
a. High white blood cell (WBC) count
b. Low glucose level
c. High protein level
d. Negative Gram stain
Answer b. Low glucose level

1107/1624

For unclear reasons (like everything in RA),
the etiology of low glucose level in RA pleural
effusion is unknown. RA effusions do,
however, have the lowest glucose level of any
pleural effusion.
The patient is started on low-dose
prednisone and methotrexate (MTX).
She returns the following week and
has marked improvement in pain, mobility, and morning stiffness.

• MTX takes 2 to 6 weeks to be effective.
• MTX is a folate antagonist.

1108/1624

After 1 month, steroids are stopped
and the patient remains on MTX
weekly and NSAIDs for pain. You
must advise the patient against becoming pregnant while on MTX because it is teratogenic.
MTX-caused liver or lung fibrosis is
a must know for the Step 3
examination !

MTX Folate Antagonism =
Teratogenicity

Which of these should you use if
MTX cannot be tolerated?
a. Leflunomide

1109/1624

b. Gold salts
c. Cyclosporine
d. Penicillamine
Answer a. Leflunomide
Leflunomide is an alternative to MTX as a
DMARD in those who have liver or lung
fibrosis. None of the others is ever the right
answer. Gold salts are no longer used in RA.
The patient comes to the office a few
months after the start of MTX and is
feeling better. She would like to become pregnant, but knows that MTX
cannot be used in pregnancy.

1110/1624

Which is the best therapy for RA
in pregnancy?
a. Sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine
b. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors
c. Minocycline
d. Leflunomide
Answer
a.
hydroxychloroquine

Sulfasalazine

and

These are the safest in pregnancy. Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic and should be
avoided in pregnancy. Leflunomide is both a
teratogen and a carcinogen.

Leflunomide is a pyrimidine antagonist.

1111/1624

The mechanism of retinal toxicity with
hydroxychloroquine is unknown.

The patient stops MTX therapy and
switches to hydroxychloroquine for a
few months while waiting for the MTX
to wash out of her system.

What will happen to her RA
activity during pregnancy?
a. Improve
b. Worsen
c. No change
Answer a. Improve

1112/1624

Most persons with RA improve during pregnancy. This was the original observation in
the 1930s that led to the discovery of
steroids.

In the ninth month of pregnancy,
now off MTX, why is it important
to tell the patient’s
anesthesiologist and obstetrician
prior to delivery that the patient
has RA?
a. So they can order an x-ray of her neck
b. So they can give her bolus intravenous
(IV) steroids
c. So they will not do a cesarean section (Csection) delivery
d. So they will stop hydroxychloroquine and
sulfasalazine therapy

1113/1624

Answer a. So they can order an x-ray of her
neck
Always inform surgical and anesthetic colleagues about RA because intubation is potentially dangerous because of C1 to C2 cervical spine subluxation (Figure 8-1). C-section is almost always done under epidural
anesthesia so this is not dangerous. RA generally does not involve the axial skeleton,
which is the spine and sacroiliac (SI) joints,
but endotracheal intubation is especially
dangerous. The hyperextension that is usually done can lead to cord compression.

1114/1624

Figure 8-1. The cervical spine in rheumatoid arthritis,
showing atlantoaxial subluxation. A lateral view of the upper cervical region shows posterior displacement of the
odontoid process. The preodontoid space measures approximately 8 mm (arrows). Normally, this measurement
should not exceed 2.5 to 3 mm in an adult. (Reproduced
with permission from McKean SC, et al. Principles and
Practice of Hospital Medicine. New York: McGraw-Hill;
2012.)

Moving the case forward a month or
two at a time, or waiting for your

1115/1624

pregnant patient to deliver, you then
restart the MTX therapy.

Which of the following is most
likely to occur in the long term
with RA?
a. SI joint involvement
b. Peritoneal inflammation
c. Carpal tunnel syndrome
d. Vasculitis
e. Pericarditis
Answer c. Carpal tunnel syndrome
Carpal tunnel can happen in 10% of patients.
Pericardial involvement is rare (<1%) and
usually clinically silent. Vasculitis is also
much rarer than carpal tunnel.

1116/1624

The computer-based case simulation
(CCS) and the Step 3 examination are
very big on testing your ability to advise patients about prognosis. You
have to know what to tell patients to
expect. You should tell RA patients
that they may get carpal tunnel. You
do not have to tell patients to expect
Felty syndrome (enlarged spleen and
neutropenia).
A year after the delivery of the baby
and restarted on MTX, the patient’s Interval History shows progression of
joint pain and immobility.

Which of these medications
should be added next?
a. Adalimumab or etanercept
b. Rituximab

1117/1624

c. Abatacept
d. Tocilizumab
e. Anakinra
Answer a. Adalimumab or etanercept
These are TNF inhibitors. It is clear that you
should use the TNF inhibitors first as add-on
therapy to MTX if the disease progresses.

Why do TNF inhibitors reactivate
tuberculosis (TB)?
a. They suppress neutrophil function.
b. They remove CD20 cells.
c. TNF maintains granulomas.
d. They block interleukin-6.
e. They block interleukin-1.
f. They inhibit T cell costimulation.
Answer c. TNF maintains granulomas.

1118/1624

TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept,
golimumab, certolizumab) “unlock” the old
TB stored away in walled-off granulomas
(Figure 8-2). This is why purified protein
derivative (PPD) screening is needed before
they are used.

Lange. © 1998 by the McGraw-Hill.)

Rituximab removes CD20 cells.
Anakinra suppresses neutrophil
function.
Tocilizumab blocks interleukin-6.
Abatacept inhibits T-cell costimulation.

Case Summary:
After prescribing MTX first and adding
a TNF inhibitor, you will not be asked
which DMARD is used next, because it
is not clear. The questions regarding
drug mechanism of action, such as
rituximab removing CD20 cells or tocilizumab inhibiting interleukin-6,

1121/1624

have definite answers. It is not clear,
however, which inflammatory marker,
CRP or ESR, is generally to be used in
rheumatology. It is clear that you do
not need to wait for an abnormal x-ray
result to make the diagnosis of RA. Use
DMARDs to prevent deformity from
becoming bad enough to be seen on an
x-ray.

CASE 2: Ankylosing
Spondylitis
Setting: office
CC: “My back is sore.”
VS: normal
HPI: A 22-year-old man comes to the
office complaining of several months of

1122/1624

intermittent lower back pain and stiffness. He has been seen by two other
physicians who have ascribed his symptoms to “drug-seeking” and
“malingering.”
PMHX: none
Medications:
Ibuprofen, naproxen (Naprosyn), or
sulindac

NSAIDs
• No difference in efficacy
• No difference in adverse effects

PE:
Musculoskeletal: normal
Cardiovascular: normal

1123/1624

Neurological: normal; normal reflexes; no focal neurological deficits;
straight leg raise test is normal
Initial Orders:
Ibuprofen as needed

Indications for Radiologic Imaging with
Back Pain
• Focal neurological defects
• Hyperreflexia
• Extensor plantar reflexes
• Bowel or bladder abnormalities (e.g.,
incontinence)

The straight leg raise test does not count
as a “focal” neurological deficit.

1124/1624

After you educate and advise the patient on the lack of utility of imaging
studies, he agrees to try only NSAIDs
for a while longer, but he is frustrated.
Lower back pain: Without focal
findings, spine imaging does not
help 99% of patients.

Straight Leg Raise
• Cord not compressed
• Nerve root impingement
(radiculopathy)

The patient returns in several months.
His low back pain is gradually

1125/1624

worsening. It is (1) more frequent, (2)
associated with stiffness of the back,
and (3) radiates into his buttocks.
Order:
Lumbosacral spine x-ray
ESR
RF
Anti-CCP
The patient returns in 2 weeks to discuss results and appears happy that
you are taking his pain seriously and
not dismissing him as a malingering
drug-seeker. The immobility and stiffness of his back are worsening, but
are distinctly better with use as the
morning goes on.

1126/1624

An ankylosing spondylitis (AS) diagnosis
is usually delayed by 2 years.

Human Leukocyte Antigen B27 (HLAB27)
• Found in 8% of the general population
• Not a specific diagnostic test

Reports:
Lumbosacral spine x-ray: normal
ESR: elevated
RF: negative
Anti-CCP: negative

1127/1624

ESR is the only blood test that is positive
in AS, but it is nonspecific.

The patient has had symptoms for
about 18 to 24 months at this point.
The SI joint and spine x-ray may be
falsely normal.

What difference does it make if
the diagnosis of AS is made now
or later, since the disease is not
curable?
a. There is no difference.
b. Pain medications can be increased.
c. TNF inhibitors delay progression of the
disease.
d. You can add steroids.

1128/1624

e. You can add sulfasalazine.
Answer c. TNF inhibitors delay progression
of the disease.
TNF inhibitors are of near miraculous benefit for patients with AS. They can stop pain in
those not responsive to NSAIDs. The benefits can be of long duration, essentially delaying disease progression. Sulfasalazine has no
benefit on axial disease. Steroids have no benefit in AS and worsen damage to the bone
because they contribute to osteopenia and
osteoporosis.
NSAIDs are not controlling the patient’s back and buttock pain. The duration of morning stiffness is
increasing.
Orders:

1129/1624

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
of SI joint

MRI is based on tissue water content.

Report:
MRI: narrowing and damage of SI
joint consistent with AS

Which is most common in AS?
a. Anterior uveitis
b. Aortic regurgitation (AR)
c. Atrioventricular (AV) conduction block
d. Enthesopathy

1130/1624

e. Plantar fasciitis
Answer a. Anterior uveitis
All of the manifestations occur in AS. The
most common is anterior uveitis (30–40%).
Cardiac abnormalities (AV block, AR) occur
in 3% to 4% of patients. Enthesopathy is inflammation of tendinous insertion sites. Enthesopathy can present as plantar fasciitis or
“sausage digits” of the fingers and toes.
Schober Test = Immobile “Boardlike”
Lower Spine

Sausage digits are more common in
psoriatic arthritis than in AS.

1131/1624

The mechanism of eye and heart abnormalities is unknown in AS.

Which of the following is most
likely in AS?
a. Obstructive lung disease
b. Restrictive lung disease
c. Apical lung fibrosis
d. Diaphragmatic paralysis
Answer b. Restrictive lung disease
As the chest wall stiffens, it becomes more
and more difficult for patients to breathe in.
Although apical lung fibrosis does occur, it is
not as common as restrictive lung disease.

1132/1624

Spine and rib immobility cause restrictive lung disease.

“Bamboo Spine” = Vertebral
Osteophytes

The patient is started on a TNF inhibitor and experiences a tremendous improvement in pain and mobility. AS is
the only disease for which TNF inhibitors are first-line therapy. In RA and
psoriasis, they are used only after the
failure of other medication.

CASE 3: Sjögren Syndrome

1133/1624

Setting: office
CC: “My eyes are always dry and my
joints hurt.”
VS: normal
HPI: A 50-year-old woman comes to
the office with several months of increasing dryness of her mouth and eyes.
Her eyes are “burning” and “itching”
and sometimes feels like she has a grain
of sand in them. She feels like she has
“dry cotton” in her mouth. She has joint
pain in her knees and ankles.

Tear production is neutrally mediated
through acetylcholine.

PMHX:
Primary biliary cirrhosis

1134/1624

Hypothyroidism
Medications:
Levothyroxine
Artificial tears
PE:
Head, ears, eyes, nose, throat
(HEENT): several lost teeth, dental
caries present

What is the greatest stimulant to
saliva production?
a. Acetylcholine
b. Epinephrine
c. Norepinephrine
d. Nicotinic receptors
Answer a. Acetylcholine

1135/1624

Saliva production is the only part of the body
in which the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system both lead to increased
production of a substance. The greatest stimulant, however, by far, is acetylcholine. The
acetylcholine receptors in the salivary glands
are muscarinic receptors not nicotinic
receptors.

Nicotinic Receptors
• Neuromuscular junction
• Autonomic ganglia
• Central nervous system (CNS)

Which test is most likely to be
positive in Sjögren syndrome?
a. Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
b. Anti-SSA (Ro)

1136/1624

c. Anti-SSB (La)
d. RF
e. Anti-Jo
Answer a. Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
Although the ANA test has no specificity for
Sjögren syndrome, it is the test most commonly found to be positive. Ninety-five percent of patients with Sjögren syndrome
should be positive for ANA, this means the
ANA has an enormously strong negative predictive value for the disorder.

Initial Orders:
ANA
Anti-SSA (Ro)
Anti-SSB (La)
RF

1137/1624

Schirmer test

Saliva pH is high to neutralize acid in
the mouth.
Acid destroys tooth enamel.

Saliva has IgA to protect against
infection.

Lactoferrin in saliva binds iron to
“starve” bacteria of this essential
nutrient.

1138/1624

Continue artificial tears and saliva.
Sugar-free sour candy is useful to increase saliva production because the
sour taste receptors are stronger than
sweet, salt, umami, and bitter taste receptors in producing the highest
volume of saliva.

Normal saliva volume is 1 to 2 liters a
day.

More Acetylcholine = More Saliva

Acetylcholine will
• Increase bicarbonate content

1139/1624

• Increase volume
• Decrease sodium reabsorption

Reports:
ANA, anti-SSA (Ro), anti-SSB (La),
RF: all positive
Schirmer test: decreased tear
production

• Saliva is needed for taste and smell.
• Saliva is hypotonic.

1140/1624

Patients with Sjögren syndrome will
lose their teeth because of multiple
dental caries. Replacing saliva with
artificial saliva and stimulating
salivary flow is important.
Orders:
Artificial tears and saliva
Pilocarpine
Cevimeline
Fluoride oral treatments

How can salivary acetylcholine be
increased?
Pilocarpine = Muscarinic Receptor
Agonist
Cevimeline = Acetylcholine Analogue

1141/1624

What is the most specific test of
Sjögren syndrome?
a. Anti-SSA
b. Lip biopsy
c. Schirmer test
d. Anti-SSB
Answer b. Lip biopsy
Lip biopsy shows the foci of lymphoid cells in
salivary gland tissue in the accessory salivary
glands. This is more specific than any serologic test.
The pilocarpine, cevimeline, and artificial tears improve symptoms immediately. The patient returns in a week
because dry eyes still bother her.
Orders:

1142/1624

Cyclosporine eyedrops
Counseling about possible development of lymphoma

Cyclosporine:
• Inhibits lymphocyte activation
• Immunosuppressant
• Calcineurin inhibitor

Saliva
• Seventh and ninth cranial nerve
control
• Slower Flow = More Sodium
Reabsorption

1143/1624

Cevimeline is more active at the M1 and
M3 receptors of the salivary and lacrimal
glands.
Cevimeline is less active at the cardiac
acetylcholine receptors.

Which of these impairs taste
perception in Sjögren syndrome?
a. Loss of amylase and lipase
b. Loss of salivary protease
c. Increased lysozyme
d. Increased lactoperoxidase
Answer a. Loss of amylase and lipase
Salivary amylase and lipase break down
enough starch and fat to increase taste perception of food. There is no normal salivary
protease. Lysozyme and lactoperoxidase are

1144/1624

decreased, but they kill bacteria and have
nothing to do with taste perception.

Adverse Effects of Pilocarpine and
Cevimeline
• Diarrhea
• Bronchospasm
• Bradycardia

Mechanism of Adverse Effect
• Overstimulation of muscarinic
receptors

1145/1624

The patient’s symptoms of oral dryness
and eye dryness are improved. There is
little therapy for the joint pain.
Orders:
Educate and advise the patient to
avoid cola, coffee, and tea.
Order a dental evaluation.
Educate and advise the patient regarding diligent oral care.

• Acid destroys teeth.
• The pH of cola is pH 2.5.
• Bacteria make acid.

CASE 4: Gout

1146/1624

Setting: emergency department
CC: “My toe hurts real bad!”
VS: BP: 144/94 mm Hg; P: 96 beats/
minute; T: 102°F; R: 18 breaths/minute

Pain can cause hypertension and
tachycardia.

HPI: A 34-year-old Asian man arrives at the emergency department
with the acute onset of severe pain in
the great toe of his right foot that developed over a few hours. He had one
episode like this before a few months
ago but never went to the hospital because of being uninsured at that time.
He took an over-the-counter NSAID

1147/1624

and it got better in a day or two.
Today the pain came on very suddenly, and his toe is clearly red and
warm.
PMHx/Medications: none
PE:
General: uncomfortable man, in pain
trying to stay immobile
Extremities: Great toe of right foot is
warm, red, and extremely tender.
Overlying skin is tense (Figure 8-3).
HEENT: no tophi
Skin: no tophi
Tophi = Gout

1148/1624

Figure 8-3. Podagra denotes gouty inflammation of the
first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. Note the swelling
and erythema. (Reproduced with permission from Kevin J.
Knoop, MD, MS.)

Tophi
• Deposits of monosodium urate crystals
• Foreign body reaction

Initial Orders:
Arthrocentesis
Ibuprofen

1149/1624

Basic metabolic panel (CHEM-7)
Uric acid level

Acute gout and septic joints can look
very similar.

Men have higher uric acid levels.
Gout is more common in men than in
women.

Reports:
Synovial fluid cell count: WBCs
44,000/μL; 80% neutrophils; Gramstain negative

1150/1624

CHEM-7: blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
21 g/dL (elevated); creatinine 1.8
mg/dL (elevated)
Uric acid level: 7.2 mg/dL (The normal level for men is 2.4–7.4 mg/dL.)

• Uric acid levels are normal in 25% of
acute gout attacks.
• Uric acid level decreases from precipitation as crystals in an acute attack.

The cell count is 39,000/μL,
predominantly neutrophils, and
the uric acid level is normal. What
is the appropriate approach for
this patient?
a. Treat the gout.

1151/1624

b. Treat the infectious arthritis.
c. Treat both the gout and infectious
arthritis.
d. Wait for definitive tests to treat.
e. Give intraarticular antibiotics only.
Answer c. Treat both the gout and infectious arthritis.
The patient’s cell count is in a range equivocal for gout and infectious arthritis, the Gram
stain shows no organisms, and the uric acid
level is normal.
Infectious arthritis:
• Cell count: usually >50,000 to 100,000/μL
• Stain: 50% to 70% sensitive
• Culture: 90% sensitive, but takes 2 to 3
days
Gout:
• Cell count: 20,000 to 50,000/μL

1152/1624

• Uric acid level: normal in 25% of patients
Gout attacks are extremely painful. When
the diagnosis is unclear, it is best to order
treatment for both infectious arthritis and
gout until the crystal analysis is done. Intraarticular antibiotics are never needed for
septic arthritis. All antibiotics will pass into
the joint fluid.

Synovial lining has no basement
membrane.
All antibiotics pass into the synovial
fluid.

Orders:
Crystal analysis by polarized light
microscopy

1153/1624

Ceftriaxone and vancomycin IV
Rheumatology evaluation
Intraarticular triamcinolone

Do not use NSAIDs in patients with renal insufficiency.

• Prostaglandins dilate the afferent
arteriole.
• NSAIDs cause vasoconstriction of the
afferent arteriole.
• NSAIDs cause papillary necrosis.

Report:

1154/1624

Crystal analysis: positive for negatively birefringent needle-shaped
crystals

Acute Gout
• Monocytes and synoviocytes ingest uric acid crystals.
• They get inflamed.

The patient continues to have extremely severe pain for the next 4 to 6
hours. As you move the clock forward
reexamine the patient and do an “Interval History.” If steroids work, they
will do so after about 6 hours, the
same as they do in an acute asthma

1155/1624

exacerbation. If there is a contraindication to NSAID use such as renal insufficiency or active ulcer disease, use
steroids.

Steroids and Acute Gout
• Single joint: inject
• Multiple joints: IV or oral

As the clock moves to 12 to 24 hours
after the injection of triamcinolone,
there is marked improvement in
symptoms. The toe is less red, less
warm, and less febrile.

1156/1624

Acute gout causes fever.

When is colchicine the answer for
gout?
a. Never
b. As an alternative to NSAIDs for acute gout
c. As first-line preventive therapy
d. As an alternative to xanthine oxidase inhibitors in prevention
Answer d. As an alternative to xanthine oxidase inhibitors in prevention
Colchicine is no longer used to treat acute
gout. Acute gout is treated with NSAIDs, and
if there is renal insufficiency or ulcer disease,
with steroids. Colchicine is an alternative to
xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as

1157/1624

allopurinol or febuxostat in preventing gout
attacks.

Colchicine inhibits microtubule
formation.

Orders:
CHEM-7
Uric acid level

Never start allopurinol during an acute
gout attack!

1158/1624

In questioning the patient about
the food he’s eaten, what is most
likely to have caused the acute
attack?
a. Milk and cheese
b. Steak and beer
c. Butter and eggs
d. Gluten (wheat)-containing foods
Answer b. Steak and beer
Red meat, beer, and seafood have the highest
purine content. Dairy products decrease the
risk of gouty attack. Milk, butter, and eggs
are low-purine foods.

Vegetables with rapid growth have high
purine content:
• Asparagus

1159/1624

• Spinach
• Peas, lentils

Alcohol increases uric acid production.

Report:
CHEM-7: BUN 25 g/dL (elevated);
creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (elevated)
Uric acid level: 7.8 mg/dL (The normal level for men is 2.4–7.4 mg/dL.)

What is the mechanism of renal
dysfunction in gout?
a. Vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole
b. Urate crystal deposition in the medulla
and pyramids

1160/1624

c. Obstructive renal stones
d. Inhibition of filtration at the glomerulus
e. Excess filtration at the glomerulus
Answer b. Urate crystal deposition in the
medulla and pyramids
Renal insufficiency is directly proportional to
the height of a person’s uric acid levels. The
higher the uric acid level, the more uric acid
will deposit in the kidney and form stones.
Uric acid has no effect on filtration or on the
vasculature.

Drugs That Cause Gout Attacks
• Thiazides
• Niacin

1161/1624

Move the clock forward. Once pain has
improved, you can send the patient
home and have him come back for an
office visit. In several weeks, recheck
the uric acid level and start uric
acid–lowering medications.
Order:
Allopurinol orally
Uric acid level
Move the clock forward 1 week and
recheck uric acid levels. Seeing the
patient right after the start of allopurinol is the correct approach
because
Allopurinol hypersensitivity (rash,
renal failure) is common.
Xanthine oxidase inhibitors can precipitate acute gout attacks.

1162/1624

Colchicine to prevent an attack on
starting allopurinol is an acceptable
use of colchicine.
If the uric acid level is not controlled
on allopurinol, then switch allopurinol
to febuxostat. If febuxostat is not controlling the patient, add an uricase
medication. Pegloticase metabolizes
uric acid to allantoin.

Pegloticase
• It is an uricase.
• It metabolizes uric acid to allantoin.
• Allantoin is easily excreted by the
kidneys.

Probenecid

1163/1624

• Increases urinary excretion of uric acid
• Not effective with low urine flow or
renal insufficiency

If on moving the case forward, kidney
stones are described, the treatment is to
alkalinize the urine. Calcium oxalate
stones form in an alkaline urine, but
uric acid stones dissolve in alkaline
urine.

Urine acid solubility increases with urine pH >6.0.

CASE 5: Osteoarthritis

1164/1624

Setting: office
CC: “My knees hurt.”
VS: normal
HPI: A 64-year-old man comes to your
office complaining of worsening pain
and discomfort in his knees. This has
been happening gradually over the past
year. He claims “to hear them creaking”
when he gets up from a seated position.
He has pain in his hands in multiple
joints. His grip strength is down and he
has a hard time opening the lids of jars
and twisting the knobs on water
faucets. All the pain is definitely worse
toward the end of the day and with increased use.
Worsening with Use = Osteoarthritis
(OA)
Better with Use = Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

1165/1624

ROS:
The patient has no fever and no
weight loss.
He denies injection drug use.
Discomfort makes him avoidant of
exercise.
PMHX:
Hypertension
Former tobacco smoker
Medications:
NSAIDs
Nifedipine

Medications do not cause OA.
Medications do not prevent OA.

1166/1624

PE:
General: obese; cheerful as long as he
does not move
Musculoskeletal:
Prominent tuberosities of the distal
interphalangeal (DIP) joints
Crepitus palpable on movement of
knees
No warmth, no redness, no
tenderness
DIP Joints Affected = OA or Psoriatic
Arthritis
Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) and MCP
Joints Affected = RA
Spine and SI Affected = AS
Single Large Joint Affected = Septic or Lyme

1167/1624

Articular cartilage is composed mostly of
water.

Initial Orders:
X-ray
ESR, RF, CRP, ANA
Complete blood count (CBC)
CHEM-7

Which of these will be abnormal
in OA?
a. None
b. X-ray of knees and hands
c. ESR, RF, CRP, ANA
d. CBC
e. CHEM-7

1168/1624

Answer a. None
You are not doing these tests because you expect anything to be abnormal in OA. Quite
the opposite. You are doing these tests because if any of them is abnormal it is likely
not OA! The reason for the CHEM-7 test is to
be careful about the use of NSAIDs in those
with renal insufficiency. The CBC is looking
for a microcytic anemia that may have been
caused by an occult ulcer. Although daily
NSAID use leads to an ulcer in 10% to 20%
of patients after a year, only half (5–10%)
will be symptomatic and half of them (1–3%)
will bleed from it.

What should all users of NSAIDs
be taking along with the NSAIDs?
a. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
b. H2-blocker
c. Misoprostol

1169/1624

d. None
e. Sucralfate
Answer d. None
Although daily PPI use (e.g., omeprazole)
will decrease the risk of ulcers, there is no
routine recommendation to put every NSAID
user on a PPI. H2-blockers, such as cimetidine or sucralfate, which coat the gastric lining, are even less effective. Misoprostol is
never the right answer for anything in
gastroenterology.

Misoprostol
• Increases prostaglandins
• Supposed to increase gastric mucous
production
• Nice basic science idea
• Does not work

1170/1624

The patient returns to discuss his
laboratory test results the following
week. He has no change in symptoms.
Reports:
ANA, RF, CRP, CHEM-7, CBC:
normal
X-ray: joint space narrowing,
osteophytes

Be careful of nonspecific laboratory
tests!
• ANA is positive in 5% of the
population.
• RF increases with age.

1171/1624

CCS is more “liberal” or “forgiving”
with the amount of testing you can order. In this case, getting some “extra
tests” like the CHEM-7, ANA, or RF
would be forgiven. On a single best
answer question about OA, do not order any tests.

Joint Space Narrowing (Figure 8-4)
• There is loss of articular cartilage.
• Articular cartilage is water.
• Water is radiolucent.

1172/1624

Figure 8-4. Radiograph of a hand showing osteoarthritis
of the distal interphalangeal (DIP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and first carpometacarpal (CMC) joints. Note the
joint-space narrowing of the DIP and PIP joints compared
to the metacarpophalangeal joints, as well as the bony sclerosis (eburnation) of all joints involved by the osteoarthritis
process. (Reproduced with permission from Imboden JB, et
al. Current Diagnosis & Treatment: Rheumatology, 3rd ed.
New York: McGraw-Hill; 2013.)

Osteophytes

1173/1624

• They are caused by asymptomatic
widening of the articular contact area.
• They “spread the load.”
• Weak bone needs more surface area.

What is the best pain medication
for OA?
a. Acetaminophen
b. Ibuprofen
c. Indomethacin
d. Chondroitin sulfate
e. Glucosamine
Answer a. Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen has an equivalent analgesic
capacity to NSAIDs but no adverse effects on
the gastrointestinal system. Indomethacin is
an NSAID that with chronic use will

1174/1624

practically burn a hole in your stomach. Indomethacin
should
never
be
used
chronically.
Glucosamine + Chondroitin = Placebo

You switch the patient from an NSAID
to acetaminophen.
Orders:
Advise weight loss.
Advise exercise and weight training.
Consult physical therapy.

Weight loss will decrease force on joints.
Strengthening muscles decreases work
on joints.

1175/1624

The patient comes to see you every few
months for blood pressure (BP) management. He comes to see you on a
Monday morning after his knee becomes worse after going hiking with
his grandchildren.
PE:
Worsening redness and crepitans of
knee
Orders:
Hyaluronic acid injection
Intraarticular triamcinolone
Orthopedic surgery evaluation

• Hyaluronic acid and steroid injection
helps relieve pain but lasts for a short
time.

1176/1624

• Hyaluronic acid increases synovial fluid volume and buoyancy.

Move the clock forward an hour after
the injections of steroids and hyaluronic acid. On the Interval History, there is
significant improvement in pain and
discomfort. Ultimately, there is no
medical therapy to reverse the process
of OA. Losing weight decreases the
stress on the knees and ankles. Exercise
will strengthen the muscles around the
joint to bear more of the load. Both of
these interventions can slow the process of deterioration, but cannot reverse it. Eventually, more than 100,000
people a year in the United States alone
need knee replacement. When the patient gets to the point where relief of

1177/1624

pain and immobility requires steroid
and hyaluronic acid injections, referral
should be made for replacement of the
affected joint.

CASE 6: Scleroderma
Setting: office
CC: “My face and hands are getting
tight.”
VS: BP: 152/94 mm Hg; P: 86 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R: 22 breaths/minute
HPI: A 43-year-old woman with progressive immobility of her fingers and
tightening of her face visits you in your
office. She is also somewhat short of
breath but only with two to three blocks
of exertion. She does not notice the

1178/1624

dyspnea often because joint pain makes
her avoid walking.
PMHX:
Hypertension
Raynaud disease
Medications:
Nifedipine
PE:
Chest: fine crepitations throughout
Extremities: sclerodactyly, edema of
lower extremities
Skin: tightening at face and hand, no
Raynaud disease now; some telangiectasia present

Which of the following tests is
most likely to be positive?
a. SCL-70

1179/1624

b. Anti-centromere antibody
c. ANA
d. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody
(ANCA)
e. Anti-Jo
Answer c. ANA
As with many autoimmune disorders, ANA is
most likely to be positive, but has no specificity. ANA is positive in 80% to 95% of
those with scleroderma, which gives it a false
negative rate of only 5% to 15%. Anti-Jo reveals lung involvement in polymyositis and
dermatomyositis.

1180/1624

Calcinosis: mechanism unknown
Sclerodactyly: mechanism unknown

Scleroderma + High BP = AngiotensinConverting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors

Initial Orders:
SCL-70
ANA
Chest x-ray
Oximeter
CHEM-7, CBC
Enalapril

Nifedipine is best for Raynaud disease.

1181/1624

SCL-70 is an antibody against topoisomerase III.

See the patient as soon as possible
after starting the ACE inhibitor.
Chemistry should be checked to see
there is no worsening of renal
function.
Interval History: “Patient has epigastric pain going into chest with sore
throat and bad taste in mouth.”
VS: BP: 124/84 mm Hg on enalapril
On CCS, you cannot order medications
by class. You have to write “enalapril”
or “lisinopril.” You cannot just order
“ACE inhibitor.” Do not worry about
spelling. CCS automatically checks

1182/1624

spelling and asks if you are sure that is
the drug or test you wanted.
Reports:
SCL-70: positive
ANA: positive
Chest x-ray: normal
Oximeter: 96% saturation on room
air
CHEM-7, CBC: normal except slight
anemia; hematocrit 34%; mean corpuscular value (MCV) normal; no
eosinophilia

Eosinophilic Fasciitis

1183/1624

Eosinophils =
Treat with Steroids

Inform the patient she likely has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Patients with scleroderma have the
skin manifestations before the internal
organ involvement.

What is the main difference
between CREST and scleroderma?
a. GERD
b. Telangiectasia
c. Lung and heart
d. Pulmonary hypertension
e. Calcinosis and sclerodactyly

1184/1624

Answer c. Lung and heart
Scleroderma or progressive systemic sclerosis has all the manifestations of CREST and
also has the involvement of several internal
organs. Scleroderma involves the heart,
lungs, and kidneys. CREST has a primary
pulmonary hypertension, but the lung parenchyma itself is normal. In scleroderma, the
pulmonary hypertension is secondary to lung
fibrosis. Both disorders have joint pain and
skin manifestations.

Scleroderma has:
• Renal
• Heart
• Lung

1185/1624

Orders:
Omeprazole
Continue ACE inhibitor and
nifedipine
Although the underlying pathology
and disease progression of scleroderma are not an emergency, the
symptoms of GERD, elevated BP, and
Raynaud disease can be controlled.
Interval History: “Epigastric pain
and bad taste in mouth are improved
on PPIs; BP 124/78 mm Hg.”

Which manifestation of
scleroderma can be slowed with
treatment?
a. Calcinosis and sclerodactyly
b. Pulmonary fibrosis

1186/1624

c. Renal fibrosis
d. Cardiac fibrosis
Answer b. Pulmonary fibrosis
We do not have a clear treatment to stop the
progression of skin calcinosis or sclerodactyly. Pulmonary fibrosis may be slowed with
cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate. Although we use ACE inhibitors for renal hypertensive crisis, this is not the same as controlling the primary renal fibrosis or the cardiac fibrosis. Pulmonary hypertension can be
treated with bosentan and the prostacyclin
analogues epoprostenol, treprostinil, and iloprost. Overall, treatment in scleroderma is
extremely frustrating. We have symptomatic
therapy for Raynaud disease (i.e., calcium
channel blockers) and GERD but no clear
drugs to stop the underlying pathology of the
skin, heart, or kidneys.

1187/1624

Orders:
Pulmonary function testing

Penicillamine is not effective in controlling calcinosis.

Bosentan inhibits endothelin-1.

Prostacyclin dilates pulmonary
vasculature.

The patient returns for discussion of
her pulmonary function tests (PFTs).

1188/1624

Symptoms of dyspnea slowly
progress.

PFT Report:
Decreased forced expiratory volume
at 1 second (FEV1); decreased forced
vital capacity (FVC)
Decreased residual volume; decreased total lung capacity

Which of the following is the most
accurate test of lung involvement?
a. PFTs
b. Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon
monoxide (DLCO)
c. Lung biopsy

1189/1624

d. Right-sided heart catheterization response to vasodilators
e. High-resolution chest computed tomography (CT)
Answer c. Lung biopsy
Pulmonary involvement is present in 70% of
those with scleroderma. Lung biopsy is
simply the most accurate of all these methods at establishing a diagnosis. Right-sided
heart catheterization may be useful to assess
response to vasodilatory treatment, but it is
not a direct assessment of interstitial lung
disease. This is how you are going to tell the
need for cyclophosphamide.
The patient undergoes PFTs, high-resolution CT, and ultimately lung biopsy.
A trial of cyclophosphamide and
bosentan is made. Ultimately, scleroderma does shorten lifespan, but there

1190/1624

is no clear therapy to reverse any
manifestation on a permanent basis.

CASE 7: PolymyositisDermatomyositis
Setting: office
CC: “I just can’t get up out of a chair
without using my arms.”
VS: BP:118/74 mm Hg; P: 72 beats/
minute; T: normal; R: normal
HPI: A 29-year-old woman comes to
the office with several months of progressively worsening muscle weakness.
She delayed coming to see you because
she just thought it was fatigue and
tiredness from working a lot. Over the
past week, the weakness worsened to

1191/1624

the point where she needs to use her
arms to get up out of a chair. The
muscles are not painful. Joint pain is
present.
“I can’t get up from my seat without
using my arms!” = Proximal Muscle
Weakness

PMHX: rash on hands and neck
Medications: none

Which of these is usually not
painful?
a. Fibromyalgia
b. Polymyositis
c. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)
d. Rhabdomyolysis

1192/1624

Answer b. Polymyositis
Polymyositis-dermatomyositis (PM-DM) is
an autoimmune myopathy characterized by
weakness in nearly patient, but with pain in
<25% of patients. Fibromyalgia and PMR
are, by definition, pain disorders. That’s
what the word “fibromyalgia” means,
“fibrous muscle pain.” As PM-DM progresses, some people develop pain later.

PE:
No fever.
Skin: red-purple rash around her
eyes.
Chest: clear to auscultation, Vshaped red rash at top of chest.
Extremities: rough patches on backs
of hands.
Musculoskeletal: weakness of
shoulders, hips, and girdle; patient

1193/1624

cannot easily get up from a seated
position without using her hands;
muscles are not tender.

Fibromyalgia:
• Focal tenderness
• “Trigger points”
• 100% normal laboratory test results

PMR
• Age >50 years
• Nontender
• ESR high, creatine phosphokinase
(CPK) level normal

1194/1624

Initial Orders:
CPK
Aldolase
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
ESR
ANA

What is the difference between
polymyositis (PM) and
dermatomyositis (DM)?
a. ANA positivity
b. Aldolase
c. Skin finding
d. Response to steroids
e. LDH level
Answer c. Skin finding

1195/1624

On presentation, there is no difference
between PM and DM. They both have positive ANA and elevated aldolase, CPK, and
LDH levels, and they both respond to steroids. There is a difference on pathologic finding on biopsy, but nothing is different on
physical findings or symptoms besides skin
findings. DM has a vasculopathy with terminal complements C5 to C9 around the vessels. PM has lymphocytes accumulated in
muscle fascicles.

Dermatomyositis: C5-C9 around vessels
Polymyositis: lymphocytes around
muscle fascicles

DM Skin Effects
• Gottron papules: hands

1196/1624

• Shawl: neck
• Heliotrope: eyes

The patient comes in 3 days to discuss
laboratory test results. Muscle weakness is interfering with her ability to
navigate train station stairs and
travel to your office.
Reports:
CPK: 2450 units/L (elevated)
Aldolase: elevated
ESR: 84 mm/h
ANA: positive
LDH, AST: elevated

1197/1624

Aldolase = Muscle damage
Nonspecific

Which is the most accurate test of
dermatomyositis?
a. Muscle biopsy
b. Electromyography (EMG)
c. Anti-Jo
d. Skin biopsy
Answer a. Muscle biopsy
Although skin involvement is the hallmark of
dermatomyositis, the most accurate test is a
muscle biopsy. EMG is generally recommended even though it is not as specific as a
muscle biopsy.

1198/1624

CCS is more “forgiving” on ordering tests.
On CCS, get the ANA, AST, ANA, EMG, and
ESR.
For single-best-answer questions,
Proximal Weakness without Pain =
PM-DM = CPK and Aldolase = Muscle
Biopsy

Orders:
EMG
Prednisone orally
Rheumatology consultation if not
done
Consult rheumatology on all rheumatologic disorders except OA and gout.

1199/1624

Weakness + CPK and Aldolase Elevation
= Enough to Start Therapy

Steroids are the mainstay of PM-DM
treatment.

Which of these factors is different
in comparing PM with DM?
a. Use of azathioprine
b. Incidence of cancer
c. Dysphagia
d. Lung fibrosis
Answer b. Incidence of cancer
Dermatomyositis confers the risk of cancer
much more than polymyositis. Both of them
are treated with azathioprine or MTX if

1200/1624

steroids are not effective. Both confer a risk
of lung fibrosis. Both of them can cause dysphagia. PM and DM are identical on muscle
involvement.

On CCS, always do an Interval History a few days after the start of therapy that should improve symptoms.
Always confirm symptomatic
improvement.
Move the clock forward 3 to 4 days.
Interval history: “Improved muscle
weakness. Able to walk up stairs and
get up from a seated position without
the use of her arms.”
PE: hip, shoulder, and quadriceps
flexion and extension
Report:

1201/1624

EMG: abnormal, possible inflammatory myopathy

EMG can reveal the presence of a
primary muscle disorder.
EMG cannot specify which disorder the
patient has.

Orders:
Muscle biopsy
Muscle biopsy is consistent with
dermatomyositis. Continue the patient
on steroids and follow up in a few
weeks.
Order:

1202/1624

Anti-Jo antibody

• Anti-Jo = Lung Involvement Possible
• It is not clear what to do if Anti-Jo is
positive.

The patient returns in 2 weeks. She
has developed dysphagia and her
muscle strength is somewhat worse.
Orders:
Continue prednisone.
Add azathioprine.
Add trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(TMP-SMZ).
Order a colonoscopy.
Order a mammography.

1203/1624

Dysphagia
• Muscle weakness
• Proximal third of the esophagus
• Skeletal muscle

Screen DM patients for cancer.

TMP-SMZ
• Pneumocystis prophylaxis
• For chronic steroid use
• Especially with steroid-azathioprine
combination

After 2 to 4 weeks, there is an improvement in muscle strength.

1204/1624

What will you add to treatment if
there is worsening on steroids and
azathioprine?
a. MTX
b. Rituximab
c. Androgens
d. 6-Mercaptopurine
Answer b. Rituximab
You continue the patient on both medications for now. It is not clear what to do next.
Rituximab is, at present, considered the best
of the alternative immunosuppressant medications for those with steroid-resistant PMDM. MTX is an alternative to azathioprine
and would never be added. Androgens are
not effective for PM-DM.
6-Mercaptopurine is a metabolite of azathioprine. It is, essentially, the same drug
with the same effect. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is an alternative to

1205/1624

rituximab. Other alternatives to add later
are:
• Cyclosporine or tacrolimus
• Cyclophosphamide
The treatment of steroid-resistant PM-DM is
difficult and unclear. You would not need to
know more than:
1. Steroids are given first.
2. Add azathioprine or MTX if steroids are
not effective.
3. Rituximab may help later.

The extent of cancer screening is not
clear.
Exclude:
• Colon
• Breast

1206/1624

• Ovary

CASE 8: Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus
Setting: emergency department
CC: “My urine is dark, and I am so tired
all the time.”
VS: BP: 160/95 mm Hg; P: 85 beats/
minute; T: 101.4°F; R: 18 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 23-year-old woman is brought
by her family on a one-way ticket to
New York City from out of the country
because of urine and fatigue for the past
few months. She had been told she had
renal damage and needed a kidney

1207/1624

biopsy but was not able to have it done.
She is extremely fatigued with joint
pain. She has had several spontaneous
abortions and is very concerned about
her ability to have children.
PMHX:
G2 P0020
Alopecia
Hypertension
Social History: visitor from Haiti who
claims to be a medical student
Medications:
Ibuprofen
Hydralazine
PE:
General: tired, uncomfortable, sullen,
and angry appearing
Skin: alopecia of scalp, no facial
lesions

1208/1624

HEENT: oral ulcers present
Chest: clear
Cardiovascular: normal
Musculoskeletal: no joint deformity
Initial Orders:
Urinalysis (UA)
ANA
Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
CBC
CHEM-7

Which is the most specific test for
systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE)?
a. ANA
b. Anti-dsDNA
c. Anti-Sm
d. Complement C3 and C4 levels
e. Anti-Ro (SSA)

1209/1624

Answer c. Anti-Sm
The only test for lupus (SLE) that is more
specific than the dsDNA is the anti-Smith or
anti-Sm antibody. Anti-Sm is present in only
20% to 30% of patients, but it is very useful
to diagnose SLE in those with a positive ANA
whose anti-dsDNA is negative. SLE can be a
very difficult diagnosis to establish in patients. There is no one single presentation or
physical finding that is pathognomonic for
the disorder. You must combine at least four
findings to consider a person to have SLE.

Reports:
UA: proteinuria 300 (3+), red blood
cells (RBCs) and RBC casts present
ANA: positive at 1:160
dsDNA: positive

1210/1624

CBC: WBC 12,400/μL (elevated);
hematocrit 32%; MCV 86 fL; platelets 156,000/μL
CHEM-7: BUN 28 g/dL (elevated);
creatinine 2.4 mg/dL

Fever can be from lupus alone.

What is needed to confirm lupus
in this patient?
a. Renal biopsy
b. Nothing
c. Bone marrow biopsy
d. Anti-Sm
e. Complement levels
Answer b. Nothing

1211/1624

This patient already has enough information
to be diagnosed with SLE.
• Joint pain
• Renal involvement
• Oral ulcers
• ANA positive
• dsDNA positive
• Anemia

Only 4 of the 11 criteria for SLE are
needed to establish a diagnosis of
lupus. A renal biopsy is the most accurate test of lupus nephritis, but we
already know she has renal involvement. A bone marrow biopsy is not
needed. Any level of hematologic involvement is enough to be one of the
criteria. It can be low levels of WBCs
or platelets, or anemia.

1212/1624

Anti-Sm
• It is the best test when dsDNA is
negative.
• It is the most specific of all SLE tests.
• It is present in only 20% to 30% of
patients.

Which test is used to determine
that increased disease activity
(lupus flare) is present?
a. Increasing ANA
b. Decreasing complement level, increased
dsDNA
c. Increasing anti-Sm
d. Rising urine protein level and decreasing
hematocrit level
Answer b. Decreasing complement, increased dsDNA

1213/1624

Only two tests reliably determine if a sudden
worsening of disease is from SLE. If the complement (C3 and C4) level is dropping or the
dsDNA is increasing, this is the only clear
laboratory evidence of a lupus flare.

SLE Skin Disease
• Malar rash
• Discoid lupus
• Oral ulcers
• Photosensitivity

Which is the most common
hematologic manifestation of
SLE?
a. Increasing WBC count
b. Anemia of chronic disease
c. Hemolysis

1214/1624

d. Thrombocytopenia
Answer b. Anemia of chronic disease
Anemia of chronic disease is more common
than hemolysis in SLE. When there is WBC
involvement, it is usually a decrease in WBC
count, not an increase.

The patient is very tired and frustrated about her disease. The oral ulcers bother her, as well as her fatigue
and reproductive issues.

What is next in the management
of this patient?
a. Renal biopsy
b. Prednisone
c. Prednisone and cyclophosphamide
d. Belimumab

1215/1624

e. Hydroxychloroquine
Answer b. Prednisone
You do not need to wait for the results of a
renal biopsy to give steroids. The patient will
experience an immediate improvement in fatigue, cell counts, oral ulcers, and kidney involvement with steroids. You should not add
additional immunosuppressive medication
for lupus nephritis without a renal biopsy.
Cyclophosphamide can cause hemorrhagic
cystitis and bladder cancer and should not be
used until you know precisely what type of
renal disease you have. Hydroxychloroquine
is for skin lesions only. Belimumab is an inhibitor of B-cell lymphocyte function. Belimumab is used when there is recurrent disease
or the disease is refractory to steroids. Belimumab is the first new drug for SLE in
nearly 50 years, but has limited efficacy.

1216/1624

Belimumab inhibits B-cell activating
factor.

The patient is started on prednisone,
and a renal biopsy is requested.

Joint x-ray is normal in SLE.

Why get a renal biopsy?
a. To prove that lupus nephritis is present
b. To determine the extent of treatment
c. To determine that RBC casts are not from
lupus nephritis

1217/1624

Answer b. To determine the extent of
treatment
The patient has lupus renal involvement, but
you do not know if steroids alone are enough
therapy or if either mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide is needed. The only way to determine if there is advanced-stage disease
with proliferative glomerulonephropathy is
with biopsy. A biopsy determines the need
for additional therapy to steroids.

A renal biopsy is performed. Also,
anyone with multiple first-trimester or
one second-trimester spontaneous
abortions needs evaluation for antiphospholipid (APL) syndrome.
Orders:
Continue prednisone

1218/1624

Prothrombin time (PT), activated
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)
Anticardiolipin antibodies

Venereal Disease Research Laboratory
(VDRL) False Positive
• Fluorescent treponemal antibody
(FTA) is negative.
• It is not needed if APL testing is to be
done.
• It is the same as anticardiolipin antibody testing.

Reports:
Renal biopsy: proliferative membranous glomerulonephritis
PT normal; aPTT prolonged

1219/1624

Anticardiolipin antibody present

VDRL is a cardiolipin.

Drug-induced lupus does not have
renal or cerebral manifestations.

What do you do for the next
pregnancy?
a. Recommend an abortion.
b. Give aspirin and heparin.
c. Give warfarin.
d. Give prednisone.
e. Give belimumab.
Answer b. Give aspirin and heparin.

1220/1624

Aspirin and heparin therapy during the pregnancy is the standard of care for antiphospholipid syndromes such as anticardiolipin
antibody or lupus anticoagulant causing
spontaneous abortion. They are both treated
the same way.

Prolonged aPTT
• Does not correct with mixing study.
• False positive results in VDRL testing.
• Russel viper venom test for lupus
anticoagulant.

Drug-Induced Lupus
• Spares brain
• Spares kidney

1221/1624

As you move the clock forward, prednisone will have an effect in a day or
two. You do not have to keep the patient in the hospital to await the results
of the biopsy.

CHAPTER 9

1224/1624

ONCOLOGY
CASE 1: Breast Cancer
Setting: office
CC: “My mammogram showed a lump.”
VS: normal
HPI: A 44-year-old woman who just
had a mammogram that showed an abnormality comes to the office to find
what the next step is. The patient’s
mother and sister both had breast cancer so when she went to a random
“health fair” in her neighborhood, she
was advised to get a mammogram
earlier than age 50. She feels well.

1225/1624

At what age is mammographic
screening recommended for the
general population?
a. At 35 years
b. At 40 years
c. At 50 years
Answer c. At 50 years
For women at average risk, screening mammography is recommended to begin by the
age of 50 years. This patient should have
been screened starting at least by age 40
years because of the very significant family
history. A woman in the general population
has a risk of 12% to 14% (1 in 9) without any
family history. With two first-degree relatives, her risk is closer to 40% to 45%.

First-Degree Relatives

1226/1624

• Siblings
• Parents

PMHx/Medications: none
PE: normal

With her family history of breast
cancer, besides starting screening
early, which would be best to have
prevented having breast cancer?
a. Breast cancer antigen (BRCA) testing
b. Tamoxifen
c. Breast ultrasound (US)
d. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
e. Self-examination once a month

1227/1624

Answer b. Tamoxifen
Tamoxifen and raloxifene prevent breast
cancer from ever occurring in the first place.
These selective estrogen receptor modulators
(SERMs) give a 50% reduction in the risk of
breast cancer. They are used in those with
two first-degree relatives who are at much
higher risk of breast cancer than the general
population. Breast US is used when a lump is
detected in a younger, premenopausal patient and it is not clear if the lesion is solid or
cystic. Breast MRI is useful in evaluating
firm breasts with unusual architecture, but it
is not clear that MRI is definitely better than
mammogram. BRCA testing does not prevent cancer. BRCA is associated with the 10%
of patients with familial breast cancer, but in
this patient, we already know she is at high
risk of cancer. In terms of the breast, it is not
clear what BRCA offers.
SERMs stop cancer. BRCA tells risks
without a clear therapeutic path.

1228/1624

Tamoxifen prevents breast cancer in
high-risk patients.

BRCA testing benefit is not clear.

Initial Orders:
Needle aspiration biopsy

SERMs
• Antagonistic at breast
• Agonistic at:
Bone
Endometrium
Clotting factors

1229/1624

What is the absolute increase in
risk of endometrial cancer after
using a SERM for 5 years in 1000
women?
a. 1
b. 10
c. 100
d. 200
Answer a. 1
The absolute increase in the risk of endometrial cancer is about one new cancer over
5 years in 1000 treated women. Without
SERMs, 1/1000 women get endometrial cancer in 5 years. With a SERM, it is 2/1000
women.
If you have a 40% risk of breast cancer in
a high-risk person, that would be 400 breast
cancers in 1000 women. With a SERM (e.g.,
tamoxifen) the number drops to 200. So,

1230/1624

bottom line, you have one more endometrial
cancer, and 200 less breast cancers.
SERMs decrease breast cancer risk
much more than increase endometrial
cancer risk.

Tamoxifen stimulates osteoblasts.

The patient returns after the breast
biopsy, which shows infiltrating
ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast.
Report:
Estrogen receptor (ER) positive
Progesterone receptor (PR) positive
No cancer on mammography of other breast

1231/1624

HER2/Neu antigen increased

Trastuzumab
• Monoclonal antibody
• Removes HER2/Neu positive cells
• Negligible adverse effects
• Prevents metastases

Which of the following should be
done next?
a. Axillary lymph node dissection
b. Sentinel node biopsy
c. Bone marrow biopsy
d. Lumbar puncture
Answer b. Sentinel node biopsy

1232/1624

The “sentinel” node is the first node in the
operative field (Figure 9-1). If this node
shows no cancer, you do not need to do an
axillary lymph node dissection. There is no
need to do bone marrow biopsy or lumbar
puncture in the routine preoperative or prechemotherapy evaluation of breast cancer.
To find the sentinel node, contrast is put into
the operative field. You then remove the first
node that the contrast goes to and send it for
immediate histologic examination.

Figure 9-1. Sentinel node. (Reproduced with permission
from Giuliano AE.)

On computer-based case simulation
(CCS), you cannot physically transfer the

1233/1624

patient to a location called “Operating
Room.” Order the procedure you feel is correct. The software will tell you if you also
need a consultation to do the procedure. For
example, if you order “Pap smear,” the CCS
software lets you do the test. If you order
“Colposcopy,” the software will tell you to get
a gynecology consultation first.

As you have the results of the needle
biopsy and mammography showing a
unilateral, unifocal lesion, you should
proceed to order the procedures you
know are needed.
Orders:
Surgical consultation
Oncology consultation
Sentinel node biopsy
Lumpectomy
Radiation of breast tissue

1234/1624

Lumpectomy = Modified Radical
Mastectomy Only if Breast is
Radiated!

Without radiation to the breast, cancer
recurs with lumpectomy alone.

The patient undergoes the procedure
and the procedure report states:
“Lumpectomy performed successfully,
no cancer found in sentinel node; 2-cm
infiltrating ductal carcinoma removed. Frozen sections show surrounding tissue free of cancer.”
The oncology and surgical consultation reports, as is usual on CCS, do

1235/1624

not give specific recommendations or
directions.

• If ER or PR is positive, give a SERM.
• SERMs and aromatase are more effective if both ER and PR are positive.

Which of the following will lower
mortality the most?
a. Modified radical mastectomy (MRM)
versus radical mastectomy
b. MRM versus lumpectomy and radiation
c. Adjuvant chemotherapy
d. Oophorectomy
Answer c. Adjuvant chemotherapy

1236/1624

Adjuvant chemotherapy provides a definite
mortality benefit. MRM is not better than
lumpectomy and radiation in most patients.
Radical mastectomy is obsolete and never
the right answer. Adjuvant means chemotherapy that is used to prevent metastases. It
is not “prophylactic” because the person
already has cancer. You will not be asked
much at all about the different types of
chemotherapy because it is not clear which
therapy would be best for this patient.

Aromatase Inhibitors
• Anastrazole
• Letrozole
• Exemestane

1237/1624

Which of the following is the most
common adverse effect of
aromatase inhibitors?
a. Endometrial cancer
b. Osteoporosis
c. Bladder cancer
d. Ovarian cancer
Answer b. Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis occurs because aromatase inhibits estrogen production with side effects
including bone loss. SERMs have an agonist
effect on bone, and an antagonist effect on
breast tissue, that is why tamoxifen and
raloxifene are considered “selective.”

Aromatase Inhibitors

1238/1624

• Stop the conversion of testosterone to
estrogen.
• Block the removal of one carbon from
steroid nucleus testosterone.
• Work at the ovary and in adipose
tissue.
• Simulate oophorectomy.

The patient undergoes radiation therapy to the breast after the lump is removed surgically. Because the lesion is
>1 cm, chemotherapy is given. It is not
clear whether to use a SERM or an
aromatase inhibitor.

Treatments That Lower Mortality

1239/1624

• Surgery: MRM or lumpectomy with
radiation
• HER2/Neu: trastuzumab if extra
HER2 present
• Adjuvant chemotherapy
• SERMs or aromatase inhibitors

Aromatase inhibitors inhibit osteoblasts.

1240/1624

To provide blockage of estrogen in
premenopausal women,
leuprolide and goserelin are
sometimes given to prevent the
need for oophorectomy. How do
they work?
a. They block luteinizing hormone (LH) and
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on the
ovary.
b. They decrease the release of LH and FSH
from the pituitary.
c. They decrease the level of adrenal
androgens.
d. They block the peripheral conversion to
estrogen.
Answer b. They decrease the release of LH
and FSH from the pituitary.

1241/1624

These medications are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. They will
block FSH and LH release.

CASE 2: Prostate Cancer
Setting: office
CC: “I want a PSA!”
VS: normal
HPI: The 51-year-old chairman of
medicine of your hospital comes to be
screened for prostate cancer. He is
asymptomatic.
PMHx/Medications: none
PE: normal

1242/1624

What screening test lowers
mortality for prostate cancer?
a. None
b. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) above age
40 years
c. PSA above age 50 years
d. Digital rectal examination
Answer a. None
PSA should not be routinely done. It does
not lower mortality and does not improve a
patient’s quality of life. In fact, it worsens
quality of life. The PSA has been changed to
a “D” recommendation, which is “Recommend against.” The PSA results in prostatectomy and radiation that damages erectile
function and urinary continence without preventing metastases.

1243/1624

You and the patient acknowledge all
this (as does the author of this book).
They understand the risk of unnecessary procedures and the lack of clear
efficacy, yet the patient still wants the
PSA test.
Initial Orders:
PSA

Do not forget the screening colonoscopy
at age 50!

Finasteride and dutasteride have
been shown to decrease the risk of
prostate cancer on biopsy, but still
do not lower mortality or prevent

1244/1624

metastatic disease. What is the
reason?
a. Tachyphylaxis—they wear off over time.
b. They suppress only small stage A1
cancers.
c. They only work on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
d. They cannot be used as single agents.
e. Adverse effects lead to discontinuation.
Answer b. They suppress only small stage
A1 cancers.
Finasteride and dutasteride are medications
that do decrease the overall number of prostate cancers. However, they have been
shown to have no effect on larger cancers
that have the propensity to grow and metastasize. They only suppress small, early stage
A1 prostate cancer that would not have metastasized or grown.

1245/1624

Finasteride
• Small cancers are suppressed.
• Larger cancers present later.

The patient wants to know what to do
about using finasteride. You tell him
that it definitely will not help him. He
still wants the finasteride to prevent
prostate cancer.

What do you tell him?
a. Give him the finasteride.
b. Refuse to give it to him.
c. Refer this patient to another physician in
another department such as urology to
give it to him.

1246/1624

Answer b. Refuse to give it to him.
There is a difference between allowing the
PSA, which is a subject of controversy that
had been recommended before, and allowing
finasteride. There is no benefit of using
finasteride in preventing prostate cancer
and, in fact, because it suppresses the rate of
rise of PSA, can mask the diagnosis of larger
prostate cancers until they are more widely
spread.

Patients do not have a right to therapy
you feel is useless.

Finasteride and Dutasteride
• They block 5-alpha-reductase.

1247/1624

• They block production of
dihydrotestosterone.
• Dihydrotestosterone stimulates prostate growth.

Finasteride treats benign prostatic hypertrophy not cancer.

The patient returns in a week for
results:
Report: PSA 8 ng/mL (normal 0–4
ng/mL)
PE: rectal: no masses found

1248/1624

What should be done to guide
therapy?
a. Computed tomography (CT) of pelvis
b. US of pelvis
c. Transrectal US
d. Sigmoidoscopy
Answer c. Transrectal US
If you see an elevated PSA, you need to be
sure if there is really a prostate cancer there.
Do not do a test if you do not want to know
the answer. If you feel a mass on rectal examination, then biopsy the mass you feel. If
you do not feel a mass, then use the transrectal US to guide a biopsy.

The patient undergoes the transrectal
US, which is negative and shows no
masses.

1249/1624

Repeat PSA: 8.5 ng/mL

What should you recommend to
exclude prostate cancer?
a. No further action is needed.
b. Do multiple palpation-guided biopsies.
c. Repeat the transrectal US.
Answer b. Do multiple palpation-guided
biopsies.
The only way to be truly sure that there is no
prostate cancer is to do multiple palpationguided biopsies. This means if the PSA is
elevated, it always results in a biopsy.

The patient declines having the
multiple palpation-guided biopsies. He

1250/1624

leaves with plans to follow up in 6
months.
On CCS, patients can refuse procedures that they do not want or do not
feel are indicated.
The patient is lost to follow-up for 2
years. Two years later he comes because of symptoms of dysuria, hesitancy, and dribbling.
PE:
Rectal: enlarged prostate with nodule palpated in one lobe
Orders:
PSA
Prostate biopsy
Report:
PSA: 18 ng/mL
Biopsy: adenocarcinoma of prostate

1251/1624

Prostate Cancer Treatment
• Local: prostate resection
• Metastases: hormonal manipulation

A staging evaluation with a head CT
and bone scan show no metastases.
The patient is reluctant to have radical
prostatectomy because of the risk of
incontinence and erectile dysfunction.

Which of the following indicates
the likelihood of metastasis
occurring?
a. Number of lobes
b. Gleason scoring on pathology
c. PSA level

1252/1624

d. Age of patient
Answer b. Gleason scoring of the pathology
Gleason scoring is a numerical measurement
of the pathogenicity of prostate cancer (Figure 9-2). A low score of 1 is closest to normal
tissue. A high score of 10 is the most anaplastic or highest likelihood of metastasizing.
When you have patients who are uncertain
as to whether to risk prostate surgery, you
can use the Gleason scoring as a way of giving them a likelihood of spread. For example,
a young man with a high Gleason score
should undergo radical prostatectomy with
the intention of cure because of the high likelihood he will live a long time with a risk of
spread. In an older man with a low Gleason
score, it may be safe just to use radiation
therapy.

The patient ultimately refuses surgery
and opts for brachytherapy. Radioactive seeds are implanted into the prostate. Over the next few months, the
PSA goes down and the symptoms of
obstructive uropathy subside.

There is no “adjuvant” chemotherapy for
prostate cancer.

There is no “modified radical
prostatectomy.”

1255/1624

There is no “lumpectomy” for prostate
cancer.

One year later, the patient is brought
to the emergency department (ED)
with severe back pain and weakness in
his legs.
PE:
Musculoskeletal: focal spine tenderness present
Neurological: extensor plantar reflexes present; hyperreflexic knee jerk
reflexes present; sensation in lower extremities normal

1256/1624

What is the next “best step” in the
management of this patient?
a. Dexamethasone
b. MRI
c. Radiation
d. Flutamide
e. Goserelin (GnRH agonist)
Answer a. Dexamethasone
Cord compression needs stat intravenous
(IV) glucocorticoids. The most important
thing is to prevent permanent neurological
damage from impingement on the spinal
cord. Steroids work faster than radiation. A
biopsy is unlikely to be needed in this person
who has a clear history of prostate cancer.
Hormonal manipulation will help stop the
growth of the lesion, but it will not actually
shrink the lesion that is already there. Steroids will shrink the lesion. MRI is needed.

1257/1624

Steroids are needed more. With back pain
and focal neurological deficits and hyperreflexia, this is enough information to warrant
steroids. Get the MRI done afterward. If it is
a CCS case, you can order all of these things
at the same time, because all of them are
needed. CCS is a test of understanding timing. When you have cord compression, it is a
big deal to give steroids before waiting for an
MRI.

Dexamethasone is given and radiation
is ordered. The patient is transferred
to the hospital ward because you cannot send a person home with progressive neurological damage.
Report:
The MRI shows compression of the
spinal cord.

1258/1624

After the start of steroids and
radiation, which of the following
is most urgent?
a. Denosumab
b. Finasteride
c. Flutamide
d. Goserelin (GnRH agonist)
Answer c. Flutamide
Flutamide and bicalutamide are testosterone
receptor antagonists. In terms of hormonal
therapy, it is critically important to start the
target organ receptor blocker first.
GnRH agonists such as goserelin or
leuprolide must never be started before flutamide in a person with metastatic prostate
cancer, especially when it is on the spinal
cord. The GnRH agonists initially give a
burst up in LH and FSH levels. This will
raise the testosterone levels and briefly

increase the growth of the prostate cancer.
Denosumab is a treatment for bone destruction from metastases and it is also a treatment for osteoporosis.

1. Block the testosterone target first.
2. Stop the gonadotropins (LH and
FSH) after.

Finasteride and Dutasteride
• They are useless in prostate cancer.
• They block 5-alpha-reductase.
• They only decrease
dihydrotestosterone.

1260/1624

What is the mechanism whereby
goserelin or leuprolide decreases
testosterone?
a. They downregulate at the pituitary gland.
b. They block testicular LH and FSH
receptors.
c. They block dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA) production at the adrenal gland.
d. They inhibit 17,20-lyase
e. They decrease the hypothalamic release of
GnRH.
Answer a. Downregulation at the pituitary.
Hormones are usually made in pulsatile
form. When a target organ is exposed to a
constant amount of a hormone, the receptors
at the target begin to involute and decrease.
This is called either “downregulation” or
“target organ resistance.” Because the pituitary gland is the target organ of GnRH, it is

1261/1624

the pituitary gland where the receptors
downregulate.

Denosumab
• It protects bones.
• It inhibits the receptor activator of
nuclear factor kappa B ligand
(RANKL).
• RANKL is similar to tumor necrosis
factor (TNF).

RANKL = Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Ligand

The patient undergoes treatment with
radiation and has flutamide started,
followed by a GnRH agonist shortly

1262/1624

after. Symptoms of back pain resolve.
Weakness in the legs improves.

Orchiectomy is the fastest way to lower
androgen levels.

What other therapy can be done
to block androgen production?
a. Abiraterone and degarelix
b. Estrogen and progesterone
c. Tamoxifen and exemestane
d. Nothing
Answer a. Abiraterone and degarelix
Abiraterone is an inhibitor of 17-alpha-hydroxylase in the gonads and adrenal glands.

1263/1624

This drug shuts off production of the
testosterone precursor DHEA. You cannot
make testosterone if you do not make DHEA
first. This drug closes the precursor
“pipeline” for all sex hormones.
Degarelix is a GnRH receptor antagonist.
It directly blocks the effect of GnRH on the
pituitary gland.
The other medications manipulate estrogen. Exemestane is an aromatase inhibitor.

Chemotherapy is poor for prostate
cancer.

Prostate metastases are controlled with
hormone inhibitors.

CASE 3: Myeloma
Setting: office
CC: “I coughed, and my chest has been
sore ever since.”
VS: BP: 112/76 mm Hg; P: 76 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R: 24 breaths/minute
HPI: A 64-year-old man comes to the
office with pain on the right side of his
chest after a coughing spell a few days
ago. He went to his local ED last night
and an x-ray showed two fractured
ribs. He has had a few episodes of bronchitis and pneumonia in the last 2 years.
Old x-rays are compared and definitely
showed no lesions in the past.
PMHX:
Fatigue

1265/1624

Anemia
Nephrolithiasis earlier this year

“Pathologic” Fracture
• Break during normal use

ROS:
Losing height, 2 inches shorter than
he was
Medications:
Vitamins
PE:
General: tired, in visible pain when
he moves
Chest: focal tenderness over site
where fractures were found

1266/1624

Cardiovascular: normal
Rectal: no masses
Initial Orders:
Chest x-ray
Rib x-ray
Vertebral and spine x-ray
Complete blood count (CBC)
Comprehensive metabolic panel
(CHEM-20)
Acetaminophen

Look for vertebral compression fractures
when looking for pathological fracture.

Prostate cancer likes to metastasize to
the bone.

1267/1624

Reports:
Chest x-ray: no pneumothorax; no
pneumonia
Rib x-ray: two fractures, three lytic
lesions
Vertebral and spine x-ray: compression fracture T4, T5
CBC: hematocrit 32%; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 86 fL
CHEM-20: high total protein; normal albumin; calcium 11.5 mg/dL
(elevated)

What will a nuclear bone scan
show in myeloma?
a. Increased uptake diffusely
b. Increased uptake at lytic lesion sites
c. No change in uptake

1268/1624

Answer c. No change in uptake
Nuclear bone scans do not pick up extra
technetium isotope in myeloma. The lesions
in myeloma are purely lytic (Figure 9-3).
Nuclear bone scans show where there is
blastic activity as well. Metastases are a mix
of lytic and blastic activity and so is
osteomyelitis.

Figure 9-3. Myeloma lesions: Radiolucent or darker areas
represent lytic lesions. (Reproduced with permission from

1269/1624

Kaushansky K, et al. Williams Hematology, 8th ed. New
York: McGraw-Hill; 2010.)

Nuclear isotope is deposited by
osteoblasts.

There is no specific therapy for rib
fractures beyond analgesia. You want
to reduce pain so the patient does not
“splint” when there is pain, reduce
breathing, and develop a pneumonia.

“Splinting”: reducing ventilation secondary to rib pain

1270/1624

Orders:
Bisphosphonates (pamidronate,
alendronate)
Serum protein electrophoresis
(SPEP)
Peripheral blood smear
Uric acid level
Urinalysis (UA)
Oncology evaluation

Bisphosphonate inhibits osteoclasts.

High Total Protein = SPEP

1271/1624

Report:
SPEP: monoclonal spike in immunoglobulin G (IgG) range
Smear: rouleaux formation
Uric acid: normal
UA: trace protein
Oncology evaluation: no specific
recommendations

Rouleaux Formation
• Red blood cells (RBCs) appear in
stacks or “rolls” on the smear.
• IgG on the RBC surface makes RBCs
“stick” to each other.
• Rouleaux formation is clinically
meaningless.

1272/1624

What is the single most specific
test for myeloma?
a. SPEP
b. Bone marrow biopsy
c. Urine immunoelectrophoresis
d. Bence Jones protein
e. Peripheral blood smear
Answer b. Bone marrow biopsy
Looking for >10% plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy is the single most specific test for
myeloma. When combined with a monoclonal spike on SPEP and lytic lesions, this
establishes the diagnosis of myeloma (Figure
9-4). Some cancers can give lytic lesions. The
monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) accounts for 99% of IgG
spikes on SPEP. You can have Bence Jones
proteinuria alone without myeloma. The
only thing that gives >10% plasma cells on
bone marrow biopsy is myeloma.

1273/1624

Figure 9-4. Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrates
an M-protein peak (left). Immunofixation electrophoresis
confirms it to be monoclonal IgG lambda type. (Reproduced
with permission from Katarjian HM, et al. The MD Anderson Manual of Medical Oncology, 2nd ed. New York:
McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

MGUS = IgG spike
• No bone lesion
• No renal damage
• No infections
• Normal calcium level

1274/1624

• Normal uric acid level

Why do you get hyperuricemia in
myeloma, but not in hemolysis?
a. RBCs have no nuclei.
b. Neutrophils function normally.
c. Renal insufficiency makes it accumulate.
d. Haptoglobin removes uric acid from
circulation.
Answer a. RBCs have no nuclei.
Uric acid increases from increased destruction of cells that have nuclei. RBCs have no
nuclei. Freshly and abnormally released purines and pyrimidines come out of the nuclei.
The metabolic end product of purines and
pyrimidines is uric acid. Hyperuricemia generally occurs with chemotherapy of

1275/1624

hematologic malignancy. This is why it can
be normal on initial diagnosis.

Nucleic acids are made into uric acid.

You explain to the patient that the lytic
bone lesions, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and hyperuricemia with
a monoclonal IgG spike on SPEP likely
indicate multiple myeloma.
Orders:
Bone marrow biopsy
Repeat calcium and uric acid levels
Urine immunoelectrophoresis
Beta-2-microglobulin
CBC
Basic metabolic panel (CHEM-7)

1276/1624

Beta-2-Microglobulin
• The level is elevated in myeloma.
• It is used as a marker of response to
treatment.

Mechanism of Renal Injury in Myeloma
• IgG damages glomeruli.
• Uric acid and hypercalcemia damage
tubules.
• Bence Jones proteins are toxic to the
tubules.
• Amyloid accumulates.

The patient continues to be fatigued.
He has a brief episode of pneumonia

1277/1624

since the last time he saw you. He was
treated with antibiotics and improved.
Reports:
Bone marrow biopsy: 24% plasma
cells (Figure 9-5)
Calcium 11.2 mg/dL and uric acid
normal
Urine immunoelectrophoresis: Bence
Jones protein markedly elevated
Beta-2-microglobulin: elevated
CBC: hematocrit 29%
CHEM-7: creatinine 1.7 mg/dL

Figure 9-5. Multiple myeloma (marrow). The cells bear
characteristic morphologic features of plasma cells, round
or oval cells with an eccentric nucleus composed of coarsely
clumped chromatin, a densely basophilic cytoplasm, and a
perinuclear clear zone containing the Golgi apparatus. Binucleate and multinucleate malignant plasma cells can be
seen. (Reproduced with permission from Longo DL, et al.

Bence Jones Protein
• Immunoglobulin fragment
• Kappa or lambda light chains

1279/1624

• Toxic to kidneys
• Not detected by UA

Protein Detected on UA = Albumin

Death in myeloma is from:
• Infection
• Renal failure

In myeloma, if there are excess
plasma cells making excess
immunoglobulins, what is the
mechanism of increased
infections?
a. Myeloma switches to IgA.
b. IgE is deficient.

1280/1624

c. Neutrophils do not work.
d. IgG in myeloma is not effective.
e. Urinary loss neutralizes excess
production.
Answer d. IgG in myeloma is not effective.
Plasma cells are made in excess amounts in
myeloma, but they are not useful in producing effective immunoglobulins. Plasma cells
in myeloma make large amounts of ineffective IgG. They do not make the immunoglobulins that the patient needs to fight
infection.

Bence Jones protein is not functional.

Myeloma

1281/1624

• IgG: 50%
• IgA: 20%
• Bence Jones alone: 20%

Plasma cells secrete humoral factors that
destroy bone in myeloma.

The patient returns in a week after the
oncologist evaluates him.

What is the best therapy for this
patient?
a. Melphalan
b. Steroids
c. Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)

1282/1624

d. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant
(BMT)
e. Observation
Answer c. Autologous stem cell transplant
(ASCT)
Autologous BMT can be done in patients up
to age 70 years. Allogeneic bone marrow
from a related, matched donor should be
avoided after age 50 years. Melphalan alone
is inappropriate for this patient. Melphalan
by itself is little better than palliation. It will
not result in a sustained remission in anyone. Steroids do have a primary antileukemia effect, but they cannot be used alone.
Allogeneic BMT kills the patient from
graft-versus-host disease and from graft rejection. ASCT cannot reject the patient, because it is the patient’s own marrow. Stem
cell transplantation allow a shorter duration
of neutropenia. The cells are already partially grown and differentiated. This allows a

1283/1624

much shorter duration of neutropenia compared to allogeneic BMT.
Longer Duration of Neutropenia =
Higher Death Rate

Allogeneic = More Chance of Cure +
More Chance of Death
Autologous = Less Chance of Cure +
Less Chance of Death

Collect stem cells tagged with CD34.

The patient undergoes ASCT. Move the
clock forward 1 day at a time and
check the CBC each day. When the

1284/1624

patient eventually recovers his cell
count, he can be sent home.
Complex cases like chemotherapy
management in leukemia or myeloma
are unlikely to occur as CCS cases. You
will never be asked which of the chemotherapy combinations is best. It is just
not clear.
As you move the clock forward, it
will become clear from cell count and
beta-2-microglobulin level whether the
patient is recovering or needs additional chemotherapy. It is not clear which
drug or set of drugs will be used for relapsed myeloma. All of the following in
combination of two or three are
possible:
Lenalidomide (or thalidomide)
Melphalan
Prednisone (or dexamethasone)

1285/1624

Bortezomib

Lenalidomide: TNF inhibitor
Bortezomib: proteosome inhibitor

CASE 4: Polycythemia Vera
Setting: office
CC: “I’m itchy and my hands hurt!”
VS: BP: 145/88 mm Hg; P: 88 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R: 23 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 45-year-old man comes to the
office with generalized pruritus that is
clearly worse after taking a bath. He

1286/1624

is also having difficulty breathing. He
has been to his local ED twice for the
same problems. He was sent home because his pulse oximeter level, arterial
blood gas (ABG) test, and chest x-ray
were all normal.
PMHX:
Peptic ulcer
Medications:
Diphenhydramine
PE:
General: flushed, red face with
plethora
Chest: clear to auscultation
Abdomen: enlarged spleen palpable
Extremities: nontender, red painful
hands (erythromelalgia)

1287/1624

Initial Orders:
CBC
Oximeter
Chest x-ray

Borderline elevations in blood pressure
(BP) have no meaning in a patient who
is distressed for any reason.

This case is a good example of how the
setting in which the patient is encountered makes a big difference in
the diagnostic approach. If this person
were in the ED, you would end up doing an urgent ABG, chest x-ray, and

1288/1624

CT. If the office, the diagnostic pathway is much slower.
As the clock is moved forward, the
patient continues to have an extremely
uncomfortable generalized itching, especially after a warm shower.
Reports:
Oximeter 97% on room air
CBC:
Hematocrit 64%; MCV 74 fL; RBCs
6.5 × 106 cells/μL (increased)
White blood cells (WBCs): 18,000/μL
Platelets: 850,000/μL
Chest x-ray: normal

Routine Findings in Polycythemia Vera
• High vitamin B12 level

1289/1624

• High leukocyte alkaline phosphatase
(LAP)

Increased RBC count with small MCV
• Polycythemia vera
• Hypoxia
• Thalassemia

Pruritus
• Histamine releases from basophils.
• Warmth releases it.

High Hematocrit Level + Low MCV
Level – Hypoxia = Polycythemia Vera

1290/1624

The patient is scheduled to undergo
phlebotomy because of shortness of
breath.

Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation is 95%
sensitive for polycythemia vera.

Low Erythropoietin + High Hematocrit = Polycythemia Vera

What is the most common cause
of death in polycythemia vera?
a. Bleeding
b. Thrombosis
c. Transformation to acute leukemia
d. Transformation to myelofibrosis

1291/1624

Answer b. Thrombosis
Blood vessels get clogged up with the increased hematocrit increasing the viscosity
of the blood. Large vessel thrombosis such as
deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary
embolus (PE), and Budd-Chiari syndrome
can kill the patient. The idea is to do phlebotomy to remove the extra RBCs before the
vessels clot off.

• Ulcers are part of polycythemia vera.
• Histamine from basophils stimulates
extra acid.

After phlebotomy, the patient feels
much better. This is the mainstay of
therapy. Radioactive phosphorus

1292/1624

(P-32) is no longer used. Hydroxyurea
is not necessary.

Decreasing blood viscosity increases
blood flow.

Over the next 12 to 24 months, the patient is well maintained on regular
phlebotomy. The hematocrit decreases
and shortness of breath resolves.
Pruritus is controlled.

What is the most likely long-term
transformation?
a. Acute leukemia

1293/1624

b. Myelofibrosis
c. Myeloma
d. Myelodysplastic syndrome
Answer b. Myelofibrosis
Myelofibrosis can develop from polycythemia vera. You will recognize it when
you see teardrop-shaped cells and nucleated
RBCs appearing on the peripheral blood
smear.
Treat
myelofibrosis
with
lenalidomide.

Lenalidomide
• Inhibits TNF

The patient is well maintained on intermittent phlebotomy. The redness of

1294/1624

the hands (erythromelalgia) resolves.
Splenomegaly from the polycythemia
vera persists.

CHAPTER 10

1297/1624

INFECTIOUS
DISEASES
CASE 1: Osteomyelitis
Setting: emergency department (ED)
CC: “I’ve got fluid coming out of an ulcer in my leg.”
VS: BP: T: 98°F; R: 14 breaths/minute
HPI: A 64-year-old man with longstanding diabetes and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) comes to the ED with
drainage coming out of an area of ulcer
over the tibial area. He has had recurrent ulcers in this area off and on for
years. Most have responded to local

1298/1624

wound care. Occasionally he has used
antibiotics. He did not go see his doctor
for this one, and decided on his own to
come to the ED.
PMHX:
Diabetes
Hypertension
PAD
Medications:
Aspirin, cilostazol
Metformin, glyburide, and sitagliptin
PE:
General: comfortable, sitting upright,
no distress
Chest: clear bilaterally
Extremities: 2-cm ulcer over anterior
surface of lower left leg, halfway
between knee and ankle; modest
warmth in the area, little tenderness.

1299/1624

Draining sinus tract is visible in the
center. Bone is not visible.
Diabetes + PAD = Ulcers ±
Osteomyelitis

The first question to ask yourself when
confronted with a patient with a diabetic
ulcer is:
• Osteomyelitis: yes or no?

Neutrophils do not function normally in
diabetes.

1300/1624

Initial Orders:
X-ray of leg
Complete blood count (CBC), basic
metabolic panel (CHEM-7)
Restart outpatient medications
On the computer-based case simulation (CCS), if you do not order
something, it is not being given or
done. In this case, unless you order the
PAD and diabetes medications, you
should not assume they are automatically continued. Nothing is automatically continued on CCS, unless you have
ordered it. You will be able to see on
the order screen in front of you every
medication that is ordered, and every
laboratory test that is pending.

1301/1624

Probing straight to bone
• Highly suggestive of osteomyelitis
• Will not give specific organism

Which of these is useless in
osteomyelitis evaluation?
a. Gallium scan
b. Indium scan
c. Swab culture of ulcer
d. Computed tomography (CT) scan
e. Technetium-99 scan
Answer c. Swab culture of ulcer
Culturing the surface of an ulcer generates
irrelevant and misleading data. The ulcer
will definitely grow organisms, but it will not
tell you what is in the bone. That makes it
distracting. The other scans are not as

1302/1624

accurate as magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), but they can be useful to determine if
there is bone involvement or if the infection
is limited just to the skin.

Do not give antibiotics just for a bone
infection. Osteomyelitis in a diabetic
patient is a chronic infection that takes
weeks to months to develop, and needs
weeks to months to cure. It is more

1303/1624

important to get a specific microbiologic identification, than to start empiric
therapy that might be incorrect.
Move the clock forward to get xray results.

• Bone loss needs 1 to 2 weeks to show
as abnormal on x-ray.
• For the x-ray to be abnormal, 50% to
70% of bone calcium must be lost.

Report:
X-ray: no destruction of bone
detected
CBC: normal white blood cell (WBC)
count, no anemia

1304/1624

Chemistry: normal except glucose
138 mg/dL

What is an abnormality shown on
MRI based on?
a. Calcium
b. Water
c. Sodium and potassium
d. Nuclear isotope deposition
e. Glucose metabolism
Answer b. Water
The MRI is based on an alteration of the spin
of hydrogen ions in molecules when exposed
to different magnetic frequencies. The spin
or “flip” in the ion occurs under different
magnetic intensity based on its water content. Bone actually swells in 2 to 3 days after

1305/1624

infection begins. The swelling of bone
changes its water content very early and very
clearly and this is why it shows as an abnormality on MRI so early. CT and x-ray are
based on calcium content. The positron
emission tomography (PET) scan is based on
the metabolism of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose.
Cancer generally has a higher rate of glucose
metabolism than surrounding tissues and
that is why it lights up with PET scan.

• MRI is based on tissue water content.
• PET is based on glucose metabolism.

Orders:
MRI

1306/1624

Only do a nuclear bone scan if an MRI
cannot be done, for example, because of
the presence of a pacemaker.

Hold antibiotics until you get a bone
sample.

On your clinical rotations you will see
doctors treating with antibiotics before a bone sample is obtained. Do not
do this on your Step 3 examination
test. Advance the clock to get MRI
results.
The CCS order screen will always
tell you the precise time, down to the

1307/1624

minute, when a test result will come
back.
Report:
MRI: abnormal uptake in the tibia
consistent with osteomyelitis

The culture of the surface of an ulcer
does not reveal what is in the bone.

Orders:
Bone biopsy
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR)

1308/1624

Gram-negative bacilli causes 30% of osteomyelitis in diabetes.

Only biopsy can tell if Staphylococcus is
sensitive or resistant.

Move the clock forward until the
biopsy is obtained. You do not have to
wait for the results to start antibiotics.
You just have to take the sample before
the start of antibiotics so that you
know it will be accurate.
After the bone biopsy is obtained,
order antibiotics.
CCS will tell you that it will be 1 to
2 days before the culture and pathology

1309/1624

reports are back. The culture will give
you the organisms and the sensitivity.
Pathology will tell you whether osteomyelitis is present on the microscopic
examination of the slides.

Osteomyelitis Pathology
• Neutrophils infiltrating bone

Organisms
1. Staphylococcus: both sensitive and
resistant
2. Gram-negative rods
3. Fungus, mycobacterial, mixed

1310/1624

Orders:
Vancomycin or linezolid or daptomycin and
Piperacillin/Tazobactam or cefepime
or quinolone (levofloxacin,
ciprofloxacin)

If a rash is associated with the use of
penicillin, cephalosporin is safe to use.

Move the clock forward to obtain the
results of the bone biopsy. Antibiotics
should be continued intravenously until results are obtained.
Reports:

1311/1624

ESR: 110 mm/h
Bone biopsy:
Pathology shows neutrophils.
The culture is Staphylococcus aureus.
It is sensitive to oxacillin.

What is the mechanism of
vancomycin?
a. DNA gyrase
b. RNA polymerase
c. Cell wall
d. Ribosome
Answer c. Cell wall
Vancomycin inhibits the formation of the cell
wall by a mechanism different than that of
penicillin or cephalosporin (Figure 10-1).
Despite them both working by inhibiting the

1312/1624

cell wall, beta-lactam antibiotics are more effective and bactericidal at inhibiting growth
of organisms that are sensitive to oxacillin.
For this reason, it is imperative that you
switch vancomycin to a beta-lactam antibiotic if the organism is sensitive. Vancomycin
has a greater failure rate in controlling sensitive microorganisms that are oxacillin
(methicillin) sensitive.

1313/1624

Figure 10-1. Inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis: vancomycin and beta-lactam agents. Vancomycin inhibits the
polymerization or transglycosylase reaction (A) by binding
to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the cell wall precursor unit attached to its lipid carrier and blocks linkage to the
glycopeptide polymer (indicated by the subscript n). These
(NAM–NAG)n peptidoglycan polymers are located within
the cell wall. Van A-type resistance is due to the expression
of enzymes that modify the cell wall precursor by substituting a terminal D-lactate for D-alanine, reducing vancomycin
binding affinity by 1000 times. Beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit the cross-linking or transpeptidase reaction (B) that
links glycopeptide polymer chains by formation of a crossbridge with the stem peptide (the five glycines in this example) of one chain, displacing the terminal D-alanine of an
adjacent chain. (Reproduced with permission from Brunton
LL, et al. Goodman & Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis
of Therapeutics, 12th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

The patient can be sent home on antibiotics intravenously. Only gram-negative osteomyelitis can be reliably treated
with oral antibiotics such as a quinolone. Staphylococci, whether sensitive
or resistant, must be treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics.

1314/1624

Orders:
Discontinue vancomycin.
Discontinue piperacillin/tazobactam.
Start IV oxacillin (or nafcillin) or
ceftriaxone.
Transfer the patient home.
CCS is easier than real life in that you
do not have to worry about dosing of
antibiotics. Oxacillin, nafcillin, cefazolin, and ceftriaxone are all IV antibiotics that effectively cover sensitive
staphylococcus. Any one of them is acceptable on CCS based on the sensitivities that are reported to you.
Move the clock forward at 1- to
2-week intervals. You should not repeat
the x-ray or MRI to follow the effect of
treatment. Use the ESR. If the ESR
comes down slowly over 4 weeks, you
can stop antibiotics. If, at 3 weeks, the

1315/1624

ESR is still elevated, continue IV treatment to 6 weeks. If the ESR is still elevated at 5 and 6 weeks, then repeat the
MRI and evaluate for surgical
debridement. Persistently high ESR may
indicate necrotic bone or abscess
formation.
Bone biopsy is the key to osteomyelitis management!

You will feel stupid if you did not biopsy
the bone, and the treatment fails at 6
weeks.

CASE 2: Endocarditis

1316/1624

Setting: ED
CC: “I have a fever.”
VS: BP: 110/70 mm Hg; P: 90 beats/
minute; T: 102°F; R: 14 breaths/minute
HPI: A 43-year-old man with a history
of injection drug use (IDU) comes to the
ED with fever for the past several days.
The last time he injected drugs was several days prior to coming to the ED. He
had been sober for 2 years when he relapsed. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
PMHX:
Alcoholism: 2 years of sobriety
Three-month residential rehabilitation
in past
Medications: none

1317/1624

What valve would be involved
most often with endocarditis
secondary to IDU?
a. Mitral
b. Aortic
c. Tricuspid
d. Pulmonic
Answer c. Tricuspid
Because of continuously exposing the right
side of the heart to infected material you
should expect to have an infection of the
right side of the heart. The tricuspid valve is
most vulnerable. Right-sided endocarditis
can spread infection to the lungs with septic
emboli.

PE:

1318/1624

Cardiovascular: 3/6 systolic murmur
heard best at the lower left sternal
border
Extremities: splinter hemorrhages
found in some fingernails; no Janeway lesions, no Osler nodes

Which lesion will increase on
inhalation?
a. Mitral stenosis
b. Aortic stenosis
c. Tricuspid regurgitation
d. Mitral regurgitation
Answer c. Tricuspid regurgitation
Right-sided lesions increase with inhalation.
Left-sided lesions increase with exhalation.

1319/1624

Inhalation Mechanism
• It expands the volume of the chest.
• The phrenic nerve stimulates the
diaphragm.
• Negative intrathoracic pressure is
present.
• It pulls more blood into the thorax.

The patient’s murmur increases with
inhalation. The lower left sternal border is the location of the tricuspid
valve.
Initial Orders:
Blood cultures
CBC
CHEM-7

1320/1624

Sensitivity of Blood Cultures
1. 70% to 80%
2. 90% to 95%
3. 95% to 99%

Move the clock forward 5 to 10
minutes and repeat the cultures.
On CCS, the only way to get multiple blood cultures is to move the clock
forward and repeat the test. For acute
endocarditis, such as from IDU, do not
wait for the results of cultures or echocardiography to give the antibiotics.

1321/1624

Three cultures are standard when excluding endocarditis.

Mechanism of Blood Cultures
1. Media contains labeled carbon.
2. Bacteria ingest labeled carbon as they
grow.
3. Labeled carbon excreted as labeled
carbon dioxide (CO2) by bacteria.
4. Machine samples air in the bottles by
needle.
5. Labeled CO2 above the cutoff indicates
growth of bacteria.

1322/1624

After the third blood culture is obtained, start antibiotics. Waiting 15 to
30 minutes between cultures is acceptable. Sustained or continuous
bacteremia is a strongly suggestive of
endocarditis.
Reports:
CBC: normal
CHEM-7: normal
You check the patient’s chemistry to
guide dosing of medications. It does
not matter that dosing is not possible
on CCS. It matters that you know you
need to estimate glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) so as not to kill your patient’s kidneys.

1323/1624

Subacute endocarditis is associated with
anemia in >90% of patients.
A normal CBC in this situation suggests
acute endocarditis.

Orders:
Vancomycin IV
Gentamicin IV
All initial laboratory tests and treatments should be ordered while in the
ED before transferring the patient to
the hospital ward. Never just shoot the
patient to the floor or intensive care
unit (ICU) without doing something
for them.

1324/1624

Native valve endocarditis: Viridans
group streptococci is the most common
cause.
IDU: S. aureus or epidermidis is the
most common cause.

What is the mechanism of
aminoglycoside antibiotics such
as gentamicin, tobramycin, and
amikacin?
a. DNA gyrase
b. RNA polymerase
c. Cell wall
d. Ribosome
e. Unknown
Answer d. Ribosome

1325/1624

Aminoglycoside antibiotics inhibit messenger RNA (mRNA) translation at the ribosome. This is not the same as inhibiting the
production of mRNA. Gentamicin stops the
production of protein from mRNA at the ribosome. There is no difference in the mechanism or aminoglycosides.

Beta-Lactam Antibiotics
• Penicillins
• Cephalosporins
• Carbapenems
• Monobactam (aztreonam)

Why are beta-lactam antibiotics
and gentamicin synergistic in
effect?
a. Blocking excretion raises blood level.

1326/1624

b. Gentamicin increases tissue penetrance of
penicillin.
c. Different mechanisms of action are
complementary.
d. Gentamicin affects the cell wall when used
with beta-lactam antibiotics.
Answer c. Different mechanisms of action
are complementary.
Beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit the cell wall.
This literally puts a hole in the bacterial cell
wall. The aminoglycoside can enter the hole
in the wall and disrupt the work or production of the ribosome.
Synergism = Two Drugs with Different
Mechanisms of Action

1327/1624

Two beta-lactam antibiotics are never
synergistic when used together!

Do not forget to order a diet for all admitted patients. The CCS does not expect you to starve your patient!

Why are splinter hemorrhages
potentially important in this
patient?
a. Changes dose of antibiotics
b. Changes duration of antibiotics
c. Establishes diagnosis of endocarditis if
cultures are negative
d. Changes which echocardiogram to use
e. Antiquated and never relevant

1328/1624

Answer c. Establishes diagnosis of endocarditis if cultures are negative
Blood cultures are falsely negative in 1% to
5% of patients with endocarditis. This form
of “culture-negative” endocarditis is diagnosed with the presence of vegetations on
an echocardiogram and the presence of at
least three minor criteria. Splinter hemorrhages are one of the minor criteria.
Minor criteria:
• Risk: IDU or prosthetic valve
• Fever
• Embolic or vascular phenomena: splinter
hemorrhages, Osler nodes, Roth spots,
Janeway lesions

This type of patient can have the clock
moved forward at long intervals, for
example, 12 hours is okay for a

1329/1624

hospitalized patient. Blood culture results take 1 to 2 days to become
positive.
Report:
Blood cultures: S. aureus in all three
cultures

What microbiologic feature of S.
aureus allows it to cause acute
endocarditis?
a. Routine feature of gram-positive organism
b. Coagulase
c. Absence of coagulase
d. Plasmid
e. Mutation of penicillin-binding protein
Answer b. Coagulase

1330/1624

Coagulase is present in the cell surface of S.
aureus. This organism is synonymous with
the term “coagulase positive staphylococci.”
Coagulase literally “melts” its way through
intact tissue. This is why IDU causes acute
endocarditis. Coagulase makes the organism
able to aggressively penetrate normal tissue.
Viridans group streptococci and enterococcus are relatively much less virulent. They
generally can only invade damaged tissue
such as prosthetic valves or those underlying
native valvular disease such as mitral stenosis or regurgitation. Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of more than 30 types of less virulent staphylococci that are coagulase
negative.

Coagulase penetrates normal tissue.

1331/1624

Orders:
Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)
Repeat vital signs
Report:
Repeat temperature 100.8°F at 2
days after start of antibiotics

Make sure fever resolves with
endocarditis.

TTE has same sensitivity for right-sided
endocarditis as transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

1332/1624

The right ventricle covers 75% of the anterior surface (front) of the heart.

Strongest indication for valve
replacement:
• Ruptured chordae tendineae

Move the clock forward to get the
sensitivity of the organism and the
TTE results.
Reports:
Sensitivity report: sensitive to
oxacillin
TTE: tricuspid valve vegetation (Figure 10-2)

1333/1624

Switch vancomycin to a beta-lactam
antibiotic if it is Staphylococcus
sensitive.
Orders:
Stop vancomycin
Start oxacillin (or nafcillin)
Chest x-ray

of Internal Medicine, 18th ed., Vol. 2. New York: McGrawHill; 2012.)

Check for septic emboli to the lungs in
patients with right-sided endocarditis.

Report:
Chest x-ray: normal

Coagulase creates lung abscesses by tissue penetrance into the lungs.

1335/1624

Move the clock forward to day 5 of
treatment. Gentamicin is only needed
for synergy with the beta-lactam antibiotic for the first 3 to 5 days of
therapy.
Orders:
Stop gentamicin
Continue oxacillin (or nafcillin or cefazolin) for 4 weeks

When the patient’s treatment is
finished, what will the patient
need for endocarditis prophylaxis
with dental procedures in the
future?
a. Nothing
b. Amoxicillin with fillings
c. Amoxicillin with dental extraction

1336/1624

d. Quinolones with colonoscopy if biopsied
Answer c.
extraction

Amoxicillin

with

dental

Previous endocarditis is an indication for endocarditis prophylaxis if undergoing a
potentially bacteremia-causing procedure.
Dental extraction or cutting the mouth needs
prophylaxis. Dental fillings and any form of
endoscopy of either the lungs or gastrointestinal (GI) tract do not need prophylaxis.
Lesions needing prophylaxis with dental
extractions:
• Previous endocarditis
• Prosthetic valves
• Unrepaired cyanotic heart disease
• Cardiac transplant recipients

CASE 3: Pyelonephritis
Setting: ED

1337/1624

CC: “It burns when I pee.”
VS: BP: 108/70 mm Hg; P: 104 beats/
minute; T: 101.6°F; R: 14 breaths/
minute
HPI: A generally healthy 32-year-old
woman with fever, urinary frequency,
and burning for several days and back
pain has arrived at the ED. She had
cystitis once several years ago. She has
not seen a physician for a long time. She
is nauseated and vomited twice.
PMHx/Medications: none
PE:
General: sitting up in bed;
uncomfortable
Back: tenderness at the left flank.
Costovertebral angle tenderness is
present.

1338/1624

Abdomen: nontender; normal bowel
sounds
Initial Orders:
Urinalysis (UA)
Blood cultures
CBC
CHEM-7

Escherichia coli is still most common
cause of urinary tract infections.

On UA, look for white blood cells
(WBCs).
Bacteria on UA is relevant only in
pregnancy.

1339/1624

Blood cultures take 2 to 3 days to become positive on CCS.
Report:
UA: WBCs 400/μL; protein trace; nitrite positive
CBC: WBCs 16,700/μL
CHEM-7: normal

Nitrites = Gram-Negative Bacilli
Bacteria convert nitrate to nitrite.

Dysuria + UA WBCs = Urinary Tract
Infection (UTI) + Flank Pain =
Pyelonephritis

1340/1624

Staphylococcus saprophyticus
• UTI
• Sexually active young women

Dysuria + UA WBC + Suprapubic Pain
= Cystitis

Start treatment as soon as blood cultures are obtained and the presence of
WBCs is confirmed on UA.

Imaging is not needed prior to starting
antibiotics (Figure 10-3).

1341/1624

Figure 10-3. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen
showing pyelonephritis in a patient with a urinary tract obstruction from a stone at the ureteropelvic junction. The
right kidney is significantly enlarged, with hydronephrosis
and perinephric fat stranding. (Reproduced with permission
from McKean SC, et al. Principles and Practice of Hospital
Medicine. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2012.)

Orders:
Ceftriaxone IV
Renal ultrasound (US)

1342/1624

CCS will expect you to know practical
issues, such as, “Do not prescribe pills
for vomiting people with
pyelonephritis.”

IV Pyelonephritis Therapies
• Ceftriaxone
• Ampicillin and gentamicin
• Aztreonam
• Ciprofloxacin
• Levofloxacin
• Ertapenem

Aztreonam
• Monobactam

1343/1624

• Cell wall inhibitor
• No cross reaction with penicillin

Move the clock forward to get the results of the renal US. The US is not to
diagnose pyelonephritis, but to identify a potential correctable etiology.

Renal US to identify:
• Stones
• Strictures
• Tumor
• Obstruction

1344/1624

Report:
Renal US: no stones, no hydronephrosis; enlarged left kidney, edema
consistent with pyelonephritis
Advance the clock 6 to 12 hours and do
an Interval History. This is the only
way to see if the nausea and vomiting
has resolved.
The main reason to admit a patient
with pyelonephritis is:
Inability to take pills
Hypotension and hemodynamic
instability

Nausea and vomiting are common in
pyelonephritis.

1345/1624

Interval History: “Nausea is much improved. No further episodes of vomiting today.
Still febrile with temperature
102°F.”
Reports:
Blood cultures: no growth
Urine culture: E. coli, sensitivity
pending
CCS will not engage in controversial or
unclear practices. Oral and IV pyelonephritis treatment are nearly equal.
If you are not certain, keep the patient
in the hospital until the sensitivity of
the organism is known.
Move the clock forward a day to get
the sensitivity of the organism. You can
be fully sure the pyelonephritis will resolve by that time.

1346/1624

Reports:
Blood culture: no growth at 3 days
Urine: E. coli sensitive to
ciprofloxacin
Orders:
Stop ceftriaxone.
Start oral ciprofloxacin.
Transfer the patient home.
Schedule a follow-up appointment in
the office in 7 days.

Quinolones
• They inhibit DNA gyrase.
• Gyrase is needed to unwind genetics so
it can reproduce.
• IV and oral blood level are nearly
identical.

1347/1624

CASE 4: Cellulitis
Setting: ED
CC: “My leg is red and swollen.”
VS: BP: 134/88 mm Hg; P: 96 beats/
minute; T: 102°F; R: 18 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 49-year-old generally healthy
man with several days of increasing
redness and warmth of his right lower
extremity presents at the ED. The leg
is painful. He has been “feeling warm”
for a few days as well. He denies injury to the leg, cancer, long flights,
knee surgery, or immobility. He has
had no previous episode of skin infection and no recent hospitalizations.
PMHX: none

1348/1624

Medications: none
PE:
General: well-groomed, alert, and
friendly
Extremities: right leg has an area of
redness in the skin over the medial
half of the lower leg and the calf
(Figure 10-4). Redness is warm to
touch. There are no ulcerations.
Tinea pedis is found in between the
toes.
CCS allows the artificial distinction
between choosing tests or treatments
to disappear. In this respect, CCS is
similar to real life. This patient needs
several things simultaneously, and it
would be artificial to ask a student to
choose only one of them.
Initial Orders:

1349/1624

Cefazolin IV
Lower-extremity duplex US
Blood cultures

Figure 10-4. Cellulitis in an older man with venous stasis
dermatitis. (Reproduced with permission from Richard P.
Usatine, MD.)

1350/1624

Cellulitis Organisms
Number 1 is S. aureus.
Number 2 is beta-hemolytic
streptococci.

Sensitive and resistant S. aureus cannot be distinguished by appearance.

Exclude clot in all leg-related cellulitis.

Beta-Hemolysis = Complete Hemolysis

1351/1624

Which of these are considered
“standard” in this patient with
cellulitis?
a. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) prep of interdigital web space
b. Biopsy of skin
c. Infuse sterile saline into skin and aspirate
for culture
d. X-ray of leg
e. Swab surface
Answer a. Potassium hydroxide (KOH)
prep of interdigital web space
Skin breakdown and tinea pedis was seen on
examination. You should always look for an
entry point of skin breakdown in people who
have cellulitis. Healthy skin should not develop cellulitis. You also need to correct any
point of entry or the infection will recur.
Biopsy of skin is virtually never done.

1352/1624

Patients are treated empirically with antistaphylococcal and streptococcal antibiotics
such as cefazolin, nafcillin, or oxacillin for
sensitive organisms. If there is methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
suspected, use vancomycin, linezolid,
ceftaroline, or daptomycin.

Move the clock forward to obtain the
results of the duplex US of the leg and
the KOH prep.

Leg duplex US is >95% sensitive and
specific for deep venous thrombosis
(DVT).

1353/1624

Reports:
Lower extremity duplex US: negative, no clot
KOH: fungal hyphae visible

Fungi do not dissolve in KOH.

Chitin are
• In the fungal cell wall
• Not dissolvable by KOH
• Same as lobster or crab shell

1354/1624

Ceftaroline is the only cephalosporin to
cover MRSA.

Orders:
Apply terbinafine topically to feet.
Continue cefazolin.
Cellulitis and tinea pedis do not have a
clear length of therapy that you can
determine in advance. Move the clock
forward a day at a time and see if
there is improvement in the temperature and examination. Most patients
should markedly improve in 2 to 3
days and be discharged.

1355/1624

Oral MRSA Drugs
• Doxycycline
• Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(TMP-SMZ)
• Clindamycin

Move the clock forward 1 day to reassess the patient’s temperature and examination. Because we rarely ever aspirate and culture out a specific organism for cellulitis, we are stuck
treating empirically and looking for a
response in 24 to 48 hours.

Antibiotics needs at least 12 to 24 hours
even to begin to work.

1356/1624

Interval History: “Feet are less
itchy. Leg is less painful.”
PE:
T: 100.6°F
Extremities: less red and warm

Molds such as Epidermophyton
and Trichophyton cause tinea
pedis. What is the major
difference between molds and
yeast?
a. Response to topical nystatin
b. Formation of spores at room temperature
c. Causing human disease
d. Nothing

1357/1624

Answer b. Formation of spores at room
temperature
Both molds and yeast are fungi. Yeasts are
organisms like Candida. Candida only grows
at body temperature (98.6°F or 37°C). Yeasts
do not form spores at room temperature.
Molds are organisms that cause skin or nail
infections. Also like Aspergillus, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis, they form
spores at room temperature that can exist at
temperatures much colder than room temperature for an indefinite period of time.
That is why you can inhale mold spores in
the environment, but cannot obtain yeast
growth such as Candida in the same way.

When improved, a patient with cellulitis can be sent home on an oral version of the medication used intravenously in the hospital. This is easy for

1358/1624

cefazolin. The oral equivalent of cefazolin is cephalexin. It is essentially
identical to cefazolin. Treatment with
oral equivalents of antistaphylococcal
medication against resistant organisms, such as MRSA, is much more difficult. There is no direct oral equivalent of vancomycin.

Oral vancomycin is not absorbed.

Orders:
Stop cefazolin.
Transfer the patient to home.
Schedule a follow-up office appointment in 7 days.

1359/1624

Continue topical terbinafine (or clotrimazole or nystatin).
Give oral cephalexin.

Treatment of cellulitis is empiric.
No specific organism is identified.
Look for response to treatment, and
switch if there is none.

CASE 5: Urethritis
Setting: ambulatory clinic
CC: “It burns when I urinate.”
VS: T: 98°F

1360/1624

HPI: A 24-year-old man comes to the
clinic complaining of burning on urination for the past 3 days. He feels “when I
have to go, I really have to go in a
hurry” happens 10 times a day. He is
sexually active with both men and women. He has a creamy yellow discharge
coming from his penis.
PMHX:
Herpes genital infection three times in
past
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
test negative 6 months ago
Medications: none
PE:
Genital: discharge from urethra visible
on slight pressure to glans of penis; no
vesicular lesions
Joints: normal
Skin: normal

1361/1624

Initial Orders:
Urethral swab for Gram stain
Voided urine for nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)
Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing

Urethral discharge tells you it is urethritis, not cystitis.

Dysuria + Urethral Discharge =
Urethritis

What is the main difference
between urethritis in men and
cervicitis in women?
a. A urethral swab is used for Gram stain
testing.

1362/1624

b. NAAT is required.
c. Chlamydia is the most common cause.
d. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin are used.
e. Cefixime is used.
Answer a. A urethral swab is used for Gram
stain testing.
The management of urethritis in men and
cervicitis in women is the same except for
two points:
1. Gram stain testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae is only used in men.
2. Women can do a self-administered swab
into the vagina.
Otherwise, both cervicitis and urethritis are
treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin
and both are most commonly caused by
chlamydia. Neither should be treated with
cefixime.

1363/1624

Neisseria gonorrhoeae
• Gram-negative diplococcus
• Chocolate agar growth medium
• CO2 needed
• Oxidase positive

On CCS, add HIV testing for every
person with an sexually transmitted
disease (STD). You will never lose
points for hepatitis B testing and
Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) rapid plasma reagin
(RPR) for syphilis.
The patient agrees to HIV testing.
Report:

1364/1624

Gram stain of urethral discharge:
gram-negative diplococci inside
multiple neutrophils (Figure 10-5)

Figure 10-5. Gram stain of urethral discharge from a male
patient with gonorrhea shows gram-negative intracellular
monococci and diplococci. (Reproduced with permission
from the Public Health Agency of Canada.)

1365/1624

Additional written consent is not needed
for HIV testing.

Neisseria grows on Thayer-Martin
medium
• Antibiotics in media
• Vancomycin, colistin, and nystatin
• Kills off potentially competitive
bacteria

Orders:
Ceftriaxone intramuscularly (IM)
Azithromycin orally
HIV test
VDRL-RPR

1366/1624

Treat both chlamydia and gonorrhea at
the same time.

Chlamydia trachomatis
• It is an intracellular parasite.
• NAAT is the best test.
• Use doxycycline, azithromycin, or
erythromycin.
Chlamydia is present in 50% of patients
with gonorrhea.

Do not forget to “counsel,” “educate,” or
“advise” on safe sex practices for any
patient with an STD, as well as to do
screening and treatment of the patient’s sexual partners. Without

1367/1624

treating the partner, the patient will
likely become reinfected.
The patient can leave to go home
after the ceftriaxone and azithromycin
are given. Directly observed therapy in
the clinic for oral azithromycin is preferred. Cefixime orally is not as effective
as ceftriaxone orally. The patient and
his partner should return to discuss the
HIV, hepatitis, and syphilis test in a
week. A routine test of cure is not
needed if the patient’s symptoms
resolve.

CASE 6: Syphilis
Setting: ambulatory clinic
CC: “I have a sore on my penis.”
VS: normal

1368/1624

HPI: A 34-year-old man with an ulcer
on his penis for the past several days
comes to the walk-in clinic. He had a
raised papule a few days ago that started to ulcerate after 2 days. He has never had a lesion like this before, although
he has had herpes simplex vesicles in the
past. The lesion is not painful. He was
on vacation 3 weeks ago and had multiple unprotected sexual encounters with
other men.
PMHX:
Herpes simplex
HIV negative
Medications: none
PE:
Genital: There is a 2-cm lesion on the
shaft of the penis with raised, indurated edges. There is nontender inguinal adenopathy present and no vesicles.

1369/1624

Initial Orders:
Darkfield microscopy
VDRL or RPR

Darkfield microscopy is the most accurate test for primary syphilis.
• Spirochetes are mobile when seen
(Figure 10-6)

1370/1624

Figure 10-6. Microscopic view of Treponema pallidum.
With darkfield microscopy, spirochetes appear as motile,
bright corkscrews against a black background. (Reproduced
with permission from Cox D, Liu H, Moreland AA, et al.
Syphilis. In Morse S, Ballard RC, Holmes KK, et al., eds. Atlas of Sexually Transmitted Diseases, 3rd ed. Edinburgh:
Mosby; 2003.)

Treponema pallidum
• Never cultured
• Spiral gram-negative

1371/1624

• Spirochete

VDRL and RPR
• They are nontreponemal tests.
• They detect anticardiolipin antibodies.
• They are 75% to 80% sensitive in detecting primary syphilis.

Darkfield microscopy can be done on
the spot in a person with a genital lesion. This test is more sensitive than
the nontreponemal tests, the VDRL
and RPR. Nontreponemal tests need
time to become abnormal.
Report:

1372/1624

Darkfield microscopy: positive for
mobile spirochetes

Darkfield microscopy is 100% specific.

In real life, most places do not use the
darkfield examination. Only the RPR
or VDRL is done initially, followed by
specific treponemal tests such as the
fluorescent treponemal antibody
absorption (FTA-ABS) test. On CCS,
however, you get to be an “idealist,”
where every test you want is
available.

1373/1624

What is the management of a
penicillin-allergic patient with a
chancre?
a. Desensitization to penicillin
b. Ceftriaxone IM
c. Doxycycline orally
d. Erythromycin
Answer c. Doxycycline orally
Oral doxycycline is more effective than
erythromycin. Desensitization is not necessary for primary or secondary syphilis. Desensitization is performed in those with tertiary syphilis and those who are pregnant.
Ceftriaxone is a less effective alternative to
IV penicillin for tertiary syphilis.

1374/1624

Desensitization is not needed for genital
lesions.
Doxycycline orally is enough.

Orders:
• Benzathine penicillin: one IM
injection
Keep all patients given IM injections
in the clinic for a few hours for observation postinjection. Move the clock
forward at 1-hour intervals for 3
hours and do an Interval History.

Chancre

1375/1624

• It is the main manifestation of primary
syphilis.
• They resolve spontaneously in 3 to 6
weeks.
• Twenty-five percent recur as secondary
syphilis.

Interval History: (at 3 hours after IM
penicillin)
Headache, myalgia, and rash
develop (Jarisch-Herxheimer
reaction)

Mechanism of Jarisch-Herxheimer
Reaction

1376/1624

• Release of treponemal
lipopolysaccharide
• Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)
• Interleukin-6
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is not
dangerous.

Orders:
Transfer patient to home.
Have patient use aspirin.
Have patient return in 1 to 2 days for
follow-up.
The patient returns the following day.
Interval history: “Resolution of
fever and myalgia”

1377/1624

Report:
VDRL or RPR: positive at 1:256
FTA positive
A single IM injection of penicillin is all
that is needed for primary and most
secondary syphilis. Bring the patient
back at 3, 6, and 12 months. Recheck
the VDRL or RPR at each visit. There
should be a marked reduction in the
titer. The FTA will stay positive
lifelong.

CASE 7: Herpes Zoster:
Shingles
Setting: office
CC: “My side hurts.”

1378/1624

VS: BP: 142/92 mm Hg; P: 102 beats/
minute; T: 99.2°F; R: 18 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 72-year-old man comes to your
office with complaints of pain in the left
side of his chest for the past 5 days. The
pain is continuous and increasing in intensity. He comes now because he has
developed a rash at the site where the
pain is.
PMHX:
Benign prostatic hypertrophy
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD)—mild
Former smoker—stopped 15 years ago
Medications:
Tiotropium regularly
Albuterol intermittently
Finasteride

1379/1624

Tamsulosin

Pain can elevate blood pressure (BP).
Single BP elevations with pain are
meaningless.

PE:
General: uncomfortable from pain
Chest: vesicular rash in a stripe
across the left side of the chest. Rash
does not cross the midline. Vesicles
are fluid filled. No crusting is visible.

1380/1624

Herpes zoster rash does not cross the
midline.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is stored in
the dorsal root ganglia—one side only.

Which of the following is most
important to do first for this
patient?
a. Tzanck prep
b. Viral culture
c. Antiviral treatment
d. Varicella serology of blood
Answer c. Antiviral treatment

1381/1624

When there is a clear dermatomal distribution of herpes zoster or shingles, neither the
Tzanck prep nor viral culture is necessary.
Nothing else besides VZV gives a vesicular
rash in a dermatomal distribution. When
testing is needed, the viral culture of the skin
is the most accurate test. Viral culture needs
to be done on specific viral media. It will not
grow on blood agar. The Tzanck smear can
be useful in herpes infections, particularly
VZV. VZV takes 10 to 14 days to grow, so although viral culture may be the most accurate test for herpes zoster, it is most often not
clinically practical because it does not allow
an answer in time to affect treatment.

Tzanck Smear
• Swab or smear of lesion
• Pathologic and cytologic test on a slide

1382/1624

• Like a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear of the
cervix
• Multinucleated giant cells in positive
test
• Cannot distinguish herpes zoster from
herpes simplex

Herpes Virus Family
• Simplex 1 and 2
• VZV
• Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
• Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
• Human herpes virus 6,7, 8

Initial Orders:
Give valacyclovir orally.

1383/1624

Keep vesicles covered.
Herpes Zoster = Shingles = Varicella
Reactivation

Can varicella spread to others?
a. Never
b. Only adults who have not had shingles
c. Only persons who never had chicken pox
or the vaccine
d. Children yes, adults no
Answer c. Only persons who never had
chicken pox or the vaccine
It is possible for VZV that causes shingles reactivation to spread to others. It is highly unlikely if the shingles is only on one or two
dermatomes, but it is possible. The patient
should not be allowed near patients who are

1384/1624

immunocompromised and have never had
chicken pox or the vaccine.

• VZV can spread to nonimmune
persons.
• VZV is spread by airborne
transmission.

Valacyclovir = Acyclovir = Famciclovir
Equal Efficacy

Steroids in Zoster
• Not clearly beneficial

1385/1624

Move the case forward to be sure that
there is no spread to other dermatomes and that it does not disseminate.
In addition, you want to be sure that
there is crusting of the lesions, indicating that healing has occurred and that
there is no possibility of transmission.
Interval History: “Lesions are
crusting, but there is still some pain.”
PE:
No fever
Chest: crusting of vesicular lesions

Transmissibility stops when the lesions
dry and crust.

1386/1624

What is the mechanism of
valacyclovir?
a. Protein inhibition
b. Cell wall
c. Thymidine kinase
d. Reverse transcriptase
Answer c. Thymidine kinase
Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir work
by inhibition of thymidine kinase. Without
an effective thymidine kinase, the genetic
material of the herpes virus cannot reproduce. These agents are effective against
herpes simplex and VZV. They are not effective against CMV.

1387/1624

What is the best postexposure
prophylaxis for a pregnant
woman exposed to shingles or
chicken pox?
a. Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG)
b. VZIG and varicella vaccine
c. Varicella vaccine
Answer
a. Varicella-zoster
globulin (VZIG)

immune

VZIG offers some protection against acquiring new varicella infection. The persons most
in need of postexposure prophylaxis are
those who are pregnant and those who are
immunocompromised, such as those undergoing chemotherapy and those using steroids. Pregnant women should not receive
varicella vaccine because it is a live-attenuated vaccine. Live vaccines should be
avoided in pregnancy because of concern
that they might spread to the fetus.

1388/1624

Varicella vaccine is a live-attenuated
virus.
Avoid in varicella vaccine immunocompromised or pregnant persons.

VZIG
• Immunoglobulin G (IgG)
• Intercepts VZV before it infects
lymphocytes

Move the clock forward 1 to 2 weeks to
see if postherpetic neuralgia has developed. Neither steroids nor tricyclic
antidepressants (TCAs) will prevent
the development of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). If PHN does develop,

1389/1624

acceptable treatments are pregabalin,
gabapentin, or TCAs.
Interval History: “The patient’s lesions have fully healed, and there is no
pain at this time.”

Which of the following is most
likely to benefit the patient?
a. Chronic valacyclovir use
b. Zoster vaccine
c. Prednisone
Answer b. Zoster vaccine
Zoster vaccine in a person such as this is not
to prevent the primary varicella infection.
Zoster vaccine is to prevent the reactivation
of shingles. It is the same type of vaccine, but
at much higher dose. Zoster vaccine should

1390/1624

be given to all persons at the age of 60 years
to prevent shingles from occurring.

Five percent of people older than age 60
years get shingles.

Give zoster vaccine to those older than
age 60 routinely!

CASE 8: Infectious Diarrhea
Setting: ED
CC: “I have diarrhea.”
VS: BP: 104/62 mm Hg; P: 94 beats/
minute; T: 101.6°F; R: 18 breaths/
minute

1391/1624

HPI: A 30-year-old resident in internal
medicine comes to the ED at his own
hospital with 1 day of watery brown
diarrhea with blood in it and abdominal
pain. He is generally a very healthy person and this is the first time this has
happened to him. He does not recall an
exposure to infected or contaminated
food. None of his friends have diarrhea
nor does anyone in his family with
whom he has recently eaten.
PMHx/Medications: none
PE:
General: very weak and tired
appearing
Abdomen: soft, but diffusely tender; no
masses found
Chest: clear bilaterally
Initial Orders:

1392/1624

Orthostatic blood pressure
measurement
CHEM-7
CBC
Blood cultures
Stool culture, ova/parasite
examination

Stool WBCs
• Detect invasive diarrhea
• Sign of inflammation
• Not needed if blood visible in stool

Use methylene blue to detect WBCs in
stool.

1393/1624

Orthostasis
• Detects >15% to 20% volume loss
• Pulse rate increase by 10 beats/minute
• Systolic BP decrease by 20 mm Hg

It is not always clear whether to use
IV fluids in a person with diarrhea.
Most infectious diarrhea is not severe
enough to need IV fluids or antibiotics.
Use orthostasis as an indicator of how
severe diarrhea is as you move the
clock forward.
Move clock forward 5 minutes to
get results of orthostatic BP and pulse
rate measurement:
Systolic BP drops to 86/52 mm Hg;
pulse rate rises to 118 beats/minute

1394/1624

Orthostasis = Severe Diarrhea = IV
Saline Needed

Volume Depletion Detection
1. Mechanoreceptors (“stretch” receptors) respond in the aorta and carotid
sinuses.
2. Decreased stimulation results.
3. Cranial nerves IX and X transmit to
the medulla.
4. Vasoconstriction and tachycardia
result.

Orders:

1395/1624

Normal saline bolus, then
continuously
Ciprofloxacin orally

Antibiotics for Diarrhea
Fever + Blood + Orthostasis
Pain + Tenderness

What is the most likely organism?
a. Campylobacter
b. Shigella
c. Yersinia
d. Viral
e. Staphylococcus
Answer a. Campylobacter

1396/1624

Viruses and staphylococci do not cause blood
in the stool with diarrhea. The rest of the answer relies on statistical data. Campylobacter is more common than Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, or E. coli as a cause of infectious diarrhea, especially from food
poisoning.

When bolusing with fluids, move the
clock forward only 5 minutes to detect
an improvement in BP and pulse rate.
These effects will be nearly instantaneous on CCS.

• The carotid baroreceptor transmits to
the brainstem by glossopharyngeal
nerve.

1397/1624

• The aortic baroreceptor transmits to
the brainstem by the vagus nerve.

Move the clock 5 minutes. Repeat vital
signs
VS: P: 100 beats/minute; BP 106/70
mm Hg

Yersinia
• Gram-negative bacillus
• Siderophilic (likes iron to grow)
• Can grow in the cold
• Invades Peyer patches in ileum
• Simulates appendicitis

1398/1624

Reports:
CHEM-7:
Bicarbonate: 18 mEq/L (low)
Potassium: 3.0 mEq/L (low)
Chloride: 115 mEq/L (high)
Sodium: 140 mEq/L (normal)
CBC: WBCs 14,000/μL
Diarrhea = Normal Anion Gap
Diarrhea = High Chloride Level +
Low Bicarbonate Level

Metabolic Acidosis in Diarrhea
• There is a normal anion gap.
• The colon excretes bicarbonate.
• The colon excretes potassium.

1399/1624

Once you find potassium level abnormalities, you should replace potassium
immediately and recheck the potassium level.

Orders:
Oral potassium
Continue IV saline and oral
ciprofloxacin

Shigella
• It is resistant to stomach acid.
• A very small number of organisms can
cause infection (10–100).
• It does not ferment lactose.

1400/1624

• Shigella toxin causes hemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS).

Move the clock forward 1 hour and repeat the potassium level and vital
signs.
VS: BP 110/72 mm Hg; P: 92 beats/
minute; T: 101°F
Report:
Potassium 4.0 mEq/L
Move the clock forward 12 hours.
Most infectious diarrhea will show improvement in 12 to 24 hours and is
self-limited. Give antibiotics for infectious diarrhea by mouth, because the

1401/1624

gastrointestinal (GI) tract is where the
infections is.
On the second hospital day, do an
Interval History to see if the diarrhea is
improving. Look at the fever curve to
see if the temperature is coming down
with the use of antibiotics.

Antibiotics need 12 to 24 hours to start
working.

Interval History: “Frequency of
diarrhea is decreasing. Temperature
is 99.8°F.”
Orders:

1402/1624

CHEM-7

Campylobacter (Figure 10-7)
• Gram-negative bacillus
• Helical shape
• Grows at 42°C (higher than usual body
temperature)

Move the clock to the third hospital day.
Fever and diarrhea resolve.
Reports:

1404/1624

CHEM-7: normal
Stool Culture: Campylobacter
Blood Culture: no growth
You can discharge the patient and send
him home. No further antibiotics are
needed past 3 days for campylobacter.
This is a follow-up “as needed” type
of case on the clock at the end.

CASE 9: Malaria and Travel
Medicine
Setting: office
CC: “I’m going on a trip to Africa for
three weeks.”
VS: normal

1405/1624

HPI: A 24-year-old healthy medical
student is going on a 3-week trip to
Africa as part of a medical mission and
vacation. She is here seeking advice
about vaccinations and prophylaxis.
PMHx/Medications: none
PE: normal

Which of the following is not an
appropriate preventive therapy
for this type of traveler?
a. Ciprofloxacin daily
b. Hepatitis A vaccine
c. Malaria prophylaxis
d. Typhoid vaccine
Answer a. Ciprofloxacin daily
It is not necessary to use daily prophylactic
antibiotics to prevent diarrhea. It is

1406/1624

inappropriate to use antibiotics in advance of
developing diarrhea, and if asked, you
should specifically refuse to do so. The traveler should be careful to eat foods that are
fully cooked or can be peeled, such as bananas or oranges. She should avoid street food
as well. Hepatitis A and typhoid fever vaccinations are routine where the water supply is
not safe. Malaria prophylaxis is advised in
many places around the world.
CCS will not require you to memorize
which specific countries need specific malaria regimens. No one will expect you to remember the chloroquine sensitivity or resistance levels in 190 separate countries in the
world.

Which of these is not appropriate
for malaria prophylaxis?
a. Mefloquine
b. Artemisinin

1407/1624

c. Atovaquone/Proguanil
d. Doxycycline
e. Netting
Answer b. Artemisinin
Artemisinin-containing combination therapy
is used as a drug of choice in acute malaria.
It is not a prophylactic medication. The two
most commonly used preventive malaria
treatments are mefloquine and atovaquone/
proguanil. Both of these are equal in efficacy.
Doxycycline is used in areas of mefloquine
resistance in Southeast Asia. Doxycycline is
not the best first choice because there is a
risk
of
photosensitivity
reaction.
Chloroquine can be used in areas where
there is clear chloroquine sensitivity. All of
these kill blood schizonts of malaria. Mosquito netting at night is one of the most effective preventive measures you can do for
malaria.

1408/1624

Trophozoites = Red Blood Cell (RBC)
“Ring” Seen in Malaria Smear (Figure
10-8)

Figure 10-8. Malaria. Plasmodium falciparum. Blood
film. Several red cells contain trophozoites (ring forms). The
arrows point to a ring form and double-dot ring form. (Reproduced with permission from Lichtman MA, et al. Lichtman’s Atlas of Hematology, www.accessmedicine.com.)

1409/1624

Trophozoites develop into schizonts in
RBCs.

Schizonts = RBCs “Pregnant” with
Malaria = Burst = Spread

All of these kill blood schizonts of
malaria.

Initial Orders:
Hepatitis A vaccine
Typhoid fever vaccine
Mefloquine

1410/1624

Mefloquine
• Must start 3 weeks before departure
• Safe in pregnancy
• Not for use with severe psychiatric
illness
• Not for use with history of seizures

Atovaquone/Proguanil
• Active against liver schizonts of
falciparum
• Prevent blood schizont release

Primaquine
• Kills liver schizonts of all species
• Kills blood schizonts of all species except Plasmodium falciparum

1411/1624

The patient is vaccinated against hepatitis A and is given the typhoid fever
vaccine to take at home over several
days. The prescription for mefloquine
(or atovaquone/proguanil) is also given to her.

Genetic Protective Factors against
Malaria
• No Duffy antigen on RBC
• Sickle cell trait
• Thalassemia trait

The patient calls you 2 months later.
She returned from her trip 2 weeks
ago and now has a fever. She did not

1412/1624

remember to take preventive therapy
for malaria.
Orders:
Transfer to ED
Thick and thin smear for malaria
Fingerstick for glucose on arrival
CBC
CHEM-7

All patients with malaria have some GI
distress.
It is not dangerous.

1413/1624

Which of these indicates severe
malaria?
a. Positive thick smear with elevated
bilirubin
b. Positive rapid diagnostic test with enlarged spleen
c. Ten percent of cells with plasmodia
present with hypoglycemia
d. Temperature 104°F and hematocrit 32%
Answer c. Ten percent of cells with plasmodia present with hypoglycemia
Malaria is complicated or dangerous when
parasitemia goes above 5% to 10% of cells. At
this parasite level, hypoglycemia develops as
well as dangerous signs of disease, such as:
• Cerebral involvement
• Renal failure
• Metabolic acidosis
• Respiratory distress

1414/1624

Mechanism of Hypoglycemia in Severe
Malaria
• There is decreased gluconeogenesis.
• There is decreased glycogen level.
• Parasites consume the glucose.

Hypovolemia + Hemoglobinuria =
Renal Failure = Blackwater Fever

Mechanism of Acidosis
• There is increased lactate level from
the parasite.
• There is decreased liver and renal
clearance of the lactate.
• Parasites block the blood flow, which
increases anaerobic glycolysis.

1415/1624

The patient comes to the ED. She has a
temperature of 103°F with chills.
PE:
Neurologic: normal
Chest: normal, no respiratory
distress
Reports:
Fingerstick: glucose 80 mg/dL
CHEM-7: total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL
(slight elevation); indirect bilirubin
elevated
CBC: hematocrit 34%; platelets
128,000/μL
Reticulocytes 4%
Normal blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
and creatinine levels
Thick and thin smear: positive for P.
falciparum, 2% parasitemia

1416/1624

The thick smear detects malaria.
The thin smear speciates.

Rapid Diagnostic Tests for Malaria
• Antibody tests
• Detect histidine-rich protein
• Detect plasmodium antigens

Which of these is not appropriate
for treating this patient?
a. Artemether/Lumefantrine
b. Atovaquone/Proguanil
c. Mefloquine and doxycycline
d. Quinine and doxycycline
e. Chloroquine

1417/1624

Answer e. Chloroquine
It is inappropriate to use chloroquine alone
to treat malaria acquired in Africa, even if it
is uncomplicated. The Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends
artemisinin-containing regimens such as:
• Artesunate and amodiaquine or
• Artemether/Lumefantrine
However, any of the other regimens can
be safely used.
On CCS, this patient has mild malaria.
After treatment, she can be seen “as
needed.”

CASE 10: Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome

1418/1624

Setting: office
CC: “Here for the results of my HIV
test.”
VS: normal
HPI: A 34-year-old man comes to your
office for a discussion of his HIV test,
which he took when he had an episode
of urethritis 1 week ago. He has been
asymptomatic. You have just informed
the patient that his test is positive.
PMHX:
Urethritis: finished treatment with
ceftriaxone and azithromycin
Herpes simplex: 1 to 2 episodes a year
Medications: none
PE: normal
Initial Orders:

1419/1624

Lymphocyte subsets (CD4 count)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) HIV
RNA viral load assay
Genotype of HIV virus
CBC, lipid panel
RPR
Purified protein derivative (PPD) skin
test
Hepatitis B serology (surface antibody,
core antibody, surface antigen)
Hepatitis C antibody
CCS and Step 3 examination, in general,
very much want you to know the
routine health maintenance and preventive medicine of diseases such as diabetes and HIV. It does not matter that
the patient is asymptomatic with a normal physical examination. The tests listed here are needed. They are not extra
or unnecessary. Students often ask, “Are
you penalized for unnecessary tests?”

1420/1624

The answer is: Absolutely you are!
However, testing for latent tuberculosis
(TB), hepatitis, and syphilis are not unnecessary in HIV.

Why get genotyping if there is no
previous drug treatment?
a. All patients have some resistance.
b. Resistance to even one drug can be damaging at the start of therapy.
c. You are documenting the baseline. It has
no effect on therapy.
Answer b. Resistance to even one drug can
be damaging at the start of therapy.
If the patient is resistant to one of the medications you plan to start, it can be damaging
to treatment. There is a <5% chance of resistance in a treatment-naïve person, but it is
critical to be sure that your patient is

1421/1624

sensitive to all three medications at the start
of therapy.

The patient returns in a few days to
discuss results. It is important to see
the patient frequently at the beginning
of therapy to form a bonded doctorpatient relationship that encourages
adherence to medications.
Do not forget to take a thorough
sexual history and to advise partner notification. Although you have the legal
right to notify the partners yourself,
Step 3 examination will always want
you to encourage the patient to notify
the partners themselves.
Reports:
Lymphocyte subsets (CD4 count):
335 cells/mm3

CBC, Lipid panel: normal
RPR: Nonreactive
PPD skin test: no reaction
Hepatitis B serology (surface antibody, core antibody, surface antigen): negative
Hepatitis C antibody: positive

All patients with CD4 counts <500 cells/
mm3 should be on antiretroviral
therapy.

1423/1624

PPD >5 mm is positive in HIV.

Discuss the need to take antiretroviral
therapy with the patient. Make sure he
understand the need for essentially
100% adherence to medication to assure control of the virus. There is no
point in starting antiretroviral medications to which the patient will not
adhere.
Orders:
Emtricitabine
Tenofovir
Efavirenz

Protease Inhibitors
• Prevent packaging of HIV
• Prevent protein covering of RNA
• Stop infection of next HIV virus

genotype to see if there is resistance.
Otherwise, just continue lifelong
therapy.
On CCS, it can be difficult to tell how
long to manage the case. Just keep moving the clock forward. Seeing “this case
will end in 5 minutes of real time” can be
jarring to some people. It does not mean
you made a mistake.

CHAPTER 11

1431/1624

EMERGENCY
MEDICINE
CASE 1: Tricyclic Antidepressant Overdose
Setting: emergency department (ED)
CC: “I feel confused and my mouth is
dry.”
VS: BP: 104/68 mm Hg; P: 112 beats/
minute; T: 99.8°F; R: 22 breaths/
minute
HPI: A 23-year-old man with a history
of depression is brought to the ED because of confusion developing over the
past several hours. He has been

1432/1624

drinking alcohol and taking a number
of unknown substances. He became
more disoriented and obtunded just as
he passed through the triage process in
the ED and went to the bathroom. The
staff were concerned that he had taken
something in the bathroom.
The ED is the most “time-sensitive”
part of the hospital. It is where the
computer-based case simulation (CCS) is
meant to evaluate your proper understanding of the right order in which to
give treatments and do tests. It is not being “picky” to insist you know the right
timing and sequence of patient
management.

Which of these is most important
to do first?
a. Give naloxone, thiamine, and dextrose.

1433/1624

b. Test acetaminophen and aspirin levels.
c. Do a urine or blood toxicology screen.
d. Order gastric emptying (lavage).
e. Give oxygen.
f. Do an endotracheal intubation.
Answer a. Give naloxone, thiamine, and
dextrose.
Prescription opiate overdose is markedly increasing. Patients are far more likely to die of
a prescription opiate overdose than an illegal
opiate such as heroin. Naloxone works instantly, and if the patient’s altered mental
status is from opiates, you will know immediately. Naloxone works before you even
leave the patient’s bedside. There is no significant danger from acute opiate withdrawal.
Dextrose and thiamine are routinely given to
every person with acute mental status
changes of unclear etiology.

1434/1624

Diagnostic testing with toxicology screening is important, but not as important as instantly reversing opiate intoxication or hypoglycemia. Oxygen is not important in the
absence of hypoxia or respiratory distress.
Do not intubate, when you might be able to
just wake the person up with naloxone.

Fast reversal with naloxone is better
than lavage.

Get aspirin and acetaminophen levels on
every overdose.

PMHX:

1435/1624

Depression
Anxiety
Medications:
Alprazolam
Amitriptyline
PE:
General: lethargic, increasingly
sleepy
Neurologic: stuporous; incomplete
examination because of inability to
follow commands
Head, ears, eyes, nose, throat
(HEENT): dilated pupils
Abdomen: decreased bowel sounds
Cardiovascular: tachycardia only
Skin: hot, dry, flushed
Initial Orders:
Naloxone, thiamine, dextrose

1436/1624

Urine toxicology screen
Aspirin and acetaminophen levels
Comprehensive metabolic panel
(CHEM-20)

Patients often ingest aspirin or acetaminophen in conjunction with the drug
overdose.

Move the clock forward only 5 minutes
and do an “Interval History.” If naloxone is going to work, it will take immediate effect.
Interval History: “There is no effect
with naloxone, dextrose, or thiamine.
The patient remains confused and

1437/1624

delirious. The urine toxicology, chemistry, and drug levels have been collected and sent to the laboratory.”
On CCS, medications are considered as administered or given instantly. You must move the clock forward, however, to see the effect.

Why not give flumazenil to
patients (such as this one) with
altered mental status of unclear
etiology?
a. Benzodiazepine overdose is rare.
b. Acute benzodiazepine withdrawal causes
seizures.
c. Benzodiazepine overdose is not fatal.
d. Flumazenil is ineffective.
e. You should give it.

1438/1624

Answer b. Acute benzodiazepine withdrawal causes seizures.
Flumazenil is an immediate antagonist of
benzodiazepines, which should result in an
immediate reversal of benzodiazepine effect.
That is why it causes seizures. In this case
with potential tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)
overdose evident from the first sentence, it is
even more likely to cause seizures. TCA overdose produces seizures. Being on benzodiazepines protects against those seizures.

Flumazenil creates benzodiazepine
withdrawal.

The case is moved forward and there
is no improvement in altered mental
status.

1439/1624

PE:
HEENT: dilated pupils
Neurological: lethargic, disoriented
Skin: dry, warm

TCA antihistamine effect creates disorientation and lethargy.

What is the most urgent step?
a. TCA level
b. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
c. Calcium chloride
d. Pyridostigmine
Answer b. Electrocardiogram (ECG)

1440/1624

ECG is the most urgent step because it detects the most common cause of death in
TCA overdose, which is cardiac arrhythmia
(Figure 11-1). TCA level is important, but not
as important as seeing if we have life-threatening TCA toxicity.

Figure 11-1. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with manifestations
of cyclic antidepressant toxicity. The right axis deviation of
the terminal 40 msec of the QRS complex is because of cyclic antidepressant toxicity. Note the large R wave in lead
aVR and S wave in lead I. (Reproduced with permission
from Tintinalli JE, et al. Tintinalli’s Emergency Medicine, A
Comprehensive Study Guide, 7th ed. New York: McGrawHill; 2011.)

Pyridostigmine does increase ACh, but
this will have no effect on TCA overdose.

1441/1624

The patient continues to be lethargic.
ECG: wide QRS (>120 msec)

With this additional information,
what is the most urgent step?
a. Bicarbonate
b. Atropine
c. Lidocaine
d. Amiodarone
Answer a. Bicarbonate
Bicarbonate administration will protect the
heart. This is the fastest way to reverse the
effect of TCAs on the heart. Bicarbonate is
not given to increase excretion of TCA. There
will be no effect on the blood level of TCAs. It
is given entirely to reverse the possibility of
an imminent arrhythmia.

1442/1624

Lidocaine and amiodarone are used when
there actually is an arrhythmia that has developed. We never use these agents
prophylactically.

Always test acetaminophen and aspirin
levels with drug overdose!
Co-ingestion is common.

The patient is given a stat dose of intravenous (IV) bicarbonate. Move the
clock forward. A repeat ECG shows
the QRS duration has gone back to 100
msec.

1443/1624

TCAs have a quinidine-like effect on the
heart.
TCAs inhibit fast sodium ion (Na+)
channels in phase 0.

Transfer the patient to the intensive
care unit (ICU).
Orders:
Repeat ECG in 1 hour
Telemetry monitoring
Repeat dose of bicarbonate

What is the mechanism of
decreased bowel sounds in this
patient?
a. Increased ACh

1444/1624

b. Decreased ACh
c. Decreased norepinephrine
d. Increased serotonin
Answer b. Decreased ACh
TCAs inhibit the effect of ACh throughout
the body. The anticholinergic effect of TCAs
causes constipation and it also explains the
diminished bowel sounds with a TCA
overdose.
The anticholinergic effect of TCAs can
also cause dilated pupils and dry skin.

Sweat production is stimulated by ACh.

1445/1624

The only effect that ACh has on the sympathetic system is in the production of
sweat.

After the administration of bicarbonate and transfer of the patient to the
ICU, there is an improvement in the
ECG. Over the next few hours, the patient’s mental status starts to improve.

• TCAs cause death by:
Wide QRS and arrhythmia
Seizures
• TCAs cause seizures by:
Increasing central nervous system
(CNS) norepinephrine levels

1446/1624

Decreasing the inhibitory effect of
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on
neurons

Over the next 12 to 24 hours, the patient
starts to wake up.
Reports:
Amitriptyline level elevated
Chemistries normal
Repeat ECG (second hospital day):
normal QRS
When the ECG and QRS are normal
without the use of bicarbonate, the patient can be safely transferred to regular hospital floor. If there is a question
of possible intentional overdose, always get a psychiatric evaluation. For

1447/1624

a patient like this with a history or depression and anxiety, psychiatric evaluation is beneficial as well.

Adverse Effects of TCA
• Dry mouth
• Constipation
• Urine retention
• Dry eyes

Adverse Effect Mechanism
• Inhibition of ACh

1448/1624

CASE 2: Acetaminophen
Overdose
Setting: ED
CC: Vomiting
VS: BP: 110/70 mm Hg; P: 108 beats/
minute T: 98°F; R: 12 breaths/minute
HPI: A 46-year-old man comes to the
ED after intentionally trying to end his
life by taking a bottle of acetaminophen
pills within the last hour. He took 30
extra-strength 500-mg pills. He is extremely nauseated. He has not vomited
yet.

1449/1624

What is the single most important
thing to do first?
a. Test acetaminophen level now.
b. Test acetaminophen level in 4 hours.
c. Give N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and charcoal.
d. Give N-acetylcysteine (NAC) alone.
e. Order a psychiatry consultation.
f. Do gastric lavage.
Answer c. Give N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and
charcoal.
NAC is a specific antidote for acetaminophen. Charcoal blocks absorption, but
does not interfere with NAC. A level of the
drug is important, but not as important as
preventing toxicity of the drug. Gastric lavage has no utility in acetaminophen overdose
ever. Charcoal and NAC are superior to any
attempt at gastric emptying. Acetaminophen
level reaches its peak in 4 hours after

1450/1624

ingestion, but is still not as important as preventing toxicity. On CCS, do not expect a
consultant to do anything for you.
Knowing the amount of acetaminophen
ingested is more than enough reason to give
NAC and charcoal. You do not have to wait
for the blood level of acetaminophen.

• Do not wait for blood level.
• Give the NAC and charcoal.

PMHX:
Alcoholism
Medications: none
Acetaminophen overdose: Quick administration of NAC and charcoal is

1451/1624

essential to protect the liver. Do not
wait for time it takes to do the physical
examination.
Orders:
NAC IV or oral depending on the
presence of vomiting
Charcoal
CHEM-20

Make sure you get baseline liver function tests (LFTs)!

PE:
General: nauseated, no abnormalities seen

1452/1624

Chest, Heart, Abdomen: normal
Neurological: no focal deficits; normal mental status

Lavage removes:
• Fifty percent at 1 hour
• Fifteen percent at 2 hours
• Less than NAC and charcoal

Giving ipecac on an empty stomach is always wrong.

When is gastric emptying the right
answer?
a. Never

1453/1624

b. For caustic ingestions (e.g., lye, drain
cleaner)
c. For pills with no antidote within the hour
of ingestion
d. For more than 2 hours after ingestion
Answer c. For pills with no antidote within
the hour of ingestion
Gastric emptying is almost never the correct
thing to do. It is rarely done. Gastric emptying with an Ewald gastric tube is done only
within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion of a pill that
has no other antidote. Lavage is absolutely
contraindicated with the ingestion of
caustics. When you lavage out caustics, all
you do is increase the chance of burning the
mouth and upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract
on its way out of the stomach. Emptying is
absolutely useless when more than 2 hours
have passed since the ingestion.

1454/1624

Normal gastric emptying time:
• For pills without food, 30 to 60
minutes
• With most foods, 2 hours

Initial Orders:
NAC
Charcoal
Repeat CHEM-20 and LFTs
Repeat acetaminophen level
Once you administer NAC and charcoal, there is nothing more that can be
actively done to reverse or prevent
hepatic toxicity from acetaminophen.
Acetaminophen is metabolized into an
end product that is a profound oxidant
stress to the liver. Acetaminophen

1455/1624

metabolites deplete the body of glutathione reductase.

• NAC restores glutathione reductase.
• Charcoal, microscopically, has an
enormous surface area to bind drugs.

Reports:
CHEM-20 and LFTs: normal
Acetaminophen level: elevated
Drug Toxicity = Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)

1456/1624

What in this patient’s history
makes it more likely for him to
have liver damage or toxicity?
a. Time from ingestion to arrival
b. Use of NAC at same time as charcoal
c. History of alcoholism
d. Not doing gastric emptying
e. Age >30 years
f. Gender
Answer c. History of alcoholism
Alcoholics need less acetaminophen to result
in toxicity. The liver is already partially damaged in alcoholics. Alcoholics have already
undergone a significant degree of oxidant
stress to the liver. In an average-sized person, toxicity begins above 10 g of acetaminophen. Fatality from the depletion of
glutathione reductase begins around 15 g of
ingestion. In an alcoholic, toxicity may occur

1457/1624

from 6 to 8 g of ingestion and fatality at 10 to
12 g of ingestion.
Alcoholism decreases the toxic dose
needed to hurt the liver.

As you move the clock forward, remember to give repeated doses of oral
charcoal and NAC. Repeat the chemistry level every day to be sure there is
no liver toxicity. There is nothing more
you can do in therapy besides NAC
and charcoal, but it will be expected on
CCS that you should know that you
need to check LFTs and prothrombin
time (PT). If toxicity does occur and it
is severe, all you can do is try to get a
liver transplantation.
Orders:
LFTs

1458/1624

PT

NAC is only effective if used within 24
hours after the ingestion.

NAC is given for 1 to 2 days. Charcoal
is given for the first 24 hours. Charcoal
will not only block the absorption of
acetaminophen, it will remove it from
the bloodstream after it has been well
absorbed through the small bowel. You
need 2 to 3 days to be sure there is no
liver toxicity.

CASE 3: Aspirin Overdose

1459/1624

Setting: ED
CC: “I’m puking, my head hurts, and
my ears are ringing.”
VS: BP: 124/82 mm Hg; P: 114 beats/
minute; T: 101°F; R: 24 breaths/minute
HPI: A 54-year-old man come to the ED
because shortness of breath, headache,
and ringing in his ears. He is your
former roommate in medical school,
who took a bottle of aspirin in the bathroom at the twenty-fifth reunion. He
usually takes an aspirin a few times a
day for his joint pain. He comes to the
ED the day after the overdose.
PMHX:
Rheumatoid arthritis
Depression
Recovering alcoholic—10 years sober
Medications:

1460/1624

Aspirin
Etanercept
Methotrexate
PE:
General: uncomfortable, sitting up on
edge of bed holding his head
Cardiovascular: no murmur, no
gallops
Abdomen: soft, nontender
Neurological: confused

Which of the following is the most
urgent test?
a. Salicylate level
b. Acetaminophen level
c. Arterial blood gas (ABG)
d. Liver function tests
e. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine

1461/1624

Answer c. Arterial blood gas (ABG)
All of these tests are important. Your job is to
understand which is the most important.
Metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis
are the most likely causes of death, as well as
seizure and pulmonary edema.
Respiratory alkalosis happens first!

Initial Orders:
Salicylate level
Acetaminophen level
ABG
LFTs
Basic metabolic panel (CHEM-7)
Charcoal

1462/1624

Charcoal can remove absorbed poisons
and lower blood level.

Respiratory Alkalosis
First: direct stimulation to the brainstem

Salicylates stimulate brainstem respiratory centers.

Move the clock forward only 10 to 20
minutes to see what the results of the
tests are.
Reports:

1463/1624

Salicylate level: 70 μg/mL (markedly
elevated)
Acetaminophen level: none detected
ABG: pH 7.42; partial pressure of
carbon dioxide (PCO2) 22 mm Hg;
partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) 68
mm Hg
Serum bicarbonate 18 mEq/L
(decreased)
LFTs: normal
BUN 22 g/dL (elevated); creatinine
1.9 mg/dL (elevated)
Anion gap 20 mmol/L (normal 6–12
mmol/L)

Always get salicylate and acetaminophen
levels on all pill overdoses because of
high rates of co-ingestion.

1464/1624

Salicylates directly stimulate the
medulla, causing hyperventilation.

The mechanism of tinnitus is unknown.

What is the mechanism of the
metabolic acidosis?
a. Renal insufficiency
b. Lactic acidosis
c. Oxalic acid accumulation
d. Unknown
e. Ketoacids (beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid)
Answer b. Lactic acidosis

1465/1624

Salicylate intoxication produces metabolic
acidosis with increased anion gap. The
source of the lactic acidosis is the loss of oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation or the Krebs cycle is the aerobic
method whereby large amounts of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) are produced from each
molecule of glucose. Salicylate intoxication
poisons this activity in the mitochondria.
Poisoned mitochondria cannot make ATP
from glucose and the body is dependent on
glycolysis. The end product of glycolysis is
lactic acidosis.

Nausea and Vomiting
• Stimulation of chemoreceptor trigger
zone
• Located in the medulla: no
blood–brain barrier

1466/1624

Now that salicylate poisoning is
clearly diagnosed, you should try to
lower the level as quickly as possible.
Also, because death can be from pulmonary edema, you should look at the
chest.
Orders:
Bicarbonate IV
Dextrose 5% in water (D5W) (or any
IV fluid with glucose)
Urinalysis (UA): check urine pH
Chest x-ray

Why is bicarbonate use
beneficial?
a. It corrects acidosis on ABG.
b. It increases urinary excretion.
c. It reverses cardiac effect.

1467/1624

d. It reverses CNS effect.
e. It restores oxidative phosphorylation in
the mitochondria.
Answer b. It increases urinary excretion.
Bicarbonate prevents reabsorption of salicylates after they have been filtered at the glomerulus. Bicarbonate use in aspirin overdose
is entirely about lowering the blood level as
quickly as possible by increasing urinary excretion. It has nothing to do with protecting
the heart. That is how it works with TCA
overdose.

1. Salicylates filter at the glomerulus.
2. Bicarbonate charges salicylates in the
tubule.
3. Charged molecules cannot be
reabsorbed.

1468/1624

IV bicarbonate is started. The patient
is transferred to the ICU.
If a test and a treatment are
ordered at the same time on CCS, the
test will not reflect the treatment. UA
and IV bicarbonate ordered at the same
time will not reflect the IV bicarbonate.
To see that effect, you would have to
move the clock forward and recheck the
UA.
Reports:
UA: no cells, pH 5.4 (before
bicarbonate)
Chest x-ray: pulmonary edema and
acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS)

1469/1624

Weak acids lose hydrogen ions (H+) and
get charged in the basic environment.
Charged molecules do not pass biological membranes easily.

Salicylates cause fever by their effect on
the brain.

Mechanism of Confusion
• Direct CNS toxicity of salicylates
• Decreases CNS glucose from salicylates
• Cerebral edema

1470/1624

Why is there lung damage in
salicylate poisoning?
a. It is from vasoconstriction.
b. It is from renal failure.
c. Salicylates cause capillary leak directly.
d. It is from hyperventilation from metabolic
acidosis.
Answer c. Salicylates cause capillary leak
directly.
Salicylate poisoning causes direct toxicity to
the lungs resulting in ARDS. No one knows
precisely why people have ARDS. The noncardiogenic pulmonary edema does not occur as an effect of respiratory compensation
for metabolic acidosis. If the hyperventilation were compensation for metabolic
acidosis, the chest x-ray would be normal.

1471/1624

Always give glucose-containing IV fluids
for aspirin overdose.

No one knows why CNS glucose level is
low in aspirin overdose.
Serum glucose is normal, but CNS glucose is low.

The patient’s mental status starts to
improve with the start of IV glucosecontaining fluids. Dyspnea improves
as well. Repeat the salicylate level
measurement every 2 hours and do an
Interval History to check mental
status.

1472/1624

Salicylate Metabolic Acidosis =
Lactate
Orders:
UA
Salicylate level
ABG

ATP Molecules per Molecule of Glucose
• Aerobic: 30 to 36
• Glycolysis: 2

Salicylate Poisoning = Glycolysis Only
= Lactate Overproduction

Reports:

1473/1624

UA: pH 7.8
Salicylate level: 60 μg/mL
ABG: pH 7.46; PCO2 28 mm Hg; PO2
78 mm Hg
Keep the patient in the ICU until several salicylate level measurements show
that the level is decreasing. Also, bicarbonate drip is something best done
in the ICU. An ICU stay of 1 to 2 days
should be sufficient.

Transfer the patient out of ICU when:
• Pulmonary edema and CNS effects
resolve
• Salicylate level drops
• Bicarbonate drip not needed

1474/1624

Move the case forward 12 hours and
do an Interval History.
Interval History: “Confusion, tinnitus, and shortness of breath have resolved and the patient feels much
better.”

Indications for Dialysis with Salicylates
• Seizures and coma
• Pulmonary edema
• Severe confusion

Salicylic acid becomes charged by basic
urine.
Charged molecules cannot reenter the
tubule to go back into the blood.

1475/1624

The patient is transferred to the hospital floor. Stop the bicarbonate drip as
the patient is moved out of the ICU.

CASE 4: Carbon Monoxide
Setting: ED
CC: Patient brought in unresponsive
from a fire
VS: BP: 118/82 mm Hg; P:114 beats/
minute T: 98°F; R: 32 breaths/minute
HPI: A 78-year-old man is brought to
the ED after having been found on the
floor of his home during a fire. The patient is barely conscious and not able to
offer a clear history. He arrives in the
ED within half an hour of being found.
Another part of the house was on fire.

1476/1624

The neighbors called the police and fire
department and they broke down the
door. The patient did not sustain burns
himself, but several others from the next
room sustained significant burn injury.

What is the most common cause
of death in fires?
a. Volume depletion and hypovolemic shock
b. Sepsis
c. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning
d. Renal failure
e. Hyperkalemia and arrhythmia
f. Respiratory burn
Answer c.
poisoning

Carbon

monoxide

(CO)

1477/1624

Sixty percent of deaths on the first day in a
fire are from smoke inhalation and CO poisoning. All of the answer choices can cause
death in fires. CO poisoning is just the most
common one. Sepsis or infection from a skin
source is the most common cause of late
death several days or weeks after a fire.
When respiratory burn occurs, it is extremely lethal, but it is just not as common a
cause of death as the others.
Smoke kills at a distance: Burn needs
contact.

Smoke spreads easier than fire.

PMHx: (from medical alert
bracelet)

1478/1624

Hypertension
Aortic stenosis
Medications: unknown
Fires = Smoke Inhalation = CO
Poisoning
Fires and smoke inhalation are reasons to write orders before doing the
physical examination. There is a cookbook of standard orders to do before
anything. No matter what you see on
the physical, in a fire you need to administer oxygen and to measure oxygenation; 100% oxygen is what is
needed, but there is no way on CCS to
order dosing, including the dosing of
oxygen.
Orders:
Oxygen

1479/1624

ABG
Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level
CHEM-7
PE:
General: lethargic man lying on
stretcher
Chest: clear bilaterally
Cardiovascular: 3/6 murmur radiating to carotid arteries
Neurological: disoriented, lethargic,
unable to assess focal findings because of disorientation

How do you die from CO
poisoning?
a. Stroke
b. Myocardial infarction
c. Lung infarction

1480/1624

d. Renal failure
e. High output failure
Answer b. Myocardial infarction
Although disorientation and possible coma
are apparent from severe smoke inhalation
and CO poisoning, the organ that receives
fatal damage is the heart. The heart cannot
physiologically distinguish between hypoxia,
coronary artery stenosis, anemia, and CO
poisoning.
For Myocardium: CO = Anemia = Stenosis = Hypoxia

On CCS, if you forget to write an order, such as the ECG in a person with
CO poisoning, just add it on as soon as
you remember. If you have not moved

1481/1624

the clock forward, there will be no
points lost.
Orders:
ECG
Repeating the ABG would reflect oxygen use in this patient because doing
the physical examination moved the
clock forward.

Half-Life of COHb Breathing:
• Room air: 4 to 6 hours
• One hundred percent oxygen: 60 to 90
minutes
• Hyperbaric oxygen: 20 to 30 minutes

1482/1624

Standard pulse oximetry cannot detect
CO.

Reports:
ABG: pH 7.32; PCO2 28 mm Hg; PO2
90 mm Hg; 98% saturation
COHb level: 42%
CHEM-7: normal
ECG: ST depression in V2 to V4

What is the mechanism of
metabolic acidosis?
a. Decreased perfusion of tissues
b. Lactate from tissue hypoxia
c. Rhabdomyolysis

1483/1624

d. Sepsis
Answer b. Lactate from tissue hypoxia
COHb does not release oxygen to tissues.
The tissues become hypoxic. Hypoxic tissues
produce lactate. See the previous discussion
about lactate buildup from anaerobic glycolysis. The tissues are perfused, but oxygen is
not delivered. Without oxygen delivery, the
metabolic acidosis that develops would look
identical to decreased tissue perfusion or
sepsis.

Normal respiratory rate is 8 to 14
breaths/minute.
This patient, at 32 breaths/minute,
should have pH >7.4.

1484/1624

Hyperventilation should produce
alkalosis.

COHb Elevation + pH <7.4 = Massive
Tissue Acidosis

What is the mechanism of cardiac
ischemia?
a. Decreased coronary perfusion
b. Increased CO release to tissues
c. Decreased oxygen release from hemoglobin at tissues
d. Decreased oxygen pickup by hemoglobin
at lungs
Answer c. Decreased oxygen release from
hemoglobin at tissues

1485/1624

CO does not interfere with hemoglobin picking up oxygen at the lungs. CO interferes
with the release of oxygen at tissues. That is
why the blood is red. Methemoglobinemia
interferes with oxygen pickup at lungs.

Move the clock forward 5 to 10
minutes and reevaluate the patient.
You will not lose points if you repeat
the ABG on oxygen or repeat the ECG.
After starting 100% oxygen, your
main issues in management are:
1. Does the patient need hyperbaric
oxygen?
2. Has respiratory burn occurred and is
intubation needed?

1486/1624

Which of the following is the
strongest indication to use
hyperbaric oxygen in this patient?
a. pH 7.32
b. ST depression on the ECG
c. Confusion
d. COHb level 42%
Answer b. ST depression on the ECG
All of these indicate serious CO poisoning,
but the worst one is the myocardial ischemia.
Severe metabolic acidosis with pH <7.2 is
an indication, as well as coma. The high
COHb level (>25%) is certainly dangerous,
but the most dangerous is the ischemia.

Oxygen on hemoglobin (Hb) with COHb
will not release to tissues.

1487/1624

COHb = Effects of Anemia
COHb 42% = Effects of Loss of 42% of blood

Transfer the patient to the ICU and order hyperbaric oxygen. Continue
100% oxygen in the meantime.
Orders:
Hyperbaric oxygen
Troponin level

What is the most common
presentation of aortic stenosis,
which this patient has?
a. Angina
b. Syncope
c. Congestive heart failure (CHF)

1488/1624

Answer a. Angina
Fifty to seventy percent of patients with aortic stenosis have coronary disease. That is
what makes this patient’s COHb level so dangerous. If this patient bled and lost a third of
his blood volume, he would have myocardial
ischemia as well. COHb is the same in its effect on tissues.

Your patient is lucky enough to be in a
hospital with a hyperbaric chamber.
Move the clock forward 1 hour and
recheck the laboratory test results.
Orders:
ECG
COHb
ABG
Remember that a COHb level and hyperbaric oxygen ordered at the same

1489/1624

time will not show the effects of the hyperbaric oxygen.
Move the clock forward a half hour
and do an Interval History. Hyperbaric
oxygen will reduce half of COHb within
a half hour.
Interval History: “The patient is
more alert and awake. He denies chest
pain.”

One hundred percent inspired oxygen
should give PO2 >700 mm Hg.

Reports:
ECG: ST segment has normalized.
COHb level is 18%.

1490/1624

The pH is 7.37 and PO2 680 mm Hg
on 100% oxygen in the hyperbaric
chamber.
The troponin level is elevated.
The patient’s symptoms improve, but
the myocardial ischemia should be
treated as it would be in a person who
had a myocardial infarction (MI) from
coronary disease unmasked by the CO
poisoning. He should undergo investigation to determine the need for revascularization when stable. The point of
the case is understanding that CO poisoning leads to tissue hypoxia from a
failure to release oxygen to tissues. This
leads to ischemia of every tissue. It is
just that the heart and brain are the
most vulnerable.

1491/1624

Methemoglobin
• Oxidized blood
• Brown
• Does not pick up oxygen in the lungs

COHb
• Hb picks up 200 times more than
oxygen
• Red
• Picks up oxygen in the lungs
• Does not release in tissues

CASE 5: Ethylene Glycol and

Delirium Etiology
• Sodium level up/down
• Glucose level down
• Calcium level up
• Osmolar changes
• Liver or renal failure
• Hypoxia

Altered mental status is one of those symptoms for which treatment is started before
getting tests.

The worst form of confusion is a seizure.

On CCS, do not get a neurology consultation
until after these simple tests have been done.
You are not supposed to need a neurology

1495/1624

consultation to know to check the levels of
calcium, glucose, oxygen, sodium, and to test
for liver or renal failure.

Move the clock forward only far
enough to get the test results. You will
not know what type of hospital admission you need for this patient until you
know the severity of his illness.
Reports:
CHEM-7:
Sodium 140 mEq/L
Glucose 90 mg/dL
Chloride 100 mEq/L
BUN 9 g/dL
Bicarbonate: 16 mEq/L (normal
22–26 mEq/L)
UA: No white blood cells (WBCs),
“envelope-shaped” crystals present

1496/1624

CBC: WBCs 14,200/μL; 78%
neutrophils
Urine toxicology screen: no cocaine,
opiate, marijuana, benzodiazepines
Serum osmolarity 360 mOsm/kg

Serum Osmolarity = 2 × Sodium + Glucose/18 + BUN/2.8

Which laboratory test result tells
you that there must have been a
toxic ingestion?
a. WBC count elevation
b. Osmolar gap
c. Metabolic acidosis
d. Decreased anion gap

1497/1624

Answer b. Osmolar gap
The measured osmolarity is 360 mOsm/kg.
The calculated osmolarity is 287 mOsm/
kg.
The difference between the osmolarity
you measure and the osmolarity you calculate means that there must be an additional
toxic substance in the bloodstream. A mild
elevation in WBC could mean very little. Any
form of “stress” for the body can lead to a
mild elevation in WBC count. Fifty percent
of WBCs are in circulation and 50% are on
the “margins” or edges of the blood vessels.
It is easy to double the WBC count just from
“stress.” Also, this patient has an increased
anion gap of 24 mmol/L, not a decreased anion gap. The normal gap is 6 to 12 mmol/L.
Ethylene glycol leads to the increase in osmolar gap.

1498/1624

Envelope crystals are calcium oxalate.

Stress Leukocytosis
• Epinephrine
• Cortisol
Both pull WBCs off the endothelial
lining.

Which of these would not be a
cause of this metabolic acidosis?
a. Diarrhea
b. Sepsis
c. Hypotension
d. Methanol
e. Ethylene glycol

1499/1624

Answer a. Diarrhea
Diarrhea causes a GI tract loss of bicarbonate with an increased serum chloride. This is
why diarrhea and renal tubular acidosis
(RTA) have normal anion gaps. An increased
anion gap in metabolic acidosis results from
the insertion, or addition, of a new substance
into the body. This decreases the bicarbonate
and does not allow the chloride to rise.
Any form of hypoperfusion or hypotension increases lactate production. Methanol
increases formic acid and is the insertion of a
new anion.

Methanol Poisoning
• Increased anion gap
• Toxic to the eye and retina
• “Blind drunk”
• Fomepizole for drug therapy

1500/1624

• Dialysis to remove

Isopropyl alcohol: normal anion gap
acidosis

Alcohol dehydrogenase metabolizes
methanol to formic acid (Figure 11-2).
Formic acid burns the eye.

Metabolic Acidosis + Elevated Gap +
Envelope Crystals = Ethylene Glycol

All patients who have metabolic
acidosis need an ABG assay to determine the severity of decrease in pH. You
should wait for the ABG results and
ethylene glycol level to start
treatment.
Orders:
ABG
Ethylene glycol level
Calcium levels

1503/1624

Repeat CHEM-7

Why is ethylene glycol toxic to
renal function?
a. Hydrogen ions damage the glomerulus.
b. Ethylene glycol causes sloughing of the
proximal tubule cells.
c. Oxalic acid and glycolic acid have direct
cytotoxic effects.
d. Ethylene glycol lowers calcium levels.
e. The mechanism is unknown.
Answer c. Oxalic acid and glycolic acid
have direct cytotoxic effects.
The entire point of the basic science correlate
of this case is knowing that it is the metabolite of ethylene glycol and methanol that
causes their toxic effects. Ethylene glycol is
not directly toxic to the kidney. Ethylene

1504/1624

glycol is metabolized to glycolic acid and oxalic acid. It is the metabolites that are dangerous to the kidney tubules by their direct
cytotoxic effects.

Gastric lavage is never the correct treatment for toxic alcohols.

The patient remains intoxicated and
difficult to interview.
Reports:
ABG: pH 7.34; PCO2 24 mm Hg; PO2
90 mm Hg
Ethylene glycol level: elevated
Calcium levels: 6.5 mg/dL
(decreased)

1505/1624

Repeat chemistry: serum bicarbonate 18 mEq/L; creatinine 1.7 mg/dL

Renal toxicity takes 1 to 2 days after the
ingestion of ethylene glycol.

Calcium complexes with oxalic acid
• Lowers blood calcium levels
• Precipitates in the kidneys

Orders:
Fomepizole
Bicarbonate drip if pH < 7.2
Transfer to ICU

1506/1624

Fomepizole
• Blocks alcohol dehydrogenase
• Prevents production of oxalic acid
from ethylene glycol
• Prevents formic acid production from
methanol

The patient is moved to the ICU if there
is severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.2)
or an overdose bad enough to need:
Bicarbonate drip
Fomepizole
Dialysis

• Fomepizole inhibits alcohol
dehydrogenase.

1507/1624

• Alcohol dehydrogenase makes toxic
metabolites.
• Only dialysis removes toxic alcohol
from the blood.

CASE 6: Organophosphates
Setting: ED
CC: “I got splashed with insecticide;
now I can’t breathe.”
VS: BP: 92/72 mm Hg; P: 56 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R: 36 breaths/minute
HPI: A 57-year-old farmer comes to the
ED after a bag of insecticide was accidentally splashed on his face while
working on his farm. He had diarrhea,
vomiting, and difficulty breathing. He is

1508/1624

spitting continuously since the exposure
occurred. He asks for a urinal twice
while giving the history. There is no
burning with urination. He denies fever
or cough.
PMHx/Medications: none

What is the most common cause
of death from insecticide
poisoning?
a. Aspiration pneumonia
b. Diarrhea
c. Heart block
d. Respiratory failure
e. Infection
Answer d. Respiratory failure

1509/1624

Insecticides
contain
organophosphates,
which markedly increase ACh levels. Massive
increases in ACh levels cause death from respiratory distress, bronchospasm, and diaphragmatic paralysis. Although there is
diarrhea, heart block, urinary frequency, and
excess salivation, these do not cause death.

ACh increases salivary volume.
Normally, 1 to 2 L/day of saliva are
made.

What is the most important thing
to do first?
a. Remove the clothes.
b. Wash the patient.
c. Give atropine.

1510/1624

d. Intubate and begin mechanical
ventilation.
e. Give pralidoxime.
Answer c. Give atropine.
All of these efforts, except intubating the patient, should be done. Decontamination with
removing the clothes and washing the patient is important, but not as important as
stopping the effects of the extra ACh already
inside the body. No matter how much you
wash the skin, it will not stop the effects of
the organophosphate already inside it.
The emergency medicine section of CCS
has the largest number of cases where treatment before the physical examination is
done. Correct timing or the right order of
testing and treatment is the essence of CCS.

1511/1624

Saliva
• Muscarinic receptors stimulate
secretion.
• Secretions are serous.
• ACh increases the bicarbonate content
of saliva.

Orders:
Atropine IV
Oxygen
Decontamination of patient’s skin
(Wash the patient’s skin.)
PE:
General: uncomfortable man on
stretcher in an isolation room
Chest: bilateral wheezing
HEENT: constricted pupils

1512/1624

Cardiovascular: slow heart rate, no
murmurs
Abdomen: hyperactive bowel sounds

ACh constricts the pupils.

What is the mechanism of the
patient’s current respiratory
distress?
a. ACh constricts bronchial smooth muscle.
b. The central (medullary) drive is
decreased.
c. The pulmonary vasculature is constricted.
d. The pulmonary vasculature is dilated.
e. The peripheral chemoreceptors are
blocked.

1513/1624

Answer a. ACh constricts bronchial smooth
muscle.
ACh is increased from insecticide exposure
by blocking its metabolism. ACh in the lung
has a direct effect on:
• Constricting bronchial smooth muscle
• Increasing bronchial gland secretions
ACh has no effect at all on the medullary respiratory centers or smooth muscle in the vasculature. Although the autonomic nervous
system is usually paired in opposite directions, with ACh increasing GI tract motility
and norepinephrine (NE) decreasing it, or
ACh decreasing heart rate and NE increasing
it, this is not true of vascular smooth muscle.
NE will constrict smooth muscle by alpha-1
stimulation. ACh has no effect on vascular
smooth muscle to either constrict it or dilate
it.

1514/1624

Central Chemoreceptors
• Increasing carbon dioxide
• Acid

ACh slows heart rate
• Decreased sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) node automaticity

ACh
• Flattens the slope of phase 4
depolarization
• Increases the time to achieve threshold
for depolarization
• Slows conductance through Funny sodium channels

1515/1624

Ordering a physical examination
moves the clock forward. Atropine is
considered to be done instantly on
CCS, so if there is an effect of atropine,
you will see it right away.
Interval History: “Breathing improved somewhat. Feeling better.”
Orders:
Repeat IV atropine
Pralidoxime
CHEM-7, CBC
ECG
Chest x-ray

ACh
• Constricts intestinal smooth muscle
• Leads to diarrhea

1516/1624

• Constricts stomach smooth muscle
• Leads to vomiting

Which is the mechanism of excess
ACh with insecticides?
a. Increased release from neuron
b. Prevention of splitting into acetic acid and
choline
c. Blockade of neuromuscular junction
d. Increased calcium flow into presynaptic
neuron
Answer b. Prevention of splitting into acetic acid and choline
Acetylcholinesterase ends the effect of ACh
at the neural junction. This happens by splitting ACh into acetic acid and choline. This

1517/1624

effect is most apparent at muscarinic receptors, which are:
• Salivary and lacrimal glands
• GI tract smooth muscle: distal esophagus,
stomach, and, intestine
• Urinary bladder smooth muscle (detrusor
muscle)

Pralidoxime reactivates
acetylcholinesterase.

Move the clock forward at increments
of 15 minutes at first. You should expect to re-dose atropine numerous
times. The half-life of atropine is short
and the half-life of organophosphate
insecticides is long. You should see all

1518/1624

the effects resolve within minutes if
you have given enough.
You do not have to do anything to
get reports of tests ordered on CCS except to move past the time that it says
“report available.” The report will pop
up automatically as you pass the time.
You can cancel a test at any time before
it becomes available by double clicking
on it.
Reports:
CHEM-7, CBC: normal
ECG: sinus bradycardia (timed before repeat dose of atropine)
Chest x-ray: normal

1519/1624

After repeated doses of atropine,
there is no effect on muscular
strength. What accounts for this?
a. Atropine does not penetrate muscles.
b. The neuromuscular junction is nicotinic.
c. Muscles are stimulated by calcium in the
junction, not atropine.
d. The mechanism is unknown.
Answer b. The neuromuscular junction is
nicotinic.
Atropine only effects muscarinic receptors
such as are found in saliva, GI, bowel, and
bladder tissue.
Move the clock forward at 30- to
60-minute intervals for the first 12
hours because of the short half-life of
atropine. The management of nerve

1520/1624

gas such as sarin gas is identical to the
management of insecticides.

Nerve gas attack presents the same way:
• Salivation
• Lacrimation
• Urination
• Defecation
• Respiratory distress

CASE 7: Spider Bite
Setting: ED
CC: “There was a spider in my shoe,
and I stepped on it.”
VS: normal

1521/1624

HPI: A 62-year-old man was getting up
in the morning in his beach house on the
Jersey shore when he put his foot into a
shoe and experienced a sudden sharp
pain. He originally thought that he
stepped on a nail or piece of glass. He
found a dead spider in the shoe. Over
the next few hours, he developed waves
of abdominal pain so severe he came to
the ED.
PMHx/Medications: none
PE:
General: very uncomfortable; clearly
in pain
Chest: clear
Abdomen: rigid, not tender; no
rebound.
Cardiovascular: normal
Initial Orders:
Antivenin

1522/1624

CHEM-7
Calcium level
Upright chest x-ray
Abdominal x-ray

Brown Recluse Spider Bite
• Local necrosis of skin
• No specific test
• Wound debridement
• Dapsone or steroids (sometimes help)

Black Widow Spider Bite
• Red hourglass on belly of spider
• Calcium chelation
• Abdominal pain

1523/1624

As you move the clock forward, consult poison control or toxicology on
spider, snake, and insect bites.
If you remember a test or treatment you forgot to order before you
move the clock forward, just order it
and you will lose no points at all. The
“penalty” on your score for forgetting to
order a test or treatment is based on
how long you move the clock forward
before ordering it.
Reports:
CHEM-7: normal
Calcium level: 6.4 mg/dL (low)
Upright chest x-ray: normal; no air
under diaphragm
Abdominal x-ray: normal; no ileus,
no air or fluid levels

1524/1624

Perforation of GI Organs and Intestines
• Free air is detected on chest x-ray.
• Chest x-rays always show the top of the
diaphragm.

Abdominal X-ray
• Only for ileus or small bowel
obstruction

Orders:
IV calcium
Antivenom if not already ordered
Transfer patient to ICU

1525/1624

Use ICU observation in black widow
spider bites (Figure 11-3). Observe for:
• Seizures
• Prolonged QT on ECG
• Worsening tetany
• Laryngospasm

1526/1624

Low Calcium Level = Abnormal Excess
Muscle and Neural Depolarization

Move the clock forward, do an Interval History, and reexamine the
abdomen.
Interval History: “Patient still in
severe abdominal pain.”
Abdomen: rigid, tight, not tender;
no change

Black widow spider venom chelates
calcium.

Low calcium level causes tetany.

1527/1624

Low serum calcium level decreases the
threshold for depolarization.

After giving the calcium, the abdominal
pain starts to improve. Antivenin has
been administered. When the calcium
level normalizes and abdominal pain
has resolved, the patient can be transferred back to the hospital floor.

CASE 8: Digoxin Toxicity
Setting: ED
CC: “I feel nauseated and I vomited
twice.”
VS: BP: 104/68 mm Hg; P: 50 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R: 24 breaths/minute

1528/1624

HPI: An 84-year-old man comes to the
ED with 1 to 2 days of increasing nausea and vomiting as well as diarrhea and
some abdominal pain. The patient has
been having visual disturbance and palpitations. His family says he has grown
somewhat confused over the last several
days.
PMHX:
Atrial fibrillation
Hypertension
Medications:
Chlorthalidone
Digoxin
Nifedipine
PE:
General: old man mumbling on a bed
Chest: clear to auscultation bilaterally

1529/1624

Cardiovascular: slow, irregularly irregular rate
Neurological: disoriented to time, examination incomplete secondary to
lethargy
Initial Orders:
CHEM-7
ECG
Abdominal x-ray
Oximeter

Altered Mental Status
• Sodium level
• Glucose level
• Hypoxia
• Calcium level
• Liver or renal failure
• Intoxications

1530/1624

Potassium Disorders
• Cause arrhythmias
• Do not cause neurological problems

Move the clock forward to get the
laboratory test results. Elderly patients can become disoriented with disorders that would be very minor for a
younger person, such as cystitis or
sleep disturbance. In an older person,
just staying awake too much at night
is enough to disorient them. You cannot diagnose “sundowning” like that
until you have excluded the other “organic” problems listed in the box.
Report:
Oximeter: 97% saturation

1531/1624

What is the point of getting the
abdominal film?
a. Perforation
b. Ileus or small bowel obstruction
c. Gallstones
d. Nephrolithiasis
Answer b. Ileus or small bowel obstruction
Abdominal x-ray or computed tomography
(CT) is the only way to detect an ileus. Any
electrolyte abnormality, such as abnormal
levels of potassium, calcium, or magnesium,
can paralyze the bowel. The intestines are a
long muscular tube. These electrolytes make
this muscle nonoperative.

Report:

1532/1624

CHEM-7: potassium 5.8 mEq/L (normal 3.5–5.2 mEq/L); BUN 38 g/dL
(elevated); creatinine 2.0 mg/dL
ECG: atrial fibrillation, curved
downsloping of ST segments, premature ventricular contractions; heart
rate 50 beats/minute
Abdominal x-ray: multiple air fluid
levels diffusely

What is the downsloping ST
segment from?
a. Potassium
b. Digoxin
c. Dehydration
d. Renal insufficiency
Answer b. Digoxin

1533/1624

Digoxin can give downsloping of ST segments even at normal levels (Figure 11-4).
This is not considered a sign of toxicity. Dehydration is present based on a BUN-to-creatinine ratio of 20:1. This is not surprising in
an elderly person using a diuretic to control
blood pressure (BP), although it is more
common with a loop diuretic.

1534/1624

Figure 11-4. Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrating
findings seen with therapeutic digoxin concentrations. A.
ECG shows scooping of ST segments and small U waves
with a serum digoxin level of 0.9 ng/mL. B. ECG shows
scooping of ST segments, flattening of T waves, and first-

1535/1624

degree atrioventricular block with a serum digoxin level of
1.2 ng/mL. (Reproduced with permission from Tintinalli JE,
et al. Tintinalli’s Emergency Medicine, A Comprehensive
Study Guide, 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

Dehydration is a good reason for the
patient’s disorientation. Potassium
disorders do not cause cognitive dysfunction. Both dehydration and potassium elevation can cause an ileus.
There is no specific therapy to reverse
a small bowel obstruction. You have to
correct the underlying cause, such as
electrolyte problems, and wait for it to
start moving again.
Orders:
IV normal saline
Stop digoxin and stop diuretics if not
already done
Digoxin level

1536/1624

What is the most common toxicity
associated with digoxin?
a. Cardiac
b. Neurological
c. Vision changes
d. GI tract
e. Electrolyte
Answer d. GI tract
Digoxin toxicity is rare because CHF is managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and spironolactone first. When it occurs, the most common symptoms are nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal pain. These are nonspecific. The
GI tract manifestations of digoxin toxicity
have nothing unique to them. The most dangerous complication is cardiac arrhythmia.
Virtually any rhythm disorder can occur.

1537/1624

Yellow “halos” around objects are seen. This
is part of neurological toxicity.
Altered mental status can be from digoxin toxicity.

Digoxin toxicity causes confusion

HypOkalemia (low potassium [K]) =
Digoxin Toxicity
Digoxin toxicity leads to hypERkalemia.

Hyperkalemia Etiology
• Digoxin inhibits sodium- and
potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (NaK ATPase)

1538/1624

What is the most common
arrhythmia from digoxin toxicity?
a. Atrial fibrillation
b. Premature ventricular contractions
c. Ventricular tachycardia
d. Bradycardia
Answer
b.
contractions

Premature

ventricular

Any arrhythmia is possible with digoxin toxicity. Premature ventricular contractions
(PVCs)
are
the
most
common.
Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with
variable block is extremely common. This
patient’s bradycardia is definitely a manifestation of digoxin toxicity as is the abdominal
distress, yellow halos around objects, and
confusion.

1539/1624

Advance the clock and repeat the
neurological examination.
PE:
Neurological: lethargic and confused

Vomiting causes hypokalemia.
Hypokalemia causes digoxin toxicity.

Digoxin and potassium compete for the
same binding site on NaK ATPase.

Digoxin increases contractility by:
• Stimulating the ryanodine receptors

1540/1624

• Releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum

Report:
Digoxin level: 3.2 ng/mL (elevated)
The patient has persistent neurological symptoms, an abnormal ECG, and
hyperkalemia. All of these are indications for giving digoxin-binding
antibodies.
Orders:
Digoxin-binding fragment antigen
binding (Fab) antibodies
CHEM-7
Telemetry cardiac monitoring
Transfer to ICU if not already done

1541/1624

Digoxin-Binding Antibodies
• Fab portion of immunoglobulin G
(IgG)
• Derived from sheep
• Excreted bound to digoxin renally

There should be an immediate effect of
the digoxin-binding Fab portions.
Bradycardia, confusion, and arrhythmias should quickly resolve.

Digoxin-Binding Fab
• It splits off the Fc portion.
• Papain splits into two pieces Fab and
Fc.

1542/1624

Strongest Indications for Digoxin-Binding Fab
• Arrhythmia
• Symptomatic bradycardia
• Lethargy and confusion
• Hyperkalemia

As you move the clock forward, repeat
the ECG, neurological examination,
and potassium level. When these have
normalized, move the patient out of the
ICU. Because the indication for digoxin
in this case is just rapid atrial fibrillation, switch digoxin to metoprolol or
diltiazem or both. Both beta-blockers
and diltiazem will control the heart
rate and the BP.

1543/1624

CASE 9: Drowning and
Hypothermia
Setting: ED
CC: “We found him in the water off side
of the boat.”
VS: BP: 92/60 mm Hg; P: 45 beats/
minute; T: 88°F; R: 32 breaths/minute
HPI: A 52-year-old man was at a party
on his boat when he was noticed missing. The boat was on the dock in only
about 12 feet of water. The patient has
been drinking alcohol for several hours
before what seemed to be slipping off
the side of the boat and falling into the
water. It is not clear how long he was in
the water before his friends called 911.
PMHx/Medications: none

1544/1624

What is the cause of death in
hypothermia?
a. Seizure
b. Arrhythmia
c. Rhabdomyolysis
Answer b. Arrhythmia
The cardiac conduction system is made extremely irritable by hypothermia. The ECG
will show bradycardia or “Osborn J waves,”
which look similar to ST-segment elevation.
Although hypothermia decreases cerebral
functioning, it does not cause seizures. Hypothermia causes coma. Cold can cause
muscle breakdown and rhabdomyolysis, but
this is not as common a cause of death as interfering with cardiac conduction.

1545/1624

Orders:
Oxygen
Oximeter
ABG
Chest x-ray
ECG
PE:
General: lethargic, intoxicated and
short of breath
Neurologic: incomplete examination
Chest: rhonchi bilaterally
Cardiovascular: no murmurs

Saltwater
• The osmolarity is 2700 mOsm/kg.

1546/1624

• It draws water into the lungs from the
vasculature.
• It washes away surfactant.

Freshwater
• High volume causes hemolysis.
• It creates hypotonic blood.
• It washes away surfactant.

Move the clock forward only 1 to 2
minutes to get the results of oximeter.
Hypothermia: Lethargy + Dyspnea =
Endotracheal Intubation

1547/1624

Hypothermia
• Decreases oxygen consumption
• Decreases CO2 production
• Protects heart and brain from hypoxia
• Slows heart rate (diving reflex)

Report:
Oximeter: 88% saturation
Orders:
Endotracheal intubation
Transfer to ICU
Warmed, humidified air
External rewarming: blankets, heating pads, warm IV fluids
CHEM-7, CBC
Urine toxicology screen, alcohol level

1548/1624

Most drowning and hypothermia deaths
• Are related to intoxication
• Happen in less than 12 feet of water

Report:
ABG: pH 7.32; PCO2 48 mm Hg; PO2
55 mm Hg
Chest x-ray: ARDS, atelectasis
ECG: Osborn J waves (Figure 11-5)
Remember that on CCS, the tests are
considered done instantly, so even
though the report is available after rewarming has started with warm IV
fluids, blankets, and heating pads, the
ECG does not reflect the use of these
treatments yet.

1549/1624

Figure 11-5. Electrocardiogram (ECG) strip from a patient
with a temperature of 25°C (77°F) showing atrial fibrillation

McGraw-Hill; 2011.)

Atelectasis
• It causes the loss of airway volume.
• It can be caused by loss of surfactant.
• The small airways collapse first.

Ineffective Therapies in Drowning

1550/1624

• Steroids
• Antibiotics

Move the clock forward 10 minutes to
see the effect of rewarming and mechanical ventilation. Both of these will
have an immediate effect.
PE:
VS: BP: 104/64 mm Hg; P: 58 beats/
minute; T: 94°F; R: 24 breaths/
minute
Neurological: The patient is much
more alert.
Chest: rales/rhonchi diffusely
bilaterally

1551/1624

Both saltwater and freshwater create
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Reports:
CHEM-7, CBC: BUN 24 g/dL (increased); hematocrit 50%
(increased)
Urine toxicology screen: negative
Alcohol level: 340 mg/mL (legally
“drunk” >100 mg/mL)

Saltwater aspiration draws free water into the lungs.
• Hemoconcentration raises hematocrit
concentration.

1552/1624

• BUN level is increased (pre-renal
azotemia).

• Decreased volume increases antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
• ADH stimulates urea transporters in
the kidney.
• More urea is absorbed.

As you move the clock forward, there is
no way to predict the amount of recoverability of the neurological status of
the patient. The benefit of rewarming
will become clear right away, but the
degree of recovery from the hypoxia of
drowning is impossible to predict.

1553/1624

Orders:
Vital signs
ECG
On CCS, the end notice—“This case will
end in 5 minutes of real time”—is the
same no matter how well or badly you
manage the patient. This can be very
disconcerting because you do not know
precisely how you did. The closest thing
you will get to feedback is the “Interval
History.”
Reports:
VS: BP: 112/74 mm Hg; P: 68 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R: 18 breaths/
minute
The patient is more alert.
ECG: normal sinus rhythm at 68
beats/minute; resolution of J waves

1554/1624

There is no maximum rate of
rewarming.

CASE 10: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
Setting: ICU
CC: Unexpectedly high carbon dioxide
level during surgery
VS: BP: 94/62 mm Hg; P: 120 beats/
minute; T: 98°F; R: 30 breaths/minute
HPI: A 34-year-old woman with a history of Crohn disease, who has just been
in the operating room for her third surgery to relieve obstruction, is now
brought to the ICU because of a rise in
PCO2 to 65 mm Hg that cannot be

1555/1624

explained. The patient had induction of
anesthesia with midazolam then an inhalational anesthetic by face mask. Despite increasing the respiratory rate on
the ventilator to 30 breaths per minute,
the increased PCO2 persists.
PMHX:
Crohn disease
Surgery to relieve obstruction from
stricture in past
Nephrolithiasis
Medications:
Mesalamine (Pentasa)
Infliximab intermittently
PE:
General: muscle rigidity
Chest: clear to auscultation; normal
lung examination
Cardiovascular: normal

1556/1624

HEENT: normal
Initial Orders:
ABG
Chest x-ray
CHEM-20
Creatine kinase (CK)
CCS sometimes gives unexpected
“Nurses Notes” that have updates on the
patient’s condition. The updates can be
either positive or negative in terms of
improvement or worsening of the patient’s condition.
While moving the clock forward on
CCS to get the results of ABG, you get a
“Nurses Note,” which says, “The patient’s
muscles have become more rigid.” You
think that the increased carbon dioxide is
from muscular rigidity and decide to
give a neuromuscular blocking agent to

1557/1624

relax the muscles and decrease carbon
dioxide production.
Order:
Succinylcholine administration IV
On CCS, medications are considered administered instantly, but you cannot see
the effects of them until you move the
clock forward.

What is the mechanism of
succinylcholine?
a. It inhibits the release of ACh.
b. It blocks nicotinic receptor depolarization.
c. It prevents repolarization of the nicotinic
receptors.
d. It cleaves ACh prematurely.

1558/1624

e. It prevents the release of calcium from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum.
Answer c. It prevents repolarization of the
nicotinic receptors.
Succinylcholine causes persistent depolarization of the nicotinic receptors, which results
in neuromuscular blockade. It works exclusively at nicotinic receptors. Succinylcholine
is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase, so
its effect cannot be ended. Flaccidity of the
muscles occurs because intramuscular calcium is taken up by the calcium ATPase of the
muscle into the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic
reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase
(SERCA). When all the calcium is removed
from the cytoplasm, muscle contraction
ends.

1559/1624

Succinylcholine prevents repolarization
of the neuromuscular junction.

No Repolarization = Block of Next
Depolarization

You move the clock forward 5 minutes
to see the effects of the neuromuscular
blocking agent.
PE:
Markedly increased muscle rigidity;
masseter rigidity is severe.
Reports:
ABG: pH 7.24; PCO2 64 mm Hg; PO2
74 mm Hg

1560/1624

Chest x-ray: normal
CHEM-20: potassium 5.4 mEq/L
(elevated)
CK: 7400 units/L (normal 40–175
units/L)
Anesthesia + Unexpected Rise in
PCO2 = Malignant Hyperthermia

Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)
• Genetic predisposition
• Third or fourth exposure
• Inhalational anesthetics plus
succinylcholine

1561/1624

Move the clock forward to recheck the
laboratory test results and confirm
MH.
Repeat Laboratory Tests:
ABG: pH 7.22; PCO2 68 mm Hg; PO2
74 mm Hg
Potassium 6.0 mEq/L (elevated)
CK: 16,300 units/L (normal 40–175
units/L)

Succinylcholine makes MH worse.

Depolarizing blockade massively increases CO2 production by the muscles.

1562/1624

The patient’s muscular rigidity
persists.
VS: P: 112 beats/minute; T: 104°F

Increased PCO2 precedes temperature
elevation in MH.

Which of the following is most
effective for MH?
a. Dantrolene
b. Cooling blanket
c. Iced IV fluids
d. Bromocriptine
e. Spraying with water and evaporation

1563/1624

Answer a. Dantrolene
Dantrolene reorders the heat-generating
mechanisms of skeletal muscle in both MH
and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).
NMS is specifically treated with bromocriptine because we think NMS has to do
with the antidopaminergic qualities of
neuroleptics.
Cooling blankets and especially the
power of heat removal through evaporation
are what is used in heat stroke. Heat stroke
is entirely a problem of exertion of the body
with high outside temperatures. MH and
NMS have nothing to do with the outside
temperature. They have to do with an idiosyncratic reaction of the body to either inhalational anesthetics and succinylcholine
(MH) or neuroleptics. Iced IV fluids are always wrong. Iced IV fluids can stop the
heart.

1564/1624

Orders:
Dantrolene
Stop anesthetics and stop succinylcholine if not already done
IV normal saline
UA
Urine myoglobin

Massive CO2 overproduction is always
first in MH!
It cannot be compensated by
hyperventilation.

After administering dantrolene and
stopping exposure to anesthetics, the

1565/1624

treatment of MH is similar to management of rhabdomyolysis with fluids
and monitoring potassium, CK, calcium, and phosphate levels.

Rhabdomyolysis
• Potassium (K) level increased
• Phosphate level increased from
muscles
• Calcium level down

Damaged muscles bind calcium.

Masseter Muscle Rigidity =
Succinylcholine-Induced Malignant
Hyperthermia

1566/1624

Report:
UA: dipstick positive blood, no red
blood cells seen
Urine myoglobin: elevated
CK and urine myoglobin levels peak at
about 24 hours after the use of inhalational anesthetics and neuromuscular
blockers.

MH Mechanism
• Abnormal calcium release from SERCA
• Abnormal muscle contraction and
rigidity

Dantrolene Mechanism

1567/1624

• Binds ryanodine receptors
• Inhibits calcium release from SERCA

Expect dark urine in MH.

If your case describes severe hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis, move
the clock forward 30 to 60 minutes
after administering insulin and glucose and recheck the potassium level. If
your case describes only rhabdomyolysis with a normal potassium level,
move the clock forward 4 to 6 hours
and recheck the CK and potassium.
Vital signs in an ICU are measured
every 2 hours.

1568/1624

MH kills by
• Hyperkalemia
• Seizures from high temperature

VS: at 2-hour intervals
T: 104°F, 103°F, 102.8°F, 103.4°F
You should not expect CK and temperature to peak for 24 hours. Both will
come down after that.
Orders:
Dantrolene—continue for 48 hours
IV saline
Repeat potassium, calcium, and CK
levels at 6- to 12-hour intervals in
ICU
Repeat ABG

1569/1624

On CCS, you can get notes saying, “Are
you sure you want to continue?” on
any case. It does not mean you did
anything wrong or made a mistake. It
is simply giving you an opportunity to
cancel orders or make changes.
The patient should stay in the ICU
until mental status and temperature
have normalized. If the hydration and
correction of ventilatory support and potassium and calcium levels are well
monitored, the patient will leave the ICU
in 48 hours.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical history: introduction
In nephrology, as in all branches of medicine, a competent clinical assessment is crucial. This should incorporate symptoms and signs:
• Arising locally from the kidneys and urinary tract.
• Resulting from impaired salt and water handling.
• Caused by failing renal excretory and metabolic function.
• Relating to a systemic disease, causing or contributing to renal
dysfunction.
Several additional factors need to be considered:
• Asymptomatic patients often require assessment, following the
discovery of an abnormal BP, urinalysis, or eGFR.
• Symptoms, signs, and investigation ﬁndings are organized into clinically
useful syndromes (see Box 1.1).
• Biochemistry, radiology, and/or histopathology are almost always
required for accurate diagnosis (although a thorough clinical
assessment will lessen over-reliance on expensive and potentially
invasive tests).
• Diagnosis is often suggested by treatment, e.g. cessation of a
nephrotoxic drug or restoration of adequate circulatory volume.
See Table 1.1 for renal disease associations.

Box 1.1 Renal clinical syndromes
• Asymptomatic urinary abnormalities:
• Proteinuria (b p. 58).
• Microscopic haematuria (b p. 66).
• Macroscopic haematuria (b p. 62).
• Nephritic syndrome (b p. 71):
• Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN).
• Pulmonary renal syndromes (b p. 72).
• Nephrotic syndrome (b p. 554. PCR in mg/mmol.)
• Renal tubular syndromes (b p. 76).
• Hypertension (b Chapter 6).
• Acute kidney injury (AKI) (b Chapter 2).
• Chronic kidney disease (CKD) (b Chapter 3).

Past medical history
• Urinary tract problems as a child (e.g. infections, ncturnal enuresis).
• Previously documented renal or urinary tract disease of any kind. Ask
speciﬁcally about infections, stone disease, and, in ♂, prostatic disease.
• Hypertension. When diagnosed? Who is responsible for follow-up?
Current and historical treatment? Level of control? Self-monitoring
with home BP monitor?
• Cardiovascular risk factors or disease (e.g. IHD, CVA, PVD, dyslipidaemia).
• Other relevant systemic disease (e.g. diabetes mellitus, connective
tissue disorder, gout, inﬂammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis).
• Insurance or employment medicals can provide invaluable historical
benchmarks. Can they recall a past BP check or providing a urine
specimen? Have they had blood tests in the past?

Clinical assessment

Clinical history: symptoms and
social history
Local symptoms of urinary tract disease
• Pain:
• Loin pain.
• Ureteric colic.
• Suprapubic pain.
• Haematuria.
• Change in urine appearance.
• Changes in urine volume:
• Polyuria.
• Oliguria and anuria.
• Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS):
• Obstructive (voiding) symptoms:
— Impaired size or force of the urinary stream.
— Hesitancy or abdominal straining.
— Intermittent or interrupted ﬂow.
— Post-micturition dribble.
— A sensation of incomplete emptying.
— Acute retention of urine.
• Storage (ﬁlling) symptoms:
— Nocturia.
— Daytime frequency.
— Urgency.
— Urge incontinence.
— Dysuria.

Social history
• Smoking: general CV risk in (and progression of) CKD, renovascular
disease, urothelial malignancy (74-fold risk), pulmonary haemorrhage in
Goodpasture’s disease.
• Physical activity.
• Occupational history: risk factors for urothelial malignancy (b p. 750).
Hydrocarbon exposure has been implicated in glomerular disease,
particularly anti-GBM disease.
• Hepatitis and HIV risk factors.
• A patient’s understanding of their kidney disease should be evaluated,
and they should be encouraged to be involved in decisions about
their care.

CLINICAL HISTORY: SYMPTOMS AND SOCIAL HISTORY

Renal diseases are often chronic disorders, incurring appreciable social
morbidity. Factors, such as social isolation, accommodation, and work
situation, are hugely important. In ESRD, social circumstance will exert
an important inﬂuence on choice of, and ability to cope with, a particular dialysis modality. Livelihood may also be affected—one of the
goals of RRT, wherever possible, should be to keep an individual in
employment. Quality of life must never be forgotten amidst all the
blood tests.

Review of systems
May provide clues to an underlying systemic condition, such as connective tissue disorder or vasculitis.
• Skin rashes.
• Photosensitivity.
• Mouth ulcers.
• Painful, stiff, or swollen joints.
• Myalgia.
• Raynaud’s phenomenon.
• Fevers.
• Night sweats.
• Thromboembolic episodes.
• Red or painful eyes.
• ENT:
• Sinusitis.
• Rhinitis.
• Epistaxis.
• Hearing loss.
• Sicca symptoms (dry eyes, dry mouth).
• Haemoptysis.
• Hair loss.
• Paraesthesiae.

tell a story of its own. 2 Ask candidly about compliance.
• Antihypertensive therapy—past and present. Any important tablet
intolerances or side effects.
• Analgesics—ask speciﬁcally about common NSAIDs (by their
over-the-counter names, if necessary). Then ask again.
• Any ‘one-off’ courses of therapy that may not be mentioned as part of
regular treatment, e.g. recent antibiotics (interstitial nephritis).

• Steroids, immunosuppressive agents—type and duration.
• Non-prescription, recreational (cocaine, IVDU), and herbal
(b p. 901) medicines.
• Current or historical exposure to important nephrotoxic drugs (see

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical history: additional factors
Sexual, gynaecological, and obstetric history
• Decreased libido and impotence are extremely common in both ♂
and ♀ with CKD.
• Irregular menses and subfertility are frequently encountered in ♀.
Amenorrhoea is common in ESRD.
• Previous pregnancies and any complications (UTI, proteinuria, i BP,
pre-eclampsia). Miscarriages, terminations? Were infants healthy and
born at term?
• In CKD, maternal and fetal outcomes are importantly related to GFR,
degree of proteinuria, and BP (b p. 856).
• Cytotoxic drugs used in the treatment of glomerular disease can l
premature menopause in ♀ or infertility in ♂. This may inﬂuence
treatment in a ♀ of childbearing age. Pre-treatment sperm banking
can be offered in ♂.
• Risk factors for sexually transmitted disease when appropriate (HIV,
hepatitis B and C can all cause glomerular disease).

Dietary history
Changes in appetite and weight. Dietary habits (alcohol, vegan, ethnic diet,
protein or creatine supplements). Dietary advice is an important part of
the management of many renal disorders (i BP, AKI, CKD, the nephrotic
syndrome, stone disease, dialysis).

Ethnicity and renal disease
• IgA nephropathy: Caucasians and certain Asian populations (China,
Japan, and Singapore).
• Diabetic nephropathy: black, Mexican American, Pima Indian (a native
American tribe in Southern Arizona, beloved of epidemiologists and
geneticists). An increasing problem in the immigrant Asian population
in the UK.
• SLE: Asian and black patients (and more aggressive disease).
• Hypertension and hypertensive renal failure: black patients.
• In the UK, the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is 73x
higher in South Asian and black patients than in Caucasians.

CLINICAL HISTORY: ADDITIONAL FACTORS

Approach to the patient on renal replacement therapy
When managing a dialysis or transplant patient, there are a few direct
questions that will help you to get to grips with (and reassure the patient
that you are familiar with) their treatment. It will also facilitate discussion
with the patient’s renal unit.
The patient on haemodialysis
• Where does the haemodialysis treatment take place?
• How many times per week do they dialyse and how many hours is
each treatment?
• What is the patient’s current access for dialysis (e.g. an arteriovenous
ﬁstula, a PTFE graft, or a tunnelled dialysis catheter)?
• What is their usual ﬂuid gain between treatments?
• Do they know their blood pressure at the end of a dialysis session?
The patient on peritoneal dialysis
• Are their exchanges performed manually during the day (CAPD) or
automated overnight (APD)?
• How many exchanges do they perform?
• How many litres is each exchange?
• Do they have ﬂuid in at the moment?
• Do they need assistance to perform an exchange?
• Do they measure their own blood pressure at home? What have the
readings been recently?
• Is the exit site of their dialysis catheter clean and dry?
• Are the dialysis bags clear or cloudy on drainage?
• When was their last episode of peritonitis?
All dialysis patients
• How long have they been on dialysis?
• How much urine do they pass, if any?
• What is their dry (aka ﬂesh, target, post-dialysis) weight?
• What is their daily ﬂuid allowance?
• Do they adhere to a renal diet?
• Do they know the cause of their end-stage renal disease?
• Do they receive erythropoietin injections? Who performs these?
• Have they always been on the same modality of dialysis?
• Are they ‘listed’ for deceased donor transplantation?
• Have they previously received a transplant?
• How are they coping with dialysis?
The transplant patient
• When and where was the transplant performed?
• What immunosuppression is the patient taking?
• Who is responsible for their follow-up?
• Do they know their baseline SCr?
• Was the transplant from a living or deceased donor?
• Do they use sunblock and attend a skin clinic?
• Do they know if they had any rejection episodes?
• Do they know the cause of their end-stage renal disease?
• What mode of dialysis were they on prior to transplantation?

Palpating the kidneys
• The kidneys are generally only palpable in very thin patients.
• The right kidney is more accessible than the left.
• Place the left hand posteriorly in the loin and the right hand on the
abdomen lateral to the umbilicus.
• On deep inspiration, the lower pole may be palpable by pushing the
right hand gently inwards and upwards.
• The normal kidney surface usually feels ﬁrm and smooth.
• ‘Balloting’ the kidney refers to palpation whilst pushing up ﬁrmly
from behind. Using this technique, it may be possible to gently
‘bounce’ an enlarged kidney back and forth between the hands.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Physical examination: the circulation
2 The ability to assess the volume status of a patient is critical to the
practice of renal medicine. In the vast majority of cases, it can be achieved
at the bedside without invasive monitoring.

Hypovolaemia
Salt and water (or blood) loss leads to d effective circulating volume and
eventual shock. Signs include:
• d BP (and d pulse pressure).
• Postural d BP (fall in SBP >10mmHg); if it is not possible to stand the
patient up, then BP measurements with the patient supine, and then
with the head of the bed raised, can be helpful.
• Sinus tachycardia and postural i HR (i in HR >10 beats/min).
• d JVP. Neck veins ﬂat, even if supine.
• Cool peripheries and peripheral vasoconstriction ( septic patients
may be vasodilated and warm).
• Poor urine output (UO).
• Decreasing weight.
• Positive response to a ﬂuid challenge.
• Positive passive leg raising test.
(Much) less reliable signs include:
• d capillary reﬁll, poor skin turgor (forehead and anterior triangle of
the neck), dry mouth and mucous membranes, sunken eyes.

Hypervolaemia
Increased ECF volume may be found with i intravascular volume,
i interstitial space volume—or both.  It is possible to be simultaneously
salt- and water-overloaded and intravascularly depleted (e.g. CCF or a
nephrotic patient receiving diuretics). See Box 1.3.

Box 1.3 Volume expansion and overload
Increased circulating volume
i BP
Elevation of the JVP

Increased interstitial ﬂuid
Peripheral or generalized oedema
Pulmonary oedema (tachypnoea, tachycardia,
a third heart sound 9 basal crackles)
Pleural effusion(s)
Ascites
Increasing weight

Both ﬂuid depletion and ﬂuid overload are harmful. Extremes can be relatively easy to recognize, but it is difﬁcult to consistently diagnose euvolaemia, i.e. the point at which ﬂuid administration is no longer necessary.
Clinical assessment relies on frequent evaluation of the patient‘s response
to ﬂuid challenges. In case of progressive AKI, particularly in the context
of multi-organ dysfunction, a referral to critical care for haemodynamic
monitoring should be considered.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: THE CIRCULATION

Invasive monitoring: a primer for the non-intensivist
In critically ill patients, the main priority is to reverse/prevent organ
(including renal) dysfunction through restoration of tissue perfusion and
O2 delivery. This involves the optimization of ﬂuid status and cardiac
output (CO) (reminder: O2 delivery = heart rate × stroke volume × O2
saturation × Hb × 1.36).
The aim of haemodynamic resuscitation is to avoid both ﬂuid depletion and overload (i.e. patient ‘not too dry and not too wet’) and to optimize CO whilst avoiding excess catecholamine (‘enough but not more’).
To achieve these goals, clinical assessment may be unreliable, and
non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring is often desirable—especially in
patients with sepsis, hypoproteinaemia 9 cardiac failure.
Measurement of cardiac output
Historically, haemodynamic monitoring centred on measurement of CVP
and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PaOP or ‘wedge pressure’).
However, many studies demonstrated that these do not accurately correlate with ﬂuid status and cardiac performance, particularly in patients
with cardiac failure. Instead, more dynamic parameters have increasingly
supplanted them, e.g. variation in stroke volume, arterial pressure, or pulse
pressure after a ﬂuid challenge. Evidence remains light; other than for passive leg raising, there is little evidence underpinning the use of dynamic variables for prediction of volume responsiveness in non-ventilated patients.
Haemodynamic monitoring used in the critical care environment
• Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC): insertion of a balloon-tipped
catheter into the pulmonary artery allows measurement of CVP,
right atrial pressure, right ventricular pressure, pulmonary artery
pressure, PaOP, CO, and mixed venous O2 saturation. X Utility
remains controversial. Associated with signiﬁcant risks ( damage to
chordae, arrhythmias, rupture of pulmonary artery). Use decreasing.
• Echocardiography: an excellent tool for assessment of haemodynamics
but operator-dependent and not a continuous technique.
• Oesophageal Doppler: measures blood ﬂow velocity in descending aorta
(correlates with CO). Non-invasive but dependent on operator’s skill
and placement/positioning. Not tolerated in non-ventilated patients.
• Lithium dilution technique: measures CO via rate of change in lithium
chloride concentration between venous and arterial system. Requires
arterial line and CV line. Suitable for non-ventilated patients.
• Pulse contour analysis: continuous measurement of CO and
stroke volume variation, using the arterial waveform. Underlying
principle: the contour of the waveform is proportional to stroke
volume and the mechanical properties of the artery. Stroke volume
is calculated by the change from end-diastole to systole over time.
Requires an arterial line. Can be used in non-ventilated patients.
• Thoracic electrical bioimpedance: CO measurement via electrodes
on the patient’s chest and neck. Non-invasive. Less accurate with
pulmonary oedema, pleural effusions, and chest wall oedema.
Specialist expertise required, so not in routine use.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Urine: appearance
2 Examination of the urine should be considered a routine extension of
the physical examination in all patients.

Appearance
• Depending on concentration, normal urine is clear or given a light
yellow hue by urochrome and uroerythrin pigments.
• Cloudy urine may result from high concentrations of leucocytes,
epithelial cells, or bacteria. Precipitation of phosphates can also
produce turbidity in urine refrigerated for storage.
• Speciﬁc circumstances result in characteristic changes in the
appearance of the urine that may assist diagnosis at an early stage
(see Box 1.4).
• Blood causes a pink to black discoloration, depending on the number
of RBCs and length of time present.
• Jaundice (conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia) may cause dark yellow or
brown urine.
• Haemoglobinuria from intravascular haemolysis (b p. 155) and
myoglobinuria from muscle breakdown (b p. 152) are both causes of
dark urine that tests +ve for blood on dipstick examination. However:
• If the sample is centrifuged, the supernatant will remain coloured
and continue to test +ve.
• No red cells are seen on microscopy.
• Speciﬁc assays for haemoglobin and myoglobin are available.
• Normal urine tends to darken on standing (urobilinogen oxidizes to
coloured urobilin) (see Box 1.4).
• Chyluria is a rare cause of turbid urine. It has a milky appearance
(particularly after fatty meals) and settles into layers on standing.
Results from a ﬁstulous connection between the lymphatic and urinary
systems (usually malignancy, though lymphatic obstruction by Filaria
bancrofti is more important worldwide).
• Beetroot can produce red urine due to enhanced intestinal absorption
of the pigment betalaine in genetically susceptible individuals. Rarely
causes diagnostic confusion.

Odour
Offensive urine usually denotes infection (bacterial ammonium production). Sweet urine suggests ketones. Certain rare metabolic diseases confer
characteristic smells—one can only hope to encounter maple-syrup urine
disease before isovaleric acidaemia (‘sweaty feet urine’) (see Box 1.5).

Pneumaturia
• The presence of air bubbles in urine suggests a vesicocolic ﬁstula.
• Causes:
• Diverticular disease.
• Colonic cancer.
• Inﬂammatory bowel disease.

Box 1.5 Proust’s chamber pot
While Proust wrote lyrically about the unusual bouquet of his urine following asparagus ingestion, there are many who remain oblivious to a
phenomenon instantly recognizable to others.
Two potential explanations for this olfactory diversity have been
offered: (i) the production of the required fragrant metabolites is subject
to variation through genetic polymorphism, i.e. some individuals excrete
the perfumed compound(s), while others do not; (ii) everyone produces
the metabolite(s), but only some have the necessary olfactory talent
required to detect it/them.
The genetics are not straightforward, although an association between
the ability to notice one’s own ‘asparagus urine’ and a cluster of olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 1 has been described. Even the
identity of the relevant substances remains uncertain, with a plethora
of sulphur-containing compounds, such as methanethiol and dimethyl
sulphide, proposed as the culprits.
Overall, it seems likely that there is genetic variation and that the
two theories are not mutually exclusive, i.e. those who produce
asparagus-perfumed urine may not always be able to detect it, while
those who can might not necessarily produce it themselves.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Urinalysis: chemical analysis
Osmolality and speciﬁc gravity
Speciﬁc gravity
Refers to the weight of a solution, with respect to an equal weight of
distilled water (normal range 1.003–1.035 in urine). Can be estimated with
a dipstick, but, for accurate measurement, an osmometer (urinometer) is
required.
Osmolality
Refers to the solute concentration of a solution. It cannot be measured
with a dipstick. In the absence of signiﬁcant glycosuria, the concentrations
of Na+, Cl–, and urea are the most important determinants in urine. The
ability to vary urine osmolality (range 50–1350mOsmol/kg) plays a central
role in the regulation of plasma osmolality (maintained across a narrow
range: 280–305mOsmol/kg).
Generally speaking, speciﬁc gravity and osmolality correlate. An exception is when relatively large particles, such as glucose, proteins, and radio
contrast media, are present in the urine. These produce an i in speciﬁc
gravity, with little change in osmolality.
Uses
Investigation of polyuria and hypo-/hypernatraemic states (b p. 782).
Recurrent stone formers can monitor their own urine speciﬁc gravity to
maintain a dilute urine that discourages stone development.

Isosthenuria
CKD leads to a progressive d in the range of urinary osmolality that
the kidneys can generate. In advanced renal insufﬁciency, the osmolality
becomes relatively ﬁxed at 7300mOsmol/kg (71.010 speciﬁc gravity)—
close to that of glomerular ﬁltrate. In this situation, the urine cannot be
adequately concentrated or diluted in response to Na+ and water depletion and overload, respectively. This is termed isosthenuria.
Urinary pH
Urinary pH ranges from 4.5 to 8.0 (usually 5.0–6.0), depending on systemic acid–base status. Most people (except vegans) pass acidic urine the
majority of the time. Isolated urinary pH measurements provide very little
useful information. Their main clinical use is the investigation of systemic
metabolic acidosis. In this situation, a fall in urinary pH (to around 5) is
expected, as acid is excreted. Failure of this response may indicate renal
tubular acidosis (b p. 824). Most urine dipsticks have an indicator strip
for estimation of pH, but, if a tubular disorder is suspected, a pH meter
should be used.
In certain situations, the therapeutic manipulation of urinary pH might
be useful (see Box 1.6).

URINALYSIS: CHEMICAL ANALYSIS

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Urinalysis: further tests
Further dipstick tests
Leucocyte esterase and nitrites
Increasingly used as indicators of infection. Detection of neutrophil esterase activity identiﬁes white cells (pyuria), while the nitrite test exploits the
ability of some urinary pathogens (though not all—notably certain Gram
+ve organisms, including Strep. faecalis, Staph. albus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae,
as well as many Pseudomonas spp. and mycobacteria) to reduce nitrate l
nitrite. Positivity requires an adequate dietary nitrate intake as well as sufﬁcient bladder dwell time (preferably >4h).
When combined, these methods possess good speciﬁcity (i.e. take seriously if +ve) though only modest sensitivity (i.e. treat a –ve result with
caution if infection is likely clinically). 2 While they can serve as a useful
screening test in at-risk populations they are not a substitute for microscopy and culture.
Bilirubin and urobilinogen
• Conjugated (6 water-soluble) bilirubin l biliary excretion l small
bowel l converted to urobilinogen l distal reabsorption l partially
excreted in the urine.
• This means: (i) unconjugated (water-insoluble) bilirubin does not pass
into the urine (6 dipstick +ve bilirubin indicates hepatic or cholestatic
disease); (ii) the absence of dipstick urobilinogen in a jaundiced patient
suggests biliary obstruction.
Glucose
Glycosuria results when tubular reabsorptive capacity for glucose is
exceeded (plasma level >10mmol/L). A valuable screening tool, but less
useful for diagnosis and monitoring of DM.
‘Renal’ glycosuria occurs when proximal tubular injury leads to a failure
to reabsorb ﬁltered glucose (b p. 76).

Causes of a +ve dipstick for ketones
• Dipsticks semi-quantitatively detect acetoacetate (but not
B-hydroxybutyrate).
• A +ve test can be seen in:
• Diabetic ketoacidosis (and occasionally severe intercurrent illness
in T2DM).
• Prolonged fasting and starvation diets (e.g. Atkins’ diet).
• Alcoholic ketoacidosis.
• Severe volume depletion.
• Isopropyl alcohol poisoning (hand-rubs, solvents, and de-icers).

URINALYSIS: FURTHER TESTS

Urinary test strips
A variety of test strips for urinalysis are available. Some have a speciﬁc purpose, e.g. Clinistix® (glucose), Hemastix® (blood), and Albustix®
(albumin). Others cast a wider net, with various combinations of the
following:
• Speciﬁc gravity.
• pH.
• Leucocytes.
• Nitrites.
• Glucose.
• Urobilinogen.
• Bilirubin.
• Ketones.
• Albumin or protein.*
• Blood.
*Dipsticks able to detect microalbuminuria are also available.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Urinalysis: protein
Introduction
• Urinary protein excretion should not exceed 150mg/day, of which less
than 20mg is albumin.
• The remainder consists mainly of non-serum-derived tubular
mucoprotein, such as Tamm–Horsfall/uromodulin.
• i excretion of albumin is a sensitive marker of renal, particularly
glomerular, disease (b p. 58).
• Protein excretion can be measured in untimed (‘spot’) or timed
(usually 24h) samples.
Proteinuria (total protein) and albuminuria (albumin) are not strictly
interchangeable terms. When screening for early renal disease, speciﬁc
tests for albumin are preferable.

Dipsticks
Convenient, highly speciﬁc, but less sensitive. Contain pH-sensitive indicators that change colour when bound to negatively charged proteins.
Predominantly detect albumin (some are albumin-speciﬁc, e.g. Albustix®)
and may not identify large amounts of other proteins, e.g. Bence–Jones.
Dipsticks have completely superseded sulphosalicylic acid turbidity testing.
A +ve result occurs with protein excretion ≥300mg/L. Lower amounts
of proteinuria, particularly in the context of diabetes, are termed microalbuminuria (b p. 60) (deﬁned as 30–300mg/day) and usually measured
by ELISA or radioimmunoassay (although sensitive dipsticks are available).
Dipsticks are semi-quantitative. As a rough guide:

++
+++

70.15–0.3g/L

 Changes in urinary concentration affect the result. If volumes are high
and the urine dilute, large amounts of protein can go undetected (speciﬁc
gravity may be a clue). Concentrated morning samples are 6 preferable.
2 If +ve dipstick test of ≥1+, repeat after 1–2wk. If persistent, verify with a
protein/creatinine ratio (uPCR) or albumin/creatinine ratio (uACR).

Timed collections
Historically, 24h urine collections were preferred to spot urine samples.
However, they suffered from signiﬁcant drawbacks, including inaccurate
collection (see Box 1.7) and the time required for lab processing.

URINALYSIS: PROTEIN

Box 1.7 uACR and uPCR (see also b p. 197)
• Untimed (‘spot’) urine samples are now used virtually universally for
the detection and monitoring of proteinuria.
• Urinary excretion of creatinine generally remains constant
(710mmol/day).
• uACR and uPCR correct for variations in urinary concentration
(caused by changes in hydration) and correlate well with
measurements obtained from timed collections.
• A ﬁrst morning urine specimen is preferable.
• 2 The relationship between uACR and uPCR is non-linear (see
Table 1.3).
• It can be helpful to multiply uPCR x 10 to provide an estimate of 24h
excretion, e.g. uPCR of 125mg/mmol approximates to 1.25g/24h.
• In the USA and in labs where urinary Cr is measured in mg/dL,
rather than mmol/L, uACR is expressed as mg/g.
• Normal: <30mg/g.
• Microalbuminuria: 30–300mg/g.
• Overt proteinuria: >300mg/g.
• uACR and uPCR will underestimate proteinuria when Cr excretion
is high (black people, muscular build) and overestimate when Cr
excretion is low (elderly, cachectic). However, they are useful for
serial monitoring in individual patients.
• uACR is more sensitive than uPCR if screening for early disease in
high-risk groups (especially diabetes), but total uPCR is an adequate
alternative in most circumstances.
• Dipsticks that aim to estimate uPCR await further validation.

•
•

Non-acidiﬁed, clearly labelled container.
Pick a convenient day with minimum commitments.
Discard ﬁrst urine void on that day.
Start collection—all subsequent urine into the container (including
overnight).
• First void the following day into the collection.
• Since Cr excretion, or creatinine clearance (CrCl) (b p. 33), should
be similar in two successive samples from the same patient, their
measurement in ‘back to back’ 24h collections may enhance reliability
(i.e. disregard the result if CrCl differs greatly between the two).

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Urinalysis: red blood cells
Introduction
Haematuria is deﬁned (arbitrarily) as the presence of two RBCs per
high-powered ﬁeld (hpf) in spun urine. The amount determines whether it
is visible to the naked eye (macroscopic haematuria) or requires a dipstick
or microscopy for detection (microscopic haematuria). Causes and investigation are considered later (b p. 62).

Dipstick
Hb induces a colour change (usually green) in a dye linked to organic peroxide. Dipsticks detect as little as two RBCs per ﬁeld and are at least as
sensitive as microscopic examination (though appreciable false –ve rate).
However, if a dipstick is +ve, it is still desirable to perform conﬁrmatory
microscopy.
Dipsticks detect Hb and 6 remain +ve, even after RBC lysis. They also
detect haemoglobinuria from intravascular haemolysis as well as myoglobin from muscle breakdown (l though red cells will be absent on microscopy in both situations).

Urine sediment
Regrettably, a dying art, but microscopic examination of the urine sediment remains a valuable investigation (see Box 1.8).
Urinary RBCs may have variable morphology (see Fig. 1.3). Those that
have passed through the glomerular basement membrane and suffered
osmotic stress in the tubules may have an abnormal appearance, best
appreciated under phase contrast microscopy (see Box 1.8).
In expert hands, the presence of these ‘dysmorphic’ red cells can help
distinguish glomerular from lower urinary tract bleeding.  However, the
presence of dysmorphic cells does not rule out a lower tract lesion.

Non-glomerular bleeding:
Red blood cells have normal
morphology
Glomerular bleeding:
Red blood cells that pass
into the urine through an
inflamed or damaged
glomerulus may show
budding, spiculation or
other surface irregularities

Fig. 1.3 Morphology of red blood cells.

URINALYSIS: RED BLOOD CELLS

Box 1.8 Examination of the urine sediment
• Tell the patient to discard the ﬁrst few mL of urine and then collect
20mL into a universal container.
• Process and analyse the sample within a few hours (red cell lysis!).
• Centrifuge a 10mL aliquot at 400g for 10min.
• Remove 9.5mL of supernatant with a pipette.
• Resuspend the pellet in the remaining 0.5mL of urine (gently!).
• Transfer a drop of resuspended urine to a slide.
• Cover the sample (unstained) with a coverslip.
• Examine (preferably) with a phase contrast microscope at 160 x and
400 x magniﬁcation.
• Cellular elements are quantitated as number per high-powered ﬁeld.
• Look also for casts and other elements.
• Use polarized light to identify crystals.
• Clean the microscope, and discard all the urine!
• In an urgent situation, e.g. for rapid diagnosis of UTI, an unspun
sample may be examined.
• It may be necessary to acidify the urine to prevent precipitation of
(view-obscuring) phosphate crystals.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Urinalysis: cells, organisms,
and casts
Leucocytes
Neutrophils: leucocytes are a prominent feature of urinary infection but
may also be present in inﬂammatory renal conditions (GN, TIN). Sterile
pyuria refers to the situation wherein leucocytes are seen consistently on
microscopy, but subsequent culture is sterile.

Causes of sterile pyuria
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Partially treated UTI or fastidious organism (e.g. Chlamydia).
Calculi.
Prostatitis.
Bladder tumour.
Papillary necrosis.
TIN.
TB (send 3 x EMUs, b p. 696).
Appendicitis.

Lymphocytes: may be a feature of chronic tubulointerstitial disease.
Eosinophils: identiﬁed with Hansel’s or Wright’s stain. Associated with TIN
(b p. 580) but also occasionally present in other conditions, including
RPGN, prostatitis, and atheroemboli. Renal tubular cells: large, oval cells.
Present in normal urine but i in tubular damage (ATN or TIN). Squamous
epithelial cells: large cells with small nuclei, often of urethral origin (or skin/
vaginal contaminant). Transitional epithelial (urothelial) cells: suggest cystitis.
Malignant cells: special stains, immunocytochemistry, and ﬂow cytometry
all assist detection (b p. 751).

Microorganisms
• Bacteriuria: normal urine is sterile. Simultaneous presence of
leucocytes suggests true infection, rather than contamination. Gram
staining enables initial identiﬁcation and cell count while culture and
sensitivity results are awaited.
• Fungi: Candida species are most frequently encountered. Typical
appearance is that of a small pale green cell, often with visible budding.
May result from genital contamination. Risk factors for colonization
are: indwelling foreign body (ureteric stents, bladder catheter), DM,
antibiotic therapy, and immunosuppression.
• Trichomonas: oval and ﬂagellate (motile if alive). Usually a genital
contaminant.
• Schistosoma haematobium: ova detection is an important technique in
endemic areas.

URINALYSIS: CELLS, ORGANISMS, AND CASTS

Urine culture
M,C+S differentiates contamination from true infection and guides treatment. A pure growth of >105 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL is the conventional diagnostic criterion for urinary tract infection (b p. 707).

Casts
Casts are plugs of Tamm–Horsfall mucoprotein within the renal tubules,
with a characteristic cylindrical shape. They are classiﬁed according to
appearance and the cellular elements embedded in them. Though produced in normal kidneys, they can be valuable clues to the presence of
renal disease (see Fig. 1.4).
Non-cellular casts
• Hyaline casts: mucoprotein alone and virtually transparent.
A non-speciﬁc ﬁnding that occurs in concentrated urine.
• Granular casts: granular material (aggregates of protein or cellular
remnants) is embedded in the cast. Often pathological but
non-speciﬁc.
• Broad or waxy casts: hyaline material with a waxy appearance under
the microscope. Form in dilated, poorly functioning tubules of
advanced CKD.
Cellular casts
• Red cell casts: 2 virtually diagnostic of GN.
• White cell casts: characteristic of acute pyelonephritis—may help to
distinguish upper from lower tract infection. Also occur in TIN.
• Epithelial cell casts: sloughed epithelial cells embedded in
mucoprotein. A non-speciﬁc feature of ATN. Also found in GN.
• Fatty casts: contain either lipid-ﬁlled tubular epithelial cells or free
lipid globules. Distinguished from other casts by ‘Maltese cross’
appearance under polarized light. Occur in the lipid-laden urine
of the nephrotic syndrome. Lipids may also appear as droplets or
crystals. When clumped, these are referred to as oval fat bodies.
• Other casts: under the right conditions, any constituent of the urine
(microorganisms, crystals, bilirubin, or myoglobin) may become
entrapped in a mucoprotein cast.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Urinalysis: crystals
Detected by examining the urine under polarized light (see Fig. 1.5).
 Most crystals are clinically irrelevant.

Uric acid
Usually lozenges with a yellow-brown hue. Precipitate at acid pH. A few
may be normal (e.g. high meat intake), but i quantities may indicate
hyperuricosuria. May be present in acute urate nephropathy (tumour lysis
syndrome, b p. 160).

Calcium oxalate
May be monohydrated (ovoid) or bihydrated (pyramidal—like the back of
an envelope). Prefer an acidic pH but not always. A few may be normal
(spinach and chocolate ingestion) but can denote hypercalciuria or hyperoxaluria (b p. 721). A diagnostic clue in ethylene glycol poisoning in both
real life and exams (b p. 910).

Calcium phosphate
Heterogeneous in their appearance (l needles, prisms, stars). Favoured
by alkaline pH. Might be a risk factor for calcium stone formation.

Magnesium ammonium phosphate (triple phosphate)
Birefringent prisms (‘cofﬁn lids’). Prefer alkaline pH. If present, exclude a
Proteus UTI.

Amorphous phosphates
Unattractive clumps in (alkaline) urine cooled for storage. No clinical
signiﬁcance.

Cystine
Hexagonal. Cystine is not a constituent of normal urine so always signiﬁcant. Prefer acid urine. A marker of cystinuria (b p. 719).

Cholesterol
Thin plates with sharp edges. Occur with heavy proteinuria.

Drug-induced crystalluria
Many drugs can precipitate in the renal tubule. In severe cases this may
cause AKI.
• Antibiotics: sulfadiazine, amoxicillin.
• Antiviral agents: aciclovir, valaciclovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir,
valganciclovir, and indinavir.
• Methotrexate.
• Primidone (a barbiturate).
• Triamterene.
• Vitamin C (calcium oxalate deposition).

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Determining renal function
Introduction
Several aspects of renal function can be measured. The most important is
glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR). Glomerular ﬁltrate refers to the ultraﬁltrate of plasma that crosses the glomerular barrier into the urinary space.
GFR is measured per unit time (usually expressed mL/min) and represents
the sum of ﬁltration rates in all functioning nephrons (6 a surrogate for the
amount of functioning renal tissue).
GFR is relatively constant in an individual. d GFR may result from
a reduction in nephron number or a reduction in the GFR of single
nephrons (d SNGFR). A reduction in number can be compensated for by
an increase in SNGFR through elevated glomerular capillary pressure or
glomerular hypertrophy ( this means signiﬁcant kidney damage may not
initially be associated with d GFR).
GFR is useful for:
• Providing a consistent measure of kidney function.
• Monitoring progression of CKD (and response to treatment).
• Forecasting the need for dialysis and transplantation.
• Determining appropriate drug dosing in renal impairment (b p. 874).
It provides no information regarding the cause of renal insufﬁciency.

Measurement of GFR
• Measured indirectly by evaluating clearance from plasma of a (renally
excreted) marker substance.
• Clearance: the volume of plasma from which this substance is removed
per unit time.
• Suitable markers require certain characteristics shown in the following
list and may be endogenous (e.g. Cr) or exogenous (e.g. inulin).
• Inulin, a fructose polysaccharide for which (along with ﬂatulence) we
have the Jerusalem artichoke to thank, remains the gold standard. Cost
and technical considerations (it requires a continuous infusion) prohibit
routine use.

Characteristics of an ideal clearance marker
•
•
•
•
•
•

Safe to administer, economical, and easy to measure.
Freely ﬁltered at the glomerulus.
Not protein-bound (able to distribute in the extracellular space).
Present at a stable plasma concentration.
No extra-renal elimination.
Not reabsorbed, secreted, or metabolized by the kidney.

DETERMINING RENAL FUNCTION

In clinical practice, GFR is estimated by one of the following means:
• Serum Cr (and, to a lesser extent, urea).
• Formulae based on the serum creatinine (estimated or eGFR).
• Creatinine clearance (CrCl) from a 24h urine collection.
• Isotopic clearance (e.g. EDTA-GFR or DTPA-GFR).

Aspects of renal function
• Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR).
• Tubular function (including Na+ and K+ handling and urinary
concentrating/diluting capacity).
• Acid–base balance.
• Endocrine function:
• Renin–angiotensin system (RAS).
• Erythropoietin production.
• Vitamin D metabolism.
Not measured in clinical practice
• Autocrine (l production of endothelins, prostaglandins, natriuretic
peptides, nitric oxide).
• Protein and polypeptide metabolism (e.g. insulin catabolism).

31

32

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Creatinine
Serum creatinine
• Convenient and inexpensive—the most commonly used indirect
measure of GFR. It is estimated that it is measured over 300 million
times annually in the USA.
• Generated from non-enzymatic metabolism of creatine in skeletal
muscle. Production is proportional to muscle mass (20g muscle l71mg
Cr). Little short-term variation in an individual.
• 725% is derived from dietary meat intake (creatine mostly; creatinine if
the meat is stewed).
• d muscle mass (elderly, cachectic) li Cr production l
overestimation of GFR.
Ucrx V is relatively constant in the formula for CrCl (where V is volume).
So
CrCl = (urineCr x V)/plasmaCr
Becomes
CrCl = constant/plasmaCr
Hence, serum Cr varies inversely with GFR: d GFR li SCr (until a new
steady state is reached).
• Cr meets many, but not all, of the criteria for a clearance marker.
Shortcomings:
• It is secreted by the proximal tubule (710–20% when GFR is
normal), so the amount excreted in the urine exceeds the amount
ﬁltered. As GFR falls, there is a progressive i in tubular secretion
until saturation occurs at SCr 7132–176μmol/L (1.5–2.0 mg/dL);
beyond this point, SCr rises as expected (see Fig. 1.6).
• It undergoes extra-renal elimination by secretion and degradation in
the GI tract. This becomes more important as GFR falls.
• When d GFR is rapid, it takes time for a steady state to be reached
and for SCr to i, i.e. SCr may initially be normal after a catastrophic
renal insult.
• Traditionally measured using the Jaffé alkaline pictrate colorimetric
assay. However, interference by non-creatinine chromogens created
a tradition of overestimating Cr. Enzymatic methods on modern
auto-analysers are generally more accurate, with less variability.
• Certain substances interfere with Cr, either through competitive
inhibition of tubular secretion (cimetidine, trimethoprim, amiloride,
spironolactone, triamterene) or assay interference (in the Jaffé
reaction: bilirubin, ketoacids, vitamin C, glucose, and cephalosporins).

CREATININE

Creatinine clearance
CrCl is calculated as:
CrCl x plasma creatinine (PCr) = urine creatinine (UCr) x volume (V)
6 CrCl = (UCrx V) / PCr
Example
• Serum Cr = 106μmol/L
• Urine Cr = 8800μmol/L
• Urine volume = 1.2L
• CrCl = (UCrx V)/PCr
• CrCl = (8800 x 1.2)÷106 = 99.6L/day
• Conventionally, CrCl is shown in mL/min 6 x 1000/1440
• (99.6 x 1000)/1440 = 69.2mL/min
(normal range: ♀: 95 9 20mL/min; ♂: 120 9 25mL/min)
 Limitations
• Tubular secretion of Cr means that GFR is overestimated.
• Requires accurate urine collection.
• Heir to all the pitfalls inherent in Cr measurement.
• Even if collections are accurate, there is marked serial variation (15–20%).

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

eGFR
Introduction (see also b p. 196)
In the last few years, it has become routine to estimate and classify kidney function and disease using equations based on the serum Cr. This is
termed estimated or eGFR. Such equations attempt to correct for the
confounding effects of body weight, age, sex, race, and muscle mass.

Limitations
Still based on Cr and do not take into account tubular secretion,
extra-renal elimination, or differences in production between individuals
of the same age and sex, or the same individual over time.

Cockcroft–Gault (CG)
eGFR (mL/min) =

1.2 x {140 – age (yr)} x weight (kg)
Cr (μmol/L)

Multiply x 0.85 in ♀ to correct for reduced creatinine production.

MDRD
Widely used internationally and the current basis of CKD classiﬁcation. Developed from data in the Modiﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease
(MDRD) study. However, remains poorly validated in children (age
<18 years), elderly (age >70 years), pregnancy, ethnic groups other than
Caucasians and African Americans, and those without CKD.
eGFR, in mL/min per 1.73m2 =
(170 x (PCr [mg/dL]) exp[–0.999]) x (Age exp[–0.176]) x ((SUrea
[mg/dL]) exp[–0.170]) x ((Albumin [g/dL]) exp[+0.318])
• Multiply x 0.762 if the patient is ♀
• Multiply x 1.180 if the patient is black.
• Simpliﬁed version:
eGFR = 186.3 x ((serum creatinine) exp[–1.154]) x
(Age exp[–0.203]) x (0.742 if ♀) x (1.21 if
African American)
Notes: (i) to convert Cr from mg/dL to μmol/L, x 88.4. To convert urea
from mg/dL to mmol/L, x 0.357; (ii) exp = exponential.
 CG tends to overestimate and MDRD underestimate GFR. Up to
25% of patients will be misclassiﬁed where either is used to categorize
patients according to the KDOQI CKD scheme (b p. 192).

eGFR

CKD-EPI equation
• The CKD Epidemiology Collaboration has pooled data from multiple
studies to produce the CKD-EPI equation.
• Uses the same variables as MDRD.
• The study population included individuals with and without kidney
disease over a wide range of GFRs.
• The equation provides a more accurate assessment of GFR in
individuals with normal or only slightly d GFR (particularly GFR
>60mL/min), resulting in:
• Lower estimates of population CKD prevalence.
• More accurate prediction of adverse outcomes.
• There are still important limitations: 750% will have an eGFR that
is >16mL/min different from true measured GFR (although this
represents a slightly improvement over MDRD).
• Although most laboratories currently report an MDRD eGFR,
a move to adopt CKD-EPI for routine clinical use is likely to be
increasingly advocated.
• The eGFR formulae are available as web-based and downloadable
calculators.
• M http://www.kidney.org/professionals/tools
• M http://www.renal.org/eGFRcalc
• Several useful Apps are also available, e.g. National Kidney
Foundation eGFR calculator, MedCalc, QxMD, MedMath, Epocrates.

Reciprocal of plasma creatinine
• There is an inverse relationship between GFR and SCr:
CrCl = constant / SCr
• Plotting the reciprocal of SCr (1/SCr) against time will often,
though not always, produce a straight line, the slope of the curve
representing change in GFR with time.
• A logarithmic plot of SCr can be used in a similar way.
• This may be useful in two settings:
• Extrapolation of the line can help predict when CKD is likely to
reach ESRD and 6 assist timely planning of RRT.
• A change in the slope of the curve can be used to monitor
treatment: a d in the slope indicates slowed progression, while an
i may indicate a 2nd insult (acute-on-chronic kidney injury).

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

GFR measurement: other methods
Isotopic GFR
Several radiopharmaceuticals (51Cr-EDTA, 99mTc-DTPA, 125I-iothalamate)
compare favourably to inulin for the measurement of GFR. Isotopic techniques are expensive.
Method
A single IV injection, followed by venous sampling at regular intervals
(intervals i, as expected GFR d). Post-injection, plasma isotope activity d rapidly, as it distributes throughout the ECF. A slower exponential
decline (renal elimination) then follows, allowing GFR to be determined.
Protocols based on urine collection are also described.
With DTPA, renal elimination is often measured with a gamma camera positioned directly over the kidneys. While not as precise as venous
sampling, it enables assessment of each individual kidney’s contribution to
total GFR (termed ‘split function’) (b p. 54).

Cystatin C
• The variable nature of Cr production has encouraged the search for
alternative endogenous compounds that might help estimate GFR.
• Cystatin C, a 13kDa cysteine protease inhibitor, is the most
developed of these.
• Produced by all nucleated cells and freely ﬁltered at the glomerulus
before tubular reabsorption and metabolism. Unlike Cr, it does not
undergo tubular secretion, but a degree of extra-renal elimination is
likely.
• Unfortunately, despite early optimism, several important ‘non-GFR’
determinants of cystatin C concentration have been identiﬁed.
• Advancing age, male sex, diabetes, i BMI, i albumin, and i CRP
are all associated with increased levels.
• Relative high or low cell turnover, e.g. i/d thyroidism or steroid
treatment ( transplant patients!), also cause variability.
• Several cystatin C-based eGFR equations have been formulated (as
have equations that incorporate both cystatin C and SCr).
• At present, there remains considerable uncertainty as to any
advantages for GFR estimation, both in the general population and
existing CKD. Available data are frustratingly inconsistent.
• A shorter half-life and smaller volume of distribution led to an
expectation that it might be a more useful marker in the non-steady
state, particularly AKI. However, results have proved variable.
• There also appears to be no clear-cut advantage in the context of
low muscle mass.
• Nonetheless, cystatin C appears to be a better predictor of adverse
outcomes than either SCr or eGFR based on the SCr.
• There is also signiﬁcant current inter-assay and inter-laboratory
variability, although progress is being made toward standardization.
• Overall, it remains to be seen whether it will yet prove itself in
selected circumstances and 6 move into the clinical mainstream.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Renal function in the elderly
The kidneys suffer signiﬁcantly at the hands of the ageing process, with
senescence associated with progressive glomerular and tubulointerstitial
scarring, nephron loss, declining renal function, and downstream consequences for systemic haemodynamics. These changes begin (depressingly)
in the 4th decade and hasten during the 5th and 6th, with increasing clinical
relevance.

Pathology
Macroscopic features include thinning of the renal cortex and an overall
decrease in renal size.
Glomerular
Basement membrane thickening, mesangial matrix expansion, capillary
loop changes, periglomerular ﬁbrosis, glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis (730% by age 80).
Tubular
Dilatation and atrophy (particularly in outer medulla), macrophage inﬁltration, and collagen deposition l interstitial ﬁbrosis.
Vascular
Intimal hyperplasia (l stiffness) of interlobular arteries and afferent
arterioles.

Pathophysiology
• Glomerular hyperﬁltration and hypertrophy l glomerular sclerosis
and scarring l further glomerular hyperﬁltration and hypertrophy.
• Intrarenal RAS activation li A2 l intrarenal (including podocyte)
injury.
• Endothelial dysfunction ld NO production l hypoxic and ischaemic
damage.
• TGF-B overexpression l ﬁbrosis.
• i oxidative stress l tissue damage.
• AGE accumulation.
• Arteriolar hyalinosis l failure of autoregulation l glomerular injury.
• General biological senescence: telomere shortening, mitochondrial
loss, and enhanced apoptosis.

Effect on renal function
GFR
The Baltimore longitudinal study (1958–1981) used serial measurements
of CrCl to show a d GFR of 0.75mL/min/year. Recent studies have used
inulin clearances to show that, although GFR progressively falls in older
age groups (♂ > ♀), it is not necessarily an inevitability. There may be
no demonstrable decline in normotensive, otherwise healthy, individuals,
so it remains important to consider the effect associated comorbidities
(i BP, vascular disease, CCF, etc.) may be having over and above age itself.

RENAL FUNCTION IN THE ELDERLY

Assessment of GFR
SCr is less useful in the elderly because of (i) d muscle mass and (ii) d
urinary Cr excretion. This means that formulae based on SCr (including
MDRD, Cockcroft–Gault, and CKD-EPI) tend to underestimate GFR in
those age >65 (and are not actually robustly validated in this population).

Additional effects of renal ageing
• d renal plasma ﬂow.
• Microalbuminuria and overt albuminuria more common.
• Regulation of Na+ balance is impaired (d excretion l contributes to
i BP in the context of a high-salt western diet).
• i K+ more common (d excretion and d aldosterone). The elderly
are 6 vulnerable to the effect of any medication interfering with K+
excretion (such as ACE-I).
• Water handling (both diluting and concentrating) ability is impaired.
Potential consequences:
• Nocturia is very common.
• Inappropriately dilute urine (and reduced thirst response) despite
i plasma osmolality l dehydration.
• Inadequate excretion following water load l hyponatraemia.
• Impaired distal tubular acidiﬁcation (l mild acidosis).
• i EPO production (although the increase in response to a low Hb is
actually blunted).
• Effects on mineral metabolism: i PTH, d calcitriol, and d PO4.

Clinical relevance
• d muscle mass in the elderly ld SCr.
• 2i SCr in an elderly patient usually represents a signiﬁcant d GFR.
• Although age-related d GFR is common anyway, it will be
exaggerated in the presence of comorbidity, such as i BP and
vascular disease.
• X CKD is common in the elderly:
• In NHANES (1999–2004), nearly 745% of elderly subjects had
CKD (b p. 194) by current criteria, with those aged >70
accounting for 50% of CKD overall.
• However, is early CKD relevant in this age group? For example,
GFR 50–59mL/min does not increase CV mortality in comparison
to >60mL/min?
• In view of this, many believe CKD is an unhelpful term in the
majority of individuals in this age group.
• The incidence and prevalence of ESRD is higher in the elderly
(mean age of RRT is mid-60s).
• AKI and acute-on-chronic kidney disease are both more common.
• The elderly are more vulnerable to the effects of nephrotoxic drugs.
• The elderly are also more prone to electrolyte imbalances occurring
through disease or inappropriate medical management (e.g.
indisciplined perioperative ﬂuid therapy).

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Immunological and serological
investigation
Introduction
Immunological and serological testing are widely (perhaps too widely)
undertaken in the work-up of many forms of renal disease. Although helpful, such tests are rarely diagnostic in isolation and must always be interpreted in the context of a detailed clinical assessment.
There are a few common scenarios where the ‘renal screen’ is often
performed (see Table 1.5):
• Unexplained AKI (b p. 119) or progressive CKD.
• For correlation with histology after a renal biopsy (b p. 82).
• During follow-up to assess disease activity or response to treatment.

IMMUNOLOGICAL AND SEROLOGICAL INVESTIGATION

Complement and the kidney
(See Tables 1.6 and 1.7.)
• Common investigations are immunoassays for C3 and C4 and a
functional assay for the total haemolytic component (CH50).
• C3 and C4 measure circulating amount, while CH50 assesses
activation (it measures the 50% red cell haemolysing dose of
complement).
• C3 and C4 can be used to screen for classical and alternative
pathway abnormalities, with diseases associated with high
levels of circulating immune complexes associated with
hypocomplementaemia.
• Low C3 implies tissue injury, with activation of either the classical or
alternative complement pathway.
• Low C4 implies activation of the classical pathway (or a hereditary
null allele).
• CH50 is a good screen for overall complement activity (e.g. a patient
with recurrent infections).
C3 nephritic factor (C3Nef)
• A circulating IgG autoantibody against C3 convertase.
• It acts to stabilize C3 convertase to augment its function and
increase the consumption of C3.
• Associated with MCGN type II (dense deposit disease).
• Measure when GN is associated with a persistently low C3.
Factor H
• An alternative pathway regulatory protein.
• Genetic deﬁciency is associated with familial haemolytic uraemic
syndrome and predisposes to MCGN type II.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Diagnostic imaging: X-ray
Introduction
To select the most appropriate investigation (and maintain healthy relations with the radiology department), the requesting clinician should
understand the indications and limitations of imaging in renal disease.

Plain X-ray
• ‘KUB’ (kidneys–ureter–bladder). Essentially, a supine AXR centred on
the umbilicus.
• Main role is identiﬁcation and surveillance of calciﬁcation (see
Box 1.9). Lateral and oblique ﬁlms may differentiate calciﬁcation in line
with, as opposed to in, the renal tract.
• The medial edges of both psoas muscles are usually visible—
disappearance suggests a perinephric mass or retroperitoneal
collection.
• Tomography keeps one particular image plane in focus, blurring out
images in front and behind. Moving the plane can produce serial ‘cuts’
that detect small calculi. Now largely superseded by CT.
•  Remember the radiation exposure of an AXR is 35 x that
of a CXR.

Where are the kidneys on a plain AXR?
• Differences in attenuation between renal tissue and perinephric fat
mean that the kidneys are (just) visible.
• Usually adjacent to the upper border of the T11 through to the
lower border of L3.
• Normal renal size is 11–15cm (in adults). Kidneys appear bigger on
an AXR than on ultrasound.
• Right kidney usually shorter than the left (upper limit of variation in
length between right and left 1.5cm).

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING: X-RAY

Box 1.9 Causes of renal tract calciﬁcation
Urinary calculi
Most are radio-opaque to some degree; exceptions are pure uric acid
and xanthine stones.
Localized calciﬁcation
• Tuberculosis.
• Tumours.
Nephrocalcinosis
Medullary:
• Disturbed calcium metabolism:
• Hyperparathyroidism.
• Sarcoidosis.
• Vitamin D excess.
• Idiopathic hypercalciuria.
• Oxalosis.*
• Tubular diseases:
• Distal renal tubular acidosis.
• Bartter’s syndrome.
• Other:
• Medullary sponge kidney.
• Papillary necrosis.
Cortical:
• Trauma.
• Cortical necrosis.
• Oxalosis.*
*Causes both medullary and cortical calciﬁcation.

45

46

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Diagnostic imaging: ultrasound
Introduction
A front-line investigation in many forms of renal disease. Pros: provides
real-time two-dimensional images, non-invasive, relatively quick, and requires
little patient preparation. Cons: operator-dependent, poor pelvi-ureteric
detail, no functional information, may miss small stones and masses, and
only limited ‘snapshot’ images are usually stored for later review.

Main uses
• Document one or two kidneys.
• Diagnosis of obstruction (pelvicalyceal dilatation).
• Measurement of renal size in CKD (see Table 1.8 for causes of
abnormal renal size).
• Evaluation of renal masses (cystic vs solid).
• Screening for polycystic disease.
• Identify nephrocalcinosis and calculi.
• Evaluate bladder emptying.
• Estimate prostate size (may require a transrectal approach).
• Guide percutaneous procedures (e.g. renal biopsy, nephrostomy).
• Doppler USS can be used to evaluate arterial and venous blood ﬂow.
Widely used for transplant assessment, but role as a screening tool in
renovascular diseases uncertain (b p. 586). (See Fig. 9.1 for USS of
obstructed kidney.)

Normal appearances
•
•
•
•

Renal length 9–12cm.
Smooth outline.
Cortex >1.5cm.
Echotexture:
• Medulla darker than cortex.
• d Corticomedullary differentiation with i age and parenchymal
disease (e.g. acute GN) ( often over-reported and
over-interpreted).
• Pelvicalyceal (PC) system poorly visualized.
• Bladder examined when full. Normal bladder wall thin and hard to
delineate.

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING: ULTRASOUND

Table 1.8 Causes of abnormal renal size on imaging
Large kidneys
• Unilateral:
• Tumour.
• Cyst.
• Unilateral hydronephrosis.
• Compensatory hypertrophy.
• Bilateral:

Small kidneys
• Unilateral:
• Congenital hypoplasia.
• Renal artery stenosis.

• Small smooth kidneys:
— Chronic glomerulonephritis.
— Chronic interstitial nephritis.
— Virtually any chronic renal disorder, except diabetic nephropathy.
• Small irregular kidneys:
— Reﬂux nephropathy.
— Congenital dysplastic syndromes.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Diagnostic imaging: CT and MRI
CT
Increased availability, better image resolution, and progressively shorter
scanning times have signiﬁcantly increased the routine use of CT for the
investigation of the urinary tract (see Fig. 1.7 for CT scans).
Indications
• Characterization of a renal or perirenal mass:
• Differentiation of simple cysts from tumours (b p. 742).
• Tumour staging.
• Delineation of renal or perirenal collections and abscesses.
• Detection of renal and ureteric calculi (CT-KUB) (b p. 724).
• Trauma: deﬁnes extent of renal and associated intra-abdominal
injuries.
• Retroperitoneal disease:
• Abdominal aorta, adrenal glands, retroperitoneal masses, ﬂuid
collections, lymphadenopathy.
• Investigation of choice in retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis (b p. 739).
• Obstruction: presence, level, and aetiology (b p. 732).
• Parenchymal infection:
• Pyelonephritis may not show on USS or IVU.
• Exclude associated pyonephrosis.
• X Renovascular disease (b p. 586).

Standard renal CT with contrast
Performed for the majority of the indications.
 See Box 1.10, Contrast media (b p. 53).
CT-KUB
Performed without contrast to identify calculi.
CT-IVU
Contrast scan with sequences that focus on PC system and ureters.
Renal CT angiography (CTA)
Software reconstructs 3D images of the intra-abdominal vasculature.
Electron beam CT (EBCT)
Specialist tool for monitoring vascular, especially coronary, calciﬁcation
(b p. 242).

MRI
Indications
• Evaluation of a renal mass and tumour staging:
• In selected cases, e.g. venous invasion.
• MR urography (the MR equivalent of an IVU).

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING: CT AND MRI

• Renal insufﬁciency:
• Gadolinium is not nephrotoxic and is also safe if there has been
a previous allergic reaction to iodinated contrast. 2 However,
gadolinium has been associated with the development of
nephrogenic systemic ﬁbrosis (NSF).
• MR angiography:
• X Detection of renovascular disease (b p. 586).

Gadolinium and nephrogenic systemic ﬁbrosis
• The MR contrast agent gadolinium (Gd) has been implicated in the
development of nephrogenic systemic ﬁbrosis (NSF).
• NSF is a rare, painful, and often disabling, skin lesion that can progress
to involve internal organs (including muscle, heart, and lungs). It was
ﬁrst described in the late 1990s and only occurs in renal failure.
• The dermopathy appears scleroderma-like: erythema, plaques,
induration, and peau d’orange, with the lower legs and forearms
initially affected. Subsequent periarticular tissue involvement leads to
contractures and immobility.
• Pathology: CD34 +ve ﬁbrocyte proliferation, with dermal thickening.
Gd may be detected in the lesions. Exact pathophysiology uncertain;
however, Gd tissue deposition, with TGF-B-induced ﬁbrosis and
ﬁbrocyte collagen production, appears important.
• Gd exposure has been implicated in >95% cases:
• Free Gd is relatively water-insoluble (and highly toxic) so requires
chelation for in vivo use.
• These chelates may be ionic or non-ionic and linear or cyclical.
• Ionic and cyclic forms bind Gd more avidly, perhaps explaining
an apparent variance in risk between preparations, e.g. higher for
gadodiamide and gadopentetate.
• Gd chelates are renally excreted, so half-life is GFR-dependent.
• NSF incidence increases greatly below GFR <30mL/min.
• Most reports have been in dialysis patients.
• Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients may be at higher risk.
• Risk is probably <5% for an ESRD patient exposed to Gd.
• Prevention:
• If GFR <30mL/min (and especially GFR <15mL/min), Gd exposure
should be limited to situations where it is deemed essential.
• Avoid chelates that are more strongly associated with NSF, and
limit the administered dose.
• If already on maintenance haemodialysis, many dialyse the patient
immediately after exposure (and again at 24h). This reduces Gd
half-life, but additional evidence of beneﬁt is lacking.
• X Some advocate haemodialysis for patients with stage 5
CKD (eGFR <15mL/min), even if not already established on
maintenance RRT.
• In conﬁrmed disease, transplantation offers the best chance of
improvement.
• Cases should be reported to the International NSF Registry
(M http://www.icnfdr.org).

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Diagnostic imaging: IVU
Intravenous urography
Provides a good overview of the urinary tract, particularly the PC system and ureters. Good for detecting calculi. However, the growth of CT,
including CT urography, has seen a very signiﬁcant decline in use (see
Fig. 1.8 for IVU scan).
The procedure
• Ensure good bowel prep, NBM for 4h pre-procedure. If GFR normal, a
ﬂuid restriction of 7500mL/prior 24h assists contrast concentration (
dangerous if d GFR 6 often avoided).
• Includes (ﬁlm sequence altered, according to clinical situation):
• Plain control ﬁlm (? opacities pre-contrast).
• Post-contrast: bilateral nephrograms (delayed: poor perfusion,
obstruction, ATN, venous thrombosis), renal outline (? ischaemic
scars, reﬂux, TB).
• Further exposures at 5 and 10min (PC ﬁlling defects: clot, tumour,
sloughed papilla, stone. PC deformity: reﬂux).
• Mild abdominal compression delays contrast excretion and may
improve PC system views.
• Post-voiding ﬁlm to assess bladder outﬂow.
• Delayed ﬁlms (2, 6, 12, and 24h) may establish a level of obstruction.
Modiﬁcations
• IVU with furosemide: furosemide exaggerates and distinguishes PUJ
obstruction from normal anatomical variants (‘baggy’ pelvis).
• High-dose IVU: used if d GFR limits contrast excretion. Largely
redundant where USS and CT are available.

Metformin
There is often apprehension that continued metformin use prior to
IV contrast administration may contribute to contrast-induced AKI
(CI-AKI) (b p. 148) post-procedure.
It is important to remember that metformin is not nephrotoxic.
However, it does undergo renal excretion and may accumulate, potentially causing a severe lactic acidosis, if GFR deteriorates post-contrast.
The pre-contrast withdrawal of metformin does not reduce the risk
of CI-AKI, but, if CI-AKI develops, metformin should be stopped immediately—with glycaemic control achieved by other means until GFR
recovers.
Those with pre-existing signiﬁcant renal impairment (eGFR <30mL/
min) who are at particular risk of CI-AKI should almost certainly not
be taking metformin anyway. This can be clariﬁed with the responsible
clinician. An eGFR of 30–60mL/min is a grey area, but there is no current
recommendation to stop metformin, as long as the patient is supervised
appropriately through the contrast procedure (b p. 149).

Box 1.10 Contrast media
• Organic radio-opaque iodides excreted by glomerular ﬁltration.
• Modern non-ionic, iso-osmolar agents are better tolerated than their
ionic, hyperosmolar (71500mOsmol/kg) predecessors.
• Minor contrast reactions (urticaria, itching, nausea, vomiting,
sneezing, metallic taste) common (5–10%), especially if history
of allergy. Usually self-limiting, but antihistamines may help. Not
necessarily associated with reaction on re-challenge.
• 2 Severe reactions: d BP, shock, pulmonary oedema, bronchospasm,
and anaphylaxis. 3 Access to resus equipment is mandatory.

lower with non-ionic media.

do not guarantee non-reaction).

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Diagnostic imaging: nuclear
medicine
Introduction
Nuclear techniques provide functional, as well as structural, information
and can complement other imaging modalities. Three types:
• GFR estimation (e.g. 51Cr-EDTA ) (b p. 36).
• Dynamic (e.g. 99mTc-DTPA, 99mTc-MAG 3): serial scans track renal
uptake, transit, and excretion of an isotope. A time-activity curve is
generated.
• Static (e.g. 99mTc-DMSA): isotope is taken up and retained within
functioning tissue. Demonstrates non-functioning (‘scarred’) renal
tissue.
See Fig. 1.9 for diuretic renogram.

Radiopharmaceuticals
•

99m

Tc-DTPA. Filtered at the glomerulus and neither reabsorbed nor
secreted by the tubules. A good marker of GFR but limited utility in
more severe renal impairment (e.g. SCr >200μmol/L (72.2mg/dL)).
• 99mTc-MAG 3. Principally excreted by tubular secretion so useful if d
GFR. Less background uptake than DTPA but more expensive.
• 99mTc-DMSA. Filtered at the glomerulus, then reabsorbed and
retained in the proximal tubules. Subsequent excretion is slow. Used
for parenchymal imaging.

Applications
• Function of each kidney (termed ‘split function’) (DTPA, MAG 3, DMSA).
• Congenital abnormalities (DMSA), e.g. horseshoe kidney, ectopic
pelvic kidneys.
• Chronic pyelonephritis and vesicoureteric reﬂux (DMSA) (b p. 712):
• Focal scarring (more than one cause).
• DTPA-cystogram: reﬂux follow-up and sibling screening.
• Renal transplantation: perfusion and obstruction.
• Acute kidney injury (b p. 120).
• Dilated vs obstructed renal pelvis:
• A dilated pelvis may not indicate true obstruction.
• Diuretic renography (DTPA or MAG 3) may differentiate the two.
• Arterial occlusion (DTPA, MAG 3): failure of perfusion.
• Captopril renography in renovascular disease (b p. 586):
• In renal artery stenosis (RAS), perfusion and 6 GFR are
maintained by A2-mediated efferent arteriolar constriction. ACE-I
administration will block this and alter the uptake and excretion of
DTPA or MAG 3.
• A positive scan suggesting RAS:
— Asymmetry of size and function.
— Delayed time to peak activity.
— Cortical isotope retention.

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING: NUCLEAR MEDICINE

• Sensitivity d if bilateral disease, d GFR, or pre-existing ACE-I
therapy (stop 4–5d prior).
• Progressively superseded, as image reconstruction in CT and MR
angiography has improved.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Diagnostic imaging: angiography
and uroradiology
Renal angiography
Remains the gold standard investigation in renovascular disease, despite
increasing promise within the chasing pack.
Technique
A retrograde catheter is passed under ﬂuoroscopic guidance via a femoral
puncture. A ﬂush aortogram reveals number and location of renal arteries
before selective catheterization (intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA) is generally inadequate). Contrast nephrotoxicity (b p. 148)
is a concern, and CO2 has been used as an alternative to iodinated media.
Indications
• Renovascular disease:
• Invasive 6 not an ideal screening test (b p. 586).
• May be preferred when clinical suspicion for RAS is high, and
there is an intention to proceed immediately to angioplasty and
endovascular stenting.
• Acute renal ischaemia:
• Acute emboli or thrombosis, traumatic occlusion, dissection.
• Therapeutic intervention (e.g. thrombolysis) may be possible.
• Unexplained haematuria:
• Vascular lesions (e.g. AVM, angioma). May allow embolization.
• Classical polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) (b p. 652):
• Intrarenal microaneurysms.
• Renal transplantation:
• Evaluation of donor anatomy prior to live kidney donation
(b p. 374), although most now perform CT angiography in this
situation.
• Bleeding post-renal biopsy:
• Identify bleeding source (9 therapeutic embolization).

Uroradiology
Urethrography and cystography
• Contrast l urethra 9 bladder.
• Indications: trauma, urethral stricture, bladder diverticulae or ﬁstulae.
• CT cystography increasingly used.
Micturating cystourethrography (MCUG)
• A contrast-ﬁlled bladder and urethra are visualized during voiding.
• Gold standard for diagnosis of VUR (b p. 712).
• Demonstrates reﬂux and dilatation/distortion of the ureters and PC
system.
• Pressure-ﬂow videocystometrography involves measurement of
bladder pressures and urine ﬂow rate, in addition to imaging.

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING: ANGIOGRAPHY AND URORADIOLOGY

Retrograde ureteropyelography
• The ureteric oriﬁces are cystoscopically cannulated and contrast
injected under ﬂuoroscopic screening.
• Ureter, PUJ, and PC system can be visualized.
• May precede insertion of a retrograde ureteric stent.
Antegrade ureteropyelography (percutaneous nephrostomy)
• A needle is placed percutaneously into the renal pelvis under
ﬂuoroscopic or USS guidance.
• Contrast media is injected to evaluate PC, ureteric, and bladder
anatomy.
• Urine l culture and cytology.
• Pressure studies can be undertaken in suspected PUJ obstruction
(Whitaker test) (b p. 736).
• Indications: relief of urinary obstruction (b p. 734), dilation of ureteric
strictures, antegrade stent placement, removal of calculi.
Ileal loopography
• The loop is ﬁlled with contrast, following the introduction of a Foley
catheter.
• Upper tract dilatation is common after ileal diversion and free reﬂux
of contrast into the ureters is almost universal—if not present,
obstruction at the ureteric insertion (most common site) should be
suspected.

Cystourethroscopy, ureteroscopy, and ureterorenoscopy
• Cystourethroscopy or cystoscopy involves a visual inspection of the
inside of the urethra and bladder, using either a ﬂexible (outpatient,
no need for anaesthetic, little capacity to biopsy) or rigid (inpatient,
anaesthetic, can biopsy if necessary) cystoscope.
• Undertaken by urologists, rather than radiologists.
• Indications include:
• Investigation of micro- and macroscopic haematuria.
• Recurrent UTIs.
• Unexplained lower tract symptoms.
• Surveillance of bladder tumours.
• Flexible ureterorenoscopy involves passing a small ﬂexible ﬁbreoptic
transurethral endoscope through the bladder and as far up as the
renal pelvis.
• Rigid ureteroscopy does not generally reach this distance and
generally requires a general anaesthetic, although it does allow
biopsies to be taken.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical syndromes: proteinuria—
introduction
Protein excretion <150mg/d is normal. 730mg of this is albumin; the
rest is LMW protein, including B2 microglobulin, enzymes, and peptide
hormones. A small proportion is secreted by the renal tubules, including Tamm–Horsfall mucoprotein (uromodulin) (see Table 1.9; see also
b p. 20).

Why is abnormal proteinuria important?
• It is a marker of intrinsic renal disease, particularly glomerular injury.
• It is a risk factor for the progression of renal insufﬁciency.
• It is an independent risk factor for CV morbidity and mortality

What is the relevance of a positive dipstick for protein?
• Dipsticks predominantly detect albumin (b p. 20). They are generally
+ve if protein excretion >300mg/d.
• Dipstick proteinuria has a prevalence of around 5% in healthy
individuals (usually trace to 1+ range).
• Further evaluation is mandatory to distinguish ‘benign’ from
‘pathological’ proteinuria.

What is pathological proteinuria?
• Persistent protein excretion >150mg/d implies renal/systemic disease.
• The amount and composition depend on the nature of renal injury.
• Urinary electrophoresis can distinguish the source.
Glomerular
Failure of the glomerular barrier allows passage of intermediate and high
MW protein. The most important cause of proteinuria in clinical practice.
The predominant protein is albumin.
Tubular
LMW proteins, such as immunoglobulin light chains and B2 microglobulin,
normally pass through the glomerulus and are reabsorbed by proximal
tubular cells. Damage to the proximal tubule disrupts this cycle and results
in tubular proteinuria.  This is not detectable on dipstick examination.
Overﬂow
Overproduction of LMW plasma proteins exceeds the capacity of the normal proximal tubule to reabsorb them. Causes: (i) immunoglobulin light
chains in myeloma; (ii) lysozyme in monomyelocytic leukaemia. Dipstick
examination will be negative; speciﬁc assays are required.
Secretory proteinuria
Protein added to the urine lower in the urinary tract (e.g. bladder tumour,
prostatitis). Blood (>50mL/24h) will also cause proteinuria (but not
albuminuria).

NB Proteinuria >3g does not necessarily result in the nephrotic syndrome but is often referred
to as nephrotic range. Proteinuria with accompanying microscopic haematuria strongly suggests
glomerular disease.

When may proteinuria be ‘benign’?
Transient
• Fever.
• Exercise.
• Extreme cold.
• Seizures.
• CCF.
• Severe acute illnesses.
Persistent
• Postural (orthostatic) proteinuria:
• Normal subjects demonstrate a small i in protein excretion on
standing. Postural proteinuria is an exaggeration of this.
• Relatively common in young adults (73–5%). Rare age >30.
• Usually <1g/24h.
• Diagnose with a ‘split’ urine collection: 16h daytime and 8h
overnight collection (simpler: –ve dipstick (or uPCR) on waking,
+ve at night).
• Renal function remains normal, even after prolonged follow-up.
• Remits with time (remains in 750% cases at 10 years and <25% at
20 years).
• Possible mechanisms: (i) trivial glomerular lesion; (ii) i
circulating A2 and noradrenaline when upright li glomerular
permeability; (iii) renal vein entrapment between aorta and
superior mesenteric artery l local haemodynamic disturbance
(‘nutcracker’ syndrome—also a possible cause of microscopic
haematuria).

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical syndromes: proteinuria
What is microalbuminuria?
• The term microalbuminuria describes albuminuria above the normal
range (>30mg) but below the threshold of traditional dipsticks (<300mg).
• A misleading term, implying the albumin is of lower molecular weight.
This is not the case—the ‘micro-’ preﬁx is simply meant to reﬂect the
low amount.
• This has led to newer terminology, such as ‘moderately increased
albuminuria’ for microalbuminuria and ‘severely increased albuminuria’
for macroalbuminuria.
• It is a sensitive indicator of:
• Early renal disease.
• CV risk in DM, i BP, and several other conditions.
• It is detected by spot microalbumin/creatinine ratio, ultrasensitive
dipstick, or radioimmunoassay on a 24h urine collection (b p. 20).

Clinical consequences
Mild proteinuria does not produce clinical sequelae. When more severe
(>3–5g/d), a distinct clinical entity—the nephrotic syndrome—may result.
Heavy proteinuria may cause frothy urine (d surface tension).

The nephrotic syndrome (b p. 554)
Urine albumin loss ld serum albumin l oedema (through a variety of
mechanisms). The concomitant loss of other serum proteins l hyperlipidaemia, thrombotic tendency, i susceptibility to infection.

Selectivity of proteinuria
• This refers to size discrimination at the glomerulus.
• Highly selective l albumin and proteins of similar MW.
• Non-selective l larger proteins, including immunoglobulins.
Selectivity is calculated by comparison of IgG and albumin (or transferrin) clearance. This requires a sample of plasma and ‘spot’ urine
specimen.
Selectivity index =

serum IgG x urine Alb
urine IgG x serum Alb

x 100

≤10%, highly selective.
11–20%, moderately selective (limited discriminatory value).
≥21%, poorly selective.
• Limited clinical utility and rarely performed in practice.
• May have a limited prognostic value—non-selective proteinuria
suggests more severe injury to the glomerular apparatus.
• In children: can identify the highly selective proteinuria of minimal
change disease and potentially avoid the need for a renal biopsy.

CLINICAL SYNDROMES: PROTEINURIA

Microalbuminuria and cardiovascular risk
• Microalbuminuria (or ‘high albuminuria’) is a marker of CV risk.
• This applies to the general population, not just DM or i BP.
• The mechanisms underpinning this association are poorly
understood, but microalbuminuria, endothelial dysfunction, and
chronic inﬂammation are interrelated processes that develop and
progress together.
• Microalbuminuria can be correlated to the risk of stroke, MI, LV
dysfunction, PVD, and death, e.g. in the HOPE (Heart Outcomes
Prevention Evaluation) trial and follow up of the Framingham cohort.
• BP reduction is the key to microalbuminuria reduction—RAS
blockade with ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or both) appears to be the
treatment of choice.
• There is no present consensus on microalbuminuria screening in
non-diabetics, though screening of hypertensive patients (and other
high-risk groups) is advocated by some authorities; e.g. the American
College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA).

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical syndromes: haematuria—
introduction and classiﬁcation
Introduction
Can result from bleeding at any site in the urinary tract, from the kidney to the tip of the urethra. Causes range from benign to serious (see
Table 1.10).

Classiﬁcation
Macroscopic vs microscopic
• Macroscopic:
• Blood is visible to the naked eye. Gross haematuria startles the
patient and 6 presents early.
• The patient may not recognize blood and report discoloration
(pink, smoky, cola, or tea-like).
• 2 Macroscopic haematuria always requires investigation (presenting
complaint in 785% of bladder and 740% of renal tumours).
• Heavy bleeding with clot formation almost never occurs in
glomerular disease.
• Microscopic (b p. 66):
• Blood only visible under high-powered microscopy.
• Often detected on dipstick examination in an asymptomatic patient.
Glomerular vs non-glomerular
Provides a framework for considering pathology. Both can present with
macro- or microscopic bleeding (particularly non-glomerular haematuria).
Always assume bleeding is non-glomerular (particularly age >40) until
investigation proves otherwise. Locally agreed nephrological and urological referral and management pathways are highly desirable, particularly for
microscopic haematuria.

Clinical assessment

Clinical syndromes: haematuria
assessment
Clinical assessment
History
• How much bleeding? Is the urine discoloured or frankly bloody?
• Recent trauma? May be relatively trivial, e.g. contact sports.
• Previous episodes?
• History of stone disease?
• Relevant medications? Anticoagulants should not cause haematuria if
the INR is in the required range.
• Recent instrumentation of the urinary tract?
• Any associated urinary symptoms? Urinary infection?
• Pain?
• Sudden onset of colicky ﬂank pain suggests a stone.
• Suprapubic pain may indicate infection or clot colic.
• 2 Painless macroscopic haematuria indicates a tumour until proved
otherwise.
• What part of the stream?
• Initial haematuria suggests an anterior urethral lesion.
• Terminal haematuria usually arises from the posterior urethra,
bladder, bladder neck, or trigone.
• Continuous haematuria usually originates at, or above, the level of
the bladder.
• Cyclical haematuria in ♀ suggests endometriosis of the
urinary tract.
• Risk factors for urothelial malignancy (b p. 750)?
• Recent skin or throat infection—post-streptococcal GN.
• Episodic macroscopic haematuria with throat infections is a classical
presentation of IgA nephropathy (b p. 544).
• Recent travel? Schistosomiasis is the most common cause of
haematuria worldwide (resist the temptation to swim in Lake Malawi!).
• Systemic symptoms, e.g. arthralgia, rashes, suggestive of an underlying
inﬂammatory disorder?
• Family history of deafness (Alport’s) or other renal disease?
Physical examination (signs usually scarce)
• Haemodynamically stable?
• Anaemia.
• Bruising/bleeding s bleeding diathesis.
• Skin or throat infections (l post-infectious GN).
• Rashes, swollen joints (l inﬂammatory condition, e.g. vasculitis).
• Cardiorespiratory:
• Stigmata of endocarditis.
• i BP and oedema (l glomerular disease).

CLINICAL SYNDROMES: HAEMATURIA ASSESSMENT

• Abdomen:
• Flank tenderness (l stone disease, pyelonephritis).
• Masses.
• Bruit (l AVM).
• Prostate.
• Consider testicular examination and VE (? misinterpreted vaginal
bleeding).

Investigation of macroscopic haematuria
• Urinalysis:
•  A –ve dipstick in a patient with documented macroscopic
haematuria should not stop further investigation.
• In heavy bleeding, the dipstick often tests +ve for
protein: interpret with caution.
• Urine M,C+S: infection? Ova of Schistosoma haematobium?
• Urine cytology: malignant cells? Casts and dysmorphic red cells?
• FBC, U&E, clotting, G&S (9 cross-match when severe), PSA, Hb
electrophoresis in black patients.
• Imaging: CT, with and without contrast, is the investigation of choice.
If unavailable, USS + IVU.
• Cystoscopy (in virtually all patients):
• 9 ureterography or ureteroscopy.
• Angiography (rarely). May demonstrate a vascular lesion.

Deﬁnition
Arbitrary. >2 red cells/hpf (b p. 22) (7107 red cells/24h). However, it is
usually a +ve dipstick, not a cell count that triggers investigation (dipsticks
detect 2–5 cells/hpf).
Epidemiology
Reported prevalence varies widely (0.18–16.1%), reﬂecting differences in
the deﬁnition used and population screened (particularly with respect to
age). Common in both adults and children.
Predictive value
The proportion that has (or develop) signiﬁcant disease depends on the
group studied and thoroughness of investigation. Overall risk of malignancy (2–10%) is less than macroscopic haematuria (5–22%) but i with

tumours not involving the PC system) is generally used.
• Nephrology work-up: measure BP, FBC, U&E, eGFR; quantify

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical syndromes: microscopic
haematuria screening
See Table 1.12 for causes of isolated microscopic haematuria.

Should we screen for microscopic haematuria?
X Two-thirds of physicians include dipstick examination for haematuria
in health checks, but the beneﬁts of screening are yet to be established.
Argument for
• Dipstick examination is easy, acceptable to patients, and inexpensive.
• It may assist early diagnosis of urological malignancies (where early
intervention may be lifesaving) and intrinsic renal disease (where
intervention may delay or prevent progression to ESRD).
Argument against
• Basic criteria for screening are not fulﬁlled.
• Dipstick testing is not sufﬁciently speciﬁc, and predictive values for
both malignancy and renal disease are relatively poor.
• Beneﬁts of early detection have not been established for either.

Microscopic haematuria and the risk of ESRD
• A recent longitudinal study of 1.2 million young individuals (aged
16–25) presenting for military service in Israel* found an initial 0.3%
prevalence of persistent microscopic haematuria (with normal SCr
and proteinuria <200mg/day).
• Males were affected twice as commonly as females.
• During 21 years’ follow-up, ESRD developed in 0.7% of those with
(and 0.045% of those without) initial microscopic haematuria.
• This gave an adjusted hazard ratio of 18.5.
• The mean age of ESRD treatment was earlier (34 vs 38) in the
haematuria cohort and attributed mainly to glomerular disease.
• While the relevant advisory bodies do not presently advocate
population screening, these recent data have led to a call for
selected screening of younger patients so that they can be followed
up more closely for the development of overt renal disease.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical syndromes: CKD, AKI, and
the nephritic syndrome
Chronic kidney disease (see b Chapter 3)
The end result of any process causing renal parenchymal loss or damage. CKD implies an irreversible reduction in the number of functioning
nephrons and is characterized by a progressive inability of the kidneys to
fulﬁll their homeostatic responsibilities.  Always ensure that reversible
factors have been excluded.
Classiﬁcation
Previously termed chronic renal failure, with an arbitrary deﬁnition. The
NKF-KDOQI classiﬁcation is now almost universally used internationally
(see Table 1.13).

Patients with a GFR >60mL/min should not be considered to have CKD, unless there is
concomitant evidence of kidney damage, e.g. urinary abnormalities (proteinuria, haematuria),
structural abnormalities (e.g. abnormal imaging), genetic disease (e.g. APKD), or biopsy-proven
disease.

Older nomenclature
Uraemia (or uraemic syndrome): the constellation of symptoms and
signs produced as GFR declines (originally chosen to imply retention of
urine in the blood). A multisystem disorder with a complex pathophysiological basis (b p. 212). Correlation of Ur and SCr with symptomatology is poor, so the diagnosis is part clinical, part biochemical.
Azotaemia: a term previously popular in the USA and used to imply
retention of nitrogenous compounds. Typically refers to early CKD,
sparing uraemia for symptomatic patients. Also attempts to play down
the role of urea itself.
End-stage renal disease (ESRD): generally deﬁned as a GFR ≤5mL/min.
The initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is generally required
to maintain the patient’s continued well-being (Note: RRT does not
have to wait until the patient is symptomatically uraemic, b p. 267).

CLINICAL SYNDROMES: CKD, AKI, AND THE NEPHRITIC SYNDROME

Acute kidney injury (AKI)
(b Chapter 2.)

The nephritic syndrome (b p. 536)
Acute post-infectious GN, particularly following pharyngitis or cellulitis
with group A B-haemolytic streptococci, provides the historical prototype
for this condition and remains relatively frequent in developing countries.
Now commonly associated with a variety of other glomerular conditions
(b p. 548).
Clinical features
• Haematuria (usually microscopic).
• Proteinuria.
• i BP.
• Circulatory overload and oedema.
• Oliguria.
• d GFR.

2 Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
• The dramatic end of the nephritic spectrum, with rapid d GFR and
(usually) oligo-anuria.
• Caused by an aggressive glomerular lesion, with extensive crescent
formation (b p. 532).
• Other renal diseases can produce an identical clinical picture (e.g.
acute thrombotic microangiopathy).
• 3 Seek expert help. This is a life-threatening fulminant illness, and
recovery of renal function is rare without early treatment.

Hypertension (b Chapter 5)
The kidney has been described as both ‘villain and victim’ in i BP.
Hypertension in renal disease
• Underlying renal disease is found in a minority of patients with i BP,
although the possibility should always be considered (an abnormal
urine dipstick provides a simple clue).
• i BP may be a feature of any renal disease, although particularly
common in glomerular and vascular diseases.
• Hypertension has an extremely important bearing on the
progression of renal disease (b p. 203).
Renal disease in hypertension
• The normal kidney plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
essential hypertension (b p. 452).
• The kidney is an important site of end-organ damage caused by i BP.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical syndromes: pulmonary renal
syndromes
Introduction
The combined presentation of an acute GN with pulmonary haemorrhage
is one of the most dramatic scenarios in clinical medicine.

Causes
ANCA +ve vasculitis (b p. 640) 760% cases. Anti-GBM or Goodpasture’s
disease (b p. 656) 720%. Also SLE (b p. 658), Henoch–Schönlein purpura (b p. 650), cryoglobulinaemia (b p. 634), and rheumatoid vasculitis
(b p. 669).

History
• The ﬁrst report of a condition simultaneously affecting lungs and
kidney was presented in 1919 by Ernest Goodpasture, following
post-mortem studies during the 1918–19 inﬂuenza pandemic.
• Four decades later, the eponymous term Goodpasture’s
syndrome was adopted to describe comparable clinicopathological
presentations.
• Subsequent realization that pulmonary renal syndromes are not
a single clinical entity brought about further reﬁnements to the
nomenclature.
• Goodpasture’s disease is now reserved for lung haemorrhage and
crescentic GN in the context of anti-GBM disease (b p. 656).
• With hindsight, it is more likely that Goodpasture’s original patient
had a systemic vasculitis and not the disease that now bears
his name.

Clinical features
• Acute nephritic syndrome (rapidly progressive renal failure with an
active urinary sediment).
• Features of an underlying systemic condition may be present (e.g.
cutaneous vasculitis, sinusitis, arthritis).
• Pulmonary haemorrhage:
• Cough.
• Dyspnoea.
• Haemoptysis (extensive bleeding).
• Anaemia (and iron deﬁciency).
• Hypoxaemia and respiratory failure.
• CXR: diffuse or patchy alveolar shadowing (indistinguishable from
pulmonary oedema/ARDS).
• CT: conﬁrms air space ﬁlling.
• Lung function: i diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (KCO).
• Bronchoscopy: bloody bronchoalveolar lavage.

CLINICAL SYNDROMES: PULMONARY RENAL SYNDROMES

Other ‘pulmonary renal’ syndromes
Pulmonary haemorrhage is rare, but respiratory dysfunction and/or
radiological abnormalities are common in AKI.
• Volume overload with pulmonary oedema.
• Infection:
• AKI may accompany pneumonia and vice versa.
• A vasculitis patient receiving immunosuppressive therapy will be
at risk of opportunistic infections, including fungi, viruses, and TB.
• Hantavirus.
• Pulmonary emboli.
• Acid–base disturbances.
• Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Hantavirus
• Members of the Hantavirus family are widely distributed globally
and responsible for several clinical syndromes—often collectively
referred to as ‘haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome’.
• Puumala virus (Scandinavia, Western Europe) l milder renal
disease.
• Hantaan virus (Russia, China) and Dobrava virus (Central and
Western Europe) l more severe renal disease.
• Sin Nombre virus (North America) and Andes virus (South
America) l cardiopulmonary syndrome.
• Spread: inhalation or contact (urine, faeces) with infected
rodents (vectors include mice, voles, shrews as well as rats).
Person-to-person transmission rare.
• Infection can be associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality,
although <25% cases are severe (70.5% mortality for milder
European forms, reaching 5–10% for some others).
• Outbreaks can occur, e.g. during the Balkan war in the late 1990s.
• Clinical features:
• Fever.
• Respiratory failure (non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema).
• Systemic sepsis (and shock).
• AKI (proteinuria, haematuria, vascular endothelial damage, acute
tubulointerstitial inﬂammation).
• Diagnosis: clinical suspicion in endemic areas, serological testing,
immunohistochemistry of biopsy material (including renal).
• Management: supportive. No speciﬁc antiviral therapy is effective.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical syndromes: urine volume
and urinary tract pain
Changes in urine volume
• Polyuria: >3L/24h.
• Oliguria: <400mL/24h.
• Anuria: <100mL/24h.
Polyuria
Excretion of a urine volume in excess of normal; >3L/day is an arbitrary
cut-off. H2O excretion is tightly controlled, so daily volumes vary widely
in an individual.
It is usually frequency of micturition (especially overnight) s to the
larger volume, rather than the volume itself, that causes the patient to present (although most patients with frequency do not have polyuria). Obtain
a 24h urine collection for volume before undertaking further investigation.
Polyuria is seen in three clinically important situations (see Table 1.14):
• Excessive ﬂuid intake.
• Increased tubular solute load, e.g. hyperglycaemia.
• Failure of the renal tubules to concentrate the urine (diabetes
insipidus, b p. 789).

are analogous to those of AKI.
Anuria
Passage of <100mL/24h or the absence of urine ﬂow.
2 Address the following questions urgently if anuria:
1. Is the bladder catheter blocked?
2. Is the urinary tract obstructed?
3. Are the kidneys perfused?

CLINICAL SYNDROMES: URINE VOLUME AND URINARY TRACT PAIN

Pain
Loin pain
• Renal pain is usually experienced in the loin near the
costovertebral angle.
• Anterior radiation may cause confusion with intraperitoneal pain.
• May also radiate to the genitalia.
• Usually associated with distension of the renal capsule and described
as a constant dull ache.
• Differential: nerve root irritation (commonly T10–T12).
• 2 An aggressive and a destructive renal disease may be painless.
Ureteric colic
• Sudden onset, extremely severe (pale, distressed, unable to
settle) colic.
• Caused by a combination of ureteral stretching, local inﬂammation,
and hyperperistalsis (spasm of ureteral smooth muscle).
• Pain may not completely fade between exacerbations.
Causes
• Passage of a stone (common), blood clot, or sloughed papillae.
• Ureteral pathology that develops slowly or produces only partial
obstruction may be painless (small stone l excruciating colic; large,
non-obstructing staghorn calculus l no pain).
• Pattern of referred pain can sometimes help to determine the level of
ureteric obstruction:
• Upper ureter l loin
• Mid-ureter l ipsilateral iliac fossa (may l testicle in ♂, labium in
♀, and upper thigh in both).
• Lower ureter l bladder irritability (frequency, dysuria, urgency)
and suprapubic discomfort (may l urethra and tip of penis).

The bladder
Suprapubic pain
• Usually overdistension of the bladder (acute retention) or local
inﬂammation (cystitis).
• Cystitis: signs of bladder irritability (below) and sharp, stabbing pain
towards the end of voiding (strangury).
• Slowly progressive distension (e.g. neurogenic bladder) may cause
no pain.
• Constant suprapubic pain, unrelated to retention, may not originate
in the bladder. In ♀, consider gynaecological causes.
Bladder irritability
• Dysuria, frequency, and urgency among the commonest symptoms
encountered in clinical practice.
• Urinary infection, causing inﬂammation of the urethra, trigone, and
bladder, is (by far) the most frequent cause (b p. 706).
•  About one-third of patients with bladder cancer present with
bladder irritability.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical syndromes: tubular syndromes
Introduction
A degree of tubular dysfunction may occur with any renal injury (though
the clinical picture is usually dominated by d GFR). Several distinct clinical
syndromes result from tubular defects in the context of a normal GFR.

Generalized tubular dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome)
Multiple tubular defects produce a distinct clinical phenotype referred to
as the Fanconi syndrome (unrelated to Fanconi’s anaemia). Components
may be present to a variable degree.
Causes
• Acquired: drugs (aminoglycosides, sodium valproate, ifosfamide,
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) and toxins (ethanol,
cadmium, uranium, lead, mercury), myeloma, SLE, Sjögren’s. Mild forms
of the syndrome are more common than was previously thought.
• Inherited: cystinosis, tyrosinaemia, fructose intolerance, galactosaemia,
glycogen storage disorder type I, cytochrome c oxidase deﬁciency (all
autosomal recessive). There is also an autosomal dominant idiopathic
form of Fanconi syndrome. Dent’s disease and Lowe syndrome are
X-linked Fanconi-like disorders.
Features
• Phosphaturia and bone disease:
• Impaired PO4 reabsorption l phosphaturia l hypophosphataemia.
• This, and impaired 1A hydroxylation (activation) of
25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in proximal tubular cells, produces skeletal
abnormalities, including rickets (children), osteomalacia (adults),
and osteoporosis.
• Aminoaciduria:
• Amino acids are usually ﬁltered at the glomerulus before
reabsorption by multiple transport carriers in the proximal tubule.
• Fanconi syndrome l all amino acids appear in the urine in excess.
• No clinically signiﬁcant sequelae and supplementation unnecessary.
• Glycosuria:
• Amount varies but serum glucose usually normal.
• Clinical sequelae are rare, though hypoglycaemia occurs in some
forms (e.g. Fanconi–Bickel syndrome/glycogenosis).
• Renal tubular acidosis (RTA):
• Defective bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule results
in systemic acidosis (a form of type II RTA, b p. 824).
• Na+ loss:
• If severe l postural d BP, d Na+, and metabolic alkalosis result.
• Salt supplementation occasionally necessary.
• Hypokalaemia:
• i delivery of Na+ to the distal tubule l Na+ reabsorption at the
expense of K+ excretion.

CLINICAL SYNDROMES: TUBULAR SYNDROMES

• Acidosis and RAS activation by volume depletion also l K+ loss.
• Clinical sequelae common (muscle weakness, constipation, polyuria,
cardiac arrhythmias) and supplementation often required.
• Proteinuria:
• LMW proteinuria is common (B2 microglobulin, lysozyme,
and other tubular proteins), though excretion rates are usually
low–moderate.
• Polyuria:
• Polyuria, polydipsia, and dehydration can be prominent.
• Caused by d K+ and impaired concentrating ability in the distal
tubule.
• Hypercalciuria:
• Rarely l nephrolithiasis/calcinosis (? protective effect of polyuria),
although these may be precipitated by treatment with vitamin D
metabolites (further i urinary Ca2+).
• Serum Ca2+ usually normal.

Isolated tubular defects
Renal glycosuria
• d proximal tubular glucose reabsorption l glycosuria (despite
normal blood glucose).
• Clearance studies allow differentiation into different patterns
implicating several defective tubular transport mechanisms.
• The amount can be quite signiﬁcant (normally 1–30g/24h) but
generally a benign condition with no clinical sequelae.
•  Always needs to be distinguished from DM.
• Genetic mechanisms involved but inheritance unpredictable.
Aminoaciduria
• Causes:
• Inborn error of metabolism li plasma levels and ‘overﬂow’.
• Renal aminoaciduria secondary to defective tubular transport
mechanisms.
• Amino acid transport is complex, involving transporters speciﬁc
to single or chemically related groups of amino acids.
• The most important isolated aminoaciduria is cystinuria, an autosomal
recessive cause of recurrent cystine stone formation (b p. 719).
Phosphaturia
• Defective phosphate transport l phosphaturia, hypophosphataemia,
and disorders of the skeleton.
• Several described, including X-linked hypophosphataemic
rickets (vitamin D-resistant rickets) and autosomal dominant
hypophosphataemic rickets.
• FGF-23 excess, causing inhibition of phosphate reabsorption, is now
known to underpin many of these disorders (b p. 236).

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Clinical syndromes: bladder outﬂow
obstruction
Introduction
• Main causes are shown in Box 1.11. The likelihood of each is
inﬂuenced by age and sex. Presentation is with:
• Acute retention of urine.
• Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).
• LUTS are divided into two groups. Symptoms correlate poorly with
underlying urinary pathology, so it is best to remain as descriptive as
possible (see Table 1.15).
•  Bladder outﬂow obstruction (BOO) can be clinically silent in
some patients, despite signiﬁcant residual bladder urine volumes and
eventually progressive urinary obstruction.
Table 1.15 Symptoms of bladder outﬂow obstruction
Obstructive (voiding) symptoms
Impaired size or force of stream
Hesitancy or straining
Intermittent or interrupted ﬂow
Sensation of incomplete emptying
*

Storage (ﬁlling) symptoms*
Nocturia
Daytime frequency
Urgency
Urge incontinence
Dysuria

Also called irritative.

‘Prostatism’ is no longer preferred to describe outﬂow symptoms
(age-matched ♀ report similar symptoms).

Examination
Palpate for bladder enlargement; rectal examination, pelvic examination in
♀; examine the legs neurologically, and test anal tone/sensation.

Investigations
• Urine M,C+S, U&E, and PSA (in males >40 years, b p. 772).
• Imaging. Bladder USS to measure residual volume post-micturition
(correlation to outﬂow obstruction is poor).
• Uroﬂowmetry. Full bladder emptied into a ﬂow meter to generate
a ﬂow curve (rate vs time). Normal max ﬂow >20mL/s. Further
urodynamic assessment will distinguish non-obstructive causes of low
ﬂow (e.g. detrusor failure).
• Pressure-ﬂow studies (cystometrography). More sensitive and speciﬁc but
invasive. Bladder and rectal catheters record ﬁlling and voiding bladder
pressures (normograms relate pressure to ﬂow).
• Videocystometrography. Fluoroscopic screening of the ureters, bladder,
and urethra. Useful in the investigation of neurological bladder
dysfunction.
• Retrograde urethrography. ? urethral stricture.

CLINICAL SYNDROMES: BLADDER OUTFLOW OBSTRUCTION

Box 1.11 Causes of bladder outﬂow obstruction
• Congenital:
• Urethral valves and strictures.
• Structural:
• Benign prostatic hyperplasia (b p. 758).
• Carcinoma of the prostate (b p. 766).
• Bladder neck stenosis.
• Urethral stricture.
• Functional:
• Bladder neck dyssynergia.
• Neurological disease—spinal cord lesions, MS, diabetes.
• Drugs—anticholinergics, antidepressants.

Prostatic enlargement (b p. 758)
• Prostate size correlates poorly with degree of obstruction on
urodynamic assessment.
• Impaired ﬂow is a function of two separate components:
• Dynamic: i sympathetic tone of prostatic smooth muscle.
• Static: mass effect of enlargement.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Renal biopsy: introduction
Despite improvements in other diagnostic techniques, renal biopsy and
examination of histology retain pivotal roles in nephrology.
Renal transplant biopsy is considered separately (b p. 407).

Indications (b p. 82)
•
•
•
•

Unexplained acute or chronic kidney disease with normal renal size.
Histology is likely to inﬂuence treatment.
Histology is likely to offer prognostic information.
Information concerning the activity (and potential reversibility) and/or
chronicity of a previously identiﬁed lesion is desirable.

Preparation for renal biopsy
•  Renal biopsy is an invasive procedure. An evaluation of the
risk-beneﬁt ratio is required in every case.
• Imaging: conﬁrm two normal-sized, unobstructed kidneys with
normal parenchyma.
• BP <160/90mmHg; preferably <140/90mmHg.
• Hb ideally >100g/L.
• Normal clotting (PT and APTT <1.2 x control). Platelet count
>100 x 109/L.
• Send group and save.
• Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants stopped >5 days prior to
procedure. Ideally, do not restart for 7 days post-biopsy.
• Sterile urine.
• Informed consent. Give appropriate written or visual patient
information.
• If renal impairment, the risk of bleeding increases 72–3-fold.
• Most units will have their own policy, e.g. if urea ≥20mmol/L (55mg/
dL) or SCr ≥250μmol/L (2.8mg/dL) or bleeding time >10min, give
DDAVP 0.4 micrograms/kg IV 2–4h pre-biopsy ( not if recent or
ongoing angina).

Contraindications
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Uncorrected bleeding tendency (absolute contraindication).
Chronic kidney disease with small kidneys.
Multiple cysts.
Suspected renal malignancy (b p. 743).
Hydronephrosis.
Active urinary infection.
Uncontrolled hypertension (>160/95mmHg).
Hypotension.
Signiﬁcant anaemia.
Uncooperative patient.
Solitary kidney (only a relative contraindication).

RENAL BIOPSY: INTRODUCTION

Technique
• Performed percutaneously under LA via a posterior approach.
• Sedation is generally avoided, as patient cooperation is essential.
• Patient lies prone, with a pillow under the abdomen to straighten
the spine.
• USS locates the kidneys, determines their size, and identiﬁes cysts.
• Either kidney may be biopsied.
• A lower pole biopsy reduces the risk of piercing a major vessel.
• USS is used to directly guide the needle to the kidney ‘real time’.
• LA is inﬁltrated down to the renal capsule, using a spinal needle.
• Non-real-time techniques, after the kidneys have been marked on
the surface, also remain in use.
• CT guidance is an alternative when USS visualization is inadequate.
• Disposable TruCut® needles or spring-loaded biopsy guns are generally
used (e.g. 16-gauge; larger needles may i complication rate). An initial
stab incision at the skin can ease passage of the needle. The patient is
required to hold their breath when the needle enters the kidney.
• Where possible, two cores of tissue are obtained to increase
diagnostic yield. Avoid >4 passes with the biopsy needle. Call for a
more experienced operator after two unsuccessful passes.
• Routine processing includes light, immunoﬂuorescence (or immunohistochemistry), and EM. Biopsy material is divided, as different ﬁxatives
are required for the different techniques, e.g. glutaraldehyde for EM.
• Patient remains on bed rest, with a good ﬂuid intake for 6–8h. Pulse
and BP are monitored regularly and urine inspected for haematuria.
• The patient is advised not to undertake heavy lifting or strenuous
exercise for 4 weeks.
• Day case biopsy is now common.  These should be deemed low
risk, as complications actually occur after 6–8h in 71/3 cases.
• High risk 6 not for day case: SCr >200μmol/L (2.2mg/dL), BP
>140/90mmHg, small renal sizes (b p. 84).
Open renal biopsy
• May be considered if the percutaneous approach carries an
unacceptable risk or has been unsuccessful.
• Allows direct visualization of the kidney and easier control of bleeding.
• More tissue can potentially be obtained.
• The risk of a GA may actually exceed that of a percutaneous biopsy.
• Laparoscopic techniques have been described.
Transvenous renal biopsy
• An endovascular technique developed in hepatology and not widely
available. The kidney is approached via a transjugular or transfemoral
route. Usually performed by interventional radiologists.
• The renal capsule is not punctured, and the risk of perinephric
bleeding is reduced.
• High success rates demonstrated (i.e. renal tissue obtained), but
complication rates appear similar.
• Potential uses: morbid obesity, comatose patient, uncorrected
coagulopathy, failed percutaneous approach.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Renal biopsy: indications
Clinical syndromes: when to biopsy?
2 There is no such thing as a ‘routine’ renal biopsy.
X Microscopic haematuria (b p. 66)
• Practice varies, but most do not biopsy, unless there is associated
proteinuria and/or renal impairment (either at presentation or
during the course of follow-up). Isolated microscopic haematuria
generally has an excellent prognosis, and histology will not inﬂuence
management.
• Possible exceptions: suspected systemic condition (e.g. SLE, vasculitis),
potential live kidney donors, or for insurance or employment reasons.
Proteinuria
X Non-nephrotic proteinuria (<3.5g/24h)
• Many recommend a biopsy at modest levels of proteinuria to ensure
potentially treatable lesions, e.g. primary FSGS and membranous GN,
are not overlooked.
• Others argue that the benign prognosis of these conditions, when
urinary protein excretion is low, means that a biopsy is unnecessary.
• Some clinicians use an arbitrary ‘cut-off ’ level of proteinuria to guide
their decision-making (e.g. biopsy if >1g/24h—uPCR >100mg/mmol),
particularly if treatment with an ACE-I or ARB does not reduce the
proteinuria below this threshold (b p. 61).
• The presence of renal insufﬁciency weighs in favour of a biopsy.
Nephrotic range proteinuria
• A biopsy is generally recommended. Two exceptions:
• Minimal change disease in childhood. In this situation, an initial trial
of steroids may be appropriate.
• Diabetic nephropathy (b p. 611).
Acute nephritic syndrome
The need to conﬁrm diagnosis and adapt treatment, according to the type
and severity of the renal lesion, mandates a biopsy in the majority of cases,
even when the diagnosis is suggested by serological tests (e.g. anti-GBM
disease or ANCA +ve vasculitis).
Acute kidney injury (b p. 121)
• Unexplained AKI, particularly with an active urinary sediment (i.e.
possible RPGN), or AKI that does not behave as expected, e.g. failing
to recover.
Chronic kidney disease
The most important determinants of the appropriateness of a biopsy are:
• Renal size. If <9cm, a biopsy is technically more demanding and
histology is more likely to show chronic, non-speciﬁc, irreversible
change (with the original insult not identiﬁable).
• Clinical context. A high pre-test probability may circumvent the need to
obtain histology, e.g. diabetic nephropathy.

RENAL BIOPSY: INDICATIONS

• Degree of proteinuria. A treatable glomerular lesion is less likely if
urinary protein excretion is low (e.g. <1g/24h or uPCR <100mg/
mmol).
Systemic disease potentially involving the kidney
• Immunological or serological testing (b p. 40) may provide important
diagnostic clues (e.g. ANCA +ve vasculitis, anti-GBM disease), but
renal biopsy will conﬁrm the diagnosis and assess the degree of activity
and potential reversibility. This aids decision-making around the type
and duration of treatment.
• This is particularly true of lupus nephritis where classiﬁcation of the
renal lesion is a cornerstone of management.
• In some conditions, demonstrable renal involvement may be an
important determinant of the need for systemic treatment, e.g.
myeloma.
• Other important systemic conditions that often precipitate a renal
biopsy include sarcoidosis and amyloidosis.

CHAPTER 1

Clinical assessment

Renal biopsy: complications
Introduction
In general, percutaneous kidney biopsy is a safe procedure, and serious
complications are uncommon. However, less serious sequelae, such as
pain and mild bleeding, are relatively common, so it is important to explain
the potential for these to the patient pre-procedure.

Higher risk1
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Uncorrected bleeding tendency (3 do not biopsy).
i BP (>130mmHg systolic).
d GFR, especially if SCr >177mmol/L (2.0mg/dL).
Small renal sizes (<10cm).
Hb <120g/L.
Older age (>40).
Use of larger (e.g. 14-gauge) biopsy needle.

Complications
• Pain:
• Dull ache around the needle entry point and tract is almost
universal once LA effect wears off.
• Simple analgesia is often necessary.
• Severe pain raises the possibility of a signiﬁcant perirenal bleed and
should prompt assessment to determine the extent of the problem
(as well as additional analgesia).
• Pain is usually short-lived but may be persistent >12h in <5%,
meriting further investigation for a haematoma.
• Bleeding:
• Bleeding is the main complication of renal biopsy.
• Three potential sites:
• Collecting system (l haematuria).
• Within the renal capsule (l pain).
• Perinephric space (l haematoma).
• A degree of capsular or perirenal bleeding accompanies almost
every renal biopsy.
• A Hb drop ≤10g/L is common.
• Asymptomatic haematomas can be detected on USS in up to 30%
patients.
• A larger capsular haematoma (pain, signiﬁcant drop in Hb) occurs
in 72%.
• A large capsular haematoma may tamponade and compress the
kidney, causing high renin hypertension (known as a ‘page’ kidney).
• Transient microscopic haematuria is present in virtually all patients.
• Macroscopic haematuria in 73.5%.
• Gross haematuria may cause painful clot colic 9 ureteral
obstruction.
• Transfusion required in 71%.
• Endovascular intervention to control bleeding in 0.6%.
• Nephrectomy to control bleeding in 0.01%.

RENAL BIOPSY: COMPLICATIONS

• Arteriovenous ﬁstula:
• 718% on Doppler but rarely symptomatic; may cause persistent
haematuria and (rarely) hypertension.
• Most resolve spontaneously within 12–24 months.
• Embolization may be an option in those that remain symptomatic.
• Incorrect tissue obtained:
• Usually muscle, fat, liver, spleen.
• Colonic perforation.
• Perirenal infection (0.2%).
• Peritoneal-calyceal ﬁstula.
• Death (0.02%).

•

Seek expert help.
Bed rest.
Regular pulse, BP, and O2 saturations (every 15min).
Ensure adequate IV access and commence ﬂuid resuscitation as
necessary.
Reassure the patient, and ensure adequate analgesia.
Check Hb, and repeat after 2, 4, 8, and 12h as a minimum.
Cross-match at least 2 units of blood, and transfuse as necessary.
Repeat clotting studies post-biopsy. Correct coagulopathies.
Maintain a high urine ﬂow with IV ﬂuids to prevent ureteral
obstruction and clot colic.
Consider a 3-way urethral catheter for irrigation if clot retention and
bladder outﬂow obstruction.
Inform surgical team.
Do not move the patient for imaging until they are stabilized. An
ultrasound is unlikely to be of value beyond the identiﬁcation of a
haematoma. A contrast CT may identify ongoing active bleeding, but
the patient’s clinical status may already imply this.
If severe or persistent, consider arteriography to localize source of
bleeding 9 embolization to stop it.
Surgical intervention may allow control of the bleeding point, but an
emergency nephrectomy may be necessary.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Deﬁnition
Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) (formerly acute renal failure) is the syndrome
arising from a rapid fall in GFR (over hours to days). It is characterized by
retention of both nitrogenous (including Ur and Cr) and non-nitrogenous
waste products of metabolism, as well as disordered electrolyte, acid–
base, and ﬂuid homeostasis.
22 There is evidence that even relatively small acute reductions in
kidney function are associated with poorer outcomes, including increased
mortality, higher risk of long-term dialysis, and longer hospital stay.

Historical limitations
• Despite a relative insensitivity to acute changes in GFR, most
deﬁnitions of acute renal dysfunction have been based on serum
Cr, either as an absolute value or as a change from baseline. Other
deﬁnitions have incorporated urine output (UO) or the need for
dialysis support.
• A 2004 survey of 598 participants at a critical care nephrology
conference revealed 199 different criteria to deﬁne AKI and 90 for the
initiation of renal replacement therapy.1
• This lack of consensus had implications for collection and comparison
of epidemiological data, and consistency of clinical practice.

The RIFLE criteria for AKI
• In response, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative established a
multilayered deﬁnition of AKI called the RIFLE criteria.
• AKI is stratiﬁed into ﬁve stages, based on severity and duration of
renal injury: Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage disease (see
Table 2.1).
• Many studies (>0.5 million patients) have validated these criteria.
• RIFLE-deﬁned AKI is associated with signiﬁcantly reduced survival
(with increasing RIFLE stage leading to greater risk of death).

Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) classiﬁcation
• More recently, AKIN (an international network of AKI experts)
modiﬁed RIFLE to incorporate small changes in SCr occurring within
a 48h period and to remove changes in GFR as diagnostic criteria (see
Table 2.1).

KDIGO AKI deﬁnition (2012)
• AKI, classiﬁed by either of the earlier listed criteria, may
identify slightly different patients: RIFLE may not detect 710% of
AKIN-identiﬁed cases, and AKIN may miss 725% RIFLE cases.
• KDIGO have recently produced a deﬁnition that incorporates the key
elements of both, and it is likely that this deﬁnition will become the
accepted standard.

DEFINITION

Key elements of KDIGO AKI deﬁnition

• Increase in SCr by ≥26.5μmol/L (≥0.3mg/dL) within 48h.
• Increase in SCr by ≥1.5x baseline (known or presumed to have
occurred within prior 7d).
• Urine volume <0.5mL/kg/h for 6h.

(Only one criterion needs to be present to fulﬁll the deﬁnition.)

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Acute kidney disease (AKD)
• Strict adherence to deﬁnitions of both acute (AKI) and chronic
(CKD) renal disease may miss individuals with functional or
structural abnormalities present for <3 months but who may beneﬁt
from active intervention to restore kidney function (6 avoiding
permanent damage and adverse outcomes).
• For this reason, KDIGO have proposed the term AKD to include
not only those with AKI, but also those with GFR <60mL/min/1.73m2
for <3 months or a decrease in GFR by ≥35% or an increase in SCr
by >50% for <3 months.

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Epidemiology
Incidence
Depends on the population studied and the deﬁnition used, meaning few
studies historically have been able to provide accurate incidence data.
However, the more recent use of AKIN/RIFLE criteria has improved this. It
remains important to recognize the limitations imposed by the use of SCr
and urine output for the detection of AKI. It is hoped that, in the future,
sensitive biomarkers of renal cell injury will improve earlier identiﬁcation.

• 5–10% of general admissions.
• 20–25% of patients with sepsis and 750% with septic shock.
• 50% of all ITU admissions (where it acts as an independent risk factor
for mortality of 20–60%, depending on AKI stage).
Community
• KDIGO estimate a worldwide AKI prevalence of 72,100 pmp, the
majority of which are community-acquired.
• The burden of AKI may be highest in developing countries.
• Community-based studies in the UK (SCr >300μmol/L or 3.4mg/dL)
estimate 486–620 pmp. This is age- and comorbidity-related (17 pmp
aged <50 and 949 pmp aged 80–89).
• Restricting the evaluation to changes in SCr, particularly large changes,
will miss many cases.
• Individuals with CKD are at increased risk of AKI (and AKI is a risk
factor for progression of CKD).
• Incidence of dialysis-dependent AKI: 7200 pmp annually.

Prognosis
2 There is increasing evidence for the adverse outcomes associated with
AKI (even after apparent resolution), including longer hospital length
of stay, signiﬁcant complication rates (including infection), risk of CKD
(including ESRD), development of CV disease, and higher mortality.
Mortality
• Outcomes for the new AKIN criteria by stage are shown in Table 2.2.
• Prompt improvement (<24h) in renal, cardiovascular, or respiratory
function is associated with a better chance of survival.
• Outcomes for patients with sepsis in an ICU setting are linked to
timely AKI resolution (2 indicating a therapeutic window where
outcomes for these patients may be improved).
• Despite improvements in many aspects of clinical care (particularly
nutrition and renal replacement therapy), overall mortality in AKI
requiring RRT remains >50% (reﬂecting a high incidence in the elderly
and those with multi-organ failure).
• The underlying cause will play a role, e.g. lower for nephrotoxin-driven
AKI (<30%) vs higher for sepsis- and trauma-related AKI (760%).

Renal recovery
Recovery of renal function will depend on underlying diagnosis. For ATN,
750% will have some degree of residual renal impairment. This will be
irreversible, dialysis-dependent renal failure in 75% (710% in the elderly).
The risk of worsening or de novo CKD and death following an episode
of AKI (even if function appears to return to normal) is high.2 The future
healthcare impact of this is currently uncertain but could be signiﬁcant, as
more patients survive to hospital discharge following serious illness.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Biomarkers of AKI
Introduction
Driven by the recognition that even relatively small increases in SCr were
associated with a poor outcome and increased healthcare costs, the 2005
American Society of Nephrology Renal Research Report assigned the
highest research priority to the discovery of new biomarkers of AKI and
their validation in different patient populations and clinical settings.
SCr is a suboptimal biomarker of AKI. i SCr is delayed, making it insensitive for early diagnosis (l missed therapeutic opportunities). It is also
unable to differentiate pre-renal AKI from ATN.
Novel biomarkers include: (i) LMW proteins that undergo glomerular
ﬁltration prior to reabsorption in the proximal tubule (damaged tubules
li urinary excretion); (ii) enzymes that are released into the urine after
tubular cell injury (l markers of tubular damage); and (iii) inﬂammatory
mediators released by renal cells or inﬁltrating inﬂammatory cells
(l markers of site and degree of injury) (see Fig. 2.1).

Use in clinical practice
The ideal biomarker should provide additional information not available
from clinical evaluation and traditional tests. The main problem to date is
that studies have been performed either in deﬁned clinical settings (where
the timing of the renal insult is understood, e.g. after cardiopulmonary
bypass, coronary angiography, or following renal transplantation) or in
children (where there are no confounding comorbidities, such as CKD,
diabetes mellitus, and chronic inﬂammatory disease). As a result, currently
available data cannot necessarily be generalized to more heterogeneous
populations, such as critically ill patients in ICU. However, it is hoped
that ongoing studies will demonstrate the utility of novel biomarkers to
improve recognition, management, and outcomes for AKI.

Putative biomarkers under study
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)
A 25kDa glycoprotein produced by epithelial tissues in several organs.
Excreted via glomerular ﬁltration and completely reabsorbed by tubular
cells. Also produced in distal tubular cells (renal ischaemia li NGAL
expression). Appears to be anti-apoptotic and to upregulate heme
oxygenase-1. Urinary NGAL is sensitive and speciﬁc for early ATN (no
i in pre-renal AKI). Rises 2–4h post-AKI; common confounders: sepsis,
malignancy, CKD, COPD, pancreatitis. Clinical utility now tested in many
scenarios, including cardiac surgery and contrast toxicity. Plasma NGAL
may also help to predict likelihood of renal recovery.
Cystatin C
A 13kDa cysteine protease inhibitor produced by all nucleated human cells
and released into plasma at a constant rate (b p. 36). Freely ﬁltered in
glomeruli and completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Detectable
in urine 12–24h after renal injury. Results confounded by systemic inﬂammation, malignancy, thyroid disorders, smoking, glucocorticoid deﬁciency
and excess.

BIOMARKERS OF AKI

Interleukin-18
An 18kDa proinﬂammatory cytokine. Released from proximal tubular
cells. Rises 6–24h after renal injury. Confounders: inﬂammation, sepsis,
cardiac failure.
Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1)
A transmembrane glycoprotein, produced by proximal tubular cells after
ischaemic or nephrotoxic injury (it sheds an extracellular domain that can
be measured in urine). No systemic source. Rises 12–24h after renal injury.
Confounders: renal cell carcinoma, adult polycystic kidney disease, chronic
proteinuria.
N-acetyl-B-D-glucosaminidase (NAG)
A lysosomal enzyme (>130kDa), produced in many cells, including proximal and distal tubular cells. Detectable in urine 12h after tubular injury.
Retinol-binding protein (RBP)
A 21kDa single-chain glycoprotein. Undergoes glomerular ﬁltration before
reabsorption by proximal tubular cells. Detectable in urine within 12h.
Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP)
A 14 kDa intracellular lipid chaperone, produced in various organs as well
as proximal tubular cells. Freely ﬁltered by glomeruli and reabsorbed in
proximal tubular cells. Detectable in urine within 1h, i.e. soon after injury.
A glutathione S-transferase (A GST) and η glutathione S-transferase
47–51kDa cytoplasmic enzymes, produced in distal tubular cells. Urinary
levels increase within 12h.
Other promising biomarkers
Urinary insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) are both markers of cell cycle
arrest. Several microRNAs (ribonucleotides that regulate gene expression) are upregulated during AKI, e.g. miR-210. Proteomic proﬁling and
other techniques have identiﬁed many other candidates, including the
Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3), perforin, granzyme B, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1.
It is hoped that combining biomarkers into an ‘AKI panel’ will further
improve sensitivity and clinical utility.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Causes and classiﬁcation
Introduction
• It is crucial to remember that AKI is neither a diagnosis nor a
disease. Rather, it is a clinical syndrome that is caused by, or
complicates, a wide range of disorders. (See Fig. 2.2)
• The introduction of the new nomenclature has propagated
a tendency for AKI to be conceptualized as a ‘standard’ or
homogenous disorder.
• While this may have beneﬁts, clinical practice must always reﬂect
the heterogeneity and complexity of the syndrome and its context.
• The goals are to: (i) identify patients earlier—when simple
interventions may make an important difference to outcome; (ii)
consider the multiple possible causes of renal injury; (iii) anticipate
complications before they arise.
Three dependable clinical syndromes can be used to help categorize AKI
and 6 to direct diagnosis and therapy.

Pre-renal AKI
• d renal blood ﬂow (RBF) ld GFR.
• d RBF may be s to hypovolaemia per se, d effective RBF (d cardiac
output, vasodilatation in sepsis), or intrarenal vasomotor changes (e.g.
NSAIDs and ACE-I).
• Potentially reversed by restoration of RBF.
• Kidneys remain structurally normal.

Intrinsic renal AKI
• The renal parenchyma itself sustains damage through injury to the
renal vasculature, glomerular apparatus, or tubulointerstitium.
• The commonest cause (by far) is acute tubular necrosis (ATN), itself
the end-product of an ischaemic or a nephrotoxic injury (b p. 106).
• The diagnosis of ATN implies:
• Glomerular, vascular, and other interstitial diseases are not
responsible for AKI. Be cautious; these disorders often require
speciﬁc treatment, and a delay in their diagnosis can have signiﬁcant
consequences for long-term kidney function. They may also coexist
with ATN. 2 Seek expert help if you are uncertain.
• Recovery of renal function should occur if supportive measures are
adequate (so make sure that they are adequate).
• A potentially reversible phase has passed during which ATN may
have been avoided.

Post-renal AKI
•
•
•
•

The kidneys produce urine, but there is obstruction to its ﬂow.
i back pressure ld tubular function.
Obstruction may occur at any level in the urinary tract.
AKI results when both kidneys are obstructed or when there is
obstruction of a solitary kidney.
• Obstruction eventually causes structural (and 6 permanent) damage.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Prevention of AKI
3 Many cases of AKI can be prevented or reversed at an early stage.

Who is at risk?
• i age.
• Pre-existing CKD:
• i SCr, d eGFR, or proteinuria.
• Surgery (esp. if with another risk factor):
• Trauma and burns surgery (hypovolaemia, sepsis, myoglobinuria).
• Cardiac surgery (poor LV function, intra-operative haemodynamic
instability, cardiopulmonary bypass, use of aprotinin).
• Vascular surgery (e.g. suprarenal aortic cross-clamping) and
endoluminal intervention (e.g. an endovascular stent occludes
a renal artery oriﬁce) can disturb renal perfusion 9 cause
atheromatous emboli to kidneys). Pre or intra-operative contrast
administration. Risk of emergency AAA repairs > elective (25% vs
<5% AKI).
• Hepatic and biliary surgery (over 70% of hepatic transplants
complicated by AKI); biliary surgery also high risk.
• Diabetes mellitus (esp. if established diabetic nephropathy with
d eGFR).
• Volume depletion (NBM, bowel obstruction, vomiting, burns).
• LV dysfunction and other cardiac disease.
• Other causes of d effective arterial volume (cirrhosis).
• Drugs that cause renal vasomotor changes (NSAIDs, ACE-I, ARB).
• Hyperbilirubinaemia and frank jaundice.
• Multiple myeloma (X may just be that these patients are often
dehydrated, with a degree of renal insufﬁciency to start with).
Precipitation of casts with tubular injury is the concern (b p. 622).

Common nephrotoxins (see b p. 898)
The kidneys are particularly susceptible to nephrotoxic injury because of
their rich blood supply and a propensity to concentrate toxic substances
within their cortex.
• NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors).
• Diuretics, ACE-I, ARB (esp. in volume-depleted patients).
• Antimicrobials: aminoglycosides, vancomycin, amphotericin (lipid
preparation is ONLY 750% less nephrotoxic and may still cause AKI).
• Immunosuppressants (e.g. ciclosporin, tacrolimus) and
chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. cisplatin).
• IV contrast (b p. 148).
Using nephrotoxic drugs
1 Recognizing the potential for nephrotoxicity is the critical step:
• Is it a deﬁnite indication?
• Is there a therapeutic alternative?
• Have all precautions to d toxicity been undertaken (e.g. hydration)?
• Have you arranged for renal function to be monitored closely?
• Is therapeutic drug monitoring necessary (e.g. gentamicin/vancomycin)?

PREVENTION OF AKI

Reducing AKI risk perioperatively
Three principles
1. Avoid dehydration.
2. Avoid nephrotoxins (1 contrast, NSAIDs, aminoglycosides).
3. Review clinical (esp. volume) status and renal function if at risk.
• Optimize volume status preoperatively:
• No patient should ever go to theatre dehydrated.
• Review daily weights, chart input/output; check postural heart
rate and BP.
• Calculate losses, esp. in patients NBM.
• 1 CVP: intermittent measurement does not correspond
to volume status in many studies. Seek expert help prior to
undertaking.
• IV ﬂuid replacement l use balanced crystalloid solutions unless
hyperkalaemic and/or anuric (seek expert help if present)
(GIFTASUP guidelines).1
• Optimize blood sugar control in diabetics (l sliding scale).
• Optimize nutrition (with par/enteral nutrition, if indicated).
• Consider bladder catheter for those with prostatic disease.
• Avoid surgery, if possible, immediately after a contrast procedure.
• Stop antihypertensives (esp. diuretics, ACE-I/ARB) for 24–48h, as BP
allows.
• Find out how the procedure and patient progressed in theatre.
Check intraoperative records for blood loss and ﬂuid and drugs
administered.
• Review the patient early post-op. Consider need for level 2 and
3 care.
• There is no role for dopamine, furosemide, or other diuretics in the
prevention of perioperative AKI.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

STOP AKI checklist
The London AKI network (LAKIN) is a regional collaborative that aims to
collate available evidence, clinical standards, and national guidelines into
accessible practical advice and well-deﬁned clinical pathways.
The guidelines are designed for those managing AKI in general ward
areas and aims to facilitate the interaction between general wards, local
critical care teams, and regional kidney unit services. (See Fig. 2.3)

LAKIN advocates the following STOP (Sepsis; Toxicity; Obstruction;
Parenchymal disease) checklist to help improve awareness of the
causes of AKI.
• Sepsis and hypotension:
• Severe sepsis.
• Haemorrhage.
• Dehydration.
• Cardiac failure.
• Liver failure.
• Renovascular insult.
• Toxicity:
• Nephrotoxic drugs.
• Iodinated radiological contrast.
• Obstruction:
• Bladder outﬂow.
• Stones.
• Tumour.
• Surgical ligation of ureters.
• Extrinsic compression (lymph nodes).
• Retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis.
• Parenchymal kidney disease:
• Glomerulonephritis.
• Tubulointerstitial nephritis.
• Rhabdomyolysis.
• Haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
• Myeloma.
• Malignant hypertension.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Pre-renal AKI
Any cause of apparent volume depletion may compromise renal perfusion,
as d RBF ld GFR. The kidneys are structurally intact but functionally compromised. As a general rule, the metabolically susceptible proximal tubule
can withstand relative underperfusion (and hypoxia) for a period of days
(as many as 5) before true cellular injury supervenes (ATN). (See Fig. 2.4
for algorithm detailing sequence of events.)

Hypoperfusion
Hypoperfusion is not the same as volume depletion. Renal perfusion is
a product of effective circulating volume, cardiac output, and peripheral
vascular resistance.
1 Any cause of a fall in effective arterial blood volume (b p. 104) can
cause pre-renal AKI, regardless of the hydration status of the patient:
• Hypovolaemia.
• Cardiogenic shock (or cardiac failure).
• Systemic vasodilatation (as in sepsis).

Physiological response to hypoperfusion
Systemic response
Systemic hypoperfusion is sensed as a d in arterial BP by carotid and arteriolar baroreceptors. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) as well as i vasopressin (ADH) release act in concert to maintain BP and preserve blood ﬂow
to vital organs. This is accomplished by:
• Vasoconstriction in ‘dispensable’ vascular beds (e.g. cutaneous).
• i cardiac output and heart rate.
• i thirst and d sweating.
• i renal conservation of salt and water.
Renal response (renal autoregulation)
GFR is initially maintained because intraglomerular pressure is preserved
despite the fall in systemic BP through renal autoregulation. This is
dependent on the balance between dilatation of the pre-glomerular afferent arteriole (l prostaglandins and NO) and constriction of the efferent
post-glomerular arteriole (l mainly angiotensin II).
If perfusion continues to fall, pre-renal AKI will result. As RBF drops, so
glomerular ﬁltration and urine output fall as well. Below a mean arterial
pressure (MAP) of 780mmHg, GFR d rapidly. However, lesser degrees of
hypotension may provoke pre-renal AKI in susceptible individuals:
• The elderly.
• Pre-existing afferent arteriolar pathology (e.g. hypertensive
nephrosclerosis or diabetic nephropathy).
• ACE-I or ARB therapy where constriction of the efferent arteriole is
blocked.
• Patients on NSAIDS with afferent arteriolar constriction.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Causes of pre-renal AKI
Hypovolaemia
Any cause of d intravascular volume.
• ECF depletion (usually both Na+ and H2O depletion—when losses are
predominantly H2O, ECF volume is usually preserved until late).
• Inadequate ﬂuid intake: limited access to ﬂuid (children, elderly
patients with poor mobility, endurance sports), NBM, inadequate IV
ﬂuids (everyone on a drip is at risk).
• GI losses: D&V, NG drainage, GI bleeding.
• Renal losses: diuretic therapy, uncontrolled DM (osmotic diuresis),
salt-losing nephropathy (rare—b p. 583), post-relief of urinary
obstruction, diabetes insipidus.
• Skin losses: excessive sweating, febrile patients, burns.
• Haemorrhage:
• Trauma, surgery (and surgical drains), GI bleeding.
• ‘Third space’ compartmental losses*:
• Intestinal obstruction, peritonitis, pancreatitis, major fractures.

Impaired cardiac output
• Cardiac pump failure ld BP ld RBF.
• Ischaemic heart disease l angina or MI.
• Dysrhythmias (incl. uncontrolled AF).
• New or established LV dysfunction (incl. myocarditis and
cardiomyopathy of any cause).
• Pericardial disease: 1 tamponade.
• In CCF, the ECF volume may be normal or i (with oedema and
ascites), but the kidneys respond as though it were inadequate
(d ‘effective circulating volume’). See b p. 102 and p. 778.

Peripheral vasodilatation
• The pathophysiology of septic shock is complex but causes failure of
peripheral circulatory control (b p. 166).
• Interactions between intraglomerular vaso-dilating and—constricting
mediators resulting from sepsis also contribute to d GFR.

Intrarenal vasomotor changes
• NSAIDs impede prostaglandin-mediated afferent arteriolar dilatation.
2 Post-op patient prescribed NSAIDs.
• ACE-I and ARB oppose angiotensin II-induced efferent arteriolar
constriction. 2 Dehydrated elderly patient still taking an ACE-I.
• Contrast administration (b p. 148).
• Renovascular disease (b p. 586).
*
‘Third space’ was originally coined to refer to a ﬂuid compartment that is not in equilibrium
with the ECF.

CAUSES OF INTRINSIC RENAL AKI

Causes of intrinsic renal AKI
Encompasses all causes of AKI in which the renal parenchyma has been
damaged. 2 ATN accounts for 80–90% of all intrinsic AKI.

• Contrast nephrotoxicity (b p. 148).
• Tumour lysis or acute urate nephropathy (b p. 160).
• Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (b p. 106):
• May complicate prolonged pre-renal AKI or accompany any of the
disorders listed here.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
ATN is, by far, the most commonly encountered cause of intrinsic AKI. It
is widely seen in hospitalized patients and is predictable in high-risk clinical
scenarios (so it is often preventable).
The diagnosis implies that pre-renal and post-renal factors have been
excluded (or corrected) and that other causes of intrinsic AKI, such as
vasculitis or TIN, are deemed unlikely. It also suggests that recovery of
renal function can be achieved—but only if the causative insult is removed
and adequate supportive measures are put in place. (See Box 2.1.)

Box 2.1 ATN subdivided by cause

Presentation
• ATN presents as AKI: d GFR l uraemia and disordered salt, water,
and electrolyte homeostasis.
• 2 ATN may be oliguric or non-oliguric.
• It represents a continuum from pre-renal failure but with
progression to:
• Actual structural injury to the renal parenchyma.
• Limited (or no) immediate resolution upon restoration of renal
perfusion.
• Differentiation between pre-renal AKI and ATN can be difﬁcult.
• Helpful features include (not uniformly present):
• Clear evidence of sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxin exposure.
• Bland urine on dipstick (or minor proteinuria).
• Urine biochemistry (often not helpful and rarely performed in
practice, b p. 116).

ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS (ATN)

Histology
2 A kidney biopsy is rarely necessary for diagnosis.
ATN is a misnomer—frankly necrotic tubular cells are uncommon.
Acute tubular injury (ATI) is an increasingly popular alternative term.
There may be few histological changes, even with marked functional
renal impairment. Typical features: tubular cell ﬂattening, wide spacing of tubules s to interstitial oedema, tubular cell vacuolation, loss of
proximal tubular cell brush border, tubular cell sloughing into the lumen
(l obstruction), mitotic ﬁgures in regenerating epithelial cells 9 and
leucocyte inﬁltration. Glomeruli are normal. (See Fig. 2.6)

and redistribution of integrins and sodium/potassium ATPase to the apical surface.
Cell death, resulting from necrosis and apoptosis, causes cell shedding and
luminal obstruction. Reproduced with permission from Schrier RW et al. (2004).
Neuroscience, 129, 897–904.

Prognosis
• AKI s ATN imparts a signiﬁcant in-hospital mortality (b p. 92).
• The renal prognosis:
• 50% will be left with some degree of renal impairment.
• 5–10% will eventually require long-term renal replacement therapy.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Pathophysiology of ATN
(See Fig. 2.7)

Vessels and endothelium
• Blood ﬂow is not uniform within the kidney—pO2 falls progressively
from cortex (6.65–13.3kPa) to medulla (1.3–2.9kPa) despite higher
metabolic activity in the latter. 2 The proximal tubular S3 segment and
the medullary thick ascending loop of Henle are found in the medulla.
• Any cause of d RBF or endothelial injury may d delivered O2,
rendering vulnerable segments of the nephron relatively hypoxic.
• As a result of endothelial cell injury:
• i afferent arteriolar cytosolic Ca2+li sensitivity to vasoconstrictor

Organ cross-talk in ischaemic AKI
Distant organ dysfunction has long been recognized as part of the AKI
syndrome. Mechanisms underpinning this apparent systemic proinﬂammatory state include altered expression of cellular adhesion molecules,
abnormal lymphocyte trafﬁcking, cytokine and chemokine release, and
the dysregulation of immune responses.
• Heart: LV dysfunction associated with myocyte apoptosis, neutrophil
inﬁltration, and i local cytokine expression (TNF-A, IL-1, ICAM-1).
• Lung: acute lung injury (2 high mortality) with i microvascular
permeability resulting from various proinﬂammatory and
pro-apoptotic pathways (l downregulation of alveolar epithelial
transporters, e.g. ENaC and aquaporins).
• Liver: inﬂammation, hepatocyte apoptosis, lipid peroxidation,
decreased antioxidant activity l tissue injury.
• CNS: confusion and encephalopathy. Neutrophil recruitment and
several mediators (e.g. G-CSF and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein) have
been implicated in neuronal injury.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI: recognition
Introduction
There is a lot to get to grips with in a patient with AKI. It occurs in the
context of a wide range of underlying conditions, and the patient can be
anywhere on a clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to critically unwell.
You are not alone, however. 2 Consult locally agreed AKI protocols;
seek specialist help early, and make use of helpful aids, such as the free
smartphone app designed by London AKI network (LAKIN), or internet
resources, e.g. M http://www.londonAKI.net/clinical.

Recognize the problem
Patients may be asymptomatic during the early stages of AKI, despite
nearly non-functioning kidneys, and may be very unwell by the time the
diagnosis is apparent (2 emphasizing why it is so important to be familiar
with high-risk patients and high-risk situations (b p. 98)).
Presenting features of AKI
Usually
• i Ur and i SCr.
• d UO (UO <400mL/d is frequent (750%) but not invariable).
Frequently
• Volume depletion OR
• Volume overload l pulmonary oedema.
• Hyperkalaemia (l arrhythmias or cardiac arrest).
• Non-speciﬁcally sick, often deteriorating, patient.
Rarely
• Uraemic symptoms (b p. 213).
2 Check renal function and K+ in all acutely unwell patients, esp. if:
• Falling or low UO, or anuria.
• Persistent nausea and vomiting, or prolonged NBM.
• Drowsiness or impaired conscious level.
• Signs of systemic sepsis.
• Hypertension or hypotension, particularly if severe.
• Pulmonary 9 peripheral oedema.
• Puzzling ECG abnormalities (2 T wave changes and conduction
delays).
• Metabolic acidosis.

AKI: RECOGNITION

AKI or CKD?
Patients are often found to have i SCr or d eGFR 9 oliguria at the
time of their presentation, with unrelated medical or surgical conditions. Differentiating true AKI from stable (long-standing) CKD, or even
an acute deterioration of pre-existing renal impairment, is clearly very
important.
Much has traditionally been made of the ability to distinguish the
two after initial clinical assessment and blood tests. However, many of
these features—even if present—are, at best, suggestive and, at worst,
misleading.
The only two consistently useful discriminators are:
1. Previous measurements of renal function:
• Where might this be documented? Can the patient remember
previous blood tests?
• Previous hospital admissions?
• Search your pathology system, and pull hospital notes.
• Ask the patient's GP to check their records.
2. Ultrasound:
• Long-standing renal disease leads to loss of renal parenchyma and
d renal size.
• Small (< 9–10cm length), echo bright, often cystic kidneys are
characteristic of CKD.
2 Normal-sized kidneys should arouse suspicion of AKI. A common
exception is diabetic nephropathy (b p. 604).
Lab ﬁndings suggesting AKI, rather than CKD
These are rarely as helpful as textbooks imply. Err on the side of caution
(i.e. assume AKI until proven otherwise).
• Anaemia might suggest chronic undersynthesis of erythropoietin by
scarred kidneys: a normal Hb 6 argues against CKD, but anaemia
occurs in both AKI and CKD.
• d Ca2+ and i PO4 suggest established CKD-MBD (b p. 232). Not
so: disturbances of mineral metabolism can occur rapidly in AKI.
• In many situations, particularly when renal size is normal, a kidney
biopsy may be necessary to determine the nature of the renal lesion
and the extent of reversibility (b p. 121).

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI: priorities
Make the patient safe
Evaluate as for any critically unwell patient: airway, breathing, and circulation. The standard priorities of resuscitation initially override thoughts
regarding underlying cause. 2 Does the patient require urgent level 2 or
3 care?
Two additional speciﬁc questions must be addressed urgently:
• 2 How high is the K+?
• 2 What is the volume status?
Hyperkalaemia (b p. 130) and pulmonary oedema (b p. 134) may prove
rapidly lethal, if untreated. 3 Call for expert help.
Care bundles and protocols, such as that provided by LAKIN (see
Fig. 2.8), provide a helpful framework for prioritizing management.

Look for a reversible cause
Once the patient is stabilized, consider the following questions, as they
may identify situations where relatively straightforward interventions can
have a signiﬁcant impact.
• Is it pre-renal (b p. 114)?
• Is the patient septic?
• Are there predisposing factors in the history?
• Carefully assess the patient's volume and haemodynamic status.
• Is invasive monitoring needed? Involve your critical care team if it is.
• Is it post-renal (b p. 115)?
• Are there predisposing factors in the history?
• Is there a palpable bladder or signiﬁcant urinary tract symptoms?
• What does the urine look like—any haematuria?
• Arrange an urgent USS.
• What is on the drug chart (b p. 7)?
• Stop all nephrotoxins, if possible.
• Has any radiocontrast been administered?
• Have you dipsticked the urine (b p. 116)?
• 2 Do it now—you may forget later.

AKI: PRIORITIES

AKI care bundle
Institute in all patients with a 1.5 × rise in creatinine or oliguria
(0.5 mL/kg/h) for >6 hours

This is a medical emergency

Full set of physiological observations
Assess for signs of shock/hypoperfusion
If MEWS triggering, give oxygen, begin resuscitation,
and contact critical care outreach team
Fluid therapy in AKI
Assess heart rate, blood pressure, jugular venous pressure,
capillary refill (should be <3 s), conscious level.
If hypovolaemic, give bolus fluids (e.g. 250–500 mL) until volume replete with regular review
of response. Middle grade review if >2 litres filling in oliguria.
If the patient is euvolaemic, give maintenenance fluids (estimated output plus 500 mL)
and set daily fluid target.
Monitoring in AKI
Do arterial blood gas and lactate if venous bicarbonate is low or evidence of severe sepsis or
hypoperfusion. Consider insertion of urinary catheter and measurement of hourly urine volumes.
Measure urea, creatinine, bone, other electrolytes, and venous bicarbonate at least daily while
creatinine rising. Measure daily weights, keep a fluid chart, and perform a minimum of 4-hourly
observations. Perform regular fluid assessments and check for signs of uraemia.
Investigation of AKI
Investigate the cause of all AKI unless multi-organ failure or obvious precipitant Urine dipstick.
If proteinuria is present, perform urgent spot urine protein creatinine ratio (PCR).
USS should be performed within 24 hours unless AKI cause is obvious or AKI is recovering or
within 6 hours if obstruction with infection (pyonephrosis) is suspected. Check liver function
(hepatorenal), CRP, and CK (rhabdomyolysis). If platelets low, do blood film/LDH/Bili/retics
(HUS/TTP). If PCR high, consider urgent Bence–Jones protein and serum free light chains.
Supportive AKI care
Treat sepsis—in severe sepsis, intravenous antibiotics should be administered within 1 hour of
recognition. Stop NSAID/ACE/ARB/metformin/K-sparing diuretics, and review all drug dosages.
Give proton pump inhibitor and perform dietetic assessment. Stop antihypertensives if relative
hypotension. If hypovolaemic, consider stopping diuretics. Avoid radiological contrast if possible.
If given, follow prophylaxis protocol.
Causes Think ‘STOP AKI’
Sepsis and hypoperfusion, Toxicity (drugs/contrast), Obstruction, Parenchymal kidney disease (acute GN)

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Assessing AKI: clinical clues
Pre-renal AKI
History (b p. 104)
• Any cause of d intravascular volume?
• Inadequate ﬂuid intake, haemorrhage, GI losses, renal losses, skin
losses, third-space losses.
• Any cause of cardiac pump failure?
• Any evidence for sepsis?
Clinical examination (b p. 12)
• Assessment of volume status is fundamental to diagnosis:
• BP: check lying and standing, if possible.
• Heart rate: check lying and standing, if possible.
• Peripheral perfusion:
— Warm with bounding pulse l vasodilatation (? sepsis).
— Cold and shut down with d capillary reﬁll l volume
depletion or low cardiac output.
• d JVP: hypovolaemia or vasodilatation (may be i with pump failure).
• Peripheral and pulmonary oedema.
• Urine output.
Poor signs of volume depletion
• Dry mucous membranes (most sick patients mouth-breathe).
• d skin turgor (better sign in children).

Classically
1. Volume depletion (hypovolaemic or haemorrhagic shock):
• (Postural) hypotension.
• May be peripherally shut down.
• JVP d.
2. Poor cardiac output (cardiogenic shock):
• Hypotension with narrow pulse pressure.
• Peripherally shut down (often very).
• JVP i.
3. Systemic vasodilatation (septic shock):
• Hypotension with i pulse pressure.
• Peripherally warm.
• JVP d.

Intrinsic renal AKI
Large renal vessels
History
• Cardiovascular:
• CV risk: smoking, diabetes, lipids, i BP, age.
• CV disease: claudication and PVD, stroke, IHD.
• CV intervention: invasive/endovascular radiological procedures,
vascular surgery.

ASSESSING AKI: CLINICAL CLUES

• Source of emboli: AF, prosthetic valve, cardiomyopathy, thrombophilia
tendency.
• Nephrotic syndrome: renal vein thrombosis (b p. 590).
Examination
AF, missing pulses, dilated heart, bruits, aortic aneurysm, ischaemic toes,
i BP (though very non-speciﬁc), oedema (? nephrotic).
Small renal vessels and glomeruli
History
No other cause evident; recent infection, particularly skin or throat
(post-streptococcal GN); symptoms suggesting a deep-seated infection
(fevers, night sweats); known systemic disorder, e.g. SLE, scleroderma,
vasculitis; symptoms suggesting an underlying connective tissue disorder
or vasculitis (b p. 5).
Examination
Rash, i BP, oedema, synovitis, arthropathy, uveitis, mouth ulcers, epistaxis,
hearing loss, stigmata of endocarditis, evidence of scleroderma or other
connective tissue disorder, abnormal respiratory ﬁndings (pulmonary-renal
syndrome).
Investigations
Urinalysis (b p. 116), abnormality in immunological/serological testing
(‘renal’ or ‘nephritic/myeloma’ screen) (b p. 119), and renal biopsy may
be required (b p. 121).
Tubulointerstitium
History
Drugs (b p. 7); systemic infection: many are associated, including TB
(b p. 698). Systemic diseases: myeloma, sarcoidosis, Sjögren's syndrome,
SLE, uveitis (tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome
(b p. 581)).
Examination
Fever or rash, easy bruising in multiple myeloma.
Investigations
Eosinophiluria on urine microscopy/cytology, eosinophilia in peripheral
blood (neither are universal).
Post-renal (b p. 730)
History
LUTS, prostate disease, urothelial cancer, stones, pain, haematuria.
Examination
Palpable bladder? Visible haematuria?
Investigation
Early urinary tract imaging (usually USS) is essential.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Assessing AKI: urinalysis
2 The only excuse for not performing a urine dipstick is if a patient is
completely anuric!
Urinalysis ﬁndings can point to a diagnosis, particularly for glomerulonephritis and other intrinsic renal lesions (see Fig. 2.9).
• Perform a dipstick (yourself), and document the result.
• If there is signiﬁcant blood and protein on dipstick: (i) exclude
a UTI; (ii) consider an immunological/serological screen (‘renal’
or ‘nephritic/myeloma’ screen, b p. 119). 2 Seek expert help.
Note: 1 blood will often be present post-catheterization.
• Send an MSU for microscopy and culture.
• uPCR or uACR if signiﬁcant dipstick protein.

Urine biochemistry
Included here for completeness only. While still beloved of postgraduate
examiners, urine biochemistry is of limited value in everyday practice. (See
Table 2.3.)
In pre-renal AKI, tubular function is intact with avid salt retention,
whereas, in established ATN, the resorptive and concentrating capacity of
the kidney is lost. Urinary biochemical indices can 6 differentiate the two.
• ‘Typical’ pre-renal AKI: d u-Na+, i Ur, i SCr in the urine;
u-osmolality high.
• ‘Typical’ ATN: i u-Na+, d Ur and d SCr in the urine; u-osmolality
relatively low.
1 Problems
• Not sufﬁciently sensitive or speciﬁc. Rarely inﬂuences management.
• Diuretics confound the analysis (l dilute urine with i Na+ content).
• There are exceptions that biochemically appear pre-renal but are
not: hepatorenal syndrome, contrast nephropathy, early obstruction,
acute GN, and vasculitis.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Assessing AKI: blood tests
Managing AKI requires regular and informed testing. Order investigations
sensibly and cumulatively—do not just request everything listed here.

Haematology
• FBC:
• d Hb develops early, typically 80–100g/L. 1 Haemolysis, GI bleeding.
• i WCC: infection (rarely tissue infarction or vasculitis). Eosinophilia
is a rare feature of TIN and cholesterol emboli. d WCC: severe
sepsis (rarely SLE).
• d plt: DIC or thrombotic microangiopathy (l check clotting and
ask for a blood ﬁlm). i plt: inﬂammatory disorder, e.g. vasculitis.
• Pancytopenia: ? marrow inﬁltration (? myeloma or other malignancy).
• Clotting:
• ? Liver disease (i INR) or DIC (i PT, i APTT, i D-dimers).
• Group and save if anaemic.
• i ESR with any inﬂammatory condition but esp. myeloma and SLE.
• Blood ﬁlm if d plts or ? microangiopathy:
• Fragmented red cells. If found, send LDH, haptoglobins,
reticulocyte count.

Biochemistry
• U&E:
• i plasma Ur:Cr ratio may indicate pre-renal AKI (but see b p. 37).
• i K+. 3 Needed urgently.
• Na+ usually normal; d Na+ occurs if volume overload or diuretics.
• d venous HCO3–l metabolic acidosis (if normal with normal O2
saturation, then ABG may not be necessary).
• LFTs:
• d albumin may imply proteinuria and GN.
• ? i bilirubin, ? hepatorenal syndrome (b p. 156)?
paracetamol overdose.
• 1i transaminases may be of muscle origin l check the CK.
• Ca2+ and PO4 :
• i Ca2+ is a cause of AKI (? myeloma, sarcoidosis, malignancy).
• d Ca2+ and i PO4 are present in most cases.
• CRP for infection or inﬂammation. Procalcitonin if available.
• Creatine kinase (CK) if rhabdomyolysis likely.
• Urate if tumour lysis or pre-eclampsia possible.
• Lactate to assess tissue ischaemia or underperfusion.

Microbiology
Culture urine and blood if any clinical suspicion of sepsis.

Arterial blood gas
ABG and lactate are necessary if venous HCO3– is low (or unavailable) or
there is evidence of sepsis, hypotension, or clinical deterioration.

Minimum AKI panel
• Urine dipstick.
• FBC, U&E, Ca2+, phosphate, albumin, LFT, CK, and CRP.
• Venous HCO3– or ABG.

ASSESSING AKI: BLOOD TESTS

Immunological/serological testing (the ‘renal’ or
‘nephritic/myeloma’ screen)
(Some) of these may be needed if intrinsic AKI (besides ATN) is suspected (e.g. active urine 9 systemic symptoms). However, common
sense is required. There is no role for the reﬂex ordering of these in the
majority of AKI (costly and require careful clinical correlation).
Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)
The serological hallmark of many autoimmune diseases. Further deﬁned
by speciﬁc target antigens. Where clinical suspicion is strong, the speciﬁc
assay may be necessary despite a negative ANA (b p. 42). 1 False +ve
ANAs are common.
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)
Autoantibodies directed against components of neutrophil cytoplasm,
characteristic of small vessel vasculitis (b p. 642). Two patterns:
• Cytoplasmic (cANCA): antigen usually proteinase 3 (PR3).
• Perinuclear (pANCA): antigen usually myeloperoxidase (MPO).
Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM)
Highly sensitive and speciﬁc for anti-GBM disease (b p. 656).
Anti-streptolysin O titres (ASOT)
Post-streptococcal GN is the historical prototype for the acute nephritic
syndrome, though incidence is falling (b p. 548). Sensitive for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis but less so for skin infections.
Protein electrophoresis (serum and urine)
Plasma cell dyscrasias: serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), serum free light chains (SFLC).
Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM)
Diffuse increase in vasculitis, SLE (and other connective tissue disorders), and HIV infection. Immune paresis in myeloma.
Rheumatoid factor (RhF)
May be +ve in RA associated vasculitis (b p. 669) or cryoglobulinaemia
(b p. 634).
Viral serology
Hep B is associated with PAN (b p. 652), hepatitis C with mixed
essential cryoglobulinaemia (b p. 686). HIV may present in many ways
involving the kidney. 2 It is desirable to know the viral status prior to
haemodialysis.
Cryoglobulins (b p. 634)
Consider if unexplained rash, peripheral neuropathy, hypocomplementaemia, known hep C, known lymphoproliferative disorder, or +ve
RhF (a useful screening test). The sample needs to be transported at
37°C, so bleed the patient and transport the sample yourself (in a water
bath—an armpit is 2nd best) within minutes. Warn the lab it is coming.
Antiphospholipid antibodies
Associated with the primary antiphospholipid syndrome (b p. 664).
Liaise with your haemostasis laboratory.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Assessing AKI: imaging
CXR
3 Perform a CXR (urgently if tachypnoea, d O2 sats, haemoptysis, suspected infection, or signiﬁcant associated primary lung disease).
The key ﬁndings are pulmonary oedema, respiratory infection, and pulmonary haemorrhage (all l air space shadowing that may look identical).
However, additional useful information may be gathered:
• Cardiac contour—? LVH consistent with long-standing i BP,
? pericardial effusion.
• Hilar lymphadenopathy, lytic lesions.

Renal ultrasound
3 Perform an USS of the renal tract as soon as possible (within hours if
suspected pyonephrosis).
Imaging rarely makes a speciﬁc diagnosis but has two principal aims:
• To exclude obstruction (b p. 732).
• To conﬁrm the presence of two kidneys and measure renal length.
Renal length is used as a surrogate for the time course of renal
impairment. Long-standing CKD l parenchymal scarring, loss of renal
volume and length.
• >10–11cm = normal (6 probable AKI).
• <8–9cm (9 acquired cysts) suggests CKD.

Isotope studies in AKI
• Certainly not ﬁrst-line but (very) occasionally helpful:
• Acute loss of renal perfusion associated with renal artery
occlusion or embolism can be diagnosed with nuclear renography
(e.g. MAG 3 scan).
• Cortical necrosis (after severe haemorrhagic shock, particularly
post-partum) will be demonstrated.
• AKI accompanying early vascular complications in the immediate
post-transplantation setting can be evaluated.
• In experienced hands, recovery from ATN can be assessed,
though it is rarely clinically useful.
• In partial obstruction, delayed transit in the ureteric phase can be
helpful.

ASSESSING AKI: HISTOLOGY

Assessing AKI: histology
Role of the renal biopsy in AKI (see also b p. 82)
Required in a minority of cases only. Consider once pre- and post-renal
factors have been addressed and where ‘non-ATN’ intrinsic AKI is suspected. In ATN, the prognosis for renal recovery is generally good, and
histological veriﬁcation will not alter management.
The principal aims of biopsy are to:
• Establish a tissue diagnosis.
• Assess prognosis (is renal function salvageable?).
• Guide therapy.
Potential indications
• Unexplained AKI (initial work-up unhelpful/equivocal).
• Suspected glomerular disease:
• Haematuria 9 casts, signiﬁcant proteinuria, marked i BP
(1 control BP ﬁrst).
• Serological or other evidence of systemic disease:
• For example, ANCA, ANA, anti-GBM, paraprotein.
• Suspected thrombotic microangiopathy (HSP/TTP).
• Presumed ATN persists (e.g. >2 weeks, esp. if dialysis-dependent).
• Pre-existing glomerular disease.
• Suspected TIN/drug allergy.
• Suspected atheroembolic disease.

• Tried to ﬁnd any historical tests of renal function?
• Checked serum Ca2+ and PO49 written up a phosphate binder?
• Checked acid–base status and intervened appropriately?
• Arranged for the patient to be nursed in a sufﬁciently high
dependency environment, with strict monitoring of ﬂuid intake and
output?
• Spoken to your dietitian?
• Discussed the patient with your local renal unit if needs be?
• If intrinsic AKI is suspected, sent off a nephritic and myeloma screen?

AKI MANAGEMENT: A CHECKLIST

Questions you will be asked when referring to a renal unit
• What’s the story?
• What’s the potassium?
• What’s the patient’s volume and haemodynamic status? Are they
dehydrated, overloaded, or about right? How do you know?
• Is there anything else of note on clinical examination?
• What’s the patient’s acid–base status?
• What drugs has the patient been on?
• What did the urine dipstick show?
• Has the patient had a renal ultrasound?
• Is the patient passing urine? How much?
• Do you have any record of a previous eGFR/serum creatinine?
• What comorbidity does the patient have?
• Is the patient ﬁt for transfer? Are you sure (see Fig. 2.10 below)?
See Fig. 2.10 for LAKIN guidelines on transferring to a renal unit.

Transfer from ward to kidney unit
(interhospital transfer)

The following is a guideline for whether patients are safe to transfer from
a ward to a kidney unit in another hospital.
All AKI 3 patients or patients with complications should also be assessed as safe for
transfer by a middle grade doctor and, if necessary, by the home critical care team
Hyperkalaemia
No ECG changes.
K<6.0mmol/L.
If K lowered to <6.0 after presentation this must be potentially sustained (e.g bicarbonate therapy or
dialysis/CVVH) not transient therapy (insulin and dextrose).
Renal acidosis
pH >7.2.
Venous bicarbonate >12mmol/L.
Lactate <4mmol/L.
Respiratory
Respiratory rate >11 and <26/min.
Oxygen saturations >94% on not more than 35% oxygen.
If patient required acute CPAP must have been independent of this treatment for 24 hrs.
Circulatory
Heart rate >50/min and <120/min.
Blood pressure >100mmHg systolic.
MAP >65mmHg.
Lactate <4mmol/L.
(Lower BP values may be accepted if it has been firmly established these are pre-morbid.)
Neurological
Alert on AVPU score or GCS >12.

If criteria not met, emergency referral to local critical care
Once stabilized follow ITU to acute kidney unit transfer policy.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI management: volume
replacement—which ﬂuid?
Prompt ﬂuid resuscitation reverses pre-renal AKI. However, there is
increasing evidence that ﬂuid overload is harmful and 6 needs to be
avoided. 2 The key to achieving euvolaemia is repeated clinical assessment of a patient's volume status.

Which ﬂuid?
Crystalloids
See Table 2.4 for composition of cystalloids.
Isotonic saline
0.9% isotonic remains the benchmark against which other solutions are
measured. However, despite its other pseudonyms, it is neither ‘normal’ nor ‘physiological’. In fact, there is evidence that it may be harmful.
Excessive use of saline can result in hyperchloraemic acidosis. X Although
the morbidity associated with this condition is probably low (isotonic
saline has been in use for 50 years), it has informed a move towards the
use of balanced solutions.
Balanced crystalloids
Refer to solutions with an electrolyte composition closer to plasma. The
2009 British consensus guidelines on intravenous ﬂuid therapy for adult
surgical patients recommended the use of balanced crystalloids over
saline. Furthermore, the recent UK AKI consensus statement includes the
recommendation that balanced crystalloids are used, unless patients are
hypochloraemic or hyperkalaemic (balanced crystalloid solutions, such as
Hartmann’s and Ringer’s solutions, contain 5mmol/L K+ and must be used
with caution). X Critics of such guidelines say that, while the move to
balanced crystalloids is unlikely to cause harm, beneﬁts are likely to be
marginal only.
Hypotonic crystalloids
0.45% (‘half normal’) saline and 5% glucose distribute rapidly throughout
total body water and are of limited use for the restoration of intravascular
volume. Avoid unless true water depletion (hypernatraemia, b p. 788).
Sodium bicarbonate
‘Weak’ NaHCO3 solutions (e.g. 1.26% or 1.4%) can be useful in
volume-depleted, acidotic (pH <7.15) 9 hyperkalaemic patients (b p. 131).
Use with crystalloid, e.g. in a ratio of 1L NaHCO3 to every 2–3L of NaCl.
1 Avoid stronger (4.2% or 8.4%) solutions, and monitor for d Ca2+.

Synthetic colloids
Solutions contain oncotically active ingredients (e.g. hydroxyethyl starch
or gelatin) that remain in the intravascular compartment and pull in
extravascular water. Effective volume expanders, but evidence suggests
that starch-containing solutions may worsen AKI. Examples include
Gelofusine® and Haemaccel®—both gelatin-based. The use of ≥1000–
1500mL may deplete clotting factors and i bleeding risk. Severe allergic
reactions have been reported to all types of colloid.
2 The recent UK consensus statement on AKI and guidelines from the
European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recommends that colloid
(including gelatin-based) solutions be avoided.
Human albumin solutions
‘Physiological colloid’. Expensive. Although a Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that its use was associated with i mortality in the critically ill, the
more recent (and well-designed) SAFE study suggested equivalence with
saline (and beneﬁt in the subgroup of patients with sepsis). Many favour its
use when volume depletion occurs in the context of hypoalbuminaemia.
Proven beneﬁt also in AKI in the context of cirrhosis with spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis (b p. 158). The results of the Albumin in Severe
Sepsis and Septic Shock (ALBIOS) study, in which patients with severe
sepsis were randomized to either albumin or crystalloid for resuscitation,
will be available in 2013.
• Isotonic (4–5%). Usually 100–500mL bottles. Used to restore
circulatory volume.
• Concentrated (20–25%). Usually 50–100mL bottles. Used to expand
circulatory volume when general salt and water restriction is desirable,
i.e. an oedematous, hypoalbuminaemic patient who is intravascularly
depleted (e.g. nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis).

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI management: volume
replacement—how much?
See Figs 2.11 and 2.12 for guidelines on ﬂuid therapy and AKI complications, respectively.

How much ﬂuid?
The volume required to restore euvolaemia is the volume that improves
clinical signs of ﬂuid depletion. These include:
• Reducing tachycardia.
• Improved peripheral perfusion.
• Rising BP (2 check for postural drop, if possible). If d BP, despite
apparently adequate ﬁlling, consider cardiogenic or septic shock.
• Visible JVP.
• Improving UO.
1 Beware volume overload: i P, i BP, i RR, basal lung crackles, d O2 sats.

How quickly?
Resuscitation
See b p. 168 for initial management of severe sepsis and sepsis-induced
shock. In other situations, the aim is to infuse ﬂuids (9 blood products)
rapidly to restore BP and tissue perfusion. If in doubt, trial of 200–300 mL
crystalloid fast IVI, and reassess clinical parameters. Repeat, as required.
Replacement
If the patient is not shocked, the optimal infusion rate depends on: (i) degree
of hypovolaemia; (ii) ongoing losses; (iii) whether oligo-anuric; (iv) CV
status.
The following is a rough guide to getting things underway (1 slower in
the elderly and in those with poor LV function):
• First litre over 2h, then reassess.
• Second litre over 4h, then reassess.
• Third litre over 6h, then reassess.
In the face of ongoing losses (e.g. diarrhoea), input should aim to exceed
measured and unmeasured (insensible, 730mL/h) losses by 100mL/h. If you
think you may have overdone it, stop ﬂuids and reassess the patient.
Maintenance
Once euvolaemic, and assuming no other losses, match UO + 30mL on an
hourly basis. Insensible losses will be higher in a febrile patient. 2 Reassess
the patient at least twice a day.

AKI MANAGEMENT: VOLUME REPLACEMENT—HOW MUCH?

When do you need a central line?
• Not often; however, bedside assessment can be problematic.
Although generally straightforward when the patient is profoundly
volume-depleted, it is much more difﬁcult to judge when a patient is
at the point of euvolaemia and 6 no longer in need of ﬂuid.
• Despite this, clinical assessment remains the cornerstone—it is an
important skill and improves with practice.
• If you are not experienced enough to assess volume status clinically,
then you are unlikely to be experienced enough to use invasive
monitoring correctly. If in doubt, speak to your critical care.
• Stand-alone CVP measurements do not correlate well with
intravascular volume status (although trends following a ﬂuid bolus
may be helpful).
• 2 Putting a central lines into a hypovolaemic patient is not easy and
offers a signiﬁcant risk of complication.
• The UK consensus AKI statement does not advocate a CVP line for
the routine management of AKI.
However, a CVP may be useful in AKI in conjunction with:
• Septic shock and capillary leak.
• Cardiogenic shock or where the CV status is precarious and you feel
it would be dangerous, or unwise, to give signiﬁcant ﬂuids without a
more accurate baseline and continuous monitoring.
• The need for vasoactive medications (e.g. noradrenaline).
• There are other non-invasive tests that are being increasingly used
to assess volume status, e.g. IVC diameter on ultrasound (b p. 13.)

Hyperkalaemia
Medical therapy of hyperkalaemia is a transient measure pending imminent recovery in renal function
or transfer to kidney unit or critical care for renal replacement therapy.
If ECG change, give calcium gluconate 10mL 10%.
If bicarbonate <22mmol/L and no fluid overload, give 500mL 1.26% sodium bicarbonate over 1 hour.
K >6.5mmol/L or ECG changes, give insulin 10IU in 50mL of 50% glucose over 15 minutes and
salbutamol 10mg nebulized (caution with salbutamol in tachycardia or ischaemic heart disease).
Insulin/glucose and salbutamol reduce ECF potassium for <4 hours only.
Acidosis
Medical therapy of acidosis with bicarbonate reserved for emergency management
of hyperkalaemia (as above) pending specialist help.
pH <7.15 requires immediate critical care referral.
Pulmonary oedema
Sit the patient up and give oxygen (60–100% unless contraindicated)
If haemodynamically stable, give furosemide 80mg IV. Consider repeat bolus and infusion at 10mg/hour
If haemodynamically stable, commence GTN 1–10mg/hour titrating dose.
Reduced conscious level
Manage uraemic coma as per all reduced consciousness (airway management) pending
critical care transfer and emergency renal replacement therapy.
These are holding measures prior to specialist help from critical care
or nephrology services

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI management: hyperkalaemia
In excitable tissues, i K+l depolarization of the membrane resting potential l Na+ channel inactivation ld membrane excitability l neuromuscular depression and cardiac dysrhythmias.

What represents a dangerous i K+?
• Chronically hyperkalaemic patients may tolerate i K+ of
6.0–7.0mmol/L (2 but treat if >6.5mmol/L).
• 1 However, an acute i K+ in AKI is much less likely to be tolerated,
particularly if: (i) elderly; (ii) associated cardiac disease (esp.
arrhythmias); (iii) oliguria (cannot excrete i K+).
• Closely monitor (l cardiac monitor, repeat serum K+ 2–4-hourly) all
patients with i K+ acutely >6.0mmol/L, and commence treatment to
enhance K+ wasting.
• 3 Treat to urgently lower serum K+ if ≥6.5mmol/L.
1 Although U&E are often repeated to exclude haemolysis or artefact,
this should cause delays l put on a cardiac monitor, and start treatment.

The hyperkalaemic ECG
ECG manifestations of i K+ are manifold (see Fig. 2.13). 1 Mild ECG
changes can progress to life-threatening disturbances very quickly. All
may be exacerbated by coexisting d Ca2+ and acidosis. 1 A normal ECG
does not rule out cardiac instability.
• Peaking of T waves (‘tenting’).
• Flattening and disappearance of P waves.
• Prolonged PR interval (p heart block).
• Progressive widening of the QRS complex.
Rising K+
• Deepened S waves and merging of S and T waves.
• Idioventricular rhythm.
• Sine wave pattern.

3 Treatment of dangerous hyperkalaemia
The following d serum K+ acutely but DO NOT d overall elevated total
body K+. Additional measures, described on b pp. 132–133, are 6 also
required.
Calcium
• If K+ ≥6.5mmol/L or ECG changes.
• 2 Ca2+ is cardioprotective—it does not d K+.
• Antagonizes membrane K+ effects by poorly understood mechanisms.
• 10mL 10% calcium gluconate (usually 1 ampoule—calcium
gluconate contains 220μmol Ca2+/mL), or
• 5mL 10% calcium chloride (usually half an ampoule—CaCl2 contains
680μmol Ca2+/mL).
• Give over 2–5min. Repeat if no ECG improvement after 5min (up to
40mL calcium gluconate).
• Acts within minutes, but protective effect lasts <1h.
• 1 Can induce digitalis toxicity (l a pragmatic approach: halve the
initial dose, and give more slowly if taking digoxin).
Insulin and glucose
• If K+ ≥6.5mmol/L or ECG changes.
• Insulin binds to its cellular receptor and i Na-K-ATPase activity,
moving K+ into cells. Glucose alone will d K+ through endogenous
insulin release, but insulin/glucose is more effective.
• 10–15IU of soluble insulin (e.g. Actrapid®) in 50mL of 50% glucose IVI
over 10min (alternative: 5IU of soluble insulin in 50mL 20% glucose
over 15min by syringe pump and repeated).
• 50% glucose is extremely viscous and irritant. Find a large vein, and
ﬂush with saline afterwards.
• Effect within 15–30min (peak 760min), lasts for 2–4h. Expect a d of
0.5–1.5mmol/L. Can be repeated after 4h.
• Check BMs regularly for 6h, and infuse 10% glucose IVI if d glucose.
Sodium bicarbonate
• If i K+ in the presence of acidosis (HCO3– <16) and volume depletion.
• i Na+/H+ exchange li intracellular Na+li Na-K-ATPase activity (i.e.
K+ in for Na+ out). Additional pH-independent mechanisms operate.
• 1.26% or 1.4% solutions as 200–500mL over 15–60min IVI.
• In cardiac arrest: 50mL of 8.4% (1 ampoule) IVI.
• 1 CAUTION: do not infuse bicarbonate solutions into the same
cannula as calcium gluconate/carbonate unless thoroughly ﬂushed.
• Action within hours, not minutes.
• Involves an appreciable Na+ load (150mmol Na+). 1 Volume overload.
• Rapid correction of acidosis in a patient with d Ca2+ may induce tetany
and seizures, as ionized calcium drops rapidly as pH i.

131

132

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

B2-agonists (salbutamol, etc.)
• 10–20mg (i.e. a large dose) of nebulized salbutamol will d K+ by up to
1mmol/L but has limited additive beneﬁt beyond insulin/glucose (it acts
via the same Na-K-ATPase and has a slower onset of action).
• 1 It may also precipitate angina or arrhythmias in those with
underlying cardiac disease and can cause an increase in lactate acid
(l worsening acidosis).
Once (if) the immediate arrhythmic danger is past, the aim should be to
reduce total body potassium to prevent further hyperkalaemic episodes.

Urinary K+ wasting: diuretics
• Only useful in patients expected to pass urine and 6 urine into which
K+ can be excreted. Particularly useful if coexisting volume overload.
• Act on the renal tubule—K+ loss as one of several effects.
• Furosemide 40–120mg IVI as a slow bolus or 10–40mg/h to a maximum
of 1000mg/day. Bumetanide offers a better absorbed oral alternative.
• Effect depends on onset of diuresis. Can lose substantial amounts of K+
over 24h, with a UO >2L/day.
• Much less effective, as GFR deteriorates.

Gut K+ wasting: cation exchange resins
Overused, particularly orally.
• Exchange Na+/Ca2+ for K+ in the gut so actually removes K+, rather
than just redistributing it.
• Calcium polystyrene sulfonate (CPS) (Calcium Resonium®) or sodium
polystyrene sulphonate (SPS) (Resonium A® or Kayexalate®). Can give
15g orally (supplied as a powder to be suspended in water) up to qds
or 15–30g suspended in 2% methylcellulose and 100mL water rectally
up to qds, retained for at least 2 (preferably >4) hours. May require
saline irrigation through a catheter to remove the resin from the colon.
• Rectal route is more effective, as there is more K+ available for exchange:
colonic [K+] = 60–90mmol/L, whereas upper GI tract = 5–10mmol/L.
• The constipating effect of these agents given orally may paradoxically
prevent K+ losses in the stool—equally, the laxatives (e.g. lactulose
10–20mL tds) given with these agents may be more efﬁcacious than
the agent itself!
• Modest effect seen within 24–48h.
• May cause colonic ulceration and necrosis (recognized with SPS when
given with sorbitol as a hyperosmotic laxative—previously a common
practice in the USA. Post-op patients with an ileus are at highest risk).

AKI MANAGEMENT: HYPERKALAEMIA

Extracorporeal K+ wasting: dialysis
• Consider if K+ >6.0mmol/L, or rapidly rising, and renal function
cannot be restored quickly.
• Lowers K+ within minutes.
• Haemodialysis (HD) can process 20–60L of blood against a dialysate
K+ of 1–2mmol/L and is 6 a potent means of removing K+.
• Haemoﬁltration (b p. 174), with returned infusate free of K+, can
achieve much the same thing although much slower.
• Peritoneal dialysis is effective but rarely indicated acutely (b p. 188).
• Requires dialysis access and transfer to a dialysing facility (which
potentially introduces delays).
• 1 Never transfer a dangerously hyperkalaemic patient—if they are not
responding to emergency measures, speak to your ITU (b p. 123).

Further management
The aim is to prevent further dangerous rises.
• Restrict oral K+ intake to <2g per day. 2 Speak to your dietetic staff
(b p. 258). 1 K+ content of enteral and parenteral feeds may need
modiﬁcation.
• 1 No K+ in IV ﬂuids.
• Avoid K+-sparing diuretics, ACE-I, ARB, spironolactone, and NSAIDs.
• 2 Refractory i K+ is an indication for dialysis.
• If i K+ persists, despite dialysis, then:
• Review dietary intake and compliance.
• Triple-check the drug chart.
• Check for GI or occult bleeding (reabsorbed red cells are rich
in K+).
• Exclude concealed tissue or muscle damage (e.g. compartment
syndrome).
• Review (and consider changing) dialysis access and dialysis adequacy
(b p. 181). Check dialysate K+ concentration (b p. 179).

Blood transfusion
1 Caution is needed when administering a blood transfusion to a patient
with AKI, particularly if oligo-anuric. The volume and K+ content of red
cell transfusions can precipitate pulmonary oedema and hyperkalaemia,
respectively. If the patient requires renal support, then transfusions are
safest given during dialysis treatment (2 seek expert advice).

133

134

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI management: pulmonary oedema
Introduction
Oliguric or anuric patients rapidly accumulate salt and water unless (and
even if) tightly ﬂuid-restricted. Volume overload, often exacerbated iatrogenically, remains a relatively common presentation of AKI.
In AKI, the heart is often structurally normal, but salt and water overload push it inexorably along the Starling curve. Many patients may also
have poor underlying cardiac reserve (l1 mortality is high).

Findings
Cool, clammy, agitated patient. Tachycardia, tachypnoea, i JVP, i BP
(d BP in this context is worrying), gallop rhythm, respiratory crackles, and
wheezes. Possibly: ascites, pleural effusions, and oedema.

Investigations
• Poor O2 saturation.
• Hypoxaemia on ABGs (PaO2 <8kPa).
• Widespread alveolar shadowing on CXR.

Management
• Sit the patient up, and stop all IV infusions.
• Oxygen. Maintain SaO2 >95%. It should be possible to achieve an FiO2
>60% using a well-positioned high-ﬂow (e.g. Venturi) mask with an O2
ﬂow rate of 6L/min. Combine with nasal prongs, if necessary. Masks
with reservoir bags may allow FiO2 >80%. Consider ward CPAP if
available (e.g. Boussignac system).
• Opiates. Give IV diamorphine (1.25–2.5mg) or morphine (2.5–5mg) as
an anxiolytic and a venodilator (+ 5mg metoclopramide as antiemetic).
Can be repeated after 15min, but opiates will accumulate in AKI, so
resist giving additional doses.
• Nitrates. If the systolic BP ≥90mmHg, start intravenous GTN
2–10mg/h. Start low, and titrate every 10min, as tolerated. Give 2
puffs of sublingual GTN while the pump is being set up. If systolic
BP is <90mmHg (2 ? cardiogenic shock), call your ITU and consider
inotropic support.
• Diuretics (b p. 144). Administer 80–120mg furosemide bolus IV. If
this initiates a diuresis, then repeat or start a continuous infusion
(10–40mg/h). 2 If no increase in urine output, seek specialist help
without delay.
• Renal replacement therapy. Oligo-anuric patients are likely to need
renal support (b p. 172). 1 If renal facilities are not on site,
then ensure the patient is ﬁt for transfer—discuss with your ITU
(b p. 123).

AKI MANAGEMENT: PULMONARY OEDEMA

How to give loop diuretics in AKI
• A bolus of 80–120mg IV furosemide can be administered initially.
• If no response, then call for expert help. Consider 250mg (25mL
ampoule) furosemide IV, made up to 50mL (syringe driver) or
100mL (infusion pump) at a rate not exceeding 4mg/min to avoid
ototoxicity. Bumetanide 5mg is an alternative.
• If this initiates a diuresis, give a further 250mg.
• If no response, further doses are likely to be futile. (2 Dialysis?)
• If there is a reasonable, but transient, response, then a continuous
infusion 10–40mg/h over 24h may promote ongoing diuresis.

Consider respiratory support if:
•
•
•
•
•

Continuing severe breathlessness.
Falling respiratory rate (tiring patient).
PaO2 <8KPa, rising PaCO2.
Worsening acidosis (pH <7.2).
Inform your ITU team about the patient before these occur.

Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP)
Provides a constant positive pressure support throughout the respiratory
cycle (typically 5–10cmH2O), allowing delivery of a higher FiO2 (80–100%)
and decreasing the work of breathing.
1 Patients must be conscious, able to protect their airway, and possess
sufﬁcient respiratory muscle strength.
Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation
Requires critical care transfer. PEEP—a preset pressure is added to the
end of expiration to prevent airway/alveolar collapse and open up atelectatic and ﬂuid-ﬁlled lung.

Venesection

• Exceptional circumstances and Hb ≥100g/L and SBP ≥120mmHg.
• 250mL blood removed from a large vein with venesection kit.
• Ideally, the blood should be saved to transfuse back when the
patient is more stable.

135

136

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI management: electrolytes
and acidosis
Hyperphosphataemia
• d urinary PO4 excretion li serum PO4. (b p. 237).
• Likely to be a potential issue in more persistent AKI, such as
established ATN.
• Particularly marked elevations occur (early) in rhabdomyolysis
(b p. 152), tumour lysis syndrome (b p. 160), and haemolysis (tissue
injury and cell death l release of intracellular PO4).
• Acute i PO4 is important because it:
• Contributes to d Ca2+ (by a poorly understood mechanism).
• Encourages s hyperparathyroidism.
• Promotes soft tissue/vascular calciﬁcation.
• Makes the patient feel itchy, uncomfortable, and anorexic.
• May cause arrhythmias.
Treatment (see also b p. 246)
• Dietary restriction of phosphate (<800mg/day, b p. 258). This
requires a careful balance against an adequate protein and calorie
intake—speak to your dietitian.
• PO4 removal through dialysis or haemoﬁltration.
• Oral phosphate binders (reduce intestinal absorption of phosphate):
• If both d Ca2+ and i PO4, start calcium carbonate (usually 500mg
calcium per tablet) or calcium acetate (250mg calcium).
• If PO4 <2.4mmol/L, one tablet with each meal.
• If PO4 >2.4mmol/L, two tablets with each meal.
• If serum Ca2+ ≥2.4mmol/L, use a non-calcium-containing binder (e.g.
sevelamer HCl (0.8–2.4g with meals) or Alu-cap® (1–2 capsules with
meals).
• Severe i PO4 is unlikely to correct until the patient dialyses or
recovers independent renal function.
• If the patient is being NG or parenterally fed, liaise with your dietitian.

Hypocalcaemia
Relatively common in prolonged or severe AKI. Usually in the corrected
range of 1.6–2.0mmol/L. Caused mainly by d 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
synthesis but also by i PO4. Clinical sequelae (e.g. paraesthesiae, tetany,
and seizures) are rare, partly because concomitant acidosis protects by
increasing the ratio of ionized to protein-bound Ca2+. 1 Rapid correction
of acidosis with oral or IV HCO3– can precipitate symptomatic d Ca2+.
Calcium is supplemented orally (as ‘Hyperphosphataemia’ section)—the
dual phosphate-binding role of calcium salts helps to make life simple. IV
Ca2+ (e.g. calcium gluconate) is virtually never required. If Ca2+<2.0mmol/L
(and PO4 <1.5mmol/L), start alfacalcidol (or calcitriol) 0.25–0.5 micrograms PO daily.

AKI MANAGEMENT: ELECTROLYTES AND ACIDOSIS

1 In rhabdomyolysis (b p. 152), Ca2+ can precipitate in injured muscle,
causing necrosis and ischaemic contractures—resist the administration of
Ca2+ unless symptomatic hypocalcaemia.

Other electrolyte abnormalities found with AKI
Hypokalaemia. Rare in AKI but can accompany non-oliguric ATN caused
by tubular toxins (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin, cisplatin). May also
develop as GFR recovers, especially in the context of polyuria.
Hypomagnesaemia. d Mg2+ occasionally complicates non-oliguric ATN.
Usually asymptomatic but can l neuromuscular instability, cramps,
arrhythmias, resistant d K+, and resistant d Ca2+.

Metabolic acidosis
• AKI is usually associated with a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis:
• As GFR falls, unmeasured anions (such as HSO4– and HPO4–)
from dietary and metabolic sources accumulate.
• As H+ is buffered, HCO3– is consumed.
• The struggling kidney is unable to reclaim ﬁltered HCO3– from
the urine (proximal tubule) or generate new HCO3– (through
production and excretion of NH4+).
• The degree of acidosis is usually modest in uncomplicated AKI
(serum HCO3– >10, pH >7.2) but more problematic in the critically
ill where it may contribute to circulatory compromise. 1 If
unexpectedly severe, consider s cause—especially lactic acidosis
(sepsis, cardiogenic shock), ketoacidosis (diabetes and alcohol), and
poisoning (salicylates, methanol, ethylene glycol).
• Acidosis per se may be an indication for dialysis, particularly if pH
<7.0–7.1 or evidence of cardiovascular compromise.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI management: other strategies
Anaemia
2 Do not always assume anaemia is part of the uraemic syndrome.
Beware bleeding—especially from the GI tract—and haemolysis.
An Hb of 78–11g/dL is a frequent ﬁnding in AKI—it does not help to
distinguish between AKI and CKD. Major contributing factors are impaired
erythropoiesis (d renal EPO production), d red cell lifespan, haemolysis
(i red cell fragility), haemodilution (from ﬂuid overload), and blood loss.
Treatment with an ESA is rarely effective in AKI (b p. 220), so transfusion may be necessary, particularly if d cardiovascular reserve means d
Hb is poorly tolerated. See b p. 133 for blood transfusion in oligo-anuric
patients.

Bleeding
Acute renal insufﬁciency may be associated with a bleeding tendency s
to platelet dysfunction. Uraemic toxins disrupt the interaction between
platelet GPIIb/IIIa and adhesion molecules, such as von Willebrand factor
(vWF) and ﬁbrinogen. i platelet nitric oxide synthesis may also inhibit
aggregation.
Clinical manifestations are typically mild (e.g. spontaneous bruising,
bleeding at venepuncture sites) though occasionally more troublesome
(1 GI tract). Usually manifest if urea >25mmol/L for several days.
INR, APTT, and platelet count are usually normal (if abnormal l look
for other causes). The bleeding time (if measured) is prolonged.

Correcting bleeding tendency
• The two situations that require speciﬁc intervention are:
• Active bleeding or poorly controlled persistent oozing.
• Prior to an invasive procedure (including renal biopsy).
Management
• Stop aspirin, clopidogrel, anticoagulants.
• Correct anaemia (transfusion of packed cells). A haematocrit (Hct)
≥25–30% will help to reduce bleeding time.
• DDAVP® (desmopressin): a synthetic analogue of ADH that
probably acts by i amount of available vWF. Easy to administer
and often beneﬁcial. Give 0.3 micrograms/kg IV in 100mL of 0.9%
NaCl over 30min. Effective within 1h, lasts 4–24 h. Less effective on
repetitive dosing. Can also be given subcutaneously (same dose)
and intranasally (3 micrograms/kg). 1 Rarely causes coronary
vasospasm—avoid if unstable angina.
• Cryoprecipitate: 10 units every 12–24h. Not usually required unless
more severe bleeding.
• Dialysis: improves bleeding time, presumably through removal of
uraemic toxins. 2 Dialysis usually requires anticoagulation to prevent
clotting of the extracorporeal circuit (b p. 182).

AKI MANAGEMENT: OTHER STRATEGIES

Infection
• 2 Sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in AKI
(775% mortality if AKI + sepsis). It occurs in three contexts:
• AKI is the consequence of a speciﬁc infection (e.g. post-infectious
GN, endocarditis, malaria, leptospirosis, hantavirus).
• Septicaemia l circulatory compromise l pre-renal AKI l ATN.
• Localized or systemic infection arises in those with
pre-existing AKI.
Approach
• Take signs of infection, such as fever, i WCC, i CRP, seriously—as
a minimum, re-examine the patient thoroughly.
• Culture (and re-culture) blood, urine, sputum, and other secretions.
• Make use of imaging. Repeat CXRs frequently. If the source of sepsis
remains obscure, consider abdominal/chest/pelvis CT.
• Attention to microbiological detail: chase up samples; review
sensitivities; carefully consider antibiotic options, and speak to your
microbiologist regularly about resistance patterns.
• 1 Many antimicrobials require dose adjustment in renal impairment
(b p. 878).
• Strict aseptic technique for central venous line, dialysis catheter,
and bladder catheter insertion. Consider prophylactic antibiotics
when inserting a line or catheter into a febrile patient. Do not leave
bladder catheters in place longer than necessary. In the majority
of cases, accurate monitoring of UO does not require a catheter.
Antibiotic cover for removal if the urine is a likely source of sepsis.
• Inspect IV cannula sites regularly, and look under dressings.
• Remove all lines as soon as feasible.
• 3 Treat proven infection aggressively.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI management: nutrition
Pre-existing and hospital-acquired malnutrition li morbidity and mortality in the critically ill. Preventing malnutrition preserves muscle function
(including) respiratory, i wound healing, and i resistance to infection.

General rules
• If pre-existing nutritional status is normal and a normal diet is likely to
be resumed in ≤5 days, support is not initially indicated.
• If the patient is malnourished, ignore this 5-day rule and start feeding.
• If hypercatabolic (sepsis, trauma, burns), initiate support early.
• Some protocols avoid feeding within ﬁrst 24h: evidence that feeding
during the ‘insult phase’ i O2 requirements and worsens tissue injury).
• Modify nutritional support as GFR changes and with dialysis initiation.
• Do not overprescribe—you can have too much of a good thing.
• Enteral feeding is always preferable to parenteral (although they are
not mutually exclusive).

Step 1: determine the nutritional status of the patient
•
•
•
•

Body weight: recent unintentional loss >10% body weight is a bad sign.
Determine BMI (kg/height in m2). Normal range 20–25kg/m2.
Beware ﬂuid retention falsely i weight.
Serum albumin (<30g/L is worrying), though inﬂammation may be a
confounder. Pre-albumin, transferrin, and cholesterol can also be used.
• Subjective global assessment (SGA): combines clinical parameters
with albumin, anthropometry, clinical judgement, and other metrics
(b p. 258).

Step 2: estimate energy requirements
• Standard formulae (>200 published), e.g. Schoﬁeld,3 revolve around
gender-based, weight-adjusted formulae. Ask your dietitian.
• Energy expenditure in ‘uncomplicated’ AKI is usually within the normal
range, and energy requirements for those with ‘complicated’ AKI are
generally determined by associated disorders (e.g. sepsis). It is rare for
energy requirements to exceed 130% basal.
• 2 Broadly speaking: ♂ should receive 25–30 non-protein kcal/kg/day
and ♀ 20–25kcal/kg/day.

Step 3: estimation of protein (and amino acid)
requirements
• Depends on associated catabolic stress. Hypercatabolism li Ur,
which can be used to estimate nitrogen balance. Rules of thumb:
• For ‘uncomplicated’ AKI, daily protein or amino acid requirement is
near the recommended allowance of 0.8g/kg/day for normal adults.
• In ‘complicated’ AKI, the requirement is 71.0–1.2g/kg/day.
• If dialysis is necessary, add 0.2g/kg/day.
• Critically ill patients may need more (up to 1.5g/kg/day); ≥1.5g/kg/day
may aggravate the situation by stimulating formation of urea and other
nitrogenous waste products.

AKI MANAGEMENT: NUTRITION

Step 4: decide on route of administration
See Table 2.5.

Step 5: ensure volume and electrolyte content
appropriate for AKI
• Low volume and low electrolyte feeds are often necessary.
• Requirements may change as renal support is initiated (and will depend
on whether intermittent dialysis or CRRT).
• Consider high dose vitamin administration (e.g. Pabrinex®) if preexisting malnutrition.

Parenteral

Amino acids: combined essential
and non-essential (the latter often
become ‘conditionally’ essential in the
context of AKI)
Energy: principally given as glucose,
although >5g/kg/day causes CO2
production (increasing respiratory
demands), lipogenesis (fatty liver), and
hyperglycaemia. Lipids are used to
provide the remainder (usually ≤1g/
kg/day to avoid hyperlipidaemia).
Vitamins, trace elements, electrolytes
(and sometimes insulin) are added, as
necessary.

IV lipids have a low
osmolality and can be given
into peripheral veins.
They do not meet all energy
requirements so are mainly
a short-term measure.
Full TPN must usually
be given centrally (via a
dedicated line).
If possible, a small amount
of enteral feed is run
concurrently.

Start feed slowly.
Continuous renal replacement
techniques (e.g. CVVHF) assist
the delivery of feeding.

Catheter insertion:

Catheter infection.
Metabolic: requires close

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI management: myths
Loop diuretics
Theory. (i) i urinary ﬂow ‘washes out’ cellular debris, casts, and nephrotoxins from tubules; (ii) blockade of active transport processes ld tubular
O2 consumption and protects against ATN; (iii) vasodilator action li RBF.
Evidence. None to suggest improved renal or patient outcome in any AKI
setting. In particular, the natural history and prognosis of ATN remains
unchanged. Some studies have suggested harm. May increase diuresis,
however, assisting the management of ﬂuid balance and preventing progressive volume overload. 2 Given as part of the treatment of pulmonary oedema (b p. 134). 1 The only indication for diuretics is volume
overload.

Mannitol
An osmotic diuretic, previously used for the prevention of ATN in high-risk
CV surgery. A lack of evidence means the practice is in decline. Can paradoxically cause pulmonary oedema through volume expansion. Avoid.

Dopamine
Previously widely used for the prevention and treatment of AKI. A lack of
evidence for efﬁcacy and potential risk of harm have led most to abandon
this practice. You should do the same.
Theory. Dopamine (DA) is synthesized in the proximal tubule from circulating L-dopa and helps regulate Na+ excretion and renal vasodilatation through speciﬁc DA1 and DA2 receptors. Exogenously administered
‘low-dose’ dopamine should l renal vasodilatation li RBF li natriuresis
and mild i GFR. All would be of potential beneﬁt in AKI, although evidence suggests these mechanisms may not remain intact in renal insufﬁciency. (See Table 2.6.)

A adrenergic (vasoconstrictive) effect takes over with i SVR.

AKI MANAGEMENT: MYTHS

Evidence. Largely anecdotal or from inadequate studies. Larger trials (e.g.
ANZICS) have failed to show beneﬁt.
1 It may cause harm: tachycardia, arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia,
blunted hypoxaemic drive, splanchnic vasoconstriction (l bacterial
translocation), digital ischaemia, impaired pituitary function, electrolyte
disturbances (even at ‘renal’ dose), impaired T cell function. Dopamine
accumulates in renal failure.

Other ‘renoprotective’ agents
Fenoldopam
• Dopaminergic agonist that acts through DA1 receptors (without
signiﬁcant A or B adrenergic activity) to produce afferent and
efferent arteriolar vasodilatation.
• Preserves renal blood ﬂow and tissue oxygenation in animal studies.
• Human studies (mainly small) have yielded variable results in several
clinical contexts, including AKI prevention post-cardiac surgery.
• Larger randomized studies are awaited. In the meantime,
fenoldopam use is not recommended in the KDIGO (2012)
guideline.
Atrial natriuretic peptides
• ANP ld tubular Na+ reabsorption, i afferent arteriolar
vasodilatation, and d RAS activation.
• Tested in a post-surgical context in multiple studies, but overall
quality of study evidence is variable and inconsistent.
• Can induce signiﬁcant, and potentially harmful, hypotension.
• Other natriuretic peptides have been tried, e.g. brain natriuretic
peptide (nesiritide) and urodilatin.
• Not recommended in KDIGO (2012) guideline.
N-acetylcysteine
• Most widely studied in the context of contrast-induced AKI
(b p. 150).
• NAC is a modiﬁed form of the amino acid L-cysteine, a precursor of
glutathione.
• NAC is a potent free radical scavenger and antioxidant that also
possesses vasodilator properties (via nitric oxide availability).
• Shown to reduce ischaemic and nephrotoxic ATN in animal studies
but clinical evidence lacking.
• Not recommended in KDIGO (2012) guideline.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI: hope for the future?
Phases of ATN (see also b p. 108)
There are four pathophysiological/temporal phases of ATN that can help
to conceptualize where pharmacological interventions might be targeted
and applied.
Initiation phase
Characterized by aberrant vascular reactivity, diminished renal perfusion,
and widespread oxidative injury.
Extension phase
A proinﬂammatory state, with macrophage activation, inﬂammatory mediator release, and stimulation of epithelial and endothelial cells.
Maintenance phase
Restoration of tubular cell integrity through the division of adjacent tubular cells and the differentiation of local (kidney) and systemic (haematopoietic—X) stem cells.
Repair phase
Normal tubular cell function is restored.
Very broadly speaking, therapeutic interventions can, therefore, attempt
to decrease vascular reactivity, moderate inﬂammation, preserve cell viability, and augment cell repair.
Putative agents are shown in Table 2.7.
Many of these are currently being studied in animal models of renal
ischaemia-reperfusion injury, but beneﬁt in human AKI is yet to be demonstrated. There are many potential reasons for this: AKI is a heterogeneous
condition (both in terms of the type of patient affected and the underlying
cause); study endpoints (such as mortality) are often confounded, and, until
recently, there was no agreed consensus deﬁnition of AKI. Furthermore,
late detection of AKI prevents timely administration. It is hoped that novel
AKI biomarkers will facilitate earlier intervention (b p. 94).

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Contrast-induced AKI (CI-AKI)
Introduction
CI-AKI accounts for 710% of in-hospital AKI and is associated with signiﬁcant mortality (x5.5 odds adjusted risk of death), prolonged hospitalization, and future cardiovascular events. It may also irreversibly d GFR (esp.
in those with pre-existing CKD). These adverse outcomes are worse in
those who require dialysis treatment (2-year mortality rate >80% in one
study!).
CI-AKI risk is low (71–2%) in patients with normal renal function (even
in the presence of diabetes) but much higher in patients with pre-existing
renal impairment (725%), particularly in the presence of additional risk
factors (see Box 2.2—these factors are additive).

Why is contrast toxic?
• Direct toxicity: oxidant injury to proximal tubular cells.
• Vasomotor effects: contrast (perhaps through its osmolality) alters
afferent/efferent tone and thus glomerular perfusion.
• 2 AKI s to ATN results.

Box 2.2 Risk factors
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Pre-existing CKD.
Diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension.
Cardiac failure.
Volume depletion.
Haemodynamic instability.
i Age.
Hyperuricaemia.
Renal transplantation.
Concurrent nephrotoxic drug administration.
High contrast volumes.
Intra-arterial contrast.

Precautions
• Speciﬁc measures are discussed on b p. 149.
• Recognize those at risk (see Box 2.2). For ambulatory patients in
whom a recent measurement of renal function is not available, a
simple questionnaire may identify those at increased risk.4,5
• Dipstick proteinuria will also help identify individuals in whom
measurement of renal function is desirable.
• 1 Many high-risk patients may not be suitable for ‘day case’
procedures.
• Is the procedure really necessary? Is there an alternative ‘non-contrast’
technique? Speak to your radiologist.
• Use iso-osmolar, non-ionic contrast.
• Minimize contrast volume (<100mL, if possible).
• 2 Optimize volume status pre-study.

CONTRAST-INDUCED AKI (CI-AKI)

• Stop all other nephrotoxins prior to procedure (including high doses
of loop diuretics).
• X Although often undertaken, there is no evidence that cessation of
ACE-I, ARBs, or metformin prior to contrast administration is protective.
• Space out multiple procedures whenever possible.
• Inform your renal team of high-risk cases (beforehand!).

Clinical features
• d GFR begins immediately (although SCr may be unchanged initially).
• The earliest (and often only) sign may be oliguria (2 so ensure UO is
being measured in high-risk hospitalized patients).
• i SCr at 12h is the best predictor of CI-AKI.
• Peak SCr usually occurs at 2–3d but can be delayed 5d in a minority
of cases.
• In practice, CI-AKI often becomes apparent when renal function is
rechecked the day after a procedure (so make sure it is checked and
that you see the result).
• Although rarely (if ever) measured, fractional urinary excretion of Na+
often remains <1% (unlike other causes of ATN). This fact is useful for
exam purposes only.

Treatment
• Once established, treat as for any other cause of ATN.
• Ensure adequate hydration, and avoid additional nephrotoxins.
• Standard indications for dialysis support apply (b p. 172).

Prognosis
• In the majority, renal dysfunction is mild and transient (although still
associated with i mortality).
• Recovery within a week is usual. Those with pre-existing advanced
CKD are most susceptible to a permanent d GFR.
• Dialysis support will be necessary in 3–4% of those with underlying
CKD, and long-term renal replacement therapy will be required in the
minority of these.

Strategies to prevent RCN
Hydration
• IV ﬂuids correct volume depletion and i RBF. They also minimize the
pre-renal effects of a post-contrast diuresis.
• Evidence supporting their use is strong. Example regimens:
• 1.26% NaHCO3 3mL/kg/h for 1h pre- and 1mL/kg/h for 6h during
and post-procedure.
• 0.9% NaCl 1mL/kg/h for 12h pre- and 12h post-procedure.
• NaHCO3 may have theoretical advantages over other IV ﬂuids through
an antioxidant effect (peroxynitrate scavenging), but this remains
poorly deﬁned and clinically unproven.
• Examine the patient ﬁrst—if overtly dehydrated, then larger volumes
may be required and the procedure may need to be postponed. If
already volume-overloaded, then further ﬂuids are ill advised.
• Aim for a good urine output (>150mL/h).
• In diuretic dependent patients, withholding diuretics may be sufﬁcient
‘hydration’.

149

150

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

X N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
• Used for its antioxidant properties, always in conjunction with
hydration.
• The evidence underpinning NAC use from randomized trials and
meta-analyses is inconsistent, with many actually suggesting no
beneﬁt.
• NAC may d SCr independently of GFR through interference with
tubular handling.
• Side effects are rare for the doses relevant to CI-AKI prevention
(unlike those for paracetamol overdose); however, marginal effects
on cardiac function and coagulation have been described.
• A typical regimen is 600–1200mg capsules PO 12h x 4 doses
(generally two doses pre-contrast and two doses post).
• Despite the lack of compelling evidence, low cost and a favourable
side effect proﬁle have led to widespread use—as well as retention
in several guidelines (although not KDIGO (2012)).
Others
• There has been interest in both theophylline (antagonizes
adenosine-mediated d RBF) and fenoldopam (speciﬁc dopamine
1 receptor agonist), but clinical studies have been disappointing and
their use is not recommended (although a recent meta-analysis has
suggested there may yet be a role for theophylline.6
• Haemoﬁltration/haemodialysis: ‘prophylactic’ removal of circulating
contrast, particularly in those with advanced CKD. No convincing
evidence of beneﬁt. Costly with signiﬁcant potential adverse effects.
(See Fig. 2.14.)
2 All centres should have a locally agreed protocol, usually based on risk
assessment and ﬂuid 9 NAC administration. An algorithm produced by
LAKIN is shown in Fig. 2.14.

Differential diagnosis
Many patients undergoing invasive endovascular studies have diffuse atherosclerotic disease and are at risk of renal atheroemboli. These may
occur as a distinctive clinical syndrome (b p. 590) but can often go
unrecognized until the anticipated recovery of renal function fails to
materialize.

and
CKD with eGFR <60 (particularly diabetic nephropathy)

Risk factors are multiplicative.

Is contrast procedure necessary?

Yes

Resuscitate to euvolaemia

Minimize contrast, use low or iso-osmolar contrast

Monitor function to 72 hours in high-risk cases
If oliguria or rising creatinine, early referral to local renal team.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Rhabdomyolysis
Introduction
First described as ‘crush syndrome’ during the London blitz of WWII.
Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome caused by release of cellular contents after a signiﬁcant injury to striated muscle.
Injury is caused by either energy depletion and cell death or, more
commonly, during reperfusion of ischaemic muscle. Inﬁltrating leucocytes
release oxidant species that cause myonecrosis. If cell death is widespread,
intracellular elements and membrane products are released into the circulation: creatine kinase (mainly MM isoenzyme but also MB), LDH, myoglobin, purines (l hyperuricaemia), electrolytes (esp. K+ and PO4), and
aminotransferase enzymes. (See Table 2.8.)

Myoglobin (Mb)
The main nephrotoxin. A 19kDa weak O2 carrier (similar to Hb but with
a single haem moiety), Mb is usually bound to plasma proteins. When in
excess, the ferric form (Fe3+) is freely ﬁltered and concentrated l intraluminal cast formation. Tubular degradation generates highly toxic ferryl-Mb
(Fe4+), with direct oxidant tubular cell injury. A key feature of rhabdomyolysis is the large quantities of ﬂuid retained in inﬂamed muscle, causing
profound hypovolaemia, in addition to toxic renal injury.
2 Not all rhabdomyolysis l AKI (particularly if you act quickly).

Clinical presentation
Variable, but the classical myalgia, weakness, and dark urine are rare (750%
have no muscle pain at presentation). Maintain high index of suspicion in
relevant clinical situation; initial clues: i ALT/AST, dipstick +ve haematuria, disproportionate i K+ or PO4 (see ‘Investigations’ section).
1 Examine the limbs carefully—do not miss a compartment syndrome.
Recurrent rhabdomyolysis after mild exertion may suggest an underlying
myopathy.

Investigations
• Dipstick cannot distinguish between myoglobin and haemoglobin.
Classically, urine is dipstick +ve for blood but with no red cells on
microscopy. 720% of patients will have a –ve urinalysis.
• 2 Urinary myoglobin (u-Mb) is +ve (not present in normal urine).
d u-Mb can be used to monitor treatment.
• U&E (SCr:Ur ratio often very high), i Alb if volume-deplete, or
hypoalbuminaemia if capillary leak.
• i CK (better indicator of amount of muscle damage than likelihood of
AKI). i ALT, AST, LDH.
• i K+ (1 often ii), ii PO4, i urate, i lactate, and i anion gap
acidosis (organic acids).
• dd Ca2+, often with avid calcium sequestration in injured muscle.
• Mild DIC frequent (d Plt, i D-dimers).

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Rhabdomyolysis: management
Prevention of AKI
In the early phase of the disorder, vigorous resuscitation may protect
patients from many of the subsequent complications.
• Aim to resuscitate to euvolaemia:
• As much as 12L may be required/day (and more if severe injury).
• Alternate 1L 0.9% NaCl (or balanced crystalloid) with 1L 1.26–1.4%
NaHCO3.
• If the Na+ load li Na+, use 1L 5% dextrose or 1L 0.45% NaCl
containing 50mL 8.4% NaHCO3 to d total Na+ load.
• Aim to maintain a UO ≥150mL/h or ≥300mL/h with traumatic injuries.
• Continue therapy until disappearance of urinary myoglobin.

Urinary alkalinization and mannitol
X The role of urinary alkalinization (stabilizes oxidizing form of myoglobin) and forced diuresis (i urine ﬂow ld tubular precipitation) remains
controversial. 2 The priority is to volume-resuscitate the patient.
• Aim for a target u-pH >6.5 by using alternating NaCl and NaHCO3,
as described in previous section, but increasing the frequency of
NaHCO3 as necessary. Evidence for a meaningful clinical impact is
weak, and volume overload is a risk unless good UO. In addition,
urinary alkalinization can cause a signiﬁcant systemic alkalosis and
6 symptomatic d Ca2+.
• Loop diuretics acidify the urine and should be avoided. Mannitol,
an osmotic diuretic, is preferred: give as a bolus (e.g. 12.5–25g as a
bolus (= 62.5–125mL of 20% (200mg/mL) mannitol solution)) or as an
infusion (10mL/h of 15–20% mannitol). 1 Mannitol li osmolar gap
and may potentially worsen AKI.

Supportive care
• Standard indications for dialysis apply (b p. 172), although i K+ may
occur early.
• Physiotherapy to debilitated muscles is essential.

Prognosis
• The prognosis is good if the causative insult is removed, and renal
function will return to normal in the majority—even in those who
require an extended period of dialysis support.

RHABDOMYOLYSIS: MANAGEMENT

Compartment syndrome in rhabdomyolysis
• May occur in two circumstances:
• If the blood supply to particular limb has been compromised
(immobility after drug overdose, seizures, etc.).
• Generalized muscle injury and inﬂammation (toxic, viral).
• Inﬂammation and oedema within a closed muscle compartment li
intracompartment pressure ld O2 delivery l myonecrosis.
• 2 Always examine the major muscle groups for the characteristic
‘woody’ consistency of an evolving/established compartment
syndrome. Timely fasciotomy in these circumstances may save limb
function.
• If in doubt, compartmental pressure can be measured via
the insertion of a needle with an attached tonometer. An
intracompartment pressure >50mmHg with a normal BP, or 30–
50mmHg in hypotensive patients, is suggestive. If necessary, recheck
every 6h.

Hypocalcaemia
Do not attempt to correct d Ca2+, unless it is symptomatic (tetany,
arrhythmias)—there is a risk the administered calcium will precipitate
in injured muscle. Rebound hypercalcaemia is common during the
recovery phase.
1 Symptomatic d Ca2+ may complicate NaHCO3 administration.

Haemoglobinuric AKI
• Occurs in the context of massive intravascular haemolysis:
• Transfusion reactions (ABO incompatibility).
• Falciparum malaria (blackwater fever, b p. 702).
• Haemolytic anaemias (glucose-6-phosphate deﬁciency (G6PD),
drug-induced, autoimmune).
• Mycoplasma infection.
• Snake, insect, and spider venoms.
• Free Hb does not enter the urine as freely as myoglobin, so AKI is
relatively rare.
Investigations
d Hb, d haptoglobins, i bilirubin, i LDH, i K+; urine is dipstick +ve for
blood; plasma appears dark.
Management
Treat underlying disorder; volume resuscitation to establish a diuresis.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI in cirrhosis
Introduction
AKI is common in cirrhosis. 725% patients presenting with
cirrhosis-associated ascites will develop AKI within 1 year. The presence
of AKI at the time of an admission increases mortality 78-fold, and >50%
of patients will develop AKI during an inpatient episode.
3 Not all concomitant hepatic and renal impairment is due to the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS); it is not even top of the list. Alternative diagnoses may imply a better prognosis. Always consider:
• Sepsis l ATN (40% of AKI in cirrhotic patients).
• Hypovolaemia (e.g. GI haemorrhage, diuretics) l ATN (30% AKI in
cirrhotic patients).
• Nephrotoxins (drugs and i bilirubin l ATN).
• Glomerulonephritis (e.g. MCGN 2° to hepatitis C).

Hepatorenal syndrome
HRS occurs in advanced liver dysfunction, usually cirrhosis, in conjunction
with ascites and portal hypertension. Often split into two types, based
on: (i) rapidity of onset, (ii) severity of AKI, and (iii) prognosis (see Table 2.9).
Table 2.9 Classiﬁcation of HRS
Type I

AKI is the dominant clinical feature
Rapid d GFR (SCr >221 μmol/L (2.5mg/dL)) or CrCl falling to
<20mL/min in less than 2 weeks)
Progressive oligo-anuria (often profound)
Median survival 2 weeks

Type II

Ascites (often refractory) the dominant clinical feature
Protracted clinical course
Renal impairment less acute and severe
Can convert to type I
Median survival 6 months

Pathophysiology of HRS
Liver disease is associated with marked splanchnic (and systemic) vasodilatation (l arterial underﬁlling and d SVR), in part s to local excess NO and
other vasodilator (e.g. adrenomedullin) production (caused by i shear stress
in portal hypertension). Also i bacterial translocation (l peritoneal inﬂammatory response) and i vasoactive gut peptides (e.g. glucagons, prostacyclin).
As a result, the effective arterial blood volume is sensed to have fallen, leading to intense A adrenergic activity, s hyperaldosteronism, ANP synthesis,
and non-osmotic ADH release (hence salt and water overload). Tubular V2
receptor activation causes a dilutional hyponatraemia. An increase in cardiac
output attempts to compensate, but LV dysfunction eventually results. Excess
catecholamine, angiotensin II, adenosine, thromboxane A2, and endothelin
l profound and intense renal vasoconstriction (ld RBF).

AKI IN CIRRHOSIS

The kidneys remain structurally normal, and the renal impairment is
entirely pre-renal in nature—tubular integrity and function are preserved.
Renal biopsies are normal (in practice, unnecessary and hazardous), and
kidneys from HRS patients have been used successfully for transplantation.
Clinical features
• 2 The diagnosis of HRS depends on exclusion of other causes of AKI.
• Recognition can be difﬁcult, as cirrhotic patients are usually
malnourished, with signiﬁcantly d muscle mass (6 SCr may overestimate
GFR). Urea may also be unhelpful (GI bleeding, low hepatic production
9 variable dietary protein intake). Cystatin C (b p. 36) has 6 been used
as an alternative. Other biomarkers (b p. 94) are awaited.
• Signs of advanced liver disease: ascites (practically universal in HRS),
stigmata of chronic liver disease, portal hypertension (beware
GI bleeding!), encephalopathy, jaundice (degree variable), and
coagulopathy.
• Cardiovascular: oedema (Na+ and water retention) and d BP (d SVR
and effective circulating volume).
• 3 Infection: look carefully and regularly for evidence of sepsis
(1 pneumonia, line infections, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).
• Electrolyte disorders: dilutional d Na+ is almost universal.
• Nutritional state: usually poor and deteriorating.
• Urine output: oligo-anuria the norm in type I HRS, with urine volumes
decreasing as the condition progresses. Anuria is an ominous sign.
• Urinalysis bland, with no proteinuria/haematuria.
• Tubular function is preserved, so the kidneys excrete concentrated
urine that is low in Na+ (<10mmol/L) (i.e. indistinguishable from other
pre-renal AKI). Heavily emphasized in the past but no longer included
in diagnostic criteria.
• Normal renal ultrasound/imaging. Renal Doppler can detect i vascular
resistance (elevations predict HRS in cirrhotic patients).

Box 2.3 HRS: diagnostic criteria
• Acute or chronic liver disease with advanced hepatic failure and
portal hypertension.
• Renal impairment: serum SCr ≥133μmol/L (1.5mg/dL).
• Absence of hypovolaemia: no improvement in renal function after
diuretic withdrawal and appropriate volume expansion with IV
albumin (1g/kg/d).
• Absence of other alternative explanations for d GFR, particularly
nephrotoxic drugs and sepsis (2 spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).
• Absence of intrinsic renal disease: proteinuria <500mg/d, urine RBCs
<50 cells per hpf (with no urinary catheter), normal renal USS.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Management of HRS
Risk factors
• Cirrhosis + ascites = 40% 5-year probability of HRS.
• Large volume (>5L) paracentesis without concurrent plasma
expansion. (X Give 100mL 20% human albumin per 1.5L ascites
removed.)
• GI bleeding (variceal bleeding is a common precipitant).
• Overdiuresis (possibly—see Box 2.3).
• Sepsis: especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (720%
will develop HRS). 2 Any cirrhotic patient with ascites should be
assumed to have SBP until proven otherwise. The administration of IV
albumin 1.5g/kg at diagnosis of SBP and 1g/kg 48h later, in addition to
antibiotics, appears to decrease HRS risk.
• Surgery.

Managing established HRS
2 Seek expert help early.
• Volume assessment:
• IV 20% albumin (salt-poor) for volume expansion (e.g. 0.5–1g/kg/day
or aiming for CVP of 5–10cmH2O).
• Na+ restrict (80mmol/24h) and ﬂuid restrict (<1L/24h) if
overloaded.
• Culture blood, urine, and ascites. Empirical IVI cefotaxime 2g tds
for suspected SBP (1 adjusted for renal function). Discuss with
microbiology.
• Consider therapeutic paracentesis if tense ascites with intravesical
pressure >30cmH2O (i intra-abdominal pressure transmitted to
kidneys (i renin release, d GFR) and ureters (relative obstruction))
(b p. 162).

Speciﬁc rescue therapies
• Vasoconstrictors l constrict the splanchnic bed l improve circulatory
(and 6 renal) function. Given in combination with IV albumin. Aim for
MAP >75mmHg.
• Vasopressin analogues (act via splanchnic V1 receptors), e.g.
terlipressin (initially 0.5–1mg/4–6h IVI). Beneﬁts: d SCr, i UO,
i MAP, and improved early survival. Physiological beneﬁts seen
early and often persist. Repeat courses can be effective. 1 Side
effects: ischaemia, e.g. digital, cardiac, mesentery. Terlipressin is not
available in the USA.
• Noradrenaline (0.5–3mg/kg/h) is an alternative.
• Midodrine (7.5–12.5mg PO tds), a selective A1 agonist, may be given
in combination with the somatostatin analogue octreotide (100–200
micrograms SC tds). Aim to i MAP by 15mmHg. Beneﬁts include
improved survival although probably less effective than vasopressin
analogues.

MANAGEMENT OF HRS

• Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) may improve
SCr in selected patients (esp. those with refractory ascites and variceal
bleeding). However, there is a 5% incidence of de novo AKI post-TIPS.
• N-acetylcysteine may have additional beneﬁts and remains
under study.

Renal replacement therapy
• 1 RRT does not improve outcome in HRS and should be viewed as a
bridge to liver transplantation in this context.
• 2 However, AKI in a cirrhotic patient is not always s to HRS and may
6 be reversible. Dialysis treatment should not be withheld in these
circumstances.
• Standard indications apply (b p. 172), although volume overload is
the usual precipitant in this group.
• Continuous RRT techniques (b p. 174) may be better tolerated
(less haemodynamic instability, slower correction of d Na+, and less
ﬂuctuation in intracranial pressure) than intermittent HD.
It has been hoped that artiﬁcial hepatic assist devices can be developed,
following the same general principles as dialysis for renal failure; for example, the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) is an extracorporeal technique in which dialysate is circulated through charcoal and
anion exchanger columns (removing potential HRS mediators, e.g. TNF,
IL-6, and NO). Unfortunately, the diverse metabolic functions of the liver
have proved difﬁcult to replicate, and results have been disappointing.
Technologies under current development are based on the use of various
hepatocyte cell lines to deliver synthetic liver capacity.

Liver transplantation
The most (only?) effective therapy of HRS, although many patients die
before transplantation is possible. Organ allocation differs between
countries, but, in many scoring systems (e.g. MELD), HRS patients are
afforded high priority.
740% patients admitted for liver transplantation have AKI by RIFLE
criteria, and 770% develop AKI post-operatively (the majority of these
will require renal replacement therapy).
Treatment of HRS pre-transplantation improves outcomes
post-transplantation, although patients with pre-transplant renal
impairment have d long-term survival, compared with those with a
normal GFR.
Most patients will have improved renal function after they have recovered from surgery, although the majority do not regain a normal GFR
(710% incidence of ESRD at 11 years).
Combined liver kidney transplantation is an option in selected patients.

159

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Tumour lysis syndrome
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) usually occurs at initiation of treatment
(chemo- or radiotherapy, or even corticosteroids) of lymphoproliferative
(and, less commonly, solid) malignancies but may occur spontaneously,
with a large tumour burden, or at later stages of treatment. Classically, it is
a complication after chemotherapy for high-blast count acute lymphocytic
leukaemias, lymphoma, myeloma, or germ cell tumours.
It results from treatment-induced necrosis of large numbers of
purine-rich (actively proliferating) malignant cells, with intracellular and
membrane products released abruptly into the circulation. Uric acid, in
particular, causes AKI. (See Table 2.10.)
Table 2.10 Criteria for laboratory and clinical diagnosis
The Cairo–Bishop deﬁnition (2004)
Uric acid

≥476μmol/L (8mg/dL) or 25% increase

Potassium

≥6.0mmol/L or 25% increase

Phosphate

≥1.45mmol/L or 25% increase

Calcium

<1.75mmol/L or 25% decrease

≥2 of these features between 3 days pre- and 7 days post-tumour treatment
encompasses the laboratory deﬁnition.
A clinical diagnosis of TLS can be made if AKI, arrhythmias, or seizures occur
in conjunction with the laboratory features.
Cairo MS, Bishop M (2004). British Journal of Haematology, 127(1), 3–11.

Acute uric acid nephropathy
Uric acid is freely ﬁltered and, in excess, precipitates in the tubular lumen
to form obstructing crystalline casts. This is more likely in volume-deplete
patients with low urinary ﬂow rates or if u-pH d.

Clinical ﬁndings
In the context of recent cancer therapy, symptoms and signs are due to
electrolyte abnormalities (3i K+ and dysrhythmias) and AKI. TLS usually occurs within 24–48h of treatment. Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, muscle cramps, and ﬂank pain may also be present.

Investigations
Measure the following pre- and 4–6h post-therapy and serially 6–12h.
• i K+: often rapid i to >7mmol/L.
• i PO4 and d Ca2+: phosphate avidly binds calcium, precipitating
hypocalcaemia and calcium phosphate deposition in the vasculature,
myocardium, and kidney.
• d Mg2+.
• i uric acid: purine nucleotides are metabolized to hypoxanthine,
xanthine, and then uric acid, often rising to >1000μmol/L (~18mg/dL).
• i SCr.
• i LDH.
• Urinary urate measurement and microscopy for crystals rarely needed.

TUMOUR LYSIS SYNDROME

Prevention
• Identify at-risk patients. Algorithms to assist this risk assessment have
been developed. These are based on tumour type, disease burden, and
presence or absence of renal impairment. They stratify patients to low,
intermediate, or high risk. Local protocols may vary.
• Pre-hydration: 0.9% NaCl or glucose saline 2–3L/m2 (74–5L/d) for 48h
pre- and post-therapy. Aim for UO >3L/d (preferably >2mL/kg/h).
1 Beware volume overload if renal or cardiac impairment. Diuretics may
be used cautiously to maintain urine ﬂow unless persistent hypovolaemia.
• Prevent uric acid formation:
• If risk low to moderate: allopurinol PO 100mg/m2 8-hourly (max
800mg/d) from 2 days prior to therapy (1 reduce dose by 50%
if renal impairment). Inhibits xanthine oxidase and prevents the
metabolism of hypoxanthine to xanthine (and then uric acid and its
salt urate). IV allopurinol is available if oral medication not possible
(200–400mg/m2/day in 1–3 divided doses—maximum 600mg/day).
• If high-risk for TLS, pre-emptive rasburicase (see below).

Treatment of established tumour lysis
• Laboratory tests every 4–6h. Cardiac monitor. Consider ITU transfer.
• 2 Beware i K+.
• 2 Beware d Ca2+ induced by i PO4. Correct i PO4 ﬁrst to avoid
systemic calcium phosphate precipitation. Parenteral calcium should
only be administered if evidence of neuromuscular instability and then
with extreme caution.
• Continue volume expansion with 0.9% NaCl, and maintain high UO.
• Continue allopurinol.
• X Alkalinize the urine: 50mL 8.4% NaHCO3 in 1L 0.45% NaCl or 5%
glucose (depending on sodium load and serum Na+), aiming for u-pH
>7.0. i u-pH converts uric acid l more soluble urate salt, although
simply maintaining adequate UO may be as effective. 1 In addition,
alkalosis may promote systemic calcium phosphate deposition (shifts
ionized calcium to non-ionized form), so many have abandoned this
practice (unless severe concomitant metabolic acidosis).
• Rasburicase:
• A recombinant form of the enzyme urase oxidase that occurs in
most species but not higher primates.
• Oxidizes uric acid to soluble allantoin.
• Rapidly d uric acid levels (within 4h; often to undetectable).
• Effective at preventing tumour lysis syndrome.
• Usually given as 200 micrograms/kg IVI over 30min daily for
5–7 days, although shorter protocols (including single dose) have
been developed (it is expensive). 1 Avoid if G6PDH-deﬁcient.
• No adjustment required in renal impairment.
• SE: rashes, GI upset, headache.
• Institute intermittent haemodialysis early if oliguric or uncontrolled
electrolyte abnormalities. Aim for high dialysis clearances with daily
treatments. Continuous techniques may be preferred (b p. 174).

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Abdominal compartment
syndrome (ACS)
Introduction
An important cause of AKI in a critical care setting.
Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is the pressure enclosed within the
abdomen and usually correlates with BMI. Intra-abdominal hypertension
(IAH) is deﬁned as a persistent IAP of ≥12mmHg (with various grades of
severity as IAP rises).
Increased IAP ld blood ﬂow to abdominal viscera l organ dysfunction.
It strongly predicts adverse outcomes in critically ill patients.
Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) describes the syndrome of
organ (including renal) dysfunction s to IAH. It is most often seen in an
HDU/ICU setting where it may be difﬁcult to diagnose amongst the complications of a primary disease.

Causes
• p ACS: disease/injury within the abdomen (e.g. trauma, surgery,
ascites, bowel distension, intraperitoneal bleeding, liver transplantation,
retroperitoneal disease—including AAA, pancreatitis).
• s ACS: disease/injury outside the abdomen (e.g. sepsis, burns,
aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation).
Estimates of prevalence vary widely, e.g. 1–15% in the context of traumatic
injury.

Consequences
• ACS can affect virtually organ system:
• CV: d venous return l reduced cardiac output.
• Respiratory: d chest compliance l respiratory compromise and i
infection.
• GI: d mesenteric blood ﬂow l bowel ischaemia. Venous
congestion l gut oedema. Bacterial translocation l sepsis.
• Liver dysfunction l lactic acidosis.

Renal
• Renal vein compression l venous congestion.
• d cardiac output l SNS and RAS activation l renal
vasoconstriction.
• Both of these ld RBF l glomerular perfusion l oliguria l AKI.

Clinical presentation
Abdominal pain, tenderness, bloating and distension, breathlessness (or i
ventilatory requirements), i pulse, d BP, i JVP, d UO, peripheral oedema,
lactic acidosis.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis requires recognition of at-risk patients and situations with
appropriate measurement of the IAP.

ABDOMINAL COMPARTMENT SYNDROME (ACS)

IAP can be measured indirectly, using intra-gastric, intra-colonic,
IVC, or intra-vesical (most common) catheters. The World Society of
the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome recommends the latter (see
Fig. 2.15). Commercial devices are available, although a pressure transducer connected to a standard Foley catheter is often used.
Imaging is non-diagnostic.

Management
• Supportive care 9 surgical decompression:
• Supportive care: adequate analgesia, sedation, and muscle paralysis
(with ventilatory support); consider NG and rectal decompression;
accurate ﬂuid management; nurse in supine position.
• Surgical decompression: early intervention as IAP rises (and prior to
development of ACS) is increasingly advocated. The most common
technique is midline decompression, leaving an open abdomen.
• Patients should be screened for IAH/ACS risk factors upon ICU admission and with new or progressive organ failure.
• If two or more risk factors are present, a baseline IAP measurement should be obtained
• If IAH is present, serial IAP measurements should be performed throughout the patient’s critical illness.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI in the developing world
Introduction
The aetiology (and 6 presentation) of AKI may be different from that seen
in developed countries, particularly in more rural areas. This may vary down
to a regional level, depending on socio-economic and environmental factors.
However, basic pathophysiological and management principles still apply.

Epidemiology
Cases are underreported, so accurate epidemiological data are scarce.
However, community-acquired AKI is more common (estimate 7150 pmp)
and affects a younger age group (mean age 37 in one study from southern India). Mortality rates are also higher and more dependent on local
resources. There may be less access to RRT in some areas, with peritoneal
dialysis more commonly employed for this purpose (b p. 188).
Overall, ‘medical’ causes of AKI, such as sepsis, predominate; however, cases related to surgery are rising, as increasing numbers of procedures are undertaken in older, more comorbid patients. Fortunately,
obstetric-associated AKI is in fairly rapid decline in most areas.

Causes
Infective causes of AKI
• Diarrhoeal disease:
• Common cause of pre-renal AKI and ATN (and HUS—see further
in list).
• Children with diarrhoea are much more susceptible to AKI
(diarrhoea causes 750% of dialysis-requiring AKI in Indian children).
• Viral causes: rotavirus and Norwalk agent.
• Bacterial causes: E. coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella enteritides, Vibrio
cholera, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella
pneumoniae.
• Treatment is supportive (l directed at ﬂuid and electrolyte
imbalances) 9 antimicrobials for speciﬁc infections.
• Diarrhoea-associated (D+) haemolytic uraemic syndrome
(b p. 578) is common in paediatric practice internationally. It is
most commonly associated with Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 but
has many other precipitants.
• Malaria (b p. 702).
• Leptospirosis:
• Leptospira interrogans is a spirochaete that infects many mammalian
species and is shed in urine.
• Illness classically follows a biphasic course, with an initial febrile
illness, followed by more fulminant disease with liver involvement.
• AKI occurs in 750% of severe cases.
• Associated AKI may be pre-renal/ATN, but an interstitial nephritis
(with marked urinary K+ wasting) is also common.
• Diagnose with serology (late) or antigen detection via PCR (early).
• Treatment is supportive, plus penicillin, doxycycline, or
3rd-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone).

AKI IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD

• HIV (b p. 676):
• AKI usually s to HIV-associated infection or HAART-related
nephrotoxicity, but many other renal lesions are recognized.
• Melioidosis:
• Organism: Burkholderia pseudomallei.
• Area: South East Asia and Northern Australia.
• Illness: pneumonia, visceral and cutaneous micro-abscesses,
septicaemia.
• AKI in >50%. Renal micro-abscesses are common.
• Viral haemorrhagic fevers:
• Severe multisystem illnesses (including Dengue, Yellow, Ebola,
Marburg, and Lassa fever) caused by 12 RNA viruses from four
families (ﬂavi-, arena-, bunya-, and ﬁlovirus).
• Haemodynamic instability and increased vascular permeability
l ATN. Also rhabdomyolysis. Proteinuria is common.
• Hantavirus is discussed on b p. 73.
Non-infective causes
• Herbal or traditional medicines are a common part of healthcare in
many developing countries (b p. 901).
• Surgical AKI:
• Incidence steadily increasing with the growth of surgical specialties
and facilities across the globe.
• Includes perioperative AKI and post-operative complications.
• Trauma.
• Obstructive uropathy is increasing (ageing population, particularly ♂).
• Pregnancy-related AKI is declining, with fewer illegal abortions and
better access to good antenatal care.
• Glucose-6-phosphate deﬁciency (G6PD):
• Affects several hundred million people worldwide, mainly in the
Mediterranean, Africa, Middle and Far East.
• Intravascular haemolysis occurs, following signiﬁcant oxidative

• Haemoglobinuric AKI results (b p. 155).
• Toxins:

Hydrophidae species) cause an astonishing 70% of AKI in Myanmar
although much less in India (3%) and Thailand (1.2%). Venom

well as ATN s to circulatory compromise and DIC (and occasional

(monovalent preferable to polyvalent) may prevent renal injury.
• Scorpion, spider, centipede, and jellyﬁsh bites or stings.
• Mushroom ingestion (of Amanita, Galerina, and Cortinarius genera),
associated with liver and renal failure in severe cases.
• Chemicals:
• The incidences of AKI s to poisoning with copper sulphate (leather
industry), formic acid (rubber industry), and paraquat (agriculture)
are now falling.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI in sepsis
What is the sepsis syndrome?
Sepsis accounts for 2% of all hospital admissions but 25% of admissions to
ITU. AKI is a frequent complication of the sepsis syndrome, increasing in
incidence as the severity of sepsis increases. Patients whose renal failure is
sepsis-related have a mortality of up to 75%. With sepsis, there is evidence
of (usually local) infection, with systemic signs of inﬂammation (i temp,
i HR). This progresses to the sepsis syndrome if organ dysfunction
ensues—typically, confusion, oliguria, hypoxia, and acidosis. Full-blown
septic shock implies hypotension, despite adequate volume resuscitation,
with signs of organ dysfunction.

Causes of signiﬁcant sepsis
• Gram +ve organisms:
• Staphylococci (incl. S. aureus, MRSA, and S. epidermidis) 20–35%.
• Streptococcus pneumoniae 10%.
• Other Gram +ve 10–20%.
• Gram –ve organisms:
• E. coli 10–25%.
• Other Gram –ve (commonly Pseudomonas) 5–20%.
• Others:
• Fungi (Candida) 3%, viruses 3%, parasites (malaria) 1–2%.

How sepsis becomes shock
Engulfed pathogens are lysed, liberating membrane products (including
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and exotoxin), proteins, and DNA. These fragments are recognized by speciﬁc cellular receptors (Toll-like receptors)
which l NFκ-B-dependent cell activation.
Activated cells then release proinﬂammatory mediators (e.g. IL-1,
TNF, IFN), stimulating local and systemic host defence networks.
Systemically activated leucocytes now orchestrate the immune
response, with local leucocyte recruitment into inﬂamed tissue
encouraged.
At the same time, anti-inﬂammatory and resolution pathways (negative feedback) are induced; inappropriate regulation of these pathways
often leads to a deleterious prolongation of systemic inﬂammation.
Within inﬂamed tissue, and eventually systemically, the endothelium
upregulates cellular adhesion molecules and tissue factors to encourage
recruitment of effector cells. Inducible nitric oxide synthase generates
large quantities of NO, and the integrity of intracellular tight junctions
is compromised.
The consequences are reduced microvascular ﬂow and mitochondrial
dysfunction, leading to organ failure.

AKI IN SEPSIS

Clinically, this translates into
• d systemic vascular resistance (NO is a potent vasodilator and renders
angiotensin II and adrenaline less efﬁcacious).
• i capillary leakiness (tight junctions impaired).
• Local tissue injury (neutrophil recruitment with elastase release and
oxidant burst).
• i sympathetic activity.
• RAS activation:
• A2 l vasoconstriction.
• Aldosterone l Na+ retention (b pp. 456–7).
• Non-osmotic ADH (vasopressin) release l vasoconstriction.
• Vascular smooth muscle becomes less sensitive to vasoconstrictors,
so, despite high circulating levels of adrenaline, angiotensin, and
endothelin, the circulation remains (maximally) vasodilated.

The kidney in sepsis
• Noradrenaline l afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction ld
transglomerular perfusion pressure ld GFR and Na+ retention.
• i systemic NO l downregulation of intrarenal NO production l
further d RBF (particularly in the metabolically vulnerable outer
medulla).
• Inﬂammatory cells produce oxidants and proteases that injure renal
endothelium (remember 20% of cardiac output is to the kidney) l
local coagulopathy with intra-glomerular thrombus formation ld
capillary blood ﬂow.
• The end result is d O2 delivery and ATN (b p. 108).
Vasopressor therapy
• Treatment with noradrenaline (NADR) acts to counteract the
generalized vasodilation and sepsis associated d SVR.
• However, NADR may d RBF through the mechanism just described,
thus potentiating AKI.
• In fact, available studies suggest that NADR affects renal outcome
differently, depending on whether d RBF is s to sepsis-induced
vasodilation or hypovolaemia.
• In sepsis, NADR has a greater effect on arteriolar resistance
and can normalize renal vascular resistance, maintaining
transglomerular perfusion pressure.
• NADR li SVR ld renal sympathetic tone li renal perfusion.
• The key point is that ‘adequate’ ﬂuid resuscitation must take
place before (or at least simultaneously with) vasopressor
administration.

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Managing septic shock and AKI
Deﬁnitions
Systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
• Temperature >38.5° or <36.0°.
• HR >90.
• RR >20, pCO2 <4.2kPa, or the need for ventilation.
• WCC >12 or <4 (or blasts >10%).
Sepsis—SIRS and:
• Positive cultures or focus of infection identiﬁed (e.g. cellulitis/
pneumonic changes on CXR).
Severe sepsis—sepsis + one of:
• Skin mottling.
• Capillary reﬁll ≥3s.
• UO <0.5mL/kg/h or the need for dialysis.
• Lactate >2mmol/L.
• Altered mental status (or abnormal EEG).
• Plt <100 or DIC.
• Acute lung injury (ARDS).
• Impaired cardiac function.
Shock—severe sepsis + one of:
• MAP <60 (80 if known hypertensive) after 40–60mL/kg 0.9% NaCl or
20–30mL/kg colloid, i.e. does not respond to volume resuscitation.

Calculating MAP
Mean arterial pressure is expressed as: DBP + (SBP – DBP)/3.

Septic shock bundle
3 Start immediately, and complete within 6h. Resuscitation of these
patients should be subject to a locally agreed protocol that can be initiated
as soon as these patients are identiﬁed.
• Antimicrobial therapy:
• 3 Culture blood and other sites, and institute broad-spectrum
antibiotics within 1h.
• Antiviral and antifungal cover may be necessary, depending on the
clinical scenario.
• Reassess antimicrobial regimen daily.
• Further diagnostic measures should not delay resuscitation. Image
possible sites of infection as early as possible. Consider surgical
treatment of localized source.
• In the event of d BP and/or lactate >4mmol/L, administer a minimum
bolus of 30mL/kg of crystalloid within 1h.
• Apply vasopressors for d BP unresponsive to initial ﬂuid resuscitation.
Aim to maintain MAP ≥65mmHg.

MANAGING SEPTIC SHOCK AND AKI

• If persistent d BP, despite volume resuscitation (septic shock), and/or
initial lactate >4mmol/L, consider invasive monitoring (b p. 13).
• Aim for CVP >8mmHg and central venous oxygen saturation
(ScvO2) of >70%.
• If ScvO2 70% (or SvO2 equivalent of 65%) persists, despite adequate
ﬂuid resuscitation, then consider transfusion of packed red blood
cells to achieve a haematocrit of 30% 9 dobutamine infusion (to a
maximum of 20 micrograms/kg/min).
• During the ﬁrst 6h of resuscitation, the goals include all of the
following:
• CVP >8mmHg.
• MAP ≥65mmHg.
• UO ≥0.5mL/kg/h.
• Central venous (superior vena cava) oxygen saturation ≥70% (or
mixed venous oxygen saturation ≥65%).
• Aim to normalize serum lactate (a marker of tissue hypoperfusion) as
quickly as possible.
• Fluid therapy:
• Give an initial ﬂuid challenge of ≥1000mL crystalloids (to achieve a
minimum of 30mL/kg in the ﬁrst 4–6h).
• More rapid administration and larger amounts of ﬂuid may be
necessary in some patients.
• Continue incremental ﬂuid boluses as long as there is
haemodynamic improvement, as evidenced by either dynamic (e.g.
stroke volume variation) or static (e.g. CO, BP, heart rate) variables.
• Consider adding albumin to the initial ﬂuid resuscitation regimen if
serum albumin is low.
• Avoid sodium bicarbonate therapy for the correction of
hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidaemia with pH ≥7.15.
• Vasopressor therapy:
• Use vasopressor therapy to target an initial MAP of ≥65mmHg.
• Noradrenaline is ﬁrst-line.
• Adrenaline can be added or substituted if an additional agent is
required to maintain BP.
• Vasopressin (0.03 units/min) can also be added to, or substituted
for, noradrenaline.
• Dopamine is an alternative to noradrenaline in selected patients at
low risk of arrhythmias who have low CO 9 low heart rate. Do not
use low-dose dopamine for ‘renal protection’.
• Consider early placement of an arterial catheter in all patients
receiving vasopressor therapy.
• Inotropic therapy:
• Add dobutamine to vasopressor therapy (if administered) in the
presence of: (i) myocardial dysfunction (as suggested by elevated
cardiac ﬁlling pressures and low CO); or (ii) ongoing signs of
hypoperfusion despite adequate intravascular volume and MAP.
• Corticosteroids:
• If patients require persistent high doses of vasopressors for
maintenance of adequate BP despite adequate ﬂuid resuscitation.

169

170

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

• Consider a continuous infusion of IV hydrocortisone (200–300mg
daily—no higher) for a minimum of 5 days.
• Do not base the need for corticosteroid therapy on ACTH
stimulation testing.
• Hydrocortisone is now recommended alone, rather than in
combination with ﬂudrocortisone.
• Blood product administration:
• Transfuse to maintain Hb >7.0g/dL.
• Do not administer FFP to correct laboratory clotting abnormalities
unless bleeding or planned invasive procedures.
• Antithrombin administration is no longer recommended in the
treatment of severe sepsis.
• Consider platelet administration if:
— Counts are <5000/mm3 (5 x 109/L), regardless of bleeding.
— Counts are 5000–30,000/mm3 (5–30 x 109/L) and bleeding risk.
— Surgery or invasive procedures is required: counts ≥50,000/mm3
(50 x 109/L) are recommended.
• Glucose control:
• Hyperglycaemia impairs leucocyte function 9 less well-understood
effects.
• Commence insulin when two consecutive blood glucose levels
are ≥10mmol/L (180mg/dL), and aim to keep blood glucose levels
≤10mmol/L.
• All patients receiving IV insulin should receive a glucose calorie
source.
• Blood glucose values should be monitored every 1–2h until
glucose values and infusion rates have stabilized and then at least
every 4h (1 point-of-care testing of capillary blood should be
interpreted with caution, as they may overestimate plasma glucose
concentration).

Renal priorities in the ITU
• Maintain independent renal function, if possible.
• No convincing data to suggest any particular volume expander
or vasopressor is better or worse for the kidneys, although
balanced crystalloid solutions are increasingly recommended
(hydroxyethylstarch has also previously been implicated in i AKI).
• Avoid renoprotective strategies that lack an evidence base, e.g.
low-dose dopamine is NOT recommended (b p. 144).
• X There is no measurable superiority of either intermittent HD
(IHD) or CVVHDF, including outcomes for renal recovery, in
critically ill AKI patients, although management of ﬂuid balance is
often easier with continuous therapies.
• X ‘High-dose’ CVVHF (aiming for an UF rate of 45mL/kg/min over
25mL/kg/min) does not demonstrably improve outcomes.
• X A larger delivered IHD dose (e.g. daily treatment) may not
improve outcomes but may have beneﬁts over thrice weekly HD in
terms of ﬂuid and electrolyte management.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Renal replacement therapy in AKI
Introduction
X Opinions differ regarding indications, timing, what technique to use,
what ‘dose’ to give, and when to stop.

Indications
Since evidence is currently lacking, it is principally a matter for clinical
judgement, based on the patient's clinical condition, trends in laboratory
tests, and the potential for swift recovery of renal function.
The indications are distinct from those applied to CKD. In general, the
clinician must carefully consider what goals they want to achieve with RRT
in an individual patient with AKI.

Absolute indications
• 3 Hyperkalaemia:
• There is no universally agreed K+ concentration. A helpful
rule: consider urgent dialysis if K+ ≥6.5mmol/L or rapidly rising,
regardless of ECG changes (particularly if not responding to
other interventions, such as insulin and glucose).
• 3 Volume overload:
• Pulmonary oedema in an oligo-anuric patient with an inadequate
response to diuretics.
• Volume status is an important determinant of outcome in AKI
and should be afforded a high priority in this setting.
The remaining indications for dialysis are urgent, rather than emergent. This
can be an important distinction—depending on local resources, it may be
preferable to delay dialysis and perform it as a planned daytime procedure
under adequate supervision and with multidisciplinary support.

When to start RRT
• There is limited evidence to support an earlier start to RRT in AKI, e.g.
at lower values of urea (<25–30mmol/L or 70–85mg/dL), the onset of
oliguria, and certainly well before ‘classical’ indications supervene.
• However, the beneﬁts of this practice (in terms of survival, duration of
AKI, and renal recovery) are not clear-cut.
• Clinicians have a general tendency, perhaps extrapolated from their
CKD care, to wait as long as possible before dialysis initiation.
• The recent KDIGO guidelines sensibly recommend a pragmatic
approach and to ‘consider the broader clinical context, the presence
of conditions that can be modiﬁed with RRT, and trends of laboratory
tests—rather than single Ur or SCr thresholds alone’.

RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY IN AKI

Relative indications
• Acidosis (pH <7.2), especially if haemodynamically unstable, or
where volume overload precludes IV bicarbonate administration.
• There is evidence that myocardial enzymes are dysfunctional with
pH <7.2 l higher risk of arrhythmia.
• Critically unwell patients (usually in an HDU/ITU setting):
• To maintain ﬂuid balance and allow safer administration of ﬂuid,
feeding, blood and blood products, antimicrobials, and drugs.
• Uraemic complications:
• Rare for these to be a signiﬁcant factor in AKI. If you are waiting
for these before initiating dialysis, then you are waiting too long!
• Uraemic pericarditis or encephalopathy.
• Uraemic symptoms, especially once Ur >40mmol/L (112mg/dL) (1
there is no absolute ﬁgure that equates with ‘uraemia’, and there is
considerable interpatient variation in ‘biochemical tolerability’).
• Diuretic-resistant cardiac failure.
• Poison or toxin removal (lithium, ethylene glycol, etc.) (b p. 906).
• Hyperthermia.

Why delay RRT—the potential complications
• Complications of dialysis access insertion (b p. 180).
• Haemodynamic strain or overt hypotension in an already sick patient
(X which may then perpetuate AKI).
• Electrolyte imbalances, e.g. rapid reduction of K+ (1l arrhythmias).
• Complications of anticoagulation (b p. 182).
• Dialysis disequilibrium (b p. 177).

When to stop RRT
• Requires regular (at least daily) assessment.
• Average duration of RRT in AKI is 712 days.
• Assessment of underlying renal function during RRT can be difﬁcult.
It is often particularly uncertain for intermittent haemodialysis (IHD)
where variable rebound in Ur, SCr, and electrolytes may occur
between treatments.
• An increase in urine output is particularly helpful, although the use of
diuretics will need to be factored in (routine administration of diuretics
to i UO and facilitate earlier cessation of RRT is not recommended).
• Trends in SCr, Ur, and electrolytes need to be carefully considered
(and allowance made for non-renal confounding factors, such as the
patient's catabolic state and volume status).
• Theoretically, serial measurements of urinary Cr excretion might be
helpful but are very rarely undertaken in practice.
• Cessation of RRT does not have to be an absolute. It might be prudent
to initially adjust the duration and frequency of treatment or to
consider a modality change (e.g. step down from CRRT on ITU to IHD
on a renal unit).
• On occasion, particularly in a critical care setting, more fundamental
issues concerning the futility of further treatment will need to be
included in the decision-making.

173

174

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

RRT in AKI: modalities
Introduction
The ideal modality of RRT in AKI is unknown. In practice, the choice will
be based primarily upon: (i) the availability of different treatments and (ii) a
patient's haemodynamic status and overall clinical condition. PD use in AKI
is infrequent, except in paediatric practice and in areas where resources
are constrained (b p. 188). The treatments are not mutually exclusive,
with changes between them dictated by clinical circumstances.

Modalities
Generally, intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) is preferred on renal units
whilst continuous techniques (CRRT), such as continuous veno-veno haemoﬁltration (CVVHF), continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD),
continuous veno-veno haemodiaﬁltration (CVVHDF), and sustained
low-efﬁciency dialysis (SLED), are more often encountered in high
dependency and critical care environments.
Intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) (see Fig. 2.16)
• Solute clearance mainly by diffusion across semi-permeable membrane.
• Pores in the membrane allow small molecules (e.g. Ur (MW = 60Da),
Cr (113Da)) and electrolytes but not larger ones (e.g. plasma proteins
(albumin 60,000Da, IgG 140,000Da) or blood cells) to pass through.
• Dialysate (physiological solution of electrolytes) is required.
• Concentration differences across the membrane allow molecules to
diffuse down a gradient. This allows waste products to be removed
and desirable molecules or ions (e.g. HCO3–) to be replaced.
• Diffusion is maximized by maintaining high-ﬂow rates of blood
and dialysate and by pumping the two through the dialyser in
countercurrent or opposite directions.
• Usually administered intermittently (e.g. 4h, 3x/week), although the
delivery in AKI may differ from this (b see chapter 4).
• Water can be driven through the membrane by hydrostatic force
(ultraﬁltration or UF). The pressure gradient across the membrane
(transmembrane pressure or TMP) can be controlled to vary the
amount of water removed (but usually <3–4L in a 4h treatment).
Haemoﬁltration (HF) (see Fig. 2.16)
• Solute clearance by convection (mainly), i.e. ﬂuid shifts across the
dialysis membrane also allow solutes to cross (‘solute drag’).
• Achieved by generating a TMP across the membrane.
• Large volumes need to be ﬁltered to achieve adequate solute
clearance. This would cause hypovolaemia, unless replacement ﬂuid
is administered—usually pre-prepared 5–10L bags (during IHD, HF is
used to remove ﬂuid that has accumulated between treatments 6 no
ﬂuid replacement is necessary). No dialysate is required.
• Removes larger MW (30–50kDa) molecules (e.g. vitamin B12 and B2
microglobulin) more efﬁciently than dialysis. X May also remove pro(and anti-) inﬂammatory cytokines.
• Delivered as a continuous, rather than intermittent, technique.

RRT IN AKI: MODALITIES

IHD modiﬁcations (e.g. SLED)
• This essentially refers to treatments using standard dialysis equipment
but for a longer treatment than the ‘traditional’ 4h.
• Both IHD and CRRT machines can be adapted easily for this purpose.
• Sustained low-efﬁciency dialysis (SLED) uses extended (e.g. 6–12h)
treatments with blood and dialysate ﬂows of between 100–300mL/min.
• The aim of SLED is to improve tolerability over IHD.
• The ‘low-efﬁciency’ tag is misleading—it is often commendably efﬁcient.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

RRT in AKI: choosing modality?
Introduction
One size does not ﬁt all. No single modality of RRT is ideal for all patients
in all situations. It is 6 important to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of available techniques and to tailor treatment to a particular
clinical context. The treatments should not be considered competitive
but complementary. It should also be acknowledged that availability may
inﬂuence choice to a greater or lesser extent.

Advantages and disadvantages
CRRT
• Advantages: slower ﬂuid removal (l haemodynamic stability);
continuous (6 improved) ﬂuid balance (including greater overall
capacity for ﬂuid removal); gentler solute control (l slower ﬂuid shifts
and d risk of cerebral oedema); adjustable as clinical circumstances
evolve; relatively simple equipment.
• Disadvantages: continuous anticoagulation (b p. 182); immobilized
patient; risk of hypothermia; potential higher cost.
IHD
• Advantages: faster correction of electrolyte abnormalities and toxin
removal (6 potential advantage for ii K+, poisoning, tumour lysis,
rhabdomyolysis); rapid ﬂuid removal; allows mobilization (l less muscle
wasting and respiratory infection) and time for other investigations and
interventions to take place; fewer bleeding complications; transfer to a
high dependency environment is usually unnecessary; several patients can
be treated with the same equipment each day; possible reduced cost.
• Disadvantages: haemodynamic instability; dialysis disequilibrium
(b p. 177); less overall control of ﬂuid balance and less adaptability;
technically more complicated.
Hybrid treatments
The aim of treatments, such as SLED, is to share the advantages whilst
minimizing disadvantages of both CRRT and IHD.

Evidence
Several RCTs have compared CRRT to IHD in the context of AKI.
However, a clear demonstration of the superiority of either technique
has proved elusive, e.g. a Cochrane collaboration meta-analysis analyzed
15 studies involving 71500 patients and concluded that outcomes were
similar in terms of mortality, length of hospital stay, and renal recovery.
X An often debated beneﬁt of CRRT is a favourable effect on renal
recovery (as a by-product of improved haemodynamic stability).
However, whilst reduced progression to ESRD has been suggested by a
few observational studies, all controlled trials and meta-analyses to date
have failed to demonstrate a consistent beneﬁt of CRRT.
Comparative studies between SLED and CRRT demonstrate similar
outcomes, particularly with respect to haemodynamic tolerability.

RRT IN AKI: CHOOSING MODALITY?

General guidance
• In the patient with haemodynamic instability, CRRT is preferred
to standard IHD. CRRT is also preferred in patients with AKI who
cannot tolerate ﬂuctuations in ﬂuid status (e.g. cardiogenic shock).
• In a critically ill patient with multi-organ involvement, particularly
in an HDU/ITU setting, the adaptability of CRRT means that it is
generally preferred to IHD.
• CRRT is preferred for a patient with acute brain injury where IHD
may worsen neurological status (d BP + cerebral oedema ld
cerebral perfusion pressure).
• CRRT is preferred in combined liver-kidney failure (possible
advantage for prevention of i intracranial pressure).
• SLED may be better tolerated than IHD, particularly if other forms
of CRRT are unavailable.

Dialysis disequilibrium
• A syndrome thought to be s to cerebral oedema: blood Ur
drops rapidly during dialysis but slower both in the intracellular
compartment and within the blood–brain barrier. This results
in water inﬂux into the brain and cerebral oedema (9 cerebral
acidosis).
• Usually occurs in the context of AKI on a background of CKD.
• 3 Rare if ﬁrst dialysis prescription/precautions observed
(b p. 178).
• Those with Ur >60mmol/L (168mg/dL) at particular risk.
• Symptoms (during or shortly after dialysis): nausea, dizziness,
headache, visual disturbance, agitation, confusion, d GCS, and
seizures.
• 2 Exclude hypoglycaemia, d Na+, drug toxicity (has a renally
excreted drug stayed at the same dose despite a dramatic reduction
in kidney function, e.g. antibiotics?), and intracerebral bleeding.
• Prophylaxis: observation of ﬁrst dialysis prescription/precautions is
mandatory. Phenytoin 15mg/kg loading dose, then 200–300mg/d, is
no substitute for applying these but has been used.
• Treatment: stop dialysis, and supportive care (improvement should
occur within 24h). Seizures: mannitol 10–15g IV (raises plasma
osmolality) and diazepam 9 phenytoin.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

RRT in AKI: prescription
2 Remember: the dialysis staff have considerable expertise and are likely
to know a great deal more than you can possibly learn from this book.

Intermittent HD
• Time:
• 1 Rapid overcorrection of uraemia may cause the syndrome of
dialysis disequilibrium (b p. 177), so initial treatment aims for
partial correction of uraemia only (d Ur ≤30%).
• A guide: 1st session l 2h, 2nd l 3h, and subsequent l 3–4h.
• Blood ﬂow:
• Relatively slow, 7150–200mL/min (i by 50mL/min/session to
300–400mL/min).
• Frequency:
• Ur rebound is common, so aim to dialyse daily against symptoms
and chemistry (1 beware i K+) for the ﬁrst 2–4d.
• Catabolic patients (e.g. sepsis) may need to remain on a daily
regimen for longer.
• Dialyser:
• Small dialyser (≤1.2m2) preferable (b p. 284).
• Fluid removal or ultraﬁltration (UF):
• 2 Assessment of volume status is crucial.
• Hypovolaemia: administer saline (e.g. 1–2L) prior to, and during,
dialysis—no UF.
• Euvolaemia: no UF.
• Overload: up to 2–3L can be removed over 2h, depending on
haemodynamic status, progress and stability of the patient. If
further ﬂuid removal is desirable (patient remains in pulmonary
oedema with satisfactory BP), then it can be removed through
‘isolated UF’ (l dialysate ﬂow is turned off, leaving ﬂuid
removal, rather than biochemical control, as the p treatment
goal). 1 Note: UF without dialysis can still cause hypotension
and CV instability.
• Anticoagulation (b p. 182):
• Use minimal or no heparin, as necessary, to prevent clotting in the
extracorporeal circuit.
• AKI patients are at high risk of bleeding (b p. 138) e.g. GI
haemorrhage, unintentional arterial puncture during line insertion,
i BP, pericarditis (which may l haemorrhagic tamponade).
• Dialysate (b p. 282):
• Bicarbonate buffer is preferred to lactate.
• Lactate l liver metabolism l HCO3–. However, lactate may
accumulate in multi-organ failure, esp. in patients with liver failure
(d clearance) or shock (i production) l worsening acidosis.
• Dialysate Na+ of 145mmol/L is typical. If serum Na+<125mmol/L,
use a dialysate Na+ ≤20mmol/L higher to avoid rapid correction.
• Serum K+ decides dialysate K+. 1 Overcorrection l arrhythmias.
(See Table 2.11.)

RRT IN AKI: PRESCRIPTION

• Haemodynamic tolerability of IHD:
• Measures to help improve this: (i) prime circuit with saline; (ii) stop
vasodilator therapy (if possible); (iii) dialysate Na+≤10mmol/L above
plasma Na+ (up to 150mmol/L); (iv) dialysate Ca2+ 1.35–1.5mmol/L;
(v) dialysate K+ as in Table 2.11 (use highest possible); (vi) cooled
dialysate (35–37°C); (vii) minimum UF clinical status allows.

CRRT
• Time:
• Continuous.
• Blood ﬂow:
• Usually 150–200mL/min.
• Filter:
• High-ﬂux (synthetic) membrane.
• Fluid removal:
• UF rates of 10–45mL/kg/h are typical. Fluid removal is achieved by
the UF rate exceeding replacement ﬂuid administration per hour
(e.g. net 100 or 200mL UF/h).
• Replacement ﬂuid (usually supplied in 5L bags) contains:
• Buffer: bicarbonate is preferred to lactate.
• K+: generally 0–4mmol/L and adjusted to serum K+.
• Also Na+ (132–140mmol/L), Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cl–.
• Note: replacement ﬂuid is not the same as dialysate.
• Anticoagulation:
• Heparin, citrate, or epoprostenol (b pp. 182–7).

SLED
• Time:
• Usually 5–12h.
• Blood ﬂow:
• Blood and dialysate ﬂows of between 100 and 300mL/min.
• Dialyser:
• Standard IHD dialyser.
• Fluid removal:
• Prolonged treatment time allows more UF than IHD.
• Anticoagulation:
• Heparin. Circuits potentially more prone to clotting than IHD.
• 1 Drugs:
• Guidelines for appropriate drug-dosing in RRT are usually for
IHD or CRRT. As SLED will potentially provide more effective
clearance than IHD, caution is necessary before extrapolating such
recommendations. Speak to your pharmacist.

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Vascular access
• Type:
• An uncuffed, double-lumen dialysis catheter (‘temporary line’ or
vascular catheter) is acceptable for periods of <7 days.
• If >7 days, consider a cuffed (and tunnelled) double-lumen catheter
(not in ICU).
• Route:
• 1 Avoid the subclavian veins (l more difﬁcult insertion and i
incidence of central venous stenosis).
• Jugular: often the route of choice, although a volume-overloaded
patient may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to lie ﬂat during insertion. Left-sided
jugular lines are technically more difﬁcult to insert.
• Femoral: no need to wait for a CXR post-insertion in emergent
situations. However, i infection risks, reduced mobility, increased
risk of DVT.
• Insertion:
• For insertion technique, see b p. 936.
• 2 The beneﬁts of insertion under ultrasound guidance have
been clearly demonstrated (fewer attempts necessary, quicker
procedure, better catheter position, fewer complications).
• Precautions:
• Strict adherence to infection control policies. This includes, but
goes signiﬁcantly beyond, a sterile technique at insertion—catheter
aftercare is just as important.
• CXR prior to the use of jugular (or subclavian) lines.
• Review ongoing need for, and function of, access regularly—
remove or replace, as necessary.
• Beware recirculation (b p. 297) with temporary lines, particularly
short catheters in the femoral vein. Optimal lengths:
• 12–15cm right internal jugular.
• 15–20cm left internal jugular.
• 19–25cm femoral.
• 3 Complications of central venous catheterization. These should be
explained to the patient (and audited regularly):
• Unsuccessful insertion (10–20%).
• Arterial puncture (<6%).
• Haematoma (<5%).
• Haemothorax (<1%).
• Pneumothorax (<3%).

RRT IN AKI: PRESCRIPTION

Adequacy (‘dose’)
The optimal ‘dose’ of RRT in AKI (and how best to measure it) is
unknown. In addition, the actual delivered dose of RRT often falls short of
that intended or prescribed (reasons: haemodynamic instability, variations
in BMI, access malfunction, technical difﬁculties, ﬁlter or dialyser clotting,
and patient disconnection, e.g. for other interventions or investigations).
Measurement
Although routinely used for the assessment of dialysis adequacy in CKD
(b p. 286), Kt/V for urea has less utility in AKI where patients are
more metabolically unpredictable, particularly with respect to urea
production.
Many clinicians aim for a consistent blood Ur (post-dialysis Ur for
IHD), e.g. <25mmol/L or even <15mmol/L.
Overall, the goals of RRT prescription in AKI should 6 be more holistic, aiming to achieve the optimum electrolyte, acid–base, and ﬂuid balance that are appropriate for a particular clinical circumstance. This may
require continuous reassessment and adjustment.
Guidelines
There is currently no evidence that increased RRT dose in AKI improves
outcomes with respect to either mortality or renal recovery. However,
KDIGO recommended the following:
IHD: a cumulative weekly Kt/V of 3.9, e.g. Kt/V 1.3 for each treatment on
a 3x/week dialysis prescription.
CRRT: ﬁltration volume of 20–25mL/kg/h. For the reasons given earlier,
this is likely to require a prescribed dose in the range of 25–30mL/kg/h.

High-dose RRT in sepsis
• X There has been interest in high-dose RRT in the context of AKI
and septic shock.
• It is postulated that removal of proinﬂammatory cytokine removal
might be important.
• Limited data suggest potential beneﬁt, particularly in terms of the
vasopressor doses required to maintain MAP in these patients.
• In the IVOIRE trial, there was no evidence that high volume HF at
70mL/kg/h, compared with contemporary standard volume HF at
35mL/kg/h, leads to a reduction in 28-day mortality, or contributes
to early improvements in haemodynamic proﬁle or organ function.
• Cytokine removal may not only be through UF, but also via
adsorption on the ﬁlter membrane (potentially increasing costs,
as the ﬁlter becomes cytokine-saturated and requires regularly
changing).
• It seems likely that anti-inﬂammatory cytokines are just as likely to
be removed as their proinﬂammatory counterparts.
• High-dose CRRT means ﬁltration volumes in the range of 65mL/kg/h.
• Cytokine removal can also be achieved with IHD and SLED, using
special high-ﬂux (i.e. large pore size) membranes.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

RRT in AKI: anticoagulation
Introduction
Contact between blood and the dialysis circuit l coagulation pathway
and platelet activation l clotting. This reduces treatment efﬁciency and
causes blood loss. Prevention requires concomitant anticoagulant therapy,
which introduces a bleeding risk and increases technical complexity. (See
Fig. 2.18)

Patient factors
• Anticoagulant therapy can be individualized to the patient.
• Patients with pre-existing coagulation issues (e.g. thrombocytopenia,
liver disease) will be at higher risk from therapeutic anticoagulation.
• AKI patients may already be anticoagulated for an underlying condition
(e.g. ACS, AF) and 6 not require additional treatment.
If anticoagulation is not possible, other measures (and nursing skill) can
prevent or delay thrombosis, e.g. satisfactory vascular access, pre-ﬁlter
ﬂuid replacement for CRRT, regular saline ﬂushes, i blood ﬂow, and
immediate attention to equipment alarms.

Intermittent haemodialysis
Unfractionated heparin
• Remains the most widely used anticoagulant for IHD (see also
b p. 290).
• Dose and target ACT/APTT can/should be patient-speciﬁc.
• Advantages: vast experience with use; widely available; short half-life;
reversible with protamine; tests required for monitoring (APTT, ACT)
are usually readily accessible; relatively low cost.
• Disadvantages: narrow therapeutic index; drug kinetics often
unpredictable; HIT; heparin resistance (s to d antithrombin levels in
the critically ill), (page 184).
LMW heparin
• Use in AKI has increased, as experience has grown in chronic IHD.
• 1 LMWH relies on renal elimination, so AKI patients are at i risk of
accumulation and bleeding (b p. 138).
• Doses lower than those familiar from therapeutic anticoagulation, e.g.
enoxaparin (0.5mg/kg) single bolus at start of IHD.
• 1 Caution if patient also receiving LMWH for thromboprophylaxis
(consider combining at the start of dialysis to achieve two goals).
• Intermittent measurement of anti-factor Xa activity desirable with
prolonged, or daily, use.
• Advantages: simple regimen; more predictable drug kinetics; consistent
anticoagulant effect; less monitoring usually necessary; d risk of HIT.
• Disadvantages: accumulation; measurement of anti-factor Xa activity
may not be available; incomplete reversal by protamine; higher cost.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

CRRT
Heparin
• Unfractionated heparin widely used. Usually a pre-ﬁlter infusion, e.g.
15–30IU/kg, followed by maintenance 5–15IU/kg/h (1 the relationship
between dose, APTT, circuit longevity, and bleeding is complicated).
• LMWH is less popular for CRRT and requires factor Xa monitoring.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
• HIT is an immune phenomenon. Antibodies react against the
heparin: platelet factor 4 complex on platelets (l clumping,
activation, and thrombosis).
• Incidence: <3% of heparin-treated patients.
• Consequences: severe thrombocytopenia 9 thrombosis (usually
within 5–10d of heparin use).
• Treatment: stop all heparin (LMWHs are not safe in this context).
Usually resolves within 1–2 weeks.
• In patients undergoing RRT with heparin, monitor the platelet count
and suspect the diagnosis if repeated circuit clotting occurs.
• If ongoing anticoagulation for RRT is required, alternatives include:
• Citrate (b p. 186).
• Argatroban (direct thrombin inhibitor, hepatic elimination, short
half-life, continuous infusion, monitored with APTT).
• Factor Xa inhibitors (e.g. danaparoid, fondaparinux).
• Epoprostenol.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

RRT in AKI: citrate regional
anticoagulation
• Citrate regional anticoagulation is an increasingly popular means of
anticoagulation for CRRT. (See Fig. 2.19)
• Citrate forms a complex with ionized calcium (iCa2+), thereby
eliminating a crucial constituent of the coagulation cascade.
• Citrate reaching the systemic circulation is metabolized (liver, muscle,
kidney), releasing calcium and generating bicarbonate.
• Low or zero calcium dialysate/replacement solutions are required, and
separate calcium infusions prevent d Ca2+.
• Advantages: d bleeding; d transfusion requirement; longer circuit
patency; generation of HCO3.
• Disadvantages: citrate accumulation l acidosis; d Ca2+ (esp. liver
impairment or shock); d Mg (citrate binds to Mg); risk of metabolic
alkalosis; i Na+ (trisodium citrate); technically much more
complicated.

Procedure
• Citrate (e.g. 4% trisodium citrate) is infused into the ‘arterial’ side of
the haemoﬁlter circuit, for example:
• 90mL of stock 46.7% trisodium citrate in 1L 5% dextrose.
• Infused at 175–350mL/h, depending on blood ﬂow.
• Different protocols use different concentrations of calcium, e.g. 0.75%
calcium chloride infused concomitantly into central vein:
• 80mL of 10% calcium chloride in 1L normal saline.
• Infuse at 760mL/h.
• Circuit and systemic total and iCa2+ are measured hourly until stable
and then 4–6h.
• Aim to maintain circuit iCa2+ 0.25–0.35mmol/L and systemic iCa2+
0.9–1.23 mmol/L. Titrate citrate infusion to circuit iCa2+ and calcium
infusion to systemic iCa2+.
• Total systemic Ca2+ (and total to ionized ratio) will rise if citrate
accumulates.

CHAPTER 2

Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) in AKI
Rarely used for AKI in Europe and North America but an important treatment worldwide. Until recently, it was also the most popular technique
for the treatment of AKI in children.

Potential advantages
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

No need for a specialist renal set-up.
Technical aspects and apparatus are relatively straightforward.
Minimizes haemodynamic instability (making ﬂuid removal easier).
Gentle correction of biochemical abnormalities.
No need for vascular access or systemic anticoagulation.
Glucose in PD ﬂuid increases caloric intake.
Low cost.

Potential disadvantages
• Bowel perforation during catheter insertion (esp. if previous surgery l
adhesions).
• 1 Infection: peritonitis and catheter exit site.
• Poor clearance: relatively slow correction of uraemia and i K+,
particularly in catabolic patients.
• Unpredictable UF rate (interpatient variability).
• Protein and amino acids lost in dialysate.
• Catheter problems: migration, poor inﬂow/outﬂow, leakage.
• Abdominal distension l diaphragmatic splinting l respiratory
compromise.
• Hyperglycaemia (PD ﬂuid uses glucose to generate hypertonicity).
• Contraindicated by recent abdominal surgery.
• Diaphragmatic splinting with respiratory compromise.

Catheter placement
Semi-rigid (‘stab PD’)
Pros: inserted at the bedside under LA (usually via a Seldinger technique).
Cons: non-cuffed, therefore, high infection rates. Uncomfortable and easy
to dislodge. Higher incidence of bowel perforation. Usually requires
removal after 48–72h (l repeated insertions often necessary).
Cuffed catheter (similar to those used in chronic PD)
Pros: cuff prevents bacterial migration 6d infection rates. Softer catheter
so more comfortable with less risk of bowel perforation. More compatible
with automated cyclers.
Cons: insertion requires more expertise (although LA still possible).

PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (PD) IN AKI

PD vs IHD or CRRT for AKI?
Studies are limited. Comparisons have suggested a worse outcome for
PD than for CVVHF—though second-rate PD equipment (rigid catheters, home-made ﬂuids, acetate buffer, no automated cyclers) are often
judged against ﬁrst-rate CVVHF technology in highly catabolic patients.
However, PD cannot be considered a front-line treatment for AKI in
most settings but may be lifesaving if HD/CRRT unavailable.

Prescribing acute PD
• Commercially available dialysate solutions preferable. Warm to body
temperature prior to infusion.
• A correctly positioned catheter should allow inﬂow and outﬂow
times of <10–15min. Both proceed under gravity. Ensure complete
drainage (remember: more drains out than in if UF has occurred).
• Dwell times of 1h are typical (<30min a waste of time and effort).
• With non-cuffed rigid catheters, peritonitis risk i dramatically after
72h. Cuffed catheters offer uninterrupted treatment.
• Aim for 20–24 exchanges/day (although often logistically difﬁcult).
• Record the number of exchanges and ﬂuid input:output.
• Continuous equilibrium PD (CEPD), which is similar to standard
CAPD, is an alternative. Dwell times are 4–6h, allowing more time
for solute equilibration between blood and dialysate. Less time
‘hands on’ the catheter ld risk of infection.
• Dialysate volume: most patients tolerate 2L exchanges. Larger
volumes (up to 3L) can l catheter leaks, hernias, and diaphragmatic
splinting.
• Dialysis dose is increased by i dialysate volume 9i exchange
frequency.
• Fluid balance. If the patient is euvolaemic, mildly ﬂuid-overloaded,
or haemodynamically unstable, a 1.5% dextrose concentration
(‘light bag’) is appropriate. Check the subsequent drainage volume
to assess UF. Use this ﬁgure, in combination with repeated clinical
assessment, to direct the need for higher dextrose concentrations
(usually 2.5% or 4.25%).
• Heparin (200–500U/L) can be added to the dialysate to prevent
plugging of the catheter with ﬁbrin clots. It is not absorbed
systemically.
• Commercial PD solutions do not usually contain K+, so if the patient
is hypokalaemic or the serum K+ is rapidly falling, potassium chloride
may be added (usually 2–4mmol/L).

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

What is chronic kidney disease (CKD)?
Deﬁnition
The NKF KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Dialysis Outcomes
Quality Initiative) classiﬁcation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been
rapidly adopted internationally.1 It is simple and useful and has help to raise
awareness of kidney disease. CKD is divided into ﬁve stages, according to
estimated GFR. (See Table 3.1.)
Table 3.1 NKF KDOQI classiﬁcation of CKD

†

Early CKD is not diagnosed on eGFR alone. There must also be evidence of kidney damage
(see rest of table). Patients with an eGFR of 60–89mL/min without kidney damage do not
have CKD.
*
The subdivision of stage 3 into 3A and 3B is not part of the original KDOQI classiﬁcation
but has been advocated by other organizations (e.g. NICE in the UK). It reﬂects the higher
incidence of cardiovascular disease and complications (e.g. anaemia) that are more prevalent,
as eGFR falls below 45mL/min.

• Patients with a GFR >60mL/min should not be considered to have
CKD, unless there is concomitant evidence of kidney damage:
• Urinary abnormalities (proteinuria, haematuria).
• Structural abnormalities (e.g. abnormal renal imaging).
• Genetic disease (e.g. APKD).
• Histologically established disease.
• The reduced eGFR and/or urinary abnormalities should ideally be
present on at least two occasions ≥3 months apart.
• It has been suggested that the sufﬁx (p) is added to the CKD stage to
indicate the presence of proteinuria (uACR ≥30mg/mmol or uPCR
≥45mg/mmol). This helps to highlight the i risk of both progression
and CV disease (e.g. stage 3p).
• Chronic renal failure (CRF) is now an outmoded term that indicates an
irreversible decline in GFR.

WHAT IS CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD)?

• 3 The majority of patients with CKD stages 1–3 do not progress to
kidney failure. The risk of death from CV disease is far higher than the
risk of progression (b p. 198).

Causes of CKD
Accurate data on the causes of early CKD are scarce. Registry data
focuses on causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As only a relatively
small number progress (and live long enough) to reach dialysis or transplantation, it is difﬁcult to extrapolate back to early CKD. Recent UK
and US causes are shown in Table 3.2, but there is considerable variation
worldwide.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Prevalence of CKD
• The exact prevalence of CKD in the general population remains
unknown.
• A large UK study in primary care suggested an age-standardized
prevalence of stages 3–5 CKD of 8.5% (10.6% in 5 and 5.8% in 4).
• Over 19 million of the US adult population are thought to have
some form of CKD.
• The most common associations are i BP, diabetes, and vascular disease.
• In the UK study just mentioned, the age- and gender-adjusted odds
ratios were 2.1 for i BP, 1.33 for diabetes, and 1.69 for CV disease.
• CKD prevalence rises dramatically with age—from 78 pmp age <40 to
5,900 pmp age >80.
• Early stages appear common, so the base of the pyramid in Fig. 3.1
should actually be drawn much wider, with a much narrower peak.
• These colossal estimates of prevalence have led to CKD being
proposed as an important public health issue.
• CKD is more common in many ethnic minorities, e.g. in association
with diabetes in South Asian and hypertension in black people.
Additional genetic factors are also likely to play a role in the relative
over-representation of certain ethnic groups in ESRD programmes.
• Many cases of early CKD are unrecognized.
• Many cases of advanced CKD are unknown to specialist renal services.

CV risk.

PREVALENCE OF CKD

Criticisms of the KDOQI classiﬁcation
Although the 2002 classiﬁcation is now ubiquitous, it is not without its
problems. Criticisms include the following:
• The classiﬁcation sets out to identify risk yet labels as a disease.
• It deﬁnes disease on a laboratory variable alone, with no clinical
assessment or correlation.
• Many patients will be caused unnecessary anxiety.
• Many live kidney donors have an eGFR <60mL/min
post-nephrectomy. Do they have a disease?
• The MDRD eGFR equation was validated in subjects with renal
disease and yet is being used to evaluate subjects without it.
• The equation is not sufﬁciently validated for differences in age, race,
and body habitus.
• MDRD tends to underestimate true GFR (yet the values are
generally unconditionally accepted).
• The vast estimates of CKD prevalence offered by the classiﬁcation
are unrealistic and should be viewed as distribution values for eGFR
in a particular population, rather than true disease prevalence.
• The classiﬁcation does not take account of the age-related change in
GFR. Many view this as natural senescence, not pathology (725% age
>70 have an eGFR <60mL/min and 6 kidney ‘disease’).
• The eGFR bands used to deﬁne stages are arbitrary:
• Stage 3: a 25-year-old proteinuric 4 whose renal function has
rapidly deteriorated to an eGFR of 30–35mL/min.
• Stage 3: a 75-year-old 5 with no other evidence of kidney disease
and a stable eGFR of 55–59mL/min.
• Identical stage notwithstanding, the implications for these
individuals are very, very different.
• Is it a useful CV risk assessment tool? Although there is an association
between d eGFR, proteinuria, and CV risk, a causal link is unproven.
Also, this relationship mainly operates at eGFR <45mL/min.
• The classiﬁcation implies progression from one stage to the next. In
reality, this does not occur. Stage 3 seldom progresses to 4 or 5.
• It deﬁnes normal function as >90mL/min and disease as <60mL/min.
Neither is particular satisfactory nor evidence-based.
• It does not give enough weight to microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria,
which may be better markers of CV risk (especially in early stages).
• Many laboratories do not report a value for eGFR when >60mL/min,
removing any justiﬁcation for separating stages 1 and 2.
• Large numbers have been diagnosed with early CKD—this has
diverted specialist time away from kidney failure and its treatment.
• The term CKD should be reserved for persistent, irreversible
renal pathology, not just reductions in eGFR—unless there are
pathophysiological consequences, such as anaemia or altered salt and
water homeostasis (often not present until eGFR <30mL/min).
• It has been suggested that percentile charts of eGFR in healthy
individuals of both sexes, across all ages, and in different populations
should be used to deﬁne an abnormal eGFR.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Diagnosis of CKD
2 Always assume a d eGFR represents acute kidney injury until proven
otherwise. Is there a historical eGFR for comparison? Has there been a
recent illness or change in medication? If uncertain, repeat within 5 days,
and seek specialist help, as necessary.

Why is it important to identify patients with CKD?
• CKD is associated with i CV risk. Modifying CV risk factors (2 i BP)
would be expected to d morbidity and mortality.
• Some patients will beneﬁt from further investigation (e.g. renal
biopsy) to identify a potentially treatable intrinsic renal disease
(e.g. glomerulonephritis) or renal involvement in a systemic illness
(e.g. myeloma).
• Whatever the underlying cause, it may be possible to slow or prevent
progression to kidney failure.
• Complications (e.g. anaemia) can be identiﬁed and treated early.
• Those (relatively few) patients who will go on to kidney failure and
potentially need dialysis or transplantation can be adequately prepared.
• Patients with CKD are at higher risk of acute kidney injury. This is
often preventable (e.g. after IV contrast administration).

eGFR for diagnosis and management of CKD
• Serum creatinine (SCr) has a non-linear relationship with GFR. In early
CKD, SCr may remain within the ‘normal’ range and be misleading.
• eGFR is calculated from formulae that adjust SCr for age, sex, and race.
• The most widely used (and foundation of the KDOQI classiﬁcation)
is the Modiﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation since it
appeared the most reliable and reproducible in individual patients.
• More recently, the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration pooled study
data to produce the CKD-EPI equation. This provides a more accurate
assessment of GFR in individuals with normal or only slightly d GFR.
This results in lower estimates of CKD prevalence and more accurate
prediction of adverse outcomes.
• Most laboratories will routinely report an MDRD eGFR, although
the use of CKD-EPI is likely to increase. Formulae are available
at: M http://www.renal.org/eGFRcalc or M http://www.kidney.org/

MedCalc, QxMD, MedMath, Epocrates (fee-requiring).
• Normal GFR is 7100mL/min/1.73m2, so eGFR gives a (very) rough
percentage of kidney function.
Cautions
• It is only an estimate (conﬁdence intervals are wide; 90% of patients
will have a GFR within 30% of their eGFR).
• eGFR is likely to be inaccurate at extremes of body habitus
(malnourished, obese) as well as in amputees and during pregnancy.
• It is not fully validated in age <18.
• Race: only validated in Caucasians and black people though probably
acceptable utility in South Asians ( check whether your lab corrects
for race, otherwise use a correction factor of x 1.21 for black patients).
• It is not validated if the GFR is rapidly changing (e.g. AKI).

DIAGNOSIS OF CKD

• The MDRD equation tends to underestimate normal renal function.
CKD-EPI is more reliable in this situation.
• It is less accurate in individuals with very poor kidney function.

Screening for CKD?
There is no evidence that screening of the general population for CKD
saves lives or money. Screening can be targeted at those at highest risk.

Who
•
•
•
•
•
•

i BP.
Diabetes mellitus.
CCF.
Atherosclerotic disease (coronary, cerebral, peripheral).
Possible renal involvement in multisystem disease (e.g. SLE, myeloma).
Urological problems: bladder outﬂow obstruction, neurogenic
bladder or diversion surgery; renal stone disease.
• Chronic nephrotoxin use (e.g. NSAIDs, lithium, ciclosporin, ACE-I).
• Urologically unexplained haematuria.
• Unexplained oedema.

How
• eGFR, BP, urinalysis for blood 9 protein, uACR, or uPCR (annually).

Proteinuria
Why is proteinuria so important?
• It is a marker of chronic kidney damage.
• It has prognostic value in the progression of CKD.
• It may itself cause progression of CKD (X).
• It is a helpful surrogate treatment target.
• It is an independent CV risk factor.
Detection and quantiﬁcation of proteinuria
• Dipstick: if ≥1+, send MSU to exclude UTI, and repeat after 2 weeks.
• All with an eGFR <60mL/min (and high-risk patients in stages 1 and 2)
should have their urinary protein excretion quantiﬁed. (See Table 3.3.)
• 24h collection unnecessary. Send spot sample (preferably early morning).
• The relationship between uACR and uPCR is non-linear.

• uACR is more sensitive for early disease and favoured in many
guidelines, esp. as an initial test. uPCR is adequate for monitoring.
• uACR ≥2.5mg/mmol (4) or ≥3.5mg/mmol (5) represents
microalbuminuria (still a marker of early renal disease and associated
with an i CV risk, particularly in diabetes and i BP).

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

2 Cardiovascular disease in CKD
CKD patients are at higher risk of CV events, including coronary disease,
CCF, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (see Table 3.4). Both d eGFR
and proteinuria (itself a marker of generalized endothelial dysfunction)
are independently (and additively) associated with adverse CV outcomes.
Even those with early CKD are at increased risk—most will die a CV death
before progressing to kidney failure. (See Table 3.4.)

among a population with chronic kidney disease in a large managed care organization. Arch
Intern Med, 164, 659–63.

Take 100 patients with an eGFR <60mL/min. 71% will progress to kidney
failure each year. However, there is a 10% death rate (mainly CV disease),
so, after 10 years, 8 patients will require RRT, 27 will have ‘smouldering’
CKD, and 65 will be dead!
2 An estimated 8 million people in the USA have an eGFR <60mL/min.
Those that survive to start RRT do so with a high CV disease burden.
• Dialysis patients are 720x more likely to die a CV death than the
general population.
• A cardiac cause is implicated in >40% of all deaths at ESRD.
• ESRD 5-year survival (UK data): age 18–34 is >90%; age 45–54 is
70%; age 65–74 is 30%; age >75 is <20%.

Managing risk factors
• X Good evidence for the beneﬁt of many interventions in CKD
patients is lacking—it is often inferred by extrapolation from the
non-CKD population.
• Lifestyle advice:
• Encourage exercise.
• Offer smoking cessation help and advice.
• Healthy diet; adequate nutrition.
• Meticulous BP control (<130/80): use ACE-I and ARB to d proteinuria.
• Management of lipids, usually with a statin:
• Evidence of beneﬁt for lipid-lowering therapy in CKD is limited.
• For example, the Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse (4D) study showed
no beneﬁt from cholesterol reduction by atorvastatin in dialysis
patients with T2DM. Explanation: competing CV risk may ‘drown
out’ the beneﬁt of statins in this very high-risk group.
• Similarly, AURORA, a RCT of 2,776 HD patients comparing
rosuvastatin vs placebo, showed no beneﬁt of LDL reduction against
a composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI- and non-fatal stroke.

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN CKD

• However, SHARP, an RCT of 9,438 CKD (dialysis or CKD) with
no history of MI or CV revascularization, compared simvastatin +
ezetimibe against placebo, ﬁnding a 17% reduction in major vascular
events after mean 4.7 years’ follow-up.
• Recent guidelines, including those for non-CKD populations (e.g. those
produced by the American Heart Association/American College of
Cardiology), have moved away from traditional numeric targets for
primary and secondary prevention towards the estimation of risk
as the basis for treatment (usually a statin). This is also the case in
KDIGO lipid management guidelines for CKD (2013). See b p. 205.
Glycaemic control; HbA1c <7.0% (if diabetic–but see b p. 612).
Aspirin 75mg daily for s prevention unless contraindicated.
Appropriate CKD-MBD management (d vascular calciﬁcation).
Appropriate anaemia management (d LVH).
Adequate dialysis.
No current evidence for homocysteine reduction using folic acid.
Ongoing interest in antioxidant therapy (e.g. vitamin E and
acetylcysteine) but no compelling evidence to date.

Cardiovascular risk factors
Traditional cardiovascular risk factors more common in CKD
• Hypertension (almost always present).
• Diabetes (common cause of CKD).
• Dyslipidaemia: CKD ld HDL, i IDL, i pro-atherogenic lipid
particles, and i oxidation of LDL (all promote atherogenesis).
• Obesity and reduced physical activity.
Risk factors common in (or unique to) advanced CKD
• Arteriosclerosis.
• Diastolic dysfunction.
• Vascular calciﬁcation (and cardiac valvular calciﬁcation).
• Proteinuria.
• Volume overload.
• Anaemia (b p. 216).
• Higher Hb targets on ESA therapy (b p. 226).
• Oxidant stress:
• i Reactive oxygen species.
• d Antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E).
• Inﬂammation (b p. 261).
• Malnutrition (b p. 260).
• Vitamin D deﬁciency (b p. 251).
• Accumulation of advanced glycation end-products.
• LVH (a strong predictor of mortality in ESRD).
• Hyperparathyroidism.
• Myocardial ﬁbrosis and abnormal myocyte function.
• Carnitine deﬁciency.
• Hyperhomocysteinaemia.
• Asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) retention.
• Reduced nitric oxide bioavailability.
• Insulin resistance.
• Renin–angiotensin system activation.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Pathogenesis of CKD
Progression of CKD
Once CKD is established, it tends to progress, regardless of the underlying
cause. Decline in GFR tends to be linear over time, unless clinical circumstances change. Progression of CKD is more often due to s maladaptive
haemodynamic and metabolic factors than underlying disease activity (see
Fig. 3.2). A series of interacting processes eventually results in:
• Glomerulosclerosis (glomerular scarring and obsolescence).
• Proteinuria.
• Tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis.

Mechanisms
Raised intra-glomerular pressure
• As nephrons scar and ‘drop out’, remaining nephrons undergo
compensatory adaptation, with i blood ﬂow per nephron and
hyperﬁltration attempting to ‘normalize’ GFR (the Brenner hypothesis).
• Changes in glomerular capillary wall permeability are a feature of
glomerular diseases.
• Renal vasodilatation may be an initiating event, with the glomerulus
exposed to a higher capillary pressure.
Glomerular damage
• i intra-glomerular pressure li wall stress and endothelial injury.
• i strain on mesangial cells li matrix deposition mediated (in part) by
angiotensin II and cytokine release (TGF-B, PDGF).
Proteinuria may be due to an underlying glomerular lesion or result from
raised intra-glomerular pressure. Protein or factors bound to ﬁltered albumin (such as fatty acids, growth factors, or metabolic end-products) may
lead to:
• Direct proximal tubular cell injury.
• Local cytokine synthesis (l recruitment of interstitial inﬂammatory
cells).
• Pro-ﬁbrotic factors l interstitial scarring.
• Myoﬁbroblast activation and tubular epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) occur, further fuelling the ﬁbrogenic process.
Tubulointerstitial scarring
• The degree of tubulointerstitial damage correlates better with
long-term prognosis than glomerular damage.
• Proteinuria may itself be harmful to the tubulointerstitium, but chronic
ischaemic damage is also important: tissue O2 tension is relatively
low in the renal medulla, making tubules sensitive to hypoxic injury.
Chronic ischaemia 6 occurs with:
• Damage to glomerular capillaries (glomerulosclerosis l altered
peritubular perfusion).
• RAS activation l intrarenal vasoconstriction.
• Intratubular capillary loss and i diffusion distance between
capillaries and tubular cells (l a vicious cycle of hypoxic damage).

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Progression of CKD: general
Deﬁning progression
Arbitrary, but progression may be deﬁned as a decline in eGFR of
>5mL/min in 1 year or >10mL/min in 5 years (in the absence of other
causes of an acute deterioration).

Factors inﬂuencing CKD progression
Non-modiﬁable
• Underlying cause of kidney disease (tubulointerstitial disease tends
to progress more slowly than glomerular disease).
• Race (progression faster in black patients).
Modiﬁable
• BP.
• Level of proteinuria.
• Plus:
• Exposure to nephrotoxic agents.
• Underlying disease activity (e.g. SLE, vasculitis).
• Further renal insults (superimposed obstruction, UTI).
• Hypovolaemia or intercurrent illness.
• Dyslipidaemia.
• Hyperphosphataemia.
• Metabolic acidosis.
• Anaemia.
• Smoking.
• Glycaemic control (if diabetic).

What can be done to prevent or slow progression?
Identify any potentially modiﬁable underlying cause
• Helps determine prognosis.
• Is speciﬁc intervention/treatment possible, e.g. immune suppression in
immunologically mediated renal disease, relief of obstruction?
• History: systemic disease (e.g. SLE, myeloma), lower urinary tract
symptoms, stone disease, review all medications.
• Examination: BP, hypovolaemia, atherosclerosis, palpable bladder,
stigmata of inﬂammatory disease.
• Investigation: urinalysis (haematuria and/or proteinuria may suggest a
renal or systemic disease that could beneﬁt from speciﬁc intervention),
USS renal tract, renal biopsy.
Inﬂuence mediators of progression
• There is considerable overlap in the measures employed to prevent
progression and those used to modify CV risk (b p. 202).
• In addition, these often dovetail with a patient’s existing treatments for
CV disease, diabetes, or hypertension.
• This enables an integrated management programme to be developed
that is easy for the patient (and physician) to understand and administer.

PROGRESSION OF CKD: GENERAL

Preventing progression: blood pressure
• i BP is almost universal in CKD and may be both cause or effect.
• i BP l glomerular ﬁltration pressure and i proteinuria li renal injury.
• BP control unequivocally slows progression of CKD and is the main
renoprotective strategy.
• A large body of evidence supports the use of ACE-I and ARBs as
ﬁrst-line antihypertensives in both diabetic and non-diabetic CKD,
particularly if concomitant proteinuria. These agents:
• d efferent arteriolar tone ld intra-glomerular pressure and d
proteinuria.
• d A2 activity l A2-induced inﬂammation ld ﬁbrosis and scarring.
• ACE-Is affect both angiotensin type 1 (A1) and type 2 (A2)
receptors but may not completely inhibit A2 formation.
• ARBs block A1, but not A2, receptors.
• BP targets are more stringent in CKD (and lower still for patients with
proteinuria). (See b p. 204.)
• The stringent application of current evidence would result in:
• ACE-I for renoprotection in: (i) T1DM and microalbuminuria
or overt diabetic nephropathy; (ii) T2DM with i BP or
microalbuminuria; (iii) non-diabetic CKD with proteinuria 0.5g/day.
• ARBs for renoprotection in T2DM and microalbuminuria or overt
nephropathy.
• Few studies have directly compared ACE-I and ARB treatment in CKD.
• Combination ACE-I and ARB therapy (‘dual blockade’) reduces BP and
proteinuria to a greater extent than monotherapy but has not been
shown to d CKD progression (see also b p. 614).
• There is often reluctance to use ACE-I in more advanced CKD
because of fears of i K+ or a rapid fall in GFR. However, evidence
suggests that the beneﬁt of ACE-I therapy is present, regardless of the
initial level of renal function.
• X There is evidence that dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
(e.g. nifedipine and amlodipine) may adversely effect the progression
of CKD through effects on the renal microcirculation. They should
6 be avoided as ﬁrst-line treatment but are frequently used as part
of combination therapy (particularly in patients taking beta blockers
where non-dihydropyridine CCBs are best avoided).

Starting an ACE-I or ARB in CKD
• Clinical trials show a good safety proﬁle, even in higher CKD stages.
• Ensure patient is well hydrated.
• Avoid NSAIDs:
• If on diuretic therapy, consider reducing diuretic dose for 48h,
and request ﬁrst dose is taken at bedtime.
• Check eGFR and K+ before and 3–5 days after.
• Expect (and allow) a rise in SCr or d eGFR of up to 20%, but
recheck within 2–4 weeks.
• If K+ >5.5mmol/L, assess diet and other medications.
• Stop if K+ >6.0mmol/L.
• Measure K+ and eGFR during intercurrent illnesses.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Progression of CKD: antihypertensives
in CKD
Antihypertensives in CKD: a suggested batting order

Expect to need ≥2 agents (warn the patient this is likely to be the case).
• First, limit Na+ intake (<100mmoL/day), and recommend other lifestyle
measures (b p. 259).
• ACE-I (especially if uPCR >100mg/mmol or uACR >70mg/mmol).
• Loop diuretic (e.g. furosemide) if evidence of salt and water overload.
• Thiazide diuretics may be effective in early CKD.
• Add ARB if uPCR remains >100mg/mmol or uACR >70mg/mmol.
• Calcium channel blocker:
• If a beta blocker is likely to be necessary, then use dihydropyridine
CCB (e.g. nifedipine, amlodipine); if not, then a non-dihydropyridine
(e.g. diltiazem) is preferred.
• Beta blocker (e.g. atenolol, bisoprolol).
• Alpha blocker (e.g. doxazosin).
• Centrally acting agent (e.g. moxonidine).
• Vascular smooth muscle relaxant (e.g. minoxidil).

Blood pressure targets in CKD
KDIGO
• Recommend a BP target <140/90mmHg for non-diabetic,
nonproteinuric CKD patients.
• Target <130/80mmHg if proteinuria (>30mg/24h) whether diabetic
or not.
• Tailor treatment regimes for individual elderly patients by carefully
considering age, co-morbidities and other therapies. Escalate
treatment carefully under appropriate supervision.
UK Renal Association and NICE recommend:
• Without proteinuria (uPCR <100mg/mmol or uACR <70mg/mmol):
• Target 140/90mmHg (NICE suggest target range for SBP
120–139mmHg and DBP <90mmHg).
• With proteinuria (uPCR >100mg/mmol or uACR >70mg/mmol):
• Target 130/80mmHg (NICE suggest target range for SBP
120–129mmHg and DBP <80mmHg).
• Diabetes mellitus:
• Target 130/80mmHg.
• d Reduction of proteinuria should also be seen as an important
• Therapeutic goal (target uPCR <50mg/mmol or uACR <30mg/mmol).
Others
Recent international guidelines for hypertension from nonnephrological bodies, such as ESH-ESC (and JNC 8 – in preparation), have, or are
expected to, suggest that the evidence for lower treatment targets, such
as <130/80mmHg, in the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and
CKD is not currently robust (see b pp. 464–8).
For example ESH-ESC (2013) suggests all patients (apart from the
elderly) should be treated to a SBP of <140mmHg.

PROGRESSION OF CKD: ANTIHYPERTENSIVES IN CKD

Dyslipidaemia
• In addition to placing CKD patients at i risk of CV disease (b p. 198),
lipid abnormalities may also accelerate progression.
• Potential mechanisms: mesangial cell proliferation, cytokine expression,
LDL oxidation to reactive O2 species.
• Treatment has attenuated renal injury in animal models.
• Patchy evidence from clinical trials ( statins only—not ﬁbrates).
• Recent guidelines, including those for non-CKD population (such as
those produced by the American Heart Association/American College
of Cardiology) have moved away from numeric targets for 1° and 2°
prevention and towards the estimation of CV risk.
• The KDIGO lipid management guidelines for CKD (2013) suggest:
• Adults aged ≥50 years with eGFR <60 mL/min (not on RRT) are
treated with a statin (or statin/ezetimibe combination) (evidence
graded 1A).
• Adults aged ≥50 years with CKD and eGFR≥60 mL/min are treated
with a statin (graded 1B).
• Adults aged 18–49 years with CKD (not on RRT) are statin treated
if one or more of the following is present (graded 2A).
— Known coronary disease (MI or revascularization).
— Diabetes mellitus.
— Prior stroke.
— Estimated 10-yr incidence of coronary death or MI >10%.
• Initiation of statin treatment is not recommended for adults on
dialysis (2A).
• Patients receiving statins (or statin/ezetimibe) at the time of dialysis
initiation should continue treatment (2C).
• Statin treatment is suggested for transplant recipients (2B).
•  Statin side effects are more common in CKD. Myalgia and a small
rise in creatine kinase common. 2 More rhabdomyolysis reported.
Liver function abnormalities also more common.

Hyperphosphataemia (b p. 246)
Calcium phosphate deposition in the renal interstitium may contribute
to progression of CKD, strengthening the argument for good control of
mineral homeostasis in these patients.

Anaemia
ESA treatment may d progression. Robust evidence is lacking.

Acidosis
• Experimentally, acid in the nephron l complement activation and
interstitial damage.
• A recent RCT has shown that administration of oral sodium
bicarbonate signiﬁcantly slows CKD progression vs placebo.3
• 134 patients, CrCl 15–30mL/min, baseline bicarbonate 16–20mmol/L
• Dose: 600mg tds, increased to achieve a bicarbonate of 23mmol/L
(500mg capsules are also widely available).
• 2-year follow-up (exclusions: CCF, uncontrolled i BP).

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Drugs, toxins, and infections
Once CKD is established, remaining kidney function is highly susceptible
to further (often irreversible) damage. 2 Avoid:
• Hypovolaemia, obstruction, recurrent UTIs.
• Nephrotoxins: drugs (e.g. NSAIDs), radiocontrast.

Smoking
Smoking li proteinuria and CKD progression in both diabetic and
non-diabetic CKD, adding to the already overwhelming beneﬁts of smoking cessation. Patients should be offered practical help and support to quit.

Diabetes
Poor glycaemic control is a major determinant of the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The evidence is stronger for T1DM.
• T1DM: in the DCCT trial, intensive treatment was associated with less
microalbuminuria and d progression to macroalbuminuria. In addition,
the EDIC/DCCT follow-up study cohort has suggested lowering
HbA1c preserves GFR in the long term.
• T2DM: in the UKPDS study, intensive treatment led to a d incidence
of microalbuminuria, and other studies have shown reduced
progression to macroalbuminuria. UKPDS also demonstrated a
reduced decline in GFR.
• However the ADVANCE and ACCORD studies suggested that
intensive treatment of hyperglycemia in T2DM does not always
lead to an acceptable risk/beneﬁt ratio. These studies involved
large populations and used aggressive tactics for glycaemic control.
Participants had strong CV risk proﬁles (including prior events) and
were at high risk of future events. Microvascular end points, including
renal outcomes, were improved in both studies. However, primary
CV outcomes were not improved by intensive glycaemic therapy
and, in ACCORD, intensive treatment was associated with a 22%
increase in all-cause mortality; i.e. intensive glucose lowering in highrisk populations, later in the course of T2DM, delivered only a weakly
protective effect on CV outcomes.
• KDOQI practice guidelines recommend maintaining HbA1c at <7%.
However, some authorities suggest a target between 7–8% in higher
risk patients later in the course of their disease.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Progression of CKD: miscellaneous
Vitamin D
• Vitamin D has many important paracrine functions, with roles in
immunity, inﬂammation, vascular and cardiac function, and insulin
resistance.
• In the kidney, it inﬂuences mesangial cell and podocyte proliferation,
downregulates RAS (via renin inhibition), prevents glomerular
hypertrophy, decreases cytokine production, reduces inﬂammation,
and blocks epithelial to mesenchymal transition.
• There is experimental (and limited clinical) evidence that it may
ameliorate proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial
ﬁbrosis.
• Optimum replacement strategies, however, remain unclear
(see b p. 250).

Dietary protein restriction
• d Protein intake in animal models protects against glomerulosclerosis.
• Appears to d intra-glomerular pressure and d glomerular hypertrophy.
• Non-haemodynamic effects, such as d TGF-B and d matrix
accumulation, may also be important.
• In humans, the beneﬁt of protein restriction is controversial.
• Although progression may be slowed, a huge investment is required by
both patients and dietetic staff. Long-term compliance is often poor.
• At present, optimal dietary protein intake in CKD is uncertain.
• X A reasonable regimen is an intake of 70.8–1.0g/kg of protein/day.
Lower levels may risk malnutrition (particularly in advanced CKD or
with nephrotic range proteinuria).
• Diabetic nephropathy may be more responsive.

Preventing progression—what’s on the horizon?
• Endothelin receptor blockade ld BP, d renal vasoconstriction,
d proteinuria, and d tissue damage in experimental diabetic
nephropathy.
• Vasopeptide inhibitors ld vasoconstrictors (A2) + i vasodilators
(natriuretic peptides and bradykinin).
• Renin inhibitors. Available as antihypertensives. Theoretical beneﬁt
would be through aggressive RAS blockade. However, the ALTITUDE
study, designed to determine if a renin inhibitor could reduce CV and
renal morbidity and mortality in T2DM when added to conventional
treatment (including ACE-I or ARB), was stopped early after more
frequent adverse events were reported in the treatment arm.
• Mineralocorticoid receptor activation l interstitial ﬁbrosis + vascular
damage. Antagonism (eplerenone/spironolactone) may 6 be beneﬁcial.
• Sulodexide, an orally active glycosaminoglycan, reduces proteinuria and
is under evaluation in clinical trials.
• Pirfenidone and hepatocyte growth factor are antiﬁbrotic and show
experimental promise.
• BMP-7 antagonizes TGF-B and inhibits the pro-ﬁbrotic epithelial to
mesenchymal cell transition.

PROGRESSION OF CKD: MISCELLANEOUS

• The anti-inﬂammatory, antioxidant, and possibly antiﬁbrotic molecule
bardoxolone methyl was associated with an early improvement in eGFR
in advanced diabetic nephropathy. Unfortunately, the subsequent
international BEACON trial was terminated, following the reporting of
excess of adverse events in the treatment arm.

The cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)
• A newly described syndrome of interdependency. Each dysfunctional
organ can initiate and maintain disease in the other through common
haemodynamic, neurohormonal, and immunological pathways.
• Five subtypes have been suggested, describing the scenarios in which
CRS can occur (and deﬁning the p and s organ in each case) (see
Table 3.5).
• Signiﬁcant controversy and debate around this topic remains.
• Cardiac + renal failure = magniﬁcation of poor outcomes:
• Renal failure is as powerful a prognostic marker in CCF as
ejection fraction (EF) or NYHA status.
• i SCr on admission with CCF predicts longer hospital stay, i risk
of ITU admission, and i mortality.
• In parallel, patients with CKD are much more likely to manifest
CV disease than the non-CKD population (b p. 198).

Pathophysiology
• The traditional view that d GFR in CCF is simply a consequence
of impaired renal blood ﬂow (RBF) s to impaired LV function is
correct, in part, although a gross oversimpliﬁcation.
• d RBF l RAS stimulation l Na+ and water retention.
• A2 li cardiac pre- and afterload and i myocardial O2 demand.
• A2 also promotes NADH and NADPH oxidase activation l
oxidative stress, d NO (l endothelial dysfunction), vascular
inﬂammation, and ﬁbrosis (both cardiac and renal).
• Chronic sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation ld
adrenoceptor sensitivity, i LVH, and i myocyte apoptosis.
• Elevated venous pressures l intra-abdominal hypertension l further
d renal perfusion.
• Anaemia is common and integral to a progressive vicious cycle of
organ dysfunction. EPO itself may exert anti-apoptotic effects
(b p. 219).

Management
• A heterogeneous group, often excluded from major trials.
• Diuretics and ACE-I are key components of management but
may further d GFR. Physician anxiety means they are often not
prescribed—further inﬂuencing outcomes. Close monitoring is
essential.
• The role of IV iron and ESAs remains contentious (b p. 226).
• Future: inotropes, ultraﬁltration for diuretic resistance, AVP
antagonists, adenosine A1 antagonists, and BNP analogues have
variably been shown to improve symptoms, if not overall outcomes.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Advanced CKD: the uraemic syndrome
Uraemia is the metabolic and clinical syndrome caused by a substantial
fall in GFR—it is not a result of i blood urea concentration, but rather
of failure to eliminate many potentially toxic small and middle molecules.
This leads to chronic inﬂammation and oxidative stress, with accumulation
of metabolic end-products, accelerated atherogenesis, disruption of the
immune system, and anaemia. The retained compounds or toxins have
multiple effects:
• Many remain unidentiﬁed.
• They are divided into ‘low’ and ‘middle’ molecular weight molecules by
size (<500Da = low; >500Da = middle).
• Ur and SCr are routinely measured but are not directly toxic. They
act as markers for other LMW substances, including guanidines, such
as asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA)—a potent inhibitor of NO

• Retained middle molecules include:
• B2 microglobulin (12,000Da)—a component of MHC (the cause of
dialysis-related amyloid).
• Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)—products of
non-enzymatic breakdown of sugars. Also retained in normal ageing
and diabetes. Linked to atherogenesis and susceptibility to infection.
• Complement factor D—may activate the complement system and
contribute to chronic inﬂammation.
• Cytokines—may maintain uraemic chronic inﬂammation and

more important).

Uraemic cardiomyopathy
Not the result of one speciﬁc uraemic toxin but of a combination of
factors:
• i Arterial stiffness.i phosphate l vascular smooth muscle cell
transdifferentiation into osteoblast-like cells, causing vascular medial
calciﬁcation. This leads to arteriosclerosis, d arterial compliance,
and i pulse pressure. This is analogous to the arterial changes seen
in the elderly but premature. The result is i cardiac workload and
worsening LVH and diastolic dysfunction.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Complications of advanced CKD
Fluid overload
Salt and water overload is usual in advanced CKD. However, as tubulointerstitial scarring progresses, loss of concentrating ability may l ﬁxed (and
often large) urine volumes and a relative salt-losing state. Such patients
may be chronically hypo-, rather than hypervolaemic, and require salt and
water supplementation (e.g. NaHCO3 0.5–1.5g PO tds and increased ﬂuid
intake).

Treating salt and water retention in CKD
2 Careful clinical assessment of volume status.
• Restrict dietary salt (b p. 259).
• Restrict ﬂuid intake.
• Start furosemide 40mg PO od, and titrate as necessary (max. 250mg
daily).
• Loop diuretics do not have a particularly smooth dose-response
curve—a diuresis/natriuresis will not occur until a threshold is
reached. This means a patient not responding to 40mg furosemide
should have the dose, rather than frequency dosing, increased, i.e. i
to 80mg once daily, rather than 40mg twice daily.
• If poor response, consider thiazide diuretic (metolazone 2.5–10mg
od) for synergistic effect.  Diuresis may be brisk. Beware d Na+, d
K+, and volume depletion (consider admission).
• Monitor:
• Daily weight—the best day-to-day guide of salt and water status.
Ask the patient to keep a diary of their weight at home. Weight
loss should generally be ≤0.5–1kg/day.
• BP (esp. postural d BP if overdiuresed).
• A rise in Ur 9 SCr may restrict dose escalation. If Ur >25mmol/L,
consider dose reduction (or cessation), depending on
clinical need.
•  Refractory volume overload may signal the need for renal
replacement therapy.

Hyperkalaemia
d Na+ delivery to the distal convoluted tubule ld aldosterone-mediated
Na+/K+ exchange and d K+ excretion. 2i K+ is a common, and potentially
life-threatening, problem in advanced CKD. Rapid rises in K+ are generally
more dangerous than gradual ones, as cell membrane stability is more
vulnerable to acute changes. The widespread use of ACE-I, ARBs, and,
more recently, mineralocorticoid antagonists, such as spironolactone, is
changing the natural history of CKD-related hyperkalaemia. It is increasingly common, with awareness more important than ever.

COMPLICATIONS OF ADVANCED CKD

When to worry about the K+ level . . . ?
Depends on context and chronicity.
• 5.5–6.0mmol/L: recheck routinely. Review medications. Arrange
dietary advice.
• 6.1–6.5mmol/L: recheck urgently. Review medications (withhold
ACE-I, ARB, spironolactone). Arrange dietary advice.
• >6.5mmol/L: 2 consider admission. Treat as an emergency.

Measures to prevent i K+
• Dietary restriction (b p. 259).
• Diuretics: a loop diuretic (e.g. furosemide 40–160mg PO od) may
promote urinary K+ loss (thiazides may be less effective).
• Drug withdrawal or dose reduction if taking an ACE-I or ARB. Review
other contributory drugs (e.g. spironolactone, beta blockers, NSAIDs).
• Correct acidosis (see Box 3.1).
•  Refractory i K+ may indicate the need for dialysis.

Acidosis (b p. 820–823)
Systemic effects of acidosis
• Bone. i bone resorption and impaired mineralization, contributing to
renal osteodystrophy (b p. 234).
• Metabolism. Muscle weakness, fatigue, sense of ill-health.
• Effects of respiratory compensation (b p. 820). Overventilation; may l
symptoms of dyspnoea 9 exhaustion.
• Hyperkalaemia. Aldosterone-mediated exchange of H+ for K+ is
enhanced in the collecting duct li K+. Acidosis also lessens K+ ingress
via cell membrane Na+/K+ pumps.
• Ionized calcium.i ionized (free) calcium (acidosis ld albumin-bound
fraction).  Correction of acidosis may ld Ca2+ and provoke tetany.
• Nutrition. Acidosis promotes catabolism by induction of proteolysis and
resistance to growth hormone (l malnutrition).

Box 3.1 How to correct acidosis?
• Treat when venous HCO3– is <21mmol/L.
• Give NaHCO3 0.5–1.5g/tds as capsules, or 0.6–1.8g tds as tablets
(start at low dose, and titrate).
•  Na+ load may cause or worsen ﬂuid overload. Consider
concomitant loop diuretic.
•  Refractory acidosis is an indication for dialysis.

•

Common; prevalence and severity increase as GFR falls (see Table 3.6).
Typically normochromic, normocytic, with normal WCC and platelets.
Associated with reduced quality of life and poorer prognosis.
Erythropoietin (EPO) deﬁciency is the dominant, but by no means the
only, cause (see Box 3.2).
The introduction of human recombinant erythropoietin (hrEPO or
epoetin) 720 years ago completely transformed management. Prior
to this, recurrent transfusion was the norm (l iron overload, risk
of blood-borne viruses, and sensitization to foreign antigens—with
implications for transplantation).
Newer therapeutic agents still aim to stimulate red cell production via
the EPO receptor but may not be based on recombinant EPO. The term
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) has been introduced to reﬂect this.
Increasing numbers of early CKD patients—and virtually all dialysis
patients—receive an ESA.
Black and diabetic patients tend to have higher rates of anaemia for
each CKD stage.
The target range for Hb is lower than the normal physiological range,
e.g. 10–12g/dL (UK Renal Association).
X Randomized trials have found i CV complication rate with higher
Hb targets—so optimal treatment strategies remain uncertain
(b p. 226).
Patients receiving ESAs invariably need concomitant iron therapy—and
iron alone may be sufﬁcient to correct anaemia in some (b p. 230).
CKD patients require different targets for iron parameters from
non-CKD individuals to facilitate optimal red cell production (b p. 230).
The success of ESAs in CKD has led to their use to treat anaemia in
other contexts, particularly chemotherapy-associated anaemia (X ESAs
have been associated with i thromboembolic events and d survival in
cancer patients and could theoretically stimulate tumour growth).
The cost of anaemia management is substantial.

ANAEMIA AND CKD

Box 3.2 Differential diagnosis of anaemia in CKD patients
2 EPO deﬁciency is not the only cause of d Hb in CKD.
Think of the following before commencing ESA therapy and particularly if disproportionate anaemia or ESA resistance (b p. 223):
• Blood loss:
• Peptic ulcer disease, GI vascular ectasia.
• d red cell survival:
• Inﬂammation + oxidative stress + uraemic toxins l RBC
membrane and cytoskeletal damage.
• Haemolysis
• Related to dialysis:
• Blood loss during treatment (‘lost lines’).
• Haemolysis: contaminated dialysate, hypo-osmolar or overheated
dialysate, residual sterilizing agents, trauma in blood pump, high
ﬂow through narrow gauge needles.
• Haematinic deﬁciency:
• Iron deﬁciency.
• B12 or folate deﬁciency.
• Impaired bone marrow response:
• Chronic infection or inﬂammation.
• Uraemic toxins (? underdialysis).
• Hyperparathyroidism (l marrow ﬁbrosis).
• Carnitine deﬁciency.
• Aluminium overload; now rare (b p. 247).
• Malnutrition.
• Relating to underlying or unrelated disease:
• Myeloma.
• Myelodysplasia.
• Sickle cell disease or other haemoglobinopathy.
• SLE.
• Autoimmune haemolysis.
• Coeliac disease.
• Occult malignancy.
• Hypothyroidism.
• Relating to treatment:
— Poor compliance with ESA therapy or incorrect dosing.
— Immune suppression.
— ACE-I (several mechanisms, including: d endogenous EPO
production and d angiotensin II stimulation of erythroid
precursors). Rarely mandates cessation of treatment.
— Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) (b p. 225).

217

218

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

EPO and the kidney
• RBC production is tightly regulated by a number of growth factors,
including EPO—a 165 amino acid-secreted glycoprotein (with four
complex carbohydrate side chains) that is required for terminal
erythrocyte maturation.
• EPO differs importantly from other hematopoietic growth factors
because it is produced in the kidney—speciﬁcally by the peritubular
interstitial ﬁbroblasts in the outer medulla and deep cortex.
• Hepatic EPO production is also important in fetal, but not adult, life.
• The kidney is ideally placed to regulate RBC production, as it is
uniquely able to sense and control both O2 tension and circulating
volume (and to differentiate between the two):
• Control of red cell mass is mediated by EPO.
• Circulating volume is regulated by renal salt and water excretion.
• CKD and renal scarring ld functioning renal tissue ld EPO synthesis
ld RBC production l anaemia.
• Exceptions (where EPO may be overproduced) are: APKD, benign
renal cysts, renal cell carcinoma, and chronic hypoxia.

EPO production
(See Fig. 3.3)
• If GFR is normal, plasma EPO levels are inversely proportional to Hb
concentration. This relationship breaks down in CKD (where EPO
levels are usually inappropriately in the normal range).
• Anaemia or d environmental O2ld blood O2 content l
O2-dependent gene expression li EPO secretion.
• Central to this are the hypoxia inducible transcription factors HIF-1
and HIF-2.
• HIF-1 and 2 have an O2-regulated A subunit and constitutively
expressed B subunit.
• In states of normal O2 tension, intracellular HIF-1 and 2 are continuously
inactivated by (iron-dependent) proline hydroxylation of their A subunit.
• Once hydroxylated, they are targeted by the von Hippel–Lindau
protein (pVHL) for ubiquitinization and proteasomal degradation.
• In hypoxic conditions, A subunit hydroxylation and degradation do
not occur, and HIFA remains free to enter the nucleus and form a
heterodimer with HIFB.
• The HIFA + HIFB heterodimer binds the hypoxia response element
(HRE) and initiates EPO transcription.
• Several mechanisms exist to regulate EPO production, including
the GATA family of transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor
4 (HNF-4) and haematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP-1). All are
potential therapeutic targets (b p. 221).
• During hypoxia, HIF activity is induced in multiple cell types where it
activates a panoply of target genes (>100), including those involved in
angiogenesis and glycolysis. Genetic mutations in the HIF pathway are
responsible for certain congenital polycythaemias.
• Activation of the EPO receptor (EPO-R) prevents erythroid cell
apoptosis through downstream JAK2/STAT5 signalling pathways.

EPO beyond anaemia: cytoprotection
• In addition to the role of EPO in the regulation of erythropoiesis,
there is increasing interest in its potential anti-apoptotic and
cytoprotective effect.
• The EPO-R is widely distributed (e.g. neurons, cardiac myocytes,
endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and mesangial cells), and expression is
increased in response to hypoxic injury.
• It is hoped this might be therapeutically exploited and that
exogenous ESA administration might offer protection from injury in
various clinical scenarios.
• This concept has been successfully explored in numerous animal
models of tissue injury, particularly ischaemia reperfusion (including
nervous system, cardiac, and renal).
• There are currently a number of trials in progress in a variety
of clinical settings, including traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid
haemorrhage, myocardial infarction, cardiopulmonary bypass, renal
transplantation, sepsis, and many others.
• However, a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial of an IV ESA
in early acute ischaemic stroke reported more deaths in the group
receiving the ESA.
• Short-acting ESAs with retained cytoprotective, but reduced
erythropoietic, effects are under development.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Erythropoiesis-stimulating
agents (ESAs)
At present, no evidence distinguishes ESAs in terms of clinical efﬁcacy.
All have similar issues around cost, complexity of manufacture, routes of
administration, storage requirements and potential immunogenicity.
See Table 3.7 for dosing information.

Short-acting
Epoetin α and β. EPO-A (Eprex®, Epogen®, or Procrit®) and EPO-B
(NeoRecormon®) have been in use for 720 years and are clinically indistinguishable. Both are synthesized in transformed Chinese hamster ovary
cells and have identical amino acid sequences (if different glycosylation patterns). Other recombinant epoetins have emerged, sharing the 165-amino
acid structure, e.g. epoetins omega and delta.
Biosimilar agents. The term biosimilar is used to describe a generic
product that is deliberately similar to molecules already in clinical use.
Manufacturers submit data suggesting their agent is chemically and pharmacokinetically identical to a reference drug (usually EPO-A or -B).
Clinical data generated with the original is then extrapolated to the new
product. The reduced R&D and marketing costs ensure products are commercially competitive, e.g. epoetin-zeta (Retacrit®).

Long-acting
Darbepoetin α (Aranesp®). Recombinant EPO with a twist: ﬁve amino
acids are substituted away from the EPO-R binding site to allow the insertion of two carbohydrate side chains. This signiﬁcantly increases circulating
half-life.

ERYTHROPOIESIS-STIMULATING AGENTS (ESAs)

Continuous EPO receptor activator (CERA). Methoxy polyethylene glycol
epoetin B (Mircera®) incorporates a large polymer chain to increase its
MW to 760kDa (EPO: 30.4kDa). Half-life is increased (considerably) to
130h, and it can rapidly dissociate from the EPO-R after binding.

ESAs: future developments
Alternative methods of ESA administration: aerosol, mucosal, transdermal, and oral are currently drawing much attention.
New ESAs
• EPO fusion proteins:
• Contain additional C-terminal peptides to i half-life.
• EPO-EPO: two EPO molecules joined via a polypeptide bridge.
• GM-CSF-EPO: provides two haematopoietic growth factors at once.
• Fc-EPO: incorporates the Fc region of human IgG to promote
cellular recycling and i half-life.
• CTNO 528 is an EPO-mimetic antibody fusion protein, with no
structural similarity to EPO but erythropoietic effects.
• Synthetic erythropoiesis protein (SEP):
• 51kDa protein-polymer construct that activates the EPO-R. Long
half-life.
• Peptide-based ESAs:
• Unrelated in sequence to EPO but able to bind the EPO-R and
induce intracellular signalling.
• Peginesatide (formerly hematide) is a pegylated dimeric peptide
ESA currently in phase III clinical trials. It has been successfully
used to treat patients with PRCA (b p. 225).
• Manufactured by a relatively simple process, less immunogenic,
and stable at room temperature.
• Administered IV/SC x1/month.
• Currently awaiting FDA approval.
• Non-peptide ESAs:
• Offer potential for oral administration.
• Prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF stabilizers).
• Prevent the hydroxylation and inactivation of HIFA (b p. 218).
• Problem: many other genes are regulated by prolyl hydroxylation.
• HIF stabilizer FG-4592 currently in clinical trials.
• GATA inhibition:
• GATA are a family of transcription factors. GATA-2 is a negative
regulator of EPO gene expression, so its inhibition is of interest.
• Haemopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP) inhibitors:
• HCP is a tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates JAK-2 and
functions as a negative regulator of intracellular EPO signalling.
• Gene therapy:
• Various delivery systems, such as adenovirus transfection, are
under investigation. EPO could be released into the circulation at
any site and by any cell type. Regulation of expression is likely to
be the greatest obstacle to this approach.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Prescribing ESAs
When to start?
Consider an ESA when Hb <11g/dL (local protocols may vary).
X There is uncertainty as to the optimum time to commence ESA therapy.
Does a numerical Hb threshold decide the best time, or would an earlier
start prevent CV complications? ESAs have previously been thought of as
safe and effective—but recent evidence suggests you can have too much
of a good thing (b p. 226). UK Renal Association guidelines 6 recommend that treatment should be reserved for patients who are likely to
beneﬁt from improved quality of life or physical function and to avoid
transfusions. They remain relatively underprescribed in CKD (only 1/3 of
patients starting dialysis are receiving an ESA). Economic considerations
will inevitably apply.

Preparation for ESA therapy
• 2 Have other causes of anaemia been considered (b p. 217),
especially iron deﬁciency?
• Is the patient likely to respond? Cytokine release associated with
infection (or chronic inﬂammation) impairs ESA response. Identify and
treat these ﬁrst. i CRP usually predicts poor response.
• Is BP controlled? ESAs tend to i BP. Severe i BP was not uncommon
in the early days of ESA use (mechanism: vasoconstriction and
enhanced adrenergic responsiveness) but has d in incidence with the
reﬁnement of treatment algorithms (which generally aim for a slower
rise in Hb).
Investigations
• FBC with red cell indices.
• Determine iron status:
• Serum ferritin; recommended range 200–500 micrograms/L.
• Serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC).
• Transferrin saturation (TSAT); recommended range 20–40%.
• % hypochromic RBCs (% HRBC); recommended target <6%.
• CRP.
• Serum B12 and folate.
• Consider faecal occult blood testing.
• 2 Measurement of EPO levels is expensive, misleading, and
unnecessary.
Choice of ESA
There is no evidence to distinguish between ESAs on the basis of clinical
efﬁcacy. Choice will depend on local protocols, availability, and patient/
physician preference.
Route of administration
• Either SC or IV (IV often used in haemodialysis patients—given at the
end of a dialysis treatment to reduce dialyser absorption). This can
also assist compliance.

PRESCRIBING ESAs

• Pre-dialysis CKD and peritoneal dialysis patients can be taught to
self-administer an ESA at home, using a range of user-friendly devices.
• There is a dose adjustment between SC and IV administration for
some ESAs (b p. 220), but there is much interpatient variability.
• Rare reports of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in patients treated with
SC epoetin A have been resolved.

Starting ESAs
• 2 Ensure iron-replete; iron stores may rapidly deplete once an ESA is
commenced so will require monitoring.
• See Table 3.7 (b p. 220) for typical starting doses.
• The initial dose can be i if there is clinical urgency and/or ESA
resistance is likely.
• Measure Hb and BP 2–4-weekly at ﬁrst (and after a dose change).
• If deterioration in BP, intensify antihypertensive medications (it is
rarely necessary to withhold ESA).
• Aim for i Hb of 1–2g/dL/month until target achieved.
• i dose monthly (725% increments) if slow Hb rise.
• d dose by 25–50% if Hb rises >2g/dL in a month.
• Changing dose intervals can be a convenient way of dose increases/
reductions—avoiding the need to dispense a substitute dose and
waste existing supplies.
• Once in ‘steady state’, monitor Hb 1–2-monthly in pre-dialysis
patients and monthly in dialysis patients.
• An intercurrent illness may reduce Hb. There is no consensus on
the best approach, but consider temporary i dose.

ESA resistance or hyporesponsiveness
• True ESA resistance is variously deﬁned as:
• Failure to reach target Hb, or
• The need to administer above a threshold ESA dose (e.g.
≥300IU/kg/wk of epoetin A or B) or 1.5 micrograms/kg/wk of
darbepoetin A to maintain target Hb.
• Relative resistance is common.
• Run through, and proactively exclude, the alternative causes of
CKD-associated anaemia (see b p. 217).
• 2 Always exclude iron deﬁciency.
• If iron stores prove refractory to iron administration, check for faecal
occult blood, and consider further GI investigation.
• Assess compliance.
• Check reticulocyte count in non-responders.
• High: suggests an appropriate marrow response (i.e. there is
probably bleeding or compromised RBC survival).
• Low: RBC production problem (e.g. inﬂammation) or poor
compliance.
• If haemolysis suspected, check LDH, haptoglobins, direct
Coombs’ test.

• X Cytoprotection (b p. 219).
X Adjuncts to ESA therapy
In addition to iron, there has been interest in several other agents as
possible adjuncts to ESA therapy.
• Ascorbic acid:
• Increases iron release from ferritin and the reticuloendothelial
system.
• Enhances iron utilization during Hb synthesis.
• Needs to be given IV as orally ineffective.
• s oxalosis is a safety concern.
• Insufﬁcient evidence for routine use.
• L-carnitine:
• Required for long chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria.
• Membrane-stabilizing effect li RBC survival (+ i formation of
bone marrow erythroid colonies).
• IV administration may i Hb and d ESA requirement.
• Inadequate and unconvincing body of evidence.
• Androgens:
• Patchy evidence to support nandrolone (given IM).
• Side effects, including acne, virilization, and abnormal LFTs, make
it an unattractive option.

ESAs: ADDITIONAL BENEFITS

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA): a detective story
• Presents as an abrupt decline in Hb, with normal platelets, normal
WCC, and reticulocyte count <1%.
• Bone marrow examination reveals absent erythroid precursors.
• Anti-EPO antibodies can be measured.
• There has always been a low background incidence of PRCA due to
viral infections (parvovirus), lymphoma, and certain drugs.
• Acquired PRCA was ﬁrst reported in the late 1990s, with 7250
patients worldwide developing anti-EPO antibodies.
• These antibodies cross-react with endogenous EPO, rendering
patients profoundly anaemic and transfusion-dependent.
• Almost all these cases occurred in dialysis patients on SC (but
not IV) epoetin A (a handful of cases have been described with
other ESAs).
• Extensive (and expensive) investigation suggested that polysorbate
(in the drug vehicle) was able to react with compounds leaching
from uncoated rubber stoppers in preﬁlled syringes. This had an
adjuvant effect, promoting the molecules’ immunogenicity (which is
already higher by the SC route).
• Switching to a different ESA proved unhelpful because the antibody
cross-reacted.
• Immunosuppression was tried, with variable success.
• Peginesatide (formerly hematide) (b p. 221) differs in structure and
does not cross-react with the antibody. It has been successfully used
as treatment.
• PRCA led many countries to abandon epoetin A by the SC route.
However, following a change to the manufacturing process, its use
remains widespread.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

ESAs: target haemoglobin
X Although ESAs can be beneﬁcial for patients with CKD-related anaemia, they are not without intrinsic risks. Despite observational data suggesting an association between lower Hb and poorer outcomes, recent
randomized trials have demonstrated overall worse outcomes and higher
risk of death with ESA treatment, particularly with higher Hb targets.

Inﬂuential clinical trials
CHOIR
• Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufﬁciency study.
• USA; published 2007.
• Hypothesis: using epoetin A to achieve an Hb of 13.5g/dL, compared
to Hb 11.3g/dL, would d CV complications and death.
• Randomized, open label design; 1,432 patients, CKD 3–4 (non-dialysis);
initial Hb targets 10.5–11.0g/dL and 13.0–13.5g/dL, but a protocol
amendment changed the targets to absolute values (Hb 11.3g/dL vs
13.5g/dL).
• p outcome: time to all-cause mortality or MI, CVA, heart failure (HF).
• Stopped early; mean 16 months’ follow-up.
• Finding: 34% increase in the risk of primary composite outcome in
higher target group (mainly HF). Little difference in quality of life.
• Problems: high dropout rate, differences in two groups at baseline,
higher target not actually achieved—despite huge ESA doses.
CREATE
• Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early Anaemia Treatment with
Epoetin study.
• European; published 2007.
• Hypothesis: early vs late anaemia correction with epoetin A will d
mortality and CV morbidity in CKD 3–4.
• Randomized, open label design; 603 patients, CKD 3–4 (non-dialysis);
Hb targets 10.5–11.5g/dL and 13.0–15.0g/dL.
• p outcome: time to CV event.
• 24 months’ follow-up.
• Finding: trend to higher event rate in higher target group (not
statistically signiﬁcant). Quality of life better in higher target group.
• Problems: low CV event rate (6%).
Although both studies had faults, the trends toward poorer outcomes led
the US Food and Drug Administration to signiﬁcantly escalate the label
warnings for ESA drugs, strongly cautioning against higher targets.
TREAT
• Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy study.
• Worldwide (24 countries); published 2009.
• Hypothesis: treatment with darbepoietin A would d risk of death,
major CV events, and renal events in patients with T2DM and CKD.
• Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind; 4,038 patients, CKD
3–4 (non-dialysis) with T2DM.

ESAs: TARGET HAEMOGLOBIN

• 2,012 patients assigned to ESA, with Hb target 713g/dL (median
achieved 12.5g/dL), and 2,026 patients to placebo, with rescue ESA if
Hb <9g/dL (median Hb 10.6g/dL).
• p outcome: composite of death or a CV event and of death or
end-stage renal disease (2 the death and CV event rate in the trial
overall was an incredible 31%—reﬂecting the huge CV disease burden
in this population).
• 29 months’ follow-up.
• Finding: no d in the risk of either death or CV event with ESA,
but this group did have an i risk of stroke. Modest beneﬁts
(d fatigue, d transfusion). Authors suggested ESA might be best
avoided in T2DM.
• Problems: differences in baseline group characteristics; may not be
applicable to non-diabetic population.
Adverse outcomes: putative mechanisms
The mechanism for the apparent outcomes associated with higher Hb
targets is unclear, but it is likely that a number of interdependent factors
are operative.
• Effect of i Hb (i blood volume, i blood viscosity, endothelial damage).
• i BP.
• i platelet aggregation.
• Direct ESA toxicity (particularly with large and rapidly escalating doses).
• Interaction with patient’s comorbidity (particularly if poor ESA
response and higher doses, e.g. inﬂammation, CV disease).
The future
Further large, well-designed clinical studies are needed to clarify the safety
and efﬁcacy of ESAs. Ideally, target Hb would be individualized, with a
risk-beneﬁt assessment based on a patient’s speciﬁc level of function, lifestyle, and comorbidity.
Current targets (see Table 3.8)
 For now, ESA treatment to Hb targets above 11–12g/dL, particularly
in those with signiﬁcant CV morbidity, should be avoided. Some would go
further and suggest that, given current evidence, the use of ESAs should
no longer be habitual in pre-dialysis patients, especially in relatively asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate anaemia (Hb 79–11g/dL), and that
large ESA doses should certainly be avoided in this situation.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Iron: metabolism and markers
Key facts
• Iron is an essential component of haem, so adequate amounts are
obligatory for RBC synthesis.
• Iron deﬁciency is found in 740% of patients with advanced CKD and
virtually all dialysis patients.
• For optimal RBC production, CKD patients require different targets
for iron markers than non-CKD individuals (b p. 230).
• ESA treatment leads to almost universal iron deﬁciency.
• Iron absorption from the gut is lower in CKD patients. Consequently,
oral iron is usually ineffective (b p. 229).
• Many CKD patients and virtually all dialysis patients require parenteral
iron therapy.
• Iron therapy alone may treat anaemia in pre-dialysis CKD patients.

Causes of iron deﬁciency in CKD
Absolute iron deﬁciency
• Occurs when body iron stores are genuinely low.
• Characterized by a low serum ferritin.
• Reduced intake:
• Poor appetite.
• Dietary restrictions.
• Increased iron loss:
• GI bleeding (often subclinical).
• Multiple blood tests.
• Haemodialysis (may lose up to 2g of iron per year through blood
left in the dialyser circuit; 10–20x losses in general population).
Functional iron deﬁciency
• Despite adequate storage iron, it is not made available at a rate that
satisﬁes demand.
• This is common when the ESA-driven ‘supraphysiological’ rate of
erythropoiesis has outpaced the delivery of iron by transferrin.
• Characterized by a normal or raised ferritin and low TSAT (<20%).
Reticuloendothelial (‘inﬂammatory’) block
• Occurs with infection or inﬂammation (the ‘anaemia of chronic disease’).
• Iron is trapped in the reticuloendothelial system and is not released to
transferrin for Hb synthesis.
• Characterized by i CRP, i ferritin, d TSAT (but current markers are
unable to distinguish from functional iron deﬁciency).

Markers of iron status
Several markers of iron status are available. Unfortunately, they lack sensitivity and speciﬁcity to predict the response to iron therapy in the context
of CKD. It is generally recommended that ferritin and at least one additional test are used.
• Ferritin:
• Cellular storage protein and marker of storage iron.
• An acute phase protein, raised in inﬂammation and liver disease.

IRON: METABOLISM AND MARKERS

• TSAT:
• Transferrin is a serum protein involved in iron delivery.
• TSAT = (serum iron / TIBC) x 100.
• A measure of available iron.
• Percentage hypochromic red blood cells (% HRBC):
• Measure of the iron incorporated into RBCs.
• Reticulocyte Hb count (CHr):
• Measure of the iron incorporated into immature RBCs.
• Others: serum transferrin receptor and erythrocyte zinc
protoporphyrin levels are mainly research tools at present.

Hepcidin
This recently described, hepatically synthesized peptide has emerged as
a key regulator of iron homeostasis.
• Inhibits both GI iron absorption and iron release from the liver and
reticuloendothelial system.
• Hepcidin exerts its actions through binding to ferroportin, a cellular
iron efﬂux channel. Binding l internalization and degradation.
• Animal models:
• Hepcidin knockout l severe iron overload.
• Hepcidin overexpression l severe iron deﬁciency anaemia.
• Human haemochromatosis results from either deﬁciency or failed
regulation of hepcidin.
• Plays a key role in the anaemia of CKD, ESA resistance, and the
anaemia of chronic disease.
• Synthesis is induced by iron loading and inﬂammation, and
suppressed by erythropoiesis, iron deﬁciency, and hypoxia.
• Iron loading/inﬂammation li hepcidin ld GI iron absorption
+ d hepatic and reticuloendothelial iron release ld plasma iron
levels.
• Erythropoiesis/iron deﬁciency/hypoxia ld hepcidin li GI iron
absorption + i hepatic and reticuloendothelial iron release li
plasma iron levels.
• Hepcidin is eliminated by the kidney, so CKD indirectly causes
reduced GI iron absorption and iron store availability.
• Hepcidin levels rise as CKD progresses (highest in dialysis patients).
Levels also increase in infection and inﬂammation.
• Hepcidin could prove to be a useful marker of iron status:
• Functional iron deﬁciency l low hepcidin.
• Reticuloendothelial blockade l high hepcidin.
• Levels i with iron loading so may help avoid iron overload.
• Low hepcidin levels may identify those patients likely to respond
to oral iron.
• The future: hepcidin antagonists could stimulate iron absorption and
mobilization, blocking the inhibitory effect of CKD or inﬂammation
on red cell production (ld parenteral iron administration and d ESA
requirement).

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Iron: therapy and targets
2 Prescribing an ESA to an iron-deﬁcient patient is a waste of time
and money.

Targets
• Ferritin:
• >200 micrograms/L (haemodialysis).
• >100 micrograms/L (non-haemodialysis).
• Generally, aim 200–500 micrograms/L.  Avoid >800 micrograms/L,
i.e. targets well above the normal physiological range.
• TSAT:
• >20% (unless ferritin >800 micrograms/L).
• Generally, aim 20–40%.
• % HRBC: <6% (unless ferritin >800 micrograms/L).
• Reticulocyte Hb content (CHr): >29pg/cell.
Monitoring
Measure iron stores 1–3-monthly, depending on the clinical situation and
response to treatment (and no earlier than 1 week after IV iron administration).

Oral iron therapy
• Generally little beneﬁt, particularly in higher CKD stages.
• Ferrous sulfate 200mg tablets contain just 65mg of elemental iron.
• GI side effects, including nausea, dyspepsia, and constipation, are
considerable.
• Has to be taken as part from mealtimes and phosphate binders—so
challenging for patients already on complex tablet regimens.
• Compliance is often poor.
• Some guidelines (e.g. UK Renal Association) suggest ﬁrst-line in
CKD, but this is rarely the case in practice.
• Consider a trial in pre-dialysis patients, with iron stores checked
after 4–6 weeks of treatment.

Intramuscular iron
 Avoid: very painful; causes skin discoloration; CKD bleeding tendency
l haematomas.
Intravenous iron
• Safe and effective.
• Increases ferritin and TSAT. Decreases ESA requirement.
• Concerns about iron overload (l oxidative stress, infection risk,
and CV damage) not as strong as previously (provided appropriate
monitoring in place).
• Defer administration if active infection, as potential risk of
compromised neutrophil function.
• Current preparations contain elemental iron enclosed in a
carbohydrate shell.

IRON: THERAPY AND TARGETS

• The elemental iron is released to transferrin and then to the
reticuloendothelial system for storage.
• The more stable the preparation, the larger the permissible dose.
• In haemodialysis patients, it is practical to give regular low doses of
iron, e.g. 100mg weekly. This is obviously less convenient in pre-dialysis
or peritoneal dialysis patients.
2 Adverse reactions
• Free iron reaction: d BP, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sweating, myalgia,
back pain, arthralgia, pruritus. Often less problematic with slower
administration. Usually self-limiting, but consider treatment with
hydrocortisone and/or antihistamines.
• 3 Anaphylaxis: risk low, but staff should be appropriately trained
and adequate resuscitation facilities immediately available.

Preparations of intravenous iron
Iron III hydroxide sucrose complex (iron sucrose/saccharate)
• Venofer®.
• Low incidence of adverse reactions. Anaphylaxis very rare (0.05%).
• Test dose unnecessary.
• Widely used, particularly in Europe.
• IV infusion or slow IV injection (20mg/min), often diluted in 100mL
saline.
• Typical dosing pre-dialysis or peritoneal dialysis: 200mg every
1–3 months (200mg weekly for three doses, if clinical urgency).
• Haemodialysis: initially 100mg for ten dialysis sessions. Continue
weekly if ferritin <500 micrograms/L.
Sodium ferric gluconate
• Ferrlecit®.
• Anaphylaxis rare. Test dose unnecessary.
• Widely used.
• More iron may be released directly to storage and not to transferrin.
• Usually administered as 62.5–125mg IV over 10min on haemodialysis.
• Diluted for slower administration in pre-dialysis and peritoneal
dialysis patients.
Iron dextran
• Higher risk of reactions and anaphylaxis (0.6%), the latter due to the
formation of anti-dextran antibodies.
• Popularity declining in view of this.
•  A test dose is mandatory.
• Total dose of iron infusions of low MW iron (III) hydroxide dextran
complex (Cosmofer®) (e.g. 20mg/kg over 4–6h) have been used for
more rapid iron repletion and to avoid multiple infusions.
Newer preparations
• Include ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject®) and ferumoxytol
(Feraheme®). Both facilitate the delivery of higher doses of iron in a
single administration.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD mineral and bone disorder
(CKD-MBD)
Deﬁnitions (see Table 3.9)
• CKD mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a relatively new term
that describes the mineral, skeletal, and related CV consequences of
CKD (particularly CV calciﬁcation).
• This expanded focus has been driven by observational studies
suggesting that CKD-MBD (and its treatment) may impact on CV
morbidity and mortality.
• Vascular disease is common and progresses rapidly in CKD,
particularly at stage 5—usually occlusive lesions due to atheromatous
plaques. The full spectrum of arterial disease in CKD is broader,
however, including vessel wall calciﬁcation with resulting impaired
vascular function.
• Renal bone disease (osteodystrophy) is reserved to describe the bone
pathologies associated with CKD. Osteodystrophy is a heterogeneous
disorder that ultimately leads to diminished bone strength.
• CKD-MBD is invariably present beyond CKD 3, and its management
represents a signiﬁcant clinical challenge.
• There is no single therapeutic intervention that ﬁts all—instead, a package
of management, customized to the individual patient, is necessary.
• Several important international practice guidelines have been formulated
to help inform the optimal treatment of CKD-MBD (b p. 244).
Table 3.9 KDIGOa classiﬁcation of CKD-MBD and renal osteodystrophy
Deﬁnition of CKD-MBD
A systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism due to CKD, manifested by
either one or a combination of the following:

• Abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, or vitamin D metabolism.
• Abnormalities of bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or
strength.

• Vascular or other soft tissue calciﬁcation.
Deﬁnition of renal osteodystrophy

• Renal osteodystrophy is an alteration of bone morphology in patients with CKD.
• It is one measure of the skeletal component of the systemic disorder that is
quantiﬁable by histomorphometry of bone biopsy material.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD-MBD: bone disease
Osteodystrophy is a function of bone turnover, mineralization, and volume. Strictly speaking, bone biopsy (usually from the iliac bone) with histological and histomorphometric assessment is required for diagnosis and
classiﬁcation. In practice, biopsies are very rarely performed (invasive, with
considerable expertise needed to interpret), and surrogate markers of
bone turnover are 6 (over) relied on (see Table 3.10).
See Fig. 3.5 for the spectrum of renal bone disease.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) i PTH causes i bone
resorption and formation (‘high turnover’ disease). Haphazardly organized, weakened bone results (classically, osteitis ﬁbrosa cystica).
Adynamic bone disease Paucity of cells with d bone resorption
and formation (‘low turnover’ disease). Pathophysiology remains poorly
understood, but incidence has i rapidly over the last two decades.
Mixed uraemic osteodystrophy
This is also relatively common, as is evolution from one form to another.

Osteomalacia
This refers to a defect in mineralization. Uncommon as an isolated ﬁnding
and not helpful as a clinical description in this situation. Generally related
to a deﬁciency of 1,25(OH)2D, but aluminium intoxication and uraemic
acidosis are also important risk factors.

Osteoporosis
Usually deﬁned in terms of bone mineral density (BMD) so has little diagnostic meaning in the context of osteodystrophy where low BMD can coexist
with low or high turnover disease. DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scanning does not predict fracture risk in advanced CKD so is of limited clinical utility in this setting (stages 4–5D). Stage 3 CKD encompasses
large numbers of patients, many with age-related declines in GFR, who will
exhibit a mixed bag of skeletal pathologies (including mild SHPT, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deﬁciency). Extrapolating general management from the
non-CKD population is 6 difﬁcult (and not evidence-based), and the role of
anti-resorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates, is uncertain. One approach
is to gather a dataset of Ca2+, PO4, PTH, serum 25(OH)2D, and BMD. Any
abnormalities of mineral metabolism can be addressed as described over the
next few pages. If none exists, then low BMD can be treated as for non-CKD
patients. Stages 1–2 CKD should be treated as per the non-CKD population.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD-MBD: physiology
If renal function is intact, concentrations of PO4 and Ca2+ are maintained
through interaction between PTH, 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol), ﬁbroblast
growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and their principal targets: bone, kidney, the
GI tract, and parathyroid glands.

Parathyroid hormone
PTH secretion (and parathyroid gland proliferation) are stimulated by
d Ca2+, d 1,25(OH)2D, and i PO4. PTH acts on three fronts: (i) mobilizing skeletal calcium; (ii) d urinary Ca2+ + i urinary PO4 excretion; (iii)
i renal production of 1,25(OH)2D (in turn li intestinal Ca2+ and PO4
absorption).

Vitamin D
Inactive vitamin D sterols, e.g. colecalciferol (from dietary sources and UV
conversion in the skin), are metabolized in the liver to 25(OH)D (calcidiol)
and converted to 1,25(OH)2D (principally) by the renal 1A-hydroxylase
enzyme. 1,25(OH)2D exerts many important biological effects via its intracellular receptor (VDR) (see Fig. 3.6).

FGF-23
Produced in bone by osteocytes and osteoblasts. FGF-23 levels i as
GFR d, potently suppressing 1A-hydroxylase and 6 1,25(OH)2D production. It also i urinary PO4 excretion. FGF-23 excess underlies autosomal dominant hypophosphataemic rickets, X-linked hypophosphataemia,
and tumour-induced osteomalacia (all characterized by PO4 wasting, d
1,25(OH)2D, and skeletal abnormalities). 2 Emerging as a very powerful
biomarker for mortality.

Klotho
A putative ageing suppressor gene, encoding a transmembrane protein that forms a complex with the FGF receptor to i FGF-23 afﬁnity.
Expressed principally in the kidney, brain, and parathyroid gland, it is a
mandatory cofactor for the actions of FGF-23 within mineral homeostasis.
d Klotho expression is one of the earliest biomarkers for CKD (preceding
i PO4 and i FGF-23) and continues to decline as GFR falls.

Bone biology
Bone is not static; it continuously adapts to mechanical and metabolic
requirements by a remodelling process centred around the coupling of
osteoblastic formation and osteoclastic resorption. Multiple systemic hormones (including PTH and 1,25(OH)2D) and local growth factors (e.g. the
RANK/OPG system) inﬂuence this process. Bone is the most important
body reservoir of Ca2+ and PO4. See Fig. 3.7 for the pathogenesis of SHPT.

CKD-MBD: PHYSIOLOGY

The effect of CKD
• Loss of functioning renal mass l:
• Phosphate accumulation.
• d 1,25(OH)2D (ld serum Ca2+).
• d Klotho expression li FGF-23 (ld 1,25(OH)2D).
• ‘Nutritional’ vitamin D insufﬁciency is also common in CKD
(b p. 250).
• Secondary hyperparathyroidism:
• d Ca2+ + d 1,25(OH)2D + i PO4li PTH synthesis and release.
• Prolonged stimulation of parathyroid tissue l clonal proliferation
of parathyroid cells (with areas of nodular hyperplasia).
• These clones express less Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) and VDR.
• Refractoriness to treatment is inevitable (termed tertiary or
autonomous hyperparathyroidism).
• In addition, there is relative ‘skeletal resistance’ to the effects of
PTH (mechanisms unclear).
• Abnormal bone turnover results.
• i PTH also has non-skeletal effects, including LVH, cardiac
ﬁbrosis, extraskeletal calciﬁcation, peripheral neuropathy,
impotence.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD-MBD: clinical features
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT)
• Usually asymptomatic. Clinical sequelae occur late (with signiﬁcant
biochemical and histological disease), including:
• Bone pain, arthralgia, and muscle weakness (esp. proximal).
• Pruritus (cutaneous calcium phosphate deposition).
• Bony deformity (e.g. resorption of terminal phalanges).
• i fracture risk (hip fracture risk 75x in dialysis patients). Fracture risk
is equivalent to a non-dialysis patient 10–20 years older. 2 Mortality
following a fracture rises by 72.5x.
• Marrow ﬁbrosis contributes to anaemia and poor ESA response.

Adynamic bone disorder
• Usually asymptomatic and probably no i fracture risk X.
• Adynamic bone buffers calcium poorly; i Ca2+ is common, particularly
if oral calcium intake is signiﬁcant.
• i risk of soft tissue and vascular calciﬁcation.
• i risk of osteopenia post-transplantation ( steroids).
• Aluminium-related low turnover bone disease is often painful, with an
i risk of spontaneous fracture.

Cardiovascular risk
• 2 Poor control of serum PO4, serum Ca2+, calcium phosphate
product (CaxP), and PTH are all associated with i CV morbidity and
mortality.
• i CaxP is associated with soft tissue and cardiac calciﬁcation.

Diagnosis
No one marker is perfect, so a clinical dataset is used (see Table 3.11).
Biochemical
• Check Ca2+, PO4, and PTH, as in Table 3.11. More often if treatment
changes made.
• PTH: the ability of serum PTH to predict high and low turnover
disease is actually quite poor though improves at extremes of PTH
(<2x upper limit of normal for PTH: low turnover; >9x upper limit of
normal: high turnover).
• Calcium: d in untreated SHPT (though rises with vitamin D analogue
and calcium-based phosphate binder treatment); often i in ABD.
• Phosphate: raised (early).
• Alkaline phosphatase: i in SHPT and a useful, if underutilized,
component of the clinical dataset. It is a marker of bone formation
(others, e.g. osteocalcin, are also elevated though not routinely
measured).
Radiology
The availability of PTH measurements means X-rays are rarely necessary.

CKD-MBD: CLINICAL FEATURES

• SHPT: subperiosteal bone resorption (distal and middle phalanges of
hands and feet), osteosclerosis (l ‘rugger jersey spine’ on lateral ﬁlms),
solitary cysts (’brown tumours’), particularly in jaw, pelvis, or ribs.
• ABD: often normal (osteopenia difﬁcult to detect on standard X-rays).
• DEXA does not predict fracture risk in advanced CKD although may
in stages 1–3 (b p. 234). Quantitative CT of the spine may prove to
have a role in predicting high and low turnover disease.

XOther guidelines, including those produced by NICE in the UK, do not advocate routine
testing of serum PTH in CKD stage 3.
a
Calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D) is not routinely measured, as it is present in only tiny amounts in
serum, and the assay is technically difﬁcult and expensive.

PTH assays
• PTH (1-84) is the active hormone synthesized by the parathyroid
glands and released into the circulation.
• PTH (1-84) exerts its biological effects via the type 1 PTH receptor
(PTHR1).
• PTH fragments are also present in the circulation. These include a
large C-terminal fragment called PTH (7-84).
• Routinely used ‘ﬁrst-generation’ immunometric assays or ‘intact’ PTH
assays detect both PTH (1-84) and PTH (7-84).
• PTH (1-84) has a circulatory half-life of <5min. PTH (7-84)
undergoes renal clearance, and its half-life is appreciably longer.
• PTH (7-84) appears to exert an inhibitory inﬂuence on osteoclastic
bone resorption (probably via a distinct C-PTH receptor). This
opposes the action of PTH (1-84) and may be a contributory factor
to the apparent skeletal resistance to PTH seen in CKD.
• ‘Second-generation’ immunometric assays, more speciﬁc for PTH
(1-84), are available and are likely to attract increasing attention as
their clinicopathological validation progresses. At present, however,
international CKD-MBD guidelines have not supported their
routine use.
• There may prove to be a role for combining the different assays,
e.g. a PTH (1-84)/PTH (7-84) ratio <1 has been correlated with
adynamic bone.

• Vascular calciﬁcation may predict, or even contribute to, the i CV
morbidity and mortality associated with CKD.
• Prevalence in CKD far exceeds the general population (>80% of
dialysis patients). Progression is also much more rapid.
• Appears intimately linked to the aberrant mineral and bone
metabolism of CKD (as well as to its treatment X). May explain the
association between i PO4, i CaxP and i PTH, and adverse CV
outcomes in observational studies. The ﬁnding of vascular calciﬁcation
is, in itself, associated with signiﬁcant i CV risk.

Types
Two types of arterial calciﬁcation (often co-localized):
• Intimal—within atherosclerotic plaques. Associated with stenotic
lesions and CV events, such as MI and stroke. The calcium content of
plaques from CKD patients is greater than age-matched controls.
• Medial—within the intima media; classically, Mönckeberg’s calcinosis.
This causes vascular stiffness (l elevated pulse pressure l LVH l LV
dysfunction).
• In addition, cardiac valvular, and other soft tissue, calciﬁcation is a
frequent ﬁnding in advanced CKD. Calciﬁcation also makes vascular
interventions, such as CABG or angioplasty, more challenging.

Should we screen?
The role of screening is unclear at present, as screening criteria are not
fulﬁlled: (i) best therapy is uncertain and (ii) unknown if CV outcomes can
be modiﬁed. Possible methods, however:
• Electron beam (EBCT) or multislice (MSCT) CT scanning (esp.
coronary arteries and aorta) most sensitive and speciﬁc. Generate a
calciﬁcation score for prospective monitoring. Problems: expensive,
cannot distinguish intimal and medial calciﬁcation.
• Plain X-ray (usually lateral AXR) can document ‘pipe stem’
calciﬁcation, with reasonable sensitivity; quantiﬁcation more difﬁcult
(recommended by KDIGO).
• Vascular ultrasound, e.g. carotid intimal medial thickness.
• Pulse wave velocity yields functional information.
• Echocardiography identiﬁes valvular calciﬁcation.

Relationship with osteodystrophy
• Most commonly associated with ABD where the skeleton fails to
buffer Ca2+ and PO4, leaving them ‘available for use’ in calciﬁcation. In
SHPT, the release of Ca2+ and PO4 during bone resorption may also
favour calciﬁcation.
• X Both calcium-containing phosphate binders and active vitamin D
can create a +ve calcium balance, with a risk of ABD and i CaxP.
There is evidence linking calcium intake to arterial calciﬁcation.
This has provoked an extremely robust, ongoing debate within

CKD-MBD: VASCULAR CALCIFICATION

nephrology about the future role of these treatments (both previously
cornerstones of therapy) (see b pp. 246–251).

Prevention and treatment
• Follow best practice guidelines for CKD-MBD, as outlined on b p. 244.
• Some evidence that sevelamer HCl, a non-calcium-containing binder,
may slow progression of coronary and aortic calciﬁcation.
• Calcimimetics may help control PTH without i CaxP or large doses of
vitamin D. A potential future role is currently under study (b p. 252).
• Daily or long-hours dialysis with superior PO4 control (negating the
need for binders) may help, as might transplantation.

Biology of vascular calciﬁcation in CKD
A new paradigm that departs from the traditional view of i CaxP passively
promoting calciﬁcation has recently emerged, revealing an extremely complex—and closely regulated—process. The evidence trail is as follows:
• Although calciﬁcation appears to correlate, in part, with calcium
intake, it was frequently encountered prior to the widespread use of
calcium-based phosphate binders.
• A poorly understood association between arterial calciﬁcation
and bone disease has long been recognized in the context of
osteoporosis where mineral metabolism is less overtly disturbed.
• The calcium deposited in vessels is in the form of hydroxyapatite
crystals—the same as in the skeleton.
• Spontaneous vascular calciﬁcation occurs in rodents carrying speciﬁc
gene deletions (e.g. apolipoprotein-E, fetuin-A, and OPG).
• Certain hitherto ‘bone-speciﬁc’ regulatory transcription factors
(particularly Cbfa1) and proteins (e.g. osteocalcin, osteonectin, and
alkaline phosphatase) have been demonstrated in calciﬁed vessels.
• Several stimuli (including i PO4 and uraemic serum) are able to
promote the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells to an
osteoblastic phenotype (via the upregulation of the Na-dependent
cotransporter Pit-1). Such cells then form matrix vesicles and initiate
the process of matrix deposition and mineralization.
• Regulation of calciﬁcation is achieved through a balance of promoters
(e.g. BMP-2, RANKL) and inhibitors (e.g. matrix GIa protein, itself
inhibited by warfarin, osteopontin, fetuin-A, PTHrP, OPG).
• In addition, i PTH, i BP, abnormal glucose metabolism,
dyslipidaemia (particularly d HDL), inﬂammation (i CRP, i IL-6,
i TNF-A, d fetuin-A), oxidative stress, and natural inhibitor
deﬁciencies are all likely to play a role.
• Further complexity is suggested by the discovery of cross-talk
between osteoblasts and adipocytes (via leptin and other hormones)
and 6 bone remodelling and energy metabolism. This may have
particular relevance in diabetes where low bone turnover is common.
• This integration of bone and vascular biology may yield novel
treatments; for example, BMP-7 has been shown to be efﬁcacious in
animal models of vascular calciﬁcation and bone disease. OPG and
fetuin-A are also potential future therapies.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD-MBD: treatment
Goals
Keep serum Ca2+ and PO4 within the normal range.
Keep bone turnover and strength as near normal as possible.
Keep serum PTH appropriate to these objectives.
Prevent the development of parathyroid hyperplasia.
The standard treatment package comprises:
• Measures to d serum PO4:
• Dietary PO4 restriction.
• Oral phosphate binders (prevent absorption).
• Removal through adequate dialysis.
• Measures to suppress PTH synthesis and secretion:
• Calcitriol or vitamin D analogues (e.g. alfacalcidol, paricalcitol).
• Calcimimetic agents.
• Measures to normalize serum Ca2+:
• Appropriate calcium intake ± supplementation (including
calcium-containing binders).
• Appropriate vitamin D treatment.
• Appropriate dialysate concentration.

•
•
•
•

Therapeutic targets
An area of healthy debate within nephrology.
NKF KDOQI (2003) (see Table 3.12)
• Guidelines developed by NKF KDOQI reﬂected the growing
concern that CKD-MBD and its treatment might be associated with a
potentially modiﬁable increase in CV risk.
• Principally opinion-based, they advocated much more rigorous targets
for Ca2+, PO4, and PTH than previously suggested (see Table 3.12).
• These targets:
• Proved extremely challenging from the clinician’s perspective.
Multiple studies, as well as national registry data, showed that
current practice fell well short of achieving them.

CKD-MBD: TREATMENT

• Outcome data showing a signiﬁcant impact on mortality through
attaining them have, thus far, not been forthcoming.
• Provided a framework for the pharmaceutical industry to introduce
novel and (sometimes) expensive treatments as well as for
healthcare purchasers to set reimbursement targets.
KDIGO (2009) (see Table 3.13)
• The more recent KDIGO clinical practice guidelines present a
comprehensive and systematic review of available evidence in this area
and hope to harmonize international guidelines.
• While not universally accepted, they have generally superseded the
NKF KDOQI guidelines.
• The principal differences are:
• Much less prescriptive.
• Less emphasis on attaining narrow Ca2+, PO4, and PTH targets,
e.g. the target for PTH in pre-dialysis CKD is effectively removed
beyond treatment of a progressively rising value.
• The guidelines generally recommend decision-making based on
trends, rather than single values.
• The guidelines suggest there is no evidence to underpin a more
stringent PTH target, so focus on avoidance of risk at extremes of
PTH, i.e. at <2 x or >9 x normal in dialysis patients.
• A ‘multiplication’ range of 2–9 x normal is given, as opposed to an
absolute range in pg/mL or pmol/L, because absolute PTH levels
can vary signiﬁcantly between assays.
• The guidelines read more as a summary of evidence, punctuated by
pointers and advice, rather than dogmatic targets.
• Criticisms: the new broader PTH targets risk ‘letting the genie
out of the bottle’, with progressive hyperparathyroidism that
could subsequently prove unstoppable. Additionally, some were
expecting (and prefer) more prescriptive guidance.

It is suggested that if the PTH is progressively rising and remains persistently above the
upper limit of normal, it warrants treatment but not to a speciﬁc numerical target because the
optimal PTH level in this situation is unknown. From Kidney Int, 2009, 76, Suppl. 113, 1–132.

 Very few statements in either guideline are based on high-quality
evidence—in fact, the only two recommendations graded 1A within the
KDIGO report are in areas within paediatric practice. This serves to highlight the pressing need for RCTs to inform future guidelines in this area.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD-MBD: hyperphosphataemia
Control of phosphate
PO4 control is the weak link in the therapeutic approach to CKD-MBD.
Dietary restriction
• Phosphate is contained in almost all foods (esp. meat, milk, eggs,
cheese, yogurt, bran cereals, cola, chocolate drinks, beer, baked beans,
dried peas (e.g. chick peas), nuts, and many convenience foods).
• It is difﬁcult to balance dietary phosphate restriction against adequate
protein intake (recommended levels of daily dietary protein provide
30–40mmol of phosphate). Patients are advised to reduce unnecessary
PO4 intake (e.g. cola), so they can maintain an adequate protein intake
(e.g. meat, eggs).
Phosphate binders
See Table 3.14.
• Taken with meals to bind phosphate in the gut. The amount taken is
proportional to size of meal (and, ideally, to its PO4 content) as well as
to serum PO4 (usually 1–3 tablets/meal).
• Potency is modest, and some patients require large doses. GI side
effects are frequent. 2The most effective binder is one that the
patient will take: demanding regimens + unpalatable tablets = poor
compliance (>50% dialysis patients do not take their binders regularly).
• Should not be taken at the same time as iron supplements.
• Aluminium hydroxide is the most effective binder, but potential
aluminium toxicity (skeletal and neurological) restricts its use (<4 weeks).
• Calcium-containing phosphate binders (CCPBs) have been the
mainstay:
• Not only bind PO4, but help correct d Ca2+ (and 6 suppress PTH).
• Patients receiving CCPBs are often in +ve calcium balance, so they
have been implicated as contributors to vascular calciﬁcation (and
adverse CV outcome). This can probably be avoided by limiting
CCPB dose (and lowering dialysate calcium, e.g. to 1.25mmol/L).
• CCPBs should be restricted to 1,500mg elemental calcium/day,
particularly if low turnover disease likely (PTH <2 x upper limit of
normal).
• Avoid if hypercalcaemia.
• Non-calcium-based binders are preferred in patients with severe
vascular and/or soft tissue calciﬁcations.
• Non-calcium, non-aluminium-containing binders, e.g. sevelamer
hydrochloride (Renagel®) or carbonate (Renvela®) and lanthanum
carbonate (Fosrenol®), allow calcium and aluminium to be avoided.
• They are much more expensive than calcium- or aluminium-based
binders.
• Equally as effective as CCPBs.
• Sevelamer is associated with slower progression of coronary
calciﬁcation and possibly with improved survival.
• Sevelamer lowers LDL cholesterol and may provide additional CV
risk reduction.

CKD-MBD: HYPERPHOSPHATAEMIA

• Magnesium-calcium combination binders, e.g. calcium acetate +
magnesium carbonate (Osvaren®), reduce calcium burden and
appear cost-effective (SE: GI, including diarrheoa).
• The recent KDIGO guidelines suggest current available evidence does
not favour a speciﬁc phosphate binder. Choice of agent in a particular
patient should 6 be based on serum biochemistry, presence of vascular
calciﬁcation, and bone histology (if available). A local policy will usually
be in place.
• One strategy is to use a combination of binding agents to reduce PO4,
avoid excessive calcium administration, and ameliorate the cost of
newer binders.
Adequate dialysis
• Dietary intake of PO4 exceeds daily removal by dialysis.
• A signiﬁcant amount of PO4 is in the intracellular compartment, so
signiﬁcant rebound occurs post-HD treatment. CAPD is more efﬁcient
at PO4 removal than HD.
• Poor PO4 control may be an indication for more frequent dialysis.
• Daily dialysis regimens can control PO4, with no binder requirement
(supplementation is often necessary!).

Aluminium toxicity
History. In the 1970–80s, clusters of dialysis units reported patients
with aluminium toxicity. Investigation identiﬁed a high geographic concentration in dialysate water as the cause, and improved puriﬁcation
techniques eliminated this route of exposure. Aluminium-containing
phosphate binders were left as the main source.
Presentation. Aluminium toxicity (ld PTH secretion, d mineralization,
and d osteoblastic activity) previously accounted for the majority of low
turnover bone pathology. This was often painful, with an i risk of fracture. Also: ESA-resistant anaemia, encephalopathy, and neurotoxicity.
Current practice. Aluminium-containing phosphate binders should generally be avoided (use for a limited period, e.g. <4 weeks, a possible
exception). If extended use is necessary, aluminium levels should be
monitored. Serum aluminium should be <20 micrograms/L (0.7μmol/L)
in dialysis patients. Levels >60 micrograms/L (2.2μmol/L) suggest aluminium overload. Sequential levels may detect the development of
overload in at-risk patients. However, serum aluminium is not a reliable indicator of overall body content, and a desferrioxamine (DFO)
stimulation test may be required (l rise in aluminium level after IV
DFO). Symptomatic patients may beneﬁt from regular DFO chelation treatment. Interestingly, recent data suggest that long-term use of
aluminium-based binders in dialysis patients is not associated with toxicity as measured by desferrioxamine (DFO) stimulation test, so perhaps
their clinical use is about to go full circle.

Renal bone disease management summary
SHPT
• Check Ca2+ and PO4, PTH, and 25(OH)D, according to Table 3.11
(b p. 241) (more often if treatment changes made).
• If serum 25(OH)D <30ng/mL (<75nmol/L), consider replacement
(b p. 250).
• Aim to reduce serum PO4 to the normal range through a combination
of diet, phosphate binders, and adequate dialysis (b p. 246).
• Once PO4 controlled, add alfacalcidol or calcitriol, titrating the dose
to achieve a locally agreed target PTH, according to CKD stage
(b p. 244).
• Aim to keep serum Ca2+ in the normal range (If i Ca2+, switch to
non-calcium-containing binder; review dialysate Ca2+; reduce/stop
vitamin D, as necessary).
• Uncontrolled SHPT: review diet; review compliance (especially
before prescribing multiple expensive therapies); intensify phosphate
binder and vitamin D therapy, as serum Ca2+ allows.
• Consider paricalcitol (b p. 251) and cinacalcet (b p. 252) if high
calcium limits vitamin D treatment.
• Parathyroidectomy: reserve for those cases refractory to medical
management (b p. 254).
ABD
• Aim to increase PTH-driven bone turnover:
• Reduce or stop calcium-containing binders and vitamin D
analogues (aim for serum Ca2+ in the normal range).
• Lowering dialysate calcium concentration (e.g. 1.0mmol/L for both
HD and CAPD) may help d Ca2+ and i PTH.
• Exclude signiﬁcant aluminium deposition, if applicable (b p. 247).
• Exogenous PTH (pulsatile administration) and calcimimetics may
prove to have an anabolic role in ABD (circadian PTH release is
anabolic for bone, whereas sustained PTH release is catabolic).

249

250

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD-MBD: vitamin D treatment
There are two vitamin D treatment strategies in CKD—which are not
mutually exclusive.
• The conventional rationale is to suppress PTH and control SHPT.
• Failure of the kidney to produce 1,25(OH)2D is a key part of the
pathogenesis of SHPT, so it is logical that 1,25(OH)2D replacement
should form part of management.
• Vitamin D requires 1A-hydroxylation in the kidney for activation.
In renal failure, this can be pharmacologically bypassed by using the
1A-hydroxylated analogues calcitriol or alfacalcidol (1A-calcidol).
• Newer vitamin D analogues, (e.g. paricalcitol or doxercalciferol)
provide alternatives.
• There is evidence (retrospective studies) that mortality d in dialysis
patients taking vitamin D, compared with those who do not.
• A newer justiﬁcation for vitamin D treatment is correction of vitamin
D ‘substrate’ deﬁciency, using non-activated vitamin D products
(colecalciferol, ergocalciferol).
• Largely based on theoretical beneﬁts (see Box 3.3) and assumes
independent beneﬁts for non-activated vitamin D via local
conversion of 25(OH)D l 1,25(OH)2D (autocrine effects) in a wide
range of target tissues. See also b p. 208.

Treatment: control of SHPT
• 2 Control serum phosphate ﬁrst.
• Start with a low dose (0.25 micrograms/day alfacalcidol PO), and increase,
as necessary, over several weeks (rarely, >0.5–1.0 micrograms/day).
• See b p. 244 for treatment targets; local policies may differ.
• Pulsed oral and IV therapy (usually 0.5–2.0 micrograms x3/week) are
an alternative to daily regimens and appear equally efﬁcacious. Giving
therapy, either IV or oral, during a dialysis treatment can aid compliance.
Monitoring Monitor serum Ca2+, PO4, and PTH (monthly initially).
Avoid i Ca2+ and PTH oversuppression.
Side effects and toxicity i Ca2+ and i CaxP (i GI absorption and i
mobilization from bone) frequently complicate treatment. More than just a
therapeutic inconvenience, this has implications for bone turnover (l ABD),
soft tissue/vascular calciﬁcation, and CV morbidity/mortality (b p. 242).

Treatment: ‘nutritional’ vitamin D deﬁciency
• Low serum 25(OH)D (calcidiol) levels are very common in patients
with CKD (<15ng/mL in 720% if GFR <30mL/min).
• Probable cause: comorbidity l sedentary indoor lifestyle l insufﬁcient
sunlight exposure ld available vitamin D substrate (rather than poor
dietary intake or a renal abnormality).
• KDIGO guidelines recommend screening in CKD stages 3–5.
• Serum 25(OH)D <30ng/mL (<75nmol/L) represents insufﬁciency, but
there is no real consensus on what deﬁnes ‘adequate’ levels.
• Usually treated with colecalciferol in formulations with calcium, e.g.
calcium 600mg with D3 400 units (one tablet bd). An alternative is

CKD-MBD: VITAMIN D TREATMENT

colecalciferol D3 as 20,000 unit capsules: two capsules once daily for
7 days, then maintenance 2 x 20,000 unit capsules x1/month. However,
there is no current consensus on repletion strategies. These doses
may actually have limited effects on vitamin D stores.
• The beneﬁts are not clear, but treatment appears very safe (with
little risk of i Ca2+, i CaxP, or PTH oversuppression, though modest
reduction in PTH may be seen).

Box 3.3 Vitamin D: beyond mineral metabolism
• Vitamin D-dependent genes are inﬂuenced through an intracellular
vitamin D receptor (VDR).
• In addition to its ‘classical’ role in mineral metabolism, vitamin D is
now known to exert various non-classical effects on cell function,
including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.
• This occurs across a variety of cell types (including leucocytes,
cardiac myocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and pancreatic islets).
• Vitamin D is involved in immune and inﬂammatory responses, the
RAS, and development of myocardial hypertrophy.
• It has been implicated (on epidemiological and biological evidence)
in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including psoriasis, various
cancers, diabetes mellitus, and i BP.
• 25(OH)D (calcidiol) is the major circulating form of vitamin D and is
measured in routine lab testing. Circulating 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol)
levels are 1,000-fold lower and much more difﬁcult to estimate.
• 25(OH)D may have beneﬁts independent of renal conversion and is
a better indicator of overall vitamin D status than 1,25(OH)2D.

Newer vitamin D analogues
• Much attention has been given to the development of vitamin D
analogues that suppress PTH, with less propensity to hypercalcaemia.
• Various mechanisms are proposed for this selective action, including
less GI Ca2+ absorption.
• They are members of a group of compounds known as vitamin D
receptor agonists (VDRAs) or ‘active vitamin D compounds’.
• Many have shown potential in the experimental setting, and a few
are available for clinical use (e.g. paricalcitol, 22-oxacalcitrol, and
doxercalciferol).
• Widely used outside the UK, especially the USA and Japan.
• They potently suppress PTH, but i Ca2+ and i CaxP do still occur.
• Advantages over calcitriol and alfacalcidol remain unproven, though
there may be marginal beneﬁts.
• X A large retrospective cohort study suggested a possible survival
advantage for patients treated with paricalcitol.
• A therapeutic trial may be warranted in patients prone to i Ca2+.
• Paricalcitol is given IV on dialysis (initially, dose is baseline PTH
in pg/mL divided by 80). An oral formulation is also available.
Doxercalciferol (not available in the UK) can be given IV or oral.
• Further randomized prospective studies are awaited.

252

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD-MBD: calcimimetics
The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR)
First cloned in 1993, the CaR is constitutively expressed across multiple
cell types and credited with roles in many aspects of cell function. Its main
purpose is the control of extracellular Ca2+ concentration and regulation
of steady state PTH secretion.

Calcimimetic agents
• Small molecules that bind to the parathyroid CaR and mimic the effect
of i extracellular Ca2+:
• Type I: include Ca2+ itself and other cationic compounds. Directly
activate the CaR.
• Type II: not strictly agonists but allosteric modulators that i
CaR sensitivity to ambient Ca2+. Cinacalcet is currently the only
calcimimetic available for clinical use.
• Calcimimetics d PTH, with a simultaneous d in serum Ca2+.
• Parallel reductions in PO4 and CaxP are also seen. In this respect, they
differ importantly from other available treatments (see Table 3.15).
• Side effects: dose-dependent upper GI intolerance, modest d Ca2+
frequent (though rarely problematic). Despite the ubiquitous distribution
of the CaR, CNS, cardiac, and other side effects not evident.
• Evidence for clinical efﬁcacy using biochemical endpoints is unequivocal
and has been shown to facilitate improved compliance with
international Ca2+, PO4, and PTH targets.
• d risk of parathyroidectomy, fracture, and cardiovascular
hospitalization in short-term studies.
• There is evidence that cinacalcet may improve CV calciﬁcation (large
vessels and cardiac valves). However, its impact on important CV
outcomes remains unknown; in the EVOLVE study, it did not reduce
risk of death or major CV events in dialysis patients with moderate to
severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
But:
• Expensive. Uptake in many countries likely to be limited (a NICE
guideline in the UK effectively restricts their use to refractory i PTH
where parathyroidectomy is contraindicated).
Role
More data are needed to decide where need is greatest.
• From the biochemical standpoint, therapy (vitamin D or calcimimetic)
can be chosen, according to the clinical phenotype of the patient (see
Table 3.16).
• The ‘vitamin D phenotype’: the SHPT patient in whom serum Ca2+,
PO4, and CaxP product are all low normal or subnormal. Vitamin
D therapy is usually effective in bringing biochemical parameters to
target. Risk of i Ca2+ or i PO4 is relatively low.
• The ‘calcimimetic phenotype’: potentially more difﬁcult to treat.
Here, SHPT is accompanied by a high normal or frankly elevated
Ca2+, often with i PO4 and CaxP product. Treatment with vitamin
D will d PTH but aggravate i Ca2+ and i PO4.

CKD-MBD: CALCIMIMETICS

• Vitamin D and calcimimetics work well together. Their modes of
action at the level of the parathyroid are different, and effects on PTH
suppression appear additive. Calcimimetics may d serum Ca2+, ‘making
room’ for the use of vitamin D analogues.

Dosing: cinacalcet (Mimpara® UK, Sensipar® USA)
Oral; initially, 30mg od, increased incrementally (60mg, 90mg, 120mg,
180mg), as necessary, to maintain target PTH. Check Ca2+ 2 weeks
after starting treatment and after any dose change. Hypocalcaemia may
require dose reduction. Ca2+ usually checked monthly for ﬁrst 6 months
and PTH 2–3-monthly.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD-MBD: parathyroidectomy
2 An elevated PTH alone is not an indication for parathyroidectomy.

Indications
• Tertiary or autonomous hyperparathyroidism: failure of hyperplasic,
overactive glands to suppress adequately in response to optimal
medical therapy.
• Manifests clinically as i PTH (usually >500pg/mL), with persistent i Ca2+.
• PO4 and alkaline phosphatase are usually raised.
• If calcium is low or normal, i PTH indicates SHPT, and further medical
treatment is necessary.
• Calcimimetic therapy (b p. 252) may prove to have a role in reducing
the need for parathyroidectomy and may be an alternative in those in
whom surgery has failed, is refused, or is deemed too high risk.
• Inappropriate parathyroidectomy may have deleterious consequences
for the skeleton (l low turnover disease).
Pre-op considerations
Imaging. Isotope scans (e.g. MIBI) allow localization of the parathyroid
glands prior to surgery and identify ectopic (e.g. retrosternal) tissue. USS
and CT can also be helpful (speak to your surgeon).
ENT. All patients should have their vocal cords visualized preoperatively—there is a risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve during
surgery, so pre-existing dysfunction needs documentation.
Prevention of ‘hungry bone syndrome’. Most likely if bone turnover is very
high (i alkaline phosphatase or subperiosteal resorption on X-ray. High
doses of active vitamin D pre-op (e.g. alfacalcidol 5 micrograms daily for
5 days) attenuates/prevents rapid and severe falls in Ca2+ post-operatively
(caused by calcium inﬂux into bone).
Post-op considerations
Haemorrhage. Rare but may cause tracheal compression. Monitor drains
carefully.
Hypocalcaemia. May be profound in the days following surgery. Check
Ca2+ 2–4h post-op, then 12h for 2–3 days. Give calcitriol or alfacalcidol
0.5–2.0 micrograms/day, with oral calcium (1–3g in divided doses). If
serum Ca2+ falls below 1.8mmol/L or tetany develops, administer IV calcium (see Box 3.4), and continue high-dose oral vitamin D.
PTH. Measured post-operatively to conﬁrm success (can also be measured intra-operatively).

Box 3.4 IV calcium post-parathyroidectomy
2 Start IVI 10% calcium gluconate 50mL in 500mL 5% glucose or 0.9%
saline, initially at 50mL/h. Recheck Ca2+ at +1h, and adjust infusion rate
accordingly. Cardiac monitoring required.
22 If tetany, give 10mL 10% calcium gluconate 10mL (2.2mmol) IVI over
3min ( extravasation—central vein preferable). Repeat if necessary or
infusion as described. Cardiac monitoring required.

CKD-MBD: PARATHYROIDECTOMY

Parathyroidectomy technique
The amount of parathyroid tissue removed at operation can be varied.
Partial parathyroidectomy. Parathyroid tissue is deliberately left behind in
an attempt to avoid the deleterious consequences of absent PTH (principally ABD). Unfortunately, further autonomous PTH secretion often
necessitates repeat (and technically more difﬁcult) surgery.
Total parathyroidectomy with reimplantation. Parathyroid tissue is
implanted into an extraparathyroid site (usually the arm). This tissue is
then more easily accessible if recurrent hyperparathyroidism develops.
Unfortunately, parathyroid regrowth in the neck remains common; the
implant may fail to ‘take’, or the implant itself may become autonomous
or even locally invasive.
Total parathyroidectomy. Attempted removal of all parathyroid tissue.
Leaves the patient hypoparathyroid, with risk of ABD. Serum calcium
is subsequently maintained with calcitriol or alfacalcidol. Regrowth of
islands of parathyroid cells is not uncommon. Small nests of residual
cells often mean that serum PTH will increase with time.
Radiological ablation. Ultrasound localization and ablation through ethanol injection has met with limited success. Direct injection of active
vitamin D compounds into the largest gland(s) is successfully used in
some countries.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Calciﬁc uraemic arteriolopathy
(calciphylaxis)
Deﬁnition
Calciﬁc uraemic arteriolopathy (CUA), or calciphylaxis, is a small vessel
vasculopathy involving mural calciﬁcation, with intimal proliferation,
ﬁbrosis, and thrombosis. It occurs predominantly in individuals with renal
failure and results in ischaemia and necrosis of skin, soft tissue, visceral
organs, and skeletal muscle.

Incidence
First described in 1962, but better recognition in recent years has contributed to an increasing incidence. However, recent estimates of a 4%
prevalence in ESRD programmes are probably too high (closer to 71%).
2 Mortality 745% at 1 year (almost always due to sepsis).
Pathogenesis is poorly understood. Abnormal skeletal and mineral
metabolism certainly appears to play an important role, but many patients
do not have uncontrolled CKD-MBD at the time of presentation.
Reduction in key inhibitors of calciﬁcation (e.g. fetuin-A, matrix Gla protein), an increase in reactive oxygen species, and inﬂammatory cytokines
all contribute. Multiple risk factors, some of which are iatrogenic, have
been documented. What creates a ‘perfect storm’ for the development of
CUA in an individual patient remains undetermined.

Risk factors
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Uraemia (though also seen post-transplantation and in primary HPT).

Elevated alkaline phosphatase.
Caucasian race.
Obesity.
Malnutrition and low serum albumin.
Warfarin.
Protein C and/or S deﬁciency.
Liver disease.
Corticosteroid treatment.

Presentation
• Painful erythematous livedo reticularis-like skin patches and plaques,
with violaceous mottling and subsequent ulceration. Panniculitis and s
infection follow.
• Surrounding soft tissue often feels hard and plaque-like.
• Two overlapping patterns have been described:
• Ulcers on the trunk, buttocks, or thighs (over adipose tissue in
more obese patients).

CALCIFIC URAEMIC ARTERIOLOPATHY (CALCIPHYLAXIS)

•
•
•
•

•

• Ulceration on the extremities (often in thinner malnourished
patients).
Not just a cutaneous disease—may occur in arterioles supplying other
organs (lung calciﬁcation on the CXR is common).
Bone scans often show increased uptake over lesions.
Awareness is often half the journey to diagnosis.
Skin biopsy is characteristic: medial calciﬁcation of cutaneous
arterioles, intimal hyperplasia, endovascular ﬁbrosis, inﬂammation,
thrombosis, luminal occlusion, necrosis, and panniculitis. Calcium stains
should be undertaken.
Differential diagnosis: vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, ulceration s
to macrovascular disease, cholesterol emboli.

Treatment
 No treatment is of proven beneﬁt.
• 2 Appropriate analgesia.
• Scrupulous wound care and avoidance of trauma (e.g. subcutaneous
injections).
• Aggressive treatment of sepsis.
• Lower CaxP: avoid calcium-based binders; discontinue vitamin D
analogues; daily dialysis; lower dialysate Ca2+.
• Aggressive control of PO4 with non-calcium-based binders and dietary
restriction.
• Parathyroidectomy (or cinacalcet) may help if i PTH and i CaxP.
• Optimize tissue perfusion; revascularize, as necessary.
• Stop warfarin.
• Investigate for primary hypercoagulable/prothrombotic state.
• Hyperbaric oxygen has been used successfully.
• Interest in sodium thiosulphate has grown recently. Case series
have demonstrated enhanced pain relief and wound granulation.
Administered IV, with minimal side effects at low infusion rates
(l nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea). Two mechanisms of action:
• It is a powerful antioxidant.
• It sequesters calcium ions to form soluble calcium thiosulphate
complexes, thus preventing calcium deposition.
• Bisphosphonates have been used but may have deleterious effects on
bone metabolism in patients with pre-existing low turnover disease.
• Steroids probably of no beneﬁt ( sepsis).

There are several calciphylaxis registries to which clinicians are encouraged to submit both patient data and tissue specimens. For example,
the UK calciphylaxis registry is part of the international collaborative
calciphylaxis network and can be accessed at M http://www.calciphylaxis.org.uk.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Diet and nutrition in CKD
Dietary advice is extremely important in the management of CKD and the
maintenance of broader health in CKD patients.

Measurement of nutritional status
2 No single parameter should be considered in isolation.
Assessment should include:
• History and examination to identify ongoing medical problems that
may limit nutritional intake—psychosocial issues may be important.
• Dietary interview or diary. Quantitative intake of nutrients.
• Subjective global assessment (SGA). SGA is based on subjective and
objective assessment of several patient parameters, including factors
in the history and examination, GI symptoms, body weight patterns,
functional capacity, and the presence of comorbid conditions that
may inﬂuence nutritional requirements. Patients are assigned to one
of three nutritional states: (i) well nourished; (ii) mild to moderately
malnourished, or (iii) severely malnourished. This simple score is well
validated in CKD and powerful enough to predict outcome.4
• Anthropometric measurements. BMI, skinfold thickness, estimated %
weight loss, and mid-arm muscle circumference.
• Serum albumin. Reﬂects not only protein intake, but susceptible to
changes with inﬂammation or infection. 2 A strong predictor of future
mortality in new starters on dialysis.
• Adequacy of dialysis. Inadequate dialysis is a common contributing
factor to malnutrition (uraemic toxins are anorectic and
proinﬂammatory). Dialysis adequacy should be assessed in conjunction
with the normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), which is a measure
of the rate of urea formation. When a patient is in steady state, urea
formation correlates with protein intake and protein breakdown.
Fluid restriction
• CKD stages 4–5. Fluid and salt restriction are often important to
prevent volume overload.
• On dialysis. When the urine output drops, ﬂuid restriction is vital to
minimize weight gains. Aim for weight gains of 1–1.5kg or less/day. In
an anuric patient, this means a ﬂuid restriction of 750–1,000mL. 2 This
must be combined with salt restriction.
Protein intake
• Intake averages 780g/day in the developed world, although
requirements may be only 50g.
• A low-protein diet has been shown to slow the progression of
renal failure in patients with CKD (b p. 208). Set against this is the
danger of patients reaching dialysis with signiﬁcant malnutrition. Most
advocate no more than moderate protein restriction. Daily protein
targets:
• 0.8–1.0g/kg per day for CKD stages 4–5.
• 1.2g/kg per day when on dialysis.
• Protein sources include meat, ﬁsh, eggs, milk, nuts, pulses, and beans.

DIET AND NUTRITION IN CKD

Carbohydrate intake
• Adequate energy intake is essential for patients with CKD, especially
those undergoing protein restriction.
• Target 30–35kcal/kg per day.
• Sources: mainly complex carbohydrates, some from mono- or
polyunsaturated fats. Combining a diabetic diet with a renal diet can be
difﬁcult and requires expert support.
• Examples: sugar, jams, marmalade, specialist high-energy renal drinks.
Phosphate restriction (see also b p. 246)
• The kidney is the main route of phosphate excretion. Aim to restrict
dietary phosphate to 0.8–1g/day, and target a serum phosphate in the
normal physiological range.
• Prescribe phosphate binders if dietary restriction alone fails
(b p. 246).
• Phosphate-rich foods include all protein-containing foods, making
phosphate restriction difﬁcult to achieve. Examples: milk, cheese,
custard, yogurt, ice cream, cola, chocolate drinks, beer, liver, baked
beans, dried peas and beans (e.g. chick peas), nuts, wholegrain
products, bran cereals, and, many, many convenience foods.
Potassium restriction
• Typical UK intake 750–120mmol/day. With failing renal function,
K+ excretion falls, making restriction necessary (esp. in patients
taking ACE-I, ARBs, and/or mineralocorticoid antagonists, such as
spironolactone).
• K+-rich foods include dairy products, potatoes (baked, chips, and
crisps), some fruits (bananas, grapes, dried fruit, fresh pineapple), fresh
fruit juice, tomatoes, sweet corn, mushrooms, chocolate, and coffee.
Salt restriction
• Typical UK intake 7150–200mmol/day (or 9–12g).
• This is a vast excess over physiological needs.
• Salt restriction is helpful if i BP ± volume overload (helps reduce
thirst and hence ﬂuid intake). Aim for an intake of <100mmol/day
(5–6g).
• Na+-rich foods include cheese, salted butter/margarine, salted meat
(bacon, ham, corned and luncheon meats), tinned meat, vegetables
and soups, crisps, soy sauce, many breads and cereals, salted nuts,
processed foods, and packaged meals.
There are several resources on the internet that can help patients and
their families to understand and adjust to these dietary restrictions. The
nutrition section of the US National Kidney Foundation website is a
good starting point (M http://www.kidney.org), and several cookbooks
are available.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Malnutrition in CKD
Malnutrition is common in CKD (affecting up to 50% of dialysis patients)
and a powerful predictor of survival. Contributors include:
• Anorectic uraemic toxins (e.g. leptin).
• Chronic low-grade inﬂammation.
• Dietary restrictions (low-protein diet, unbalanced low-phosphate diet).
• Medication (phosphate binders, oral iron).
• Dialysis itself (esp. CAPD where protein losses into the dialysate may
be 1–2g/L or 710g/day; this would be considered nephrotic range if lost
in the urine!).

Managing malnutrition in the CKD patient
• Assess the severity of malnutrition (b p. 258).
• Measure current nutritional intake.
• Address correctable factors:
• 2 Correct under-dialysis (e.g. change modality, improve access,
increase treatment time).
• Seek and treat occult infection.
• Investigate and treat GI problems, e.g. gastroparesis.
• Deﬁne and intervene if psychosocial problems.
• Consider dietary supplements:
• Wide range available.
• Renal-speciﬁc oral supplements are low in K+ and PO4 and are also
concentrated (limiting the volume of ﬂuid).
• Overnight nasoenteral (or PEG) feeding may be beneﬁcial in more
severe cases of malnutrition when adequate oral intake cannot be
maintained.
• IDPN (intradialytic parenteral nutrition). Given on dialysis, it
provides amino acids, glucose, and lipids. It is not a substitute for
oral supplements but can deliver 71,500kcal/session (of which at least
7500kcal are lost in dialysate!). However, it can be a useful adjunct if
the patient is able to manage 50% of the desired daily intake by mouth.
Expensive.
• X Amino acid containing PD solutions (Nutrineal®) may offer beneﬁt
in malnourished PD patients.
• Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) should be reserved for those who
cannot be fed enterally. Electrolyte quantities (particularly potassium,
phosphate, and magnesium) should be reduced and monitored daily.
• X Appetite stimulants/anabolic agents are of uncertain beneﬁt:
• Growth hormone (costly and long-term beneﬁt uncertain).
• Nandrolone (an androgen).

MALNUTRITION IN CKD

Inﬂammation in CKD
Patients with CKD have ongoing low-grade inﬂammation, with i acute
phase proteins (CRP, ferritin), i inﬂammatory cytokines, hypoalbuminaemia, and hypercholesterolaemia. Contributors include:
• Repeated infections.
• Oxidant stress (d levels of antioxidants, i oxidative and carbonyl
stress).
• Accumulation of AGEs.
• Arteriosclerosis and abnormal endothelial function.
• Malnutrition (both a cause and an effect of chronic inﬂammation).
Protein–energy malnutrition may coexist—there is increasing evidence that chronic inﬂammation and oxidant stress increase metabolic
demands and predispose to malnutrition. The triad of malnutrition,
inﬂammation, and accelerated atherosclerosis has been labelled the MIA
syndrome. A vicious cycle may ensue, often culminating in death from
cardiac disease. This may account for the apparent paradox that patients
on dialysis with a higher BMI tend to survive longer.

261

262

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Endocrine problems in CKD
Thyroid function
Tests may be difﬁcult to interpret, as thyroid-binding globulin is lost in
the urine if heavy proteinuria, causing a d measured T4. Clinical assessment and measurement of T3 and TSH may be necessary for correct
interpretation.

Adrenal axis function
Addison’s disease is difﬁcult to diagnose in the context of CKD, especially in dialysis patients, as the characteristic electrolyte changes may be
masked by renal dysfunction and dialysis. Suspect if persistent hypotension
(or postural hypotension). Many renal patients have received corticosteroid therapy, with consequent steroid-related side effects.

Sexual dysfunction (5)
Reduced libido frequent. Comorbidity (vascular disease, diabetes) and
concomitant drug treatment may be relevant. Altered body image and
self-perception may also play a role, as may depression and anxiety.
Offer counselling. 2 Anaemia contributes to reduced libido and should
be corrected. Disturbances in menstruation and fertility are common.
Amenorrhoea is virtually ubiquitous at ESRD. Gynaecological assessment
is often helpful.

Sexual dysfunction (4)
Erectile dysfunction is common. It may be multifactorial (arterial disease, neuropathy, psychological factors, side effects of drug treatment).
Where possible, treat the underlying cause. Testosterone deﬁciency is not
uncommon in dialysis patients and should be corrected with replacement
therapy. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as sildenaﬁl, are effective but
should be avoided in patients on nitrates, with signiﬁcant coronary artery
disease or hypotension. Vacuum devices or penile implants may be useful,
especially if a physical cause for impotence.

Hyperprolactinaemia
Elevated circulating prolactin concentrations, s to i secretion and d
clearance, are common in advanced CKD. Causes galactorrhoea (5) and
gynaecomastia (4). Bromocriptine or cabergoline may normalize levels.
The contribution of i prolactin to sexual dysfunction in both sexes is
unclear. Other causes, such as drugs (e.g. tricyclics, metoclopramide) or a
prolactinoma, may need exclusion.

Early menopause
Not associated with CKD per se but may occur in patients treated with
cyclophosphamide or other cytotoxic agents.

ENDOCRINE PROBLEMS IN CKD

Growth retardation in CKD
Resistance to growth hormone (GH) is an important consequence of
advanced CKD. Although circulating GH levels are normal (or elevated),
resistance to its action causes growth retardation in children and muscle
wasting in adults. This resistance is the consequence of multiple defects
in the GH/IGF-1 axis: GH receptor expression is downregulated, as is
the activity of the downstream JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway.
The expression and activity of IGF-1 (a major mediator of GH action)
are also signiﬁcantly reduced. Growth delay can now be treated with
recombinant GH. Other contributors to growth retardation are steroid
therapy, malnutrition, and osteodystrophy.

263

264

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD management overview
General advice (all stages)
• Exclude AKI.
• Explanation, education, and reassurance regarding the causes and
consequences of CKD.
• Smoking cessation.
• Weight reduction if obese.
• Encourage aerobic exercise.
• Aspirin 75mg, according to 10-year CV risk estimate.
• Treat lipids, according to best practice guidelines.
• Avoid NSAIDs and other nephrotoxic drugs.
• Limit alcohol to <3 units per day (4) or 2 units per day (5).
• Vaccination against inﬂuenza and pneumococcus.

CKD stages 1–3
• 2 Most of these patients will not progress to kidney failure, so the
emphasis should be on CV risk reduction.
• Can usually be effectively managed in primary care setting.
• Suggested criteria for referral to a specialist renal service are shown
on b p. 265.
• Stages 1–2—at least annual follow-up:
• eGFR, urinalysis, and uACR/uPCR.
• Meticulous BP control; use ACE-I (see b p. 204 for targets).
• Stage 3—at least 6-monthly follow-up:
• USS of urinary tract if lower urinary tract symptoms.
• eGFR, urinalysis, and uACR/uPCR.
• Meticulous BP control; use ACE-I (see b p. 204 for targets).
• Anaemia management. If Hb <11g/dL, exclude other causes; check
iron stores, and refer for consideration of IV iron and ESA therapy
(b p. 222).
• 6-monthly check of serum calcium and phosphate.
• PTH at baseline; 6–12-monthly if abnormal.

CKD stages 4–5
• Refer to a specialist unit (2 urgently if stage 5). Late referral of
patients with advanced CKD is associated with poor outcomes.
• Full dietary assessment (b p. 258).
• Anaemia management.
• CKD-MBD management (b p. 249).
• Correct acidosis (b p. 205).
• Immunize against hepatitis B.
• Information and discussion regarding future treatment choices; dialysis
modalities, options for transplantation, or conservative/palliative
treatment (b p. 266).

CKD MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW

When to refer to specialist care
• What do nephrologists do for patients with CKD?
• Diagnose and manage treatable kidney disease.
• Identify and control risk factors for progression.
• Manage s complications, such as anaemia.
• Plan for RRT in patients progressing to kidney failure.
• It is not possible, or necessary, for all CKD patients to be seen in
specialist clinics.

Referral guidelines
Even if seen for specialist review, subsequent follow-up can continue in
primary care, with appropriate shared care protocols. Consider referral if:
• eGFR <30mL/min.
• eGFR <60mL/min, and any of:
• Progressive fall (>5mL/min in 1 year or >10mL/min in 5 years).
• Microscopic haematuria.
• Proteinuria (uACR >70mg/mmol, uPCR >100mg/mmol) unless
known to be due to diabetes and appropriately treated.
• >15% decline in eGFR with commencement of an ACE-I or ARB
(? renovascular disease).
• Suspected systemic illness (e.g. SLE, myeloma).
• Hb <11g/dL, with no other explanation.
• Abnormal calcium, phosphate, or PTH.
• Refractory i BP (>150/90 despite three antihypertensive agents).
• eGFR >60mL/min and other evidence of renal disease/damage:
• uACR >70 or uPCR >100mg/mmol.
• uACR >30 or uPCR >50mg/mmol and microscopic haematuria.
• Abnormal renal imaging, e.g. renal cysts.
• Other indications:
• 2 Suspected acute kidney injury.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Advanced CKD care
The transition from CKD to ESRD is a physically and psychologically
demanding time (see Fig. 3.8). Such patients are best cared for by a multidisciplinary team (see 76-weekly, more often in the latter stages), with
attention to:
• Ongoing measures to minimize rate of progression.
• Dietary intervention.
• Active management of complications (anaemia, CKD-MBD, malnutrition).
• Pre-dialysis counselling: choice of dialysis modality, individualized
advice and support in the decision-making process.
• Pre-dialysis and pre-transplant information and support sessions.
Ideally involving expert patients (peer supporters); see ‘Education’.
• Preparation for transplantation: education; identify potential living
donors. 2 Pre-emptive transplantation should be the goal, if possible.
• Formation of dialysis access (surgical review at least 6 months prior to
start of dialysis is desirable).
• Access to palliative services for those who elect not to undertake
dialysis treatment or to help manage symptom burden.
• Timing initiation of dialysis—avoid symptomatic uraemia.

Composition of an advanced CKD clinic
• Nephrologist.
• Specialist nurses (e.g. pre-dialysis counselling, anaemia management,
pre-transplant assessment, dialysis access preparation, palliative care).
• Renal dietitian.
• Vascular access and transplant surgeon.
• Pharmacist.
• Social worker.
• Counsellor.

Education
• Deﬁned education programme, involving specialist nurses and expert
patients (peer support).
• Start when eGFR ≤20mL/min (ideally 12 months prior to RRT).
• Use a variety of techniques to impart information—1:1 sessions, group
education, culturally appropriate written material, visual aids (DVDs,
image library), practical demonstrations, web-based material.
• Include information on:
• Functions of the kidney.
• Implications of impaired kidney function.
• Cardiovascular risk and lifestyle modiﬁcation.
• Symptoms to expect as function declines.
• Concept of integrated care—they may need to move between
different treatment modalities over time.
• Detailed discussion on different dialysis options, with practical
demonstrations and visits to PD and HD departments.
• Transplant options.
• Deﬁne treatment plan when eGFR approaches 15mL/min—allows for
timely access preparation and assessment for a home-based therapy, if
required.

ADVANCED CKD CARE

When to start dialysis
• The IDEAL study compared ‘early’ (eGFR 10–15mL/min) vs ‘late’
(5–7mL/min) commencement of dialysis and showed no survival
beneﬁt. However, quality of life is just as important a consideration.
• Guidelines recommend considering the commencement of dialysis
when GFR <15mL/min. However, this requires careful discussion
with the patient and consideration of the risks and beneﬁts
associated with RRT. Symptoms and signs of advanced CKD (e.g.
persistent nausea and vomiting, anorexia, malnutrition, volume
overload, restless eggs), comorbidity, functional status, and physical
and the psychological and social consequences of starting dialysis all
need to be taken into account.
• GFR ≤5–7mL/min, whether symptomatic or not.
• Refractory hyperkalaemia, acidosis, pulmonary oedema, pericarditis,
encephalopathy, and neuropathy are all (urgent) indications for
dialysis (the aim should be to start dialysis before these are present).
• 2 Pre-emptive transplantation is the treatment of choice of ESRD.
Consider when GFR <20mL/min. If not possible, discuss whether a
home-based therapy (HD or PD) is suitable. Early planning leads to
improved choice.

Fig. 3.8 A pathway of care for advanced CKD. ‘Crash landers’ (or unplanned
starters): these individuals are unknown to renal services and present as
emergencies within 90 days of needing RRT (725–30% of patients entering ESRD
programmes annually). They miss out on pre-emptive education, usually start
on HD with temporary vascular access, and have worse outcomes in general.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Conservative treatment of
CKD: symptomatic management
of ESRD
As CKD advances, so does the symptom burden. Over half of patients
who follow a conservative (i.e. non-dialytic) management pathway report
poor mobility, weakness, pain, and pruritus, and over one-third report
poor appetite, difﬁculty sleeping, drowsiness, dyspnoea, and constipation.
With proactive identiﬁcation and management, the distress and disability
caused by these symptoms can be considerably eased (see Table 3.17).
Many units now run a service speciﬁcally for such patients, concentrating
resources and care to provide physical and social support. Patients may
become increasingly reliant on family members and other carers. District
nurses, social workers, home care teams, physiotherapists, occupational
therapists, and hospice services should be involved, as required.

CHAPTER 3

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Conservative treatment of CKD: general
The decision not to have dialysis
• Patients who start dialysis with signiﬁcant comorbidity and functional
dependence typically have a short survival time, which may be ﬁlled
with hospital admissions, painful illnesses, and unpleasant procedures.
• For such patients, continuing supportive care without commencing
dialysis may allow a better quality of life, with little or no reduction in
life expectancy.
• The decision whether to commence dialysis at ESRD is ultimately
made by the patient (assuming the patient has capacity). The renal
team has a duty to ensure that this decision is as informed as possible
by explaining the implications of withholding dialysis and the pros and
cons of commencing it. Family members should also be involved.
• The process cannot be rushed. A decision not to accept dialysis
should be made over time and be consistently held.
• Patients may (and often do) change their minds (in either direction).
• If severely uraemic, a patient may be unable to be involved in the
decision-making process.
• It can be difﬁcult to determine whether debility is uraemic in origin
(and 6 potentially reversible) or s to pre-existing comorbidity.
• Patients referred late have no time to go through the pre-dialysis
counselling process and may be denied the opportunity to make
informed decisions about their care.

Withdrawal of dialysis
• As with the decision of not to start dialysis, the decision to withdraw
should be made by the patient with the help and support of the
multidisciplinary team.
• Withdrawal means that death will probably occur within a few days
if the patient has no signiﬁcant residual renal function. The decision
to withdraw may be prompted by a catastrophic medical event (e.g.
a CVA, loss of vascular access). Less often, it is the culmination of a
number of smaller events, which have, in the view of the patient, had
unacceptable consequences for their quality of life.
• Depression should be looked for and treated.
• The decision to withdraw should be made over a period of time and
be held consistently.

Care of the dying patient
• The patient should be able to die peacefully and with dignity, in a
place of his or her choosing, surrounded by loved ones. This requires
planning so that care at home, in a hospice, or in hospital can be
arranged at short notice.
• Agreed care pathways may facilitate the management of the last few
days of life.
• Family support: before death, family members may be involved in the
physical care of the patient and need support and help. At the time
of death and afterwards, help should be available to cope with the
grieving process (this will need to be culturally appropriate).

CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT OF CKD: GENERAL

Analgesia in advanced CKD
• Pain is under-recognized and undertreated in patients with kidney
disease. The fact that it is more difﬁcult to treat is no excuse for
inadequate management.
• Opiate analgesia is very effective but must be used with caution.
Accumulation l signiﬁcant side effects: constipation, drowsiness,
confusion, respiratory depression, twitching, and seizures.
• If uncertain, seek expert pain advice.
• Use the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder.
Step 1
• Paracetamol: safe and effective in CKD. Requires no dose adjustment.
• NSAIDs:
• Usually contraindicated (pre-dialysis l deterioration in GFR; dialysis
ld residual renal function).
• Can be an effective short-term measure, esp. musculoskeletal pain.
• Co-prescribe a PPI, as gastritis common.
Step 2
• Tramadol: 90% renally excreted, so d dose and i interval (start
50mg 12h).
• Avoid codeine and dihydrocodeine if eGFR <15mL/min.  Hepatic
metabolites accumulate in CKD. If used, reduce dose by 50%.
Step 3
Drug choice will depend on acuteness and severity of pain, desirable route
of administration, and local availability. SC can be used for rapid relief, with
subsequent conversion to oral or transdermal.
• Morphine or diamorphine:
•  Avoid, if possible, as breakdown products accumulate.
• If used short-term—morphine: initially 2.5mg SC 4–12h prn.
• Diamorphine: initially 1.25mg SC 4–12h prn.
• Buprenorphine:
• Effective. Nausea a prominent side effect.
• 200–400 micrograms sublingual or transdermal patches.
• Alfentanil:
• First-line SC opioid in renal failure.
• SC 250 micrograms 2–4h.
• Can be given as a continuous infusion.
• Use fentanyl for breakthrough, as alfentanil has short half-life.
• Fentanyl:
• <10% renally excreted.
• SC 25 micrograms 3–6h. Lozenges for breakthrough pain.
Transdermal patch very effective once pain controlled by
other means.
• Hydromorphone: initially 1.3mg orally 6–8-hourly + 1.3mg prn for
more severe pain.
• Oxycodone: start with OxyNorm® (initially 2.5mg 8–12h) for rapid pain
control, and convert to OxyContin® for less frequent administration.
• Methadone: hepatic metabolites excreted in faeces. However, large
interpatient pharmacokinetic variability means it should probably be
reserved for use by physicians familiar with its eccentricities.

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Dialysis: an introduction
Normal functioning kidneys:
• Remove excess salt, water, and acid.
• Remove or regulate other electrolytes (e.g. K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, PO4).
• Remove waste products of metabolism (Ur and Cr are measured
routinely, but there are many others).
• Make erythropoietin.
• 1A-hydroxylate (and 6 activate) vitamin D.
Dialysis acts as surrogate for all but the last two of these (which can be
achieved pharmacologically). Even at best, it is only partially effective.
Transplantation more completely (but still partially) replaces normal kidney function and should be regarded as the optimum treatment of ESRD.
Transplanted patients survive longer and have a better quality of life.
However, not everyone is ﬁt for transplantation—ESRD patients are often
frail, with appreciable comorbidity, especially vascular disease.

Registry data and international comparisons
In the UK there are now 23,500 prevalent HD patients (365 PMP) and
74000 PD patients (61 PMP). Annual dialysis growth has been declining in
recent years and now stands at 72% for HD (with a decrease of 72% for
PD). The median age of prevalent patients is 58 years. Incidence rates have
been stable since 2006, but with an increase in patients > age 65 (Fig. 4.1).

Resources
Dialysis (and transplantation) are expensive. The cost of RRT is estimated
to account for 1–2% of the total NHS budget, even though it affects just

DIALYSIS: AN INTRODUCTION

0.05% of the population. The tariff for hospital or satellite based HD in the
UK is currently 7£23,000 per annum, depending on locality (with a ‘bestpractice’ supplement for those dialysing through an AV ﬁstula). Although
all modalities are expensive, transplantation is the most cost effective (but
only after the ﬁrst year). In the US (2011), Medicare expenditure on RRT
rose to 7$30 billion (7$25 billion HD, $1.5 billion PD, 7$3 billion transplantation). Per patient per year the costs were: HD 7$88,000, PD 7$72,000,
transplant 7$33,000.

International data
• Prevalence rates of RRT vary across Europe and are often higher than
in the UK.
• In the USA there were 7430,000 prevalent dialysis patients in 2011
(HD 7395,000, PD 731,500). However, the annual growth rate (3.4%)
was the lowest for 30 years. Total ESRD prevalence was 1,901 PMP.
• 7101,000 patients started HD therapy in the US (80% of whom started
on a dialysis catheter, rather than with an AVF. An astonishing 40% had
not seen a nephrologist prior to reaching ESRD), 77,500 started PD
and 72,500 received a pre-emptive transplant. 16% started RRT with an
eGFR of 15mL/min or over.
• The overall adjusted incidence of ESRD in the US was 357 PMP (Caucasian
280 PMP, Black 940 PMP, Native American 453 PMP, Asian 399 PMP,
Hispanic 518 PMP). Diabetes mellitus was the most common cause of ESRD,
followed by hypertension (source: USRDS Annual Data Report 2013).

Survival
RRT patients age 30–34 have a mortality rate 25x higher than the age
matched general population (for patients age >85 it is still 73x higher).
Median survival for patients starting RRT in the age group 45–54 is currently 10.5 years, for age 55–64 it is 5.6 years and for age 65–74, 3 years.
The relative risk of death for prevalent RRT patients (UK 2010) was 6.6.
Diabetic patients have worse survival than non-diabetic patients. The survival in older age groups is only slightly better than in patients with lung
cancer. (See Fig. 4.2 for Kaplan–Meir curve.)

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Haemodialysis (HD)
Overview
• During dialysis, blood is exposed to dialysate (with physiological
concentrations of electrolytes) across a semi-permeable membrane.
• Small molecules such as Ur (MW 60Da), Cr (MW113Da) and
electrolytes pass through pores in the membrane. Large molecules
such as albumin (MW 60,000Da), IgG (MW 140,000Da) and blood cells
do not.
• Concentration differences across the membrane allow molecules to
diffuse down a gradient. This allows waste products to be removed
and desirable molecules or ions (e.g. HCO3–) to be replaced.
• Water can be driven through the membrane by hydrostatic force
(ultraﬁltration, UF).
• By varying the pressure gradient across the membrane
(transmembrane pressure, TMP), water removal can be controlled.
• In addition to a means to remove water (71–4L) that has
accumulated between dialysis sessions (ingestion of ﬂuid, foods,
and by-product of metabolism), UF can also be used as a means of
solute clearance by convection.

What is required for haemodialysis?
• Dialysis membrane (b p. 284): a biocompatible membrane with
adequate surface area/permeability for solute clearance and
ultraﬁltration.
• Dialysate (b p. 282): of sufﬁcient purity and containing the required
concentration of electrolytes.
• Effective control and safety mechanisms (b p. 280): pumps for blood
and dialysate ﬂow, TMP, temperature, detection of blood leaks or air.
• Vascular access: large volumes of blood are removed from a patient,
exposed to a dialysis membrane, and then returned. Options are:
• AVF ﬁstula: optimal form of vascular access (b p. 292).
• PTFE graft: second best (b p. 292).
• Tunnelled, cuffed central venous catheter: ideally not long term (b
p. 296).
• Temporary central venous catheter: for immediate use; e.g. in AKI.
(b p. 180).
• Anticoagulation (b p. 290): prevents blood clotting in the
extracorporeal circuit.

Haemodialysis and haemoﬁltration
Haemodialysis
• Solute clearance by diffusion (mainly).
• Dialysate is required.
• Diffusion is maximized by maintaining high-ﬂow rates of blood
and dialysate and by pumping the two through the dialyser in
countercurrent directions.
• Larger MW (>20kDa) molecules are generally poorly removed.
• Usually administered intermittently (e.g. 4h, 3x/week).

HAEMODIALYSIS (HD)

Haemoﬁltration
•
•
•
•

Solute clearance by convection (mainly).
Achieved by generating a TMP across the membrane.
No dialysate required.
Large volumes need to be ﬁltered to achieve adequate solute
clearance. This would cause hypovolaemia unless replacement ﬂuid
administered (usually pre-prepared 5–10L bags).
• Removes larger MW (30–50kDa) molecules (e.g. vitamin B12 and B2
microglobulin) more efﬁciently than dialysis.
• Continuous (24h) HF is associated with greater haemodynamic stability
and often favoured for RRT in a critical care setting (b p. 174).

Haemodiaﬁltration
- Enhances clearance of middle molecules by combining diffusion (HD) and
convection (HF) to obtain the best from both modalities. See ﬁgure 4.x.
- Both dialysate and replacement ﬂuid are required. Online HDF
(OL-HDF) uses ultrapure dialysate produced by the dialysis machine as
replacement ﬂuid. This i convective volume and d cost.
- Beneﬁts potentially include superior removal of higher MW uraemic
toxins, greater haemodynamic stability and d ESA requirements.
- HDF may also be associated with d mortality (DOPPS 2006), although
two RCTs (CONTRAST and the Turkish OL-HDF study) failed to
prove this convincingly (although post hoc analysis of CONTRAST
did show a 39% mortality risk reduction in patients receiving higher
convection volumes (>22L/session)).
- A recent large (>900 patients) RCT with 3-year follow-up (ESHOL)
reported that post-dilution (see ﬁgure 2.16) OL-HDF improves allcause mortality (30% risk reduction—principally stroke and infection),
in comparison to standard high-ﬂux HD.
- Post hoc analysis showed a 40% and 45% mortality reduction in
those receiving convection volumes of 23–25 L/session and 25 L/
session, respectively (possibly confounded by better dialysis access
and longer hours in this group—both confer a survival beneﬁt).
- Whether the apparent beneﬁt seen is the result of improved middle
MW toxins (e.g. β2 microglobulin), greater haemodynamic stability,
less intradialytic d BP, or other factor is uncertain. Regardless,
OL-HDF is likely to become increasingly popular, particularly in the
subgroup of patients with no residual renal function and greater
propensity for haemodynamic instability.
Potential indications
- Patients with no imminent transplant options; e.g. highly sensitized
patients on the deceased donor waiting list.
- Large patients already on 4.5-5h high-ﬂux dialysis with sub-optimal
clearance.
- Long-term dialysis patients.
- Patients with symptomatic hypotensive episodes on dialysis.
- Patients with post-dialysis symptoms and long recovery time.
- Patients generally not thriving on dialysis (after other causes excluded).

Apparatus
•

•

Blood pump: usually a roller ‘peristaltic’ pump.
Bubble trap: traps air ld risk of air embolism.
Blood ﬂow rate: usually 200–500mL/min.
Dialysate ﬂow rate: up to 600mL/min.
Heaters: dialysate and blood are kept at 37*C.
Dialyser: a rigid polyurethrane shell (730cm long), containing hollow
ﬁbres (capillaries) of dialysate membrane. This arrangement maximizes
the available surface area for dialysis (0.5–2.1m2). Two ports each allow
blood and dialysate to enter and exit. Priming volume (saline) 750–100mL.
• Dialyser efﬁciency: depends on membrane thickness, pore size, and
dialyser structure. Efﬁciency of solute clearance is measured as KoA
(mass transfer urea coefﬁcient), provided for each dialyser by the
manufacturer. KoA varies from 300 to 1,100 (>600 = high efﬁciency
dialyser, requiring higher blood and dialysate ﬂows).

HAEMODIALYSIS APPARATUS

Alarms and monitors
These will stop the blood pump and clamp lines if the situation demands,
effectively creating what is known as a ‘closed circuit’.
• Air detectors: located distally in the venous circuit, prevent air emboli.
• Pressure monitors:
• Arterial l detect d pressure s to poor access ﬂow and line
disconnections.
• Venous l detect i pressure s to resistance to venous return
(usually represents an access problem).
• Dialysate outﬂow pressure l monitor TMP (to vary UF rate).
• Dialyser integrity.
• Temperature.
• Conductivity:
• Electrical conductivity is used to monitor proportioning of dialysate
to water.
• Many machines use conductivity to enable changes to Na+
concentration.
Newer machines
• Blood volume monitoring: haematocrit (Hct) in the arterial line is used
as a surrogate for blood volume (d plasma H2O li Hct). Used to
ﬁne-tune UF and BP control.
• Access recirculation measurements: ensures the same small volume of
blood is not dialysed repetitively.
• Delivered Kt/V: Ur concentration in the dialysate outﬂow line or
dialysate conductivity used to calculate delivered dialysis dose.
• Vascular access monitoring: quickly alerts to the possibility that dialysis
cannulae or the vascular access device have become dislodged from
their normal working position.

Dialysis

Dialysate
Box 4.1 Summary
• A solution of ultrapure water, Na+ (132–150mmol/L), K+ (usually
1.0–3.0mmol/L), Ca2+ (1.0–1.25mmol/L), Mg2+, Cl–, dextrose, and
buffer.
• Ultrapure water is generated in a treatment plant (involves
microﬁlters, activated carbon, deionization, and reverse osmosis) to
exclude particulate matter, ions, and minerals potentially harmful to
humans (see Fig. 4.4).
• UK Renal Association standards for water purity are <0.25IU/mL
endotoxin, <100cfu/mL microbial count.
• H+ ions have a low plasma concentration and are not removed by
dialysis. Buffer (alkali equivalent) is added to dialysate instead.
• Bicarbonate is now preferred to acetate as a buffer.
• HD machines either mix dialysate concentrate, buffer, and water
for the individual patient or this is done centrally before distribution
around several machines.

Ultrapure water
An average patient is exposed to 560L of water during three HD sessions,

Carbon ﬁlters removes chlorine/chloramines to <0.1mg/L (chloramines can
lead to haemolysis). Softeners remove Ca2+ and Mg2+ by ionic exchange,
as ‘hard’ water can damage machines and cause muscle weakness. Micron
ﬁlters remove suspended particles. Reverse osmosis (RO) removes bacteria,
endotoxins, pyrogens, viruses, and solutes (can lead to hypotension, nausea, vomiting.) Regular testing must ensure purity standards (see Box 4.1).

DIALYSATE

Dialysate concentrates
Dialysate contains pure water as well as several different concentrates: sodium, potassium, calcium, bicarbonate, magnesium, and glucose.
In an ideal world, the proportions of each of these concentrates should be
individualized for every HD patient.
Potassium (K+)
Around 80–140mmol is removed per HD session. The gradient of K+
between serum and dialysate is important, and most K+ is removed in the
ﬁrst hour. Dialysate K+ varies from 1 to 3mmol/L. The higher the gradient, the more the K+ removal which is associated with a greater risk of
haemodynamic instability.
Sodium (Na+)
Dialysate Na+ concentration controls salt and water removal from the
plasma (see b p. 301).
Bicarbonate (HCO3–)
HD aims to ameliorate a pre-dialysis acidosis without causing a post-dialysis
alkalosis. Dialysate concentrations vary from 36 to 40mmol/L.
Calcium (Ca2+)
40% of plasma calcium is bound to protein, the remainder is ionized
(1.1–1.5mmol/L) and therefore dialysable. Guidelines recommend lowering dialysate Ca2+ to maintain neutral or negative Ca2+ balance to prevent
vascular calciﬁcation. However, higher patient:dialysate gradients are associated with sudden cardiac death. Most units utilise a dialysate Ca2+ of
1.25mmol/L.

Dialysis

Dialysers and membranes
Biocompatibility
• Dialysis membranes are not inert. They can activate complement and
inﬂammatory cascades (l short- and long-term complications).
• A biocompatible membrane is one that elicits the minimum
inﬂammatory response in patients exposed to it.
• Improved biocompatibility may l:
• d hypersensitivity reactions.
• Less intradialytic d BP.
• Slower loss of residual renal function.
• Improved nutrition.
• d amyloid deposition.
• d morbidity and mortality (X).
Cellulose membranes (e.g. Cuprophan®)
• The original membrane and least biocompatible.
• Largely superseded by synthetic membranes.
Modiﬁed cellulose (e.g. Hemophan®)
More biocompatible.
Synthetic membranes (e.g. Polysulfone®, polyamide, polyacrylnitrile)
• More recently developed.
• Most biocompatible.
• More permeable than cellulose membranes:
• Solute clearance similar to cellulose membranes.
• iB2 microglobulin clearance.
High vs low ﬂux
High-ﬂux membranes are usually synthetic membranes with a large pore
size l enhanced clearance of middle and large molecules. X May lead to
better outcomes.

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Dialysis prescription and adequacy
Introduction
Intermittent HD places exacting demands on a patient. As it only partially
replaces renal function, ﬂuid and dietary restrictions remain signiﬁcant and
burdensome.
Dialysis can be considered adequate if it provides relief of uraemic
symptoms and controls acidosis, ﬂuid balance, and serum K+. It should
also allow a feeling of physical and psychological well-being.

Aspects of dialysis adequacy
• Solute clearance. Small molecule clearance is relatively easy to measure
(b p. 287). Aim to achieve a target Kt/V of >1.2 or URR >65% (see
box below).
• Blood pressure and ﬂuid balance. As a general rule, i BP in a dialysis
patient should be treated by d‘dry weight’ (i.e. post-dialysis weight).
This should be the weight at which salt and water balance is optimal.
Oligo-anuric patients (majority of long-term HD patients) need to
restrict their interdialytic salt and ﬂuid intake in order to achieve this,
aiming for weight gains of 1–2.5kg (maximum) between sessions.
It is difﬁcult to be achieve prescriptive BP targets in the HD population
(lack of evidence and a heterogeneous population). However, pre- and
post- dialysis BP <140/90mmHg is desirable. This would preferably be
achieved without anti-hypertensive medication. Inter- or intra-dialytic
hypotension should be avoided.
• Nutrition. Blood Ur levels depend on rate of production as well as
rate of excretion.  A low pre-dialysis Ur may reﬂect poor nutrition,
rather than good dialysis. Targets:
• Serum albumin >35g/L.
• Normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) >1.0g/kg/day (b p. 287).
• Acceptable anthropometric measures.
• Clearance of other molecules:
• ‘Middle’ molecule clearance thought to be important to prevent the
long-term complications of dialysis. B2 microglobulin is the most
used marker.
• Phosphate clearance is also important and appears to correlate
more with hours of dialysis than rate of small molecule clearance.
• Quality of life and life expectancy. There is a potential trade-off to be
made between the number of hours spent on the machine (i dialysis
dose) and quality of life. For patients with a limited life expectancy,
the latter may be a more important consideration (although reducing
hours below 4h 3x week is only rarely indicated).

DIALYSIS PRESCRIPTION AND ADEQUACY

Measuring dialysis adequacy
In the 1980s, the National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) established timed average Ur concentration as a determinant of morbidity
and mortality on HD. Subsequent mathematical analysis of these data
has led to the development of urea kinetic modelling (UKM) as the
accepted method of measuring small solute clearance.
Kt/V is a measure of Ur clearance where:
• K = dialyser urea clearance.
• t = time on dialysis.
• V = volume of distribution of Ur (estimated from patient size).
The single pool Kt/V assumes that, at the end of dialysis, the concentrations of intracellular and extracellular Ur are equal:
spKt / V = − ln[Upost/Upre − 0.008t ] + [ 4 − 3.5Upost/Upre ]
× UFvol/wtpost
(Upre, urea pre-dialysis; Upost, urea post-dialysis; UFvol, volume
removed on dialysis)
The two compartment model acknowledges that, in reality, it takes time
for Ur to be redistributed post-dialysis and that the extracellular Ur
concentration is lower than intracellular. An equilibrated Kt/V or eKt/V
can be calculated from the spKt/V.
A simpler measurement of Ur clearance is the urea reduction ratio
(URR), which does not take account of the amount of ﬂuid removed by
ultraﬁltration. It is thus less accurate but has been shown to correlate
with outcome:
URR =(1 − Upre/Upost) × 100

Normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR)
A measure of Ur generation, which reﬂects nutritional status. It can only
be reliably used in patients who are ‘stable’ so Ur generation will broadly
reﬂect protein intake. It is felt that patients require an nPCR >1.0g/kg/
day. nPCR of <0.8g/kg/day is associated with higher mortality.

Residual function
When HD is ﬁrst commenced, residual renal function may contribute
greatly to the total amount of solute clearance (Kru). This is usually
calculated with a 24h urine collection. Residual function tends to diminish quickly on HD (secondary to repetitive d BP 9 bio-incompatibility)
(b p. 284).

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Ensuring adequacy
Kt/V
UK and US guidelines suggest a single pool Kt/V >1.2 for patients dialysed x3/week, equating to a URR of 765%. The landmark HEMO study
compared two target Kt/V levels. Patients with a target Kt/V of 1.2 had
no difference in mortality or cardiac events, compared to those with a
Kt/V of 1.6.
2 Residual renal function should always be taken into account.

Prescribed vs delivered Kt/V—variables in the dialysis
prescription
Most guidelines suggest monthly measurement of Kt/V. Online methods of measuring Kt/V are provided on modern dialysis machines (often
using Na+ clearance to estimate urea clearance).
If Kt/V fails to meet target, options are to:
• Improve vascular access—if ﬂows are poor or if there is access
recirculation, it will be hard to improve clearances.
• Increase blood ﬂow/larger needles—beneﬁcial if access reasonable.
• Increase dialyser size—modest impact.
• Increase dialysate ﬂow.
• Increase dialysis time/frequency—major beneﬁt.
• Consider HDF.
Computer modelling software can help decide which elements of the
prescription require modiﬁcation to improve Kt/V.
 HD adequacy is multifaceted. Achieving a desired Kt/V does not necessarily equate to optimal dialysis.

DIALYSIS PRESCRIPTION AND ADEQUACY

Management of dialysis patients on non-renal wards
- For elective procedures, inform your renal team at the preassessment stage. On the day of admission contact them again
(arrangements for routine dialysis will need to be made).
- 1 Many dialysis patients are oligo-anuric, so DO NOT routinely
administer IV ﬂuids (unless the patient is haemodynamically
compromised—if so, use small boluses, assess volume status
regularly and call for expert help).
- 1 DO NOT give K+ supplementation. Discuss with renal team if
being considered.
- DO NOT place a urinary catheter unless there is a clear urological
indication. Oligo-anuria is virtually universal in this patient group!
- If the patient is clinically overloaded inform the renal team
immediately, as the patient may require urgent dialysis.
- Check U+E on admission. If K+ >5.5 mmol/L inform renal team.
- 1 When considering any new medication, check whether the drug
is safe in ESRD and if a dose adjustment is required. Be particularly
cautious with opiate analgesia and sedatives (accumulation!). 2 See
b p. 271 and discuss with the renal pharmacy team.
- Check (and document) daily weight.
- Does the patient have an AVF? NEVER insert an IV cannula into a
ﬁstula arm. The back of the hand on the non-ﬁstula arm is the best site.
- If patient has a dialysis central venous catheter (CVC), it should not
be used for anything else but HD.
- If a dialysis patient undergoes a general anaesthetic, their K+ must
be checked immediately on return to the ward. This K+ check
cannot wait until the following morning, even if the GA procedure is
performed late in the day or out of hours. If K+ >5.5mmol/L inform
the renal team - the patient may require dialysis.
- Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients should ideally continue their own
dialysis throughout their hospital admission. Ocassionally this may be
with the assistance of a relative or carer. Liaise with their PD team.
- If there is any concern that a patient will not be able to undertake
their own PD (e.g. confusion, neurological event, etc.), inform the
renal team ASAP, so that alternative arrangements can be made.

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Anticoagulation
Blood exposed to dialysis lines and membranes in an extracorporeal circuit
rapidly sees the induction of the extrinsic coagulation cascade. In order to
ensure efﬁcient and adequate dialysis, regular anticoagulation throughout
the duration of each dialysis session is required. Historically, this was provided by the use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and, indeed, this is still the
case in many parts of the world, including the USA. There has been a trend,
in Europe, however, to adopt the low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs)
for standard anticoagulation. A 2004 meta-analysis of the safety and efﬁcacy
of the LMWHs vs UFH concluded that there was no difference in the number of bleeding events, post-dialysis vascular access compression time, or
thrombosis of the extracorporeal circuit between the two.

Unfractionated heparin
•
•
•
•
•
•

Mixture of glycosaminoglycans between 3 and 30 kDa.
Highly negatively charged.
Indirect thrombin inhibitor.
Narrow therapeutic window and highly variable dose response.
Metabolized in the liver and by vascular endothelial heparinases.
No single dosing protocol but usually single bolus 1,000–2,000 IU,
followed by infusion of 1,000–1,500IU/h.
• Adjust if weight <50kg or >90kg.
• Monitor using activated clotting time (ACT) at the bedside.
• Short half-life and fully reversible with protamine.

Low molecular weight heparin
• Smaller molecules, typically 4–5kDa.
• Different preparations have variable lengths, weights, and charges
(enoxaparin least ‘heparin-like’, tinzaparin most).
• Primarily work through inhibiting factor Xa.
• Predominantly renally clearly ∴i half-life in ESRD.
• Tinzaparin, commonly used at doses of 2,500IU or 3,500IU, is
considered safe and effective. Enoxaparin (e.g. 10–40mg) is used in
many centres.
• Monitor using anti-Xa activity, aiming <0.4IU/mL (historically slow
turnaround in results, but now usually available in 90–120mins.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) see p. 184
This is a signiﬁcant complication of heparin use (both UFH and LMWH),
associated with major morbidity and mortality. Platelet activation and
aggregation results in thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and infarction.
There are wide-ranging reports as to the prevalence of HIT antibodies
in dialysis patients, with ﬁgures varying between 0 and 18%.

ANTICOAGULATION

Other
Other options for anticoagulation include regional anticoagulation (UFH/
protamine, citrate, epoprostenol), heparin-coated dialyser, heparinoids
(danaparoid or dermatan sulfate), or direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban or hirudin). Some of these may be useful in those patients who
develop HIT or those with a high bleeding risk.

Bleeding
2 Patients with ESRD have an increased incidence rate of major bleeding. This has been quoted as 2.5% per person-year for patients on haemodialysis. A recent study suggested that this increased to 3.1% with
warfarin use, 4.4% with aspirin, and 6.3% with warfarin and aspirin.
 Caution when prescribing these agents in patients on haemodialysis.

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Dialysis access: AVF/PTFE
Reliable vascular access is the cornerstone of HD therapy, and timely planning of access creation is a major facet of CKD care (see Fig. 4.6). 725%
of all admissions in the dialysis population relate to access failure or other
complication and remain an important source of morbidity and mortality.

AV ﬁstula
The optimal form of vascular access. Requires surgical anastomosis of an
artery and a vein (under LA or GA), either at the wrist (radiocephalic) or
elbow (brachiocephalic, brachiobasilic). If the suitability of veins is in doubt,
then vascular mapping with USS is desirable. Maturation for 6–8 weeks
(minimum) is required prior to needling (6 advance planning crucial).

PTFE graft
Second best. A synthetic graft is interposed between an artery and a vein.
A larger operation than AVF creation. Necessary if veins inadequate to
fashion an AVF (e.g. DM, previous phlebotomy/cannulation). Lower limb
sites possible (e.g. femoral loop), in addition to upper limb. Useable within
days, but thrombosis and infection (usually necessitating removal) are
problematic. Half-life shorter than an AVF.

DIALYSIS ACCESS: AVF/PTFE

Planning
UK Renal Association guidelines suggest that 85% of prevalent haemodialysis patients should be dialysing through either a native arteriovenous ﬁstula or a PTFE graft. At the start of their dialysis career, all patients should
have a lifelong vascular access strategy; i.e. a planned approach to vascular
access that preserves potential sites for as long as possible. Many centres
have a multidisciplinary vascular access team for this purpose.
Clinical examination and vessel mapping (duplex Doppler) help to plan
the site of ﬁstula formation. A native ﬁstula takes at least 6–8 weeks to
mature. A PTFE graft can often be used within 2 weeks. Primary failure
rates for AV ﬁstulae (unusable at 3 months) remain high (up to 50% in
some centres). In addition to technical factors, or poor AVF care, this may
be caused by a vascular stenosis, either at the AV anastomosis or in the
downstream vein. These may be amenable to angioplasty. Grafts have a
lower primary failure rate, but are more likely to develop late stenoses—
either at the venous anastomosis or in the outﬂow vein.

Fistula care: what every doctor and patient should know
• Dialysis access is extremely precious.
• Arm veins should be preserved in pre-dialysis patients (no IV
cannulae between elbow and wrist).
• Needling should only be carried out by a trained operator (usually a
dialysis nurse, ideally the patient).
• Technique: avoid using the same site repetitively (l false aneurysm
formation).
• Never put a tourniquet or BP cuff on a ﬁstula arm.
• Do not use a ﬁstula to take blood.
• Hypotension (and volume depletion) li thrombosis risk.
• i Hct (too much ESA) predisposes to thrombosis. Keep within
recommended guidelines and at the lower end of these, if at risk.
• A clotted ﬁstula or graft requires immediate attention (time to
declotting is a major determinant of success).

Surveillance
Alongside clinical monitoring of signs that may indicate stenosis (difﬁcult cannulation, prolonged bleeding post-needle removal), KDOQI have published
guidelines for regular access screening. The rationale is that regular surveillance of vascular access should identify a stenosis and allow pre-emptive
intervention to prevent thrombosis. The recommendations are that a referral for intervention should be triggered when blood ﬂow <600mL/min in a
PTFE or <400–500mL/min in an AVF. While these guidelines are controversial (as they may potentially lead to a high number of unnecessary interventions), they can be helpful when correlated with clinical ﬁndings such as
access venous pressures and post dialysis bleeding times.
If a stenosis is suspected, investigate further by duplex or angiography
(‘ﬁstulogram’). The advantage of angiography is the potential ability to proceed immediately to an angioplasty (‘ﬁstuloplasty’).

293

294

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Clotted AVF/PTFE
No thrill or buzz in ﬁstula = thrombosis (ensure patients are aware of this)
∴ seek immediate medical opinion. Swift intervention (within 48h) either
via interventional radiology (local thrombolysis), or surgery, may be able
to salvage the ﬁstula. The longer the time to intervention, the less likely
it is to be successful. There is no clear evidence for anticoagulation in the
interim. Check U+E and volume status, and insert a temporary dialysis
line, if required.

Other complications of ﬁstulae and grafts
• Infection: ﬁstulae rarely become infected beyond a superﬁcial
cellulitis. PTFE infection is not uncommon. May be occult, causing
weight loss, ESA resistance, and failure to thrive. Antimicrobials
rarely successful, and management usually involves surgical removal.
• Aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm formation: may occur at needling
sites, especially if sites not rotated. Surgery may be necessary.
• Bleeding from an infected or aneurysmal AVF or graft is a much
feared complication (proceeds under arterial pressure!).
• 2 Wear a gown, gloves, and goggles. Seal the bleeding site with
the lid of a universal container, and secure with a tight bandage.
Establish wide-bore IV access; check clotting; cross-match blood,
and inform a surgeon.
• Distal ischaemia or steal syndrome: ﬂow through the ﬁstula or graft
may compromise distal blood supply. Cold or numb peripheries are
common but may l infarction or ischaemic pain. Other features
include paraesthesia, cyanosis, loss of distal pulses. Patients often
elect to wear a glove on the affected hand. AVF ligation or graft
removal may be necessary in severe cases.
• Excess ﬂow: may l large i in cardiac output with cardiac
decompensation. Surgical ‘banding’ (plication) of an AVF can d ﬂow.
• Extravasation: blood leakage into the soft tissues. Can cause rapid
limb swelling, haemodynamic compromise, compartment syndromes,
s infection, access thrombosis.

DIALYSIS ACCESS: AVF/PTFE

The golden rules of vascular access formation
- Assess the patient for vascular access when dialysis is expected
within 12 months.
- Make sure the patient resists venepuncture in the selected limb.
- Use upper limbs before lower limbs.
- Non-dominant arm before dominant.
- Use distal sites (e.g. radiocephalic) before proximal (e.g.
brachiocephalic) whenever possible. See Fig. 4.7.
- Use a native vein before prosthetic graft.
- Aim for formation >6 months prior to dialysis. This will give
adequate time for maturation (and for repeat intervention in cases of
primary non-function).
- Ensure all access procedures and interventions (successful or
unsuccessful) are adequately documented.
- Plan ahead—what next? Is peritoneal dialysis an option?

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Haemodialysis access: lines
If a patient has neither an AVF nor a PTFE, the remaining options are:

Temporary dialysis catheter (b p. 180)
For immediate use; e.g. AKI, or in a patient with unresolved sepsis. Internal
jugular, subclavian and femoral are possible routes. Ideally leave in situ for
≤2 weeks (femoral <5 days). These have much higher infection rates than
other forms of dialysis access.

Tunnelled (and cuffed) dialysis catheter
A dual-lumen (or two single-lumen) venous catheter is placed in a central
vein (internal jugular or subclavian; femoral less common). Available for
immediate use and usually left in situ for 1–3 months (occasionally longer).
Blood ﬂows 300–450mL/min achievable.
The use of tunnelled central venous haemodialysis catheters (CVC) is
common. They are frequently used as a ‘bridging’ step in those who are
waiting for a ﬁstula or in those in whom access surgery has been unsuccessful. They should generally be viewed as a short-term solution, as they
are associated with a 3-fold increased mortality, compared with AVFs. In
addition, sepsis-related death is 100-fold greater in HD patients than the
general population, and infection-related death and all-cause mortality is
highest in those dialysing through a CVC.

Malfunction
Catheter malfunction is common. 50% of lines fail within the ﬁrst year of
insertion. Catheter malfunction is deﬁned as one of the following:
• Peak blood ﬂow ≤200mL/min for 30min in an HD session.
• Mean blood ﬂow ≤200mL/min for two consecutive HD sessions.
• No ﬂow, unable to initiate HD.
Malfunction may be positional (usually ≤7 days post-insertion) or mechanical. Mechanical malfunction may be intraluminal (thrombosis), extraluminal (ﬁbrin sheath), or intrinsic to the catheter material/properties.
Fibrin sheaths will start to form within 24 hours of insertion and may
eventually completely enclose the catheter. Can cause a one-way valve,
manifesting in difﬁcult aspiration despite easy injection.
Primary prevention
Strategies include heparin, rtPA, or trisodium citrate catheter lumen
lock between sessions. The PreCLOT trial showed that rtPA for primary prevention of catheter malfunction (1mg/lumen once/week + heparin for the other two sessions) vs standard heparin (5,000U/mL to ﬁll
lumen) was associated with signiﬁcantly less catheter malfunction and
bacteraemia, with no increase in bleeding events. Trisodium citrate (4,
30, or 46.7%) has also been shown to be more effective than heparin and
causes less bleeding, less bioﬁlm formation, and a signiﬁcant reduction in
catheter-related bacteraemia. There are no convincing data for low-dose
warfarin, ticlopidine, or other antiplatelet agents with respect to primary
prevention.

HAEMODIALYSIS ACCESS: LINES

Treatment
• Initial attempts to restore ﬂow: ﬂush catheter with 10mL syringe of
saline; reposition patient; reverse lines. Beware recirculation (repetitive
dialysis of the same small volume of blood) and inadequate dialysis.
• Thrombolytic agents: streptokinase/urokinase have largely been replaced
by rtPA (alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase). Differing regimens have been
studied: ‘push’, short dwell (30–60min), long dwell (>2 hours, interdialytic),
or infusions. These methods are associated with short-term success of
between 40 and 90%, with median patency 14–30 days.
• Fibrin sheath disruption: mechanical disruption of sheath from catheter
wall. Published outcomes variable, presumably related to catheter type
and operator technique.
• Exchange over guidewire: if previously listed measures unsuccessful,
then consider a catheter exchange. Comparable infection rates to de
novo insertion and preserves vascular access, particularly if a central
venous stenosis has developed. Caution—do not use this technique
when replacing fractured or ‘split’ lines due to risk of bacteraemia.

Catheter-related bacteraemia
Catheter-related bacteraemia (CRB) is a serious complication of CVC
use. Catheters are associated with a 10-fold increase in bacteraemia rates
vs AVF. Incidence of CRB used to range from 2.5 to 6.5 episodes/1,000
catheter days for tunnelled lines and higher for temporary uncuffed lines.
Since the advent of antimicrobial catheter locks, most units aim for <1
bacteraemia/1,000 patient days at risk.
• Fever in an HD patient with a line = line sepsis until proven otherwise.
• Causes: 770% l Staph. aureus ( MRSA) or Staph. epidermidis. Gram
–ve organisms more common with femoral catheters.
• Risk factors: poor patient hygiene, previous CRB, recent hospitalization,
d albumin, duration of catheter use, Staphylococcus nasal carriage or
skin colonisation, DM, immunocompromised.
Clinical features
• Usually presents with fever, rigors 9d BP whilst on dialysis. Also N+V,
diarrhoea, confusion.
• Examination and investigation:
• The line: often appears innocent, but check for erythematous or
purulent exit site (l swab for C+S). Is there a tunnel infection?
• General exam: stigmata of endocarditis, chest signs, other sources
of infection; e.g. spinal tenderness (?discitis).
• Blood cultures: from line and peripheral vein (see Table 4.1).
• CRP.
• CXR if chest signs.

Treatment
• Start antibiotics empirically if fever >38*C, rigors, or d BP.
• Cover for both Gram +ve and Gram-ve organisms.
• For Gram +ve cover use either vancomycin (10–20mg/kg
IV—usually 1g) or teicoplanin (see b p. 882).
• For Gram –ve cover use either gentamicin (see b pp. 881–2) or
third-generation Cephalosporin.
• Tailor therapy to culture results.
• Vancomycin is not removed by HD; gentamicin is.
Measure gent levels daily (levels will decrease sooner in patients
with signiﬁcant residual function).
Continue 4 weeks for Staphylococcus (6–8 weeks if complicated
by metastatic infection), Minimum 2 weeks if Gram –ve or Candida.
• If fever still present after 12–24h l remove line, earlier if severe sepsis
or deteriorating patient.
• Remove in all cases of Staph. aureus, tunnel infection, or if infection
seeded elsewhere.
Patients with CRB are at risk of developing osteomyelitis, discitis, epidural
abscess, septic arthritis, or endocarditis, regardless of whether the CVC is
removed or exchanged—consider if ongoing fever or CRP.
Prevention
• Consider IV antibiotics at insertion for patients with Staphylococcal
skin colonisation. Sterile placement technique (b p. 936).
• Meticulous nursing care (KDOQI guidelines: mask and sterile gloves;
clean exit site with chlorhexidine each use).
• Eradication of Staphylococcus carriage may d incidence (e.g. nasal
mupirocin cream).
• Topical antimicrobial ointment: d CRB by 75–93% (e.g. mupirocin).

HAEMODIALYSIS ACCESS: LINES

• Antimicrobial locks: the cornerstone of preventing catheter-related
bacteraemia (d by 51–99% over 25 trials) though microbial resistance
and long term efﬁcacy are concerns.
• The application of chlorhexidine-impregnated foam dressings to
catheter exit sites has become popular in many units.

Long-term complications
• Catheters may l central venous stenosis, preventing subsequent
catheter placement and compromising AVF maturation and ﬂow.
May lead to SVC obstruction, with swollen arms, chest wall, and face.
Multiple collateral veins may be visible. Balloon angioplasty 9 stent
insertion may be successful but recurrence common.

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Fluid balance on dialysis
Fluids gains between dialysis depend on:
• Fluid intake during the interdialytic interval ( the long interdialytic
interval, or the 3-day break that occurs once a week on a standard thrice
weekly dialysis regime, is usually associated with the largest ﬂuid gains).
• Residual renal function or urine output.
• Other ﬂuid losses (stoma output, stool losses, etc.).
As a general rule, HD patients should gain no more than 2% of their body
weight in ﬂuid between sessions (1.4kg in a 70kg adult). Gains of >4% (2.8kg
in a 70kg adult) are described as large interdialytic weight gains. But, as most
HD patients will conﬁrm, this is easier said than done. Patients require
encouragement and regular tailored advice regarding ﬂuid (and salt) intake.

Dry weight (DW)
• It is the end-dialysis weight thought to best represent a euvolaemic
state. It is the body weight in kg against which the ultraﬁltration
volume is set at each session. For example:
• HD patient with a dry weight of 70kg.
• Pre-dialysis weight 72.7kg.
• Target UF volume = 2,700mL over 4h to achieve DW.

Assessing DW
Can be achieved in a number of ways but should always include clinical
assessment. The point at which a patient experiences intradialytic hypotension (or unpleasant cramp) (b p. 302) is a crude (and not always
correct) indication that further ﬂuid removal will not be advantageous:
• Examination: to include presence or absence of ankle oedema, lying
and standing BP, JVP, and examination of the chest. Hypertension,
oedema, and an elevated JVP suggest overload.
• Fluid gains between dialysis sessions.
• Continuous blood volume monitoring (BVM, on-line measurement of
the haematocrit on HD where sudden haemoconcentration suggests
vascular reﬁll is failing and dry weight has been reached).
• Biofeedback control, a combination of BVM, conductivity, BP, and UF
rate, analysed in real time to predict impending hypotension.
• Bioimpedance where resistance to alternating current is used to
determine lean body mass and body ﬂuid volume.
• IVC:aorta ratio on ultrasound (predominantly a research tool).
 Of these, only the ﬁrst two have entered routine practice—trials of
the other techniques have either been inadequate or results have been
inconsistent. A widely applicable, and clinically useful, tool that accurately
assesses ﬂuid status is awaited.

FLUID BALANCE ON DIALYSIS

Sodium and dialysis
Any individual has a (remarkably stable) ‘sodium set-point’: if their
plasma Na+ rises above their set-point, osmoreceptors trigger thirst
until Na+ returns to this point. The reverse is also true: if plasma Na+
falls with total body Na+ depletion, salt craving increases Na+ ingestion
to regain the ‘set-point Na+’. So it follows that:
•  Dietary salt intake is a vital part of haemodialysis patients’ salt
balance!
• Achieving <100mmol/day intake (equivalent to 6g NaCl) is difﬁcult
on a western diet. The more salt ingested, the more water will be
drunk, and the more ﬂuid weight gained between sessions.
• During dialysis, ultraﬁltration (convection) removes Na+, as does
diffusion down a plasma/dialysate gradient. This gradient is not
as simple as a patient’s measured serum Na+, compared to the
prescribed dialysate Na+:
+
• Plasma Na is reported in mmol/L, but only 93% of plasma is
free water (so the true Na+ in that fraction of dialysable water is
higher).
+
• Negatively charged plasma proteins ‘resist’ movement of Na
from plasma into dialysate (Gibbs–Donnan effect), affecting true
diffusion.

As long as dietary salt intake is controlled to
<100mmol/day
• Lowering the dialysate Na+ will lead to a negative Na+ balance
over time.
• BUT may be associated with more intradialytic haemodynamic
instability over the short term.
• Higher dialysate Na+l increased ﬂuid intake and larger interdialytic
weight gains over time.
• BUT may be associated with better haemodynamic control
during any one session (allows for better capillary reﬁlling during
ultraﬁltration).

301

302

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Intradialytic hypotension
A sudden and symptomatic fall in BP during a dialysis session is called
intradialytic hypotension (IDH). During ultraﬁltration, ﬂuid is removed
from the vascular space. This requires prompt reﬁlling from the ECF to
maintain blood volume. Healthy adults will tolerate up to 25% reduction
in blood volume, but, amongst patients on dialysis, there is large inter- and
intrapatient variability.
IDH is deﬁned as a fall in SBP >20mmHg (or MAP >10), associated with
symptoms, or a fall to SBP <100mmHg. Symptoms associated with IDH
include:
• Cramps, abdominal pain, or nausea (reduced gut perfusion).
• Yawning, sighing, anxiety, or dizziness (reduced cerebral perfusion).
• Chest pain or arrhythmias.
IDH occurs in around 10% of all HD patients and in around 5–30% of these
patients’ sessions. IDH is always related to the rate of ultraﬁltration (i.e.
the speed of ﬂuid removal). It is less usual at UF rate <0.3mL/min/kg and
common if UF rate >0.6mL/min/kg. IDH is more likely in:
• Elderly (esp. if with wide pulse pressure and isolated systolic
hypertension).
• ♀.
• Diabetic patients (2 with autonomic neuropathy).
• Cardiomyopathies.
• Occult sepsis.

Immediate management of IDH:
•
•
•
•
•

Stop ultraﬁltration (UF).
Place patient in Trendelenburg position.
Administer 0.9% NaCl as a 250mL bolus.
Recheck BP.
Undertake thorough clinical review (including medications) to prevent
future episodes!

INTRADIALYTIC HYPOTENSION

Management: preventing IDH
• Maintain residual renal function where possible.
• Conﬁrm cardiac function (ECG, echo) and exclude valvular heart disease.
• Give good dietary salt and ﬂuid intake advice. Patients who do
not understand the importance of salt restriction on HD will ﬁnd
controlling thirst and ﬂuid very difﬁcult.
• Avoid eating during HD.
• Stop dialysis-day antihypertensives (but try to continue B-blockers if
prescribed).
• Control blood sugars in diabetic patients.
• Correct anaemia, if present, and arrange nutritional input for those
who are malnourished.
• Increase dialysis hours or increase number of weekly sessions (i.e.
reduce the UF rate or the UF volume per session).

Cooling the dialysate
Dialysis is often a ‘warming’ event—if the dialysate temperature were
set at 37*, the metabolic consequences of the process and of pyrogens
and cytokines released through blood–membrane interaction would l
a gain in energy.
Warming l peripheral vasodilatation—BP will then only be maintained if heart rate or stroke volume increases (or both).
Patients on dialysis often have a multifactorial uraemic cardiomyopathy—during dialysis, ischaemic regional wall motion abnormalities
(RWMAs) are visible on echocardiography in a signiﬁcant subgroup of
patients prone to IDH (as O2 delivery fails to meet cardiac work).
Reducing the dialysate temperature to 36* or even 35.5*l cooler returned
blood during any session, with vasoconstriction, then sustaining or raising
blood pressure without tachycardia or increased myocardial contractility.
2 Cooled dialysate reduces IDH and prevents RWMAs.

Sodium proﬁling
Sodium ‘ramping’, or ‘proﬁling’, has not become widely adopted to control
IDH—although a higher dialysate Na+ during the ﬁrst hour of dialysis,
which then falls on an hour-by-hour (or shorter) basis, should improve
haemodynamic stability. The total Na+ load tends to be higher than with
ﬁxed concentration (standard) dialysate Na+. So a higher load then drives
intradialytic thirst and ﬂuid gains, setting up a cycle of large intradialytic
weight gains requiring ever higher ultraﬁltration volumes and more
frequent IDH.

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Extended hours HD treatments
Background
Dialysis frequency and duration
- For >3 decades in Tassin, France, patients with ESRD have received
8h in-centre dialysis sessions 3x/wk. Patient outcome data with this
regime are amongst the best in the world.
- This improved survival (compared to shorter dialysis schedules) is
mainly due to lower CV mortality. Other reported beneﬁts include
improved nutritional status, better anaemia parameters (with lower
ESA requirement) and superior BP control.
- In addition, the 2-day interval between conventional HD sessions is
well recognised as a time of heightened risk for CV events.
- In view of these observations, it has been proposed that modern
dialysis care should focus on: - i dialysis frequency
- i dialysis duration
- Or both of these.
- Strategies to increase the intensity of dialysis include short daily
haemodialysis (SDHD), in-hospital nocturnal haemodialysis (INHD)
and nocturnal home haemodialysis (NHHD).
SDHD
- 6-7 days/week, 1.5–3 hours/session
- Beneﬁts: improved BP control, dLV mass, variable reports on quality
of life, anaemia, dPO4, dmortality.
INHD
- 3 nights/week, 8 hours/session
- dMortality, dhospitalisation, dESA requirements, dIDH, dPO4
NHHD
- 5–6 nights/week, 6–8 hours/session
- Improved BP control, dESA requirements, dLV mass, No current RCT
data on mortality.

Frequent Haemodialysis Network (FHN)
- The FHN, formed in 2005, is responsible for the two most recent
RCTs that have examined daily and nocturnal dialysis.
- The trials (short daily haemodialysis (SDHD) v conventional HD
(2010) and nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) v conventional HD (2011)),
were designed to test the hypothesis that signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to
HD treatment time and/or frequency would have a signiﬁcant impact
on patient outcomes.
- Outcome measures included mortality, change in LV mass, and change
in self-reported physical functioning.
- Unfortunately neither of the studies was powered sufﬁciently to examine
the effects of either mortality or risk of hospitalisation. However, they
did demonstrate that frequent or long duration dialysis schedules could
improve certain clinical parameters and quality of life scores.
- Beneﬁts of increased hours dialysing may, however, be at the expense
of vascular access longevity in some patients.

EXTENDED HOURS HD TREATMENTS

Survival Studies
- RCT design, particularly when studying a therapeutic intervention such
as HD, can be challenging - as has proved to be the case for the FHN.
- Recruitment of signiﬁcant numbers of dialysis patients to RCTs is often
difﬁcult. It took 10 years and millions of dollars to recruit 245 patients
to the SDHD v conventional HD FHN study (2010).
- However, there are large cohorts of patients undergoing various
dialysis schedules and these can provide highly informative data. Table
4.2 summarizes some of the recent survival studies (USA and Canada
based) with respect to different extended hours modalities.

Home haemodialysis
- Extended hours treatments are associated with certain barriers
(both perceived and actual) for patients and these should be
balanced against potential beneﬁts. Some barriers may be overcome
through the greater ﬂexibility of a home-based therapy.
- Improving the patient’s understanding of the beneﬁts of intensive
treatment is fundamental to successful implementation.
- Meticulous attention to care of vascular access is essential for
longevity and reduced infection/hospitalization.

Dialysis

Other HD complications
Acute complications
Cramps
- Very common—usually towards the end of treatment.
- Associated with d BP, dNa+, hypovolaemia and hypoxia.
- More common with high UF volumes.
- Management: minimize interdialytic weight gains, reduce intradialytic
hypotension, increase dialysate sodium (or sodium proﬁle b p 303).
- Acutely, IV saline or 50% glucose is usually effective. Massage the
affected area. Regular quinine sulfate can be helpful for some. Carnitine
deﬁciency is present in some intractable cases and supplementation
can be given (usually IV post dialysis).
Nausea and vomiting
- Often associated with dBP.
- Management: administer an anti-emetic. Observe patient through
treatment and reassess at completion.
Headache
- May be s to dBP, iBP, disequilibrium syndrome or large ﬂuid shifts
during dialysis.
- Management: analgesia. Reassure. Review ultraﬁltration volumes.
Investigate if persistent.
Fever
- Often s to dialysis access infection, particularly CVCs (b XXX).
- Patient often rigors prior to temperature rise.
- Management: 2 the patient requires a detailed clinical review.
Reassure, paracetamol, blood cultures, antibiotics according to local
policy.
Haemolysis
- Rare, but potentially serious.
- Causes: overheating of dialysate, dialysate contamination, impure water
supply, and dialysis machine malfunction. Multiple patients may be
affected. Anaemia and iK+ (1 can be severe) may result.
Clotting of extracorporeal circuit (blood lines and dialyser)
- Causes: inadequate anticoagulation, low blood ﬂow rates, iHb levels
(high viscosity), intradialytic blood transfusion, or clotted access.
- Warning signs: high (or increasing) venous pressure, the blood circuit
darkens, i TMP.
- Action: disconnect the patient from the dialysis circuit and ﬂush their
dialysis access with saline. Discard the old circuit and prime a new one.
Recommence dialysis. Check FBC.
- Next session: titrate anticoagulation carefully. If anticoagulation is
contraindicated, ﬂush the dialysis circuit at hourly intervals with
50-100mL of 0.9% sodium chloride (as permitted by the patient’s
volume status).

OTHER HD COMPLICATIONS

Chest pain
2 Assume cardiac in origin until proven otherwise. Reduce blood ﬂow
rate to 200mL/min and stop UF. Check observations, perform ECG and
commence cardiac monitoring. Administer GTN if prescribed.
Cardiac arrest in the dialysis unit
- Manage as for any non-dialysis cardiac arrest.
- Consider iK+ and other electrolyte imbalances early.
- Ask dialysis staff to wash back and discontinue dialysis.
- Consider the impact of witnessing an arrest on nearby patients.
Disequilibrium (see also b p. 177)
- Cause: high blood urea levels being reduced too rapidly. Usually
occurs during ﬁrst dialysis session (with high blood ﬂows).
- Prevention: use a dialyser with small surface area, commence blood
ﬂow rate at 150-200mL/min. Limit ﬁrst session to 2h.
- Clinical features: nausea and vomiting, agitation, headache, seizures,
loss of consciousness.
First use syndrome/dialyser reaction
- Cause: a reaction to the dialyser membrane or dialysis lines (s to
either sterilizing agents; e.g. ethylene oxide, bacteria, or endotoxins).
- 2 Reactions range from severe immediate anaphylaxis, through to
milder delayed reactions.
- Clinical features: pruritus, urticaria, breathlessness, cough, nausea,
vomiting, ﬂushing, rigors, 2 laryngeal oedema, collapse.
- Prevention: careful circuit priming with saline and initial low blood ﬂow
(e.g. 100mL/min).
- Management: depends on severity. Summon help. Disconnect the
patient immediately without wash back. 2 Treat severe cases as
anaphylaxis. For milder cases: O2 and other supportive measures (e.g.
antihistamines), close observation.
- Exclude other potential causes; e.g. drug reaction. Send blood cultures,
CRP and U+E. Check dialysate visually for contamination and send
sample for microbiological testing. Inform the dialysis technical staff.
Prior to next dialysis, prime the circuit with 2L saline and re-circulate
before patient connection.
Accidental disconnection
- Prevention: ensure all connectors are secured on needle, dialyser and
dialysis catheters.
- Check CVC for evidence of deterioration.
- Needles should be ﬁxed securely on the patient’s arm and lines
taped so that they cannot pull. Do not tape lines to beds or chairs.
2 Connections should be visible, do not cover with clothing or blankets.
- Action: if a needle dislodges stop the blood pump and clamp the
arterial and venous lines. Apply direct pressure to the bleeding site.
Check BP and initiate appropriate treatment for hypovolaemia as
dictated by amount of blood loss and the clinical situation.
- Discard all lines and prime a new dialyser and circuit. Re-site needles
and secure before recommencing dialysis. Check FBC.

309

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

- If a temporary or tunneled CVC becomes dislodged: stop the blood
pump and clamp arterial and venous lines. Apply a dressing to the
CVC exit site and call for assistance. 1 Never attempt to push a
dislodged CVC back into place. Discard dialysis lines. Check FBC. Send
tip of catheter for culture.
Air embolism
- Air detection systems should prevent air from anywhere in the
extracorporeal circuit being returned to the patient.
- If an embolism occurs, air may enter the cerebral venous circulation or
the heart and lungs, depending, partly, on the patient’s position.
- Clinical features: loss of consciousness, seizures, cough, chest
discomfort, breathlessness, patchy cyanosis, d BP, shock.
- Management: clamp the venous line and stop the blood pump
immediately. Do not wash back. Place the patient on their left side in
the Trendelenburg position (hopefully trapping air in the right atrium).
And administer 100% O2. Summon urgent assistance. Move the patient
as little as possible. Check ABGs, ECG, CXR.
Blood leak
- Blood leak may occur due to a breach in the dialyser membrane
(which may not be visible); e.g. excessive TMP in a dialyser with a low
UF co-efﬁcient.
- Management: the dialysis machine should alarm if this occurs. The
patient will need to continue dialysis on an alternative machine.
Hard water syndrome
- Cause: failure of the reverse osmosis (RO) machine or the watersoftening plant.
- Clinical features: nausea and vomiting, headache, i BP, ﬂushing. Several
patients may be affected simultaneously.
- Management: disconnect from dialysis immediately without wash back.
Check observations, send U+E and bone proﬁle. No further patients
should be dialysed pending a technical review of the water system.

OTHER HD COMPLICATIONS

Long-term HD complications
Cardiovascular Disease
- Dialysis patients are 720x more likely to die a CV death than the
general population. A cardiac cause is implicated in >40% of all
deaths at ESRD.
- The cause in dialysis patients is multifactorial and not limited to
classical Framingham risk factors (b p. 198).
Vascular Calciﬁcation (b p. 242)
Malnutrition (b p. 260)
- Causes: inadequate dialysis dose (lkanorexia, altered taste and
reduced enjoyment of food), inﬂammation, dietary restrictions,
nutrients lost via dialysate (~4-8g amino acids lost per session),
relative catabolic state, medications (e.g. unpalatable PO4 binders),
impaired absorption of nutrients, gastroparesis.
- Management: early dietetic support, nutritional supplements,
parenteral nutrition (intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) is
available, is convenient and does not require additional IV access—
but it may not provide sufﬁcient protein and calories to meet the
needs of the patient), reduce inﬂammation (l treat infection, use
biocompatible HD membranes, review water endotoxin levels),
Aluminium toxicity (b p. 247)
Dialysis related amyloidosis (DRA) (b p. 632).

Withdrawal of HD (see also b p 270)
This is the second most common cause of death in RRT (15%). Several
factors may contribute to a patient and/or their physician considering
withdrawal, including advancing age, frailty, presence of multiple deteriorating co-morbidities, malignancy, chronic pain, reduced mobility,
dementia, difﬁculties with vascular access, repeated hospital admissions,
problems during dialysis itself (e.g. recurrent hypotension) and poor
overall quality of life.
If considering withdrawal it is important to consider the following:
- Reversible factors (including depression).
- Assessment of patient’s decision-making capacity.
- Identiﬁcation of any advanced directives.
- Full family or care involvement.
- Involvement of the patient’s general practitioner and local palliative
services.
- 2 Post withdrawal supportive care
Post withdrawal, patients typically survive 1-2 weeks, depending on
residual renal function. Palliative support (at home, if possible, depending on the patient’s wishes) should include: relaxation of dietary restrictions, continued ﬂuid restriction to avoid distressing pulmonary oedema,
appropriate analgesia (see p. 271), management of anxiety and dyspnoea
(b p. 268).
Advanced directives should be encouraged in dialysis patients.

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)
Introduction
PD is the dialysis modality of 11% of patients worldwide (7250,000
patients). The proportion varies dramatically, however, with <5% in Japan
and >60% in Mexico. It is generally accepted that patient survival on PD
is similar, compared to HD; in fact, these modalities should be seen as
complementary, offering different beneﬁts for individuals at different times
in their dialysis history—the so-called ‘integrated dialysis care’ approach.

Advantages of PD
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Preservation of residual renal function.
No need for vascular access.
Mobility (e.g. easy to transport dialysis to holiday destinations).
Patient engagement in treatment.
Home-based therapy—maintains patient independence.
Less expensive than HD.
Less risk of transmission of blood-borne viruses.

Physiology and concepts
The semi-permeable dialysis membrane of the peritoneum comprises the
capillary endothelium, supporting matrix, and peritoneal mesothelium.
Fluid and solutes move between the ﬂuid-ﬁlled peritoneum and blood via,
what is termed, the ‘three-pore model’ of PD.
• Large pores (20–40nm): allow macromolecules, such as proteins, to be
ﬁltered between compartments (effectively via venular or lymphatic
absorption).
• Small pores (4–6nm): responsible for the transport of small solutes,
such as sodium, potassium, urea, and creatinine.
• Ultrasmall pores (<0.8nm): transport water alone (shown to be
aquaporin 1).
It is possible that the small and large pores represent different functional
states of a single entity, depending on the density of the glycocalyx.
The net movement of solutes, such as urea, will depend on:
• Net diffusion through small pores and convection through large pores.
• Total volume of dialysate infused.
• Net ﬂuid ultraﬁltration (or, under certain circumstances, absorption).
Effective peritoneal surface area
Peritoneal capillary endothelium is the predominant barrier to peritoneal
solute transport. However, at any one time, not all capillaries are equally
perfused, and not all are close enough to the mesothelium (and thus
dialysate) for effective dialysis. The ‘effective peritoneal surface area’ then
varies (e.g. with peritonitis or changing dialysate volumes). Increasing the
effective peritoneal surface area allows faster rates of small solute transfer
but not necessarily better overall dialysis—by increasing dissipation of glucose, ultraﬁltration might actually decrease (b p. 318).

PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (PD)

Ultraﬁltration (UF)
The net movement of water (UF) relies on the presence of a high intraperitoneal osmotic gradient (generated by glucose) or oncotic gradient
(generated by glucose polymers, such as icodextrin). Any absorption of
dialysate via the lymphatics (esp. if i intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure from patient posture or high instilled PD volumes) will oppose this
ﬂuid movement into the peritoneum.
The osmotic gradient is usually generated by glucose and depends on:
• The glucose concentration of the dialysate.
• A patient’s blood glucose.
• The rate of absorption of glucose itself from PD ﬂuid.
UF is optimized by:
• Ensuring normoglycaemia (relevant for diabetic patients).
• Adjusting the tonicity of the PD solution (glucose concentration).
• Altering the duration of each dialysis dwell.
• Adjusting dwell volumes; i volume often (but not always) leads to i
UF (see next paragraphs).
As an alternative to glucose-based solutions, glucose polymers (such
as icodextrin) are poorly absorbed and slowly metabolized—these PD
solutions provide a sustained oncotic gradient over longer dwells and
permit i UF, particularly for patients designated as high transporters
(b p. 316).
i dwell volumes of dialysate may maintain the glucose gradient for
longer, but i intraperitoneal pressure may i lymphatic return. Also, i
volume might increase effective peritoneal surface area, with more rapid
absorption of glucose, lessening the glucose gradient and reducing UF.

Contraindications to PD
Absolute
• Patient or carer unable to train adequately in the technique.
• Inguinal, umbilical, or diaphragmatic hernias (esp.
pleuroperitoneal leak).
• Ileostomy or colostomy.
• Abdominal wall infections or intra-abdominal sepsis, e.g. active
diverticular disease.
Relative
• Abdominal surgeries (adhesions). The more extensive the surgery, the
more likely PD will be unsuccessful.
• Morbid obesity (inadequate clearance).
• Huge polycystic kidneys (insufﬁcient intraperitoneal space).
• Severe gastroparesis (worsening vomiting).
• Severe lung disease (diaphragmatic splinting).

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Types of PD
Introduction
Intermittent PD was originally developed for the treatment of AKI in situations where HD facilities are not available (b p. 188). Rapid exchanges
over a 24-hour period are repeated twice or more times a week. The
peritoneal catheters used for treatment of AKI are often different from
those used for patients with ESRD (although standard cuffed tubes can be
used). See Fig. 4.8 for types of PD.

PD regimens for ESRD
Continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD)
Consists of 3–5 exchanges, with dwell times of 4–10 hours over 24 hours.
Usually performed by the patient connecting and disconnecting the PD
catheter to dialysate bags. A night-time exchange can be performed with
a machine (such as Quantum®). Advantages of CAPD include simplicity,
ease of training, and ﬂexibility—the timing of exchanges can be adjusted
to times of convenience for patients (although dwells <3 hours are generally discouraged).
Automated PD (APD)
Uses an automated machine to perform exchanges at night whilst the
patient is asleep. The machine is usually programmed to perform at least
four exchanges over 8 hours (can be more, depending on individual
tolerance).
At the end of the overnight exchanges, the machine can be programmed
to leave the patient ‘dry’ for the daytime (sometimes termed night-time
intermittent peritoneal dialysis, NIPD). Alternatively, the machine can perform a ‘last ﬁll’, leaving PD ﬂuid in the peritoneum. Patients may then
perform a further exchange during the day (either manually or using the
APD machine (sometimes termed continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis
or CCPD).
Tidal APD
Has the machine programmed to only partially drain out PD ﬂuid at the
end of any dwell during the nightly cycles (‘75% tidal’ indicates that the
machine will stop draining ﬂuid out when 75% of the expected drain has
been extracted). Although efﬁciency of dialysis is reduced, it is useful for
patients whose sleep is disturbed through the discomfort experienced
when ‘dry’ or near dry.
Assisted APD
Poor strength, limited dexterity, decreased vision, or cognitive impairment may mean that some patients are unable to perform PD themselves,
although they may potentially beneﬁt from a home-based therapy. In this
circumstance, a family member or trained health care assistant can assist
with lifting of the bags of dialysis ﬂuid and the connection/disconnection
of APD.

CAPD technique
Disconnect, ﬂush-before-ﬁll Y-systems are now the norm. The ‘connectology’
has been reﬁned over the years to minimize peritonitis risk through touch
contamination. At the time of an exchange, the patient connects a Y-shaped
set with a sterile drain bag and a fresh dialysate bag. Patients are taught to
make this connection using a sterile technique, although various assist devices
are available to aid patients with dexterity or visual problems (e.g. UV Flash
Compact®). After the waste dialysate is drained into the empty bag, the
Y-connector is ﬂushed (theoretically, ﬂushing away any contaminating bacteria in this portion of the giving set), using a small volume of fresh dialysate.
The remaining dialysate is infused into the patient’s abdomen. (See Fig. 4.9)

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

PD ﬂuids
Introduction
Peritoneal dialysate needs to remove uraemic toxins, normalize electrolytes, correct acidosis, and remove ﬂuid. Ideally, ﬂuid should be compatible with long-term peritoneal health.
• Volume: usually 2L but 1.5, 2.5, or 3L also available.
• Glucose concentration: three standard concentrations, usually about 1.5,
2.5, and 4.0% (roughly 25g, 50g, and 75g glucose per bag).
• Sodium: Na+ 135mmol/L (although lower concentrations may improve
salt, and thus water, removal).
• Electrolytes: Ca2+ ranges from 1.25 to 1.75mmol/L (and 0.25mmol/L of
magnesium).
• Buffer: bicarbonate is not compatible for storage with calcium and
magnesium in PD bags, so lactate (which is rapidly converted to
bicarbonate in the liver) is widely used instead, at 35–40mmol/L.
• Newer solutions may contain:
• Bicarbonate alone or in combination with lactate as buffer (using
bags mixed immediately pre-infusion).
• Icodextrin (for an oncotic gradient), rather than glucose (as an
osmotic gradient), to achieve UF.
• Amino acids as nutritional supplement.  May cause systemic
acidosis.

Biocompatible solutions
PD ﬂuid is sterilized through heat treatment. During this process, at
the pH of lactate-based glucose solutions, glucose degradation products
(GDP) and advanced glycation end-products (AGE) are formed. These
are believed to damage the peritoneal membrane: AGE exposure correlates with ﬁbrotic change. Thus, more ‘biocompatible’ solutions have
been developed in an attempt to ameliorate this.
One such solution depends on a twin-bag system; heat sterilization
of the compartment containing glucose (at very low pH) generates very
low levels of GDP and AGE. The second compartment contains the
acid buffer, e.g. predominantly bicarbonate in the case of Physioneal® or
lactate in the case of Balance®.
Retrospective analysis of registry data suggested patient survival was
better in the group treated with biocompatible solutions, while prospective trials have shown that biocompatible ﬂuids may preserve native
urine output volumes (although not solute clearance) as well as reduce
rates of peritonitis. However, deﬁnitive evidence to support their use
(and increased cost) is lacking.
Solutions that rely on molecules, other than glucose, to provide the
osmotic gradient have no GDP or AGE. In this respect, they can be
considered biocompatible.

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Prescribing PD
Introduction
Aim for ‘adequate’ dialysis with as little impact on the patient’s social or
psychological well-being as possible. Dialysis adequacy (b p. 328) and UF
failure (b p. 332) are discussed separately. The choice of CAPD or APD
will depend on patient choice, lifestyle, and peritoneal transport status.
• ‘High’ transporters allow rapid movement of urea and other small

The concept of ‘transporter’ status
High concentrations of glucose generate an osmotic gradient across
the peritoneal membrane. During the dialysis dwell, glucose is gradually
absorbed, leading to a fall in glucose concentration and dialysate osmolality within the peritoneal cavity.
The rate of glucose dissipation correlates with the rate at which creatinine equilibrates across the peritoneal membrane and can change
over time (termed the ‘transport’ status of the patient). This can be
measured during a peritoneal equilibration test (PET, b p. 330).

molecules across the peritoneal membrane (through small pores,
b p. 330). However, they also absorb glucose rapidly, dissipating
the osmotic gradient so that net UF at the end of a dwell is likely to
be low.
This means that a high transporter often has difﬁculty achieving
adequate small solute clearance.
High transporters are particularly suitable for APD, as frequent short
dwells maximize UF and total solute removal.
‘Low’ transporters beneﬁt less from very short dwells on APD.
Introducing a ﬁfth PD exchange may be preferable (either manually or
using an automated machine to deliver an additional exchange at night,
b p. 314).
Most patients start CAPD on four ‘light’ (1.36–1.5% dextrose) PD bags.
If this fails to provide adequate UF, one exchange is changed to a
higher glucose concentration bag or icodextrin containing Extraneal®.
Further increases in glucose concentration may be necessary to
achieve adequate dialysis and UF (but see b p. 319).
With long-term PD, changes in the peritoneal membrane create a
tendency for low transporters to evolve into high transporters.

Following characterization of a patient’s membrane transport characteristics (via a PET, b p. 330), computer software can be used to predict small
solute clearance and UF. These can be particularly useful when considering the necessary changes to a PD prescription in response to a reduction
in UF or solute clearance.

PRESCRIBING PD

 Increasing the volume of a PD exchange can increase solute clearance, but the consequent rise in intraperitoneal pressure may adversely
affect UF.

Avoiding peritoneal glucose exposure
High peritoneal glucose exposure over time (often years) predicts the
development of UF failure, and causality has been suggested.
An alternative to glucose-containing dialysis solutions dialysate is icodextrin (Extraneal®).
Icodextrin is a 20-glucose polymer with potent colloidal effects (similar to albumin).
Icodextrin is particularly suited to high transporters. It acts at the
small intercellular pores and is only slowly lost from the peritoneal
cavity, meaning that the oncotic gradient is maintained. It 6 produces
gradual and sustained UF over long dwell periods (overnight dwell in
CAPD or daytime dwell in APD).
 Ensure diabetics have glucose-speciﬁc monitors, as icodextrin may
cross-react with some glucometers, showing falsely high readings (i.e.
there is a risk of undetected hypoglycaemia).

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Peritonitis
Introduction
Peritonitis is the major complication of PD, leading to signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality. Repeated episodes of peritonitis will also accelerate
peritoneal membrane failure, often necessitating a transfer of modality
to haemodialysis. The incidence of peritonitis has declined from about 3
episodes/patient/year in the 1980s to 0.6–0.7 episodes/patient/year (or 71
episode every 18 months), attributed to improved patient education and
better catheter technology. The disconnect ‘ﬂush-before-ﬁll’ system has
also been an important advance. In addition, ‘standard care’ for all PD exit
sites usually includes chlorhexidine-containing disinfectant wiping of plastic
and daily application of a topical antibiotic ointment (such as mupirocin).

Risk factors
•
•
•
•

T2DM, other signiﬁcant comorbibity.
Catheter type and implantation technique.
Connection systems.
Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus.

Clinical features
• Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
• ‘Cloudy’ PD efﬂuent is very highly suggestive.
• High fever, systemic sepsis with signs of an ileus, and peritonism may
be present.

Diagnosis
• PD ﬂuid for microscopy and Gram stain:
• Preferably after dwell time of 4h.
• >100 WBC/mm3 (>50% neutrophils).
• Microscopy and culture of PD ﬂuid (discuss with microbiology)
and blood.
• FBC (i WCC) and i CRP.
Patients should be taught to report cloudy efﬂuent immediately.
Abdominal pain can be severe. Rapid peritoneal ﬂushing can improve
symptoms, but samples from the original cloudy bag should be sent for
microbiology (and rapid ﬂushing should be avoided once IP antibiotics
have been administered).
3 Always consider other causes of peritonitis (e.g. perforation, strangulated hernia, etc.).

Bacteriology
• Gram +ve cocci:745–75% (coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus),
often introduced after touch contamination of the connections
or following catheter exit site infection. Colonization of catheter
bioﬁlms can lead to recurrence of peritonitis and necessitate catheter
exchange.

PERITONITIS

• Gram –ve organisms:715–25% (Pseudomonas, coliforms). Usually of
bowel origin. Air in the peritoneum is common and may not indicate
bowel perforation. Suspect perforation if mixed organisms on culture,
and arrange appropriate imaging and/or exploration.
• Culture negative or ‘no growth’: ideally, cultures should be positive
in >85% cases. Higher yields may be obtained by inoculating blood
culture bottles with PD ﬂuid.
• Mycobacterial infections:71%. Consider in patients with culture-negative
peritonitis not responding to empiric antibiotic therapy. Smears of PD
efﬂuent are rarely positive for acid-fast bacilli, and diagnosis is usually
made on culture (6-week) or at laparoscopy/otomy, with conﬁrmation
on peritoneal biopsy.
• Fungal:73%. Usually Candida spp. Peritonitis is infrequent but has
a poor prognosis. It often follows antibiotic therapy in at-risk (e.g.
malnourished) patients. PD catheter removal is mandatory.
Allergic peritonitis is well described and often found following prescription of icodextrin solutions (although it can occur with glucose-based
solutions). In general, the elevation of WCC is modest, and the proportion of eosinophils in PD efﬂuent may be high (>10%). Does not
respond to antibiotics. Withdrawal of icodextrin usually helps.

Complications of peritonitis
• Relapsing peritonitis. A second episode of peritonitis with the same
organism within 4 weeks of completing antibiotic therapy. Prolonged
antibiotics (particularly for relapses secondary to Staphylococcus)
are required. Recurrent peritonitis refers to a second episode of
peritonitis within 4 weeks with a different organism.
• Antibiotic treatment failure. Consider infected, encysted ﬂuid
collections and frank abscess formation if no response to protocol
antibiotic therapy (l CT abdomen and pelvis).  PD catheters will
generally require removal, and a laparotomy should be considered,
especially if there is a suggestion of other intra-abdominal pathology.
• Acute and chronic UF failure. Inﬂammation l vasodilatation li
glucose absorption, d glucose gradient, and impaired UF. Repeated
bouts of peritonitis can lead to long-term changes in the structure
and function of the peritoneal membrane, causing chronic UF failure.
• Malnutrition. Peritoneal protein loss through the inﬂamed membrane
can be high. Anorexia and prolonged ileus can further impact on
nutritional status.

321

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Peritonitis: management
2 Empiric antibiotic therapy should always be initiated in cases of deﬁnite
peritonitis without waiting for the results of cultures. Many therapeutic
protocols are available and will be inﬂuenced by local experience—discuss
with your microbiologist.
The International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (2010) recommends:
• Gram +ve cover with vancomycin or a cephalosporin, plus
• Gram –ve cover with an aminoglycoside or third-generation
cephalosporin.
2 IP administration is more effective than IV.
In the UK, despite concerns surrounding the development of vancomycin resistance, most units utilize vancomycin-based regimens. Protocols
differ from unit to unit, but, as an example:
• Vancomycin 2g IP on day 1, with a further dose on days 3–7,
depending on trough vancomycin levels (aim to keep trough level >15
micrograms/mL, plus
• Either gentamicin 0.6mg/kg IP daily (adjusted against trough gentamicin
levels on days 3–5;  ototoxicity) or, alternatively, to spare potential
aminoglycoside toxicity, ceftazidime 1g IP daily.
Once culture result and sensitivities known:
• If Gram +ve: continue vancomycin according to levels. If S. aureus, add
in rifampicin 300mg PO bd. Stop gentamicin/ceftazidime.
• If Gram –ve: continue ceftazidime or gentamicin. Although concerns
about aminoglycosides affecting residual renal function exist, this is
not borne out by current evidence. However, if the patient still has
a signiﬁcant UO (e.g. >500mL), many centres may prefer ceftazidime
over gentamicin. Stop vancomycin.
• If culture negative: continue both Gram +ve and Gram –ve cover, doses
adjusted according to trough levels.
• If mixed Gram –ve growth: add in metronidazole, and consider
laparotomy (2 suspect bowel perforation).
• Treat for 14–21 days.
X PD programmes with a high incidence of fungal peritonitis after antibiotics may consider prophylaxis with oral ﬂuconazole.
Mupirocin ointment administered to the catheter exit site can prevent
exit site infection and, potentially, S. aureus peritonitis.
3 Every episode of PD-related peritonitis should prompt a root cause
analysis and review of aseptic technique.

PERITONITIS: MANAGEMENT

Special considerations for APD
Even in the absence of peritonitis, long day dwells may be ‘misty’.
However, because cycling times are shorter, cloudy overnight dialysate
may not occur, even in the presence of peritonitis. Moreover, in some
cases, PD efﬂuent is drained directly into a sink.
This means it is very important for APD patients to recognize potential symptoms of peritonitis and to perform a dwell of at least 2 hours
(for visual inspection and sampling of ﬂuid for M, C+S).
Treatment also requires some modiﬁcations to normal APD technique. One option is to convert patients to CAPD for the duration of
the episode. More preferable is to give antibiotics into the last dwell on
the machine (sometimes called the ﬁrst ambulatory dwell).

Indications for PD catheter removal during
infection
• 2 Refractory peritonitis (cloudy bags persists after 5 days of
appropriate antibiotic therapy).
• Relapsing peritonitis (b p. 321).
• Fungal peritonitis.
• Persistent exit site or tunnel infection.
• Potential:
• Multiple episodes of peritonitis in an individual patient.
• Mycobacterial peritonitis.
• Peritonitis caused by multiple organisms of likely enteric origin.

A purulent 9 bloody discharge from a PD catheter exit site, often associated with erythema and pain. Crusting alone is not indicative of an acute
exit site infection. Scoring systems have been developed, including this one

recommendations: 2005 update. Perit Dial Int 2005; 25:107.

Causes
• Usually S. aureus, Pseudomonas.
• The use of prophylactic topical exit site ointment (e.g. mupirocin)
reduces such infections. Reducing nasal carriage of S. aureus is also
helpful.
Treatment
• Swab for culture, and conﬁrm PD ﬂuid is clear.
• Empiric therapy: start ﬂucloxacillin 500mg PO qds or ciproﬂoxacin
500mg PO bd if there is a history of Gram –ve infection.
• Topical antibiotics are not sufﬁcient.
• Adjust therapy once culture result and sensitivities known.
• Gram +ve organisms: continue ﬂucloxacillin, unless sensitivities dictate
otherwise. Treat for 14 days. If S. aureus conﬁrmed, consider adding
rifampicin 300mg bd.
• Gram –ve organisms: ciproﬂoxacin 500mg PO bd for 14 days.
 If Pseudomonas, dual treatment is often recommended (e.g. add IP
gentamicin or ceftazidime), and catheter change is often required.
Exit site trauma increases the likelihood of infection—it should 6 be protected from this (including dressings that immobilize the catheter, thereby
preventing pulling on the exit site).
Increasing the frequency of exit site care (to daily or twice daily dressings) is often advocated during infections. Crusts or scabs should not be
forcibly removed.
A tunnel infection is deﬁned as erythema and/or tenderness over the
subcutaneous catheter pathway 9 intermittent discharge from the exit
site. Diagnosis of tunnel infection is usually obvious clinically but can be
conﬁrmed by ultrasound examination. Treatment usually involves removing the catheter, as peritonitis is a common complication.

OTHER PD COMPLICATIONS

Drainage problems
This needs to be differentiated from the more serious UF failure. Catheter
ﬂow problems can present with either slow drainage (drainage takes >15–
20 minutes under gravity) or incomplete drainage (high residual volume
measured on PET or drain volume is less than the infused volume of a
‘rapid’ exchange).
Causes include:
• Constipation.
• Catheter malposition (usually migration out of the pelvis).
• Catheter occlusions (kinking, thrombus, ﬁbrin, and omental wrapping).
• Fluid leaks into subcutaneous tissue via hernias or at the catheter
insertion site.
Inﬂow problems can also occur for similar reasons—and also if the catheter tip is trapped in an area of intra-abdominal adhesions. Clinical assessment will usually determine the majority of causes. If necessary, plain KUB
can be performed to exclude catheter malposition and constipation.
The majority of drainage problems can be improved without surgical
intervention:
• Laxatives (most PD patients require regular laxatives, e.g. senna and
lactulose, but a short course of a stronger aperient, such as sodium
picosulfate, may be required).
• Intracatheter heparin locks (e.g. 500 units as a lock or 500 units/L in
exchanges), particularly if visible ﬁbrin in catheter or drainage ﬂuid.
• Thrombolytics, such as urokinase, may be instilled in the
catheter lumen.
• Endoluminal brushing ( infection!).
If surgical repositioning of the PD catheter is required, a concomitant
adhesiolysis and omentectomy should be considered.

Peritoneal leaks
Dialysate may leak down the catheter tunnel and spread into the subcutaneous tissues (or leak around the exit site). A patent processus vaginalis
may allow PD ﬂuid to track into the scrotum, mimicking a hernia or hydrocele. Small diaphragmatic hernias may permit PD ﬂuid to enter the pleural
space (usually on the right side).
Clinically, local oedema 9 peau d’orange skin appearance may signify a
subcutaneous leak. Pleural taps or aspirates from hydroceles can be tested
for glucose concentration to conﬁrm it is dialysis ﬂuid. If in doubt, perform
CT peritoneogram, e.g. infuse 100mL of non-ionic contrast into a 2L PD
bag, and drain in 1L. Perform CT 1–2 hours thereafter.
Leaks around the catheter often heal with temporary (2–4 weeks)
discontinuation of PD (temporary HD will usually be required). PD can
be restarted, using smaller exchange volumes to reduce intra-abdominal
pressure. If leaks recur, the PD catheter can be repositioned with a new
insertion site. Hernias should be repaired in a standard manner. APD with
a dry day (NIPD) can be particularly successful to minimize recurrence.

325

326

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP)
SEP is a feared complication of long-term PD therapy, with a poor prognosis. It is extremely rare before 3 years and has an incidence around 5%
at 5 years.
The peritoneal cavity becomes encased in ﬁbrous tissue, with bowel
wall thickening and peritoneal calciﬁcation. It is thought to be multifactorial in origin, with prior severe/recurrent peritonitis, foreign body reactions to plasticizers on catheters, and long-term PD exposure to high
concentration glucose-containing solutions all suggested to be pathogenic.
Clinically
• Symptoms of intermittent bowel obstruction (abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting).
• Poor UF or UF failure (b p. 332).
• Malnutrition is frequent and may be severe.
• Symptoms may occur after peritonitis and often after stopping PD (e.g.
post-transplantation).
Investigation
• CT abdomen is the investigation of choice, demonstrating peritoneal
thickening and calciﬁcation with entrapped bowel loops.
• Laparoscopy and peritoneal biopsy is diagnostic.
Management
• Evidence is limited:
• Stop PD (symptoms may paradoxically worsen).
• Early specialist dietetic input. Nasogastric feeding or TPN may be
required.
• X Drug therapy: immunosuppression (steroids, CNIs, azathioprine)
and tamoxifen (antiﬁbrotic) have all been tried, but evidence of
efﬁcacy is anecdotal at best.
• Surgery (enterolysis) is an option but only in specialist centres.
• Renal transplantation—some reported cases of improvement.
Prevention
• There are no effective screening tests, and onset may be rapid.
• Currently, there is no optimal duration of PD therapy, and decisions
should be tailored to the individual.
• Switching to HD may be advisable, based upon episodes of peritonitis
and/or deteriorating membrane function/UF failure.

OTHER PD COMPLICATIONS

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

PD adequacy
Introduction
Although the term dialysis adequacy is often restricted to the formal calculation of delivered dialysis dose in terms of weekly clearance of urea
(Kt/V) and creatinine (CrCl) (b p. 286), the measurement of dialysis
adequacy should mandate a more global assessment of health, including:
• Absence of uraemic symptoms.
• Nutritional status, appetite, weight, serum albumin.
• Fluid status.
• Quality of life (e.g. by subjective global assessment scoring).
• Improved biochemistry and correction of the complications of
uraemia, such as anaemia.
Delivered dialysis dose can be formally measured by calculating weekly
clearance for urea (Kt/V) and creatinine (CrCl) (b p. 286). The utility of
Kt/V, a kinetic measure derived from HD practice, remains contentious in
PD. Commercially available computer programmes will helpfully calculate
urea and creatinine clearances, based on dialysate and plasma urea and
creatinine values obtained during a PET (b p. 330) or other standardized
regimen.
The current US and UK PD adequacy targets are very similar:
• US KDOQI:
• Measure after 1 month, then 4-monthly.
• If residual urine output >100mL/day: combined urine and peritoneal
weekly Kt/V should be >1.7.
• If residual urine output <100mL/day: peritoneal weekly Kt/V should
be >1.7.
• UK Renal Association:
• Measure 6-monthly (or more frequently, if indicated).
• Combined urinary and peritoneal Kt/V ≥1.7/week or CrCl ≥50L/
week/1.73m2.
X Although there is no evidence that increasing the dose above these targets improve survival, it is generally accepted that they should be viewed
as minimum treatment standards and that the dialysis dose should be
increased as clinical circumstances dictate.
2 The most powerful predictor of patient survival on PD is not dialysis
adequacy, but the presence of residual renal function.
Preserving residual function is extremely important:
• Control BP, with preferential use of ACE-I or ARB.
• Avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, contrast, etc.
• Avoid dehydration and hypercalcaemia.

PD ADEQUACY

How to improve a low Kt/V 9 CrCl
Tailor changes, according to transporter status (b p. 318) Increasing
dialysate osmolality to increase UF and drain volumes will also improve
total clearance.
CAPD
• If high or high average transporter:
• The osmotic gradient is lost quickly, so reduce dwell times (possibly
allowing an additional exchange).
• Consider converting to APD to allow rapid cycling overnight.
• Increasing dwell volumes is unlikely to help, as it will slow down
exchanges and may reduce UF.
• If low or low average transporter:
• More time is required, as solute clearance is slower.
• Increasing dwell volumes and dwell times may help.
• Consider an overnight dwell.
APD
• Optimize cycle duration in accordance to patient transport status, as
described in ‘CAPD’ section (short cycles for high transporter). This
might necessitate increasing total duration of APD. Consider the use
of additional daytime exchanges.

329

330

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

The peritoneal equilibration test (PET)
The test
• The evening prior to PET, the patient performs a standard CAPD
exchange. The exchange should dwell for 8–12h.
• Drain overnight dwell over 20min, and note volume.
• Prepare a 2L 2.27%/2.5% dialysate solution bag at body temperature,
and infuse over 10min, with the patient in a supine position.
• After 10min, dialysate samples are collected as follows: drain 200mL
dialysate back into the ﬁll bag, and mix sample by inverting bag 2–3
times. Using aseptic technique, withdraw 10mL dialysate sample, and
send for determination of creatinine and glucose.
• Repeat at 2h.
• At 4h, completely drain the exchange over 20min. Weigh drain bag,
and record volume drained.
• Invert bag 2–3 times; send samples for creatinine and glucose.
• PET calculations:
• Dcr/Pcr = dialysate concentration of creatinine at 0, 2, and 4h,
divided by serum concentration of corrected creatinine.
• D/D0 = dialysate glucose concentration at 2h and 4h, divided by
dialysate glucose concentration at 0h.
• Residual renal function is estimated on 24h urine collection.

Interpretation
• If protocols are strictly followed, this is a highly reproducible
assessment of peritoneal membrane transport function.
• The ratio of dialysate and plasma creatinine concentrations (Dcr/Pcr
ratio) after a 4h dwell is a measure of solute equilibration.
• High transporters are deﬁned by a Dcr/Pcr >0.8 and low
transporters <0.5.
• In between these are high average (0.65–0.8) and low average
(0.5–0.64).
Since glucose absorbed from the dialysate is very quickly metabolized,
D/P ratio for glucose is meaningless. Instead, the fraction of glucose
absorbed from the dialysate at 4h is compared with the initial dialysis
solution (D/D0). This is also a useful indicator of transport status.
A PET is also a useful objective assessment of ultraﬁltration. However,
a UF volume <400mL after modiﬁed PET, utilizing a 3.86% glucose dwell,
is more speciﬁc for UF failure (b p. 332).

PD ADEQUACY

331

332

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

Ultraﬁltration (UF) failure
PD patients with ﬂuid overload are either struggling to be compliant with
a realistic ﬂuid restriction or have inadequate UF. Inadequate UF might
be the result of an inappropriate dialysis prescription or the failure of an
appropriate prescription to remove adequate ﬂuid volumes; the latter is
termed UF failure.
PD patients are asked to achieve an ideal dry weight through a ﬂuid
restriction and the use of hyperosmolar PD bags to produce UF. Residual
urine output (which may be stimulated with diuretics) is also very
important.
As a general rule, a patient should be able to UF ≥1L/day. If they are
anuric, (deﬁned as UO <100mL/day), then minimum daily UF should
be 750mL.

Approach
(See Fig. 4.10)
• Consider modiﬁed PET (sometimes called standardized permeability
analysis) to differentiate UF failure from other cases of ﬂuid
overload. 2 Net UF <400mL at 4h with 3.86% glucose deﬁnes
UF failure.
• Determining transporter status can also help diagnose the cause of UF
failure; in particular, is the patient a high transporter (b p. 318)?
• Evaluate the residual peritoneal volume during PET: a ‘normal’
residual volume is up to 200–250mL. Higher volumes might suggest
catheter-related drainage problems, rather than UF failure (i.e. the
patient may be removing ﬂuid through UF, but it does not drain out
adequately from their peritoneal cavity). Also check drain time during
the PET.
• Exclude ‘mechanical’ catheter or APD equipment problems
(b p. 325).
• Avoid long dwells (>4h) with low glucose concentrations.
• Use icodextrin, instead of glucose, for the longest dwell.
• If on APD, consider additional short day exchange.

Causes
• High transporter status (often seen in long-standing PD patients).
• If not high transporter, consider:
• Leaks (b p. 325).
• Reduced effective peritoneal surface area from peritoneal
adhesions.
• Increased lymphatic absorption.
• Aquaporin deﬁciency or failure (indicated by loss of sodium
sieving during modiﬁed PET/standardized permeability analysis).
• Patients with ultraﬁltration failure will usually need to be
switched to HD permanently. However, peritoneal membrane
function can sometimes be improved by resting PD (for 4–12
weeks) and might be considered where quality of life on
long-term HD will be poor (e.g. excessive travel times).

CHAPTER 4

Dialysis

The well PD patient
Introduction
Adequate dialysis: maintain residual renal and peritoneal membrane function.
• Dialysis adequacy should be measured in terms of clearance of small
solute clearance (including Kt/V and CrCl) and nutritional parameters.
• Aim for normotension by good salt and water removal—generally,
achieving minimum daily ﬂuid removal of >750mL.
• Preserving residual renal function (basically, UO) makes these goals
easier to achieve and may improve outcomes (making an argument for
use of ACE-I for ongoing renoprotection and avoiding nephrotoxins in
PD patients; 2 residual urine matters).
Changes in patients’ transport status over time (b p. 318) may make the
maintenance of satisfactory UF and small solute clearance difﬁcult without
imposing onerous dialysis regimens and unrealistic ﬂuid restrictions on
them. High intraperitoneal glucose concentrations, with consequent exposure to GDP or AGE, is suggested to accelerate peritoneal membrane
changes, so the use of low GDP solutions, such as twin-bag ‘physiological’
solutions, icodextrin, or amino acid solutions, may be desirable (X).

Complications
Minimize peritonitis episodes and exit site infections through education
and good technique. This includes teaching the patients to identify peritonitis at an early stage. Monitor nutritional status closely. The initial stages
of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) may be reversible; early diagnosis relies on high index of suspicion.

Social rehabilitation
PD is a home-based treatment that allows patients to retain their independence. It is important to grant individual PD patients a degree of ﬂexibility, e.g. adapting the timing of PD exchanges to work environments
(perhaps negotiating a dedicated area and delivery of ﬂuids to the work
place). Travel (either within the same country or abroad) improves
patients’ sense of well-being and should be encouraged. Support for
the other family members, including children and spouse, must never be
overlooked.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Transplantation: beneﬁts and
challenges
Introduction
For many patients with ESRD, transplantation is undoubtedly the treatment of choice. However, for some, the risks of transplantation (the
surgery itself plus subsequent immune suppression) will outweigh
potential beneﬁts. Suitability for transplantation has no set criteria but
should reﬂect the recipient’s physical status (‘ﬁtness’), likely quality of life
post-transplantation, and, wherever possible, the patient’s wishes (which
assumes adequate education).

Beneﬁts of transplantation
• Improved patient survival:
• It is not fair to make a straight comparison between the survival of
dialysis patients and the survival of transplanted patients, as many
dialysis patients are elderly 9 have comorbidities that preclude
transplantation.
• However, if the playing ﬁeld is levelled and patient’s survival
post-transplant is compared to a matched transplant-listed
dialysis cohort, there remains a signiﬁcant survival advantage, once
the initial risk of surgery is overcome (Fig. 5.1).
• Much of this improvement appears to stem from a reduction in CV
mortality.
• Improved quality of life:
• Freedom from the constraints of dialysis treatment, including the
time commitment and both dietary and ﬂuid restrictions.
• Improved overall sense of well-being.
• Improved exercise capacity.
• Improved quality of life for close family.
• More complete and physiological correction of the uraemic milieu,
including complications, such as anaemia and CKD-MBD.
• Improved sexual function and fertility, including the potential for
successful pregnancy in ♀ (b p. 864).
• Better for the health economics: transplantation is less expensive than
dialysis (after the ﬁrst year).
X The risk-beneﬁt ratio of renal transplantation is changing, although
much of the currently available data may not adequately reﬂect this.
There is a signiﬁcant difference between transplanting a 70-year-old
dialysis patient from a live donor and with an organ from a marginal
deceased donor, particularly if the recipient is thriving on a state-ofthe-art daily home dialysis therapy. Preliminary outcome data suggest
satisfactory, albeit less good, early outcomes, but patients must be very
carefully selected, given appropriate (and realistic) information and education and longer-term outcomes, including quality of life, need further
evaluation.

Transplant rate per 100 ESRD pt years

• The number of patients listed for transplantation globally has plateaued
in recent years after an extended period of relentless growth. Demand
continues to outstrip the supply of organs (see Figs 5.2 to 5.4).
• This inevitably leads to longer waiting times for deceased donor
transplantation (mean 73 years in the UK).

TRANSPLANTATION: BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES

• This disparity has encouraged the use of organs from more marginal
donors, e.g. donation after cardiac death (DCD) and elderly donors
with acknowledged comorbidity (b pp. 366–8). (See Fig. 5.5)
• Other efforts to expand the donor pool include the growth of live
donor programmes (including altruistic donation), dual transplants
(b p. 401), ABO- and HLA-incompatible grafts, and paired schemes
(b pp. 444–5).
• The CKD population is ageing. The median age of prevalent dialysis
patients in the UK is 765. This more elderly population is also more
comorbid, making selection for successful transplantation (and
appropriate matching of organs) more challenging.
• The ultimate goal is to prolong both patient and graft survival
post-transplantation. This requires:
• More effective and less toxic immune suppression.
• d morbidity and mortality from infection, malignancy, and CV
disease (2 better transplant function l lower CV mortality).

Transplantation outcomes
Renal transplant outcomes are traditionally measured in terms of:
• Graft survival (see Fig. 5.6).
• Patient survival.
• Graft function (e.g. SCr 9 eGFR at 1, 3, or 5 years).
Data come from large national and international registries. The most
important of these are:
• US Renal Database System (USRDS).
• The Collaborative Transplant Study (CTS).
• United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS).
• The Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry
(ANZDATA).
• UK National Transplant Database (maintained by NHS Blood and
Transplant).

Box 5.1 Key facts
• The 1-year survival for deceased donor renal transplants is 791%.
Patient survival is >95%.
• The 1-year survival for live donor renal transplants is 797%. Patient
survival is >98%.
• This has steadily improved over the last two decades.
• The 5-year survival for deceased donor renal transplants is 770%.
Patient survival is 780%.
• The 5-year survival for live donor renal transplants is 782%. Patient
survival is 790%.
• The 10-year survival for deceased donor renal transplants is 745%.
Patient survival is 760%.
• The 10-year survival for live donor renal transplants is >55%. Patient

Factors inﬂuencing graft survival
• Delayed graft function (DGF):
• Variably deﬁned (b p. 404).
• 73% in live donor and 720% in deceased donor kidneys (the rate
will vary signiﬁcantly, e.g. 730% for ECD kidneys and 740% for DCD
kidneys).

341

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

• DGF is itself a function of i donor age, i cold ischaemic time, and
the presence of signiﬁcant anti-HLA antibodies (b p. 405).
• DGF is associated with d graft survival, i mortality, i rejection (l
probably enhanced graft immunogenicity post-reperfusion).
• HLA matching:
• For deceased donor kidneys, better HLA matching is associated
with improved graft survival.
• This falls progressively with increasing mismatch (see Fig. 5.8).
• The effect is much less pronounced for live donor kidneys, whether
related or unrelated.
• Timing of transplantation:
• Pre-emptive transplantation provides a survival beneﬁt for both
graft and recipient.
• Graft survival deteriorates, with longer times on dialysis
pre-transplantation. Reasons: more recipient CV disease, higher
incidence of DGF, socio-economic factors.
• In the UK, 735% of adult live donor and just 710% of deceased
donor transplants are pre-emptive.

TRANSPLANTATION OUTCOMES

• Donor factors:
• Age: 5-year survival of a deceased donor kidney from a donor age
18–34 is 780%, compared to 755% for donor age >65.  This is
a very important issue, as the average donor age is progressively
increasing.
• Living donor grafts last longer than deceased donor grafts (less
cold ischaemia, better health of donor, often less time on dialysis
accruing CV disease and other complications, higher nephron mass,
better recipient compliance). See Box 5.1 on b p. 340.
• Donation after brain death (DBD) kidneys have better outcomes
than those donated after cardiac death (DCD) (b pp. 365–8).
• ECD kidneys have poorer, if acceptable, outcomes overall (although
this can be difﬁcult to predict at the time of transplantation).
• i cold ischaemic time (CIT) li DGF ld graft survival. This risk is
particularly high when CIT >18h. The time it will take to transport
a kidney is usually taken into account in organ allocation schemes
(b p. 365).
• Recipient factors:
• Age. The commonest cause of graft loss beyond age 65 is death
with a functioning transplant.
• Race. In the USA, black recipients of deceased donor transplants
have poorer outcomes than Caucasian recipients. This is partly due
to i DGF in black recipients as well as inferior HLA matching (the
donor pool is predominantly Caucasian).
• Obesity and other comorbidities (i BP, CV disease) (b pp. 370–1).
• The nature of the recipient’s original native kidney disease and the
risk of this disease recurring in the transplant.
• Rejection episodes (b p. 408):
• 2 A single episode of rejection reduces 5-year graft survival
by 710%.
• The greater the number of episodes, the worse the outcome.
• HLA antibodies (b p. 361–4):
• About 720% recipients develop anti-HLA antibodies
post-transplantation.
• The development of such antibodies trebles the risk of graft failure
(whether or not they are donor-speciﬁc).
• Donor-speciﬁc anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) are associated with
chronic antibody-mediated rejection (b p. 414–6).
• Proteinuria:
• As in native kidneys, a marker of renal injury, the risk of progressive
renal dysfunction, and overall CV morbidity and mortality. May also
herald recurrent native disease.
• Number of previous transplants (see Fig. 5.9).

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Basic transplant immunology
Introduction
A transplanted kidney will be antigenically distinct from its new host and
recognized as foreign and initiate an immune response, unless it is from a
genetically identical individual (essentially, an identical twin). In the context
of transplantation, these antigens are known as alloantigens (and the donor
kidney is often referred to as an allograft). The most relevant alloantigens
to transplantation are a group of histocompatibility genes known as the
major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Minor histocompatibility antigens are also relevant although less important. Alloantigen recognition
triggers immune cell activity and the activation of multiple potent effectors
of the immune response.

Histocompatibility and allorecognition
The MHC presents fragments of ‘non-self’ proteins to T cells in order to
initiate an immune response. In humans, the MHC genes on chromosome
6 encode a polymorphic group of proteins called human leucocyte antigens (HLA). Their main function is to present antigens to T cells. There
are two classes:
• Class I HLA includes HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C and is present on
all nucleated cells, including vascular endothelium. They exist as a
heterodimer with B2 microglobulin. Class I molecules present non-self
peptides to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, leading to their activation.
Self-antigens are not recognized, as immunological tolerance, to them,
has developed during T cell maturation.
• Class II HLA includes HLA-DR, HLA-DQ and HLA-DP and is present
mainly on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages,
mesangial cells, and dendritic cells. Other cells can be induced to
express class II HLA during conditions of inﬂammation. They are
also heterodimers but consist of two polymorphic chains (i.e. no B2
microglobulin). Class II antigens present peptides to CD4+ T cells,
leading to their clonal expansion. In addition, activated CD4+ cells
release cytokines that activate CD8+ cells.
Each individual inherits an HLA allele from each parent (a haplotype).
The recognition of transplanted HLA by recipient T cells is by direct and
indirect pathways (see Fig. 5.10).
• Direct pathway. Donor (passenger) APCs present foreign peptides
to recipient cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, leading to their activation. This
pathway is largely responsible for early acute cell-mediated rejection.
• Indirect pathway. Donor cells or donor proteins shed from cell surfaces
are engulfed by recipient APCs and presented to recipient CD4+
helper T cells. This is thought to mediate more chronic graft damage.
The binding of a T cell to an APC leads to the initiation of the immune
reaction. This process requires three distinct steps or ‘signals’:
• Signal 1 (TCR activation). Binding of APC MHC-peptide complex to the
T cell receptor (TCR) activates multiple intracellular pathways. One
of these pathways involves the phosphatase calcineurin (i intracellular

BASIC TRANSPLANT IMMUNOLOGY

Ca2+l activation of calcineurin l activation of nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NFAT) l IL-2 release (but only in the presence of
signal 2).
• Signal 2 (co-stimulation). Binding of complementary co-stimulatory
pathway molecules present on APC and T cells (e.g. CD40:CD40
ligand and ICAM:LFA1) l activation of tyrosine kinase, which, together
with signal 1, leads to induction of IL-2 and other T cell activation
genes. Other interactions, such as B7:CTLA4, are inhibitory.
• Signal 3. Signals 1 + 2 l induction of cytokine, cytokine receptors, and
cell activation genes (including IL-2 and IL-2R) l clonal proliferation.
If signal 1 occurs without the subsequent signal 2, then T cell activation is
not initiated, and instead apoptosis results.

T cell activation
T cell activation involves their proliferation and clonal expansion (meaning all cells express the same TCR), prior to differentiation into effector
cells (which no longer require co-stimulation for activation) (see Fig. 5.11).
CD4+ effector cells include TH1, TH2, regulatory and memory cells:
• TH1 cells activate macrophages, provide help to B cells, and synthesize
several important cytokines.
• TH2 cells mainly provide B cell help (including immunoglobulin class
switching).
• TH17 cells are involved in inﬂammatory responses (e.g. to bacteria).
• Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress T cell responses.
• Memory T cells are a component of immunological memory
(the ability to respond promptly and intensely, following antigen
representation).
CD8+ cells develop into a single cytotoxic effector cell population,
involved in the killing of both infected cells and tumour cells.

B cells
B cells are responsible for antibody production. B cell activation follows
antigen recognition via the B cell receptor (BCR—itself a type of antibody) and requires additional T cell help (provided by CD4+ TH1 and
TH2 cells—see above). B cells represent the antigen that has triggered
them (with MHC class II), so T cells reactive to the same antigen provide the help. Activation leads to proliferation prior to differentiation into
antibody-producing plasma cells (usually found in bone marrow). A small
proportion of activated B cells will become memory B cells.

BASIC TRANSPLANT IMMUNOLOGY

Tolerance
• The holy grail of organ transplantation: permanent survival of a
transplant without the need for maintenance immunosuppression.
• Tolerance implies that alloreactive cells have either been deleted or
do not respond to transplanted alloantigens.
• An important and exciting focus of international research efforts in
transplantation (see M http://www.immunetolerance.org).
• Rare cases of tolerance are recognized in renal transplantation
(usually in the context of non-compliance!).
• The induction of tolerance has proved possible in rodent models but
remains elusive in humans, probably because we have a much more
extensive immunological memory.
• Many reports claim partial tolerance, based on the minimal use of
immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. lower levels of maintenance immune
suppression, following induction with alemtuzumab).
• Complete tolerance has been described in the context of renal after
bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from the same donor. This is
because BMT may result in the total replacement of the recipient’s
bone marrow (and 6 haematopoietic cells) with the donor’s—a state
known as full chimerism.
• Similar principles have been applied with some success to patients
with multiple myeloma and ESRD undergoing combined BM and
renal transplantation.
• It is also known that infusion of donor-derived bone marrow cells
can improve graft survival, and there is interest in translating this into
immunosuppressive strategies.
• Successful protocols have been reported, utilizing donor cell
infusions (CD34 +ve progenitor cells and CD3 +ve T cells), but they
require formidable conditioning regimens (total lymphoid irradiation
and T cell depletion) so are unlikely to be universally accepted.
• In addition, these protocols involve well HLA-matched transplants.
It is not clear how such approaches will translate to the much more
challenging setting of HLA-mismatched transplantation (BMT across
HLA barriers is problematic li rejection and graft vs host disease).
• A likely future approach will be to speciﬁcally bioengineer cell
therapy with haematopoietic stem cells (e.g. see M http://www.
onestudy.org).

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Pre-transplant work-up
Patient selection
All patients approaching ESRD should be considered for transplantation,
unless there is an absolute contraindication. The ﬁrst step is appropriate
education so that they understand the need to proceed through a series
of structured investigations.
Contraindications
UK BTS guidelines suggest the following absolute contraindications:
• Uncontrolled malignancy.
• Uncontrolled infection.
• X Life expectancy of <5 years.
Additional potential contraindications
• Cirrhosis (unless combined liver and kidney transplant).
• Primary oxalosis (unless combined liver and kidney transplant).
• Substance abuse.
• Morbid obesity (X cut-off BMI unclear).
• Recent MI or coronary intervention (see Assessment for
cardiovascular disease, b p. 352).
• Ejection fraction <30%.
• Habitual, irremediable, non-compliance.
Note: age alone is not a contraindication to transplantation.

Patient education
Before formal pre-transplant investigations, potential transplant recipients should ideally attend a local education session. The purpose of this
forum is to provide patients (and relatives) with a greater insight into
the following:
• Risk and beneﬁts of renal transplantation.
• Live donor transplantation vs deceased donor transplantation.
• The nature and rationale for work-up investigations. How long these
may take.
• Waiting time for deceased donor kidneys.
• Different types of deceased donor; DBD, DCD, ECD.
• What to expect in the post-operative period.
• The nature and frequency of outpatient follow-up.
• Immunosuppression and its side effects.
• The crucial importance of compliance with medication.
The sessions should be hosted by members of the entire transplant
team, including nurse specialists, pharmacists, physicians, and surgeons.
It is also an opportunity to introduce the patient to others who have
previously undergone transplantation.
Pre-transplant assessment
Potential recipients must be ﬁt to undergo surgery and long-term immune
suppression. Routine assessment starts with a detailed history and a

PRE-TRANSPLANT WORK-UP

thorough physical examination. Most transplant centres have a checklist
of work-up investigations (for example, see b p. 352).
This assessment is a multidisciplinary process, during which both a nephrologist and a transplant surgeon should review the patient and the results
of their investigations. Transplant coordinators, specialist nurses, psychologists, urologists, cardiologists, and tissue typists will also play important
roles in the work-up of patients to a greater or lesser extent, depending
on individual need.
2 In the UK, patients may be listed for deceased donation when dialysis
is predicted within the subsequent 6 months. It is important to avoid
unnecessary delays (and investigations)—annual mortality whilst awaiting a transplant is 76%.
Goals of transplant work-up
• To determine physical ﬁtness for transplantation (esp. CV ﬁtness).
• To conﬁrm that a transplant is surgically (+ urologically) feasible.
• To identify any potential impediments to transplantation and any
corrective interventions that might remove them.
• To provide adequate and ongoing patient education.
Goals of medical assessment
• Assessment for CV disease.
• Assessment of other medical comorbidities.
• Review of thrombosis/bleeding history.
• Assessment of infection risk/history.
• Review of any previous malignant disease.
• Review of underlying native renal disease.
• Review of immunological history (anti-HLA antibody status).
Goals of surgical assessment
• Assessment of vasculature, particularly iliac and peripheral vessels.
• Previous abdominal surgery and hernias.
• Previous renal transplant history.
• Assessment of BMI and surgical risks.
• Assessment of previous urological history or current symptoms.
• Is the recipient’s bladder function likely to be adequate
post-transplant? Is bladder outﬂow adequate?
• Assessment of native kidneys, e.g. do large polycystic kidneys require
removal?
• Which side will the graft be placed?
General
• Assessment of compliance.
• Assessment of mental health (see Assessment of mental health,
b p. 359).
• Plans for pregnancy in ♀ of childbearing age.
• Social factors: employment, family support, etc.

Assessment for cardiovascular disease
Cardiovascular disease burden in CKD
Advanced CKD is associated with a high risk of CV disease, ranging from
coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure to PVD and stroke.
Potential renal transplant candidates need to be scrutinized for CV disease
and CV risk factors and to have them proactively treated to maximize graft
and patient survival post-transplantation.

PRE-TRANSPLANT WORK-UP

• CV disease is the leading cause of death after transplantation.
• 750% of deaths with a functioning graft occurring within 30 days of
transplantation are due to CAD.
• The relationship between CKD and CV disease is described on b
p. 198. Certain risk factors are discussed in the following section,
as they are relevant for risk stratiﬁcation and guiding choice of
pre-transplant cardiac investigations.
• CV assessment prior to transplantation is considered an essential
exercise by most transplant centres—however, optimal investigations
and interventions remain controversial.
• Most centres take into consideration: (i) current cardiac symptoms;
(ii) prior history of established cardiac disease; (iii) risk factors.
•  All potential recipients have a degree of CV risk, as relative risk of
CV disease is disproportionally high in young ESRD patients.
Risk factors
Many centres use a single risk factor from the list below as a trigger for
non-invasive cardiac stress testing. i BP (9 LVH) and i lipids are not
included, as they are so highly prevalent in ESRD patients.
• Diabetes.
• Age >50.
• Previous coronary revascularization.
• Established non-cardiac vascular disease (i.e. PVD or CVA). (See
Table 5.3.)
• Abnormal resting ECG (other than LVH).
• Smoking.
• Dialysis duration >12 months.
• Previous renal transplant.
Approach to CV assessment
• History. Angina, d exercise tolerance, breathlessness, claudication, and
symptoms suggestive of cerebrovascular disease. Traditional cardiac
risk factors.
• Examination. Evidence of cardiac failure, murmurs, and review of
peripheral vasculature (palpable aortic aneurysm, vascular bruits,
missing pulses, distal limb ischaemic changes).
• All patients will need a CXR and an ECG.
• Echo if clinical suspicion of a valve lesion, cardiac failure, pericardial
effusion, signiﬁcant LVH on ECG, or cardiomegaly on CXR.
• An ejection fraction <30% is considered a contraindication to deceased
donor transplantation (li perioperative mortality, poor early graft
perfusion, and increased risk of transplant vein thrombosis).
• Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can identify patients at high
risk of post-operative complications.
Risk stratiﬁcation
Based on the CV assessment, patients can be stratiﬁed as follows:
Symptomatic patients
• Symptomatic patients should be referred to a cardiologist for coronary
angiography.

353

354

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

• Additional functional tests, such as dobutamine stress
echocardiography (DSE), may be considered, but the key symptomatic
and prognostic question is whether the patient will beneﬁt from
coronary revascularization.
•  The risks of contrast nephropathy 9 cholesterol emboli need
careful consideration in this group of patients. Patients may be
rendered temporarily, or permanently, dialysis-dependent.
Asymptomatic patients with risk factors
• Whilst there is no convincing evidence that anatomical or functional
testing is of either diagnostic or prognostic value in asymptomatic
patients without renal failure, it is generally accepted that patients with
renal failure are a unique group and that such assessment is highly
desirable.
•  The absence of symptoms is not always reliable—many patients
with ESRD have limited exercise capacity, and volume overload may
obscure myocardial ischaemia.
• In diabetic patients, symptom burden is a poor indicator of ischaemia
(autonomic neuropathy l defective ‘anginal warning’).
• Asymptomatic patients with any of the risk factors listed should 6
undergo stress testing, with either a DSE or a myocardial perfusion
scan (MPS).
• The interpretation of non-invasive cardiac investigations must be
guarded in the context of ESRD (see Table 5.1). The sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, and positive and negative predictive values of these
investigations are shown in Table 5.2.
• Head-to-head comparison of DSE vs MPS reveals that neither is better
nor perfect, but both are superior to alternatives.
• The FAME study highlighted the importance of combining anatomical
ﬁndings with functional tests:
• Fractional ﬂow reserve (FFR) may help to guide management of a
coronary stenosis in an asymptomatic dialysis patient.
• If the stenosis is associated with downstream ischaemia (identiﬁed
either by an abnormal FFR or a reversible perfusion defect), the
patient should be offered revascularization.
Asymptomatic patients without risk factors
• Resting ECG and CXR to determine the need for either an echo or
MPS/DSE. Otherwise, no further investigation is usually necessary.

Resting ECG

Normal ECG does not exclude CAD.
Abnormal ECG predicts CAD but non-speciﬁc (up
to 40% of dialysis patients have an abnormal ECG).

Exercise stress

A high proportion of patients have baseline ECG
abnormalities.

perfusion. However, an abnormal test suggests a
high risk of signiﬁcant CAD.

Dobutamine stress

Operator-dependent, and adequate acoustic window
is not possible in 720% of patients.
Many dialysis patients do not achieve target heart
rate (ld sensitivity of the test—although failure to
attain maximal stress may itself be a risk factor for
subsequent cardiac events).

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Rescreening
• Patients may wait for several years for a transplant, so regular
assessment is essential.
• Data concerning the annual incidence of cardiac events in CKD
patients after normal stress imaging test suggest rates increase
from 4–12% within 2 years to 10–30% beyond 2 years. This implies
cardiac rescreening should be undertaken every 2 years (sooner if
symptomatic).
• It is interesting to note that cardiac event rates, following a normal
MPS in the general population, are <1% per year, underlining the
increased CV risk for patients with advanced CKD.

Revascularization
• The purpose of CAD intervention (either by surgical means or
percutaneously through the use of stenting) is to restore blood ﬂow
to an ischaemic area of myocardium. Revascularization procedures do
not alter the pathophysiological processes involved in CAD but simply
serve to improve blood ﬂow and prevent infarction.
• The best method of revascularization for patients with ESRD has not
been established. Studies can only be extrapolated from the general
population, but support both surgical and percutaneous options as
effective in symptomatic disease.
• CABG complication rates are 710% higher in ERSD patients. However,
it is the treatment of choice for patients with multivessel disease and
LV dysfunction (l symptomatic and prognostic beneﬁt).
• Any patient who has had a STEMI/NSTEMI, but not required
revascularization, should not be considered for transplantation until
cleared by a cardiologist 6 months after the event (this will usually
involve further investigation).
• Stented patients need to wait until dual antiplatelet therapy has
ceased (l intraoperative bleeding risk). Generally, 12 months for a
drug-eluting stent and 3 months for a bare metal stent.

Cholecystitis post-transplant can be severe. Screen
patients with a relevant history for gallstones.

Hyperparathyroidism

Parathyroidectomy post-transplantation is associated
with graft dysfunction through uncertain mechanisms
(6 control hyperparathyroidism pre-transplant).

PRE-TRANSPLANT WORK-UP

Thrombotic or bleeding tendency
Pro-thrombotic tendency
• Any evidence of a pro-thrombotic tendency should be investigated
with a thorough thrombophilia screen. Examples:
• Previous transplant loss due to arterial or venous thrombosis.
• Recurrent AVF thrombosis.
• History of DVT/PE.
• SLE (associated APS, b p. 664).
• Recurrent miscarriages.
• A pro-thrombotic history or condition does not preclude
transplantation, but patients should have an agreed treatment plan
established in advance, with the aim of minimizing thrombotic
complications and early graft loss.
Bleeding tendency
• Thrombocytopenia or prolonged INR or APTT warrant
haematological investigation.

Anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs
• Anticoagulation should be reversed prior to transplantation:
• IV unfractionated heparin should be started as soon as is deemed
surgically acceptable post-transplant in high-risk patients (e.g.
prosthetic valve or thrombotic tendency).
• Aim APTT 1.5–2.0.
• Avoid LMWH until GFR has normalized post-transplant.
• Re-anticoagulate prior to discharge
• Antiplatelet drugs:
• Aspirin may be continued peri-transplantation.
• Dual antiplatelet therapy is considered a relative contraindication
to transplantation in many centres.

Infection risk and infection history
• Ensure serological screening has been undertaken. See Box 5.2,
b p. 352.
• There should be no active infection at the time of transplantation; in
particular, check:
• Diabetic foot ulcers.
• Recent dialysis catheter infections or PD-related infections, such as
peritonitis, have been fully treated.
• UTI.
• Any recent signiﬁcant infectious disease contact, e.g. TB.
• Renal transplantation in patients with HIV, HBV, and HCV is discussed
in b Chapter 8.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Review of previous malignancy
• Uncontrolled or recent malignancy is a contraindication to
transplantation.
• The use of immunosuppression is associated with an increased risk of
both de novo and recurrent malignancy in transplant recipients.
• As a general rule of thumb, patients with treated malignant disease
should be recurrence-free for ≥2 years (≥5 years in some situations).
• Helpful guidance for speciﬁc tumours can be obtained from the Israel
Penn International Transplant Tumor Registry (M <http://ipittr.uc.edu>).
• For the common cancers, see Table 5.4.

Pre-transplant cancer screening
• In ♀, ensure cervical smear testing and mammography are current.
• Encourage self-examination of breasts and testes.
• Bowel screening with FOB testing is now national practice in the UK
for all those aged >60.
• Patients with a long history of ESRD often develop acquired cystic
disease in their native kidneys, which is associated with malignancy—
screening native kidneys is included in work-up protocols.
• Most centres use PSA to screen 4 patients aged >50 or if strong FH
of prostate cancer.
• Serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunoﬁxation for
patients aged >60 should be considered.

PRE-TRANSPLANT WORK-UP

Native renal disease
• Many primary renal diseases may recur (b p. 418). Patients need to
be counselled regarding the risk for their particular native disease.
• Certain disorders must be in remission prior to transplantation, e.g.
systemic vasculitis (b p. 647), anti-GBM disease (b p. 657), SLE (b
p. 663).
• Patients with ESRD, caused or complicated by urinary tract obstruction
(9 urinary infection), require urological assessment.

Assessment of mental health
Introduction
• Due attention should be given to psychosocial issues as they may
impact on quality of life (and compliance) post transplant. When
identiﬁed, many are correctable—either with individualized treatment
or through social intervention.
• The uncertainty of transplant listing may in itself cause anxiety.
Furthermore, dialysis may have already affected a patient’s ability to
work, their social engagement, and their self-esteem.
• Psychosocial support, including counselling, formal psychiatric input,
and social work may be necessary.
• Evaluation of a patient’s social situation, relationships, and ﬁnancial
situation can be valuable, as many of these factors may be modiﬁable
in anticipation of a transplant.
• Rarely, the capacity of a patient to consent to treatment may require
assessment.
Pre-existing psychiatric illness
• Evidence suggests that transplant outcomes in patients with
pre-existing mental health issues are suboptimal.
• However, a psychiatric disorder is not an absolute contraindication to
transplantation, although careful evaluation is required.
• With adequate social support, good insight, reliable interpersonal
relationships, and coping strategies in place, patients with mental
health issues can be considered for transplantation.
• Chronic illnesses, such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective
disorder, may still have a good outcome in selected stable patients.
• Severe personality disorders are considered a contraindication by
most transplant centres.
• Substance misuse may interfere with compliance.
• Long-standing anxiety or affective disorders do not appear to
predict worse outcomes after transplant.
Drug issues
•  Corticosteroids have well-recognized neuropsychiatric adverse effects,
including depression, mania, psychosis, and delirium. A minority of patients
may suffer from neuropsychiatric ciclosporin (CIC) toxicity. Tacrolimus
(TAC) has been associated with sleep disturbances and irritability.
• It is important to identify potential interactions between immune
suppression and psychiatric medication prior to transplantation.
• Lithium should ideally be avoided post-transplant (nephrotoxicity), but
any change in treatment will require a period of assessment to ensure
mood stability.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Compatibility: matching donor to
recipient
Introduction
Five fundamental issues must be considered:
• Blood group.
• Tissue type (HLA).
• Anti-HLA antibodies (particularly donor-speciﬁc antibody, DSA).
• Donor characteristics.
• Recipient characteristics.

Blood group
ABO antigens are cell surface glycoproteins expressed not just on red
blood cells, but on many cell types, e.g. vascular endothelial cells—including those in a transplanted kidney. Naturally occurring anti-blood group
antibodies to non-self ABO antigens develop in early life (probably in
response to exposure to bacterial antigens).
• Group O individuals develop both anti-A and anti-B antibody.
• Group A and B individuals develop anti-B or anti-A antibody,
respectively.
• Group AB individuals do not develop antibodies.
Circulating anti-A or anti-B antibody at the time of transplantation will
recognize and bind ABO antigens on donor endothelium, activate complement, and cause catastrophic vascular injury (l‘hyperacute’ rejection).
For this reason, ABO-incompatible transplants are generally avoided,
particularly in deceased donor transplantation. The same rules apply for
transplantation and blood transfusions, i.e. group ‘O’ are universal donors
and ‘AB’ universal recipients. However, ABO-incompatible transplants can
be contemplated in certain circumstances (b p. 444).

Tissue typing
Many hundreds of HLA antigens exist, and HLA nomenclature (based on
recognition with speciﬁc antisera and, more recently, DNA sequencing)
has been gradually reﬁned over time. HLA antigens are allocated numbers
as they are identiﬁed. Where newer antisera have allowed a reﬁnement
of previous speciﬁcities, the antigens are referred to as split and shown in
brackets, e.g. the antigen formerly known as HLA-A9 has been split into
A-23 and -24 and written A-23(9) and A-24(9).
DNA technology has revealed multiple different HLA alleles, and these
are shown with an *, e.g. HLA-A*0101 is an allele of HLA-A1. However,
theses alleles are usually still described more broadly, using the wider
‘traditional’ serological groupings.
If an individual inherits the same HLA antigen from each parent, they
are homozygous for that locus. Some antigens are inherited together
more often than might be anticipated by chance; this is known as linkage
disequilibrium.

COMPATIBILITY: MATCHING DONOR TO RECIPIENT

Relevance
The most relevant HLA antigens to clinical transplantation, particularly
organ allocation, are the 750 encompassed serologically by HLA-A and
-B (class I) and HLA-DR (class II). These were the antigens observed to
most signiﬁcantly inﬂuence outcome in the early days of HLA typing,
although their effect is probably less powerful with contemporary immune
suppression.
The degree of mismatch (rather than match—and, yes, this is very confusing!) between the donor and recipient is usually quoted at these three loci,
i.e. HLA identical donors are a 0-0-0 mismatch, whereas donor:recipient
pairs who share one HLA-A, one HLA-B, and one HLA-DR are referred
to as a 1-1-1 mismatch. If all are different, it is termed a 2-2-2 mismatch.
There are a number of minor HLA antigens, but their clinical impact is
minimal.
Beneﬁts of a well HLA-matched graft
• d incidence of acute rejection (less evident with modern immune
suppression).
• d incidence of DGF.
• i long-term graft survival. HLA-DR matching appears the most
powerful in this context, but the number of mismatches is important
(see Fig. 5.8). This still holds true for live donor pairs, particularly for
0-0-0 mismatches, but it is much less powerful (b p. 373).
• d subsequent formation of anti-HLA antibodies (b pp. 361–4).
2 Each mismatched HLA antigen is likely to initiate an immune response,
which might be especially relevant if repeat transplantation is ever necessary. Recipients may develop anti-HLA antibodies or memory T cells
against mismatched antigens, making organs with these antigens subsequently ‘unacceptable’ for a given recipient.

Anti-HLA antibodies
HLA matching alone is not sufﬁcient. Anti-HLA antibodies present in the
recipient at the time of transplantation may cause aggressive rejection,
particularly if directed against particular HLA antigens in the transplanted
kidney, termed donor-speciﬁc antibody (DSA).
Patients are ‘sensitized’ (i.e. develop anti-HLA antibodies) when previously exposed to non-self HLA antigens. HLA antibodies may recognize
an epitope that is shared by multiple HLA molecules and are 6 often
cross-reactive.
Key sensitization events
• Previous organ transplant (2 the degree of mismatching is very
important: a 0-0-0 mismatch is less likely to become sensitized).
• Previous pregnancy (directed against paternal HLA antigens).
• Previous blood transfusion.
• Unknown (possibly caused by cross-reactivity with microbial antigens).

361

362

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Screening for HLA antibodies
Historically, HLA antibody screening was undertaken with the
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay and described in terms
of panel reactivity.
Panel reactive antibodies (PRA)
PRA measures the antibody speciﬁcities in an individual serum sample
against a panel of HLA antigens.
CDC assay: the patient’s serum is incubated with lymphocytes from a
panel of representative donors in the presence of complement. The PRA
is expressed as the percentage of wells with cell lysis, e.g. a PRA of 45%
implies recipient antibodies against 45% of the most commonly occurring
antigens in that population. A PRA >10% generally deﬁnes a sensitized
recipient and >85% highly sensitized.
2 The higher a patient’s PRA, the more likely they will have a positive
cross-match (b p. 363) at the time of transplantation.
In more recent years, the CDC assay has been superseded by less cumbersome, and more sensitive, solid phase assays.
HLA antibody screening with solid phase assays
• These are either ELISA- or ﬂow cytometry-based.
• Advantages over CDC: rapid, quantitative (strength of the ﬂuorescent
signal indicates amount of antibody present), highly sensitive, fewer
false +ves, easier to identify antibody speciﬁcities, does not require
lymphocytes, can detect non-complement ﬁxing antibodies.
• ELISA: puriﬁed HLA antigens are bound to wells of an ELISA plate.
• Flow cytometry: puriﬁed HLA antigens are bound to ﬂuorescently
labelled microspheres. Now the gold standard technique. Luminex® is
the most commonly used commercial system. Results are reported as
units of median ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) that reﬂect the amount of
antibody to speciﬁc HLA sensitivities present in the serum.
• Solid phase assays report individual antibody speciﬁcities but can
generate the equivalent of a PRA, based on known population antigen
frequencies—termed calculated PRA or reaction frequency.
• The sensitivity of solid phase assays means that the calculated PRA is
higher than a CDC PRA.

Non-HLA antibodies
• Antibody-mediated rejection and transplant glomerulopathy (b
p. 415) can develop despite an absence of anti-HLA antibodies.
• Non-HLA antibodies, directed against non-HLA donor antigens
(including proteins on donor vascular endothelium), appear capable
of stimulating graft inﬂammation and have been associated with
worse outcomes.
• It is possible that reperfusion injury (and graft inﬂammation from
other causes) exposes previously sequestered kidney antigens.
• Whether such non-HLA antibodies are always pathogenic or if
they might prove useful biomarkers for the prediction of transplant
outcomes remains to be seen.

COMPATIBILITY: MATCHING DONOR TO RECIPIENT

The role of HLA antibody testing
Pre-transplantation
• HLA antibodies should be measured at the time of listing for
transplantation and about every 3 months thereafter.
• If present, the antibody speciﬁcities will identify unacceptable
antigens. Recipients will not be offered a kidney possessing these
antigens.
• HLA antibodies may be identiﬁed that subsequently disappear.
These antigens are no longer unacceptable, but close surveillance
for recurrence is required post-transplantation.
•  The concern is rejection; this may be immediate and
aggressive (‘hyperacute’), if pre-formed antibody is present in
large amounts (2 cross-matching should prevent this), or early
post-transplant if there are lower amounts of antibody initially,
but a B cell (or memory T cell) response is initiated.
• High sensitivity ﬂow cytometric assays can detect antibody in
such low amounts that it may not be sufﬁcient to cause a positive
cross-match. Although a concern, these antibodies may not
preclude transplantation. However, they mandate very close
post-transplant surveillance.
Post-transplantation
• Measure monthly for the ﬁrst 3 months (weekly in selected cases),
then 3-monthly for the ﬁrst year, then annually.
• Also measure if acute or chronic antibody-mediated rejection is
suspected.
•  20% will develop anti-HLA antibodies post-transplantation,
increasing the risk of graft loss 3-fold.
• These outcomes are worse, whether or not the antibody is
donor-speciﬁc (DSA).
• DSA is associated with both acute antibody-mediated rejection
(b p. 409) and transplant glomerulopathy (b p. 415).
• The complement-binding capacity of DSA may help identify patients
at higher risk for graft loss and help improve risk stratiﬁcation when
planning management.

Cross-matching
• 2 Cross-matching is used to determine whether recipient serum
reacts with donor T and B lymphocytes immediately prior to
transplantation.
• The principle was established before the more reﬁned identiﬁcation of
speciﬁc anti-HLA antibodies discussed on b p. 362.
• It can be undertaken with complement-dependent cytotoxicity
(CDC-XM) or by ﬂow cytometry (FC-XM):
• CDC-XM is performed separately for T and B cells.
• Dithiothreitol (DTT) is added to serum to disaggregate IgM, as IgM
antibodies are not relevant to transplantation.

363

364

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

• Sensitivity can be increased by adding goat anti-human antibody
(binds recipient antibody l improved antibody cross-linkage and
fuller complement activation).
• FC-XM is more sensitive and has reduced the early incidence of
antibody-mediated rejection.
• FC-XM also distinguishes between T and B cells (by using
ﬂuorescent anti-CD3 and anti-CD19 antibodies, respectively).
• The ﬂow cytometer mixture consists of prepared donor
lymphocytes (lymphocytes are used, as donor lymphocytes are
relatively easy to isolate), recipient serum, and anti-Fc antibodies
tagged with a ﬂuorescent dye.
• Fluorescence intensity quantiﬁes positivity.
• Note: A virtual cross-match involves determining the presence or
absence of DSA through the comparison of the patients known HLA
antibody speciﬁcity proﬁle to the HLA type of the potential donor,
without carrying out a ‘hot’ or ‘acute’ CDC-XM or FC-XM.
Interpreting the cross-match result
• T cells express class I HLA, and B cells express both class I and II HLA.
• HLA antibodies against class I will 6 be active against both T and
B cells.
• 2 Since class I HLA is expressed on all nucleated cells, including
donor vascular endothelium, a positive T cell cross-match is a
contraindication to transplantation, as it implies pre-formed antibody
will react with donor endothelium.
• X The signiﬁcance of an isolated positive B cell cross-match is less
clear, but it is probably an oversimpliﬁcation to suggest that it indicates
the presence of class II HLA antibodies that do not pose a threat to
the graft.
• Furthermore, donor endothelium will express class II HLA under
certain circumstances, especially inﬂammation.
CDC-XM and FC-XM are often performed (and interpreted) together.
This interpretation is made easier if a recent recipient anti-HLA
antibody screen is available, as antibodies causing a reaction in the
cross-match might not always be anti-HLA.
• Positive T cell CDC-XM: a positive T cell CDC-XM almost
always indicates anti-class I HLA antibodies. Transplantation is
contraindicated.
• Positive B cell CDC-XM: may be a false positive, and transplantation
may proceed under certain circumstances. However, transplantation
is contraindicated if class II HLA DSA is known to be present (esp. if
speciﬁc for HLA-DR).
• Positive FC-XM and negative CDC-XM: this implies antibody is present
at low titre. However, a positive T cell FC-XM contraindicates
transplantation.
X A positive B cell FC-XM is a more controversial area, and protocols differ from centre to centre.
2 Live donor transplantation can provide the opportunity to proceed
with transplantation despite a DSA 9 a positive cross-match (b p. 444).

COMPATIBILITY: MATCHING DONOR TO RECIPIENT

Donor characteristics
There are several types of kidney donor. Live kidney donation is discussed
on b p. 372. Deceased donors are the commonest source of transplant
in many countries, including the USA and UK, although live donor programmes in some centres have recently exceeded deceased donor rates.
Deceased donors are classiﬁed according to mode of death.
Donation after brain death (DBD)
Previously referred to as ‘heart-beating’ donors. The most important
donor type historically. Once brainstem death has been diagnosed, the
patient is legally dead and can be managed as a potential donor on ITU.
This management aims to maintain organ suitability for transplantation.
Essentially, the donor has irreversible structural brain damage and is
unresponsive, in a coma, and ventilator-dependent. Systemic perfusion is
preserved, and organ retrieval occurs whilst some degree of cardiac output remains (meaning ischaemic injury is minimized).
See Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. A Code of Practice for the
Diagnosis and Conﬁrmation of Death, October 2008. M http://www.aomrc.
org.uk/publications/reports-a-guidance.html.
Donor management on ITU
• Treatment of infection.
• Line care.
• Airway management.
• Maintain MAP >60mmHg.
• Meticulous ﬂuid balance.
• Most need vasopressor support (e.g. dopamine 9 then noradrenaline).
• Maintain core temp >35*C.
• Common complications:
• d BP.
• Arrhythmias.
• Hypothermia.
• Diabetes insipidus (l diuresis, i Na+); treat with vasopressin.
• Electrolyte abnormalities.
• Acidosis.
• Pulmonary oedema.
• Hypothyroidism (l haemodynamic instability); treat with T3 or T4
infusion).
• Hyperglycaemia (insulin resistance).

Warm and cold ischaemic time
• Warm ischaemic time: period between circulatory arrest and start of
cold storage. WIT is extremely injurious to the kidney.
• Cold ischaemic time: period of cold storage before transplantation.

365

366

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Donation after cardiac death (DCD)
Previously referred to as ‘non-heart-beating’ donors. The number of DCD
donors has increased signiﬁcantly over recent years. DCD involves donors
who are not brain-dead, but in whom treatment is withdrawn, as there is
no prospect of recovery. This usually occurs in an ITU setting but may
also be undertaken in accident and emergency departments. Organs are
harvested at subsequent cardiorespiratory arrest. The time between treatment withdrawal and cardiorespiratory arrest will determine if the organs
are viable for transplantation.
The inevitable delay between cardiac arrest and organ perfusion results
in a longer period of warm ischaemia time (WIT). WIT is extremely harmful to kidneys, so, in some countries, kidneys are allocated locally to prevent an additional lengthy period of cold ischaemia.
Prolonged WIT increases DGF, but graft survival rates appear comparable to DBD if donors are carefully selected. X However, outcomes
for DCD donors using more extended criteria (b p. 368) are uncertain.
DCD kidneys are classiﬁed, according to the Maastricht classiﬁcation:
• Category I: dead on arrival in hospital.
• Category II: unsuccessful resuscitation.
• Category III: expected cardiac arrest.
• Category IV: cardiac arrest in brainstem-dead donor.
• Category V: unexplained cardiac arrest in hospital.
Categories II and III are the most common scenarios. DCD can only occur
in hospitals that have invested in the expertise, resources, and infrastructure necessary to support such a programme.
Between 2011 and 2012, in the UK, there was an 8% increase in the
number of deceased donors to 1,088 (the largest number ever). The
number of DBD donors increased by 2% to 652, while the number of
DCD donors increased by 17% to 436 (see Fig. 5.12).

DCD donors, 1998–2010. Reproduced from UK Blood and Transplant Annual
Report 2012, with permission.

Figs 5.13 and 5.14 show graft survival estimates (and conﬁdence intervals) for 1, 2, 5, and 10 years post-transplant. There has been a signiﬁcant
improvement in 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival over the time periods shown
(P <0.01 in each case).
Note: 1-year patient survival is comparable for DBD and DCD donor
transplants in the most recent time periods.

Extended criteria donors (ECD)
X The use of ECD is increasing rapidly as a means of expanding the
available donor pool. Previously not considered for transplantation, they
now represent 725% of donors (see Fig. 5.15).
Criteria
• Age >60.
• Age 50–59 and ≥2 of the following:
• i BP.
• SCr >133μmol/L (1.5mg/dL).
• Cerebrovascular cause of death.

Contraindications to deceased donation
• Active or untreated malignancy. A history of past treated cancer is
more contentious.
• Primary brain tumours are an exception.
• Active infection, e.g. encephalitis, TB, HSV, CMV, syphilis:
• Donation may be possible if the organism and sensitivities are
known and treatment has been established prior to donation.
• In some cases, HBV, HCV, HIV may be allocated to appropriate
recipients (b pp. 684, 690, 679 respectively).
• Medical comorbidity:
• X This is an increasingly controversial area, as factors, such as age >60,
diabetes mellitus, and i BP, are no longer considered contraindications
in many transplant centres (for ECD, see b p. 368).

Deceased donation: opting in or opting out
Organ donation requires consent of the donor or next of kin. In some
countries, e.g. most of the UK, potential donors may have given consent during their lifetime, so-called ‘opt in’. Such systems often utilize
resources, such as donor cards or donor registries (increasingly online).
Although the next of kin may not have the automatic right to overrule
the previously expressed wishes of a potential donor, it would be usual
practice to take their wishes into account.
In other countries, e.g. France, Spain (and Wales from 2015), potential
donors are presumed to have given consent, unless they previously ‘opt
out’. Advocates of this system point to increased donation rates in these
territories, although critics suggest this is more a function of transplant
coordination systems that are more sophisticated overall.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Recipient characteristics
The median waiting time for a deceased donor kidney is 71,200 days or
3.3 years. This waiting time is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by blood group, with
blood groups AB, A, B, and O having median waiting times of 7600, 7950,
71,300, and 71,400 days, respectively.
The major factors that inﬂuence allocation of a kidney to a potential
recipient’s are:
• Time on the waiting list, with priority to those that have waited the
longest.
• Age: priority to those younger than 18.
• HLA mismatch, with priority to a zero antigen mismatch.
• HLA antibodies, with priority to those with a high PRA or
calculated RF.
• Medical priority, e.g. a patient has limited options for sustainable
dialysis access.
There is a move toward more sophisticated scoring systems that attempt
to improve outcomes by matching donor and recipient more effectively,
particularly in terms of patient and graft survival. Such systems usually
focus on criteria, such as: (i) estimated survival that a recipient of a speciﬁc
donor kidney may expect vs remaining on dialysis; (ii) time already spent
on dialysis; and (iii) more objective measures of donor organ quality.
Donor and recipient should be as closely ‘biologically’ matched as possible; for instance, kidneys from elderly donors do not, on average, last as
long as those from younger donors and may sensitize younger recipients
to subsequent (better matched) grafts.
Speciﬁc recipient issues
• Age:
• The proportion of wait-listed patients aged >50 is increasing.
• This not only reﬂects longer waiting times, but also larger numbers
of more elderly patients being considered for transplantation.
• This mandates a regular (re) assessment of both ﬁtness for, and the
risk:beneﬁt ratio of, transplantation.
• The commonest cause of graft loss beyond age 65 is death with a
functioning transplant. This means that long-term graft outcomes
may be less important, and appropriate attention must be given to
issues, such as quality of life.
• There is usually an attempt to match the age of donor with the
recipient to ensure a suitable ‘nephron dose’.
• Race:
• Ensuring equal access to transplantation is a signiﬁcant challenge
internationally, as is encouraging donation from all ethnic
backgrounds to support HLA matching.
• The proportion of patients waiting for a kidney from black, Asian,
and Hispanic backgrounds is increasing.
• In the UK, 74% of donors are from ethnic minority groups while
such groups represent 78% of the UK ESRD population.
• Median UK waiting times are Caucasian patients 71,100 days; Asian
patients 71,400 days; black patients 71,450 days.

COMPATIBILITY: MATCHING DONOR TO RECIPIENT

• Comorbidity:
• Diabetes is the commonest cause of ESRD amongst those
wait-listed, followed by i BP.
• This has implications for associated CV morbidity. Careful work-up
is essential (b p. 352)
• Size:
• A large recipient ideally requires adequate ‘nephron mass’ to
achieve a satisfactory post-transplant GFR. A kidney from a small
donor (e.g. paediatric) may not achieve this.
• It may be technically difﬁcult to implant a kidney from a large donor
into a small recipient.
• Large recipient polycystic kidneys may limit placement of the new
organ (uni- or bilateral native nephrectomies may be necessary
before activation on the waiting list).

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Live donor transplantation
Introduction
2 Living donor transplantation is the treatment of choice for ESRD.
Living donors enjoy better graft function and patient survival (b
p. 340). They are the commonest donor type in many countries, and numbers have increased signiﬁcantly globally in recent years (now approaching
50% of all renal transplants).
Live donors may be related or unrelated, although there is generally
an established emotional relationship between the pair (e.g. spouse or
close friend). Exchange schemes and protocols to reduce recipient ABO
or HLA antibodies are helping to expand the live donor pool (b p. 444).
Non-directed altruistic (‘Good Samaritan’) donation refers to the allocation of a live donor kidney to a patient on the deceased donor list, or in
the kidney exchange pool (b p. XXX) (with donor/recipient anonymity).
Advantages
• Better graft and patient survival than deceased donor transplantation—
regardless of genetic relationship and HLA mismatch.
• Pre-emptive transplants (i.e. pre-dialysis) have the best outcome of all.
• Time on dialysis is associated with poorer transplant outcomes.
• 735% of live donor transplants in the UK are pre-emptive.
• Live donor transplantation is elective surgery and easier to organize.
• Laparoscopic donor techniques have helped acceptability (b p. 378).
• Closer HLA matching may be possible.
• Live donor transplantation expands the overall donor pool—leaving
deceased donor kidneys for those with no other options.
• There is minimal ischaemic damage to graft (6d DGF).
• Less potent immunosuppression (possibly).
• Psychological beneﬁts (better compliance, sense of well-being, etc.).
Disadvantages
• Perioperative donor mortality is 71 in 3,000 (causes: occult cardiac
disease, venous thromboembolism).
• Major complications occur in 72% (intraoperative bleeding, wound
problems, DVT).
• Minor complications occur in 720%.
• Stress to donor (and family).
• X Later development of donor i BP, proteinuria, or CKD
(mean donor GFR after 25 years is 770% of that prior to donor
nephrectomy).
• Difﬁcult to guarantee ‘freely given’ consent—has the donor been
coerced? Potential donors should be assessed in isolation from
recipients and allowed to withdraw (without explanation) at any stage.

Assessment of a potential live donor
This is subject to several comprehensive guidelines, e.g. M http://www.
bts.org.uk.

LIVE DONOR TRANSPLANTATION

A successful live donor programme requires a multidisciplinary team
approach.
• Willing to donate? Information and discussion are of paramount
importance. This should be delivered through a mixture of culturally
appropriate written and visual material as well as face-to-face
consultations. A dedicated live donor team, separate from the
potential recipient’s nephrologist, would usually undertake this. The
risks of the live donor process, how the pathway works, and the
nature of the necessary investigations should all be clearly explained.
• ABO compatibility (b p. 360).
• HLA typing and donor-speciﬁc HLA antibodies (b pp. 360–3).
The impact of HLA matching is much less powerful in live donor
transplantation: a 1 haplotype mismatched live related graft 1-1-1
(e.g. parent to child) has similar outcomes to a 2-2-2 mismatched live
unrelated graft (e.g. from a spouse)—and, in all cases, the outcomes
are as good as for a 0-0-0 mismatched deceased donor kidney.
However, HLA matching can help to select between multiple potential
donors: 0-0-0 mismatched grafts still have the best outcomes, and
poorly HLA-matched grafts risk the subsequent development of DSA,
with potential implications for subsequent repeat transplantation in
younger patients.
• Medical evaluation: the goals are to protect the health of the donor
and to prevent transmissible disease (malignancy and infection) to the
recipient.
• History, clinical examination.
• BP.
• Urinalysis (at least x2 on separate occasions), MSU, and uPCR.
• U&E, SCr, eGFR.
• FBC, clotting, LFTs, bone 9 Hb electrophoresis (? sickle cell trait).
• Fasting glucose 9 glucose tolerance test (if fasting value 6–7mmol/L,
i BMI, or family history of T2DM).
• PSA (4 > age 60).
• Estimation of GFR (b p. 374).
• ECG 9 ECHO if i BP 9 stress testing if age >60.
• CXR.
• HIV, Hep serology, CMV, EBV, syphilis and HTLV-1 and 2.
• Age appropriate cancer screen.
• Psychosocial evaluation. This is a complex area, and many live
donor programmes will have considerable expertise within their
multidisciplinary team. Many donors ﬁnd donation a positive act,
associated with increased self-esteem. However, this is not universal.
Psychosocial assessment and support may be required (including formal
psychiatric review in some cases). Support may need to continue
post-donation. Formal mental health assessment is recommended for
all non-directed altruistic donors in the UK.
• Donor anatomy:
• Renal USS: to check there are two normal-sized kidneys.
• Isotope renography (e.g. DMSA): for split renal function. If there
is a difference, the kidney with less function would generally be
selected for transplantation.

Transplantation

• Arterial and venous anatomy: CTA is now generally favoured over
the more invasive, but less revealing, angiography (CT also yields
additional anatomical information; e.g. the IVU phase will identify a
duplex ureter). Some centres may prefer MRA.
• How many arteries and veins? Multiple arteries usually require
bench reconstruction prior to transplantation. Will laparoscopic
surgery be possible? The left kidney is generally favoured as the
renal vein is longer.
Informed consent. The donor should meet the donor surgeon.
In the UK, it is a mandatory requirement of the Human Tissue
Authority (HTA) that all potential live donor transplants undergo
evaluation by an ‘independent assessor’. The assessor must be satisﬁed
that adequate information has been provided (and understood), that
consent has been freely given (no coercion or rewards), and that the
relationship between the pair is as described. The transplant must then
proceed within a certain time frame (usually 6 months).
If a donor is unsuitable, it is important that the reasons why are clearly
explained (and that any necessary follow-up is organized).
Donor nephrectomy. For techniques, see b p. 378.
Donors should be seen 4–6 weeks post-surgery and then reviewed
annually (check eGFR, BP, and urinalysis 9 uPCR). This could be
undertaken in primary care (but it is important that outcome data are
collected by the transplant centre).

Renal outcomes
Following the initial decline in GFR (as half the donor’s nephron mass is
removed at the time of surgery), the rate of loss of renal function is no
faster than expected with normal ageing, in fact, residual hyperﬁltration
leads to an increase in GFR to 770% of pre-donation level.
There is a small increased risk of low-grade proteinuria (s to hyperﬁltration in the remaining kidney) and i BP. However, donation increases
the absolute cumulative risk of ESRD by <1%.
There are data that suggest improved life expectancy for individuals who have donated, presumably reﬂecting their evident ﬁtness at
the time of donation and perhaps motivation to stay ﬁt post-donation.
However, this may not continue to hold true as more patients are
accepted to donate and their long-term follow-up improves.

LIVE DONOR TRANSPLANTATION

Assessment of GFR for live donation
In many countries (including the USA), GFR is estimated using creatinine
clearance (CrCl) on a 24h urine collection. eGFR, using equations, such
as MDRD, are not acceptable, as they are not sufﬁciently accurate when
renal function is normal or near normal (b p. 34).
GFR may also be measured using radioisotopes, such as 51Cr-EDTA
(recommended in the UK).
A suitable GFR for donation should be age-adjusted (see Fig. 5.16 and
Table 5.5).

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Potential contraindications to live kidney donation
• Age <18 (except in exceptional circumstances).
• There is no upper age limit, but donors >60 will require particularly
diligent assessment.
• Inadequately controlled i BP (b p. 377).
• CV disease (including strong family history) (b p. 377).
• i BMI (b p. 377).
• Diabetes mellitus or high risk of future diabetes (ﬁrst-degree relative
with T2DM + abnormal glucose tolerance, previous gestational DM).
• Other signiﬁcant comorbidity, e.g. respiratory disease.
• Malignancy (localized skin malignancy is an exception). Ensure breast
and cervical screening has been undertaken.
• Urinary tract infection.
• Structural urinary tract abnormalities.
• Nephrolithiasis.
• Renal disease. Any primary GN or other renal disease.
• Proteinuria >150mg/24h precludes donation.
• Microscopic haematuria: donation may still be possible (b p. 377).
• If family history of renal disease, exclude in the donor, e.g. Alport
syndrome.
• Thromboembolic disease.
• Transmissible infection (HIV, HBV, HCV, TB history, or recent
contact).
• Previous extensive abdominal surgery.
• Smoking and alcohol excess.
• Recreational drug use or dependence on prescribed medication.
• Social issues: what will be the impact on employment, dependants, etc.
• Active mental health issues.

LIVE DONOR TRANSPLANTATION

Common concerns during live donor work-up
• i BP
• Only a relative contraindication.
• i BP precludes donation if:
— Evidence of target organ damage (b p. 462).
— >2 antihypertensives are necessary to maintain BP
<140/90mmHg.
— 10-year CV risk <20% (b p. 470).
• CV disease:
• CV assessment of potential donors is not always straightforward.
As a general rule, there should be a low threshold for screening
potential donors for CV disease.
• Coronary artery disease is the most common concern, but
valvular disease, cardiac dysfunction, and other vascular disease
(e.g. peripheral, carotid) also require consideration.
• Potential donors with exercise capacity >10 METs are at very low
cardiac risk.
• METs are metabolic equivalents—based on the resting oxygen
consumption of a 70kg 40-year-old 4 (3.5mL/kg/min or 1 MET).
They can be calculated from activity scores, derived from
questionnaire responses.
• In the UK, it is suggested that potential donors with an exercise
capacity of <4 METs (activities that require >4 METs include
moderate cycling, skiing, tennis, and jogging) or who have >10%
estimated risk of signiﬁcant coronary disease (b p. 470) should
undergo cardiological assessment (essentially dynamic stress
testing of some type).
• Obesity:
• A risk factor for perioperative complications, such as VTE, wound
infection, chest infection.
• Potential association with subsequent CKD, proteinuria,
and T2DM.
• Potential donors with a BMI >35 should be discouraged, but given
lifestyle advice and, if appropriate, weight loss goals. Moderately
obese patients (BMI 30–35kg/m2) should be counselled carefully
concerning the additional perioperative and long-term risks
and advised to lose weight prior to donation (and maintain this
post-donation).
• Persistent microscopic haematuria:
• A relatively common ﬁnding (75%).
• Requires urological assessment, with urinary tract imaging and
cystoscopy.
• X If urological investigations prove normal, many centres
perform a renal biopsy to exclude signiﬁcant (and potentially
progressive) glomerular disease; for example, IgA nephropathy
would be a contraindication to donation, whereas thin membrane
disease (b p. 568), assuming appropriate assessment and
counselling, might not.

377

378

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Live donor nephrectomy
General issues
The most important early complications are bleeding, venous thromboembolism, renal impairment, chest infection/post-op atelectasis, and inadequate pain relief (see Box 5.3).
Ensure adequate hydration (e.g. IV crystalloid 1L over 6–8h, beginning
pre-op), VTE prophylaxis (LMWH and compression stockings), adequate
analgesia (see Box 5.3), early mobilization, and physiotherapy, as needed.
Live donor transplant recipients are often commenced on ciclosporin or
tacrolimus a few days prior to the date of transplant, allowing therapeutic
plasma levels to be reached and reducing the risk of early rejection.
Open vs laparoscopic nephrectomy
Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy is replacing open nephrectomy as the
procedure of choice for live donor nephrectomy and has helped to increase
donor rates. The kidney is usually removed through a 6cm Pfannenstiel or
a lower midline incision. Open nephrectomy involves a larger, more painful
wound (often requiring rib resection) and a longer recovery time.
Although overall complication rates are similar, laparoscopic nephrectomy is associated with less pain, a smaller wound (and several smaller
scars), a shorter hospital stay, and swifter resumption of normal activities.
Disadvantages: laparoscopic techniques are more difﬁcult to learn;
there is less intraoperative control of bleeding, and warm ischaemic time
is increased by a few minutes over open techniques.
There are several variations: total laparoscopic nephrectomy,
hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALDN) and retroperitoneal
donor nephrectomy (in the latter, the peritoneal cavity is not entered, so
there is less risk of bowel injury and fewer subsequent adhesions).

LIVE DONOR TRANSPLANTATION

Box 5.3 Pain relief in live donors
With post-operative attention often focused on the recipient, pain in
the donor may be overlooked. Live donation is an unselﬁsh act—it is
inexcusable to leave a donor in pain because of insufﬁcient analgesia.
• Consider a fentanyl PCA (to be set up in theatre), e.g. bolus 15
micrograms with a 5min lock-out and background infusion of 15
micrograms/h.
• On the ward:
• Paracetamol 1g qds PO/IV ( if donor is <50kg, IV dose is 15mg/
kg/dose).
• NSAID, e.g. ibuprofen 400mg tds PO (unless patient intolerant/
allergic). Ensure adequate hydration, and monitor renal function.
• PPI, e.g. omeprazole 20mg od PO (to cover NSAID).
• Antiemetic:
• Ondansetron 8mg tds PO/IV (regularly).
• Cyclizine 50mg tds PO/IV prn.
If pain is inadequately controlled, ensure the PCA is set up correctly
and being used appropriately. Then consider increasing bolus and background to 20 micrograms (ensure the patient is alert and respiratory
rate is >12). Review regularly.
Depending on patient progress, the PCA will hopefully only be necessary for 24–48h. However, adequate step-down analgesia, based on
preceding PCA use, is essential.
• If fentanyl use <400 micrograms in previous 24h, prescribe regular
oxycodone 5mg qds as well as prn oxycodone 5–10mg 2-hourly.
• If fentanyl use >400micrograms in previous 24h, prescribe regular
oxycodone 10mg qds and prn oxycodone 5–10mg 2-hourly.
Assess pain every 2h after step-down. If uncontrolled, consider
restarting PCA.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Immunosuppression: overview
Introduction
Successful transplantation between non-identical individuals became possible with the combined used of corticosteroids and azathioprine in the
1960s. However, severe rejection, often with graft loss, remained common. Solid organ transplantation was transformed by the introduction of
ciclosporin in the 1980s, with a signiﬁcant reduction in acute rejection
rates and improved long-term graft outcomes.
The number of immune suppressive agents has grown considerably over
the last two decades. Randomized trials have attempted to deﬁne the ideal
cocktail of drugs, but have generally been pharmaceutical company-driven,
too short-term (often leading to the use of acute rejection, rather than
graft outcomes as the primary endpoint), and too small to convincingly
demonstrate any differences.
This means there is no universal regimen—each transplant centre will
develop its own protocol, based on their interpretation of the available
evidence, their local experience, and their local population.
General principles
• To match the amount of immune suppression with the perceived
degree of immunological risk.
• To use higher doses in the early part of transplantation when the
risk of rejection is highest (induction), with gradual reduction, even
withdrawal, of some agents over time (maintenance).
• To try to tailor immune suppression to the individual where possible.
• The use of ciclosporin with corticosteroids and azathioprine became
known as triple therapy. Similar such regimens are still the cornerstone
of many protocols—modern triple therapy often comprises tacrolimus,
corticosteroids, and MMF.
• Acute rejection is treated with an (immediate) escalation in immune
suppression, often with a subsequent increase in maintenance therapy.
• Each immunosuppressive agent has a particular side effect proﬁle.
However, the entire group is associated with an increased risk of
infection (bacterial, viral, and fungal) and malignancy.
• 2 The more potent the immune suppression, the less chance of
rejection and the greater chance of these side effects.
• As acute rejection rates have fallen and graft outcomes improved,
both the short-term ( infection) and long-term ( CV disease,
malignancy, nephrotoxicity) side effects of immune suppression have
become increasingly familiar.
• Immune suppression is only effective if taken consistently and as
prescribed. The stakes are high in non-compliant patients, but such
non-adherence remains surprisingly common. It should be recognized
that regimens are often burdensome, involving multiple tablets, with
multiple side effects, taken at multiple times of day.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: OVERVIEW

Key questions to ask of a transplant centre’s
immune suppression protocols
• Is immune suppression the same for each patient or modiﬁed,
according to perceived immunological risk (see Box 5.4)?
• What antibody (‘biological’ agent), if any, is used at induction?
• If a depleting antibody is used, what are the protocols surrounding
its safe administration?
• Is maintenance immune suppression based on ciclosporin or
tacrolimus? What are the desired therapeutic ranges of these agents
at each stage post-transplantation?
• Does maintenance immunosuppression include azathioprine
or MMF?
• Are corticosteroids used from the outset? Under what
circumstances are they withdrawn?
• What are the local policies concerning prophylaxis against infections,
such as CMV and TB?
• What clinical trials are being undertaken at the centre? What
protocols apply to these patients?
• What are the protocols for ABO- or HLA-incompatible
transplantation if they are performed?
• How is T cell-mediated rejection treated?
• How is acute antibody-mediated rejection treated?

Box 5.4 Estimating immunological risk
X Many transplant centres aim to tailor immune suppression according
to a stratiﬁcation of immunological risk. Criteria vary but, as an example:
• Low immunological risk:
• Recipients without HLA antibodies, or
• Recipients receiving a ﬁrst transplant kidney from a HLA-identical
sibling.
• Standard immunological risk:
• Recipients with HLA antibodies.
• Any of the following groups, regardless of presence or absence of
HLA antibodies:
• Husband to wife, or child to mother.
• Second or subsequent kidney transplant.
• Black recipient.
• High immunological risk:
• Recipients who are FC-XM-negative but who have a current, or
historic, antibody directed against the transplant organ (usually
arises in a live donor transplant context, as such organs would
not be allocated to a recipient via deceased donor schemes).
• HLA-incompatible transplants require individualized
immunosuppression regimens.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Immunosuppression: induction
Introduction
Induction therapy is an initial period of intense immune suppression, given
at the time of transplantation, to reduce the incidence of early acute rejection. It has two components:
• Higher initial doses of agents that will subsequently be used for
maintenance, e.g. pulsed IV and high-dose oral corticosteroids and
ciclosporin or tacrolimus, with higher early target therapeutic levels.
• Antibody induction with a ‘biological’ agent; this will be with either a
depleting or non-depleting antibody.
• Depleting antibodies: ATG, OKT3, alemtuzumab.
• Non-depleting antibodies: basiliximab.
• Antibody induction is used for >80% of transplants. In broad terms,
depleting antibodies are favoured in the USA, whilst non-depleting
antibodies are more widely used in the UK and Europe.
• X While the evidence that antibody induction reduces acute rejection
is good (depleting antibody > non-depleting antibody), the effects on
long-term graft outcome are less clear.
• Other potential advantages (depleting antibody > non-depleting
antibody): lower baseline maintenance immune suppression (esp.
steroids), allows gradual introduction of CNI to assist recovery from
DGF, facilitates higher immunological risk transplants (b p. 381).
• Potential disadvantages (depleting antibody >> non-depleting
antibody): higher infection rates, greater long-term risk of malignancy.

Non-depleting antibodies
Basiliximab
• A monoclonal antibody directed against CD25, a component of the
IL-2 receptor on activated T cells. Binding prevents IL-2-induced T cell
proliferation and clonal expansion.
• Basiliximab is a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody that does
not evoke an immune response. It consequently has a long half-life.
• Used for transplant induction only, not the treatment of rejection
(there are many other T cell mitogens besides IL-2, it is ineffective in
this context).
• Demonstrably reduces acute rejection in the ﬁrst year post-transplant
(733%).
• Basiliximab:
• 20 mg IVI on day 0 and day 4.
• The ﬁrst infusion is usually started immediately pre-theatre.
• SE: surprisingly few. Infusion reactions are rare. Does not appear to
signiﬁcantly increase the risk of infection or malignancy.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: INDUCTION

Depleting antibodies
Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)
• Polyclonal T cell-depleting antibodies are produced by immunizing
animals with human thymic lymphocytes.
• Several are available, e.g. Thymoglobulin® (produced in rabbits).
• Among the polyclonal antibodies are antibodies speciﬁc for
components of the TCR (CD3, CD4, CD8) and cytokine receptors
(including CD25) as well as adhesion molecules.
• Numerous effects on T cells: cytokine release, d proliferation, d
adherence, and i clearance (l lysis or reticuloendothelial uptake).
•  T cell depletion may persist for months (even years).
• They also have anti-B cell effects (d T cell help).
• SE:
• 3 Anaphylaxis.
• Cytokine release syndrome (fever, rigors, pruritus, erythema,
dyspnoea, i HR, i /d BP). Generally limited to 1st or 2nd dose.
• Serum sickness (s to anti-rabbit antibodies and immune complex
formation) after 77 days’ treatment. Features: fever, rash, arthralgia,
myalgia. Requires treatment cessation.
• d WCC, d Plt.
• i infections (PCP, adenovirus, invasive fungal infections, CMV,
toxoplasma, HSV, VZV are all concerns during this therapy).
• i PTLD (risk x 2) (b p. 441).
• Used for both induction therapy and treatment of rejection (b p. 408).
• Anti-rabbit antibodies may develop and impair efﬁcacy (especially with
repeat courses).
Alemtuzumab
• Developed in the Cambridge Pathology Laboratories (hence
Campath®). Licensed for the treatment of CLL but used extensively in
transplantation.
• It is a humanized anti-CD52 antibody: CD52 is a highly expressed
glycoprotein antigen on the surface of T and B cells (as well as
thymocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and NK cells).
• Binding does not cause cell activation, instead cells are rapidly cleared
from the circulation.
• Profound lymphopenia persists for 6 months (B cells reconstitute
before T cells).
• Dose: 2 x 30mg doses administered by SC injection (can be IV)
24h apart (day 0 and day 1 post-transplant). Initial dose generally
administered intraoperatively prior to organ reperfusion (if the patient
is age >60, some centres administer only one dose).
• Infusion reactions (SC < IV) are less severe than other depleting
antibodies (as not associated with cytokine release) but still occur.
• Premedication and prophylaxis as for thymoglobulin in Box 5.5.
• SE: d Hb, d Plt ( weeks 2–4), d WCC ( weeks 4–8), i infection;
autoimmune phenomena, such as ITP and haemolytic anaemia, may be
seen as lymphocytes reconstitute.
•  Beware late rejection, as T cells reconstitute at 76 months.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

• There are no randomized studies that directly compare against other
agents for induction. It had been used to treat acute rejection, but
experience and evidence are currently lacking.

Box 5.5 Administration of thymoglobulin
Dose
1.5mg/kg (ideal body weight), rounded up to nearest 25mg in 500mL
normal saline or 5% glucose.
Premedication
Chlorphenamine 10mg IV and hydrocortisone 100mg IV 1h before each
infusion. Antipyretic agents (e.g. paracetamol) may also increase tolerability.
If reactions occur, treat with additional steroid, antihistamine, nebulized salbutamol, and IV hydration.
Administration
•  ATG should be given via a central line.
• Administration through a 0.22 micron in-line ﬁlter is recommended.
• Administer ﬁrst dose at 10mL/h for the ﬁrst hour.
• If no adverse effects, i infusion rate so that total duration is ≥6h.
• Subsequent infusions should be administered over ≥6h.
• Treatment with ATG should not usually exceed 14 days.
• Vials batch numbers should be recorded (it is a blood product).
Monitoring
CD3 monitoring
• X Not universally undertaken (or accepted).
• CD3 count should be measured before the ﬁrst dose as a reference.
• Daily CD3 counts thereafter. Adjust daily doses according to result
(reference range 1–30 cells/μL). Guide (local protocols will vary):
• <10 cells/μL: no dose.
• 10–20 cells/μL: half dose.
• >20 cells/μL: full dose.
Other monitoring
• Monitor general appearance, BP, HR, and temp every 15min during
initial hour of ﬁrst infusion. Hourly monitoring for remainder of ﬁrst
and subsequent infusions.
• Check infusion rate regularly.
• Daily FBC.
Other considerations
Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections
• Oral candidiasis: nystatin 1mL qds. Continue 1 month after course.
• CMV (b p. 432), PCP (b p. 428), and TB prophylaxis (b p. 395).
Other immunosuppressive therapy
Stop MMF or azathioprine during therapy to reduce neutropenia risk.
Restart 2–3 days before the end of the course.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: INDUCTION

OKT3
• OKT3 is a mouse mAb speciﬁc for CD3 (a component of the TCR on
all T cells).
• On binding, CD3 +ve cells release cytokines, internalize the CD3-TCR
complex, and are rapidly cleared from the circulation.
• T cell rebound is more rapid than for ATG.
• Premedication and prophylaxis as for thymoglobulin, except a
larger dose of corticosteroid is often given, e.g. 250–500mg IV
methylprednisolone.
• Given as a 5mg IV bolus (can be administered peripherally).
• Anaphylaxis is more common and cytokine release syndromes almost
universal and more severe (particularly on repeat dosing).
• These serious (sometimes very serious: non-cardiogenic pulmonary
oedema, aseptic meningitis, and encephalopathy) side effects mean
that OKT3 is now generally reserved for the treatment of refractory
rejection, rather than for induction therapy.
•  Do not administer to volume-overloaded patients (diurese or
ultraﬁltrate the patient, as necessary, ﬁrst).
• i infection and PTLD risk, as for other depleting agents.
• A 10-day course is usual. CD3 monitoring can be undertaken, as for
thymoglobulin.
• Neutralizing antibodies may limit efﬁcacy.
Rituximab
• A chimeric (mouse/human) mAb directed against CD20
(expressed on B cells but not plasma cells—so it rarely causes
hypogammaglobulinaemia).
• Binding induces apoptosis and complement-dependent cytotoxicity.
• Causes rapid and sustained depletion (6–9 months) of both circulating
and tissue-based B lymphocytes.
• Repeat administration of rituximab is sometimes based on
measurement of circulating CD19 +ve B cells.
• Main role (in transplantation), to date, has been to prevent resynthesis
of HLA or ABO antibodies, following plasma exchange in ABO- or
HLA-incompatible transplants (see b p. 444).
• Premedication and prophylaxis, as for thymoglobulin.
• Infusion reactions and cytokine release syndrome are well recognized.
• A single dose of 375mg/m2 is given IV 2–4 weeks prior to
transplantation (50–400mg/h).
•  Rituximab bound to B lymphocytes may lead to a false positive B
cell cross-match.
• Role as induction therapy or in the treatment of antibody-mediated
rejection remains to be deﬁned.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Immunosuppression: maintenance
Introduction
Maintenance immune suppression is given for the lifetime of the graft to
prevent rejection. These agents are administered orally, and regimens usually involve several agents. Standard ‘triple therapy’ consists of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), an antimetabolite and corticosteroids.

Calcineurin inhibitors: ciclosporin, tacrolimus
• The cornerstone of maintenance therapy over the last few decades.
• Ciclosporin (CIC) is a lipid-soluble peptide, derived from the fungus
Tolyplacadium inﬂatum.
• Tacrolimus (TAC, previously known as FK506) is a macrolide
antibiotic, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces tsukubaensis.
• Both disrupt T cell signal 1 through binding intracytosolic
immunophylins (cyclophylin or FKBP12). These complexes then bind
calcineurin (a protein phosphatase), preventing its interaction with
substrates, such as NFAT, and reducing the transcription of T cell
activation genes (including IL-2 and IL-2R).
• Therapeutic drug monitoring is mandatory:
• Both have a narrow therapeutic index: too little l inadequate
immune suppression; too much l side effects ( particularly
nephrotoxicity).
• There is also signiﬁcant interpatient variation in drug metabolism.
• Drug concentrations are measured in whole blood, as much is red
blood cell or plasma protein-bound.
• 12h ‘trough’ levels (C0) are generally measured.
• The use of TAC is growing at the expense of CIC:
• Head-to-head comparisons have generally been confounded by
inadequate power and variable dosing regimens.
• However, there has been a signiﬁcant d in acute rejection in
many studies (including d steroid-resistant rejection), and a large
meta-analysis has suggested d early graft loss.
Ciclosporin
• Neoral®, a microemulsion preparation, has been the main CIC
formulation over recent years, but several generic preparations are
now available.
•  There are important differences in bioavailability between
formulations, so it is crucial that the patient is consistently prescribed
the same brand.
• Dose: 7mg/kg in two divided doses (PO), with subsequent adjustment,
according to levels.
• Target ranges (12-hour trough).  Depends on local practice,
immunological risk, and evidence of nephrotoxicity. For guidance:
• 0–6 months: 200–250ng/mL.
• 6–12 months: 150–200ng/mL.
• >12 months: 75–150ng/mL.
• X There has been much interest in using 2h post-dose levels (C2) for
therapeutic monitoring, as these provide a better estimate of drug

IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: MAINTENANCE

exposure (and have been associated with d acute rejection in some
studies). However, perhaps because it is a less practical, it has not
been widely adopted.
• CIC is metabolized in the GI tract and liver by the cytochrome P450
system (CYP3A4)—with implications for drug interactions (see
Table 5.6, Box 5.6).
• If required IV, administer 1/3 of the oral dose.
Tacrolimus
• Prograf® has been the main formulation over recent years. Advagraf® is
a once-daily formulation.
•  Several generic preparations are now available, with potentially
signiﬁcant differences in bioavailability between brands.
• Dose: 0.1mg/kg in two divided doses (or as a single dose for once-daily
formulations), with subsequent adjustment, according to level.
• Typical target ranges (12-hour trough).  Depends on immunological
risk and evidence of nephrotoxicity. Check local protocols:
• Low immunological risk: trough level 3–7 micrograms/L.
• Standard immunological risk: trough level 10–12 micrograms/L for
ﬁrst 2 months, then 8–10 micrograms/L.
• High immunological risk: trough level 10–12 micrograms/L for ﬁrst
2 months, then 8–10 micrograms/L.
• C0 (trough) levels correlate well with drug exposure (a signiﬁcant
advantage over CIC).
• Metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) system—with
implications for drug interactions (see Table 5.6, Box 5.6).
• If required IV, the dose is 0.03–0.05mg/kg as an infusion over 24h.

CNI side effects
• Nephrotoxicity: initially reversible renal vasoconstriction ld
GFR, but irreversible interstitial ﬁbrosis supervenes. Some degree
is common on transplant biopsies (and a particular problem in
recipients of other solid organ transplants, with 75% l ESRD after
10 years).
• i BP.
• Headache (rarely, more severe neuropsychiatric issues).
• Tremor.
• Liver dysfunction.
• Post-transplant DM—NODAT (esp. TAC) (b p. 424).
• May potentiate DGF.
• i K+ (similar to a type IV RTA) (b p. 825).
• i urate (+ gout),d Mg2+, d PO4.
• Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) (b p. 412).
• Cosmetic: hirsutism (esp. dark-haired, darker-skinned patients), gum
hypertrophy (CIC > TAC), hair loss (TAC > CIC).
• Dyslipidaemia (CIC > TAC).
• Diarrhoea (TAC > CIC).
 Severe diarrhoea may signiﬁcantly i TAC levels (enterocytes
that normally secrete TAC into the gut lumen via P-glycoprotein are
destroyed, causing less TAC elimination via this route).

Box 5.6 CNI drug interactions
• Statin levels are signiﬁcantly increased by CNIs (CIC > TAC).
• May li CK and rhabdomyolysis.
• Statins should be introduced at low dose and titrated cautiously.
• The co-prescription of simvastatin and CIC is contraindicated by
the MHRA in the UK.
• CIC inhibits the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, meaning that
higher MMF doses are required in recipients treated with CIC.
• These drugs increase the nephrotoxicity of CNIs:
• NSAIDs.
• Aminoglycosides.
• Amphotericin.
• These drugs increase the incidence of i K+:
• ACE-I/ARB.
• K+-sparing diuretics.

Mycophenolic acid
• Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and mycophenolate sodium (MPS)
are the ester and sodium salt pro-drugs of the active compound
mycophenolic acid (MPA).
• MPA is a reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
(IMPDH), a critical enzyme for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis.
• Lymphocytes are dependent on the de novo pathway (other cell types
have a salvage pathway), so inhibition ld proliferation of activated
T and B lymphocytes.
• MMF has been shown to d acute rejection, more than azathioprine,
as part of triple therapy with CIC. Limited evidence for additional
beneﬁt in TAC-based regimens. However, there has been a massive
shift toward MMF, such that it is now the staple at most centres. Note
that AZA may remain a good option in TAC-treated patients with
MMF-related GI side effects.
• SE: gastrointestinal side effects can be problematic. Diarrhoea in
730%, gastritis in 720%, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia. Bone
marrow suppression is relatively common. Infective side effects (e.g.
CMV) are more common than with AZA.
• Relatively few important drug interactions. CIC d enterohepatic
recirculation of MPA, so higher doses of MMF are required than
with TAC.
• MPA sodium is available as an enteric-coated, slow-release
formulation, designed to d GI side effects (Myfortic®). This is not
demonstrably the case in practice, although some patients seem to
beneﬁt from a change in tablet.
• Initial dose: MMF 1g bd (or 500mg qds)—some centres use 1.5g bd for
black recipients; MPA 720mg bd. Subsequent dosing will depend on
local protocols, CNI levels, and side effects (including bone marrow
tolerability).
• X There is very marked interpatient variability in plasma MPA levels.
Therapeutic monitoring of MPA levels is available, but its role has not

Transplantation

yet been established. May be measured in those with severe GI side
effects.

Azathioprine
• Metabolized to a purine analogue (6-thioguanine), which competitively
inhibits purine synthesis (for RNA and DNA). This inhibits all cell
replication, including d T cell proliferation.
• An old friend: in use in transplantation for >40 years.
• Dose: usual starting dose is 1.5–2mg/kg once daily. Reduce if WCC
<4.0 x 109/L and stop if <2.0 x 109/L.
• SE: myelosuppression, hepatitis, cholestasis.
• Interactions:  allopurinol should be used with great caution with
azathioprine, as AZA is also metabolized by xanthine oxidase (l
potentiates bone marrow toxicity). Consider transfer to MMF.
• Patients with an inherited deﬁciency of the enzyme thiopurine
methytransferase (TPMT) metabolize AZA slowly, resulting in drug
accumulation (and bone marrow suppression). If necessary, patients
can be screened for TPMT levels (and the presence of the genetic
abnormality).

Sirolimus (rapamycin)
• Derived from a macrolide antibiotic identiﬁed on Rapa Nui (Easter
Island).
• Inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory
kinase in cell division.
• Like TAC, it binds FKBP12, but the resulting complex binds and inhibits
mTOR ld lymphocyte proliferation in response to cytokines.
• A long half-life allows once-daily dosing.
• Dose: typical loading dose of 6mg for two doses, followed by
maintenance dose of 2–4mg.
• Trough C0 levels correlate well with overall drug exposure. Aim level
5–10ng/mL.
• SE: antiproliferative and anti-angiogenic ( l impaired wound healing and
lymphocele formation). Pneumonitis (can be severe: cough, breathlessness,
inﬁltrates on CXR/CT. Exclude infection. Resolves on withdrawal.). Also
mouth ulcers, i lipids, bone marrow suppression, TMA, rashes. Appears
to prolong DGF (d tubular regeneration). i proteinuria.
•  Intolerance is very common. Many side effects are more
pronounced in those not on steroids.
• Because of its propensity to impair healing, it is often introduced after
3 months in selected patients.
• Interactions: potentiates CIC nephrotoxicity.
• An additional mTOR inhibitor everolimus is available in some
countries.
• May have a role when there is progressive loss of GFR from
non-immune mechanisms (l IF/TA); for example, if CNI
nephrotoxicity is problematic >6 months post-transplant (b p. 416).
• X Associated with less malignancy. Not a strong evidence base but
studies ongoing (particularly in the context of skin cancer) (b p. 440).

IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: MAINTENANCE

Corticosteroids
• d cytokine gene transcription ld cytokine-regulated lymphocyte
signalling, d T cell activation (via d NF-κB), and d chemokine-driven
lymphocyte homing to areas of inﬂammation.
• Familiar toxicity: insomnia, weight gain, i BP, i CV risk, impaired
glucose tolerance and i NODAT (b p. 424), dyslipidaemia, mood
disturbance, poor wound healing, osteoporosis.
• Dose: huge centre variation. Typical: pulsed steroids at the time of
transplantation, followed by 20mg prednisolone orally for at least 4
weeks, then phased reduction to maintenance 5mg.

Steroid withdrawal
• The problems associated with steroid use have made regimens
involving their withdrawal popular, particularly in the USA.
• However, RCTs involving withdrawal at 3–4 months have shown
signiﬁcantly i rejection (albeit with CIC-based regimens).
• Experience with TAC- and MMF-based regimens is more positive.
• However, the beneﬁts of late steroid withdrawal from a maintenance
dose are likely to be quite marginal. What are you trying to achieve
in this situation? This risk/beneﬁt ratio needs careful explanation to
the patient.
• Early withdrawal (e.g. ﬁrst week) or total avoidance is increasingly
popular with antibody induction and TAC-/MMF-based regimens.

Newer immune suppressants
Belatacept
• A fusion protein comprising an immunoglobulin domain and modiﬁed
CTLA4 (a T cell molecule, which forms part of the co-stimulatory
signals required for T cell activation).
• It is designed to strongly bind the APC surface co-stimulatory ligands
CD80 and CD86.
• Must be given IV every 4–6 weeks.
• Has been used in early studies to allow CNI avoidance.
• In addition, experimental studies have suggested that the interruption
of co-stimulatory signals could lead to donor-speciﬁc graft tolerance.
Eculizumab
• A humanized monoclonal antibody that targets complement protein
C5, inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b 6 preventing formation of
the membrane attack complex (MAC).
• It has been primarily used to treat atypical HUS and
antibody-mediated rejection (AMR).
• It may have a prophylactic role in transplants at high risk for these
conditions.
• All patients should receive vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis
prior to receiving eculizumab.
• Clinical trials, predominantly in antibody-incompatible renal
transplantation, are ongoing to determine the optimal use.
• It is eye-wateringly expensive.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Perioperative care
Introduction
Patients listed for transplantation will have undergone comprehensive
prior evaluation and have been deemed suitable (b p. 350). However,
circumstances may have changed physically, psychologically, or socially and
require brief reassessment to ensure the recipient is ﬁt to proceed with
urgent surgery.
The same is true of live donor, but this is elective surgery without the
time pressure of attempting to minimize CIT.
Transplantation is major surgery, and a full general history and examination are required. Additional useful information may be gained from the
full case notes (which may need to be couriered from another site, if not
available electronically). In particular, you need to establish the following.
Is the patient ﬁt for major vascular surgery today?
• Is the CV work-up complete, up to date, and satisfactory?
• Are there any new cardiorespiratory symptoms (or signs) which
warrant further assessment?
• Any recent or present intercurrent illness?
• Are the vascular history and exam satisfactory? Document femoral
and more distal pulses; look for signs of ischaemia, and ask about
claudication.
Is the patient appropriate for immune suppression?
• Any recent or active infections?
• Any history of malignant disease and treatment?
• Any concerning symptoms or signs under, or requiring, assessment,
e.g. unexplained weight loss, new or disproportionate anaemia, change
in bowel habit?
What are the likely requirements for RRT perioperatively?
• Is the patient pre-emptive, HD or PD?
• What is the K+? (2 urgently required)
• Any signs of ﬂuid overload?
• Current weight vs target weight?
• When did they last dialyse?
• What is the current dialysis access, and how has it been functioning?
• Is DGF anticipated (e.g. DCD, ECD, long CIT, AKI at retrieval)?
What are the factors that need extra consideration for this patient?
• What is the underlying renal disease and residual urine output?
• Any comorbid disease that increases operative risk 9 requires speciﬁc
perioperative management, e.g. diabetes, i BP, airways disease?
• History of difﬁcult vascular access? Will central venous access be
possible?
• Previous major abdominal surgery?
• Previous urological surgery? Anticipated bladder or bladder outﬂow
dysfunction?
• What is the bleeding risk? Antiplatelets or anticoagulation?

PERIOPERATIVE CARE

• What is the immunological history? Previous biological therapy (ATG,
OKT3, alemtuzumab)?
• Current or historical HLA antibodies/PRA, previous transplants, recent
potential sensitizing events (esp. blood transfusion)?
Investigations
• All patients should have their donor-speciﬁc cross-matched bloods
sent urgently to tissue typing, as this is a rate-limiting step.
• In selected patients (esp. with no historical antibodies or recent sensitizing
events), a ‘virtual cross-match’ (see b p. 364) may be permitted.
• FBC, clotting, and G&S (9 cross-matched blood).
• U&E, Ca2+, PO4, LFT, glucose, CRP.
• ECG—compare to previous.
• CXR—if signiﬁcant cardiorespiratory disease or symptoms/signs.
• MSU—unless anuric.
• HIV, HBV, HCV—screened 3-monthly in HD patients but may not
have been performed recently in others.
• CMV, EBV, toxoplasma, VZV, and syphilis serology. These will have
been performed during work-up. They only need repeating if IgG
previously negative.
• Pregnancy test, if relevant. Although pregnancy is rare in advanced
CKD/dialysis patients, it is a possibility and generally considered a
contra-indication to transplantation. A urinary pregnancy test is reliable
if the patient passes urine, serum beta-HCG if not.
Preoperative RRT
• It is important to ensure that patients are safe for the ﬂuid loading,
tissue injury, and transfusion (li K+) that may occur during a long
transplant operation.
• However, dialysis may delay the operation, potentially i DGF
(especially if excess UF is performed), and i bleeding if heparin is used.
Dialysis is advisable if:
• K+≥5.5mmol/L.
• Signs of ﬂuid overload (pulmonary oedema > peripheral oedema).
• A long delay is anticipated before the organ arrives.
A suitable strategy would be a short session (2–3 hours is adequate for K+
removal), minimal or zero heparin, and the minimum necessary UF (often
leaving the patient 71kg above their target weight).
Pre-dialysis patients
It is unusual for these patients to require HD pre-op. Minor electrolyte/
ﬂuid disturbances may be managed conservatively, with blood sugar control, isotonic sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, etc., as appropriate.
If there is no pre-existing vascular access, the beneﬁts of dialysis catheter insertion need to be weighed against the risks of time delay, DVT
(femoral), pneumothorax (internal jugular), etc.
If DGF is anticipated, ask the anaesthetist to site an internal jugular dialysis catheter intraoperatively.
PD patients
Similar considerations as for pre-dialysis patients tend to apply.
Additionally, rapid exchanges can be used preoperatively. PD may be used

393

394

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

post-operatively if the peritoneum has not been breached (talk to the
operating surgeon).
Writing the drug chart
It is good practice for transplant units to have their own clear guidelines
for perioperative transplant prescribing, including sample drug charts for
the immunosuppression protocols used. The general principles include:
Diabetes medications
• Stop all regular medications, including oral hypoglycaemics and SC
insulin. Commence an IV short-acting insulin ‘sliding scale’ unless
diet-controlled only.
• Regular medications will need careful retitration post-operatively once
eating normally—requirements may have changed due to improved
renal function.
Antihypertensives
• Fluid shifts, general anaesthesia, and opiate analgesia can all contribute
to d BP post-op.
• i BP is preferred to d BP post-op, as autoregulation is impaired and
graft perfusion is 6 more BP-dependent. All antihypertensives are
generally stopped preoperatively.  Exceptions are beta-blockers
(reﬂex tachycardia/myocardial ischaemia) and other drugs used as
anti-anginals or anti-arrhythmic, e.g. diltiazem, verapamil.
Antiplatelets and anticoagulants
• The antiplatelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel last at least 7 days.
• Monotherapy is not considered a contraindication to transplantation,
and many routinely initiate low-dose aspirin as prophylaxis against graft
thrombosis.
• Dual antiplatelet therapy is generally considered a contraindication. As
such, patients should not be transplant-listed until they have reverted
to monotherapy (e.g. after 6–12 months for a drug-eluting stent).
• Warfarin:
• The INR should be corrected to at least <1.5 prior to surgery
(discuss with your surgeon).
• For live donor recipients, this can be achieved by omitting it from
5 days pre-op.
• The decision to admit for therapeutic IV heparin infusion pre-op
depends on the indication (absolute, e.g. metallic MVR, recurrent
VTE vs relative, e.g. AF).
• Reversal depends on the time available. If >6h, give 2mg vitamin K
IV, and recheck in 4h.
• If surgery is imminent, reversal can reliably be achieved with
concentrated vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (e.g. Beriplex®
20–50IU/kg, depending on INR; discuss with haematology) or FFP
15mL/kg. You should not need to recheck INR prior to proceeding.
 Effects only last 74–6h though.
• The effect of warfarin can be prolonged—ensure adequate vitamin
K loading, and recheck INR post-op, and then 12-hourly for 48h.

PERIOPERATIVE CARE

CKD-related drugs
Stop:
• Phosphate binders.
• Vitamin D analogues, e.g. alfacalcidol (unless previous
parathyroidectomy).
• Cinacalcet. Rebound hypercalcaemia can occur, so monitor closely.
• Iron.
• ESA—often stopped. Should continue if DGF to reduce the potential
need for transfusion.
Immunosuppression
• Prescribe accurately, according to local protocols.
• Induction agents are prescribed on the ‘stat’ side and not given until
the cross-match is conﬁrmed negative.
• Ensure the anaesthetist is aware of intraoperative drugs, e.g.
methylprednisolone.
VTE prophylaxis
• VTE risks are present as with any major surgery.
• Use anti-embolism stockings (unless contraindication).
• Consider SC heparin or LMWH prophylaxis (discuss with your
surgeon).
GI prophylaxis
• If on H2 antagonist or PPI, then continue.
• If on neither, start ranitidine 150mg PO bd until steroids are weaned.
Anti-infective prophylaxis
• Infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant
recipients, especially in the ﬁrst 6 months.
• PCP: co-trimoxazole 480mg od (also covers UTI, toxoplasma).
Alternatives include dapsone 50–100mg od or monthly
pentamidine nebs.
• Oropharyngeal candidiasis: nystatin 1mL PO qds or amphotericin
lozenges.
• CMV: valganciclovir (unless CMV D–/R–), dose according to GFR (see
b p. 432)
• TB: local guidelines vary.
• Prophylaxis is essentially treatment of potential latent TB with
isoniazid 300mg od (+ pyridoxine 25mg od to prevent neuropathy).
• Indicated where the TB risk is deemed greater than the risk of
severe isoniazid toxicity, e.g. hepatitis (278/100,000).
• Risk factors include prior infection without evidence of cure, ethnic
origin, or close contacts affected.
• General surgical prophylaxis is often given at induction, e.g. cefuroxime
1.5g IV and/or amikacin 500mg IV. For DD transplant, further regular
prophylaxis may be continued until culture of the graft transport
medium is available.
Analgesia
• Give paracetamol 1g qds regularly PO/PR/IV unless contraindicated
(reduce IV dose if <50kg).

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

• Patients will require opiate/opioid analgesia initially for comfort and to
help them take deep breaths and cough.
• Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is preferred immediately post-op.
• Morphine (1mg bolus, 5min lock-out) is an option, but its
metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide is active and renally excreted.
• Fentanyl (10–15 micrograms bolus, 5min lock-out) does not
accumulate. It has a shorter half-life so is more patient-responsive.
• Once patients are ready for oral analgesia, a moderately strong
opioid can be used, e.g. oxycodone 2.5–5mg qds or tramadol
50–100mg qds.
•  Do not forget to prescribe laxatives in conjunction with opiate
analgesia.

Post-operative assessment
It is good practice for the patient to have a detailed clinical assessment in
recovery prior to transfer back to the ward to ensure they have recovered
safely from anaesthesia, are haemodynamically stable, have appropriate
ﬂuids and analgesia, and show no signs of haemorrhage or graft thrombosis necessitating immediate re-exploration.
• Talk to the surgeon—the op note does not always tell the full story!
• Read the op note thoroughly—any complications? Special instructions?
• Examine the anaesthetic chart—stable haemodynamics? (look for
vasopressor administration, e.g. metaraminol/ephedrine, and boluses of
furosemide).
• What was the ﬂuid balance? Patients can be very ﬂuid-loaded. Was
there immediate urine output? Estimated blood loss?
• Examine the drug chart—was all induction immunosuppression given
as planned?
• Careful clinical examination—ideally, the patient should be:
• Alert, orientated, and comfortable. Able to cough.
• Well perfused—warm peripherally. Normal lactate.
• Haemodynamically stable—not tachycardic, good BP (MAP
>80mmHg).
• On no, or minimal, supplemental O2, with good air entry to the
lung bases.
• Passing urine—unless DGF is anticipated.
• Additionally examine:
• Drain outputs and contents.
• Distal lower limb pulses—compare to pre-op.
• Abdomen (some post-op tenderness to be expected—but is it
proportionate?).
• Check that full post-op bloods have been sent, particularly Hb and K+.
• Review the CXR: CVC position? Pneumothorax? Pulmonary oedema?
• 2 Doppler USS—this should ideally be performed in recovery. It helps
to exclude an immediate technical complication. Additionally, baseline
perfusion, resistive indices, and diastolic ﬂow patterns are very helpful
for future comparative scans.

PERIOPERATIVE CARE

Post-operative care
Attention to detail is key. Always consider: what am I expecting from this
graft, in this patient, at this time? Any deviations require urgent assessment, investigation, and intervention.
Monitoring
• HR, BP, RR, O2 saturation hourly for at least 24h, then 4h.
• Accurate ﬂuid balance charts, including hourly urine and drain outputs
for at least 48h, then 4h.
• Daily weights.
• Bloods:
• FBC and U&E 6-hourly for 24h. Expect a modest fall in Hb (blood
loss/haemodilution).
• Daily FBC, U&E, CRP, glucose (bone and liver proﬁle may be
3x/weekly).
• 2 Trough CNI levels: 3x/weekly, starting day 3 (unless live donor
with pre-loading).
Managing ﬂuid balance
There is a broad spectrum of outcomes from the graft immediately
post-transplant—from a brisk diuresis >20L in 24 hours to complete
anuria. Additionally, the recipient’s native UO may range from normal
to anuric.
• As a general rule, daily ﬂuid balance should be 7+500mL (for insensible
losses).
• This can be achieved by 100% replacement of the previous hour’s
losses + 40mL.
• This must be combined with regular careful clinical examination to
detect hyper-/hypovolaemia and adjusted accordingly. If the patient is
still polyuric after 48–72h, it may be being ‘driven’ by this regimen. Try
reducing to 75% replacement, and monitor for signs of hypovolaemia.
Fluid choice
• Due to the electrolytes losses that can occur, it is best to use a
balanced electrolyte solution, e.g. Hartmann’s or Ringer’s lactate
(especially if polyuria).
• The risk of them contributing to i K+ is low, as they only contain
4–5mmol/L.
• 0.9% NaCl should be avoided in high volume, as excess salt-loading
and hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis may develop.

Responding to low urine output
• Oliguria may be deﬁned as UO <0.5mL/kg/h.
• Remember, what are you expecting? DGF and oliguria are unusual in
live donor kidneys or a DBD kidney with a short CIT.
•  The most worrying sign is oliguria (or anuria!) developing in a
patient previously passing good urine volumes. Causes include:
• Hypovolaemia (beware inaccurate charts, undocumented loose
stools, etc.).
• Catheter problems (obstruction, bypassing).
• Relative hypotension (esp. if the donor was hypertensive).

Transplantation

Ureteric obstruction.
Urinary leak (high drain volumes?).
CNI toxicity.
Arterial or venous thrombosis.
Hyperacute rejection (graft pain, swelling, tenderness) is rare but
should be checked for.

Action
• Unless there are deﬁnite signs of ﬂuid overload, give a ﬂuid challenge:
• Rate of delivery is more important than choice of ﬂuid.
• Administer a rapid bolus of 250mL.
• Use additional variables to assess response, e.g. HR, BP, JVP, CVP.
• Do not give repeated ﬂuid challenges for oliguria, unless there are
signs of a positive impact, e.g. improved BP or low CVP rising to
8–12cmH2O, otherwise there is a danger of pulmonary oedema.
• Flush the catheter, and replace, if necessary.
• Send a drain creatinine if volumes are high (b p. 402).
• Check/review CNI levels.
• Arrange an urgent Doppler USS to assess vascular patency and ﬂow,
RI, and signs of obstruction or collections.
• If all these factors are in order, the most likely diagnosis is DGF
(b p. 404).
• If DGF persists to day 5–7 post-op, then a surveillance transplant
biopsy is usually undertaken.
• There is no role for the use of furosemide or ‘renal dose’ dopamine to
augment urine output.
RRT post-transplant
• Unless immediate graft function occurs, dialysis may be required.
• Patients should be reassured that this is not uncommon.
•  Haemodialysis post-transplant can actually increase/prolong DGF.
• Standard indications apply in the presence of oliguria:
• Hyperkalaemia: >6.5mmol/L and/or ECG changes.
• Pulmonary oedema.
• Symptomatic uraemia.
• If patients are passing good volumes of urine, medical therapies may be
more appropriate. Avoid calcium/K+ exchange resins.
• In addition, RRT may be required for:
• Safe transfusion of blood products, e.g. if Hb <70g/L.
• Reducing risk of uraemic bleeding for planned procedures, e.g.
transplant biopsy.
• Aim to minimize UF, and avoid intradialytic hypotension as much as
possible.
• PD may be used if the peritoneum has not been breached.
General measures
• Remove IV lines, including CVC, as soon as practical to avoid infection.
• Early oral intake, as advised by the surgical team.
• Encourage deep breathing exercises and early mobilization.
• Urinary catheter to stay until at least day 5 (protects the vesicoureteric
anastomosis).

PERIOPERATIVE CARE

• Watch phosphate levels. Urinary phosphate excretion often
precedes a falling creatinine. Frank hypophosphataemia is relatively
common. Encourage high phosphate foods; may require oral or IV
supplementation.
• Remove drains when volume <50mL/24h (with surgical approval).
• Watch blood sugars closely for the development of NODAT
(b p. 424).
• Encourage self-administration of medications prior to discharge.
• Do not forget subsequent induction immune suppression doses, e.g.
day 4 basiliximab.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

The transplant operation
Organ retrieval
• Retrieval of multiple organs is the norm (i.e. heart–lung, liver, renal,
pancreas), and several retrieval teams are often present.
• Both kidneys are harvested and may be sent to different centres.
• The kidneys are perfused with a cooled balanced physiological solution
in situ (e.g. with Marshall’s or University of Wisconsin solution) prior
to removal.
• Along with the kidney, the renal artery (on a cuff of aorta), the renal
vein(s) (with a cuff of IVC), and as much ureter as possible (with
periureteral tissue—to preserve its vascular supply) are removed.
• The kidneys are placed on ice for transport. Machine perfusion
techniques are an alternative—several types of apparatus are
commercially available.
• Splenic tissue and mesenteric lymph nodes are also retrieved for
cytotoxic cross-matching.

Recipient operation
• The kidney is carefully examined ‘on the bench’, paying particular
attention to the arterial anatomy (accessory arteries cannot be
sacriﬁced, as there is no collateral supply). Small veins may be more
expendable, as there is some overlap in venous drainage. Vascular
reconstruction may be necessary prior to implantation.
• The left renal vein is longer, making it easier to implant.
• Graft implantation is heterotopic, usually into the right iliac fossa
(the right iliac vessels are generally more accessible), although some
surgeons favour placing a right donor kidney on the left side and vice
versa (as kidney orientation is easier). If a previous transplant remains
in situ, the contralateral side will be favoured.
• An implantation biopsy may be taken (esp. if the donor is considered
marginal) to help predict graft function in the post-operative period.
Scoring systems are applied to these ‘time zero’ biopsies in an attempt
to predict subsequent graft outcomes, e.g. the Karpinski score is
based on summation of damage to glomerular, tubular, interstitial, and
vascular compartments.
• An oblique incision is made from above the symphysis pubis towards
the anterior superior iliac spine.
• The operation is largely extra-/retroperitoneal.
• Note: the native kidneys are not removed.
• Vascular anastomoses are usually end-to-side to the iliac vessels
(preferably the external iliac artery—use of the internal may lead to
erectile dysfunction in 4).
• The ureter is joined to the recipient bladder. A submucosal tunnel (or
oversew of bladder muscle) helps to prevent urine reﬂux.
• A JJ stent is usually placed to protect this anastomosis (removed
cystoscopically at 74 weeks). A urethral catheter is left in situ for
5 days.
• A drain is usually left in the perirenal space.

THE TRANSPLANT OPERATION

• Intraoperative CVP is maintained at >10cmH2O and MAP >90mmHg
using crystalloid (9 albumin).
• Mannitol (or furosemide) may be administered as the vascular clamps
are released.
• Methylprednisolone (0.5–1g) is also given intraoperatively.
• See Fig. 5.17.

Dual transplants
• Double transplants represent an attempt to increase the
transplanted nephron mass.
• Dual transplants are increasing, as more ECD kidneys are accepted
for transplantation.
• There are no universally agreed criteria: some centres will be guided
by a pre-implant biopsy, some by donor characteristics alone, and
some by both donor and recipient characteristics.
• Both kidneys are usually placed in the same iliac fossa, but one can
be placed on each side in some circumstances.
• It is a signiﬁcantly longer operation than a single kidney transplant, so
intraoperative risks are higher.
En bloc transplantation refers to a technique wherein both kidneys are
retrieved together, with donor aorta and IVC still attached. They are
then transplanted en bloc into the recipient. This is usually performed in
the context of paediatric donation (age <5): it increases the transplanted
nephron mass and helps make the surgical anastomoses less technically
demanding.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Surgical complications
Early
Bleeding
Rarely from the vascular anastomoses (l haemorrhagic shock), more
likely from damage to a smaller vessel. May present with i HR, d BP,
i drain output, blood loss from the surgical wound, d Hb. USS or CT
may reveal a haematoma around the graft. Resuscitation, then urgent
re-exploration is usually indicated.
Wound infection
The incidence has reduced with the use of perioperative antibiotics.
Contributing factors include uraemia, steroids, sirolimus, diabetes mellitus,
older age, and obesity. Causative organisms are usually Gram +ve.
Vascular thrombosis/occlusion
• Occurs in 0.5–5% of transplants.
• Risk factors: complex vascular anastomoses, d BP, donor vascular
disease, recipient thrombotic tendency (e.g. APS), recipient sickle cell
disease (l pre-transplant exchange transfusion to d sickle Hb + warm
graft prior to reperfusion).
Arterial
Arterial thrombosis is usually secondary to a technical error (either during retrieval or during transplantation—usually intimal injury). Usually
presents with oliguria and deteriorating graft function (9 pain). Requires
urgent surgery, but graft loss is the usual outcome. Regular USS with
Doppler is required to conﬁrm perfusion in those with DGF.
Venous
Suspect if sudden d UO, graft tenderness and swelling, macroscopic
haematuria, pain (often severe). Doppler USS will show thrombosis and
reversed diastolic arterial ﬂow. Management: surgical exploration. The
kidney will usually be removed (and reperfused) whilst the venous anastomosis is completely revised.
Urinary leak
Most commonly a technical problem with the vesicoureteric anastomosis or necrosis of the distal transplant ureter due to poor blood supply.
Rarely, a complication of transplant biopsy. Often silent but may be painful (as the collection of irritant urine expands), scrotal/labial swelling, d
UO, i SCr (resorbed urinary creatinine), i drain volumes, wound leak,
collection of ﬂuid on imaging. Investigation: biochemical analysis of drain
(or aspirate) will reveal a high Cr—higher than serum (lymphocele ﬂuid
has the same Cr as serum). Na+ and K+ are also high. Cystography/retrograde pyelography will demonstrate the source of the leak. Management:
re-catheterize the bladder. If the ureteric stent has been removed, it may
be reinserted (usually antegrade insertion) and left in situ until the leak
has sealed (may take weeks to months). If this conservative approach fails,
then surgery is necessary.

SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS

Lymphocele
Graft implantation interrupts the pelvic lymphatics. This may result in a
collection of lymph around the transplant (710% of transplants). Usually
small and uncomplicated. May become large enough to obstruct the kidney or iliac veins (l thrombosis). Can cause leg swelling and DVT and
may become infected. More common in those treated with sirolimus (b
p. 390). Diagnosis is on USS (or CT). Indications for intervention: discomfort, obstruction, or infection. Aspiration or drainage is usually carried out
percutaneously. Recurrent lymphoceles may need fenestration to allow
drainage into the peritoneal cavity.
Early obstruction
Early obstruction is usually caused by urethral catheter blockage by clots.
Ureteral blockage from clot or oedema is rare if a JJ stent has been left in
situ ( but suspect if i SCr when it is removed). Extrinsic compression
from a lymphocele may occur. USS will demonstrate hydronephrosis (but
is often normal in early obstruction).

Late
Renal artery stenosis
Transplant renal artery stenosis may occur early (either a technical complication due to vessel injury or s to neointimal hyperplasia) or late (often
atheromatous build-up at the transplant artery origin). Presents with i
SCr (9 ACE-I/ARB-related transplant dysfunction), increasing BP, salt and
water retention. Rarely, a transplant bruit. Should also be suspected if
progressive transplant dysfunction with unexplained scarring on biopsy.
Investigation: Doppler USS, CT angiography, MRA, formal angiography
(according to local expertise). Percutaneous angioplasty can be undertaken, although recurrence is common (l repeat angioplasty 9 stenting).
If required, surgical correction is technically challenging.
Ureteric stenosis
Occurs in 1–5% of transplants. Almost always in the distal ureter and s
to ischaemia (the ureter is supplied by the transplant renal artery; ischaemia l ﬁbrosis). Other causes include: lymphoceles, BK virus (b p. 436),
urothelial tumours, and renal calculi. Investigation: USS will show hydronephrosis and allow nephrostomy placement. A nephrostogram will show
the level of the obstruction. CT and cystoscopy may be needed to determine the cause in some cases. Management: JJ stenting. Small strictures
may be amenable to endourological dilatation, but surgical re-implantation
is often required. Occasionally, a native ureter is mobilized and anastomosed to transplant pelvis.
Bladder dysfunction
Transplantation may uncover pre-existing bladder outﬂow obstruction or
bladder dysfunction. Examine for a palpable bladder, DRE, USS bladder
pre-/post-voiding and consider urodynamic studies. Bladder training may
be required in patients who have undergone long-term dialysis, as their
bladders may have reduced capacity and muscle tone, resulting in signiﬁcant urinary frequency.

Introduction
Immune factors are important to both acute rejection and chronic allograft dysfunction, but there are many other potential causes (b pp. 405,

differential diagnosis (see Fig. 5.18).

Immediate post-transplant period
Causes of graft dysfunction
• Delayed graft function (DGF).
• Vascular thrombosis.
• Ureteric leak or obstruction.
• Hyperacute rejection.
• Recurrent disease (2 FSGS, HUS).
Delayed graft function (DGF)
Occurs in the immediate post-operative period and can effectively
be considered as acute tubular injury or AKI following transplantation
(it is caused by an ischaemia-reperfusion injury). The recipient will usually
be oliguric, unless they had a signiﬁcant urine output pre-transplant (e.g.
a pre-emptive transplant). DGF is unusual with living donors (73%) but
affects 720% of deceased donor grafts overall (730% for ECD and 740%
for DCD kidneys).
DGF has numerous deﬁnitions but is usually described as the need for
>1 dialysis post-transplantation. Of those patients with DGF: 750% will
recover by day 10; 733% will recover between day 10 and 20; 710–15%
will recover subsequently, and 72–15% will not recover at all (primary
non-function).

GRAFT DYSFUNCTION

DGF is associated with acute rejection (inﬂammation l HLA upregulation l enhanced graft immunogenicity). It is also associated with d graft
survival and i mortality (see Table 5.7).

Management
• Regular USS and Doppler to ensure adequate perfusion (including
immediately post-op).
• Maintain euvolaemia to encourage recovery.
• Avoid d BP during dialysis.
• Transplant biopsy (usually day 5–7) to conﬁrm diagnosis
(histology: acute tubular injury) and exclude acute rejection. Repeat
every 5–7 days if no improvement.
• CNI-related vasoconstriction may aggravate DGF. If immunological risk
allows, some centres will reduce (or even stop) CNIs—particularly if a
depleting antibody has been used for induction.

Early graft dysfunction
Initial transplant function, but subsequent progressive i SCr.
Causes
• Pre-transplant:
• Volume depletion.
• Vascular thrombosis (b p. 402).
• Sepsis.
• Intrinsic transplant:
• Acute rejection (b p. 408).
• CNI nephrotoxicity (b p. 416).
• Thrombotic microangiopathy (b p. 412).
• Recurrent disease (b p. 418).
• Post-transplant:
• Obstruction (b p. 403).
• Urinary leak (b p. 402).
• Urinary infection (b p. 438).

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Assessment
• Clinical assessment:
• Fluid balance; assess volume status.
• Any new nephrotoxic drugs?
• Urinary tract symptoms to suggest infection or outﬂow
obstruction?
• Any other evidence of infection, e.g. fever?
• Pain over graft?
• Investigation
• FBC, SCr, U&E, bone proﬁle, clotting.
• If d Plt l LDH and blood ﬁlm (TMA?).
• Review recent CNI levels.
• Urinalysis and MSU for M,C&S.
• Urgent transplant USS (l obstruction) and Doppler (l perfusion).
• Transplant biopsy.

GRAFT DYSFUNCTION

Transplant biopsy
See native renal biopsy (b p. 81). The patient may no longer be an
inpatient, in which case a day case biopsy can be considered. However, if
SCr is rapidly rising, rejection is deemed likely, or the patient is high-risk
for any other reason (e.g. Hb <80g/L; BP requires additional treatment), then an inpatient biopsy, with at least an overnight stay, may be
desirable.
• Pre-biopsy:
• USS: to exclude obstruction.
• BP <160/90mmHg, preferably <140/90mmHg.
• Hb ideally >80g/L.
• Normal clotting (PT and APTT <1.2 x control). Platelet count
>100 x 109/L.
• Send G&S.
• Omit aspirin and prophylactic heparin on the day of biopsy and
day after (preferably 5 days for aspirin if an elective biopsy).
• Consider DDAVP if eGFR <25mL/min or urea >30mmol/L
(780mg/dL) (b p.80).
• Sterile urine.
• Informed consent.
• If the patient has DGF, they should be well dialysed, preferably
with their last dialysis the day before biopsy.
• Biopsy:
• Performed under USS guidance.
• Usually upper pole (further away from vasculature and ureter).
• LA is inﬁltrated down to the transplant.
• Disposable TruCut® needles or spring-loaded biopsy guns are
generally used (e.g. 16 gauge—larger needles may i complication
rate). An initial stab incision at the skin can ease passage of the
needle.
• One core of tissue is usually adequate, although 2 are preferred
(sampling of 10 glomeruli and 2 vessels is required for accurate
Banff classiﬁcation). Avoid >4 passes with the biopsy needle. Call
for a more experienced operator after two unsuccessful passes.
• Pressure can be applied to the biopsy site for 10min. The patient
remains on bed rest with a good ﬂuid intake for 6h. Pulse and BP
are monitored regularly and urine inspected for haematuria.
• Complications:
• Haematuria (macroscopic in 75%).
• Bleeding. Blood transfusion required in <2%.
• If bleeding is severe or persistent (71 in 1,500), then angiography
with embolization can be undertaken. However, many centres
would proceed directly to surgical exploration. A transplant
nephrectomy is necessary in 71 in 3,000.
• Small AV ﬁstulae complicate 710% of transplant biopsies. These
very rarely become large enough to cause problems or require
embolization.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Acute rejection
2 Treat suspected rejection immediately.

Introduction
Acute rejection is deﬁned as a sudden deterioration in graft function,
associated with speciﬁc immunopathological changes which are classiﬁed according to agreed international criteria (Banff classiﬁcation, see
Table 5.8).
Acute rejection is described as either predominantly T cell-mediated or
predominantly antibody-mediated (humoral), although, in reality, there is
almost certain to be a degree of pathophysiological overlap.
Key facts
• Modern immunosuppressive regimens have reduced the incidence of
early acute rejection to 710–20%.
• <10% of patients experience rejection after 1 year (‘late’ rejection is
often associated with non-compliance).
• A single episode of rejection reduces 5-year graft survival by 710%.
• The classical presentation of fever, painful graft, and oligo-anuria is
now very rare. Rejection usually presents with an asymptomatic rise in
SCr (or as a ﬁnding on a protocol or DGF transplant biopsy).

Risk factors (see also b Box 5.4, p. 381)
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Delayed graft function (b p. 404).
Sensitization with anti-HLA antibodies (b pp. 361–3).
Repeat transplantation.
HLA-mismatched graft (b p. 361).
No induction immunosuppressive therapy (b p. 382).
Non-TAC-/MMF-based immune suppression (b p. 386).
Poor compliance or other cause of inadequate immune suppression
(e.g. recent vomiting).
• Recent CMV infection (intentional reduction in immune
suppression).
• Recent UTI (increased graft immunogenicity).

3 Hyperacute rejection
This catastrophic form of rejection occurs immediately on reperfusion of
the transplanted kidney and is due to the presence of pre-formed antibodies (anti-ABO or anti-HLA). These antibodies bind to donor endothelial
cells where they activate complement and clotting cascades l vascular
thrombosis. Graft loss is inevitable.
Thankfully, it has been virtually eradicated by modern cross-matching
techniques.

T cell-mediated rejection
• Most common form of rejection (790%).
• Highest incidence in the ﬁrst 3 months post-transplantation.

ACUTE REJECTION

• T cell-mediated rejection may either be tubulointerstitial (more
common—previously known as cellular) or vascular or both.
• Tubulitis is the characteristic lesion of tubulointerstitial T cell-mediated
rejection: mononuclear cells inﬁltrate the walls and lumina of the
tubules.
• Tubulitis is scored as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the
number of mononuclear cells within the tubular basement membrane
(scored t1–3).
• In addition to T cells, inﬁltrates often contain macrophages,
eosinophils, and plasma cells. There is usually associated interstitial
oedema.
• Intimal arteritis or ‘endothelialitis’ is the characteristic lesion of
vascular T cell-mediated rejection: mononuclear cells inﬁltrate the
arterial endothelium.
• More severe vascular rejection will demonstrate transmural arteritis,
ﬁbrinoid change 9 stromal haemorrhage (scored v1–3).
Treatment
T cell-mediated rejection without vascular involvement
• Corticosteroids:
• Methylprednisolone IV 500mg daily for 3 days.
• Consider increasing oral prednisolone to 0.3mg/kg/day to a maximum
20mg, then taper by 5mg weekly to previous maintenance dose.
• Optimize maintenance immunosuppression:
• Switch CIC to TAC. Target trough concentration 10–12
micrograms/L.
• Optimize MMF dose. Target dose of 2g/day, if tolerated.
• Response expected within 5 days (775% response rate). Re-biopsy if no
improvement.
Refractory (‘steroid-resistant’) or vascular (Banff IIB, III) T cell-mediated
rejection
• Add T cell-depleting antibody (e.g. ATG) (790% response).
• For protocol, see b p. 384.
• If no response (75%), consider IVIg 2g/kg single dose (or 0.4g/kg for
ﬁve doses).

Humoral or antibody-mediated rejection
Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) refers to rejection caused by antibodies directed against donor HLA, blood group antigens, or other endothelial
cell antigens. The dominant mechanism of injury is antibody-dependent,
with activation of the classical complement pathway.
Although antibody-mediated, T cells are vital for the initiation and maintenance of the B cell responses that lead to the generation of plasma cells
and injurious antibody.
The diagnosis of AMR requires evidence of graft dysfunction and is supported by the presence of the following features:
• Morphologic evidence of acute tissue injury:
• Acute tubular injury.
• Neutrophils and/or mononuclear cells in peritubular capillaries
(PTC) 9 glomeruli 9 capillary thrombosis.

409

410

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

• Fibrinoid necrosis/intramural or transmural inﬂammation in arteries.
• Immunopathological evidence of antibody action (often absent, so not
essential to the diagnosis of AMR):
• C4d 9 (rarely) immunoglobulin in PTC. C4d is a complement
degradation product, derived from classical pathway activation).
• Ig and complement in arterial ﬁbrinoid necrosis.
• Serologic evidence of circulating antibodies to donor HLA (DSA) or
other anti-donor endothelial antigen.
Cases that meet only two out of the three criteria are considered suspicious for AMR. Acute T cell-mediated rejection may also be present.
Treatment
X Unfortunately, the evidence base is poor and mostly derived from single centre experiences. However, the treatment of AMR is based on four
concepts:
• Suppression of T cell responses (e.g. depleting antibody, escalation in
maintenance immune suppression (MMF, CNI)).
• Elimination of circulating antibody using plasma exchange or other
immunoadsorption technique.
• Inhibition of residual antibody (e.g. IV immunoglobulin).
• Suppression or depletion of B cells (e.g. rituximab or splenectomy).
In practice
• DSA level daily during treatment course.
• Optimize maintenance immunosuppression:
• Switch CIC to TAC. Target trough concentration 10–12
micrograms/L.
• Optimize MMF dose. Target dose of 2g/day, if tolerated.
• Corticosteroids:
• Methylprednisolone IV 500mg daily for 3 days.
• Increase oral prednisolone to 0.3mg/kg/day to a maximum 20mg,
then taper by 5mg weekly to previous maintenance dose.
• EITHER: ATG if evidence of concomitant T cell-mediated rejection.
• OR: plasma exchange (b p. 950):
• This should be given on alternate days or daily in severe cases (e.g.
high DSA titre, anuric patient). Treatment should continue until
there is clinical improvement 9 DSA titres become undetectable.
• After each PEX, give intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 400mg/kg.
• Consider rituximab as part of initial therapy if severe histological
change (or ongoing AMR despite PEX and IVIg).
• Repeat biopsy if no improvement in SCr in 7 days:
• Ongoing AMR: continue PEX and IVIg 9 rituximab, if not already
given. Consider eculizumab (b p. 391). Some centres would also
contemplate a splenectomy.
• Resolution of AMR: continue oral immunosuppression at doses
above. Close monitoring with weekly DSA.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Thrombotic microangiopathy
Occurs in two contexts post-transplantation:
• Recurrent HUS (b p. 420).
• New TMA:
• Usually associated with CNI use but associated with other drugs
(particularly sirolimus).
• Rejection: antibody-mediated rejection and severe T cell-mediated
rejection.
• Antiphospholipid syndrome (b p. 664).
• Accelerated i BP.
• Unsuspected complement mutations (these should always be
considered).
• CMV disease.
Pathogenesis
Involves endothelial toxicity, d prostacyclin synthesis, vasoconstriction,
i synthesis and release of large vWF multimers, i leucocyte adhesion
to vascular endothelium, platelet aggregation, thrombosis, and ischaemia.
Clinical features
May occur <1 week to >5 years post-transplant. Often, an unexpected
ﬁnding on transplant biopsy, following i SCr (graft dysfunction may be
rapidly progressive). <50% have d Plt, d Hb, red cell fragmentation on
blood ﬁlm, i LDH—but may be ‘transplant-limited’, with none of these
apparent.
Consider investigation for complement mutations (usually H or I) in all
patients.
Histology
Vessels: arteriolar wall thickening, swelling and detachment of endothelial
cells, ﬁbrinoid necrosis.
Glomeruli: capillary thrombi, attenuation of mesangial matrix and degeneration of mesangial cells (‘mesangiolysis’), glomerular ischaemia.
X Management
• In less fulminant disease, more gradual changes to immune suppression
can be undertaken—although the optimum regimen is unknown.
• 2 Treat rejection.
• In more aggressive disease:
• Stop CNI.
• The role of PEX (with FFP) in CNI-associated TMA is uncertain but
often undertaken anyway.
• Eculizumab (b p. 391) shows great promise, but its role awaits further
clariﬁcation.

Transplantation

Chronic allograft dysfunction
Introduction
Both immunological and non-immunological factors play a role in progressive graft dysfunction and loss over time (see Table 5.9). Use of the
previous descriptive term ‘chronic allograft nephropathy’ (CAN) is now
discouraged, as a more pathologically speciﬁc diagnosis (or diagnoses)
should always be sought. Chronic rejection implies an immune-mediated
process, but optimum treatments are unknown.
Shared histological features are of interstitial ﬁbrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA). At 2 years, 770–90% of grafts will show features of IF/TA.

Proteinuria

Assessment
The monitoring of graft function over time is one of the fundamental roles
of a transplant follow-up clinic. Most patients will be asymptomatic. Key
investigations include:
• SCr and eGFR.
• It is important to consider changes in these over time in a similar
manner to native kidney CKD.
• Therapeutic drug levels, especially CNI levels.
• Again, these should be considered over time and in the context of
an individual patient’s progress.
• What was their immunological risk? What were the donor
characteristics of their graft? Have they had any rejection episodes?
Have they developed any infections or other complications of
immune suppression?
• Urinalysis and uPCR.
• Proteinuria is a marker of renal injury, as well as risk of progressive
transplant dysfunction, and overall CV morbidity and mortality. It
may also identify recurrent native disease.

CHRONIC ALLOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION

•
•
•
•
•

• It is a feature of transplant glomerulopathy, the glomerular
manifestation of chronic antibody-mediated rejection (see below).
MSU: if abnormal urinalysis, symptoms of UTI, unexplained loss of
function, and pre-biopsy.
HLA antibody screen (b p. 363).
• Measure monthly for the ﬁrst 3 months (weekly in selected cases),
then 3-monthly for the ﬁrst year, then annually.
BK virus screening (b p. 436).
Transplant USS (9 renal artery Doppler).
Transplant biopsy (the majority).
• Some centres perform interval ‘protocol biopsies’, regardless of
function (e.g. at 1, 3, 6, or 12 months), to assess overall graft health
and individualize management, esp. immunosuppression.
• X The relevance of ‘subclinical’ rejection on such protocol biopsies
is uncertain.
• 2 The interpretation of a transplant biopsy performed for chronic
dysfunction is complex and requires careful clinical-histological
correlation, considering all the factors in Table 5.9.

Histology
The Banff classiﬁcation includes both ‘immune’ and ‘non-immune’ chronic
damage.
• Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection.
• Only accepted as a distinct entity in 2005 but now the focus of a
considerable amount of attention.
• Features: (i) circulating anti-HLA antibody (esp. DSA),
(ii) peritubular capillary (PTC) C4d positivity (only present in 750%
cases), and (iii) evidence of chronic tissue damage (arterial intimal
ﬁbrosis without elastosis, duplication of the glomerular basement
membrane (‘double contours’), multilayering of the peritubular
capillary basement membrane, IF/TA). The glomerular changes are
referred to as transplant glomerulopathy and will eventually develop
into glomerulosclerosis.
• Chronic active T cell-mediated rejection.
• Chronic allograft arteriopathy is characterized by rejection-induced
intimal thickening of arteries (l arterial luminal occlusion and graft
ischaemia).
• Characterized by arterial intimal ﬁbrosis with mononuclear cell
inﬁltration in ﬁbrosis and formation of neointima.
• IF/TA, with no evidence of speciﬁc aetiology.
• I: mild IF/TA (<25% of cortical area).
• II: moderate IF/TA (>25–50% of cortical area).
• III: severe IF/TA (>50% of cortical area).

2 The key structures that determine the destiny of a transplant are
the vessels (mainly arteries). There is no collateral vasculature, so vessel narrowing and occlusion inevitably lead to downstream ischaemia,
particularly in the interstitium.

Avoid nephrotoxins.
Maintain good ﬂuid balance.

Management of chronic rejection
Chronic active T cell-mediated rejection
Generally treated as for acute T cell-mediated rejection (b p. 408–9).
X Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection
Present in 725% of those undergoing assessment for loss of graft function. Optimum treatment is unclear—studies are ongoing. Common
strategies include optimizing general measures, switching from CIC to
TAC, increasing MMF as tolerated. IVIg, PEX, and rituximab are used in
some centres (as for acute antibody-mediated rejection), but beneﬁt is
unproven.

Management of CNI toxicity
The earliest functional change is vasoconstriction, but structural toxicity,
with histological change in arterioles, glomeruli, and tubules eventually
supervenes. Some degree of damage is inevitable in all patients taking a
CNI (>50% within 12 months).
CNI-induced arteriolar changes include swelling of the medial smooth
muscle cells and occasional endothelial or smooth muscle cell necrosis.
The mature lesion demonstrates PAS-positive hyaline nodules in the
media and adventitia of the afferent arteriole (similar to hypertensive damage). TMA may also be present, and FSGS can occur in the glomeruli as
a s consequence of arteriolar injury. IF/TA is considered a non-speciﬁc
secondary feature caused by nephron dropout. It is characteristically
described as striped ﬁbrosis in this context. Tubuloepithelial cell vacuolization 9 microcalciﬁcation may be evident.
CNI minimization
• Either:
• Dose reduction to aim for a lower therapeutic level.
• Complete withdrawal, usually with a switch to sirolimus. There
is some evidence to suggest beneﬁt from this manoeuvre if
undertaken early enough in selected patients ( not those with
proteinuria).
• Other agents, such as belatacept, may have a role in the future.

CHRONIC ALLOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION

The failing transplant
It is very easy to forget the ‘CKD basics’ in a transplant patient with
deteriorating graft function. These include:
• Explaining the situation to the patient, with appropriate psychosocial
support.
• Management of the secondary complications of a falling GFR,
including anaemia (with IV iron and an ESA, as necessary) and
CKD-MBD.
• Ongoing control of BP and CV risk.
• Early discussion regarding future dialysis and possible
retransplantation (ideally pre-emptively). The earlier this is
undertaken, the greater chance the patient will be able to choose
the most acceptable modality for them.
• Creation of dialysis access. In some cases, this may still be
functioning from earlier in their RRT career.
 Immune suppression should not be stopped suddenly. AZA/MMF are
generally stopped ﬁrst, followed by slow steroid withdrawal and progressive reduction of CNI (over 73–6 months). Slow weaning will help
to prevent inﬂammation in a remnant graft which can make the patient
feel quite unwell and provoke the development of anti-HLA antibodies
that might prejudice future transplantation.
Transplant nephrectomy is an operation with appreciable associated
morbidity. Indications: the graft is a source of infection or inﬂammation
(presenting as pain, general malaise, haematuria, ESA resistance).
Removal of the graft to prevent HLA sensitization is controversial—
the patient may still become sensitized to antigens present in the
vascular stump.

417

418

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Recurrent disease
Introduction
Recurrence of original disease following transplantation affects 710–20% of
patients and accounts for 78% of graft failures at 10 years. It is an important
differential in the assessment of a recipient with graft dysfunction, particularly in the presence of proteinuria.
With the exception of primary FSGS and atypical HUS, which can recur
immediately, recurrent glomerular disease tends to manifest months, or
even years, after transplantation.
Even then, recurrent disease may run an incipient course; for example,
although evidence of recurrent IgA is present on a signiﬁcant number of
transplant biopsies, it does not lead to graft dysfunction or loss in the
majority (see Table 5.10).

Primary FSGS
Risk factors for recurrence include a short time between initial presentation and ESRD, recurrence in a previous transplant (l recurrence >80%
for subsequent transplant), younger patients (a particular problem in paediatric transplantation where FSGS is a common cause of ESRD), diffuse
mesangial proliferation on native renal biopsy. Black patients appear to
have a reduced risk. Familial FSGS is a different disease, and recurrence
is rare. Potential recurrence is not an absolute contraindication to live
donor transplantation but requires careful assessment and discussion, as
recurrence appears more common in this context.
Presentation
May present immediately post-transplant, with oliguria and graft dysfunction from acute tubular injury. This can mimic DGF. Urine should be
tested daily for proteinuria, and nephrotic range proteinuria may develop
within days to weeks of transplantation (associated with a fall in serum
albumin). Urinary protein excretion (e.g. uPCR) should be documented

RECURRENT DISEASE

pre-transplant for later comparison. Recurrence after 1 year is unusual.
Early transplant biopsy is likely to be normal on light microscopy (besides
ATN/ATI), as it takes several months for the typical FSGS lesions to
develop. However, EM will be abnormal, with podocyte foot process
effacement.
Treatment
• Difﬁcult!
• Plasma exchange or immunoabsorption. Start as soon as proteinuria
develops. Response in 750% but relapse common (long-term
‘maintenance’ PEX is not an uncommon situation). PEX may be started
pre-emptively in live donor and as cold ischaemic time allows in
deceased donor transplantation.
• High-dose CIC (given IV in some protocols) is favoured.
• Steroids and cyclophosphamide (esp. children).
• Rituximab has been beneﬁcial in some case series.
• ACE-I/ARB for proteinuria.
De novo FSGS post-transplantation
s FSGS lesions are reported, with chronic allograft dysfunction from both
immune (transplant glomerulopathy) and non-immune (e.g. hypertension)
mechanisms. It may also be apparent with other recurrent diseases, e.g.
IgAN. However, presentation with the nephrotic syndrome is unusual.

IgA nephropathy
Overall, long-term graft outcomes are the same as other recipients. Some
series have suggested a recurrence in the majority (760%) but clinically
signiﬁcant disease in a minority only. Younger patients appear at greatest
risk, as do those with aggressive disease in their native kidneys—crescentic
IgAN appears to carry a particularly high risk. No speciﬁc treatment, but
BP control should be meticulous, with regimens including ACE-I/ARB.

Membranous GN
Recurrence risk of 720–30% and also the commonest de novo form of GN
post-transplant. It is not yet known if those with anti-PLA2 antibodies are
at higher risk. Graft outcomes are relatively poor. In common with native
disease, some patients will spontaneously remit, whilst others will have
more progressive disease. Treatments have largely been extrapolated
from native disease (where CNIs are commonly used!). A potential role
for rituximab is under investigation.

MCGN
Bears more than a passing resemblance to transplant glomerulopathy, but
clinical context, immunoﬂuorescence, and EM should distinguish them.
Younger age of onset and aggressive native disease appear to be more
important risk factors for recurrent disease than histological subtype. Type
I MCGN often has an underlying cause, so recurrence (and indeed the
feasibility of transplantation) will be linked to this. Type II MCGN has a
very high recurrence rate, a poor response to treatment, and a signiﬁcant
rate of graft loss.

419

420

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Alport syndrome
Transplanted Alport’s patients may rarely develop de novo anti-GBM antibodies and a rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis (donor A5
type IV collagen is recognized as non-self). This is extremely difﬁcult to
treat and has virtually 100% recurrence in subsequent transplants.

Diabetic nephropathy
Histological recurrence occurs eventually in 100% recipients (usually
within 5 years)—unless simultaneous kidney–pancreas transplantation has
been undertaken (b p. 446). A reported cause of graft loss in <2%. Has
an important implication for CV disease progression and patient survival.
Transplantation in other systemic diseases, such as SLE, vasculitis, HBV,
and HCV, is covered in the relevant section elsewhere in the book.

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS)
It is important to try and discriminate between de novo post-transplant
HUS and recurrence of D+ HUS or D– HUS (a subset of the latter will
be familial HUS, with a genetic basis).
The rate of recurrence of D+ HUS is <1%. D– HUS recurs in 750%,
usually within a month of transplantation. De novo HUS arises after
transplantation and is discussed separately (b p. 412).
Presentation is usually with i SCr, d Plt, and microangiopathic
haemolytic anaemia (MAHA).
Renal biopsy will reveal typical HUS changes of endothelial cell swelling, widened subendothelial spaces, and glomerular capillary ﬁbrin
deposits.
Risk factors for recurrence are mutation of complement regulatory
proteins (e.g. causing factor H or factor I deﬁciency). Serum factor H
and I concentration should be measured and a mutation analysis undertaken in all patients with HUS if transplantation is being contemplated.
Previously, the risk of recurrence with almost inevitable graft loss, has
been so high that transplantation, particularly live donor transplantation,
has been relatively contraindicated.
Eculizumab shows great promise for protecting renal allografts from
post-transplant HUS, although it is unclear how long treatment should
continue (particularly important, given the cost of the drug).

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Long-term transplant follow up
Introduction
The purpose of long-term follow-up is to maintain both graft and patient
health. In most centres, this is undertaken in a dedicated multidisciplinary
transplant clinic, but close communication with the patient’s primary care
provider is crucial. In general, after 73 months the focus begins to shift
from immunological factors and rejection risk towards more long term
concerns such as CV risk.
Initial follow-up is intense; usually at least three clinic visits a week for the
ﬁrst 1–2 months, gradually reducing to 71 visit monthly at 6–12 months,
and eventually every 3–6 months.

Cardiovascular disease
• Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the commonest cause of death with a
functioning graft in renal transplant patients.
• Renal transplantation is considered cardioprotective—dialysis patients
have 710–20x increased risk of CVD mortality, and renal transplant
patients have a 3–5x increased risk of CVD mortality, when compared
to the general population.
• Pre-transplantation CVD management and screening are discussed in
earlier sections.
• Immunosuppressive medications can exacerbate CV risk factors (see
Table 5.11).
• The relationship between falling GFR and increasing CV risk holds true
in patients with renal allograft dysfunction. Stroke and sudden cardiac
death are the main CV associations.
• Addressing CV risk factors should be a focus of care within the
long-term management of the renal transplant recipient. Achieving
optimal graft function is one of the most effective ways to
reduce CVD.

Hypertension
• The rationale for controlling hypertension in transplant recipients is
twofold—and the same as in patients with CKD, i.e. reduce CV risk
and slow progressive loss of GFR.

LONG-TERM TRANSPLANT FOLLOW UP

• 2 Hypertension has been identiﬁed as a major predictor of graft
survival in renal transplant recipients.
• BP targets for transplant patients have mostly been extrapolated from
RCT studies in the CKD population (see b Chapter 3).
• Of note, there are no large-scale studies comparing different classes
of antihypertensive drugs with a focus on reducing CV events in
transplant recipients.
Hypertension is common after transplantation due to:
• Pre-existing hypertension (790% of patients with ESRD have
hypertension pre-transplantation).
• Established arterial stiffness (may improve over time but only slowly, if
at all).
• Use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly steroids (through i Na+
retention) and CNIs (i vasoactive and nephrotoxic effect).
• May occur in the setting of transplant renal artery stenosis.
Approach to management
• Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) guidelines
suggest a target BP of <130/80mmHg.
• Many centres aim for a target BP of <125/75mmHg if coexistent
proteinuria (uPCR >50mg/mmol).
• Patients should be educated regarding the beneﬁts of lifestyle
interventions for BP control.
• Choice of drug class as per BHS/NICE guidelines (b p. 488). Of note:
• Drugs that block the renin–angiotensin system may unmask a
transplant renal artery stenosis.
• Hyperkalaemia is common in patients on CNIs and ACE-I/ARBs
(CNI l acidosis and distal tubule K+ retention).
• Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists inhibit cytochrome P450
isoenzyme li CNI levels.
• Calcium antagonists reduce blood pressure effectively and,
theoretically, protect against the vasoconstrictor actions of CNIs.

Dyslipidaemia
• Dyslipidaemia often results in raised total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
and triglycerides as well as increased levels of intermediate
(atherogenic) lipoproteins.
• Studies have shown that this dyslipidaemia, in the context of
transplantation, is modiﬁable by reduction of immune suppression and
the use of conventional lipid-lowering drugs.
• ALERT is the only larger RCT of statin treatment in renal transplant
recipients and demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in non-fatal MI and
cardiac death in the ﬂuvastatin treatment group. SHARP was another
landmark renal statin study and, although transplant patients were
excluded, many patients received a transplant in the follow-up period.
Dyslipidaemia is common after transplantation due to:
• Pre-existing dyslipidaemia (>60% of patients with ESRD have
dyslipidaemia pre-transplant).

423

424

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

• Use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly steroids, CNIs and
mTOR inhibitors (see Table 5.11).
• Change in dietary intake in the absence of restriction associated
with ESRD.
Approach to management
• CV risk tables are not always helpful in this cohort of patients, but, in
the UK, guidelines suggest any transplant patient with a 10-year CVD
risk of >20% should take a statin. Treatment should be to a target TC
<4mmol/L, LDL cholesterol <2mmol/L. However, KDIGO practice
guidelines have recently moved away from such numeric targets,
recommending statin treatment for all transplant recipients (b p. 205).
• Patients should be educated regarding the beneﬁts of lifestyle
interventions for lipid control.
• Review immune suppression, and moderate where possible.
• Options regarding statin choice should take into consideration the
following:
• Simvastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin are metabolized by
microsomal enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4, which is inhibited by
calcineurin inhibitors, particularly CIC. The resultant increased
statin concentrations can cause adverse effects.
• The prescription of simvastatin and CIC is contraindicated by the
MHRA in the UK. The others should be started at lower doses and
titrated carefully.
• Drugs with alternative metabolism, such as pravastatin, ﬂuvastatin,
and atorvastatin, are reported to be safe and effective at
standard doses, but should be introduced and titrated carefully
under supervision.
• There are no data to support ﬁbrates, and concerns regarding side effect
proﬁle in the presence of low eGFR, makes them a less favourable choice.

New-onset diabetes after transplantation
• New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is due to both
impairment of insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance.
• Incidence of new-onset diabetes is between 5 and 20% in the ﬁrst year
after transplantation.
• 2 The presence of diabetes is an important risk factor for both poor
patient and graft survival. This is in the context of both pre-existing
diabetes and NODAT. NODAT is associated with a doubling in
all-cause mortality and a tripling in CV events.
• Steroid avoidance regimens have reported that NODAT occurred less
frequently—and, when it did, it was less severe. However, overall beneﬁts
were modest and associated with increased risk of acute rejection.
Risk factors for new-onset diabetes after transplantation are:
• Age >60.
• Use of certain immunosuppressive drugs, particularly steroids, CNIs,
and mTOR inhibitors (impaired insulin secretion).
• Non-Caucasian ethnicity (particularly Afro-Caribbean and Indo-Asian
patients).
• Deceased donor transplants.
• BMI >30kg/m2.

LONG-TERM TRANSPLANT FOLLOW UP

•
•
•
•

Family history of T2DM.
History of diabetes in pregnancy.
HCV +ve patients.
Predisposing genetic markers (e.g. TCF7L2 and PPARG).

Approach to management
• Use WHO criteria for diagnosis.
• Patients should be educated regarding the beneﬁts of lifestyle
interventions for diabetic control.
• Review medications—many would consider steroid withdrawal,
although the evidence of beneﬁt is slim (despite the well-recognized
risk of late steroid withdrawal, b p. 391).
• In terms of hypoglycaemic agents:
• Refer to local guidelines for oral hypoglycaemic use. Metformin
is an option if eGFR >45mL/min (caution due to risk of lactic
acidosis).  Exercise caution with thiazolidinediones, acarbose, and
exenatide if eGFR <30mL/min.
• Refer to local guidelines for insulin choice.
• Standard screening for diabetic complications apply for patients with
NODAT, monitoring for neuropathy, retinopathy, and vigilant foot
care (due to infection risk in patients on immune suppression).

Bone and mineral metabolism
• Transplant recipients are at increased risk of fracture. This risk is
higher than in dialysis patients.
• Risk factors: steroid use, CNIs, previous renal osteodystrophy,
persistent hyperparathyroidism, metabolic acidosis,
hypophosphataemia, lack of physical activity, post-menopausal ♀,
smoking.
• Almost all patients will enter transplantation with a degree of renal
osteodystrophy—and this will persist post-transplant.
• Patients who have an impaired post-transplant function (e.g. eGFR
<30mL/min) are best viewed using a CKD-MBD paradigm, i.e.
they are more accurately described as having osteodystrophy than
osteoporosis. This may explain why DEXA scanning does not
accurately predict fracture risk in transplant recipients (even though
BMD rapidly decreases in the ﬁrst year).
• Management: control of serum phosphate and PTH, according to
familiar CKD targets (b p. 244); correct nutritional vitamin D
deﬁciency (e.g. if 25-OH vitamin D <30 micrograms/L).
• Those with persistent tertiary hyperparathyroidism should be
observed for a year to see if spontaneous involution occurs prior
to proceeding with parathyroidectomy. Cinacalcet can be a useful
means of ameliorating hypercalcaemia during this period.
• Those patients with a GFR >30mL/min can be generally be managed as
osteoporosis.
• Management: oral calcium and vitamin D preparations, correction
of acidosis, oral bisphosphonates, steroid minimization.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Post-transplant infections
Introduction
Transplant recipients are susceptible to a wide variety of infectious pathogens (see Fig. 5.19). The general principles of management in this group
are: (i) to prevent certain common infections (particularly in the ﬁrst few
months after transplantation or during periods of heavier immune suppression); (ii) to be aware of the spectrum of infectious disease to which
recipients are vulnerable at particular times post-transplantation; and (iii)
to rapidly assess and treat transplant patients presenting with suspected
infectious disease.
Strategies for prevention might include:
• Perioperative broad-spectrum antibiotics.
• Co-trimoxazole (PCP, UTI).
• Isoniazid for TB in high-risk recipients (b p. 395).
• Valganciclovir for CMV in at-risk recipients (b p. 432).
• Screening of dialysis patients for MRSA (nose, throat, and perineal
swabs), with eradication therapy if +ve.
• VZV vaccination for non-immune patients pre-transplantation (see
Table 5.12).
• Pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccinations.
• HBV vaccination for all those with advanced CKD (see Table 5.12).

Timing of infection
Infections in the ﬁrst month
• Standard post-operative infections related to the procedure itself—see
Surgical complications (b p. 402). Including wound, chest, and
infected haematomas or lymphoceles.
• Urinary tract infection: common. Anuric dialysis patients often have
small-capacity dysfunctional bladders, and indwelling urinary catheters
or ureteric stents further increase risk. If recurrent, USS transplant,
and assess bladder emptying. Is there a relevant abnormality of the
native kidneys that may be contributing? Ureteric stent may require
early removal.
• Infected lines: remove all cannulae (central and peripheral) as quickly
as possible. Are dialysis lines (or PD catheters) still in situ?
• Clostridium difﬁcile: the most important cause of hospital-acquired
diarrhoea. Incidence of 3.5–16% in transplant recipients. Antibiotic use
is the most signiﬁcant risk factor, but there are others, including i age,
ICU admission, i length of stay.
• Graft l recipient bacterial infections. It is common practice to culture
a sample of the preservation ﬂuid that is used to transplant the organ
and to treat according to the result.
• Rarely, a recipient bacterial infection will recrudesce in the recipient
(usually S. aureus or Gram –ve organism).

POST-TRANSPLANT INFECTIONS

1–6 months
• Viral infections (often reactivation of latent disease): CMV, HSV, VZV,
EBV, BK virus.
• TB.
• Opportunistic infections: Listeria, Aspergillus, pneumocystis pneumonia.
Beyond 6 months
• Conventional community-acquired pathogens.
• Chronic viral infection: BK nephropathy, EBV-driven PTLD.

General management issues
2 When treating:
• Appropriate dose reductions for dGFR: watch SCr carefully.
• Drug interactions, particularly antimicrobials, that may induce/inhibit
cytochrome P450 and thus modify CNI levels: monitor CNI trough
levels carefully (b p. 388).

The transplant patient with a fever
• Fever may represent:
• Infection.
• Acute rejection (less common with modern immune
suppression).
• Systemic inﬂammatory response.
• May occur during treatment with biological agents (b pp. 383–5).
• Take a full history.
• Full examination:
• Including palpation of transplant.
• Look under all dressings!
• What was the patient’s dialysis modality and access?
• Investigations:
• Urinalysis and MSU.
• i WCC (or neutropenia—stop myelosuppressive drugs: MMF/
AZA/co-trimoxazole/valganciclovir).
• i CRP.
• Blood cultures.
• Culture wound discharge, if present, and drain ﬂuids.
• CXR.
• USS transplant.
• Imaging for collections in the post-op period (usually USS or CT
abdomen and pelvis). Aspirate for ﬂuid culture.
• Remove lines, catheters, and ureteric stents, if relevant.
• Consider broad-spectrum empiric treatment prior to results of
the investigations.
• Seek microbiological input ASAP.
• Immune suppression may require reduction. Seek specialist advice.
• PO paracetamol to reduce fever.
• Fluid resuscitation.

• Before routine PCP prophylaxis, the overall incidence among kidney
transplant recipients was 2–15%.
• Risk factors: more intense immune suppression, particularly
corticosteroids and depleting antibodies. Also pre-existing or
co-infection with CMV (an immunomodulatory virus).
• Clinical features: develops over several days. Dyspnoea and
hypoxaemia out of proportion to physical and radiological ﬁndings.
• CXR: normal or bilateral pulmonary inﬁltrates.
• CT: more sensitive. Ground glass opaciﬁcation (but multiple different
appearances are described).
• Conﬁrmation by demonstration of organisms in lung tissue
or respiratory secretions. Usually requires induced sputum or
bronchoscopy for BAL (stain with antibodies to PCP).
• Treatment: co-trimoxazole. Minimum 14 days (SE: bone
marrow suppression, rash, hepatitis, interstitial nephritis).
Second-line: pentamidine (SE: pancreatitis—avoid in kidney–pancreas
recipients, disturbed glucose metabolism, bone marrow suppression,
nephrotoxic).
• Adjunctive high-dose steroid if hypoxic (e.g. 40–60mg prednisolone
bd for 5–7 days, then taper). Respiratory support, as necessary.
• Prophylaxis: co-trimoxazole for 6–12 months (also suppresses
toxoplasma and Listeria). Dapsone (SE: haemolytic anaemia) and
monthly nebulized pentamidine are alternatives, if intolerant.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Introduction
2 The most important infectious complication of transplantation.
CMV is a DNA (herpes type) virus that infects 750% of the normal
population. Following p CMV infection (usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals), CMV persists in the host, and reactivation usually
results in asymptomatic viral shedding. The presence of CMV IgG in serum
identiﬁes past infection (750% of adults). CMV is transmitted in saliva and
other body ﬂuids (including blood) as well as in transplanted organs (CMV
infection via blood products is now rare, as leucocyte-depleted products
are usually supplied).

CMV in transplant recipients
Immunosuppression promotes reactivation of latent CMV in the transplanted organ and/or tissues of the recipient. The resultant active CMV
infection may be asymptomatic or result in CMV disease.
2 Donor/recipient pre-transplant CMV serological status is important in
determining the risk of CMV infection/disease (see Table 5.13).
Symptomatic CMV disease is largely conﬁned to the ﬁrst 6 months
post-transplant but may present later, especially in high-risk recipients
who cease prophylaxis.
CMV disease
CMV disease is manifested by fever (>38*C for 2 days over a 4-day period),
d WCC, d Plt. Malaise, fatigue, fever, myalgia, and night sweats are also
common.  CMV causes further host immunosuppression (predisposing
to s invasion—esp. PCP and fungi).
CMV end-organ disease
• Hepatitis.
• Pneumonitis.
• GI: diarrhoea (colitis), abdominal pain, nausea, dysphagia.
• Transplant dysfunction:
• Due to invasive CMV disease  OR due to rejection (CMV
increases the expression of graft HLA antigens).
• CMV retinitis is unusual and occurs late (usually >6 months).

admission for transplant if previously seronegative.
• Donor status is provided with transplant organ.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

CMV prophylaxis
• Indicated for CMV donor +ve/recipient –ve patients (D+ R–).
• Valganciclovir 900mg PO od, adjusted for renal function, for 90 days
post-transplant (see Table 5.14).
Routine surveillance of asymptomatic patients
• CMV viral load is measured in whole blood by PCR.
• Routine surveillance should commence at 2 weeks post-transplant and
continue for 12 months (weekly for the ﬁrst 3 months and monthly
thereafter).
• It is unnecessary to perform viral surveillance in D– R– patients or in
D+ R– patients receiving prophylactic valganciclovir. Some centres
issue prophylaxis to all, but D+ R–, recipients.
Interpretation of CMV viral load results
• Rapid increases in CMV viral load (the trend), rather than isolated
results, are predictive of development of CMV disease.
• Routine surveillance forms the basis for pre-emptive therapy. The goal
is to detect active CMV viraemia in order to facilitate prevention of
symptomatic CMV infection/end-organ disease.
• Both international units (IU) and logs are often reported. A change of
one log or more in the space of 3 or 4 days is likely to be signiﬁcant.
Pre-emptive treatment
• This strategy includes both reduction of immunosuppression, where
possible, and the institution of treatment doses of valganciclovir to
prevent or ameliorate clinical CMV disease.
• Valganciclovir 900mg PO bd, adjusted for renal function, for a
minimum of 2 weeks or until CMV viral load is undetectable (see
Table 5.14).
• For patients who are CMV-negative pre-transplant, detection of CMV
viraemia is consistent with primary CMV infection. The patient should
be clinically reviewed ASAP.
• Immediate reduction of immunosuppression and initiation of
pre-emptive antiviral therapy should be considered.
• If the patient was seropositive pre-transplant and is asymptomatic
and the viral loads detected are low and not rapidly increasing, it
may be appropriate to either retest in 1 week or to reduce immune
suppression and then retest.
• In contrast, a rapidly increasing viral load, with or without symptoms,
would suggest the need to commence antiviral therapy, with additional
reduction of immunosuppression.
Management of CMV disease
Reduction of immunosuppression
• Review immunosuppressive therapy, and stop/reduce one agent,
usually MMF (or AZA).
• Do not recommence the discontinued drug for a minimum of 1 month,
unless rejection occurs.

CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV)

• CMV relapse is common, usually presenting 1–4 weeks after
completion of treatment, and is more likely if immunosuppressive
therapy is reinstated during this period.
Antiviral therapy
• Oral valganciclovir 900mg PO bd, adjusted for renal function. 2 Note
the higher dose frequency required for pre-emptive therapy and for
treatment of CMV syndrome/disease vs prophylaxis.
• IV ganciclovir 5mg/kg IV bd, adjusted for renal function.
• IV therapy is generally reserved for patients unable to tolerate oral
treatment.
• Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is used as an adjunct for
pneumonitis (IVIg 500mg/kg every other day for a total of 10 doses).
Duration of therapy
• Treatment should be given for a minimum of 2 weeks and continued
until the CMV viral load in whole blood is undetectable on at least one
occasion.
• Treatment of end-organ CMV disease should be continued for a
minimum of 3 weeks and continued until the CMV viral load in whole
blood is undetectable on at least one occasion.

Transplantation

Herpes simplex virus infection
Herpes simplex virus seroprevalence is 750% in the renal transplant
population. Post-transplant infection may be primary, following reactivation, or secondary as a result of person-to-person contact or allograft
transmission.
Clinical features
• Oral or genital mucocutaneous lesions are most common; however,
patients may present with:
• Pneumonitis.
• Tracheobronchitis.
• Oesophagitis.
• Hepatitis.
• Disseminated infection.
• CNS infection.
Diagnosis
• Direct ﬂuorescence antibody for HSV from vesicles.
• PCR—quantifying viral copy number from CSF, blood, etc.
• Serology is rarely helpful in distinguishing active infection.
Treatment
• Oral aciclovir for mucocutaneous manifestations.
• IV aciclovir for disseminated or solid organ infection.
• Ganciclovir and foscarnet are also effective.
• Renal function should be carefully monitored throughout treatment
with antivirals.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

BK virus nephropathy
Introduction
Polyomaviruses are ubiquitous but rarely cause clinical illness. Only two
virus strains are known to be pathogenic in humans: Polyomavirus hominis
1 (BK) and Polyomavirus hominis 2 (JC) (named with the initials of the individuals from whom they were ﬁrst isolated), and these only cause disease
in immunocompromised patients.
BK virus causes viral nephropathy (polyomavirus-associated nephropathy, PVAN) as well as haemorrhagic cystitis and ureteric ulceration and
stenosis (9 obstruction). JC virus causes a viral encephalopathy.
Primary BK virus infection occurs in early life, resulting in almost universal seropositivity. The virus persists in the urinary tract (including latency
in tubular cells), and viral shedding into the urine is relatively common
(particularly older patients, patients with diabetes, HIV-infected and transplant patients). There are several genotypes, so, although a recipient may
have acquired partial immunity to one genotype, the allograft may exposure them to another.
Over the last 20 years, PVAN has emerged as an important cause of
allograft dysfunction (perhaps reﬂecting the more potent immune suppression introduced during that era). Risk factors appear to include: donor
seropositive and recipient seronegative (usually paediatric recipient), signiﬁcant HLA mismatch, graft injury of other cause, acute rejection, and
potency of immune suppression.
PVAN occurs in 75% of kidney transplant recipients. Viraemia occurs in
a greater proportion (710%), and BK viruria is even more common. The
risk of graft failure is high, with 3- and 5-year graft survival rates of 765%
and 755%, respectively.

Clinical features
Often an asymptomatic increase in SCr (79–18 months after
transplantation).

Diagnosis
• Urine cytology. Infected tubular cells are shed into the urine—these
so-called ‘decoy cells’ (with ground glass intranuclear inclusions) are
present in 90% of infected patients (>10 decoy cells/hpf suggests disease).
This ﬁnding precedes viraemia by weeks and nephropathy by months.
• PCR quantiﬁcation of virus in urine or blood is now widely available.
These are very sensitive but less speciﬁc.
• Some advocate monitoring for BK viraemia (e.g. screen monthly for
the post-transplant year) so that pre-emptive changes can be made to
immune suppression before BK nephropathy supervenes.
• Renal biopsy is necessary to conﬁrm the diagnosis (although PVAN is
unlikely if blood and urine PCR are normal).
• Histology. The characteristic ﬁnding is tubulointerstitial nephritis with a
mononuclear cell inﬁltrate, along with viral cytopathic changes, such as
inclusions in tubular cells. Immunohistochemistry will conﬁrm BK virus.
•  These ﬁndings are focal and easy to miss. They may also be
confused with rejection.

BK VIRUS NEPHROPATHY

Treatment
(See Fig. 5.21)
• 2 Reduction of immunosuppression. There is no good evidence to
guide this, but many protocols start with reduction or withdrawal of
antiproliferative agents (MMF/AZA). Aim for lower CNI levels, e.g.
TAC 3–6ng/mL.
•  The risk is precipitating rejection, the treatment of which,
with concomitant PVAN, is extremely challenging. Many continue
with immune suppression reduction and treat rejection with IV
and oral steroids. IVIg is an alternative (e.g. 2g/kg), as it has the
theoretical ability to ‘neutralize’ BK virus as well as having recognized
anti-rejection efﬁcacy.
• The anti-arthritic drug leﬂunomide has both immunosuppressive
and antiviral properties (acts through inhibition of tyrosine kinase
activity and depletion of pyrimidine).  SE: haemolytic anaemia,
thrombocytopenia, and TMA.
• No clear evidence to support the use of antivirals. Cidofovir for 1–4
fortnightly doses has been the most popular ( nephrotoxic).
• Quinolones, including ciproﬂoxacin, may be of some beneﬁt (inhibit
DNA topoisomerase and polyomavirus-associated helicase).

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Post-transplant UTI
2 UTI is the most common infection, following kidney transplantation,
and has been reported in 42–70% of patient cohorts. This relates to urinary tract instrumentation, poor bladder function, other pre-existing urinary tract abnormalities, and immune suppression. It is most common in
the ﬁrst year and associated with higher rates of hospital admission. More
common in ♀.

Prevention
Patients with recurrent UTIs should undergo urological investigation prior
to transplantation. Those taking prophylactic antibiotics pre-transplant
may need to continue them post-transplant—co-trimoxazole for PCP
prophylaxis will provide some cover. Broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis is administered preoperatively. Ensure timely removal of urinary catheter (usually 5 days) and ureteric stent (usually 4–6 weeks).

Clinical features
• Asymptomatic, with incidental detection on urinalysis/MSU more
common in this group (and more likely to develop into a symptomatic
infection).
• Irritative urinary tract symptoms—dysuria, frequency, nocturia.
• Graft pyelonephritis: fever, graft tenderness, often systemically unwell
with graft dysfunction.
• Systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome l septic shock.
•  Note: UTI is a risk factor for rejection.

Diagnosis
• Urinalysis.
• MSU for M,C&S.
• Transplant (and native kidney) USS: exclude obstruction.

Microbiology
• E. coli is the most common pathogen.
• Others: enterococci, Pseudomonas, coagulase-negative staphylococci,
and Enterobacter.

Treatment
• Empirical antibiotics should be started after an MSU has been obtained
in symptomatic patients.
• Therapy should be guided by sensitivities ( a signiﬁcant proportion
of infections will be resistant to ﬁrst-line antibiotics, with increasing
detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase organisms). Discuss
complex cases with microbiology.
• Avoid nephrotoxic antibiotics, and adjust doses, according to renal
function.
• Graft pyelonephritis: co-amoxiclav IV for 10–14 days (+ gentamicin
IV). Convert to oral if clinically improving and afebrile for 24h. If
penicillin-allergic, give 1–2 doses gentamicin, then review culture
results.

POST-TRANSPLANT UTI

Recurrent UTI
• Clarify previous infective episodes, duration of treatment, compliance,
and whether negative urine culture was obtained following treatment.
• Ensure adequate bladder emptying (USS).
• Consider urodynamics.
• Late UTIs (>6 months) are associated with worse graft outcomes:
consider DMSA for transplant scarring if deteriorating graft function.
• Consider cystoscopy, particularly if recurrent graft pyelonephritis.
• Consider prophylactic and rotational antibiotic therapy.

439

440

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Post-transplant malignancy
Introduction
The frequency of malignancy is increased in the post-transplant population,
with a risk of 72.5–3.0x over an age-matched non-transplant population
(as well as over age-matched dialysis patients). There is a huge variation
between tumour types. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) has 7100x
greater risk (7200x for squamous cell cancer); renal cell and urothelial cancer have 710x risk, and breast cancer in ♀ has approximately equal risk.
Cancer is recorded as the cause of death in 710% of transplant recipients
who die with a functioning graft (higher in some studies). Immune suppression is the most important risk factor, but others, including smoking, viral
infections (e.g. EBV), and older age, are also relevant.
Although donors (both living and deceased) are screened for malignancy, there are rare reports of malignancy being transmitted from donor
to recipient.
Mechanisms
• Increased risk is more a function of overall immune suppressant
burden than of a particular immune suppressive agent.
• Most immune suppressants impair the cell cycle and cell growth across
many different cell types.
• CNIs upregulate both TGF-B and VEGF, leading to increased
angiogenesis and tumour spread in animal models.
• Azathioprine interrupts the repair of UV light-associated DNA damage
in the skin. This may be aided by the viral-induced inhibition of the p53
tumour suppressor gene.
• PTLD is associated with EBV proliferation. Human herpes virus 8
(HHV-8) is associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma.
• Sirolimus and other mTOR inhibitors reduce angiogenesis, so it is
hoped they may be associated with less malignancy than other agents.
Studies are ongoing.
Screening
Ensure access to national screening programmes, such as cervical screening, mammography, and FOB testing. X PSA 9 DRE in 4 recipients aged
>50 (or younger if family history of prostate cancer). Some advocate
annual USS screening of native kidneys for renal cell cancer (particularly if
known acquired cystic disease, i.e. cysts arising in atrophic ESRD kidneys).
Prevention
2 Smoking cessation, self-examination, sun avoidance (appropriate clothing; sunblock; avoid sunburn), reporting of untoward symptoms.
Education should start in the pre-transplant phase and be continually
reinforced during transplant follow-up.

Skin cancer
750% of transplant recipients will develop a non-melanoma skin cancer
(NMSC) after 20 years (SCC > BCC—a reversal of the incidence in the
general population). Skin type ( pale skin), human papilloma virus, and

POST-TRANSPLANT MALIGNANCY

sun exposure (6 older age) all appear to be risk factors. Tumours are
often multiple and metastasize more commonly (75%).
2 Advocate sun protection at all times, starting pre-transplant.
Recommend regular self-surveillance and annual dermatological review
(particularly if previous NMSC).
Treatment: local excision, topical therapy, e.g. imiquimod, 5-ﬂuorouracil,
podophyllin. Retinoids have been used for secondary prevention.
Consider reduction of immune suppression. Stop AZA/MMF, if possible.
X Conversion from a CNI to sirolimus may be advantageous (proven
beneﬁt in Kaposi’s sarcoma). Studies are ongoing.
Malignant melanoma and Kaposi’s sarcoma also occur more frequently
in transplant recipients.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder
Second most common post-transplant malignancy after NMSC. PTLD
encompasses a range of disorders, from an EBV-associated infectious
mononucleosis syndrome early after transplantation through to non-EBV(and often non-B cell-) associated malignant lymphoma, occurring late
after transplantation (see Table 5.15).
EBV and PTLD
EBV is an overwhelming risk factor for PTLD. EBV is usually acquired
in childhood. Most transplant recipients will be EBV-seropositive.
However, EBV may be transmitted to an EBV-naive recipient from a
donor kidney. EBV-related lymphomas occur mainly within the ﬁrst year
post-transplantation (>90%). Immune suppression disrupts CD8 +ve cytotoxic T cell EBV surveillance, allowing latently infected cells to undergo
replication l eventual B cell transformation and immortalization.
2 Recipient and donor EBV serological status should be known
pre-transplant.
EBV infection post-transplant: fever, malaise, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphocytosis. Other non-PTLD manifestations include: hepatitis, pneumonitis, bone marrow suppression.
PTLD risk factors
• EBV-seronegative recipient.
• Depleting antibodies and high levels of immune suppression.
• The development of a primary EBV infection.
• CMV infection
• For late PTLD: risk factors include older donor age and length of
immune suppression.

Signs include: lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, tonsillar enlargement, and focal neurological signs.
Disease may be nodal or extranodal, localized (more common) or disseminated. Localized disease may occur in the transplant kidney.
Investigations
• Anaemia, i serum urate, i LDH.
• High-risk individuals (children and seronegative adults) should undergo
surveillance, using EBV-DNA PCR.
• If suspected, whole body CT is usually undertaken (or CT-PET).
• Histopathology to conﬁrm diagnosis, and classify according to
international criteria.
• Additional tests may include bone marrow examination and LP for CSF
examination.
Management
• A multidisciplinary approach, involving transplant physicians,
histopathologists, and haemato-oncologists is essential.
• Histological type is crucial to planning therapy.

POST-TRANSPLANT MALIGNANCY

• For EBV-associated PTLD, the mainstay is a stepwise reduction in
immune suppression. Expect response in 2–4 weeks.  Rejection
causing graft loss in <10%.
• This process can be tailored by measuring EBV-speciﬁc T cell subsets
(their appearance with reduction of immunosuppression may herald
regression of tumour).
• No evidence to support antiviral therapy.
• Rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is usually the next step and has
made a signiﬁcant difference to remission rates (B cell tumours are
CD20 +ve).
• Treatment of late and T cell PTLD requires more conventional
chemotherapy, e.g. CHOP.
Prognosis
• >80% of early EBV-associated polymorphic disease will enter remission
with treatment, and relapse is rare.
• Worse prognosis with i age, non-EBV-associated disease,
monomorphic disease, high LDH that is slow to fall with treatment.

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

ABO- and HLA-incompatible
transplantation
Introduction
Many patients have live donors come forward to donate, but the transplant cannot proceed, as they are not ABO-compatible or because they
have a positive cross-match.

Transplanting across blood groups
Blood group O individuals are universal donors and AB universal recipients. Until fairly recently, transplantation was only carried out in blood
group matched pairs or according to ‘transfusion rules’. This is no longer
necessarily the case.
Note: blood group A patients can be subgrouped as A1 and A2. Those
with A2 express much lower amounts of A antigen on cell (including
endothelial) surfaces and can 6 be considered as blood group O if the
recipients have no (or low) levels of circulating anti-A antibodies. This
means that A2 to O transplants are relatively straightforward.
In addition, anti-blood group antibody removal to reduce anti-A and
anti-B antibody titres to an acceptable range for transplantation (generally
1:8) is increasingly common.
Technique
Plasma exchange or immunoabsorption are used to remove anti-A and
anti-B antibody. The number of treatments will depend on the initial
antibody titre. Treatment is often continued post-transplant. New antibody production is prevented by administration of rituximab—usually
71 month prior to transplantation (previously a splenectomy was necessary). Induction therapy (often with a repeat dose of rituximab) is usual.
Maintenance immune suppression will be TAC- and MMF-based. Antibody
titres are measured regularly post-transplant (often daily initially). Anti-A
and anti-B antibody titres rise over time but do not injure the graft
(thought to be an example of immune accommodation).
2 It is imperative that anti-A and anti-B antibodies are not inadvertently
transfused back to the recipient in a blood transfusion or FFP. This means
that only blood group AB FFP or blood products should generally be used.
Packed red cells of the recipient’s type are safe to use. Discuss with your
transfusion laboratory.
710% incidence of antibody-mediated rejection (the majority of grafts
are C4d +ve but with no other evidence of antibody-mediated rejection).
Graft outcomes are excellent: 1- and 3-year graft survival 96% and 94%,
respectively.

Transplanting across a positive cross-match
• The aim is to remove donor-speciﬁc anti-HLA antibodies prior to
transplantation.
• This has proved more challenging than ABO-incompatible pairs.
• Meticulous assessment of the donor-speciﬁc cross-match is necessary.

ABO- AND HLA-INCOMPATIBLE TRANSPLANTATION

• The goal is essentially to remove DSA until the CDC-XM becomes
negative (b pp. 363–4).
• Unfortunately, antibody removal is often a temporary phenomenon.
There is likely to be a memory immune response with induction of,
and concomitant, T cell reaction.
• Antibody removal protocols are often complex, involving PEX (9 IVIg),
rituximab, depleting antibody induction, steroids, TAC, and MMF.
• Serial DSAs are measured both pre- and post-transplantation.
• There is higher incidence of DGF and both antibody and T
cell-mediated acute rejection (735%).
• Outcomes are generally comparable to deceased, rather than live,
donor transplantation.
• 1-year graft survival 780%. Long-term data, particularly with respect
to the incidence of chronic antibody-mediated rejection and graft
outcomes, are awaited.
• Most pairs should be offered the paired scheme (see below) before
proceeding.

Live donor exchange schemes
If a patient has a live donor but, for ABO or immunological reasons, a
direct transplant cannot go ahead, donors and recipients may agree to
swap kidneys (see Fig. 5.22). This is coordinated centrally (e.g. by NHSBT
in the UK). Very careful planning is required. Donor nephrectomies are
carried out simultaneously in order to prevent a particular donor ‘backing
out’ after their relative has received a kidney. A large pool is required for
suitable exchanges to occur. Blood group O and highly sensitized patients
are the least likely to be matched (as per the deceased donor list).

CHAPTER 5

Transplantation

Kidney–pancreas transplantation
Introduction
Transplantation is the treatment of choice for diabetic patients with ESRD.
In addition to kidney transplantation alone, options are:
• Simultaneous kidney–pancreas transplantation (SPK) (780%).
• Pancreas (cadaveric) after kidney (usually living donor) transplantation
(PAK) (720%).
• Islet cell transplantation (see Box 5.7).

Beneﬁts
• Pancreas transplantation corrects the glycaemic state (HbA1c falls to
normal), leading to improved quality of life (freedom from both insulin
and dialysis).
• Prevention of progression (and possibly partial reversal X) of diabetic
complications.
• Comparable survival to live donor kidney transplant alone.

Selection criteria for SPK
•
•
•
•
•
•

T1DM and ESRD (dialysis anticipated within 6 months).
Usually have established diabetic compliactions.
Recipient age <60.
BMI <30.
Adequate cardiovascular reserve (b pp. 352–6).
Note: T2DM patients may also be eligible if insulin-requiring, BMI is
close to or <25, and who fulﬁll the listed criteria.

Selection criteria for PAK
• Patients with stable function of a previous renal transplant (usually
eGFR >40mL/min) who meet earlier listed criteria for SPK.

Selection criteria for pancreas transplant alone (PTA)
• Presence of T1DM.
• Life-threatening complications: hypoglycaemic unawareness, with
frequent or severe episodes of hypoglycaemia.
• These patients do not have ESRD.

Selection criteria for islet cell transplantation
• In combination with renal transplantation in a patient with T1DM
and ESRD.
• After successful live or deceased donor transplantation in a patient
with T1DM and ESRD.
• Hypoglycaemic unawareness, with frequent or severe episodes of
hypoglycaemia.
• Less commonly: poor metabolic control and progressive diabetic
complications, despite intensive insulin therapy.

KIDNEY–PANCREAS TRANSPLANTATION

Box 5.7 Barriers to successful islet cell transplantation
Islet cell transplantation shows promise, but early excellent results have
proved difﬁcult to sustain. Supplemental insulin is required by many
recipients within 1 year and >90% by 5 years. Reasons include:
• Immune-mediated destruction (highly immunogenic).
• Insufﬁcient islet cell mass (more than one donor needed).
• Drug toxicity (CNIs and steroids are toxic to islet cells).
• Recurrent transplantation is often necessary.

Surgical technique for pancreas transplantation
Two options:
• Bladder drainage. Kidney is transplanted into the left iliac fossa and
exocrine secretions of the pancreas routed into the bladder via a
duodenal cystotomy. Metabolic complications:
• Acidosis (HCO3– depletion) and Na+ loss (l relative d BP requiring
oral sodium bicarbonate administration (e.g. 2g qds).
• Calcium bladder stones (alkaline urine).
• Chemical cystitis/urethritis.
• Reﬂux pancreatitis.
• Enteric drainage (generally preferred): exocrine secretions drain into
bowel. Fewer metabolic complications.
• Immunosuppression. Similar to kidney alone transplantation. Depleting
antibodies more commonly used at induction. Steroid withdrawal
often favoured, e.g. by 6 months.
• Graft thrombosis (rarely salvageable) is the commonest early cause of
graft loss (prophylaxis with heparin 9 aspirin is usual).
• More morbidity in the ﬁrst year (length of hospital stay doubles,
compared to kidney alone).
• 20–30% chance of laparotomy during early post-transplant period
(peripancreatic collections are common).
• Fungal infection more common than after kidney alone; prophylaxis is
common practice.
• Rejection essentially causes pancreatitis, with i serum amylase and
lipase. If bladder drained, urinary lipase and amylase will d during
rejection.  Hyperglycaemia implies the majority of islet cells have
been destroyed and is 6 a worrying sign.
• Rejection in the pancreas is often diagnosed by biopsy of the
kidney transplant (pancreas biopsies are possible but are technically
challenging—there is a Banff classiﬁcation of pancreas allograft
rejection). However, asynchronous rejection (when one of the organs
rejects without a simultaneous process in the other) may occur.
• 85% and 70% 1- and 5-year pancreas survival after SPK (higher kidney
survival); 95% 1-year patient survival.
• Causes of post-transplant hyperglycaemia: graft dysfunction, NODAT
( steroids and CNI).

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Hypertension facts and ﬁgures
Epidemiology
The WHO identiﬁes hypertension as the single most important preventable cause of premature death in developed countries. It is the most common indication for prescription drug therapy (in 2009, the NHS in the UK
funded 140 million primary care prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs
at a cost of £700 million).
• The 2010 Health Survey for England (sample size 12,000) found
a prevalence of hypertension (≥140/90 or on antihypertensive
medication) of 32% for ♂ and 27% for ♀. This increases to 73% ♂
and 64% ♀ in the >75 age group. In England, only 13.6% are registered
on their GPs’ hypertension register.
• It is often found in association with other CV risk factors, rather than
in isolation.
• It is responsible for a signiﬁcant burden to both individuals and society
through coronary heart disease, stroke, and other vascular disease.
• Signiﬁcant underdiagnosis and treatment remain common; the ‘rule of
halves’ still applies:
• 1/2 those with i BP have not been diagnosed.
• 1/2 of those who have been diagnosed are not on treatment.
• 1/2 of those receiving treatment do not have adequate control.

Classifying hypertension
• Essential hypertension is a heterogeneous genetic and environmental
condition.
• Secondary hypertension implies i BP is s to an underlying disorder
and accounts for 75–10% of cases (b p. 474).
Hypertension facts and ﬁgures
• Systolic BP (SBP) increases with age until the 8th decade.
• Diastolic BP (DBP) increases up to age 50, after which it plateaus or
i slightly.
• DBP is the best indicator of CV risk <50 years. With i age, there is a
shift to SBP as the principal risk predictor.
• Reduction in SBP of 20mmHg systolic or DBP of 10mmHg is associated
with reductions in death from stroke and IHD of 750% (slightly more
in younger patients, slightly less in older). This is consistent down to
115/75mmHg in at least one large meta-analysis. X However, the
question of ‘how low to go?’ remains an important one. It is unclear if
there is a threshold below which further reduction in BP is no longer
beneﬁcial; the so-called ‘J-curve’ phenomenon (see b p. 468).
• Non-pharmacological strategies (i.e. lifestyle measures) have been
shown to d BP.
• Antihypertensive drug treatment not only d BP, but also
d complications.
• Patient education is paramount: i BP is an asymptomatic condition, and
beneﬁts of treatment may not be immediately apparent to the patient.

WHAT IS HYPERTENSION?

What is hypertension?
BP variation in a given population follows a skewed normal distribution
(see Fig. 6.1). Any cut-off point used to deﬁne abnormal will be arbitrary.
Normal BP varies with race, sex, and age, so, even if an arbitrary deﬁnition
of i BP could be agreed, it would need to be adapted, according to the
population in question.

Frequency in population

2 In addition, an individual whose BP is just below the deﬁned cut-off has
a virtually identical CV risk to one just above it.

Blood pressure

Fig. 6.1 Distribution of BP in any population: the cut-off for deﬁning ‘high’ BP is
arbitrary.

Deﬁnition
Perhaps the most useful deﬁnition is:
Hypertension is a level of blood pressure which places an individual at
increased risk of cardiovascular events and, when treated, results in more
beneﬁt than harm.

SBP, pulse pressure, and CV risk
SBP
• Historically, DBP was thought the best predictor of CV disease.
• It is now clear that SBP has a continuous independent relationship
with stroke and IHD risk.
• It can be difﬁcult to get SBP to target, particularly in the elderly.
Pulse pressure (PP) and risk
• PP is SBP minus DBP.
• A wide PP more accurately predicts adverse CV outcome than SBP
or DBP.
• PP appears to be a marker of arterial stiffness.
• PP may identify those with SBP at particularly high CV risk.
• At present, the majority of outcome data from clinical trials is for
SBP and DBP, so the major guidelines are based on these, rather
than on PP.

451

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Pathogenesis: general
Introduction
The great apes do not get i BP, nor do present-day hunter-gatherer populations (with a similar diet and lifestyle to that of our ancestors). It appears
that there are important factors within our environment and diet that predispose to hypertension. Genetic inﬂuences are important but insufﬁcient
in isolation.
The ﬁnal common pathway in chronic i BP is i OH systemic vascular
resistance (SVR). The earliest event in the development of i BP is usually
a rise in cardiac output (CO). i CO causes an increase in wall:lumen ratio
in resistance vessels (to normalize wall stress). This leads to a sustained
rise in SVR and causes chronic i BP. CO is usually normal in those with
established hypertension.
BP = cardiac output (CO) x systemic vascular resistance (SVR)

Central role of the kidney
• Sodium excretion depends on renal perfusion pressure (the Guyton
hypothesis). So i renal perfusion l pressure natriuresis. In i BP, the
curve describing this relationship is pushed to the right (see Fig. 6.2).
• In most people, the renal pressure natriuresis curve is steep (a small
increase in BP l large i in salt excretion). If this curve is shallower, BP
will vary more widely with salt intake. This ‘salt-sensitive’i BP occurs
more commonly in black patients and in CKD.
• Monogenic forms of i BP (rare!) suggest tubular ion transport
mechanisms are important mediators of blood pressure control.

Sodium excretion

452

Afferent arteriolar pressure

Fig. 6.2 In the normotensive individual, salt balance is maintained at a normal
BP. The slope of the curve is very steep such that dietary salt loading does not
signiﬁcantly alter BP. In hypertensive individuals, the curve is shifted to the right,
though it remains parallel. Thus, on a normal sodium diet, salt balance is maintained
but at a higher BP. In salt-sensitive individuals, the rightward shift is accompanied
by a depression of the slope (not shown). Thus, not only is the BP set point on a
normal diet elevated, but the BP also increases in response to dietary salt loading.

PATHOGENESIS: GENERAL

Salt intake and blood pressure
• There is a large body of evidence supporting the role of high salt
intake in the development of i BP.
• Genetic disorders associated with i BP often affect salt regulation.
• A high habitual salt intake is important for the development of the
increase in BP with age.
• The effects of salt appear dose-dependent.
• A key study, the Intersalt study, found that populations with a low
intake of dietary sodium have a low prevalence of i BP.
• i BP is seen mainly in societies with a salt intake >6g per day.
Modest reduction in salt intake for people on a typical western diet
results in a BP drop of 5.3/3.7mmHg in hypertensive patients and
1.9/1.1mmHg in normotensives.
• Were salt intake to be reduced over many years, the population
beneﬁts would be substantial.
• The recommended intake is <6g/day salt.
• The UK has led the way in reducing the salt content of food through
public health programmes and engagement with food manufacturers.
• The major challenge for consumers is to be aware of the amount
of ‘hidden’ salt in food. New labelling will hopefully go some way to
help them to identify healthier food options.

Endothelial dysfunction and nitric oxide
i BP is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation of the
vessel wall. A number of factors inﬂuence endothelial function:
• Nitric oxide (NO):
• NO l relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Released by
endothelium in response to shear stress (i.e. blood ﬂow).
• Endogenous NO synthase (eNOS) l continuous normal basal
release. Inducible iNOS l high concentrations of NO in response
to inﬂammatory cytokines.
• d NO has been reported in hypertensive patients (+ their
offspring).
• Oxidative stress: free radicals scavenge NO, forming potentially toxic
by-products. Radicals themselves (such as superoxide, O2–) are potent
vasoconstrictors.
• Prostaglandins: prostacyclin (PGI2) is released by endothelial cells in
response to shear stress and has a synergistic effect on tone with NO.
• Angiotensin II: a vasoconstrictor, also contributes to free radical
generation and to endothelin release.
• Endothelins: potent vasoconstrictors, opposing the actions of NO.
Also cause renal Na+ retention, i aldosterone, vascular smooth
muscle cell proliferation, cardiac hypertrophy, and ﬁbrosis. Their role
in the pathogenesis of i BP is unclear.

453

454

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Pathogenesis: genetics, arterial
stiffness, and SNS
Genetics
Inheritance is not Mendelian. No one gene is responsible. Larger collaborative studies are providing information on susceptibility genes.
Blood pressure levels are similar amongst close relatives (even those
with ‘normal’ range BP), suggesting alleles on several different genes may
have an effect on BP.
Rare monogenic causes of i BP have been identiﬁed, using linkage
analysis in affected families (see Box 6.1). Defects in these genes may also
be important in essential hypertension (gene defects coding the B and G
subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel (linked to Liddle’s syndrome) are
associated with BP variations in the general population).
Research focus has been on likely culprit genes (esp. the angiotensinogen gene) and is now looking at genome-wide associations.
Genes that have been associated with essential i BP include:
• ACE polymorphisms (I/I and I/D phenotypes associate with
salt-sensitive hypertension).
• A-adducin polymorphisms—a cytoskeletal protein which regulates
ion transport in the renal tubule. Polymorphisms may relate to salt
sensitivity, diuretic sensitivity, and essential hypertension.
• 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (GG phenotype correlates with
salt sensitivity).
• AT-1 receptor gene—in experimental studies, AT-1a +/+ mice have
higher blood pressures than –/– mice. Clinical relevance unknown.

Box 6.1 Rare single-gene causes of hypertension
• Liddle’s syndrome: mutations affect the epithelial sodium channel
(ENaC). Autosomal dominant, with i BP characterized by d renin,
d aldosterone, and d K+ (b p. 801).
• Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (b p. 478).
• Syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (b p. 480).
• Pregnancy-associated hypertension: a gene defect l partial activation
of the mineralocorticoid receptor by progesterone (rare).
• Phaeochromocytoma: may occur with one of the following:
• Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A: mutations in the RET
proto-oncogene. Autosomal dominant. Phaeochromocytoma,
medullary thyroid carcinoma, and hyperparathyroidism.
• von Hippel–Lindau disease (b p. 745).
• Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1: mutations in the NF1 tumour
suppressor gene, autosomal dominant. Presents with
phaeochromocytomas, multiple neuroﬁbromas, café-au-lait spots,
Lisch nodules of the iris.

PATHOGENESIS: GENETICS, ARTERIAL STIFFNESS, AND SNS

Arterial stiffness
Arterial pressure depends in part on the compliance of conduit arteries.
Stiff arteries are less able to dampen a surge in pressure during systole, so
systolic pressure is higher. A stiffer artery will also conduct a pulse wave
more rapidly. Normally, the pulse wave is reﬂected back from the small
vessels, arriving back at the heart during diastole. If conducted more rapidly, the reﬂected pulse wave may reach the heart during systole, further
i systolic pressure and d diastolic pressure. Coronary artery perfusion,
which occurs predominantly during diastole, may be affected.
Commoner causes of reduced compliance (or i stiffness) include:
• Ageing: loss of elastin, calciﬁcation of arterial walls, lipid deposition,
and defective endothelial function all contribute.
• Diabetes: i arterial stiffness is accelerated (even if i BP is absent) s
to non-enzymatic glycosylation of connective tissue, high insulin levels
9 activation of the sympathetic nervous system.
• CKD, esp. ESRD: oxidant stress, impaired endothelial function,
abnormal lipid proﬁle, calciﬁcation of the arterial wall (exacerbated
by disordered mineral metabolism), and a variety of putative uraemic
toxins all contribute (b p. 212).
1 Increased arterial stiffness and pulse wave velocity are independent predictors of all-cause mortality and CV morbidity and mortality in patients
with i BP.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
There has been considerable recent interest in the role of the SNS in i BP,
with the development of techniques to reduce sympathetic activity. These
include renal denervation with radiofrequency energy and baroreceptor
activation therapy (b p. 514).
Activation of the SNS is clearly linked with acute i BP—chronic activation may have a role in the genesis of long-term i BP in those with a
genetic predisposition.
SNS activation causes:
• i in stroke volume (via A-1 and -2 receptors).
• i in heart rate (via B-1 receptors).
• i in systemic vascular resistance (via A-1 receptors).
• Activation of the RAS (via B-1 receptor-mediated renin release).

455

456

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Pathogenesis: RAS and other factors
The renin–angiotensin system (RAS)
Plays a central role in salt and water homeostasis, and 6 BP control. An important therapeutic target (ACE-I, ARBs, renin inhibitors) (b pp. 508–511).
Granular cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus synthesize and release
renin. Renin converts inactive angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which,
in turn, is converted by ACE in the lungs to active angiotensin II (A2). A2
binds two receptors AT-1 and -2 (b p. 510).
Renin release is mediated by:
• d afferent arteriolar (i.e. renal perfusion) pressure of any cause.
• Sympathetic nervous system activation (granular cell B-1 receptors).
• d Na+ delivery to the distal tubule (sensed by the macula densa).
• Prostacyclin, ACTH.

Causes of i renin
•
•
•
•
•
•

Sympathetic stimulation.
Renal artery stenosis.
Renal cell carcinoma.
Benign reninoma (very rare).
Other renin-secreting malignancies (also very rare).
Many antihypertensives, including CCBs and diuretics.

2 Many patients with essential hypertension have i plasma renin levels
not related to any of the listed causes, nor of any therapeutic relevance.
Angiotensin
Circulating
A2 binds vascular receptors, but locally released A2 works at tissue level in
a paracrine fashion. Tissue concentrations do not correlate with systemic
levels but may correlate better with disease pathogenesis.

Actions of angiotensin II
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Arteriolar vasoconstriction (and venular constriction to a lesser extent).
Efferent renal arteriolar vasoconstriction.
Aldosterone secretion.
Adrenaline (epinephrine) release.
Smooth muscle hypertrophy.
Increased reabsorption of sodium in PCT.
Inhibits renin release (negative feedback loop).
Renal mesangial cell growth and matrix expansion.
Myocardial growth and matrix expansion.
Stimulates thirst and ADH release.

Most effects are mediated by the angiotensin type 1 (AT-1) receptor.
The role of AT-2 receptors remains unclear, but ligand binding may
regulate vasodilator, proliferative, and apoptotic effects of A2.

PATHOGENESIS: RAS AND OTHER FACTORS

Aldosterone
Aldosterone synthesis occurs mainly in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex and is tightly regulated by the RAS and electrolyte homeostasis
(i K+ or d Na+ intake l aldosterone synthesis).
Aldosterone acts at the collecting duct to promote Na+ retention
and K+ excretion (b p. 930). Cortisol also activates the mineralocorticoid receptor—so aldosterone-sensitive tissues contain high levels of
11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (converts cortisol l cortisone,
which is incapable of activating the receptor), protecting the mineralocorticoid receptor from states of high circulating cortisol.

Extrarenal actions of aldosterone
• Paracrine action in non-epithelial tissues (brain, heart, epithelium).
• Associated with vascular inﬂammation and cardiac ﬁbrosis. The same
may be true in non-vascular tissues.
• Activates pro-ﬁbrotic and growth factors in several tissues (including
the kidney).

Other factors
• There is much redundancy in the control of BP. Many neuroendocrine
systems contribute to it in overlapping and interlocking ways—and
any (or all) of these may lead to abnormal BP.
• Insulin resistance has a clear relationship with i BP:
• Fasting insulin and glucose levels correlate with BP in
insulin-resistant patients.
• Relatives of those with i BP are more likely to have insulin
resistance.
• Insulin resistance predicts the subsequent development of i BP.
• Mechanisms may include SNS activation and Na+ retention.
• Natriuretic peptides, including:
• ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide). Released by atrial tissue in
response to stretch, i.e. volume overload.
• BNP (brain natriuretic peptide). First discovered in the brain but
synthesized and secreted by ventricular myocardium.
• CNP (C-type) and DNP (Dendroaspis). More recently
discovered. Relevance not yet clear (DNP was ﬁrst discovered in
the venom of the green mamba snake. Its subsequent detection
in the plasma of humans is of uncertain signiﬁcance. It may play a
part in the diuresis associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage).
• Urodilatin. Similar structure to ANP but conﬁned to the kidney.
Synthesized in distal tubular cells, causing natriuresis.
The natriuretic peptides are secreted in response to volume overload,
leading to a compensatory natriuretic effect. Other effects include vasodilation, modulation of vascular smooth muscle function, and control of
the RAS system. Their role in the pathogenesis of i BP is less clear. In
experimental studies, defects in natriuretic peptide production appear
to cause salt-sensitive i BP.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

BP measurement
Clinic readings
• Gold standard is mercury sphygmanometer. However, environmental
concerns about mercury contamination have led to its gradual
disappearance from clinical practice.
• Substitutes (aneroid sphygmanometers or oscillometric automated
devices) are now preferred.
• Semi-automated devices may not measure BP accurately in some
clinical conditions, e.g. atrial ﬁbrillation. Palpate the radial/brachial
pulse before measuring, and, if irregular, measure BP, using a manual
device.
• Validation and maintenance are vital: for a list of approved apparatus,
see M http://www.bhsoc.org for British Hypertension Society or
M http://www.heart.org for American Heart Association.
Examiner's technique is vital
1 Even a relatively small error in BP measurement could result in inappropriate under- or overtreatment.
• Standing BP should be recorded, esp. during the initial assessment of
elderly or diabetic patients.
• Measure in both arms. If there is a signiﬁcant difference (>20mmHg),
then repeat. Measure subsequently in the arm with the higher value.
• Place cuff 1–2cm above the antecubital fossa.
• Select appropriate cuff size. Cuff bladder width should be 40% and
length 80% of arm. The standard adult bladder is 12 x 26cm (although
some consider 12 x 35cm standard).
• Cuff too large l underestimation.
• Cuff too small l overestimation.
• Inﬂate cuff whilst palpating the radial artery to estimate SBP. Inﬂate
cuff to 30mmHg above estimated SBP.
• Deﬂate at 2mmHg/s, listening to Korotkoff phase I (appearance) for
SBP and phase V (disappearance) for DBP. If phase V goes to zero, use
phase IV (mufﬂing).
• Take two measurements 1–2min apart, and read to the nearest
2mmHg (round off upwards).
• Document the time of measurement in relation to tablets.
• Do not round up or down to preconceived values (observer’s
prejudice).

Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM)
Now recommended in the UK by the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) for the diagnosis of i BP (daytime). Daytime
ambulatory BP correlates better with target organ damage (TOD) than
clinic BP and provides a more accurate diagnosis of i BP. Day, night, and
24-hour BP measurements are recorded and are usually lower than clinic
measurements (see Table 6.1 and Fig. 6.3). The patient should refrain
from strenuous exercise and straightening their arm during measurement
(tricky if driving) and should keep a concomitant diary, e.g. sleep times.
For an accurate result, two measurements per hour during the day, with a

BP MEASUREMENT

minimum of 14 measurements, are required. Several limitations, including
cost, lack of outcome data for patients already on treatment, and acceptability to patients, still limit use.
Indications for ABPM
• If clinic BP is >140/90mmHg or higher.
• Possible white coat effect or white coat hypertension.
• Resistant i BP.
• When BP unusually variable.
• To identify nocturnal hypertension.
• Symptoms suggestive of hypotension.
• Diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in pregnancy.

Time (hours)

Fig. 6.3 Example of variation in daytime and night-time BP.
Look for the following characteristics:
• Nocturnal dipping: mean wake systolic BP falls by at least 10% during
sleep. ‘Super’ dipping (20–30%) is associated with neurological
sequelae. Non-dipping, or reverse dipping, is associated with increased
CV mortality and TOD.
• Masked i BP: normal clinic BP but elevated ABPM. Associated with
higher prevalence of TOD.

459

460

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

• White coat hypertension: elevated clinic BP, with normal ABPM
and no evidence of TOD. Increased prevalence with i age, milder
hypertension (10–30% grade 1, <10% grades 2 and 3). Associated
with increased CV risk. In hypertensive patients, known as ‘white coat
effect’. Target ABPM for treated patients is <135/85 aged under 80,
<145/85 aged over 80.

Home
Can be used as an alternative to ABPM for the diagnosis of i BP.
When conﬁrming hypertension using home BP
• Take two consecutive measurements for each BP recording, at least
1min apart.
• Record BP twice daily (morning and evening).
• Take readings for at least 4 days (ideally, 7 days).
• Discard the ﬁrst day’s measurements.
• Use the average value of all the remaining measurements.
When treating hypertension using home BP
• Management of BP, according to home measurements, in individuals
already receiving treatment is not backed by robust evidence.
• Home BP monitors are often inaccurate. The British Hypertension
Society has a list of validated machines on their website (M http://
www.bhsoc.org).
• Patients are more likely to reach target BP with home BP monitoring
but will need the same number of tablets to do so.
• It can be very helpful to involve patients in their own management.
• Helpful in those with white coat effect where the target BP is:
• Aged below 80 <135/85mmHg.
• Aged over 80 <145/85mmHg.

Blood pressure variability
• A recent series of analyses have recently been published, showing
that excessive variability in BP is an independent risk factor for CVD.
• Variability in SBP is a strong predictor of stroke (independent of
mean SBP).
• In treated i BP, this variability is associated with a higher risk of
vascular events.
• BP variability is measured as the standard deviation of mean BP.
• Not clear if causation, or marker, of vascular disease.
• The different classes of antihypertensive agent vary in their capacity
to inﬂuence this BP variability.
• CCBs and thiazide-like diuretics are the most effective at reducing
variability.
• Older and black patients are more likely to have i SBP variability.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Clinical assessment
There are four fundamental questions to consider:
• Is this sustained hypertension?
• Is this primary or secondary hypertension?
• Are there other cardiovascular risk factors?
• Is there target organ disease?
Management of an individual patient will depend on these factors.

History and examination
•
•
•
•

Duration of elevated BP. Previous monitoring, treatment, and control.
Previous drug treatment and side effects.
Contraindications to speciﬁc drugs, e.g. bronchospasm.
Family history: i BP, stroke, diabetes, i lipids, renal disease,
premature IHD.
• Previous history of pre-eclampsia or hypertension during pregnancy?
• Is this primary or secondary hypertension (b p. 474)? The following
may suggest a secondary cause:
• Young age (<30 years, esp. if no FH and Caucasian).
• Sudden-onset hypertension.
• Presents as malignant hypertension (b p. 518).
• Acute rise with previously stable BP control.
• Severe or ‘resistant’ (≥3 drugs) hypertension.
• Other diagnostic clues (b p. 475)?
• Other contributory factors? Other cardiovascular risk factors?
• Drugs (NSAIDs, decongestants, cocaine, amphetamines).
• Obesity.
• Excess alcohol.
• Salt intake.
• Lack of exercise.
• Environmental stress.
• Smoking.
• Cholesterol.

Is there target organ damage?
2 Think Brain, Eyes, Heart, Arteries, Kidneys.
• Stroke, TIA, cognitive decline.
• Fundi: hypertensive retinopathy. Grades 1 and 2 (silver wiring and
AV nipping) are common. Grades 3 and 4 (haemorrhage, exudates,
papilloedema) carry a signiﬁcantly increased risk of stroke, CV
disease, and CCF and require urgent treatment (b p. 522).
• LVH, IHD, cardiomegaly, CCF.
• Peripheral vascular disease: look for bruits—carotid, femoral, renal.
• Renal impairment, proteinuria, microscopic haematuria.
• Sexual dysfunction.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

Investigations
Routine
• Urinalysis (? protein ± blood).
• SCr, eGFR, U&E, Ca2+.
• Blood glucose—preferably fasting.
• Lipid proﬁle—preferably fasting.
• ECG for LVH (i LV strain l higher risk) and/or evidence of IHD.
For selected patients
• Echocardiogram.
• Urine protein evaluation: uACR or uPCR (if dipstick proteinuria).
• Hb and Hct (polycythaemia).
• Bicarbonate (hypokalaemic alkalosis?).
• Thyroid function.
• Ferritin (haemochromatosis).
• ESR and CRP.
• Uric acid (i in metabolic syndrome).
• Plasma renin and aldosterone.
• Plasma and urine metanephrines.
• 24h urinary sodium.
• BP in lower limbs: hypertensive aged <40; older patient ? PVD.
• Research investigations: vascular USS, pulse wave velocity,
assessment of endothelial function.

Hypertension

Classiﬁcation and treatment
thresholds
There are many different classiﬁcations and guidelines, but all use similar
BP targets (themselves based on evidence regarding CV outcomes). The
most important are those provided by:
• The British Hypertension Society (BHS) and National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE)—a collaborative UK guideline.
• The European Society of Hypertension-European Society of
Cardiology (ESH-ESC).
• The Joint National Committee (JNC) (USA).
• Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) (i BP in the
context of renal disease).
All draw on the results of large randomized controlled trials and metaanalyses to formulate their recommendations.

BHS/NICE guideline
The 2011 guidelines from BHS/NICE classify BP into stage 1, stage 2 and
severe. They were also the ﬁrst to use ambulatory (ABPM) and home BP
(HBPM) measurements.

NICE/BHS primary hypertension targets (2011)
Clinic BP
• <140/90mmHg in people aged <80 years.
• <150/90mmHg in people aged ≥80 years.
Daytime average ABPM or average HBPM during waking hours
• <135/85mmHg in people aged <80 years.
• <145/85mmHg in people aged ≥80 years.

Overview
Offer lifestyle interventions and patient education to all.
Stage 1 hypertension
Clinic BP ≥140/90 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or
HBPM average BP ≥135/85 mmHg.
• Offer antihypertensive drug treatment if:
• TOD.
• Established CV disease.
• 10-year CV risk ≥20% (see b p. 470).
• DM.
• CKD.
• Annual review.
• If aged <40 years, consider more detailed evaluation of TOD and
specialist referral (traditional CV risk calculators may underestimate
lifetime risk).

CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT THRESHOLDS

Stage 2 hypertension
Clinic blood pressure ≥160/100 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime
average or HBPM average BP is ≥150/95 mmHg.
• Offer antihypertensive drug treatment.
• Offer lifestyle interventions and patient education.
• Annual review.
Severe hypertension
Clinic systolic BP ≥180mmHg or diastolic BP ≥110mmHg.
• Start hypertensive drug immediately. Do not wait for ABPM.
• Refer for specialist care immediately if:
• Accelerated hypertension (grade 3 or 4 hypertensive retinopathy).
• Cardiovascular complications.
• New renal impairment, haemoproteinuria.
• Suspected phaeochromocytoma (b p. 482).
If hypertension is not diagnostic
Clinic blood pressure is ≥140/90 mmHg or higher but subsequent ABPM
or HBPM average BP is ≤135/85 mmHg.
• Measure BP at least every 5 years.
• If TOD, look for alternative causes.

CBPM ≥140/90mmHg

Summary of ESH-ESC treatment guidelines 2013
• Prompt initiation of drug treatment is recommended in individuals with
grade 2 and 3 i BP with any level of CV risk, a few weeks after (or
simultaneous to) initiation of lifestyle changes.
• Lowering BP with drugs is recommended when total CV risk is high
because of TOD, DM, CVD or CKD, even for grade 1 i BP
• Initiation of drug treatment should also be considered for grade 1
patients at low to moderate risk when BP is within this range at several
repeated visits, or elevated by ambulatory BP criteria - and remains
within this range despite a reasonable period of lifestyle measures.

CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT THRESHOLDS

• Drug treatment is recommended in elderly patients (age >60) when
SBP is ≥160mmHg. However, treatment should also be considered in
this group (esp. if age <80) if SBP is in the 150–160mmHg range, provided that it is well tolerated. This recommendation in the elderly is an
important change from previous ESH-ESC guidelines.
• A high normal BP should not be treated with antihypertensive drug
therapy.
• Young individuals with isolated elevation of brachial SBP should not
be treated (due to a lack of evidence), but should be followed closely
with appropriate lifestyle recommendations.
• Treatment should target a BP <140/90mmHg. A lower target of
<130/80mmHg in patients with CKD, diabetes or a CV disease is no
longer recommended as it is not adequately supported by evidence
from RCTs.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Joint National Committee (JNC) guideline
The latest iteration of this inﬂuential guideline has been delayed by an
unprecedented degree of prerelease stakeholder scrutiny. However,
it is expected that JNC 8 (or JNC ‘late’ as it has been dubbed) may,
like ESH-ESC, offer a more stringent interpretation of available data—
retaining a goal of 140/90mmHg for the majority, but suggesting higher
targets may be acceptable for many patients age >60 (and particularly
age >80). JNC 8 may also echo ESH-ESC by offering a more circumspect view of lower treatment targets (<130/80mmHg) in the presence
of comorbidities such as diabetes and CKD.
The current status is available at: M http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/
guidelines/hypertension/jnc8/

KDIGO
• Recommend a BP target <140/90mmHg for non-diabetic, nonproteinuric CKD patients
• Target <130/80mmHg if proteinuria (>30mg/24h) whether diabetic
or not.
• Tailor treatment regimes for individual elderly patients by carefully
considering age, co-morbidities and other therapies. Escalate treatment
carefully under appropriate supervision.

X The J-curve phenomenon
The question ‘how low to go?’ remains both valid and important. It is
possible that there may be a threshold below which additional BP reduction is no longer beneﬁcial. This could be explained by the maintenance
of physiological autoregulation within organ vascular beds, particularly in
the presence of CV disease.
The data supporting a ‘lower the better’ approach have come from
meta-analyses of multiple trials, rather than from studies speciﬁcally
designed to scrutinize different target ranges. Indeed, some trials, such
as ACCORD, have shown no consistent reduction in CV events, even
when lower average SBPs are achieved. Furthermore, it has been inferred from some studies; e.g. ONTARGET that lower BP targets may
actually be associated with additional coronary events.
Many interpret the J-curve relationship to mean that BP reduction
to lower levels, even if not harmful, is certainly less meaningful than a
reduction to more moderate values.
These issues are reﬂected in the latest iterations of the guidelines
discussed above, which have become more guarded in their recommendation of lower targets, even in high-risk groups.
Overall, current evidence suggests that, even if escalating therapy
to achieve the lowest possible BP is not clearly detrimental, neither is
it clearly advantageous—it may not ∴ be cost effective, with patients
unnecessarily exposed to side effects that inﬂuence their overall
compliance.

CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT THRESHOLDS

Suggested indications for specialist referral
• Urgent (inpatient) treatment needed:
• Accelerated hypertension (severe i BP, with grades III–IV
retinopathy).
• Particularly severe hypertension (>220/120mmHg).
• Hypertensive emergency (e.g. encephalopathy, eclampsia, aortic
dissection).
• Impending complications (e.g. LVF, TIA).
• Possible s hypertension.
• Resistance to treatment (≥3 drugs).
• Multiple drug intolerances.
• Multiple drug contraindications.
• Persistent non-adherence or non-compliance.
• Other situations:
• Unusual blood pressure variability.
• Possible white coat hypertension.
• Hypertension in pregnancy.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Cardiovascular risk assessment
Formal assessment of CV risk is the starting point for treatment decisions
and discussions between clinicians and patients. The ultimate goal of the
treatment of hypertension is prevention of CV disease.
• The absolute risk of a CV event varies widely according to age, sex,
severity of BP, and presence or absence of additional risk factors. The
relative risk reduction of interventions is constant. Overprediction l
overtreatment, underprediction l missed opportunity.
• Estimation of risk is straightforward in many patients; e.g. those with
established CV disease, diabetes, CKD or a signiﬁcantly elevated
single risk factor. In these situations CV risk is high and aggressive
intervention highly desirable.
• Many patients, however, do not belong to such high-risk groups and
estimation of risk requires the use of risk-prediction models.
• Many computerized models have been developed. None are perfect.
They aim to identify patients for intervention and calculate potential
risk reduction.
• Many are based on Framingham data*. However, Framingham
studied a Caucasian, middle class population on no treatment
(i.e. no aspirin, statins etc.) and is several decades old. See www.
framinghamheartstudy.org/risk
• Framingham-based scoring tends to overestimate CV risk in low
and medium risk groups and underestimate CV risk in renal disease,
diabetes, certain ethnic groups, those with LVH and those with FH of
premature CHD. It has ∴ been suggested that the risk score should
be adjusted by a factor of x 1.5 if there is one relative with premature
CVD and by x 1.4 if the individual is a male of South Asian origin.
• Many models refer to 10-year risk of CV mortality. High risk refers to
10-year CV mortality of ≥20%.
• The Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) model has been
developed from large European cohort studies. It allows calibration for
several different countries and is recommended by ESH-ESC. An interactive version of SCORE is available through www.heartscore.org.
• ASSIGN (www.assign-score.com) is based on Scottish data and takes
FH and social deprivation into account.
• There is a move toward estimations of lifetime rather than 10-year
risk. For example, the QRISK lifetime risk calculator identiﬁes younger
patients with high lifetime risk (deﬁned as >50%) who would not be
identiﬁed using 10-year risk estimates. (www.qrisk.org).
• The prediction of lifetime risk is recommended by the Joint British
Societies (see http://www.jbs3risk.com).
• Risk calculators may not be appropriate when individuals are at higher
CV risk because of underlying medical conditions/treatments (e.g. HIV,
autoimmune disease).
• Clinical judgement is important when making decisions in certain
circumstances (e.g. obesity, taking statins, already on BP treatment,
recently stopped smoking).
*
The Framingham Heart Study: a cohort of over 5,000 men and women, aged 30–62, from
Framingham, Massachusetts, followed up from 1971 to assess the determinants of CV disease.

CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSESSMENT

When you don’t need a risk calculator:
Assume the following groups of people are at high risk (10-year CVD
risk ≥20%), rather than use risk calculators:
• Pre-existing CVD.
• DM.
• CKD.
• Familial hypercholesterolaemia.

471

472

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Lifestyle measures
Lifestyle changes can d BP, reduce drug requirements, and improve CV
risk (see Table 6.5). The effects are synergistic. Clear advice, including
culturally appropriate written and audiovisual material, should be provided
to all patients as well as to those with a high normal (pre-hypertensive) BP
or positive family history.

Low-sodium diet
Reduces BP in normotensive and hypertensive populations. Enhances
response to ACE-I/ARB treatment. Usual Na+ intake is in the range
150–200mmol/day (8–12g/day). Reduce by as much as possible; at least
<100mmol/day (72.3g of Na+ or 6g NaCl). The majority (80%) of salt is
‘hidden’ (breads, stock cubes, ‘ready meals’, breakfast cereals, sauces).
Avoid salt in cooking and on the table. Cook using natural ingredients.
Dietary sodium can be estimated by 24h urine Na (aim <100mmol/24h).
If necessary, refer to a dietitian. Note: 1g of Na+ contains 44meq, 1g of
NaCl contains 17meq of Na+; 5g of NaCl 71 teaspoon. Patients should be
advised that, with time, their taste sensitivity to salt will increase if they
undertake a restriction.
1 Low Na+ salt substitutes often contain K+ as KCl and can cause dangerous hyperkalaemia in patients with CKD and those taking K+-sparing
diuretics.

Weight loss

Obesity (BMI ≥30) is fuelling the increasing incidence of i BP and T2DM.
Weight reduction improves BP, even without dietary Na+ restriction, and
has beneﬁcial effects on insulin resistance, lipids, LVH, and diabetic control.

Healthy eating
Advise a diet high in fruit and vegetables (ﬁve portions/day), low in
saturated fats, low in total and saturated fats. The ‘Dietary Approach to
Hypertension Trial’ (DASH) demonstrated impressive reductions in BP.
The DASH eating plan can be downloaded at: M http://www.nhlbi.nih.
gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash. K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ supplementation is
not recommended.

Exercise
Exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of DM and decrease BP by
up to 10mmHg.
2 Think ‘FITT’ (Frequency (5x/week), Intensity (moderate, mildly SOB),
Time (at least 30min), Type (any aerobic). Isometric and strenuous exercise tends to i BP and is best avoided until BP is under control.

Alcohol
There is a linear relationship between C2H5OH consumption and BP, with
the incidence of i BP increasing 71.5–2.0x at >2 drinks/day. It is also associated with drug resistance. Patients will, no doubt, remind you of the
apparent paradox that moderate alcohol intake reduces overall CV risk;

LIFESTYLE MEASURES

however, recommended daily amounts should not be exceeded (♂: <21
units/week; ♀: <14 units/week). The effect of C2H5OH is reversible; d
alcohol intake by 3 units/day ld need for medication (in 71–6 weeks).

Caffeine
Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist (l vasoconstriction). >5
cups coffee/day is undesirable. It causes an immediate increase in SBP by
710–15mmHg for several hours. Caffeine is also present in tea and cola
drinks, although coffee only has been studied. Recommend decaffeinated
alternatives.

Stress management
Modest effect, e.g. meditation, cognitive therapy, biofeedback, muscle
relaxation, etc. If patients are keen, cognitive behavioural therapy is most
likely to have a signiﬁcant impact.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Secondary hypertension
An identiﬁable cause is found in 75–10% of all cases of i BP, though true
prevalence of secondary hypertension remains unknown. It is more common in the subgroup of ‘resistant’ hypertension (b p. 516).
History, examination, routine investigation (plus a high index of suspicion) should identify those in need of more specialist assessment. The
diagnosis of secondary hypertension is important to make, as curative
treatment may be available.
Diagnostic clues are shown in Table 6.6.

Classiﬁcation
• Renal disorders (for i BP in CKD, see b p. 203–4):
• Virtually any renal parenchymal disease: acute or chronic GN,
tubulointerstitial disease, APKD, obstructive nephropathy.
• Renovascular disease (b p. 586).
• Renin-producing tumours (b p. 479).
• Genetic diseases affecting tubular transport (Liddle’s syndrome,
b p. 800). Very rare.
• Endocrine disorders:
• Mineralocorticoid excess (b p. 476): p aldosteronism, apparent
mineralocorticoid excess, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, liquorice
ingestion, ectopic ACTH secretion, exogenous mineralocorticoids
(e.g. ﬂudrocortisone), pseudohyperaldosteronism.
• Others, including phaeochromocytoma, Cushing’s syndrome,
hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism (i SBP), hyperparathyroidism,
acromegaly, or carcinoid syndrome.

agents (cold cures), glucocorticoids, NSAIDs (and COX-2
inhibitors), ciclosporin, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, sodium
bicarbonate.
• Over the counter: sympathomimetic agents, NSAIDs.
• Illicit: amphetamines, cocaine.
• Pregnancy (b p. 846):
• Pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia.
• Miscellaneous:
• Obstructive sleep apnoea.
• Coarctation of the aorta (d renal perfusion).
• Increased intracranial pressure or spinal cord injury.
• Acute LVF and intravascular volume overload (IV ﬂuids!).
• Acute intermittent porphyria.
• Alcohol withdrawal.
• Haemochromatosis.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Primary hyperaldosteronism
Introduction
Aldosterone acts on the distal tubule to i renal Na+ retention (with i
urinary K+ and H+ loss), i total body Na+ content (li BP). Disorders
of autonomous aldosterone secretion with suppressed renin account for
70.1% of the hypertensive population (possibly an underestimate, some say
1–5%) and is the most common endocrine disorder leading to s hypertension. It is also associated with i CV risk beyond that expected by the
level of BP alone.
Clinical and biochemical ﬁndings vary widely. Often asymptomatic but
may present with d K+, metabolic alkalosis, and mild i Na+ (helps distinguish from essential BP treated with diuretics where Na+ is usually low
normal). However, dd K+ with diuretics (<3.0mmol/L) remains suspicious.
Severe d K+l tetany, myopathy, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
(polyuria and nocturia).

Causes
• Conn’s syndrome (aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma) 770%.
• Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia 730%.
• Aldosterone-producing adrenal carcinoma (ii aldosterone and dd
K+—may also produce cortisol and sex steroids).
• Primary (unilateral) adrenal hyperplasia.
• Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism.

Diagnosis
• d K+ is only present in 50–80% early on (leading to underdiagnosis).
• Renal K+ wasting (urinary K+>30mmol/day).
• Aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR):
• Commonly used diagnostic test (see Box 6.2).
• Unregulated aldosterone secretion l suppressed renin production
and i ARR.
• Note i BP in the malignant phase often has electrolyte abnormalities
similar to primary hyperaldosteronism, i.e. d K+, i HCO3–. ARR is not
interpretable at this stage so should not be done in this acute setting.
There is no gold standard test for p hyperaldosteronism. Conﬁrmatory
tests include:
• Oral or IV salt loading:
• High Na+ diet for 3 days (200mmol/day—ask your dietitian) or IV
normal saline (2L over 4h).
• Verify with urinary Na+>250mmol/24h.
• Measure 24h urinary aldosterone. Normal response: suppressed
aldosterone secretion (l lack of suppression conﬁrms diagnosis).
• 1 May precipitate d K+; supplement with slow-release KCl.
• Fludrocortisone suppression test: 4-day administration of
ﬂudrocortisone further suppresses plasma renin activity without
suppressing plasma aldosterone below a threshold value.

PRIMARY HYPERALDOSTERONISM

• A captopril challenge test fails to suppress aldosterone >30% in
primary hyperaldosteronism.
• Adrenal CT and MRI are used to localize tumours (>1.5cm).
• 1 Never order imaging before conﬁrming secretion.
• Never assume a radiologically apparent adrenal adenoma conﬁrms the
laterality of secretions if planning adrenalectomy.
• Adrenal venous sampling is occasionally necessary—the distinction
between a discrete adenoma and diffuse hyperplasia is important
because of the potential role of surgery in the former.

General principles of treatment
Spironolactone (a competitive antagonist of the mineralocorticoid
receptor, b p. 501), initially 50–100mg (SE: gynaecomastia, impotence,
menstrual irregularities, GI upset). Eplerenone is an alternative but less
effective. Add amiloride 5–20mg if d K+ persists or gynaecomastia. Other
antihypertensive agents may also be required. Surgical resection if adenoma: 70% normotensive at 1 year (X results less good in some series—
esp. if BP long-standing). Some argue for a trial of spironolactone in all
cases of resistant hypertension (b p. 516).

Box 6.2 ARR: the nuts and bolts
• Correct hypokalaemia (d K+ suppresses aldosterone). Encourage
liberal sodium intake.
• Tubes: liaise with your biochemistry lab—usually one plain tube or
lithium tube for aldosterone and one EDTA tube for renin. They will
deﬁnitely want to know that the samples are coming. Now generally
NOT placed on ice (promotes conversion of inactive l active renin).
• Withdraw agents that markedly affect ARR for at least 4
weeks (spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride, triamterene,
potassium-wasting diuretics). This can be difﬁcult.
• If it is possible to control BP with other medications, withdraw drugs
that may affect the ARR for at least 2 weeks (B-blockers, ACE-I,
ARB, diuretics). This can also be difﬁcult.
• The ‘cleanest’ drugs are A-blockers, e.g. doxazosin. Hydralazine and
verapamil also have minimal effects of ARR.
• Establish oral contraceptive and HRT status.
• Conditions for collection blood:
• Time: 07.00–09.00.
• Posture: upright (for at least 2h).
• Maintain sample at room temperature.
• Result: aldosterone (pmol/L)/plasma renin activity (ng/mL/h) >750
or aldosterone (ng/dL)/plasma renin activity (ng/mL/h) >30–50.
The higher the ratio, the more likely the diagnosis.
• Refer equivocal cases to a specialist centre.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Speciﬁc causes of
hyperaldosteronism
Primary hyperaldosteronism
Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA)
Very rare. Autosomal dominant. A chimeric aldosterone synthase/
11B-hydroxylase is ectopically expressed in the adrenal fasciculata. ACTH
l stimulates enzyme activity l normal cortisol production + aldosterone excess (l volume expansion and i BP). Presents with i BP at a
young age, with a family history (early haemorrhagic stroke in some
pedigrees). Diagnosis (see Fig. 6.5) now conﬁrmed with genetic testing.
Dexamethasone l suppresses ACTH secretion ld enzyme activity ld
aldosterone production.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
Inherited enzymatic defects (autosomal recessive) in cortisol production.
Clinical features depend on the enzyme affected but result from: (i) d cortisol synthesis, (ii) i ACTH-driven steroid production. Two forms (of six)
are associated with mineralocorticoid excess and 6i BP:
• 11B-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) deﬁciency, presenting in childhood; ♀ are
virilized, and ♂ are sexually precocious.
• 17A-hydroxylase (CYP17) deﬁciency. Extremely rare. Presents with
i BP, d K+, and hypogonadism—often at puberty.

Secondary hyperaldosteronism
• Occurs when aldosterone hypersecretion results from i circulating
renin levels—often in response to renal hypoperfusion.
• i renin li circulating A2, i peripheral resistance, and i BP (often
severe).
• Associated s hyperaldosteronism li tubular Na+ reabsorption
(6d K+).
• Causes include:
• Renal artery stenosis.
• Renal infarction, e.g. atheroemboli.
• Cirrhosis (vasodilatation ld effective circulating volume).
• CCF (falling CO ld effective circulating volume).
• Nephrotic syndrome.
• Renal trauma (so-called ‘Page kidney’) (b p. 84).
• Renin-secreting tumours (see Box 6.3).

SPECIFIC CAUSES OF HYPERALDOSTERONISM

Box 6.3 Renin-secreting tumours
• Very rare.
• Renin-secreting tumour of the juxtaglomerular cells l
angiotensin-induced i BP.
• Presents with severe i BP, d K+ (i urinary K+ excretion), i renin, i
angiotensin II, and i aldosterone.
• Diagnosis: MRA, angiography (tumour blush).
• Treatment: ACE-I and ARBs effectively d BP.
• Surgery may be curative.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Other ‘hyperaldosteronism’
syndromes
Other mineralocorticoids can cause a clinical syndrome very similar to
that seen with i aldosterone—with i BP, d K+, and alkalosis. Crucially,
both renin and aldosterone are suppressed.
• Causes include:
• Apparent mineralocorticoid excess.
• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
• Liquorice ingestion.
• Ectopic ACTH secretion.
• Exogenous mineralocorticoids, e.g. ﬂudrocortisone.

Apparent mineralocorticoid excess
<1% hypertensives. Autosomal recessive, presenting in childhood.
Inactivating mutation in 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2
(11BHSD2). The mineralocorticoid receptor (which has an equal afﬁnity
for cortisol and aldosterone) is protected from ongoing cortisol stimulation by 11BHSD2, which metabolizes cortisol l cortisone (relatively
inactive). As cortisol is present at 100-fold concentrations, compared to
aldosterone, absence/inhibition of this enzyme allows cortisol to ﬂood
the receptor l chronic activation.
Diagnosis
i ratio of urinary tetrahydrocortisol (THF + 5ATHF) (metabolite of cortisol) to tetrahydrocortisone (THE) (metabolite of cortisone).
Management
Block the mineralocorticoid receptor (spironolactone) or suppress
ACTH secretion (dexamethasone suppresses endogenous cortisol synthesis but does not activate the mineralocorticoid receptor).

Liquorice contains glycyrrhizinic acid, which can bind the 11BHSD2
enzyme, creating a state of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. Most commercial liquorice preparations in the UK do not contain large amounts,
but continental or ‘traditional’ preparations are stronger (and often are
combined with salt!). Also look out for it in herbal preparations.

‘Pseudoaldosteronism’
Caused by abnormalities of renal tubular transport, rather than elevated
renin or aldosterone. The electrolyte abnormalities mimic those seen with
i aldosterone, hence the name (b p. 800). Causes include:
• Liddle’s syndrome.
• Bartter’s syndrome (normotensive).
• Gitelman’s syndrome (normotensive).

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Other causes of secondary hypertension
Cushing's syndrome
Prevalence in hypertensive populations estimated at 0.5–1%. i BP is very
common, affecting 780%. Look for typical phenotype, and exclude exogenous glucocorticoids. 24h urinary cortisol excretion is a reliable diagnostic test (>110nmol/day is highly suggestive). Diagnosis conﬁrmed by a 2-day
low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (0.5mg every 6h for eight doses;
a cortisol drawn 4–6h after the last dose should be <140nmol/L) or an overnight suppression test (1mg at 23.00; cortisol should suppress to <50mmol/L).
Measurement of serum ACTH concentrations, a long dexamethasone suppression test ± corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test and
adrenal/pituitary imaging will help to distinguish different forms of the syndrome (Cushing’s disease most common: pituitary overproduction of ACTH).

Phaeochromocytoma
Adenoma (rarely carcinoma) of adrenal medulla l oversecretion of catecholamines (adrenaline li HR and contractility; noradrenaline li SVR).
Can also arise in extra-adrenal chromafﬁn tissue (e.g. para-aortic ganglia).
Very rare (<0.1% hypertensives). Consider if:
• Severe sustained and/or paroxysmal i BP refractory to therapy.
• Large postural drop.
• i BP + symptoms of catecholamine excess (headache, palpitations,
sweating, angina, anxiety, etc.)
• i BP triggered by B-blockade (s to unopposed A stimulation. Avoid if
suspected).
• Previous phaeochromocytoma (risk of recurrence).
Associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A or 2B, von
Hippel–Lindau disease, von Recklinghausen’s neuroﬁbromatosis.
Best tested during, or immediately after, episodes. The sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of various screening tests are shown in Table 6.7. Conﬁrm biochemically before imaging, usually 24h urine catecholamines x 3 (acidiﬁed container). CT/MRI identiﬁes most tumours. MIBG scanning localizes
tumours or multiple tumours/metastases (710% malignant). Treatment: Aand B-blockade prior to surgery.

OTHER CAUSES OF SECONDARY HYPERTENSION

Coarctation of the aorta
A rare cause of si BP in children and young adults. ♂>♀. Represents
<1% of congenital heart disease. Medial and neointimal thickening causes
a shelf-like structure to extend into the aortic lumen just distal to the
left subclavian artery. Often asymptomatic, may be diagnosed after CV
examination; midsystolic murmur, radiofemoral delay, i BP (arms > legs),
or CXR (aortic ‘3 sign’ from pre- and post-stenotic dilatation and posterior rib notching). If undetected in childhood, presents with cardiac failure in middle age and with a worse prognosis. Diagnosis: CT, MRA, or
aortography.
Treatment: surgical. BP correction is age-dependent (>90% in childhood).

Drug-induced hypertension
See b p. 474.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
The number of diagnosed and treated patients with OSA is rising rapidly.
i BP is commonly associated. Often treatment-resistant and associated
with a lack of nocturnal dipping on ABPM. Assess for daytime somnolence
(see Box 6.4).
Rx: treatment of the OSA improves BP. Weight reduction, alcohol
avoidance, correction of airway obstruction, oral prosthetic devices, overnight non-invasive ventilation, CPAP, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.

Box 6.4 Epworth sleepiness score
How likely are you to fall asleep in the following situations, in contrast
to just feeling tired?
1 = slight chance of dozing
2 = moderate chance of dozing
3 = high chance of dozing
1–6 points: normal; 7–8 points: average; 9–24 points: abnormal (?

Thyroid disease
• Hypothyroidism leads to i DBP, d cardiac output, d renin levels, and
narrow pulse pressure. It is salt-sensitive form of hypertension.
• Hyperthyroidism leads to i SVR and simulates i renin synthesis and
secretion, RAS activation, i blood volume, and i preload with a wide
pulse pressure.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Drug management of hypertension
Introduction
• The p goal of treatment is to achieve a reduction in long-term CV
morbidity and mortality risk.
• There is much debate on which medication to start when initiating
therapy. In practice, most will require ≥2 drugs to attain target.
• There is increasing popularity in Europe and the USA for using
combination therapy (l synergistic effect + better compliance). UK
physicians prescribe fewer combination pills than anywhere else in
Europe.
• Compliance improved by once-a-day formulations and by clearly
explaining the beneﬁts and potential side effects of drug treatment.
• Although marked interindividual variation in drug responses
reﬂects the heterogeneity of the pathogenesis of i BP, proﬁling
patients, according to their hypertensive phenotype with a view to
individualizing drug therapy, has proved difﬁcult (exceptions: the
elderly and ethnic groups).
• Drug withdrawal might be possible if other lifestyle interventions are
undertaken and prove successful.
• The patient may beneﬁt from joining local or national forums (e.g.
M http://www.bpassoc.org.uk).
• Once BP is adequately controlled, provide at least an annual review
for monitoring.
• The major drug groups are equally well tolerated. They are prescribed
in 7 equal amounts in primary care:
• Thiazide diuretics (b p. 498).
• ACE-I and ARBs (b p. 508–511).
• Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (b p. 506).
• B-blockers (b p. 502). In the UK, B-blockers have been
‘downgraded’ and are not recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy.
However, it largely depends on which guideline you follow.
• A-blockers are not recommended as ﬁrst line (b p. 504).
• X The optimal cardiovascular outcome is most consistently linked
with the level of BP control, rather than the class of drug used to
achieve it.
• In general, the lower the BP, the better. Patients will be accruing
beneﬁt, even if they do not achieve target BP.
• There are now generic versions of key medications, which has reduced
the cost of choosing many drugs.
• It is helpful to consider compelling indications and compelling
contraindications (see Table 6.8). There are also other less deﬁnite
pros and cons that will be assigned different importance by different
prescribers.
• Timing of therapy may be important. If more than one agent is used,
then having at least one dose at bedtime may improve circadian BP,
CV outcomes, and daytime BP control (this has been demonstrated
for both non-CKD and CKD populations in recent RCTs).

DRUG MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION

Aspirin and statins
Consider prescribing other drugs that modify CV risk.
• Aspirin 75mg od:
• p prevention in hypertensives aged >50 and 10-year CV risk
>20% and BP <150/90mmHg, with no contraindication.
• s prevention of CV disease.
• Statin therapy:
• p prevention in hypertensives with 10-year CV risk >20%.
• s prevention in all with overt CV disease, irrespective of baseline
total cholesterol or LDL. Targets: d total cholesterol by 25%
or LDL cholesterol by 30%, or achieve a total cholesterol of
<4.0mmol/L or LDL cholesterol of <2.0mmol/L (whichever is the
greatest reduction).

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Guidelines for drug treatment
Algorithms
Guidelines have become increasingly didactic, as previous less speciﬁc recommendations generally proved ineffective.
The British Hypertensive Society and NICE
Two key UK advisory bodies published updated guidelines in 2011 on
the treatment of hypertension (see Fig. 6.6). In the 2006 guidelines,
B-blockers were downgraded in response to evidence suggesting they
may be less effective at d major CV events (particularly stroke) than
other drug classes and that they have a higher diabetes risk than ACE-I
or CCBs (particularly in patients also taking a thiazide diuretic (b
p. 502)). In this recent update, there has been a change in the priority of
medications in people >55 years, with CCB as the ﬁrst-line choice, based
on event reduction and cost effectiveness. Thiazide-like diuretics (e.g.
indapamide) are suggested in those with heart failure or very elderly who
are intolerant of a CCB.
B-blockers can still be used as possible ﬁrst-line therapy in ♀ of childbearing potential and patients with evidence of i sympathetic drive.
Renin proﬁling demonstrates that younger people (<55 years) and
Caucasians have higher renin levels, reﬂecting an active RAS, relative to
elderly and black patients. Since ACE-I and ARBs act through RAS suppression, they are recommended as initial therapy in younger Caucasian
patients.
Recommendations (see algorithm in Fig. 6.6)
• Step 1:
• People aged <55: initial therapy with an ACE-I/low-cost ARB.
• People aged >55: initial therapy with a CCB.
• Black patients (any age): CCB (does not include mixed race,
subcontinental Indian, or Chinese patients).
• Step 2:
• Add ACE-I (or low-cost ARB) to CCB (or vice versa).
• Step 3:
• Before considering step 3 treatment, ensure step 2 treatment is at
optimal, or best tolerated, dose.
Compelling indications/contraindications should be taken into account
(b p. 486).

Recommendations in other guidelines
The ESH-ESC guideline advocates the initiation of a drug combination in
high-risk patients or in those with a signiﬁcantly elevated presenting BP.
It is thought that JNC 8 will take a similar view. In these circumstances,
combined therapy should offer a greater potential for achieving target
BP reduction and with fewer side effects than when maximizing the dose
of a single agent (see Fig. 6.7).

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

BP treatment: special situations
Hypertension in black patients
The prevalence of i BP and related complications, such as CHD, stroke
and renal disease, is higher in African Americans than other ethnic groups.
This holds true in the UK, with mortality data for England and Wales
showing mortality 3.5 x the national average. British Asians have a mortality rate 1.5 x the national average.
There is evidence of differential BP-lowering efﬁcacy of particular drugs
within ethnic groups, although the variability is greater within the groups
than between them. The recommendation of CCB in this group is based
on greater treatment effects, compared to ACE-I/ARB. If not tolerated,
diuretic therapy is useful, as there is a higher prevalence of salt-sensitive
i BP and increased salt and water retention likely to contribute to the
increased i BP. Black patients, in general, have a lower renin, and so agents
(ACE-I, ARB, and B-blockers) that suppress renin production may not
be as effective, especially when used as monotherapy. The International
Society of Hypertension in black people (M http://www.ishib.org) has
made recommendations for treatment and favour the initiation of combination therapy in individuals with more signiﬁcant hypertension.

Hypertension in the elderly
CHD and stroke remain the major killers in those aged >65, with BP the
commonest treatable risk factor.
SBP increases with age. DBP increases to age 60, plateaus, and then falls.
This leads to an age-related increase in pulse pressure and isolated SBP.
BP variability also increases 6 more measurements are desirable
prior to treatment. Using a relatively conservative deﬁnition of i BP
(≥160/95mmHg), it is estimated that >15% of the 12 million people aged
>60 in the UK are hypertensive (>70% aged ≥ 80). i BP in the elderly is
6 a major public health issue.
Clinical trials have shown that older people beneﬁt just as much, if not
more, from intervention as younger patients. A study of those ≥80 years
(Hypertension in the Very Elderly (HYVET), with target BP 150/80mmHg,
showed overwhelming CV beneﬁts from treatment.
1 This needs to be balanced against the risk of orthostatic hypertension
(l falls l fractures). You may need to titrate treatment to the standing BP
value, and DBP should not be reduced to <65mmHg.
Low renin hypertension is the norm, so begin treatment with a thiazide
or CCB. For second line, ACE-I/ARBs are demonstrably more effective
than B-blockers.
Other lifestyle interventions still apply.

BP TREATMENT: SPECIAL SITUATIONS

Oral contraceptives, HRT, and BP
Oral contraceptives
• The combined oral contraceptive (COC) modestly i BP in a
minority of women (71%). Occasionally, elevations may be severe.
The rise in BP may not become apparent for several months, or even
years, after COC introduction. The mechanism(s) of i BP remain
uncertain, and it has proved difﬁcult to identify women at particular
risk. COC use is also associated with increased stroke and MI risk.
• BP should be measured prior to COC use and at least every
6 months thereafter.
• Progestogen-only pills have not been associated with i BP and
are recommended for women with both COC-induced i BP and
pre-existing i BP. In those women wishing to remain on the COC,
antihypertensive medication should be given early consideration.
• For older women (aged >35) with higher CV risk (e.g. smokers),
non-hormonal forms of contraception are preferable.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
• HRT use is not associated with i BP, and its use is not
contraindicated in pre-existing hypertensives.
• Several large randomized trials have established that the CV
protection afforded by HRT has been overplayed previously and
should not be used as the motivation for their prescription.

492

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Clinical trials in hypertension
The beneﬁts of BP lowering are supported by one of the most authoritative evidence bases in clinical medicine. The foundation of this evidence
base is the prospective randomized clinical trial.

Trial designs
• Duration rarely >5 years.
• Endpoints:
• All-cause mortality.
• Cause speciﬁc morbidity and mortality (usually CHD ± stroke;
more recently, CCF).
• The ‘composite p endpoint’ has emerged (i.e. a combination of
events) because trials seldom have sufﬁcient power to examine
speciﬁc outcomes.
• Early trials compared active therapy with placebo, often among
patients with severe i BP. Consequently, they had high power and
could be conducted on a relatively small scale. Such trials became
unethical, as the beneﬁts of BP lowering became apparent.
• Modern ‘head-to-head’ trials tend to assess whether drug classes offer
advantages over others (drug companies are desperate to demonstrate
beneﬁts ‘beyond BP lowering’).
• BP differences between treatment arms now tend to be minimal,
6d study power and necessitating i patient numbers.
• Contemporary treatment objectives also inﬂuence trial design—most
patients now require multiple drugs to achieve target.
• The majority of patients at high CV risk will be receiving concomitant
treatment with aspirin ± a statin, further diminishing study power.
• Trials are hugely expensive.
• The data from clinical trials are often pooled for meta-analysis. This
can provide increased power to examine drug-speciﬁc effects.
• See Table 6.9 for recent major trials.

X Controversies
• Do speciﬁc classes of drugs offer beneﬁts for CV disease prevention
beyond the expected beneﬁts of BP lowering?
• There are marked drug-speciﬁc differences in their effect on
CV structure and function as well as metabolic endpoints. The
relevance of these effects on longer-term outcomes remains
unknown.
• Could certain classes of drugs be potentially harmful with regard
to speciﬁc outcomes?
• With regard to study design, can treatment be solely measured in
terms of CV events or is the real aim to prevent the evolution of a
destructive disease process?
• Clinical trials rarely run for more than 5 years, while life expectancy
in middle-aged hypertensives is 20–30 years.

CLINICAL TRIALS IN HYPERTENSION

Meta-analysis of BP-lowering trials: the BPLTTC
The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaborative
(BPLTTC) was formed over 10 years ago and is an international
alliance of the principal investigators of the largest trials of antihypertensive regimens. The project is based at the George Institute
for International Health, a department of the University of Sydney
(M http://www.georgeinstitute.org/projects/blood-pressure-loweringtreatment-trialists-collaboration-bplttc).
Its objective is to address questions concerning safety and outcome
with speciﬁc drug classes. To achieve this, data from recent trials are
pooled and subjected to meta-analysis (6 providing the necessary statistical power to examine drug-speciﬁc effects).
Analysis includes differential drug effects in diabetes, between the
sexes, and for the risk of major CV effects.
Analysis published in 2003,* incorporated data from 29 randomized
controlled trials involving 7160,000 patients, with a mean duration of
follow-up of 2.0–8.0 years (>70,000 patient years). The mean age was
65 years (52% ♂, 48% ♀).
Conclusions
• Treatment with any of the commonly used regimens d the total risk
of major CV events.
• Larger reductions in BP produce larger reductions in risk.
• ACE-I and diuretics ±B-blockers are more effective at preventing
heart failure than regimens based on CCBs. Other differences in
regimens ‘beyond BP lowering’ are less certain (including for stroke).

Comment

Ramipril was superior in d rate of
decline. The amlodipine arm was
stopped early because of worse
outcomes.

Showed (surprisingly) that the level of BP
attained did not affect the rate of decline
of renal function.

A doxazosin arm was stopped early
(median 3.3 years’ follow-up) after
interim data suggested an i risk of
combined CHD events.
Main ﬁnding was that thiazides,
CCBs, and ACE-I all provide similar
protection from CHD.
Thiazides appeared superior to
CCBs and ACE-Is in preventing some
adverse CV outcomes.
CCBs not associated with excess
CV deaths—a concern in previous
studies.

General conclusion: thiazide diuretics
are unsurpassed in preventing the major
complications of i BP. They are also
well tolerated and inexpensive. They
became the initial drug of choice in many
guidelines.
Criticisms: (i) designed in an era of
monotherapy, (ii) many conclusions
drawn on the basis of s endpoints, (iii)
randomization deprived some patients
with CCF of their diuretic, (iv) oldfashioned treatments were used for
step-up (e.g. clonidine, reserpine).

Stopped early (median follow-up
5.4 years) because of superior results
in the CCB/ACE-I arm for several
s endpoints, including all-cause
mortality and new-onset DM (p
endpoints were non-fatal MI and fatal
CHD). Substudy with atorvastatin
treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant d in
the incidence of stroke.

Unique in its focus on combination
therapy.
Good press for CCBs after a lot of
(unjustiﬁed) bad press.
Reignited concerns regarding new-onset
DM with diuretics + B-blocker.
Led to early review of guidelines.

Ramipril decreased the combined
relative risk of MI, stroke, or CV
death by 22%.

Provided considerable impetus to the
‘beyond BP lowering’ hypothesis. There
were important BP differences between
the groups that probably accounted for
the results (and led cynics to dub it the
‘HYPE’ trial).

Achieved BPs were 144/85, 141/83,
and 140/81. The lowest incidence
of CV events occurred at DBP
83mmHg. The beneﬁt of progressive
BP reduction was most marked in
patients with DM.
Aspirin caused a further signiﬁcant
d in CV events (due entirely to a d
in MIs).

Deﬁned a new optimal BP target (DBP
83mmHg), Further reductions did not
d CV events (i.e. did not support the ‘J
curve’ hypothesis).

Result

Comment

Stopped early because of superior
results in treatment arm for overall
mortality and stroke. Final results
showed additional d in CV events as
well as fatal and non-fatal heart failure.

Demonstrated effective treatment
in age 80 years or older is beneﬁcial,
extending the patient group in whom
prevention should be considered.

Both regimens resulted in equivalent BP
control and outcomes.

The diuretic group needed
signiﬁcantly more add-on
antihypertensive medications. Less
new-onset DM was seen in the CCB
group.

BP control was identical between the
two groups. p events were fewer, the
incidence of new-onset DM lower, and
LVH regression greater for losartan than
for the B-blocker.

One interpretation: the
beneﬁts of losartan extend
beyond its BP-lowering effects.
Another: apparent beneﬁts of losartan
actually due to negative effects of
atenolol.

No differences in composite p outcome
between ACE-I/ARB or combination but
increased incidence of ESRD and renal
impairment with combination therapy

Combination therapy was associated
with more adverse events without
increased beneﬁt. This changed
practice with respect to dual
therapy.

Those on perindopril had a signiﬁcant d
in recurrent stroke.

Often cited as evidence for the
‘beyond BP lowering’ hypothesis’
for ACE-I, but the improved stroke
outcome was probably driven by
the more pronounced d in BP in
the combined perindopril + diuretic
arm.

No difference in p endpoints among the
three arms. ACE-I was associated with
a lower risk of MI and CCF than those
treated with a CCB.

Suggested newer and older drugs are
generally equivalent.

Stopped early because of a 42% d
in stroke in the active arm. Cardiac
events were also reduced but not
signiﬁcantly.

Also suggested CCBs may have
a protective role in vascular
dementia.

There were no differences between
treatment groups in CV morbidity or
mortality.

Good BP control in groups
underscored the importance of
achieving target BP, whatever the
agent(s) used.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Diuretics 1
Introduction (see also b p. 792)
Diuretics act by directly inhibiting the Na+ transporters/channels mediating renal Na+ reabsorption.
Efﬁcacy depends on active secretion of the diuretic into the proximal
nephron so that high concentrations are achieved at sites of action along
the tubule. Renal insufﬁciency impairs proximal secretion l relative diuretic resistance. Higher doses may still be effective but risk i toxicity.
The Na+ and volume loss associated with diuretics is initially accompanied by the activation of vasoconstrictor mechanisms (including RAS). This
is one of the reasons that diuretics and ACE-I/ARBs are a good combination (see Fig. 6.8).

Thiazide-type diuretic
Examples
• Thiazides: bendroﬂumethiazide, hydrochlorothiazide.
• Thiazide-like: chlortalidone, indapamide.
Mechanism
• Compete with both Na+ and Cl– to block the Na+–Cl– co-transporter
in the DCT (normally responsible for 5–7% of ﬁltered Na+
reabsorption).
• i Na+ delivery to distal nephron li Na+/K+ exchange and, indirectly,
i H+ excretion. Hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis often results.
• Blocking the Na+–Cl– co-transporter li Ca2+ reabsorption. There
are a number of potential mechanisms for this, but the relative
contributions are unknown. It is most likely that chronic volume
depletion leads to more proximal reabsorption. Thiazides 6 have a
role in prevention of renal stone disease and exert a protective effect
in osteoporosis.
• Thiazide-like agents differ in several of their actions, including duration
of action, channel-blocking activity, and inhibitory inﬂuence on
carbonic anhydrase.
Role
• Effective, good evidence base, and inexpensive.
• Introduced in 1957 and still the ﬁrst line in several guidelines.
• Evidence for bendroﬂumethiazide comes from studies with higher
doses than those used in clinical practice now. For this reason,
thiazide-like agents are now considered ﬁrst choice over thiazides.
• i plasma half-life and sustained renal actions make them preferable to
loop diuretics as antihypertensives (except in special situations, b
p. 500).
Problems
• Hypokalaemia (dose-dependent).
• Impaired glucose tolerance (especially when used with a B-blocker).
• Small i in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.
• Small i serum urate.

500

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Diuretics 2
Loop diuretics
Examples
Furosemide, bumetanide.
Mechanism
• Block the type 2 Na+K+2Cl– (NKCC2) co-transporter in the thick
ascending limb of the loop of Henle (usually responsible for 15–20% of
ﬁltered Na+ reabsorption).
• Tubuloglomerular feedback would normally act to compensate
by a d in GFR, but this is dependent on an identical (6 inhibited)
co-transporter in the macula densa.
• Like thiazide diuretics, may cause hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis.
• Initial Na+ and volume loss may be compensated for by Na+ retention
during the latter part of the dosing interval, with amelioration of
BP-lowering efﬁcacy. So, more frequent dosing (at least twice daily) is
necessary when used for treatment of hypertension.
Role
More potent natriuretics than thiazide-type diuretics but less effective
BP-lowering agents. Their place in the management of i BP is limited to
patients with CCF (with volume overload), renal impairment (with volume
overload), and other oedematous states (e.g. cirrhosis).

Sequential nephron blockade
This is a strategy to overcome diuretic resistance in oedematous
states that involves combination therapy with loop and thiazide (or
thiazide-like) diuretics.

Potassium-sparing diuretics
Examples
Amiloride, triamterene.
Mechanism
• Block the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) expressed in the late DCT
and collecting duct.
• ENaC plays a central role in the control of urinary Na+
reabsorption, ECF volume homeostasis, and BP regulation.
• Several hormones, including aldosterone, vasopressin, angiotensin
II, insulin, and endothelin, regulate ENaC activity.
• K+ absorption is tightly coupled with ENaC Na+ absorption. Drugs
blocking ENaC 6 cause K+ retention. Also has Mg2+-sparing effects.
Role
Not ﬁrst-line.
• Useful adjuncts to limit d K+ and d Mg2+ with other diuretics. d K+ may
actually i BP and is associated with insulin resistance, DM, arrhythmias,
and sudden death.

DIURETICS 2

• Amiloride may be used to prevent d K+ and i BP associated with
excess glucocorticoids or mineralocorticoids (b p. 477) and in Liddle’s
syndrome (caused by activating mutation(s) in ENaC) (b p. 801).
• Can be useful in black patients where ENaC may play a more
prominent role.
• Can be useful in patients with suspected hyperaldosteronism who are
avoiding spironolactone/eplerenone before ARR testing.
Problems
1 Hyperkalaemia! Cautions: renal impairment (especially in DM), combination with B-blockers, ACE-I/ARB, or spironolactone. The incidence
of i K+ when amiloride is co-prescribed with a thiazide or loop diuretic
is very low.

Mineralocorticoid antagonists
Increasingly recommended as the fourth-line agent for resistant hypertension. Why is this?
• Aldosterone activates mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart,
vasculature, and brain. Adverse consequences of activation include
endothelial dysfunction, myocardial ﬁbrosis, myocyte hypertrophy,
vascular injury, and centrally mediated elevations in BP.
• RAS activation is associated with worse outcomes in patients with
CCF and i BP.
• Although ACE-I and ARBs d aldosterone production, levels return
toward normal with chronic use.
• Plasma aldosterone levels correlate with LVH in hypertensive patients.
• Patients with p hyperaldosteronism have worse CV outcomes.
• Pharmacological blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors d LVH and
microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients.
• Experience in severe CCF is positive, with a d in mortality (RALES
study).
• Spironolactone has long been used in the treatment of conditions
associated with s hyperaldosteronism and volume expansion, such
as cirrhotic ascites.
Spironolactone and eplerenone are the mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonists in clinical use.
• Spironolactone is recommended as ﬁrst line on efﬁcacy and cost
grounds. Highly effective. It can be used in combination with
thiazide-like diuretics. Not actually licensed for use in hypertension
in the UK (licence withdrawn in the 1980s due to concerns re
malignancy in rodents. This has not been borne out in humans, but
patients should be informed of the off-licence use).
• Eplerenone is a selective mineralocorticoid receptor with 20x
afﬁnity for mineralocorticoid receptor but just 75% potency
of spironolactone. However, less afﬁnity for androgen and
progesterone receptors l fewer SE.
Adverse effects: gynaecomastia (common), GI upset, impotence, i K+
(1 caution with ACE-I and ARB, especially if renal impairment).

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

B-blockers
Competitive inhibitors of catecholamines at B-adrenergic receptors. Many
are available, with marked interdrug differences in pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic properties. In general, these characteristics inﬂuence
clearance and side effect proﬁle, rather than efﬁcacy.

Examples
See Table 6.10.

Mechanism
Remains a matter of debate. Potentially:
• d cardiac output.
• d renin release.
• d plasma volume.
• d vasomotor tone.
• d peripheral vascular resistance.
• Improved vascular compliance.
• Resetting of baroreceptor levels.
• Effects on prejunctional B receptors: d noradrenaline release.
• d pressor response to catecholamines with exercise and stress.
• Direct CNS effect.

Role
Downgraded in BHS/NICE in the UK and not ﬁrst choice in JNC-7 although
still useful if concomitant angina, post-MI (d mortality risk), arrhythmias,
or hyperdynamic circulation. Consider in younger people and if resistant i BP. Carvedilol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol have been shown to d
morbidity and mortality in patients with stable CCF. Labetalol is useful in
pregnancy (b p. 849) and for parenteral treatment (b p. 522).

Problems
• Avoid in marked bradycardia, AV node disease.
• Avoid abrupt withdrawal, as rebound tachycardia can cause myocardial
ischaemia in susceptible individuals.
• X Many patients with obstructive airways disease have compelling
indications for B-blocker therapy (IHD/CCF/arrhythmias). B1 selective
agents (atenolol or metoprolol) appear to be safe and may actually
reduce exacerbations and mortality.
• Can cause lethargy, impaired concentration and memory, vivid dreams,
hallucinations, depression (CNS effects may be more prominent
with lipid-soluble agents), deterioration in peripheral vascular disease
(nebivolol has some peripheral vasodilating properties and may well be
tolerated in patients with claudication), and Raynaud’s symptoms.
• Metabolic effects:
• d HDL cholesterol and i triglycerides.
• i likelihood of new-onset DM, particularly when combined with
a thiazide (combination leads to 71 new case of DM for every 250
patients treated/year.) Avoid this combination if high risk: strong FH
of T2DM, impaired glucose tolerance (FPG ≥6.5mmol/L), clinically
obese (BMI >30), or of South Asian or Afro-Caribbean origin.

B-BLOCKERS

• Worsen glycaemic control and hypoglycaemic awareness in T1DM
(worse with non-selective agents).
• Combined with diltiazem or verapamil, may cause slowing of SA node
± negative inotropic effect.

1 Sotalol is not licensed for use in hypertension. † Sotalol has class III antiarrhythmic
properties and can prolong the QT interval.
B-blockers differ in terms of B1 selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA),
membrane-stabilizing activity (MSA), A-adrenergic blocking ability, and pharmacokinetic properties.
a
B1 selectivity: these agents have less effect on B2 receptors and are, therefore, relatively
cardioselective. Applies at lower doses only. Theoretically, an advantage in patients with
obstructive airways disease but should still be regarded as a contraindication. May not block
arteriolar B2 receptors, which may be an advantage in T1DM with hypoglycaemia.
b
Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA): partial agonist activity at B1 receptors, B2 receptors, or
both. Identiﬁed as slight cardiac stimulation, inhibited by propanolol. Cause less bradycardia and
AV node slowing, possibly less negatively inotropic, less effect on peripheral vascular resistance.
Apparent better lipid proﬁle. Unclear if represents an overall advantage (or disadvantage).
c
MSA: these agents have a quinidine or local anaesthetic-like effect on the cardiac action
potential. Usually seen above therapeutic levels and 6 apparent in overdose.
d
A-blocking activity: antagonistic properties at both A- and B-adrenergic receptors. Causes
a reduction in peripheral and coronary vascular resistance. The beneﬁt of carvedilol in heart
failure is not dependent on this property.
e
Water-soluble agents are predominantly excreted via the kidney and have a longer half-life.
1 Dose reduction is often necessary if d GFR. Lipid-soluble agents mainly undergo hepatic
excretion. Usually shorter acting (requiring bd or tds dosing) and cause more CNS SE (cross
the blood–brain barrier).

503

504

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

A-blockers
A adrenoceptors participate in the regulation of vascular tone by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and play a role in the genesis of i BP and
other CV disorders.

Examples
• Selective A1 antagonists: doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin, indoramin.
• The bioavailability of modiﬁed-release (MR) formulations of
doxazosin is 750% of standard release, so doses need to be adjusted
when moving between preparations.
• Unselective A1 and A2 antagonists: phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine.

Mechanism
• A1 receptors are post-synaptic. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine)
li intracellular Ca2+ ﬂux li smooth muscle contraction l
vasoconstriction. Selective A1 blockade causes d SVR and BP, with
little or no effect on heart rate or cardiac output. A-blockers are
essentially vasodilators.
• A2 receptors are presynaptic. Stimulation ld noradrenaline release.
• Non-A1 and A2 selective agents were developed ﬁrst.
• In normotensive patients with normal sympathetic tone and vascular
resistance, A-blockers have minimal BP-lowering effect.

Role
• Antihypertensive effect only modest when used as single agents.
Effects are additive with other antihypertensive classes.
• ALLHAT (see Box 6.5 and b p. 494) provided bad press for
A-blockers.
• In light of this, not considered ﬁrst (or even second) line.
• Favourable lipid effects (d total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides;
i HDL).
• Safe and effective in renal insufﬁciency.
• BP-lowering effect, independent of age race and gender.
• Non-selective A-blockers are useful in the management of
phaeochromocytoma (b p. 482).

Problems
Prazosin has a short half-life, causing ﬁrst dose (and postural) d BP—
generally less of a problem with longer-acting agents. Dizziness can persist
(even without demonstrable postural d BP). Caution with sildenaﬁl, tadalaﬁl, and vardenaﬁl (l rapid d BP). Stress incontinence aggravated in ♀.
Can cause ﬂuid retention (6 good combined with a diuretic).

A-BLOCKERS

Box 6.5 α-blockers and ALLHAT (b p. 494)
The doxazosin limb was stopped early (3.3 years’ follow-up, 79,000
patients) because of a 25% i incidence of CV disease (mainly CCF; no
difference in p endpoints—fatal and non-fatal MI), compared to the
thiazide group, As a result, A-blockers have fallen in popularity with
guideline authors and prescribers alike. However, (i) SBP was higher
in the doxazosin arm; (ii) randomization deprived many patients with
CCF of diuretics, B-blockers, or ACE-I, creating a disadvantage for the
A-blocker group.
A-blockers remain a good component of multiple drug regimens for
moderate to severe i BP and are particularly useful in ♂ with concomitant prostatic disease. Avoid if coexisting CCF.

α-blockers and bladder outﬂow symptoms (b p. 761)
• Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with BPH and
obstruction are common in ♂ aged >60.
• Bladder emptying involves relaxation of A1 receptor-mediated
smooth muscle contraction in the bladder neck and prostate.
• A1 receptors are integral to the bulbospinal pathways from brainstem
l lumbosacral cord, which inhibit reﬂex urination.
• A-blockers relieve the symptoms of outﬂow obstruction and reduce
the need for surgery.
• Newer A-blockers, e.g. tamsulosin, are ‘uroselective’, acting on the A
receptor subtypes A1a and A1b, within the bladder neck and prostate,
with limited effect on systemic BP.
• A-blockers are effective, with >60% reporting improvement. Medical
therapy is now common, and TURP rates have fallen.
• A-blockers are the best monotherapy for symptom relief of LUTS.
• In those with moderate to severe symptoms and demonstrable
prostatic enlargement, combination therapy of an A-blocker
and 5A-reductase inhibitor (block conversion of testosterone l
dihydrotestosterone), e.g. ﬁnasteride, provides effective symptom
relief and retards disease progression.

505

506

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Calcium channel blockers
Examples
• Dihydropyridine (vasodilating) CCBs: nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine,
isradipine, lacidipine, lercanidipine, nicardipine, nisoldipine.
• Non-dihydropyridine (cardiac active) CCBs: diltiazem, verapamil.

Mechanism
• Block voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels ld calcium entry into
smooth muscle cells ld smooth muscle contraction ld vascular
resistance l arterial vasodilatation.
• Dihydropyridines: more selective at Ca2+ channels in vascular
smooth muscle cells 6 more powerful vasodilators.
• Non-dihydropyridines: block Ca2+channels in cardiac myocytes and
d cardiac output. Antiarrhythmic properties via AV node (verapamil
> negative inotrope and chronotrope effect than diltiazem).
• Other CCB effects: d aldosterone release, d growth and proliferation
of vascular smooth muscle cells, anti-atherogenic in animal models.
• Moderately i Na+ excretion via natriuresis. d BP effect is not
augmented by dietary Na+ restriction (unlike other classes).
• Undergo ﬁrst pass metabolism to some degree. Most are short-acting
6 require multiple dosing regimens or a slow-release delivery system.

Role
• Recommended with priority over diuretics in BHS/NICE guidelines.
• BP-lowering effect equivalent to most other drug classes, but variability
in BP less so may have an advantage.
• Among CCBs, antihypertensive properties are 7 equivalent.
• Can be combined with all other classes (1 avoid diltiazem or
verapamil with B-blockers—cardiac effects are additive).
• Good choice in patients with concomitant angina.
• Effective in low renin i BP (i.e. black or elderly patients).
• Non-dihydropyridine CCBs can be effectively combined with
dihydropyridine CCBs. This combination can be particularly useful in
black patients with difﬁcult BP.
• Do not worsen dyslipidaemias.
• d BP effect not blunted by NSAIDs.
• Nimodipine is used for the prevention of ischaemic deﬁcits, following
subarachnoid haemorrhage—not licensed for hypertension.

Problems
• Flushing, tachycardia, or headache; especially short-acting agents.
• Dose-dependent peripheral oedema with dihydropyridine CCBs.
This is not due to ﬂuid retention (6 diuretic unresponsive) but s
to mismatched arteriolar and venous vasodilatation. In this situation,
consider using a pill-cutter and 2.5mg amlodipine od.
• Gum hypertrophy occurs with dihydropyridine CCBs.
• Avoid in systolic LV impairment (esp. non-dihydropyridine).

CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS

• CCBs have many drug interactions—worth checking before
prescribing.
• Grapefruit juice inhibits cytochrome P450 CYP3A and i the
bioavailability of several dihydropyridine CCBs.
• Several trials have suggested that CCBs are not as effective protection
against hypertensive or diabetic renal disease as ACE-I or ARBs 6 not
ﬁrst line in this situation.
• Verapamil use is often accompanied by constipation.

1 Early formulations of some dihydropyridines (e.g. capsular or sublingual nifedipine) had a rapid onset of action, with an unpredictable
BP-lowering effect, accompanied by reﬂex sympathetic stimulation,
tachycardia, and RAS activation. These agents have no place in the management of hypertension.

507

508

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

ACE inhibitors (ACE-I)
Examples
Most commonly used: captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, perindopril,
quinapril, ramipril, trandolapril.
Ramipril and trandalopril are the only ACE-I with a half-life long enough
to be suitable for once-daily dosing.

Mechanism
• Block conversion of angiotensin I li angiotensin II (A2) by
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The resulting d in A2 l
vasodilatation and d BP.
• A2 has many actions potentially detrimental to the CV system
(b p. 456).
• Alternative pathways of A2 production, e.g. chymases and other tissue
proteases, are unaffected.
• In the short term, ACE-I reduce AII levels, but, with chronic treatment,
they return to normal (‘A2 escape’). Other mechanisms of BP lowering
are 6 thought to be active. Possibilities:
• i bradykinin li NO 9i PGI2 (l vasodilatation).
• i angiotensin-(1–7), a peptide that is antagonistic to A2.
• d sympathetic nervous system activity.
• Direct effect on endothelial function and vascular remodelling.
• ACE-I can be subdivided, according to their afﬁnity for tissue ACE.
It is possible that lipophilic compounds with high tissue afﬁnity (e.g.
ramipril, quinapril, perindopril) exert greater inﬂuence on endothelial
function and provide CV beneﬁts independent of BP lowering X.
• Increasing the dose of an ACE-I does not generally alter peak effect
but extends duration of response. Many patients beneﬁt from a second
daily dose.

Role
• Comparable BP lowering to other classes (but no better).
• Cardioprotective and renoprotective 6 good choice if: CCF, post-MI,
DM, CKD (especially proteinuric), or LVH.
• Patients at high risk of CV disease may have improved survival when
treated with ACE-I (independent of BP reduction X).
• Synergistic effects when used in combination with diuretics
(diuretics l Na+ depletion l RAS activation l A2-dependent
(and 6 ACE-I-responsive) i BP. ACE-I also help to ameliorate
diuretic-induced i K+.
• Also suitable for combination with B-blockers, A-blockers, and CCBs.
• Routine combination with an ARB is not recommended.
• Relatively ineffective as monotherapy in certain groups with low renin
i BP, e.g. black patients, although response highly variable (d Na+ diet
increases efﬁcacy). Generally effective in the elderly.
• Documenting plasma renin activity or ACE gene polymorphisms to
‘individualize’ therapy is not useful—neither predicts response.
• Lack adverse metabolic effects.

ACE INHIBITORS (ACE-I)

Problems and practical considerations
• Decline in renal function. When glomerular ﬁltration pressure is
dependent on A2-driven efferent arteriolar tone (e.g. volume
depletion, renal artery stenosis, CCF), then ACE inhibition may cause a
precipitous decline in GFR.
• 1 Precautions:
• Ensure patient is volume-replete.
• Check U&E and eGFR before commencing treatment and 5–7 days
after. Expect (and allow) a rise in SCr. Stop ACE-I if change in Cr
≥30% or d eGFR of ≥25%.
• Ask those on diuretic therapy to take ﬁrst dose before retiring
to bed.
• Seek specialist help if high index of suspicion of renovascular
disease (b p. 586).
• 2 Counsel patients that they should avoid NSAIDs and temporarily
stop taking their ACE-I in the event of an intercurrent illness, e.g.
febrile illness, diarrhoea, vomiting. They should inform their doctor
in this circumstance.
• Hypotension. Acute falls in BP with ACE-I occur when RAS is activated,
e.g. overdiuresis, CCF, accelerated hypertension. Rare when therapy
initiated in uncomplicated hypertensive patients (admission to hospital
for ACE-I introduction was commonplace in the 1980s). Postural
hypotension is actually comparatively uncommon. In elderly or frail,
consider starting at night.
• Hyperkalaemia. Most common in those with renal impairment 9 other
drugs causing i K+ (e.g. amiloride, spironolactone, B-blockers).
• Patients who develop mild i K+ should not necessarily have their
ACE-I stopped, particularly if there is a compelling indication.
Dietary advice is usually sufﬁcient to allow re-introduction. Many
specialists will tolerate i K+ <6.0mmol/L.
• Cough. Common (5–40%, ♀>♂) and generally resistant to all
measures, except drug withdrawal (i bradykinin 9 other vasoactive
peptides, e.g. substance P l cough reﬂex activation).
• Angioneurotic oedema. Rare. Black patients > Caucasians; also
bradykinin-mediated and potentially fatal. Stop the ACE-I, and avoid
for life.
• d Erythropoietin secretion. May cause or worsen anaemia.
• Pregnancy. Contraindicated.
• Rash and altered taste. Mainly captopril.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

A2 receptor blockers (ARB)
Examples
Candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan,
valsartan.

Mechanism
• There are two A2 receptor subtypes:
• AT1 mediates: (i) vasoconstrictor effects of A2 and (ii) A2-induced
growth in the myocardium and arterial wall.
• AT2 function is less well understood. Expressed at high levels in
fetal tissues, with d expression after birth. Probably responsible for
many of the proliferative effects of A2.
• ARB l inhibition of AT1l inhibition of vasoconstrictive action of A2
on smooth muscle.
• Two major differences between ACE-I and ARB:
• ACE-I ld activity of A2 at both AT1 and AT2 receptors. ARB only
d AT1 activity, with no effect on AT2.
• ACE is a kininase, so ACE-I lead to i kinins. Kinins are responsible
for some ACE-I side effects (esp. cough) but may also mediate
some of their beneﬁcial effects, including BP lowering and i insulin
sensitivity.
• A2 blockade leads to i renin, i angiotensin I, and i A2, although this
accumulation does not appear to overwhelm receptor blockade.

Roles
• Similar BP-lowering effect to ACE-I and other main classes.
• As with ACE-I, synergistic with diuretics.
• ARBs have similar beneﬁts to ACE-I in conditions other than i BP,
such as CCF (Val-HeFT and CHARM studies) and post-MI (VALIANT).
• Several major trials (IDNT, IRMA-2, RENAAL,) have demonstrated
renoprotection with ARB in nephropathy associated with T2DM.

Problems
•
•
•
•
•
•

Generally well tolerated, similar side effect proﬁle to ACE-I.
Less cough than ACE-I (as kinin-mediated).
Angio-oedema has been reported. Cause not clear.
Altered taste.
Contraindicated in pregnancy.
Concerns regarding increased cancer risk led to an FDA analysis, but
no overall increase in cancer was found.

Practical points
• Not all ARBs are the same. Losartan and valsartan are relatively
short-acting. Give twice daily if BP not controlled.
• Generic preparations mean that cost has reduced.
• Check salt intake if resistant to treatment.
• Some studies suggest increased insulin sensitivity but not conclusive.
• Losartan has a mild uricosuric effect, which may be beneﬁcial in
patients with gout.

A2 RECEPTOR BLOCKERS (ARB)

Combined ACE-I and ARBs (see also b p. 614)
Two drugs are not better than one
• Good theoretical rationale for using in combination:
• ACE inhibitors do not completely block the formation of A2
(other tissue proteases are involved).
• ARBs are selective for the AT1 receptor, leaving AT2 receptor
exposed to i A2.
• With ACE-I, i A2 l renin release, eventually returning A2
towards baseline (termed ‘A2 escape’).
• Combination therapy is effective in LV dysfunction (Val-HeFT and
CHARM studies).
• Small studies (e.g. CALM) raised expectation. One key study
(COOPERATE) was retracted after publication.
• ON-TARGET, a large RCT comparing the effects of telmisartan,
ramipril, and their combination on CV mortality in high-risk patients
found the combination was not associated with an improvement in
key outcomes but increased the risk of renal failure.
• Current guidelines do not recommend the use of combination
therapy for the treatment of hypertension.

Renin inhibitors
• Direct renin inhibition provides an additional means of
antagonizing RAS.
• Aliskiren was the ﬁrst commercially available example.
• Lowers BP to a similar degree to other agents.
• Anticipated that it might have a useful synergistic role in combination
with ACE-I/ARB (as renin increases with long-term use of these
agents).
• In the ALTITUDE study, 8,600 patients with T2DM and nephropathy
were assigned to either aliskiren or placebo to take, in addition to
their pre-existing ACE-I/ARB. The trial was stopped early, as there
were no apparent CV or renal beneﬁts, but there was a higher
adverse event rate (i K+, d BP, stroke).
• 1 MHRA/FDA now advise not to use aliskiren in combination with
ACE-I and ARBs in patients with diabetes or renal impairment.
• They may still have a role in patients with high renin i BP that is
inadequately treated despite maximum therapy or multiple drug
intolerances.
• Side effects: i K+, d BP, angio-oedema, GI symptoms, raised uric acid
(l gout, renal calculi).
• Do not use in pregnancy.
• Important interaction with ciclosporin (li blood levels of aliskiren)
6 avoid this combination.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Other antihypertensive agents
With the exception of methyldopa and moxonidine, these drugs are rarely
seen in the routine treatment of i BP in the UK. However, they are still
widely used around the world—and generic formulations mean lower
costs in many instances.

Centrally acting agents
Methyldopa
Metabolized to a methyl-noradrenaline, a false neurotransmitter that:
(i) displaces noradrenaline from A adrenergic receptors, preventing
smooth muscle contraction and (ii) stimulates adrenergic receptors in
the central vasomotor centres, inhibiting sympathetic outﬂow. Large dose
range (250mg–3g daily) and remains widely used to treat i BP in pregnancy
(b p. 849). A concomitant diuretic is desirable in non-pregnant patients.
Problems: positive Coombs’ test in 20% (though overt haemolytic anaemia rare), dry mouth, oedema, drowsiness, febrile illness, and depression.
Avoid in liver disease.
Clonidine
Stimulates adrenergic receptors in the central vasomotor centres, inhibiting sympathetic outﬂow. Use now rare. Clonidine suppression test occasionally used in the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma (b p. 482), and
it has also been used off-licence to assist smoking cessation and opiate
withdrawal (orally or transdermal release), as it reduces the physiological
manifestations of tobacco withdrawal.
Problems: dry mouth, sedation, depression. Associated with severe
rebound i BP when stopped abruptly (may require treatment with parenteral A-blockers).
Moxonidine
A selective imidazole agonist that acts on central receptors to decrease
sympathetic outﬂow. Can be a useful add-on therapy when other classes
are insufﬁcient or poorly tolerated. Can be used with caution and careful
titration in renal insufﬁciency.
Problems: dry mouth, headache, fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness. Avoid abrupt
withdrawal (if also on B-blockers, stop them ﬁrst). Avoid if AV block,
bradycardia, severe CCF (worse outcomes), and pregnancy.

Direct acting vascular smooth muscle relaxants
Hydralazine and minoxidil
d arteriolar resistance. The consequent d peripheral resistance and BP
causes reﬂex sympathetic activation, with tachycardia and palpitations.
This can be offset with a B-blocker.
Hydralazine (and nitrate) can be a useful adjunct in NYHA class 3–4
systolic heart failure.
Problems: ﬂushing, headache, palpitations. Avoid in ischaemic heart disease. Cause Na+ and water retention (especially minoxidil) 6 give with a
diuretic. Hydralazine can cause a lupus-like syndrome, particularly in slow
acetylators. Minoxidil causes hirsutism. Hydralazine metabolites accumulate in renal impairment 6 avoid (minoxidil is OK).

OTHER ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENTS

Antihypertensives on the horizon
Endothelin antagonists
The endothelins are a group of potent vasoconstrictor peptides produced in many different tissues. ET-1 is the predominant endothelin
secreted by the endothelium where it acts in a paracrine fashion.
Several antagonists are under investigation, and it is hoped they
will prove reno- and cardioprotective as well as antihypertensive.
Darusentan, a marginally selective ETA receptor antagonist, has been
shown to reduce BP and proteinuria in early studies (e.g. DORADO).
Bosentan is already licensed for use in pulmonary hypertension.
Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPIs)
Simultaneously inhibit both ACE (preventing the conversion of AI l
A2) and neutral endopeptidase, The latter is a membrane-bound metalloprotease involved in the enzymatic degradation of natriuretic peptides
(ANP and BNP) and various other peptides, so inhibition will prolong
their duration of action.
The combined effect of reduced A2 activity and increased natriuretic peptide activity is attractive. Early studies with VPIs showed a very
favourable therapeutic effect. However, a signiﬁcant incidence of potentially life-threatening angio-oedema ultimately led to failed FDA approval
and stalled development.
Angiotensin receptor blockers with neutral endopeptidase
inhibition (ARNi)
Currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. Preliminary
results suggest increased BP reduction in comparison to ARB alone—
and with no increase in angio-oedema.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Non-pharmacological strategies
Introduction
It is important not to forget (and to often revisit) dietary salt restriction,
reduced alcohol intake, weight loss, and patient education.
There has also been growing recent interest in novel, often invasive, therapies, particularly in the management of resistant hypertension. These include:
Renal denervation with radiofrequency energy
• It has been known for years that interruption of the renal nerves can
lead to a reduction in BP.
• However, surgical intervention to achieve this was associated with
appreciable morbidity and mortality and was not selective for renal
sympathetic nerves, resulting in more widespread sympathetic
denervation.
• Endovascular (or catheter-based) renal nerve ablation has been
studied in patients with resistant hypertension (patients on a mean of
ﬁve drugs, including a diuretic) in a series of trials (including Simplicity
HTN-1 and 2).
• Mean reduction in SBP of 28–32mmHg, compared to control.
• An endovascular catheter is placed in the femoral artery and guided
to the kidneys. The sympathetic nerves are closely related to the renal
arteries, and radiofrequency energy is used to disrupt them at several
sites along the vessel.
• Most patients remain on some therapy, but beneﬁts are sustained to
3 years.
• No longer-term outcomes yet available.
• 715% treatment failure (possibly higher).
• Invasive, uncomfortable procedure. Day case or overnight stay.
• No evidence of new atherosclerotic lesions in the ﬁeld of RF energy.
• Limited data in patients with CKD, but those available (CKD 3–4 with
resistant i BP) show a beneﬁcial BP-lowering effect and favourable
safety proﬁle.
• Simplicity HTN-3 (USA-based) is currently recruiting. It incorporates
24h BP measurements and a sham procedure to allow testing for
placebo response.
Device-guided respiration
• Portable electronic devices that promote slow and deep breathing
(e.g. RESPeRATE®).
• Consist of a control box, a respiration sensor, and headphones (which
provide feedback to the patient). The device analyses breathing
patterns and creates audible tones for the patient to then synchronize
their breathing to. The device gradually slows breathing to <10 breaths
per minute.
• Marketed as non-pharmacological treatment for BP reduction but can
be used as an adjunct to drug therapy.
• Published trials show a small, but signiﬁcant, effect (d SBP 3.67mmHg
and d DBP 2.51mmHg), although they have been of short duration.
• Evidence of long-term beneﬁt currently lacking.

NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL STRATEGIES

Baroreceptor activation therapy (BAT)
• Electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus baroreﬂex system, using a
surgically implanted device.
• Appears effective but limited outcome data.
• Procedure-related adverse events relatively common.

515

516

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Resistant hypertension
Introduction
Variably deﬁned but usually a failure to reach target BP despite multiple
antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic. It is most commonly a consequence of poorly controlled SBP.
Although thought to be relatively common—up to 20–30% of study
populations in clinical trials—the experience, when recruiting to these
studies, has been that true resistant hypertension is actually less common
if drug therapy is optimized and contributing factors are rectiﬁed.
In the UK, resistant hypertension is considered to be BP not controlled
to target with maximal recommended and tolerated doses of an ACE-I/
ARB + CCB + thiazide. The 2011 BHS/NICE guideline recommends that
such patients are managed with a further diuretic (consider spironolactone), an A-blocker, or a B-blocker (and that a referral for specialist input
is considered).
Although evidence for treatment strategies are generally limited, more
robust guidance will hopefully emerge in the next few years; for example, the BHS PATHWAY 2 study has been designed to evaluate whether
resistant hypertension is due to excess sodium retention and whether
further diuretic is the most effective treatment. The study also hopes to
determine whether plasma renin can be a useful guide to further treatment in this circumstance. At present, some clinicians measure renin concentrations in resistant patients, add a B-blocker or additional ACE/ARB
if high and an A-blocker if normal, and change the diuretic (usually to
spironolactone) if low. (See Fig. 6.9 for management algorithm.)
Characteristics of patients with resistant hypertension
• Obese.
• Elderly.
• Black patients.
• CKD.
• DM.
• High starting BP.
Checklist
• Is it really resistant BP? Does it meet the deﬁnition given earlier? Are
you conﬁdent about compliance? Does the patient understand the
condition, the beneﬁts of treatment. and the role of each tablet?
• Revisit dietary salt restriction (aim to restrict 24h uNa+ to <100meq),
alcohol consumption, and weight loss (diet and exercise).
• Exclude contributory drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, steroids, COC, ciclosporin,
decongestants, ESAs).
• Reconsider secondary causes of i BP, especially renal disease, sleep
apnoea, and primary hyperaldosteronism (b p. 474).

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Hypertensive urgencies and
emergencies
Deﬁnitions
• 2 Hypertensive crises are classiﬁed as emergencies or urgencies, based
on the presence or absence of progressive target organ dysfunction.
• Emergencies: severe i BP complicated by evidence of acute
or progressive organ dysfunction, such as cardiac ischaemia,
encephalopathy, stroke, pulmonary oedema, or renal failure.
• Urgencies: severe i BP without evidence of acute or progressive
target organ dysfunction.
• The term malignant hypertension was coined before antihypertensive
therapy improved an appalling prognosis (1-year mortality 790%).
It is a syndrome of i BP with progressive target organ damage and
papilloedema. Pathologically, arteriolar ﬁbrinoid necrosis is the
characteristic lesion.
• Accelerated hypertension was applied to the scenario of retinal
haemorrhages and exudates without papilloedema. The distinction
from malignant hypertension is unhelpful, as both carry an identical
prognosis.
• There is no threshold of BP above which malignant hypertension
develops. DBP ranges from 100–180mmHg, SBP 150–290mmHg.
• 2 Severity is not determined by BP alone—it is the clinical context
and degree of target organ dysfunction.
• Affects <1% of the hypertensive population, but the hypertensive
population is large. ♂>♀.
• Essential hypertension accounts for 72–30% of episodes in Caucasians
but 780% in black patients (2 therefore, usually avoidable).
• Renal disease (intrinsic and renovascular) accounts for the majority of
the rest. Other previously unrecognized forms of secondary i BP may
also be responsible.
• The duration of hypertension prior to the development of malignant
phase may range from days to years.

Pathophysiology
Vascular autoregulation
Autoregulation describes the ability of organs to maintain their perfusion,
regardless of BP. i BP causes distal arteriolar vasoconstriction, protecting
end-organs from hypertensive mechanical stress. Hypertensive emergencies are associated with a failure of this process, resulting in transmission
of i BP to the microvasculature where mechanical trauma l endothelial
injury li vascular permeability l leakage l platelet and ﬁbrin deposition l ﬁbrinoid necrosis. Catecholamines and vasopressin release also
contribute.
Endocrine and paracrine mediators, including RAS, are activated with
i A2, leading to further vasoconstriction and ischaemia. Volume depletion
due to pressure natriuresis stimulates further renin release and worsens
i BP. A vicious cycle of vasoconstriction and worsening i BP ensues.

HYPERTENSIVE URGENCIES AND EMERGENCIES

Pathological changes
Vascular lesions are due to endothelial injury and consist of myointimal
proliferation and ﬁbrinoid necrosis, with subendothelial lipid deposition
and hyaline thrombi. Vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy and collagen
deposition contribute to medial thickening, which, with cellular intimal proliferation, results in the ‘onion skin’ appearance of small vessels, with luminal
narrowing. Ischaemia or infarction of end-organs may occur. These changes
are particularly well seen in the kidney, with proliferative endarteritis of
the interlobular arteries, ﬁbrinoid necrosis of the afferent arteriole, and
glomerular ischaemia (± tubulointerstitial damage) (see Figs 6.10 and 6.11).

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Assessing urgencies and emergencies
How does the BP compare to previous readings?
• 160/100 may be sufﬁciently high to cause acute TOD in a previously
normotensive patient.
• A patient with long-standing hypertension may tolerate a higher BP
without any evidence of acute TOD.

Clinical assessment
• 2 Assess degree of target organ involvement.
• Urgency if i BP without acute or progressive TOD.
• Emergency if i BP with acute or progressive TOD.

Is there evidence of target organ damage?
Acute TOD
3 Manage as an inpatient as an emergency:
• Neurological symptoms: at risk for haemorrhagic or thrombotic
stroke, encephalopathy (altered consciousness, ﬁts, focal signs).
• LVF.
• Acute kidney injury failure (send U&E, dipstick urine).
• 1 Chest pain. Acute coronary syndrome l MI or aortic dissection.
Perform ECG, and check pulses. If in doubt: CT aorta.
• Visual symptoms 9 either grade III or IV hypertensive retinopathy.
• Pancreatitis due to haemorrhagic infarction (rare).

What medication has the patient been on until now?
• Continue current medication, adding in further treatment, as necessary.
• Check previous adherence to medication (recent non-compliance is
very common in this situation). 1 Beware precipitating hypotension
by restarting multiple antihypertensives in the previously non-adherent
patient.
• 2 Remember recreational drug use (cocaine, amphetamines).

Symptoms and signs
• BP: no pathognomonic values. Usually >220/140mmHg (range: DBP
100–180mmHg, SBP 150–290mmHg). Check BP in both arms; look for
missing pulses, bruits, or an AAA.
• Eyes: visual disturbances (35–60%)—often present to ophthalmology.
• Neurological: headache (60%), dizziness (30%), neurological deﬁcit,
e.g. hemiparesis, cortical blindness (<10%). Posterior reversible
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as reversible posterior
leucoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), is increasingly recognized.
PRES is characterized by headache, confusion, seizures, visual loss, and
areas of cerebral oedema on MRI. The syndrome tends to resolve with
treatment of BP, although visual defects may persist.
• Renal: AKI (30%).
• Cardiovascular: dyspnoea s to LVF (710%), chest pain (74%).

ASSESSING URGENCIES AND EMERGENCIES

Hypertensive retinopathy
Grade 1: arterial narrowing (tortuosity, ‘silver wiring’ are subjective).
Grade 2: AV nipping.
Grade 3: haemorrhages and exudates.
Grade 4: papilloedema.

Investigations
• Urinalysis: proteinuria (can be nephrotic range—send uPCR,
haematuria, cellular casts (red cell casts may indicate parenchymal
renal disease).
• U&E:
• Serum creatinine, eGFR: acute (or acute-on-chronic) kidney injury.
• Potassium:d K+ (s hyperaldosteronism l hypokalaemic alkalosis;
renin and aldosterone are both raised in malignant hypertension),
i K+ (s to AKI) also possible.
• FBC: microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia—d Hb, d platelets, red cell
fragments, d haptoglobins, i ESR.
• ECG (± echocardiogram): LVH, ischaemia, MI.
• CT brain: if d GCS or neurological signs.
• MRI brain: PRES/RPLS.
• Renal biopsy: a diagnostic or prognostic renal biopsy may be necessary.
1 Blood pressure must be controlled ﬁrst (b p. 80).

Secondary hypertension?
Some conditions require speciﬁc management. Consider the list in Box 6.6.

CHAPTER 6

Hypertension

Management of urgencies
and emergencies
Hypertensive emergency
Patients with severely raised or rapid rise in BP, with severe grade 3–4
hypertensive retinal changes. Often have evidence of concurrent TOD.
2 Treatment when acute, life-threatening organ damage
• Treat in a high dependency environment.
• Continuous BP monitoring.
• Volume depletion may be present—resuscitate with 0.9% NaCl.
• Initial aim of treatment is to d DBP to 7110–115mmHg. Aim to achieve
this in 2–6 hours.
• 1 A rapid fall may l clinical consequences with d cerebral, spinal
cord, and myocardial perfusion or acute kidney injury.
• Parenteral agents are often required.
• Options: see Table 6.11 for drugs used in emergencies.
• Sodium nitroprusside. The parenteral drug of choice in many
centres. Dose 0.25–1.5 micrograms/kg/min, with increase of
0.5 micrograms/kg/min every 5min until adequate response.
1 Associated with cyanide toxicity (prevent by protecting drug from
light; risk increased at >2 micrograms/kg/min and in renal failure).
• Labetalol (combined A- and B-blocker) particularly logical in IHD
and aortic dissection. 20mg IV initially over 1min, followed by
infusion 0.5–2mg/min. Safe in pregnancy.
• Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) 2–10mg/h. Useful with symptomatic
coronary artery disease or acute LVF. 1 Care if volume-depleted.
Tachyphylaxis occurs after 24–48h.
• Once BP within target range, transfer to oral agent, and wean IV
infusion over 4–8h.
2 Treatment when no life-threatening organ damage
• May have features of malignant hypertension with TOD but not
life-threatening.
• Aim d diastolic BP to 110–115mmHg over 24–48h.
• Oral agents preferred.
• Low blood volume may manifest after treatment initiated (l postural
drop of >20mmHg suggests hypovolaemia in need of correction).
• Start with slow-release nifedipine, e.g. nifedipine retard/MR 10mg.
Repeat the same dose at 2h intervals, with maintenance doses of 20mg
3x day. 1 Do not use capsules or LA preparations.
• Amlodipine is long-acting—it will reduce BP over days 6 not suitable
in urgent situations. Consider starting concurrently with nifedipine MR
and then weaning off nifedipine after 772 hours.
• Second-line therapy is a B-blocker. Particularly helpful with coexisting
IHD or resting tachycardia.
• 1 ACE-I should be used with caution (l abrupt d BP, potential
hypoperfusion/AKI).
• Diuretics should also be used with caution unless clear ﬂuid overload.

MANAGEMENT OF URGENCIES AND EMERGENCIES

Hypertensive urgency
2 Severe uncontrolled hypertension (>130 DBP) with no evidence of
acute TOD
• If no acute TOD, does not necessarily require hospital admission.
• Repeat BP after 1–2h to conﬁrm. If DBP still >130mmHg l treat.
• Use the same oral agents as in emergency. Start with a single agent.
Aim for diastolic BP 100–110mmHg at ﬁrst. Recheck BP after 24–48h.
• If still uncontrolled, increase dose, or add in second agent.
Recheck after every 2–3 days until BP at desired level. Treat according to
BHS guidelines (b p. 488):
• Elderly or black patients l CCB.
• Then A + C.
• Then A + C + D.
• It is appropriate to start an ACE-I (e.g. ramipril) at full dose if normal
renal function and unlikely signiﬁcant RAS.

Prognosis
Without effective treatment: 1-year mortality 790%, with effective treatment <10%. Many patients who develop renal insufﬁciency will recover
renal function, even if initially dialysis-dependent, although this may take
several months.

Orthostatic hypotension
A frequent clinical problem, particularly in the elderly. Generally deﬁned
as a 20/10mmHg (symptomatic) fall in BP within 5min of assuming an
upright posture. Symptoms include weakness, dizziness, visual disturbance,
presyncope, blackouts, and falls. See Box 6.7 for causes. See Fig. 6.12 for
treatment.

Antihypertensive drugs
A frequent culprit. Other drugs include nitrates, opiates, tricyclic antidepressants, and alcohol.

Pure autonomic failure
Characterized by orthostatic d BP, with a static heart rate, i sweating,
impotence, nocturia, constipation, anaemia, and supine i BP. Symptoms
are slowly progressive and often worse early morning and postprandially. Associated with d levels of plasma noradrenaline and degeneration of
post-ganglionic neurons (with Lewy body inclusions).

Multiple system atrophy
Progressive neurodegenerative condition of unknown aetiology. ♂>♀,
age >50. Autonomic dysfunction (often ﬁrst symptom) is accompanied
by combinations of extrapyramidal, pyramidal, and cerebellar dysfunction.

ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
Relatively common; age <40, ♀>♂. Aetiology uncertain but abnormalities of autonomic regulation implicated. The presence of tachycardia distinguishes it from autonomic failure. Often little or no fall in BP. Tilt-table

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Approaching glomerular disease
Introduction
Glomerulonephritis (GN) is classiﬁed by clinical syndrome/presentation
(e.g. nephritic or nephrotic syndrome), histological appearance (e.g. minimal change disease), or by aetiology (e.g. post-streptococcal GN) (see
Fig. 7.1).

Clinical syndromes
For further investigation of these clinical syndromes, see b Chapter 1.
• Asymptomatic urinary abnormalities (b pp. 58 and 66).
• Acute nephritis (b p. 71).
• Nephrotic syndrome (b p. 554).
These may all be accompanied by i BP 9 renal impairment.
Dipstick-positive proteinuria (b p. 58)
Common. Usually detected on routine urinalysis. A positive dipstick for
haematuria or proteinuria should be repeated (e.g. after 1–2 weeks).
Transient proteinuria is not uncommon, esp. in concentrated urine. If
persistent, verify with an albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) or protein
creatinine ratio (uPCR) (b p. 21).
Microscopic haematuria (b p. 66)
Dipstick analysis is very sensitive but non-speciﬁc. If persistent, ideally arrange urine cytology to conﬁrm haematuria (deﬁned as >2 RBC/
hpf), and examine red cell morphology. Dysmorphic red cells, red cell
casts, and fragmented red cells (acanthocytes) imply glomerular bleeding
(b p. 22).
Urine microscopy will also reveal pyuria and other forms of cast. Urine
culture will exclude infection.
Haematuria and proteinuria (b p. 61)
Suggests a glomerular lesion, although independent investigation of the
haematuria may be necessary in patients aged >40 (b p. 67).

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Histology of glomerular disease
Introduction
Renal tissue is sampled via renal biopsy (b p. 80) and prepared for:
• Light microscopy: various histochemical stains (e.g. H+E, periodic acid–
Schiff (PAS), Jones (silver) stains). Useful for morphology, chronicity,
and diagnosis.
• Immunohistochemistry: usually by immunoﬂuorescence but also
immunoperoxidase staining. Localizes immune reactants (particularly
immunoglobulins or complement fractions) within glomeruli, using
ﬂuorescein-labelled antibodies. The nature and pattern of staining are
characteristic for particular glomerular lesions.
• Electron microscopy (EM): useful for examining cell and basement
membrane structure and for characterizing glomerular deposits.

The language of glomerular disease
When examining a preparation of renal cortex, several glomeruli (10–30,
on average) are sampled. The following descriptive terms (see Fig. 7.2)
are then used:
• Focal or diffuse?
• Focal lesions affect some (<50%) of sampled glomeruli, but not all.
• Diffuse lesions involve most (>50%) glomeruli, if not all.
• Segmental or global?
• Segmental lesions affect part of an affected glomerulus.
• Global lesions involve most of the glomerular tuft.
• Proliferative or not?
• Proliferative lesions describe an increase in local cell number; for
instance, an increase in mesangial cells (‘mesangial proliferative’) is a
feature of IgA nephropathy.
• Crescentic or not?
• Glomerular parietal epithelial cells (lining Bowman’s capsule)
proliferate in response to local inﬂammatory and procoagulant
signals, with ﬁbrin deposition and adhesions ﬁlling some, or all, of
Bowman’s space (l‘crescent’).
• Matrix or membrane?
• Expansion of matrix produced by mesangial cells, as seen in IgA
nephropathy, or increase in GBM width (and thus capillary wall
thickness) characteristic of immune deposits.
• Necrosis or sclerosis?
• Necrosis refers to fresh cell death as a result of ongoing injury.
• Sclerosis reﬂects a scarred glomerulus or glomerular segment.

Examples
Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis affects some glomeruli, but not all,
and only part of any affected tuft. The disease leads to scarring within
glomeruli.
Diffuse proliferative crescentic glomerulonephritis affects most glomeruli,
with hypercellularity and the formation of crescents in Bowman’s space.

Deﬁnition

Minimal change

Normal appearance by light microscopy. Note that
electron microscopy may show fusion of podocyte

Sclerosis

Scar tissue, a ﬁbrous matrix obliterates normal
structure so that capillaries collapse and normal cell
nuclei are lost.

Tubular atrophy

Thickening and wrinkling of tubular basement
membrane around a shrunken tubule with ﬂattened
epithelium; implies irreversible tubular damage.

Crescent

Collection of cells in Bowman's space in response
to glomerular damage. Initially only composed of

site; typical of acute post-streptococcal nephritis.

‘Spikes’

Projections of basement membrane between regular
sub-epithelial deposits, typical of membranous

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Acute nephritic syndrome
Introduction
The clinical syndrome associated with underlying glomerulonephritis
(b p. 71). Presents (often rapidly) as:
• Haematuria and proteinuria.
• Impaired renal function.
• Oliguria with signs of salt and water retention.
It is a spectrum of disease with a variety of aetiologies but with a common
site of primary injury: the glomerulus. Onset may be insidious, with urinary
abnormalities alone, or fulminant, with a rapidly progressive crescentic
GN, AKI, and other organ involvement or failure (b p. 71).
Causes
• IgA nephropathy and Henoch–Schönlein purpura.
• Lupus nephritis.
• Post-infectious GN.
• Anti-GBM disease.
• ANCA-associated vasculitis.
• Mesangiocapillary GN (MCGN).

Mechanisms of glomerular injury
The injury leading to most GN is immunologically mediated, with loss of
tolerance to autoantigens, provoking both the cellular and humoral arms
of the immune system. These antigens may be native to the glomerulus
itself (occurring normally within the tuft, e.g. the GBM in anti-GBM disease) or circulating antigens/antigen-antibody complexes that become
trapped in glomerular structures.
Antibody to antigen binding may then ﬁx and activate complement
(forming immune complexes, ICs) or recruit inﬂammatory cells (see
Fig. 7.3). The nature of the injury will depend on the site of the IC (e.g.
IgA-containing mesangial complexes activate mesangial cells to cause
IgA nephropathy). Local complement activation and cell recruitment
(neutrophils, macrophages) generate oxidant species, proteases, inﬂammatory cytokines, growth factors, vasoactive factors, and procoagulants.
Damage to, and activation of, surrounding cells and matrix then lead
to the changes evident on histological examination and the clinical syndrome of haematuria, proteinuria, and impairment of glomerular ﬁltration. The number of ICs formed and the host response to them will
determine the extent of the injury.
Cellular immunity may also contribute to structural glomerular damage—this is especially true of pauci-immune GN (e.g. the GN associated
with ANCA-positive vasculitis) where ICs play no pathological role.
Resolution of inﬂammation might return an inﬂamed glomerulus to
normal or, if the healing phase is poorly regulated, may result in cellular
dropout, scarring, glomerulosclerosis, and CKD.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Nephritis: management overview
Investigations
• Dipstick urine for haematuria, proteinuria.
• Urine microscopy for red morphology 9 casts (b p. 22).
• Amount of proteinuria variable (often <1g/day, i.e. uACR <70mg/mmol
and uPCR <100mg/mmol, but may be nephrotic range).
• SCr, eGFR, U&E, FBC, bone proﬁle, LFT.
• Acute phase markers (CRP, ESR).
• Immunological and serological (‘nephritic’) screen (b p. 40).
• USS kidneys.
• Renal biopsy (b p. 80).

Salt and water restriction
2 It is vital to correctly assess volume status.
• Fluid overload 9 pulmonary oedema often complicates oliguric GN. If
present:
• Limit salt intake <80mmol/day (<5g/day).
• Set oral intake at 500–1,000mL/day (adjusted according to volume
status and UO).
• Diuretics may promote a natriuresis and provide symptomatic
relief: use loop diuretic, e.g. furosemide 40–160mg/day PO or IV,
titrated against response and renal function.
• Less commonly, dehydration may be present, in which case increased
oral intake or rehydration with IVI 0.9% NaCl may be needed.
• Review volume status and monitor weight daily, and chart input and
output to plan following day’s ﬂuid balance. Indwelling catheter only
rarely required.

Control BP
• i BP is usually volume-related and may be signiﬁcant. Aim for target
BP of ≤130/80mmHg.
• Suggested treatment:
• Diuretic (as described in salt and water restriction).
• Stepwise add-on therapy, using B-blockers 9 calcium channel
blockers.
• ACE-I or ARB: titrate up from low dose with daily increments. ACE-I
or ARB offer theoretical advantages in the control of i BP secondary
to renal disease due to their antiﬁbrotic and anti-proteinuric effects.
However, their use in GN-associated with AKI may precipitate a
further decline in renal function.  Careful monitoring is essential.

Other supportive measures
• 2 Prompt treatment of infection.
• Adequate nutrition.
• Management of the complications that may be associated with a
systemic disease causing GN (e.g. lupus, vasculitis).
• Renal replacement therapy, according to standard indications
(b p. 172).

NEPHRITIS: MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW

Speciﬁc therapies: immunosuppression
Almost always tailored to a histological diagnosis (so a renal biopsy
is often indicated as soon as is possible). See Nephritis: overview of
immune suppression (b p. 540) and under each particular diagnosis.

KDIGO clinical practice for glomerulonephritis
This important guideline, ﬁrst published in 2011, aims to help clinicians
caring for patients with GN understand the evidence (or lack of) that
underpins current clinical practice in this area. The recommendations
contained within it are based on a comprehensive review of relevant
literature across many kidney diseases. The strength of all the evidence
presented is graded, current shortcomings are acknowledged and proposals for future research are offered.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Nephritis: overview of immune
suppression
Introduction
 Treatment of glomerulonephritis often involves toxic therapies in the
short term to improve long-term renal and patient outcomes. The initial
goal is to achieve remission before altering therapy to maintain remission.
When considering and commencing therapy, the dictum of ‘ﬁrst do no
harm’ always applies. These are potentially dangerous drugs—does the
risk:beneﬁt assessment justify their use?

Preventing drug toxicity
Corticosteroids
• Issue patients with a steroid card, and counsel regarding the risks of
abrupt steroid withdrawal as well as the potential need to increase
dose with stressors (such as intercurrent illness or anaesthesia). Check
blood glucose at start of therapy.
•  Warn diabetic patients and those with impaired glucose tolerance
to monitor blood sugars closely whilst on corticosteroid therapy and
to inform their diabetic team.
• Prophylaxis against gastric irritation: proton pump inhibitor or H2
receptor antagonist by convention (X although evidence poor).
• Steroid-induced bone demineralization is an early event (within ﬁrst
few months of treatment).
• Consider bisphosphonate (e.g. risedronate 35mg weekly or
alendronic acid 70mg weekly) in those at risk (or if >5mg
prednisolone/day for >3 months).  Many bisphosphonates
require a dose reduction in renal impairment.
• Calcium (1,500mg/day) and vitamin D3 (800 IU/day) preparations
are a less effective alternative.
• Consider baseline and interval DEXA if long-term steroids.
• Treat steroid-exacerbated hyperlipidaemia with a statin.

Tapering steroids
Prednisolone is the most widely used oral corticosteroid. Its use in renal
disease is usually for >3 weeks and it will therefore often require slow
tapering to allow recovery of a suppressed hypothalamic–pituitary axis.
A potential regimen from 20mg/daily prednisolone might be:
• Reduce by 5mg every fortnight until on 5mg/day.
• Reduce to 5mg, alternating with 2.5mg daily for 2 weeks.
• Reduce to 2.5mg daily for 2 weeks.
• Reduce to 2.5mg alternate days for 2 weeks.
• Stop.
Advise re potential Addisonian symptoms, and warn to seek medical
help if unwell.

NEPHRITIS: OVERVIEW OF IMMUNE SUPPRESSION

Others, e.g. alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil)
•  Monitor toxicity: FBC, U&E, and LFT weekly to fortnightly at induction
of therapy (see b p. 542).
• Offer prophylaxis against PCP for duration of cyclophosphamide therapy
(e.g. co-trimoxazole 480mg bd PO or nebulized pentamidine if allergic).
• In those at high risk for tuberculosis (e.g. previous TB, recent
exposure, patients from endemic areas), consider primary prophylaxis
with isoniazid + pyridoxine (X evidence poor).
• Recommend inﬂuenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Live vaccines
should be avoided for the duration of treatment.

Commonly used drugs
• Induction (I) brings about disease remission.
• Maintenance (M) maintains remission.
Prednisolone (I, M)
• To induce remission, either as high dose PO (1mg/kg/day) or as
‘pulsed’ IV (0.5–1g/day for 3 days).
• Corticosteroids are also used at lower dose for maintenance.
• Potent anti-inﬂammatory action, modulating both B and T cell-mediated
immunity. Also inhibit the effector function of both monocytes and
neutrophils through regulation of cytokine-driven responses.
• SE: insomnia, weight gain, i BP, impaired glucose tolerance,
dyslipidaemia, mood disturbance, poor wound healing, osteoporosis.
Cyclophosphamide (I)
• Either orally (e.g. 1.5mg/kg) or as periodic (monthly) IV pulses.
• A cytotoxic alkylating agent that binds to purine bases and impairs
cellular DNA replication (ld cell turnover and cell death), with
consequent restriction of lymphocyte proliferation.
• SE:
• Leucopenia (see b p. 542) and i risk of infection, esp. Herpes zoster.
• Gonadal toxicity. Discuss loss of fertility prior to starting
treatment—in ♀, measure LH/FSH before therapy. Limit
cumulative exposure as much as possible (>15–20g causes infertility
in 750% of those aged >30. The risk is lower in younger patients).
Consider GnRH analogues in ♀ (see b p. 542). Egg preservation
may be possible, but the pace of disease (and 6 need for swift
intervention) often renders this impractical. Discuss sperm
banking in ♂.
• Haemorrhagic cystitis l longer-term risk of bladder cancer.
 Use mesna if giving IVI (see b Using IVI cyclophosphamide
(CYC), p. 542); low threshold for investigating haematuria in
those previously exposed (mesna binds to the cyclophosphamide
metabolite acrolein that is the cause of urothelial toxicity).
• X Oral cyclophosphamide (CYC) is potentially more toxic to ovaries
and bladder than IVI because cumulative doses are usually higher.
• Nausea and vomiting, esp. if given IVI.
• Teratogenic; contraindicated in pregnancy (although not associated
with birth defects in ♀ who receive it prior to pregnancy).
• SIADH.

541

542

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Using IVI cyclophosphamide (CYC)

• Body surface area is calculated as √ (height (cm) x wt (kg)/3,600).
• Counsel re side effects and potential risks.
• Protect the bladder from haemorrhagic cystitis: vigorous oral ﬂuids,
with 1L 0.9% NaCl over 4h post-therapy. Oral mesna at –2, +2, and
+6h as (0.2 x cyclophosphamide dose in mg) per dose.
• Antiemetics, e.g. granisetron 1mg (can repeat at +12h) +
dexamethasone 10mg PO at –2h.
Monitoring for CYC-induced neutropenia
• Check WCC weekly for the ﬁrst month, every 2 weeks for the
second and third, and monthly thereafter.
• If WCC <4 x 109/L, then discontinue temporarily. Restart with a
25% dose reduction when WCC has recovered, and resume weekly
monitoring.
• If the WCC is falling rapidly, e.g. by >2 x 109/L between tests, reduce
the dose by 25% pre-emptively.
• If WCC <1 x 109/L or WCC <4 x 109/L persists for >2 weeks, then
restart at low dose (e.g. 25–50mg/day) only after WCC recovers.
• For IV CYC, check WCC the day of the proposed pulse. If <4 x
109/L, postpone until >4 x 109/L, and reduce dose by 25%.
• Check WCC 14 days after each pulse; if WCC nadir:
• 2–3 x 109/L, reduce the dose of the next pulse by 20%.
• 1–2 x 109/L, reduce by 40%.

Protecting against gonadal cyclophosphamide
toxicity
Glomerular disease, particularly SLE, often affects ♀ of childbearing age.
Cyclophosphamide (CYC) treatment is associated with a signiﬁcant risk
of premature ovarian failure (POF). This may play an important role in
the choice of induction therapy but must be balanced against the risks of
potential undertreatment.
When given continuously, GnRH analogues induce reduced ovarian
blood ﬂow and limit ovarian exposure to CYC. In small observational
studies, the administration of GnRH analogues during treatment with
CYC for lupus nephritis demonstrably preserves ovarian function. An
example regimen is depot leuprolide acetate, ideally administered at
least 10 days prior to the commencement of CYC.

NEPHRITIS: OVERVIEW OF IMMUNE SUPPRESSION

Calcineurin inhibitors (I, M)
• Ciclosporin and tacrolimus (b p. 386).
• Limit IL-2-driven nuclear transduction, and thus T cell activation.
•  Nephrotoxic: monitor GFR throughout use.
• Given orally (although IVI available).
• SE (ciclosporin (C) and tacrolimus (T)):
• Infection (T + C), i BP (C), tremor, hirsutism (C), gum hypertrophy,
dyslipidaemia, impaired glucose tolerance (T > C), gout (C),
nephrotoxicity (T + C), microangiopathy (T + C), amongst others.
Azathioprine (M)
• Antiproliferative pro-drug metabolized to 6-mercaptopurine.
• Restricts lymphocyte proliferation through the inhibition of
folate-dependent DNA synthesis.
•  Interaction with allopurinol may precipitate profound leucopenia.
• Given orally, usually as a single daily dose.
• SE: infection, myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity (check WCC, LFT
14–21d after starting). Long-term risk of skin cancers.
Mycophenolate mofetil (I, M)
• Antiproliferative agent that inhibits lymphocyte expansion and antibody
production. It can also promote T cell apoptosis and affect cell:cell
interactions.
• Given orally in divided doses (IVI available).
• SE: infection, myelosuppression, GI toxicity (diarrhoea is not
uncommon—divide dose qds, rather than bd, or reduce dose).
Teratogenic.
Rituximab (I, possibly M)
• A chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody against B cell surface
marker that induces B cell lysis. Given IVI. Results in widespread B cell
and antibody depletion over time.
• SE: cytokine release type syndrome during infusion, infection—
particularly serious viral infections, including CMV and JC virus (the
latter the cause of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy).
Others: fever, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, hepatitis,

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

IgA nephropathy
Introduction
The most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world, affecting an
estimated 1.5% of the population. Often presents with haematuria in the
2nd and 3rd decades.
Usually idiopathic, but IgAN is also found in association with Henoch–
Schönlein purpura (b p. 650), alcoholic cirrhosis, GI disorders (coeliac
disease, inﬂammatory bowel disease), and skin and joint disorders (spondyloarthropathies, dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis).
 Previously considered relatively benign, it is now recognized that 30–
50% will progress to signiﬁcant CKD over time. The remainder will either
enter remission or have persistent low-grade haematuria/proteinuria

Pathogenesis
The majority of IgA (both IgA1 and 2) is produced by plasma cells and
freely circulates before hepatic metabolism. In IgAN, abnormally glycosylated polymeric IgA1, with an increased tendency for self-aggregation
and complex formation, is deposited in the glomerular mesangium. These
deposits are seen in 3–16% of healthy individuals with no renal disease,
suggesting that deposition of IgA alone is insufﬁcient to induce injury.
Co-deposits of IgG and C3 may contribute to severity. The predominance
of IgA1 over IgA2 is due to the abnormal glycosylation of O-linked polysaccharides that are unique to the hinge region of IgA1.
IgA binding of mesangial Fc receptors l mesangial cell activation l production of platelet-derived growth factor and other cytokines l mesangial
cell proliferation, matrix synthesis, inﬂammatory cells recruitment, and
local injury (see Fig. 7.4).
Infection, particularly mucosal, and hypersensitivity are suggested precipitants. However, it seems likely that an aberrant IgA immune response
is more important than a particular antigen, with polymeric IgA found in
plasma cells.
There is evidence of a genetic inﬂuence, but it is complex and polygenic
and difﬁcult to study, owing to the often ‘latent’ nature of the disease.

Symptoms and signs
• Often presents as asymptomatic urinary abnormalities, particularly
microscopic haematuria.
• Haematuria may be macroscopic, classically timed with upper
respiratory illnesses (so-called ‘synpharyngetic haematuria’).
• Associated proteinuria is common, although nephrotic range
proteinuria (>3g/day) is unusual (<15%).
• Consider in young adults presenting with urinary abnormalities 9 CKD.
• i BP is common and often difﬁcult to control.
• 2 IgAN may present as a rapidly progressive GN with AKI
(b p. 71).
• Extrarenal manifestations, including a purpuric skin rash, can occur, and
there appears to be overlap with Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP).
For discussion, see b p. 651.

IGA NEPHROPATHY

Investigations
•
•
•
•
•

SCr, U&E, eGFR, serum albumin, bone proﬁle, lipid proﬁle.

• Renal biopsy (b p. 80).

Histology
• Light microscopy: mesangial cell proliferation and increased mesangial
matrix (may be focal or diffuse).
• Immunostaining: conﬁrms mesangial IgA deposits with C3. Possible
co-deposition of IgG and IgM.
• Electron microscopy: mesangial deposits near the paramesangial GBM.

Classiﬁcation
A lack of historical agreement concerning precise histological classiﬁcation
has rendered trial data difﬁcult to interpret and accord on best treatment
difﬁcult to reach. The 2009 Oxford Classiﬁcation was based on a consensus view of 265 biopsy specimens. The following variables were associated
with renal outcome, independent of baseline features and control of BP
and urinary protein excretion:
• Mesangial hypercellularity score.
• Segmental glomerulosclerosis.
• Endocapillary hypercellularity.
• Tubular atrophy/interstitial ﬁbrosis.
• (One drawback is that the classiﬁcation does not include crescentic/
necrotic lesions.)
It is hoped that this classiﬁcation may help to stratify an individual patient’s
prognosis and determine their treatment at the time of biopsy (e.g. endocapillary proliferation may help to predict steroid responsiveness).

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

IgA nephropathy: management
Introduction
The treatment of IgAN is unsatisfactory because of the heterogeneity of
the disease itself and the paucity of good clinical trial data. Prevention of
progressive renal impairment is the key therapeutic goal. However, many
patients have slowly progressive disease (decline in GFR of 71–3mL/min/
yr), so long-term studies are urgently required.
Current options are broadly divided into non-immunosuppressive and
immunosuppressive strategies.

Stratifying patients: key features of a poor prognosis at
presentation
•
•
•
•

Impaired renal function.
Heavy proteinuria (>3g/day).
(Difﬁcult to control) hypertension.
Signiﬁcant tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis and glomerulosclerosis on renal
biopsy (see Oxford classiﬁcation, b p. 545).
• Rapidly progressive crescentic IgAN.
Low-risk patients (no poor prognostic features)
• Normal GFR.
• Isolated microscopic, or episodic macroscopic, haematuria.
• Proteinuria <500mg/day (uPCR <50mg/mmol).
• Normotensive.
No speciﬁc treatment is necessary in this group, but regular surveillance
(e.g. annual BP, SCr, eGFR, uPCR) is recommended. X Many centres will
manage these patients without a renal biopsy and, therefore, without a
speciﬁc diagnosis of IgAN (b p. 67). Persistent haematuria implies ongoing immune activity. Proteinuria implies more severe disease, and the
amount will increase with activity and progression.
Medium-risk patients (no poor prognostic features)
• Older age.
• Normal GFR or only slight d.
• Proteinuria >500mg/day (uPCR >50mg/mmol).
• Hypertension.
Non-immunosuppressive treatment
• 2 Reduce BP and proteinuria.
• Aim for target BP of ≤125/75mmHg, ideally with ACE-I as ﬁrst
agent (ARB if not tolerated).
• If normal BP, but proteinuria, ACE-I for proteinuria reduction.
• X Dual blockade of A2, using combined ACE-I + ARB, may offer
additional beneﬁt (d proteinuria but no data on renal outcomes).
• If tolerated, titrate therapy to reduce proteinuria to <1g/day (uPCR
<100mg/mmol) and ideally <0.5g/day (uPCR <50mg/mmol).

IGA NEPHROPATHY: MANAGEMENT

• X Fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids):
• Limited data to suggest a role in the prevention of progression.
• However, study data are conﬂicting—and not all patients included
were on ACE-I/ARB.
• Presumed to modulate the production/action of eicosanoids.
• Given as ﬁsh oil (e.g. Maxepa® 5g bd).
• GI intolerance (including halitosis) often limits patient acceptability.
• Overall, a safe and justiﬁable adjunct to ACE-I. Consider in those
where uPCR >100mg/mmol despite ACE-I/ARB.
High-risk patients
• Difﬁcult to treat, with progression to ESRD not uncommon.
• Signiﬁcant proteinuria, e.g. >1g/day (uPCR >100mg/mmol), esp. if
nephrotic range (>3g/day; uPCR >300mg/mmol).
• Proteinuria fails to decrease with ACE-I/ARB therapy.
• Signiﬁcantly impaired renal function at outset or progressive d in GFR.
• Crescentic change on biopsy.
• Signiﬁcant chronic histological damage, such as glomerulosclerosis,
heralds a poor prognosis, regardless of treatment.
Non-immunosuppressive treatment
• As for medium-risk patients.
Immunosuppressive treatment
• Give in conjunction with ACE-I/ARB.
• Optimum therapy uncertain. Conﬂicting data from small studies
of inadequate duration where inclusion of low-risk patients skews
outcomes.
• Corticosteroids:
• Some evidence of beneﬁt if proteinuria >1g/day and eGFR >50mL/
min.
• Trial of 0.5mg/kg prednisolone alternate days for 6 months or, if
nephrotic range proteinuria, 0.5–1mg/kg/day for 8 weeks.
• X Cyclophosphamide:
• Reserved for severe active disease (rapidly progressive clinical
course and >50% crescentic change, with severe active
inﬂammation) where aggressive treatment may spare renal function.
• Prednisolone 0.5–1mg/kg/day + cyclophosphamide 2mg/kg/day
for 8 weeks, followed by tapering prednisolone and conversion to
maintenance azathioprine 2mg/kg/day.
• Severity of renal dysfunction and degree of chronic damage on
kidney biopsy will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence outcomes.
• Limited evidence that treating as an RPGN with pulse MP/
cyclophosphamide 9 PEX may improve renal prognosis.
• Other:
• MMF may d proteinuria and rate of GFR decline—however, data
are not consistent, so further studies are awaited.
• Tonsillectomy is not generally recommended for synpharyngetic
disease.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Post-infectious glomerulonephritis
Introduction
PIGN is classically associated with streptococcal infection, but infection of
almost any cause may be associated with an acute nephritic syndrome and
a diffuse proliferative GN on kidney.
2 Beware chronic, deep-seated, and concealed sources of sepsis, e.g.
endocarditis (b p. 692), foreign bodies (e.g. ventriculoatrial shunt), and
abscesses.

Common associations of post-infectious GN
• Bacterial: streptococcal, staphylococcal, pneumococcal,
meningococcal, salmonella, mycobacterial, syphilis.
• Viruses: inﬂuenza B, mumps, rubella, coxsackie, hepatitis B,
EBV, CMV.
• Fungi: candida, Coccidioides, Histoplasma.
• Parasites: malaria, ﬁliariasis, toxoplasmosis, or schistosomiasis.

Acute post-streptococcal GN
Introduction
An immune complex-mediated GN that usually occurs in childhood (age
<7 years). Now rare in developed countries. Classically, follows 10–
21 days after a streptococcal sore throat but often occurs after infection
elsewhere, e.g. tonsillitis, pharyngitis (commonly), impetigo, otitis media,
and cellulitis.
Pathophysiology
Infection with nephritogenic Lanceﬁeld group A B-haemolytic
Streptococcus (esp. types 12 and 49) is followed by a latent period during
which immune complexes form, circulate, and then deposit in glomeruli.
Nephritis-associated plasmin receptor (NAPIr) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE-B) are two suggested culpable antigens.
Clinical presentation
Varies from asymptomatic microscopic haematuria through to an acute
nephritic syndrome, with frank haematuria, oliguria, oedema, i BP, pulmonary oedema, and AKI. Bilateral loin pain or renal angle tenderness s
renal engorgement may occur.
Investigations
Urinalysis. Urine microscopy for red cell casts 9 pyuria. SCr, U&E, FBC,
Ca2+, LFT. uPCR. Anti-streptolysin O titre (ASOT) or anti-DNase B (for
group A streptococci) may be positive.  Note if only ASOT is used to
screen, it can be falsely negative or blunted, particularly in skin infections
(or if antibiotics have been given). Complement components: d C3, with
normal C4. Rheumatoid factor may be positive. Consider full immunological and serological screen if in diagnostic doubt, particularly in adults (see
b p. 40).

POST-INFECTIOUS GLOMERULONEPHRITIS

In children, suspect if good clinical history and documented evidence
of relevant infection. A renal biopsy is rarely necessary, unless resolution
does not begin within 1 week.
In adults, main differentials are IgAN, MCGN, SLE, HSP, and other vasculitides. A biopsy is more likely to be undertaken to conﬁrm the diagnosis.
Histology
Diffuse proliferative changes with hypercellularity. Extensive neutrophilic inﬁltration and red cell casts. Crescentic change and frank necroses
are unusual. Immunoﬂuorescence: IgG and C3 deposition in diffuse
granular pattern in both the mesangium and glomerular capillary walls.
EM: ‘dome-shaped’, electron-dense deposits in the subepithelial aspects
of the capillary walls, with endothelial cell swelling. Similar to the changes
seen in MCGN (for graphic, see b p. 551).
Clinical course
Generally, PIGN is self-limiting once (if) the underlying infection resolves.
It is associated with a full renal recovery (even after AKI). Resolution usually begins after 7–10 days. Recurrence is rare. Urinary abnormalities may
persist for many years after recovery, although isolated microscopic haematuria has little prognostic value. Proteinuria, i BP, and CKD also occur,
so patients should be offered follow-up.
Treatment
• 2 Ensure the predisposing infection has resolved. If ongoing, treat
actively with a penicillin or other appropriate antibiotic.
• If volume overload: restrict salt (<80mmol/day or <5g/day) and ﬂuid
(assess volume status and UO regularly to tailor restriction, e.g.
500–1000mL/day).
• Treat i BP: salt and water overload is common, so start with loop
diuretic (e.g. furosemide 40–160mg PO/IV). Escalate with additional
agents, such as a CCB or an ACE-I (with caution), as necessary.
• Renal replacement, as per standard indications (b p. 172).

Shunt nephritis
Originally coined to describe the GN associated with a chronically
infected ventriculoatrial or ventriculojugular shunt used to treat hydrocephalus. In the modern era, bacterial bioﬁlms on an indwelling central
venous cannula or cardiac pacing apparatus are more likely to be the
source of low-grade infection (l immune complex formation and glomerular deposition).
Clinical features in such scenarios include:
• Fever.
• Haematuria, proteinuria, and i SCr.
• Splenomegaly.
• i ESR, CRP, d Hb, and d C3.
• Histology is similar to PIGN.
Removal of the foreign body is essential for resolution.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis
Confusingly, also called membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).

Introduction
MCGN is a histological term used to describe a pattern of injury, rather
than a distinct GN. Can be idiopathic but commonly secondary to a variety
of causes.

MCGN associations
With cryoglobulins
• Hepatitis C (less commonly B) (b p. 686).
• Mixed cryoglobulinaemia unrelated to HCV (b p. 634).
Without cryoglobulins
• Shunt nephritis and other chronic infections, including endocarditis
and visceral abscesses (b p. 692).
• SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome.
• HBV, HCV, HIV, parvovirus B19.
• TB, leprosy.
• Malaria, schistosomiasis.
• Complement deﬁciencies (e.g. factor H).
• TMA.
• Plasma cell dyscrasia (e.g. myeloma), lymphoma.
• Transplant glomerulopathy (b p. 415).

Classiﬁcation and histology
The subendothelial and mesangial deposition of immune complexes
implies a common pathogenic mechanism (see Fig. 7.5). All subtypes
have a characteristic ‘double contour’ or ‘basement membrane splitting’
appearance of the GBM s to the interposition of mesangial cell cytoplasm
between the endothelium and GBM.
Type I MCGN
• Characterized by mesangial hypercellularity and discrete immune
deposits in the mesangium and subendothelial space. Monocyte
inﬁltration causes a lobular pattern to the glomerular tufts. Crescentic
change can occur. Immunoﬂuorescence shows granular IgG and C3
deposition within capillaries and mesangium.
• Commonly associated with cryoglobulinaemia (with HCV).
• Also associated with SLE, endocarditis, plasma cell dyscrasias (e.g.
MIDD and AL amyloid), and HBV infection.
• Less commonly, a primary idiopathic MCGN (consider this a diagnosis
of exclusion).

MESANGIOCAPILLARY GLOMERULONEPHRITIS

Dense deposit disease (type II MCGN)
• Continuous, dense, ribbon-like intramembranous deposits along
the GBM, tubule, and Bowman’s capsule. These contain C3 but no
immunoglobulin.
• Related to deﬁciency in complement factor H (often with partial
lipodystrophy and retinal abnormalities).
Type III MCGN
• Immune deposits, as in type I, but complete disruption of the GBM
with membranous change.
• Three distinct varieties of type III MCGN have been described.
• An inherited form is associated with chromosome 1q32.
C3 glomerulopathy
• Isolated deposition of C3, often with similar features to type I, but with
no immunoglobulin deposition.
• Associated with genetic or acquired abnormalities of complement
regulation.
• Serum C3 nephritic factor is positive (see b p. 552).
• Probably part of the spectrum of dense deposit disease.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

MCGN: presentation and management
Presentation
Idiopathic MCGN tends to affect ♂ = ♀ aged 8–30. It carries a relatively
poor prognosis: 750% ESRD at 10 years.

Symptoms and signs
All may present as asymptomatic urinary abnormalities, acute nephritis,
nephrotic syndrome, or progressive renal failure. i BP is particularly
common.
For presentation of cryoglobulinaemia, see b p. 634.
MCGN type II may be associated with partial lipodystrophy (absent subcutaneous issue in the face and upper limbs) and retinal abnormalities
(pigmentation and visual ﬁeld deﬁcits).

Investigations
• SCr, eGFR, U&E, albumin, LFTs, uPCR (or uACR), microscopy for red
cell casts.
• 2 Consider potential underlying causes: immunoglobulins, serum and
urinary protein electrophoresis (9 serum free light chains), hepatitis
serology (for HCV and MCGN, see b p. 686), rheumatoid factor,
cryoglobulins, complement components, and C3 nephritic factor
(b p. 41).

Complement in MCGN
• Type I MCGN:
• Classical pathway is activated by immune complexes l normal/d
C3 and d C4).
• Type II MCGN (dense deposit disease):
• Alternate pathway is activated ldC3, normal C4.
• A stabilizing IgG binding a C3 convertase (C3Bb) occurs in dense
deposit disease l persistent cleavage of C3. This is termed the
C3 nephritic factor.
• Type III MCGN:
• Findings similar to type II but without the C3 nephritic factor.

Management
• 2 Exclude s causes of MCGN prior to treatment.
• For treatment of HCV-related MCGN, see b p. 688.
•  Evidence-based treatment strategies are lacking for primary MCGN.
Many early studies almost certainly (inadvertently) included patients
with s MCGN.
General measures
• Stop smoking (as in all progressive nephropathies).
• Treat i BP vigorously.
• Reduce proteinuria: use ACE-I or ARB.
• Restrict salt intake 9 diuretic (b p. 538).
• Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and dipyridamole is no longer
widely advocated.

MCGN: PRESENTATION AND MANAGEMENT

Immune suppression
The following strategies may offer beneﬁt. They are generally reserved for
patients with the nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal impairment.
• Corticosteroids (tapering prednisolone started at 1mg/kg/day). An
alternate day, long-term corticosteroid regimen has been common in
paediatric practice.
• Corticosteroids 9 cyclophosphamide 1.5–2mg/kg/day for ≤6 months.
• Corticosteroids 9 MMF for ≤6 months is a potentially less toxic
alternative.

MCGN: towards a new classiﬁcation
Until recently, MCGN was generally classiﬁed as described on b p. 550;
i.e. either p (idiopathic) or s if an underlying cause could be identiﬁed. p
MCGN was further classiﬁed into I–III based on ultrastructural appearances and distribution of electron-dense deposits. More recently, a better understanding of the pathogenetic role of complement in MCGN
has informed a new view of the lesion, with categorisation into either
Ig-mediated disease (driven by the classical complement pathway) or
non-Ig-mediated disease (driven by the alternative complement pathway) (see Fig. 7.6). The non-Ig-mediated group, referred to as C3 glomerulopathy, includes dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis.
C3 glomerulopathy is a proliferative lesion, usually with a MCGN-type
appearance on light microscopy. C3 alone on immunostaining suggests
overactivity of the alternative complement pathway.
Historically, clinical trials within MCGN have selected patients with
comparable histology on light microscopy – meaning that many different
etiologies were probably represented. It is hoped that advances in clinicopathological understanding will foster diagnostic clarity and generate
disease-speciﬁc therapies.

Fig. 7.6 Reclassiﬁcation of MCGN has promoted a new group of diseases called
C3 glomerulopathies. The classiﬁcation may also be usefully extended to other
forms of proliferative GN, even if they do not have an MCGN pattern on light
microscopy. An Ig-mediated GN should prompt an investigation into infectious,
malignant, or autoimmune causes (immune-complex formation). A GN with C3
staining alone suggests overactivity of the alternative complement pathway; i.e. a
complement-mediated GN. Such diseases, including C3GN and Dense Deposit
Disease, have been termed C3 glomerulopathies and should suggest investigation
of the alternative complement pathway (e.g. functional assays, genetic mutation
analysis, and autoantibody screening). From Bomback, A.S. and Appel, G.B. Nat.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

The nephrotic syndrome
Introduction
A clinical syndrome deﬁned as proteinuria >3.5g/1.73m2/day that is associated with hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, hyperlipidaemia, lipiduria (and
thrombotic tendency).
The syndrome arises as a result of a failure of the glomerular ﬁltration
barrier to restrict the passage of proteins into Bowman’s space. It implies
structural abnormalities within the glomerular ﬁlter.

Primer: the glomerular ﬁlter (see b p. 916)
• Comprises:
• Charged endothelial cell glycocalyx layer.
• Endothelium and its fenestrations.
• The glomerular basement membrane (GBM).
• Interdigitating podocytes that form a slit diaphragm.
• The passage of albumin, with its net negative charge, through the
glomerular ﬁlter is prevented by size-speciﬁc factors (e.g. the slit
diaphragm) and charge-speciﬁc factors (e.g. the anionic endothelial
glycocalyx and GBM).
• Any albumin that escapes into Bowman’s space is efﬁciently
reabsorbed in the proximal tubule via receptor-mediated
endocytosis. It is then degraded and returned to the circulation as
peptide fragments.
Many primary and secondary causes of the nephrotic syndrome are now
thought to be due to abnormalities of, or injury to, podocytes and the slit
diaphragm (‘podocytopathies’).
How does proteinuria cause the clinical syndrome?
• The cause of hypoalbuminaemia is not as straightforward as one
might think. The liver is actually capable of synthesizing 25g albumin/
day: much higher than urinary losses.
• Potential explanations:
• Larger quantities of albumin pass through the glomerular ﬁlter but
are reabsorbed and catabolized within the renal tubules (i.e. the
degree of proteinuria underestimates protein losses).
• Other circulating factors alter the production of albumin by the
liver in response to protein losses.
• Hypoalbuminaemia itself is not usually severe enough to directly
explain the profound oedema of the nephrotic syndrome.
• Potential explanations:
• The (classical) ‘underﬁll’ hypothesis: low plasma oncotic pressure
ld circulating volume l Na+ and water retention.
• The ‘overﬁll’ hypothesis: proteinuria directly causes i tubular Na+
reabsorption.

THE NEPHROTIC SYNDROME

• Hyperlipidaemia is caused by i hepatic lipoprotein synthesis s to
reduced plasma oncotic pressure.
• Thrombotic tendency is caused by i hepatic synthesis of procoagulant
factors, i platelet aggregation, and i urinary losses of anticoagulant
factors.

Causes of the nephrotic syndrome
In descending order of frequency in adults:
• Membranous nephropathy.
• Minimal change nephropathy.
• SLE.
• Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis.
• Mesangiocapillary (or membranoproliferative) glomerulonephritis
(MCGN).
• Renal amyloidosis.
• IgAN.
• Light chain deposition disease.
2 Diabetic nephropathy may also present with nephrotic range proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome.
Investigation of the nephrotic syndrome
• SCr, eGFR, U&E, albumin and total protein, LFT, bone proﬁle.
• Lipid proﬁle (preferably fasting).
• Urine microscopy for casts or lipid bodies (b p. 25).
• uPCR (or uACR).
• Urinary selectivity index (particularly in children). Calculated as the
transferrin:IgG ratio. Selective proteinuria refers to loss of proteins of
lower MW (<100kDa), such as albumin or transferrin. Non-selective
proteinuria includes proteins of higher MW, such as Igs (b p. 60).
• Consider full immunological and serological screen (b p. 40).
• USS kidneys.
• Renal biopsy (b p. 80).

555

556

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

The nephrotic syndrome: general
management principles
Salt and ﬂuid restriction
• i Na+ retention and i blood volume l dependent oedema.
• 2 Monitor volume status carefully. Include regular measurement
of weight, aiming for 0.5–1kg loss/day. Chart intake and output
wherever possible (however, urinary tract catheterization is rarely
necessary).
• Salt-restrict to ≤2g/day.
• Diuretics: a loop diuretic, such as furosemide, e.g. 40mg/day
PO, increasing, as necessary, to 250mg daily. In massive oedema,
IV diuretics may be required to overcome impaired oral drug
absorption (s to gut oedema).
• Many clinicians use IV furosemide in combination with salt-poor
albumin (e.g. 50–100mg furosemide in 100mL 20% human albumin
solution over 1h) to augment natriuresis and diuresis; however, the
enhanced effect may simply be due to volume expansion.
• Add-on thiazide-type diuretics (e.g. metolazone 2.5–5mg PO
od) may help to promote diuresis through a synergistic effect
with high-dose loop diuretics ( requires regular (often daily)
measurement of Na+ and K+ to prevent profound electrolyte
imbalances—use with caution, especially in an outpatient setting).

Reduction of proteinuria
• Proteinuria will itself aggravate tubulointerstitial inﬂammation (l
ﬁbrosis) and 6 accelerate renal damage and functional decline.
• Heavy proteinuria exposes nephrotic patients to infection and
malnutrition.
• Use ACE-I or ARB for their anti-proteinuric effect. Titrate
carefully toward full dose (consider night-time administration if
hypotension).
• May reduce proteinuria by up to 50% at 8 weeks and 6 prevent
progression.
• Treat i BP, aiming for ≤125/75mmHg.
• Protein restriction to 0.8g/kg/day.  This requires careful
nutritional assessment and dietetic supervision.

Hypercoagulability
• Risk factors for thrombosis in nephrotic syndrome:
• Duration of syndrome.
• Degree of proteinuria.
• Serum albumin <20g/L.
• Underlying membranous nephropathy (b p. 564). 2 Up to 20% of
patients with nephrotic syndrome s to membranous nephropathy
will develop a DVT.
• 3 Breathlessness in a nephrotic patient may not always be s to
volume overload; it may indicate pulmonary thromboembolism.

THE NEPHROTIC SYNDROME: GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

• Flank pain and haematuria suggest renal vein thrombosis (b p. 590).
• Prophylactic anticoagulation with SC heparin (and sometimes warfarin)
in high-risk patients (b p. 892).
• Formally anticoagulate those with proven DVT or thromboembolic
episode.
• Treat for the duration of the nephrotic syndrome; aim INR 2–3.

Infection
• Low IgG levels predispose to infection.
• Treat infections promptly, with appropriate cover for polysaccharide
encapsulated organisms: Strep pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Salmonella typhi,
Cryptocoocus neoformans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mnemonic: Some
Nasty Killers Have Some Capsule Protection).
• Offer persistently nephrotic patients vaccination against pneumococcal
disease.
• Infection may also complicate immune suppressive treatment of the
nephrotic syndrome (b p. 540).

Dyslipidaemia
• Nephrotic syndrome li hepatic synthesis and d catabolism of LDL
cholesterol (possibly in response to d plasma oncotic pressure).
• Successful treatment of elevated LDL cholesterol may prevent CV
morbidity and slow decline in renal function.
• Dietary restriction is usually insufﬁcient and drug treatment with
statins is often appropriate.
• Treatment of underlying nephrotic syndrome will lead to resolution of
dyslipidaemia.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Minimal change disease
Introduction
MCD is less common in adults (725% of cases of the nephrotic syndrome)
than in children. It generally carries an excellent prognosis.
The pathogenesis of minimal change nephropathy (MCD) is uncertain,
but altered T lymphocyte activity and production of a glomerular permeability factor (l podocyte dysfunction) are suspected. Albuminuria essentially results from a failure of the glomerular ﬁlter.

Aetiology
May be idiopathic (p) or s to:
• Drugs: NSAIDs (most common), antimicrobials, lithium,
bisphosphonates, and penicillamine (many others).
• Cancer: haematological malignancies (most common), solid organ
malignancies (rare: more commonly associated with membranous
nephropathy).
• Infections (rarely): esp. TB, syphilis, HIV, mycoplasma, HCV.
• Atopy: 30% of MCD patients.
• Immunizations.

Symptoms and signs
• Oedema, often massive, with facial and periorbital swelling, ascites,
pleural and pericardial effusions.
• Proteinuria and, rarely, microscopic haematuria on urinalysis.
• Urine may be foamy (protein has a detergent effect).
• Lipiduria may be visible on microscopy as fat bodies.
• May present with infections (esp. skin and soft tissue) or hypotension
(s to hypovolaemia).
• Abdominal pain s to spontaneous peritonitis.
• Venous thrombosis (e.g. renal or deep vein).
• AKI (s to ATI).

Investigations
• SCr, eGFR, U&E, d albumin, LFT, bone proﬁle, i cholesterol.
• uPCR or uACR (tests for selective proteinuria may be helpful)
(b p. 60).
• Urine microscopy (may show lipid bodies, hyaline or granular casts).
• Renal biopsy in adults.

Histology
• Normal on light microscopy (hence ‘minimal change’).
• Negative immunohistochemistry or immunoﬂuorescence.
• EM reveals diffuse effacement of podocyte foot processes.

Treatment
• Symptomatic treatment, as outlined on b p. 556.
• MCD remits rapidly with corticosteroids therapy; 80–90% of adults will
be in remission after 12 weeks of therapy.

MINIMAL CHANGE DISEASE

•

•

•

•
•

• Prednisolone 1mg/kg daily (to maximum of 80mg/day) until
remission achieved.
• Taper prednisolone fortnightly, then weekly, until discontinued.
• 2 Ensure treatment is continued for at least 12 weeks at ﬁrst
presentation to minimize risk of relapse.
• Taper slowly, e.g. over 6 months.
• See initiating immunosuppression (b p. 540).
Relapse can be expected in 30–70% of cases.
• First relapse and infrequent relapses should be treated as described
earlier. If relapses are more frequent and respond quickly to steroids,
then taper immediately on remission, aiming for a shorter course.
Certain subgroups will be more difﬁcult to treat.
• Recurrent relapses occur despite initial response to treatment.
‘Frequent relapse’ is generally deﬁned as two relapses inside
6 months.
• Relapse occurs during steroid treatment or within 2 weeks of
steroid withdrawal (‘steroid-dependent’).
• No response to steroids at all, i.e. no remission within 12 weeks of
treatment (‘steroid-resistant’).
2 In these situations, it is important to review the histology to
ensure diagnosis is deﬁnitely MCD, rather than a potentially less
steroid-responsive alternative, such as FSGS (b p. 560). In some
cases, this may necessitate a repeat kidney biopsy to ensure that
glomerular sampling has been adequate.
See initiating immunosuppression (b p. 540).
Consider:
• Ciclosporin 3–5mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 12 months.
 Monitor GFR carefully (51Cr-EDTA GFR is the most accurate
method for monitoring any subtle decline in GFR, e.g. annually) to
avoid or limit ciclosporin nephrotoxicity.
• Tacrolimus 0.05–0.1mg/kg/day in divided doses is an alternative.
• CNIs can be cautiously tapered to the minimum dose required
to sustain remission once this has been achieved for 3 months.
Consider stopping therapy at 1–2 years.
• Cyclophosphamide 2–2.5mg/kg/day for 8–12 weeks, then stop.
• If remission not achieved with one regimen, consider the other.
CNIs may be preferred in ♀ of childbearing age.
• MMF has been used as a steroid-sparing agent in children, and small
studies suggest modest beneﬁt in adults.
• Rituximab: several case reports suggest beneﬁt. Further clinical
trials are awaited.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Focal and segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
Background
FSGS is used primarily as a histological description, but also to refer to a
particular disease entity.
2° FSGS occurs in the context of glomerular damage and ‘dropout’ in an
already injured kidney where haemodynamic stresses damage remaining
nephrons (so-called ‘hyperﬁltration injury’).
1° or idiopathic FSGS refers to a de novo glomerulopathy, rather than the
result of associated disease.

Primary FSGS
Introduction
• ♂ > ♀ (with an additional higher risk of progressive CKD in ♂).
• It is 3x more common in black patients (where p FSGS causes 72/3
of the nephrotic syndrome). Black patients are more likely to have
mutations in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene.
• Cause remains uncertain, however podocyte injury with subsequent
abnormal podocyte responses is characteristic of the disease.
• As p FSGS disease recurs after transplantation (often immediately),
a circulating factor capable of disturbing glomerular permeability
has been implicated in some patients. This has not yet been fully
characterized, but candidates include the soluble form of the urokinase
receptor (suPAR) and VEGF.
Symptoms and signs
• Proteinuria (often very heavy); nephrotic syndrome 780%.
• Microscopic haematuria (750%).
• i BP (740%).
• Impaired renal function (725% at presentation).
Young black men presenting with heavy proteinuria (>10g/day), profound
hypoalbuminaemia (albumin <20g/L), and renal impairment tend to follow
a more severe course, often resulting in ESRD.
Investigations
• SCr, eGFR, U&E, d albumin, LFT, i total and LDL cholesterol.
• Urinalysis, uPCR, or uACR (tests for non-selective proteinuria may be
helpful) (b p. 60).
• Urine microscopy (may show lipid bodies, hyaline or granular casts).
• Renal biopsy.
Histology
• A focal (affecting some, but not all, glomeruli) and segmental (affecting
part, but not all, of the glomerular tuft) process (see Fig. 7.7).
• Mesangial matrix expansion, glomerular sclerosis, endocapillary
hypercellularity (including foam cells) and hyalinosis (hyaline deposits
in the permeable capillary wall) are all variably present.

FOCAL AND SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (FSGS)

• No abnormalities may be apparent if the sample size is small, reﬂecting
the focal nature of the disease. Such cases may then be mislabelled as
minimal change disease. Biopsies that include juxtaglomerular glomeruli
from the corticomedullary junction (affected early in the course of the
disease) have a greater chance of detecting sclerotic lesions.
• ATN and tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis are not uncommon.
• Immunostaining: no immune deposits, but IgM and C3 may be trapped
in sclerotic lesions.
• EM: foot process effacement and podocyte degeneration.
Sub-classiﬁcation
Sub-classiﬁcation of both p and, to a lesser extent, s FSGS into several
histological variants may have prognostic signiﬁcance:
• Classic FSGS: the prototype.
• Cellular variant: at least one glomerulus has segmental endocapillary
hypercellularity with capillary occlusion.
• Tip variant: at least one segmental sclerosis affects the outer ‘tip’
of the glomerulus alongside the proximal tubule. Potentially more
steroid-responsive with a better prognosis.
• Collapsing variant: collapsing FSGS is characterized by collapse and
sclerosis of the entire glomerular tuft, with GBM wrinkling, cystic tubular
changes, and interstitial ﬁbrosis. There is no endocapillary proliferation.
2 Often due to HIVAN (b p. 676), but occurs with other viral diseases
(esp. parvovirus B19). Also described in other situations, e.g. following
high-dose bisphosphonates. Collapsing FSGS typically presents with
torrential nephrotic syndrome and rapidly declining renal function.
• Perihilar variant: perihilar hyalinosis and sclerosis in >50% of the
glomeruli with sclerotic lesions. Often seen with the hyperﬁltration
injury of s FSGS.

562

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Secondary FSGS
A less speciﬁc histological ﬁnding, usually resulting from glomerular
hyperﬁltration (an adaptive response to maintain GFR). Histologically, glomerulomegaly and perihilar sclerosis may be more prominent, with less
marked podocyte hyperplasia and, on EM, less widespread foot process
effacement.
Secondary FSGS tends to present with less proteinuria and hypoalbuminaemia than the primary variant; however, progressive CKD is relatively
common. It is associated with the following conditions:
• Familial (see below).
• Infection (podocyte invasion):
• HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), parvovirus B19.
• Drugs (podocyte toxicity):
• Pamidronate, lithium, A interferon, and heroin.
• Congenital or acquired nephron mass reduction:
• Renal dysplasia, reﬂux nephropathy, renovasular disease, partial or
unilateral nephrectomy.
• Hyperﬁltration as part of a disease process:
• Morbid obesity, diabetic nephropathy, pre-eclampsia, sickle cell
disease.
• Any cause of glomerular disease with progressive scarring:
• E.g. membranous GN, IgAN, Alport syndrome, thrombotic
microangiopathy, vasculitis.

Inherited FSGS
Genetic diseases may lead to FSGS through the mutation of genes responsible for podocyte differentiation and function. These provide useful
insights into podocyte function and podocytopathies. However, genetic
testing is unnecessary in adults, unless there is a family history, as mutations are found in a small minority only and do not inﬂuence treatment.
Transient receptor potential cation 6 channel (TRPC6)
AD inheritance. A non-selective cation channel that localizes to the slit
diaphragm where it associates with podocin and nephrin. Mutations
cause childhood nephrotic syndrome.
α-actinin 4
AD inheritance. ACTN4 is an actin-bound cross-linking protein important for podocyte cytoskeletal integrity. Presents with low-grade proteinuria and slowly progressive CKD.
Podocin (NPHS2)
AR inheritance. NPHS2 encodes podocin, an integral membrane protein
that is localized to the slit diaphragm where it interacts with nephrin.
Almost 50 mutations have now been identiﬁed. May be responsible for
71/3 of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in children.

FOCAL AND SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (FSGS)

FSGS management
Overview
• Symptomatic treatment, as outlined on b p. 556.
• 2 For s FSGS, treat the underlying cause where possible.
• For p FSGS, the initiation of immune suppression is based on estimates
of renal prognosis and likely response. For non-nephrotic proteinuria,
symptomatic treatment and watchful waiting are generally advocated.
Poor prognostic factors
• Severe proteinuria (e.g. >10g/day).
• Progressive CKD.
• Interstitial ﬁbrosis on histology.
• Black race.
• No response to treatment.
• Histology: presence of collapsing variant (bad) or tip lesion (good).
If nephrotic, spontaneous remission is uncommon. Progression to ESRD
in 750% at 5 years if untreated. Some have a more protracted course, with
slow decline in kidney function over decades.
Disease-modifying treatment.
• 2 See initiation of immune suppression on b p. 540.
• Prednisolone 1mg/kg/day (max 80mg) (or alternate day 2mg/kg) for
a minimum of 4 weeks. Continue, as tolerated, for 16 weeks or until
remission is achieved.  FSGS is slow to respond, and shorter courses
of steroids are unlikely to be of beneﬁt.
• If response, taper steroids to cessation over 6 months.
• Unlike minimal change, a degree of proteinuria often persists: remission
may be complete (<0.3g/day urinary protein + serum albumin >35g/L
+ normal renal function) or partial (<3.5g/day urinary protein + 50%
reduction from peak + stabilization of renal function).
• Expect complete or partial remission in 740–60%.
• Those that relapse whilst on (tapering) steroids or <2 weeks after
cessation (on x2 occasions) are ‘steroid-dependent’, and those with no
reduction in proteinuria at 16 weeks are ‘steroid-resistant’.
• In these groups:
• Continue low-dose (0.15mg/kg/day) prednisolone.
• Add ciclosporin 3–5mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Treat
for 6 months. Aim for trough levels 125–225ng/mL. Consider
measuring accurate isotopic GFR at baseline.
• If response (expect in 770%): continue for 12 months, then taper
dose, and stop. Ciclosporin dependence, with relapse on drug
withdrawal, is not uncommon.
• Tacrolimus 0.1–0.2mg/kg/day in two divided doses is an alternative,
• MMF or cyclophosphamide (both with corticosteroids) have been
used in this situation but do not enjoy a robust evidence base.
• X Plasma exchange is sometimes used as adjunctive therapy in severe
disease unresponsive to other measures, with the aim of removing a
pathogenic circulating factor in some cases. Relapse after treatment is
common. PEX is an important part of the treatment of recurrent FSGS
post-transplantation (b p. 418).

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Membranous nephropathy (MN)
Introduction
Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the commonest causes of the
nephrotic syndrome worldwide, with a peak incidence in the 4th to 6th
decades, 2 ♂:1 ♀.
May be idiopathic (IMN) (75%) or secondary (25%) (b p. 565).

Pathogenesis
Animal models of MN suggest in situ formation of immune deposits on the
outer surface of the GBM (see Fig. 7.8). These deposits activate complement, leading to podocyte injury. Several proteins have been implicated in
the development of MN.
• The phospholipase A2 receptor: a transmembrane receptor present
in podocytes. Autoantibodies to this receptor (anti-PLA2) have been
demonstrated in 770% of ‘idiopathic’ MN.
• Neutral endopeptidase: anti-neutral endopeptidase antibodies have
been implicated in a rare antenatal form of MN.
• Cationic bovine serum albumin (cBSA): antibodies to cBSA have
been demonstrated in a small number of MN in childhood cases.
This protein may be absorbed through the immature GI tract and
subsequently lodge in the glomerular capillary wall.

Symptoms and signs
• Proteinuria, occasionally sub-nephrotic or asymptomatic, but often
heavy and associated with the nephrotic syndrome (780%).
• Microscopic haematuria is relatively common.
• i BP.
• Venous thromboembolism (2 up to 20% of patients with nephrotic
syndrome s to membranous nephropathy will develop a DVT).

MEMBRANOUS NEPHROPATHY (MN)

Secondary MN
• More common worldwide than IMN. Presentation with nephrotic
syndrome may not coincide with presentation of underlying disease.
MN may precede the presentation of malignancy by many years.
Development of nephrotic syndrome in a patient with a known
malignancy may herald a relapse of their cancer.
• Infections: HBV, HCV, HIV, malaria, syphilis, leprosy, schistosomiasis.
• Neoplasms: solid tumours (including lung, colon, breast, kidney,
stomach, oesophageal, ovarian, prostate), lymphoma, leukaemia,
mesothelioma.
• Autoimmune disease: SLE, thyroiditis, dermatitis herpetiformis,
sarcoidosis, inﬂammatory bowel disease, myasthenia gravis.
• Drugs and toxins: NSAIDs, captopril, gold, penicillamine, lithium,
clopidogrel.

Investigations
• SCr, eGFR, U&E, d albumin, LFT, bone proﬁle, i total and LDL
cholesterol, d Igs common (IgG > IgA), HBV and HCV serology, ANA.
• uPCR or uACR (tests for non-selective proteinuria may be helpful)
(b p. 60).
• Urine microscopy (may show lipid bodies, hyaline or granular casts).
• Renal biopsy.
• Consider investigations for s causes of MN.

Approaching MN
Careful history and examination are essential. Focus on:
• Drug history.
• Risk factors for hepatitis viruses or other infections (travel, sexual
history, blood transfusions, etc.).
• Malignancy?
• <10% of cases, but proportion increases with age.
• Check for recent weight loss and any localizing symptoms.
• If history and physical examination alone do not suggest an
associated neoplasm, extensive investigation is unwarranted and
unlikely to reveal a tumour.
• X Some clinicians advocate additional imaging (e.g. CT chest,
abdomen, pelvis, mammography in ♀) + upper and lower GI
endoscopy in patients aged >50.

Histology
• Light microscopy: often normal, but, in more advanced cases, diffuse
GBM thickening, with ‘spikes’ of GBM extending around subepithelial
deposits, are usually evident (best seen on silver stains). Variable
degrees of ATI and tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis may also be seen
• Immunostaining: granular IgG 9 C3 deposits within capillary wall.
Presence of the IgG4 subclass may be a pointer toward s MN.
• EM: subepithelial electron dense deposits. Foot process effacement.

566

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Idiopathic MN: treatment
Treatment
General measures
Symptomatic treatment of the nephrotic syndrome (b p. 556).

Treatment of secondary MN
Treating the underlying condition (e.g. treatment of HBV or resection of
tumour) may lead to remission of the MN and the nephrotic syndrome
in many cases. There is rarely, if ever, a role for immune suppression.
Natural history and risk stratiﬁcation
The natural history of IMN is variable, with 20–30% progressing to ESRD
and about 25–40% remitting spontaneously. It has 6 traditionally been
referred to as a ‘disease of thirds’: 71/3 spontaneously remit, 71/3 continue
to exhibit low-grade proteinuria with normal renal function, and 71/3 have
progressive CKD, eventually leading to ESRD.
Remission may be complete (<0.3g/day urinary protein, with normal
serum albumin and normal renal function) or partial (<3.5g/day urinary
protein and 50% reduction from peak protein excretion, with an improvement in serum albumin and stabilization of renal function).
Aim to predict the course of the disease.
Low risk
• Normal renal function.
• Age <50.
• ♀.
• Proteinuria <4g/day or spontaneously declining proteinuria.
• Management:
• Symptomatic treatment (b p. 556).
• Expect remission (may occur up to 2 years after diagnosis; mean
715 months), but regularly reassess risk.
High risk
• Progressive renal impairment.
• Age >50.
• ♂.
• Proteinuria >8g/day.
• Persistent proteinuria >4g/day for >6 months, with no evidence of
decline (despite ACE-I/ARB).
• Management: consider disease-modifying treatment with immune
suppression, unless renal biopsy demonstrates excessive interstitial
scarring (6 likely to be irretrievable) or kidneys are small on USS.
Most clinicians will wait for 6 months to see if spontaneous remission
occurs, but treat earlier if severe, symptomatic nephrotic syndrome, or
early decline in renal function.

IDIOPATHIC MN: TREATMENT

Immune suppression
• Disease-modifying therapy: the aim of immunosuppression is to reduce
proteinuria, spare renal function, and induce complete, or partial,
remission.
• Achievement of either complete or partial remission, either
spontaneously or after treatment, is associated with a much improved
prognosis.
• 2 See initiation of immune suppression on b p. 540.
• Alternating monthly steroids and alkylating agents for 6 months—the
‘Ponticelli regimen’:
• Month 1: IV methylprednisolone 1g x 3, then oral
methylprednisolone (0.5mg/kg/day) for the remainder of the month.
• Month 2: oral cyclophosphamide 2.0mg/kg/day (or chlorambucil
0.15–0.2mg/kg/day).
• Month 3: repeat month 1.
• Month 4: repeat month 2.
• Month 5: repeat month 1.
• Month 6: repeat month 2.
• For practical reasons, many clinicians adapt this to a non-cyclical
regimen, giving prednisolone 1mg/kg/day PO daily (max 60 mg)
(with or without 3x pulses of IV methylprednisolone at the outset)
+ cyclophosphamide 1.5–2.0mg/kg/day PO, tapering steroids against
response. X Whilst this is common practice, it does not have the
evidence base available for the cyclical regimen.
• Most clinicians are less familiar with chlorambucil so prefer to use
cyclophosphamide.
• CNIs are an alternative, particularly where alkylating agents are
undesirable (or have been unsuccessful).
• Ciclosporin 3.5–5mg/kg/day in two divided doses, with low
prednisolone (0.15mg/kg/day) for at least 6 months.
• Tacrolimus 0.05–0.075mg/kg/day in two divided doses may also
be used.
• Start at lower dose, and titrate up, as tolerated.  Watch GFR
closely. CNI levels should be monitored, particularly during the
initial stages.
• If no response, stop at 6 months. In those that respond, aim to
reduce to the minimum dose that maintains remission, and continue
for at least 12 months.
• MMF may have a role (in combination with steroids), but supporting
evidence is currently lacking, and there appears to be a higher risk of
relapse.
• Rituximab (e.g. 375mg/m2 weekly x 4 doses) has been used, with
encouraging success in observational studies. Long-term follow-up is
currently lacking, so relapse rates are unknown.
Relapse
• Treat with the same regimen that was successful initially, although an
alkylating agent should, in general, only be used once more.

567

568

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Hereditary nephropathies
Alport syndrome
Classically presents as a triad of:
• Family history of progressive nephropathy.
• Sensorineural deafness.
• Ocular abnormalities.
Defective basement membrane formation in the glomerulus, cochlea, and
eye accounts for these ﬁndings. Although inheritance is varied, an X-linked
inherited mutation in the COL4A5 gene (>200 described) that encodes A5
type IV collagen accounts for 80% of cases. This leads to afﬂicted ♂, with
♀ carriers. Autosomal recessive (AR) forms account for 715% and autosomal dominant (AD) for 75% (gene: COL4A3/COL4A4 on chromosome 2).
Affects 71 in 5,000 live births.

Thin membrane disease (TMD)
A common AD inherited (occasionally sporadic) familial condition, presenting with microscopic haematuria, almost always with normal renal
function. TMD was previously known as ‘benign familial haematuria’. It is
present in 75% of post-mortem studies and is a relatively common ﬁnding
during the assessment of potential live kidney donors. The normal GBM is
9 350nm thick—but, in TMD, it is often less than 200nm (although otherwise structurally normal).
The underlying defect probably affects type IV collagen integration into
the GBM and results in a partial failure of basement membrane function.
40% of families have mutations in COL4A3/COL4A4 (>20 described, usually a single nucleotide substitution associated with a single family). These
probably represent the benign end of the spectrum of Alport syndrome.
The additional TMD genetic loci have not yet been identiﬁed.
Symptoms and signs
Both present with persistent microscopic haematuria. This occurs earlier
in Alport’s—no haematuria by age 10 in a ♂ makes the diagnosis unlikely.
Alport’s: proteinuria (often nephrotic range) and i BP usually present
by adolescence. Progressive CKD l ESRD by the 3rd to 4th decade (72%
of an ESRD programme). Severity is often consistent within a family.
High-tone sensorineural deafness (in the majority) and anterior lenticonus (conical, rather than spherical, lens, leading to distorted vision: 720%).
X-linked ♀ carriers often have microscopic haematuria alone. However,
proteinuria and progression to ESRD by 5th decade in 710–15%.
The AR form is clinically similar to disease in X-linked ♂. The AD form
is clinically very heterogeneous.
TMD: often a diagnosis of exclusion. Probably accounts for 725% of
all microscopic haematuria presenting to a renal clinic (the majority of
whom will not undergo a renal biopsy). Macroscopic haematuria in 720%.
Proteinuria, i BP, and renal impairment are rare. TMD has no extrarenal
manifestations.

HEREDITARY NEPHROPATHIES

Investigations
See Table 7.2.
• Documentation of inheritance may be very helpful: AD inheritance of
haematuria, with no proteinuria, CKD, or extrarenal manifestations,
suggests TMD (although a conﬁrmatory biopsy in at least one family
member is desirable).
• Urinalysis 9 microscopy, uPCR or uACR. SCr, eGFR, U&E, albumin.
• Audiometry for subclinical hearing deﬁcits and ophthalmic assessment.
• Skin biopsy with negative α5 type IV collagen staining is much less
invasive than a renal biopsy and may be helpful in the assessment of
possible X-linked Alport syndrome.
• Renal biopsy:
• Alport’s: non-speciﬁc glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial
scarring on LM (esp. if i SCr). A thin GBM on EM, with a
characteristic ‘basket weave’ pattern, is characteristic.
• TMD: normal light microscopy. EM demonstrates reduction in GBM
thickness.
• Staining of the GBM for the A chain of type IV collagen is
instructive. In X-linked and AR Alport syndrome, the A3, A4, and
A5 chains are absent (with a mosaic pattern of expression in ♀
carriers); in AD Alport syndrome, the A4 and A5 chains are absent,
whereas, in TMN, normal A chain distribution is preserved.
• Genetic testing for COL4A3/A4/A5 mutations is available, but the large
number of mutations means it is not always straightforward. However,
it may be useful for prenatal diagnosis in previously characterized
families.
Management
• Patients with uncomplicated TMD can be reassured but should be
followed up at annual intervals (urinalysis 9 uPCR, BP, and eGFR).
• No speciﬁc treatment for Alport syndrome. As with all progressive
nephropathies, good control of BP, use of ACE-I/ARB, and proteinuria
reduction should be considered early; this includes ♀ carriers.
• Family members should be screened for haematuria and i BP.
• Offer genetic counselling.
Transplantation and Alport syndrome
In <5%, transplanted Alport patients may develop de novo anti-GBM antibodies that cause an RPGN; i.e. donor α5 type IV collagen is recognized
as non-self. It is not a contraindication to transplantation.

Nail-patella syndrome
A rare (720 pmp) autosomal dominant condition that has renal involvement in 750% cases.
It is caused by mutation of the LMX1B gene found on chromosome 9q34. This codes for a transcription factor critical to other genes
involved in the maintenance of GBM structure and function, including
COL4A3 and COL4A4.
Renal disease Usually presents in adolescence: microscopic haematuria,
proteinuria, i BP, and CKD. ESRD in <10%, usually in middle age.
Other features Absent or hypoplastic patellae (770%), often leading
to secondary osteoarthritis. Hypoplasia of the radial head and distal
humerus leads to a limited range of forearm movement. 80% develop
iliac horns (symmetrical osseous processes arising from the iliac wings),
which are asymptomatic but visible on X-ray. Bilateral, symmetrical nail
abnormalities are present (from birth) in the majority, affecting both
ﬁngers and toes, but commonly the thumb and index ﬁnger. Nails may
be absent, dysplastic, misshapen, ridged, or discoloured.
Histology Light microscopy can resemble FSGS. Immunostaining may
show IgM and C3 in sclerotic areas. EM is diagnostic, demonstrating
irregular basement membrane thickening with areas of rarefaction, giving rise to a ‘moth-eaten’ appearance. Foot process effacement will also
be present.
Management As for all progressive proteinuric nephropathies. No speciﬁc treatment is available. Offer genetic counselling.

Diseases of the kidney

Miscellaneous mesangioproliferative
glomerulonephritides
Introduction
These uncommon lesions, sometimes referred to collectively as ‘mesangial proliferative GN’ remain partially characterized. They are increasingly
viewed as part of the spectrum of minimal change or FSGS and usually
present with proteinuria (often nephrotic range), microscopic haematuria
±i SCr. They are all characterized, in part, by focal or diffuse mesangial
proliferation, which might be a relatively non-speciﬁc glomerular response
to injury, although consensus on the speciﬁc histological criteria required
for diagnosis are lacking. They are often a diagnosis of exclusion.
They tend to be poorly steroid-responsive and associated with a poor
renal prognosis. Cytotoxic therapy has been tried, with variable degrees
of success.

C1q nephropathy
A mesangial proliferative GN, originally recognized for its close histological resemblance to lupus nephritis, in the absence of any serological or
clinical criteria for the diagnosis of SLE. Histology shows a characteristic
heavy deposition of C1q-containing deposits in the mesangium and elsewhere, with varying degrees of mesangial hypercellularity and ‘wire loop’
capillary wall thickening. There are two dominant clinical and pathological phenotypes: (i) a minimal change or FSGS-like lesion, which typically
presents as steroid-unresponsive nephrotic syndrome; (ii) an immune
complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, associated with several different
types of glomerular lesion, typically presenting as CKD. C1q nephropathy
is now generally considered as an FSGS variant.

IgM nephropathy
Is a similar lesion, again characterized by mesangial hypercellularity on light
microscopy, with diffuse granular mesangial IgM and C3 deposition on
immunostaining. IgM may also be non-speciﬁcally deposited in areas of
sclerosis in many glomerular diseases, but here it is seen in the mesangium
of non-sclerotic glomeruli. EM reveals generalized foot process effacement. It is still debated whether it represents a distinct disease entity or
a variant of minimal change disease or FSGS. The most important clinical
distinction is that it is poorly steroid-responsive and 6 associated with a
poorer prognosis. Presents with proteinuria, often heavy, 9 microscopic
haematuria.

Idiopathic mesangial proliferative GN
Essentially, a diagnosis of exclusion. There is mesangial proliferation on
biopsy but no immune complex deposition on immunostaining.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Thrombotic microangiopathies
Introduction
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a histologic description encompassing several rare, but related, disorders, characterized clinically by a
triad of haemolysis, consumptive thrombocytopenia, and tissue ischaemia
(caused by platelet aggregation and thrombotic occlusion of small vessels)
(see Table 7.3).
The two classical clinical presentations involving TMA are thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (b p. 576) and the haemolytic uraemic
syndrome (HUS) (b p. 578) (see Table 7.3).
These conditions affect both adults and children and carry a very poor
prognosis if left undiagnosed and untreated.
2 Suspect in the context of otherwise unexplained thrombocytopenia and
microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA).

HUS vs TTP?
These two conditions are increasingly considered as different presentations of the same underlying pathophysiological process (with the
exception of diarrhoea associated (D+) HUS, particularly in childhood
(see b p. 578).
• TTP—predominantly neurological 9 AKI (minimal).
• HUS—AKI generally dominates the clinical picture. Neurological
involvement minimal/absent.
In view of this, they are now often referred to as ‘TTP-HUS’, with less
weight being given to differentiating between the two.

Clinical assessment
• Take a careful history for a diarrhoeal illness. Examine for petechiae,
purpura, signs of systemic sclerosis, splenomegaly. Check BP and fundi.
• Urinalysis for haematuria, proteinuria, and bilirubinuria (haemolysis).
• FBC (d Hb, dd Plt), ﬁlm for red cell fragments (MAHA), clotting,
D-dimers/FDP, G&S, d haptoglobins, Coombs’ test (negative).
• ii LDH, i B-HCG., U&E, LFT (i bilirubin), urate.
• Blood and stool cultures.
• ANA, dsDNA, complement, antiphospholipid antibodies (b p. 40).
• ADAMTS13 activity (see p. 576).
• Consider renal biopsy only once (and if) platelet count normalizes.

Histology
All TMAs share similar renal histology. Fibrin thrombi are present in the
glomerular capillaries, with resultant ischaemia. Fluorescence for Ig and
complement negative. EM shows capillary thrombi, ﬁbrin deposition, and
endothelial injury and swelling.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP)
Pathogenesis
von Willebrand factor is released from endothelial cells as a large polymer
and cleaved to form the mature polypeptide that acts as a matrix for haemostasis. The protease responsible for this cleavage is the zinc metalloproteinase ADAMTS13. If vWF-cleaving protein activity is impaired (either an
IgG autoantibody directed against the protease or an inherited mutation
of the gene encoding ADAMTS13), then abnormally large vWF multimers
enter the circulation where they bind and activate platelets. This leads to
spontaneous platelet aggregation, platelet-rich (though ﬁbrin-poor) thrombus formation and a systemic microangiopathy, with widespread deposition
of platelet-vWF complexes (e.g. brain/kidney/mesenteric vessels).
Interestingly, ADAMTS13 knockout mice do not develop a TMA, suggesting a ‘second hit’ (e.g. an inﬂammatory or a prothrombotic stimulus) is
required to initiate the disease.

Causes
• Hereditary: rare, congenital mutations of the ADAMTS13 gene (e.g.
Upshaw–Schulman syndrome)
• Autoimmune: 40–70% of all TTP. Autoimmune inhibition of
ADAMTS13. IgG autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 have also been
demonstrated in drug-related TTP (e.g. ticlopidine, clopidogrel).

Clinical features
Classic pentad:
• Fever.
• Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia.
• Thrombocytopenic purpura.
• CNS involvement (confusion, ﬁts, or other neurological abnormality).
• Renal involvement (AKI).
i BP is more common with HUS than TTP.
 Note: patients with profound ADAMTS13 deﬁciency can present with
bloody diarrhoea (non-infectious), presumably secondary to gut ischaemia.

Investigations (see also b p. 574)
For disease monitoring: dd Plt, blood ﬁlm for red cell fragments, ii LDH, d
haptoglobins. Low ADAMTS13 activity (<5% normal) in the correct clinical context is diagnostic (however, the result of this specialist investigation
may not be available to inform management decisions).

Management
Treatment aims to restore the ability to cleave vWF.

THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA (TTP)

Plasma exchange (PEX) Allows large-volume plasma infusion as well as
removal of vWF-cleaving protein inhibitor, esp. if AKI with oligo-anuria
(where plasma infusion without exchange may cause volume overload).
• Initiate ASAP, and continue daily until 2 days after remission (Plt count
and LDH normalize). Usually 7–16 days.
• Exchange one plasma volume/day (b p. 950).
• May require hydrocortisone 100 mg + chlorphenamine 10 mg IVI to
prevent allergic reactions to large volumes of plasma.
Fresh frozen plasma (ideally platelet-poor) or cryosupernatant infusion. As
25–30mL/kg/day until improvement. 2 But only if passing urine: beware
volume overload. This is inferior to PEX but is efﬁcacious if PEX is not
available.
Rituximab may have a role in more severe disease (particularly with severe
neurologic involvement), non-responders to PEX, and if disease worsens
despite treatment. Rituximab 375mg/m2 weekly x 4 (given in addition to
steroids and PEX) appears to be safe and effective and reduce relapses.
Other avoid platelet transfusion unless life-threatening bleeding (‘fuels the
ﬁre’). No role for aspirin or anticoagulants. For severe disease, consider
add-on prednisolone 1mg/kg/day or IV immunoglobulin, in addition to
rituximab.

Prognosis
Mortality remains 710–20%. Prompt recognition and treatment will reduce
this. A third will relapse. Renal survival is good, with dialysis-requiring AKI
unusual in TTP (more common in HUS).

577

578

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS)
Introduction
HUS is a renal-limited TMA, with widespread complications. There are
three forms: (i) typical, (ii) atypical, and (iii) autoimmune. All present with
AKI, thrombocytopenia, and MAHA.
Typical (80–90%)
Associated with diarrhoea (D+).
Peak incidence in summer. Usually affects children <5 years. Occurs after
food poisoning (esp. undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk). Pathogenic
bacteria produce a Shiga-like exotoxin that is able to translocate, perhaps
via neutrophils, across inﬂamed colonic mucosa into blood. It then binds
glomerular epithelial cells with high afﬁnity causing the release of prothrombotic factors and ultra-large vWF multimers.
Atypical (10–15%)
Not associated with diarrhoea (D–).
Factor H deﬁciency (a complement regulatory protein) causes relapsing
or familial HUS. Deﬁciencies in other factors, e.g. C3, B, I, and CD46
(membrane cofactor protein), cause a similar syndrome.
Drugs and non-diarrhoeal infections can cause an HUS-like syndrome.
These are generally associated with no (or only minor) reduction in
ADAMTS13, suggesting a different pathophysiology to TTP.
Autoimmune—DEAP-HUS (deﬁciency of complement factor H-related
(CFHR) plasma proteins and autoantibody-positive HUS) is a novel
subtype, affecting children. It is due to a combination of acquired and
genetic factors and has a favourable response to treatment.
Several hypotheses have been proposed for the pathophysiological basis
of HUS-TTP in context of a normal ADAMTS13. These include endothelial injury (l loss of, or deﬁcient, VEGF leads to TMA) and increased
plasminogen activator inhibitor.

Infections associated with D+ HUS
• E. coli O157:H7 subtype (70% of D+ HUS in developed countries).
• Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1.
• Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Yersinia.

Associations of D– HUS
• Inherited HUS.
• Drugs: quinine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, ciproﬂoxacin, the
contraceptive pill, heparin, chemotherapy.
• Infections, e.g. S. pneumoniae or rickettsial.

HAEMOLYTIC URAEMIC SYNDROME (HUS)

Clinical features
• Triad of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and
renal injury.
• Watery or bloody diarrhoea.
• Fever, i BP, AKI, and volume overload.
• May progress to multiorgan failure, with pancreatitis and a
cardiomyopathy.

Investigations (see b p. 576)
• i WCC common.
• Fresh stool for culture.
• Disease monitoring: dd Plt, red cell fragments on ﬁlm, ii LDH.

Management
• 2 If in doubt, treat as TTP until diagnosis conﬁrmed.
• For D+ HUS, management is supportive alone (including RRT if
required).
• No role for anticoagulation. Antibiotics may paradoxically increase
Shiga toxin release and should be avoided.
• PEX or plasma infusion do not improve outcome (as, unlike TTP, there
is no underlying replaceable causative factor).
• Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks complement activity
by cleavage of C5 (b p. 391). There is great interest in its use in
atypical HUS and for the prevention of relapse post-transplantation
(b p. 420).

Prognosis
Poor prognostic factors: i age, high WCC, D– HUS, S. pneumoniae or
Shigella infection, complete anuria.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis
Introduction
Acute (tubulo-)interstitial nephritis (AIN) is a common parenchymal cause
of AKI. Peak incidence in middle age but can affect all ages. ♂ = ♀. 70–
90% of cases are drug-induced, although the spectrum of causative agents
has changed.
AIN is characterized by an inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrate in the renal interstitium. This is occasionally associated with a systemic delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (fever, arthritis, rash). Recurrent disease is common on
repeat drug exposure.

Common causes of AIN
• Drugs:
• NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors).
• Penicillins (classically meticillin), cephalosporins, rifampicin, and
sulfonamides. Consider any antibiotic as a potential cause.
• Proton pump inhibitors.
• Diuretics.
• Allopurinol.
• Antiretrovirals.
• Infections:
• Tuberculosis, legionellosis, and leptospirosis.
• Autoimmune disease:
• Sarcoidosis.
• Sjögren’s syndrome.
• TINU (see b p. 581).

Symptoms and signs
Often asymptomatic until AKI supervenes. The classical presentation of
fever, arthralgia, rash, and AKI is rare (710%). Flank pain (renal swelling l
capsular stretch) is uncommon.
Causative drugs may have been started 3–21 days previously, although
delayed AIN, occurring up to 18 months after starting a drug, has been
described.
There may be clinical evidence of an associated systemic condition, such
as Sjögren’s syndrome or sarcoidosis.

Investigations
• Urine dipstick may be bland or have modest proteinuria (uPCR usually
<100mmol/mg or <1g/day). Microscopic haematuria is rare, and its
presence may point toward a glomerular lesion. Urine microscopy may
reveal eosinophiluria and white cell casts. EMU for AFB in high-risk
patients.
• U&E, bone proﬁle (?i Ca2+—esp. in sarcoidosis), LFT, FBC +
differentials (eosinophilia may be present), i ESR. Consider ANA,
anti-Ro, and anti-La (? Sjögren’s syndrome).
• USS shows normal-sized (or slightly enlarged) kidneys.
• CXR and serum ACE (? sarcoid).
• Renal biopsy: usually necessary to conﬁrm diagnosis.

ACUTE TUBULOINTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS

Histology
Intense interstitial inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrate, consisting of lymphocytes
and monocytes (9 eosinophils). Giant cells and granulomata may point
to TB or sarcoidosis. The presence of interstitial ﬁbrosis imparts a worse
prognosis, as in all forms of renal injury. Glomeruli are normal.

Management
•
•
•
•

Depends, to an extent, on the underlying cause or precipitant.
Treatment of sarcoidosis (b p. 670) are outlined elsewhere.
3 Stop offending drug(s).
X Corticosteroids:
• Widely used, although there is no good evidence to support this
practice. May hasten recovery but do not appear to inﬂuence
overall prognosis.
• A reasonable approach:
• Dialysis-dependent: treat with corticosteroids.
• Dialysis-independent: observe for up to 14 days following drug
withdrawal; if improvement, continue expectant management; if no
improvement, treat with corticosteroids.
• Information from a renal biopsy may also inform decisionmaking; e.g. acute inﬂammation with interstitial oedema
may favour steroid treatment, whilst established ﬁbrosis would not.
• Treatment with prednisolone 1mg/kg/day PO, tapering slowly against
response for a 3–6 month course (b p. 540).
• For drug-related AIN:
• Outcomes: 40% will be left with CKD, and 10% will progress to
ESRD. Final GFR does not correlate with the maximal value during
the early acute phase. Of those with milder disease, the majority
will return to baseline renal function. Even those requiring renal
replacement therapy for AKI usually regain independent renal
function. Mortality rate <5%.

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis
syndrome (TINU)
Uncommon. Unlike AIN, affects predominantly younger ♀. Presents
as anterior uveitis (often bilateral) and AIN (which may be separated
in time). Additional features include weight loss, d Hb, i ESR, and
deranged LFT. Pathophysiology is poorly understood, although IgG
antibodies against modiﬁed C-reactive protein, (mCRP) may be relevant. Differential diagnosis: autoimmune disease (esp. Sjögren’s) and
sarcoidosis.
Ophthalmology input should be sought urgently. Treat the renal
lesion with 1mg/kg/day prednisolone, tapering slowly against resolution
for 3–6 months. Relapse is common, and complete steroid withdrawal
may not be possible.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Chronic tubulointerstitial disease
Introduction
Chronic tubulointerstitial disease encompasses a variety of disorders that
share similar histological appearances on kidney biopsy. The tubulointerstitial compartment is extensively ﬁbrosed, often with a lymphocytic inﬁltrate in scarred areas. Tubules are often dilated and atrophic. Glomeruli
are largely spared (although glomerular obsolescence may be seen as a
result of nephron dropout).
Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis exists as a distinct diagnosis
(drug-induced AIN of any cause may progress if exposure is not limited
or the underlying condition is not treated) but chronic tubulointerstitial
injury is a feature of progressive CKD of any cause, including glomerulonephritis (b p. 200).

Causes
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Drugs (NSAIDs).
Reﬂux nephropathy (b p. 712).
Sarcoidosis.
TB.
Autoimmune diseases (Sjögren’s syndrome).
Metabolic causes, e.g. chronic d K+ (e.g. in anorexia nervosa).
Heavy metals (see b p. 583).
Balkan endemic and Chinese herbal nephropathies.

Clinical features
•
•
•
•
•
•

Impaired urinary concentration (nocturia, polyuria).
Often normal BP (due to relative salt-losing state).
LMW tubular proteinuria (e.g. B2 microglobulin).
Glycosuria (impaired tubular handling) 9 renal tubular acidosis.
CKD.
Small, symmetrical kidneys on USS (exception: reﬂux nephropathy
where asymmetry is common).

Investigations
MSU for M,C+S, EMU for AFB, uPCR or uACR (proteinuria often <1g/day),
U&E, bone proﬁle (? i Ca2+), serum ACE, ANA, anti-Ro/La, USS kidneys.

Lithium-induced nephropathy
(See b p. 904.)

Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN)
Affects men and women >30 years old inhabiting lands drained by the
Danube River. Characterized by tubulointerstitial atrophy and scarring.
Cause remains unknown. Patients are usually normotensive, with a urinary
concentrating defect (polyuria), and may have LMW tubular proteinuria
(<1g/day) and glycosuria. USS shows small, symmetrical kidneys. There is
an increased incidence of transitional cell carcinoma of the entire urinary
tract; new haematuria should be fully investigated, and urine cytology is
recommended at least annually.

CHRONIC TUBULOINTERSTITIAL DISEASE

Chinese herb nephropathy (b p. 901)
A histological disorder similar to BEN, with tubulointerstitial scarring and
glomerular sparing as the principal features. Appears to be due to aristolochic acid, an ingredient in many Chinese herbal preparations (notably
as a slimming agent). Clinical presentation and histology are so similar to
BEN that a similar aetiology has been suggested, although this remains to
be proven. The incidence of urothelial malignancies is very high, and surveillance is mandatory. In those considered for transplantation after ESRD,
bilateral native nephrouretectomy is often recommended to reduce the
risk of malignant disease following immunosuppression.

Lead nephropathy
Exposure to lead, including occupational, may cause chronic poisoning,
with progressive tubulointerstitial nephritis. Tubular injury results in
decreased urate excretion with hyperuricaemia and gout. At-risk individuals with unexplained CKD, associated with high serum urate concentrations, should be assessed for total lead burden by either bone
X-ray ﬂuorescence or an EDTA lead chelation test. Treatment includes
long-term lead depletion with EDTA or DMSA.
Lead has also been shown to be a risk factor for progression of CKD of
other causes. Cadmium exposure causes a similar nephropathy.

Salt-losing nephropathy
• Refers to inappropriate renal losses of sodium (and thus) water.
• It generally occurs in the context of chronic tubulointerstitial
disorders.
• Losses rarely exceed 100mmol Na+ (2–3L/day), as increased delivery
of Na+ to the macula densa causes protective afferent arteriolar
vasoconstriction with d GFR (so-called ‘tubulo-glomerular feedback’).
• However, hypovolaemia and hyponatraemia can be clinically
signiﬁcant, if untreated.
• Management: appropriate ﬂuid and salt intake. Dietary input may
sufﬁce for the latter. If not, salt supplementation.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Analgesic nephropathy
Introduction
Analgesic nephropathy (AN) was ﬁrst described after chronic phenacetin
use (a pro-drug of paracetamol). Fortunately, it has declined in prevalence
over the last 3 decades from 73% to 70.2%.
The use of combination analgesic preparations now accounts for most
cases (e.g. paracetamol + codeine, or paracetamol + aspirin). Aspirin
alone will not usually cause AN, although paracetamol, if used in sufﬁcient
quantities, might (>2kg cumulatively; equivalent to about 8 years of daily
full-dose ingestion).
Renal injury begins with ischaemic changes in the medulla, progressing to tubulointerstitial scarring, glomerulosclerosis, and papillary necrosis
(b p. 585). (See Fig. 7.9)
Analgesic nephropathy is also associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, although the mechanism is unclear.

Symptoms and signs
A history of analgesic use may be difﬁcult to elicit: suspect if chronic
pain syndromes, such as headaches or backache. Dyspepsia is common.
Nocturia and polyuria (loss of concentrating ability), episodic colicky ﬂank
pain, and frank haematuria due to papillary necrosis (sloughed papillae)
may occasionally be evident in the urine. i BP, as CKD develops.

Investigations
Urine dipstick often bland or modest proteinuria only. Sterile pyuria on
urine microscopy. d Hb, i SCr, and d eGFR. Classical IVU appearances
historically (small kidneys with clubbed calyces), but CT is now preferred.

ANALGESIC NEPHROPATHY

Management
Stop all analgesics. This is often extremely difﬁcult, but reducing the analgesic burden slows disease progression (those who continue have a 6-fold
risk of reaching dialysis or death in an observational study of 78 patients).1
The input of a specialist pain management team is highly desirable.
2 Surveillance for urothelial malignancies (transitional cell carcinoma
occurs in up to 10% of conﬁrmed cases of analgesic nephropathy). May
be multiple, in unusual sites, or even bilateral. New haematuria merits full
urological investigation. Annual urine cytology is a useful screening tool.

Papillary necrosis
The end result of chronic medullary hypoxia: vulnerable papillae suffer
a further (acute) ischaemic injury, undergo necrosis, and are shed into
the renal pelvis.
Clinical presentation
• May be asymptomatic.
• Colicky ﬂank pain (as the papilla traverses the ureter).
• Visible passage of a papilla (or part thereof).
• Frank haematuria.
• Unilateral ureteric obstruction.
CT may show calciﬁed papillae and an irregular renal contour.
Historically, IVU showed contrast tracking into eroded papillae and ring
shadows around detached papillae 9 calciﬁcation.
Causes of papillary necrosis
• Analgesic nephropathy.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Post-obstructive uropathy.
• Sickle cell nephropathy.
• Tuberculosis.
• Severe acute pyelonephritis.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Renovascular disease
Introduction
Renovascular disease (RVD) refers to diseases of the large, medium-sized,
and small renal vessels (excluding vasculitis). Atherosclerotic renal artery
stenosis (ARAS) and ﬁbromuscular dysplasia (FMD) predominantly affect
the larger vessels. The umbrella term ‘ischaemic nephropathy’ is used to
describe vasculopathy involving small intrarenal vessels.

ARAS and ischaemic nephropathy
Increasing incidence with i age (9 7% in people aged >65) and in those
known to have atherosclerotic disease elsewhere (9 50% if known PVD).
However, anatomic ARAS may be haemodynamically unimportant and is
associated with i BP in only 50% of cases. Generally, any stenosis >70%
tends to be functionally signiﬁcant, as is bilateral ARAS or disease in an
artery to a single functioning kidney. Patients with ARAS or ischaemic
nephropathy have a substantial excess risk for CV death (MI and stroke).
ARAS should be suspected in older patients with clinically evident
peripheral, coronary, or cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease, or those
with known risk factors (dyslipidaemia, smoking, diabetes, i BP).
Clinical presentation
• i BP—often resistant to treatment (i.e. >140/90mmHg on three
drugs).
• Renal dysfunction.
• i SCr or d eGFR of up to 20% with ACE-I or ARB.
• Fluid retention, often diuretic-resistant.
Pathophysiology
Atherosclerotic plaque involves the ostium or proximal 2cm of the renal
artery, often extending from the aorta. Renal disease is caused by a fall
in perfusion, resulting in sympathetic overactivity and renin release. This
leads to overproduction of A2 (l vasoconstriction) and aldosterone
release (l salt and water retention).
The pro-ﬁbrotic actions of these factors, in combination with hypoxia,
drive a complex cellular activity termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). An essential process developmentally; EMT involves loss of
epithelial cell apico–basal polarity and cell–cell adhesion characteristics.
Cells become motile and acquire a ﬁbroblast phenotype. EMT underpins
progressive renal ﬁbrosis and scarring, with loss of functioning tubules (l
CKD clinically).
Symptoms and signs
• Evidence of central or peripheral vascular disease is perhaps the most
important clinical ﬁnding.
• i BP, peripheral oedema, pulmonary congestion, abdominal bruits
(low predictive value in isolation), palpable AAA.
• Generally, bland urine on dipstick or low-grade proteinuria only
(e.g.<1g/day). This can be a helpful clinical clue, although the
development of s FSGS may lead to higher levels.

RENOVASCULAR DISEASE

• Flash pulmonary oedema refers to sudden, often episodic, pulmonary
oedema, with i BP and without any precipitating cardiac event
(or in the context of relatively normal LV function). It is caused by
exaggerated activity of the RAAS (l acute salt and water retention
and volume overload). Probably overdiagnosed: thorough cardiac
assessment is mandatory.
• Loin pain, a sudden decline in renal function, and new haematuria may
indicate renal infarction.
Investigations
(See Fig. 7.10)
• SCr, eGFR, U&E (? d K+ due to i aldosterone), lipids. Plasma renin will
be high, but this is therapeutically unhelpful.
• Urine dipstick, uPCR or uACR.
• Evidence of vascular disease elsewhere, e.g. ECG.
• Potential imaging includes:
• USS kidneys for renal size and symmetry. A difference of >1.5cm in
renal length is suspicious.
• CT angiography is increasingly sensitive for ostial lesions.
• MRA. However, gadolinium-enhanced MRA is relatively
contraindicated in individuals with a GFR <30mL/min (b p. 51).
MR also tends to overestimate the extent of a stenosis. Newer MRI
software is enabling non-gadolinium MRA scanning.
• Duplex USS with Doppler examination. Resistive index (RI) is a
surrogate for impeded ﬂow. Only useful in experienced hands.
• Captopril isotope scintigraphy. With captopril, affected kidneys may
show a 30% decline in GFR using DTPA or MAG-3 (b p. 54).
• Formal angiography. Remains the gold standard for diagnosis and
allows endovascular intervention.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Management of ARAS
General management
ARVD is associated with a 16% PA mortality risk, predominantly attributable to associated CVD. Modiﬁcation of CVD risk factors is 6 a primary
objective: stop smoking, exercise, healthy diet, statins. Consider aspirin
75mg od.
Control BP
Aim for <130/85mmHg, using non-ACE-I/ARB drugs, for example:
• Calcium channel blocker or B-blocker.
• Early use of loop diuretics titrated vs response (e.g. furosemide
40–160mg daily) can be effective, as i BP is driven by salt and water
overload.

Further management
The primary goal is to prevent loss of renal function. Two treatment
options exist, conservative or interventional. Selection can be difﬁcult.
Interventional management
• Includes percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) 9
stenting and surgical revascularization.
• PTRA alone is associated with a high incidence of restenosis—stenting
is 6 widely advocated.
• However, the ASTRAL trial (b p. 589) has suggested only a limited
role for interventional management.
• The selection of candidates who may beneﬁt from intervention is
difﬁcult and without a robust evidence base. However, many clinicians
would consider such a strategy in the following situations:
• Bilateral critical ARAS or critical ARAS to a single functioning
kidney.
• ARAS that is known to be of recent onset.
• Refractory i BP and volume overload.
• Flash pulmonary oedema (b p. 587).
• Rapidly deteriorating renal function.
• Other factors to consider if an interventional approach is considered:
• The stenosis should be high grade (>70%).
• The kidney(s) should be >7.5cm in length, implying meaningful
nephron mass and 6 potentially salvageable renal function.
• The absence of scars on 99mTc-DMSA isotope scintigraphy may
usefully predict recoverable renal function.
• The presence of heavy proteinuria may imply hyperﬁltration injury
and s FSGS in a scarred kidney (b p. 562).
The risk of cholesterol emboli, arterial dissection (with potential limb
injury), and contrast-induced AKI (b p. 148) should be weighed against
potential beneﬁts.
Surgical revascularization is usually reserved for those undergoing simultaneous aortic surgery.

MANAGEMENT OF ARAS

Conservative management
• Given the pathophysiological importance of A2, a trial of ACE-I/ARB
is often warranted under close supervision. ACE-I/ARB will reduce
CV risk and may retard progression of CKD. They will also block
A2-mediated vasoconstriction and ﬁbrosis. 2 However, they will also
drop renal perfusion pressure and may precipitate AKI.
•  Patients must be adequately hydrated (check for postural drop).
• Start with low dose, and measure SCr regularly, e.g. alternate days.
• Increase dose, according to BP, if no deterioration in renal function
(i SCr or d eGFR >20% from baseline).

Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery
Lesions (ASTRAL) trial
ASTRAL is the largest trial, to date, of PTRA + stenting + medical
therapy vs medical therapy alone; 806 patients were randomized in an
unblinded fashion.
Primary endpoint Slope of the reciprocal creatinine plot.
Secondary endpoints Time to renal and major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACE), BP, and mortality.
Results A borderline signiﬁcant difference (p = 0.06) in the slope of the
reciprocal creatinine plot between the two groups. However, this translated into a clinically meaningless 1.6μmol/L (0.02mg/dL) difference in
SCr between the intervention and medical therapy groups. No signiﬁcant improvements in BP or reductions in renal adverse events, MACE,
or mortality were seen.
Conclusion Revascularization offered no beneﬁt over medical therapy in
the management of ARAS but was associated with an increased risk of
morbidity (two procedural related deaths and three limb amputations).
Caveat There is a consensus view (non-evidence-based) that individuals with ﬂash pulmonary oedema, high-grade bilateral stenosis (or a
high-grade stenosis affecting a single functioning kidney), or those presenting with AKI should be offered intervention. Such scenarios were
probably underrepresented in the ASTRAL cohort.

Other renovascular diseases
Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD)
Affects asymptomatic young women (15–50 years), often with i BP.
Renal function is generally normal. Much less common than ARAS. True
prevalence in both normotensive and hypertensive populations unknown.
Characterized by arterial ﬁbroplasia that may affect many vascular
beds (intracranial, carotid, coronary, and limb). Pathogenesis unknown.
A genetic predisposition operates in some (with autosomal dominant
inheritance). Often involves both renal arteries, classically affecting the
mid-distal renal portion of the vessel (rather than the ostium in ARAS).
Angiography shows a ‘string of beads’ appearance with normal-calibre
vessels on either side (see Fig. 7.11). i BP of FMD may be cured (withdrawal of all drugs) or improved by angioplasty, particularly in woman
<50 years with i BP of <8 years’ duration and with few stenoses in other
arterial beds.

Renal vein thrombosis (RVT)
RVT is usually found in association with the nephrotic syndrome (particularly membranous nephropathy, b p. 564) when it may be uni- or bilateral. It is very rare without some form of concomitant hypercoagulable
state. It may be seen in association with tumours, esp. renal cell carcinoma,
where there is invasion and distortion of the renal vein.
May present as: pulmonary emboli, renal infarction (loin pain, haematuria, i SCr, i AST, and i LDH).
Contrast-enhanced CT angiography/venography or Doppler USS
(operator-dependent) of the renal veins should be diagnostic. Proven RVT
should be treated with anticoagulation.

Cholesterol emboli
May cause partial occlusion of the small renal vessels, with downstream
ischaemia. Showers of emboli may present suddenly as AKI or, more commonly, as a gradual decline in renal function. Characteristically occurs in
elderly patients known to have extensive atherosclerosis who undergo
endovascular intervention (particularly aortic). It is an important differential diagnosis of contrast-induced AKI (b p. 148). Anticoagulation (and
thrombolysis) are also risk factors.
Patients may also develop embolic infarcts in other end-arterial territories, including digits, retina, GI tract, and skin (l livedo reticularis).
The urine is usually bland (although proteinuria may occur over time).
Eosinophilia, eosinophiluria, and d C3/C4 may be present. Renal biopsy
shows characteristic intravascular clefts where cholesterol emboli were
present before tissue preparation. No speciﬁc therapy is helpful, although
aggressive CV risk factor management, including BP and cholesterol, may
improve patient survival. Renal prognosis is often poor.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney disease (ADPKD)
Introduction
ADPKD is the most common inherited kidney disease, affecting 7 1:800
live births. It is responsible for 5–10% patients in an ESRD programme.

Inheritance
ADPKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Mutations in the
genes PKD-1 (located on chromosome 16) and PKD-2 (chromosome
4) result in defective synthesis of the proteins polycystin-1 and -2, respectively. Both polycystin-1 and -2 are ubiquitously expressed by epithelial
cells throughout the body. PKD-1 mutations are seven times more common than PKD-2 and associated with more aggressive disease (onset of
ESRD, on average, 15 years earlier).

Pathophysiology
Polycystin-1 is a membrane receptor signalling protein that co-localizes
with polycystin-2 (a calcium-permeable channel) within the cilia of renal
collecting duct epithelial cells. This polycystin complex acts as an extracellular mechanosensor (luminal ﬂow disturbs the cilia and triggers the
apparatus) that assists in the regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, differentiation, and maturation (l all ultimately maintain tubular integrity
and calibre). Failure of normal polycystin complex formation results in
dysregulated cell turnover and uncontrolled cell proliferation in response
to growth factors. Proliferating tubular cells form tubular cysts that close
off the associated nephron and expand in size over time.
It is estimated that <1% of nephrons undergo such cystic transformation. However, local tissue ischaemia and pro-ﬁbrotic cytokine release
drive a process of EMT (b p. 586), resulting in scarring and ultimately
progressive CKD.

Clinical presentation
Patients may present with a family history of ADPKD. A careful history
for renal disease, i BP, stroke (intracranial haemorrhage), or premature
death may pinpoint carriers of the gene mutation. Inheritance is autosomal
dominant, so 50% of offspring should be affected.
2 Importantly, 25–40% of new patients will have no family history.
Patients being investigated for ADPKD should be given information
about the disorder before and after testing.
Clinical features include:
• Flank or loin pain arising from large cysts. Acute pain may suggest cyst
rupture or bleeding.
• Dipstick-positive haematuria 9 episodic frank haematuria.
• i BP.
• Nocturia and polyuria (loss of urinary concentrating ability).
• Low-grade proteinuria may be present (usually <1g/day).
• If presenting late, uraemic symptoms (b p. 212).

AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE (ADPKD)

Investigations
USS remains the investigation of choice. As ADPKD is an evolving disease,
the timing of the scan is important. In otherwise asymptomatic at-risk individuals, USS should be performed after age 20 to improve negative predictive value. For conﬁrmation of diagnosis, the Ravine criteria are useful
(see Table 7.4).

2 Valid for PKD-1 mutation alone. PKD-2 mutations present later, so these criteria tend to give
false negative results.

Other radiological features
Increased renal size is common (often >20cm in length). Cysts in other
organs (liver, pancreas, spleen) may also be present and helpful to differentiate ADPKD from multiple simple cysts. (See Fig. 7.12)
Genetic testing
Is available through specialist centres but is not currently widely used. It
has accuracy rate >95% for ADPKD1 and ADPKD2. An important indication would be a young adult with a negative USS who is under consideration as a potential kidney donor.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

ADPKD: complications and treatment
Hypertension
i BP may be the ﬁrst presentation of ADPKD, affecting 760% of those with
normal renal function. It is thought to be s to increased renin generation in ischaemic renal tissue compressed by expanding cysts. Meticulous
BP control (aiming for target BP <130/80mmHg) is important to protect
an often young cohort of patients from progressive end-organ damage.
Although proteinuria is not a dominant feature of the disease, ACE-I/ARB
are still favoured as ﬁrst-line therapy, with escalation to other agents, as
necessary (b p. 204).

CKD
Although many patients with ADPKD will never reach ESRD, progressive
CKD is nonetheless common. Males diagnosed at a younger age, early i
BP, large kidneys, black race, and the PKD-1 mutation have a worse renal
prognosis.
At ESRD, ADPKD patients enjoy better survival following dialysis
and transplantation than the non-ADPKD ESRD population, reﬂecting a
younger age and lower burden of CV disease in this group.

Cyst haemorrhage
Presents with unilateral ﬂank pain of abrupt onset 9 haematuria (if the
cyst communicates with the urinary space) (see Table 7.5). Management
is conservative, with hydration and analgesia. Individuals with a history
of repeated cyst haemorrhage have an earlier onset of ESRD. Recurrent
haemorrhage may sometimes necessitate nephrectomy (either bilateral
or unilateral).

Cyst infection
Flank pain, fever, and systemic upset (see Table 7.5). Culture blood and
urine, and give a prolonged course of antimicrobials (according to sensitivities, but ciproﬂoxacin and co-trimoxazole have good cyst penetration).
CT, 99mTc-ciproﬂoxacin, and PET scanning may demonstrate infected cysts
if there is doubt regarding the source of infection. Recurrent cyst infection
may sometimes necessitate nephrectomy (either bilateral or unilateral).

Nephrolithiasis
20% of ADPKD patients have associated renal stones, usually uric acid
or calcium oxalate. Diagnosis is best made with CT scanning (b p. 716).

Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs)
4–10% of ADPKD patients have ICAs. Speciﬁc mutations appear to predispose to aneurysm formation, so certain family pedigrees may have a
positive history. Such families merit screening with MRA. Symptomatic
ICAs or those >10mm diameter need surgical intervention, but the optimal management of asymptomatic ICAs of <10mm is less certain. Rupture
presents as subarachnoid haemorrhage, most commonly in patients age
<50 years with poor BP control (50% mortality or severe disability).

Extrarenal cysts
Hepatic, splenic, pancreatic, mesenteric, and in the seminal vesicles. Occur
in 10–40% (most commonly multiparous women). Liver cysts rarely interfere with synthetic liver function but can cause biliary obstruction. Large
cysts may cause epigastric fullness and abdominal discomfort. Needle
puncture or surgical de-rooﬁng may be possible.

Other manifestations
Mitral valve prolapse and aortic regurgitation, diverticular disease, and
hernias are more common in patients with ADPKD.

Clinical trials and potential future treatments
• A better understanding of the pathogenesis of ADPKD has offered
hope for future therapies that might ameliorate cyst development.
• As cyst formation begins in utero, such interventions would require
ADPKD diagnosis and treatment from an earlier age.
• Experimental therapies have shown promise in both animal models
and human pilot studies. These include:
• Vasopressin receptor antagonists to d cyst formation (via
d cAMP).
• mTOR inhibition (or paclitaxel) to reduce cell proliferation.
• Antagonism of epidermal growth factor.
• Long acting somatostatin analogues.
• However, it can be difﬁcult to select appropriate outcome measures
in clinical trials that aim to assess such therapies—given the length
of time it takes to develop CKD and eventual ESRD (if at all), a very
long follow-up period is required.
• Two clinical trials involving mTOR inhibition have failed to show a
beneﬁcial effect on GFR (although one did demonstrate a reduction
in cyst growth with everolimus).
• The CRISP study demonstrated that a combination of kidney and
total cyst volume, as determined by MRI, is negatively associated
with GFR. Many trials now use such volumetric assessments as
outcome measures.
• It is hoped that risk stratiﬁcation for progressive CKD may identify a
subpopulation of patients who will beneﬁt the most from interventions to
retard cyst growth (and 6 be the ideal participants in future clinical trials).

595

596

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

• One such risk factor for progressive CKD is increased 24h urine
osmolality. Animal studies have suggested that ADH may have
a role in cyst growth, so V2 receptor blockade could be of
therapeutic beneﬁt. This is the subject of ongoing clinical trials; e.g.
the vasopressin V2 antagonist tolvaptan has been shown to slow
progression of ADPKD in a 3-year, multi-centre, blinded study
of 71500 patients, halving the rate of kidney volume expansion
and slowing GFR reduction by 30%. However, safety concerns
(particularly regarding liver toxicity) mean it is not yet approved for
this indication.
• A recent 3-year study suggested that the somatostatin analogue
called octreotide long-acting release (LAR), delivered as a monthly
IM injection,might reduce kidney and cyst volume and slow CKD
progression2. SE: common (including cholecystitis).

Diseases of the kidney

Other cystic kidney diseases
Simple cysts (see b p. 742)
Solitary or multiple renal cysts are common in the elderly: 50% of those
aged 50 years or more have one or more such cysts. So-called ‘simple’
cysts are usually asymptomatic and are found on imaging the urinary tract
for other reasons. Simple cysts have no further signiﬁcance—complex
(echoic) cysts need detailed evaluation by CT scanning to exclude malignancy (see b p. 742–3).

Acquired cystic disease
Acquired cysts refer to cysts arising in the context of advanced CKD and
widespread tubulointerstitial scarring. They can be multiple and bilateral
and may be confused with ADPKD. Unlike ADPKD, acquired cysts occur
in scarred and thus small kidneys, and are rarely >2–3cm in size (most
are ± 5mm).
Age at presentation, family history, presence of i BP, and site of the cysts
on imaging can help discriminate the various cystic renal diseases (see
Table 7.6).

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
(ARPKD)
Caused by a rare mutation of the PKHD1 gene (located on chromosome
6) encoding polyductin. It is a disease of infancy and childhood, presenting with polycystic kidneys, progressive CKD, congenital hepatic ﬁbrosis,
and portal hypertension. It is much less common than ADPKD (estimated
prevalence 1:20,000 live births).

Juvenile nephronophthisis
A recessively inherited condition (71 in 50,000), characterized by cystic
change and tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis, presenting in early childhood (age
>1 year) and leading to ESRD in adolescence. Mutations in at least ﬁve
NPHP loci have been described, most commonly NPHP1 (associated with
earlier onset). Imaging characteristically reveals echo-bright kidneys with
a few corticomedullary cysts. Clinical features: polydipsia and polyuria but
often presents as ESRD. Unlike medullary cystic kidney disease, extrarenal

OTHER CYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASES

manifestations, including oculomotor apraxia, hypoplasia of cerebellar
vermis (Joubert’s syndrome), developmental delay, bone abnormalities
(cone-shaped epiphyses), situs invertus, and hepatic and portal ﬁbrosis)
also occur. May also be associated with retinitis pigmentosa in the Senior–
Løken syndrome.

Medullary sponge kidney
A common, benign condition characterized by diffuse medullary cyst formation. It is a developmental, rather than a genetic, anomaly. Clinically,
there is no family history, and patients are usually identiﬁed either incidentally or when investigated for UTI or stones (see Table 7.7). Impaired
calcium handling in the collecting ducts predisposes to formation of
calcium-containing stones (often in cysts). Consider the diagnosis in young
patients presenting with calcium stones. Haematuria (microscopic or
gross) and recurrent UTIs may also complicate the disorder. Diagnosis
is made on imaging; traditionally IVU (typical ‘calyceal brush’), now CT.
Renal impairment is very rare, and management should be directed at
infection and prevention of stone formation.

Medullary cystic kidney disease
Autosomal dominant inheritance, presenting in early adulthood with progressive renal impairment. The affected genes MCKD-1 and –2 encode
key signalling proteins in the renal cilia. Small cysts (1–10mm) form at the
corticomedullary junction, with associated tubulointerstitial inﬂammation
and scarring (glomeruli are unaffected). Affected individuals have a positive
family history and present with nocturia, polydipsia, and polyuria (impaired
concentrating ability). Urine dipstick is usually bland and BP often normal
(there may be relative salt loss) (see Table 7.7). Investigation shows small
to normal-sized kidneys on USS. CT may demonstrate the cystic change.
Impaired urate excretion and hyperuricaemia (9 gout) may occur. Renal
function usually declines to ESRD by age 60. No speciﬁc therapy available.
Correction of salt and water depletion may be necessary.

CHAPTER 7

Diseases of the kidney

Tuberous sclerosis
A multisystem disease associated with the growth of hamartomatous
lesions in multiple organs. Caused by mutations in the TSC1 (9q34) and
TCS2 (16p13) tumour suppressor genes. TSC2 (more common) lies adjacent to PKD-1, suggesting a role for PKD-1 in the development of cystic
disease in some patients with tuberous sclerosis. Predominantly a neurological (presenting with epilepsy and developmental delay) and skin (e.g.
facial angioﬁbroma, shagreen patches, ungula ﬁbromata) disease, but there
are a number of characteristic renal features.
• Angiomyolipomata: these benign hamartomas are present in 780%
from early childhood. They can be a cause of signiﬁcant bleeding
(requiring embolization) and ocassionally obstruction.
• Cystic disease: 720% patients have simple cysts, while 75% have
polycystic disease that may be associated with progression to ESRD.
• Renal cell carcinoma: <1%. Suspect if angiomyolipoma changes
appearance during surveillance.
• Management:
• Monitor BP, SCr, and eGFR (particularly if polycystic disease).
• Renal USS annually 9 CT, as necessary. Angiomyolipomata have a
characteristically high fat content.
• Refer to a specialist unit.

Bardet–Biedl syndrome
AR inheritance (71 in 140,000) but genetically heterogeneous, with mutations in at least 12 BBS loci described. Presents in childhood with short
stature, weight gain, polydactyly, progressive visual loss, hypogonadism,
i BP, CKD, and genital abnormalities in ♀. Diabetes mellitus may occur
later. Renal abnormalities in >90%: fetal lobulation, calyceal cysts and clubbing, cystic dysplasia, and VUR. Progressive CKD in a minority. Lawrence

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Diabetic nephropathy
Introduction
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most signiﬁcant complications of
diabetes mellitus. It is the leading cause of CKD (and ESRD) in the western
world, and its incidence is rising in developing countries. This increase has
been driven by the increased incidence of T2DM, improved life expectancy for these patients and better access to ESRD care. DN, therefore,
consumes a very signiﬁcant amount of healthcare resource. The topics on
b pp. 604–619 are among the most important in this book.
2 There is very good evidence that the quality of diabetes care has a signiﬁcant impact on the natural history of DN, with early treatment delaying
or preventing onset.

Deﬁnitions
• The earliest evidence of diabetic renal disease is the appearance of
microalbuminuria, i.e. low, but abnormal, amounts of albuminuria
(≥30mg/day) (b p. 60).
• Patients with microalbuminuria are often said to have ‘incipient’
nephropathy.
• DN (‘overt’ nephropathy) describes a clinical syndrome
characterized by:
• Persistent albuminuria (>300mg/day) on at least two occasions,
3 months apart.
• i BP.
• Progressive d GFR.
2 As well as a hallmark of DN, incipient and overt nephropathy
are important markers of i CV morbidity and mortality in both
T1DM and T2DM. They warrant aggressive intervention to improve
all CV risk factors (e.g. LDL cholesterol, BP, smoking cessation,
exercise, etc.).

Epidemiology
• 720–30% of patients with diabetes mellitus develop DN.
• 715% of ESRD in the UK is s to DN and is much higher elsewhere
(740% in the US). >90% of these individuals will have T2DM.
• Incidence and natural history depend on ethnicity, e.g. Pima Indians
(b p. 8) have a 40% incidence of ESRD 10 years after developing
microalbuminuria.
• Patients who have no proteinuria after 25 years of diabetes have only a
very small risk of developing DN.

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY

T1DM
• Microalbuminuria will develop in 20–30% of patients after 15 years.
• i BP often appears at the same time as microalbuminuria.
• Without treatment, 780% will increase their urinary albumin excretion
at a rate of 710–20% per year, with overt nephropathy developing over
10–15 years.
• Overt DN rarely develops within 10 years of diagnosis of T1DM.
• Without treatment, overt DN will lead to a progressive fall in GFR
over time. The rate is highly variable between individuals (2–20mL/min/
year).
• 50% of those with overt DN will develop ESRD within 10 years (>75%
within 20 years).
• Patients who progress from no microalbuminuria to microalbuminuria
or from microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria are likely to have
higher HbA1C and BP values.
• The overall long-term prevalence of ESRD in T1DM has recently fallen
to <10%, having previously been higher.
T2DM
• 73% of patients will have overt DN at the time of diagnosis of T2DM
(diabetes may have been present for some time prior to discovery).
• Proteinuria is less speciﬁc for DN in T2DM.
• Without treatment, 20–40% of those with microalbuminuria will
progress to overt DN.
• In the UKPDS study, annual risk for progression from no
microalbuminuria l microalbuminuria was 2.0%; from
microalbuminuria l macroalbuminuria 2.8%, and from
macroalbuminuria li SCr or ESRD 2.3%.
• The rate of decline of GFR is variable but less predictable than for
T1DM (T2DM = older patients with associated CV disease).
• After 20 years of overt DN, 720% will have progressed to ESRD.
These numbers are hugely signiﬁcant because of the higher prevalence
of T2DM.
• 2 The greater risk of death from associated CV disease in T2DM
prevents many with earlier nephropathy from progressing to ESRD.

• 3 Mortality risk increases at each stage.
• In the UKPDS, annual mortality risks were 1.4% (no
microalbuminuria); 3.0%, (microalbuminuria); 4.6%
(macroalbuminuria); and 19.2%, (CKD and ESRD). Risk of death
was higher than the risk for progression to the next phase once
microalbuminuria present.
• Happily, more recent studies, e.g. IDNT and RENAAL, have
challenged these data in an era of better diabetes care,
demonstrating what improved care may achieve.
• Nonetheless, CV mortality in T2DM remains a signiﬁcant public
health issue. See Box 8.1.
• Intensive monitoring and treatment inﬂuence natural history,
preventing incipient, and progression to overt, nephropathy.
• The DCCT trial randomized >1,400 non-hypertensive type 1
diabetics to either intensive or conventional insulin therapy. During
a mean 6.5 years’ follow-up, HbA1C levels were signiﬁcantly lower
in the intensive group, with a reduction in microalbuminuria.
• The beneﬁts of good glycaemic control for preventing progression
in T2DM were clearly demonstrated in the UKPDS study.

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY: PROGRESSION

3 Box 8.1 Diabetic nephropathy and risk of death
• T2DM is associated with substantially increased risk of premature
death—a risk that is primarily focused on those with nephropathy.
• 10-year mortality data in 715,000 subjects in the 3rd US National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) revealed:
• Reference group (subjects without diabetes or kidney disease),
10-year cumulative all-cause mortality of 7.7%.
• For T2DM without kidney disease, this rises to 11.5%. For
T2DM with kidney disease, this rises to an astonishing 31.1%,
representing an absolute risk difference with the reference group
of 23.4% (adjusted for demographics, smoking, and BP)!

Development and progression
The following are important risk factors for the development and progression of DN in both T1DM and T2DM:
• Poor glycaemic control.
• Onset of T1DM before age 20.
• i BP:
• 30% have i BP at diagnosis of T2DM.
• 70% have i BP at diagnosis of DN.
• Smoking.
• ♂ gender.
• Ethnicity (Indo-Asians, African Americans, Pima Indians in the US).
• Familial tendency.
• Socio-economic factors, esp. poverty.
2 Once established the most important factors fuelling progression are:
• BP.
• Glycaemic control.
• Degree of proteinuria.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Diabetic nephropathy: pathology
Introduction
The pathogenesis of DN is multifaceted, with several mechanisms contributing to the renal injury and development of the characteristic histological
changes.

Histology
• Ultimately, renal hypertrophy, hyperﬁltration (initially with i GFR to
above normal), and intrarenal hypertension cause mesangial expansion,
glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis.
• The cardinal histological features are:
• Mesangial expansion (l intercapillary, or Kimmelstiel–Wilson,
nodule formation, often with capillary lumen encroachment).
• Glomerular and tubular basement membrane thickening.
• Nodular glomerulosclerosis.
• Vascular changes are also usually present:
• Vessel changes from i BP.
• Arteriosclerosis.
• Afferent and efferent arteriolar hyalinosis.
• Tubular atrophy and interstitial ﬁbrosis appear as DN (and 6 CKD)
progress.
• Immunostaining may demonstrate non-speciﬁc linear staining for IgG in
glomerular and tubular basement membranes and Bowman’s capsule.
• Arteriolar damage, interstitial ﬁbrosis, and s FSGS may be the
dominant lesions in older T2DM patients (often with less proteinuria
and more vascular disease clinically).

Pathophysiology
Hyperglycaemia
• The magnitude of hyperglycaemia correlates with the functional and
structural changes of DN.
• Long-term studies in T1DM (DCCT) and T2DM (UKPDS) have
demonstrated that blood glucose concentration is related to the
development of microalbuminuria and progression to overt DN.
• Time-averaged HbA1c and BP correlate with loss of renal function.
• Hyperglycaemia:
• Stimulates mesangial cell matrix production and cell growth, leading
to early glomerular enlargement.
• Causes to advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation:
− AGEs result from non-enzymatic reaction between glucose and
proteins.
− They normally undergo renal excretion and accumulate as DN
progresses, particularly in the circulation and the kidneys.
− AGEs: (i) impair function of glycated proteins; (ii) cause
abnormal cell-to-cell interactions through cross-link formation;
(iii) bind endogenous receptors for AGEs (RAGE), with
deleterious consequences.
• Causes i oxidative stress.

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY: PATHOLOGY

• Leads to activity of protein kinase C and hexosamine pathways
(both li production of various proﬁbrotic cytokines, including
TGF-B).
• Increases expression of glomerular TGF-B (and other mitogens) l
cellular hypertrophy, i collagen synthesis, and i matrix deposition.
• Promotes li VEGF expression, possibly via the adenosine
A2B receptor (l endothelial injury, vascular change, and
podocytopathy).
Glomerular haemodynamics
• Glomerular hypertension and hyperﬁltration occur early.
• A GFR of 25–50% above normal is observed in 50% of patients with
T1DM of 5 years’ duration.
• Hyperﬁltration appears to be caused by mediators involved in RAS,
nitric oxide, and cyclo-oxygenase pathways.
• Endothelin -1 is a potent vasoconstrictor, the levels of which are
increased in both plasma and renal tissue of diabetic subjects.
The expression of receptors ET-A and ET-B is also increased.
ET-1 function is receptor-dependent (ET-A l smooth muscle
vasoconstriction and glomerulosclerosis; ET-B l vasodilation).
• Systemic i BP also drives glomerular i BP.
• Haemodynamic disturbance l arteriolar and glomerular sclerosis.
Podocyte function and proteinuria
• Podocyte function is abnormal, with reduced expression of nephrin
and altered glomerular permeability.
• Proteinuria further promotes tubular injury and interstitial ﬁbrosis.
Renin–angiotensin system
• Local renal RAS activation l cell growth and matrix accumulation.
• Angiotensin II generates reactive oxidative species and NADPH
oxidase in vascular smooth muscle and the kidney.
• These may explain some of the additional beneﬁt of RAS inhibition
beyond BP control.
Genetics
• A poorly understood genetic predisposition appears to operate.
• DN is more common in Northern Europe and the USA.
• Certain ethnic groups are affected more than others, e.g.
Indo-Asians in the UK, African Americans, Pima Indians
(astonishingly, by age 20, 750% of Pima Indians with diabetes will
have developed DN, and 15% will have progressed to ESRD).
• DN is more likely in relatives of diabetic patients with nephropathy.
• It is unclear why new cases of DN are rare after 15 years of
diabetes.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Diabetic nephropathy: prevention,
screening, and assessment
Primary prevention
• Improve glycaemic control:
• Aim HbA1C <7%.
• 2 Clinical trials (e.g. DCCT and UKPDS) have consistently
demonstrated the beneﬁts of intensive blood glucose control for
primary prevention of DN.
• Target BP <130/80mmHg.
• Stop smoking. Encourage weight loss and exercise.
• X The role of RAS blockade with ACE-I or ARB for prevention of
microalbuminuria is controversial.
• Several studies (e.g. DIRECT-Renal, BENEDICT, and ROADMAP)
have attempted to address this issue.
• Some evidence of beneﬁt for prevention of microalbuminuria in
high-risk T2DM with concomitant i BP, but the cumulative ﬁndings
fail to support ‘pre-emptive’ RAS blockade.

Screening
• Early detection affords the opportunity to delay or prevent progressive
CKD and 6 ESRD.
• Annual screening by uACR should be performed (preferably an early
morning sample, no UTI, stable glucose control) (see Table 8.2).
• Start after 5 years of T1DM and at the time of diagnosis of T2DM.
Table 8.2 uACR in diabetic nephrology

Diagnosis
A clinical diagnosis is usually possible.
• T1DM:
• Proteinuria, retinopathy, DM of >10 years’ duration.
• T2DM:
• Retinopathy often not present, duration of DM frequently
uncertain.
• Non-speciﬁc renal damage (e.g. arteriolar damage, interstitial
ﬁbrosis, and s FSGS) is a differential diagnosis of DN in T2DM
and may be indistinguishable in terms of clinical presentation.
Management is essentially identical, however.

DN: PREVENTION, SCREENING, AND ASSESSMENT

Role of the renal biopsy in DN
A renal biopsy is rarely required to establish the diagnosis of DN but
might be considered in certain circumstances:
• No diabetic retinopathy:
• Particularly in T1DM (retinopathy is observed in 85–99% of
patients with established nephropathy).
• 730% of those without retinopathy will have an alternative lesion
at biopsy (membranous GN, IgA nephropathy, etc.).
• T2DM patients have DN without retinopathy more commonly.
• Note: this implies proper ophthalmic assessment, not just brief
fundoscopy.
• Dysmorphic red cells, red cell casts, or macroscopic haematuria:
• Microscopic haematuria, usually + to ++ only, is seen in 760%
patients with DN. However, it will usually require independent
investigation (b p. 22).
• Rapid onset, rapidly increasing, or massive proteinuria.
• Conversely, a lack of proteinuria may cast doubt on the diagnosis
and make histology desirable, e.g. possible drug-induced TIN
(b p. 580). Also consider renovascular disease in this situation
(b p. 586).
• Rapidly deteriorating GFR despite good BP and glycaemic control.
• Symptoms or signs suggestive of a multisystem disorder, e.g.
vasculitis, connective tissue disorder, hepatitis C, HIV.

Further investigation and assessment
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Urinalysis (? haematuria); quantify proteinuria (b p. 21).
SCr, eGFR, U&E, serum albumin, HbA1C, lipid proﬁle.
Consider serum and urine protein electrophoresis in older patients.
Check visual acuity, fundoscopy, and arrange ophthalmology review, if
not already under follow-up.
Check BP.
Examine for other evidence of vascular disease (bruits, peripheral
pulses, etc.).
Assess for peripheral neuropathy.
ECG.
Consider USS kidneys, esp. if microscopic haematuria (kidneys are
often normal-sized in DN despite d GFR).

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Diabetic nephropathy: management
Introduction
Treatment goals: prevention of (i) progression from microalbuminuria
(incipient DN) to macroalbuminuria (overt DN); (ii) progressive decline
in renal function in patients with macroalbuminuria; and (iii) CV events.

Glycaemic control
X Unlike prevention, the effects of strict glycaemic control on progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria, as well as beneﬁts for preservation
of renal function, are more controversial.
The ADVANCE and ACCORD studies have suggested that intensive treatment of hyperglycemia in T2DM does not necessarily lead to
an acceptable risk/beneﬁt ratio. Participants had strong CV risk proﬁles (including prior events) and were at high risk of future events.
Microvascular end points, including renal outcomes, were improved in
both studies. However, primary CV outcomes were not improved by
intensive glycaemic therapy and, in ACCORD, intensive treatment was
associated with a 22% increase in all-cause mortality. So, more aggressive glycaemic management in higher risk T2DM patients (usually later in
the course of their disease) delivered only a weak protective effect with
respect to CV outcomes.
KDOQI practice guidelines recommend maintaining HbA1c at <7%.
However, some authorities suggest a target between 7–8% in patients with
longstanding disease who are at higher CV risk.
See b p. 894 for the use of hypoglycaemic drugs in CKD ( metformin!). Patients with T2DM and DN often require conversion to insulin.

Blood pressure
• i BP is proportional to i albumin excretion.
• Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of BP,
irrespective of the agent(s) used, has a beneﬁcial effect on albuminuria.
• RAS blockade with ACE-I or ARBs confers an additional
‘renoprotective’ beneﬁt, independent of BP reduction.
• ACE-I or ARBs reduce the risk of progression of microalbuminuria
to macroalbuminuria (by 60–70%), reduce macroalbuminuria, and
reduce the rate of decline in GFR.
• 2 ACE-I or ARBs should also be used in normotensive patients
with micro- or macroalbuminuria.
• Strict adherence to evidence would generally see ACE-I used in
T1DM and ARBs in T2DM. However, most clinicians are pragmatic
and principally guided by tolerability.
• ACE-I also demonstrably reduce the risk of MI, CVA, and CV death
(by 725% at 2 years). This might be true for ARBs as well.
• Allow ≥25% change in SCr and eGFR. Greater increases may
indicate the presence of renal artery stenosis (a >70% renal artery
stenosis is present in 715% of individuals with T2DM and i BP).
• Monitor K+ after 1 week and then monthly for ﬁrst 2–3 months.
Offer dietary advice if K+ elevated b p. 259 (9 loop diuretic, e.g.
furosemide 40–80mg od).

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY: MANAGEMENT

• A low-salt diet (b p. 259) enhances the renoprotective effects
of ARBs in T2DM. Furthermore, lower urinary Na+ excretion,
reﬂecting lower intake, is associated with fewer CV events.
• Target BP:
• Uncertain. In the UKPDS, a 12% risk reduction in diabetic
complications was found with each 10mmHg drop in SBP, with
lowest risk at 120mmHg.
• KDIGO recommend a BP target of <130/80mmHg if >30mg/24h
proteinuria.
• UK Renal Association (and NICE) also recommend <130/80mmHg.
• Recent guidelines for hypertension from non-nephrological bodies,
e.g. ESH-ESC (2013), have suggested the evidence for a target of
<130/80mmHg is not particularly robust and suggested a target SBP
of <140mmHg for most hypertensive groups, including diabetics.
• Many nephrologists will aim <125/75mmHg if proteinuria >1g/24h.
• Add further therapy in a stepwise manner, selecting drugs according to
the comorbidity proﬁle of the individual patient.
• Diuretics may enhance the anti-proteinuric effects of RAS inhibition.
• Furthermore, volume overload is often an important driver of i BP
in DN with renal impairment.
• Thiazides may be suitable initially, but loop diuretics are preferred
as GFR deteriorates (<40mL/min).
• B-blockers if arrhythmias, CCF, coronary artery disease.
• Evidence favours non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
(e.g. diltiazem) over dihydropyridine (e.g. amlodipine), but clinician
preference and patient tolerability means this is often overlooked.

Proteinuria
• Proteinuria is itself an important treatment target.
• Aim <0.5g/24h (uACR <30mg/mmol or uPCR < 50mg/mmol), as BP
allows.
• ACE-I or ARBs should be used in normotensive patients with
proteinuria (micro- or macroalbuminuria).

613

614

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Box 8.2 ACE-I and ARB combination therapy
X There is no evidence to support combination ACE-I and ARB therapy.
• The ONTARGET study randomized >25,000 patients with either
CV disease or DM + microvascular disease to an ACE-I, ARB, or
combination therapy.
• No differences were seen in p outcome (composite of CV
morbidity and mortality).
• There were differences in s outcomes: K+ (>5.5 mmol/L) and
renal failure were signiﬁcantly higher for combined therapy.
• Subsequent post hoc analysis found doubling of SCr, need
for acute dialysis, and death more frequently in the combined
therapy group.
• Limitations: only 38% of subjects had DM, and only 13%
microalbuminuria.
• A recent meta-analysis examined 33 randomized trials involving
>68,000 patients.1
• Dual blockade was not associated with d mortality.
• It was associated with an 18% decrease in CCF-related admissions
(many studies included patients with cardiac failure).
• Importantly, it was associated with a 55% increased risk of i K+, a
66% increased risk of d BP, and 41% increased risk of renal failure.
• The VA NEPHRON-D study of losartan with or without lisinopril
in T2DM with overt nephropathy (uACR> 300mg/g and eGFR
30–90mL/min) was stopped early (median 2.2 years follow-up)
because of safety concerns involving hyperkalaemia and AKI. This
was despite a non-signiﬁcant trend toward beneﬁt with respect
to the primary and secondary end points (relating to progression
of renal disease or death). However, there was no demonstrable
difference in CV events.
• Overall conclusions, as the evidence currently stands:
• Combination therapy with an ACE-I and ARB should be avoided.
• Maximizing the dose of either an ACE-I or an ARB is the best
current strategy.

Diabetic nephropathy: management 2
Additional RAS blockade
• There has been much interest in combination therapy for RAS
inhibition in DN.
• For ACE-I + ARB therapy, see Box 8.2, b p. 614.
• Aldosterone has been associated with progression of renal disease
through increased ﬁbrosis and proteinuria.
• Plasma aldosterone often decreases with ACE-I or ARB therapy,
but levels eventually return to baseline in many (740%)—a
phenomenon termed ‘aldosterone escape’.
• The addition of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone to a
regimen including an ACE-I or ARB has an anti-proteinuric (and
variable BP) effect in both T1DM and T2DM.
• No studies have shown long-term beneﬁt for other endpoints.
•  There is a signiﬁcant risk of i K+, particularly in patients with
d GFR, and this often limits the utility of spironolactone in practice.
• Combination therapy with a direct renin inhibitor has also
been studied, with initial studies suggesting a BP-independent
anti-proteinuric effect in T2DM.
• However, the ALTITUDE study (aliskirin + ACE-I/ARB in T2DM)
was stopped early because of adverse events in the combination
therapy group (renal failure, i K+, d BP, CV events).
Other interventions
• Treat dyslipidaemia:
• Aim fasting LDL <3.0mmol/L. Statins are usually necessary (and
demonstrably reduce cardiac events in diabetic patients).
• X Statins may reduce proteinuria and preserve GFR in overt DN.
• The role of aspirin and other antiplatelet agents for primary prevention
of CV events in patients with DN is uncertain. However, if no
contraindication, low-dose aspirin (75mg od) is often recommended.
• Smoking cessation.
• Modest dietary protein restriction (0.8g/kg per day, b p. 208) may
slow decline in GFR. X Some advocate a more stringent restriction to
0.6g/kg/day in selected patients.

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY: MANAGEMENT 2

Novel treatments for DN
Better understanding of DN has informed novel therapeutic strategies,
particularly with respect to the downstream effects of hyperglycaemia
(AGE formation, protein kinase C activity, production of pro-ﬁbrotic
intermediates, endothelin activity, and inﬂammatory pathways). Some
show promise in both experimental models and clinical trials. In all cases,
larger studies will be necessary to determine if short-term improvements (e.g. reduction in albuminuria) translate to overall improvements
in DN outcomes.
Pyridoxamine. Is a member of the vitamin B6 family that inhibits AGE
formation. It reduces mesangial expansion, decreases albuminuria, and
slows SCr rise in animal models. Clinical studies suggest promise for
early intervention in DN.
Experimental agents that prevent AGE cross-linkage or inhibit AGE
and AGE receptor (RAGE) interaction are also under development.
Ruboxistaurin. Is a selective protein kinase C inhibitor that reduces
albuminuria (albeit with no signiﬁcant difference for other renal
outcomes) in T2DM DN.
Pirfenidone. Is an antiﬁbrotic (via d TGF-B production) and a free
radical scavenger under investigation in several clinical contexts,
including DN. It reduces mesangial expansion and collagen gene
expression in animals. Clinical trials suggest it may improve GFR but
not albuminuria. Tranilast is another antiﬁbrotic agent that has shown
beneﬁcial effects in animal models and clinical trials. Doxycycline
may also have antiﬁbrotic properties and has been shown to reduce
proteinuria.
Sulodexide. A glycosaminoglycan, inhibits TGF-B production and
causes dose-dependent reductions in albuminuria (persistent after
discontinuation). Early clinical trials vs placebo have been disappointing.
Avosentan. Is an ET-1 receptor antagonist that reduces urinary albumin
excretion at the expense of increased CV events (CCF and volume
overload). Atrasentan also reduces albuminuria and is more selective
for the ET-A receptor. It is associated with peripheral oedema but is
less likely to cause frank volume overload. Further trials are awaited.
The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2
(Nrf2) is involved in numerous anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant pathways. Nrf2 knockout mice suffer worse nephropathy in experimental
diabetes. Bardoxolone methyl, a synthetic triterpenoid, induces Nrf2 and
improves GFR (but with no change in albuminuria). Unfortunately, the
international BEACON trial was stopped early, following excess adverse
events in the treatment arm.
Diabetic mice lacking vitamin D receptors demonstrate RAS upregulation, glomerulosclerosis, and increased urinary albumin losses. The
administration of an active vitamin D analogue paricalcitol has been
shown to signiﬁcantly ameliorate this albuminuria.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Other diabetes-related urinary tract
disorders
Papillary necrosis (b p. 585)
Occurs in 71:20 with diabetic nephropathy. May be asymptomatic but can
present as pain (recurrent renal colic) or infection. Haematuria, modest
proteinuria (<2g/24h), and sterile pyuria are common.

Renovascular disease (b p. 586)
Suspect if difﬁcult to control BP, ﬂuid retention, or >20% rise in SCr (or
fall in eGFR), following an ACE-I or ARB.

Neurogenic bladder (diabetic cystopathy)
A degree of bladder dysfunction is present in 740% of patients with
long-standing diabetes. It results from peripheral and autonomic neuropathy (characterized by segmental demyelination with impaired conduction).
The ﬁrst manifestation is usually loss of sensation of bladder ﬁlling, with
subsequent progressive loss of motor function. Incomplete emptying leads
to a large-volume bladder, with a signiﬁcant post-micturition volume and
urinary stasis. Recurrent UTIs and urinary incontinence are common.
Investigation: MSU for M,C+S. USS bladder pre- and post-void. Ask
the patient to complete a bladder diary. Urodynamic ﬁndings include
decreased bladder sensation, impaired detrusor contractility, and eventual
detrusor areﬂexia. Detrusor hyperreﬂexia is also recognized. Screen for
other manifestations of autonomic dysfunction, e.g. postural HR and BP.
Exclude signiﬁcant prostatic disease.
Interventions include regular voiding in the absence of urge (e.g. every
2h), anti-incontinence aids to absorb urine losses and protect skin integrity, assisted voiding (e.g. suprapubic manual pressure), drugs (e.g. the
parasympathomimetic agent bethanechol) (beneﬁts inconsistent), intermittent self-catheterization, (also d bladder volume and may help partial
recovery of detrusor function), long-term catheterization, urinary diversion, and treatment of associated infection.

Urinary tract infection (b p. 706)

♀ with diabetes have twice the incidence of UTI, compared to those without diabetes. Diabetes is also a risk factor for UTIs in ♂. There is also
a higher incidence of pyelonephritis and renal abscess formation. 90% of
cases of emphysematous pyelonephritis (b p. 711) occur in patients with
diabetes.

Contrast induced-AKI (b p. 148)
Patients with diabetes, probably as a result of intrarenal microvascular
disease, are more susceptible to CI-AKI.

OTHER DIABETES-RELATED URINARY TRACT DISORDERS

Considerations in ESRD from diabetic
nephropathy
2 Patients with T1DM (and selected patients with T2DM) should be
considered for combined kidney/pancreas transplantation (b p. 446).
Diabetic patients often need to initiate dialysis at an earlier stage than
patients with ESRD from another cause, e.g. eGFR in the 10–15mL/min
range, as they are often more symptomatic, tolerate volume overload
less well, and have a heightened propensity to hyperkalaemia.
Survival and causes of death in diabetic patients on dialysis
Diabetic patients with ESRD have a 5-year survival rate of 730% (compared with 760% in those without diabetes). This is largely a consequence of their comorbidity, particularly CV disease. A higher incidence
of withdrawal from dialysis treatment is also reported.
Dialysis modality: peritoneal dialysis vs haemodialysis
No clear difference in outcome between PD and HD has been observed.
USRDS data and Canadian studies have offered conﬂicting results
(potentially explained by different patient demographics and comorbidities). Overall, there is a suggestion that older diabetic patients survive
longer on HD, and younger patients longer on PD.
Renal transplantation in diabetics
Renal transplantation is safe and effective. In appropriately selected
patients, it can offer improved survival and rehabilitation, compared to
dialysis. Studies have shown similar 1- and 5-year graft survival in diabetic and non-diabetic patients undergoing transplantation when data
are censored for patients dying with a functioning graft. Living donor
graft survival is superior to deceased donor grafts (80% vs 64% 5-year
graft survival).

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Plasma cell dyscrasias
Introduction
In this related group of disorders, bone marrow-derived malignant plasma
cells produce abnormal immunoglobulin proteins that can cause renal
injury by a number of mechanisms, including tubular blockage (e.g. myeloma cast nephropathy), direct glomerular injury (e.g. light chain deposition disease), immune complex formation (e.g. cryoglobulinaemia), and
aggregation + accumulation (e.g. AL amyloidosis).
The four most important syndromes are:
• Myeloma kidney (cast nephropathy) (730–65%).
• AL amyloid (720%).
• Monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD):
• Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) (710%).
• Immunotactoid or ﬁbrillary glomerulopathy (rare).
• Cryoglobulinaemia (rare).

Renal presentations of the plasma cell dyscrasias
•
•
•
•

AKI: cast nephropathy, dehydration, i Ca2+, sepsis, drug-induced.
CKD: cast nephropathy, AL amyloid, MIDD.
Proteinuria (or nephrotic syndrome): AL amyloid, MIDD.
Tubular dysfunction (acquired Fanconi’s syndrome, partial proximal and
distal tubular defects): cast nephropathy, plasma cell inﬁltration.

What is in an immunoglobulin (Ig)?
An Ig comprises two heavy chains (with a complement-ﬁxing site) and
two light chains (with an antigen-binding site). Plasma cell dyscrasias
may produce whole monoclonal Ig, whole light chains or heavy chains,
or parts of either. This leads to the slightly confusing terminology
surrounding the speciﬁc diseases caused by each protein.

Myeloma kidney
Multiple myeloma is a haematological malignancy caused by an excess of
plasma cells. It is characterized by aberrant overproduction of monoclonal
immunoglobulin (termed paraprotein or ‘M’ protein) plus associated light
chains, either kappa (κ) or lambda (λ). The most common class of whole
immunoglobulin is IgG (followed by IgA then IgD). In some cases, only the
associated κ or λ light chain will be identiﬁed.
The diagnosis of myeloma requires:
• A serum or urine paraprotein.
• Clonal plasma cells occupy >10% of the bone marrow.
• End-organ damage unexplained by other pathology, e.g. i Ca2+, i SCr,
anaemia, or lytic bone disease (remember: CRAB (b p. 624)).
Incidence 740 pmp/year. 80% patients present aged >60 (although the
diagnosis may need to be considered in much younger patients). ♂ > ♀.
Renal involvement is a major complication of myeloma, present at (or
preceding) diagnosis in 20–50% of patients, and in 50% of patients during
the course of the disease (710% require RRT).

PLASMA CELL DYSCRASIAS

Myeloma and AKI
Myeloma has a propensity to injure the renal tubules, leaving patients
vulnerable to secondary insults that cause ATN, such as volume depletion
and hypotension. In addition, reduced tubular ﬂow will increase tubular
light chain concentrations and further enhance tubular damage.
Common causes of AKI
• Cast nephropathy (most common).
• ATN from sepsis, d BP.
• i Ca2+ causes dehydration and vasoconstriction.
• NSAIDs taken for skeletal pain.
• Contrast-induced AKI.
• Drug-induced: diuretics, toxicity of myeloma therapy.

When to suspect myeloma
Any unexplained i SCr/d eGFR, esp. if associated with disproportionate
anaemia (or anaemia that is refractory to ESA therapy). Also d Plt or
d WCC (marrow failure s to plasma cell inﬁltration), immune paresis
(reduction in all Ig classes), skeletal pain (e.g. low back). Urinalysis may be
relatively normal (light chains are not detected by dipstick).
Investigations
• FBC (d Hb common; d Plt and d WCC less so), i ESR, i SCr, i Ca2+,
i urate/LDH (i cell turnover).
• Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) for paraprotein. Detects intact Ig
but only high levels of light chain. Immunoﬁxation is more sensitive but is
not quantitative. Immunoglobulins (? immune paresis), B2 microglobulin
(activity monitoring—but accumulates in renal impairment).
• Bence–Jones proteinuria. These are urinary free light chains detected
by urinary protein electrophoresis and immunoﬁxation.
• Skeletal survey (osteolytic lesions, osteoporosis, fractures).
• Bone marrow aspirate and trephine.
• Renal biopsy (b p. 80).

Serum free light chain (SFLC) assay
• New nephelometric/turbidimetric assays that measure free κ or λ light
chains are superseding biochemical methods. They utilize polyclonal
antibodies to epitopes that are sequestered when light chains are
bound to heavy chains but exposed when they circulate freely.
• A rapid test, with excellent sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
• Combine with SPEP, as this characterizes the intact Ig component.
• Can identify most patients with myeloma, amyloidosis, and MIDD.
• Considered abnormal when κ or λ free light chain is increased and
the ratio between the two is abnormal.
• SFLC accumulates if d GFR, so normal ranges are adjusted.
• Serial measurements help to monitor therapeutic response.
• Advocated by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
for initial screening of plasma cell dyscrasias.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Myeloma: cast nephropathy
Introduction
The commonest form of renal involvement within the plasma cell dyscrasias (730–65%) and virtually always the cause (or a contributor) to severe
renal impairment. Casts develop when the excess ﬁltered load of light
chains reacts with Tamm–Horsfall mucoprotein (THMP) in the more distal
tubule and forms an insoluble proteinaceous plug. This obstructs tubular
ﬂow, disrupts tubular architecture, and leads to progressive interstitial
injury (which becomes rapidly irreversible).
Cast formation is promoted by various properties of the light chain (e.g.
charge in relation to tubular ﬂuid pH, binding avidity for THMP, propensity
to aggregate), their concentration and promoting factors, such as dehydration. It is possible to have a very high light chain load without AKI.

Pathogenesis and histology
Cast nephropathy is characterized by eosinophilic acellular casts that
have a distinctive fractured appearance (see Fig. 8.1). These occur principally in the distal nephron (distal tubules and collecting ducts), leading to
tubular epithelial cell death and luminal distortion. Casts are surrounded
by inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrates (including macrophages and multinucleate giant cells), causing interstitial inﬂammation, oedema and, inevitably,
ﬁbrosis. Casts are polychromatic, with Masson’s trichrome positive for
monoclonal light chain, and may stain with Congo red (although are not
birefringent under polarized light).

MYELOMA: CAST NEPHROPATHY

Management of cast nephropathy
2 Correct associated reversible causes of AKI: dehydration, i Ca2+, sepsis,
and hyperuricaemia.
• Rehydrate:
• Crystalloid IV—may require large volumes (>5L) if i Ca2+.
•  Sodium bicarbonate can be used if there is a systemic acidosis,
but alkaline diuresis does not alter outcomes.
• Strict monitoring of ﬂuid balance. Encourage to drink 3L/day.
• Increasing urinary ﬂow will reduce urinary light chain concentration
and help prevent further cast formation.
• Furosemide promotes cast formation, so its use should be avoided.
• Expect Hb to fall—transfuse, as required.
• Correct i Ca2+ (b p. 806).
• If i Ca2+ persists once euvolaemic, consider IV bisphosphonate
(b p. 807).
• Appropriate cultures and antimicrobials if concomitant sepsis.
• Correct hyperuricaemia (b p. 160):
• Start allopurinol 100mg daily.
• Stop NSAIDs and other nephrotoxic drugs.
• If anaemic, consider for an ESA (b p. 222). High dose usually
necessary.
• Renal support:
• Initiate RRT for standard indication (required in 710%; recovery in
720%). Dialysate Ca2+ may need reduction.
• No convincing evidence of a modality beneﬁt for HDF, HF, or PD.
• X Extended frequent haemodialysis, using a protein-leaking dialyser
with very large pores and improved light chain clearance (termed a
‘high cut-off’ or HCO dialyser), may be of beneﬁt and is currently
under further investigation.
• X Plasma exchange (PEX):
• PEX can reduce plasma light chain load, but rebound is usual.
• Appears less beneﬁcial than extended dialysis with HCO dialyser.
• Beneﬁcial in hyperviscosity syndromes (e.g. Waldenström
macroglobulinaemia) (b p. 635).
• Speciﬁc therapy:
• Myeloma is incurable. The goal is to reduce Ig or light chain burden,
induce remission, and increase survival.
• High-dose corticosteroid, e.g. dexamethasone 20mg PO bd for
4 days, to induce plasma cell apoptosis (as soon as possible).
• Subsequent chemotherapy is tailored to the individual situation.
• Bortezomib, a proteasomal inhibitor, appears beneﬁcial in
patients with renal disease and does not require dose adjustment
( SE: neuropathy). It may be given alone or in combination
with thalidomide (or its analogue lenalidomide) ( SE: venous
thrombosis) 9 doxorubicin.
• Alkylating agents, such as melphalan and cyclophosphamide,
impair haemopoietic stem cell function and may be best avoided if
autologous transplantation is feasible.
• Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) offers the best
prospect of complete remission in selected patients.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

When myeloma is not myeloma
Finding a paraprotein in serum or urine does not always conﬁrm a diagnosis of myeloma.
Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain signiﬁcance (MGUS)
• Paraprotein <3g/dL.
• <10% plasma cells in the bone marrow.
• Usually does not have Bence–Jones proteinuria.
• No evidence of end-organ damage (‘CRAB’):
• Calcium: i Ca2+ >0.25mmol/L (1mg/dL) above the upper limit of
normal or >2.75mmol/L (11mg/L).
• Renal insufﬁciency: SCr >173μmol/L (1.96mg/dL).
• Anaemia: Hb 20g/L below lower limit of normal or <100g/L.
• Bone lesions: lytic lesions or osteopenia with compression
fractures.
Other: symptomatic hyperviscosity, amyloidosis, recurrent bacterial
infections (>2 episodes in 12 months).
• 73% of individuals aged >70 have MGUS.
• 71% progress to symptomatic myeloma each year.
• Risk factors for progression: higher paraprotein level, non-IgG
paraprotein, and an abnormal SFLC ratio.
A monoclonal protein that can be characterized as a MGUS is not
uncommonly found during the initial work-up of elderly patients with
CKD. This mandates surveillance, usually 6–12-monthly, with consideration of either a bone marrow biopsy or a renal biopsy or both if there is
diagnostic doubt or evidence of progression. Where renal involvement
is the prime clinical concern in this context, the term monoclonal gammopathy of renal signiﬁcance has recently been coined.
Asymptomatic (previously ‘smoldering’) myeloma
• Refers to asymptomatic patients, with paraprotein >3g/dL and a
plasma cell inﬁltrate >10% but no end-organ damage.
• Evolves to symptomatic myeloma in 73% patients per year for the
ﬁrst 5 years, and then progression declines in incidence.
Plasmacytomas
• Solid tumours made up of clonal plasma cells found as solitary bone
plasmacytoma (SBP) or solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP)
(usually upper respiratory tract).
• <50% produce a (usually low level) paraprotein.
• Renal involvement is rare.
• Progression to myeloma in 750% (SBP > EMP). Treated with local
radiotherapy. Median survival 10 years.

ESRD in myeloma
Mortality on dialysis depends mainly on progression of the underlying
myeloma, as patients survive as long as matched myeloma patients without
renal failure. Early mortality is high (720% die within the ﬁrst 2 months),
but mean 3-year survival is 730%. Patients who respond to chemotherapy
do much better.

MYELOMA: CAST NEPHROPATHY

Both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are feasible modalities.
However, the main risk concerns susceptibility to infection (from the
disease itself and its treatment), so CAPD-related peritonitis and dialysis
catheter-related sepsis can be severe. For this reason, an AVF should be
fashioned as soon as recovery of renal function is unlikely (720% recover
renal function with treatment, usually within the 3 months).
The usual indications for commencement of dialysis in CKD/ESRD apply
(b p. 267), but patients may be symptomatic at a higher GFR in view of
their comorbidities and 6 require an earlier start. In addition, progression
to ESRD can be swift, with limited time for RRT education or psychological adjustment.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Monoclonal Ig deposition disease
Introduction
Monoclonal Ig deposition disease (MIDD) describes another clinicopathological variant of abnormal monoclonal light chain (or, less commonly,
heavy chain) deposition, termed LCDD and HCDD, respectively. This is a
similar condition to AL amyloid, but there are important structural differences, as the proteins do not organize into ﬁbrils. LCDD is more common
and usually caused by an abnormal κ chain, while μ or γ chains are usually
responsible for HCDD.
The clinical presentations of LCDD and HCDD are similar—usually with
nephritic-type glomerular injury: proteinuria (nephrotic range in 730%),
microscopic haematuria, i BP, and renal impairment (which may rapidly
progress). May also present as CKD. Renal involvement is often the ﬁnding
that prompts a search for an underlying dyscrasia (usually myeloma, but
Waldenström macroglobulinaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and
lymphoma are also associated). However, a malignant process may not
fully declare itself despite prolonged follow-up.

Light chain deposition disease (LCDD)
• A plasma cell dyscrasia causes tissue deposition of a monoclonal Ig
light chain (κ in 65%).
• Differs from amyloid, as the light chain lacks hydrophilic residues so
cannot organize into ﬁbrils (or stain positive for Congo red), forming
granular deposits instead.
• The light chains have distinct properties, e.g. variants of the κ light
chain variable region (types I and IV), inﬂuencing their deposition.
• Associated with overt myeloma in 750% (myeloma may subsequently
develop). Bone marrow plasma cell expansion not always present.
• No monoclonal band on electrophoresis, and immunoﬁxation in 730%
patients, but SFLC assays are signiﬁcantly more speciﬁc.
• Extrarenal features are less common than renal: cardiac (diastolic
dysfunction, arrhythmias), hepatic (abnormal LFTs, hepatomegaly), and
nerves (neuropathy).
• Histological features on renal biopsy:
• Extracellular matrix accumulation causes nodular
glomerulosclerosis (Congo red negative), with glomerular and
tubular basement membrane thickening. This appears similar
to diabetic Kimmelstiel–Wilson changes (b p. 608). Can be an
MCGN injury pattern.
• Immunostaining is positive for monoclonal light chains in capillary
walls, basement membranes, and mesangium.
• EM demonstrates bands of amorphous, granular deposits, without
ﬁbril formation, in glomerular and tubular basement membranes.
• Treatment is directed against the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia,
generally using the same criteria and regimens as for myeloma.
• Response is monitored through measurement of SFLC.
• Age and CKD are negative prognostic indicators. 750% will eventually
reach ESRD. Renal transplantation contraindicated unless complete
remission. 725% 10-year survival.

MONOCLONAL IG DEPOSITION DISEASE

Heavy chain deposition disease (HCDD)
A rare disorder. Abnormal heavy chains deposit in the glomerulus and
cause a similar disease to LCDD. Underlying myeloma is identiﬁed in
725%. Extrarenal disease is less common.

Monoclonal Ig-derived material in the kidney
Can arise from any part of an immunoglobulin (b p. 620) and can be
classiﬁed (see Table 8.3) according to the appearance of the deposits
on biopsy (including EM).
Immunoglobulin and Ig-derived fragments have an afﬁnity for basement
membranes, perhaps explaining the strong association with renal disease
(particularly as 720% of cardiac output passes through the kidneys).

They are almost always conﬁned to the glomeruli, with no extrarenal
disease. Progression to ESRD is frequent.
No speciﬁc diagnostic test, so renal biopsy (with EM) is key. Investigate
for paraprotein, HCV, haematological malignancy, and autoimmune disease.
Fibrillary GN. Does not usually associate with a paraprotein. Deposition
of polyclonal IgG in mesangium and glomerulus. Appears as mesangial
proliferation or MCGN on light microscopy. EM: randomly arranged
ﬁbrils, usually 720nm in diameter.
There is no treatment proven to slow progression. Small trials of
immunosuppressive therapy have been disappointing (except in patients
with crescentic changes on renal biopsy where prednisolone + cyclophosphamide may be effective).
Immunotactoid GN. Often associated with haematological disease
(esp. CLL, B cell NHL). Whole monoclonal IgG and C3 deposits. Light
microscopy appears as an atypical membranous or lobular MCGN.
EM: rod-like, hollow, microtubular structures, usually >30nm in
diameter, ordered in parallel. Treat underlying disease.

627

628

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Renal amyloid: AL amyloid
Introduction
Amyloidosis is a multisystem disorder caused by extracellular deposition
of abnormal (misfolded and insoluble) ﬁbrils resulting from the aggregation of an aberrant protein. When this aberrant protein is an immunoglobulin or light chain (usually λ), it is known as primary or AL amyloidosis.
In secondary amyloidosis, the protein is serum amyloid A (SAA), which is
overproduced in chronic inﬂammation. In less common hereditary forms,
a variety of proteins are involved, including ﬁbrinogen A A chain, transthyretin, and apolipoproteins AI and AII.
Amyloid ﬁbrils of all types are 8–12nm in diameter and always bound
to the normal plasma protein serum amyloid P (SAP). SAP appears to
render the ﬁbrils extremely resistant to degradation. Classically, amyloid
deposits appear an apple-green colour on Congo red staining if viewed
under birefringent light.

AL amyloid
The ﬁbrils in AL amyloid are derived from either whole monoclonal Ig
or, more commonly, from light chain (usually λ). There is an underlying
plasma cell dyscrasia, but this will be clinically overt in only 25% (usually
myeloma—amyloid deposits will be found in 10–20% myeloma patients).
AL amyloid may be deposited in virtually any tissue in the body, depending, to an extent, on the particular physicochemical characteristics of the
involved Ig or light chain.
Annual incidence 710 pmp. Median age at diagnosis 765.
Clinical features
Depend on speciﬁc organ involvement, but systemic symptoms, such as
malaise and weight loss, are common.
• Cardiac: restrictive cardiomyopathy (730%) and arrhythmias (these are
the main cause of death).
• Liver: hepatomegaly (and splenomegaly) from inﬁltration. Hyposplenism
causes susceptibility to sepsis (the other main cause of death).
• Gut: motility disorders, GI bleeding, macroglossia (tongue inﬁltration).
• Nerves: sensorimotor neuropathy (may be painful), autonomic
neuropathy (e.g. orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction), and
compression syndromes (e.g. carpal tunnel).
• Haematological: bleeding diathesis, associated with factor X or IX
deﬁciency. May manifest as easy bruising—but measurement of PT,
APTT, and often bleeding time are necessary prior to organ biopsy
( esp. renal).
• Skin: purpura (esp. recurrent periorbital), papules.
• Joints: synovitis and polyarthropathy.
• Adrenal: hypoadrenalism.
• Thyroid: hypothyroidism.
• Renal: involvement in 750%. Normally proteinuria (often nephrotic
range, with severe oedema) and variable degrees of renal impairment.
Microscopic haematuria is uncommon. Tubular defects, including RTA,
may occur. 720% develop ESRD. Kidneys often appear large on USS.

RENAL AMYLOID: AL AMYLOID

Renal histology
• Light microscopy: widespread amorphous extracellular amyloid deposits
are seen in the mesangium, along the glomerular basement membrane
and in blood vessels. They appear less frequently in the tubules and
interstitium. Characteristic Congo red staining.
• Immunostaining: for λ (occasionally κ) and SAP may be positive, but
is unreliable. Other types of amyloid deposits are differentiated with
special stains, e.g. to SAA.
• EM: demonstrates ﬁbrils (see Fig. 8.2) but will not distinguish types.
Investigations
• Tissue biopsy to conﬁrm diagnosis. If no renal involvement, then
salivary gland, subcutaneous abdominal fat, or rectum are favoured
sites (positive in >80%).
• Serum and urine protein electrophoresis 9 immunoﬁxation. Positive
in 790% and 75%, respectively.  Beware a coincidental MGUS, and
consider other, including hereditary, forms.
• Serum free light chains (electrophoresis + SFLC positive in 799%).
• Bone marrow examination (i plasma cells in 750–60%).
• Echocardiography.
• 123I SAP scintigraphy: not widely available. Radiolabelled SAP protein
is injected to locate areas of amyloid deposition. Demonstrates
distribution and extent of deposits and can be used to monitor
response to treatment.
Prognosis
Very poor outlook without treatment—usually progressive and fatal
within 1–2 years. Cardiac involvement is a particularly poor prognostic
indicator. Diagnosis of renal AL amyloid is associated with a median time
to RRT of 71 year (with median time to death within a further year).
Happily, the prognosis is greatly improved with effective therapy of the
underlying plasma cell dyscrasia—with amyloid regression in many cases.
For renal involvement, resolution of the nephrotic syndrome, with stabilization of renal function and retarded progression to ESRD, is the goal
of treatment.
Management
Treatment aims to decrease, or eliminate, the culpable plasma cell
clone. Patients are often elderly, so therapy must be tailored accordingly. Regimens include cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (CTD), or melphalan plus dexamethasone (M/Dex). Responses in
730–50%. Lenalidomide and bortezomib are increasingly used, based on
experiences in myeloma. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem
cell transplantation in selected patients.
Dialysis for standard indications. Renal transplantation is only possible if
the plasma cell dyscrasia is in complete remission (recurrence in the graft
is inevitable otherwise) and cardiac function remains acceptable.

629

630

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Renal amyloid: AA amyloidosis
AA amyloidosis
AA amyloidosis results from the sustained elevation of the acute phase
reactant serum amyloid A protein (SAA). In developing countries, chronic
infections account for the majority of cases. In developed nations, chronic
inﬂammatory autoimmune conditions, particularly rheumatoid arthritis,
are now much more important.
Prevalence is linked to that of underlying conditions, which vary according to geography. The overall post-mortem incidence of AA amyloidosis
in western nations is 0.5–0.86%.
Pathogenesis
There are several isoforms of SAA: SAA1 and SAA2 appear to be most
important for acute phase responses. They are HDL-bound apolipoproteins that i macrophage HDL uptake during inﬂammation (through the
displacement of apolipoprotein A1). The persistence of SAA is probably s
to pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-A. Proteolytic
cleavage of SAA then generates peptide fragments that aggregate into misfolded AA ﬁbrils via an interaction with the glycosaminoglycan heparan
sulphate. It remains unknown why only 75% of patients with persistent
inﬂammation develop AA amyloidosis; other factors (e.g. genetic, including SAA1 polymorphisms) are clearly important.
Causes
• Chronic inﬂammatory disease:
• Rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (740%).
• Psoriatic arthropathy, ankylosing spondylitis (730%).
• Reiter’s syndrome.
• Behçet’s syndrome.
• Inﬂammatory bowel disease.
• Chronic infections:
• TB, leprosy.
• Osteomyelitis.
• Cystic ﬁbrosis, bronchiectasis.
• Chronic ulceration.
• Malignancies:
• Renal cell carcinoma.
• Lymphoma, Castleman’s disease.
• Familial:
• Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).
Clinical features
• Renal: unlike AL amyloid, renal involvement is universal. Proteinuria
(often nephrotic range) is typical, although a minority (<10%) present
with progressive CKD, with no proteinuria (predominantly vascular
amyloid deposition). Renal biopsy demonstrates both glomerular and
tubulointerstitial involvement. Note: microscopic haematuria is present
in 730% so is a much more common feature than in AL amyloid.
• Spleen: always involved (l hyposplenism l infection).
• Adrenals: abnormal adrenal function in 750%.

RENAL AMYLOID: AA AMYLOIDOSIS

• Liver: hepatomegaly.
• GI tract: present in more advanced disease (l motility disorders,
malabsorption, bleeding).
• Cardiac (710%), skin, tongue, and nerve: much less common than in AL.
Investigations
• Tissue biopsy is necessary to conﬁrm diagnosis. This is often a
renal biopsy, but less invasive alternatives include salivary gland,
subcutaneous abdominal fat, or rectum (positive in >80%).
• Immunostaining tissue for SAA protein differentiates AA from other
forms of amyloidosis in virtually all cases.
• CRP and ESR were used to monitor disease and response to
treatment, but SAA is increasingly used for this purpose.
• 123I SAP scintigraphy (b p. 629).
Prognosis
Outcomes depend heavily on the control of underlying disease processes.
Prognosis is better than AL amyloid but still guarded: 740% survival at
3 years, overall. Infection is the major cause of death. SAA concentration
helps predict outcomes, as risk of death rises with the median SAA (10-year
survival 790% if median SAA <10mg/L and only 740% if >10mg/dL).
Outcomes have improved for those with ESRD (previously a signiﬁcant
cause of death), although patients still have worse dialysis outcomes than
those with unrelated conditions. Renal transplantation can be considered
if underlying disease is consistently controlled, as recurrent amyloid is
surprisingly uncommon in this context. However, 3-year patient survival
post-transplant is reduced (principally s to infectious and CV causes).
Treatment
Treat the underlying inﬂammatory or infectious condition to prevent
further amyloid deposition. Existing amyloid appears to regress in 750%,
especially if SAA is maintained <10mg/L.
• Infectious disease: antimicrobials and or surgical intervention, as
indicated.
• Chronic inﬂammatory disease: several treatments have shown efﬁcacy in
the inﬂammatory arthritides and may be applicable to other situations.
• Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil, have
been shown to improve survival.
• Anti-TNF therapy, with inﬂiximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, are
effective at lowering SAA production.
• Experience is growing with the anti-IL6 receptor antibody
tocilizumab.
• Colchicine has demonstrable efﬁcacy in FMF, reducing febrile
episodes and renal involvement. Mechanism of action is unclear but
appears related to suppression of inﬂammatory responses. X It
has also been used, with variable success, in non-FMF patients with
renal disease.
• Novel approaches: there is increasing interest in therapies that
can interfere with ﬁbril aggregation and deposition, e.g. agents that
disrupt the interaction of SAA with glycosaminoglycan or induce
dimerization of SAP to provoke improved systemic clearance.

631

632

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Renal amyloid: other forms
Other forms of amyloidosis with renal involvement
Inherited fever syndromes
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): causes AA amyloidosis and is the most
common inherited form. Inheritance is autosomal recessive, most commonly
affecting Sephardic Jews, Armenians, and Turks. It is caused by a mutation in
the MEFV gene encoding pyrin, a regulator of transcription for inﬂammatory
mediators, including IL-1. Periodic acute attacks (of variable frequency) present before the age of 20, with fever (725% have fever alone) and serositis (l
peritonitis, pleurisy, synovitis) lasting 48–72 hours before spontaneous resolution. During the ﬂare: i WCC and i CRP. AA amyloid complicates 760%
(Turks are at highest risk), and renal involvement is common. Colchicine
1–2mg/day is highly successful at reducing both ﬂare frequency and AA amyloidosis risk. It may also stabilize already established renal disease.
Others: TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is autosomal dominant, with onset in childhood. Colchicine is less effective. Muckle
Wells syndrome presents soon after birth, with daily episodes of rash, red
eyes, and fever.
Hereditary amyloidosis
These are much less common than the AL or AA types. The inheritance
of an abnormal gene leads to lifelong production of a potentially amyloidogenic protein. Most forms do not present until middle age or later.
They can be difﬁcult to identify and may potentially be mislabelled as AL
amyloid, particularly if there is a concomitant MGUS (common in this age
group). Characterization of the amyloid type with immunohistochemistry
is helpful, but genetic testing at specialist centres is diagnostic.
Familial amyloid polyneuropathy: the commonest. Caused by mutations in
transthyretin. Multiple mutations have been identiﬁed, producing different clinical phenotypes. Predominantly a neurological disorder, but renal
involvement is described.
Fibrinogen A A-chain: the hereditary form with most renal involvement
(almost exclusively glomerular). Presents >age 50. Combined liver–renal
transplantation is a potential treatment option.
Apolipoprotein AI: may present with hypertension and CKD in middle age
(9 cardiac and nerve involvement). Again, combined liver–renal transplantation is a potential treatment option.
B2 microglobulin-related dialysis amyloid
• B2 microglobulin (B2-M) is a component of the MHC class I complex
and is produced by all cells that express MHC I. It is freely ﬁltered
at the glomerulus and reabsorbed (and metabolized) in the proximal
tubule. Consequently, it accumulates in patients with ESRD, and these
accumulations are amyloidogenic.
• B2-M is incompletely cleared by dialysis treatments (71,500mg is
produced each week, only 71/3 of which is removed). B2-M clearance
on dialysis depends on several factors:

RENAL AMYLOID: OTHER FORMS

• Residual renal function.
• Modality (clearance on HD < PD < daily HD < nocturnal HD).
• Characteristics of the dialysis membrane (high ﬂux is better than
standard. Biocompatible is better than bioincompatible).
• Duration of treatment and ultraﬁltration volumes.
• A degree of deposition is universal and begins early after reaching
ESRD. However, clinical presentation takes much longer; usually
occurring after >5 years’ dialysis treatment. Clinical features:
• Generally, a disorder of soft tissue and joints.
• Carpal tunnel (very common in patients on dialysis >10 years).
• Chronic tenosynovitis of ﬁnger ﬂexors. Generalized joint pain,
stiffness, and restricted movement (particularly shoulders, but
also hands, feet, and spine). Progresses to destructive arthropathy.
Contributes to an increased fracture risk.
• Organ deposits occur (esp. GI), but clinical issues are rare.
• Diagnosis:
• Generally made on clinical grounds. Radiological appearances (bone
cysts and periarticular lucency) are characteristic (see Fig. 8.2). If
tissue is available (e.g. after joint replacement), it will stain with
Congo red. Speciﬁc anti-B2-M immunostains are available.
• Treatment:
• Modify dialysis prescription (b p. 288): increase treatment hours;
use a high-ﬂux, biocompatible dialyser; consider HDF.
• Analgesia and orthopaedic intervention, as needed.
• Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice but is often not
possible in the group of long-standing, often elderly, dialysis patients
who are most severely affected. Deposits are slow to resolve
post-transplant, but symptoms often signiﬁcantly improve.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Cryoglobulinaemia
Introduction
Cryoglobulins are single or mixed immunoglobulins that precipitate below
37*C and re-dissolve on warming. Several types have been described and
may be encountered in different clinical scenarios—and with different
clinical consequences.
Cryoglobulinaemia implies that circulating cryoglobulins are causing tissue damage. This may be s to hyperviscosity, immune complex deposition (with complement activation), or precipitation in small vessels, with
thrombosis and downstream ischaemia (typically in cooler extremities).
The overall prevalence of cryoglobulinaemia is unknown but strongly
tied to that of hepatitis C (HCV) (b p. 686). It is more common in ♀.
Cryoglobulins may be present in otherwise healthy individuals, so prognosis will depend on both disease activity and disease associations. Renal
manifestations are associated with a worse outcome.

Classiﬁcation
Classiﬁed according to their constituents.
Type I cryoglobulinaemia (<20%)
The result of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (usually IgM, then IgG > IgA
> light chain) and often associated with lymphoproliferative disease (myeloma, lymphoma, CLL, Waldenström macroglobulinaemia).
Type II (or mixed essential) cryoglobulinaemia
Usually monoclonal IgM, complexed with the Fc portion of polyclonal IgG.
This monoclonal IgM autoantibody is a type of rheumatoid factor (any
antibody directed against another antibody is termed anti-idiotypic and
possesses rheumatoid factor activity). Associated with HCV (b p. 686)
and other infections (including HIV, HBV, and syphilis) as well as autoimmune disease (e.g. SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome). Also described with B cell
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
HCV enters host cells (hepatocytes and CD5+ B cells) via the LDL
receptor—infected B cells are resistant to apoptosis and exhibit increased
production of autoantibodies.
Type III cryoglobulinaemia
Similar to type II, but this time polyclonal IgM is directed against IgG. Type
III is also associated with viral infections and autoimmune disease and may
evolve into type II over time.

Clinical features
Type I cryoglobulins do not ﬁx complement so may present with a hyperviscosity syndrome (acrocyanosis, retinal occlusions, Raynaud’s, digital
ulceration, livedo reticularis, purpura, arterial and venous thrombosis).
Type II and III cryoglobulins cause systemic inﬂammation. Consider cryoglobulinaemia in any patient with unexplained renal disease and a rash
(skin involvement is virtually universal—often a cutaneous vasculitis, with
infarcts and ulceration), particularly if systemic symptoms, such as fatigue
and myalgia, are present. Also neuropathy, arthralgia, GI involvement, and
lung involvement (pulmonary inﬁltrates and haemorrhage).

CRYOGLOBULINAEMIA

Renal involvement occurs early in up to 60% cases, usually presenting as
the nephritic syndrome with AKI. Renal biopsy reveals an MCGN-type
pattern of injury (b p. 550).

Investigation
• Complement components (b p. 41).
• 2 Screening test for types II and III: high titre of rheumatoid factor plus
low C4.
• Cryoglobulins: the blood sample needs to be transported at 37*C,
ideally in a water bath. Speak to your laboratory.
• Type I cryoglobulins may precipitate within 24–48h, but II and III
can take up to 7 days.
• Result is generally reported as ‘cryocrit’ (the volume of precipitate
as a percentage of original serum volume) and can be helpful for
disease monitoring.
• The speciﬁc constituents of the cryoglobulin can be conﬁrmed by
immunochemistry.
• Tissue biopsy, e.g. renal.
• Investigate for underlying condition, particularly hepatitis serology, HIV
testing, autoimmune serology (ANA, dsDNA, ENAs, etc.), FBC, blood
ﬁlm, serum and protein electrophoresis, SFLC, appropriate imaging 9
bone marrow examination for haematological disease.

Treatment
2 Treat underlying condition, e.g. pegylated IFN-A and ribavirin for HCV.
• Immune suppression, typically corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide,
but increasing interest in rituximab (trials in progress).
• Plasma exchange: for hyperviscosity or severe disease, e.g. rapidly
progressive AKI.

Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia
• A clonal lymphoid and plasma cell disorder with overproduction of
IgM monoclonal protein.
• Multiple presentations: systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss,
night sweats), anaemia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly,
neuropathy, hyperviscosity syndrome (b p. 634), and
cryoglobulinaemia.
• Renal involvement is uncommon but is glomerular (not cast
nephropathy) when it occurs (microscopic haematuria, proteinuria,
i SCr). Histologically: GN with intracapillary thrombi and
deposits from IgM aggregation. These stain for μ and κ chains.
Cryoglobulinaemic features, MCGN, and amyloid may also be seen.
• Diagnosis rests on ﬁnding a monoclonal IgM protein and >10%
lymphoplasmacytic cell inﬁltration of bone marrow.
• Treatment: plasma exchange for hyperviscosity, rituximab, alkylating
agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil), purine analogues (e.g.
ﬂudarabine), and stem cell transplantation are all possibilities.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Sickle cell nephropathy
Introduction
Renal involvement occurs in 760% of patients with sickle cell disease
(HbSS) at some point during their life, although only 10–15% of these
patients will develop ESRD. These ﬁgures are halved in individuals with the
HbSC form of the disease. Heterozygous patients (HbSA) may develop
tubular defects later in life, although they do not appear to be at a greater
risk of developing CKD.

Pathophysiology
The relatively hypoxic and hyperosmolar environment of the inner
medulla promotes polymerization of deoxygenated haemoglobin S and
subsequent sickling of erythrocytes. This results in impaired renal medullary blood ﬂow, microinfarcts, and papillary necrosis. Alongside this, persistent anaemia and high cardiac output lead to glomerular hypertrophy
and hyperﬁltration. Over time, the ﬁne network of vasa recta is destroyed;
the enlarged glomeruli become sclerosed, and CKD ensues.

Clinical presentation (and underlying cause)
• Polyuria and nocturia:
• Hyperﬁltration and poor medullary perfusion l hyposthenuria
(inability to concentrate urine under water-deprived conditions).
This is reversible (with blood transfusions) until age 10 but
becomes irreversible in later life, causing polyuria and dehydration.
• Metabolic abnormalities:
• SCN patients often have a partial form of distal RTA and a primary
defect in the tubular secretion of K+, resulting in a hyperchloraemic
metabolic acidosis and i K+.
• In contrast, proximal tubular function appears to be supranormal,
associated with i PO4 and B2 microglobulin reabsorption and i
uric acid and creatinine secretion.
• Proteinuria:
• In the majority of patients, prolonged hyperﬁltration leads to
microalbuminuria, progressing to overt proteinuria over time.
• Although proteinuria is rare in individuals with HbSS disease aged
<20, 760% aged >40 have an elevated uACR or uPCR.
• CKD:
• GFR begins to fall from the 3rd decade onwards, leading to CKD in
a signiﬁcant number of patients (ESRD in 75–10%).
• Haematuria and renal colic:
• Medullary infarction and papillary necrosis can cause visible haematuria.
This is usually self-limiting but can be painful and persistent.
• Hypertension:
• Uncommon in most patients with SCD (presumably the result of
persistent vasodilation and dehydration).
• However, in patients with SCN and CKD, i BP is more prevalent
and may contribute to a rapid decline in renal function.
• AKI:
• Occurs in 710% of those hospitalized with crises.

SICKLE CELL NEPHROPATHY

Renal medullary carcinoma
This aggressive malignancy is extremely rare but is found exclusively in
patients with sickle cell disease or, more commonly, sickle cell trait. It
can occur at any age from childhood onwards and presents with loin
pain, haematuria, and weight loss. Although patients are treated with
surgery and chemotherapy, these are essentially palliative, as the disease
is usually metastatic at presentation and fatal within a year.

Investigations
Although SCN is relatively common in patients with SCD, it is not the
only cause of haematuria, proteinuria, or CKD in these patients. Other
conditions, such as lupus nephritis, HIVAN, or hepatitis B- or C–associated
nephropathy, need to be excluded.
• Routine, outpatient investigations: U&Es, SCr, urinalysis and uACR/uPCR,
FBC, reticulocytes, LFTs.
• New-onset haematuria: renal tract USS, urine cytology; and consider
CT-IVU. Cystoscopy may be necessary in older patients as in the
general population (b p. 67).
• Heavy proteinuria or new-onset nephrotic syndrome: immunological
and serological screen (b p. 40). Parvovirus serology (may cause
nephrotic syndrome after the acute infection). Renal biopsy may be
necessary (particularly if rapid onset).

Management
There is no speciﬁc management for SCN, so treatment can be divided
into the management of SCD and the management of proteinuric CKD.
• SCD. Many of the complications of SCD, such as frequent crisis and
severe anaemia, can be improved with regular hydroxycarbamide (HC)
(also known as hydroxyurea). There is limited evidence from studies
in children that early signs of SCN can be improved with HC therapy.
Similarly, regular transfusion (9 exchange transfusion) can help mitigate
many complications of the disease, although evidence for impact on
renal disease is lacking. Bone marrow transplantation in childhood will
cure SCD but carries signiﬁcant risks (not currently widely available).
• CKD. Patients with proteinuria (uACR >50mg/mmol) should be treated
with an ACE-I or ARB. Start at low dose because of the risks of
i K+ and d BP in this group. When taken at night, these drugs often
also reduce nocturia. EPO can improve Hb and reduce transfusion
requirement in some patients (target Hb 80–100g/L), although high
doses are often necessary. Heavy, visible haematuria should be
treated with analgesia and IV hydration. It is usually self-limiting, but
embolization may be considered for persistent, heavy bleeding.
Dialysis and transplantation should be considered for all patients with
ESRD. There appears to be a survival disadvantage on dialysis for sickle
patients (when age-matched to non-sickle patients). USRDS data show
comparable graft function at 1 year but reduced patient survival (760% at
3 years). Recurrent transfusions may lead to sensitization with anti-HLA
antibodies. Recurrent disease is common but usually mild.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

The kidney in systemic vasculitis
Introduction
The term ‘vasculitis’ reﬂects the underlying process: inﬂammation and
leucocyte inﬁltration of blood vessel walls. This may lead to local inﬂammation (e.g. purpura), vessel wall damage (l aneurysm formation or
haemorrhage), or vessel occlusion (l ischaemia and infarction).
It is an autoimmune condition, but the precise causes are unclear. Both
genetic (e.g. association with A1-antitrypsin deﬁciency and certain tyrosine
phosphatase polymorphisms) and environmental factors (nasal S. aureus
carriage, silica exposure, and certain drugs, e.g. propylthiouracil) appear
important.
The systemic vasculitides are classiﬁed as small, medium, and/or vessel,
according to the size of the smallest vessel affected (see Fig. 8.3). The
forms that most commonly involve the kidneys are discussed here (or
elsewhere as indicated).

Vasculitis: classiﬁed according to the smallest
vessel involved
• Large vessel:
• Takayasu’s arteritis affects the thoracic aorta and its branches,
presenting with i BP, pulse deﬁcits, and ischaemic limbs or
viscera (brain, heart, lungs, gut).
• Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) presents in older patients
with headache, jaw claudication, visual symptoms, and myalgia.
• Medium vessel:
• Polyarteritis nodosa (b p. 652).
• Kawasaki disease affects children, presenting as a febrile illness
with lymphadenopathy, skin rash, conjunctivitis, and mucositis
(lips, tongue).
• Small vessel:
• Without immune complex deposition:
• ANCA-associated vasculitis (b p. 640).
• Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg–Strauss).
• With immune complex deposition:
• Henoch–Schönlein purpura (b p. 650).
• Cryoglobulinaemia (b p. 634).
• Cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis.
• Other forms of vasculitis may be associated with autoimmune
diseases, such as SLE, RA, Sjögren’s, and Behçet’s.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

ANCA-associated vasculitis
Introduction
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis
includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA—previously known
as Wegener’s granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and
renal-limited vasculitis (RLV).
GPA is differentiated pathologically by the presence of granulomatous
inﬂammation, but this may not always be apparent if a biopsy for histological examination is not undertaken. Clinical surrogates that point towards
GPA, rather than MPA, include upper airways symptoms or lower respiratory tract nodules and cavitation.

Classiﬁcation
Two classiﬁcation systems are used: (i) the Chapel Hill Consensus
Conference (CHCC) criteria, and (ii) The European Medicines Agency
(EMA) algorithm. Neither is perfect. The categorization of patients
remains imprecise (and often clinically unnecessary). It has been suggested
that a more simple classiﬁcation, based on anti-PR3 or anti-MPO positivity,
may be more expedient (see ANCA, b p. 642).

Does discriminating GPA from MPA matter?
Perhaps not—treatment is similar, and the clinical and serological presentations overlap, often enough to suggest that they may represent a
disease spectrum, rather than distinct entities (see Table 8.4). In the
relevant literature, many studies group them together as a small vessel
vasculitis.

Incidence
The incidence of MPA/GPA/RLV is 10–20 pmp per year (in Europe). This
increases with age (peak age 65–74). It is rare in childhood. More common
in Caucasians. Slightly more common in ♂ vs ♀.

Prognosis
Without treatment, mortality is 780%. However, this prognosis was dramatically improved by treatment with cyclophosphamide and steroids.
Even so, 1- and 5-year survival (in patients with renal involvement) remain
785% and 775%, respectively—in part, s to considerable treatment-related
morbidity ( death in the ﬁrst year is 3x more likely to be s to treatment

ANCA-ASSOCIATED VASCULITIS

than the disease itself on traditional regimens. In addition, >40% of morbidity is related to therapy).
• Poor prognostic indicators: older age, pulmonary haemorrhage, and
severe renal disease.
• Poor renal prognostic indicators: severe disease at presentation, age
>65 years, resistance to cyclophosphamide therapy, and ﬁbrotic
changes on renal biopsy.  ESRD will result in up to 25%.

Clinical presentation
2 Extremely variable and the early stages of the disease often missed.
• Systemic symptoms are common: fever, weight loss, malaise, myalgia,
and polyarthralgia.
• Other systems or organs that can be affected include:
• Upper respiratory tract (780% GPA, uncommon MPA): nasal discharge,
epistaxis, sinusitis, oral or nasal ulcers, otitis media, deafness,
cartilaginous involvement (collapse of nasal bridge and subglottic
stenosis).
• Lung (770% GPA, 730% MPA): capillaritis, causing pulmonary
haemorrhage (may present as frank haemoptysis but can be incipient),
2 Pulmonary haemorrhage is exacerbated by even mild pulmonary
oedema, so any degree of ﬂuid overload should be avoided. Also lung
nodules and cavities, pleuritis, and pleural effusions.
• Kidney (780% GPA, 790% MPA): scenarios include:
• Microscopic haematuria or haematoproteinuria with a normal
GFR. Proteinuria is usually subnephrotic range. i BP (730%).
• Grumbling deterioration in GFR.
• Fulminant AKI.
• Patients with renal-limited vasculitis may develop additional
organ involvement at a later stage.
• Skin: vasculitic rash, palpable purpura, ulceration.
• Nervous system: mononeuritis multiplex, peripheral neuropathy.
• Eyes: conjunctivitis, episcleritis, uveitis, retro-orbital mass.
• Gut: abdominal pain, haemorrhagic ulceration, bloody diarrhoea.
• Cardiac: pericarditis, coronary vasculitis.
• Circulation: venous thromboses are more common.

Birmingham vasculitis activity score (BVAS)
This is a validated clinical tool that quantiﬁes disease activity in systemic
vasculitis. It has been adopted internationally and is now a staple in clinical vasculitis trials.
The BVAS form is divided into nine sections. Eight are organ-based,
each including symptoms and signs typical for involvement of that particular organ in vasculitis, e.g. haematuria, proteinuria, and different categories
of SCr in the renal section. The ninth section is for systemic symptoms.
The clinician only scores features they consider to be the result of active
vasculitis. Completion of the form provides a numerical score (0–68) that
can be used to assess disease severity and response to treatment.
Online BVAS calculators are available, although some training prior to
their use is desirable.

642

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

ANCA-associated vasculitis: investigations
ANCA
• During testing for ANCA, the patient’s serum is tested for IgG binding
to ethanol-ﬁxed neutrophils.
• Binding occurs in either:
• A cytoplasmic pattern (c-ANCA) (antibody usually conﬁrmed as
anti-proteinase 3).
• A perinuclear pattern (p-ANCA) (antibody usually conﬁrmed as
anti-myeloperoxidase).
• In fact, both PR3 and MPO are found in the same intracellular granules,
so these staining patterns are actually useful artefacts of ethanol
ﬁxation.
• Positive ANCA staining is then followed by speciﬁc assays for IgG
binding to MPO or PR3 antigens (via ELISA or bead assay).
•  ANCA may also be positive in other inﬂammatory and infective
diseases, so always interpret in clinical context.
• This is particularly true of p-ANCA.
• Anti-MPO and anti-PR3 assays are usually negative or low titre
(other neutrophil antigens, e.g. lactoferrin or cathepsin, are the
source of binding).
• Inﬂammatory: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, inﬂammatory bowel
disease, interstitial lung diseases, autoimmune liver disease.
• Infective: HIV, TB, infective endocarditis.
• 710–15% of patients with clinical and/or histological evidence of GPA/
MPA/RLV are ANCA-negative at presentation (although some will
become positive over time).
• The positive predictive value of a positive ANCA is dependent on the
clinical situation:
• GPA: ANCA-positive in 80–90% (775% c-ANCA or anti-PR3).
• MPA: ANCA-positive in 80–90% (770% p-ANCA or anti-MPO).

Other investigations
• 2 Urinalysis for haematuria (microscopic haematuria almost universal)
and proteinuria, microscopy for red cells and red cell casts, uPCR.
• FBC (anaemia common, thrombocytosis, leucocytosis), SCr, U&E,
LFTs, CRP (often raised). Consider blood cultures.
• ABGs if suspected lung involvement.
• Other autoimmune serology:
• Anti-GBM: ‘double positive’ ANCA and anti-GBM disease is well
recognized and behaves like anti-GBM disease (b p. 656).
• Anti-dsDNA, ENAs, C3, C4, rheumatoid factor to help exclude
alternative diagnoses (b p. 40).
• Imaging:
• Renal USS for renal sizes and to exclude obstruction.
• CXR or CT may show patchy or diffuse alveolar shadowing. This
could represent infection, pulmonary oedema, or pulmonary
haemorrhage. Nodules, cavitation, pleural involvement, and
reticulonodular shadowing may also be present in GPA.
• Transfer factor may be raised in pulmonary haemorrhage.

ANCA-ASSOCIATED VASCULITIS: INVESTIGATIONS

• Bronchoscopy may be desirable if pulmonary haemorrhage suspected
but no deﬁnite haemoptysis. Bronchoalveolar lavage may reveal frank
blood or haemosiderin-laden macrophages.
• Renal biopsy is usually indicated. However, a positive anti-MPO or
anti-PR3, in the context of rapidly progressive AKI, may mandate the
immediate commencement of treatment prior to histological diagnosis.

Renal histology
A focal and segmental necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis is characteristic (see Fig. 8.4). If small vessels, e.g. interlobular arteries, are sampled,
they may show inﬂammation and necrosis. Associated interstitial inﬂammation is often present. Immunostaining reveals no, or very few, immune
complex or complement deposits, 6 referred to as ‘pauci-immune’.
Granulomatous inﬂammation is not present in the kidney in GPA (but
often found in the upper airways and other tissues).
Chronicity, particularly the degree of irreversible glomerulosclerosis
and tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis, will offer useful prognostic information. This
may help to guide therapy. For example, aggressive and sustained induction therapy is not warranted in a patient with principally kidney limited
disease where a biopsy has suggested that renal recovery is improbable.

ANCA and pathogenesis
There is now a large literature conﬁrming that ANCA can activate neutrophils in vitro, leading to: (i) tethering and migration across endothelium; (ii) degranulation l proinﬂammatory cytokines l recruitment of
monocytes and macrophages; (iii) augmentation of inﬂammation and
endothelial cell injury through free radical generation.
This suggests that ANCAs are not an epiphenomenon (providing a
useful clinical test), but that they contribute to pathogenesis. In vivo conﬁrmation of this has been obtained with the demonstration of anti-MPO
antibodies causing focal necrotizing crescentic GN following injection
into mice. In addition, neonatal disease following placental transfer of
anti-MPO antibodies has been described.
It is likely that T cells speciﬁc for MPO and PR3 also contribute.
Unanswered questions include: (i) how antibodies to MPO or PR3 arise;
and (ii) how tolerance to self-antigens is broken. Transient induction
of anti-PR3 antibodies has been shown during infection, and a possible
infective association has been reinforced by the link between GPA and
persistent S. aureus nasal carriage.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

ANCA-associated vasculitis: treatment
Both the disease and toxicity of therapy are associated with signiﬁcant
morbidity and mortality. Risk vs beneﬁt should be assessed in each individual case and discussed with the patient. There has been a recent expansion in the literature regarding treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis
(see Table 8.5).
For a full discussion on starting immunosuppression, particularly the
necessary monitoring and preventative and protective measures (e.g. bone
protection and PJP prophylaxis) that must be undertaken, see b p. 540.

Induction therapy (to achieve remission)
Corticosteroids: high-dose oral steroids (usually starting at around 1mg/kg
prednisolone but rarely exceeding 60mg). Tapering regimens vary in different centres; possible regimens are shown in Table 8.5.

Cyclophosphamide: in addition to steroids. Daily oral therapy or intravenous or oral pulsed therapy. Pulsed therapy is as effective at inducing
remission but may be associated with a higher risk of relapse. Switch to
maintenance therapy between 3 and 6 months when remission achieved
(minimum 3 months’ therapy recommended).
• Oral: 1.5–2mg/kg/day (1.5mg/kg if age >60) to a maximum of 200mg
(round the dose to the nearest 25mg).
• Intravenous. Possible regimens:
• Ten pulses (15mg/kg) over 25 weeks, with age and GFR
adjustments, or
• 0.75g/m2 every 3–4 weeks (initial dose to 0.5g/m2 if age >60 years
or GFR <20mL/min/1.73m2).
• Doses are adjusted accordingly to maintain 2-week nadir leucocyte
count >3,000/mm3.
Rituximab: provides an alternative to cyclophosphamide and has been
shown to be as effective at inducing remission. Adverse events (perhaps
surprisingly) appear comparable. The risk of relapse is yet to be clearly
deﬁned. It has the attraction of not affecting fertility. Note: much more
expensive. Dose: 375mg/m2 weekly x 4.

ANCA-ASSOCIATED VASCULITIS: TREATMENT

Additional therapy for severe disease
• Severe disease may be deﬁned (arbitrarily) as rapidly i SCr, SCr
>500μmol/L (or dialysis-dependent), or pulmonary haemorrhage.
• X Pulsed methylprednisolone:
• Three doses of 0.5–1g IV over 3 days given initially.
• No direct evidence of beneﬁt and may increase complications.
• The MEPEX trial suggested that plasma exchange is more effective
than pulsed corticosteroids in severe disease (increased survival
at 3 months, increased independent renal function at 3 months,
less ESRD at 1 year), but the additive effect of both treatments is
not known.
• Plasma exchange:
• Indications: severe disease or coexisting anti-GBM antibodies.
• MEPEX regimen: seven exchanges (60mL/kg) over 14 days with
5% albumin. FFP or Octaplas® may be needed at the end of the
exchange if there has been a recent renal biopsy or there is
pulmonary haemorrhage (b p. 72).
• Ongoing PEXIVAS study should deﬁne dosing/duration further.

Resistant disease
• Failure to induce remission occurs in 710%.
• Therapeutic options: add rituximab to steroids and
cyclophosphamide (or cyclophosphamide to steroids and rituximab).
Commence plasma exchange. Consider IVIg (0.5mg/kg/day).
Polyclonal ATG or alemtuzumab (Campath®) have been used but
lack an evidence base.

Maintenance therapy (to maintain remission)
• Induction therapy usually moves to maintenance between 3–6 months.
• Low-dose prednisolone (see Table 8.5).
• Convert cyclophosphamide to azathioprine 1.5mg/kg/day (max 200mg).
• MMF 1g bd is an alternative in patients intolerant of azathioprine
(but is associated with higher rates of relapse). It is not yet known
whether MMF offers an alternative for induction therapy (MYCYC
trial ongoing).
• The role of rituximab in maintenance therapy is not yet deﬁned.
• Methotrexate may also be used but has a higher relapse rate and is
generally not favoured for patients with renal or lung disease.
• Co-trimoxazole may reduce upper respiratory tract relapses in GPA
and is used, in addition to standard immunosuppression.
• Most clinicians continue maintenance therapy for at least 2 years, often
longer in GPA, but the optimal duration is unknown. The risks and
beneﬁts of ongoing treatment will depend on the individual clinical
scenario and should be discussed with the patient.
• 2 Maintenance therapy is not recommend in patients who are
dialysis-dependent and have no extrarenal disease manifestations.
Relapse rates are lower in patients with ESRD on dialysis ( but
infection rates are higher).

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

ANCA-associated vasculitis: monitoring
response and predicting relapse
See Table 8.6 for recent trials.
Successful achievement and maintenance of remission may be monitored by:
• Clinical assessment: see Clinical presentation in ANCA-associated
vasculitis (b p. 641), but note that patients may not just have a
recurrence of previous features—they may develop new ones.
• Changes in BVAS score (b p. 641).
• Presence/absence of urinary abnormalities: particularly haematuria
(note: persistent proteinuria may not indicate persistent disease, rather
irreversible glomerular damage).
• CRP: useful but non-speciﬁc. Poses a common clinical dilemma when
raised; does it represent relapse or infection?  Both must be taken
seriously.
• Stable or improving renal function.
• ANCA and anti-MPO or anti-PR3 levels.
• X Rising anti-MPO or anti-PR3 level may predict relapse, but this
has not been consistent in all studies.
• There is currently no role for presumptively increasing
immunosuppression in the absence of a change in clinical disease
activity (although rising titres will usually mandate an increase in
surveillance intensity).
See Fig. 8.4 for renal biopsy.

Treating relapse
• Severe relapses should be treated, as per induction therapy. However,
any decision to re-institute cyclophosphamide should be based, at least
in part, on the cumulative dose to date, as there is evidence of a higher
malignancy risk for cumulative doses over 36g. The preservation of
fertility may also be a prime concern. Rituximab may be preferred in
this situation.
• Less severe relapses require careful clinical judgement. Most clinicians
will opt to avoid repeat cyclophosphamide therapy where possible. If
relapse has occurred off maintenance therapy, then the re-institution
of steroids and azathioprine (or MMF) may be sufﬁcient.

ANCA-ASSOCIATED VASCULITIS

Renal replacement therapy
Standard AKI indications for IHD or CRRT apply during the treatment
of vasculitis (b p. 172). The development of irreversible ESRD will
inﬂuence treatment choices (see Treating relapse, b p. 646).
Transplantation: it is generally recommended that patients wait for
6–12 months post-remission prior to transplantation. Ongoing ANCA
positivity per se is not signiﬁcantly associated with reduced graft survival.
Recurrent disease can be expected in 15–20% but causes graft loss in a
minority. A recent series of 7100 patients suggested 70% graft survival at
10 years. Rejection rates are similar to the general transplant population,
but there is an increased infection risk, presumably reﬂecting cumulative
immune suppression.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Henoch–Schönlein purpura
Introduction
• Small vessel systemic vasculitis predominantly affecting children (20 per
100,000 population in the UK).
• Peak incidence age 4–5 (range generally 2–11).
• 2:1 ♂:♀ ratio. Caucasian > black patients.
• More common in winter and early spring—associated with an upper
respiratory tract infection (with accompanying fever and malaise)
in 72/3.
• IgA plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HSP (l circulating IgA
containing immune complexes, IgA deposition in vessel walls and renal
mesangium). These abnormalities are associated with IgA1, not IgA2.
• IgA complexes and complement deposit in target organs l release of
inﬂammatory mediators.
• Serum IgA elevated in 750%. A small number are ANCA-positive.

Clinical presentation
• Presents as a tetrad of skin rash, abdominal pain, arthralgia, and renal
involvement.
• Rash: skin manifestations usually dominate the clinical picture.
Purpuric (usually symmetrical) rash, affecting legs, buttocks
(and, less frequently, arms). Abdomen, chest, and face are
typically spared. New lesions may develop over several months.
Histology: leucocytoclastic vasculitis with vascular IgA and C3
deposition. Urticaria may also occur.
• Abdominal: GI manifestations in 73/4 patients. Nausea, vomiting,
diarrhoea (may be bloody), colicky pain (which may be severe), GI
bleeding, ileus, infarction, perforation, intussusception, pancreatitis,
cholecystitis.
• Arthralgia: joint manifestations in 72/3 patients. Usually symmetrical
polyarthralgia, mainly involving knees and ankles, wrists and ﬁngers
less common. True arthritis and permanent damage extremely rare.
• Renal involvement: focal and segmental mesangial proliferative GN
presenting as haematuria, proteinuria (which can be nephrotic
range) 9 renal impairment and i BP. A renal biopsy is usually
reserved for nephritic/nephrotic presentations, renal impairment,
and persistent or heavy proteinuria. The severity of renal sequelae
is often not related to the severity of other manifestations
• Other: pulmonary haemorrhage, cerebral vasculitis (l headache,
irritability, seizures, focal weakness, altered mental state),
neuropathies, and orchitis.

Prognosis
• Usually self-limiting (usually <1 month; rarely >2 months).
• Follow-up is recommended.
• Isolated microscopic (and intermittent macroscopic) haematuria
may persist, but the prognosis is good in this situation.
• i BP is also probably more common.
• The presence of proteinuria is an adverse prognostic sign.

HENOCH–SCHÖNLEIN PURPURA

• Nephritic and mixed nephritic/nephrotic presentations have the
worse prognosis (71/3 will progress to ESRD).
• Estimated as the cause of ESRD in 71.5–3% children overall.
• In adults, renal involvement is more common. Complete resolution is
the norm, but persistent urinary abnormalities ( proteinuria) predict
a worse prognosis and mandate follow-up.
• Recurrence in 71/3 cases, particularly if renal involvement (usually
within 6 months).

Treatment
• Usually symptomatic only, e.g. analgesia for arthralgia.
• Severe skin or GI manifestations may require corticosteroids.
• Nephritis (X no strong evidence base):
• Steroid treatment does not prevent renal involvement.
• Heavy proteinuria, impaired renal function, and crescents on renal
biopsy often precipitate steroid treatment, e.g. 3x doses of IV
methylprednisolone, followed by 4 weeks of PO prednisolone.
If the response is favourable, they are continued and weaned
over 76 months. Some advocate the use of cyclophosphamide in
this group.
• RPGN with >50% crescentic change is often treated as per other
causes of systemic vasculitis (e.g. steroids, cyclophosphamide, and
plasma exchange).
• ACE-I for persistent proteinuria.

HSP and IgAN: similar but (probably) not the same
Whether HSP and IgA nephropathy are different faces of the same
clinicopathological entity remains a matter for debate.
• Similarities:
• The extrarenal manifestations of both are similar.
• IgAN can occur in patients with a history of HSP and the two
have occurred in the same family.
• Patients with HSP who subsequently receive a kidney transplant
may develop IgA deposits in the graft.
• Similar changes in the IgA system, e.g. aberrant glycosylation of
circulating IgA, can be demonstrated in both.
• Differences:
• Age of onset is much younger in HSP.
• Extrarenal manifestations, especially cutaneous, are much more
common in HSP.
• Glomerular, particularly mesangial, sclerosis is more common in
IgAN, while endothelial proliferation is more common in HSP.
• On EM, deposits are mostly limited to the mesangium in IgAN
but more widely distributed in HSP.
• IgA deposits may be relatively weak in HSP, compared to IgAN.
• IgG immune deposits are found more commonly in HSP.
• Persistent haematuria, proteinuria, and CKD are more common
in IgAN.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Polyarteritis nodosa
Introduction
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare (<10 PMP) medium-vessel necrotizing
transmural arteritis, involving principally the skin, nerves, gut, and kidney.
Most cases are idiopathic, but 730% may be secondary (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, SLE, RA, Sjögren’s, hairy cell leukaemia). Onset is usually age 40–60.

Symptoms and signs
Usually presents with systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, arthralgia,
and myalgia). Skin disease includes nodules, livedo reticularis, or purpura (indicating small vessel involvement). Medium vessel involvement in
the gut presents as abdominal pain (often postprandial), perforation, or
bloody stool. Other features include testicular pain (epididymo-orchitis),
mononeuritis multiplex (peripheral neuropathy), stroke, and myocardial
ischaemia.
Renal ischaemia causes i BP 9 renal impairment. There may be loin pain
from segmental renal infarcts. Unlike the ANCA-associated vasculitides,
glomerular disease is not a feature of PAN.

Investigations
Urinalysis
Inactive—generally no microscopic haematuria (as no glomerular inﬂammation), although proteinuria may be present (i BP). An exception might be
the haematuria (often visible) that occurs with renal infarction with PAN).
Routine laboratory tests
FBC, biochemistry proﬁle with muscle enzymes. CRP is usually raised and
may be used to monitor disease.
Tests to exclude an underlying cause or alternative diagnosis
Hepatitis B and C serology, C3, C4, RhF, ENAs, anti-dsDNA, cryoglobulins, blood cultures (exclude infection).
2 PAN is not associated with ANCA.
Diagnostic tests
Diagnosis is made, following tissue biopsy or angiography. The classical
ﬁnding is of microaneurysms or beading, with vascular occlusion in the
renal or mesenteric vascular tree (see Fig. 8.5). Renal biopsy may show
segmental transmural ﬁbrinoid necrosis in medium-sized arteries 9 downstream ischaemic changes or frank infarction.

Management and natural history
• The prognosis of untreated disease is extremely poor.
• Treat underlying cause in secondary disease.
• In primary PAN, mild disease is generally treated with
corticosteroids alone.
• Moderate to severe disease is treated with corticosteroids and
cyclophosphamide for at least 3–6 months, followed by azathioprine in
a similar manner to ANCA-associated vasculitis.
• Relapses are infrequent.

with permission from Wu K and Throssell D (2006) Nephrol Dial Transplant,
21(6): 1710–12.

Takayasu’s disease
• Chronic inﬂammatory condition associated with granulomatous
arteritis, intimal proliferation, and medial and adventitial ﬁbrosis
(l arterial occlusion, post-stenotic dilatation, and frank aneurysm
formation). Atherosclerosis supervenes as patients age.
• Affects large vessels—principally the aorta (and branches) and
pulmonary vessels. Aetiology unknown.
• Most common in young ♀. Relatively common in Asia (esp. Japan).
Rare in Caucasians (<3 pmp).
• Classically described as a triphasic disease: (i) ‘pre-pulseless’ phase
with systemic symptoms; (ii) a vascular inﬂammatory phase; and
(iii) a quiescent occlusive phase.
• Presentation: systemic symptoms (weight loss, fatigue, fever),
claudication, angina, CVA, vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency, steal syndromes,
aneurysms, asymmetrical BP in limbs, bruits, aortic incompetence (if
ascending aorta involved). 750% develop renovasular i BP.
• Investigations: acute phase response (i CRP, ESR) and normochromic
anaemia. Autoantibodies, including ANCA, are negative.
• Angiography is diagnostic (MR angiography and PET scanning may
identify areas of active inﬂammation).
• Treatment: steroids are the mainstay, but many patients relapse as
they are tapered. Evidence base for ‘steroid-sparing’ agents is poor.
Methotrexate, azathioprine, and anti-TNF therapy have been used.
• Revascularization is often necessary. Relatively poor results from
angioplasty (reocclusion) and stenting (restenosis). Surgery may be
necessary (but high incidence of graft restenosis).

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Churg–Strauss syndrome
Introduction
Now referred to as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).
This is an ANCA-associated vasculitis (50% positive), but patients are generally younger patients than MPA/GPA/RLV (mean age 40). ♂ = ♀.
Characterized classically by rhinitis, asthma, and eosinophilia and primarily affects the lung and skin. However, it may affect any organ. The incidence
of renal involvement in EGPA is difﬁcult to estimate (probably 730%).

Symptoms and signs
Disease typically evolves in stages (with some overlap):
• Atopic prodrome:
• 2nd/3rd decade.
• Allergic rhinitis or other atopic conditions.
• Asthma (often severe/steroid-requiring).
• Eosinophilic stage:
• Peripheral eosinophilia (>1.5 x 109/L).
• Eosinophilic inﬁltration of organs (esp. lung and gut).
• Vasculitic stage:
• 3rd/4th decade.
• Severe systemic vasculitis/extravascular granulomatosis.
• Presents as fever, malaise, weight loss.
• Widespread organ involvement includes:
− Lungs: i severity of asthma, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, pulmonary
opacities/nodules, pleural effusions.
− Kidneys (730%): 50% with rapidly progressive AKI, 50% with
isolated proteinuria/haematuria. i BP is common (presumably
renal ischaemia).
− Gut: eosinophilic gastroenteritis, ischaemic bowel, abdominal
pain, bloody diarrhoea.
− Skin: tender subcutaneous nodules, palpable purpura, urticaria.
− ENT: nasal obstruction, polyps, otitis media, hearing loss.
− Cardiac: coronary vasculitis (angina), myocarditis (LVF), or
pericarditis ( tamponade).
− Neuro: mononeuritis multiplex, painful polyneuropathy.
− Musculoskeletal: myalgia, migratory polyarthritis.
− Lymphadenopathy: eosinophilic LN seen in 30–40%.

Investigations
• Urinalysis, (microscopic haematuria, proteinuria), microscopy for red
cells and red cell casts, uPCR.
• FBC (d Hb) and prominent eosinophilia (often >10% total WCC, or
absolute count >1.5 x 109/L).
• i ESR,ui CRP, immunoglobulins (i IgE—common and may vary with
disease activity, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia). U&E, Alb,
LFT, CK.
• ANCA (usually anti-MPO) positive in 750% (particularly during
vasculitis phase). RhF often positive at low titre.

CHURG–STRAUSS SYNDROME

• CXR (ﬂitting, patchy inﬁltration) 9 ABG.
• ECG, echo (consider cardiac MR with gadolinium if either abnormal).
• Lung—transfer factor, HRCT, PFT (obstructive picture with d lung
volume), BAL/lung biopsy.
• Tissue biopsy classically shows eosinophil-rich granulomatous
inﬂammation. If sampled, vessels show a small to medium vessel
necrotizing vasculitis.
• Renal biopsy may show vasculitis 9 focal and segmental necrotizing
GN though usually with an eosinophilic inﬁltrate and granuloma
formation throughout the interstitium. A large series of 7115 patients
(all ANCA-positive) showed >50% had necrotizing GN on biopsy.

Diagnostic criteria
Lanham criteria (three criteria) vs American College of Rheumatology
criteria (six criteria) from:
• Asthma.
• >10% eosinophils.
• Mono-/polyneuropathy.
• Migratory/transient CXR opacities.
• Paranasal sinus abnormalities.
• Biopsy containing a blood vessel, with eosinophils in
extravascular areas.

Treatment
Assess for severity using the ﬁve factor score (FFS): (1) cardiac involvement; (2) SCr >141μmol/L (1.6mg/dL); (3) proteinuria >1g/day; (4) GI
disease; (5) CNS involvement. Score 0 (no factors), 1 (1 factor), or 2 (2+
factors).
• Prednisolone: PO 1mg/kg/day for 6–12 weeks (or until remission
(consider initial pulsed IV if multi-organ involvement). Treat asthma
and i BP with standard therapy. >90% remission with steroids alone
if FFS score 0. Eosinophilia is exquisitely steroid-sensitive and may
resolve rapidly on treatment.
• Cyclophosphamide: PO or IV for 3–6 months, followed by maintenance
therapy similar to ANCA-associated vasculitis (b p. 640). Use for
refractory disease or if FFS 2+, FFS 1 plus cardiac involvement, or FFS
0 but ANCA-positive.
• Other: azathioprine and methotrexate (not if GFR <50mL/min) have
been used to maintain of remission. Limited data for MMF, rituximab,
and others. Plasma exchange appears to confer no additional beneﬁt.
Monitor for relapse using clinical symptoms, eosinophil count, and acute
phase reactants (ESR, CRP). ANCA positivity does not predict disease
activity. Relapse can be expected in 725% of cases. Survival is 70% at
5 years. Most deaths occur during the vasculitic phase.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Anti-GBM (Goodpasture’s) disease
Introduction
A rare disease (<1 pmp) that presents as RPGN 9 pulmonary haemorrhage. Occurs in older children and adults of all ages but with peaks at age
20–30 and 60–70. More common in Caucasians. ♂ > ♀ (slightly).

Pathogenesis
Caused by antibodies (usually IgG) against two adjacent regions in the NC1
domain of the A3 chain of type IV collagen (‘Goodpasture’s epitopes’).
This A3 chain is limited to the BM of the glomerulus and alveolus (also
choroid plexus, testis, and cochlear—although clinically irrelevant). The
epitopes are usually structurally sequestered and 6 protected but become
more accessible in the disease.
It is now recognized that cell-mediated immunity is also important, with
strong evidence from animal models and clinical studies that T cells reactive with type IV collagen contribute to inﬂammatory responses.
Genetic (e.g. HLA DR15, particularly the DRB1*1501 allele) and environmental (e.g. hydrocarbon exposure) factors inﬂuence susceptibility.
Others risk factors include smoking and membranous GN (anti-GBM
disease can occur before, during, or after this GN). Such factors appear
to damage either the glomerular or alveolar BM l epitope exposure and
autoimmune responses. There is no strong association with infection.

Symptoms and signs
• Usually presents acutely with rapidly progressive AKI (with haematuria
and subnephrotic proteinuria) 9 pulmonary haemorrhage (760%).
• Some patients report loin pain and haematuria during early stages.
• No renal involvement is very rare.
• Pulmonary haemorrhage may present as frank haemoptysis but is often
more incipient, e.g. cough, dyspnoea, blood-ﬂecked sputum.
• Pulmonary haemorrhage occurs almost exclusively in smokers and,
more commonly, in younger patients.
• 2 Note: pulmonary haemorrhage is exacerbated by even mild
pulmonary oedema, so ﬂuid overload must be avoided.
• Systemic symptoms, such as fever and weight loss, are usually absent
and may suggest an alternative diagnosis, such as vasculitis.

Investigations
Routine laboratory tests
• Urinalysis for blood and protein, uPCR (proteinuria usually
non-nephrotic). FBC, U&E, SCr, CRP (often raised).
Autoimmune serology
• Anti-GBM antibodies: request urgently if suspected. Titres broadly
correlate with disease activity. False positives: viral infections, esp. HIV,
hep C. False negatives unusual (diagnosis then rests on biopsy).
• ANCA: important differential diagnosis, and 25% are ‘double positive’
for both anti-GBM and ANCA (usually anti-MPO). Such patients usually
behave like anti-GBM disease but may have rashes and arthralgia.

ANTI-GBM (GOODPASTURE’S) DISEASE

Imaging and investigation of pulmonary haemorrhage
• CXR 9 CT (diffuse alveolar shadowing). ABGs.
• Renal USS to measure renal sizes and exclude obstruction.
• Transfer factor (KCO) may be raised if pulmonary haemorrhage.
• Bronchoalveolar lavage: frank blood or haemosiderin-laden
macrophages.
Renal biopsy
• 2 Usually indicated but should not delay treatment if anti-GBM
positive in the appropriate clinical context.
• Histology: focal and segmental necrotizing, crescentic GN. The light
microscopic ﬁndings are similar to those in ANCA-associated vasculitis,
except that all crescents are usually at the same stage of development
(termed ‘synchronous’). Immunostaining demonstrates linear capillary
wall staining for IgG and C3 (also seen in diabetic nephropathy and
ﬁbrillary GN). EM will show frequent breaks in the GBM.
• The biopsy may also yield helpful prognostic information. Signiﬁcant
potentially reversible acute tubular injury may suggest a good chance
of recovery despite advanced renal failure.

Management
Initial treatment is similar to ANCA-associated vasculitis, although maintenance therapy is generally not necessary, as relapse is very rare (anti-GBM
is often referred to as a ‘one-hit’ disease).
For a discussion on starting and monitoring immunosuppression, see
b p. 540.
• Corticosteroids: prednisolone (1mg/kg to max 60mg/day), and taper
over 6 months, then stop (regimen will vary between centres). Initial
pulsed methylprednisolone (three doses x 0.5–1g IV) although limited
direct evidence of beneﬁt.
• Cyclophosphamide: given in combination with steroids. Usually 3 months
daily oral therapy (b p. 541). If anti-GBM remains positive, some
clinicians then favour switching to azathioprine for a further period.
• Plasma exchange: should be given to all patients. Usually daily for 2–3
weeks, but duration can be tailored to clinical response and anti-GBM
titre (aim: undetectable) (b p. 950).
Once dialysis–dependent, renal recovery is very unusual. Potentially toxic
treatment may not be warranted in this situation (unless there is pulmonary haemorrhage), but features on the renal biopsy (see ‘Investigations’)
should also inform this decision, as should potential future transplantation
(see ‘Prognosis’).

Prognosis
Almost uniformly fatal if untreated. Independent renal function in >90%
at 1 year when presenting SCr <500μmol/L (5.6 mg/dL); 82% when SCr
>500μmol/L (5.6 mg/dL), and just 8% if dialysis-dependent. Pulmonary
haemorrhage signiﬁcantly increases early mortality.
Transplantation is not recommended until anti-GBM antibodies have
been absent for 6 months. If they persist, then further treatment (e.g.
rituximab) may be contemplated.

657

658

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Lupus nephritis
Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous multisystem disease characterized by autoantibody production and a diverse range of
clinical manifestations, as outlined in Table 8.7. SLE is more common in
black patients, Hispanics, and Asians. It principally occurs in young adults
and is more common in ♀ by a factor of 710.
Lupus nephritis should form part of the differential diagnosis in any
patient presenting with an active urinary sediment 9 renal dysfunction.
The diagnosis of SLE will not already be established in many patients.
Renal disease is common in SLE, developing to some degree in 750%
of patients and usually occurring within the ﬁrst 5 years of diagnosis.
Surveillance is 6 important (and often performed by non-nephrologists).

Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of SLE is multifactorial, involving genetic, hormonal, and
environmental factors. The strong genetic element is shown by 725–50%
concordance in monozygotic twins and the fact that ≥10% of patient relatives are affected. Numerous abnormalities of the immune system have
been described, although it is not universally understood whether these
are epiphenomenon or causative.
The hallmark of SLE is the production of a range of autoantibodies, in
particular, to self-antigens that contain DNA and RNA. Factors that may
promote autoimmunity include i IFN-A, increased levels of the B cell survival factor Blys (BAFF), and stimulation of nuclei acid-binding receptors
TLR7 and TLR9. Immune complexes containing autoantibody cause tissue
injury by stimulation of leucocyte Fc receptors and complement activation. However, complement appears to play a dual role, as it can also be
protective—genetic deﬁciency of the early classical pathway components
C1q and C4 strongly predisposes to SLE, perhaps through a defect in
the clearance of apoptotic cells. Faulty apoptotic processes are a general
feature of the disease, with early autoantibody responses directed against
the nucleosome (which arises from apoptotic cells).

Common clinical manifestations
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Systemic: fever, weight loss.
Skin: malar rash, photosensitivity, alopecia.
Joints/hands: arthralgia, arthritis, Raynaud’s.
Serositis: pleural effusion, peritonitis, pericarditis.
CNS: headaches, stroke, seizures, psychosis.
Renal:i SCr, haematuria, proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome), i BP.
Haematological: anaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia.
Cardiovascular: myocarditis, pericardial effusion, sterile endocarditis,
venous and arterial thromboses (antiphospholipid syndrome).

LUPUS NEPHRITIS

Investigations
Routine laboratory tests
• Urinalysis for blood (l suggests active glomerular disease) and protein,
microscopy for red cell casts, uPCR or uACR.
• FBC, U&E, SCr, LFTs, CK, ESR (typically raised), d serum albumin (if
nephrotic).
• CRP (typically not raised unless serositis; can be a useful discriminator).
Immunological tests in patients suspected of having SLE
• ANA (>95%; sensitive but not speciﬁc) Anti-dsDNA (increased
speciﬁcity), C3 and C4 (reduced), ENAs (including anti-Ro, anti–La,
anti-Sm) (b p. 42).
• Anti-C1q antibodies have reasonable sensitivity and even better
speciﬁcity for active nephritis (particularly in combination with anti-DNA).
• ANCA (positive in a proportion; usually anti-MPO) (b p. 642).
• Anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant (b p. 664).
Radiology
Renal USS: renal sizes; exclude obstruction, and investigate possible
renal vein thrombosis (esp. if nephrotic 9 antiphospholipid syndrome)
(b p. 590).
Renal biopsy
A renal biopsy is indicated in most patients with suspected lupus nephritis.
2 Note: severe disease may be seen histologically with a ‘mild’ clinical
phenotype (e.g. normal SCr, mild proteinuria, and microscopic haematuria). Histology is crucial for planning of treatment and also yields important
prognostic information. A complex range of light microscopic ﬁndings may
be present and classiﬁed as shown in Table 8.7. In all cases, immunostaining shows a ‘full house’, i.e. it is positive for IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and C1q.
Other renal pathologies also occur in SLE, including thrombotic microangiopathy (b p. 574), AIN (b p. 580), minimal change (b p. 558), and
ischaemic nephropathy from renal artery stenosis (b p. 665).

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Lupus nephritis: initial treatment
Initial therapy
For a discussion on starting and monitoring immunosuppression, see b p. 540.
Classes I and II
Usually presents as mild renal disease, such as microscopic haematuria 9
proteinuria that does not usually warrant speciﬁc therapy.
Classes III and IV (or III + V and IV + V)
• Immunosuppression is required for these categories.
• Class III typically presents as mild to moderate renal disease, with
microscopic haematuria, moderate proteinuria, and (in a signiﬁcant
number) deteriorating renal function. Extrarenal SLE is often active
(see Fig. 8.6).
• Class IV typically presents as severe renal disease: i BP, oedema,
active urinary sediment, deteriorating renal function ( often rapid),
and nephrotic range proteinuria (extrarenal SLE is usually active).
• Class V typically presents as the nephrotic syndrome. The prognosis is
worse if class V is found in combination with class III or IV.
• In the past, large doses of pulsed IV cyclophosphamide were used in
addition to steroids (based on NIH evidence).
• More recent evidence has shown that: (ii) low-dose IV
cyclophosphamide is just as effective, and (ii) MMF is as efﬁcacious as
cyclophosphamide for most patients.
• Standard initial therapy for most with classes III and IV disease is 6
high-dose oral steroids and oral MMF. Cyclophosphamide is generally
reserved for patients who have failed initial treatment.
Corticosteroids Most centres start with a high dose of oral prednisolone
(71mg/kg, max 60mg od). Protocols for subsequent tapering will vary. See
b p. 540 for possible regimen. Pulsed IV methylprednisolone (0.5–1g IV x
3) is often given initially, although there is no direct evidence of beneﬁt—
although it may allow a lower dose of prednisolone to be used initially (e.g.
0.5mg/kg—the ‘Eurolupus protocol’).
Mycophenolate Given at a total dose of 2–3g/day and normally continued
at the maximum dose for at least 6 months. It is important to titrate the
dose to these levels, as tolerated.
Cyclophosphamide Usually reserved for patients who have failed MMF,
although some clinicians still favour as initial therapy in more fulminant
disease. Usually given as 6 x IV doses of 500mg at 2-weekly intervals.
Rituximab Reserved for patients who have not responded to MMF or
cyclophosphamide. Clinical trials in both extrarenal and renal lupus disappointing, but clinical experience suggests beneﬁt in selected patients.
Belimumab (Anti-BLyS) Clinical trials have shown beneﬁt in extrarenal
lupus. Studies in lupus nephritis are ongoing.
Class V
• The optimal therapy for pure membranous lupus nephritis is uncertain,
as most trials have included only small numbers of such patients.

LUPUS NEPHRITIS: INITIAL TREATMENT

• If renal function is normal and proteinuria subnephrotic,
immunosuppression may not be indicated initially.
• Spontaneous remission of class V disease may occur.
• Patients should be treated with ACE-I or ARBs, as for any proteinuric
renal disease.
• If nephrotic range proteinuria, most clinicians would institute similar
therapy to classes III and IV, as described previously.
• Calcineurin inhibitors are an alternative.

Additional therapy
• All patients with lupus nephritis should receive ACE-I/ARBs,
if signiﬁcant proteinuria, plus BP treatment, as needed (aim
<130/80mmHg).
• Treat complications of CKD, e.g. anaemia and SHPT ( often
neglected.
• SLE patients have high incidence of CV disease, so CV risk factors
much be given appropriate attention.
• Hydroxychloroquine (200–400mg PO od) for all patients, unless
contraindicated (demonstrably lowers disease ﬂare rates).

Fig. 8.6 Image from a renal biopsy of a patient with lupus nephritis. The
glomerulus shows segmental proliferation and is outlined by Bowman’s capsule,
which picks up the silver stain, as do the capillary loops. The left hand half of the
glomerulus shows endocapillary proliferation, and the right half is almost normal.
This biopsy would be classiﬁed as class III or class IV, depending on the percentage
of glomeruli affected (see Table 8.7).

Lupus nephritis: further treatment
Maintaining remission
There is no clear demarcation between induction and remission phases.
Evidence of an initial response to treatment, with improving renal function
and reducing proteinuria, can continue for many months. Nonetheless,
although it is somewhat arbitrary, patients are categorized after 6 months’
treatment:
• Complete remission:
• uPCR <50mg/mmol, with a normalized or stable SCr.
• Partial remission:
• uPCR improved 50% on baseline and <300mg/mmol, with a
normalized or stable SCr.
• Non-responders.
Complete remission
• If MMF has been used, the dose may be reduced, although it is
advisable to maintain a dose of around 2g/day for at least 2 years.
• Low-dose prednisolone (e.g. 5–10mg daily) is often continued.
• Azathioprine can be an alternative to MMF for remission maintenance
if the latter is not tolerated (although recent trial evidence suggests
that MMF is superior).
Partial remission or non-responders
• The clinical decision-making process in partial responders can be
challenging; options include continued observation (especially if
parameters are improving), a further renal biopsy, or an escalation in
therapy.
• Cyclophosphamide or rituximab may be considered.
Cessation of immunosuppression
There is no strong evidence to guide the decision to withdraw maintenance therapy. Case series suggest that the risk of relapse is inversely
proportional to length of prior treatment. Therapy for at least 5 years is
advisable.

Monitoring
Patients require close long-term surveillance.
Monitoring for renal disease
• Urinalysis (particularly microscopic haematuria), uPCR or uACR.
• SCr, serum albumin. If there is signiﬁcant proteinuria, serum albumin
can be a more precise marker than uPCR and uACR (providing no
other factors that depress albumin, such as infection, are present).
• Repeat renal biopsy.
Monitoring lupus serology
• Anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, ESR, anti-C1q are useful for disease activity.
• One or more may be known to be particularly useful in an individual
patient, but no single marker, or combination, has sufﬁcient sensitivity
or speciﬁcity to be used in isolation.

LUPUS NEPHRITIS: FURTHER TREATMENT

•  Some patients may have active serology but no clinical disease
activity. However, those in whom the serological markers are negative
are unlikely to have signiﬁcant activity (especially if previously positive).

Prognosis
Outcomes are variable and depend on disease severity and response to
treatment. Overall mortality 710% at 10 years for lupus nephritis (approximately double that of non-renal disease). Chronic inﬂammation, organ
damage, toxicity of therapy, and increased CV disease all contribute
to this.

Renal replacement therapy
SLE represents 71–2% of patients on an ESRD programme. Survival is
comparable to patient without SLE. Lupus is generally quiescent once
on dialysis (a state of relevant immune suppression), although extrarenal
disease ﬂares may occur and require treatment. Interestingly, the better
the quality of dialysis (e.g. longer hours), the higher the risk of relapse.
Patients are usually good candidates for transplantation. It is recommended that disease has been inactive for 3–6 months at the time of
transplantation. There is conﬂicting evidence concerning graft outcomes, with a historical suggestion that these may be poorer. However,
this is probably not the case. Recurrent disease is relatively uncommon.
Concurrent antiphospholipid antibody syndrome with graft loss from
thrombotic events may contribute to the inferior outcomes seen in
some series.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)
Introduction
Antiphospholipid antibodies may occur as a primary entity (750%) or in
association with connective tissue diseases, e.g. SLE (730–40%), Sjögren’s
(740%), RA (730%), systemic sclerosis (725%). They are also present in 75%
of the normal population.
As well as autoimmune diseases, antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with infections (e.g. HIV, hepatitis C, and syphilis) and drugs (e.g.
hydralazine, procainamide, IFN-A).
APS is deﬁned as antiphospholipid antibodies plus one or more clinical
episodes of arterial, venous, or small vessel thrombosis in any organ (conﬁrmed on imaging or histologically).
APS occurs at all ages and is more common in ♀. It is more frequent in
relatives of affected patients.

APS and fetal loss
Deﬁnition used in pregnancy is antiphospholipid antibodies plus:
• One or more spontaneous abortion (>10 weeks).
• One or more births <34 weeks, with severe pre-eclampsia,
eclampsia, or placental insufﬁciency.
• Three or more unexplained, consecutive, spontaneous abortions
<20 weeks’ gestation.

Pathogenesis
Dysregulation of coagulation l thrombosis. Exact mechanisms are unclear.
However, it appears that aberrant apoptosis may expose membrane phospholipids for binding by plasma proteins. These complexes then stimulate
autoantibody production.
Thrombosis is initiated by antibodies to coagulation factors (e.g. protein
C and S) 9 platelet and endothelial activation 9 complement activation.

Clinical features
Some patients are asymptomatic. In others, an associated disease will
dominate clinical presentation, e.g. SLE. The presentation of APS essentially reﬂects a multi-organ disorder, characterized by hypercoagulability
and recurrent thrombosis:
• Vascular: DVT, PE, pulmonary hypertension, MI, digital ischaemia.
• Obstetric: fetal loss, pre-eclampsia.
• Neurological: CVA, sinus thrombosis.
• Haematological: thrombocytopenia (730%), haemolytic anaemia.
• Skin: livedo reticularis, cutaneous infarcts, ulceration.
• Eyes: retinal vein thrombosis, amaurosis fugax.
• Other: adrenal infarction, avascular necrosis, Libmann–Sacks
endocarditis.
Catastrophic APS (CAPS) is a rare, fulminant form, with rapid multisystem
involvement and organ infarction. Mortality is high.

ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME (APS)

Renal involvement
•
•
•
•
•
•

Thrombotic microangiopathy (b p. 574).
Renal artery thrombosis and ischaemic nephropathy (b p. 586).
Hypertension (including accelerated phase).
Proteinuria.
Increased risk of vascular thrombosis post-transplantation.
Increased risk of vascular access thrombosis in haemodialysis patients.

Laboratory tests for antiphospholipid antibodies
• Elevated levels of antibodies against anionic membrane phospholipids
or their associated plasma proteins.
• Persistence is important for diagnosis of APS—one or more of the
following must to be present on at least two occasions, at least 12
weeks apart:
• IgG 9 IgM anticardiolipin antibody (IgG more commonly associated
with thrombosis). Causes false positive syphilis serology.
• Anti-B2GP-I.
• Lupus anticoagulant ( strongest risk for thrombosis).
The lupus anticoagulant (LA) is directed against various plasma coagulation molecules and results in prolongation of clotting assays, including
APTT, kaolin clotting time, and dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVT).
The presence of LA is conﬁrmed by mixing normal plasma with patient
plasma. If there is a clotting factor deﬁciency, mixing should correct the
clotting time; when it does not, it suggests an inhibitor is present.

Treatment
Tailored according to presentation and prior history of thrombotic events.
Asymptomatic individuals who are found to have antiphospholipid antibodies do not require speciﬁc treatment. However:
• Prophylactic therapy:
• Modify other risk factors: smoking, i BP, i lipid. Avoid oral
contraceptive.
• X Aspirin 75mg daily. Widely used in this context but beneﬁt
unproven. Clopidogrel is an alternative if aspirin-intolerant.
• If SLE, consider hydroxychloroquine 200–400mg daily.
• Thrombosis:
• Full anticoagulation with IV or SC heparin, followed by (lifelong)
warfarin therapy (target INR 2.0–3.0 for venous and 3.0–4.0 for
arterial thrombosis or recurrent thrombotic events).
• Consider warfarin plus aspirin if refractory.
• APS in pregnancy:
• Aspirin and LMWH prophylaxis for those with no previous
history of thrombosis or prior fetal loss. Continue 6–12 weeks
post-partum.
• Full anticoagulation with LMWH for those with thrombosis history.
• CAPS: meticulous anticoagulation. Plasma exchange, corticosteroids,
and IVIg may be of beneﬁt. Consider immune suppression (e.g.
cyclophosphamide, esp. if associated connective tissue disorder).

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Systemic sclerosis
Introduction
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a heterogeneous autoimmune connective tissue
disorder characterized by inﬂammation, ﬁbrosis, and vasomotor abnormalities. It is 75x more common in ♀, with peak age 30–40.
On the basis of clinical presentation, organ involvement, and outcomes,
it is subclassiﬁed as follows.
Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis
Skin involvement is proximal to elbows and knees, and solid organ involvement is frequent. Characteristic autoantibodies: anti-Scl-70 and anti-RNP.
More equal sex distribution.
Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis
Skin involvement is more distal, and solid organ involvement is unusual. CREST
syndrome is an example. Characteristic autoantibodies: anti-centromere.

Pathophysiology
Dysregulated collagen synthesis and degradation, associated with multiple immunological (e.g. anti-endothelial cell antibodies) and vascular (e.g.
aberrant vasomotor control) irregularities, leads to collagen accumulation and ﬁbrotic cutaneous and visceral damage. Many cell types (including endothelial, ﬁbroblasts, T and B cells, and macrophages), as well as
cytokines (particularly pro-ﬁbrotic IL-4, TGF-B, and PDGF), contribute to
progressive changes in the extracellular matrix and its constituents, including ﬁbronectin, proteoglycans, and various forms of collagen.

Clinical presentation
Patchy skin oedema, with eventual ﬁbrosis and calcinosis, digital ulceration, periorbital tethering and microstomia, nasal beaking and tapering of
the ﬁngers (sclerodactyly), Raynaud’s phenomenon, facial and limb telangiectasia, non-erosive arthritis, myalgia, oesophageal (and intestinal) dysmotility, pulmonary ﬁbrosis, and pulmonary hypertension.

Renal involvement
Clinical presentations: i BP and scleroderma renal crisis, CKD (relatively
common—s to ﬁbrotic renal change), drug-related, e.g. NSAIDs, systemic vasculitis (<2%), SSc + SLE overlap with lupus-type nephritis.
SCr, eGFR, urinalysis (9 uPCR), and BP should be regularly monitored
in patients with SSc (e.g. 3–6 months). Patients should be encouraged to
undertake home BP monitoring.

Scleroderma renal crisis
A syndrome of AKI and accelerated i BP in the context of SSc. It occurs
in 5% of all SSc patients (15% diffuse disease; 1–2% limited disease). It is the
ﬁrst presentation of SSc in 720%.
Pathogenesis
Remains poorly understood, but endothelial injury with intimal thickening
of intrarenal arteries ld renal perfusion and hyperreninaemia. Subsequent
changes (including epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation) within
the glomeruli and tubulointerstitium promote renal injury. Endothelin-1
receptor dysregulation has also been observed.

SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS

Risk factors
Recent onset of diffuse disease, active skin disease, steroid use, positive
anti-RNA polymerase.

Clinical features and investigation
• New-onset signiﬁcant i BP (e.g. >150/80mmHg) or BP that
is signiﬁcantly higher than a patient’s own baseline. Can be
asymptomatic, but accelerated BP with multisystem involvement may
be present (b p. 518).
• Urinalysis, urine microscopy, and uPCR. Urinalysis is surprisingly bland
but may reveal mild proteinuria 9 microscopic haematuria.
• i SCr, d Hb, d Plt, ﬁlm (? fragments), i LDH, d haptoglobins (microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia in 750%).
• Autoantibodies: ANA (760% +ve in speckled pattern), anti-RNA
polymerase antibodies.
• USS kidneys, ECG 9 echocardiogram (pericardial effusion in 75%).

Renal histology
May be necessary if the diagnosis is in doubt. Also yields important prognostic information. 2 BP must be controlled prior to biopsy (b p. 80).
Characteristic ﬁndings are ‘onion skin’ intimal proliferation and thickening, ﬁbrin thombi, ﬁbrinoid necrosis, thrombotic microangiopathy, ischaemic and collapsed glomeruli, variable degrees of ATN.

Management (see also Hypertensive emergency b p. 518)
• Admit to a high dependency environment.
• Continuous cardiac monitoring, and consider invasive monitoring,
particularly invasive arterial BP monitoring.
• Meticulous ﬂuid balance. Chart input and output. Catheterize. Patients
have i vascular resistance, so cautious ﬂuid challenges, as appropriate.
• 2 Antihypertensive treatment. Aims: reduce SBP by 20mmHg and
DBP by 10mmHg every 24h.  Avoid d BP.
• ACE-I are the mainstay of therapy—they have been shown to
signiﬁcantly reduce mortality (from 80% to 15%). Good BP control
can prevent further renal deterioration and assist renal recovery.
However, there is no evidence that ACE-I prevent renal crises.
• Captopril (12.5–50mg PO tds) has a short half-life and is easy to
titrate to BP. Switch to a longer-acting agent as soon as stable.
• Add an ARB as second line. Additional agents, e.g. calcium channel
blockers, may be required.
• 725% will require renal replacement therapy at presentation.
• Unproven interventions include: epoprostenol infusion for 24–48h (li
renal perfusion), ﬁsh oils (b p. 547), and plasma exchange if severe TMA.

Prognosis
Progression to ESRD in 720–50%. However, 750% will discontinue RRT
within 1–2 years (transplantation should 6 rarely be considered during this
period). The degree of irreversible damage on renal biopsy may provide
useful prognostic information to aid decision-making. Mortality remains
signiﬁcant (730% at 3 years). Poor prognostic features include: permanent
ESRD, older age (age >55), and low or normal BP at presentation (presumably a marker of signiﬁcant cardiac involvement). Recurrence is rare,
but compliance with treatment is crucial.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Rheumatoid arthritis
Introduction
RA is a chronic multisystem autoimmune disorder of unknown aetiology,
characterized by synovial hypertrophy, joint inﬂammation, joint erosion,
and many extra-articular manifestations. The annual incidence of RA is 73
cases per 10,000 population, with a prevalence of 71%. Incidence increases
with age (peaking age 35–50), and the disease is more common in ♀.

Renal conditions complicating RA
•
•
•
•
•

Drug toxicity (esp. NSAIDs).
Renal amyloidosis (AA amyloid).
Secondary membranous nephropathy (MN).
Other glomerular lesions.
Rheumatoid vasculitis.

Drug toxicity
• NSAIDs: see b p. 902.
• Methotrexate (see b p. 899): now the most commonly prescribed
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). Usually not
nephrotoxic per se at the doses used for RA. However, it is
primarily renally excreted, and the need for dose adjustment is often
underestimated. Best avoided if GFR <30mL/min.
• Gold (sodium aurothiomalate): now rarely used. Caused proteinuria in
710% and associated with membranous GN.
• Penicillamine: now rarely used; associated with membranous GN
in 715%.
• Anti-TNF biological agents (e.g. etanercept): use has rapidly expanded.
They appear safe, but case reports of an association with glomerular
lesions and vasculitis have emerged.

Renal amyloidosis (b p. 628)
Usually a long history of poorly controlled active RA, with joint deformities. Often seropositive (RhF +ve), with a grumbling acute phase response.
Presentation is with proteinuria—often in the nephrotic range.

Membranous GN
Presents with proteinuria (less commonly, nephrotic syndrome) and historically associated with DMARDs, particularly gold and penicillamine.
Usually occurred within 6–12 months of commencement of therapy. Drug
withdrawal usually leads to remission, but this may take up to a year.
There are reports of MN in association with etanercept therapy.

Other glomerular lesions
Mesangioproliferative GN is the most common renal lesion in RA patients
who have undergone a renal biopsy (735%). An association with IgAN is
also well recognized. These present with an active urinary sediment and
(less commonly) renal impairment. A crescentic proliferative GN has been
described in association with anti-TNF therapy.

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

Rheumatoid-associated vasculitis
A small and medium vessel vasculitis, usually in RhF and anti-CCP (cyclic
citrullinated) antibody +ve patients with long-standing disease. Other risk
factors include ♂ sex and smoking. About 1 in 10 ♂ and 1 in 40 ♀
with RA developed vasculitis, although it is thought that this incidence
is decreasing with improved treatment of severe RA. It is a severe multisystem disorder, associated with a high mortality. Clinical presentation
may be with cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis, mononeuritis multiplex,
digital ischaemia, and ulceration, or with gut, cardiac, or cerebral vasculitis.
Renal involvement manifests as an active urinalysis with a rising SCr. The
renal lesion is a pauci-immune necrotizing GN (b p. 643). Investigations
include i CRP, i RhF, i anti-CCP antibodies. and d C3, d C4. 730%
are p-ANCA-positive. Anti-TNF therapy has been successfully used for
treatment, although it has also been implicated as a trigger in some cases
(mechanisms unclear). Many clinicians treat as for ANCA-associated
vasculitis (b p. 644).

Renal disease in other connective tissue
disorders
Renal disease is not uncommon, and monitoring of urinalysis, SCr, eGFR,
and BP are an important consideration during follow-up.
Sjögren's syndrome
A multisystem autoimmune disorder that may be primary or arise in
association with other connective tissue disorders, e.g. SLE, RA, or systemic sclerosis. Lymphocytic inﬁltration of exocrine glands, particularly
the lacrimal and salivary glands, causes sicca symptoms, such as dry eyes
and dry mouth. Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are typical. Renal involvement in 720%. Manifestations:
• Distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis (b p. 824):
• May be partial or complete, with a tendency to nephrolithiasis.
• Impaired concentrating ability, with polyuria.
• AKI s to acute interstitial nephritis (b p. 580):
• Generally steroid-responsive. CKD (and ESRD) rare.
• Glomerular disease is uncommon.
Mixed connective tissue disorder
Associated with:
• Membranous nephropathy (b p. 564) and MCGN (b p. 550).
• Lupus nephritis or scleroderma renal crisis may develop.
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis
• Myositis and myoglobinuria may lead to false positive haematuria or,
less commonly, AKI s to rhabdomyolysis (b p. 152).
• Glomerular disease associations, e.g. mesangial proliferation, have
been reported.

669

670

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Sarcoidosis
Introduction
A multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown cause, usually affecting
the respiratory system of young adults and characterized by non-caseating
granulomas in involved organs. Renal disease complicates up to 40% of
cases, although it is often subclinical.

Pathogenesis
Remains esoteric, although unidentiﬁed antigen(s) appear to fuel dysregulated immune responses in susceptible individuals. Genetic predisposition
is suggested by i incidence in monozygotic twins, family aggregation, and
race distribution (i African Americans + Scandinavians). Many immune
response genes have been incriminated (e.g. cytokine polymorphisms),
with speciﬁc alleles associated with particular clinical phenotypes.
The culpable antigens remain anonymous, although several environmental
and infectious precipitants have been proposed. In particular, mycobacterial
species (with mycobacterial DNA isolated from 725% of sarcoid specimens),
propionibacteria, and viruses. Various environmental triggers have also been
postulated. It is unclear how this exposure results in such varied abnormalities
of the immune response. CD4+ Th cell activation and cytokine production
(esp. IFN-G, IL-2, IL-12, and TNF-A) appear crucial (patients with sarcoidosis
who acquire HIV do not progress their granulomatous disease). T cells exhibit
a restricted TCR repertoire, suggesting oligoclonal expansion in response to a
speciﬁc antigen. In addition, paradoxical peripheral immune anergy is evident
during active disease, e.g. reduced delayed type hypersensitivity reactions.

Histology
Characteristic, irrespective of site: non-caseating epithelioid granulomas,
comprising a central area of macrophages that differentiate into epithelioid
cells before fusion into multinucleate giant cells. These are surrounded by
CD4+ T cells, with CD8+ cells and B cells located peripherally. Unlike TB,
necrosis is minimal. The nidus for granuloma formation may be partly processed antigenic material (e.g. microbial debris), and they are an attempt
to ‘seal off’ such material to limit tissue injury.

Symptoms and signs
• Protean: sarcoidosis is the great clinical mimic of the post-syphilis era.
• Classically presents with ≥1 of the following four: bilateral hilar
adenopathy, pulmonary inﬁltrates, skin lesions, and ocular involvement.
• Other:
• General: lymphadenopathy, fevers, weight loss, malaise.
• Chest: stage I—bilateral hilar adenopathy; stage II—adenopathy and
inﬁltrates; stage III—interstitial disease with regressing adenopathy;
stage IV—pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
• Eyes: uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, retinal vasculitis.
• Skin: pigmentary changes, lupus pernio, erythema nodosum.
• Cardiac: conduction defects, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy.
• Neuro: mononeuritis multiplex, aseptic meningitis, pituitary inﬁltration
(l cranial DI); neurosarcoid may present as an MS-like illness.
• Liver: granulomatous hepatitis.
• Kidney: see b p. 671.

SARCOIDOSIS

Investigations
Usually rests on combined clinical, imaging, and histological ﬁndings. 50%
of cases are found incidentally on chest imaging. Serum ACE +ve in 775%
cases and useful for disease monitoring.

Renal involvement
Exact prevalence unknown. CKD occurs in 71% of patients.
Calcium metabolism
• Common. Activated macrophages within granulomas express
1A-hydroxylase and convert 25-(OH) vitamin D3 to active 1,25-(OH)2
vitamin D3 (calcitriol), particularly during sunny months (increased
substrate availability). This leads to i gut Ca2+ uptake and l:
• Hypercalcaemia (10–20%). More common in older patients (esp. ♂).
• Hypercalciuria (750%).
• Calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis (715%).
• Nephrocalcinosis (which is associated with CKD).
• Management: rehydrate. Steroids d macrophage calcitriol production.
Consider d calcium (and oxalate) intake (b p. 723). Avoid calcium
and vitamin D supplements. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic
release of skeletal calcium. Ketoconazole inhibits the conversion of
25-(OH) vitamin D3 to 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3.
Tubular dysfunction
s to i Ca2+ or granulomatous TIN. Defective concentrating ability with
polyuria common. Other defects: RTA, Na+ wasting, and Fanconi’s.
Glomerular disease
Uncommon. Various histological patterns described, including FSGS,
membranous, mesangioproliferative, MCGN, IgAN, and crescentic GN (all
may be steroid-responsive). Immunoglobulin and complement deposition
is usual. Underlying mechanisms unknown but presumably a consequence
of altered immune responses.
Obstruction 2° to retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and ﬁbrosis
(See b p. 738.)
Granulomatous interstitial nephritis
720% sarcoid patients have renal granulomatous inﬂammation, although
it is symptomatic in a minority only. More common in ♂. 750% have an
abnormal CXR and 750% an elevated serum ACE. Concomitant i Ca2+
may be present (and contribute to i SCr). Presentation is variable: asymptomatic i SCr, active disease in other organs, loin pain. Urinalysis is typically bland, with proteinuria mild, if present.
• Diagnosis: renal biopsy (see Histology). Ca2+ deposition not uncommon.
• Differential diagnosis: AIN of any cause, esp. drug hypersensitivity
(b p. 580), infection, TINU (b p. 581) and Sjögren’s syndrome (b
p. 669).
• Management: rehydrate if i Ca2+. Prednisolone 20–40mg daily: SCr and
Ca2+ may improve rapidly. Taper once SCr stabilized—generally slowly
(over >1 year). Many clinicians maintain a long-term maintenance dose,
at the lowest possible dose. Monitor SCr and Ca2+ (serum and urine),
but predicting relapse is difﬁcult, so maintain high index of suspicion.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Fabry’s disease
Introduction
Fabry’s disease is a rare, multisystem, X-linked lysosomal storage disease,
resulting from a deﬁciency of the enzyme A-galactosidase A (A-Gal A).
This results in the widespread lysosomal accumulation of the glycosphingolipid substrates of A-Gal A, particularly globotriaosylceramide (GL-3).
Progressive GL-3 accumulation in vascular endothelial lysosomes leads
to extensive and progressive occlusive small vessel disease.

Genetics
The second most common lysosomal storage disorder (after Gaucher’s
disease), with a prevalence of 71 in 100,000. The gene for A-Gal A is
located on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq22).
More than 500 A-Gal A mutations have been identiﬁed. Many lead to
little, if any, A-Gal A activity (classic Fabry’s disease), whilst others allow
for residual enzyme activity (typically late-onset disease).
The sons of affected ♂ will not have the disease, whereas all their
daughters will be heterozygotes. 50% of the sons of heterozygotes will
then be affected (whilst 50% of their daughters will also be heterozygotes).
Heterozygous ♀ have a wide range of clinical manifestations, from
asymptomatic to severely affected (although symptoms tend to manifest
later in life). Genetic counselling should be offered.

Clinical features
Often begin in childhood and adolescence.
• Skin: petechial-like angiokeratomas (appear as clusters of small red
spots; classically umbilical, swimsuit region, and on extremities).
Histologically, these are small, dilated veins of the upper dermis,
covered by hyperkeratotic epidermis.
• Cardiac: occlusive coronary disease, conduction abnormalities, valvular
disease, LVH. Lower extremity oedema (lymphatic glycosphingolipid
accumulation).
• Neurological: painful acroparaesthesias (tingling, numbness, and
stiffness of distal extremities—particularly during a febrile illness),
neuropathic pain, autonomic dysfunction, hyperhidrosis, TIAs, stroke,
vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency (ataxia, memory loss), tinnitus, hearing
loss, depression.
• Ocular: corneal opacities (called verticillata) and dystrophy (visible on
slit lamp examination).
• Pulmonary: cough, obstructive airways disease.
• Renal involvement: glomerular damage with proteinuria 9 microscopic
haematuria. Progressive CKD and ESRD (typically age 730–50). Renal
abnormalities may be milder in heterozygote ♀, e.g. isosthenuria,
asymptomatic proteinuria—however, 10% will progress to ESRD.

FABRY’S DISEASE

The underdiagnosed ‘renal variant’
There is evidence that Fabry’s disease is an underestimated cause of progressive CKD and ESRD. Measurement of A-Gal A activity in ♂ dialysis
patients suggests 0.2–1.0% have unrecognized disease.
The majority of these patients do not exhibit current or historical
‘hallmark’ Fabry’s symptoms, esp. angiokeratomas, acroparaesthesias, or
corneal opacities, which might have drawn attention to the diagnosis
sooner. Many other features of classical disease remain absent, although
cardiac involvement can often be found on closer scrutiny.
Theses individuals tended to have residual A-Gal A activity and 6 to
have developed clinically overt disease later in life.

Renal histology
As well as in vascular endothelium, glycosphingolipid accumulation
occurs in podocytes, mesangial cells, and, to a lesser extent, tubular cells
(lipid-laden distal tubular cells are shed and can be seen on urine microscopy). In later-onset variants, podocytes are more dominantly affected
than other cell types.
On microscopy, foamy inclusions may be seen in most cell types.
Arteriolar sclerosis, glomerular atrophy and sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis are common. Electron microscopy reveals characteristic lysosomal lamellar cytoplasmic (termed myelin or zebra bodies).

Investigation
•
•
•
•
•

Slit lamp examination.
Lipid-laden epithelial cells on urine microscopy.
Reduced or absent plasma A-Gal A activity.
Elevated serum GL-3 level.
A-Gal A mutation analysis in equivocal cases.

Treatment
Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant A-Gal A has transformed management. Two preparations are available: agalsidase alfa
(Replagel®) and beta (Fabrazyme®). Usually delivered as an IV infusion
at 2-weekly intervals.  Extremely expensive. Infusion reactions are not
uncommon. Neutralizing antibodies develop to the recombinant enzyme
but do not usually appear to decrease efﬁcacy.
Treatment demonstrably stabilizes and slows progression of disease,
with clearance of accumulated GL-3 from capillary endothelial cells in kidney, skin, and heart. Progression of CKD is slowed.
Initiate ERT at the time of diagnosis in adult ♂ patients. Timing will
depend on clinical symptoms and evidence of organ involvement in
heterozygote ♀.
ERT should be continued in ESRD patients for its non-renal beneﬁts.
Transplantation is feasible, as recurrent disease is also ameliorated by
therapy.

Introduction
Almost 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV-1, and 730% of
patients with HIV infection have a degree of renal dysfunction. As a result,
HIV-associated kidney disease has emerged as a relatively common cause
of ESRD and HIV-associated mortality.
HIV is associated with almost every described renal lesion (as well as
many electrolyte and acid–base disorders), either as a direct consequence
of infection or as a result of the nephrotoxic proﬁle of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medications (see Table 8.8). HIV-related renal
lesions can be classiﬁed according to histopathological ﬁndings. The most
frequent are: classic HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), HIV immune
complex kidney disease (HIVICK), and HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HIV-TMA). However, many more glomerular lesions can
occur that sit outside this framework. In addition, patients may develop
glomerular disease related to concomitant HCV or HBV infection.
2 Patients with HIV infection are also more vulnerable to episodes of
AKI (which has a higher mortality risk than non-HIV-associated AKI) as
well as HIV-associated malignant lesions of the kidneys.

Epidemiology
Historically, HIVAN was the most common lesion associated with HIV
infection in the developed world. However, the incidence has decreased
with HAART. The true prevalence of HIVAN is unknown, as many
patients do not undergo a renal biopsy. In one series, HIVAN was seen in
40–60% of biopsies. In another, the following lesions were found: HIVAN
27%; HIVICK 21%; membranous GN 13% (9 hep B); post-infectious diffuse proliferative GN 8%; mesangial hyperplasia (pure mesangial changes,
immunostaining negative) 6%; IgAN 5%; others—malignant i BP, TMA,
TIN, ATN, diabetic nephropathy, hep C-associated MCGN.
The incidence of renal associated neoplasms is 74–8% in patients with
AIDS. Neoplastic processes include lymphomas and Kaposi’s sarcomas
and usually occur as part of widespread disease.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

HIV and renal disease: HIVAN
Introduction
As HIV infection has burgeoned globally, HIVAN has become a signiﬁcant cause of CKD and ESRD. It is almost exclusive to black adults. The
University of Cape Town has developed a HIVAN classiﬁcation to enable
standardization of terminology (see Table 8.9). Prognostic indicators and
outcomes have been evaluated using this classiﬁcation.

Pathogenesis
Transgenic mouse models suggest that expression of HIV genes alone is
not sufﬁcient to cause HIVAN. Genetic factors (MYH9, ApolL1 genes—
two variants in the ApoL1 gene have been identiﬁed as the susceptibility alleles responsible for most of the increased risk in black patients),
unknown environmental factors, and host factors (e.g. RAAS activation)
are also important. Viral proteins, such as Nef, induce podocyte dysfunction—characterized by increased proliferation, apoptosis, and dedifferentiation. Others, including Vpr, induce apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial
cells. As renal cells do not express classical CD4 HIV-1 receptors, it is
unclear how virus enters the cells, although direct cell–cell transmission
appears important for infection of renal tubular epithelial cells.

Histopathology
HIVAN is characterized by the so-called collapsing variant of FSGS (the
capillary tuft literally crumples), with microcystic tubular dilatation, tubular
atrophy, interstitial inﬁltrates (often CD8+ cells), interstitial oedema, and
ﬁbrosis. Immunostaining is non-speciﬁc. EM often reveals endothelial cell
tubuloreticular inclusions and nuclear bodies.
2 These ﬁndings should prompt serological testing for HIV.

Symptoms and signs
Proteinuria—often with the nephrotic syndrome clinically. Renal impairment (usually superadded ATN). BP is characteristically normal (780%),
perhaps s to relative vasodilatation and renal salt loss. Oedema may be
less marked than in other cause of the nephrotic syndrome, a phenomenon that is unexplained.

CD4 count <50 cells/μL.

Management of HIVAN
HAART, a three-drug regimen of two reverse transcriptase inhibitors
plus a protease inhibitor, has completely transformed the outlook for
HIV-infected individuals. A diagnosis of HIVAN is considered as an indication for HAART, regardless of CD4 count. Continuous therapy is important to gain maximal beneﬁt: there is a high incidence of ESRD in patients
whose treatment is interrupted through poor compliance.
HAART exerts the following effects on HIVAN:
• Reduced proteinuria—with full or partial remission of nephrotic
syndrome.
• Delayed progression of renal impairment.
• Potential renal recovery and dialysis independence
ACE-I/ARBs should be prescribed, as for any proteinuric renal disease
(note: avoid calcium channel blockers if on protease inhibitors).
Prednisolone has been used with some success, particularly when
prominent interstitial inﬂammation and i SCr, but there is an absence of
well-controlled trials. Ciclosporin has been studied in children.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

HIV and renal disease: other lesions
HIVICK
Immune complex-related lesions are gathered under the term HIVICK.
These resemble IgA nephropathy and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (lupus-like).
Pathogenesis
As the immune complexes are generated by an HIV-induced immune
response, an active viraemia is required. It is not clear why some patients
develop HIVICK and some patients develop HIVAN, but both appear to
be the consequence of a dysregulated immune response to HIV infection.
In IgA type, IgA and viral antigen complexes deposit in the kidney.
Histopathology
Mesangial change with mild/moderate hyperplasia and immune deposits.
Large subepithelial deposits are seen with a ‘ball-in-cup’ appearance. The
diffuse proliferative GN (described as ‘lupus-like’) has IgG, IgM, C3, and
C1q immune deposits.
Symptoms and signs
Presentation can vary, although haematuria and low-grade proteinuria are
most common. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome are also recognized. Unlike HIVAN, the vast majority of patients
are Caucasian or Hispanic, although affected Asians and black patients are
described.
Investigations
Investigations, such as ANA and ANCA, must be interpreted with caution
because false positives are more common in HIV-infected patients.
Management
Whilst HAART is established as the main treatment for HIVAN, it is
unclear if other types of HIV-related kidney disease derive as much beneﬁt
from its use. The Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START)
study is an ongoing trial investigating the impact of early HAART therapy
on AIDS and non-AIDS conditions, including CKD, and should help to
answer this question in the near future.

HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathy
HIV-TMA is associated with more advanced HIV disease and AIDS. It is
another example of a renal lesion that has declined in incidence in the
HAART era (<1% of HIV-infected patients).
The pathogenesis of HIV-associated TMA is poorly understood.
ADAMTS-13 levels are generally not decreased, suggesting an unconventional mechanism for TMA in this group (b p. 576). However,
with adequate treatment, it generally carries a better prognosis than
idiopathic TMA.
Suspect if AKI, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of microangiopathic
haemolytic anaemia. Deﬁnitive diagnosis requires a renal biopsy. Patients
with a high viral load (VL) require longer PEX therapy, compared to
patients with a lower VL.

HIV AND RENAL DISEASE: OTHER LESIONS

HAART-related renal side effects
There has been a deﬁnite reduction in the incidence of HIVAN since the
introduction of HAART medications; however, signiﬁcant evidence of
nephrotoxicity associated with HAART has emerged.
Common problems include:
• Protease inhibitors:
• Examples: indinavir, nelﬁnavir, ritonavir.
• Problems: crystalluria (may cause microtubular obstruction and
ATN or lead to nephrolithiasis), interstitial nephritis.
• Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors:
• Examples: zidovudine, didanosine, adefovir, tenofovir.
• Problems: proximal tubular cell injury (l Fanconi-like syndrome),
lactic acidosis (often severe—probably the consequence of
mitochondrial DNA damage), AKI (ATN). Also associated with
CKD (itself the consequence of interstitial ﬁbrosis).

ESRD in patients with HIV infection
In the USA and elsewhere, HIV-associated ESRD is an epidemic among
black patients. The risk of ESRD in black HIV-infected individuals is
73–6x higher than in Caucasian HIV-infected patients. Concomitant
IVDU and HCV infection are important additional risk factors for ESRD.
Despite the successes of HAART, longer overall survival in both black
and Caucasian patients with HIV-associated CKD has meant that the
prevalence of ESRD is still increasing—and remains associated with
poorer survival (although this is improving).
Dialysis
Survival on either HD or CAPD appears comparable. HIV-infected
patients undergoing haemodialysis do not require isolation.
Transplantation
Transplanting patients with HIV infection is a challenge in terms of infection rates, rejection rates, and attaining therapeutic and non-toxic levels
of immunosuppression. However, in appropriate cases, it is thought to
improve survival in comparison to dialysis.
Patient selection is crucial. Criteria: stable disease and antiviral regimen, compliant with medication, undetectable viral load, and preserved
CD4 counts >200 cells/μL). In addition, drug interactions and toxicities
are a major challenge.
The largest series of HIV kidney transplantations was published in 2010,
with 150 performed over a 6-year period (including both live-related
and deceased donor). Regimens were tacrolimus- or ciclosporin-based,
and some patients had ATG induction; 3 years’ follow-up. Rejection
rates were high—31% at year 1, 41% at year 3. Graft survival was worse
in comparison to the non-HIV transplant population, and increased
numbers of neoplasms were seen.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Hepatitis B
Introduction
Approximately 1/3 of the world’s population have been infected with
HBV, and 7350 million are chronic carriers. The majority of these are in
the developing world, especially Africa and South East Asia where perinatal transmission is the dominant route of infection. The prevalence in the
USA and Western Europe is 70.1–0.5% (placing them in the lowest WHO
category), although this will vary considerably between particular communities. In the USA, it is estimated that there are 71.3 million carriers (some
estimates are much higher). The majority of these infections are acquired
as adults, principally via sexual activity or IVDU. Although acute HBV infection rates have fallen (ld IVDU, needle exchanges, behavioural change in
the HIV era, vaccination of the at-risk), the frequency of chronic infection
is actually increasing because of migration from areas of high prevalence.
The virus
The HBV genome comprises partially double-stranded circular DNA
linked to a DNA polymerase and surrounded by nucleocapsid and lipid
envelopes. Embedded within these outer layers are the numerous antigens
familiar from serological identiﬁcation of the disease.
The illness
In adults, an acute seroconversion illness follows 1–6 months after exposure. This ranges from asymptomatic (usual), through a non-speciﬁc viral
illness, to a more severe illness with frank jaundice. Most adults develop
immunity and clear the virus. The remainder become chronic carriers. Patients may alternate between active disease, where the immune
responses cause liver inﬂammation, and an inactive carrier state. Carriers
are at risk of hepatic (chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma) and extra-hepatic (e.g. GN, vasculitis, and reactive arthritis) complications. If HBV is acquired in childhood, chronic carriage is the norm
(790%). This falls to 75–10% in adults (higher in the elderly).

HBV serology explained
• The diagnosis and monitoring of HBV is based on the collective
interpretation of several serologic markers (+ HBV DNA + liver
enzymes) (see Table 8.10).
• HBsAg may appear ≥1 week post-exposure but usually ≥4–6 weeks.
• HBsAg positivity indicates that an individual is infected ( and 6
potentially infectious).
• HBsAg persistence (>6 months) separates acute infection from
chronic ‘carrier’ status.
• Quantitative HBsAg testing is available, with lower levels associated
with better host immune HBV control. Its utility for monitoring of
therapy (esp. nucleoside/nucleotide analogues) is increasing.
• The immune response to HBsAg produces anti-HBs (as does
vaccination). This usually persists indeﬁnitely.
• The ﬁrst antibody identiﬁed is actually anti-HBc. IgM anti-HBc indicates
acute infection—and it may be the evidence of HBV acutely, before
HBsAg and anti-HBs appear. Subsequent IgG anti-HBc persists
indeﬁnitely (signifying either historical or ongoing infection).

HEPATITIS B

• HBeAg is a marker of viral replication ( and 6 infectivity).
• Although HBeAg is often present acutely (suggesting i infectivity),
that is not its main clinical utility.
• HBV within liver cells may be in a replicating (i.e. virus-producing)
and non-replicating (host DNA-integrated) form. As HBeAg is
produced only during viral replication, it is an extremely useful
marker of viral activity during surveillance of chronic HBV carriers.
• HBeAg disappearance and appearance of anti-HBe is termed
seroconversion. This may occur during acute HBV or years later
in chronic carriers. Seroconversion is good news—associated
with d HBV replication, HBV clearance, clinical improvement, and
favourable response to treatment.
• 2 General rule: +ve HBeAg = infectivity; +ve anti-HBs = immunity.
• HBV DNA estimates viral burden and viral replication. It can be
quantitatively measured via sensitive PCR assays.
• HBV DNA helps: (i) to determine recovery from acute infection;
(ii) to distinguish inactive carriers from those with active disease;
and (iii) to assess the appropriateness of antiviral therapy.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

HBV-related renal disease
Introduction
Three common nephropathies are described: membranous GN, MCGN,
and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). An association between HBV and IgAN
has also been reported but may be coincidental, as IgAN is common in
many populations. Minimal change, FSGS, and amyloid are also described.

Pathogenesis
Direct HBV renal tissue invasion does not occur (unlike HIV). Instead, viral
and host factors (including genetic predisposition) play a role in glomerular immune complex deposition. These complexes comprise viral antigens and host antibodies, either forming in situ in the kidney or becoming
trapped after circulation. The location of the immune deposit depends on
its size, which, in turn, depends on the involved antigen.

Investigations
Full HBV serology and HBV DNA PCR (b p. 680). HCV and HIV serology. U&E, SCr, LFT. uPCR or uACR. FBC, INR. Full immunological screen
may be required (b p. 40). USS liver and kidneys. Renal biopsy.

Membranous glomerulonephritis (MN)
HBeAg–antibody immune complexes are small enough to pass through
the capillary basement membrane and deposit in the subepithelial space
and cause MN. The clinical course of HBV-associated MN differs between
children and adults. MN is common in children aged 2–12 years (♂ > ♀),
presenting with proteinuria. Usually HBeAg +ve. Tends to remit spontaneously with seroconversion (i.e. clearance of HBeAg and development of
anti-HBe). Proteinuria may persist for >1 year. Adults often present with
a more chronic nephrotic syndrome and progressive CKD in association
with liver disease. >50% will reach ESRD in 3 years.

Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (MCGN)
Immune complexes involving HBsAg are too large to traverse the basement membrane so settle in the subendothelial space. MCGN is more
common in adults (>MN in that age group), presenting with i BP, heavy
proteinuria, microhaematuria, and progressive CKD (i.e. a more nephritic
presentation than MN). Histology is similar to type I MCGN (b p. 550),
with a ‘tram track’ pattern—some normal capillary loops with thin BM, others with split BM. Unlike MCGN with HCV, cryoglobulins are not present.

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)
Occurs within 4 months of HBV infection in adults, presenting as a
medium-vessel vasculitis attributed to immune complex deposition (b
p. 652). ANCA –ve. Relapse rare—never once viral replication has
stopped/seroconversion has occurred. Incidence appears to be falling
along with the incidence of acute HBV.

IgAN
The liver metabolizes IgA, so serum IgA levels increase in hepatic disease
of any cause, potentially ending up secondarily deposited within the renal
mesangium and capillary loops. Clinically signiﬁcant disease is rare.

HBV-RELATED RENAL DISEASE

Treatment of HBV-associated disease in adults
Cessation of immune complex formation requires treatment of HBV.
Remission should follow seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe and
a reduction in, or disappearance of, HBV DNA. Long-term nucleoside
analogues are often used for this purpose (see below). Response rates
are higher in MN than MCGN. Standard treatment of proteinuric disease
with ACE-I/ARB to achieve BP <130/80mmHg and reduce urinary protein
excretion also applies. Immunosuppression should be avoided (li viral
replication 9 hepatic decompensation—may occur on treatment withdrawal). PAN is a possible exception where severity of disease may necessitate steroid and cytotoxic therapy, with concomitant antivirals.

Treatment of HBV-related liver disease: a primer
• Decisions are based on HBV DNA, serum ALT, and assessment
of liver disease (including histology). Some guidelines have slightly
different criteria, according to HBeAg status (with lower HBV
thresholds in HBeAg –ve individuals).
• In general, patients should be considered for treatment when HBV
DNA levels are above 2,000IU/mL (710,000 copies/mL) 9 serum
ALT is above the upper limit of normal, with evidence of active liver
inﬂammation or ﬁbrosis.
Anti-HBV therapy
 Much of the long-term data exclude renal patients. Treatment
includes antivirals and immune modulators (to enhance host responses).
Response rates are modest.
Interferon alfa
5 million U x6/week or 10 million U x3/week SC for 4 months leads to
undetectable HBV DNA levels and HBeAg clearance in 30–40%. 5–10%
of patients relapse after treatment. SE: fatigue, ﬂu-like illness (can be
severe and debilitating), depression, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, GI
upset, alopecia, transient liver ‘ﬂare’ at outset.
Peginterferon alfa
A 48-week regimen has similar efﬁcacy to interferon alfa. Peginterferon
alfa 2a has an i half-life and a more stable plasma concentration, allowing fewer injections and better patient tolerability.
Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues
Associated with lower rates of HBe and HBs seroconversion. Most evidence for extra-hepatic manifestations lies with lamivudine. This inhibits
viral polymerase, but efﬁcacy is limited by the emergence of drug-resistant
mutants (715% per year). Usual dose 100mg PO daily, but  dose reductions for d GFR. Adefovir is also associated with resistance, and renal
toxicity is recognized. Entecavir and tenofovir are potent antivirals, with
good safety proﬁles and a low resistance rates thus far. Entecavir requires
a dose adjustment, according to GFR, but has not been associated with
renal toxicity so may be the treatment of choice in renal disease.
Nucleoside analogues are usually continued indeﬁnitely, unless
anti-HBe seroconversion is achieved. There is currently no strong evidence that combination therapy is superior.

683

684

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

HBV and ESRD
Introduction
There were multiple documented HBV outbreaks on haemodialysis units
in the 1960s and 70s, and they occur sporadically to this day (usually
because of poor infection control practices). Such historical outbreaks
were associated with considerable morbidity and mortality among both
staff and patients alike. By deﬁnition, blood contact is not uncommon in
this setting, and HBV is a tenacious virus ex vivo, remaining infectious on
surfaces, even after drying, and requiring potent disinfection to inactivate.

Prevention
3 The best means of controlling HBV-related renal disease is to prevent
it. Offer immunization against HBV early in CKD (b p. 685). Household
contacts and family members of HBsAg-positive patients should also be
immunized. Avoid sharing potentially blood-contaminated items (toothbrushes, etc.). Protected intercourse.

Haemodialysis
Haemodialysis patients are usually screened annually for HBV (and HCV)
as well as on return from dialysing abroad. In the UK, <1% of the HD population are HBV-infected. HBV patients require isolation on haemodialysis
units, in addition to standard universal precautions. Dedicated machines
are used and dialyser re-use avoided. Peritoneal dialysis is an option.

Transplantation in patients with hepatitis B infection
Transplantation is thought to offer a survival beneﬁt over remaining on
dialysis, but patient selection is crucial. Patients with evidence of active
viral replication (HBeAg +ve or HBV DNA +ve) must be treated prior to
transplantation and should remain on a nucleoside/nucleotide analogue
post-transplant. IFN-A is an immune modulator and can provoke rejection if used after transplantation. In addition, patients who are HBsAg
and/or anti-HBc +ve should be considered for nucleoside/nucleotide
analogue prophylaxis post-transplant. Most data in this context concern
lamivudine (the dose of which should be adapted to GFR). HBsAg +ve
patients have about twice the mortality of non-HBsAg patients 5–15 years
post-transplantation (probably partly due to reactivation of latent disease).
Cirrhosis is a contraindication to renal transplantation. New acquisitions
of HBV post-transplant can present with severe disease on immune suppression. HBV-related GN can recur/occur in transplants.
HBsAg-positive kidney donors
It is acceptable practice to use HBsAg +ve donor to HBsAg +ve recipient,
with using antiviral prophylaxis. However, the safety proﬁle is less clear
when using an HBsAg +ve donor for a recipient who is anti-HBs +ve (i.e.
potentially immune—either as the result of prior infection or of immunization), as pre-existing immunity may not be sufﬁcient to overcome
the viral load transferred with the transplanted kidney in the presence
of immunosuppression. X Small case series suggest that outcomes may
be favourable.

HBV AND ESRD

HBV vaccination in CKD
Patients who are likely to require renal replacement therapy (RRT)
should be immunized against HBV—a strategy that has been associated
with a reduced incidence of HBV infection in dialysis units.
Despite the lower probability of HBV infection in peritoneal dialysis
patients (and patients destined for pre-emptive transplantation), there
is sufﬁcient potential they may require haemodialysis at some point in
their life that they should also be offered immunization.
Patients should be immunized early in the course of progressive CKD,
as the proportion of patients achieving adequate anti-HBs antibody
titres is lower, compared with the general population (and lower in
advanced, compared with early, CKD).
Although it is desirable to know a patient’s anti-HBc status beforehand (to prevent unnecessary immunization), HBV prevalence is so low
in many populations that pre-immunization screening may not be warranted. Local protocols will apply.
Most HBV immunization schedules typically involve high doses or frequent doses (or both). Vaccines are generally administered IM (deltoid
muscle), but the intradermal route may be more effective.
Examples:
• Engerix B® 40 micrograms at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months.
• HBvaxPRO® 40 micrograms at 0, 1, and 6 months.
• Fendrix® 20 micrograms at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months (X possibly more
immunogenic).
Response is assessed through measurement of anti-HBs antibody 8
weeks after course completion.
>100mIU/mL was conventionally regarded as immunity (‘responder’),
but there is evidence that patients who have a lower (partial) response
(10–100mIU/mL) are less likely to become chronic HBV carriers. Such
partial responders (and those in whom anti-HBs titres diminish over
time) should receive a further booster dose if the annual anti-HBs titre
is <100mIU/mL.
‘Non-responders’ (<10mIU/mL) generally receive no further immunization, although some protocols give a further full course before accepting this status.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Hepatitis C-related renal disease
Introduction
HCV is an RNA virus with six different genotypes, causing hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and various extra-hepatic disorders. 150–
170 million people are HCV-infected worldwide, with large geographical
variation. Transmission is parental and associated with IVDU, accidental
infection during healthcare (e.g. needle or multidose vial re-use, contaminated blood products, or poorly sterilized instruments), and regional cultural practices. Perinatal and sexual transmission also occur but are less
important than for HBV and HIV.
Infection is mild (often subclinical), following an incubation period (6–9
weeks). 70–85% fail to clear acute infection and become chronic carriers.

Hepatitis C-related glomerulonephritis
HCV is associated with several types of renal disease, predominantly: MCGN
with mixed (type II) cryoglobulinaemia, membranous nephropathy (MN),
and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Also recognized: FSGS, proliferative GN,
ﬁbrillary and immunotactoid GN, IgAN.
Chronic HCV and associated mixed cryoglobulinaemia are now known
to be the principal cause of type I MCGN (previously thought to be
idiopathic).
Renal involvement in some may be mild or clinically silent; in others,
there is a signiﬁcant risk of progression to ESRD (worse if co-infected
with HBV/HIV).
HCV-related type I MCGN 2° to type II (mixed) cryoglobulinaemia
Cryoglobulins are one (monoclonal) or more (polyclonal or mixed) immunoglobulins in serum that reversibly precipitate at <37*C (b p. 634).
Pathogenesis
HCV-induced clonal expansion of rheumatoid factor (RhF)-expressing B
cells in the liver, lymph nodes, and circulation causes excess secretion
of immunoglobulins (predominantly IgM kappa (κ) directed against IgG,
which is itself directed against HCV). These proteins (IgM κ, IgG, and viral
antigens) aggregate into large cryoglobulins. HCV may also be responsible
for type III mixed cryoglobulinaemia comprising polyclonal immunoglobulins (see b p. 634). The cryoglobulins deposit in small and medium-sized
vessels in the skin, joints, and glomeruli, where they ﬁx complement and
cause local inﬂammation and injury. Prolonged clonal expansion of B cells
can eventually lead to B cell lymphoma (75%).
Pathology
Renal biopsy shows a type I MCGN pattern of injury (b p. 550).
• Light microscopy: glomerular hypercellularity, lobular accentuation of
glomerular tuft, increased matrix and mesangial proliferation, splitting
of capillary basement membranes (termed double contouring),
intracapillary thrombosis (from cryoglobulin deposition), vasculitis, and
ﬁbrinoid necrosis.
• Immunostaining: deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 in the mesangium and
capillary walls.

HEPATITIS C-RELATED RENAL DISEASE

• EM demonstrates large subendothelial deposits that may have
a tactoid distribution/size pattern, characteristic of cryoglobulin
deposition (measuring 15–30 microns, distinct from smaller ﬁbrillary
deposits measuring 12–25 microns). These are so large they may
protrude into the capillary lumen, causing thrombosis. This appearance
is different from idiopathic MCGN where the subendothelial deposits
are much smaller (and more commonly encountered in children and
young adults).
Symptoms and signs
2 Usually a systemic disease.
• Extrarenal: fatigue, weight loss, episodic purpuric rash (leucocytoclastic
vasculitis on biopsy), arthralgia, myalgia, mononeuritis multiplex,
Raynaud’s phenomenon. Hepatosplenomegaly and stigmata of liver
disease.
• Renal: the kidney is affected in 60%. Manifestations include haematuria,
proteinuria (often nephrotic range), (i BP, renal impairment (often
progressive), and AKI (5%). In general, HCV-associated MCGN has a
nephritic presentation, whilst MN is usually nephrotic.
Investigations
• Urinalysis (haematuria, proteinuria) and microscopy (red cells casts).
• U&E, SCr, eGFR, Alb, LFT (i ALT/AST), FBC, ESR, CRP.
• Rheumatoid factor (RhF) may be +ve.
• Complement (normal C3, low C4) (b p. 41).
• Cryoglobulins (b p. 634). The cryocrit may be surprisingly low.
• Anti-HCV antibody, HCV RNA PCR (in serum and cryoprecipitate).
• If HCV viral load is low, an alternative diagnosis should be considered,
so a full immunological screen may be helpful (b p. 40).
• HCV genotyping (types 2 and 3 associated with i sustained remission).
• HBV and HIV.
• USS liver and kidneys.
• Renal biopsy (b p. 80).

Other HCV-related glomerulopathies
• Non-cryoglobuminaemic MCGN occurs. It will still be associated with
HCV antibodies and HCV RNA.
• Membranous nephropathy is uncommon. Presentation, pathology,
and outcomes are similar to idiopathic MN. It is thought to
result from HCV-containing immune complexes depositing in the
glomerular basement membrane (HCV can be demonstrated by in situ
hybridization). Cryoglobulins are not detected, and complements are
normal. Antiviral treatment is usually recommended.
• HCV-associated PAN is well described (b p. 652). It tends to be an
acute, severe illness, presenting >2 years post-HCV diagnosis (with no
cryoglobulins). Remission rates with treatment are high.
• Diabetic nephropathy: HCV infects pancreatic islet cells, causing
reduced insulin production, and a post-insulin receptor defect also
operates. Diabetic renal disease is 6 a consideration in long-standing
HCV patients.

HCV-related disease: management
Introduction
Before the link between HCV infection and cryoglobulinaemia MCGN
was discovered, treatments were similar to those used for other small
to medium-vessel vasculitides—namely corticosteroids, alkylating agents,
and plasma exchange (to remove circulating cryoglobulins). Insight into
the relationship between HCV and cryoglobulinaemia has led to direct
treatment of HCV, with immune suppression now reserved for severe or
refractory presentations.
Several issues need to be considered prior to treatment: (1) viral
genotype (some respond better than others); (2) degree of viraemia;
(3) presence of chronic liver disease; (4) severity of CKD (and if dialysis or
transplantation is being considered); (5) extra-hepatic manifestations; and
(6) other comorbidities (e.g. CV disease).
If liver status does not warrant antiviral therapy, then parameters
favouring treatment for renal involvement are nephrotic syndrome, i
SCr, new i BP, and the nature and severity of the injury on renal biopsy. If
HCV viraemia is not present, the renal diagnosis should be reconsidered.
No known therapy speciﬁcally alters renal outcome in MCGN, although
antiviral therapy may clear HCV and have modest effects on proteinuria
and renal function. Relapse of HCV RNA and cryoglobulins on cessation
of treatment is common.

Antiviral treatment
The aim is to reduce or eliminate viraemia and decrease the formation
of immune complexes. Patients with HCV infection are generally treated
with peginterferon alfa (e.g. 180 micrograms/week) 9 the oral antiviral
agent ribavirin (e.g. 1,000–1,200mg/day) for 24–48 weeks.  However,
ribavirin is not recommended if GFR <50mL/min, and most studies have
6 excluded renal patients. There is some evidence that it is safe in haemodialysis patients.
Treatment efﬁcacy is measured in terms of sustained virologic response
(SVR)—HCV RNA levels should be undetectable for a minimum of
6 months after cessation of therapy. Of the six known HCV genotypes,
types 2 and 3 are more responsive than types 1 or 4, with SVR rates of 80%
vs 45%, respectively. SE are common: for interferon alfa, see b p. 683);
ribavirin: haemolysis and anaemia.

KDIGO guidelines for HCV treatment in CKD
•
•
•
•

CKD stage 1–2: peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.
CKD stages 3–4: peginterferon alfa monotherapy.
Haemodialysis: standard interferon alfa.
Ribavirin (9 ESA support) may be considered for all stages in
specialized centres.
• See M <http://kdigo.org/home/guidelines/>.

HCV-RELATED DISEASE: MANAGEMENT

Additional treatments
Adjunctive therapy should be considered for severe active disease (e.g.
rapidly progressive GN, severe neuropathy, widespread cutaneous vasculitis with ulceration). Antivirals will not deal with the circulating cryoglobulins already formed (PEX), and there may be an urgent need to
target B cell production (rituximab) and attenuate tissue injury (steroids).
Commencement of antivirals may need to be delayed until these goals
have been achieved.
Options
• Plasma exchange x3/week for 2–3 weeks to remove cryoglobulins.
• Rituximab 375mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks to stop further B cell production
(also an option if intolerant/resistant to interferon alfa/ribavirin).
• Corticosteroids as methylprednisolone 0.5–1g/day for 3 consecutive
days, then oral.
• Cyclophosphamide 1.5–2.0mg/kg daily orally for 2–4 months.
• Two novel direct-acting antivirals—boceprevir and telaprevir—have
recently been licensed for use in combination with PEG-IFN-α and
ribavirin to increase the viral response in genotype 1 HCV infection.
Use currently limited to patients with normal renal function.
• Low-dose IL-2 is another potential future treatment. Patients with
HCV-induced vasculitis have reduced regulatory T cells (Tregs)
function. IL-2 promotes Treg survival. Additional studies awaited.
Other considerations
• ESA to maintain Hb >110g/L (ribavirin causes red cell fragility).
Anaemia can be very problematic.
• ACE-I/ARB to reduce proteinuria (aim uPCR <50mg/mmol).
• Aim BP <130/80mmHg (esp. if proteinuria).
• Recommend alcohol avoidance.
• Avoid sharing potentially blood-contaminated items (toothbrushes,
etc.). Protected intercourse.
• Screen for hepatocellular carcinoma (liver USS and serum
A-fetoprotein) at 12-monthly intervals.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

HCV and ESRD
Introduction
As a result of potential exposure to blood-contaminated equipment,
haemodialysis patients are at risk of acquiring blood-borne viruses (BBV).
The prevalence of HCV infection in HD patients varies widely (5–60%),
inﬂuenced by factors, such as regional HCV prevalence, infection control
techniques, and historical blood transfusion screening.
Standard universal precautions should always be undertaken, but
HCV-infected patients do not require isolation on haemodialysis (unlike
HBV) or to be dialysed on dedicated machines, as there is no convincing
evidence that this affects transmission rates (although the European Best
Practice Work Group have suggested it should be considered in centres
with high HCV prevalence). ALT should be checked 6-monthly, with annual
screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (USS and serum A-fetoprotein).

Hepatitis C-infected patients and transplantation
Renal transplantation may offer selected HCV+ ESRD patients superior
survival and quality of life, compared to maintenance HD or CAPD.
It is important to assess the degree of liver damage (usually with a liver
biopsy), and those patients with advanced disease, e.g. cirrhosis or portal
hypertension, should be considered for combined liver–kidney transplantation (single renal transplantation is contraindicated).
Patients with active HCV will require antiviral therapy prior to transplantation, although treatment in CKD and dialysis patients is associated
with low sustained virologic response rates (720%) and signiﬁcant drug
intolerance (730–50% of dialysis patients stop treatment).  IFN-A treatment post-transplant is strongly associated with acute rejection (750%).
Post-transplantation, HCV+ transplant recipients have inferior shortand long-term outcomes, compared to HCV– patients. There is a signiﬁcant increase in early (ﬁrst 6 months) infection-related deaths. Patient
survival at 3 years is 770%. 10–20% progress to cirrhosis within 75 years.
The incidence of new-onset diabetes post-transplant (NODAT) is
higher in HCV+ recipients.
HCV-related glomerular disease can recur/occur post-transplantation
and is extremely difﬁcult to treat (see Table 8.11).

HCV-positive kidney donors
X Rejecting organs from all HCV seropositive (potential) deceased
donors will mean discarding organs from many who do not actually
have active viral replication at the time.
Limited experience suggests these kidneys may actually be acceptable
for viraemic HCV+ recipients, although this risks superinfection with an
HCV genotype from the donor that is different from the genotype of
the recipient.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

The kidney in infective endocarditis
Introduction
Infective endocarditis (IE) is deﬁned as infection of the endocardial surface
of the heart. If left untreated, valvular insufﬁciency develops and is generally
fatal. IE is mainly an infection of the left side of the heart, involving the mitral
or aortic valve (or both). Right-sided endocarditis is often associated with
IVDU, but other risk factors include pacemakers, other cardiac devices, and
central venous catheters. Common causes include S. aureus in acute IE or viridans streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci in more chronic IE.
Renal dysfunction occurs due to a variety of mechanisms, including:
• Immune complex-mediated GN.
• Aminoglycoside-induced AKI.
• Drug-induced AIN.
• Emboli (from infected valves).
• Renal abscess formation.

Epidemiology
In the era of effective antibiotic therapy for IE, the incidence of renal complications has been variably reported (ranging from 2 to 60%). The severity
of IE-associated GN is related to the duration of infection prior to the
institution of antibiotics. Control of infection usually leads to rapid resolution, with recovery of renal function. However, irreversible renal damage
may occur if appropriate therapy is delayed. Mortality is higher in those
who develop renal disase.

Symptoms and signs
The manifestations of IE are not always classical—and they are often very
similar to those found in many other systemic diseases.
• 2 Suspect IE if fever, new murmur, splenomegaly, and haematuria
(especially if known to have a valvular abnormality or prosthesis).
• Careful examination may reveal splinter haemorrhages (ﬁngers and/or
toes), although classical stigmata of IE are often absent.
• Microscopic haematuria points towards GN. A bland urinalysis is
unusual—suggesting an alternative diagnosis, e.g. aminoglycoside toxicity.
• Rash, eosinophilia, and a new fever after starting antibiotics may
indicate AIN.
• Acute (unilateral) ﬂank pain and frank haematuria suggest emboli. This
should prompt a search for evidence of emboli in other organs (check
extremities). Infarction at the site of embolization is common; abscess
formation is rare. Cerebral emboli occur in 733% of patients. Emboli
may occur after microbiological ‘cure’.

Investigations
• Repeated blood cultures (and sensitivity testing) are the key to
management.
• Use CRP to monitor treatment response.
• Echocardiography: transthoracic echo (TTE), but transoesophageal
echo (TOE) has superior sensitivity.
• Daily ECG if suspected aortic root abscess.

THE KIDNEY IN INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS

• Urinalysis + microscopy.
• Microscopic haematuria 9 proteinuria, ? GN.
• Sterile pyuria or eosinophiluria, ? AIN.
• FBC: anaemia common. If eosinophilia, ? AIN.
• SCr, U&E, albumin.
• Diligent therapeutic monitoring of aminoglycosides if used (b
pp. 880–1).
• Complement components: C3, C4 (often low) (b p. 41).
• RhF and cryoglobulins in 750% (type III).
• Renal USS. CT or DMSA if emboli suspected (focal perfusions defects).
• Renal biopsy if diagnosis unclear or response to therapy suboptimal.

Pathogenesis
S. aureus IE: staphylococcal enterotoxins are ‘superantigens’ that bind
directly to MHC class molecules of antigen-presenting cells and the
speciﬁc VB chain of the T cell receptor (TCR), causing T cell activation
and T cell-derived cytokine release (e.g. IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF, and IFN-G).
Cytokines cause polyclonal B cell activation and immune complex formation, resulting in GN.

Histology
Table 8.12 shows the different histological patterns of renal disease associated with IE. Immune complex-driven GN has a spectrum of presentation
from mild focal proliferative glomerulonephritis (l urinary abnormalities)
to diffuse crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis (l AKI). It may be
similar to post-streptococcal GN (b p. 548) or MCGN (b p. 550), with
hypercellularity (due, in part, to the inﬂux of circulating inﬂammatory
cells) and immune deposits in the glomerular capillary wall.
Fibrinous thromboemboli within arteries, with inﬂammation of the adjacent renal tissue, may also occur as a consequence of septic emboli—
renal abscesses can form at these sites. Thrombotic microangiopathy with
cortical necrosis can complicate severe sepsis. Acute tubular injury is a
consequence of haemodynamic compromise (as well as nephrotoxic drugs
(aminoglycosides or others).

Treatment
• If GN, cure IE, using appropriate antibiotics. There is no role for
adjunctive treatments, even if crescentic change on biopsy.
• If ATN, tailor aminoglycoside doses to levels or change antibiotic.
• IF AIN, change antibiotic. No role for steroids.
• Valve surgery may be required.

MRSA glomerulonephritis
MRSA glomerulonephritis presents either as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and/or as nephrotic syndrome with various
degrees of proteinuria, usually in the context of a severe MRSA infection. Normal complement levels and polyclonal elevation of serum IgG
and IgA are often seen. Histological changes are described in Table 8.12.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Renal tuberculosis
Introduction
Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and affects 8–10 million people every year, usually presenting as pulmonary disease. The global
burden of TB has risen sharply as a result of HIV infection and the increased
number of patients with solid organ transplants taking long-term immunosuppressive medication.  Data from the World Health Organization
(2010) suggests that one-third of the world population has been exposed
to TB and has at least latent disease.
After lymph node involvement, the most common site of extrapulmonary TB is the genitourinary system (15–30% all cases). Renal dysfunction
can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including direct infection of
the kidney or lower urinary tract, obstructive uropathy, tubulointerstitial
nephritis, and secondary amyloidosis.

Genitourinary TB (GUTB)
Pathogenesis
Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are inhaled into the alveoli. Initially, the
bacilli are locally contained by leucocytes and macrophages, but, over
time, they are carried to regional lymph nodes and the thoracic duct
before delivery into venous blood and seeding of distant organs.
In the kidneys, multiple granuloma form at the site of metastatic foci.
These are typically bilateral, cortical, and adjacent to the glomeruli. They
can remain inactive for decades. Active granulomas may grow to invade
the calyceal systems, resulting in the spread of bacilli to the renal pelvis,
ureters, bladder, and other genitourinary organs, including the epididymis
and prostate.
The renal medulla is preferentially affected, but subsequent papillary and
pelvic involvement causes progressive scarring, calciﬁcation, ﬁbrosis, and
chronic abscess formation. Extensive lesions will result in ESRD.
Ureteral TB may cause strictures (can be extensive), hydronephrosis,
and obstruction. Often unilateral.
Symptoms and signs
Classical TB symptoms, e.g. fever, weight loss, and night sweats, are
uncommon. Pulmonary symptoms may be absent (although 730% will have
an abnormal CXR). Symptoms are often non-speciﬁc, with >25% asymptomatic. It is 6 essential to maintain a high index of suspicion in those at risk.
Abdominal (particularly back and ﬂank) pain, LUTS, recurrent UTIs that
are poorly antibiotic-responsive, macro- and microscopic haematuria,
incontinence (bladder ﬁbrosis), infertility in both sexes.
Investigation
• Sterile pyuria (WCC on microscopy but negative culture) is
characteristic (b p. 24).
• Three consecutive early morning urine samples (EMUs).
• Microscopy for acid-fast bacilli on centrifuged urine (Ziehl–Neelsen
stain) and culture on Löwenstein–Jensen media (takes 2–6 weeks).

RENAL TUBERCULOSIS

•
•
•

• EMUs for AFBs have a sensitivity of only 65% (although speciﬁcity is

• More rapid results (<1 week) with a radiometric culture system

PCR for mycobacterial DNA can be helpful when available. It is a rapid
test with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
U&E (d Na+ s to SIADH), SCr, LFTs, CRP, FBC, ESR.
2 Consider HIV testing.
Tuberculin skin testing is usually undertaken; however, beware false
positives in those patient vaccinated with BCG and false negatives in
those on immune suppression.
Plain KUB may show calciﬁcation.
IVU or CT-IVU: abnormal (70–90%), with calyceal tip erosions
(‘moth-eaten’ calyx), pelvic distortion (e.g. the ‘hiked-up’ appearance),
strictures, ﬁlling defects, and calciﬁcation.
Renal tract USS if obstruction suspected.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Renal tuberculosis: TB-TIN and TB in
patients with ESRD
Tuberculous interstitial nephritis (TB-TIN)
Pathogenesis
A presumed immune-mediated process. TB causes a parenchymal reaction
characterized by giant cells, tubulointerstitial inﬂammation, and caseating
granuloma formation. TB-TIN is a more insidious and less well-recognized
form of renal involvement but is thought to be an underestimated worldwide cause of renal failure (e.g. in Asian patients presenting with advanced
CKD and small kidneys on imaging).
Symptoms and signs
Usually presents as CKD in at-risk populations (esp. South Asians).
Urinalysis is bland. USS shows normal or decreased renal sizes, usually
with a smooth contour. EMU for AFBs are usually negative. CXR may
demonstrate prior or active pulmonary TB. Skin tuberculin testing is often
positive. Diagnosis made on renal biopsy, although this may not undertaken if kidneys are small at presentation. Mycobacterium tuberculosis
can be identiﬁed on tissue stain or parafﬁn-embedded samples, although
detection rates are often low. Luciferase and ﬂuorescence technique
improve sensitivity and can detect low numbers of mycobacteria.
Management
Anti-TB treatment is associated with improved renal function, and recovery from even advanced CKD has been reported. Cure requires combination therapy for 6 months. Compliance may be problematic and should be
reinforced through good patient education. The sensitivities of cultured
M. tuberculosis should be conﬁrmed, but this should not delay initiation of
treatment once the diagnosis has been secured.
2 Check local protocols for drug selection and dosing.
2 A dose adjustment is required for most agents if d GFR.
Initial phase (2 months)
Once-daily rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide (available in combination
preparations, e.g. Rifater®). Add-on ethambutol or streptomycin if immunocompromised or previously treated for TB ( isoniazid resistance).
Continuation phase (further 4 months)
Rifampicin and isoniazid.
Notes
• Add pyridoxine 10–20mg daily (prevents the peripheral neuropathy
associated with isoniazid).
• Check LFT before and 3-weekly during initial phase.
• Check visual acuity if using ethambutol (risk of irreversible optic
neuropathy).
• If HIV-positive, prolonged multidrug treatment may be necessary.

RENAL TUBERCULOSIS: TB-TIN AND TB IN PATIENTS WITH ESRD

• X Corticosteroids, e.g. prednisolone 0.5mg/kg for 2 months
and weaned thereafter. This is poorly evidence-based.
Theory: granulomatous inﬂammation heals by ﬁbrosis so reduce
inﬂammation to prevent secondary scarring. Generally reserved for
those with severe 9 rapidly progressive CKD.

TB in patients with ESRD
• Dialysis patients have a signiﬁcantly increased (6–25-fold) risk of TB.
• ESRD is considered a state of relative immune compromise, mainly
s to disruption of cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. CMI
response is primarily mediated by T cells, whose functions include
the identiﬁcation and killing of intracellular pathogens, such as
M. tuberculosis.
• Nosocomial transmission of TB in dialysis units has also been
reported.
• Risk factors include: older age, Asian race, smoking, malnutrition, and
anaemia.
• The diagnosis in this population is difﬁcult because disease is often
non-pulmonary and symptoms may be non-speciﬁc.
Diagnosis
• Tuberculin skin test consists of intradermal injection of tuberculin.
In positive cases, a T cell-mediated delayed type hypersensitivity
reaction causes a variable degree of induration within 48–72 hours.
However, a high prevalence of anergy in dialysis patients means that
response rates are poor, so false positives are common.
• Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) appear more sensitive and
speciﬁc in this population.
• T cells from patients exposed to TB become sensitized to two
proteins termed ESAT-6 and CFP-10. When these T cells are
exposed to these antigens in the assay, they produce IFN-G, and
the strength of this response can be quantiﬁed.
• Note: IGRAs do not distinguish between latent and active
disease.
• Examples include the T-SPOT TB test® and the
QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube® test (QFT-GIT)).
• IGRAs have now been included in the guidelines for the detection of
latent TB infection in many countries, including the USA and UK.

The kidney in systemic disease

Schistosomiasis
Introduction
Schistosomal infestation (a water-borne trematode) affects as many as
200 million people worldwide and may lead to urinary tract disease or
glomerulonephritis. S. haematobium is endemic in most of Africa and the
Middle East. It preferentially migrates to the venous plexus surrounding
the bladder, causing lower urinary tract disease. S. mansoni (additionally
found in Latin America) and S. japonicum (found in Asia alone) migrate to
the mesenteric vessels or portal tree, causing hepatosplenic disease

Pathogenesis
Acute infestation tends to occur in childhood in residents of endemic
areas but can affect travellers of any age. It is characterized by dermal
invasion (‘swimmer’s itch’) and a subsequent systemic serum sickness-like
syndrome (‘Katayama fever’) with eventual maturation of a trematode
in blood vessels. Eggs released from mature worms cause delayed type
hypersensitivity and granulomatous inﬂammation in local tissues.

Urinary schistosomiasis
Caused by S. haematobium infestation. Presents with terminal haematuria
(frank blood at the end of micturition), dysuria, and frequency as a result
of an inﬂammatory cystitis. A quiescent, asymptomatic period follows that
can last for decades. Late schistosomiasis occurs in 10–40% and may lead
to progressive bladder ﬁbrosis and detrusor failure. Ureteric stricture
formation with obstruction is common (710%). Complications: recurrent
bacterial infection, bladder calculi, CKD (and ESRD) s to obstructive
nephropathy, and an increased risk of bladder cancer.
Investigations
• Typical live ova on urine microscopy (centrifuge sample to improve
yield).
• FBC (eosinophilia), U&E, SCr, eGFR, LFTS.
• Serology: anti-schistosomal antibodies may be positive 4–8 weeks after
exposure. They will not differentiate between past and active disease.
However, a positive test in an individual who does not live in an
endemic area can be helpful.
• PCR for schistosome DNA is highly sensitive and speciﬁc on stool and
urine samples, if available.
• Plain KUB may demonstrate calciﬁcation.
• USS to exclude obstruction—treatment will often improve anatomical
abnormalities in schistosomiasis, unlike GUTB (b p. 696).
• Cystoscopy may show a nodular or polypoid lesions 9 ulcerating
haemorrhagic cystitis.

Schistosomal glomerulonephritis
Complicates hepatosplenic disease in 710% patients with S. mansoni (less
common with other species). Although the worms have developed strategies to evade immune recognition, if these are incomplete, an antibody
response may result in circulating immune complex formation. These

SCHISTOSOMIASIS

become trapped in glomeruli (esp. if liver ﬁbrosis has caused poor immune
complex clearance), causing inﬂammation and glomerulonephritis.
Presents as proteinuria (often nephrotic range), haematuria, and
impaired renal function. Several histological variants are recognized on
kidney biopsy, including mesangioproliferative, MCGN-like, and FSGS.
Co-infection with Salmonella may lead to a diffuse proliferative lesion
(presents as the acute nephritic syndrome). Cryoglobulinaemia (usually
concomitant hep C) and secondary AA amyloidosis are also possibilities.

Treatment
African Association of Nephrology (AFRAN) classiﬁcation (classes I–V):
• Classes I and II respond to anti-helminthic therapy.
• Classes III–V progress to ESRD in spite of therapy (75% progress to
advanced CKD or RRT over 4–6 years).
• Praziquantel 40mg/kg PO stat (80–90% cure rate).
• If S. japonicum, i dose to 60mg/kg in two divided doses.
• There may be some resolution of urinary tract lesions in urinary
schistosomiasis (esp. if little ﬁbrosis). However, strictures may require
urological intervention.
• Schistosomal glomerulonephritis responds poorly.

CHAPTER 8

The kidney in systemic disease

Malaria
Introduction
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted via Anopheles mosquitoes. It is endemic in many parts of the world, affecting 300–500 million people annually and causing 1–3 million deaths/year. Previously only
P. falciparum and P. malariae were associated with renal disease, but AKI
and glomerulopathy are now recognized with P. vivax.
AKI due to malaria can occur as part of multi-organ failure or as an isolated complication. The causes of AKI in malaria are complex and multiple.
Histological ﬁndings include ATN (most frequent), interstitial nephritis,
and a proliferative glomerulonephritis.
Glomerulopathy s to malaria is most common in childhood and adolescence, with glomerular lesions found post-mortem in 720% of patients
with falciparum malaria.

AKI 2° to malaria
AKI complicates P. falciparum malaria in 1–4% cases but is more common in non-immune travellers (725%). If severe, >50% will require renal
support, and mortality is 710% (partly due to non-availability of RRT).
Although P. vivax is usually considered a benign parasite with a low mortality rate, it can rarely cause severe disease with AKI.
Pathogenesis
Proposed mechanisms include immune-mediated glomerular injury,
hyperbilirubinaemia (l ATN), alterations in the renal and systemic
haemodynamics, cytoadherence of infected RBCs (l capillary obstruction), mononuclear cell inﬁltration (l inﬂammatory cytokine release), and
increased release of both reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide.
In addition, dehydration, haemolysis (l haemoglobinuria), DIC, and
rhabdomyolysis may all contribute.
Signs and symptoms
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, malaise, headache, confusion, fevers, myalgia,
jaundice (775%), and haemoglobinuria (blackwater fever). d BP, peripheral
vasodilatation, anaemia, and hepatosplenomegaly.
Investigations
Urinalysis and uPCR (proteinuria usually <1g/24h). FBC (haemolytic anaemia), d Plt (70%). Thick and thin blood ﬁlm for parasitaemia (usually >5%).
Haptoglobins. DIC (APTT, INR, D-dimers). U&E (d Na+ in >50%), SCr,
CK, LFTs (hepatitis in 720%), and serum lactate (acidosis common).
Management
• Manage patients with AKI in high dependency environment.
• RRT may need early initiation, as patients are highly catabolic. In
addition, i K+ can be severe (s to haemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, and
acidosis).
• Supportive blood products, as required.
• Culture blood, and consider empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics
(bacterial superinfection is not uncommon).

MALARIA

• IV quinine loading dose as 20mg/kg (max 1.4g) over 4h, then 10mg/kg
(max 700mg) IV over 4h qds for 7 days, with cardiac monitoring.
• Artemisinin derivatives clear parasitaemia more rapidly, act against
more stages of the parasitic life cycle, and reduce mortality, in
comparison to quinine, but are not widely available. Artesunate 2.4mg/
kg IV ﬁrst dose, followed by 2.4mg/kg at 12 and 24h, followed by
2.4mg/kg once daily for 3 days, then oral therapy, as necessary.
• Doxycycline may be added.
• If the patient has G6PD deﬁciency, seek expert help.
• X The role of exchange transfusion is controversial and reserved for
high-burden parasitaemia. Potential beneﬁts are quicker reduction of
parasitaemia and a decreased risk of severe intravascular haemolysis.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) suggests it should be
considered if parasite density is >10%, with evidence of end-organ
complications.

Glomerular involvement in malaria
Transient nephrotic and nephritic illnesses may be seen during infection
with P. falciparum and P. vivax. These glomerulopathies are reversible—
usually resolving within 2–6 weeks of treatment. The histological lesion
is typically mesangial hypercellularity with mesangial and subendothelial
deposition of IgG, IgM, and C3. Serum complement components may be
reduced s to immune complex formation.
Chronic malarial nephropathy (or quartan malarial nephropathy) is a
different entity. It is the most common form of secondary glomerular
disease in the tropics, causing nephrotic syndrome, mainly in children
and adolescents. It is usually associated with P. malariae, occasionally
P. vivax. The histological lesion is an MCGN-type pattern of injury,
with subendothelial immune complex deposits containing IgG, C3,
and (rarely) malarial antigens. Pathogenesis, particularly the role of the
malarial parasite, is still a matter of signiﬁcant debate.
The renal prognosis is poor. The nephrotic syndrome is
steroid-resistant and generally does not improve with successful eradication of the malarial infection. Progression to ESRD occurs within
5 years.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Urinary tract infection: introduction
Introduction
The incidence of UTI (including infections of the bladder and kidneys) is
750,000 pmp, making it, by far, the most common disorder of the renal
tract. 50% of ♀ will experience UTI in their lifetime, predominantly cystitis
(usually occurring in a normal urinary tract). 710% of post-menopausal ♀
and 70.5% of younger sexually active ♀ will have a UTI each year.
A second infection is common in women who have had one UTI, but
only 3–5% will develop recurrent UTIs (b p. 710). In men and children,
UTI is rare and almost always associated with urinary tract abnormalities
that require further investigation (b p. 708). Although serious morbidity
from UTI is usually low, renal scarring can result from sporadic or recurrent infections. Bacteraemia from a UTI can be a life-threatening medical
emergency. UTI in pregnancy is discussed on b p. 842.

Deﬁnitions
Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the isolation of a signiﬁcant bacterial count in
an asymptomatic patient (b p. 710). Uncomplicated UTI is a symptomatic
bladder infection (cystitis) in a ♀ with a normal urinary tract. Complicated
UTI is a symptomatic infection of any part of the urinary tract in a ♀ with a
functional or structural urinary abnormality. Re-infection is a recurrent UTI
with the same or different organism, following clearance of the original
UTI. Relapse refers to a recurrent UTI with the same organism that has
not been adequately cleared.

Pathogenesis
In ♀, the pathogens responsible for UTI are found in the colonic ﬂora.
Subsequent UTI is usually ascending, i.e. after perivaginal, perineal, and
transurethral colonization, often triggered by intercourse. Lactobacilli,
found as commensals in the vagina, prevent urinary pathogens from colonizing the perineum—changes in the vaginal pH, use of spermicides, or
antibiotic treatment may lead to failure of this defense mechanism.

Host factors predisposing to UTI
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Female sex.
Sexual intercourse.
Use of spermicides.
Urinary stasis or incomplete bladder emptying.
Comorbidities, esp. diabetes mellitus.
Institutionalized patient.
i Age (ld oestrogen + vaginal pH).
Eradication of vaginal commensal organisms (see ‘Pathogenesis’).
Urinary tract stones.
Urinary catheter.
Highly concentrated urine (>800mOsmol/kg) or failed urinary
acidiﬁcation (pH >5).
• Non-secretion of certain blood group antigens (allows bacteria with
speciﬁc adhesins to recognize urothelial cells).

URINARY TRACT INFECTION: INTRODUCTION

Some women express an inherited and unique receptor on the urothelium
that aids the binding of E. coli. Also, E. coli that expresses type P ﬁmbriae
(pili), an adhesin that promotes bacterial attachment to the urothelium, is
particularly likely to cause pyelonephritis. There are many other factors
that have been suggested to contribute to bacterial virulence.

Bacteriology
Uncomplicated UTI
• Escherichia coli (70–90%).
• Coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. saprophyticus) (5–20%).
• Klebsiella spp. (1–2%).
• Enterococci (1–2%).
• Proteus mirabilis (1–2%).
• Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Staphylococcus aureus, group B streptococci (all <1% each).
Complicated UTI
• E. coli remains the most common, but Proteus, Klebsiella, Citrobacter
spp., enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and
group B streptococci account for a higher proportion.

Symptoms and signs
Cystitis or lower UTI
Dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia, suprapubic pain, or tenderness.
Offensive urine or frank haematuria. Ask about previous episodes of UTI,
recent antibiotic use, pre-existing LUTS (b p.78), and, sensitively, about
new sexual partners and spermicidal use. Vaginal irritation 9 discharge
makes UTI less likely (vaginitis more so). 2 In the elderly, UTI may present
as confusion 9 incontinence.
Pyelonephritis or upper UTI
Fever, chills, night sweats, rigors. Nausea, vomiting. Loin pain, costovertebral (renal) angle tenderness. May be systemically unwell, with progression
to SIRS and shock a possibility.
2 In immunocompromised (and children), all of the listed symptoms/signs
may be absent—so maintain a high index of suspicion, esp. if unexplained
fever.

Diagnosis
• A pure growth of a urinary pathogen:
• ≥105 cfu/mL urine remains the standard.
• However, at this cut-off, 30–50% of UTI will escape diagnosis. So, in
addition, consider:
• ≥102–5 cfu/mL: in young women with suspected uncomplicated
cystitis, children, ♂, or if pyelonephritis possible.
• Bacteriuria ≥102 cfu/mL associated with signiﬁcant pyuria
(9 symptoms) is usually signiﬁcant.
• Bacteriuria in the absence of pyuria almost always represents
contamination.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Urinary tract infection: investigations
and treatment
Investigations
• Dipstick urine: positive leucocyte esterase 9 nitrite reductase. Positive
predictive value of 766% and a negative predictive value of 790%.
May be modest haematuria or proteinuria. In low-risk cases, no further
investigation is needed if positive dipstick with characteristic symptoms.
• Clean-catch MSU for microscopy at x40 magniﬁcation (i.e.
high-powered ﬁeld), pyuria (>104 WCC per mL urine) 9 organisms
(see b p. 707). WCC casts strongly suggest pyelonephritis.
• Culture: sample should be cultured within 2h of sampling. If not
possible, store at 4* (for <48h). Repeat urine culture to conﬁrm
eradication post-treatment is not recommended.
• A pregnancy test should be undertaken if appropriate.
• If suspected pyelonephritis: i WCC, i CRP, SCr, U&E.
• Imaging is only required in complicated cases, e.g. fever persists >48h
despite therapy, clinical deterioration, poorly controlled diabetes,
immune compromised, systemic sepsis, recurrent episodes, stone former.
• CT with contrast has become the investigation of choice and has
superseded IVU. Stones should be excluded on the non-contrast
images. CT will identify changes on renal parenchymal perfusion,
obstruction, perinephric collections or ﬂuid, and abscesses.
• USS is also useful and preferred by many clinicians as an initial
investigation, as it does not involve radiation or contrast, and it will
exclude obstruction with hydronephrosis. However, a negative USS
does not exclude pyelonephritis, and ureteric abnormalities will be
missed. Pre- and post-micturition images of the bladder to exclude
incomplete bladder emptying should be performed.
• 99mTc-DMSA ﬁndings are non-speciﬁc, but it has a role in children.
• In ♂, assess the prostate size and bladder emptying with urodynamic
ﬂow studies (b p. 760).
• Cystoscopy may be indicated in those at risk for bladder or prostate
cancer, as well as those with evidence of impaired bladder emptying
who may beneﬁt from urethral dilatation.

URINARY TRACT INFECTION: INVESTIGATIONS AND TREATMENT

Treatment
Antibiotic selection and duration of therapy varies widely. Prescribing
choice should always be informed by local antimicrobial resistance patterns. In general, broad-spectrum agents, such as co-amoxiclav, quinolones, and cephalosporins, should be avoided, as they increase the risk of
antibiotic resistance (as well as Clostridium difﬁcile).
Uncomplicated lower UTI (cystitis)
For empirical therapy:
• Either: short-course (3 days) therapy:
• Trimethoprim 200mg bd (or co-trimoxazole 960mg bd).
• Or: longer-course (7–10 days) therapy:
• Nitrofurantoin 100mg bd (not in renal impairment).
• If second-line treatment is necessary, e.g. hypersensitivity reaction, side
effects, failure of ﬁrst-line treatment, then urine culture with sensitivity
testing is recommended.
• Options:
• Fluoroquinolones, such as ciproﬂoxacin 500mg bd or levoﬂoxacin
250mg od.
• Oral cephalosporins often offer a useful alternative.
• Fosfomycin 3g single dose.
• Ampicillin/amoxicillin are less effective at eradicating vaginal and
peri-urethral colonization.
• Encourage high ﬂuid intake, e.g. >2L/day.
Complicated lower UTI
• 2 At-risk patients: ♂, recent urinary tract instrumentation, recent
antibiotics, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressed, obstruction,
structural abnormalities, functional abnormality (e.g. neurogenic
bladder, reﬂux), foreign body, renal failure.
• Empirical therapy should be started immediately (e.g.
ﬂuoroquinolones for 7–10 days), but antibiotic therapy should
always be tailored against urine culture and sensitivity results.
• Pregnant ♀ (b p. 842).
• In the immunocompromised, consider additional single-dose
aminoglycoside (e.g. gentamicin 3–5mg/kg IVI or IMI). For UTI in
renal transplant recipients, see b p. 438.

2 Acute pyelonephritis
• Initial assessment will need to determine if treatment can be
outpatient-based or whether admission is necessary (l nausea and
vomiting, systemically unwell).
• Suggestions (tailor against culture results):
• Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciproﬂoxacin 250–500mg bd PO) or
levoﬂoxacin 250mg od for 14 days.
• Alternatives include co-amoxiclav IVI, then PO, or a
third-generation cephalosporin IVI, then PO for 14 days.
• Consider additional single-dose gentamicin 3–5mg/kg IVI.
• Rehydration with 0.9% NaCl.
• Appropriate analgesia and antiemetics.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Urinary tract infection: miscellaneous
Asymptomatic bacteriuria
• Common (1% in young ♀ vs 720% in ♀ aged >80. Rare in ♂).
• Deﬁnition (♀): isolation of the same organism (≥105 cfu/mL) in two
consecutive urine samples.
• Patient has no symptoms attributable to the urinary tract (by
deﬁnition!).
• Associated with: sexual activity, diabetes, institutionalization, impaired
urinary voiding, indwelling device (e.g. catheter or stent).
• 2 Important in:
• Pregnancy (b p. 842).
• Those about to undergo urinary tract instrumentation (l mucosal
bleeding, overt UTI, and bacteraemia).
• These are the only two groups where screening is appropriate, and
treatment is not advocated outside these circumstances.

Recurrent UTIs
Deﬁned as >4 culture-proven UTIs in a year. A recurrence is not the same
as a relapse (deﬁned as return of symptoms with a culture of the same
organism, following an initial UTI). Relapse can be treated with a prolonged (e.g. 2–4 weeks’) course of antibiotics.
• Establish whether related to intercourse.
• Advise to increase ﬂuid intake >2L/day, with frequent voiding.
• Double voiding may help bladder emptying.
• Spermicides or spermicide-coated condoms should be discouraged.
• Consider topical oestrogen creams (per vagina) in post-menopausal ♀.
• Cranberry juice: in vitro data conﬁrm cranberry juice inhibits adherence of
uropathogens to urothelial cells. Conﬂicting results in clinical studies (may
be dependent on ‘dose’ and mode of administration (tablet vs drink).
• X Probiotics: alter vaginal ﬂora to inhibit colonization by
uropathogens. Results from clinical trials to date have been
disappointing.
• Consider investigations for an abnormal urinary tract: imaging
(including bladder emptying), cystoscopy.
• For prophylaxis, see Box 9.1.
The following do not predispose to UTI: wiping patterns, voiding after
intercourse, personal hygiene, showering, hot baths or saunas, tights or
synthetic fabrics.

Catheter-related UTI
• Bacteriuria occurs in 3–10% of patients with an indwelling catheter/per
day catheterized. There is no role for screening asymptomatic patients.
• Treatment is generally only required if signiﬁcant local symptoms or
systemic upset. If required, continue antimicrobials for a minimum of
7 days, and remove the catheter, if possible, as a surface bioﬁlm will
otherwise act as a reservoir of infection.
• Diagnosis: cultures positive for >105 cfu/mL and heavy pyuria (although
pyuria is not always a reliable marker of infection in this context).
• Prevention is best: avoid catheterization or remove as soon as possible.

URINARY TRACT INFECTION: MISCELLANEOUS

Box 9.1 Prophylaxis
Prophylactic antibiotics are an option if no remediable underlying cause
is identiﬁed and can reduce recurrence rates by 95%. Ensure any current
infection is successfully eradicated ﬁrst. The optimum antibiotic regimen
has not been established.
• If UTI related to sexual activity: trimethoprim 200mg, co-trimoxazole
480mg, or nitrofurantoin 50mg after intercourse.
• For others, offer nightly low-dose prophylaxis in a monthly
rotation as: trimethoprim 100mg, then nitrofurantoin 50mg, then
cefalexin 250mg. Alternatives include co-trimoxazole 480mg or
amoxicillin 250mg.
• These may be adapted, according to previous culture results.
• Give prophylaxis for 1 year initially.
• Warn against the potential development of oral or vaginal candida
and how this may be treated if it occurs.

Related disorders
2 Emphysematous pyelonephritis
Caused by gas-forming Enterobacteriaceae and occurs predominantly in
diabetic patients (90%). Presents as severe pyelonephritis. Gas usually visible on KUB or CT. Mortality is high (20–60%), but broad-spectrum antibiotics and urgent nephrectomy signiﬁcantly improve outcomes.
Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis
A chronic unilateral pyelonephritis associated with renal calculi or
obstruction and causing widespread parenchymal destruction. More
common in diabetes mellitus. Presents as fever, nausea, anorexia, weight
loss, ﬂank pain, and systemic upset. The affected kidney is often palpable. Urinalysis and MSU for M,C+S conﬁrm UTI (usually Proteus spp. or
other Gram-negative organism). CT conﬁrms diagnosis. Treat initially as
for pyelonephritis. Relapse is common. A nephrectomy is often required.
May be confused for renal cell carcinoma.
Acute bacterial prostatitis
Probably caused by reﬂux of infected urine into the prostatic ducts.
Presents with symptoms of lower tract infection, associated with fever
and, occasionally, with urethral obstruction. The prostate is swollen and
tender on DRE. Urine culture will often demonstrate pyuria and bacteriuria. Treatment: ﬂuoroquinolones (prolonged ≥4 weeks).
Interstitial cystitis
A sterile inﬂammatory cystitis, presenting in ♀ aged >40 (often with a
prior history of recurrent UTI). Symptoms include frequency, dysuria, and
(often disabling) suprapubic or pelvic pain. May be associated with sterile
pyuria. Sensitivity to intravesical potassium solutions may help to conﬁrm
the diagnosis. Cystoscopy and bladder biopsy may show characteristic
inﬂammation and ulceration. Treatment can be difﬁcult. Tricyclic antidepressants can help with neuropathic pain. Oral (or intravesical) pentosan
polysulfate sodium is efﬁcacious in some cases.

712

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Reﬂux nephropathy
Reﬂux nephropathy (RN) is a progressive lesion caused by repeated infections in the kidneys and almost always develops in childhood in the context of an abnormal urinary tract. The long-term renal scarring and CKD
resulting from this early injury is called RN or chronic pyelonephritis. 5–12%
of the ESRD population in the developed world is generally considered to
have RN (although the diagnosis is often presumed in a patient presenting
with scarred kidneys).
The main anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract is usually vesicoureteric reﬂux (VUR), but RN can also occur with incomplete bladder
emptying or outﬂow obstruction.
The ureter inserts obliquely through the bladder wall, forming a compressible tunnel that acts as a one-way valve to prevent reﬂux of urine.
A short or incompetent tunnel may allow reﬂux of urine into the ureters,
as the bladder contracts during micturition. Superinfection is the norm. By
late childhood, the bladder base thickens; the ureteric tunnel elongates,
and free reﬂux generally no longer occurs.

Vesicoureteric reﬂux
• Genetically heterogeneous but:
• Affects 0.1–1% of newborns.
• Underlies 12–50% of children with a proven UTI.
• Is almost always present in children with proven renal scarring.
• It may be associated with renal dysplasia and hypoplasia (and 6
childhood i BP, CKD, and ESRD).
• Unilateral or bilateral (unilateral will not cause signiﬁcant CKD).
• Ceases around puberty when anatomical changes mean that free
reﬂux is no longer possible.
• Essentially a radiological diagnosis, classiﬁed grades I–V by severity
(see Table 9.1).
• Surgical correction of incompetent valves offers no beneﬁt over
simple antibiotic prophylaxis and prompt treatment of UTIs in terms
of long-term outcome.
Table 9.1 Classiﬁcation of VUR
Grade I

Reﬂux into ureter, with no dilatation

Grade II

Reﬂux into ureter, pelvis, and calyces, with no dilatation

Grade III

Mild or moderate dilatation of the pelvis
No, or only slight, blunting of the fornices

Grade IV

Moderate dilatation and/or tortuosity of the ureter and
moderate dilatation of the pelvis and calyces.
Complete obliteration of the sharp angles of the fornices but
maintenance of the papillary impressions of most calyces

Grade V

Gross dilatation and tortuosity of the ureter, pelvis, and calyces
Papillary impressions are no longer seen in the majority of calyce

REFLUX NEPHROPATHY

RN: a new paradigm
More recently, however, the belief that reﬂux alone directly leads to
renal scarring has been questioned. It is thought that VUR may simply be
a marker of abnormal renal development, including renal dysplasia and
hypoplasia. It is proposed that it is this abnormal renal development that
predisposes to CKD. Evidence: renal lesions may be present antenatally
in the absence of infection, and treatment of childhood VUR-associated
UTIs often does not alter long-term renal outcomes.
RN may 6 be better thought of as the sequelae of a developmental
abnormality (renal hypoplasia or dysplasia), with associated VUR.

Clinical presentation
• In children, all UTIs should be subsequently evaluated for RN.
• In adulthood, the presentation is usually with unexplained CKD. i BP
(750% of adults). Proteinuria is low grade (<1g/day) unless progressive
CKD (s FSGS).
• Adults with UTI and a NORMAL renal tract will not develop RN.
• Pregnant women with RN may develop UTIs, functional deterioration,
or i BP 9 pre-eclampsia and should be referred for specialist care.

Investigations
•

99m

Tc-DMSA scintigraphy (DMSA is taken up in functioning renal
tubules) will demonstrate renal scars as areas of reduced uptake.
• IVU: classically renal scarring (as parenchymal loss) and ‘clubbed
calyces’. Localized papillary scars do not take up contrast well, blunting
the normal appearance of the renal calyx.
• In children, the gold standard for diagnosis of VUR is a micturating
cystogram, although isotope cystography (which avoids a urinary
catheter) is often preferred, particularly in older children (b p.54–6).

Pathology
Kidney biopsies are rarely undertaken, as kidneys are often small at presentation. Characteristic appearances are chronic tubulointerstitial scars,
with dilated, atrophied tubules and often an inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrate.
Secondary hyperﬁltration injury develops over time, with compensatory hypertrophy of unaffected segments, vessel changes, and glomerular
collapse and sclerosis.

Management (in adults)
Given that reﬂux has ceased and that there is no new scar formation in
adulthood, treatment is aimed at preventing CKD progression.
• Treat i BP and proteinuria, with ACE-I or ARB as ﬁrst line (target BP
<130/80mmHg).
• Treat any new urine infections vigorously.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Congenital abnormalities of the kidney
and urinary tract
Introduction
A group of well-recognized developmental anomalies that are now collectively referred to as congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary
tract (CAKUT) (see Table 9.2). Variations of these disorders are identiﬁable in 1 in 500 antenatal USS, and they are responsible for 730% of all
fetal abnormalities. Prior to routine antenatal scanning, these conditions
were diagnosed when symptoms developed in childhood and, occasionally, adult life. They account for the majority of CKD (and ESRD) in infants.
Various gene mutations have been described, including SALL1, SIX1,
HNF-1B, and PAX2. The conditions appear polygenic, with variable
penetrance.

Clinical evaluation
Thorough post-natal assessment, as for any congenital abnormality. This
should include maternal drug use (prescribed or recreational), family history, and a comprehensive physical examination (targeted at important
dysmorphic features, such as ear malformations, hearing loss, optic nerve
colobomas, digital anomalies, and abnormal external genitalia).

Investigation
Suspected urinary tract abnormalities typically require a post-natal USS
and micturating cystography. MAG3 renography or DMSA scanning will
determine split function. Cystoscopy may be necessary. It is important
to appreciate that several abnormalities may be present together (e.g.
VUR in an ectopic kidney). Genetic testing may be possible for several
CAKUT-associated syndromes, e.g. CHARGE (Colobomas, Heart defects,
Atresia choanae, Retardation of growth and development, Genital abnormalities and hypogonadism, Ear abnormalities 9 deafness).
Table 9.2 Important CAKUT disorders
Abnormality

Features

Renal agenesis

The ureteric bud fails to communicate with the metanephric
blastema in 1st trimester. Often associated with other
malformations, including VUR, and with genetic syndromes
(e.g. Potter’s syndrome l bilateral renal agenesis). Outcomes
depend on these associations.

Renal ectopia

Failure of renal ascent during embryogenesis. The kidneys are
usually abnormally shaped and often functionally impaired.
760% are pelvic kidneys.
Often associated with ureteric abnormalities.

Renal fusion

>90% are horseshoe kidneys where there is fusion of the lower
poles by a narrow isthmus (usually comprises functioning renal
tissue). The kidneys are sited more caudally than normal. Often
missed on USS. Commoner in ♂ (although associated with
Turner’s syndrome in ♀).

CAKUT

Table 9.2

(Continued)

Abnormality

Features
Usually asymptomatic but may be associated with haematuria,
abdominal pain, abdominal mass, UTI, i BP. Concomitant
ureteric abnormalities often present (esp. PUJ and VUJ
obstruction). Associated with nephrolithiasis and malignancy
(TCC in adults, Wilm’s tumour in children).
Crossed fusion ectopia occurs when one kidney crosses the
midline and lies in an abnormally rotated position. Associated
with ureteric and cloacal abnormalities.
Duplication
The development of an accessory ureteric bud causes a duplex
kidney and collecting system. May be complete or partial. If
complete, there are two renal moieties with separate collecting
systems and ureters. These may drain aberrantly, e.g. into
the vagina or posterior urethra (l reﬂux and obstruction). If
incomplete, the ureters usually join along their length.
Common 71% normal population. Familial. Associated with
chromosomal abnormalities, e.g. Turner’s syndrome.
Usually asymptomatic.
Multicystic
Failure of the ureteric bud and renal mesenchyme to unite,
dysplastic kidneys resulting in a multiloculated mass, comprising thin-walled
cysts with atresia of the proximal ureter. 2 ♂ > 1 ♀.The
renal tissue is non-functioning.
Renal dysplasia is the term used when there is some
functioning tissue within an abnormal kidney, with the two
conditions part of a spectrum of developmental abnormality.
2 90% are unilateral but may be associated with contralateral
abnormalities, such as VUR in 25%.
Usually involute during childhood (and 6 labelled as a ‘solitary
kidney’ in later life).
No intervention is required unless recurrent UTIs, bleeding or
suspected malignancy. Weak association with i BP.
Polycystic kidneys See b p. 592.
Obstruction
Antenatal renal tract dilatation is present in 1 in 200 antenatal
scans but will resolve spontaneously in 50%. See also posterior
urethral valves, PUJ and VUJ obstruction (b p. 736).
Megaureter
Either primary (majority) or secondary to distal obstruction.
♂ > ♀. Left > right. 25% bilateral.  Urinary sepsis.
Ureterocele
Cystic dilatation of the terminal ureter. Intra- or extravesical
(latter often more problematic, e.g. obstruction).
Triad: deﬁcient or absent anterior abdominal wall musculature,
Prune belly
syndrome (Eagle– bilateral cryptorchidism (empty scrotum), plus urinary tract
Barrett or triad abnormalities (esp. megacystis and megaureter).
syndrome)
Abnormalities in other organ systems in 75%. 95% are ♂.
Genetic basis has not been established. Causes 1–3% of
ESRD. Also associated with renal dysplasia, VUR, PUJ/VUJ
obstruction, abnormally thickened bladder, GI abnormalities
(e.g. malrotation), congenital heart disease, and hip dysplasia.
Cloacal
Failure of development of the urorectal septum in ♀ leads to
abnormality
a single opening of urethra, vagina, and colon. Associated with
obstruction which requires surgical correction.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Nephrolithiasis
Introduction
Urinary tract stones affect 8–15% of people (2 ♂: 1 ♀, typical age 20–
60 years). The incidence is increasing in developed countries. After a single
stone, the likelihood of a second within 7 years is 750% (>75% after a second). However, preventative measures are highly effective in most cases.
Nephrolithiasis refers to stone formation within the renal tubules or
collecting system, although calculi are also commonly found in the ureters and/or bladder. Diffuse parenchymal calciﬁcation with the kidney is
termed nephrocalcinosis (b p.45). In the absence of nephrolithiasis, most
patients with nephrocalcinosis are asymptomatic (and renal function correlates poorly with the degree of calciﬁcation visible on imaging).

Stone formation
Stone formation around a crystal nidus is encouraged when the solubility
of a urinary salt is exceeded in certain situations (termed ‘supersaturation’). These include high solute delivery, concentrated urine (low volume), areas of stasis (anatomically abnormal urinary tract), and an excess
of stone promoters over inhibitors. Supersaturation is dependent on free
ion state, rather than absolute concentration, so will be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the other constituents and characteristics of urine, such as pH.
Aggregation of crystals into stones involves a process of epithelial cell
anchoring within the renal tubules.

Stone composition
An important part of management is to identify stone constituents and any
metabolic predisposition to formation. Stone composition varies, according to geography. In the Mediterranean, >70% are uric acid, whilst, in the
UK and USA, the majority are calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. Both
environmental and genetic factors inﬂuence this distribution.
Stone composition and incidence (UK)
• Calcium oxalate/phosphate: 60–80% (often mixed stones—pure
calcium phosphate stones are uncommon).
• Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) 10–20%
• Uric acid 5–10%

Stone types
Calcium-based stones
• Most are calcium oxalate, either alone or in combination with calcium
phosphate or urate.
• An associated metabolic abnormality (or other predisposing factor)
can be identiﬁed in many patients with recurrent stones, although
some are truly idiopathic.

NEPHROLITHIASIS

• Risk factors (see Table 9.3):
• Excessive excretion of calcium (hypercalciuria), oxalate
(hyperoxaluria), or uric acid (hyperuricosuria). Uric acid crystals
often form the nidus that progresses to a calcium-based stone.
• Factors that cause insolubility, e.g. insufﬁcient citrate excretion
(hypocitraturia). Citrate forms a soluble complex with calcium.
• Low-volume, or concentrated, urine.
• Abnormal urinary tract, e.g. medullary sponge kidney.
• Renal tubular acidosis (b p. 824).

*
An inherited enzyme defect associated with systemic calcium oxalate deposition from
childhood (l cardiomyopathy, bone marrow failure, CKD). Two distinct liver enzyme
defects are described (types I and II). Type II (enzyme: glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate
reductase) tends to be a milder disorder than type I (enzyme: alanine-glyoxalate
aminotransferase).

Uric acid stones
Hyperuricosuria is most commonly associated with the formation of calcium oxalate stones! Pure uric acid stones are less common and are radiolucent on KUB X-rays. Three key factors inﬂuence their formation: low
urine volume, elevated serum uric acid concentration, and low urine pH
(<5.5). Low urine pH results from high animal protein intake and impaired

717

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

ammoniagenesis (l excess secretion of unbuffered H+). An increase in
uric acid stone formation has been seen in parallel with obesity and insulin
resistance (perhaps s to d urine pH).
Struvite stones (‘triple phosphate’ or ‘infection’ stones)
Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stones are typically large
stones associated with urease-producing (6 urea-splitting) bacteria and an
alkaline urine. Urea breakdown produces excess ammonium and hydroxyl
ions, a rise in urinary pH, and a decrease in phosphate solubility—thus
encouraging the precipitation of insoluble magnesium ammonium phosphate. These stones can act as a reservoir for further infection and can
rapidly expand to ﬁll much of the collecting system (termed ‘staghorn
calculi’ because of their characteristic appearance on imaging).
Many common bacteria are urease producers, particularly Proteus (others: Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Yersinia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter, Serratia, and Ureaplasma urealyicum). Note: E. coli does
not produce urease.
Risk factors: ♀ > ♂ (s to i incidence of UTI), long-term catheterization, urinary stasis (e.g. neurogenic bladder).
Antibiotic therapy (often long-term) and urological intervention, such as
nephrolithotomy or open surgery, are usually required (although surgery
may not always be possible, as patients are often complex with multiple
comorbidities). Eradication of infection can be extremely difﬁcult. Any
available stone material should be cultured for antibiotic sensitivities.

Distal renal tubular acidosis (b p. 824)
• Characterized by impaired distal tubular excretion of H+, a
non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, and an alkaline urine.
• Acidosis causes:
• Skeletal release of calcium and phosphate (l i urinary excretion
of both).
• i citrate reabsorption in the proximal tubule.
• High urinary pH + hypocitraturia + i urinary excretion of Ca2+ and
PO4l a ‘perfect storm’ for calcium phosphate precipitation.
• Nephrocalcinosis is not uncommon, in addition to nephrolithiasis.
Stone prevention: sodium bicarbonate and potassium citrate (correct
metabolic acidosis and increase urinary citrate excretion). Avoid urine
pH >6.5, as this encourages calcium phosphate precipitation. Large
doses are often required.

Bladder stones
Usually arise in abnormal bladders. Predisposing factors include
post-surgical reconstruction, UTI, bladder diverticulae, neurogenic bladder 9 bladder outﬂow obstruction.

NEPHROLITHIASIS

Cystine
• Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder, causing a tubular
defect in the uptake of dibasic amino acid (cystine, ornithine,
arginine, and lysine).
• There are two sources of cystine: (i) dietary and (ii) synthesized from
methionine.
• Most cystine is reabsorbed in the renal tubules, with only 720mg per
day excreted in the urine under normal circumstances.
• In cystinuria, failure of uptake leads to excretion of >250mg/day.
• Cystine is poorly soluble, so this larger amount inevitably leads to
insoluble crystal formation and stone development.
• Autosomal inheritance was ﬁrst described in the 1950s. Initially,
three types were proposed (types I–III). However, this terminology
is now less popular, as types II and III have proved difﬁcult to
differentiate. The type II/III form has a more complex mode of
inheritance (described as ‘incompletely recessive’). Clinically, even
carriers of type II/III cystinuria may be stone formers.
• The genes (so far) associated with type I and types II/III are SLC3A1
and SLC7A9, respectively, with multiple mutations identiﬁed.
Although available, genetic testing is not in routine clinical use.
• Note: avoid cysteine/cystine confusion. Methionine is an essential
amino acid. It can be converted to cysteine in the body. Two cysteine
molecules then combine together (via a strong disulphide bond) to
form one cystine molecule (hence cystine = ‘dimeric’ or ‘dibasic’).
• When cystine stones are broken with a laser, they give off a
characteristic sulphuric rotten egg odour (the disulphide bond is
broken, and sulphur is released).
• Cystinuria should be suspected in all childhood stone formers.
• The disorder usually presents during a patient’s teens or 20s, often
with multiple and bilateral stones.
• Management:
• Maintain high urine volumes (b p. 722).
• Lower urinary pH (with potassium citrate) (b p. 723).
• Restrict sodium intake (reduces calciuria) (b p. 722).
• The precursor of cystine (methionine) is an essential amino acid, so
complete dietary exclusion is not possible, but restriction, combined
with reduced animal protein intake, is desirable (an excellent recipe
book is available free at M http://www.cystinuriauk.co.uk).
• Drug therapy is required in only a minority of patients.
• Mechanism: combine with cystine (at the disulphide bond) and
increase solubility.
• Tiopronin (alpha mercaptopropionylglycine) is the most
commonly used, as it has fewer side effects than older
alternatives. A typical regimen is 1,000mg/day in three divided
doses (depending on urinary cystine levels and tolerability).
Unlicensed in the UK but often used under specialist supervision.
• Penicillamine; generally less well tolerated. Typical regimen: 1–3g/
day in divided doses.
• X Captopril: if others unsuitable. Efﬁcacy uncertain.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Stone disease: evaluation
Clinical presentation
The clinical presentation of stone disease will vary, according to stone
type, location, and size—ranging from small, asymptomatic, stones
through to large infected and obstructing staghorn calculi.
Pain (b p. 724), haematuria (macroscopic and microscopic), infection
(may be relapsing), and obstruction (l AKI if single functioning kidney)
are the key clinical considerations. Progressive CKD is also possible from
recurrent obstruction, infection, and renal interstitial damage (s to the
ﬁbrosis incited by microcrystals).
Who to evaluate?
In patients presenting with a ﬁrst urinary stone, detailed metabolic investigation is not usually justiﬁed or cost-effective. However, that is not to
say that no evaluation should be undertaken. A basic assessment (history,
physical examination, limited dietary assessment, limited blood testing,
urinalysis, urine culture, and appropriate imaging) should be undertaken
in all cases, with a more thorough metabolic evaluation (e.g. detailed 24h
urine testing and comprehensive dietetic review) reserved for all recurrent stone formers and those known to have non-calcium-based stones.
Where stone material is available, it should always be sent for analysis.
• History:
• Age at ﬁrst onset (younger age makes a metabolic abnormality,
such as cystinuria or primary hyperoxaluria, more likely).
• Number and frequency of stones to date (and previous
interventions, such as lithotripsy, undertaken).
• Site (recurrence at same site suggests a urinary tract abnormality).
• Family history.
• Stone type (if known). Non-calcium stones mandate closer scrutiny.
• Associated urinary tract infection.
• Relevant systemic disease (e.g. Crohn’s disease, hypercalcaemic
disorder, obesity, and insulin resistance (uric acid stones)).
• Drug history:
• Calcium stones: loop diuretics, calcium supplements, antacids,
vitamin D preparations, corticosteroids, theophylline,
acetazolamide.
• Uric acid stones: salicylates, probenecid.
• Crystalluria: indinavir, nelﬁnavir (both antiretrovirals), and
triamterene can cause crystalluria as a precursor to stone formation.
• Diet (b p. 723).
• Lifestyle: those who restrict their ﬂuid intake to avoid inconvenient
bathroom breaks, e.g. taxi drivers, surgeons. Exercise intensity.
• Obvious systemic predisposition, e.g. gouty tophi, spinal injury with
bladder dysfunction.
• Urinalysis:
• Microscopic haematuria. Proteinuria. Leucocytes and nitrites.
• Urinary pH:
• Usually high if struvite or calcium phosphate stones.
• Usually low if uric acid or calcium oxalate stones.

STONE DISEASE: EVALUATION

• Urine speciﬁc gravity: a high reading on a random sample suggests
inadequate ﬂuid intake.
• Urine microscopy for crystals (b p.28).
• MSU for M,C+S (? concomitant infection).
• Blood tests: U&E, bicarbonate, SCr, calcium (and PTH if calcium
elevated), phosphate, serum urate.
• Stone analysis if possible. This is highly desirable—patients should be
encouraged to retrieve stones.
• Urinary stone screen (b see below).
• Imaging (b see below).

Urinary values for 24-hour ‘stone screen’
Ensure that the collection is adequate. Urine creatinine of >88μmol/
kg (10mg/kg) in ♀ and 132μmol/kg (15mg/kg) in ♂ implies a complete
sample.
Collect stone screen in acidiﬁed container for all investigations listed,
except urinary uric acid which requires a plain container. Two 24h collections may be required to alleviate intrapatient variability. The collection should be undertaken on a typical day with a typical diet.
Optimal ranges:
• Volume 2–2.5L.
• Calcium <0.1mmol/kg/day (4mg/kg/day).
• Oxalate <0.36mmol/day (40mg/day).
• Uric acid <4.4mmol/day (750mg/day).
• Citrate >1.67mmol/day (320mg/day).
• Phosphate <35mmol/day (1,100mg/day).
• Sodium <3,000mg (130mmol/day).
• Cystine negligible (can 6 be measured on a spot sample).
Some specialist laboratories may also be able to provide supersaturation
analysis (the ratio between ion activity product and its solubility product).

Imaging in nephrolithiasis
2 Calcium-containing or struvite stones are radio-opaque, while uric
acid and cystine stones are radiolucent, i.e. not visible on a plain X-ray.
However, they will be visible as an acoustic shadow on USS and as a ﬁlling
defect on contrast CT or IVU.
• CT-KUB offers the single best test. It can be rapidly performed, is
more sensitive and speciﬁc than an IVU, and avoids the administration
of contrast (although radiation dose is higher). A subsequent CT
contrast study may help to identify an underlying urinary tract
abnormality.
• Plain KUB allows monitoring of radio-opaque stones.
• IVU offers an alternative if CT unavailable.
• USS may be helpful if obstruction suspected and is also sensitive for
stones in the renal pelvis but often misses ureteric stones.
• For considerations when stones occur in pregnancy, see b p. 860.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Stone disease: management
Prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis
General measures:
• Consider a specialist referral. Attendance at a stone clinic has been
shown to reduce stone recurrence, independent of other factors!
• Increase ﬂuid intake for daily UO >2.5L/day. Urine should appear
clear, not dark and concentrated. Advise to:
• Drink a large glass of water at speciﬁc times during the day, e.g.
upon waking, arriving at work, etc.
• Drink a glass of fruit juice with breakfast.
• Keep a large bottle of water at their workplace and sip from it
regularly throughout the day.
• Drink a glass of water each hour, on the hour.
• Add slices of lemon, lime, or orange to water. It improves ﬂavour
and helps to alkalinize the urine.
• Drink two full glasses of water at each meal (one before, one after).
• Carry a reﬁllable water bottle everywhere—walking, shopping,
driving, watching television, etc.
• Eat fruits and vegetables (contain a high amount of water).
• Include more liquid and ‘wet’ foods in the diet, e.g. soups, stew,
jellies, etc.
• Drink before bedtime. Aim to provoke nocturia at least once
per night.
• Reduce animal protein intake:
• Protein ingestion li acid formation l reduced urinary citrate
excretion l less citrate available to form a soluble complex with
calcium.
• It also generates sulphate ions that decrease calcium solubility.
• Acidosis also decreases tubular calcium absorption.
• Protein metabolism increases uric acid production and encourages
uric acid stone formation in low pH urine.
• Aim 0.8–1.0g/kg/day animal protein (meat, poultry, ﬁsh, eggs,
cheese, yogurt), and advise regarding non-animal protein substitutes
(lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans, butter beans, baked beans, quorn).
• Reduce Na+ intake <3g/day (<6g/day NaCl).
• Na+ enhances calciuria (partly explaining the increased incidence of
hypercalciuria in hypertensive patients).
• Educate patients to understand salt content labelling on foods.
• Recommend a normal calcium intake of 7700–1,000mg/day.
•  Many patients are erroneously told to reduce calcium ingestion.
This risks osteoporosis (esp. ♀) and may actually promote stone
formation (low Ca2+ intake li oxalate absorption and excretion).
• Calcium supplement supplements should be avoided, however.
• Reduce dietary oxalate (see Table 9.4).
• If uric acid stones, reduce dietary purine intake (see Table 9.4).
• Increase intake of citrus fruits (a source of potassium citrate).
• Avoid excessive vitamin C supplementation (increases urine oxalate).
• Monitor urinary stone screen for efﬁcacy of therapy.

STONE DISEASE: MANAGEMENT

Table 9.4 Dietary sources of oxalate and purine
High oxalate
Greens (e.g. spinach and kale),
green beans, rhubarb, ﬁgs, beetroot,
celery, spring onions, leeks, okra,
cocoa and chocolate, berries
(including strawberries, blackberries,
etc.), plums, kiwi fruit, tangerines,
lemons, tofu, soy milk, nuts, seeds,
tea, coffee

High purine (uric acid)
Meat (particularly viscera, e.g. liver,
kidney, heart), meat extracts (e.g.
stock, broth, or gravy), anchovies,
crab, oily ﬁsh, such as sardines and
mackerel, shrimp, certain vegetables
(including asparagus, cauliﬂower,
peas, spinach, mushrooms), lentils,
kidney beans, beer

Speciﬁc measures
Calcium oxalate/phosphate stones
• If u-Ca2+ normal:
• Potassium citrate 15–30mmoL PO tds.
• Potassium citrate increases urinary citrate and urinary pH. Aim for a
pH of 6.5. Higher might encourage calcium phosphate stones.
• Liquid preparations can be unpalatable, but tablet formulations (e.g.
Urocit®-K wax tablet) are available (although more expensive).
• The potassium salt is favoured over the sodium salt, as the latter
promotes calciuria.
• If u-Ca2+ raised:
• Potassium citrate as for normal + either indapamide 2.5–5mg PO daily
or hydrochlorothiazide 25–50mg PO daily (monitor K+ with both).
• Thiazide diuretics increase tubular Ca2+ reabsorption (note: avoid
triamterene, as it causes crystalluria itself).
• If d K+ develops, add amiloride (for potassium).
• Recheck urinary citrate and calcium excretion after several weeks, and
adjust appropriately.
Hyperoxaluria
• In malabsorption disorders, ensure adequate hydration. Hypocitraturia
and hypokalaemia can occur and should be corrected. Colestyramine
binds fatty acids and prevents their delivery to the colon (where they
would otherwise increase oxalate absorption).
• Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) can be helpful, although large doses may be
required.
• Calcium carbonate 500–1,500mg tds before meals may reduce oxalate
absorption.
• Primary hyperoxaluria can only be cured by liver transplantation.
Struvite stones
Require vigorous eradication of infection; antibiotic therapy is often prolonged, e.g. 3–6 months, directed by cultures and sensitivities.
Cystine stones (see b p. 719).
Hyperuricosuria
Complete dissolution of uric acid stones can often be achieved, using a
combination of high ﬂuid intake, urinary alkalinization (pH >6.5), reduced
dietary purine intake, and, if necessary, allopurinol 100–300mg PO daily.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Acute renal colic
Presentation
The syndrome caused by stone(s) passage down the urinary tract. Typically
♂ aged 20–40. Colicky abdominal pain (2 often very severe), radiating
from loin to groin (especially as the stone moves toward the vesicoureteric junction). Often abrupt onset, with progressive increase in intensity. Nausea and vomiting common. Renal angle tenderness, haematuria
(often macroscopic), dysuria, strangury, frequency 9 symptoms of UTI. 2
Patients may be systemically unwell at presentation, with dehydration and
d BP. Predisposing factors include dehydration and exercise. Renal colic
may also be caused by ureteric clots and papillary necrosis (b p. 585).

Investigations
• Dipstick urine for haematuria (microscopic haematuria is almost
universal) as well as leucocytes and nitrites.
• Urine microscopy for crystals. MSU for M,C+S.
• SCr, U&E, CRP, FBC (2 blood cultures if signs of infection).
• CT-KUB to conﬁrm diagnosis, locate the stone, exclude obstruction,
and predict response to lithotripsy. IVU if CT unavailable. Plain
AXR may reveal radio-opaque stones (780%).  A stone may be an
incidental ﬁnding. Have you considered other causes of pain?

Management
• 3 Infection 9 obstruction are indications for urgent intervention.
• Analgesia: NSAIDs (e.g. diclofenac 75mg IM or via suppository) are
often very effective (use with caution, i.e. correct dehydration; monitor
renal function with prolonged use). Opiates may also be necessary, e.g.
diamorphine 2.5–10mg SC/IM) (with antiemetic, e.g. metoclopramide
10mg IM/IVI or cyclizine 50mg IM).
• Desmopressin can reduce pain in many patients (antidiuretic effect
ameliorates proximal ureteric distension). It acts quickly and has
minimal adverse effects. Usually 1x 40 micrograms dose administered
nasally.
• Oral rehydration. If vomiting, IVI 0.9% NaCl for UO >2L/day. No role
for ‘forced hydration’ to assist stone passage.
• If stone ≤5mm, 770–80% will pass spontaneously. 50% if 5–10mm.
Majority of larger stones will not. Location is important: more distal
stones pass 775% of the time, proximal 725%. Most pass in 1–3 weeks.
• A adrenoceptor blockade, e.g. tamsulosin 400 micrograms od for
4 weeks, has been shown to increase rate of passage (by 730%),
particularly for distal ureteric stones. Termed ‘medical expulsive
therapy’ (MET).
• Proximal ureteric stones <20mm are best treated with ESWL (b
p. 725). ESWL access to stones in the middle and distal ureter may
be restricted by the pelvic bones, and ureteroscopy provides a very
effective alternative. Percutaneous (and rarely open) nephrolithotomy
have excellent results for calculi >20mm or complicated stones.

ACUTE RENAL COLIC

• 2 If associated infection, co-amoxiclav IVI, then PO, or third-generation
cephalosporin IVI, then PO, or ﬂuoroquinolone (e.g. ciproﬂoxacin
250–500mg bd PO). Consider additional single-dose gentamicin 3–5mg/
kg IVI. Discuss with microbiology.
• 3 An obstructed, infected system caused by stones (pyonephrosis)
is an emergency. Septicaemia 9 shock can supervene rapidly.
• Commence IVI antibiotics and ﬂuid resuscitation immediately.
Discuss with urology, and arrange an urgent referral for
percutaneous nephrostomy and drainage (b p. 734).

Surgical management of stone disease: a primer
Surgical management of renal stone disease has changed signiﬁcantly
with the growth of minimally invasive techniques. In general, open surgical techniques have been relegated to second, even third, line.
• Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL):
• Acoustic shock wave energy is delivered under ﬂuoroscopic or
USS guidance. 1,500–2,500 shock waves are delivered during each
session (typically 730min).
• It is an ambulatory procedure but requires analgesia and (often)
IV sedation. It can be repeated at 10–14 day intervals.
• Fragmentation is followed by clearance of fragments. Multiple
large fragments can block the ureter—termed Steinestrasse or
‘Stone Street’. For stones >20mm, a ureteric stent is placed ﬁrst.
• Achieves very good rates of stone clearance for stones ≤20mm.
• ESWL is now ﬁrst-line in most cases, except larger (>10mm),
more distal ureteric stones where ureteroscopy is preferred.
• Success depends on the operator, equipment, stone
characteristics (size, location, type—cystine and calcium oxalate
stones are more difﬁcult to shatter), and patient obesity.
• Contraindications: AAA, pregnancy, bleeding tendency, UTI.
• Side effects: haemorrhage, haematoma, adjacent organ damage.
• Ureteroscopy:
• Increasingly small, ﬂexible ureteroscopes are allowing access to
the entire urinary tract. Stones are shattered, using a holmium
laser, and the fragments can be retrieved.
• More rigid scopes and basket techniques are no longer favoured.
• Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL):
• Suitable for larger or proximal ureteric stones.
• A sheath is passed into the pelvicalyceal system percutaneously
(usually the dorsal calyx of the lower pole, although higher
punctures allow antegrade ureteroscopy).
• Laser or USS is used to fragment the stone or it is removed
under direct vision.
• Also allows chemolysis—the infusion of an alkaline solution to
dissolve stones (usually uric acid). Less commonly used.
• Open surgery is now rarely necessary. Laparoscopic techniques are
increasingly popular.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Obstruction: overview
• 2 Urinary tract obstruction is a common, and potentially reversible,
cause of both acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
• Obstruction leads to delayed urinary transit, an increase in intratract
pressures, and renal dysfunction.
• It will eventually cause dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces. This is
referred to as hydronephrosis.
• Obstruction causes renal failure when bilateral or when it involves a
single functioning kidney.
• Obstruction accounts for 75% of ESRD in those aged >65.

Deﬁnitions
• Obstructive uropathy: the structural or functional changes in the
urinary tract that impede the normal ﬂow of urine. Classiﬁed
according to site, degree, and duration. May be complete or partial.
• Obstructive nephropathy: the kidney disease resulting from impaired
urinary ﬂow and consequent renal parenchymal damage.
• Hydronephrosis: upper tract dilatation. Obstruction is not the only
cause but is the commonest and must always be excluded. 2 May
not always be present in obstruction, particularly in early stage.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Obstruction: pathophysiology
Normal physiology
Urine production is continuous, and it reaches the bladder as a result of
several processes:
• Glomerular ﬁltration pressure.
• Renal tract peristalsis. Pacemaker cells in the renal calyces initiate
contraction of the renal pelvis. Subsequent coordinated ureteric
smooth muscle contraction directs urine toward the bladder.
Pressures reach 20–80cmH2O (resting pressure is 0–5cmH2O).
• Gravity.
• The vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) prevents retrograde ureteric urine
ﬂow during bladder contraction.

Pathophysiology
• There is a relationship between ureteric pressure and renal blood
ﬂow. Following an initial increase in both (minutes), further increases
in ureteric pressure result in a reduction in renal blood ﬂow (hours).
• This mismatch progressively widens, with consequent ischaemic injury.
• Impaired glomerular and tubular function result.
Glomerular
• Proximal tubular pressure rises early.
• This causes a net d in hydraulic pressure gradient across glomerular
capillaries and a signiﬁcant reduction in GFR.
• Afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction (mediated by i angiotensin II and
i thromboxane A2 + d NO and d vasodilator prostaglandins) reduces
both renal plasma ﬂow and glomerular capillary pressure.
• Blood is redirecting away from non-ﬁltering nephrons.
• Ischaemic nephrons release mediators of inﬂammation, leading to
macrophage inﬁltration, interstitial ﬁbrosis, and irreversible injury.
Tubular
• Tubular dysfunction often manifests after the resolution of obstruction.
• Includes reduced urinary concentrating ability (d expression of
both Na+ transporters + aquaporins), abnormal electrolyte handling
(mild Na+ wasting and i K+ excretion), and acidosis (s to abnormal
intercalated cell H+ ATPase activity).
• In lower tract obstruction, the normally protective VUJ is rendered
incompetent, allowing retrograde transmission of pressure.
• Hypertrophy of the ureteric musculature attempts to compensate for
the increased resistance.
• The ureter becomes stretched and tortuous, resulting in ureteric
distension and hydronephrosis. Fibrous bands develop along the length
of the ureter, adding a further element of obstruction that may persist
after the resolution of the original cause.

Histopathology
• Initial changes are of renal enlargement with oedema and pelvicalyceal
dilatation.

OBSTRUCTION: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

• This advances to encompass distal tubular dilatation, proximal tubular
cell atrophy, and, eventually, enlargement of Bowman’s space, with
periglomerular ﬁbrosis.
• Continuing damage is essentially a form of ischaemic injury, with
macrophage-derived TGF-B fuelling progressive, irreversible
tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis.
• Unresolved obstruction eventually causes macroscopic change,
characterized by dilatation of the renal pelvis, ﬂattening of the papillae,
and gradual thinning of the cortex and medulla.

Recovery of renal function
• The prognosis post-relief of obstruction is contingent on antecedent
duration and severity.
• Available clinical and experimental evidence suggests that full
recovery of renal function is possible after complete obstruction
≤7 days’ duration.
• There may be some functional recovery after 4 weeks, but signiﬁcant
permanent renal damage is usually present beyond 6 weeks.
• Dialysis support is likely to be needed during this time.
3 This underlines the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment of
acute obstruction if permanent renal damage is to be avoided.
• The SCr and eGFR may underestimate the extent of parenchymal
damage, with the hyperﬁltration and hypertrophy of remaining
nephrons masking nephron scarring and dropout. This is particularly
relevant to unilateral obstruction where the contralateral kidney
compensates to maintain function.
• In more chronic, or partial, forms of obstruction, renal parenchymal
changes are likely to be well established, so return of renal function
is unpredictable, at best. The renal cortical thickness on ultrasound
(or other imaging) may give some indication of the potential to
salvage GFR, but a degree of CKD is often inevitable.
• However, subsequent progression of CKD is often relatively slow,
providing BP is well controlled.
• Evidence of tubular dysfunction often persists after the relief of
chronic obstruction and can be clinically relevant, e.g. polyuria, mild
salt wasting, and acidosis.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

How to approach obstruction
3 It is vital that obstruction is considered and actively excluded in all
presentations of AKI and many of CKD.
An accurate history may provide clues as to whether the obstruction is
acute/chronic, unilateral/bilateral, congenital/acquired.

Clinical presentation
Symptoms
Depend on the cause and level of obstruction.  Unilateral obstruction
and chronic partial obstruction can be clinically completely silent.
• Loin pain:
• Flank pain suggests upper tract obstruction. Acute ureteric colic can
be severe. It is usually unilateral and may radiate to the ipsilateral
groin (b p. 724).
• 2 Flank pain, fever, and signs of pyelonephritis suggest obstruction
with infection (l requires emergency decompression of the
affected system).
• Pain radiating to the ﬂank during micturition is suggestive of
vesicoureteric reﬂux (b p. 712).
• Pain after high-volume ﬂuid intake (e.g. beer!) occurs in
pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction (b p. 736).
• Retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis may cause backache (b p. 738).
• Haematuria:
• Macroscopic haematuria occurs with calculi and uroepithelial
tumours.
• Changes in urine volume:
• 2 Complete anuria should always suggest obstruction.
• Polyuria can be a feature of partial obstruction.
• Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggest bladder dysfunction or
outﬂow obstruction.
• Obstructive (voiding) symptoms: reduced urinary stream, hesitancy,
interrupted ﬂow, incomplete emptying, acute retention.
• Storage (ﬁlling) symptoms: nocturia, daytime frequency, urgency,
incontinence, dysuria.
• Any patient presenting with CKD 3 or above with signiﬁcant LUTS
warrants a urinary tract ultrasound (including pre-/post-voiding).
• UTI:
• Obstruction l urinary stasis l infection.
• Obstructed urine is difﬁcult to sterilize with antimicrobials.
• A single UTI in a child or an adult ♂ is suspicious and should be
further investigated. Recurrent infections in a ♀ should prompt
the same.
Signs
• Palpable bladder ( you will miss it if you do not look for it!).
• Loin tenderness.
• Flank mass (palpable hydronephrosis in a thin or young patient).

HOW TO APPROACH OBSTRUCTION

• Blood pressure:
• i BP (l mediated via renin or salt and water retention in CKD).
• d BP (l polyuria with salt and water wasting).
• Rectal and pelvic examinations may (often) be necessary.

Investigations
• Urinalysis:
• Haematuria, leucocytes, nitrites.
• Proteinuria, when present, is usually low-grade.
• Bland urine, free of blood or protein, can point toward obstruction
during the investigation of renal impairment, as it makes an intrinsic
renal lesion less likely.
• MSU for M,C+S.
• Electrolytes:
• Mild acidosis, with associated hyperkalaemia.
• Creatinine, eGFR:
• Remember—these can be falsely reassuring in unilateral
obstruction.
• CRP, WCC, blood cultures for infection.
• Consider a PSA in ♂ with marked LUTS (b p. 772).
• Imaging (b p. 732).

731

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Obstruction: imaging
Imaging is fundamental to the accurate diagnosis of the site and cause of
obstruction. Ultrasound is usually ﬁrst-line, but other modalities may be
necessary to further progress management.
2 No single investigation can be considered to have completely excluded
obstruction when clinical suspicion remains high.

Ultrasound (USS)
See Fig. 9.1.
• Portable, rapid, and non-invasive.
• Can measure pelvicalyceal diameter.
• May demonstrate dilated upper ureters.
• No contrast or radiation, so the imaging of choice in patients who
have renal impairment or are pregnant.
• However, USS is operator-dependent, and obstruction (particularly
early) can occur without a dilated system (<35% of patients with proven
obstruction). Moreover, a dilated system demonstrates hydronephrosis,
which is not the same as proving obstruction (see Box 9.2).

Box 9.2 Ultrasound and obstruction: the pitfalls
Obstruction without a dilated system (false negative)
• Hydronephrosis may not be apparent in early (ﬁrst 2–3 days)
obstruction.
• Dilatation may not occur if retroperitoneal tumour or ﬁbrous tissue
encases the kidney.
• ATN may coexist.
• ATN l oligo-anuria l no hydronephrosis develops.
• Partial obstruction may not cause a demonstrable hydronephrosis
(although GFR is still reduced).
Dilated system without obstruction (false positive)
• Anatomical variants: extrarenal pelvis, megaureter (often secondary
to vesicoureteral reﬂux) (b p. 712).
• Pregnancy: progesterone effects on smooth muscle can cause dilated
ureters and pelvis.
• Post obstruction: an abnormal ‘baggy’ system may persist after the
resolution of chronic obstruction. Comparison with previous imaging
will be helpful in this situation.
• Further imaging (CT or isotope renography) may be necessary.

CT
• Highly sensitive for calculi. A non-contrast CT-KUB is now the
investigation of choice for acute ﬂank pain (b p. 724).
• Superior anatomical deﬁnition to USS. More likely to demonstrate site
and nature of obstruction. If clinical ﬁndings and USS equivocal, CT
KUB is most likely to provide the most information on the site and
cause of the obstruction.

OBSTRUCTION: IMAGING

• Particularly helpful for the diagnosis of extrinsic compression and
retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis, as well as the staging of tumours.
• IV contrast improves diagnostic utility,  but take care to reduce
the risk of contrast nephropathy in the presence of renal impairment
(b p. 148).

dilatation. Reproduced with permission from Warrell D, Cox T, Firth J, and Benz EJ
(eds) (2004) Oxford Textbook of Medicine, 4th edn, p.451. Oxford University Press,
Oxford.

Intravenous urography (IVU)
Increasingly redundant. Previously used to determine the level of obstruction through delayed ﬁlms (e.g. 20min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h). However, this is
rarely necessary, and, if desirable, a CT-IVU would generally be preferred.

MRI
• MR urography provides detailed anatomical information.
• Also offers helpful functional information, including renal transit times.
•  No ionizing radiation, but the potential for gadolinium to cause
nephrogenic systemic ﬁbrosis (NSF) restricts its routine use in higher
stages of CKD (b p.51).
• Useful if known contrast allergy.

Isotope renography (with diuretic)
• A DTPA or MAG-3 renogram (b p.54) may show delayed isotope
excretion in the presence of obstruction.
• The addition of a loop diuretic can differentiate between simple
dilatation and true obstruction. Normally, the diuretic, administered
30min after the isotope, would cause prompt washout from the
kidney. Persistence suggests obstruction. Excretion of both kidneys can
be compared.
• Also estimates split function and may contribute to the assessment of
whether attempts to salvage a kidney are likely to be worthwhile.
•  Sensitivity decreases if renal function is signiﬁcantly impaired.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Obstruction: treatment
Overview
2 Effective interdisciplinary communication between nephrology, urology,
and radiology is essential.
Management is directed by: (i) the site, duration, and cause of obstruction;
(ii) the presence of infection; and (iii) the degree of metabolic disturbance.
Treatment goals
• Treat any emergent metabolic or ﬂuid and electrolyte disturbances,
e.g. i K+, pulmonary oedema. This may require dialysis or CRRT; 2
Seek expert help.
• 2 If there is evidence of sepsis (fever, abnormal urinalysis or urine
microscopy, i WCC, i CRP, shock), then take appropriate cultures,
and treat urgently.
• Prompt relief of obstruction to prevent further metabolic disturbance
and protect the kidney(s) from irreversible renal damage.
• If the duration of obstruction is unclear, assume it is acute.
• If a single kidney is obstructed, do not be reassured by preserved
GFR—the obstructed kidney may still need urgent intervention.
• Manage the underlying pathology, e.g. recurrent stones, tumour.
Relief of obstruction—general principles
• Bladder outﬂow obstruction can often be relieved with a urinary
catheter. If this cannot be passed per urethra, a suprapubic catheter
may be necessary.
• In an emergency situation or if infection above the obstruction is
suspected, upper tract obstruction should be relieved through the
placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy under LA.
• Subsequent antegrade stenting of the obstruction through the
nephrostomy may be possible.
• In non-emergency situations and when the patient is ﬁt for GA,
cystoscopic placement of retrograde ureteric stents is an appropriate
approach.
• Urinary catheters and ureteric stents require follow-up and elective
replacement.  Be vigilant for infection or blockage.

Percutaneous nephrostomy
Is it necessary?
• Pros:
• Decompresses an obstructed system and rapidly improves renal
function.
• Decompression of one kidney should be sufﬁcient initially
(preferentially decompress the kidney with the most parenchyma
visible on imaging ﬁrst).
• Will decompress an infected system with minimal instrumentation.
• No GA required.
• Allows time for a more deﬁnitive management plan to be
developed.

OBSTRUCTION: TREATMENT

• Cons:
• Invasive. Potential complications: bleeding and infection.
• Not always available 24 hours a day (although it should be).
• Temporary although can occasionally be left long-term in those
unﬁt for further intervention or on a palliative treatment pathway.
How urgent is it?
• Obstructed infected urinary system l 2 emergency nephrostomy
required.
• If severe renal failure, K+ >6.0mmol/L, or pulmonary oedema, then
dialysis prior to a nephrostomy may be desirable. 2 Seek expert help.
• Once a patient is safe, a delay of hours to ensure an expert operator
may be justiﬁed.
How should I prepare the patient?
U&E, FBC, clotting screen, G&S. Liaise closely with the interventional radiology team. They should gain informed consent.
Post-procedure care
• Regular post-nephrostomy observations and clinical review are
mandatory, particularly in the presence of sepsis.
• Careful ﬂuid balance: there is likely to be a brisk post-obstructive
diuresis. See Post-obstructive diuresis below.
• Make sure the nephrostomy is well secured!
• As well as being therapeutic, a nephrostomy also has diagnostic
potential. A nephrostogram involves injection of contrast via the
nephrostomy to examine antegrade ureteric ﬂow and identify the level
and source of obstruction.

Post-obstructive diuresis
• A large-volume diuresis (0.5–1L/h) post-relief of obstruction.
• Most common after the treatment of bilateral obstruction or
obstruction of a single functioning kidney.
• Results from either:
• Appropriate excretion of retained salt and water in renal
failure, or
• Inappropriate losses due to tubular dysfunction.
• Consequences: salt loss, volume depletion, electrolyte disturbances,
ATN with delayed recovery of renal function.
• Management:
• Regular assessment of ﬂuid balance, including BP, hourly UO,
clinical assessment, daily weights.
• Regular U&E (12-hourly if diuresis large). Also monitor K+,
bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium daily.
• Fluid replacement:
• Once euvolaemic, administer IVI 0.9% NaCl as UO + 50mL/h.
• Replace electrolytes, as necessary.
•  Remember the diuresis may initially result from the appropriate
excretion of the salt and water retained during obstruction. The aim
is not to perpetuate ﬂuid overload, but to prevent volume depletion.

735

736

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Pelvi-ureteric (PUJ) obstruction
Deﬁnition
• Proximal obstruction at the ureteric junction of the renal pelvis, resulting
in reduced or absent urinary ﬂow and a high-pressure renal pelvis.
• May coexist with vesicoureteric reﬂux (b p. 712) or VUJ obstruction.

Aetiology
May present antenatally, in childhood, or in adults.
• Congenital:
• Intrinsic: ♂ > ♀, proximal ureteric developmental defect.
• Extrinsic (rare): external compression (e.g. aberrant renal vessel).
• Acquired:
• Intrinsic: stricture (infection, trauma), uroepithelial malignancy.
• Extrinsic: malignancy, retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis.

Symptoms and signs
• Increasingly diagnosed with maternal USS screening. It is the most
common cause of antenatal hydronephrosis (71 in 1,500 live births).
L > R but may be bilateral.
• Children may present with failure to thrive, ﬂank pain, urinary tract
infections, a palpable mass, haematuria, hypertension, or renal
impairment (if bilateral).
• 20% diagnosed as adults (with a large number presumably never
diagnosed at all). Classically causes ﬂank pain after alcohol, coffee, or
diuretics (Diettel’s crisis).

Investigation
• USS (preferred) or CT will show dilatation of the renal pelvis with a
normal distal ureter.
• Diuretic isotope renography demonstrates obstruction with delayed
‘washout’.
• Serial scans are performed to determine optimal management.
• Micturating cystoureterogram (MCUG) may demonstrate concomitant
VUJ obstruction or posterior urethral valves.

Management
• No randomized trials:
• Generally conservative unless: impaired renal function (often
manifesting as a change in split renal function), recurrent UTIs,
calculi, persistent pain, increasing hydronephrosis.
• Prophylactic antibiotics of little beneﬁt.
• Surgery:
• Pyeloplasty involves resecting the abnormal ureteric segment and
reattaching normal ureter to the renal pelvis. Various techniques
are available, including open, laparoscopic, and endoscopic. All are
very successful.
If the obstruction is due to aberrant vasculature, the PUJ is repositioned
above the vessel.

PELVI-URETERIC (PUJ) OBSTRUCTION

Vesicoureteric junction obstruction
• VUJ (like PUJ) obstruction can be congenital or acquired.
• It may present with a similar constellation of symptoms to PUJ
obstruction but often later in childhood or as an adult.
• It is very important to look for associated VUR (b p. 712) and PUJ
obstruction.
• If surgery is necessary, it involves re-implantation of the ureter.

Posterior urethral valves (PUV)
• A developmental abnormality in males, leaving obstructing
membranous folds in the lumen of the posterior urethra.
• The most common cause of urinary obstruction in infants (71 in 8,000).
• The most common cause of CKD due to obstruction in children
(715% progress to ESRD).
• PUV cause dilatation of the proximal urethra, with hypertrophy of
the bladder wall, bilateral megaureters, and hydronephrosis.
• Most are identiﬁed by antenatal USS (bilateral hydronephrosis,
dilated bladder, and dilated posterior urethra: ‘keyhole sign’).
• Associated with other abnormalities, including urinary tract (VUR,
renal dysplasia) and non-urinary tract (e.g. lung hypoplasia).
• Children present with failure to thrive, abdominal distension,
UTIs, incontinence (daytime and nocturnal enuresis), and other
urinary symptoms, including frequency, straining, poor stream, and
large voids.
• MCUG is used to conﬁrm diagnosis.
• Management includes urinary drainage in the newborn, usually
by catheterization. Cystoscopic resection of the PUV should be
undertaken as early as possible.
• Fetal intervention is now being undertaken in some specialist centres
for severe cases.
• If PUV ablation is not possible, then a vesicostomy or other form of
urinary drainage procedure should be considered.
• Bladder dysfunction is common and often persistent, requiring
ongoing management, such as clean intermittent catheterization.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis: overview
Overview
• Retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis (RPF) describes a group of disorders
characterized by the development of ﬁbroinﬂammatory tissue that
surrounds and encases the abdominal aorta and other retroperitoneal
structures, including the ureters.
• Encasement impairs ureteric contractility and causes an obstructive
uropathy and then nephropathy.
• There are idiopathic (70%) and secondary forms. Both are uncommon
(71 per 200,000–500,000 population).
• The idiopathic form usually occurs age 40–60, with a 3:1 ♂:♀ ratio.

Aetiology
• p and s RPF are usually very similar pathologically.
• A tough, plaque-like material encases the major vessels and ureters.
• Microscopically, there is a macrophage- and plasma cell-rich
inﬂammatory inﬁltrate, with progressive ﬁbrotic change.
• This ﬁbrous tissue consists of ﬁbroblasts (including activated
myoﬁbroblasts) and type I collagen.
• The causes of this process remain poorly understood. Suggestions:
• They are an inﬂammatory reaction to aortic atherosclerosis.
Evidence: leakage of proinﬂammatory lipid-derived material, such as
ceroid (an oxidized LDL) across the wall of atheromatous aortas.
• It is an autoimmune phenomenon. Evidence: coexisting autoimmune
conditions, autoantibodies (60% ANA +ve in one series), HLA
associations (HLA-B27 or HLA-DRB1 03).

Causes
• Idiopathic.
• Inﬂammatory periaortitis (severe atherosclerosis), e.g. aortic aneurysm.
• Drug-induced: classically methysergide, but also bromocriptine,
methyldopa, and possibly beta-blockers.
• Chronic retroperitoneal infection (particularly TB).
• Other inﬂammatory conditions (e.g. sarcoidosis).
• After retroperitoneal trauma.
• Erdheim–Chester disease: a rare histiocyte disorder, characterized
by osteosclerotic bone lesions. Extraskeletal effects may include
retroperitoneal inﬁltration.
• Malignant:
• Lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorders, carcinoid.
• Metastatic or locally invasive malignancies (e.g. colon).
• Post-radiotherapy.

Clinical features
• Symptoms may be insidious and present >6 months prior to diagnosis
(which is often considered only when i SCr becomes apparent).
• Usually non-speciﬁc, e.g. malaise, anorexia, fever, and weight loss.
• Flank and low back pain are relatively common.

RETROPERITONEAL FIBROSIS: OVERVIEW

• Vascular encasement may produce oedema or claudication.
• Associations: inﬂammatory bowel disease, sclerosing cholangitis,
ankylosing spondylitis, SLE, scleroderma, vasculitides, Raynaud’s.
• An association is also emerging with the relatively new
clinicopathological entity of IgG4-related sclerosing disease. This has
been described in various tissues, particularly pancreatic (‘autoimmune
pancreatitis’), and is characterized by i circulating IgG4 as well as IgG4
plasma cell-rich inﬂammatory inﬁltrates.

Investigations
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

FBC (normocytic normochromic anaemia).
U&E, SCr, eGFR (impaired renal function).
ESR (a consistent marker of inﬂammation, useful for monitoring).
CRP.
ANA and other autoantibodies (variably +ve).
Immunoglobulins (polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia).
High serum IgG4 concentration.
Urinalysis is typically bland.

Imaging
• USS will demonstrate uni- or bilateral hydronephrosis.
• CT shows ﬁbrotic plaque enveloping the aorta and IVC and extending
laterally to encompass the ureters (see Fig. 9.2, b p. 741). May also
show associated atherosclerosis and aneurysmal change.
• Metastatic deposits, haemorrhage, and other disorders can have
similar appearances. Look for other signs of malignancy: local bone
destruction, lymphadenopathy, and anterior aortic displacement.
• Variable degree of enhancement with contrast, particularly in early
inﬂammatory phase.
• MRI is an alternative, showing high signal density in early stages and
lower density with ﬁbrosis or treatment.
• PET scanning shows high levels of uptake in active areas.
Biopsy
• A tissue biopsy is desirable to exclude alternative diagnoses.
• A CT-guided TruCut needle biopsy can be performed but can miss
active areas (PET may help to identify these).
• Open or laparoscopic may be preferred.

739

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis: management
Management
The aims of management of RPF include:
• Preservation of renal function; obstruction requires urgent treatment,
as per b p. 734.
• Resolution of inﬂammatory processes (and 6 both local and systemic
symptoms).
• Prevention of progressive ﬁbrosis.
• Exclusion of secondary causes, particularly malignancy.
Patients are best managed with an integrated medical and surgical
approach, although there are no controlled trials to guide therapy.
Medical management
• May be appropriate without surgery if no renal impairment.
• Stop any possible contributory drugs.
• Corticosteroids d inﬂammatory tissue encasing the ureter(s) and may
restore ureteric contractility and patency. Response is unpredictable.
• Start prednisolone 0.5–1mg/kg/day for 74–8 weeks.
• Slowly taper to 10mg, according to inﬂammatory markers (ESR,
CRP) and serial imaging.
• Reconsider diagnosis if unresponsive.
• Aim to discontinue after 12–24 months.
• Relapse in not uncommon, so long-term surveillance is mandatory.
• Combined corticosteroids and MMF show promise as initial therapy.
• Azathioprine and methotrexate have both been used successfully, both
when steroid therapy has failed and as steroid-sparing agents.
• Tamoxifen ( SE: thromboembolism) is a potential alternative when
steroids are contraindicated. Protocols vary, and mechanisms are
unclear (may increase ﬁbroblastic release of antiﬁbrotic TGF-B).
• Potential therapies include anti-CD20 therapy and TNF-A inhibitors.
Surgical management
• Preoperative medical therapy may have reduced inﬂammation.
• Open exploration with ureterolysis is the ﬁrst step. The ureters
(usually with JJ stents in situ) are identiﬁed, freed, and moved laterally.
• The ureters are then manipulated to prevent re-obstruction.
• Wrapping with a protective layer of omental fat is the commonest
approach.
• Ureteric intraperitoneal transplantation is an alternative.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Investigation of a renal mass
2 The primary goal of investigation of a renal mass is to exclude
malignancy.
Renal masses may be single or multiple, cystic or solid (see Table 9.7).
Table 9.7 Types of renal masses
Solid

Cystic

Single

Renal cell carcinoma
Angiomyolipoma
Oncocytoma
Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis
Metanephric adenoma
AV malformation

Simple cyst
Complex cyst
Cystic RCC

Multiple

Inherited, e.g. von Hippel–Lindau
disease, tuberous sclerosis

Autosomal dominant
(or recessive) polycystic
kidney disease
Acquired cystic disease

• They are often asymptomatic: 750% of new cases of renal cancer are
incidental ﬁndings on imaging.
• Simple renal cysts are commonly observed in normal kidneys. Their
incidence increases with age.
• USS will not detect lesions <5mm.
• The differential diagnosis and investigation of renal cystic disease are
discussed elsewhere (b p. 598).
See Table 9.8 for classiﬁcation.

Simple cysts
• USS criteria:
• Round.
• Smooth-walled.
• Anechoic.
• Good ultrasound transmission through the cyst.
• If all these features are present, a cyst is very likely to be benign.
• 2 If uncertainty persists, proceed to contrast-enhanced CT.
• CT criteria:
• Smooth and thin-walled.
• Similar density to water.
• No contrast enhancement.
• The Bosniak classiﬁcation is the standard for radiological assessment of
renal cysts (see Table 9.8).
• Equivocal cases should be followed, with repeat scans every
6–12 months.

The solid renal mass
• The concern is malignancy (carcinoma), but solid lesions can also be
benign (e.g. angiomyolipoma).

INVESTIGATION OF A RENAL MASS

• CT, and particularly MRI, may detect small quantities of fat, highly
suggestive of an angiomyolipoma.
•  However, imaging cannot exclude malignancy with absolute
certainty.
• Lesions <1.5cm cannot be accurately characterized by imaging. Active
surveillance of these is generally advocated.
• 2 Features of concern:
• Contrast enhancement.
• Thickened or irregular wall.
• Necrotic areas (implying rapid growth).
• Diameter >3cm (more likely to metastasize).
• In these circumstances, removal is usually necessary.
• For smaller lesions in patients at high surgical risk, alternatives beyond
surveillance are percutaneous radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy.
Biopsy
• High false –ve rate is the principal problem with CT-guided biopsy.
•  If you ﬁnd yourself discussing a biopsy—ask yourself, ‘Should I be
considering removal?’.
• Haemorrhage is an important complication.
• X The risk of tumour seeding along the needle track has probably
been exaggerated in the past.
• Useful if mass in a single kidney.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Renal cell carcinoma: general
Overview
• RCCs are adenocarcinomas arising from tubular epithelium.
• Account for >80% of primary malignant renal tumours and 73% of
cancers overall.
• Risk factors:
• Smoking (1/3 of cases; often present with more advanced disease).
• Long-standing hypertension (mechanism unknown).
• Obesity.
• Acquired cystic disease (including long standing ESRD patients and
ADPKD).
• Occupational exposures (cadmium, asbestos, and others).
• Analgesic nephropathy.
Several important subtypes with speciﬁc pathological and molecular characteristics (see RCC: pathological and molecular subtypes,
b p. 745).

Epidemiology
•
•
•
•

Peak incidence age 60–70.
1.5:1 ♂:♀ ratio.
More common in developed world.
Incidence is increasing (partly because of small incidental tumours
presenting earlier on imaging) and survival rates improving.

Genetics
• There is evidence for a strong genetic predisposition, including:
• Risk of a second RCC is high in those with ﬁrst at a young age.
• Several hereditary syndromes are associated with RCC,
including: von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) (most common), hereditary
papillary renal carcinoma, familial oncocytoma, and Birt–Hogg–
Dube syndrome.
• Factors suggesting a genetic inﬂuence in those without a deﬁned
hereditary syndrome include: onset age <40, multifocal disease, and
close relatives with RCC.
• Several genetic mutations in both sporadic and hereditary RCC have
been identiﬁed, particularly on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p).
• Inactivating mutations of the VHL gene (chromosome 3p25) are
particularly common.
• VHL protein functions as a tumour suppressor, targeting the products
of hypoxia-inducible genes for proteasomal degradation. These include:
• VEGF (l angiogenesis).
• TGF-A (l cell growth).
• d VHL protein l protein overexpression l epithelial proliferation +
angiogenesis l neoplastic transformation.
• Genetic heterogeneity is suggested by the involvement of other genes.
• Inactivating mutations of two genes (SETD2 and JARID1C) involved
in the histone integrity have recently been described.
• Overexpression of p53 protein is present in 750% tumours (and
associated with a worse prognosis).

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA: GENERAL

RCC: pathological and molecular subtypes
Clear cell (775%)
Originate from proximal tubule. Cells have clear cytoplasm. Deletion of
chromosome 3p typical.
Papillary (715%)
Originate from proximal tubule but pathologically and genetically distinct. Frequently multifocal. Classiﬁed into two subtypes, with different
genetic and prognostic inferences. Chromophilic.
Chromophobic (75%)
Originate from intercalated cells. Lack the lipid content of clear cell
tumours and appear darker macroscopically. Chromosome 3p intact.
Oncocytic (<5%)
Originate from cells of the collecting duct. Oncocytes are recognized as
well-differentiated cells with eosinophilic, mitochondria-rich cytoplasm.
Generally behave in a benign manner.
Collecting duct (<1%)
Younger age groups. Aggressive tumour, with some similarities to
urothelial cancer. Often presents with haematuria.
Medullary carcinoma (<1%)
Variant of collecting duct carcinoma. Associated with sickle cell trait.
Translocation carcinomas (<1%)
Younger age groups, especially those receiving chemotherapy for other
childhood cancers. Heterogeneous genetic abnormalities, often involving transcription factors. Incidence increasing.

von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) disease
• Autosomal dominant multisystem disorder, characterized by benign
and malignant tumours in many organ systems.
• 71 in 35,000 live births. 790% penetrance by age 65.
• VHL gene inactivation l overproduction of vascular growth factors.
• Manifestations:
• Renal involvement in 60%: cysts (70%), RCC (always clear cell,
usually multiple) (50%), ESRD from the required surgical removal
of renal tissue (25%).
• Retinal and CNS haemangioblastomas.
• Phaeochromocytoma.
• Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours and pancreatic cysts.
• Epididymal cystadenoma.
• Endolymphatic sac tumours (arise in the temporal bone, causing
hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and facial nerve dysfunction).
• Families often subcategorized, according to their
phaeochromocytoma and RCC pedigree.
• Mean onset of clinically manifest disease is age mid-20s.
A multidisciplinary approach, with surveillance from childhood, is
mandatory.

Essential urology

Renal cell carcinoma: diagnosis
Clinical features
• <10% exhibit the classic triad of pain, haematuria, and a palpable mass.
• Up to 50% are asymptomatic (incidental radiological ﬁnding). This is
increasing with the widespread use of abdominal imaging.
• Haematuria (l invasion of the collecting system; occurs in 740% of
those presenting ‘non-radiologically’).
• Flank or back pain (l capsular stretch), radiating to the groin, can
occur with larger tumours.
• Palpable mass.
• Scrotal varicocele (left > right) due to testicular vein obstruction
(ﬁnding one should always provoke suspicion. Arrange an USS).
• Lower limb oedema s to IVC invasion.
• 725% present with metastases (nodes, skeletal, liver, lung, cerebral).

Paraneoplastic syndromes with RCC
• Paraneoplastic phenomena are relatively common with RCC.
• RCC has 6 been called ‘the internist’s tumour’ because it can
present with non-speciﬁc symptoms to a general physician.
• These tend to occur late and suggest a poorer prognosis.
• Caused by tumour cytokine (e.g. IL-6) or hormone (e.g. EPO)
production.
• Include:
• Fever and night sweats.
• Weight loss and cachexia.
• Malaise.
• Erythrocytosis (RCC produces EPO).
• Disproportionate anaemia.
• Hypercalcaemia (skeletal metastases or production of PTHrP).
• Hepatic dysfunction without liver metastases (Stauffer syndrome).
• s AA amyloid deposition.
• Polymyalgia.
• Dermatomyositis.
• Neuropathy.
• Hypertension (i renin).
• Ectopic hormonal production (e.g. ACTH-like substance).
• Elevated ESR.

Work-up
• Imaging (b p. 742):
• USS: usually ﬁrst-line.
• CT: for diagnosis and initial staging. Chest CT for metastases.
• MRI: more sensitive for collecting system and IVC involvement.
• Bone scan: if skeletal pain, i Ca2+, or i alkaline phosphatase.
• PET: not used for routine staging. May detect occult metastases.
• DMSA: to determine split renal function, i.e. what would the
consequence of a nephrectomy be?

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA: DIAGNOSIS

• Biopsy:
• CT-guided. Increasingly used to guide treatment.
Risks: haemorrhage (tumour seeding has been overstated in
the past).

Prognosis
Staging, histological grading, and tumour subtype are relevant, and models
to integrate all three have been developed in some centres.
Staging
• The TNM (2010) classiﬁcation is used (see Table 9.9).
• T1N0: 5-year survival >90%; T4N2M1: 5-year survival <10%.

Fuhrman's nuclear grade
• Grading, according to histological criteria, also predicts survival.

Tumour subtype
• Tumour subtype may also inﬂuence the prognosis of localized disease,
e.g. chromophobe survival > papillary > clear cell.
Other
• Poor patient performance status and paraneoplastic symptoms are
adverse prognostic indicators.
• Molecular and cytogenetic markers are likely to play a progressively
more important role in the future.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Renal carcinoma: management and
follow-up
Management
Management is directed by the possibility of cure—based principally on
tumour staging. For localized disease, surgical resection alone may be
curative. Unfortunately, tumours are often already locally advanced or
metastatic at presentation. Recurrence after resection is not uncommon.
Surgery
• Radical nephrectomy is the conventional approach and preferred when
evidence of local invasion (e.g. renal vein, perinephric fat, or adrenal).
• Partial nephrectomy (open or laparoscopic) may be favoured
for smaller, non-invasive tumours. Outcomes are good and local
recurrence rates low. Such ‘nephron-sparing’ surgery is particularly
useful in several situations:
• Single functioning kidney.
• Contralateral kidney has signiﬁcant functional impairment.
• Bilateral tumours or hereditary multicentric disease.
• Surgery to remove isolated metastases (e.g. lung) is recommended in
carefully selected cases.
• A debulking nephrectomy prior to systemic therapy has shown
a survival beneﬁt. Removal of RCCs rarely induces spontaneous
remission of metastases through immunological mechanisms.
• X The role of adjuvant systemic therapy, in addition to surgery, for
localized disease is unproven. Trials are ongoing.
Energy ablation therapy
• Cryotherapy or radiofrequency ablation can be used to obliterate
tumour tissue in situ.
• Option for smaller (<4cm) tumours in patients unsuitable for surgery.
• Follow-up data now emerging. Local recurrence not uncommon.
‘Conventional’ chemotherapy
• Limited role, as RCC, particularly clear cell tumours, often exhibit
P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance.
Cytokines
• Systemic treatment of RCC is one of the most rapidly evolving areas
in medical oncology. Enrolment into approved clinical trials should be
encouraged.
• Cytokine therapy (IFN-A9 IL-2) was the standard ﬁrst-line systemic
therapy until relatively recently.
• Mechanism of action is unknown but probably involves induction of
anti-tumour immunity.
• However, response rates were low and relatively short-lived.
Remission in 710%.
• High-dose IL-2 causes signiﬁcant toxicity (l proinﬂammatory
cytokine cascades). 2 Side effects common and often severe (d BP,
arrhythmias, dyspnoea, fever, nausea, i SCr, CNS toxicity, skin rashes).
IFN-A SE: ﬂu-like symptoms (fever, malaise, myalgia, etc.).

RENAL CARCINOMA: MANAGEMENT AND FOLLOW-UP

Molecularly targeted therapy
• Improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of RCC has
identiﬁed VEGF and mTOR as targets for therapeutic intervention.
• Systemic therapy targeting VEGF is now the standard of care for
ﬁrst-line treatment of metastatic RCC.
• There are two approaches to VEGF inhibition:
• Blockade of intracellular VEGF signalling through tyrosine kinase
inhibition, e.g. sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib. Sunitinib
and pazopanib are NICE-approved and have become ﬁrst-line
treatment. SE: i BP, renal and hepatic toxicity, thromboembolism,
cardiac toxicity, thyroid dysfunction, GI toxicity, skin rashes.
• Monoclonal Abs to circulating VEGF (e.g. bevacizumab). Rare in the UK.
• Temsirolimus and everolimus inhibit mTOR and provide an option
if disease progresses despite VEGF inhibition (SE: nausea, anorexia,
anaemia, pneumonitis).

Follow-up
Surveillance for local and contralateral recurrence as well as metastatic
disease is mandatory. The frequency of follow-up appointments and
repeat imaging is based on risk stratiﬁcation for each given clinical scenario. Several algorithms have been developed to assist this process.

Wilms’ tumour (nephroblastoma)
• Embryonal neoplasm arising in the kidney. It is the commonest renal
malignancy in children and represents 78% of all childhood cancer.
• Peak age 3–4 years (rare age >10). ♂ = ♀.
• More common in a number of congenital syndromes, but these still
represent only a small proportion of the total.
• WT1 was the initial Wilms’ associated gene identiﬁed. However, the
situation is much more complex, with several others now known.
• Clinical features:
• 73/4 present with an abdominal mass (often noticed by a parent).
• 71/2 report abdominal pain.
• i BP (l tumour renin production), haematuria, fever.
• Staging delineates local spread and presence of metastases
(particularly pulmonary).
• X Diagnostic biopsy not always undertaken (although desirable if
preoperative chemotherapy is under consideration).
• Classic ‘triphasic’ histology: epithelial, stromal, and blastemal
elements all coexist. Anaplastic features carry a worse prognosis.
• Treatment:
• The majority of patients will be cured.
• Surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g. vincristine
9 dactinomycin), as determined by staging. Preoperative
chemotherapy is favoured in many centres. The use of
radiotherapy is diminishing (l subsequent growth restriction).
• Follow-up: pulmonary relapse is more common than renal. In
addition, prospective assessment of the long-term side effects of
anthracycline-based chemotherapy (e.g. cardiac function) is mandatory.

749

750

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Tumours of the bladder: overview
• Bladder cancer is the second commonest malignancy of the urinary
tract and one of the top ﬁve cancers in the UK and USA.
• Median age: 70; 2.5 ♂:1 ♀.
• Caucasians > black people (although prognosis worse in the latter).
• 90% are transitional cell cancers (TCCs), derived from urothelium.
• Although the bladder is the most common site, TCCs can arise
anywhere from the renal pelvis to the urethra (b p. 756).
• Squamous cell cancers (SCCs), often s to chronic schistosomal
infection, are much more common in developing countries (775%
cases). SCCs can also be secondary to stone disease and other causes
of chronic inﬂammation.
• Prognosis is varied, depending on histology and staging. Low-grade,
‘superﬁcial’ tumours have a very different outcome from high-grade
‘invasive’ ones.
• TCCs have one of the highest recurrence rates of any malignancy.

Risk factors
Transitional cell (TCC)
• 2780% of TCCs are associated with an environmental exposure.
• Cigarette smoking is the most important (by far) and associated
with a 4-fold risk (relevant carcinogens include B-naphthylamine and
4-aminobiphenyl).
• Aromatic amines, aniline dyes, and hydrocarbons. Occupations at
i risk include: petroleum industry and lorry drivers (diesel fumes),
plumbers, metal workers, dry cleaners, painters, hairdressers, rubber,
textile and leather industry workers.
• Urban > rural areas.
• Previous haemorrhagic cystitis from cyclophosphamide therapy
(l acrolein; a carcinogenic urinary metabolite. Mesna inactivates
urinary acrolein and may be used as chemoprophylaxis).
• Previous pelvic radiotherapy.
• Prolonged immunosuppression (e.g. transplant recipient).
• Late risk after bladder augmentation procedure (e.g. ileocystoplasty).
• Phenacetin (an analgesic), prior to its withdrawal.
• X High ﬂuid intake may dilute carcinogens, reducing urothelial
exposure and 6 risk.
Squamous cell (SCC)
• Squamous metaplasia li risk of SCC.
• Causes: chronic cystitis, bladder stones, long-term urinary catheters.
• Schistosoma haematobium infection is responsible for the majority
worldwide, particularly the Middle East.

Genetics
• Several genetic mutations have been identiﬁed.
• Altered tumour suppressor expression, e.g. p53 (chromosome 17).
• Deletion of 9p21 (site of tumour suppressor p16).
• Aneuploidy of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17.
• Altered c-myc and c-jun oncogene expression.

TUMOURS OF THE BLADDER: OVERVIEW

Clinical features
• Haematuria:
• Painless visible haematuria in 780% patients.
• 715% patients presenting with macroscopic haematuria will have
bladder cancer.
• <5% patients presenting with microscopic haematuria will have
bladder cancer.
• Irritative symptoms (b p.78), e.g. frequency, urgency, nocturia, dysuria.
• More advanced disease: pain, pelvic mass, systemic symptoms (weight
loss, fatigue, anorexia, etc.).

Investigations
• Urine cytology:
• 100mL freshly voided urine. Avoid ﬁrst morning sample.
• Sensitivity is quite low and centre-dependent.
• Sensitivity increases for higher-grade tumours (l pleomorphism
and increased nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio).
• Urinary biomarkers:
• Novel protein and genetic markers are gradually expanding their
diagnostic utility. They include tumour cell-associated antigens (via
immunohistochemistry) and genetic abnormalities (via ﬂuorescence
in situ hybridization—FISH).
• Many identiﬁed but few routinely available. Further proof of clinical
utility is required.
• Commercially available tests include: (i) a FISH assay with probes for
chromosomes 3, 7, 17, and 9p21 and (ii) a quantitative immunoassay
for nuclear matrix protein (NMP-22), a housekeeping protein active
during cell division.
• Cystoscopy:
• Size, number, position, morphology of tumours. Rigid cystoscopy
allows biopsy.
• Photodynamic cystoscopy: a photoactive substance that
accumulates in neoplastic cells (e.g. 5-aminolevulinic acid) is instilled
and ﬂuoresces under light of the appropriate wavelength. Aids the
identiﬁcation of carcinoma in situ (CIS).
• Biopsy/cystoscopic resection:
• Biopsy areas displaying abnormal urothelium.
• Random biopsies may be necessary to detect CIS, including of
prostatic urethra.
• Inclusion of muscularis propria necessary to ensure accurate staging.
• Imaging:
• USS to exclude hydronephrosis (even if SCr normal–as unilateral
obstruction may occur). Not useful for staging.
• CT: for staging. In addition, upper tracts must be assessed for
synchronous tumours by contrast-enhanced CT.
• MRI as good as CT for staging and may better delineate extravesical
invasion.
• Bone scan if skeletal pain, i ALP, or i Ca2+.
• CXR for lung metastases if muscle-invasive (and if CT chest not
undertaken during staging).
• PET: limited role in local disease, as 18F-FDG undergoes urinary
excretion. May have a role in detection/monitoring of metastases.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Tumours of the bladder: pathology
and management
Pathology
• TCC (90%) > SCC (5%) > adenocarcinoma (2%) > sarcomas (rare) >
small cell (rare).
• TCC has a range of phenotypic expressions: papillary (770%), sessile
(710–20%), nodular (710%), or carcinoma in situ (CIS).
• The usual growth pattern is papillary, projecting out into the bladder
lumen. This may gradually invade deeper, breaching basement
membrane, lamina propria, and, eventually, muscle, prior to distant
spread.
• Often multifocal. 730% tumours are synchronous at presentation (s to
the ‘ﬁeld change’ effect of environmental exposures).
• WHO classiﬁes tumours pathologically as low-grade (formerly grades
1–2) or high-grade (grade 3). Low-grade tumours rarely progress to
more aggressive, muscle-invasive forms (see Table 9.10).
• The term ‘superﬁcial’ tumour is misleading and best avoided. Lowand high-grade tumours follow different biological pathways, have
different outcomes, and require different treatments, regardless of
‘superﬁciality’.
• 2 CIS does not imply early disease or a good outcome—it is often
characterized by high-grade dysplasia and a poor prognosis. Many
patients with CIS have coexisting papillary tumours (‘pure’ CIS
in <10%).

Staging and prognosis
• The most signiﬁcant prognostic factors are: (i) depth of invasion
(stage); (ii) histological grade; (iii) presence of CIS; (iv) previous
recurrences.
• Progression risk relates to grade. Low-grade <10% progression (rarely
invade muscle). High-grade >30% progression.
• The majority of tumours (>70%) are non-muscle-invasive at diagnosis.
• Non-muscle-invasive tumours have a relatively good prognosis, with
5-year survival rates of >80%. Tumours are much more likely to recur
than progress. 5-year survival deteriorates to <25% by stage T4.
• Prognosis therefore depends on both stage and grade. As a rough
guide, for superﬁcial tumours:
• Ta low grade: prognosis very good.
• Ta high grade: prognosis less good.
• T1 low grade: prognosis good.
• T1 high grade: prognosis poor.
• Diffuse CIS l higher recurrence rates and poorer prognosis.
• 750% with muscle-invasive disease have occult metastases at diagnosis.
• Prognosis for those with distant disease is poor (<10% alive at 2 years).

Management
• The depth of bladder wall invasion determines treatment
(non-muscle-invasive: Ta, T1, and CIS. Muscle-invasive: T2–T4).
Non-muscle-invasive
• Transurethral resection (TURBT):
• Smaller TCCs may be resected as one piece with underlying
muscle. Larger tumours require more extensive resection.
• Should be followed with a single dose of intravesical chemotherapy
(e.g. mitomycin) to d recurrence risk (administered within 6h of
resection).
• Repeat TURBT at 76 weeks if: (i) residual tumour; (ii) no muscle in
initial specimen (l risk of understaging); (iii) high-grade disease.
• Subsequent treatment depends on the risk of recurrence and
progression. Broadly:
• Low-risk (Ta staging, <3 lesions, <3cm, low-grade dysplasia,
papillary): follow with active surveillance.
• High-risk (T1 staging or above, CIS, >3 lesions, >3cm, high-grade
dysplasia, non-papillary): further intravesical treatment. Usually
immunotherapy with bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG). Usually
induction treatment weekly for 6 weeks (+/– intermittent
maintenance therapy for 1–3 years). Reduces progression risk
by 725% (SE: cystitis, haematuria, fever, arthralgia, hepatitis, and
pneumonitis).

753

754

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Muscle-invasive disease (or failure of conservative treatment)
Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion
• Bladder removed with local lymph node dissection. The prostate and
seminal vesicles are also removed in ♂ (SE: impotence), and cervix,
uterus, ovaries, and anterior vagina in ♀.
• Commonly performed as open surgery, but laparoscopic and robotic
techniques are becoming well established.
• Operative mortality of 2–5%, but overall perioperative morbidity
(cardiovascular, atelectasis, sepsis, bowel and urine leaks, bleeding,
wound infections) highly signiﬁcant (730–60%).
• There is evidence that neoadjuvant chemotherapy has a role prior to
surgery, and it should be considered in all suitable patients.
• Urinary diversion:
• Ileal conduit: a segment of ileum is used to create a stoma.
• Orthotopic neobladder: pouch formed from bowel and connected
to the urethra (prostatic urethral disease precludes this option).
• Continent cutaneous pouch: similar to neobladder, but
externalization using bowel (often appendix) allows drainage via a
catheter.
• Metastatic disease is treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
• In patients who are not considered to be candidates for cystectomy,
bladder preservation with a radical TURBT +/– chemotherapy may be
an option.
Radical external beam radiotherapy
• Generally reserved for those unﬁt for surgery, in a poor prognostic
group, or needing palliation of local symptoms (e.g. haematuria).

Follow-up
See b p. 757.

Bladder adenocarcinoma
• Uncommon; ~2% malignant bladder tumours.
• Varied histologic patterns, but most often a glandular (enteric)
morphology.
• Need to be differentiated from metastatic adenocarcinoma; e.g.
prostate, colon.
• May arise from urachal remnant.
• Tend to be aggressive with extra-vesical extension at presentation.
• Treatment is surgical, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and
radiotherapy.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Tumours of the renal pelvis and ureter
Overview
• Tumours can arise anywhere from renal calyces to the vesicoureteric
junction.
• 70% occur in the distal ureter, 25% mid, and 5% upper.
• Multicentric disease common, but bilateral tumours rare.
• 75% of patients with bladder cancer will develop an upper tract lesion
(higher for CIS).
• 730–40% of patients with an upper tract lesion will develop a bladder
tumour (ls to ﬁeld transformation effect and downstream seeding).
• Risk factors and genetics reﬂect those for bladder cancer (b p. 750)
• There are additional associations with Balkan endemic nephropathy
(b p. 582), aristocholic, or Chinese herb, nephropathy (b p. 583)
and Lynch syndrome.

Clinical features
• Frank haematuria (>60%).
• Flank pain s obstruction (30%).
• Lower urinary tract symptoms are uncommon. Many patients are
asymptomatic.

Investigations
• Urine cytology is less sensitive than for bladder lesions.
• Contrast CT (or retrograde ureterography) to demonstrate a ﬁlling
defect.
• The contralateral ureter must be evaluated.
• Cystoscopy to assess synchronous bladder tumour(s).
• Ureteroscopy 9 biopsy. Biopsy will determine histological grade but
may understage.
• Additional investigations, as for bladder tumours (b p. 751).

Pathology
• Benign tumours (e.g. ﬁbroepithelial polyps) are rare.
• >90% are TCCs. Others: SCCs (l risks include calculi, particularly
staghorn calculi, and chronic infection), adenocarcinomas, small cell
tumours, and metastases.
• Histologically identical to bladder tumours.
• 2740% are invasive at presentation—a far higher proportion than for
bladder tumours.

Staging
Described by the TNM system, comparable to bladder tumours.

Management
• Endoscopic/percutaneous procedures:
• ‘Kidney-sparing’ techniques.
• Require careful patient selection (e.g. solitary kidney, bilateral
lesions, unﬁt for more aggressive surgery).
• Prospective surveillance for residual or recurrent tumour is
essential.

TUMOURS OF THE BLADDER: PATHOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT

• Nephrouretectomy:
• Remains the benchmark.
• Laparoscopic outcomes now as good as open surgery.
• The entire ureter is removed, including a cuff of normal bladder
(retained ureteric stumps l tumour recurrence in 725%).
• Segmental ureteric surgery with re-implantation may be possible for
isolated, distal, low-grade tumours.
• Adjuvant chemotherapy is often given for T3/4 or node +ve disease.
• The role of topical chemotherapy or BCG immunotherapy is less well
deﬁned than for bladder tumours. However, single dose intravesical
mitomycin C post nephrouretectomy appears to decrease the risk of
recurrent disease.

Prognosis
• Determined by stage, histological grade, and the patient’s age.
• Molecular and cytogenetic markers may play a greater prognostic role
in the future.
• 5-year survival 60–90% for non-invasive disease. This falls to <5% for
T4 tumours.

Follow-up of transitional cell tumours
• TCCs have one of the highest recurrence rates of any malignancy.
• Follow-up is determined by tumour grade, tumour stage, and the
nature of initial treatment undertaken.
• Although based on repeat cystoscopy and imaging, clinical
assessment and urine cytology (low sensitivity, higher speciﬁcity) also
form part of surveillance.
• Urinary biomarkers are likely to play a more prominent future role.
Bladder tumours
• The majority of patients have an intact bladder and require long-term
surveillance (i.e. large numbers, time-consuming, and costly).
Non-muscle-invasive (example regimens)
• Low-risk tumours: repeat cystoscopy at 3 months. 6–12-monthly
thereafter.
• High-risk tumours: 3-monthly for the ﬁrst year, 4-monthly for second,
then 6-monthly for 5 years (or recurrence or progression occurs).
Muscle-invasive
• After radical cystectomy, patients remain at risk of distant metastases
as well as recurrence in the upper tracts and urethra.
• CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 6–12-monthly is
generally advocated (X whether early detection of metastases
confers a survival advantage remains unproven).
Upper tract tumours
• Post-nephrouretectomy, both cystoscopic surveillance (3-monthly
for the ﬁrst year, then 6–12-monthly) and imaging (contrast CT or
retrograde ureterography) of the contralateral ureter is necessary.
• Renal-sparing treatment strategies mandate particularly stringent
surveillance, as recurrence risk is higher.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Benign prostatic enlargement: general
Background
• The prostate is a walnut-sized gland, surrounding the proximal urethra
at the bladder apex. It comprises several zones, enclosed in an outer
capsule, and functions to secrete an alkaline seminal ﬂuid.
• Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or hypertrophy, results from
cellular proliferation in the peri-urethral transition zone and is a
histological diagnosis.
• Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) is the clinical term referring to
increased gland size.
• Gland enlargement l bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) l lower
urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).
• BPH is an unwelcome consequence of ♂ ageing. 750% develop it by
age 60 and 790% by age 85.

Pathophysiology
• Remains incompletely understood.
• Heightened sensitivity to multiple growth factors and cytokines appear
important.
• Androgen dependency is particularly well described.
• 5A-reductase converts testosterone l dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
within the prostate.
• Prostatic DHT levels are not increased, but androgen receptor
expression is demonstrably more abundant in hyperplastic glands.
• BPH is rare in ♂ with hypogonadism.
• Proliferation (stromal > epithelial) occurs primarily in the peri-urethral
transitional zone.
• Impaired apoptosis may also contribute to cell accumulation.
• Twin studies suggest a partial genetic susceptibility.
• LUTS result from:
• Bladder outlet obstruction.
• Bladder dysfunction: i ﬁlling pressures l bladder wall hypertrophy,
trabeculation, poor compliance (d smooth muscle, i collagen),
detrusor overactivity (sensitivity to small urine volumes), and,
eventually, incomplete voiding.
• A1-adrenergic receptor stimulation in prostatic smooth muscle and
the bladder neck li smooth muscle tone.

Clinical features
• 2 BPE adversely affects the quality of life of many ♂ over age 50.
• LUTS refresher: frequency, urgency, nocturia, poor or intermittent
stream, dribbling, incomplete bladder emptying (see b p. 78).
• Not all men with LUTS have BPE (and not all men with BPE have LUTS).
• Prostatic volume and symptoms tend to increase over time.
• More severe symptoms are commoner in black men.
• Severity and response to treatment can be assessed with the international
prostate symptom score (IPSS) (see Box 9.3). The ﬁnal question relates
to quality of life and is a strong determinant of the need for intervention.
• Erectile dysfunction is commonly associated with LUTS.

BENIGN PROSTATIC ENLARGEMENT: GENERAL

• Ask about medications (diuretics, anticholinergics, tricyclics, opiates)
and lifestyle factors (caffeine, alcohol, excess liquid intake).
• A self-completed voiding diary undertaken over a few days can further
assess symptoms, liquid intake, and bladder capacity. Diaries can also
serve as a platform for subsequent self-management.

Complications
• Bladder dysfunction, post-void residual urine volumes, acute urinary
retention, recurrent UTIs, obstructive nephropathy, bladder stones,
haematuria.

Differential diagnosis
• Prostate: prostate cancer, prostatitis, prostatodynia.
• Bladder: overactive bladder (see b p. 765), bladder dysfunction (e.g.
neurological disorder), tumour, stone, foreign body (e.g. stent).
• Urethra: stricture (previous trauma, STD).

Box 9.3 International prostate symptom score (IPSS)
Scoring system
• Seven questions about LUTS. Answers are on a scale of 0–5.
• For questions 1–6, the choice of answers is: not at all (score 0); less
than one time in ﬁve (1); less than half the time (2); about half the
time (3); more than half the time (4); almost always (5).
Questions
1. Over the past month, how often have you had a sensation of not
emptying your bladder completely after you ﬁnished urinating?
2. Over the past month, how often have you had the urge to urinate
again less than 2 hours after you ﬁnished urinating?
3. Over the past month, how often have you found you stopped and
started again several times when you urinated?
4. Over the past month, how often have you found it difﬁcult to
postpone urination?
5. Over the past month, how often have you had a weak urinary
stream? (Compare with your stream size at age 30.)
6. Over the past month, how often have you had to push or strain to
begin urination?

Add the scores to give the category of symptom severity (mild <8; moderate 8–19; severe 20–35).
A further question addresses quality of life.
• If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition

Essential urology

Benign prostatic enlargement:
investigation and management
Physical examination
• Palpable bladder.
• Digital rectal examination (DRE).
• Size, consistency, contour, surface texture. Pain. Sphincter tone
(d if underlying neurological disorder). Normal prostate volume is
720g (72 index ﬁngers across).
• Neurological examination may be necessary.
• BP: may be elevated if chronic retention and obstructive uropathy.
BP will also help plan management with selective vs. non-selective α
blockade (b p. 761).

Investigations
• Urinalysis and MSU for M,C+S.
• PSA:
• BPH does not cause prostate cancer, but ♂ at risk for BPH are
also at risk for prostate cancer.
• PSA levels correlate with prostate volume, so PSA is less speciﬁc
for cancer in an individual with BPH.
• May help predict response to treatment.
• Measurement is recommended in many guidelines. Discuss with
patient, and interpret in conjunction with DRE.
• May be helpful if treatment with an 5α-reductase inhibitor is being
considered, as these would be expected to reduce the PSA by
~50% after 6 months.
• eGFR:
• Renal insufﬁciency is uncommon so not universally indicated at
initial presentation (exception: high residual volume).
• USS:
• Prostate and bladder volumes may predict response to treatment.
• Exclude hydronephrosis if retention or d eGFR.
• Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS):
• For detailed volumetric assessment. Desirable prior to surgery and
5α-reductase inhibitors (see b p. 761).
• Consider if i PSA.
• Upper tract imaging:
• If haematuria, stones, d eGFR, large residual volume, upper tract
infection.
• Maximal ﬂow rate (Qmax) and ﬂow pattern:
• Useful for initial assessment and to gauge response to treatment.
• >15mL/s is normal.
• The shape of the ﬂow pattern curve may help differentiate BOO
from impaired bladder function.
• Urodynamics (pressure ﬂow studies):
• Invasive (urethral catheter and transrectal probe).
• Differentiates BOO from detrusor dysfunction (BOO: i voiding
pressures (>60cmH2O) and d Qmax (<15mL/s)).

BPE: INVESTIGATION AND MANAGEMENT

• Consider if complications, such as incontinence, or accurate
prediction of surgical outcome is desirable (e.g. high-risk candidate).
• Flexible cystoscopy:
• If atypical features (e.g. haematuria), prior to invasive treatment, or
if an alternative diagnosis (e.g. stricture) is being considered.

Management
Overview
• Patients with minor symptoms (IPSS score <7), no complications,
and an acceptable quality of life are managed with adaptive lifestyle
measures and watchful waiting. Reassess at least annually.
• Lifestyle measures: d liquid intake (particularly night-time); modify
diuretic therapy; d caffeine and alcohol; void prior to bedtime,
travel, or meetings. Improve glycaemic control in diabetic patients.
• Failed lifestyle measures, or moderate to severe symptoms (IPSS score
≥8) can be treated with drug therapy. A 3–6 point reduction in IPSS
score can be expected (760% men report an improvement).
• Indications for surgery: acute urinary retention, recurrent macroscopic
haematuria, recurrent UTIs, obstructive nephropathy, failure of medical
therapy.
Drug therapy
α1 receptor blockade
• A1-adrenergic receptor-mediated smooth muscle tone in both prostate
and bladder neck contribute to LUTS. There are several receptor
subtypes, with the A1a receptor most relevant in prostatic tissue.
• Selective A1a antagonists require less dose titration and may have
fewer vascular side effects.
• Tamsulosin 0.4mg PO od or alfuzosin 10mg PO od.
• Non-A1a selective agents are still effective (and less expensive) but
require more careful dose titration.
• Doxazosin 1mg PO od (bedtime), titrate to maintenance 2–4mg.
• Terazosin 1mg PO od (bedtime), titrate to maintenance 5–10mg.
• SE: postural d BP, dizziness, ejaculatory disorder, nasal congestion.
• Rapidly improve symptoms (within days) but do not demonstrably d
the overall risk of acute retention or requirement for surgery.
• Intraoperative ﬂoppy iris syndrome (miosis, iris billowing, and
prolapse) is more common during cataract surgery in those receiving
A1-blockers (particularly tamsulosin) and causes technical issues for the
surgeon.
5α-reductase inhibitors
• Inhibit 5A-reductase 6 block prostatic conversion of testosterone l
DHT and impede gland growth.
• Improve LUTS through a reduction in prostate volume.
• Greatest beneﬁt in those with higher initial prostate volume (>40g on
DRE or USS) or progression of symptoms despite on an A-blocker.
• Peak effect is delayed for 3–6 months. Continue long term.
• d incidence of acute retention and the requirement for surgery.
• Examples: ﬁnasteride 5mg PO od, dutasteride 0.5mg PO od.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

• Side effects: d libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorder,
gynaecomastia, but often better tolerated than A-blockers.
• May d PSA by 50% 6 caution when interpreting measurements.
• X 5A-reductase inhibitors have been associated with a higher risk
of high-grade prostate cancer in clinical trials, albeit with a lower
incidence of prostate cancer overall (this may be a consequence of
sampling a smaller prostate).
Combination therapy
• Since A-blockers provide rapid symptomatic relief and 5A-reductase
inhibitors gradually inﬂuence underlying pathology, concomitant use
makes good sense, particularly where initial prostate volumes are high.
• Combination ld progression, improved symptoms (and IPSS score), d
risk of retention, and d requirement for surgery.
• Withdrawal of the A-blocker may be possible after 6 months.
Anticholinergic agents
• May be beneﬁcial where storage LUTS (urgency, frequency, nocturia,
small urine volumes, urge incontinence) dominate symptoms without
signiﬁcant obstruction or a residual volume.
• This clinical scenario is often described as an ‘overactive bladder’.
• Examples: oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin, and darifenacin.
• Generally effective and well-tolerated, although dry mouth common.
• Also consider bladder training and biofeedback techniques.
•  May worsen obstructive (voiding) symptoms, increase residual
volumes, and precipitate urinary retention.
Phytotherapy
• Plant extracts are widely used for both self- and prescribed treatment.
• Suggested active components include polysaccharides, fatty
acids, phytosterols, lectins, and ﬂavonoids. Anti-androgenic,
anti-inﬂammatory, and other effects have been postulated.
• Extracts of saw palmetto (American dwarf palm) and Pygeum africanum
(African plumb tree) are the most common.
• X Evidence base is limited. Some studies demonstrate modest
symptomatic improvement, whilst others show no beneﬁt over
placebo.
• Minimal adverse effects.
Phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitors
• Sildenaﬁl or tadalaﬁl may improve mild to moderate LUTS (nitric
oxide may mediate relaxation of the prostatic urethra).
• Role needs further clariﬁcation but may prove useful where coexisting
BPE and erectile dysfunction.
• 1There is a potential interaction between α blockers and PDE-5
inhibitors causing postural hypotension.
Invasive procedures
See Table 9.11.

BPE: INVESTIGATION AND MANAGEMENT

Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
• The historical gold standard, although the number performed is falling,
as alternatives, including medical therapies, are introduced and reﬁned.
• Involves the passage of a diathermy loop through a urethral sheath.
Prostatic tissue is shaved away under direct vision. Prostate ‘chips’ are
available for histology (75% incidental prostate cancer).
• Requires hospitalization. Regional or general anaesthesia.
• Morbidity (720% l prolonged hospital stay) and mortality (70.25%).
• Good symptomatic and urodynamic outcomes.
• Complications:
• Bleeding (leave catheter in place until cleared).
• Urinary infection (prophylaxis is generally given).
• Urethral stricture.
• Absorption of hypotonic irrigation ﬂuid through exposed veins ld
Na+ (now rare with saline irrigation for bipolar cautery).
• Damage to bladder sphincter mechanism.
• Retrograde ejaculation into the bladder.
• Urinary incontinence.
• Erectile dysfunction (nerve damage).
Open prostatectomy
• Very large prostates (>100g). Inner core of the prostate shelled out via
a lower abdominal incision. Laparoscopic technique is an alternative.
Bladder neck incision and transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP)
• The main alternative to TURP for many years. Short GA. An incision
is made to widen the prostatic urethra and bladder neck. Suitable for
patients with smaller prostates if unﬁt for TURP. Fewer complications
but retreatment often necessary.
Newer techniques
• See Table 9.11.
• Longer-term outcome data for newer therapies are still emerging.

BPE: INVESTIGATION AND MANAGEMENT

The overactive bladder
Introduction
• An important syndrome deﬁned by symptoms: urinary urgency
(9 incontinence) dominates, usually with frequency (≥ 8x in a 24h
period) and sometimes with nocturia (≥ 3x at night).
• Urgency is a sudden, overwhelming, desire to pass urine. It is an
unpleasant symptom that has a debilitating impact on quality of life.
• Pathophysiology appears multifactorial, but involves detrusor
overactivity. Possible mechanisms: increased muscarinic sensitivity,
overactive afferent sensory pathways and subtle urothelial dysfunction.
Investigation
• 2 Infection should always be excluded: urinalysis, MSU for M, C+S.
• Bladder diary, symptom questionnaires (many available),
• Other: assessment of post-void residual volume (usually USS—
further assessment may be necessary if >150mL), urodynamics
(characteristic phasic increases in detrusor activity) 9 cystoscopy in
atypical or refractory cases.
Management
• Lifestyle modiﬁcations
• Modify amount and timing of ﬂuid intake, absorbent pads if
incontinence, double void techniques (if residual volume).
• Bladder training. This is an organised regime of voiding that can be
highly successful, but requires (persistent) patient motivation.
• Pelvic ﬂoor muscle therapy improves urethral sphincter control
and may be effective, esp. in younger patients. Use in conjunction
with biofeedback electrodes (abdominal, anal, vaginal) is common.
• Anticholinergics.
• Inhibit involuntary detrusor muscle contraction; examples:
tolterodine, oxybutynin and solifenacin
• SE: dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, confusion (1 elderly).
• Contraindications: BOO and narrow angle glaucoma
• B3 adrenergic agonists
• Recently introduced after success in clinical trials; e.g. mirabegron.
• Botulinum toxin.
• Inhibits acetylcholine release and therefore detrusor stimulation.
Requires direct detrusor injection. Good symptomatic
improvement in clinical trials (including incontinence).
• Sacral neuromodulation.
• Surgical electrode insertion at S2-3 level. An external pulse
generator conﬁrms efﬁcacy prior to permanent implantation.
• Symptomatic improvement in ~2/3rds (may persist 3–5 years).
• SE: pain at implant site, lead migration, leg pain, urinary retention,
altered bowel habit.
• Surgery (last resort).
• Augmentation entero-cystoplasty (with a GI segment, usually
ileum) to i functional bladder capacity and d intravesical pressure.
• Ileal conduit formation in refractory cases.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Prostate cancer: general
Background
Although it is often stated that more men die with prostate cancer than
of prostate cancer, this still means that many men succumb to the disease every year. In addition, this belief may only hold true for populations
where PSA testing is high and not where men present with symptomatic
disease. Prostate cancer is the second commonest cause of cancer death
in men in the UK after lung cancer. However, the clinical phenotype ranges
from microscopic, slow-growing, well-differentiated tumours to aggressive
cancers with rapid local invasion and distant spread. This has meant that
screening for prostate cancer has become a very controversial topic.

Epidemiology
• Incidence has risen steadily since the mid-1970s. Reasons: ageing
population, improved cancer registries, improved diagnostic accuracy,
incidental cancer histology of prostate ‘chips’ at TURP. But, most
importantly, the widespread use of PSA testing (and TRUS biopsies)
has led to the diagnosis of cancers that would not previously have
come to clinical attention during a man’s lifetime.
• Very rare age <40, uncommon age <50. Common age >80 (found at
post-mortem in 80%).
• 71 in 6 ♂ will develop the disease, and 71 in 25 will die from it.
• Average age at diagnosis 70–74, average age at death 80–84.
• A variation in the prevalence of prostate cancer around the world
(Europe, USA, and Australia > Asia and North Africa) suggests genetic
factors.
• Black men > white men > Asian men (possibly s to hormonal
differences).
• Familial predisposition also occurs (75–10% cases). Such patients tend
to present 75–10 years earlier.
• X Other risk factors may have a limited role: obesity, diet (high in
animal fat, low in vegetables), and hormones (there appear to be
no differences in serum androgen concentrations, but the use of
5A-reductase inhibitors for BPH reduces prostate cancer incidence
overall, albeit with an increase in higher-grade tumours).

Genetics
• There is evidence for a genetic component, but the identiﬁcation of
speciﬁc genes has proved difﬁcult.
• Risk is increased x2 in ♂ with ≥1 affected ﬁrst-degree relatives. Risk
increases with the number of affected family members, especially if
relatives are diagnosed at a young age (<60).
• There is a high rate of disease concordance in identical twins.
• Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (e.g. in the 8q24 and 17q
regions) are associated with an increased risk (the more SNPs present,
the higher the risk).
• The presence of BRCA1 and (particularly) BRCA2 mutations appears to
increase risk (and worsen prognosis).

PROSTATE CANCER: GENERAL

• Recently, a novel G84E mutation in the transcription factor HOXB13 in
the 17q region has been associated with a signiﬁcantly increased risk of
hereditary prostate cancer.

Pathology
• High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is a precursor of
malignancy. It is intermediate between normal prostate epithelium and
cancer.
• 95% adenocarcinomas. 4% have transitional cell morphology
(arising from prostatic urethral urothelium). Squamous cell and
neuroendocrine tumours are very rare.
• 70% arise in the peripheral, 15–20% in the central, and 10–15% in the
transitional zone. Many cancers are multifocal, involving multiple zones.
• Local invasion causes spread into the bladder neck (transition zone
tumours) and ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles (peripheral zone
tumours).
• Capsular penetration, with spread along the perineural or vascular
spaces, occurs relatively late.
• Metastasizes to bone more commonly than any other site, causing
sclerotic lesions.
• The natural history of the disease is extremely variable. Some
low-grade tumours follow an indolent course, whilst others rapidly
invade and metastasize.

Clinical features
Prostate cancers are often identiﬁed in asymptomatic patients, following
an abnormal screening PSA level or DRE (or as an incidental pathologic
ﬁnding at TURP).
Local disease
• LUTS (often late and more likely to be s to BPE), erectile dysfunction,
haematospermia.
• Urinary retention, back or leg pain, and frank haematuria were more
common in the pre-PSA era.
Advanced disease
• Weight loss and anorexia.
• Anaemia.
• Bone marrow suppression.
• Skeletal pain.
• Spinal cord compression.
• Leg swelling and pain s to venous and lymphatic obstruction.
• Uraemic symptoms from obstructive uropathy.
Physical examination
• DRE: nodules, changes in texture, asymmetry. Obliteration of
the lateral sulcus or seminal vesical involvement indicates locally
advanced disease.  Many cancers are found in glands that feel
normal. Furthermore, an abnormal prostate on DRE should always be
investigated, even if the PSA is normal (720% patients).
• Distended bladder.
• Abnormal lower limbs or neurological ﬁndings.

•

Urine for M,C+S.
PSA (b p. 772).
U&E, eGFR, Ca2+, alkaline phosphatase (skeletal involvement).
Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS):
• Used to evaluate abnormalities on DRE and to guide biopsy.
• Tumours are often, but not universally, hypoechoic.
• Also permits gland volume measurement.
• Useful prior to focal therapy (e.g. cryotherapy) and for the
detection of seminal vesicle invasion or extracapsular extension.
• Biopsy is usually necessary, regardless of TRUS appearances, as
TRUS alone is not sufﬁciently sensitive.
• TRUS-guided biopsy:
• Indicated for tissue diagnosis in those with i PSA or abnormal DRE.
• Performed as an ambulatory technique under LA.
• Extended biopsy protocols, with more extensive sampling, is
now the norm. These usually involve the removal of at least
10–12 cores.
• Repeat biopsy may be necessary.
• A transperineal (TP) approach is also commonly used and has the
advantage of allowing additional samples to be taken (particularly
when a TRUS biopsy has proved inconclusive).
• Complications: haematospermia (common), haematuria, pain,
1 infection, voiding difﬁculties, PR bleeding.
• Imaging:
• USS pre- and post-micturition (with ﬂow rate) + upper tracts if
signiﬁcant BOO or residual bladder volume.
• Further imaging contributes to pre-treatment staging:
• Both CT and MRI can detect local tumour invasion and
lymphadenopathy. MRI generally provides more accurate T staging.
• Endorectal MRI, via an endorectal probe, improves spatial
resolution of MRI for zonal anatomy, extracapsular extension, and
seminal vesicle involvement.
• Pre-biopsy 3-Tesla multiparametric MRI is increasingly used to
identify suspicious areas that can subsequently be targeted for
TRUS or TP-biopsy. These scans can also generate a cancer risk
score.
• MR spectroscopy imaging (MRSI), a technique that utilizes
metabolite ratios within prostate tissue to distinguish normal from
malignant tissue, has an evolving role.
• Bone scan: if T3 or T4 disease, PSA >20ng/mL, skeletal symptoms,
i Ca2+ or alkaline phosphatase. Correlate with plain X-rays.
• Prostascint scan: a radiolabelled mAb to prostate-speciﬁc
membrane antigen can localize soft tissue metastases.
• FDG-PET has only limited utility: tracer uptake is variable, and
accumulation in the bladder obscures the area of interest.

PROSTATE CANCER: INVESTIGATION

Staging
• Staging guides initial therapy and is undertaken using the TNM system.
• In addition, histological grade is determined from biopsy specimens,
using the Gleason score.
• Gleason grade is based on the extent to which the epithelium has a
normal glandular structure (1–5). Experience and skill on the part of
the pathologist is essential.
• Based on growth pattern and degree of differentiation, tumours are
graded from 1 to 5 where grade 1 is the most and grade 5 the least
differentiated. Adding together the values for the two most prevalent
patterns of differentiation derives a composite Gleason score, e.g. for
a biopsy consisting of predominant grade 4 and secondary grade 3
disease, the composite score is 4 + 3, or 7.
• 2–4 = low-grade or well-differentiated; 5–7 = moderate grade or
moderately differentiated; 8–10 = high-grade or poorly differentiated.
• In the TNM classiﬁcation, anatomic staging is undertaken both clinically
(cT) and pathologically (pT) (see Table 9.12).
• cT (based on DRE, imaging, and TRUS biopsy) informs initial
treatment decisions but may underestimate disease extent.
• pT (restaging at prostatectomy) provides a more exact assessment.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

• Disease-free survival for localized prostate cancer varies widely, as
treatment outcomes depend on tumour aggressiveness.
• With this in mind, the 2010 TNM classiﬁcation uses clinical stage,
Gleason score, and PSA to inform ﬁve prognostic groups.
• Other models have previously been developed to predict higher
risk disease. Examples: Memorial Loan-Kettering Cancer Center risk
groups (M http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/10088.cfm) and Partin
tables (M http://urology.jhu.edu/prostate/partintables.php).
• There is also growing interest in molecular prognostic markers, such as
p53, E-cadherin, cathepsin-D, and angiogenesis (microvessel density).
• Overall, 5-year survival for low-volume, localized disease (often
detected through screening) is 100% but 730% in those with
metastases.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

Prostate cancer: screening
Introduction
Cancer screening
Successful screening requires accurate, acceptable, and cost-effective tests
that identify clinically relevant cancers at a preclinical stage. Treatments
should be available that can improve outcomes when administered early
(and not cause harm).
Prostate cancer screening rationale
Early detection and management of asymptomatic prostate cancer through
screening could reduce morbidity and mortality, compared to treatment
instituted at the time of clinical presentation and diagnosis.

Prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA)
• PSA is an epithelial cell glycoprotein that liqueﬁes semen.
• Malignant prostate tissue generates more PSA in the blood than
normal or hyperplastic tissue (i cellularity + disruption of the
prostate: blood barrier).
• Developed for cancer surveillance, but use as a screening tool grew
rapidly: by 2001, 75% aged >50 in the USA had undergone testing.
• PSA has doubled the lifetime risk of a diagnosis of prostate cancer.
• 790% of prostate cancers are now detected through PSA screening.
• It is difﬁcult to deﬁne a normal range for PSA—it is a continuum that
increases with age >40 ( a ‘normal’ PSA does not rule out cancer).
• Nonetheless, 0–4.0ng/mL is the generally accepted range (see Box 9.4).
A PSA of >4.0ng/mL gives:
• 720% sensitivity and 790% speciﬁcity for prostate cancer.
• Positive predictive value 730% (>50% for PSA levels >10ng/mL), i.e.
7 2/3 of ♂ with an elevated PSA do not have cancer.
• If PSA >10ng/mL, <50% tumours will be prostate-localized.
• Other causes of an i PSA: BPE, prostatitis, cystitis, ejaculation (in
previous 48h), perineal trauma, vigorous exercise, urinary retention,
DRE (minimal effect), prostate biopsy (in previous 6 weeks).
• Conversely, treatment with 5A-reductase inhibitors d PSA by 750%.

Box 9.4 Measures to improve diagnostic utility of PSA
• Lower PSA cut-off (e.g. <3ng/mL). Involves a trade-off between
sensitivity (which improves) and speciﬁcity (which deteriorates), i.e.
more false positives and more unnecessary biopsies.
• PSA velocity. PSA increases more rapidly in ♂ with cancer. A rise of
>0.75ng/mL/year suggests increased risk.
• PSA density. Prostate cancers produce more PSA per volume of
tissue than benign conditions. Requires TRUS or endorectal MRI to
determine prostate volume, so a specialist tool only.
• Free PSA. PSA exists in a free, as well as bound, form. The ratio of
free to total PSA is reduced in men with cancer (<25%).
• Age- (or race-) speciﬁc reference ranges, for example:
• Age 50–59: 0–3.0ng/mL; age 60–69: 0–4.0ng/mL; age >70: 0–5.0ng/mL.

PROSTATE CANCER: SCREENING

Potential beneﬁts
• May detect prostate cancer before symptoms manifest.
• May detect early cancer, enabling cure or life-extending treatment.

Why the ongoing controversy?
Screening is certainly associated with detection of more cancers, but:
• PSA testing was introduced without evidence from clinical trials.
Although patchy observational data lend support to screening, the two
largest randomized controlled studies have proved inconsistent.
• The European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer
(ERSPC) demonstrated a 20% d in mortality in men aged 55–69
after 9 years. It suggested saving one life would require diagnosis
and treatment in 48 men.
• The United States Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer
(PLCO) Screening Trial has found no beneﬁt after 13 years.
• Neither study is ﬂawless—both have been subjected to criticism.
• A signiﬁcant number of tumours detected are clinically indolent, i.e.
unlikely to cause clinical illness during a man’s lifetime.
• The ideal screening investigation would identify asymptomatic men with
aggressive localized tumours. PSA testing falls short of this aspiration, as
it cannot differentiate slow-growing from aggressive cancers.
• PSA screening has inadequate sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
• Optimal screening intervals are unclear.
• PSA testing is not cancer-speciﬁc (also elevated in benign conditions)
or diagnostic (it triggers further diagnostic investigation, i.e. biopsy).
• It is not clear if it should be combined with DRE for initial screening
(variably recommended in international guidelines).
• The optimal treatment for early cancer is unknown—active
surveillance might be as good as radical prostatectomy or
radiotherapy.
• However, the majority with an early-stage cancer (understandably)
opt for aggressive treatment.
• Such (over-) treatment can cause harm. Complications include
urinary, sexual, and bowel dysfunction (as well as anxiety).

Guidelines
• Routine screening is not currently recommended in the UK. Rather, a
programme of informed choice is suggested, i.e. men concerned about
prostate cancer should receive clear and balanced information about
the pros and cons of PSA testing.
• In the USA, both the American Cancer Society and American
Urological Association advocate screening. However, the inﬂuential
Preventative Services Task Force has recently recommended against it.
This has refuelled an already long running debate in a country where
prostate cancer screening costs an estimated $3 billion annually.
• In general, screening, or at least a discussion about screening, is
recommended for men aged ≥50 on an annual basis, unless life
expectancy is <10 years (through comorbidity or age >75).
• Discussions should begin age 40–45 in black men or those with a family
history.

Prostate cancer: management
Overview
The overall direction of treatment should be guided by:
• Life expectancy (as determined by age and comorbidity).
• Predictions of tumour aggressiveness.
• Informed patient choice (see Table 9.13 for risk stratiﬁcation).

Localized (prostate-limited) disease
Overall 10-year survival is >90%. Treatments include radical prostatectomy, radiation (either brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy), and
active surveillance. If any offers an advantage is controversial. Ongoing
clinical trials (e.g. PIVOT, ProtecT) hope to resolve this.

Regular follow-up, including PSA, is mandatory. PSA post-prostatectomy
should be <0.2ng/mL and post-radiation <0.5ng/mL. PSA doubling time
may also be used as an indicator of the need for ‘salvage’ treatment.

Locally advanced (non-prostate-limited) disease
Androgen ablation with radiotherapy is generally advocated. Prostatectomy
may be appropriate in selected cases.

Metastatic disease
The goals are to control symptoms and slow further progression.

Treatment modalities
See Table 9.14 for management options.

PROSTATE CANCER: MANAGEMENT

Watchful waiting
Monitoring with hormonal manipulation and palliation when disease progression occurs. Usually reserved for elderly, comorbid patients.
Active surveillance
Deﬁnitive treatment (surgery/radiation) is deferred until evidence of
progression, with the aim of avoiding unnecessary complications in those
whose cancers may not progress. PSA is performed 3–6-monthly and DRE
annually. Most protocols include repeat biopsy(s).
Radical prostatectomy
• The prostate and seminal vesicles are completely removed. Lymph
node sampling and dissection is often undertaken.
• Retropubic approach: open or laparoscopic technique, the latter often
with robotic assistance. Perineal approach: less pain, hidden scar, and
shorter hospital stay, but less access to lymph nodes.
• Complications: impotence, stricture, urinary and faecal incontinence.
• X Surgical margins and lymph node positivity will determine need for
adjuvant radiotherapy or hormone manipulation. Trials ongoing.
External beam radiotherapy
SE: radiation proctitis, cystitis, and urethritis. Erectile dysfunction.
Brachytherapy
Transperineal implantation of radioactive seeds.
Hormone-based therapy (androgen deprivation)
• Aims to decrease androgenic tumour stimulation and 6 delay
progression.
• Bilateral surgical orchidectomy (castration): effective but unpopular.
• ‘Medical’ castration:
• Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues ld luteinizing
hormone (LH) production ld testicular androgen synthesis.
Initially, i androgen production, potentially causing disease ‘ﬂare’.
Examples: leuprolide, goserelin (depot formulations often used).
• GnRH antagonists l block GnRH receptors without initial ﬂare.
Example: degarelix.
• Oestrogens ld hypothalamic GnRH release ld pituitary LH
release ld testicular androgens. Example: diethylstilbestrol.
• Anti-androgens l competitive blockade of androgen receptors.
Since androgen levels remain normal, side effects (esp. impotence)
are fewer (although gynaecomastia can be problematic).
Examples: bicalutamide, ﬂutamide. Often used in together
with a GnRH analogue, either initially (to d androgen ﬂare) or
continuously (to block 10% contribution of adrenally synthesized
androgens).
• SE: 2 common and require detailed discussion. Sexual dysfunction
(majority), hot ﬂushes (majority), fatigue, anaemia, muscle wasting,
osteoporosis (and fractures), gynaecomastia, d genitalia size, d
body hair, psychological changes.

CHAPTER 9

Essential urology

• Intermittent treatment regimens (according to PSA) are often used,
with increasing evidence to support this approach.
• Eventual PSA ‘escape’, despite castrate levels of testosterone
heralding a deteriorating prognosis.
• Second-line hormonal treatments, including abiraterone and
enzalutamide, signiﬁcantly improve survival and show that the
androgen receptor remains a relevant therapeutic target despite
castrate levels of testosterone. Corticosteroids, e.g. dexamethasone
(l ACTH suppression ld adrenal androgens) have a limited role.
Other
• Chemotherapy (docetaxel, cabazitaxel) reserved for
‘castration-resistant’ tumours.
• Several new agents have shown signiﬁcant promise and are either
in, or about to enter, clinical practice. These include radioisotopes
(alpharadin) and bone-targeting agents, such as bisphosphonates
(zoledronic acid, mAb directed against RANKL (denosumab), and
immunotherapy.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Sodium: salt and water balance
The human body is made up of 50–60% water by weight. More accurately,
total body water (TBW) in litres can be estimated as weight (kg) x a correction factor, as in Table 10.1.
Table 10.1 Estimation of TBW
♂

♀

<65 years old

0.6

0.5

>65 years old

0.5

0.45

So, in a 70kg ♂ <65 years old, TBW = 0.6 x 70 = 42L. Water is contained
in speciﬁc compartments:
• Intracellular space (72/3 TBW, or 28L in a 70kg ♂).
• Extracellular ﬂuid is then 71/3 TBW, or 14L in a 70kg ♂. This includes:
• Interstitial ﬂuid (72/3 ECF water, or 9.4L in a 70kg ♂).
• Plasma (71/3 ECF water, or 4.6L in a 70kg ♂).
The hydrophobic cell membrane acts as a barrier between intra- and
extracellular ﬂuid, and the capillary wall separates plasma from the
interstitium. Every compartment maintains osmotic pressure through an
actively retained speciﬁc solute:
• Intracellular: K+ (pumped inwards by Na+/K+ ATPase).
• ECF: Na+ (see next paragraph).
• Plasma: proteins (esp. albumin, impermeable through the normal
endothelial barrier).
Extracellular volume is controlled by Na+ retention and excretion (water
will passively follow salt). The body ignores the ECF as a whole and ‘samples’ a portion of it: the effective arterial blood volume (EABV).1
• Amounts to 7700mL (blood in the arterial tree at any one time).
• Is a function of cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular
resistance (SVR).
Changes in EABV (due to hypovolaemia, d CO, or d SVR) are sensed by:
• Systemic baroreceptors (carotid sinus, aortic arch).
• Intrarenal volume sensors (juxtaglomerular apparatus).
With d EABV, these volume sensors activate the sympathetic nervous
system, with Na+ then retained by the kidney (often to u-Na+ <10mmol/L).
Conversely, with i EABV, salt wasting (>100mmol/L) takes place with
appropriate changes in TBW. This requires intact renal salt handling (and
kidney function) for such homeostasis.
Low-pressure volume receptors, sited in the atria and the great veins
(NOT contributing to EABV sensing), are also important: i ECF leads to
increased atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release and renal salt wasting,
as well as suppressing sympathetic tone. These receptors may control
non-osmotic ADH release if the ECF is underﬁlled.

SODIUM: SALT AND WATER BALANCE

Falling EABV increases sympathetic tone
• i circulating catecholamines, leading to i CO and i SVR.
• Activated renin–angiotensin system, improving renal haemodynamics
and salt retention through s hyperaldosteronism.
• i non-osmotic ADH (vasopressin) release.

Rising EABV (including low-pressure whole ECF
sensing)
• i ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide, a potent natriuretic).
• Suppressed renin production and thus angiotensin and aldosterone.

Water handling
TBW is mainly regulated by cerebral (circumventricular) and peripheral
osmoreceptors (not volume sensors) capable of sensing changes in ECF
osmolality: i osmolality triggers thirst and pituitary ADH (vasopressin) release. Relatively dilute urine arrives at the collecting duct, as Na+
reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle occurs without
water (this is the basis for the countercurrent mechanism, leading to a
hypertonic medullary interstitium).
Without ADH, this ﬂuid is passed, little modiﬁed, as urine (and polyuria of DI (b p. 789)). ADH binds V2 (vasopressin) receptors on the
basolateral aspect of the principal cells in the collecting duct, leading to
translocation of aquaporins to the apical membrane where these water
channels allow free water absorption along an osmolar gradient into the
hypertonic interstitium.
With water loading, osmoreceptors sense a falling osmolality. Thirst
and ADH release are suppressed l dilute urine is formed, rapidly
(within 6h) restoring normal osmolality (7285mOsmol/kg).
With water depletion, osmoreceptors sense i osmolality, trigger ADH
release, retain water, with (highly) concentrated urine. Increased thirst
eventually corrects the absolute water deﬁcit.
So, for normal water homeostasis, an individual needs:
• An intact thirst centre.
• Access to water.
• The ability to secrete ADH (vasopressin).
• A responsive collecting duct.
Abnormalities in one or more of these components l abnormal water
homeostasis.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Hyponatraemia—approach
The NR for Na+ is 135–145mmol/L. As with many electrolyte disorders, d
Na+ is relatively common in hospitalized patients—this is particularly true
for elderly inpatients where up to 6% will have Na+ <125. However, even
in an apparently healthy elderly (>65) population, 7% of people have Na+
<137. The effects of ageing on the kidney may impair free water excretion
or, at least, slow the capacity to excrete a water load. This may be further
exacerbated by prescribed drugs, such as diuretics or NSAIDs.
Most hyponatraemic patients are thought to be asymptomatic—but
perception and gait disturbances increase as Na+ falls (and improve with
correction). Investigators have correlated d Na+ with fracture risk and
compared the effects of chronic (apparently) asymptomatic hyponatraemia
with similar features of alcohol use.2 In hospital, symptomatic hyponatraemia is associated with a mortality of 10–50%. As hyponatraemia usually
occurs as a result of altered water balance, making the correct clinical
assessment of body water is then the key to management.

Assessment starts with volume status
Is the patient clinically:
• Hypovolaemic?
• Euvolaemic?
• Hypervolaemic?

Pseudohyponatraemia
Pseudohyponatraemia results when Na+ is corrected for a falsely large
volume, rather than the actual aqueous phase: occurs with i lipids, i
plasma proteins (2 myeloma), or hyperglycaemia (2 for every 5mmol/L
above the normal range for glucose, correct d by 1.7mmol/L). Glycineor sorbitol-containing bladder irrigants may also be absorbed, esp. after
prostatectomy, falsely d Na+.

Causes
Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia (depleted ECF where Na+ loss >
water loss)
• Renal losses:
• Diuretics (thiazides, in particular).
• Osmotic diuresis (glucose, urea in recovering ATN).
• Salt-wasting nephropathy (due to chronic tubular dysfunction).
• Addison’s disease.
• Non-renal losses:
• Diarrhoea or vomiting.
• Sweating.
• ‘Third space’ losses (burns, bowel obstruction, pancreatitis).
2 Severe volume depletion causes a state of appropriate ADH secretion: although initially suppressed as Na+d, hypovolaemia overrides
osmoreceptor-induced inhibition and is a potent stimulus for ADH release
despite the Na+ concentration.

HYPONATRAEMIA—APPROACH

Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia (excess ECF where water
retention > Na+ retention)
• CCF.
• Nephrotic syndrome or CRF.
• Cirrhosis.
Euvolaemic hyponatraemia (with a normal ECF)
• Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH):
• Pneumonia, COPD, TB, other lung diseases (usually with d pO2).
• Malignancy (usually small cell lung cancer, occasionally head and
neck tumours).
• Drugs (antipsychotics, NSAIDs, antidepressants).
• Neurological disease (e.g. CVA, trauma, acute psychosis, tumours).
• Pain, opiates, stress ( surgery).
• Hypothyroidism.

Hyponatraemia—assessment
Symptoms and signs
Rare if chronic or Na+ >125mmol/L. Common if acute or Na+ <110mmol/L.
Headache, apathy, confusion (esp. in elderly) l seizures and coma.
Symptoms due to cerebral swelling as osmolality falls: the encephalopathy
is exacerbated by d pO2 of any cause.
If i ECF (overloaded) or d ECF (dry), the diagnosis is usually apparent.

Investigations
2 Everything depends on good clinical volume assessment.
Recheck an abnormal result (’drip arm’ Na+ in patients on 5% dextrose infusions).
• U&E, plasma osmolality (normal/i if pseudohyponatraemia).
• d K+ and d Mg2+ potentiate ADH release ( diuretics).
• Urine osmolality (u-Osm should be <100mOsmol/kg and will be if
ADH suppressed (e.g. psychogenic polydipsia)).
• Urine Na+ (if <20mmol/L = non-renal salt losses; if >40mmol/L
= SIADH (unless salt intake low))— diuretics may confound
interpretation of urinary electrolytes.
• Urine dipstick for SG and protein.
• TSH and 9 a.m. cortisol if indicated.
• Ca2+, albumin, glucose, LFT. d s-urate is common with SIADH.
2 Consider Addison’s if d Na+, i K+, and volume depletion—check random cortisol and ACTH, and, if unwell, treat with vigorous 0.9% saline
replacement and IMI hydrocortisone.

Diagnosing SIADH
•

d Na+ in patients not on diuretics.
Euvolaemic (i.e. no oedema).

Urine osmolality >100mOsmol/kg, often >300mOsmol/kg.
Urine Na+ >20mmol/L (unless salt-restricted).
Serum urate may be d as well.

2 ADH may be released inappropriately from the pituitary or from cells
of neuroendocrine origin in the lungs.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Management of hyponatraemia
In all cases
• Identify those at most risk for neurological complications, and manage
those most at risk with repeated review:
• Acute hyponatraemia (<48 hours).
• Thiazide-induced d Na+.
• Premenopausal ♀ (? oestrogen, i responsiveness to ADH).
• Malnourished or alcoholic patients.
• Even if well, i surveillance, as for symptomatic patients, with
repeated Na+ checks (see below).
• Assess the volume status correctly (b pp. 12 and 114): the key to
correct diagnosis and management.
• Stop contributing drugs 9 ﬂuids ( 5% dextrose).
• Correct d K+ (b p. 798) and d Mg2+ (b p. 808), if present.

Is the patient symptomatic (encephalopathic) or
is Na+ <120mmol/L?
• No: respond according to volume status (b see below). As a
general rule, err on the side of cautious correction (if correction is
needed at all).
• Yes: see b p. 786. Requires action—urgent if symptomatic.

Managing asymptomatic hyponatraemia
Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia
• Resuscitate with 0.9% NaCL (154mmol/L NaCl) at 1–3mL/kg/hr.
Always correct d K+ in concert by adding 20–40mmol KCl to each 1L
0.9% NaCl.
Euvolaemic hyponatraemia
• Usually SIADH in hospitals and in the elderly (see b p. 785).
Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia
• Manage conservatively ﬂuid restriction <1L/day (8 5 cups/day), and
consider 20–40mg furosemide od.

MANAGEMENT OF HYPONATRAEMIA

Managing asymptomatic SIADH
• Fluid restrict <800mL/day—but do not expect this alone to work.
• Salt and loop diuretic: PO NaCl as 600mg 4–8 tablets daily (contains
10mmol/tab Na+, e.g. Slow Sodium®), furosemide 20–40mg/daily
(free water excretion in excess of urinary salt loss).  Monitor
closely (reserve as an inpatient tool).
• Demeclocycline 150–300mg 6-hourly induces nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus, reversing ADH effect. Use with caution in chronic
hyponatraemia, as diuresis may be brisk. Gut side effects often limit
longer-term use.
• Urea 30–90g/day (not readily available in the UK).
An alternative strategy would involve using vaptans:
• Tolvaptan (oral) and conivaptan (parenteral use for <4 days) are
‘aquaretics’.
• Serious liver injury has limited use, and evolving data suggests a
limited role for these agents.
• Oral competitive vasopressin (V2) receptor antagonists, blocking the
action of ADH on V2 (and V1) receptors, so preventing tubular water
uptake.
• Cause increased excretion of free water (without electrolyte
disturbance) by reducing AQP2 activity in the collecting duct, leaving
cells insensitive to ADH and less permeable to water.
• Demonstrated in phase II and III trials to effectively reverse
hyponatraemia in euvolaemic and hypervolaemic states.
• Expect i Na+ 6–7mmol/L on tolvapatan 15mg od.
•  Do not ﬂuid-restrict—allow patients access to free water, and
monitor serum Na+ regularly.
• Predominantly studied in chronic hyponatraemia with Na+
>120mmol/L.
• Uncertain: indications for treatment (level of Na? Symptoms?),
long-term survival advantage (may d hospital stay), duration of
treatment.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Hyponatraemia with encephalopathy
X The brain and d Na+
The skull limits the brain’s capacity to increase in size: with d Na+, a falling
osmolality li intracellular water and symptomatic brain swelling. The
tight junctions between endothelial cells and astrocyte foot processes
that constitute the blood–brain barrier permit aquaporin-mediated
water movement along osmotic gradients. In response, the cerebral ECF
is rapidly reduced (to allow more room) and intracellular organic solutes (including the amino acid taurine) exported (lessens the osmolar
gradient that causes water inﬂux) over 1–2 days.
If too rapid correction of chronic d Na+ occurs, osmotic or central pontine
myelinosis (CPM) may occur. As the brain cannot restore the solute contribution to intracellular tonicity quickly, when the ECF osmolality is rapidly
normalized, water leaves cells, causing cerebral dehydration and demyelination (affecting the whole brain, not just the pons, as in the original description). Symptoms become apparent after around 24 hours.
• Manage in high dependency setting.
• Na+ by as little as 3–7mmol/L will usually treat symptoms.
• Repeat Na+ every 2 hours initially, and then 4-hourly.
• IF acute, <48 hours’ duration (often post-operative):
– Aim for i Na+ by 2mmol/L/h or until asymptomatic.
– Never correct by >10mmol/L/24 hours.
• IF chronic, >48 hours’ duration:
– Always consider CPM.
– Aim for i Na+ by 0.5mmol/L/h to i by 6mmol/L or until
asymptomatic.
– Aim for +8mmol/L in 24 hours, and do not correct by
>10mmol/L/24 hours.
• Other measures:
– Add in furosemide to prevent volume overload (as 20mg IVI
8-hourly). The diuresis caused will be hypotonic (i.e. water in
excess of salt), adding to sodium correction.
– In volume-overloaded patients intolerant of salt loads, 20%
mannitol may be useful to allow use of 3% saline.
– Do not correct by >10mmol/L/24 hours.
• Calculate Na+ deﬁcit, and select appropriate mode of
administration.
• Na+ deﬁcit = total body water x [desired Na+– actual Na+].
– TBW = 60% body weight in ♂ and 50% body weight in ♀.
– If age >65, use 50% BW in ♂ and 45% BW in ♀.
– For example, aiming for a safe Na+ of 125mmol/L in 53-year-old
70kg ♂ with Na+ 115, deﬁcit = 0.6 x 70 x 10 = 420mmol Na+.
• Generally, use 2.7% or 3% (hypertonic) saline, containing 462mmol
and 513mmol NaCl, respectively, per 1L.
• Deliver via a central line.
• Estimate effect of infusion by calculating change in Na+:

HYPONATRAEMIA WITH ENCEPHALOPATHY

Change in Na + =

If a rapid increase were required (e.g. if ﬁtting) and a target of >120mmol/L
were desired over 3 hours (see next paragraph), aim to infuse [5/9.25 x
1L] = 540mL of 3% saline at 180mL/h.
X An alternate strategy in ﬁtting patients is to give a bolus of 100mL 2.7%
or 3% NaCl, and repeat after 10 minutes.
Sodium ‘guesstimates’: for every 1L infused, a crude estimate of the
sodium change in plasma might be:
• 3% NaCl (Na+ 513mmol/L) i 13mmol/L.
• 0.9% NaCl (Na+ 154mmol/L) i 1.4mmol/L.
• 5% glucose (Na+ 0) d 3.5mmol/L.
Do not guess if you have time.

788

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Hypernatraemia
Serum Na+ >146mmol/L is usually due to a water deﬁcit and is associated with severe underlying disease and signiﬁcant mortality (9 50%).
With i Na+, ECF osmolality i, increasing osmotic drag on the intracellular
compartment. This leads to cellular dehydration, most importantly in the
brain: loss of volume creates vascular shear stress, resulting in bleeding
and thrombosis. As in hyponatraemia (b p. 780), compensation begins
with cellular retention of salts and organic solutes in the brain, increasing cellular tonicity and lessening water losses to the hyperosmolar ECF
(occurs over days). Overzealous correction leads to too rapid intracranial
expansion of the brain, with potential tentorial herniation. Causes include:

Excess hypertonic ﬂuids
• IVI infusions (2 antibiotics), TPN, or enteral feeds.
• Rarely, salt ingestion, or sea water near-drowning.

Excess water loss
• Renal:
• Diabetes insipidus (see Box 10.1), with/out altered thirst.
• Diuretics.
• Osmotic diuresis (glucose in DKA, urea in recovering ATN).
• Gut:
• Diarrhoea (and laxatives, such as lactulose).
• Vomiting, NG losses, or ﬁstulae.
• Skin:
• Sweating, burns.

Decreased thirst
In the unwell and elderly, esp. if on psychotropic drugs.

Symptoms and signs
Reﬂect cerebral dehydration. Thirst, apathy, weakness, confusion ld consciousness, seizures, and coma. Cause often apparent clinically, with sepsis,
pneumonia, and uncontrolled diabetes common.

Investigations
U&E, plasma osmolality, glucose. Urine Na+, osmolality. With osmotic diuresis, u-Osm is always >300mOsmol/kg.

HYPERNATRAEMIA

Box 10.1 Diabetes insipidus
2 Polydipsia and polyuria (>6L/day) in adults without diabetes is usually
due to DI or psychogenic polydipsia.
ADH (also called arginine vasopressin, AVP) binds the V2 receptor on
collecting duct cells, leading to surface expression of free water channels, or aquaporins, through which water is rapidly taken up.
DI can be cranial (i.e. impaired release of ADH):
• Trauma or post-operative.
• Tumours or inﬁltrative processes (sarcoid, TB).
• Infective (meningitis, encephalitis).
• Cerebral vasculitis (SLE, Wegener’s).
More commonly, DI is nephrogenic (resistance to ADH). Causes include:
• Congenital.
• Drug-induced (lithium, amphotericin, foscarnet, demeclocycline).
• Hypokalaemia or hypercalcaemia.
• Tubulointerstitial disease (medullary cystic disease, b p. 599).
Lithium prevents translocation of aquaporins to the collecting duct apical membrane and is the most common cause of nephrogenic DI.
Diagnosis rests on ﬁnding i UO (>3L/day) with dilute urine
(<300mOsmol/kg). Exclude osmotic diuretics, d K+, or i Ca2+. A ﬂuid
deprivation test 9 DDAVP (synthetic analogue of ADH) is diagnostic
(2 seek expert advice).
Treatment depends on cause.
Cranial DI is treated with intranasal desmopressin 10–20 micrograms
bd. Drug effect lasts for 6–12 hours.
Nephrogenic DI, if congenital or lithium-induced, is treated with thiazide diuretics (hypovolaemia ld Na+ absorption proximally, 6 reduced
water delivery to the collecting duct) and NSAIDs (such as indometacin
which antagonizes the effect of ADH).
 Simultaneous use of desmopressin and 5% glucose should be used
with extreme caution (analogous to pouring water into a closed box).

Treatment of hypernatraemia

• Aim for Na+ 145mmol/L.
• Calculate water deﬁcit (and include ongoing losses in calculations):
Change in Na + =

Infusion fluid Na +
TBW + 1

Na +

for 1,000mL infusion

• TBW = 60% body weight in ♂ and 50% body weight in ♀.
• If age >65, use 50% weight in ♂ and 45% weight in ♀.
For example, in a 53-year-old 70 kg ♂ with Na+ 170mmol/L, TBW = 42L.
Using 5% glucose (no Na+), [0 – 170]/43 = –3.95mmol/L. So, 1L 5% dextrose will reduce Na+ to 166mmol/L. Aiming to correct only 0.5mmol/L/h
will require 1L/8h, or 125mL/h if no ongoing ﬂuid losses. As a rule of thumb,
allow for 1.5L insensible loss/day.
• Reassess patient repeatedly.
• If i Na+ is acute (<24 hours), can be reversed quickly. Usually occurs
with infusion of hypertonic solutions, but also with rapid loss of
hypotonic ﬂuid (sweating, burns).
• Correct at 1mmol/L/h.
• Measure Na+ 2-hourly initially, then 4-hourly.
• If chronic (>24 hours), correct more slowly to prevent rehydration
injury to the brain:
• Document neurological status.
• Correct at no greater than 0.5mmol/L/h or no less than 10mmol/L/
day.
• Correct 50% of the water deﬁcit in ﬁrst 12–24 hours.
• Correct remaining water deﬁcit over next 24–48 hours.
• Measure Na+ 2-hourly initially, then 4-hourly.

Choice of ﬂuid
• Water PO, if orientated, or per NG if able.
• 5% glucose or 0.45% (half-normal) saline IVI if cannot use the gut. May
require insulin to control hyperglycaemia if using 5% glucose.

OEDEMA AND ITS TREATMENT

Oedema and its treatment
Oedema occurs with interstitial expansion of the ECF, becoming clinically
apparent if >2L ﬂuid excess in this compartment. It is most obvious in the
dependent areas (ankles), but it may affect the face and eyelids, especially
in the morning. Anasarca refers to severe oedema, progressing from the
peripheries to the trunk. Oedema may occur with other extravascular
signs of salt and water retention (pleural effusions, ascites). Causes include:
• Congestive heart failure.
• Liver failure.
• Nephrotic syndrome (b p. 554).
• Acute or chronic renal failure (d GFR ld salt excretion).
• Drug-induced (NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers).
• Premenstrual or pregnant ♀ (oestrogen effect).
• Venous insufﬁciency (localized oedema).

Development of oedema
For oedema to develop, salt and water retention must occur (to expand
the ECF) and/or capillary permeability must increase (to allow ﬂuid shifts
into the interstitium).
The ‘overﬁll’ hypothesis suggests that Na+ retention is the primary factor
in the development of oedema: any state that leads to d EABV (b p. 778)
ls hyperaldosteronism, sympathetic overactivity, and non-osmotic ADH
release. This then causes salt and water retention, an increase in ECF volume, and oedema.
The ‘underﬁll’ hypothesis explains oedema associated with d albumin
as a fall in plasma oncotic pressure (provided largely by albumin) with
unchanged hydrostatic pressure, resulting in ﬂuid movement into the
extravascular space. This then leads to s ﬂuid retention.

Oedema and hypoalbuminaemia in the
nephrotic syndrome
Experimental evidence suggests the ‘underﬁll’ hypothesis to be incorrect with d s-albumin: the transcapillary oncotic gradient is maintained
with hypoalbuminaemia, as interstitial colloid osmotic pressure (COP)
is reduced in tandem with falls in the plasma COP (the interstitial ﬂuid
not only maintains a COP countering plasma COP, but can be varied).
Rather, inﬂammatory cytokines impair capillary permeability, a falling
EABV l salt retention, i urinary albumin modiﬁes Na+ handling directly
in the nephron, and renal resistance to ANP develops. The net effect is
one of salt retention, with equilibration of the expanded ECF into the
interstitium.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Diuretics
All diuretics block the reuptake of Na+, and thus Cl– and water. All circulate highly protein-bound and are thus not well ﬁltered by the glomerulus.
This complex is taken up from the peritubular ﬂuid by proximal tubular
cells and the diuretic released prior to excretion to act in the urinary
space (except for spironolactone and other mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonists). For use in hypertension, see b p. 498.

Commonly used diuretics include
Loop diuretics
• Site of action: blocks Na+ uptake at the Na+K+2Cl– (NKCC)
co-transporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.
• Speciﬁc side effects: i u-Ca2+, ototoxicity.
• Examples: furosemide, bumetanide, torasemide.
Thiazide diuretics
• Site of action: blocks Na+ uptake at the Na+Cl– co-transporter in the
distal tubule.
• Speciﬁc side effects: i u-Ca2+ (may cause hypercalcaemia).
• Examples: bendroﬂumethiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone,
indapamide.
Amiloride/triamterene
Site of action: blocks Na+ uptake at the apical Na+ channel (ENaC) in the
collecting duct.
Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
• Site of action: blocks Na+ uptake by downregulating apical Na+ channel
(ENaC) expression in the collecting duct. Spironolactone enters cells
from the circulation, rather than the urinary space, and binds the
intracellular mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).
• Speciﬁc side effects: i K+, anti-androgenic effects (not eplerenone).
• Examples: spironolactone, eplerenone.
• General side effects include: d K+ (not with spironolactone), d Na+, d
Mg2+, i uric acid, skin rashes, interstitial nephritis, dyslipidaemia
(X insulin resistance, impotence).

Using diuretics in oedematous states
 Always institute appropriate salt restriction when using diuretics, and
consider ﬂuid restriction to <1,000mL/day.
• Assess volume status daily.
• Measure weight daily to assess response.
• Strict input/output charts may be helpful.
• Measure serum electrolytes regularly.
• Monitoring u-Na+ excretion may be helpful in diuretic resistance.

DIURETICS

 Do not forget bed rest as a useful tool in mobilizing oedema and encouraging diuresis.

Nephrotic syndrome
Often requires high doses of loop diuretics (furosemide 160–240mg daily),
as i urinary albumin binds free diuretic. Consider add-on thiazide diuretics (e.g. metolazone 2.5–5mg/day PO), but beware rapid-onset d Na+, and
titrate dose against daily weight loss.
X Furosemide and albumin infusions are frequently used in an attempt
to improve drug delivery—probably without real beneﬁt. May be of use
if s-Alb <20g/dL. Administer as 100mL 20% human albumin solution, with
40–160mg furosemide IVI, over 2–4 hours.

Renal failure
Loop diuretic if GFR <50mL/min. May require 240mg PO daily in 2–3
divided doses. Best response with IVI loop diuretic (furosemide 200mg) or
as continuous infusion (furosemide 10–50mg/h to a maximum of 500mg/
day to prevent ototoxicity). Bumetanide is better absorbed and should
be considered in diuretic resistance (up to 8mg/day). If poor response,
consider add-on thiazide, as described in ‘Nephrotic syndrome’.

Congestive cardiac failure
Loop diuretics better than thiazides, e.g. furosemide 40mg od. Evidence
from RALES and EPHESUS trials has conﬁrmed a role for mineralocorticoid
receptor blockade, so this class often used as ﬁrst line. Hyperkalaemia is a
real concern, as such patients are often on ACE inhibitors or B-blockers
(b p. 797).

Cirrhosis
Spironolactone (50–200mg od) prevents s hyperaldosteronism, with
add-on thiazide (not loop—too marked a diuresis may precipitate ARF) if
required. Resistant ascites is best treated with paracentesis under albumin
cover. As it is difﬁcult to resorb more than 1L of ascites over a day, a diuresis that sees daily weight loss of >0.5kg (where 1kg is a surrogate for 1L
negative balance through diuresis, and not related to paracentesis) should
cause concern over precipitating pre-renal failure.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Potassium
K+ is the second most abundant cation in the body (73.5mol). Dietary
K+ amounts to 80–150mmol/day. Only around 65mmol is present in the
ECF, with the great majority (98%) found within cells in muscle (and, to a
lesser extent, liver, red cells, and bone). Once absorbed, K+ is rapidly buffered by removal from the ECF into the intracellular compartment: insulin
and B-adrenergic catecholamines stimulate membrane Na+/K+-ATPase to
pump K+ into cells (in a 3:2 ratio). This electrochemical gradient (the cell
membrane potential) is critical to nerve conduction, muscle contraction,
and normal cell function.
Total body K+ balance is regulated by renal excretion: K+ is freely ﬁltered at the glomerulus (7700mmol/day) and is reabsorbed by the PCT
(75%), the loop of Henle (15%), and the A-intercalated cells of the collecting duct. K+ secretion is responsible for most urinary potassium loss and
is tightly controlled by aldosterone in the DCT and the principal cells of
the collecting duct. The collecting duct ROMK channel is the major channel through which K+ is secreted, whereas maxi-K+ tends to respond to
increased ﬂow in the distal nephron and secrete K+.
In health, around 1–1.5mmol/kg/day is excreted in urine, with a small
fraction (710mmol) in faeces.
2 Obligate urinary K+ loss (10–15mmol/day) will always occur, no matter
how low the serum K+
Aldosterone secretion is increased directly by hyperkalaemia (and hypovolaemia) and suppressed by hypokalaemia, controlling K+ in the normal
range (3.5–5.0mmol/L). Aldosterone l Na+ absorption through ENaC,
the epithelial sodium channel. As luminal electronegativity increases with
Na+ absorption, Cl– uptake is enhanced along paracellular pathways, with
secretion of K+ and H+ back into the lumen. Other factors are important
in urinary K+ excretion:
• Flow in the distal tubule activates stretch-sensitive K+ channels li
urinary K+ loss.
• i tubular sodium delivery li luminal sodium-activating ENaC directly.
• ADH or vasopressin may stimulate (some) sodium reabsorption, so i
K+ loss.
• Alkalosis.
WNK proteins (with no lysine (K)) are key modulators of K+ excretion
and potentially of ﬂuid and sodium balance as well—their role in K+ control continues to be clariﬁed.

CHAPTER 10

Hyperkalaemia
See b p. 130 for further discussion.
True hyperkalaemia is either due to increased release from cells or
decreased excretion by the kidney. Since the release of important trials
using spironolactone or eplerenone (in addition to ACE inhibitors) in the
treatment of heart failure, dangerous hyperkalaemia has become more
common in those with better renal function.

Pseudohypokalaemia
2 i K+ is often spurious: always recheck result. Traumatic venepuncture
l cellular K+ leakage and false hyperkalaemia. This l 1–2mmol/L rise in
the apparent K+. Fine-bore needles, tourniquets, and ﬁst clenching can
all induce mechanical release of K+ from cells, as can cold temperature.
More common with i WCC (>100) or i platelet count (>400 x 109).

Common causes include
• CKD per se.
• K+-rich diets (bananas, other fruits) with CKD.
• Drug-induced (esp. combinations of the following):
• ACE inhibitors/ARB.
• K+-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride).
• NSAIDs.
• Heparin and LMW heparins (inhibit normal aldosterone release).
• Ciclosporin.
• High-dose trimethoprim.
• Digoxin toxicity (but not therapeutic levels of digoxin).
• B-blockers.
• Hypoaldosteronism (including type 4 RTA, b p. 825).
• Addison’s.
• Increased release from cells:
• Acidosis (lactic).
• Insulin deﬁciency (DKA).
• Rhabdomyolysis, strenuous exercise, or tumour lysis.
• Massive haemolysis.
• Succinylcholine use.

HYPERKALAEMIA

Hyperkalaemia with aldosterone antagonism
RALES and EPHESUS, two major trials demonstrating a 15–30% reduction in mortality due to CCF in patients treated with agents that block
the action of aldosterone (spironolactone, eplerenone), launched an
era of aldosterone antagonism in heart failure and beyond. Widespread
use (occasionally inappropriate) has followed—clinical trials have been
designed to exclude those with signiﬁcant renal disease (those most at
risk of hyperkalaemia).
In 2004, Juurlink et al. described the effects of instituting these trials in
less well-deﬁned populations with heart failure in Ontario and demonstrated a 6-fold i in hyperkalaemic deaths. Since ACE inhibitors/ARB are
also indicated to treat CCF, serious hyperkalaemia may occur. If using
such combination therapy:
• Calculate GFR (b pp. 30–37)—caution if abnormal.
• Stop NSAIDs.
• Advise about dietary K+ restriction (b p. 259).
• If d GFR <60mL/min, add in loop diuretic to waste K+.
• If acidotic (s-HCO3– <21mmol/L), add NaHCO3 500–600mg bd.
• Do not increase spironolactone above 25mg/day if + ACE inhibitor.
• Check K+ regularly. If K+ >5.5mmol/L, discontinue either ACE-I/ARB or
spironolactone/eplerenone.
 Hyperkalaemia arises when dehydration, concurrent illness, or deteriorating renal or cardiac function supervenes in patients on combination therapy. Always check K+. Those with K+ >5.0 are at risk.

Rare causes of hyperkalaemia include
• Hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis: mutations in skeletal Na+ channel
SCN4A coded on 17q23 lead to episodic paralysis, i K+, and d Na+ in
response to varied triggers, as Na+ and water are pumped into cells in
exchange for K+.
• Type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronsim: presents in infancy as salt wasting,
d Na+, and collapse. Either due to resistance to the actions of
aldosterone (defect in type 1 mineralocorticoid receptor, with i K+)
or defects in ENaC (b p. 931).
• Gordon’s syndrome (type 2 pseudohypoaldosteronism or familial
hyperkalaemic hypertension): the clinical inverse of Gitelman’s
syndrome (b p. 800). Presents as i BP, d renin and aldosterone,
i K+, and acidosis and normal renal function. Mutations in genes
encoding WNK-1 and –4 (negative regulators of NCCT, b p. 930) are
responsible and lead to reduced functioning thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl
co-transporter in the distal tubule.

798

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Hypokalaemia
One of the most common electrolyte abnormalities seen, esp. in patients
on diuretics. Although K+ of 3–3.5mmol/L is generally well tolerated,
hypokalaemia of <2.5mmol/L can be life-threatening (esp. in the presence
of digitalis or if the drop is rapid).

Causes
• Inadequate intake <25mmol/day (either dietary or IV).
• Increased gut losses:
• Vomiting or NG losses (i Na+ loss in vomitus ls
hyperaldosteronism and i NaHCO3 delivered to the distal
nephron).
• Diarrhoea or laxative abuse.
• VIPoma, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome.
• Ileostomy or enteric ﬁstula, colonic villous adenoma.
• Redistribution into cells:
• B-agonism (any cause of i sympathetic drive, e.g. delirium tremens).
• B-agonist drugs (bronchodilators, decongestants, tocolytics).
• Insulin, theophylline, or caffeine (activate Na+/K+-ATPase pump).
 Refeeding in malnourished (and total body K+ deplete) patients.
• Alkalosis.
• Vigorous exercise
• p hyperaldosteronism: adrenal adenoma (Conn’s syndrome), bilateral
adrenal hyperplasia—plasma aldosterone:renin ratio.
• Renin-secreting tumours (i BP in the young).
• Cushing’s disease.
• s hyperaldosteronism (b p. 478):
• Liver failure, heart failure, nephrotic syndrome.
• Renal losses:
• Diuretics (esp. thiazides, loops), including abuse of diuretics.
• Acquired renal tubular disease (b p. 76) or RTA (b p. 824).
• Bartter’s, Liddle’s, and Gitelman’s syndromes (b p. 800).
• Other drugs:
• Amphotericin and aminoglycosides (tubular toxicity).
• Glucocorticoids (esp. at high dose) or mineralocorticids.
• Carbenoxolone and liquorice (have a mineralocorticoid effect).
• Hypomagnesaemia.
• Familial hypokalaemic periodic paralysis.
• Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.
• Correction of vitamin B12 deﬁciency.

Symptoms and signs
See previous list of causes for speciﬁc associations—usually picked up
on U&E.
2 Take a full drug history, particularly for diuretics. Exclude diarrhoea.
• Fatigue, constipation, proximal muscle weakness, and d tone
(progressing to ascending paralysis as K+d).
• Cardiac arrhythmias, esp. if underlying heart disease. Chronically, i BP,
glucose intolerance, and d urinary concentrating ability.

HYPOKALAEMIA

Investigations
• U&E, Mg2+. Venous pH, and calculate the anion gap. Either perform
24-hour urinary K+ or do spot u-K+ and u-Cr. Calculate the urinary K/
Cr ratio (KCR).
• Also, CK (may have spontaneous rhabdomyolysis). Digoxin level if
on drug.
• If 24-hour u-K+ <15mmol/L, losses are EXTRARENAL.
• Or, depending on the KCR, focus attention as shown in Table 10.2.

Treatment
 Is the patient on digoxin? Will potentiate digoxin’s arrhythmogenicity. Note that diuretic-induced hypokalaemia is exacerbated if dietary Na+
intake is high. Always aim to treat the underlying cause over time.
Mild (>2.5mmol/L):
• Oral slow-release potassium chloride 50–150mmol/day in divided
doses (treatment limited by GI intolerability).
• Check K+ regularly.
• Rule of thumb is to treat until alkalosis resolves.
• i dietary K+ and ? switch to/add in K+-sparing diuretic.
• Common options include Sando-K® (12mmol/tab), or Slow-K®
(8mmol/tab). If acidotic, rather use KHCO3.
 Severe or symptomatic hypokalaemia (K <2.5mmol/L, arrhythmias,
liver failure, or extreme weakness):
• Cardiac monitor.
• Check Mg2+, and correct if need be (b p. 808).
• Avoid glucose-containing solutions or sodium bicarbonate.
• IVI 0.9% saline 1L with 20–40mmol KCl at no more than 10–20mmol
KCl/h through peripheral cannula. If d K+ with hyperchloraemic
acidosis (RTA, b p. 824, or gut losses), avoid 0.9% saline, and rather
use KCl as listed here.
• 2 Danger of rapid onset hyperkalaemia. Recheck K+.
• In volume-restricted patients or those with profound and
ongoing hypokalaemia, KCl can be given into a central vein as
20–40mmol/100mL 0.9% saline (NOT glucose, risk of hypokalaemia) at
not >40mmol/h using a volumetric pump. Must be in high dependency
surroundings.

Bartter’s, Gitelman’s and Liddle’s
syndromes
Bartter’s syndrome
Autosomal recessive tubular hypomagnesaemia and a hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with hypocalciuria. Type 5 Bartter’s is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
At least six subtypes now detected, all sharing impaired Na+ reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Mutations in a number of channels on both the apical and basolateral membranes (including
NKCC2, CLC-Ka and CLC-Kb, CaR, and ROMK) are responsible for
salt wasting and mild volume depletion. It is, in effect, what is seen with
loop diuretic use. Subsequent s hyperaldosteronism (and juxtaglomerular apparatus hyperplasia) leads to a hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis.
i luminal Na+ impairs Ca2+ absorption, leading to normal to i u-Ca2+.
Diagnosis
In children (or adolescents) with failure to thrive, polydipsia, polyuria, and
cramps. Sensorineural deafness in type 4 Bartter’s. Lower BP than general population, d K+, mild metabolic alkalosis, i u-Na+, i u-K+, i u-Ca2+,
i u-prostaglandin E2 (reduced NaCl entry into macula densa, leading to
increased COX-2 expression), i renin, i aldosterone.
Treatment
Aim to normalize K+. Start with amiloride 5–40mg day (large doses may be
needed!). Add on oral potassium supplementation as potassium chloride
25–100mmol/day (for drugs, see b p. 799).
 Recheck K+ after 5–7 days to ensure that the dosing is appropriate.
NSAIDs (indometacin) if i u-PGE2. ACE-I may help normalize K+. Often
difﬁcult to treat and demanding of patient (child!) compliance.

Gitelman’s syndrome
Autosomal recessive inheritance, characterized by hypomagnesaemia,
hypokalaemia with hypocalciuria, and metabolic alkalosis.
Heterogeneous loss-of-function mutations largely affecting the SLC12A3
gene encoding the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter in the DCT,
with impaired Na+ reabsorption. i Na+ loss leads to s hyperaldosteronism and a hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. It is, in effect, what is
seen with thiazide diuretic use. Increased urinary Mg2+ loss, with signiﬁcant hypomagnesaemia, is thought to occur as a result of a reduction in
TRPM6 (an epithelial magnesium channel) density in the DCT.

BARTTER’S, GITELMAN’S AND LIDDLE’S SYNDROMES

Diagnosis
In young adults, with often asymptomatic d K+ (2.0–3.0mmol/L).
May be weakness and myalgia, and symptoms of d urinary concentrating
ability (nocturia, in particular, polyuria, and polydipsia).
Investigations
Include d Mg2+. Mild metabolic alkalosis. i renin, i aldosterone. Urinary
u-PGE2 is not raised (unlike Bartter’s). Genetic testing is available though
not widely so.
Treatment
Generally good prognosis. Amiloride 5–40mg od 9 K+ supplementation
(b p. 799). No role for NSAIDs.

Liddle’s syndrome
Autosomal dominant inheritance. Caused by gain-of-function mutations
in ENaC (epithelial sodium channel expressed on the apical surface of
collecting duct cells), resulting in a failure to endocytose ENaC from the
surface membrane of collecting duct cells. Constitutive overexpression
leads to i Na+ reabsorption which leads to d BP 9 oedema. Enhanced
Na+ uptake renders the lumen more electronegative, opening the transepithelial ROMK K+ channel, leading to K+ wasting and a hypokalaemic
metabolic alkalosis. Aldosterone is appropriately suppressed.
Diagnosis
In young hypertensives (often with severe i BP and a +ve family history),
with d K+ (may be mild) and mild metabolic alkalosis. d renin, d aldosterone (see Table 10.3).
Treatment
Low-salt diet (<100mmol/day) 9 amiloride 5–10mg od (or triamterene—
directly inhibits ENaC).

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Calcium, magnesium, and
phosphorus
Calcium
99% of total body Ca2+ (71kg) is stored in bone. Extracellular Ca2+ accounts
for a small fraction: of this; 740% is bound to albumin, with 50% available
as physiologically active, free (or ionized) Ca2+. The remainder is complexed with anions, such as bicarbonate or phosphate. Free intracellular
Ca2+ is found at 104 higher a concentration than in the extracellular space,
a gradient maintained by an energy-dependent membrane Ca2+ ATPase.
Intracellular Ca2+ is key to many signalling pathways within cells—Ca2+
is also important in skeletal health, membrane function, neuromuscular
integrity, and coagulation.
The serum normal range is 2.1–2.5mmol/L (71.2mmol/L ionized), with
Ca2+ available from both the gut and bone stores. Gut Ca2+ absorption
occurs via transcellular (uptake via TRPV6, the apical Ca2+ channel with
subsequent energy-dependent basolateral efﬂux) and paracellular pathways. Uptake is under the control of (active) 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3.
The ionized fraction is freely ﬁltered across the glomerulus and mainly
reabsorbed in the PCT and loop of Henle. Most Ca2+ is resorbed paracellularly along a concentration gradient, but TRPV5 regulates (the ﬁnal 10%
of total) distal calcium uptake in a PTH- and vitamin D-dependent manner.
Urinary Na+ is able to strongly inﬂuence urinary Ca2+ excretion: in the
thick ascending loop of Henle, i Na+ delivery forces i Na+ uptake, at the
expense of Ca2+ resorption l hypercalciuria. This is a key factor in stone
formation (b p. 716).
Falling Ca2+ activates parathyroid calcium-sensing receptors (CaRs),
leading to parathyroid hormone (PTH) release. PTH increases renal tubular Ca2+ reabsorption and hydroxylation of vitamin D3 to the active metabolite, increasing intestinal uptake. PTH also enhances bone osteoclastic
activity. There is also evidence that PTH receptors are present on cells
not directly involved in calcium homeostasis (such as endothelial cells and
cardiomyocytes), suggesting that PTH may have effects beyond its role in
calcium/phosphate regulation.

Magnesium
Magnesium (Mg2+) is the fourth most common cation in the body and is
found largely in the intracellular compartment or stored in bone. Only 1%
of the 25g total body Mg2+ is in the ECF, with the majority found in bone or
muscle. It is a key component of ATP-requiring reactions and is necessary
for the synthesis of protein and maintaining membrane function, nerve
conduction, and muscle contraction.
Mg2+, like Ca2+, also regulates PTH secretion—d Mg2+ leads to PTH
release and vice versa. Profound d Mg2+l symptomatic d Ca2+.
The normal range is 0.75–0.95mmol/L in plasma. The kidney dominates
the control of Mg2+ homeostasis. Mg2+ is absorbed from the gut and freely
ﬁltered across the glomerulus. In health, 70% is then reabsorbed in the
thick ascending loop of Henle (TALH)—the strongly negative paracellular

CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, AND PHOSPHORUS

protein paracellin-1 allows efﬁcient absorption of the cations Mg2+ and
Ca2+ under control of both PTH and the calcium-sensing receptor. Fine
control is achieved in the DCT where the transmembrane (transcellular) protein TRPM6 allows further uptake. Loss of function of either
paracellin-1 or TRPM6 leads to urinary Mg2+ wasting and d Mg2+.

Phosphorus
Phosphorus occurs largely as the inorganic fraction phosphate in the circulation. Organic phosphorus exists as protein-bound phospholipids and
is not measured in clinical practice. Phosphate is essential to almost all
biochemical systems.
Absorbed by the type II sodium/phosphate co-transporter (NaPi) from
the intestine, again in a vitamin D3-dependent manner, 80% is found in
bone. The normal range for plasma phosphate is 0.8–1.4mmol/L (higher in
children). Freely ﬁltered in the kidney, it is largely reabsorbed in the PCT
(depending on oral intake) by the type II NaPi.
Tubular reabsorption of phosphate is controlled by PTH (which inhibits
reabsorption) and also by ﬁbroblast growth factor 23 (produced by osteocytes which leads to lower levels of serum phosphate by reducing tubular
reabsorption and by inhibition of 1A-hydroxylation of vitamin D).

Hypocalcaemia
Total serum Ca2+ is low with d albumin, though the free fraction may be
normal. Always correct for albumin:
Corrected Ca2+ = measured Ca2+ + [40 – serum Alb] × 0.02

Causes of hypocalcaemia
• Vitamin D deﬁciency:
• Malnutrition (osteomalacia).
• Malabsorption (gastrectomy, short bowel, coeliac disease, chronic
pancreatitis).
• CKD (loss of 1A-hydroxylase).
• Vitamin D-dependent rickets (anticonvulsants, nephrotic or Fanconi
syndrome).
• Hypoparathyroidism:
• Post-parathyroidectomy—’ hungry bone syndrome’ (b p. 254).
 Inadvertent after thyroidectomy!
• Inherited, pseudohypoparathyroidism.
• Hyperphosphataemia (i phosphate increases bone Ca2+ deposition):
• Tumour lysis (b p. 160).
• Rhabdomyolysis (b p. 152).
• Administered or ingested.
• Acute pancreatitis.
• d Mg2+.
• Acute alkalosis (reduction in ionized calcium).

Symptoms and signs
Depression and anxiety, (perioral) paraesthesiae, carpopedal spasm, tetany, respiratory depression, convulsions, hypotension, and arrhythmias.
Examine for Chvostek’s sign (tap over the parotid for facial muscle twitching, as CN VII excited) and Trousseau’s sign (occlude brachial artery with
BP cuff inﬂated > SBP; observe wrist and ﬁnger ﬂexion). If chronic, cataracts, dry skin, dental changes, bone pain, and muscle weakness 9 skeletal
deformities.

Investigations
2 ECG: prolonged QT interval. U&E, Ca2+, phosphate, Mg2+, alkaline
phosphatase, and intact PTH. If appropriate, amylase, CK, urate. Consider
25-(OH) vitamin D3 and 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3. Consider X-ray long
bones and hands.

Treatment
2 Only treat if symptomatic 9 acute.
If mild (>1.9): increase dietary Ca2+. Add in oral Ca2+ (e.g. calcium carbonate) 0.5–1.5g tds 2 hours after meals. If vitamin D-deﬁcient, oral ergocalciferol (inactive vitamin D) or colecalciferol 10 micrograms–1mg od,
usually in a preparation with Ca2+. If d, Mg2+ supplement, as described on
b p. 808.

HYPOCALCAEMIA

 If acute or symptomatic, infuse Ca2+ at 2mg/kg/h: start IVI 10% calcium
gluconate 60mL in 500mL 5% glucose or 0.9% saline at 125mL/h. Recheck
Ca2+ at +4 hours, and adjust infusion rate accordingly.
 If tetany, give 10mL 10% calcium gluconate 10mL (2.2mmol) IVI over 3
minutes ( extravasation). Repeat, if necessary, or infusion as described.

Hypercalcaemia
Usually the result of increased absorption from gut, bone resorption, or
both. Due to increased PTH or analogues, or osteolytic metastases. Mild
i Ca2+ (2.6–2.9mmol/L) is usually asymptomatic, but rapidly evolving i
Ca2+ >3.5 may be fatal.

Symptoms and signs
‘Bones, stones, groans, and psychic moans’. Nausea, abdominal pain,
anorexia, constipation, depression, confusion, polydipsia, and polyuria.
Dehydration (? postural drop), renal calculi, nephrocalcinosis. Signs from
associated malignancy. Take a full medication history (milk-alkali syndrome) (see Table 10.4).

Causes
• p hyperparathyroidism (10–20%)—less commonly tertiary with CKD.
• Malignancy:
• Local osteolytic bone lesions.
• Humoral hypercalcaemia (tumour-derived PTH-related protein
PTHrP has similar actions to PTH).

• Drugs (vitamin D, vitamin A, lithium, thiazide diuretics).
• Immobilization (repetitive mechanical skeletal stress prevents bone
and mineral loss).
• Thyrotoxicosis, (phaeochromocytoma), milk-alkali syndrome (antacids,
calcium carbonate therapy).
• Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia: due to dysfunction of the
calcium-sensing receptor.

Investigations
• U&E, Ca2+, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, albumin.
• PTH 9 PTHrP, 25-(OH) and 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3. If indicated, serum
ACE, protein electrophoresis, urinary Bence–Jones proteinuria, serum
free light chains, PSA. CXR. Plain KUB. Consider CT.
• 2 ECG: short QT interval.

Treatment
• Treat the underlying cause:
• Stop drugs which cause i Ca2+.
• p hyperparathyroidism: either cinacalcet or surgery if end-organ
damage or uncontrolled hypercalcaemia.
• Malignancy: surgical resection, radiotherapy, bisphosphonates.
Corticosteroids (prednisolone 30mg od) is effective when i Ca2+ is driven
by increased extrarenal (macrophage or tumour) 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3
synthesis.

HYPERCALCAEMIA

Treat the calcium if symptomatic
• Mild hypercalaemia (<3.0): increase ﬂuid intake 9 salt intake
(promotes u-Ca2+ loss). Aim to treat underlying cause.
•  Severe i Ca2+ (>3.0):
• Vigorous rehydration with 0.9% saline, initially at 250–500mL/h,
aiming for +2L positive balance (and giving 3–5L/day). 2 Assess
ﬂuid balance regularly.
• Furosemide (increases renal i Ca2+ wasting) 10–20mg 4-hourly,
or as IVI infusion (5–40mg hourly). Do not dehydrate.
If urgent control required (and volume-resuscitated), calcitonin 4–8IU/
kg SC/IM (inhibits osteoclast activity, promotes urinary calcium excretion). Repeat 12-hourly. Must add on bisphosphonate therapy, as tachyphylaxis develops.
• Bisphosphonates are powerful and prolonged inhibitors of
osteoclasts. Options include zoledronic acid (4–8mg in 100mL
in 0.9% saline over 30min, duration of effect 30 days) or
pamidronate (60–90mg in 500mL 0.9% saline over 4h. Effect
77 days). Monitor SCr.
• Treat d K+ or d Mg2+ with IVI supplements.
If signiﬁcant hyperparathyroidism associated with hypercalcaemia, cinacalcet 30mg od, dose rapidly titrated upwards, if tolerated.
2 Hypercalcaemia in ESRD may need treatment by haemodialysis. Will
rapidly lower Ca2+ and should be considered if Ca2+ >3.5 or depressed
level of consciousness.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Hypomagnesaemia
Occurs in up to 12% of hospitalized patients. Often exacerbated by undernutrition, chronic diarrhoea, diuretics, nephrotoxins. Those with diabetes
are particularly prone to d Mg2+. Causes include:
• Renal:
• Diuretic use (loop or thiazide) or prolonged natriuresis.
• Recovery phase of obstruction or ATN.
• Nephrotoxins (aminoglycosides, cisplatin, ciclosporin, amphotericin,
foscarnet, pentamidine).
• Hypercalciuria or phosphate depletion.
• Gitelman’s or Bartter’s syndromes (b p. 800) or familial
hypomagnesaemia-hypercalciuria.
• Gut:
• Gut losses due to diarrhoeal disease, prolonged NG suction,
intestinal surgery, or malabsorption.
• Pancreatitis (saponiﬁcation in necrotic fat).
• Alcohol abuse.

Symptoms and signs
d Mg2+ occurs in conjunction with d K+ (50% of cases), d Ca2+, and a
metabolic alkalosis. Weakness, cramps, carpopedal spasm, positive
Chvostek’s and Trousseau’s signs (b p. 804), tetany, and convulsions may
occur. Delirium, movement disorders, vertigo, and nystagmus also occur.
Signiﬁcant d Mg2+ may induce supra- or ventricular arrhythmias.

Investigations
d Mg2+, d K+ (<3.0mmol/L). Hypokalaemia is often resistant to K+ supplementation until Mg2+ is normalized. d Ca2+ (if Mg2+ <0.5mmol/L), with
inappropriately low/normal PTH.
 ECG changes: i QRS width, i PR interval, ﬂattened T waves. Fatal
ventricular arrhythmias in the context of underlying heart disease (esp.
acute coronary syndromes and CCF).
24h urinary Mg2+ (NR <10–30mg/day) or fractional excretion of Mg2+
will distinguish renal losses from other causes of d Mg2+ but is not usually
required for diagnosis.

Treatment
• Asymptomatic with modest d Mg2+ (>0.4mmol/L): oral slow-release
Mg2+ 6–18mmol/day in four divided doses. Preparations include Mg
glycerophosphate or Mg oxide.
• Symptomatic, or with hypocalcaemia or hypokalaemia: 10mmol MgSO4
IVI bolus over 5min, then 20mmol MgSO4 in 100mL 0.9% saline IVI
over 4 hours. Repeat, as required. 2 Can be given as a painful IMI.
Oral supplementation once Mg2+ >0.5mmol/L with 18–24mmol Mg2+/
day in four divided doses. Diarrhoea may limit use of oral Mg2+.
3 With arrhythmias (e.g. torsade de pointes): IVI MgSO4 4–8mmol stat,
then 20mmol/12-hourly against plasma Mg2+. Aim for >0.4mmol/L.

HYPOMAGNESAEMIA

50% of administered Mg2+ will be lost in the urine, so prolonged therapy
may be needed. The total body deﬁcit in symptomatic d Mg2+ may be 0.5–
1mmol/kg body weight, so up to 150mmol may be required over 5 days
(with urine losses). In diuretic-induced chronic Mg2+ wasting states, add-on
amiloride 5mg od may limit Mg2+ losses.

809

810

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Hypermagnesaemia
Urine losses of Mg2+ can compensate for rising plasma Mg2+, so i Mg2+
is unusual. Occurs usually if excess Mg2+ administered IVI (as in treating
pre-eclampsia) or in patients with impaired renal function given exogenous Mg2+. Mg2+-containing preparations include: antacids (Mg2+ hydroxide
or carbonate), MgSO4 enemas.

Clinically
i Mg2+ depresses the CNS and reduces neuromuscular function through
increasing resistance to acetylcholine-induced depolarization at the neuromuscular junction. Paraesthesiae and hyporeﬂexia (Mg2+ >2.0mmol/L)
progress to weakness, swallowing difﬁculty, and respiratory depression
(Mg2+ >3.5mmol/L).
Bradycardia and d BP with severe toxicity (>3.5mmol/L). ECG: i PR
and QT interval.
May also see mild hypocalcaemia due to Mg2+-induced inhibition of PTH
secretion.

Treatment
If clinically stable, with a good UO and normal renal function, stop
Mg2+-containing preparation, and monitor. Excess Mg2+ will be rapidly
renally excreted.
2 If respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias or Mg2+ >5 mmol/L,
give IVI calcium gluconate 10% 10mL as slow IVI bolus. May require
repeated doses.
Consider forced Mg2+ diuresis with IV furosemide 40–80mg, replacing
UO on a mL/mL basis with 0.45% NaCl.
In patients with impaired renal function, haemodialysis provides rapid
and effective normalization of Mg2+. Expect normalization of Mg2+ within
4 hours.

HYPERPHOSPHATAEMIA

Hyperphosphataemia
Almost always occurs in patients with renal impairment. Calcium and phosphate are at the limits of solubility in plasma, so i calcium x phosphate
product leads to precipitation and ectopic calciﬁcation. Over time, this
leads to vascular calciﬁcation (and is associated with i mortality in CKD).
s hyperparathyroidism will attempt to i renal losses as compensation.
Usually asymptomatic, causes include:
• CKD.
• Tumour lysis (b p. 160) and rhabdomyolysis (b p. 152).
• Hypoparathyroidism.
• Phosphate-containing enemas (usually with renal impairment).
• Vitamin D toxicity.
No treatment is usually required in the acute setting though, if with d Ca2+
(tumour lysis, rhabdomyolysis), can be life-threatening.
2 If so, give 10IU soluble insulin in 100mL 50% glucose over 30 minutes.
This works by redistributing PO4– into cells. Promote diuresis through
volume resuscitation (0.9% NaCl).
If chronic, aim to restrict dietary phosphate; use oral phosphate binders
to limit uptake and in those with ESRD and dialysis.
For a fuller discussion, see b p. 246.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Hypophosphataemia
Important hypophosphataemia occurs in 9 1% of hospitalized patients,
particularly chronic abusers of alcohol, diabetics, and those on TPN.
2 Becomes clinically meaningful <0.4mmol/L.
Causes include:
• Redistribution:
• Refeeding in malnourished (alcoholic) patients.*
• Respiratory alkalosis (i pH intracellularly stimulates glycolysis).*
• Exogenous insulin administration (DKA, critical care).*
• Hungry bone syndrome (massive Ca2+ and PO4– deposition).
• i renal losses:
• Hyperparathyroidism.
• Impaired vitamin D metabolism.
• Renal tubular disorders (Fanconi syndrome), ATN, or resolving
obstructive uropathy.
• Gut uptake:
• Malnutrition or vitamin D deﬁciency.
• Chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption.
• Antacid abuse.
• Inappropriate use of phosphate binders (calcium carbonate,
sevalamer, or lanthanum).
Note: reduced phosphate intake alone rarely causes hypophosphataemia
due to compensatory increased renal phosphate reabsorption.

Symptoms and signs
Largely due to falling intracellular ATP levels and red cell 2,3-DPG (with
impaired O2 release from haemoglobin). Proximal muscle weakness l
spontaneous rhabdomyolysis (9 diaphragmatic weakness and underventilation), ileus, myocardial depression (even heart failure), haemolysis, thrombocytopenia. altered mental state and ﬁts, if prolonged, osteomalacia.

Investigations
Urine pH, U&E, bicarbonate, Ca2+, phosphate. If indicated, PTH, FGF-23,
25-(OH) vitamin D3, calcitriol. Urine phosphate determines if low phosphate is due to renal losses or due to redistribution/reduced gut uptake.
24h urine phosphate <16mmol/day = non-renal cause.

Treatment
If phosphate >0.4mmol/L, i dietary phosphate (milk and dairy products).
Oral phosphate (e.g. Phosphate-Sandoz®) 1g tds (3g = 7100mmol).
2 If <0.4mmol/L or, if critically unwell, IVI phosphate (eg Addiphos®)
0.15mmol/kg in 500mL 5% dextrose or feed over 12 hours. Calcitriol PO
or IVI may reduce urinary phosphate losses. Check Ca2+ repeatedly (as
phosphate may precipitate sudden hypocalcaemia and tetany).

* Glycolysis = intracellular shift of phosphorylated glucose metabolites.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Acid–base
Understanding normal physiology
The concentration of hydrogen ions ([H+]) is tightly controlled within and
without cells, in various tissues and ﬂuid compartments of the body. A key
function of the kidneys is to regulate the blood [H*] and consequently
total body [H*]. pH is the negative logarithmic expression of the concentration of hydrogen ions in any ﬂuid. In the ECF, pH is maintained within a
normal range of 7.38–7.42 where [H+] at pH 7.40 is 40nmol/L—at pH 7.0
(the intracellular pH), [H+] = 100nmol/L. Remember the pH of water is
6.8—note the role of buffers in biological ﬂuids.

Intake and generation
Acid loads can be categorized as volatile (CO2) and non-volatile.
Non-volatile acid loads can be subdivided into metabolizable (via intermediary metabolism, e.g. lactic acid) and non-metabolizable (e.g. HCl).
Non-metabolizable acid amounts to 1mmol/kg acid/day in adults, largely
derived from the breakdown of ingested protein (sulphur-containing
amino acids l H2SO4) and by-products of cellular metabolism.
Metabolizable acids are eventually metabolized to CO2 and H2O, so
eliminating the acid. The addition of salts of metabolizable acids (e.g.
sodium lactate) to the body are equivalent to the addition of bicarbonate,
as a proton will be used to metabolize lactate to CO2 and H2O (resulting
in a net generation of bicarbonate). It is this principle that allows for the
use of acetate and lactate as buffers in various forms of renal replacement
therapy.

Buffering
To prevent rapid changes in pH with i dietary intake or excess production
of [H+], e.g. during exercise, a system of local (tissue) and systemic buffers
has evolved. These buffers include:
• Bicarbonate (HCO3–).
• Bone salts (calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate).
• Blood proteins (albumin, haemoglobin, and other globulins).
In the short term, bicarbonate is, by far, the most important, though bone
buffers play a more signiﬁcant role in chronic acidosis.

ACID–BASE

Acid maths
H+ + HCO3– ↔ H2CO3 ↔ CO2 + H2O
Adding H+ (acidosis) consumes bicarbonate and generates CO2, as the
reaction is driven rightwards. Removing CO2 (hyperventilation) returns
the pH toward normal, according to the Henderson–Hasselbach
equation:
pH = pK log [HCO3– ]
where pK = 6.1, the dissociation coefﬁcient of carbonic acid (H2CO3).
This does not generate more bicarbonate, so the kidney has to i H+
excretion to balance the system.

Models of acid–base balance
There are two principal models to explain the physiological acid–base
balance.
• The traditional ‘base excess’ model (see Fig. 10.1).
• Stewart’s theory—see M http://www.acidbase.org.
Base excess (traditional method)
Building on the work of Singer and Hastings, Siggaard–Andersen introduced the concept of ‘base excess’ (BE) in 1960. Deﬁned as the number
of mmol of acid or base that are needed to titrate 1L of blood to pH
7.40 at 37*C in the presence of a pCO2 of 5.33kPa (40mmHg). The base
excess allows differentiation between metabolic and respiratory acidosis/
alkalosis. The term ‘base deﬁcit’ is synonymous with negative values of
base excess (i.e. metabolic acidosis).
Values for HCO3 and BE are derived from the directly measured variables of pH, pCO2, and Hb.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Excretion: the kidney in acid–base
Preventing bicarbonate loss
80–90% of ﬁltered HCO3– is actively reabsorbed in the proximal tubule:
• Proximal tubular cell Na+ is pumped basolaterally into the interstitium,
creating an inward gradient l Na+ movement from the lumen.
• NHE-3, the Na+/H+ antiporter, allows Na+ entry from the lumen,
exchanged for H+.
• In the lumen, H+ + HCO3– = H2CO3 (carbonic acid).
• Luminal carbonic anhydrase then l CO2 and H2O, taken up into cells.
• Intracellular carbonic anhydrase then l H+ + HCO3–.
• Intracellular HCO3– is then transported into the peritubular capillaries.
• The remaining H+ is available for recycling.

Excreting proton
• Almost all H+ in the proximal tubule is reabsorbed with HCO3–.
• Acid excretion occurs in the collecting duct.
• Na+ absorbed under the inﬂuence of aldosterone (in the principal
cells, b p. 931) means the tubular lumen becomes increasingly
electronegative.
• K+ is secreted from principal cells, and H+ is secreted from
A-intercalated cells into the lumen (aldosterone acts directly on this
cell’s H+-ATPase to effect this) to maintain electrical neutrality.

Buffering urinary proton
The luminal pH rapidly falls to <4.0, inhibiting A-intercalated cell
H+-ATPase. For ongoing net acid excretion, urinary H+ is buffered (to
keep u-pH >4.0) by:
• Titratable acids (H+ incorporated into phosphoric acid H3PO4 or
sulphuric acid H2SO4).
• Ammonium (NH4+).
In health, titratable acids and ammonium carry 9 50% of the dietary H+
load, but, with metabolic acidosis, more ammonium is needed for acid
excretion.

EXCRETION: THE KIDNEY IN ACID–BASE

Ammonium
Proximal tubular cells deaminate glutamine to form bicarbonate and
ammonia (NH3), then released and acidiﬁed in the lumen as NH4+.
• NH4+ is absorbed into the medullary interstitium from the ascending
limb of the loop of Henle where it dissociates to form NH3 and H+
once more.
• NH3 can now move down a concentration gradient into the lumen
of the collecting duct, available to buffer H+, and is then excreted as
NH4Cl in the urine.
• Ammonia synthesis is enhanced by acidosis and d K+.
The urine anion gap (UAG) = u-[Na+ + K+] – u-[Cl–].
This difference is urinary NH4+. If the kidney responds normally to acidosis (non-renal acidosis), it will i NH4+ excretion to waste H+ into the
urine. The UAG will then be negative (as i Cl– will accompany i NH4+).
If the renal response is inappropriate (e.g. RTA, b p. 824), the UAG
will be 0 or positive.

819

820

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Metabolic acidosis
Acidosis occurs if the systemic pH falls <7.35 and is considered metabolic
in origin if d [HCO3–]. This occurs through:
• i bicarbonate losses (gut or kidney).
• i acid retention.
• Excessive acid production or administration (HCl).
• Administration of Cl–-rich solutions during resuscitation.
With pure metabolic acidosis, compensation occurs through increasing
ventilation and blowing off CO2 (d pCO2).

Why do chloride-rich solutions lead to acidosis?
Solutions, such as 0.9% NaCl, normal saline, are bicarbonate-free. Falling
bicarbonate is replaced by chloride (Cl–) without a proportional d
in pCO2.
This is a so-called ‘dilution acidosis’.
In determining the cause of a metabolic acidosis, it is helpful to estimate
the anion gap—this may be calculated for both the plasma and urine
(UAG, b see below). In health, the difference between cations and anions is made up of organic (negatively charged) acids. An i AG occurs if
acids, other than carbonic acid (l phosphate, lactate, or sulphate), accumulate or i exogenous acids are added to plasma.

Calculating the anion gap
AG = [Na+ + K+] – [Cl– + HCO3–] = 8–16 in health.
Albumin is negatively charged: d Alb l underestimates the AG.
To correct for hypoalbuminaemia, add 0.25 x (44 – s-Alb) to the AG.
In the USA, the contribution of [K+] to the anion gap is frequently
ignored.
• UAG = u[Na+ + K+] – u[Cl–].
• As uCl– usually exceeds uNa+ and uK+, this should return a
negative value.
• UAG is an estimate of renal ammonia production (b p. 819).
•
•
•
•

Clinical features of an acidosis
Systemic effects of severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.1):
• Air hunger (Kussmaul’s breathing, an increase in tidal volume, with
deep, sighing respiration) and hyperventilation (to blow off CO2).
• d myocardial contractility (d Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic
reticulum), arteriodilatation, and venoconstriction (central blood
pooling).
• Shifts oxygen dissociation curve rightwards (more O2 release).
• Reduced binding of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) to receptors.
• Resistant arrhythmias (esp. VF).
The associated underlying cause may be apparent.

METABOLIC ACIDOSIS

Investigations
•
•
•
•
•

U&E, venous pH (in a blood gas syringe), or ABG.
Urine pH. In health, the urine pH <5.3 in the face of acid loading.
Lactate, ketones, blood glucose.
Urinary dipstix, electrolytes (UAG), and ketones.
Microscopy for crystals. Toxicology screen, including salicylates.

Normal AG acidosis
Due to retained H+ or HCO3– loss. Both Cl– and H+ are increased, so a
normal AG acidosis is also referred to as ‘hyperchloraemic’.
Cl– displays a reciprocal relationship with HCO3–, increasing when bicarbonate is lost to maintain electrical neutrality.
The UAG is useful in evaluating a normal AG acidosis:
• Non-renal losses of bicarbonate (2 negative UAG):
• Diarrhoea or high-output ileostomy.
• Ureterosigmoidostomy (gut absorption of urinary NH4+ and Cl–).
• Renal bicarbonate losses (UAG >0):
• Impaired reabsorption (acetazolamide).
• Proximal RTA (b p. 824) or Fanconi-like syndromes (b p. 825).
• Hypoaldosteronism or mineralocorticoid receptor blockade.
• Failure of renal acid excretion (UAG >0):
• RTA (distal or type 4, b p. 825).
• Increased acid production/load:
• Toluene poisoning, lysine or arginine administered in TPN
(metabolized to HCl), or NH4Cl administration.

Increased AG acidosis
(‘Hypo-’ or ‘normochloraemic’ acidosis).
Causes remembered, using the mnemonic KUSMAL:
• K—ketoacidosis (acetoacetate or B-hydroxybutyrate).
• U—uraemia/CKD; acidosis uncommon until eGFR <20–25mL/min.
• S—salicylates (aspirin).
• M—methanol (and other alcohols, e.g. ethylene glycol).
• A—aldehydes.
• L—lactic acidosis.
Causes of a ketoacidosis include diabetes, starvation, and alcohol—all
induced by insulin deﬁciency and relative glucagon excess li fatty acid
mobilization and subsequent oxidation to keto-acids.

Treating severe acidosis with IVI NaHCO3 is
controversial
• Corrects extracellular pH.
• May worsen intracellular acidosis (normal intracellular pH is 7.1), as
generated CO2 crosses the cell membrane faster than HCO3– so i
intracellular acidosis.
• Generates CO2 that must be blown off ( ﬁxed or d
respiratory rate).

821

822

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

• Ionized calcium can fall abruptly.
• Na+ load is substantial (150mmol in 500mL 1.26% NaHCO3 and 1mmol
Na+/mL of 8.4% NaHCO3) and poorly tolerated in volume-overloaded
patients.
• Studies of bicarbonate supplementation in severe acidosis have
consistently failed to demonstrate a beneﬁt—and some have suggested
an association with mortality (as BP and cardiac output fall with
correction).
Reduced CO2-generating buffers (such as Carbicarb®) are promising but
have not been adequately assessed clinically.

Managing severe and life-threatening acidosis
Consider NaHCO3 if pH <7.0 in patients with impaired cardiac performance. If correcting, aim to correct to pH >7.2 or a minimum [HCO3–]
>10, at which pH life-threatening complications of acidosis would be
unusual.
• HCO3– deﬁcit = (target – measured [HCO3–]) x bicarbonate space.
• Bicarbonate space = (0.4 + 2.6/[HCO3–]) x weight (kg).
For example, in a 70 kg ♂ with pH 6.9 and [HCO3–] = 4mmol/L with cardiac instability: deﬁcit = (10 – 4) x ([0.4 + 2.6/4] x 70) = 420mmol HCO3–.
 Note that the target bicarbonate is 10mmol/L and NOT normal
(24mmol/L).
Aim to give as 1.26% NaHCO3 (1,000mL = 150mmol HCO3–) IVI over
4–6 hours. 50mL 8.4% NaHCO3 contains 50mmol HCO3–.
2 IVI bicarbonate is almost never needed in diabetic ketoacidosis—it
delays the removal of blood ketone bodies.

Respiratory acidosis
Occurs if pH <7.35 and i pCO2—may be metabolic compensation if
chronic (i [HCO3–]). Causes include advanced pulmonary disease, respiratory muscle fatigue, impaired central ventilatory control (drugs or stroke),
or as a result of mechanical ventilation.
Treatment (if warranted) usually involves mechanical ventilation.

METABOLIC ACIDOSIS

Oral bicarbonate supplementation in
progressive CKD
Emerging evidence supports the use of oral bicarbonate salts in slowing
the progression of renal failure and improving the nutritional status of
patients with CKD stages 4–5.
The optimal bicarbonate level in CKD has yet to be deﬁned. However,
a level between 23 and 29mmol/L is associated with a reduced rate of
deterioration in renal function, and observational studies suggest it may
be associated with reduced mortality.
Aim to treat with oral NaHCO3 1.5–4.5g/day in 2–3 divided doses.
Alternatives include Na citrate or a diet in fruit and vegetables (rich in
alkali). Advantages in not using NaHCO3 include lowering the salt load.
Other beneﬁts in treating chronic acidosis include:
• Reducing bone demineralization.
• Improving appetite.
• Reducing muscle wasting and malnutrition.

823

824

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Renal tubular acidosis
A group of disorders characterized by impaired renal handling of acid,
usually with normal renal function. The basis for the, often confusing, terminology used for RTA revolves around physiology: almost all ﬁltered
bicarbonate (HCO3– ) is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, with no
net acid excretion. All net acid excretion occurs in the distal nephron
(b p. 930). See Table 10.5 for distinguishing types of RTA.

Distal RTA (type 1)
Disordered excretion of acid (H+) from the A-intercalated cell in the collecting duct leads to acidosis. Presents as a hyperchloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis, with hypophosphataemic metabolic bone disease,
renal stones, or diffuse nephrocalcinosis (requirement to chronically
buffer acidosis l bone buffering). Is (rarely) inherited or, more commonly,
acquired secondary to:
• Sjögren’s syndrome, RA, SLE, and other autoimmune diseases.
• Nephrocalcinosis (distal RTA is confusingly both a cause and result of
nephrocalcinosis) of any cause.
• Drugs (analgesic nephropathy, ifosfamide, amphotericin, lithium).
• Chronic tubulointerstitial disease (of any cause, b p. 582).
• Dysproteinaemias (hypergammaglobulinaemia, amyloidosis).
Investigations
• i u-pH (>5.3 in the face of acidosis).
• d K+, d HCO3– <12mmol/L, normal AG (i Cl–).
• Positive urinary AG (b p. 820), i u-Ca2+, d u-citrate (absorbed to
buffer acidosis).
• Plain KUB or USS may show nephrocalcinosis.
• ANF, anti-Ro/La, rheumatoid factor.
If partial RTA suspected, either:
• Acid loading test: 0.1g/kg NH4Cl PO, with u-pH hourly, HCO3– at +3
hours. If HCO3– <21 and u-pH >5.3, diagnose RTA.
• Furosemide (40mg PO) and ﬂudrocortisone (1mg PO) test: stat
simultaneous dose, then hourly urine pH to 6 hours. At +6 hours, if
HCO3– <21 and u-pH >5.3, diagnose RTA.
Treatment
Potassium citrate 3–10g/day in three divided doses (citrate generates two
bicarbonate molecules) or sodium bicarbonate 4–12g/day in four divided
doses, aiming for s-HCO3– >22mmol/L.

Proximal RTA (type 2)
Impaired retention of HCO3– in the proximal tubule leads to bicarbonate wasting and a systemic acidosis. Presents as a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, usually with other features of proximal tubular dysfunction
(so-called Fanconi syndrome, see b p. 825). Commoner causes include:
• Myeloma and amyloidosis.
• Cystinosis, Wilson’s disease, or heavy metal toxicity (lead, cadmium).
• Drugs (acetazolamide, antiretroviral drugs, aminoglycosides).

RENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS

Investigations
Although the u-pH may be >5.5, usually d u-pH <5.3, once steady state
achieved with chronic acidosis (as falling ﬁltered bicarbonate means less
bicarbonate wasting).
2 If IVI NaHCO3 1mmol/kg/h given, distal reabsorption is overwhelmed
and u-pH i >7.
• d K+, with i distal Na+ delivery and hyperaldosteronism l K+ wasting.
• d HCO3– (12–20mmol/L), normal AG (i Cl–), negative u-AG (see
below). Findings of Fanconi.
Treatment
 High-dose bicarbonate merely i HCO3– wasting and increases Na+
delivery to the distal nephron (and so worsens d K+). Aim to allow
mild acidosis: potassium bicarbonate 1.5–3g/day in three divided doses
(KHCO3– is less calciuric, replenishes K+ and Na+ load). Thiazide diuretics
may also be helpful.

Fanconi syndrome
A descriptive term for generalized proximal tubular dysfunction. It is
marked by failure of proximal reabsorption of many ﬁltered substances
and classically describes glucosuria, aminoaciduria, and phosphaturia.
Excretion of uric acid and LMW proteins is also increased. Commonly
seen in association with type 2 RTA.
• May present with bone pain 9 osteomalacia. Causes as for
proximal RTA.
• Investigations: metabolic acidosis, d s-phosphate, d s-urate.
Glycosuria and proteinuria (amino acids), i u-phosphate, and i
u-citrate.
Drug-induced Fanconi
Occurs with antivirals (tenofovir, adefovir, and cidofovir), didanosine, out-of-date tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, sodium valproate, or
ifosfamide.

Hyperkalaemic distal RTA (type 4)
Is much more common than proximal RTA or distal RTA and is due
to hypoaldosteronism, usually hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism.
Aldosterone promotes urinary K+ loss, so its absence l hyperkalaemia.
i K+ impairs NH3 secretion, limiting net acid excretion l acidosis. Causes
include:
• Diabetes mellitus (often with mild renal impairment).
• Drugs (NSAIDs, ciclosporin, heparin, co-trimoxazole).
• Obstructive uropathy.
• Chronic tubulointerstitial disease of any cause (b p. 582) 9 CKD.
• Addison’s or selective aldosterone deﬁciency.

Treatment
If due to hypoadrenalism, mineralocorticoid replacement (ﬂudrocortisone
100–300 micrograms/day) will rapidly reverse the problem.
 Often revealed in patients taking ACE-I and increasingly spironolactone for treatment of heart failure. Advise low K+ diet (b p. 259).
Mineralocorticoids rarely useful because of signiﬁcant Na+ retention in
at-risk patients (CKD, heart failure). Trial of furosemide 40–120mg od.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Lactic acidosis
L-lactate is an end-product of anaerobic glucose metabolism: glucose
is metabolized to pyruvate. In hypoxic tissue, oxidative regeneration of
NAD+ cannot occur, so pyruvate is used with NADH and H+ by lactate
dehydrogenase to produce NAD+ (crucial earlier for glycolysis) and lactate. In health, lactate is usually rapidly oxidized by the liver. The normal
plasma concentration is between 0.5 and 1.5mmol/L. Signiﬁcant lactic acidosis is present if blood lactate is >3.5mmol/L, with an increased anion
gap. Conventionally, lactic acidosis is divided into:

Type A lactic acidosis
Secondary to increased O2 demand or inadequate O2 delivery (tissue
underperfsuion), causes of which include:
• Shock:
• Cardiogenic.
• Septic.
• Hypovolaemic.
• Severe anaemia.
• Localized tissue or organ ischaemia (infarcted gut, muscle).
• i energy-dependent work (usually in skeletal muscle):
• Seizures.
• Extreme exercise.
• Malignant hyperthermia.
• Respiratory failure with severe hypoxaemia.
• Carbon monoxide poisoning.

Type B lactic acidosis
Secondary to abnormal lactate metabolism, the underproduction or
over-utilization of ATP or other causes of defective gluconeogenesis
(drugs!). Causes include:
• Mitochondrial dysfunction, either congenital or drug-induced (b p. 829).
• Thiamine deﬁciency.
• Metabolic derangements involving oxidation:
• Diabetes mellitus—especially when poorly controlled.
• Ethanol poisoning.
• Liver impairment.
D-lactic acidosis is a rare cause of an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis
where bacterial overgrowth in intestinal blind loops leads to increased
lactate absorption—the proliferating organisms (and not humans) are
capable of producing the D-isomer.

Management of lactic acidosis
Treat the underlying cause—there is no role for systemic NaHCO3. So the
treatment of type A lactic acidosis involves improving oxygenation: resuscitate shock; restore blood ﬂow, and/or improve gas exchange.

LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Drugs and lactic acidosis
Metformin has long been thought to cause a type B lactic acidosis, particularly in diabetics with renal impairment. There is some doubt about
this association. However, current NICE recommendations are to stop
metformin if SCr >150μmol/L (1.7mg/dL) or eGFR <30mL/min/1.73m2.
Recently, reverse transcriptase inhibitors have also been found to
cause an often severe lactic acidosis as a result of mitochondrial injury—
in life-threatening cases (lactate >10mmol/L), consider L-carnitine.
Other drugs recognized as causes of type B lactic acidosis:
• Ethanol, cocaine, paracetamol, salicylate.
• Zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine, zalcitabine.
• Propofol, isoniazid.
• Niacin, nitroprusside, cyanide.
• Sorbitol and fructose.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Alkalosis
Metabolic alkalosis
Metabolic alkalosis is common (as might be expected from its causes) and,
if severe (pH >7.55), is associated with mortality as high as 45%. Either
retention of base or loss of acid in the ECF leads to a rising serum bicarbonate and pH. To buffer such changes, patients can hypoventilate to i
pCO2 to as much as 7kPa (x 7.5 for kPa l mmHg). For each 1mmol/L rise
in serum HCO3– above normal, the pCO2 will rise by 9 0.08kPa to buffer
the alkalosis (e.g. to buffer a serum HCO3– of 34mmol/L, the pCO2 will
need to rise by 0.8kPa).
Causes of a metabolic alkalosis include:
• With low chloride:
• Gastric losses (vomiting, NG suction, self-induced vomiting).
• Diuretics (thiazide, loop diuretics).
• Diarrhoea (esp. chloride-secreting villous adenoma).
• Cystic ﬁbrosis.

Chloride-losing alkaloses
With vomiting or NG losses, the stomach generates replacement gastric
HCl, in the process returning HCO3– to the ECF. NaCl loss into gastric
ﬂuids l volume contraction as well.
Diuretics block NaCl uptake, with ECF depletion (s hyperaldosteronism) and i salt delivery to the DCT (6i exchange of Na+ for K+ and
H+). Diuretic-induced d K+ exacerbates alkalosis further.
• With low potassium:
• p hyperaldosteronism (and, less commonly, s).
• Drugs (carbenoloxone, liquorice, laxative abuse).
• Bartter’s, Liddle’s, and Gitelman’s syndromes (b p. 800).

Hypokalaemic alkalosis
Hyperaldosteronism leads to i Na+ retention at the expense of K+ and
H+. d K+ may increase net acid excretion.
The intracellular acidosis found with d K+ leads to i HCO3– retention
in the kidney.
• Other:
• Milk-alkali syndrome (or hypercalcaemia of other causes usually s
to calcium and vitamin D-containing preparations, occasionally in
association with thiazide diuretic use, the so-called calcium-alkali
syndrome).
• Overzealous bicarbonate therapy (esp. if with CKD).
• Penicillins (cation load l uHCO3– wasting).
• Massive transfusion (citrate load).

ALKALOSIS

Symptoms and signs
Often due to associated hypovolaemia or hypokalaemia. With severe alkalosis, d cerebral and myocardial blood ﬂow: headaches, confusion, seizures,
angina, arrhythmias. Compensatory hypoventilation and hypocapnoea may
be important in critically ill patients (failure to wean off ventilator).
O2 delivery to tissues is reduced (through alkalosis-induced vasoconstriction and reduced O2 release—the dissociation curve is shifted
leftwards).
Investigations
Only consider ABG if evaluating respiratory contribution to a mixed acid–
base disorder.
• U&E (d K+, d Cl–). ? i Ca2+.
• Urinary electrolytes:
• u-Cl– <10mmol/L if gastric losses (2 surreptitious vomiting).
• u-Cl– >30mmol/L if diuretic therapy (abuse), Bartter’s, Gitelman’s.
• u-K+ >30mmol/L if diuretics, hyperaldosteronism.
• u-K+ <20mmol/L if extrarenal K+ losses.
Diagnosis usually obvious: urinary diuretic/laxative screen, renin and aldosterone, if indicated.
Treatment
Depends on the cause:
• Treat d Cl– alkalosis with chloride.
• Replacement of lost Cl– is the mainstay of treatment.
• If volume-deplete: 0.9% saline (NaCl) 3–5L/day IVI.
• If volume-overloaded: KCl, rather than NaCl (unless i K+).
• Treat d K+ alkalosis with KCl (b p. 799).
• Reverse the underlying cause:
• Stop alkali therapy.
• Stop diuretics, if possible, or add K+-sparing agent, esp. if
hyperaldosteronism present (spironolactone).
• Antiemetics (e.g. metoclopramide 10mg IMI/IVI).
• If NG drainage needed, H2 receptor antagonist or proton pump
inhibitor.
• Acetazolamide 250–500mg daily will cause NaHCO3– wasting.
Particularly useful in those with chronic lung disease (and need their
respiratory drive) or with acute unstable cardiac syndromes.

Respiratory alkalosis
Always a result of overventilation (due to mechanical ventilation),
increased central respiratory drive (anxiety, pregnancy, stroke, or CNS
infection), or hypoxaemia (mild asthma, pulmonary oedema, or emboli).
Treatment can be difﬁcult if alkalosis severe.

Urgent reversal of severe metabolic alkalosis (in ITU)
Indications
• Bicarbonate >45mmol/L (or pH >7.55), and
• Hepatic encephalopathy, or
• Arrhythmias (including digoxin toxicity), or
• Confusion, seizures.
Correct K+
IVI hydrochloric acid (HCl) via central line: body weight (in kg) x 0.5
(bicarbonate space = 50% body weight) x required d HCO3– (mmol/L)
= mmol HCl infused at 0.2mmol/kg/h.
Example: in a 70kg male, to d HCO3– by 10mmol/L, 0.1M HCl solution
(10 x 70 x 0.5 = 350mmol) at 35mmol/h for 10 hours to reduce plasma
bicarbonate by 10mmol/L. Alternatives include NH4Cl or arginine HCl.
HD or CVVHF also provide rapid correction of severe alkalosis.

Mixed disturbances
As a rule of thumb, pH will rise or fall by 0.1 if:
• [HCO3–] changes by 6mmol/L, or
• pCO2 changes by 1.58kPa.
For example, a fall in [HCO3–] from 24 to 12 = pH from 7.4 to 7.2, or a
rise in pCO2 from 5.5 to 7.9 = pH from 7.4 to 7.25.

Mixed acid–base disturbances are not uncommon in hospitalized
patients: the key to diagnosis is recognizing when compensation is inappropriate. Using Table 10.7, the following should be expected:
• Metabolic acidosis: pCO2 falls by [24 – actual HCO3–] x 0.17.
• Metabolic alkalosis: pCO2 rises by [actual HCO3–– 24] x 0.08.
• Acute respiratory alkalosis: [HCO3–] falls to not less than 18mmol/L.
• Acute respiratory acidosis: [HCO3–] rises by [0.75 x pCO2– 5.3] 9 3.
• Chronic respiratory alkalosis: [HCO3–] falls to not less than 14mmol/L.
• Chronic respiratory acidosis: [HCO3–] rises by [3 x pCO2– 5.3] 9 4.
If compensation does not fall roughly within these limits, there is likely to
be a mixed component to the disturbance:
• What is the pH (acidotic or alkalotic)?
• Is predominant cause metabolic or respiratory?
• Is compensation appropriate?
• If not, a mixed acid–base disturbance is present.
See Fig. 10.2 for the acid–base nomogram.

CHAPTER 10

Fluids and electrolytes

Tubular rarities
Cystinuria (see b p. 719)
Defective uptake of ﬁltered cystine and other dibasic amino acids from the
urine leads to cystine stone formation. Autosomal recessive inheritance of
genes encoding tubular amino acid transporter proteins presents in childhood or adolescence with ﬂank pain 9 haematuria (calculi).
Urine microscopy shows characteristic hexagonal crystalluria (see
Fig. 10.3). i 24h urinary cystine excretion (>2mmol/day, NR <0.15),
radio-opaque calculi on plain KUB or USS. Aim to increase oral ﬂuids
for UO of >3–4L/day. If u-cystine remains >1mmol/L (cystine is insoluble
much above this), add in penicillamine 1–2g/day in four divided doses.
Alternatives include tiopronin up to 400mg daily or captopril. All work by
increasing cystine solubility. For managing stones, see b p. 722.

Cystinosis
 Is not the same disease as cystinuria
Presents in childhood with growth failure, Fanconi syndrome, and progressive renal impairment. Eye involvement, hepatomegaly, hypothyroidism,
and diabetes develop, as cystine deposits impair organ function. An adolescent variant with normal stature and tubular function, but renal impairment, offers a better renal prognosis. An autosomal recessively inherited
defect in cystine export from intracellular lysosomes leads to accumulation and local injury. Oral cysteamine forms a complex with cystine that
can leave lysosomes, ameliorating disease.

Hyperoxaluria
An autosomal recessive condition presenting in childhood marked by i
u-oxalate excretion, calcium oxalate calculi, and nephrocalcinosis.
Defective synthesis or targeting of the enzyme AGXT, which converts
glyoxalate to glycine, leads to compensatory shuttling of glyoxalate to
oxalate. Heavy oxalate deposition in the heart, blood vessels, and joints
causes signiﬁcant morbidity. The treatment of choice is combined liver–
kidney transplantation, although high-dose pyridoxine offers interim beneﬁt. Rarely, hyperoxaluria and nephrocalcinosis may be associated with
Crohn’s disease. See Fig. 10.4 for radiography of the abdomen

Dent’s disease
An X-linked inherited defect in the gene encoding CLC-5, a chloride channel responsible for endosomal acidiﬁcation in the proximal tubule and
elsewhere. This leads to impaired endocytosis and uptake of urinary proteins. Presents predominantly in ♂ (♀ may have urinary abnormalities) as
Fanconi syndrome (b p. 825), hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal
impairment. Rickets and osteomalacia are common. Renal transplantation
is the treatment of choice for ESRD, and patients generally do well. Other
syndromes, such as X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis, X-linked recessive
hypophosphataemic rickets, and idiopathic low molecular weight proteinuria of Japanese children, are now known to be due to similar defects.

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Physiological changes during pregnancy
Systemic changes
• Signiﬁcant changes to cardiovascular function and volume homeostasis
begin early in pregnancy.
• Increased cardiac output (up to 50%).
• Increased plasma volume (up to 30–40%).
• Increased peripheral vasodilatation, with corresponding decrease
in systemic vascular resistance (l fall in BP and widening of pulse
pressure during 1st and 2nd trimesters that normalizes during 3rd
trimester).
• The fall in BP is actually modest, in comparison to the increase in
CO and intravascular volume, as there is a signiﬁcant concomitant
increase in vascular compliance.

Renal changes
• Increased renal blood ﬂow, up to 70–80% in 2nd trimester (under
the inﬂuence of NO, vasodilator prostaglandins and relaxin).
Trans-glomerular capillary pressure remains the same, with matching
dilatation of both afferent and efferent arterioles.
• Marked stimulation of RAAS.
• Increased GFR (40% by end of 1st trimester).
• Increase in proteinuria.
• ≤300mg/24h is not signiﬁcant in pregnancy.
• It is important to quantify baseline pre-existing proteinuria at the
start of pregnancy (uACR/uPCR).
• Pre-existing proteinuria is likely to double.
Renal function
(See Table 11.1.)
• 1 eGFR is not validated in pregnancy: MDRD underestimates, and
Cockcroft–Gault overestimates, true GFR.
• 2 SCr >80μmol/L (0.9mg/dL) or Ur >5mmol/L (14mg/dL) during
pregnancy may indicate renal impairment and warrant further evaluation.
• 24h urinary creatinine clearance (b p. 33) remains the gold standard
for the measurement of renal function during pregnancy (NR: 125–
150mL/min; 30% above range for non-pregnant women).

PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES DURING PREGNANCY

Tubular function
• Glycosuria does not necessarily indicate impaired glucose tolerance
during pregnancy. If persistent, measure blood glucose.
• Tubular handling of bicarbonate and acid is unchanged, but
hyperventilation in pregnancy leads to d pCO2, a mild respiratory
alkalosis (i pH from 7.4 to 7.43). HCO3– excretion increases and
serum HCO3– falls to 18–22mmol/L to compensate.
• Urinary calcium excretion is increased.
• Serum urate falls in early pregnancy: as a rough guide the intrapartum
urate should be 0 (gestational age in weeks), i.e. at 26 weeks, urate will
be 70.26mmol/L.
• Plasma osmolality is reduced:
• Women gain an average 9–14kg during pregnancy, with up to 8L as
i total body water.
• The threshold for arginine vasopressin (AVP or ADH) release is
lowered, resulting in sustained AVP release in the face of plasma
dilution and 6 a true fall in plasma osmolality (710mOsmol/kg).
• Serum Na+ falls to 132–140mmol/L (1 Na+ >140mmol/L may
indicate hypernatraemia in pregnancy).
• Rarely, transient diabetes insipidus of pregnancy (with polyuria) may
develop in the 3rd trimester (the result of either incomplete cranial
DI in susceptible women or increased AVP degradation).

Anatomical changes
• Increased kidney volume, size, and weight.
• Renal length increases by 71cm.
• Collecting system dilatation:
• May begin at 8 weeks. Apparent in 90% of women by 20 weeks’
gestation (72cm above normal diameter).
• More obvious on right (uterine veins, enlarging uterus, and iliac
artery compress the right ureter l‘iliac sign’ on IVU, with abrupt
ureteric cut-off at the pelvic brim).
• Assessments made during pregnancy should be interpreted with
caution.
• Collecting system dilatation usually resolves within 48h of delivery in
50% of cases but can still be present up to 12 weeks post-partum.

841

842

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Urinary tract infection
Introduction
Anatomical, functional, and hormonal changes in the urinary tract make
UTI more common in pregnancy. Pyelonephritis is the most common
renal complication of pregnancy, occurring in 1–2% of all pregnancies.
In addition, preterm labour or low birthweight infants may be associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria or UTI (mechanism: possible amnionitis li inﬂammatory cytokine synthesis, provoking uterine contraction).
Untreated UTI may be associated with subsequent developmental delay in
the child and even increased risk of fetal death.

Bacteriology
80–90% due to E. coli. Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., or Gram +ve organisms may also be implicated. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection near
delivery may lead to vaginal colonization and serious neonatal sepsis, so
penicillin prophylaxis should be given during labour.

Risk factors
• Asymptomatic bacteriuria (>105 cfu/mL urine) occurs in 4–7% of
women and, in pregnancy, is associated with pyelonephritis in 30% of
cases, if untreated.
• Send urine for culture at ﬁrst antenatal visit.
• If asymptomatic bacteriuria is present, send a second sample.
• If second sample positive, l treat.
• The absence of bacteriuria at antenatal booking is associated with
<2% chance of UTI through pregnancy.
• Further risk factors for bacteriuria or frank UTI prior to delivery
include:
• UTI before falling pregnant or UTI in previous pregnancies.
• An abnormal urinary tract.
• Diabetes mellitus, HIV positivity, or sickle cell disease.
• Prolonged labour, Cesarean section, pre-eclampsia, placental
abruption, and urinary catheters are all risk factors for
post-partum UTI.

Diagnosis
•
•
•
•

Dysuria, frequency, urgency, or offensive urine suggests UTI.
Loin pain, backache, vomiting, and fevers often occur in pyelonephritis.
Suprapubic or renal angle tenderness may be present.
Dipstick for leucocytes or nitrites may suggest UTI but will often miss
asymptomatic bacteriuria. 2 Send MSU for M,C+S.
• If pyelonephritis suspected: blood cultures, FBC, U&E, CRP. Consider
USS renal tract. Fetal well-being should be assessed.

3 Acute pyelonephritis
Pyelonephritis is more common in the second half of pregnancy and is a
signiﬁcant cause of fetal mortality and maternal morbidity. The increasing
size of the uterus may cause ureteral obstruction and impaired urinary
ﬂow (particularly on the right), encouraging stasis and sepsis.

URINARY TRACT INFECTION

Recurrent UTIs in pregnancy
2 After more than one UTI (or a single episode in 5 with an abnormal
urinary tract), women should be offered prophylactic antibiotics for the
duration of the pregnancy.
Post-coital cefalexin 500mg PO stat or cefalexin 500mg nocte for 1 month,
alternating with nitrofurantoin 100mg nocte, have proved safe and effective.
Antimicrobial choice should ideally reﬂect sensitivities of organisms cultured.
Post-partum investigation is recommended (b p. 708).

Treatment of UTI in pregnancy
Asymptomatic bacteriuria or cystitis
• First line, prior to sensitivities becoming available:
• Nitrofurantoin 50mg PO qds x 7 days, or
• Cefalexin 500mg PO bd (or 250mg qds) x 7 days.
• Trimethoprim 200mg bd PO (1 but give a folic acid supplement
during the 1st trimester, and avoid if patient is folate-deﬁcient or
taking a folate antagonist, or if trimethoprim has been used in the
preceding year).
• Amoxicillin 250mg qds PO x 7 days (often ﬁrst choice if
sensitivities known).
• Ampicillin 500mg PO qds x 7–10 days for group B Streptococcus
infections—and inform the patient's antenatal service, as
prophylactic antibiotics may be indicated during labour and delivery.
• Repeat MSU for M,C+S monthly to conﬁrm eradication.

Pyelonephritis
•
•
•
•
•

Admit.
IV access and rehydration with 0.9% NaCl, as required.
Ceftriaxone 1g IV od or cefotaxime 1–2g IV qds.
Alternative: ampicillin 1g IV qds + gentamicin 1.5mg/kg tds.
If the patient is immunocompromised and/or has incomplete urinary
drainage, then seek urgent microbiological advice.
1 Fluoroquinolones, such as ciproﬂoxacin, should be avoided, unless
resistant organisms are cultured. Co-trimoxazole needs to be used with
caution (sulfonamides should not be used in the 3rd trimester).

Safe antibiotics in pregnancy
• Penicillins.
• Cephalosporins.
• Nitrofurantoin (a recent large Norwegian population study suggests
low teratogenic potential but increased risk of neonatal jaundice if
used within 30 days of delivery).
• Trimethoprim (1 safe after 1st trimester (b p. 843)).

AKI during pregnancy
Introduction
AKI during pregnancy remains a signiﬁcant problem in the developing
world, accounting for up to 20% of all AKI (usually in circumstances where
there is no access to safe and sterile termination). 2 In the developed
world, pre-eclampsia is the commonest pregnancy-related cause of AKI.
Causes
Pre-renal
• Volume depletion:
• Esp. s to hyperemesis gravidarum during the 1st trimester.
• Placental abruption:
• Presents with abdominal pain and PV bleeding in 2nd or 3rd
trimester. A classical cause of cortical necrosis (b p. 845).
• Post-partum haemorrhage (see also cortical necrosis, b p. 845).
• Septic abortion (b p. 845). Common in the developing world.
Presents with abdominal pain, fever, and shock.
Renal
• Pre-eclampsia (b p. 850).
• Acute fatty liver of pregnancy:
• 3rd trimester. Presents with coagulopathy, abnormal LFTs,
hypoglycaemia, and lactic acidosis. AKI common.
• HUS/TTP (b p. 845):
• May present in either the antenatal or post-natal period.
• Exacerbation of existing renal disease, e.g. SLE:
• Renal biopsy may be required to conﬁrm diagnosis and is safe in
early pregnancy in expert hands.
• Acute interstitial nephritis (b p. 580):
• Often drug-related, e.g. NSAIDs, antibiotics, proton pump
inhibitors.
• Nephrotoxic drugs (b p. 898).
Post-renal
• Acute urinary retention:
• 3rd trimester. Relates to bulk of expanding uterus.
• Also occurs following combined kidney/pancreas transplantation
where the transplanted kidney is placed in an intraperitoneal
location (unusual in renal transplantation alone where the
transplant is in the false pelvis).
Investigations
SCr (2 a SCr of >80μmol/L (0.9mg/dL) may indicate of renal impairment
in pregnancy). FBC, U&E, LFTs, calcium, clotting, urate, haemolysis screen,
G&S, infection screen (MSU, blood cultures, vaginal swabs, as appropriate).
Management
Similar to non-pregnant patients. Careful assessment of ﬂuid status, with
correction of volume depletion. Treat underlying cause.

AKI DURING PREGNANCY

Septic abortion
Sudden onset (over hours) after attempted abortion. Fever (often >40*C),
rigors, myalgia, vomiting, and diarrhoea (may be bloody). Abdominal pain
is common, but vaginal discharge is often absent. Progression to septic
shock, with d BP, i HR, peripheral vasodilatation, oliguria, and DIC is rapid.
Culpable organisms include E. coli and Clostridia.

Investigations
Blood cultures, Hb (haemolysis), d Plt (DIC) G&S, clotting, D-dimers,
U&E, LFT. Perform VE for high vaginal swabs (l M,C+S). Plain AXR
may show intrauterine or intra–abdominal gas. Consider USS or CT to
exclude pyometrium.

Management
Transfer to critical care. O2, resuscitate with IV ﬂuids and blood products (b p. 168). 2 Benzylpenicillin 1.2–2.4g IVI qds, metronidazole
500mg IVI tds + Gram –ve cover (e.g. cefuroxime 1.5g stat, followed by
750mg IVI tds or ciproﬂoxacin 200mg IVI bd, adjusted for SCr).

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
Occurs late in pregnancy or immediately post-partum. Part of a spectrum
of pregnancy-related diseases characterized by endothelial dysfunction
with end-organ damage (which also includes pre-eclampsia). Presents with
nausea, vomiting, jaundice, encephalopathy, acute hepatitis, and DIC. AKI
is common. Management is supportive. Expedite delivery, if possible.

Cortical necrosis
Common historically, especially after placental abruption and post-partum
haemorrhage. Sudden and profound renal vasospasm (often with marked
d BP) causes patchy infarction of the renal cortex. Causes severe AKI
(often with persistent anuria) and often irreversible renal failure.
Contrast-enhanced CT scanning, Doppler USS or MAG-3 isotope scanning will demonstrate the perfusion defects.

HUS/TTP (b p. 574)
Very rare (71 in 100,000 pregnancies). Presents with AKI (often requiring
RRT), usually in the 3rd trimester or early puerperium (up to 10 weeks
post-partum), but can occur throughout pregnancy. Endothelial dysfunction, with microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia (both
typically severe), and coagulopathy are present. i BP (>70%) and proteinuria (>80%) are common. May follow an otherwise unremarkable
(normotensive and non-proteinuric) pregnancy.
Easily (and 6 commonly) confused with other diagnoses, such as
pre-eclampsia, HELLP, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. It is important to consider the diagnosis, as early
treatment (FFP/plasmapheresis) is helping to improve historically poor
outcomes for maternal morbidity and mortality. Pregnancy d ADAMTS13
levels (as does HELLP)—but they will be much lower in TTP and many
cases of HUS (although usually not available to assist immediate management). Relapse may occur in subsequent pregnancies.

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Hypertension during pregnancy
Introduction
Blood pressure falls in the early stages of a normal pregnancy and returns
to pre-pregnancy baseline by term.
Hypertension is the most common medical problem encountered during pregnancy, affecting 75–10% of women. Hypertensive disorders during
pregnancy carry risks for the mother and are among the leading causes of
maternal death in the developed world. Hypertensive disorders also carry
a risk for the fetus in terms of higher perinatal mortality rates, preterm
birth, and low birthweight.

Deﬁnition (NICE)
Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of >90mmHg on two separate occasions,
more than 4 hours apart, and/or a single DBP reading of >110mmHg.

Degrees of hypertension
• Mild: DBP 90–99mmHg, SBP 140–149mmHg.
• Moderate: DBP 100–109mmHg, SBP 150–159mmHg.
• Severe: DBP ≥110mmHg, SBP ≥160mmHg.
Causes
• Pre-existing essential hypertension (‘chronic hypertension’)
(b p. 847).
• Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) (‘gestational hypertension’)
(b p. 847).
• Pre-eclampsia (b p. 850).
• Hypertension complicating renal disease (either pre-existing or
developing during pregnancy) (b p. 856) or other causes of secondary
i BP (e.g. hyperaldosteronism or phaeochromocytoma).

Measuring blood pressure in pregnant women
• Use a well-maintained mercury/aneroid sphygmomanometer or
validated automated device.
• Use the stethoscope bell for auscultation.
• 2 Always use the correct-sized cuff.
• Measure with patient sitting after a period of rest, with the arm
supported at heart level.
• Either arm, but use higher value if >10mmHg difference.
• Record SBP when sounds are ﬁrst heard (Korotkoff 1) and DBP at
the point of disappearance of sounds (Korotkoff 5).
• If the DBP is persistently below 40mmHg, use Korotkoff 4 (and make
a note).

HYPERTENSION DURING PREGNANCY

Pre-existing essential hypertension (‘chronic hypertension’)
• Presents prior to conception or before 20 weeks’ gestation (as BP
tends to fall in the 1st and 2nd trimesters, a woman with i BP before
20 weeks can be assumed to have pre-existing hypertension).
• X Treatment targets for hypertensive women without pre-eclampsia
remain controversial. Although treatment is likely to have maternal
beneﬁts, this must be balanced against potential harm to the fetus
(particularly IUGR).
• Goals:
• For uncomplicated i BP, aim <150/100mmHg (but DBP no less
than 80mmHg).
• If evidence of target organ damage (e.g. renal disease), aim
<140/90mmHg.
• Encourage to lower dietary salt intake.
• Ensure antihypertensives are altered appropriately, ideally, several
months prior to conception (and that BP then stabilizes) or as soon
as possible once pregnancy occurs (b p. 849). Treatment should be
based on existing therapy, potential side effect proﬁles, and discussion
with the patient.
• Seek specialist advice if known or suspected secondary i BP.
• The majority of pregnancies are uncomplicated, although outcomes
are worse than for pregnancy in normotensive patients. There is:
• An increased incidence of placental abruption, AKI, cardiac events,
and stroke in the mother.
• Increased risk of growth retardation and unexplained mid-trimester
fetal death.
• A pre-eclampsia risk of 720%. Warn about symptoms (b p. 852).
• These risks correlate with maternal age, duration and degree of
i BP, obesity, and presence of end-organ damage.
• Recommend aspirin 75mg od from 12 weeks’ gestation onwards to
reduce pre-eclampsia risk.
• Calcium supplementation may have a small role in preventing serious
adverse events, such as fetal death, associated with pre-eclampsia in
populations with a low calcium intake (<600mg/day).
• If proteinuria develops after 20 weeks’ gestation, treat as for
pre-eclampsia.

Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) (‘gestational
hypertension’)
•
•
•
•
•
•

Occurs after 20 weeks’ gestation.
Not associated with proteinuria.
Usually no pre-existing diagnosis of i BP.
Risk factors include ﬁrst pregnancy and maternal age >40 years.
BP returns to normal post-partum (within 3 months).
Increased risk of progression to pre-eclampsia (15–25%)—the earlier
the development of PIH, the greater the risk. Warn the mother about
potential symptoms (b p. 852).

847

848

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

• Aspirin 75mg until delivery in those with one high risk factor or two
moderate risk factors for pre-eclampsia.
• High risk: hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy, CKD,
diabetes, thrombophilia, or relevant autoimmune disease (such as
SLE or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome).
• Moderate risk: ﬁrst pregnancy, age >40 years, pregnancy interval of
10 years, BMI >35, +ve family history, twin or multiple pregnancy).
• Calcium supplements may be beneﬁcial in certain groups (b p. 852).
• Increased risk of both PIH (16–47%) and pre-eclampsia (2–7%) in
subsequent pregnancies.
• Although the cause of gestational hypertension is unclear, it appears to
identify women at risk of essential i BP later in life.
Management
BP lowering is not an end in itself—maternal and fetal well-being are also
important indicators of the underlying condition.
• Mild hypertension (BP 140/90–149/99mmHg):
• Do not treat i BP. Measure BP no more than weekly.
• Test for proteinuria at each visit.
• If <32 weeks or high risk of pre-eclampsia, test for proteinuria, and
measure BP twice weekly.
• Moderate hypertension (BP 150/100–159/109mmHg):
• Treat to keep BP <150/80–100mmHg (ﬁrst-line agent: labetolol).
• Measure BP; test for proteinuria twice a week.
• Check SCr, U&E, FBC, and LFTs at presentation.
• Severe hypertension (BP ≥160/110mmHg):
• 1 Admit until BP ≤159/109mmHg.
• No role for ‘bed rest’.
• Treat to keep BP <150/80–100mmHg (ﬁrst-line agent: labetolol).
• Measure BP at least 4x per day.
• Test for proteinuria daily.
• Check SCr, U&E, FBC, and LFTs at presentation and then weekly.
• Fetal assessment includes USS for fetal growth, amniotic ﬂuid
volume assessment, and umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry. Fetal
cardiotocography should be performed if there is any change in
condition, such as a decrease in fetal movements.
• Early delivery is not usually required, unless severe refractory i BP or
other complications supervene.

Guidelines
The NICE guidelines for hypertension in pregnancy are a very useful
resource. They are available at M www.nice.org.uk

HYPERTENSION DURING PREGNANCY

Drug treatment of hypertension in pregnancy
1 No drug is entirely ‘safe’ in pregnancy. However, experience has
allowed an inference of low fetal risk for many agents (see Table 11.2).
1 ACE-I (and ARBs) are contraindicated during pregnancy: 1st trimester
use is associated with an increased risk of cardiac and CNS malformations, and 2nd trimester use is associated with fetal death, oligohydramnios, growth restriction, and renal agenesis.
1 Diuretics should be avoided in pregnancy, as hypovolaemia may compromise placental blood ﬂow. Occasionally, severe oedema, e.g. in the
context of nephrotic syndrome, necessitates their use, but this should
under close specialist supervision.

Breastfeeding
Antihypertensive agents safe for breastfeeding in the post-natal period
include enalapril, captopril, labetalol, nifedipine, atenolol, and metoprolol. 1There is insufﬁcient evidence to recommend other ACE-I, ARBs,
or amlodipine.

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Pre-eclampsia: pathophysiology
Introduction
Pre-eclampsia (from the Greek eclampsus or lightning) is a pregnancy speciﬁc multisystem disorder, characterized by the development of i BP and
proteinuria, usually, but not always, after 20 weeks’ gestation. It affects
3–5% of pregnant women and is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal
morbidity and mortality. The only cure is delivery, hence an association
with prematurity. It is also associated with fetal growth restriction and
oligohydramnios. Maternal complications include pulmonary oedema, cerebral haemorrhage, hepatic failure, AKI, and death. Seizures (2% of cases)
herald the development of eclampsia.

Pathogenesis
The placenta plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia
and the related conditions of PIH, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, HELLP
syndrome, and pregnancy-induced HUS/TTP. All are associated with
inadequate placental cytotrophoblast invasion and widespread maternal
endothelial dysfunction (see Fig. 11.1).

Pre-eclampsia and the placenta
During normal placental development, cytotrophoblasts of fetal origin invade the uterine spiral arteries and remodel them from small,
high-resistance vessels into larger, more dilated vessels able to provide
an adequate blood supply to the developing fetus.
In pre-eclampsia, this remodelling is defective, with dysregulation of
several angiogenic factors, including soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1
(sFlt-1) (itself a receptor for placental growth factor (PlGF) and VEGF)
and endoglin (sEng) (which impairs binding of TGF-1 to endothelial
receptors and leads to d endothelial NO-dependent vasodilatation).
High concentrations of sFlt-1 are present in in the blood of women
with pre-eclampsia, and the administration of sFlt-1 to animals produces a similar syndrome. Several studies of the utility of biomarkers,
including sFlt-1, sEng, and PlGF, for the prediction and early diagnosis of
pre-eclampsia are in progress.
Low placental L-arginine activity also reduces NO activity, thereby
stimulating endothelial NO synthase to generate reactive oxygen species (e.g. peroxynitrite and OH radical) and worsen oxidative stress.
Subsequent release of vasopressive factors from the diseased placenta
affects maternal endothelium, with increased sensitivity to vasopressors,
such as angiotensin II and noradrenaline. This results in the widespread
vasoconstriction, hypoperfusion, ischaemia, and vascular dysfunction,
characteristic of the clinical syndrome.
Abnormalities of RAS, inﬂammation, immune maladaptation, and
genetic susceptibility also appear to play a role.

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Pre-eclampsia: management
Introduction
2 Pre-eclampsia has the potential to deteriorate rapidly. Seek specialist help. Near term, induction of labour is usually the therapy of choice,
whereas a trial of stabilizing, or expectant, treatment may be more appropriate if the pregnancy is at an earlier stage.
Maternal risk factors for pre-eclampsia
• High risk: hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy, CKD,
diabetes, thrombophilia, or relevant autoimmune disease (e.g. SLE or
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome).
• Moderate risk: ﬁrst pregnancy, age >40 years, pregnancy interval of
≥10 years, BMI >35, +ve family history, twin or multiple pregnancy.
Prevention
• 5 with one high-risk factor or two or more moderate risk factors
should take aspirin 75mg od after 12 weeks’ gestation (reduces risk
by 715%).
• X Calcium supplementation may have a role in preventing serious
adverse events, such as fetal death, associated with pre-eclampsia in
populations with a low calcium intake (<600mg/day).

Diagnosis
• New onset i BP (SBP >140 or DBP >90mmHg), presenting after 20
weeks’ gestation, with signiﬁcant proteinuria (generally >300mg/24h;
equivalent to uPCR >30mg/mmol).
• 2 Classiﬁed as severe when there is signiﬁcant i BP (≥160/110mmHg)
9 symptoms 9 biochemical or haematological derangement.

Symptoms
2 An explanation of the potential symptoms of pre-eclampsia should be
given to all women at risk.
Advise them to seek immediate medical attention if they develop:
• Severe headaches.
• Visual disturbances (e.g. blurred vision, ﬂashing lights, double vision,
ﬂoating spots).
• New epigastric pain (or pain in the right upper quadrant).
• Vomiting.
• Breathlessness.
• Sudden swelling of the hands, feet, or face (1 although oedema
is a feature of pre-eclampsia, it also occurs in 60% of normal
pregnancies).

PRE-ECLAMPSIA: MANAGEMENT

Management
3 Admit to hospital, and undertake fetal monitoring. BP reduction is not
the sole endpoint of management—additional assessments of maternal
and fetal well-being are equally important.

Fetal assessment
• USS for fetal growth, amniotic ﬂuid volume assessment, and
umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry.
• Fetal cardiotocography should be performed if there is any change
in maternal condition (e.g. decrease in fetal movements, vaginal
bleeding, or abdominal pain).
• Mild hypertension (BP 140/90–149/99mmHg):
• Do not treat i BP.
• Measure BP at least 4x/day.
• SCr, U&E, LFTs, and FBC x2/week.
• Moderate hypertension (BP 150/100–159/109mmHg):
• Treat to keep BP <150/80–100mmHg (ﬁrst-line agent: labetalol,
b p. 849).
• Measure BP at least 4x/day.
• SCr, U&E, LFTs, and FBC x2/week.
• Severe hypertension (BP ≥160/110mmHg):
• Consider admission to high dependency environment.
• Treat to keep BP <150/80–100mmHg (ﬁrst-line agent: labetalol).
• Measure BP at least 4x per day.
• SCr, U&E, LFTs, and FBC at least x3/week.
Delivery
• Before 34 weeks: the decision to deliver can be very difﬁcult. The
rationale for delay is to improve neonatal outcome through delivery
of a more mature fetus. It also affords the opportunity to administer
corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity. However, it risks
worsening organ damage in the mother. Delivery is generally
recommended if any of the indications shown in Table 11.3 are present.
• After 34 weeks: delivery is generally recommended once BP has been
controlled and a course of corticosteroids administered, depending on
maternal and fetal condition. After 37 weeks, delivery within 24–48h is
advocated. The choice between Cesarean or vaginal birth will need to
be determined in each individual case.

Severe pre-eclampsia
3 Characterized by severe i BP (≥160/110mmHg) 9 symptoms
9 biochemical or haematological derangement.
• 2 Features:
• Severe i BP and proteinuria (can be heavy).
• Mild to moderate i BP with one of: severe headache, visual
disturbance, vomiting, epigastric or hypochondrial pain, liver
tenderness, papilloedema, clonus, HELLP, platelet count <100 x
109/L, abnormal LFTs.
• 2 Transfer to critical care if: eclampsia, HELLP, haemorrhage, AKI,
electrolyte disturbances, coagulopathy, unstable or refractory i BP
(including need for parenteral therapy), cardiac failure, or abnormal
neurology.
• Continuous BP monitoring. Consider invasive monitoring.
• Careful ﬂuid management:
• Chart input/output. Catheterize, and monitor UO.
• Limit maintenance ﬂuids to 80mL/h, unless there are ongoing ﬂuid
losses (e.g. bleeding).
• Avoid volume expansion, unless hydralazine is used as
antihypertensive therapy (b see below).
BP management
• 2 Consult local guidelines.
• Aim to keep BP <150/80–100mmHg.
• Monitor maternal and fetal response, in addition to BP response.
• Continue antenatal antihypertensive therapy.
• If parenteral therapy is required:
• Labetalol 20mg IV (1 contraindications: asthma, heart block);
double the dose at 10min intervals to maximum cumulative dose of
200mg (or continuous infusion of 1–2mg/min).
• If inadequate response, give hydralazine 5mg IV, repeated every
15min, to a maximum cumulative dose of 20mg (or continuous
infusion 0.5–10mg/h). Consider administration of 500mL crystalloid
before, or at the same time as, the ﬁrst dose of hydralazine.
Anticonvulsants
• Give IV magnesium sulfate (superior to phenytoin and
benzodiazepines) if a mother with severe i BP or severe pre-eclampsia
has a seizure (or has previously had an eclamptic seizure).
• Consider magnesium sulfate if delivery is planned within 24h in those
with severe pre-eclampsia.
• Regimen:
• Loading dose of 4g IV over 5min.
• Further dose of 2–4g over 5min if recurrent seizures.
• Follow with an infusion of 1g/h for 24h.
• Monitor UO, respiratory rate, O2 saturation, and reﬂexes. Measure
serum magnesium level if toxicity is suspected (treatment for
toxicity is 10% calcium gluconate).

PRE-ECLAMPSIA: MANAGEMENT

Pre-eclampsia: follow-up and prognosis
Follow-up
• Do not discharge until all symptoms of pre-eclampsia have
resolved, BP is <149/99mmHg, and biochemical and haematological
parameters are improving.
• Post-discharge, measure BP every 1–2 days for 2 weeks.
• Those with persistent i BP should be referred for specialist advice.
• Aim to keep BP <140/90mmHg. Reduce treatment if <130/80mmHg.
• If methyldopa has been used antenatally, withdrawal is
recommended post-partum (1 risk of depression). The choice of
alternative antihypertensive therapy, if required, will need to reﬂect
the mother's desire to breastfeed.
• Repeat blood tests, as clinically indicated.
• If proteinuria persists at 3 months, seek nephrology advice.
• Women should be advised to keep their BMI in the healthy range
prior to future pregnancies.

Prognosis
Women with pre-eclampsia have:
• An increased risk of gestational hypertension in future pregnancies
(13–53%).
• An increased risk of pre-eclampsia in future pregnancies (16–25%)
(1 >50% if pre-eclampsia led to delivery before 28 weeks).
• An increased risk of developing i BP and CV disease in later life.
• An increased relative risk of CKD and ESRD (even if normotensive
with no proteinuria at post-natal review), although this risk is low.

HELLP syndrome
• Refers to a syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low
platelet count.
• Occurs in 0.1–0.2% pregnancies.
• Probably represents a severe form of pre-eclampsia.
• 15–20% of patients do not have i BP or proteinuria.
• Often presents with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and malaise.
• About 70% of cases develop prior to delivery (usually 27–37 weeks)
and most of the remainder within 48 hours of delivery.
• The Martin/Mississippi classiﬁcation grades severity as class I (most
severe) to III, based on nadir platelet count, LDH, and liver function.
This helps estimate the maternal morbidity risk (intracerebral
haemorrhage is the principal cause of death).
• Management is similar to pre-eclampsia. X In addition,
corticosteroids (dexamethasone, betamethasone, or prednisolone)
are commonly used to increase platelet counts, although it remains
unclear if this strategy improves overall outcomes.

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Pre-existing renal disease
Introduction
The ability to conceive falls with d GFR. 2 However, once pregnant, the
key determinant of pregnancy outcome in women with pre-existing renal
disease is the degree of renal impairment.
Other factors that inﬂuence outcome include:
• Hypertension.
• Degree of proteinuria.
• Type of renal disease.
Obstetric complications include miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, and low birthweight. Pregnancy can also result in a deterioration in
renal function (see Table 11.4). This may be permanent and associated
with progression to end-stage kidney disease.
1 Even with normal renal function, normal BP, and non-signiﬁcant proteinuria, women with a history of renal disease have an increased risk
of pre-eclampsia (710%, compared to a background rate of 3–5% in the
general population).

General rules
The following are helpful to remember when counselling women with
renal disease that:
• Pre-pregnancy SCr <200μmol/L: (2.25mg/dL) although there is an
increased risk of complications (see Table 11.4), the chances of a
successful outcome and healthy baby are relatively good.
• Pre-pregnancy SCr >250μmol/L: (2.8mg/dL) high risk of a poor
fetal outcome (including prematurity and signiﬁcant developmental
problems), together with a high risk of developing ESRD during (or
soon after) pregnancy.
• The presence and degree of maternal i BP and proteinuria are also
important considerations.

PRE-EXISTING RENAL DISEASE

Speciﬁc renal diseases
Diabetic nephropathy
Now the commonest renal condition encountered in pregnancy. It is
essential that women with diabetes are educated about the importance of
good pre-conception diabetic control for reducing the risk of congenital
malformation (aim HbA1C ≤6.1% (43mmol/mol)). There is an increased
incidence of babies of higher birthweight. Otherwise, risks relate to both
the degree of renal impairment and the degree of proteinuria, as shown
in Table 11.4.
Reﬂux nephropathy
Women with reﬂux nephropathy should be screened for UTI during pregnancy, and, if present, infection should be treated promptly. Acute pyelonephritis is more common. Mothers should also be counselled regarding
the potential risk of inheritance (725–30%) and offered post-natal screening for their children (b p. 712).
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
Cyst complications in pregnancy, such as haemorrhage or infection, may
masquerade as obstetric complications. Patients with a family history of
intracranial aneurysms should ideally be screened for aneurysms themselves prior to pregnancy.
Primary glomerular disease
The exact type of glomerular disease does not impact on pregnancy outcome, but renal impairment, proteinuria, and maternal i BP all can.
Relapse of a stable pre-existing glomerular lesion is generally unlikely
(and usually very difﬁcult to differentiate from pre-eclampsia when it
occurs) (b p. 859). Wait until disease is in remission (ideally >6 months)
before trying to conceive. The form of treatment is also a consideration.
If relevant, wait until off cytotoxic agents and on lowest possible effective doses of corticosteroids. For other immunosuppressant drugs, see
b p. 866.
Proteinuria is likely to double during pregnancy. If >3g/24h (PCR >300mg/
mmol), then anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
should be recommended, as there is an increased thrombotic risk.
In addition, signiﬁcant proteinuria (>3g/day) is associated with 7x2
increased risk of perinatal loss and preterm delivery, compared to no
proteinuria.

Lupus nephritis
Renal impairment, proteinuria, and maternal i BP can all impact on pregnancy outcome. The risk of a disease ﬂare increases in pregnancy (30%).
Active lupus is associated with increased fetal loss, prematurity, and
IUGR. In addition, there is a risk of a transient rash and fetal heart block
(requiring pacing) in babies born to anti-Ro positive mothers. Those with
antiphospholipid antibodies are at increased risk of spontaneous abortion
and should be considered for LMWH from conception.

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Management of renal disease in pregnancy
• Requires a multidisciplinary approach, including an obstetrician, a
nephrologist, and, ideally, an obstetric physician.
• Pre-pregnancy counselling (including genetic counselling, if relevant) is
extremely important.
• Folic acid 400 micrograms od 3 months before trying to conceive.
• Alter medications, including antihypertensives, to drugs that are safe in
pregnancy (b p. 849).
• Recommend aspirin 75mg, particularly from 12 weeks onwards, to
reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.
• Patients should be booked early to antenatal clinic.
• Aim to see every 2–3 weeks until 28th week, thereafter weekly.
• BP every visit. Home BP monitoring may be helpful.
• Urinalysis every visit (MSU for M,C+S in those at particular risk of
infection).
• SCr, U&E, Ca2+, LFT, urate, and uPCR or uACR every 2–4 weeks.
• FBC every 4 weeks (IV iron and ESAs are safe).
• If proteinuria >3g/24h (uPCR >300mg/mmol), then anticoagulation
with LMWH should be considered.
• Monitor disease activity, where possible, e.g. SLE.
• Serial obstetric scans for those at higher risk (b p. 853).

PRE-EXISTING RENAL DISEASE

Case study
A 27-year-old primigravid Chinese woman presents to antenatal clinic
at 18 weeks’ gestation with progressive oedema. She is found to be normotensive, but urinalysis reveals 3+ proteinuria. Her SCr is 54μmol/L
(0.6mg/dL), uPCR 524mg/mmol, and serum albumin 26g/L.
Further investigations included: low C3 and C4, +ve ANA, +ve
dsDNA, and +ve antiphospholipid antibody. Renal USS was normal.
After discussion, a renal biopsy was undertaken and revealed class V
lupus nephritis (b p. 659).

Treatment options
Lupus nephritis (b p. 658) can be treated with corticosteroids.
Azathioprine is also safe in pregnancy, as is tacrolimus (b p. 866).
However, MMF (b p. 866) and cyclophosphamide are contraindicated. Rituximab may also be considered (X) but ideally not in the last
6 months of pregnancy so that fetal B cells have time to reconstitute
prior to delivery. This patient should also be offered LMWH treatment
in view of her proteinuria and antiphospholipid antibody status. If possible, diuretics should be avoided despite her oedema (b p. 849).

Learning point
If new-onset proteinuria (9 renal impairment) occurs in early pregnancy
(<20 weeks), it is important to attempt to diagnose the underlying renal
lesion. Investigation will include immunological and serological testing (b p. 40) and potentially a renal biopsy. A histological diagnosis is
likely to assist management in later pregnancy easier, as differentiating
primary renal disease from pre-eclampsia becomes very difﬁcult (see
Table 11.5).

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Disorders of the urinary tract
in pregnancy
Changes to the anatomy of the renal tract during pregnancy, particularly
dilatation of the collecting system (b p. 840), need to be considered during the assessment of urinary tract symptoms and signs.

Haematuria
In the absence of proteinuria, haematuria is usually due to anatomical changes (bleeding from small venules in dilated collecting systems).
On microscopy, 2–3 RBC/hpf is normal in pregnancy (unlike 1–2 in the
non-pregnant population). If SCr is normal and no proteinuria, wait until
12 weeks after delivery for further assessment (b p. 66).

Obstruction
May occur s to mechanical pressure exerted by the uterus (usually on the
right ureter, often where the ureter crosses the iliac artery) or s to pelvic
or ureteric stone impaction.

Renal stones
Renal stones are uncommon in pregnancy and usually occur in women
known to have pre-existing nephrolithiasis. However, collecting system
dilatation, coupled with stasis and a 2–3-fold increase in urinary calcium
excretion, may precipitate new stone formation in pregnancy. Ureteric
stones are more common than stones in the renal pelvis, and most
occur after the ﬁrst trimester. The majority will pass spontaneously, but
impacted stones may remain painful, and s urinary infection is a concern.
Women with cystinuria should be offered genetic counselling prior to
conception, and proactive management of their stone disease should start
pre-pregnancy (b p. 719).
1 The differential diagnosis of stone-induced colic must include obstetric
problems, such as placental abruption
Investigation
Urine dipstick for haematuria and proteinuria. Microscopy: red cells (+
morphology), casts, pus cells, and organisms. Urine culture 9 stone analysis. FBC, U&E, serum calcium, PTH.
USS is the ﬁrst-line imaging modality. Ideally, ionizing radiation should
be avoided during the 1st and 2nd trimesters. A limited IVU with fetal
shielding is recommended in complex cases. Ureteroscopy may be preferred to CT or multiple irradiations. MRI has limited utility.
Management
Hydration and analgesia (775% stones will pass spontaneously). Obstruction,
intractable pain, and urosepsis are indications for more deﬁnitive intervention. Standard treatment consists of nephrostomy placement and ureteric
stent insertion (then changed at intervals until after delivery), but ureteroscopic methods are increasingly favoured. Extracorporeal shockwave
lithotripsy should be avoided.

DISORDERS OF THE URINARY TRACT IN PREGNANCY

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Pregnancy on dialysis
Introduction
5 with ESRD rarely fall pregnant on dialysis: only 0.3–2.2% will conceive
(reasons are complex, including hyperprolactinaemia, anaemia, polypharmacy, psychosocial issues, and the uraemic state per se). Nevertheless,
contraception should be discussed with women who menstruate on dialysis (740%). This is particularly true in the ﬁrst few years after commencing
dialysis.
B-HCG levels are high in dialysis patients, so if the level is high and
pregnancy is a possibility, an USS should be performed.
If a pregnancy occurs and progresses beyond the 1st trimester, fetal
outcomes have previously been poor and associated with signiﬁcant
maternal morbidity. However, better maternal and fetal care, coupled
with improvements in dialysis efﬁciency and increases in dialysis frequency,
have led to more optimism around pregnancy on dialysis.
In general, however, transplantation, if feasible, remains the favoured
means for a patient with ESRD to conceive and undertake a pregnancy
(b p. 864).

What dialysis patients of childbearing age
should know
• 13–45% of pregnancies result in spontaneous miscarriage before
20 weeks’ gestation.
• The outcomes of pregnancy on dialysis are improving. Available data
suggest 23% of pregnancies resulted in a live infant in 1980, whilst
this is now in excess of 70%.
• Maternal morbidity (e.g. hospitalization) remains signiﬁcant, but
mortality is rare.
• Maternal hypertension is very common.
• Preterm birth (70–100%, mean gestational age 32 weeks) and low
birthweight (virtually 100%) are extremely common.
• Long-term outcomes for these infants are not yet known.
• Prolonged admissions to neonatal intensive care are common.
• Congenital abnormalities occur with the same frequency as in the
general population.
• Pregnancy on dialysis is physically and emotionally demanding.
• Patients should be encouraged to dialyse as much as possible,
preferably daily for long hours.
• It is worth re-exploring options for transplantation.

Dialysis prescription
There is no overriding reason for a modality switch: HD delivers a higher
dialysis dose, but CAPD (esp. APD) offers less rapid metabolic changes
and allows steady ﬂuid removal whilst avoiding intradialytic hypotension.
Residual renal function is important, as it improves pregnancy outcomes.

PREGNANCY ON DIALYSIS

Haemodialysis
Aim for urea consistently ≤15mmol/L (~40mg/dL) through daily dialysis
for at least 20h/week) (76 treatments). Titrate dialysate K+, Ca2+, and
HCO3– against serum levels (may require reduction in dialysate HCO3–
to prevent maternal alkalaemia). Heparin requirements may increase. 1
Avoid hypotension. Allow for additional 0.5kg/week weight gains from
mid-pregnancy onwards.
Peritoneal dialysis
As pregnancy progresses and intra-abdominal PD ﬂuid volume is less
well-tolerated and automated PD, with more frequent lower volume exchanges, is preferable. PD-related peritonitis should be treated
promptly and assiduously, bearing in mind the potential teratogenicity of
many antibiotics.
Diet, calcium, and vitamin D
Involve your dietetic staff from the outset. i protein intake to 1.2–1.4g/
kg pre-pregnant weight + 10g per day. For CAPD, take dialysate protein
losses into account and replace. Offer a daily multivitamin preparation,
containing water-soluble vitamins. Increase folate to 1.6mg/day. The placenta produces calcitriol, so vitamin D analogue doses may require adjustment. Supplemental K+ may be necessary.
Anaemia
Erythropoietin is not teratogenic. Dose requirements will increase by
50–100% in pregnancy. IV iron is safe and effective.

Labour and delivery
• Most units will deliver pregnant dialysis patients early (usually
prompted by worsening i BP, IUGR, or both). Pregnancies rarely
progress beyond 38 weeks.
• Monitoring of uterine activity should begin as early as the 26th week,
as dialysis may induce contractions.
• Cesarean section is performed for standard obstetric indications.
• PD patients should be drained out for delivery—dialysis can resume
24h after delivery, with small-volume exchanges. Temporary HD may
be necessary for a period in cases of PD ﬂuid leakage.
• Assess ﬂuid status carefully: 1 avoid volume overload.
• Beware infection.
• Neonates will need specialist input, including regular electrolyte
assessment.

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Pregnancy after renal
transplantation: introduction
Improvement in renal function following successful transplantation,
usually restores menstruation and fertility. Post-transplantation, 12% of
women of childbearing age will become pregnant.
Advice regarding contraception should 6 be accessible (key points: avoid
oestrogen-containing contraceptives, as they can i BP and they also have
an unpredictable effect on CNI metabolism. Progesterone-only preparations and IUCDs are safe and more effective than barrier methods).
All renal transplant recipients contemplating pregnancy should be
offered appropriate pre-pregnancy counselling (this may include genetic
counselling, depending on underlying renal disease).

Outcomes
A number of international registries have recorded the outcomes of pregnancy in renal transplant patients around the world. A recent meta-analysis
of available data from 4,706 pregnancies in 3,570 transplant recipients
reported a live birth and miscarriage rate of 73% and 14%, respectively.
Both these ﬁgures are similar to those seen in the general population.
In 5 with good graft function, >95% pregnancies that progress beyond
12 weeks are likely to have a successful outcome.

Complications
The key renal factors that affect the incidence of complications are:
• SCr pre-conception.
• i BP.
• Degree of proteinuria.
Important complications (the incidence range reﬂects the presence and
severity of the above factors) include:
• i BP (30–60%):
• 750% of 5 transplant recipients are taking antihypertensive drugs.
• i BP is associated with premature birth and pre-eclampsia.
• For safe antihypertensive medications, see b p. 849.
• Pre-eclampsia (22–45%).
• IUGR (20–40%).
• Preterm delivery (20–60%), with associated low birthweight.
• Gestational diabetes (78%).
There is also an increased incidence of UTI (740%) (and graft pyelonephritis) during pregnancy.
Cesarean section rates are increased, reﬂecting the complex nature of
the pregnancies, rather than presence of the transplant itself (which lies
in the false pelvis).
There is no increase in incidence of congenital abnormalities above that
in the general population. The incidence of longer-term developmental
delay is also probably low.

Reproduced from Nicholas Torpey et al. (Oxford Specialist Handbook) Renal Transplantation
(2010), with permission from Oxford University Press.

Pre-pregnancy transplant function predicts the risk of graft dysfunction
both during and after pregnancy. For 5 with good graft function (SCr
≤125μmol/L (1.4mg/dL)), the risk of deterioration in function due to pregnancy is low. For those with poor function (SCr >160μmol/L (1.8mg/dL)),
renal function post-pregnancy is likely to be worse than pre-, and there is
a signiﬁcant incidence of premature graft loss.

Rejection
The risk of allograft rejection does not appear to be increased during
pregnancy, with a reported rate of 74%. However, when it occurs, it is
associated with poorer outcomes.
Risk factors: shorter interval between transplantation and pregnancy,
low CNI levels.
1 Pregnancy enhances CNI metabolism. Diligent therapeutic monitoring
is necessary, often with signiﬁcant dose increases.
The cause of graft dysfunction (b p. 404) can be difﬁcult to diagnose
in pregnancy. Transplant biopsies are often required and are safe in
expert hands.

CHAPTER 11

Pregnancy and the kidney

Pregnancy after renal
transplantation: management
Transplant drugs during pregnancy
In the transplant setting, there is no other choice but to expose the fetus
to immunosuppressive agents, as all the relevant drugs pass through to
the fetal circulation to some degree. Reassuringly, however, the incidence
of major congenital malformations does not appear different from the
non-transplant population. 1 There are speciﬁc concerns regarding the
use of MMF in pregnancy, and there are too little data on sirolimus to currently recommend its use (see Table 11.7).
Table 11.7 Safety of common immune suppressant agents in
pregnancy
Immunosuppression
Safe
Ciclosporin
Tacrolimus

Unsafe
Mycophenolate
Sirolimus (limited data)

Mycophenolate has been shown to cause a speciﬁc pattern of malformation
in 20–25% of cases (hypoplastic nails, shortened ﬁfth ﬁnger, ear defects,
including deafness and cleft palate).
*

Neonates should be monitored for adrenal suppression.

1 Pregnancy enhances the metabolism of CNIs. Careful therapeutic monitoring is essential, and signiﬁcant dose adjustments are often required.
X Breastfeeding is not generally advocated on maintenance immunosuppression, but many authorities do not believe it is absolutely
contraindicated.
3 Also unsafe in pregnancy: valganciclovir, co-trimoxazole, statins, ﬂuconazole, and other -azole antifungal drugs.

Pre-pregnancy and antenatal care
• Optimize BP management (aim <140/90mmHg).
• Optimize immune suppression (prior to conception).
• Folic acid 400 micrograms od (to prevent neural tube defects), and
consider aspirin 75mg od (to reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia).
• Hepatitis B and C, HSV (cervical cultures if +ve), CMV, HIV,
toxoplasmosis, and rubella status, if not already known.
• Rubella antibodies should ideally be tested prior to transplantation
(rubella is a live vaccine, so administration is contraindicated
post-transplantation).
• Rhesus compatibility of the patient and transplant: if the patient is Rh
–ve and the kidney Rh +ve, there is a theoretical risk the patient could
be sensitized to Rh, which could prove problematic for a Rh +ve baby.

PREGNANCY AFTER RENAL TRANSPLANTATION: MANAGEMENT

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Antenatal clinic visit every 2–3 weeks. Weekly after 28 weeks.
BP check every visit. Home BP monitoring may be helpful.
Urinalysis and MSU for M,C+S every visit.
If proteinuria >2g/24h (uPCR >200mg/mmol), then anticoagulation
with LMWH should be considered.
Check ciclosporin or tacrolimus levels frequently (every 2–4 weeks
and more frequently if dose adjustments).
Glucose tolerance test in each trimester.
Monitor for CMV viraemia monthly (risk of congenital infection).
SCr, U&E, Ca2+, LFT every 2–4 weeks.
FBC every 2–4 weeks (IV iron and ESAs are safe).

Delivery
• Vaginal delivery is safe. Caesarean section for obstetric indications.
• Perform all VEs with strict aseptic technique.
• Consider additional hydrocortisone 100mg IVI or IMI (or increase oral
prednisolone to 15mg od over labour).

Case study
A 35-year-old lady with ESRD secondary to membranous nephropathy
underwent a live related transplant from her husband 9 months ago.
At a visit to transplant clinic, she expresses her desire to try for pregnancy. She has had one episode of cellular rejection (Banff category 2A)
3 months previously, treated with pulsed corticosteroids.
Medications: tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisolone, enalapril,
amlodipine, simvastatin, alendronic acid.
Blood pressure: 140/80mmHg. SCr presently stable at 130–140μmol/L.

What advice would you give her about pregnancy, and what
changes to her medications would you suggest?
Recommendations
• Offer appropriate detailed counselling and planning, ideally in a
multidisciplinary obstetric-renal clinic.
• Wait for 1 year post-transplantation (some advocate 18–24 months)
and, preferably, 6 months after an episode of rejection.
• Ensure stable graft function, and document degree of any
proteinuria.
• Immune suppression: needs to be stable. This patient should be
changed to azathioprine under careful supervision and monitored for
3 months.
• Stop ACE-I (monitor BP, and consider safe alternative), statin, and
bisphosphonate.
• Start folic acid at least 3 months prior to conception to reduce the
risk of neural tube defects.
• Consider aspirin 75mg od once pregnant (particularly after 12
weeks) to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.
• Assess thromboembolic risk (particularly if proteinuria).
• Give advice regarding appropriate contraception until safe to
conceive.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Prescribing in renal impairment
3 Always verify the recommended dose and dosing schedule when prescribing for a patient with renal impairment. Ask yourself, ‘Is the drug still
warranted, given the potential increased risk?’.

Principles
• The kidneys have a fundamental role in the elimination of drugs, even
those partially metabolized in the liver.
• Renal elimination may be either by glomerular ﬁltration or tubular
secretion.
• Renal impairment may necessitate a dose reduction, an extension in
the dosing interval, or a combination of both.
• Such alterations will depend on the degree of renal dysfunction (or
form of renal replacement therapy).
• Impaired renal function is common in elderly patients and those with
multiple comorbidities, so the potential effects of polypharmacy and
drug interactions are particularly relevant in these groups.
• Individuals who have been taking a drug at the same dose over a long
period may need a dose alteration, as renal function changes with time.
• In practice, particular care is needed when using those drugs where:
• There is a narrow therapeutic index, i.e. the toxic and therapeutic
ranges overlap or are close to each other (e.g. digoxin, aciclovir).
• Renal toxicity is a potential effect of the drug.  Beware the
vicious cycle of worsening renal function, decreasing drug clearance,
and rising drug levels (e.g. aminoglycosides).
•  The consequences of accumulation are serious (e.g. metformin,
opiates).
• The monitoring of therapeutic drug levels may be helpful in these
situations.
• If there is a relatively wide therapeutic window, it may be possible to
use a drug safely with a simple dose reduction (e.g. half the ‘standard
dose’). This is the case with many antibiotics.  However, never
estimate—always conﬁrm the appropriate dosing schedule.

Pharmacodynamics
Renal impairment may alter the sensitivity of target tissue to the effects
of drugs. Examples: higher incidence of statin-induced myopathy, more
pronounced effect of antiplatelet drugs, increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines, and increased risk of hyperkalaemia with potassium-sparing
diuretics.

Pharmacokinetics
Renal impairment inﬂuences the pharmacokinetics of most drugs to some
degree. Understanding why can help select drugs, doses, and dosing intervals that achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations but avoiding toxicity.
Absorption. Describes the passage of drug from site of administration
into the plasma volume. Renal impairment may affect oral administration
and enteral absorption via alterations in:

PRESCRIBING IN RENAL IMPAIRMENT

• Gastric pH:
• Passive drug transfer across intestinal epithelial barriers is
dependent on ionization. i gastric pH ld ionization ld absorption
(e.g. ferrous sulphate, ketoconazole, itraconazole).
• i gastric pH may be s to drugs (phosphate binders, H2 antagonists,
and proton pump inhibitors) as well as the excess urea hydrolysis
to ammonia (to buffer HCl) present in renal failure.
• Gastric motility:
• Gastric emptying can be delayed in uraemia (and diabetes mellitus).
• Vomiting.
• Drug–drug interaction:
• Interaction in the GI tract l altered bioavailability (e.g. phosphate
binders and ferrous sulphate should not be taken together).
• Grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4 isoform of the cytochrome
P450 enzyme in liver and gut ld ﬁrst-pass metabolism of many
drugs, including dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and
ciclosporin.
• GI tract oedema:
• Nephrotic syndrome and CCF ld loop diuretic absorption.
Distribution. Measures the (theoretical) volume (Vd) occupied by the total
amount (Q) of drug, assuming uniform concentration (Cp) in all body compartments (Vd = Q / Cp). Several parameters are subject to change in renal
insufﬁciency.
• Protein binding:
• Changes in albumin concentration will affect the free (and 6 active)
concentration of highly protein-bound drugs.
• Nephrotic syndrome l hypoalbuminaemia ld albumin binding li
free drug.
• Competitive binding of acidic uraemic toxins to albumin will also
increase free drug.
• Example: phenytoin is less protein-bound in renal failure, and signs
of toxicity may occur at ‘therapeutic’ levels. ( Many assays used
for therapeutic monitoring will not reﬂect this, as they measure
total drug.) Warfarin and diazepam may also be affected. 2 Be
cautious with dose adjustments.
• Altered body composition:
• Impaired renal function is associated with signiﬁcant changes in
body water, muscle, and adipose tissue.
• Fluid overload will increase Vd for protein-bound and water-soluble
drugs (e.g. atenolol, vancomycin).
• Reduced muscle and adipose tissue may affect Vd for hydrophilic
drugs (e.g. statins, morphine, codeine).
• Altered drug tissue binding:
• Uraemia reduces tissue binding. Digoxin is the most clinically
relevant, with a signiﬁcant reduction in Vd.
Metabolism. Two important examples of the kidney’s involvement in
drug metabolism are: (i) activation of vitamin D compounds through
1A-hydroxylation; (ii) metabolism of insulin— insulin requirements
often decrease signiﬁcantly as renal failure progresses.

871

872

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Clearance
Clearance depends on glomerular ﬁltration, tubular secretion, and tubular
reabsorption.
Clearance=(FFunbound × GFR)+Secretion − Reabsorption
where Funbound is the fraction of unbound drug in the plasma.
Some drugs are eliminated unchanged by the kidney and are 6 particularly
susceptible to accumulation in renal failure. A more common scenario is
that drugs are cleared via conversion to water-soluble (polar) metabolites
prior to urinary excretion.
This initial breakdown to inactive, more polar metabolites usually occurs
in the liver via conjugation (to glucuronide or sulphate) or oxidation/
reduction.
In general, as GFR falls, drug elimination by all the following mechanisms
is reduced.
• Glomerular ﬁltration. Smaller molecules (MW <60,000) are ﬁltered at
the glomerulus unless protein-bound. Water-soluble (polar) molecules
are more freely ﬁltered than lipid-soluble (non-polar) ones.
• Tubular secretion. Non-polar drugs diffuse more readily across tubular
membranes. In addition, many polar drugs undergo active excretion by
the same mechanisms as organic acids and bases.
• Organic acids: penicillins, cephalosporins, salicylates, loop and
thiazide diuretics.
• Organic bases: amiloride, quinidine, procainamide.
• Acidic drugs are more effectively secreted into alkaline urine
and vice versa. This can be exploited therapeutically, e.g. urinary
alkalinization in salicylate poisoning.
• Tubular reabsorption of non-polar drugs may be signiﬁcant.

First-order kinetics
• Most drugs excreted by the kidneys exhibit ﬁrst-order kinetics, i.e. the
rate of elimination is proportional to the concentration of the drug.
• Drugs that demonstrate such kinetics can be described by their half-life
(t1/2). This is the time taken for the drug concentration to halve after
absorption and distribution.
• t1/2 determines steady state concentration, appropriate dosing interval,
and persistence after cessation of treatment.
• The majority of drugs are given at regular intervals and reach steady
state after 75 x t1/2 when rate of intake equals rate of excretion.
• Increases in dose or dose frequency result in a higher steady state
concentration.
• t1/2 will itself depend on GFR for drugs excreted by the kidney.
• dGFR ldclearance rate lit1/2l accumulation and increased steady
state drug concentration.
• This necessitates either a d in dose or i in dose interval.
• Dose reductions l lower peak concentrations but maintained
trough levels (ideal when constant exposure required, e.g. many
antibiotics, antihypertensives).

PRESCRIBING IN RENAL IMPAIRMENT

• Increased dose intervals l maintain peak concentrations but
permit lower trough levels (e.g. aminoglycosides—high peak
concentrations are required for bactericidal activity; low troughs
avoid toxicity).

Drugs and the kidney

Assessing kidney function prior to prescribing
• The most important measure is GFR, not serum creatinine.
• A formal creatinine clearance is ideal but cumbersome (requires 24h
urine collection) and 6 rarely performed.
•  MDRD eGFR was never intended to guide drug dosing.
In particular, it may lead to overdosing of small patients and
underdosing of large ones.
• Cockcroft–Gault estimation of CrCl incorporates body weight and is
better suited to this purpose.
• 2 GFR may be rapidly changing, particularly in AKI or a critical care
setting. This makes drug selection and dosing a key component of
management that requires constant attention and review.
• If in any doubt, discuss with a renal pharmacist—they are an
invaluable resource on all specialist units.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Prescribing for dialysis patients
Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) will normally have an insigniﬁcant ‘native’ GFR, and the removal of drugs usually dependent on renal
excretion will 6 be negligible. 2 It is vital to know whether such drugs will
be removed by dialysis.
Drug clearance will vary, according to modality of dialysis. Clearance
by haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis is contingent on diffusion down
a concentration gradient between plasma and dialysate. Clearance during
haemoﬁltration is reliant on convection alone.
Two important factors that may inﬂuence drug removal require consideration when prescribing for patients on RRT:
• Characteristics of the drug.
• Characteristics of the type of RRT.

Drug characteristics
• Molecular weight (MW):
• Haemodialysis membranes have relatively small pore sizes and
will only clear molecules <500Da.
• Haemoﬁlters have larger pore sizes and can clear much larger
molecules <5,000Da.
• Protein binding:
• Heavily protein-bound drugs are not well removed (even if
low MW).
• Volume of distribution:
• Large volumes of distribution result in low plasma drug
concentrations and reduced availability for removal by dialysis.
• Water solubility:
• Water-soluble drugs pass through ﬁlters more readily than
lipid-soluble ones.
• For patients receiving RRT, GFR cannot be calculated using standard
equations.
• Even though clearance may be higher during treatment, dosing at CrCl
<10mL/min is common for haemodialysis, as the treatment is generally
intermittent.
• Clearance is higher in continuous techniques, such as continuous
veno-venous haemoﬁltration (CVVHF) or continuous veno-venous
haemodiaﬁltration (CVVHDF) where clearances can be in the range
30–40mL/min. This allows larger doses to be prescribed.
• Generally, the manufacturer of machines and dialysers/ﬁlters will
provide an estimate of CrCl by their system.
• Drugs will have a sieving coefﬁcient that indicates the proportion of
drug that will pass through a membrane during treatment. A drug that
passes freely has a sieving coefﬁcient of 1, and one does not pass at all
will have a coefﬁcient of 0.
• It is the knowledge of the system clearance and the drug-sieving
coefﬁcient that informs guidance for drug prescription.

PRESCRIBING FOR DIALYSIS PATIENTS

• There are several comprehensive resources, such as renal formularies,
that could, and should, be frequently consulted.
• Clinical decision support alerts within electronic prescribing systems
can help reduce errors.
• Specialist renal and critical care pharmacists are an invaluable source of
information and essential members of the relevant clinical teams.

RRT characteristics
• Properties of the dialyser or ﬁlter (pore size, surface area).
• Drug adsorption onto some membrane types.
• Duration of therapy, e.g. haemodialysis provides efﬁcient clearance
but is only an intermittent treatment. Peritoneal dialysis clears drugs
much less efﬁciently than either haemodialysis or haemoﬁltration but
is a continuous technique.
• Dialysate and blood ﬂow rates (determine concentration gradient).
• For peritoneal dialysis:
• Peritoneal membrane status, e.g. clearance increases during the
inﬂammation caused by peritonitis.
• Volume and frequency of exchanges.
• Drugs that are cleared by haemodialysis are usually administered
after a treatment session.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Sepsis and antimicrobials
3 Sepsis is a relatively common cause and complication of renal failure.
Presentations may be atypical and non-speciﬁc. Samples for culture
and sensitivity (including blood, urine, sputum, wound swabs, drain ﬂuids,
and any other relevant locations) should be obtained (preferably before
antibiotic administration) wherever possible. See Table 12.1 on choice
of antimicrobial treatment and Table 12.2 for antibacterial, antiviral, and
antifungal dosing

Antimicrobials
Choice of antibiotic
• History and examination may identify the most likely source of
infection and guide initial antibiotic selection. However, prompt
empirical treatment to cover all likely pathogens may be necessary in
deteriorating patients.
• 2 Local antibiotic policies, developed with microbiology and pharmacy
input, should be adhered to in all, but exceptional, circumstances.
• Prudent antibiotic prescribing can reduce hospital-related infections,
such as MRSA and C. difﬁcile, and help to prevent antibiotic resistance.
• Always record indication and intended antibiotic duration or
review date.
• IV antibiotics should be switched to oral equivalents after 48h if T <38*C
for 48h, patient is clinically improving, a suitable oral agent is available,
and there is no evidence of malabsorption, gastric stasis, or vomiting.
There are exceptions (e.g. PD peritonitis, endocarditis, meningitis)—
your microbiology team will advise.
• Numerous antimicrobials depend on renal clearance. However, most
have a wide therapeutic index, and dose reductions are only necessary
once GFR is <20mL/min ( aminoglycosides and vancomycin are
important exceptions).
• High doses of B-lactam antibiotics can accumulate and cause
neurological sequelae, including confusion, agitation, and seizures in
advanced CKD, including dialysis patients.
• Cephalosporins and quinolones require dose reductions in more
severe renal impairment (see Table 12.2).
• Vancomycin is extensively used for staphylococcal infections (including
dialysis line sepsis and PD-related peritonitis). Monitoring of drug
levels is essential (b p. 882).
• Aminoglycosides can be used with care (b p. 880).
Haemodialysis patients
Central vascular dialysis catheter infection or PTFE access graft sepsis
should always be considered (b p. 297). Even if a PTFE graft has previously been surgically removed, residual material may remain in situ.
2 Always consider immediate removal of any foreign body (particularly
dialysis lines). Do not wait for culture results. Empirical therapy often
involves vancomycin and gentamicin, which are dosed according to
trough drug levels (b p. 882). Unlike gentamicin (b p. 881), vancomycin

SEPSIS AND ANTIMICROBIALS

is not effectively removed by standard HD, so speed of clearance will
largely depend on residual renal function (if any). In practice, doses may
be days apart.
 Beware the complacency this can induce—it is crucial to proactively
measure and respond to drug levels if periods of inadequate antibiotic
activity are to be avoided.
In addition to aminoglycosides, penicillins (e.g. benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, and co-amoxiclav), meropenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciproﬂoxacin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, and trimethoprim are removed by HD
and should be given post-treatment. 3 Severe sepsis is an exception—
administer immediately.
Peritoneal dialysis patients (b p. 322)
In suspected PD peritonitis, perform an exchange, and send ﬂuid for
M,C+S. Peritonitis in overnight APD patients may be less easily diagnosed,
as the patient may not witness a cloudy bag. Also consider (and examine for) exit site or tunnel infections related to Tenckhoff catheters. 
Remember: other causes of peritonitis or an acute abdomen can, and do,
occur in peritoneal dialysis patients. All renal units will have a detailed
antibiotic policy for the treatment of PD-related peritonitis and exit site
infections. International guidance can be found at M http://www.ispd.org.
Post-transplantation (b p. 426)
Patients are susceptible to a wide variety of infectious pathogens at different stages post-transplantation. Atypical infections must always enter the
differential. Initial broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment is often necessary until investigations are completed and culture results available. Also
review the degree of immunosuppression, and consider a reduction. If
overwhelming sepsis, stop all immunosuppression, and replace with IV
steroid (e.g. hydrocortisone IV 50mg qds) until condition allows phased
reintroduction. 2 Discuss with transplant team ASAP.

Antivirals
Many antivirals, including aciclovir, ganciclovir, valganciclovir, famciclovir, and lamivudine, are dependent on renal clearance and will begin to
accumulate, even in relatively mild renal insufﬁciency (GFR <50mL/min).
Dose-related (and usually reversible) neurological toxicity is typical (l
dizziness, tremor, confusion, ataxia, hallucinations, drowsiness, encephalopathy, seizures). Bone marrow suppression is also possible. Ribavirin
and its metabolites rely on renal clearance, and their accumulation can
cause severe anaemia. The neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir undergoes hepatic breakdown to active metabolites, requiring subsequent
renal clearance. An increased dose interval is 6 recommended once GFR
<30mL/min. Many antivirals are removed freely by dialysis.

Antifungals
Unlike many other azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole), ﬂuconazole is renally excreted, so maintenance dosing requires adjustment
in moderate to severe CKD. It should also be administered after dialysis.
Fluconazole’s urinary excretion means that it is useful in the treatment of
fungal infections of the urinary tract.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Aminoglycosides
•  Aminoglycosides must always be used with caution in renal
impairment, as they undergo renal clearance, have a narrow
therapeutic window, and are nephrotoxic. A vicious cycle of rising drug
levels and worsening renal function can (and often does) result.
• Aminoglycosides are freely ﬁltered by the glomerulus (so dose is
adjusted according to GFR) and then partially taken up by tubular cells.
This can cause tubular cell injury (l ATN).
• 2 Several factors increase risk of both nephrotoxicity (and
ototoxicity): prolonged treatment, dehydration, concomitant diuretic
use, obstructive jaundice, hypokalaemia, and hypomagnesaemia.
• Dose adjustments aim to achieve peak plasma levels that are
bactericidal whilst permitting low trough levels that avoid toxicity.

SEPSIS AND ANTIMICROBIALS

 Gentamicin dosing
• Gentamicin does not enter fat, so obese patients should be dosed,
according to ideal body weight (IBW), calculated as follows:
• Adult ♂: IBW (in kg) = 50 + (2.3 x height in inches over 5 feet).
• Adult ♀: IBW (in kg) = 45.5 + (2.3 x height in inches over 5 feet).
• 2 Protocols will vary, so consult local policies, and discuss with
microbiology.
• GFR >20mL/min: usual ﬁrst dose for empirical treatment is 5mg/kg
(according to ideal body weight), with a maximum dose of 450mg.
• GFR <20mL/min in those who are not on dialysis treatment: usual
recommended dose is 3mg/kg, according to ideal body weight, with a
maximum of 280mg.
• Patients on HD or PD: usual recommended ﬁrst dose is 2mg/kg, with
a maximum dose of 180mg.
• Seek advice regarding subsequent doses.
• Serum levels are maintained in the therapeutic range for longer in
patients with d GFR, and the dosing interval may be every 2–5 days.
• A trough serum level, taken 20h post-dose, should be <1mg/L
(unless the patient is on HD) before repeat administration. Peak
level measurement is unnecessary in once daily dosing regimens.
• If the level is not <1mg/L, then repeat every 24h, and redose when
<1mg/L (and if there remains a clear indication for the drug).
• In HD patients, redose when pre-dialysis levels are <2mg/L.
Dialysis removes a signiﬁcant proportion of gentamicin—waiting
for pre-dialysis trough levels to fall to <1mg/L risks sub-therapeutic
periods.
• Gentamicin is generally administered at the end of HD and by
intraperitoneal administration in PD patients.
• Amikacin, netilmicin, and tobramycin have similar pharmacokinetics
and require similar management. Consult local policies.
• In HD and PD, the effect of aminoglycosides on residual ‘native’
renal function remains unpredictable, but the risk of sepsis outweighs
the risk of a fall in residual urine output. It is 6 the risk of ototoxicity
and devloping an irreversible balance disorder that is the paramount
concern in this situation.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Cardiovascular drugs
Introduction
 Cardiovascular disease is a signiﬁcant cause of morbidity and mortality
in patients with kidney disease (b p. 198). However, most of the large
practice-changing cardiology trials have speciﬁcally excluded patients with
renal impairment. This means that the robust evidence base developed for
many CV drugs in the general population is not necessarily transferable to
individuals with renal disease. X In fact, in certain situations, there may be
a risk of more harm than good.
2 Hypertension in dialysis patients is often driven by salt and water overload, with volume expansion. Discuss changes in an antihypertensive regimen with the patient’s renal team to avoid hypotensive episodes during
dialysis treatment.

Speciﬁc drug groups
Beta-blockers Atenolol is excreted by the kidneys and is removed by HD
(but not PD). It is still used widely in advanced CKD, but the dose is best
titrated to avoid the effects of accumulation (e.g. bradycardia). Similarly,
metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol should be titrated cautiously, according to clinical circumstances. The latter three are not removed by dialysis.
Calcium channel blockers, α-blockers, and nitrates Do not require
dose reduction, although caution around the precipitation of postural
hypotension should be exercised.
Aspirin Is prescribed in standard doses in CKD for primary and secondary
CV risk modiﬁcation, although bleeding risk is likely to increase as renal
dysfunction progresses. Use with caution when combined with other
antiplatelet agents. Consider gastric protection.
Clopidogrel Indications, beneﬁts, and ideal dose in more advanced CKD
are unknown. Most clinicians use as for non-renal patients, but caution is
required, as the risk of bleeding is likely to be increased.
Heparin LMWHs undergo renal clearance and accumulate in advanced CKD
(particularly GFR <30mL/min).  While the doses used for prophylaxis
against venous thromboembolism are generally well tolerated, larger
‘treatment’ doses have been associated with signiﬁcant, and serious, bleeding
complications. Monitoring of activated factor Xa levels has been advocated
but may not always be practical. While suggestions for dose modiﬁcation are
available for some LMWHs, unfractionated heparin may be preferred in many
situations. 2 It is vital that a local guideline is developed and adhered to. At
present, many patients with CKD do not receive, or receive inappropriate
doses of, anticoagulants in emergency situations, such as acute coronary
syndrome—even though CKD places them in a high-risk group.
Unfractionated heparin is usually commenced in standard dosage and
adjusted, according to APTT.
Fondaparinux is a factor Xa inhibitor that can be used at a reduced
dose in mild to moderate renal impairment but is best avoided in more
advanced CKD (GFR <30mL/min).

CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS

Oral anticoagulants Risk/beneﬁt assessment must be carefully undertaken
for many indications (such as prevention of dialysis access thrombosis or
prevention of thromboembolism in AF), particularly as CKD progresses.
 Individuals with CKD often require lower doses of warfarin, have
poorer control of anticoagulation, and are at increased risk of bleeding
complications. Anticoagulants may 6 need lower dosage at initiation and
closer monitoring. The risks (as well as uncertainties regarding beneﬁt)
increase in CKD stage 5 and 5D. There is much more experience with
warfarin than other oral anticoagulants, such as phenindione. However,
there is increasing recognition that warfarin therapy in CKD 5D may
signiﬁcantly contribute to ectopic vascular calciﬁcation.
Experience with the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is limited in
CKD. Patients with a CrCl <30mL/min were excluded from the RE-LY
study that deﬁned its utility in AF. While dose reductions have been suggested, it is best avoided if GFR <30mL/min and certainly if <15mL/min. Its
anticoagulant effect is more difﬁcult to reverse. It undergoes renal clearance and is also removed by dialysis (which has been proposed as a potential means of reversal in emergency situations).
Thrombolytics No dose reduction recommended, although the potential
for bleeding complications rises as CKD advances.
ACE inhibitors (and ARBs) Widely prescribed in CKD (b p. 203). Clinical
trials show a good safety proﬁle, even in higher CKD stages. Check eGFR
and K+ before and 3–5 days after. Expect (and allow) a rise in SCr or d
eGFR of up to 20%, but recheck within 2–4 weeks.  A precipitous fall
in GFR may be seen in situations where renal perfusion is dependent on
RAS activation (l CCF, bilateral renal artery stenosis, stenosis to a solitary
kidney). 2 Rapid d GFR and AKI are always made more likely by volume
depletion (diuretics, GI upset, etc.). It is sensible to advise patients to
temporarily stop these medications in the event of intercurrent illness,
particularly if dehydration is a factor.
Digoxin Is less tissue-bound in the presence of impaired renal function
and 6 has a reduced volume of distribution. Dose reductions are
necessary from relatively early CKD, and monitoring of levels can guide
maintenance treatment. Loading doses are also reduced at ESRD (e.g. 750
micrograms—1mg in three divided doses). Digoxin is not removed by
dialysis or ﬁltration. Digitoxin, an alternative cardiac glycoside, undergoes
liver metabolism and does not require such substantial dose adjustments.
Amiodarone Does not require dose modiﬁcation, but beware multiple
drug interactions.
Statins Evidence of beneﬁt for lipid-lowering therapy in CKD is limited
(b p. 205), but statins can be used at standard doses. Myopathy is more
common, so high doses should be used with caution. There is an important
interaction with ciclosporin in transplant recipients (li myopathy risk).
 Fibrates require dose reduction in moderate renal impairment (GFR
<40mL/min) and should be avoided in advanced CKD. They are also
associated with a reversible increase in SCr (thought to be mediated by
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor A). Ezetimibe is considered
safe for use with no dose modiﬁcation.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Prescribing in speciﬁc situations
Diabetic CKD
Close working between renal and diabetic teams is highly desirable.
Collaboration can ensure a patient’s treatment remains appropriate as
CKD progresses. Medications must be adjusted for optimal control of
glycaemia, reduction of proteinuria, modiﬁcation of cardiovascular risk,
and prevention of CKD progression. Diabetic patients may also require
intervention for CKD-related complications, including anaemia, at a higher
eGFR, and these can be more symptomatic in the presence of other
diabetes-related comorbidities.
Insulin  Metabolized, rather than excreted, by the kidneys. Careful
prospective review of an individual’s insulin regimen is necessary, as GFR
falls, if hypoglycaemia is to be avoided. Educate the patient that insulin
requirements may decrease, independent of changes in diet or activity.
Insulin also has a role in the management of hyperkalaemia (b p. 130).
Insulin is not removed by dialysis.
Metformin 90–100% renal excretion and 6 contraindicated in advanced
CKD. Consider switching to alternatives (often insulin) once eGFR <40mL/
min and certainly once <30mL/min. 2 Accumulation in renal insufﬁciency
can rarely cause profound lactic acidosis, particularly during episodes
of acute-on-chronic kidney injury ( contrast) or during intercurrent
illnesses involving hypoxaemia (e.g. sepsis, MI).
Sulfonylureas Gliclazide and glipizide undergo minimal renal clearance
and require no dose adjustment. However, since they increase insulin
secretion, which itself may have a prolonged action in CKD, they should be
titrated with caution.  The metabolites of glibenclamide and glimepiride
may accumulate and cause unpredictable hypoglycaemia, so these agents
are best avoided.
Acarbose Avoid if eGFR <25mL/min, as metabolites accumulate.
Metglitinides Repaglinide and nateglinide can be used without a dose
adjustment.
Thiazolidinediones Undergo biliary excretion and do not require dose
adjustment. However, they have been associated with problematic ﬂuid
retention and oedema in patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure.
Given the incidence of cardiac disease and volume overload in CKD, they
should be avoided or used with extreme caution.
Gliptins predominantly undergo renal excretion (except linagliptin-bile
and GI tract). Sitagliptin requires dose reduction; e.g. 50mg daily for GFR
30–50mL/min and 25mg for GFR <30ml/min. Sitagliptin is not dialysed and
can be used in HD and CAPD patients (generally 25mg daily). Linagliptin’s
route of elimination means that it does not require dose adjustment.
There is less experience with other gliptins.

Thyroid disease
Thyroid hormone Replacement does not require dose adjustment.
However, co-administration with phosphate binders or oral iron impairs
absorption. T3 and T4 are both highly protein-bound. In profound

PRESCRIBING IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS

hypoalbuminaemia, such as in the nephrotic syndrome, changes in the
unbound fraction of T3 and T4 may cause temporary toxicity.
In addition, TFTs should be interpreted with caution in advanced CKD,
as uraemia is associated with d peripheral enzymatic conversion of T4
l T3, as well as d protein binding. Practically, this means titrating dose
changes more slowly against clinical, not just biochemical, response.

Hyperuricaemia and gout
Fractional excretion of uric acid falls as GFR declines, and this may be
aggravated by drugs that reduce urate clearance (e.g. diuretics, ciclosporin,
NSAIDs). Gout is, therefore, highly prevalent in CKD.
Colchicine Accumulates in renal impairment, so lower doses are
recommended to avoid GI and haematological side effects. e.g. 500mcg bd.
Allopurinol Is metabolized to oxypurinol, an active metabolite that
accumulates in renal impairment. This means it should be introduced at
lower dosage (e.g. 100mg daily) and titrated. Side effects include cutaneous
reactions and bone marrow suppression.  There is an important drug
interaction between azathioprine and allopurinol (l profound bone
marrow suppression). Concomitant administration should be avoided.
There is limited experience with febuxostat, a newer xanthine oxidase inhibitor once GFR <30mL/min. Concomitant use with azathioprine
should be avoided.
NSAIDs Are best avoided, where possible, but may be useful for brief
administration under close supervision. Corticosteroids may be helpful in
severe or refractory cases, with no dose adjustments.
Rasburicase Is an intravenously administered urate oxidase inhibitor that
potently reduces uric acid levels in the prophylaxis and treatment of acute
hyperuricaemia during chemotherapy. No dose adjustment is required.

Bone metabolism
Bisphosphonates Are extensively excreted in the urine. They are assimilated
into bone and promote osteoclast apoptosis. The normal bone remodelling cycle (the coupling of osteoclastic resorption with osteoblastic formation) lasts 7200 days but may exceed 1,000 days, following bisphosphonate
administration. Impaired clearance in renal insufﬁciency increases the amount
incorporated in the skeleton where it may cause or exacerbate low bone
turnover and 6 adynamic bone disorder. Safety in CKD 4–5 is unproven,
and bisphosphonates should be avoided in this context (b p. 234). Rapid
administration of IV bisphosphonates (e.g. pamidronate) without adequate
hydration has also been associated with acute nephrotoxicity and AKI.

Nausea
Dopamine antagonists Such as domperidone, metoclopramide, and
prochlorperazine, are not renally excreted and can be used in renal
insufﬁciency. However, extrapyramidal side effects are more common,
so titrate doses carefully. Domperidone does not cross the blood–brain
barrier and may be preferred.
5-HT3 antagonists Such as ondansetron and granisetron, do not require
dose modiﬁcation.

895

896

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Dyspepsia
Dyspeptic symptoms are common in advanced CKD. Uraemia may affect
autonomic and enteric nervous system function. CAPD may delay gastric
emptying and promote reﬂux. In addition, gastric irritants, such as aspirin,
are widely prescribed in this population.
Antacids Are safe, although aluminium or magnesium can accumulate if
taken in excess.
Proton pump inhibitors Can be safely prescribed in standard doses. PPIs have
been implicated in the development of interstitial nephritis. Although this is
a rare side effect, the number of individuals taking them means that they are
now the most important cause of acute interstitial nephritis in many countries.
H2 receptor antagonists Are renally excreted but generally prescribed
safely, with no dose modiﬁcation. Cimetidine is best avoided: it interacts
with cytochrome P450 enzymes, causing drug interactions, and falsely
elevates SCr through the inhibition of active urinary creatinine secretion.

Constipation
GI motility is affected by renal failure: uraemia disturbs colonic innervation; diet is often suboptimal, and polypharmacy is common. Both HD
and CAPD patients should avoid constipation—the former because of
increased enteric K+ absorption, and the latter as it impairs inﬂow and
outﬂow of dialysis and 6 dialysis efﬁciency.
Dietary intervention Can be effective. Dose modiﬁcations of bulking
agents (e.g. ispaghula), stimulating agents (e.g. senna, bisacodyl), and
osmotic agents (e.g. lactulose) are generally not required.
Bowel cleansing solutions Should be used with caution in advanced CKD
and AKI due to the potential risk of hypovolaemia as well as their high
phosphate or magnesium content.

Psychotropic drugs
Mostly lipid-soluble and liver-metabolized. However, caution is prudent,
as side effects may be more common in advanced CKD. Slow dose titration is advisable. Often non-dialysed.
Serotonin-speciﬁc reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Are widely prescribed at
normal doses, with cautious titration (e.g. citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline).
Tricyclic antidepressants Are predominantly hepatically metabolized
and may be used with careful titration. However, patients with advanced
CKD may be more prone to anticholinergic side effects, such as postural
hypotension.
Benzodiazepines Are liver-metabolized, but heightened CNS toxicity,
particularly sedation, is a concern. Short-acting agents are 6 preferred.
Protein binding of midazolam is reduced, so it should be used with caution
in advanced CKD.
Antipsychotics Such as clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine, are generally
well tolerated. Risperidone and its active metabolites are renally excreted,
so initiation and titration are cautious. Lithium is discussed on b p. 904.

PRESCRIBING IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS

Haloperidol Is often used in acute agitation as well as an antiemetic.
Smaller initial doses should be used in advanced CKD because of increased
CNS sensitivity.

Anticonvulsants
Carbamazepine Is dosed as normal. However, it is a potent enzyme
inducer with multiple interactions, so particular care must be taken
post-transplantation.
 Gabapentin and pregabalin require signiﬁcant dose reduction, according
to GFR, as well as clinical vigilance for evidence of toxicity (confusion, dizziness,
ataxia, drowsiness). Both are dialysable (useful in overdose).
The pharmacokinetic behaviour of phenytoin is signiﬁcantly altered
in renal insufﬁciency (l variable absorption, d protein binding, and i
Vd). Modest dose changes may 6 result in disproportionate side effects.
Therapeutic drug monitoring is also more complicated. Many laboratories
measure total drug (i.e. protein-bound and unbound). However, the proportion of free drug may be higher, so total levels are often misleading.
Cautious dose titration and clinical correlation are required. Measurement
of free drug levels may be available.  Phenytoin is also a potent enzyme
inducer, with several important drug interactions.
Valproate is not signiﬁcantly renally excreted and has fewer interactions.
However, changes to the protein binding may cause increased sensitivity.
Levetiracetam, topiramate and vigabatrin undergo signiﬁcant renal
excretion, and dose modiﬁcation is required. Lamotrigine has metabolites
that are renally excreted and should be used with caution.

Opioid analgesics (3 see also b p. 271)
• Opioid analgesics have metabolites with variable activity and
dependence on renal excretion.
• Cautious titration is necessary. 2 However, this should be an excuse
for the habitual undertreatment of pain in patients with CKD.
• Metabolite accumulation l prolonged action and potential
CNS toxicity ( confusion, sedation, respiratory depression,
hallucinations, seizures).
• Morphine metabolism l active and renally cleared metabolites
(morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide),
accumulation of which can be problematic, so morphine is best
avoided.
• Hydromorphone l hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which does
not accumulate signiﬁcantly.
• Buprenorphine l relatively inactive biliary excreted metabolites.
• Codeine l morphine-6-glucuronide accumulation with the
inherent problems above.
• Alfentanil, fentanyl, and oxycodone are relatively safe choices, as
they do not have active metabolites.
• Tramadol l O-desmethyltramadol, which can accumulate in CKD.
• 2 Naloxone is used for opiate reversal in standard doses. Dialysis
may also be helpful in overdose situations.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Drug-related nephrotoxicity
Introduction
The kidneys’ role in the excretion of many drugs means that they are
particularly vulnerable to drug-related toxicity. High renal blood ﬂow and
6 high renal drug delivery intensify this. The concentration of a drug in
tubular ﬂuid and the medullary interstitium may be many times higher than
that in plasma or other tissues.
A variety of renal presentations and syndromes may result from drug
toxicity (b see Chapter 1, p. 7). This means that the drug history is an
absolutely fundamental component of renal medicine.

Antifungals
Amphotericin Is associated with frequent and severe toxicity (>50%).
Risk factors: cumulative dose, infusion rate (continuous infusion appears
less toxic), pre-existing renal disease, older age, concomitant diuretic use,
electrolyte disturbances. Usually causes reversible AKI during treatment.
Mechanisms: afferent vasoconstriction and increased tubular permeability.
Prevention: adequate hydration, continuous infusion, correct electrolyte
imbalances. Liposomal formulations appear less nephrotoxic (if signiﬁcantly
more expensive). Distal renal tubular acidosis and urinary Mg2+ and K+ wasting
may also occur. d K+ is common and often signiﬁcant, requiring replacement.
Note: beware the difference in doses across the different formulations.

Antiviral therapy
Aciclovir, valaciclovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir and valganciclovir May crystallize in renal tubules, causing reversible AKI, particularly in the setting
of volume depletion and after IV bolus administration. Urine microscopy
reveals birefringent crystals under polarized light (and haematuria).  All
require signiﬁcant dose reduction in renal impairment and are freely dialysed (b Table 12.2).
Cidofovir Causes reversible dose-dependent toxicity through the
induction of proximal tubular apoptosis (l proteinuria, d GFR, interstitial
nephritis, Fanconi syndrome, nephrogenic DI). Administer with hydration.
Co-administration of probenecid has been used to slow renal tubular
excretion and ameliorate toxicity.
Foscarnet Frequently causes AKI, especially if given to volume-depleted
patients. Pre-hydrate.
Indinavir Is only poorly soluble at urine pH 5.5–7.0. Precipitation causes
crystalluria and tubular obstruction (l dysuria, haematuria, renal colic,
ﬂank pain, and signiﬁcant renal impairment). Stones (radiolucent) may
form. Pre-hydrate.
Ritonavir Can cause reversible AKI, particularly in patients with
pre-existing renal insufﬁciency.
Tenofovir A reverse transcriptase inhibitor, has been associated with a
proximal tubulopathy.

DRUG-RELATED NEPHROTOXICITY

Chemotherapeutic drugs
Anti-cancer drugs are often given at high dose and have a relatively narrow
therapeutic index. Toxic effects include AKI, CKD, tubular dysfunction,
and thrombotic microangiopathy.
Methotrexate Is primarily renally excreted and requires a dose
reduction, according to GFR. Renal toxicity is rare with chronic low-dose
administration (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) but more common with
high-dose regimens (e.g. cancer treatment). Best avoided if GFR <30mL/
min. Removed by HD ( but not CAPD). Intrarenal drug precipitation
causes tubular obstruction (l ATN and AKI). The administration of
the recombinant bacterial enzyme carboxypeptidase (glucarpidase) can
reduce toxic serum levels when renal impairment compromises clearance.
Cisplatin Toxicity can restrict its clinical utility. Multiple mechanisms
are involved (l vasoconstriction, i proinﬂammatory cytokines, tubular
cell necrosis and apoptosis). Renal impairment may persist and progress
despite cessation of therapy. Usually avoided if pre-existing renal disease.
Other presentations: d Mg2+, d Ca2+, tubular proteinuria, and (rarely) TTP.
Prevention: hydration; maintain good urine output; use modiﬁed daily
dosing regimens, and restrict cumulative dose. Carboplatin is considered
less nephrotoxic and may be preferred in many situations.
Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide May cause haemorrhagic cystitis
(prevention: hydration and concomitant Mesna administration).
Also: irreversible tubular toxicity (including Fanconi syndrome).
Mitomycin and gemcitabine Have been associated with severe thrombotic
microangiopathy.

Immunomodulation therapy
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) Is generally well tolerated, but AKI
can result from toxic tubular effects of carbohydrates in many formulations (l cell vacuolization and swelling l progressive luminal obstruction). Diabetes and pre-existing renal disease appear to be risk factors.
Prevention: avoid sucrose-containing products, slow infusion rate, adequate hydration.
Interferon alfa Causes proteinuria (725%) and i SCr (710%). A variety of
glomerular lesions, including minimal change disease and crescentic GN,
have been described. TTP also reported.  In addition, interferons can
upregulate the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens, provoking
rejection of transplanted organs.

Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs)
Ciclosporin and tacrolimus are widely used in transplantation, glomerular
disease, and inﬂammatory disorders. Both are associated with important
nephrotoxicity.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Acute toxicity
• Haemodynamically mediated and reversible.
• Often no structural damage.
• Responds to dose adjustment or drug withdrawal.
• Presents as an asymptomatic i SCr (even where serum level is in
the desired therapeutic range). This can mimic rejection in transplant
recipients, triggering further investigation, e.g. a transplant biopsy
(b p. 416).
• Histology may be normal or reveal indicative tubular changes, such as
vacuolization, tubular microcalciﬁcation, or giant mitochondria.
• AKI is relatively common in post-heart, lung, and bone marrow
transplantation (although is not exclusively s to CNIs in this situation).
• CNI-induced thrombotic microangiopathy is an uncommon, but
important, syndrome post-transplantation (b p. 412).
Chronic toxicity
• Characterized by irreversible and progressive tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis.
• Fibrosis typically a ‘striped’ pattern from the medulla to the cortical
medullary rays. Degenerative afferent arteriolar changes may be
present.
• In non-renal transplantation, CNIs are linked to the development of
CKD, e.g. ESRD occurs in 71–8% of cardiac transplant recipients.
• Nephrotoxicity may increase with concurrent use of mTOR inhibitors,
e.g. sirolimus, everolimus.
• Prevention:
• Therapeutic drug monitoring. Tacrolimus trough concentrations
(C0) correlate well with overall drug exposure (AUC) and are used
to monitor therapy.
• X Debate remains surrounding the optimal way of monitoring
ciclosporin levels. C0, C2 (2 hours post-dose), and AUC0–4
(multipoint testing from 0–4 hours) are all in clinical use.
• Avoid concomitant nephrotoxins.
• Be cautious with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 liver
microsomal enzymes and i CNI levels (e.g. ketoconazole,
ﬂuconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, verapamil, diltiazem).
• Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 and d CNI levels include
carbamazepine and rifampicin.

DRUG-RELATED NEPHROTOXICITY

Herbal medicines
Herbal medicines, often dispensed in an unregulated manner, are a
ubiquitous part of healthcare provision in many developing countries,
and their use in the developed world has expanded considerably (see
Table 12.3). The kidney is the primary route of excretion for many
such compounds, and their potential for nephrotoxicity is increasingly
recognized. The true global incidence of CKD related to the ingestion
of herbal remedies is currently unknown but could be very signiﬁcant.
When suspected, reporting is desirable.
Causes of toxicity
• Consumption of herbs known to have toxic potential.
• Consumption of herbs with unknown, or underappreciated, toxicity.
• Incorrect identiﬁcation l inadvertent ingestion of a toxic herb.
• Deliberate or accidental contamination of herbal products, e.g.
NSAIDs or heavy metals (such as cadmium).
• Interaction with prescribed drugs.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

NSAIDs and the kidney
Mechanism of action
NSAIDs inhibit the cyclo-oxygenases (COX), an enzyme family critical
for prostaglandin synthesis. There are at least two COX isoforms: most
NSAIDs inhibit both, but COX-2 inhibitors (the ‘-coxib’ family) are selective for COX-2 (X and 6 possibly cause fewer GI side effects).

Side effects
Potent anti-inﬂammatory and analgesic properties make these drugs
amongst the most ubiquitous in the world. Adverse effects include:
• Renal toxicity (b see below).
• GI side effects: dyspepsia, ulceration, and small and large bowel
toxicity.
• Cardiovascular: i risk of CV disease and i BP (X COX-2 >
non-selective NSAIDs).
• Bronchospasm.
• Liver toxicity: abnormal LFTs (although serious liver failure is rare).
• Antiplatelet effects (d thromboxane A2 production). Beneﬁcial when
aspirin is given to modify CV risk but a potential adverse effect in
other situations.

Renal toxicity
• 2 NSAIDs should generally be avoided in the presence of either AKI
or CKD, except in very select and carefully monitored situations.
•  NSAIDs are a very signiﬁcant cause of hospital-based AKI.
• NSAIDs and renal haemodynamics:
• NSAIDs have only a marginal effect on renal haemodynamics when
kidney function is normal.
• However, when renal blood ﬂow is impaired, they abolish
prostacyclin- and prostaglandin E2-mediated compensatory afferent
arteriolar vasodilation, causing reduced glomerular perfusion.
• Clinically relevant situations include: pre-existing CKD, CCF, sepsis,
nephrotic syndrome, hypovolaemia, concomitant ACE-I/ARB use,
concomitant gentamicin or other nephrotoxin use, increasing age.
• NSAIDs also ameliorate the antagonistic effect of prostaglandins on
ADH action. This antidiuretic effect can cause salt and water retention,
i BP, and blunt the action of diuretics.
• Many of the renal effects of NSAIDs are mediated by COX-2, so
COX-2 inhibitors appear equally nephrotoxic.
•  In general, always beware claims of more ‘renal friendly’ NSAIDs, as
there is limited supporting evidence.
• Other NSAID-induced renal lesions:
• Important cause of acute interstitial nephritis (b p. 580).
• Chronic interstitial nephritis (and 6 CKD) with long-term use.
• Analgesic nephropathy (b p. 584).
• Nephrotic syndrome: particularly minimal change disease and
membranous GN (b p. 564).
• Papillary necrosis (b p. 585).
• Electrolyte disorders d Na+, i K+, acidosis.

NSAIDS AND THE KIDNEY

Sulfasalazines
• Sulfasalazine is 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) coupled to a carrier
sulfapyridine molecule that assists GI absorption.
• 5-ASA shares structural similarities with aspirin.
• Second-generation sulfasalazines (e.g. mesalazine) were designed to
minimize troublesome haematological side effects.
• Such agents are effective and important treatments for inﬂammatory
bowel disease (IBD).
• There has been signiﬁcant historical concern regarding an association
with acute interstitial nephritis.
• However, available data suggest this is actually relatively uncommon.
Case control data from a UK primary care database suggested an
adjusted odds ratio for renal disease of 0.86 for current 5-ASA users
and 2.48 for recent users. Mesalazine and sulfasalazine appeared to carry
comparable risks. Causality was unclear in the majority of cases.
• What is more important is to keep in mind that patients with IBD
are at increased risk of renal disease, in general. In addition to 5-ASA
toxicity, the differential of renal impairment in patients with IBD
includes:
• Glomerulonephritis (e.g. membranous GN).
• Amyloidosis.
• Oxalate stone disease.
• If suspected, acute interstitial nephritis usually requires a diagnostic
renal biopsy for conﬁrmation.
In summary, all patients with active IBD are at higher risk of renal dysfunction and should have their renal function and urinalysis checked
intermittently. This is particularly true of those treated with 5-ASA
derivatives, who should have their renal function monitored every
73–6-monthly.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Lithium and the kidney
Introduction
• Lithium is a very effective treatment for uni- and bipolar affective
disorders, allowing many patients to stabilize their symptoms and
enjoy an excellent quality of life.
• Lithium clearance mirrors that of Na+: it is freely ﬁltered at the
glomerulus and predominantly reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.
720% is excreted unchanged in the urine.
• Accumulation can occur in principal cells of the collecting duct,
particularly if GFR falls (l hypovolaemia, concomitant diuretics,
NSAIDs, or ACE-I).
• Long-term exposure can cause tubular atrophy, tubular cyst formation,
progressive interstitial ﬁbrosis, and, eventually, glomerulosclerosis.
• Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window, and therapeutic drug
monitoring is mandatory. The goal should be the lowest serum
concentration that maintains adequate control of affective symptoms
(e.g. 0.4–0.8mmol/L). Once-daily dosing regimens appear to have less
potential to cause toxicity.
• Renal damage is related to both the average serum lithium
concentration and cumulative dose.
• Any patient receiving lithium should have their renal function
measured 6–12-monthly.

Toxic effects
Renal
• Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (b p. 789).
• Lithium causes ADH resistance (d aquaporin-2 expression).
• 750% of patients have impaired urinary concentrating ability and
725% develop polyuria and polydipsia (although these do not
generally require cessation of treatment).
• Amiloride can be used to d urine volumes in this situation, as it
blocks lithium uptake through the collecting duct epithelial Na+
channel (ENaC).
•  Thiazides may i toxicity through both volume contraction and
i Na+ and lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubule.
• Lithium use is a rare cause of hypercalcaemia (and mild
hypermagnesaemia), which may further perpetuate renal damage.
• Chronic interstitial damage:
• Leads to progressive CKD.
• Uncommon, although the true incidence is difﬁcult to ascertain,
as patients may have non-lithium-related causes of CKD. Kidney
biopsies are often not undertaken—or reveal non-speciﬁc,
non-diagnostic change only.
• Histological clues: microcytic change in distal tubules, with only
limited interstitial inﬂammation or vascular change.
• The mechanism of renal damage is unclear, but tubular cell uptake
with impairment of cell proliferation appears important.

LITHIUM AND THE KIDNEY

• Once established, drug withdrawal may not stabilize renal function.
• Diagnosis does not necessarily mandate lithium withdrawal.
Many patients will prefer to remain on lithium, rather than risk
destabilization of their symptoms, particularly if their GFR is
declining slowly. Careful individual assessment and explanation are
necessary.
Other
• GI disturbance.
• Goitre and thyroid dysfunction.
• Neurological including tremor and cognitive impairment.

Treatment of acute lithium intoxication
• Complications:
• Common: tremor, thirst, polyuria, diarrhoea, and vomiting.
• More severe: d GCS, hypertonia, seizures, focal neurological
signs, cardiac arrhythmias, d BP.
• Investigations:
• Serum lithium concentration.
• U&E, SCr.
• Management:
• Protect airway and monitor cardiac rhythm.
• Consider gastric lavage if early presentation post-ingestion (1h).
• No role for activated charcoal.
• Fluid-resuscitate: correct hypovolaemia using 0.9% NaCl 9 0.45%
NaCl (if hypernatraemic).
• Haemodialysis (b p. 906):
• Effectively removes lithium.
• Use high pump speed and large membrane for 4–6h.
• Indications for haemodialysis:
— Lithium level >3.5mmol/L.
— Lithium level >2mmol/L with severe symptoms 9d GFR.
• Rebound is common, as lithium moves from the intracellular to
extracellular space.
• Recheck lithium concentration after 6h, and repeat dialysis
treatment, as necessary.

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Dialysis treatment of poisoning
Introduction
Although rarely necessary (0.05% of all cases), dialysis can be an effective
way to treat drug overdoses and toxicity. Standard supportive measures
for poisoning must still always be undertaken.
Indications
• The poison (or its toxic metabolites) is removed by dialysis.
Favourable characteristics:
• Low MW (<500Da).
• Relatively low protein binding.
• Small volume of distribution (i.e. conﬁned to plasma volume).
• Water-soluble.
• Severe toxicity.
• Elimination is quicker via dialysis, or native clearance is impaired (e.g.
renal or hepatic impairment is present).
Examples
Methanol and ethylene glycol (b pp. 910–912), lithium (b p. 904), aspirin
(salicylic acid) (b p. 908), theophylline, barbiturates, antibacterials, antivirals, star fruit poisoning (Averrhoa carambola).

Techniques
Haemodialysis
• The goal is to remove as much of the drug/toxin as possible.
• Use a high efﬁciency dialyser with a large surface area (>1.5m2).
• High pump speeds; blood ﬂow >300mL/min.
• Long treatment (4–8 hours).
• Complications:
• The patient often does not have renal impairment, so
‘overcorrection’ of electrolyte imbalances may occur.
• d PO4 may occur and require correction (phosphate is not present
in standard dialysate solutions).
• d K+.
• Metabolic alkalosis.
Haemoﬁltration
• Haemoﬁltration is less effective than HD for drug and toxin
elimination but is often the only technique immediately available.
Haemodiaﬁltration improves clearance and is the preferred continuous
technique.
Peritoneal dialysis
• PD is less efﬁcient and rarely used in this context.

DIALYSIS TREATMENT OF POISONING

Haemoperfusion
• Involves circulation of blood through an extracorporeal circuit,
containing an adsorbent (activated charcoal, carbon, or a polystyrene
resin).
• Requires a similar circuit to HD, but without dialysate, and generally
with the adsorbent contained within a cartridge. The circuit requires
anticoagulation with heparin.
• Haemoperfusion can eliminate protein-bound and lipophilic drugs
and toxins (e.g. phenytoin, digoxin, and paraquat).
• Complications: hypocalcaemia, hypoglycaemia, leucopenia,
thrombocytopenia.
• Less widely available than dialysis or ﬁltration.

907

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Salicylate poisoning
Introduction
Salicylate poisoning remains relatively common. In addition to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), methyl salicylate is present (in large amounts) in oil of
wintergreen preparations used topically for musculoskeletal ailments.
After absorption, salicylate is rapidly converted to salicylic acid. In overdose, absorption may be delayed >4–6h as a consequence of pylorospasm, delayed gastric emptying, tablet clumping, or the ingestion of
extended-release formulations.

Salicylate handling
Under normal circumstances it is highly protein-bound (>90%) and undergoes hepatic metabolism to salicyluric acid, which is both less toxic and
more rapidly excreted by the kidney than salicylate. Only a small amount
is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. However, in overdose, protein
binding falls; liver conjugation pathways are saturated, and renal excretion
(via the anion secretory pathway in the proximal tubule) becomes more
important. Drug t1/2 increases from 72–4h to >20h.

Salicylate actions
• Medullary trigger zone stimulation l nausea and vomiting.
• Medullary respiratory centre stimulation l hyperventilation.
• Cyclo-oxygenase inhibition ld prostaglandin, d prostacyclin, and d
thromboxane synthesis (l platelet dysfunction and gastric injury).
• Cellular injury l disturbed metabolism (including oxidative
phosphorylation) l metabolic acidosis.

Acid–base considerations
• An assortment of acid–base disturbances are possible, following
salicylate overdose:
• Direct salicylates stimulation of the respiratory centre l
hyperventilation l initial d pCO2l respiratory alkalosis.
• Accumulation of organic acids (including lactic acid and keto-acids)
li anion gap l metabolic acidosis.
• Salicylate itself has an insigniﬁcant effect on pH, as serum
concentrations are relatively low.
• A p respiratory acidosis is unusual and indicates severe poisoning
( or the co-ingestion of a respiratory depressant).
• Most patients present with either a p respiratory alkalosis or mixed
p respiratory alkalosis and p metabolic acidosis.

Symptoms and signs
• May correlate poorly with serum levels (esp. in the elderly):
• Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, epigastric pain.
• i RR.
• Tinnitus, vertigo, blurred vision,

SALICYLATE POISONING

• Agitation, swearing, tremor, confusion, seizures, respiratory
depression, coma, hyperthermia, cerebral oedema (esp. if severe
acidosis l salicylate crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily if
non-ionized).
• Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (i vascular permeability),
arrhythmias.

3 Treatment of salicylate poisoning
• Monitor in HDU setting.
• O2 as required.
• Investigations: U&E (i or d K+, d HCO3–), ABG (2–4-hourly), lactate,
glucose (hypoglycaemia common), LFT, FBC (GI bleeding is rare), i
INR, ECG, and CXR (pulmonary oedema).
• Salicylate level every 2h until falling:
• Therapeutic level are <300mg/L (<2.2mmol/L).
• Moderate toxicity 500–750mg/L (3.6–5.4mmol/L).
• Severe overdose >750mg/L (>5.4mmol/L).
• Exclude other drug ingestions ( paracetamol and respiratory
depressants, such as benzodiazepines).
• Gastric lavage if presenting within 1h of ingestion. Later if delayed
gastric emptying suspected.
• Activated charcoal (50g x 3 at 4-hourly intervals) may be effective.
• Optimize ﬂuid status:
• Aim for urine output >100mL/h.
• Alkalinize the urine (salicylate is more soluble at i pH). Give
NaHCO3 1.26% IVI (e.g. 1L over 4h, repeated, as necessary, with
regular clinical assessment of ﬂuid status) until urine pH >7.5–8.5.
• Metabolic alkalosis is not a contraindication to bicarbonate
administration.
• IV glucose (e.g. 20% glucose) if any neurological signs, including
confusion, even if blood glucose is normal (salicylates l
neuroglycopenia).
• Recheck K+ 2–4-hourly. Correct hypokalaemia, if present (allows
more effective urinary alkalinization).
• Dialysis:
• Effectively removes salicylate.
• Indications: renal impairment, poor urine output, pulmonary
oedema (non-cardiogenic or volume overload), deteriorating
neurological signs, cerebral oedema, progressive acidosis despite
adequate medical management, salicylate level >700mg/L
(>5.1mmol/L).
• Use high pump speeds and a large dialyser for 4–6h.
• Continue to monitor salicylate level after dialysis (e.g. at 2h).
• Repeat dialysis treatment may be required if levels rebound (s to
delayed salicylate absorption).

909

CHAPTER 12

Drugs and the kidney

Ethylene glycol poisoning
Introduction
• Ingestion of ethylene glycol (EG) is usually ‘accidental’ when imbibed as
an ethanol substitute. It is widely used in antifreeze and solvents.
• EG is rapidly absorbed and metabolized in the liver (by alcohol
dehydrogenase) to glycolaldehyde, then to various acids (including
glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic). Ingestion of just 50–100 mL can be lethal.
• These acids are responsible for EG toxic effects.
• Glycolic acid is cleared by the kidney and is the dominant cause of
the anion gap acidosis, characteristic of severe cases.
• Tissue calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals are the cause of
cerebral oedema and renal failure.
• Concomitant ethanol ingestion will be protective by blocking the
metabolism of glycol to toxic metabolites.

Symptoms and signs
 Patients may not admit to ingestion and can present in any of the following stages.
• Stage 1 (30min–12h): inebriation, although often no alcoholic fetor,
nausea and vomiting, convulsions (may be focal), nystagmus, ataxia,
visual disturbance, ophthalmoplegia, papilloedema, hypotonia,
hyporeﬂexia, myoclonic jerks, cranial nerve palsies, altered conscious
level, coma. Metabolic acidosis (with i AG).
• Stage 2 (12–24h): i RR, tachycardia, i BP, pulmonary oedema.
• Stage 3 (24–72h): ﬂank pain, renal tenderness, AKI, d Ca2+, crystalluria
(calcium oxalate), i K+, d Mg2+.

Investigations
• ABG:i AG metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation (mainly
glycolic acid, but lactate may contribute). Lactate may also be spuriously
high, as many analysers report an elevated glycolate as lactate). 2 The
degree of acidosis correlates with tissue injury and outcome.
• Ethylene glycol level: may be normal if ingestion >12h prior to
measurement. >500mg/L (8mmol/L) indicates severe toxicity.
Check ethanol, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol levels if suspected
co-ingestion.
• Other: U&E, Ca2+, FBC (ii WCC). LFTs, paracetamol, and salicylate
levels ( beware co-ingestion), urine microscopy for crystals
(needle-shaped calcium oxalate monohydrate). If undertaken, a renal
biopsy would show widespread tubular crystal deposition with ATN.
• Osmolality and anion gap: measured serum osmolality is raised, but
calculated osmolality ([2 x Na+] + urea + glucose) is often normal.
The difference between the two is termed the osmolar gap (often
>10mOsmol/kg). This develops as patients absorb glycol over the
ﬁrst few hours post-ingestion. Subsequently, as glycol is metabolized
to acids, the osmolar gap falls—while the anion gap increases and
systemic acidosis worsens.  Other toxic alcohols also raise the
osmolar gap.

ETHYLENE GLYCOL POISONING

Management
• Gastric lavage if <1h since ingestion.
• If within 12h of ingestion, administer fomepizole (4-methypyrazole).
• Competes with EG for alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing rapid
accumulation of toxic metabolites (8,000x greater afﬁnity than
ethanol). It is relatively easy to use.
• Loading: 15mg/kg IVI in 100mL normal saline over 30min.
Maintenance: 12-hourly doses of 10mg/kg (increase frequency 4h if
dialysis is required—fomepizole is dialysable). The dose is increased
to 15mg/kg 12h after 48h treatment.
• Continue until acidosis has resolved and EG level <200mg/L
(<3.2mmol/L), or preferably undetectable.
• If fomepizole is not available, then administer ethanol.
• Ethanol is much more difﬁcult to use:  intoxication and
respiratory depression.
• Give IVI as a 10% solution in 5% glucose, e.g. remove 50mL from a
500mL bag of glucose, and replace with 50mL absolute ethanol.
• Loading dose: 7.5mL/kg of 10% solution.
• Maintenance: 1mL/kg/h for non-drinkers (2mL/kg/h for drinkers).
• Titrate to a plasma ethanol level of 71g/L (22mmol/L).
• Haemodialysis effectively removes EG and metabolites. Discuss in all
cases, and refer without delay if:
• Renal failure, oliguria, severe acidosis.
• End-organ dysfunction, e.g. neurological signs.
• Plasma level >500mg/L (8mmol/L).
• Adjunct therapies include:
• NaHCO3 1.26% IVI infusion to correct acidosis.
• Maintain high urine ﬂow rate to minimize risk of crystal deposition.
• Thiamine, pyridoxine, and other co-factors (e.g. as Pabrinex® IV).

CHAPTER 13

Renal physiology

Renal structure and function
Kidney structure
• The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron (see Fig. 13.1).
• Each kidney contains 71 million nephrons.
• There are ﬁve parts to the nephron (see Fig. 13.1):
• The glomerulus, which acts as the blood–kidney interface. Plasma is
ﬁltered from capillaries into Bowman’s capsule before heading off
down the nephron.
• The proximal convoluted tubule where most of the ﬁltered load is
reabsorbed (760%).
• The loop of Henle, which is able to concentrate urine because of
the high osmolality of the surrounding medullary interstitium. This
high concentration of solutes is maintained by the countercurrent
multiplier system.
• The distal convoluted tubule, which ‘ﬁne-tunes’ solute and water
reabsorption.
• The collecting system is formed by the convergence of several
nephrons to create a collecting duct. These progressively
amalgamate, as they cross the medulla, until opening into papillary
ducts in the renal pelvis.
• There are two types of nephrons, those localized to the cortex and
those extending into the medulla, the latter characterized by longer
loops of Henle and additional metabolic activity.
• Renal blood supply:
• Renal artery l renal sinus l interlobar arteries (occupy the space
between the renal pelvis and adjacent cortical tissue) l divide
at the corticomedullary junction l branching arcuate arteries l
interlobular arteries (traverse the cortex).
• No arteries penetrate the medulla.
• The kidneys are unique for possessing two capillary beds in series.
The glomerular capillaries are maintained at the high pressure
required for ﬁltration. Peritubular capillaries are low pressure. This
arrangement allows for large volumes of ﬂuid to be ﬁltered and
reabsorbed.

Functions of the kidney
• Glomerular ﬁltration rate (b p. 30):
• This refers to the ﬁltrate of plasma crossing the glomerular barrier
into the urinary space per unit time across all functioning nephrons
(usually expressed in mL/min).
• Tubular function:
• The renal tubules reabsorb 799% of the glomerular ﬁltrate, enabling
them to regulate electrolyte excretion and to concentrate or dilute
urine, according to physiological circumstances.

RENAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

Production of urine
• The production of urine is the result of three processes within the
kidney:
• Glomerular ﬁltration.
• Selective and passive reabsorption within the renal tubules.
• Excretion from the distal nephron into the urinary tract.
• Acid–base regulation (b p. 818).
• The kidneys and lungs work together to maintain an arterial pH of
7.35–7.45. The lungs excrete CO2. The kidneys: (i) prevent HCO3–
loss; (ii) excrete H+; and (iii) buffer urinary H+.
• Endocrine functions:
• Renin: produced by specialized cells within the juxtaglomerular
apparatus (b p. 456).
• Erythropoietin: produced by the peritubular interstitial ﬁbroblasts
in the outer medulla and deep cortex (b p. 218).
• The kidneys are also an important site of action of several
hormones, e.g. aldosterone (promotes Na+ reabsorption),
ANP (promotes Na+ loss), and ADH (increases distal tubular
permeability, allowing urinary concentration).
• Autocrine function:
• Production of NO, endothelins, prostaglandins, natriuretic peptides.
• Protein and polypeptide metabolism, e.g. metabolism of insulin.

CHAPTER 13

Renal physiology

The glomerulus
Introduction
The glomerulus is at the start of the nephron and provides the ﬁrst step
in ﬁltering the blood to form urine. The glomerulus comprises a tuft
of specialized capillaries attached to the mesangium, both of which are
enclosed in a pouch-like extension of the tubule called Bowman’s capsule. Bowman’s capsule is a pocket of epithelial cells in continuity with the
epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). Blood is ﬁltered
through the capillaries of the glomerulus into Bowman’s capsule, and it can
then start its journey down the remainder of the nephron (see Fig. 13.2).
Bowman’s capsule contains:
Capillaries
A knot of capillaries lined by endothelial cells. Blood ﬂows in via the afferent arteriole and out via the efferent arteriole (for a capillary bed to have
arterioles on both ends is unique in the circulation). Changes in afferent
and efferent arteriolar tone are powerful ways of regulating blood ﬂow
and pressure within the glomerulus (b p. 920). The capillary endothelium
contains large fenestrae. This renders it considerably more permeable
(7100x) than most capillary beds. A strong ionic glycocalyx helps with
charge selection.
The glomerular basement membrane (GBM)
The GBM is a non-cellular layer, consisting mainly of glycoproteins (esp.
type IV collagen), sialoglycoproteins (e.g. laminin, ﬁbronectin), proteoglycans (e.g. heparin sulfate). It is manufactured mainly by podocytes and is
the principal ﬁltration barrier. On electron microscopy, it consists of three
layers: the lamina interna, lamina densa, and lamina externa.
Epithelial cells (podocytes)
Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells that produce the components of
the GBM (under cytokine control). They have specially adapted foot processes (hence the name ‘podocyte’) that possess a contractile apparatus.
Interdigitating podocytes are separated from each other on the GBM by
‘slit diaphragms’, which constitute the key mechanical and signalling barrier
to ﬁltration. Podocytes produce podocalyxin (a sialoglycoprotein) to form
a highly anionic coating that allows charge selectivity. Abnormal podocyte
function is considered central to proteinuric nephropathies.
Mesangial cells
Mesangium is the remaining structural component of the glomerulus.
Mesangial cells have an important regulatory function. Two main types
have been identiﬁed; most are derived from a smooth muscle lineage (and
respond to similar stimuli). These are situated adjacent to the endothelium
(within the GBM) and are active in signalling, recruitment of non-resident
cells, and maintenance of vascular tone. Other mesangial cells are derived
from macrophages and monocytes and possess phagocytic properties.
Mesangial cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix containing collagen
IV and V, ﬁbronectin, laminin, and proteoglycans. Mesangial cell activation
and proliferation occur in response to immune-mediated glomerular injury.

THE GLOMERULUS

The glomerular ﬁlter
See Figs 13.3 and 13.4.
The glomerular ﬁlter is composed of four layers:
• Charged endothelial glycocalyx.
• Endothelial fenestrations.
• The glomerular basement membrane.
• The inter-podocyte slit diaphragm.
The inter-podocyte slit diaphragm offers a mesh of interlocking proteins
and lipids, including nephrin, podocin, CD2AP, and podocalyxin.
Podocyte dysfunction (at the heart of many proteinuric nephropathies) impairs both the slit diaphragm and foot process adhesion.
Filtration is principally determined by molecular size and, to a much
lesser extent, by charge.
The glomerular barrier is very permeable to water. Substances with
a MW <5,000Da are freely ﬁltered (unless albumin-bound in plasma).
Larger molecules are partially ﬁltered, with ﬁltration fraction depending on both size and charge. Negatively charged molecules have a lower
ﬁltration fraction than similarly sized cationic molecules.
Albumin (MW 61kDa) is polyanionic and scarcely ﬁltered under normal circumstances. Approximately 70,000g passes through the glomerulus every 24h, of which just 7g (0.01%) appears in the ﬁltrate (and this is
usually reabsorbed further down the nephron).

CHAPTER 13

Renal physiology

Regulation of GFR
Introduction
GFR is dependent on the net hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressure
gradients between glomerular plasma and the ﬂuid in Bowman’s space.
This will be determined by:
• Renal blood ﬂow (RBF):
• Renal blood ﬂow represents 20–25% of cardiac output (1.25L/
min). Two to three million nephrons produce an ultraﬁltrate of
plasma (125mL/min or 7170L/day). Most water and solutes are all
reabsorbed into the tubular epithelium.
• Glomerular structure (ﬁltration surface area and permeability).
• Transglomerular capillary pressure (afferent–efferent tone).
• Plasma oncotic pressure.

Physiological regulation
Autoregulation
Preserves renal blood ﬂow and GFR despite variations in systolic BP.
Predominantly effected by the afferent arteriole: local stretch receptors
quickly adjust afferent arteriolar tone via a ‘myogenic reﬂex’.

Afferent and arteriolar tone
Controls intra-glomerular pressure and ﬂow:
• Increased afferent arteriolar tone (vasoconstriction) leads to reduced
ﬂow and reduced pressure within the glomerulus.
• Increased efferent arteriolar tone (vasoconstriction) leads to reduced
ﬂow and increased pressure within the glomerulus.
Tubuloglomerular feedback
TGF allows tubular ﬂow sensing to change GFR: Cl– delivery to the
juxtaglomerular apparatus is sensed at the macula densa (b p. 921).
i distal Cl– delivery l afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction ld GFR (mediators include adenosine, adenosine triphosphate, thromboxane, NO, and
A2). The importance (and beauty) of this mechanism can be appreciated
if large quantities of Cl– (and thus Na+) are pathologically delivered to
the distal tubule (e.g. non-oliguric ATN). Through TGF, d renal blood
ﬂow leads to d GFR, safeguarding against profound diuresis and volume
depletion. In other words, TGF basically aims to avoid volume depletion/
overload if GFR i or d.
Systemic factors
• The sympathetic nervous system (noradrenaline/norepinephrine) is
a key mediator of vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole. Thus,
in systemic hypotension (li sympathetic activity), renal blood ﬂow
is reduced (allowing blood to be diverted to the brain and heart).
Noradrenaline also stimulates production of renin and A2.
• A2, with its potent vasoconstrictive effects at the efferent arteriole
(with much weaker vasoconstrictor effects at the afferent arteriole),
will assist in the maintenance of GFR ( this is why ACE-I drop

REGULATION OF GFR

transglomerular capillary pressures). Renin also increases with sodium
depletion li A2.
• Vasodilator prostaglandins (PGE1, PGE2, and prostacyclin) are also
important ( hence the need to avoid NSAIDs when renal blood
ﬂow is compromised).
• Other factors: endothelins (esp. ET1) are vasoconstrictors (efferent >
afferent). ANP and BNP cause afferent dilatation. NO relaxes both the
afferent and efferent arteriole and increases renal blood ﬂow.

The juxtaglomerular apparatus
• The juxtaglomerular apparatus has a regulatory role. It consists of
a specialized area of cells that are intimately related to the distal
nephron and to the adjacent afferent and efferent arterioles and
glomerulus.
• It comprises the macula densa, extra-glomerular mesangium, and
arterioles (the last part of the afferent and the ﬁrst part of the
efferent). The macula densa is situated toward the end of the thick
ascending limb of the loop of Henle (i.e. in the distal nephron) (see
Fig. 13.1).
• The cells of the macula densa are closely packed with large nuclei
and attached to a basement membrane that is intimately related to
the extra-glomerular mesangium. They contain large amounts of NO
and cyclo-oxygenase.
• Modiﬁed smooth muscle cells, called granular cells, surround the
afferent arteriole. ‘Granular’ refers to conspicuous cytoplasmic
granules containing renin that is ready for exocytosis into the
surrounding interstitium. Granular cells have dense sympathetic
innervation.
• Tubular Cl– is sensed in the macula densa as part of
tubuloglomerular feedback (b p. 920). This instigates changes
in glomerular blood ﬂow and GFR via arteriolar haemodynamics.
Renin release is also controlled by this system, although the exact
mechanisms are unclear.

CHAPTER 13

Tubular function: overview
Introduction
The tubular epithelium is a single cell layer. The cells have a distinct polarity (determined by their cytoskeleton). Their luminal (apical or tubular)
surface is exposed to ﬁltrate and their basolateral surface to interstitial
ﬂuid (and capillary beds). Speciﬁc transporters are located in the membranes at each of these surfaces. There is a tight junction between cells
near the luminal side. Solute and water movement may be passive via
paracellular routes (regulated via the tight junction) or active via transcellular routes (regulated via the membrane transporters). This movement
may be from tubular ﬂuid to blood (reabsorption) (see Table 13.1) or
from blood to tubular ﬂuid (secretion).
The four sections of the renal tubule are described on b p. 914.

Basic concepts
• The tubules:
• Reabsorb the majority of the ﬁltrate (mainly the proximal
convoluted tubule (PCT)). Given that 7180L of plasma is ﬁltered
each day, an enormous amount of reabsorption is required.
• Regulate solute and water balance (PCT, loop of Henle (LH), distal
tubule (DT), and collecting ducts (CD)).
• Regulate acid–base balance (DT and CD).

• Passive transport occurs via:
• Simple diffusion down a concentration or charge gradient.
• Carrier-mediated diffusion where a speciﬁc membrane carrier
assists transport across the cell membrane.
• A speciﬁc membrane channel.
• Active transport refers to an ion being moved against a concentration,
or charge, gradient. It requires energy (from enzymatic hydrolysis of
ATP). The most important active transporter is the sodium pump (Na+
K+-ATPase).
• Another example of an active transporter in the tubule is the H+
ATPase (excretes H+ in the distal nephron).

TUBULAR FUNCTION: OVERVIEW

The sodium pump (Na+ K+-ATPase)
• Transfers three Na+ from inside a cell in exchange for two K+ (this
imbalance means it moves a net positive charge).
• In the kidney, it is found exclusively at the basolateral (capillary)
surface of the tubule and plays a prime role in tubular reabsorption.
• It keeps intracellular Na+ concentration very low (10–30mmol/L) and
K+ concentration very high (7150mmol/L).
• Na+ will then want to move back into the cell down the
electrochemical gradient that has been created—this occurs either
through speciﬁc sodium channels or via carrier proteins.
• These carrier proteins provide an opportunity for co-transport of
other ions into the cell (e.g. K+ and Cl–) or countertransport out of
the cell (e.g. H+ and Ca2+) against concentration, or charge, gradients,
i.e. to take advantage of the movement of Na+.

Glomerulo-tubular balance
The process whereby a change (i or d) in GFR is compensated for
by a corresponding change in absorption by the rest of the nephron.
This prevents changes in the ﬁltered load having major consequences
for solute excretion. For example, the amount of sodium reabsorbed
in each nephron segment is, in general, proportional to the amount of
sodium delivered to that segment. The mechanisms underlying this are
poorly understood.

923

924

CHAPTER 13

Renal physiology

The proximal convoluted tubule
Introduction
• The PCT reabsorbs the bulk of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose,
amino acids, urate, water (760%), and low molecular weight proteins
(e.g. B2 microglobulin). Appreciable amounts of Ca2+ and PO4 are also
reabsorbed here (see Table 13.1).
• It is not homogenous—it consists of two parts, a convoluted (cortical)
section and a straight (medullary section).
• The ‘average’ PCT is 714mm long and offers a large surface area (due
to the villous-like arrangement at the apical surface of epithelial cells).
The normal kidney contains around 1,000,000 glomeruli; this equates
to a potential surface area for reabsorption of >50m2.
• The PCT is rich in mitochondria.
• The PCT is able to reabsorb up to 65% of the 24,000mmol of Na+ and
180L of water ﬁltered per day.

Sodium and chloride
• In the early part of the PCT, most sodium is reabsorbed via speciﬁc
transporters (see Fig. 13.5), coupled with absorption of glucose and
organic molecules.
• A further transporter exchanges Na+ with H+ ions.
• The energy for these processes comes from the sodium gradient into
the cell, itself generated by the Na+ K+-ATPase (b p. 923).
• The gap junctions between epithelial cells are slightly leaky, so the PCT
is highly permeable to water.
• In the early PCT, chloride (an excess is generated when sodium
is absorbed with other anions or molecules) is reabsorbed via the
paracellular route.
• Further along the PCT, Na+ and H+ are exchanged, while Cl– is
exchanged for another base (e.g. formate, bicarbonate, oxalate) (see
Fig. 13.6). The base and H+ are then reabsorbed, so the net result is
reabsorption of NaCl.
• Cl– leaves the cell in exchange for K+ or via speciﬁc chloride pumps.

Potassium
In this area of the nephron, K+ is mostly reabsorbed down a concentration
gradient via the paracellular space.

Bicarbonate (see also b p. 818)
The PCT reabsorbs 90% of ﬁltered HCO3 but does not acidify the
urine. HCO3 reabsorption is accomplished by means of H+ secretion.
Dissociation of carbonic acid (H2CO3) within epithelial cells yields an H+
ion that enters the ﬁltrate via the Na+/H+ exchanger in the luminal membrane (see Fig. 13.5). The H+ combines with HCO3 in the ﬁltrate to form
carbonic acid, which is rapidly converted to CO2 and H2O by carbonic
anhydrase. This recycling of H+ means there is no net acid excretion at
this point. CO2 enters the cell by simple diffusion and is converted back
to carbonic acid to start the cycle again. Within the cell, the HCO3 generated from carbonic acid dissociation leaves via the basolateral surface in
exchange for Cl– or in association with Na+.

CHAPTER 13

Renal physiology

The loop of Henle
Introduction
The prime function of the loop of Henle is to establish a gradient of osmolality in the renal interstitium and 6 the tubular ﬂuid. This allows the concentration of urine to be varied widely.

Structure
• The loop dives deep into the renal medulla and then back out into the
cortex.
• It consists of a thin descending limb, a thin ascending limb (in some
nephrons), and a thick ascending limb. There are important solute and
water permeability differences along the loop.
• The macula densa (b p. 921) is found close to the thick
ascending limb.
• Capillaries serving the loop accompany it on its journey. These vasa
recta have a bespoke ‘hairpin’ arrangement, as a ‘standard’ capillary
network would simply allow the medullary osmotic gradient to
dissipate through equilibration with capillary blood.
• This U-shaped organization allows water loss and solute entry in the
descending limb to be offset by water entry and solute loss in the
ascending.
• This passive exchange of water and solutes perpetuates the hypertonic
extracellular environment of the medulla that is crucial for water
homeostasis. It is referred to as ‘countercurrent exchange’.
• The thick ascending limb contains cells rich in mitochondria, enabling
the active transport of electrolytes. The reabsorption of Na+, K+, Cl–,
Ca2+ continues in this section of the nephron, and the majority of Mg2+
is recovered here.

Solute transport
(See Fig. 13.7)
• The descending limb is impermeable to Na+, but water moves into the
interstitium down the osmotic gradient. The result is a high luminal
Na+ and Cl– concentration.
• Na+ reabsorption is passive in the thin ascending limb (Na+ and Cl–
move into the interstitium down a concentration gradient) and active
in the thick ascending limb. The active process is again driven by the
basolateral Na+ K+-ATPase (the low intracellular Na+ concentration it
generates allows Na+ entry from the lumen).
• This Na+ enters principally through the Na+, K+, Cl–, Cl– (NKCC)
co-transporter, which is unique to this section of the nephron (and the
target of loop diuretics) (b p. 792).
• Na+ then exits the cell on the basolateral side through the Na+
K+-ATPase, while Cl– and K+ exit through a co-transporter. In
addition, K+ re-enters the lumen through a luminal K+ channel
(ROMK channel)—a recycling process that is necessary to prevent K+
availability from becoming a limiting factor for the operation of NKCC.
• This movement of K+ back to the lumen also keeps it electrically net
positive, which facilitates the passive paracellular reabsorption of Na+
(as well as K+, Ca2+, NH4+, and Mg2+).

facilitates passive reabsorption of Ca2+, Mg2+, and more Na+ via the paracellular
route.

CHAPTER 13

Renal physiology

The loop of Henle: the countercurrent
system
• Allows the concentration of urine to be varied, according to
physiological circumstances.
• The U shape of the loop and its capillary network, the differences
in permeability (to Na+ and water) between the descending and
ascending limbs, and the active reabsorption of Na+ in the thick
ascending limb all underpin the countercurrent system (see Fig. 13.8).
• The system maintains an interstitial osmotic gradient that increases
from the renal cortex (7290mOsmol/kg) to the tip of the medulla
(71,200mOsmol/kg).
• The thin and thick ascending limbs are both impermeable to water.
• Despite this water impermeability, Na+ is reabsorbed in this segment.
This reabsorption of Na+ (and Cl–), but not water, leaves the tubular
ﬂuid dilute and hypotonic (l this region is often called the diluting
segment).
• So:
• Isotonic ﬂuid (7290mOsmol/kg) enters the loop from the PCT.
• As it progresses down the descending limb, it encounters
medullary interstitial ﬂuid of increasing tonicity (the interstitium is
hypertonic because of Na+ reabsorption without water in the thick
ascending limb).
• The descending limb is permeable to water (but not Na+), so water
ﬂows out, down an osmotic gradient, into the concentrated milieu
of the interstitium.
• As this occurs, the tubular ﬂuid progressively equilibrates
osmotically with its surroundings and becomes more and more
hypertonic as the loop descends into the medulla.
• The effect is to concentrate the luminal ﬂuid so that, at the deepest
part of the loop, both the luminal and interstitial osmolality reach
up to 1,200mOsmol/kg.
• In the ascending limb, Na+ (and Cl–) are absorbed (via the NKCC
transporter) without water, generating an osmotic gradient of
7200mOsmol/kg between lumen and interstitium at any given level.
• By the time the luminal ﬂuid reaches the distal tubule, it is dilute
and hypotonic.
• It would remain dilute as it passes through the distal nephron and
collecting duct, were it not for the action of vasopressin (ADH)
(b p. 933).
• High plasma osmolalityl ADH release li permeability of collecting
duct to water li urine osmolality (up to 71,200mOsmol/kg).
• Low plasma osmolalityl ADH release suppressed ld permeability
of collecting duct to water ld urine osmolality (down to
7200mOsmol/kg).

THE LOOP OF HENLE: THE COUNTERCURRENT SYSTEM

Box 13.1 Role of urea
• Urea also makes an important contribution to the maintenance of a
hypertonic medullary interstitium.
• The tubules are relatively impermeable to urea, meaning that
a signiﬁcant amount is delivered to the collecting duct. Then,
vasopressin-dependent water reabsorption increases luminal urea
concentration further.
• However, the vasopressin-sensitive transporters UT-A1 and UT-A3
allow urea to escape into the medullary interstitium.
• Although some re-enters the luminal ﬂuid or equilibrates with the
capillary network, the net result is an increase in interstitial tonicity.

becomes hypertonic (the interstitium is hypertonic). In the ascending limb, NaCl
is absorbed (via the NKCC transporter) without water, generating an osmotic
gradient of 7200mOsmol/kg at any given level. Countercurrent ﬂow in the two
limbs of the loop multiplies this gradient longitudinally. The result is a hypertonic
interstitium in the inner medulla (urea also contributes to this hypertonicity—see
Box 13.1). Thus, ﬂuid entering the distal tubule is hypotonic. Further Na+
reabsorption in the distal tubule can make the ﬂuid still more hypotonic. If ADH is
not present, the collecting duct is impermeable to water, and dilute urine is passed.
If ADH is present, the collecting duct becomes permeable to water, and the urine
becomes hypertonic as it passes through the medulla. Reproduced with permission

CHAPTER 13

The distal nephron
Introduction
The ﬁne-tuning of solute and water reabsorption occurs in the distal
nephron.

The distal convoluted tubule
The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is impermeable to the passive movement of Na+ and Cl– and water (vasopressin does not affect water absorption here). This allows large concentration gradients to develop when
necessary (see Fig. 13.9).
Sodium 75% of the ﬁltered Na+ is reabsorbed in the DCT. The
thiazide-sensitive Na+Cl– co-transporter (NCCT) is the major route.
Further Na+ is absorbed by Na+/H+ exchange, and additional Cl– by Cl–/
HCO3– exchange. H+ and HCO3– then combine in the lumen to form CO2
and H2O (the CO2 can be reabsorbed and recycled). The energy for the
action of the NCCT co-transporter is again derived from Na+K+-ATPase,
as the resulting electrochemical gradient permits Na+ reabsorption into
the cell.
Calcium Absorbed via a speciﬁc epithelial Ca2+ channel under the inﬂuenced of PTH and calcitriol.
Thiazide diuretics block the NCCT co-transporter. They also enhance
Ca2+ absorption (exact mechanisms unknown), reducing calcium excretion in the urine. Hypokalaemia occurs, as there will be an increase in
Na+ delivery to the collecting ducts and 6 additional uptake via ENaCs
(b p. 931). This will increase activity of the basolateral Na+ K+-ATPase,
and the resulting intracellular K+ will then move into the lumen and be
lost in the urine.
Defects in the NCCT co-transporter also underlie Gitelman’s syndrome
(b p. 800).

THE DISTAL NEPHRON

The collecting duct
• Two cell types are found in the collecting duct. Principal cells are
responsible for Na+ (and water) reabsorption and K+ excretion.
Intercalated cells secrete H+ (A-intercalated cells) or HCO3–
(B-intercalated cells).
• Changes in permeability of the collecting duct allow concentration of
urine under the control of vasopressin (ADH).
Principal cells (765% of cells) (See Fig. 13.10)
Sodium Reabsorption from the lumen occurs via a speciﬁc Na+ transporter, the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), and it then leaves the cell
on the basolateral side via the Na+K+-ATPase. (see Fig. 13.10). Although
only 75% of ﬁltered Na+ is reabsorbed here, this is the main site of body
Na+ regulation (see Box 13.2). In contrast to Na+ reabsorption higher in
the nephron, it is predominantly the electrical, rather than concentration,
gradient that drives Na+ from the lumen into the cell (as the luminal Na+
concentration may be as low as 5mmol/L by this stage of the nephron).
Na+K+-ATPase generates a net negative charge within the cell, and Na+
moves down this charge gradient via ENaC into the cell. As the tubular ﬂuid becomes more negatively charged, it favours K+ movement into
the lumen.
Potassium Enters principal cells on the basolateral side via the
Na+K+-ATPase and then move into the lumen (along the favourable
charge gradient discussed previously) via speciﬁc aldosterone-sensitive K+
channels (aldosterone promotes K+ excretion). High urinary ﬂow rates
help to maintain low intraluminal K+ concentrations, allowing the gradient to persist and the channel to operate. Hence, hypovolaemia can l
hyperkalaemia.

Box 13.2 Control of Na+ excretion
• Aldosterone, after binding its mineralocorticoid receptor, increases
the number of open ENaC channels, regulating Na+ absorption
(and excretion). It also increases the number and activity of the
Na+K+-ATPase (it can double the surface area of the basolateral
membrane).
• Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) also acts on ENaC, with i ANP l
inactivation of ENaC.
• Na+ delivery: d delivery li ENaC activity, thereby reducing Na+ loss
in the urine (and preventing volume depletion).
• Vasopressin (ADH) may also be important through an increase in
ENaC numbers and activity.
• Locally produced PGE2 decreases ENaC activity.
2 Amiloride and triamterene block ENaC, thus reducing both Na+ reabsorption and K+ excretion. Spironolactone inhibits the effect of aldosterone on its receptor, with similar effects on Na+ and K+.

These cells are essential to acid–base homeostasis. There are two functional and morphological types. A-intercalated cells are tall, columnar epithelial cells, containing a luminal H+ ATPase that enables them to secrete
protons. B-intercalated cells are ﬂatter cells that contain a basolateral H+
ATPase and a luminal Cl– HCO3 exchanger (called pendrin) that enables
them to excrete base,
The A-intercalated cells transport H+ ions out of the cell into the tubular ﬂuid. This is aldosterone-sensitive (aldosterone li H+ excretion). H+
is generated (along with HCO3–) from the dissociation of carbonic acid via
carbonic anhydrase. HCO3– is then returned to the circulation in exchange
for Cl– ions via a different basolateral Cl– HCO3 co-transporter (called
AE1 protein) (see Fig. 13.11).
Metabolic acidosis converts the collecting tubule from a state of HCO3
secretion to HCO3 absorption (and 6 H+ secretion) that involves a phenotypic shift of B-intercalated cells to A-intercalated cells. The role of the
kidney in acid–base regulation is further discussed on b p. 818.
In circumstances of severe acidosis or d K+, intercalated cells also
express an H+/K+ ATPase, similar to that responsible for gastric acid secretion. This allows additional H+ secretion in exchange for K+.

THE DISTAL NEPHRON

Vasopressin (ADH)
Vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is synthesized in the
hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary in response to
rising plasma osmolality (sensed by hypothalamic osmoreceptors) and/
or signiﬁcant hypovolaemia (sensed by arterial baroreceptors and atrial
stretch receptors).
Vasopressin acts via V1 receptors to stimulate thirst and systemic
vasoconstriction. In the kidney:
• Vasopressin binds V2 receptors located on the basolateral membrane
of principal cells in the collecting duct.
• It acts to reabsorb water in the collecting duct and 6 to concentrate
the urine.
• The duct becomes more permeable to water by the translocation
of speciﬁc water channels (aquaporin-2) to the luminal
membrane.
• Aquaporin-2 is stored in intracellular vesicles ready for membrane
insertion (the basolateral membrane is already water-permeable
by virtue of aquaporin-3 and -4).
• The high interstitial osmolality, maintained by the countercurrent
system, facilitates easy movement of water (b p. 928).
• Vasopressin also increases the permeability of the collecting duct to
urea (b p. 929).
• Defects in aquaporin-2 structure and function underlie X-linked
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (b p. 789).
• Increased intraluminal Ca2+ concentration interferes with
aquaporin-2 membrane insertion. This explains the observation
that hypercalcaemia causes defective urinary concentrating ability,
polyuria, and dehydration.

Insertion of temporary
haemodialysis catheters
Indications
Temporary haemodialysis catheters should be temporary—ideally no line
should remain in situ for longer than a few days. The risk of infection
increases signiﬁcantly if in place for longer—consider switching to a tunnelled line if continuing access is required (b p. 296).
Routes of insertion
• The right internal jugular vein is the preferred route. It is superﬁcial,
technically easy to cannulate (in a ‘virgin’ neck), and joins the SVC in a
straight line. The left internal jugular is an alternative, but the guidewire
and line have to curve in order to reach the SVC. The risk of
malposition and malfunction (and perforation of the vein) is 6 greater.
• The femoral veins are suitable for short-term use and may be the
safest and quickest option in an emergency (see b p. 180).
• The subclavian route should be avoided: there is a higher risk of
subsequent central venous stenoses, potentially rendering the
ipsilateral arm unsuitable for permanent access in the form of an AVF.
Pre-insertion
• Is the line really needed? Check that dialysis is required and whether
the patient is suitable for a tunnelled line (b p. 296) or a PD catheter
insertion.
• Check FBC and clotting.
• The operator should obtain consent from the patient (verbal and/or a
family member if too unwell). Warn about potential complications:
• Failure to cannulate vein.
• Haematoma 9 arterial puncture.
• Pneumothorax, haemothorax (and potential need for a chest drain).
• Air embolus.
• Catheter malfunction.
• Infection and its complications.
• Equipment: every renal unit should have a dedicated room for
line insertion. It should be a sterile environment, containing a 2D
ultrasound probe to facilitate vein cannulation. You will need:
• An assistant.
• Sterile gown, gloves, drapes, and towels. Iodine or chlorhexidine to
clean the skin.
• An ultrasound device to guide line insertion.
• Dressing pack, with a supply of syringes, swabs, and needles.
• Sterile saline for injection.
• Lidocaine (1 or 2%): 10mL.
• Line pack (if pre-packed, will contain introducer needle, guidewire,
and the line itself). Choose a shorter line (e.g. 15cm) for the RIJ
route, longer line (e.g. 20cm) for the left side or the larger patient.
• Tri-sodium citrate lock (Citralock®) (46.7%) or Duralock® have
largely replaced heparin (5,000 units/mL) to ‘lock’ the line once it is
in situ.

INSERTION OF TEMPORARY HAEMODIALYSIS CATHETERS

• Wash and dry hands, as for a surgical procedure; wear sterile gown,
mask, and sterile gloves.
• Position the patient slightly head down (for right-sided insertion).
• Clean a wide area of skin around the insertion site. Lay out sterile
drapes on all sides. Prime both lumens of the line with sterile normal
saline solution.

Tips for problematic line insertions
• Stop insertion if the patient is in pain. Seek senior assistance. Pain
probably indicates that the guidewire or line is in the wrong location.
• Venous blood looks darker than arterial blood and does not ﬁll a
syringe with its own pressure: if in doubt, put a 5mL syringe on either
hub, and see if it ﬁlls in a pulsatile fashion. If still in doubt, perform an
ABG. 1 Do not take the line out yet (see later in this list).
• Inadvertent arterial puncture with an 18-gauge needle can usually be
controlled by pressure for 5–15min. If the larger introducer needle
punctures the artery, it is often safest to abandon the procedure.
Do not attempt the other side of the neck after signiﬁcant arterial
puncture and haematoma (risk of airway obstruction, if bilateral).
• 1 If an artery is accidentally cannulated (i.e. the line is inserted), or
if the vein is traversed such that the line tip is found to lie outside
the vein, then leave the line in situ and seek expert help.
• Check FBC, clotting, and cross-match blood.
• Conﬁrm your concern by aspirating blood (if possible) for
ABG from both lumens. If unable to aspirate, you are in the
wrong place.
• Perform a CXR.
• If there is a rapid deterioration in the patient's condition, a
haemothorax or pneumothorax is likely, and an urgent chest
drain may be required prior to CXR.
• Monitor closely: pulse BP, and O2 saturation.
• Find out where the line is: either a CT or a contrast examination
through the line to determine its location.
• The line must be removed under controlled conditions, with
vascular/thoracic surgical input.

Insertion technique
• Establish anatomical landmarks and the planned point of cannulation
(see Figs 14.1 to 14.3).
• Ultrasound-guided insertion is now the technique of choice.
• Insert local anaesthetic under the skin. Always attempt to aspirate
before injecting lidocaine to avoid inadvertent IV injection.
• Once the needle is in the vein, use a Seldinger technique. Pass the
guidewire through the needle (there should be no resistance—if
resistance is felt, do not force it, but remove the guidewire, and check
the needle position. Do not advance the guidewire beyond the line
length, i.e. 15/20cm, to avoid arrhythmias. Remove the needle, leaving
the guidewire in situ.

937

938

CHAPTER 14

Appendices

• Use a scalpel blade to make a small nick in the skin. Pass the dilator
over the guidewire until it is in the vein. Remove the dilator, keeping
the guidewire in position. Without delay, pass the line over the
guidewire until it is in position. Remove the guidewire.

Vein localization
Ultrasound-guided cannulation
Most probes have a sterile disposable cover. Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions. After inﬁltration of local anaesthetic, identify the vein
with the probe. The introducer needle can be inserted with real-time
guidance.

Blind insertion (no longer recommended)
The approach can be medial to SCM muscle, between the two heads,
or lateral to the muscle. Local practice and expertise will dictate the
optimal route.
• Palpate the carotid artery with one hand (the left for a right-sided
insertion).
• Insert the needle just lateral to the carotid pulse, aiming at 45* to
the skin, in the direction of the ipsilateral nipple. Aspirate gently on
the syringe, as you go, until the vein is reached.
• If unsuccessful, withdraw the needle slowly (continuing with
attempted aspiration—you may have traversed the vein). Reinsert,
varying the angle of insertion slightly to the medial side. If still
unsuccessful, invite a colleague or senior to have a go before you
(and the patient) lose conﬁdence.
• Once the vein is identiﬁed with a green needle, pass the introducer
needle down the same track, in the same manner, into the vein,
palpating the carotid pulse at the same time.
• Check the ﬂows in both lumens. A 20mL syringe should ﬁll easily
with minimal aspiration (general rule of thumb: 20mL should
aspirate in <5s (= 240mL/min). Flush both lumens with saline (which
should also be easy), and then lock with Citralock®, Duralock®, or
heparin. The priming volume should be written on the line (typically
1.3–2.0mL/lumen). Put caps on the lumens, and suture the line in
position.
• Arrange a CXR and review it yourself: look for line position (tip
should be in SVC), and double-check there is no pneumothorax.

Femoral line insertion
Advantages over neck line
• Superﬁcial vein, usually relatively easy to cannulate.
• Relatively safe (haematoma can be controlled by pressure, no risk of
airway obstruction or pneumothorax).
• No CXR required post-procedure (saves time in an emergency).
Disadvantages over neck line
• Femoral line function can be highly positional, particularly in obese
patients. Patients are also relatively immobilized.
• 1 High risk of infection—lines should only be left in for 2–3 days max.
Insertion technique
• The technique is identical as that for neck line insertion. Ultrasound
guidance should be used.
• Position the patient horizontally or with feet slightly down. The hips
should be partially abducted. Do not shave insertion site; if necessary,
hair should be removed by clipping.
• Wear gown and gloves, prepare the skin, and use sterile drapes.
• For the right femoral vein, the ﬁngers of the left hand should be used
to palpate the femoral pulse. Take care to remain below the inguinal
ligament so that a haematoma can be controlled with pressure. The
vein runs just medial to this. Inﬁltrate local anaesthetic, and try to
identify the vein with a green needle. Use the track of the 18-gauge
needle to insert the introducer needle into the vein. Angle the
introducer needle towards the head to facilitate the passing of the
guidewire.
• The remainder of the procedure is as for the internal jugular line.

Tunnelled dialysis catheters
• The dual lumen line is inserted into the internal jugular vein (usually),
with a subcutaneous tunnel that acts as a barrier to infection.
• Tunnelled catheters may be used as semi-permanent access whilst
awaiting maturation of an AV ﬁstula, or as permanent access for the
patient unsuitable for an AVF or PTFE graft.
• Long-term complications include poor ﬂows (and thus inadequate
dialysis), infection, and venous stenosis.
• A trained operator should insert tunnelled lines; ideally, under X-ray
screening to ensure the tip of the line lies in the SVC.
• The complications of insertion are similar to the insertion of any
central line.

CHAPTER 14

Appendices

Preparing renal patients for theatre
Any patient with renal failure is a high-risk patient for surgery. Extreme
care should be taken when preparing for theatre.

Pre-admission
• Full history. Focus on cardiac and respiratory history, dialysis regimen (if
appropriate), and details about previous anaesthesia. Full drug history.
• Can the procedure be done under local or regional anaesthesia (this
may be the case for an AV ﬁstula)?
• Examination. Listen for murmurs and bruits (carotids); examine
peripheral pulses; check lung ﬁelds are clear; assess volume status;
measure BP, including postural BP (and check BP charts, if available).
The anaesthetist will prefer a BP of <150/95mmHg.
• Investigations. FBC (? anaemia which could be corrected pre-op, if
possible), SCr, U&E (iK+), LFT, Ca2+, ECG (any patient with advanced
CKD), CXR if breathless or abnormal cardiorespiratory examination.
Echocardiogram if any new murmur or suggestion of poor LV function.
• Liaise with anaesthetist if any doubt about ﬁtness for anaesthesia or if
further investigations are necessary.
• Liaise with the patient's dialysis unit, if relevant. Plan dialysis around
the surgery (often the day before and the day after the procedure).

On admission
• Repeat full physical examination, including BP and assessment of
volume status.
• If for creation of vascular access, avoid phlebotomy and cannulas in the
limb targeted for surgery.
• Send bloods pre-op and after last dialysis session. U&E, FBC,
clotting, G&S (and cross-match, according to nature of surgery). The
anaesthetist will prefer a K+ <5.5mmol/L.
• Write up drugs to be given pre-op or at induction (e.g. antibiotics).

Post-operative care
• Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, gentamicin), even in dialysis
patients if they still pass urine.
• Ensure adequate analgesia is given, but be aware of risks of opioid
toxicity (b pp. 271 and 897).
• Check volume status and BP. If IV ﬂuids are required, prescribe 0.5–1L,
and then reassess the patient.
• 3Measure SCr and U&E post-op in any patient with signiﬁcant renal
impairment (depolarizing anaesthetic agents lead to muscle K+ release
and may precipitate dangerous i K+).
• If an AVF or PTFE graft have been formed, check for a thrill over the
ﬁstula, and avoid any compression (1BP) or blood tests in that limb.
• Considerd or no heparin anticoagulation during next HD treatment
(discuss with the surgeon).

Acute coronary syndrome
(ACS) in CKD
Introduction
ACS is classically divided into ST elevation MI (STEMI), non-ST elevation
MI (NSTEMI), and unstable angina, depending on the combination of cardiac chest pains, ECG ﬁndings, and cardiac enzyme elevations.
The underlying pathology is atherosclerosis, unstable plaque, and in situ
thrombosis formation. The CKD population has a high burden of traditional risk factors (e.g. i BP, DM, i lipids, smoking, advanced age). In
addition, the pathology may differ in advanced CKD with diffuse, calciﬁc
coronary arteries and microvascular disease. Vessels may be stiff and unable to compensate for changes in haemodynamics (e.g. d BP, tachycardia),
leaving the myocardium more vulnerable to ischaemic injury (even in the
absence of thrombosis).
2 CKD predicts mortality in ACS (and vice versa), but the secure diagnosis of ACS, especially in CKD 5, can be challenging due to a number of
factors.
• Atypical presentation—atypical chest pain, ‘silent MI’, and hypotension/
collapse are more common.
• Atypical ECG— typical ischaemic changes, including ST elevation,
are less likely. LVH (and strain) may complicate interpretation. New
regional wall motion abnormalities on echo may be required to
conﬁrm diagnosis.
• Interpretation of cardiac enzymes (see Box 14.2).
Joint management between a nephrologist and a cardiologist, experienced
with renal patients, is ideal.

Management
Broadly speaking, the treatment of suspected ACS is the same, but it
is important to remember that patients with advanced CKD are often
excluded from large cardiology trials and have an inherently increased
bleeding risk (uraemic platelet dysfunction), and that the underlying
pathology may be fundamentally different.
• Give O2 to maintain normal saturations.
• Treat pain with opiate analgesia. If repeated dosing is required,
consider fentanyl or oxycodone to reduce accumulation (b p. 271).
• Nitrates (sublingual or IV), titrated to pain and BP.
• Aspirin and clopidogrel are administered at standard doses.
Glycoprotein IIa/IIIb inhibitors require dose reduction. One
meta-analysis suggests that clopidogrel and glycoprotein IIa/IIIb
inhibitors may increase bleeding risk without improving mortality in
CKD,1 but the current consensus is to administer them for standard
indications.

ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS) IN CKD

• LMWHs are renally excreted. 50% dose reduction is required if GFR
<30mL/min (e.g. enoxaparin 1mg/kg od) or use unfractionated heparin
instead (b p. 892).
• Beta-blockers (may require dose reduction—b p. 892) should be
titrated to pulse and BP.
• ACE-I/ARBs should be carefully introduced once haemodynamically
stable and no further angiography/surgery is planned.
• Statins (b p. 893) have not been prospectively evaluated post-ACS in
CKD. Standard practice is to prescribe them.
• Anaemia is a predictor of poor outcome in ACS. There is no strong
evidence that transfusing patients improves outcomes, and the
potential beneﬁts need to be weighed against the risks of volume
loading and hyperkalaemia (dialysis may be required). However, it is
standard practice to target an Hb 10–11g/dL.
• ACS commonly causes a deterioration in SCr in CKD. Temporary RRT
may be required. Both acute and chronic HD patients may be better
on CVVHF or SLED initially (b p. 174).
• STEMI: the standard of care is emergency PCI (see Box 14.1).
If unavailable, thrombolysis can be performed. Common renal
contraindications include recent renal biopsy, recent line insertion
(esp. if arterial puncture occurred), uncontrolled BP >200/100mmHg,
uraemic pericarditis.

Box 14.1 Angiography and PCI
Commonly performed. Standard contrast nephropathy precautions
apply, including for dialysis patients with residual function (b p. 148).
It is vital to monitor renal function for 72 hours post-procedure.
Dialysis dependence may be precipitated.
Calciﬁc disease is less amenable to stenting, and rates of restenosis
are higher. This may be reduced by drug-eluting stents, but prolonged
dual antiplatelet therapy is required, which may complicate subsequent
access procedures or transplant listing.

CHAPTER 14

Appendices

Box 14.2 Cardiac biomarkers in CKD
Troponin
Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) are proteins present in cardiac myocytes that may be detectable in serum when released following
myocardial injury.
Elevated serum troponin (esp. cTnT) is commonly found, even
in asymptomatic patients, and does not necessarily indicate acute
ischaemia. Contributing factors include LVH, the uraemic milieu itself,
endothelial dysfunction, and reduced renal excretion. cTnI is more
speciﬁc for ischaemia. Elevated troponins are not an inevitable consequence of renal impairment and are a poor prognostic marker, even in
the absence of ACS.
If ACS is suspected, it is best to measure serum troponin as soon as
possible and again 12 hours post-event, as dynamic changes are generally
more helpful than absolute values.

Creatine kinase (CK)
CK is frequently elevated in advanced CKD. Causes include myopathy,
vitamin D or carnitine deﬁciency, and reduced renal clearance. Neither
total CK, nor the more speciﬁc CK-MB, are reliable for the diagnosis
of ACS.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)
BNP is released from the cardiac ventricles in response to volume loading and promotes salt and water excretion. BNP and its physiologically
inert by-product NT-proBNP have been used in the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of heart failure.
BNP and NT-proBNP are commonly elevated in renal failure for
a number of reasons, e.g. salt and water handling is impaired, leading
to volume overload and ventricular stretch, chronic i BP and LVH,
reduced renal excretion (esp. of NT-proBNP). As such, their utility in
CKD is very limited.

CHAPTER 14

Plasma exchange
Introduction
A technique in which plasma is separated from the rest of the blood so
that it can be removed and replaced. There are two main methods (see
Fig. 14.4):
• Centrifugation: removing plasma by centrifuging the blood.
• Filtration: uses highly permeable membranes through which blood
is pumped at 7100–150mL/min. Plasma readily passes through the
membrane pores (MW cut-off 72,000kDa), but cells do not. In general,
all immunoglobulins will pass through the membrane.
A third technique involves two pumps and membranes and selectively
removes large molecules, including antibodies (‘double ﬁltration’). This
may be used when there is no doubt about the molecule that needs
removing, such as anti-HLA antibodies in transplantation. However, in
other diseases, such as ANCA-associated vasculitis, this is not so clear,
and one of the non-selective methods is recommended.
Anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit with heparin (e.g. 30–60IU/
kg loading dose, followed by 1,000IU/h) or citrate (b p. 186) is required.

Indications
• Diseases in which plasma exchange is used include:
• Anti-GBM disease.
• ANCA-associated vasculitis.
• HUS/TTP.
• Cryoglobulinaemia.
• Hyperviscosity syndrome.
• Recurrent FSGS post-transplant.
• Treatment of highly sensitized transplant recipients.
• Treatment of antibody-mediated transplant rejection.
• Non-renal conditions, including Guillain–Barré syndrome and
myasthaenic crises.

Replacement ﬂuid and coagulation monitoring
Approximately 60mL/kg, up to a maximum of 4L, of plasma is usually
removed during an exchange. The major replacement ﬂuid in most cases
is 5% human albumin solution. A single exchange will lower plasma macromolecules by 760% (790% after ﬁve exchanges). In some conditions,
such as HUS/TTP, the replacement ﬂuid is fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or
Octaplas®, as this provides part of the therapeutic effect. 1 If albumin is
the major replacement ﬂuid, then 1–2L FFP or Octaplas® may be needed
at the end of the exchange if there has been a recent biopsy or pulmonary
haemorrhage.
In all cases, coagulation should be monitored (clotting factors are
removed) and FFP or Octaplas® given, as indicated. Cryoprecipitate or
ﬁbrinogen should be administered if ﬁbrinogen levels are low. Liaise with
your haematology team.

PLASMA EXCHANGE

Potential complications
• Hypotension (usually related to volume depletion).
• Hypocalcaemia: related to the use of citrate as an anticoagulant
(and FFP contains citrate). Can be prevented or treated by calcium
administration during the exchange, e.g. 2–4mL 10% calcium gluconate
added to 500mL 5% human albumin.
• Clotting abnormalities and bleeding (see ‘Replacement ﬂuid and
coagulation monitoring’).
• Complications of central venous catheter insertion and
use: pneumothorax, haemothorax, infection (b p. 936).
• Anaphylactic reactions to FFP (72%), infection from plasma products.
• Alkalosis from the metabolism of citrate.
• Dilutionald K+.

Immunoadsorption
A technique that selectively removes immunoglobulin. This may be
useful in particular circumstances, e.g. removal of anti-HLA antibody
pre-transplantation. Replacement ﬂuids are not required, and there is
no depletion of clotting factors. Uses protein A columns that bind IgG
(mostly) via the Fc domain. Plasma is ﬁrst ﬁltered, prior to being run
through columns containing immunosorbent-coated beads. Antihuman
IgG antibody-coated columns are highly speciﬁc for human Ig but are
very expensive. Protein A columns can be reused.

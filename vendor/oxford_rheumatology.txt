Introduction
Adults and children can present with musculoskeletal (MSK), inflammatory, and
autoimmune diseases in varied ways. Symptoms can be simple and focal, such as
regional pain, or general and non-specific, often in the context of a generalized
process such as fever or fatigue. The following are important points in assessing
the time, type, and nature of presentation:
• Why someone has presented at a particular time.
• What is the impact of symptoms, emotionally and functionally.
• The individual’s perceptions, fears, or cultural references that might modify
(amplify or suppress) expression of the symptoms.
• What fears, beliefs, and factors might present a barrier to effective medical
engagement.
• The same pathological processes might present variably at different ages:
broadly speaking, the young, adults, and the elderly.
In this chapter, the assessment of symptoms has been separated into two parts.

[SECTION]First, the assessment of symptoms in adults and second, the patterns of disease
presentation in children and adolescents.

Musculoskeletal pain in adults
Introduction
The most common presenting symptom to the rheumatologist is unexplained or
ineffectively treated MSK pain.
• Pain is defined by its subjective description, which may vary depending on its
physical (or biological) cause, the patient’s understanding of it, its impact on
function, and the emotional and behavioural response it invokes.
• Pain is particularly prone to be ‘coloured’ by cultural, linguistic, and religious
differences. Therefore, pain is not merely an unpleasant sensation to many; it
is, in effect, an ‘emotional change’.
• Pain experience is different for every individual.
Localization of pain
Adults usually localize pain accurately, although there are some situations worth
noting in rheumatic disease where pain can be poorly localized (Table 1.1):
• Adults may not clearly differentiate between periarticular and articular pain,
referring to bursitis, tendonitis, and other forms of soft tissue injury as ‘joint
pain’. Therefore, it is important to confirm the precise location of the pain on
physical examination.
• Pain may be well localized but caused by a distant lesion, e.g. interscapular
pain caused by mechanical problems in the cervical spine, or right shoulder
pain caused by acute cholecystitis.
• Pain caused by neurological abnormalities, ischaemic pain, and pain referred
from viscera is harder for the patient to visualize or express, and the history
may be given with varied interpretations.
• Bone pain is generally constant despite movement or change in posture—
unlike muscular, synovial, ligament, or tendon pain—and often disturbs sleep.
Fracture, tumour, and metabolic bone disease are all possible causes. Such
constant, local, sleep-disturbing pain should always be investigated.
• Patterns of pain distribution are associated with certain MSK conditions. For
example, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) typically affects the shoulder girdle
and hips, whereas rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects the joints symmetrically,
with a predilection for the hands and feet.
• Patterns of pain distribution may overlap, especially in the elderly, who may
have several conditions simultaneously, e.g. hip and/or knee osteoarthritis

[SECTION](OA), peripheral vascular disease, and degenerative lumbar spine all may
cause lower extremity discomfort.

The quality of pain
Some individuals find it hard to describe pain or use descriptors of severity. A
description of the quality of pain can often help to discriminate the cause.
Certain pain descriptors in adults are associated with non-organic pain
syndromes (Table 1.2):
• Burning pain, hyperpathia (i.e. an exaggerated response to painful stimuli),
and allodynia (i.e. pain from stimuli that are normally not painful) suggest a
neurological or central ‘pain sensitization’ cause.
• A change in the description of pain in a patient with a long-standing condition
is worth noting, since it may denote the presence of a second condition, e.g. a
fracture or septic arthritis in a patient with established RA.
• Repeated, embellished, or elaborate descriptions (‘catastrophizing’) may
suggest non-organic pain, but be aware that such a presentation may be
cultural. Such descriptions may associate with illness behaviour in the
consultation or during the examination.
Pain from trauma/damage to tissues (‘mechanical’) in adults
In general, mechanical disorders are worsened by activity and relieved by rest.
This does not mean pain is not present at rest; in severe mechanical/degenerative
disorders, pain disturbs sleep.

[SECTION]• A good knowledge of anatomy and functional anatomy should allow
localization of affected structures though localization of pains in young
children can be difficult.
• An appreciation of secondary muscle spasm is important as such pain can
mask, to a degree, localization of a mechanical pain, particularly in the back.
Inflammatory musculoskeletal pain in adults
Inflammatory lesions causing pain typically do so with or after immobility, such
as when getting out of bed or after a long car journey.
• Inflammatory MSK pain is often described with ‘stiffness’.
• Inflammatory joint pains from RA, inflammatory OA and peripheral joint
disease in psoriatic arthropathy (PsA) or axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) can
be present on waking and ease with joint movement.
• An assessment of inflammatory back pain is a key assessment in a young adult
with back pain (pain at night, pain/stiffness in the early morning easing with
movement; resolution or significant improvement with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); associated posterior pelvic/buttock pains of
similar quality and description); axSpA needs to be ruled out.

Elicited pain on examination in adults
In adults, eliciting pain or discomfort by the use of different examination
techniques may be used to provide clues to the diagnosis:
• Palpation and comparison of active and passive range of motion can be used to
reproduce pain and localize pathology. This requires practice and a good
knowledge of anatomy.
• Many of the classic physical exam signs and manoeuvres have a high degree
of inter-observer variability. Interpretation should take into account the context
in which the examination is done and the effects of suggestibility.
• Palpation and passive range of motion exercises are performed while the
patient is relaxed.
• The concept of ‘passive’ movement is the assumption that when the patient is
completely relaxed, the muscles and tendons around the joint are removed as
potential sources of pain; in theory, passive range of motion is limited only by
pain at the true joint. This assumption has its own limitations, however,
especially since passive movements of the joint will still cause some
movement of the soft tissues. In some cases (e.g. shoulder rotator cuff
disease), the joint may be painful to move passively because of subluxation or
impingement due to a musculotendinous lesion.
• The clinician should be aware of myofascial pain when palpating
musculotendinous structures, especially around the neck and shoulder regions.
Myofascial pain is said to occur when there is activation of a trigger point that
elicits pain in a zone stereotypical for the individual muscle. It is often aching
in nature.
• Trigger points are associated with palpable tender bands. It is not clear
whether trigger points are the same as the tender points characteristic of
fibromyalgia.
• Some lesions may cause pain primarily on movement and may not be
amenable to disclosure from static palpation (e.g. enthesitis). Do not dismiss
the report of focal pain (or think of it as referred only) if there is no tenderness
at the site on static examination. Pain may only occur with tissue
function/movement.
• Local anaesthetic infiltration at the site of a painful structure is sometimes

[SECTION]used to help localize pathology, e.g. injection under the acromion may provide
substantial relief from a ‘shoulder impingement syndrome’. However, the
technique is reliable only if localization of the injected anaesthetic can be
guaranteed. Few, if any, rigorously controlled trials have shown it to give
specific results for any condition.
• Always complete a regional MSK examination by examining the adjacent
more proximal structures/joint. Typically, patterns of pain referral extend
distally so problems at one joint can cause symptoms in the area of the
adjacent distal joint.

Other presenting symptoms in adults
Stiffness
Stiffness is a common presenting symptom of MSK rheumatological disease. It
may be a manifestation of inflammation or reduced movement due to
mechanical pathology including swelling, or be used by an individual to describe
reduced movement due to pain
• Stiffness is often worse after a period of rest. Short periods (<30 min) of
stiffness that persist after mobilizing is not a meaningful observation. Stiffness
lasting >30 min and often several hours after mobilizing is a typical symptom
of inflammatory arthritis.
• Stiffness can occur in normal joints. Individuals typically click or crack their
joints to stretch the tissues and gain relief.
• Stiffness may be a manifestation of tissue fibrosis; in tendons, for example,
fibrosis may cause nodules to form that in their most extreme lead to locking
or triggering.
• Swelling may arise as a result of synovitis in a joint or tendon, oedema,
cellulitis, haematoma or varicosities, ganglia (common around the wrist), tophi
(fingers, toes), cysts, or nodules (e.g. RA nodules over elbows, or nodules in
fascia as in Dupuytren’s in the hand).
Swelling
• The report of swelling has shown to be unreliable in many instances. Regard
‘swelling’ as a sign on examination unless the description of it as a symptom is
convincing and the story has been elicited very carefully.
• Nerve compression or irritation can often be perceived as swelling (think of
how your lip feels—but isn’t—after a dental anaesthetic i.e. swollen!) and can
colour the reporting of carpal tunnel syndrome symptom.

[SECTION]Clunks, snaps, and clicks
• ‘Clicks’ are often the focus of symptom reports and can cause some anxiety.
However, ‘clicks’ from many different structures are not specific for
‘pathology’.
• Induced snaps like cracking knuckles are usually noises created from the quick
expansion of gas/air within a confined space.
• ‘Clunks’, however, may denote structural loss of integrity (e.g.
femoroacetabular impingement, multidirectional instability of shoulder in
hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS)) and are arguably then more
likely to be associated with ‘pathology’ compared with ‘clicks’.
Constitutional symptoms
Fatigue, fevers, sweats, and excessive sweating sometimes occur with many
different rheumatological diseases.
• It is key to ascertain what is meant by fatigue, differentiating it from lack of
sleep, deconditioning, or specific muscle weakness.
• Fatigue is experienced by many patients in association with systemic illness,
anaemia, endocrinopathy, or metabolic pathology but also from more insidious
(psychosocial influenced) processes such as frustration, stress, and anxiety or
as a consequence of disturbed sleep.
• Fatigue often has to be interrogated as sometimes patients won’t report it,
thinking it is part of ageing, or because of their stage in life (e.g. menopause),
or because of their work pattern.
• Fevers and sweats can, on the face of it, suggest systemic infection, but these
symptoms can be associated with autoimmune connective tissue diseases
particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and in systemic vasculitis
and severe cases of crystal-induced inflammatory disease (e.g. gout).
• Flushes are often drug induced but are often used to describe generalized
vascular reactivity or a response to tachycardia or other symptoms (secondary
effects).
• Excessive sweating is associated with glucocorticoid (GC) use, generalized
inflammatory diseases such as giant cell arteritis (GCA) and autoimmune
conditions such as SLE. True hyperhidrosis is associated with acne and
SAPHO (synovitis, acne, palmoplantar pustulosis, hyperostosis, aseptic
osteomyelitis) syndrome.
Rashes
There are many rheumatological conditions that are manifest in part by rashes.
The association may be temporally related or separate in time so a broad view of

[SECTION]the history of the rash needs to be taken. The latter is exceptionally important for
the diagnosis of psoriasis disease.
• Erythematous rashes occur with viral arthritis, with SLE (as urticarias) and
adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) typically.
• Acne or acneiform rashes can occur in SAPHO syndrome, Behçet’s disease,
and psoriasis disease.
• Pustules occur in a form of psoriasis disease, can denote gonococcal disease in
the right clinical context, and are a hallmark lesion of vasculitides (with
palpable purpura).
• Livedo reticularis is a key feature of SLE but most notably antiphospholipid
syndrome (APS). It can be severe enough to cause a localized vasculitis.
• A brawny, violaceous, slightly raised, confluent, skin eruption is typical of
dermatomyositis (upper trunk, periorbital, and backs of hands typically).
• Psoriasis is notoriously varied and differs particularly in relation to where it is.
An atlas of typical psoriasis appearances is a very useful tool in the
rheumatology clinic.

The adult gait, arms, legs, spine (GALS)
screening examination
As an introduction to a general MSK examination it is helpful to be familiar with
the GALS screen,1 designed to quickly identify the regions of the body
functionally affected. Table 1.3 and Fig. 1.1, and Table 1.4 and Fig. 1.2
demonstrate this process in text and visual format.2

abnormalities and function before entering into a more detailed physical
examination.

Pain assessment in children and adolescents
Introduction
More apparent in children, than at other ages, is that the level of distress from
pain does not correlate well with the severity of the underlying or causative

[SECTION]pathology.
• Some children will complain little of pain, but ‘silently’ lose the function of a
limb due to inflammation of a joint, muscle, or bone.
• Some children, perhaps fuelled by concern or lack of concern of a parent, may
become distressed with an essentially normal examination.
• All reports of pain and what relieves pain should be believed.
• Thus, all children require thorough assessment, which here is guided by the
age and development of the patient.
Pain assessment in specific scenarios
The non- or minimally verbal child
In the very young, or those with cognitive or emotional impairment, the history
of pain and its impact is sought from the parent or carer and correlated with an
astute clinical examination that looks for distress.
• Parents may volunteer that, at times of distress, sleep is disturbed or certain
activities or movements are impaired.
• Attention should be paid to specific activities such as movement of a leg when
nappy changing or change in affect when a part of the body is touched. Both
can be carefully corroborated during examination feeling for, but not trying to
overcome, any resistance to joint movement and monitoring facial
expressions. Precise localization of the pain or tenderness, however, may be
difficult.
• Babies and toddlers may be better examined on a parent’s lap, especially at the
start of the examination.
The toddler and school-aged child
• Children from <3 years old can volunteer helpful information and attempts to
engage them in friendly discussion will provide reassurance before
examination.
• Engagement of the young child is also optimized with an appropriate
environment that includes freely accessible toys, a play specialist, and relaxed
parents who feel they have been heard.
• Young children might not understand the word pain and parents may help in
the choice of language. Use of a picture or cuddly toy may help to localize the
site of pain and the use of the Faces Pain Scale is a standard tool to indicate
pain intensity, see:
http://www.iasp-pain.org/Education/Content.aspx?
ItemNumber=1519.
• A lot of information can be gained from watching a child at play while history
taking and thereafter all children and toddlers are best approached with

[SECTION]•

•

•
•

confidence and ease.
Beginning with the pGALS as a playful exercise of copying often facilitates
cooperation with the more formal regional exam (see ‘The paediatric GALS
screen’ and also at
http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/health-professionalsand-students/video-resources/pgals.aspx).
Look, feel, and move limbs and joints with careful facial observation and
appropriate reassurance. Swelling may arise from subcutaneous tissues,
tendons, or joints, and may include oedema, lymphoedema, cellulitis, and
haematoma.
Clicking is common and normal unless associated with a jarring or locking
movement.
Pain at end of range of joint movement typically indicates intra-articular
pathology.

Teenagers
• By speaking directly to the young person, a more accurate clinical picture will
be acquired than from speaking to parents alone.
• Direct, friendly questioning will also help engage and optimize examination
and any future appointment.
• Supplemental information from parents may be helpful as may any
discordance between histories.
• Where possible, teenagers should be offered to be seen on their own, with
parents included fully in the consultation thereafter. This is now considered
best practice.
• Explain confidentiality, and respect for privacy and modesty will also promote
trust and optimize clinical assessment.
• Avoid non-verbal signals that appear to judge the individual.
• Identify problems with sleep. Early morning wakening with pain may be
associated with inflammatory or malignant conditions, whereas difficulty with
sleep initiation or maintenance may be associated with chronic pain.
• In particular, insufficient sleep is associated with pain amplification and
reduced resilience.
• In a study of chest pain, only 1 in 300 patients had associated cardiac
pathology which was clearly apparent on examination.
• Over 90% of back pain is benign or biomechanical in nature.
• Frequent associations with chronic pain include bowel, bladder, and
psychological disturbances.

[SECTION]Limp and gait concerns in children and
adolescents
Most cases of limp (an asymmetric gait pattern) present acutely and so are
commonly seen in A&E/emergency room by an orthopaedic surgeon to rule out
infection and malignancy if there are systemic features, or Perthes disease and
slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE) if there are no systemic features. Most
cases of acute limp, however, have a preceding illness and are diagnosed as
irritable hip or transient tenosynovitis. Subacute or long-standing limp or
concerns about gait may present to rheumatologists.
Age-specific assessment
Toddlers and pre-school children
• Review the child with reference to normal development and spend time
observing the gait, first noting normal variants (see pp. 37–39).
• Enquire about age of onset (when onset is at the time of first walking, consider
developmental hip dysplasia).
• Note any preceding illness or trauma.
• Take care not to simply ascribe limp to trauma in the presence of other features
and if the history is incongruent, consider non-accidental injury (NAI) history.
• Immunosuppression may mask sepsis.
• Morning stiffness is typical of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
• Carefully observe foot position when the child is walking for foot and ankle
involvement in JIA.
• Consider that referred pain from the abdomen or groin may be present and
avoid a simple focus on the hip.
• Weakness predominates in neuromuscular conditions and there may have been
slow or even loss of gross motor milestones.
• Localizing pain or tenderness may be difficult for young children and the
young child should be assessed as previously described for pain.
• The soles of the feet should be examined.
School-aged children and adolescents
• An insidious onset of limp is typical of Perthes disease and JIA, the latter
having associated stiffness after prolonged rest.
• Other osteochondroses should also be considered (see Table 16.11).
• Association with exercise and evening predominance is typical of
biomechanical conditions.
• New-onset limp in adolescents raises concerns for chronic SUFE or bone

[SECTION]tumour.
• Hip restriction or pain at the limits of internal or external rotation requires
further investigation.

Pyrexia, fatigue, and unexplained acute-phase
response in children and adolescents
Fever and pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)
• Persistent or intermittent low-grade fever especially when associated with
failure to gain or loss of weight will raise suspicion of malignancy and
multisystem disease, such as SLE.
• Documenting the periodicity of fever may be helpful.
• A subacute fever or PUO (intermittent or persistent fever >38°C for >3 weeks)
may indicate contact with infectious diseases, travel, tick bite exposure,
medication use (‘drug fever’), and sexually acquired infection (in an
adolescent).
• A full systems enquiry should be backed up by a detailed examination
including nailfold capillaries, lymph node assessment, fundoscopy, and cardiac
auscultation.
• ‘Phone photos (taken by the child, adolescent, or parent) of rashes can help in
the assessment of relapsing–remitting rashes and ultimately as a record to
share with other professionals, such as a dermatologist.
Unexplained acute-phase response
• An unexplained erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >15 mm/min has a
differential diagnosis similar to that of fever/PUO and a complete history and
examination is required.
• Persistent increase (over 6–12 weeks) in platelet count and C-reactive protein
(CRP) increases the likelihood of an inflammatory disease being found.
• Biopsy of any suspected lesion can be helpful and whole-body magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) can be a helpful screen for malignancy or to locate
sources of localized inflammation.
• Other causes include renal disease especially when there is azotaemia,
multiple myeloma, and anaemia of chronic disease associated with iron
deficiency.
Fatigue
• It is unclear from what age children report negative experiences of generalized
exhaustion, which as in adults may accompany any illness, but it may be

[SECTION]•

•

reported by parents as a presenting symptom.
It is key to ascertain what is meant by fatigue, differentiating it from lack of
sleep, deconditioning, or specific muscle weakness.
It is important to understand specific concerns of the parent (e.g. a sense of not
being listened to).
Other enquiries should include details about the onset of fatigue, medication,
and appetite.
A full systems enquiry may raise suspicion of active inflammation;
malignancy; endocrine disorder; distress from pain, bowel, or bladder
dysfunction; skin sensitivities; and other functional disorders.
Investigations are usually directed by suspicion of any underlying disorder,
but, as in pain assessment, care should be taken to avoid unnecessary or
endless investigations that prevent effective engagement in a management
plan.
Simple screening tests include inflammatory markers, full blood count (FBC),
thyroid function, and antinuclear antibody (ANA).

The paediatric GALS screen
The adult GALS MSK disease screening examination has been modified to a
paediatric form (pGALS) to facilitate engagement of patients as young as 2 years
and to account for subtleties in joint restriction of joints typically involved in
JIA.
• Limbs should be adequately exposed to permit full examination and the
pGALS is demonstrated by the doctor facing the patient and encouraging them
to copy. In this way, a full screening joint examination can be played out as a
game without touching the patient initially, thereby building rapport and
patient confidence.
• Gait examination is discussed in detail in pp. 37–39.
• Supplemental to neck examination is range of motion and asymmetry of jaw
opening. Temporomandibular joint movement should allow three fingers of the
patient’s hand to be held vertically in their open mouth.
• Joint movement restriction is a sign of disease activity in JIA conditions. As a
result, where JIA is suspected, increased attention should be paid to flexion at
all finger joints, extension of the elbow, and inversion and eversion of the foot,
checking subtalar and midfoot joints.

Musculoskeletal assessment and patterns of
disease: making a working diagnosis
Introduction
Musculoskeletal (MSK) features not to be missed
Assessment of children and adolescents
Assessment of patterns of MSK features in adults

Introduction
• When evaluating a person—child or adult—with focal or widespread pain, it is
important to consider that the pain may be derived from joints. Sometimes it
won’t be obvious. MSK pain may arise from joints (disease of synovium,
cartilage, or bone) but also entheses, tendons, muscles, or a combination of
structures, or can be referred from site to site (usually from proximal to distal),
or can be associated with/secondary to neurogenic lesions. Patterns of
presentation of pain can be useful pointers to diagnosis.
• More than one in five general practitioner (GP) consultations are for patients
with MSK problems, with osteoarthritis (OA) the most common cause of
chronic pain and restricted activity in the over 50s.
• MSK pain is the presenting symptom in 6–13% of consultations in paediatric
primary care with additional consultations for concerns about gait, swelling,
and weakness.
• MSK pain in the paediatric population is common and its prevalence increases
with age. Chronic severe pain, lasting >3 months and affecting quality of life,
is common too, with a prevalence of up to 16% in secondary school-aged girls.
• The majority of causes (>80%) of MSK pains are self-limiting and have
minimal impact on quality of life. In this respect, pain is not a sensitive marker
of disease yet it is still important to provide reassurance to avoid symptom
amplification and prolonged disability.

[SECTION]• But also, MSK pain can be a presenting feature of conditions not to be missed
and other long-term conditions that may result in tissue damage or
significantly affect participation and quality of life.
• The challenge is to understand pain in the context of other symptoms and
signs. Many diagnoses can be made without investigations.
• To categorize the approach to assessment, we have subclassified the patterns
of pain/disease into:
• features/conditions not to be missed.
• normal variants.
• inflammatory arthritis.
• non-inflammatory MSK pain.
• To help in the assessment of inflammatory arthritis, we have categorized by
age, number of joints, and by joint number. Although not the convention in
paediatrics, we have taken a threshold of 3 joints to define multi-articular
involvement:
• mono/oligoarticular arthritis in children (1–2 joints).
• monoarthritis in adults.
• oligoarthritis in adults.
• poly-articular arthritis in children (≥3 joints).
• poly-articular arthritis in adults.
• arthritis and systemic features (children and adolescents).
• Widespread pains are also the presenting feature of chronic pain syndromes.

Musculoskeletal (MSK) features not to be missed
(that may be indicative of serious disease)
General considerations
Among the many MSK, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases that present to
rheumatologists, some require prompt intervention including life-threatening
conditions: cancer, infection, and non-accidental injury (NAI) in children and
vulnerable adults (Box 2.1). Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is
included here due to the level of associated incapacitation and early intervention
being essential.
Box 2.1 Conditions ‘not to be missed’ in children and adolescents
Key features that may indicate these conditions include systemic symptoms, a
history of trauma that does not adequately explain examination findings, focal

[SECTION]unexplained bone pain and tenderness lasting more than a few weeks, and in
children marked disability or loss of developmental milestones.
• Septic arthritis, osteomyelitis
• Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, lymphoma
• Bone tumours (e.g. sarcoma)
• Neuroblastoma in children
• NAI
• CRPS.
• Unexplained and persistent focal pain and bony tenderness in children is a ‘red
flag’. Such pain lasting more than 2 weeks raises the suspicion of bone
cancers.
• ‘Focal’ means able to clearly point to the site of bone pain or tenderness and is
often associated with a limp or disability, and where the pain cannot be
explained by osteochondroses, trauma, or infection.
• In children, bone cancers are typically associated with weight loss and fatigue.
Early metastasization is associated with increased mortality necessitating early
recognition.
Key features which should trigger referral for further assessment in
children and adolescents
• Limp (see also ‘Assessment of the limping child’ pp. 37–39).
• Persistent localized (unilateral) pain through the night.
• Joint restriction or persistent joint swelling.
• Impaired functional ability.
• School absence or teacher concern.
• Morning symptoms unexplained by the previous day activities and tiredness
after disturbed sleep.
• Widespread pain.
• Worrying thoughts or anxiety of the patient or parent.
• Systemic features such as fever, malaise, anorexia, weight loss, rash, raised
acute-phase response and abnormal growth or development. For example,
these features might lead to disclosure of:
• septic arthritis or osteomyelitis (high fever, hot and tender joint, or limb
pain).
• leukaemia, lymphoma neuroblastoma, lupus, or vasculitis (persistent >2
weeks of low-grade fever typically associated with a rash).
• Kawasaki disease (high spiking fever in under 6s with limb pains).
• multisystem inflammatory disorders.

[SECTION]•

•
•

•

•

•

•

• reactive arthritis.
• chronic infections including tuberculosis (TB) (travel history and contact
tracing is important).
• other reactive illnesses with or without clear infection (e.g. Lyme disease,
Streptococcus, Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP)); in all of these, the
presence of rash may be indicative of diagnosis.
A history of trauma incongruent with exam findings could be consistent with
NAI or CRPS. In NAI, the mechanism of injury may not explain its extent or
severity, and should be discussed with a paediatrician or lead clinician. In
CRPS, there is frequently a history of minor trauma.
Reported loss of milestones.
Loss of peer or social contact or significant reduction in physical activity.
These changes should not be dismissed as behavioural or anxiety induced
(whether parent or child) without plans for a timely review of resolution or
progression.
Suspicion of neuromuscular disease. The onset of muscular dystrophies,
congenital and metabolic myopathies, and neuropathies are often insidious in
onset. Muscle weakness, muscle fatigue, numbness, and delayed development
predominate but may be associated with widespread or focal pain that is the
presenting feature.
Suspected problems with pain processing. Notably CRPS, juvenile
fibromyalgia, and sensory integration-autistic spectrum and anxiety disorders
can be associated with very high levels of disability due to altered pain
processing. There can be complete school absence and grossly abnormal sleep
routines attributed to pain.
Hypermobility with widespread pain. Hypermobility does not indicate the
cause of the pain. Care must be taken when using the term ‘hypermobility’ as
it can be perceived as disabling with a poor outcome. The cause of pain is
often complex, but with effective communication and a range of integrated
strategies that includes a focus on self-management and resilience, the
outcome will be excellent with full participation in a normal quality of life.
In considering the above-listed features, which should prompt further referral,
there are other key points which may be helpful in the assessment:
• Attributing pain to non-specific trauma or sprain or internal disruption of the
joint can be reassessed after 2–3 weeks to see if it has resolved.
• Arthritis is commonly associated with persistent and prolonged morning
stiffness and joint restriction. Pain is not a major feature and any report of
joint swelling unreliable.
• Bone lesions are indicated by pain and focal tenderness often with consistent

[SECTION]•

•

•
•
•

symptoms at night. Pain is often intense (e.g. osteoid osteoma or leukaemia
with marrow involvement).
Pain from muscle lesions localize well to the affected muscle. Functional
weakness, not attributable to fear of movement from pain, may be indicated
by walking on tiptoes and difficulties climbing stairs, and putting on T-shirts
or jumpers.
Lesions from ligaments, tendons, and entheses may be difficult to establish
due to the symptoms they cause coexisting with symptoms from associated
muscle and bone lesions.
Focal tenderness may be revealing, particularly at entheses including the
heel, patella, anterior superior iliac spine, and plantar fascia.
Entheseal and ligamentous pain can be intense and often seemingly
disproportionate to examination findings.
Weight falling across centiles or unexplained weight loss >5% in an
adolescent needs detailed assessment.

Key features to identify prompting further urgent rheumatological
assessment—adults
For non-rheumatologists, generally the more systemic features present
associated with MSK symptoms, the more the need to obtain urgent assessment:
• Fevers and sweats can indicate sinister disease but can denote infection and
both autoinflammatory and autoimmune disease.
• Fever and sweats can accompany severe gout or vasculitis, including GCA in
the elderly.
• Arthralgias and myalgias can be part of a paraneoplastic syndrome—however,
features are not specific and the condition is rare.
• Most rheumatologists would consider obtaining an extensive panel of lab
investigations and chest X-ray (CXR) in patients with severe MSK symptoms
and systemic features.
• Systemic features in the context of a positive ANA require that a thorough
examination is done and urinalysis obtained to rule out renal disease
associated with SLE.
• Severe pain and swelling in a joint with or without systemic features requires
prompt assessment, and aspiration of fluid from the joint for Gram stain,
culture, and polarized light microscopy (?crystals).
• Incipient cord compression can present with progressive stiffness and limb
weakness without pain. Such ‘neurological’ stiffness reported as a symptom, is
a mimic of stiffness from symptoms associated with peripheral MSK lesions.
Key features necessitating timely rheumatological referral—adults

[SECTION]Many healthcare systems do operate a basic MSK service in primary care setting
to support primary care doctors in managing the extensive amount benign/selflimiting of MSK disease seen. However, all systems sensibly require triage
processes to promptly identify patients that require prompt onward referral to a
rheumatologist:
• Key symptoms to identify and why:
• Multiple small joint pain/stiffness—might be RA which requires early
treatment to reduce permanent joint damage and disability.
• Inflammatory back pain (see Chapter 8)—which can predict the presence
of axSpA/AS.
• Systemic symptoms plus positive ANA might be an autoimmune connective
tissue disease (e.g. SLE) which can in some patients cause serious organ
disease.
• Severe unexplained temporal head pain and/or scalp sensitivity and/or
amaurosis fugax with high CRP or ESR—might be GCA and require prompt
steroid treatment.
• A pragmatic way of screening for inflammatory small joint arthritis has been
adopted as an educational initiative by The UK Royal College of General
Practitioners. The 3 ‘Ss’: Stiffness, Swelling, and a positive Squeeze test (pain
elicited by squeezing the knuckles).
• Insidious cord compression can present with progressive stiffness and limb
weakness without pain. Such ‘neurological’ stiffness is a mimic of ‘MSK’
stiffness.
• Gout and septic arthritis can look exactly the same—so aspirate!
• Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)-type symptoms can be the predominant type
of MSK symptomology in a number of conditions including pyrophosphate
arthritis, psoriasis-related MSK disease, axSpA, and autoimmune connective
tissue diseases. A wise GP considers the condition a symptom-complex which
may have an underlying disease explanation.

Infectious features
• The features of a reactive arthritis may include preceding symptoms of a viral
infection such as coryza or non-specific rash.
• Other viral features include ‘slapped cheek’ of parvovirus, a widespread and
facial macular rash of rubella, and sore throat of mumps, although these are
rarely seen due to vaccination. In this respect, a vaccination history is
required.
• Vaccinations may be associated with arthralgia and myalgia but are not
associated with the development of JIA.
• A non-SpA reactive arthritis is usually short lived, typically 3–6 weeks in
duration although may be up to 8 weeks. However, a uniphasic reactive
arthritis in a child who is human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positive (with
related features such as conjunctivitis, urethritis, psoriasiform rash) may be
considerably longer. In this situation, there is typically a history of diarrhoea in
children.
• Associated diarrhoea, especially bloody diarrhoea and a fever, should alert to
enteric organisms such as Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, and Salmonella,
which may be cultured from the stool.
• Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile are also known to trigger a reactive
arthritis.
• Post-streptococcal arthritis is typically associated with a sore throat without
cough and a very painful, marginally swollen, often flitting polyarthritis.
Mucocutaneous features may include rash of scarlet fever and strawberry
tongue.
• Acute rheumatic fever (RhF) should also be considered with the above-listed
features (see
Chapter 17) and additional clinical features may include
erythema marginatum, skin nodules, a pericardial rub or new-onset murmur
(and prolonged ECG PR interval), and chorea.
• In moderate- to high-risk incidence populations there are newly revised
international guidelines for the diagnosis of RhF (2015 Statement of American

[SECTION]Heart Association). Low risk is an incidence of RhF <2 per 100,000 schoolaged children or all-age prevalence of rheumatic heart disease <1 per 1000.
New criteria include echocardiographic and Doppler findings and
monoarthritis and polyarthralgia as major criteria.
History of trauma
• Trauma is common and often the event that draws attention to an already
swollen joint.
• Haemarthrosis from internal joint disruption or periarticular swelling from
quadriceps contusion or tear occurs within 2 hours of trauma.
• Trauma may include a penetrating injury with a punctum from a blackthorn or
similar foreign body.
• A mechanism of injury incongruous with examination findings may raise
suspicion of NAI or CRPS (see Chapter 22).
Systems enquiry and past medical history
• May indicate features of coeliac or IBD or raise suspicion of multisystem
inflammatory disorders such as SLE or vasculitis.
• Other conditions associated with an increased risk of arthritis include cystic
fibrosis, coeliac disease, Down’s syndrome, and other genetic conditions.
Family history
• Enquire about arthritides including axSpA/AS and related conditions such as
IBD, psoriasis, and previous iritis.
• Patients may volunteer haemophilia, FMF, SLE, and other autoimmune
diseases.
• The family history is also very helpful in raising parental or patient worries
about cancer or perceptions about arthritis or joint pains as witnessed in an
older family member who may have RA, osteoarthritis, or fibromyalgia or
other conditions.
Travel history and infectious contacts
• Previous travel history may raise suspicion of TB, Salmonella, and other
enteric organisms.
• Travel history should incorporate enquiry about unusual infections such as
brucellosis and leishmaniosis from endemic areas. Enquiry about consumption
of unpasteurized milk products may be helpful.
• Insect bites and contact with tics including travel to endemic rural areas may
lead to consideration of Lyme disease (see Chapter 17) and other conditions.
• Scratches from a cat and associated lymphadenitis or lymphangina is

[SECTION]suggestive of Bartonella infection.
Response to medication
• The outcome of medication use can be viewed as a ‘test’ in itself. Results of
the ‘test’ will help guide future management.
• Failure to respond to intra-articular steroids can raise the suspicion of
undiagnosed TB and PVNS.
Examination
• Routine examination should include height and weight and a well-practised
paediatric pGALS (see Chapter 1).
• Observe the child at play first and respect the privacy of adolescents.
• Be attentive of and reassuring about painful movements.
• pGALS is a quick, excellent screening tool for joint restriction, often key to
finding multiple joint involvement when just 1 or 2 joints were initially
suspected. It is also a valuable and playful way of engaging a younger child in
examination without touching the child and avoiding distress.
• Even subtle differences in range of motion may signify synovial thickening.
• Any doubt about the presence of synovitis can be addressed with ultrasound
(or MRI, as directed later in this section).
Regional MSK examination
• Subsequent assessment should include comparison of both sides, assessment
for muscle wasting, scars, deformity, tenosynovitis, enthesitis, and spinal and
hip disease.
• Muscle wasting, a clear sign of chronicity, typically affects vastus medialis
with knee involvement and calf with ankle involvement. Upper limb muscle
wasting is usually less prominent than in adults.
• Tenosynovitis is more commonly seen around the ankle, but may be
mechanical in origin rather than inflammatory. It is not associated with any
specific subtype of JIA.
• Involvement of the tendons of the hand may result in trigger finger.
• Enthesitis discriminates enthesitis-related arthritis from other forms of JIA;
areas of tenderness include Achilles’ insertion, patellar tendon, attachment of
quads and hamstrings to pelvis, and plantar fascia.
• Examination of the spine should include the Schöber test of spinal drift in
enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA; see
Chapter 9) and distraction of the
sacroiliac joints (with four quadrant test) to illicit any discomfort of these
joints.

[SECTION]Characteristic rashes
• Psoriasis and associated nail pits (see Chapter 8).
• Palmar pustulosis and acne of SAPHO (see Chapter 8).
• Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP; see Chapter 18).
• Erythema chronicum migrans of Lyme disease (see Chapter 17).
• Erythema marginatum.
• Erythema nodosum of vasculitis and sarcoid (see
Chapters 15 and 18,
respectively).
• Lipodystrophy and/or skin thickening with pink halo in scleroderma.
• Other vasculitic rashes especially involving the palm or finger tips.
• Nail bed capillary changes of systemic sclerosis (SScl), SLE, and autoimmune
overlap conditions.
Investigations: imaging
It is recommended that imaging should be discussed with a radiologist whenever
possible:
• Ultrasound (US) can be helpful when exam findings are equivocal.
• But US is associated with a high false-negative rate in routine clinical
situations especially for feet, ankles, and small joints of the hand.
• US can pick up early erosions that may guide changes in medication.
• MRI may be less available or immediate but is better for demonstrating
chondral changes and bone and entheseal oedema. It has a very low falsenegative rate for synovitis and low false-positive rate when using gadolinium
enhancement.
• MRI is the investigation of choice for pelvic and spinal assessment and has
characteristic findings for PVNS.
• Radiographs can be helpful when suspicious of skeletal dysplasia or metabolic
bone disease (including rickets and scurvy) and for assessing bone
mineralization.
• Radiographs may also demonstrate periarticular osteopenia, erosions, and
loose bodies of osteochondritis although US is the preferred investigation in
this circumstance.
• DXA scanning grades bone mass (BMD) against average expected but data
needs adjustment for bone growth and pubertal changes (bone mineral
apparent density (BMAD)). A number of approaches to data correction exist,
but should be interpreted with caution.
• When malignancy or infection is suspected, a whole-body MRI (+fat
suppression sequences) may be helpful, and has replaced bone scintigraphy
and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography–

[SECTION]computed tomography (PET-CT) scans, which impart high radiation.
• Whole-body MRI is also used when non-bacterial osteomyelitis (including
CRMO and SAPHO (see
Chapter 18 and Chapter 8, respectively) is
suspected.
Laboratory tests
• Autoimmune serology is helpful in multisystem inflammatory disorders but
not typically in JIA, for which there are no diagnostic tests.
• ANA is not diagnostic. It is now considered a risk factor for uveitis although
eye inflammation still occurs in those who are ANA negative. Further research
into the value of testing ANA is ongoing.
• ESR and FBC may be normal in active JIA.
• Thrombocytosis is common in most inflammatory conditions and can be very
high in systemic-onset JIA, along with neutrophilia.
• Platelet and lymphocyte counts are commonly low in juvenile SLE and
antiphospholipid syndrome.
• A low platelet and neutrophil count in the presence of raised inflammatory
markers and arthritis may indicate malignancy.
• A high neutrophil count—especially with ‘bands’ on film inspection—may
indicate infection.
• Interpretation of antistreptolysin O titre (ASOT) can be difficult. The most
reliable clinical feature for streptococcal infection is sore throat without cough.
Serial ASOT are required and combined measurement of anti-streptococcal
DNAseB and streptozyme may be helpful.
• Rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive polyarticular JIA occurs in <5% of JIA and
has a characteristic symmetrical appearance. RF should not be considered a
routine test and is more likely to be misinterpreted when falsely positive.
• Lyme serology should only be requested in keeping with Lyme disease
diagnostic guidelines (see Chapter 17).
• For suspected TB, interferon- γ assays (IGRA), CXR, and Mantoux tests are
important if synovial aspiration for culture is not done.
Joint aspiration and synovial biopsy
Care should be taken to avoid psychological trauma when undertaking this
procedure as it may lead to loss of trust and future problems with venesection,
routine examination, as well as repeat steroid injection.
• Joint injections may be done under general anaesthesia or with the aid of
inhaled agents such as Entonox®.
• Joint aspiration for Gram stain and culture is the investigation of choice for

[SECTION]•

septic arthritis and when considering TB synovitis.
In some centres, synovial fluid cell differentials can be determined which may
be helpful in differentiating between low-grade sepsis and autoimmunity.
Bloody taps are common but if the blood runs through the whole of the
sample, haemarthrosis should be considered and may be attributable to trauma,
bleeding diathesis, PVNS, or haemangioma.
Crystal arthropathy is very rare in children and adolescents and is not a
common presentation of hyperuricaemia.
Synovial biopsy is helpful when considering PVNS, sarcoid, chronic
infections, and malignancy. Arthroscopic biopsy has a higher yield than needle
biopsy.

Assessment of gait and the limping child
The normal gait is a complex automatic process that in a child requires
development of muscles, bones, joints, and ligaments effectively controlled and
coordinated by the neurological system. Imbalances in any of this process will
lead to problems but in general, a delayed gait is usually attributable to slower
cephalocaudal myelinization of normal development. It is inappropriate to
ascribe hypermobility or hypotonia to this delay or related problems with
balance and coordination. Slower development may be perceived as a problem,
but is not a medical disorder. Catch up with peers takes time and the finer
adjustments to the gait pattern may not occur until the child is 8–10 years of age.
A simple view of normal gait includes a:
• Stance phase starting with the heel strike, progressing through plantar-flexion
to toe-off. Assessment also looks at base width and single-limb support time.
• Swing phase from toe-off to heel strike with forward rotation and tilting of the
pelvis and a stable lumbar spine and abdomen. Assessment also includes
cadence and stride length.
Assessment of a limp
A limp is an asymmetric gait, but many people interpret other abnormalities of
gait as a limp. Some abnormalities of gait are listed as follows. Examples of
causes of limp in children attending A&E are shown in Table 2.3.
• Antalgic gait results from pain or stiffness leading to a shorter stance phase.
• Trendelenburg limp or gait is attributable to weak hip abduction causing a
body sway in stance phase and a droop of the hip in the swing phase.
• Waddling gait is attributable to neuromuscular or articular stiffness around the
pelvis.
• Stiff-legged (peg-leg) gait results from loss of knee flexion and circumduction

with pelvic elevation on the affected side.
Toe walking may be habitual, typically resolving at 3 years or may be due to
muscle contractures or spasticity. Check whether the child can heel strike
when concentrating. Unilateral toe walking may indicate a lower-extremity
length inequality or be from a wound to the heel.
High stepping gait may result from difficulties with dorsiflexion of the foot,
usually associated with peroneal neuropathies lower motor neuron
neurological disease (e.g. spina bifida, polio) and peripheral neuropathies (e.g.
hereditary motor sensory neuropathy I/II).
Stooped gait might indicate abdominal pathology.
Clumsy gait is often described but rarely seen in formal assessment. It is in
part the result of inattention and may also be from subtle physiological
developmental delay (often associated with handwriting difficulties and
learning delay or disability). May include more frank neurodevelopmental or
metabolic disorders.
Ataxic gait.

Further gait assessment
Should follow general MSK assessment plus:
• Localize site of pathology (and include back and abdomen; see Chapter 3)—
20% of limps are not associated with pain.
• Look for biomechanical imbalances.
• Trivial injury or trauma may be unwitnessed and toddler fractures missed on
conventional radiographs.
• Incongruence or inconsistency in history raises suspicion of NAI.
• Consider sports-related injuries and overuse syndromes.
• Neurovascular status, including strength, sensation, and reflexes, can also be
assessed while the child is sitting or supine.
• Measure and compare lower-extremity lengths.
• Walk, run, and hop allow assessment of coordination, strength, and bring out
subtle abnormality and provide developmental assessment.
• Also assess skin, sole of feet, nails, and shoes.
Assessment of muscle pain and weakness in children and adolescents
Changes in gait, and difficulty climbing stairs and putting on jumpers or T-shirts
may be attributable to muscle pain or weakness.
• In the history of acute muscle pain there should be enquiry about trauma,
previous biomechanical muscle pains, preceding viral infection, and fever and
site.
• Benign myositis of childhood is a transient illness that typically presents with
calf pain in the 4–10-year-old age range 3 days after onset of fever and is
associated with a high creatine kinase (CK). Guillain–Barré syndrome also
affects distal muscles and follows certain viral or bacterial infections but will
be associated with gradual progression, marked weakness, sensory symptoms,
and normal CK.
• Chronic myositis may also be associated with a low-grade fever, muscle
tenderness and high CK.
• Juvenile dermatomyositis, SLE, pyomyositis, and some periodic fevers with

[SECTION]myalgia will have characteristic rashes.
• Non-inflammatory causes of muscle weakness include neuromuscular
conditions, such as muscular dystrophies, that are progressive with loss of
motor milestones; upper motor neuron lesions including spinal compression
with increased reflexes; or anterior horn cell conditions, neuropathies, and
metabolic muscle disease with absent reflexes. These conditions rarely cause
muscle tenderness.
• Muscle weakness and Trendelenburg gait are also seen in gross deconditioning
from sedentary behaviour and chronic pain conditions. Tenderness is common
along with symptomatic deterioration towards the end of the day.
• Widespread myalgias of juvenile fibromyalgia and enthesitis may be confused
with each other.
Joint pains with systemic features in children and adolescents
Where there is fever, rash, and arthritis, diagnoses other than systemic-onset JIA
(SoJIA; previously known as Still’s disease) ought to be considered first and
before a trial of steroids which will mask infections, malignancy, and Kawasaki
disease.
• Travel, infection contact, social, and family histories are vital in terms of
disclosing a history suggestive of infection.
• There should be a full enquiry about symptoms referable to each organ system,
which may point to a diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory disease.
• Characterizing the fever, including fluctuation throughout the day, periodicity,
and duration may be diagnostic of SoJIA, Kawasaki disease, and specific
periodic fevers (see Chapter 18).
• A ‘quotidian’ fever occurring once or twice a day with return to baseline is
characteristic of SoJIA, Kawasaki disease has a high spiking fever for at least
5 days. For periodic fevers see Chapter 18.
• Look for and characterize any rash. This may facilitate diagnoses of SoJIA for
which there are multiple typical rashes, lupus, dermatomyositis, periodic
fevers and vasculitis. Other important rashes are those of pyoderma and
neutrophilic dermatoses, scleroderma, and Behçet’s disease; all may need
distinguishing from viral exanthems and fungal infection.
• Ocular features may include red eye, pain, double vision, photophobia, and
blurring.
• Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) features may include sinusitis, crusting, bloody
discharge, tinnitus, hearing loss, facial weakness, oral ulceration, sore throat,
parotitis, and dry mouth.
Non-inflammatory MSK conditions in children and adolescents

[SECTION](See also Box 2.2.)
Principles of diagnosis
• Biomechanical and non-inflammatory pain is very common in healthy children
and adolescents and is by far the commonest cause of MSK pain.
• Hypermobility in the normal population is common and care should be taken
before ascribing focal or widespread MSK pain to the hypermobility
syndrome/Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) type 3. Inappropriate/over-zealous
use of the diagnostic label can reflect a misunderstanding of the multifactorial
nature of MSK pain and project a ‘disabling’ rather than ‘enabling’
formulation onto patients. In turn, this can lead to parental confusion, a lack of
flexibility over treatment strategies, and excess disability.
• Biomechanical pain typically increases with activity and occurs in the evening
or following morning or two after increased physical activity. It may be
associated with stiffness at these times.
• Biomechanical pain may be associated with minor swelling and tenderness and
may occur with inflammatory or other conditions. It commonly occurs with
chronic arthritis due to muscle and joint inhibition from active inflammation
and subsequent MSK imbalance.
• Focal bone pain occurs with osteochondroses and osteoid osteoma and
although very rare, osteosarcomas should be considered in the absence of
typical features of an osteochondrosis.
• Neuromuscular conditions manifest by weakness may present with (often
initially focal) pain.
Contributory factors to chronic non-inflammatory MSK pains and their
impact
• MSK imbalance—from tight and/or weak musculature or ligaments
(patellofemoral syndrome is an example).
• General deconditioning—whether through overall lack of background
effective physical activity, excess sedentary behaviour, or avoidance of activity
due to pain.
• Repetitive physical activity in the presence of suboptimal muscular control.
• Subchondral or other bony stress.
• Features of gross motor development (including proprioception) which are
slower than global development or development of peers and siblings—
development requires nerve myelination and neuromuscular imprinting, so
practice will not improve rate of change (as occurs with nocturnal enuresis).
• The pace of proprioceptive movement programming, which continues to

develop until puberty.
Suboptimal strength for range of joint movement (as with some hypermobile
joints).
Adverse gait or other patterns of movement including tracking of patella. For
example, gait maturation and improvements in gait efficiency continue until
after skeletal maturity.
A ‘boom and bust’ approach to physical activity.
Loss of confidence in specific movements.
Difficulties in pain self-appraisal.
Central and peripheral pain pathway (or neuromatrix) sensitization.
Difficulties with background sensory processing as occurs in patients with
autistic spectrum disorders.
Ruminating or attentive behaviours.
Reinforcing parental or other family member responses.
Social and environmental factors including those at school.

Notable features in the history (‘pearls’)
• Osteochondroses develop gradually and are associated with pain and
tenderness at typical tendon insertion or joint sites.
• Locking or gelling of a joint may indicate an osteochondritis dissecans lesion
(typically elbow, knee, ankle).
• Weakness may be indicated by difficulty climbing stairs, or getting up from
the floor (e.g. at school assembly).
• Non-participation in physical education lessons, extracurricular sport, and
other physical activity may indicate either a significant impact of a condition
or general deconditioning and reflect cycles of behaviour in response to pain.
• Disruption at the hip may present as insidious onset of knee pain or limp. This
includes Perthes disease in children aged 4–10 years and subacute SUFE in
peripubertal adolescents with an increased incidence in those overweight.
• With respect to knee joint pain/lesions:
• Meniscal tears are associated with an acute event.
• Cruciate ligament tears are also associated with acute trauma and there may
be a history of popping within the knee and immediate swelling.
• Skeletal dysplasias may present with limb pain and deformity but usually
present with a family history and disproportionate short stature or in the case
of osteogenesis imperfecta, fractures. Occasionally, suspicion arises when
polyarthropathy fails to respond to conventional treatments for arthritis and
bilateral hip dysplasia or Perthes disease.
Other aspects of the history
• Typical features which might suggest a functional disorder include irritable
bowel syndrome, dizziness, paraesthesiae, headaches, and bladder dysfunction.
• Family history may indicate other painful conditions but these are very
unlikely to be genetically related other than through body type and patterns of
movement and behaviour.
• Response to medication will help to guide future management.

[SECTION]• Engagement with, and response to, other treatments including physiotherapy,
osteopathy, and complementary therapies will also help guide future
management.
• Assessment of ‘engagement’ includes an understanding of the patient’s
cooperation with home exercise programmes and this can be correlated with
exam findings (e.g. persistence of tight musculature or specific areas of
deconditioning).
Examination: general
• Routine examination should include measuring height and weight and a
pGALS (see Chapter 1).
• There should be a general assessment of conditioning and posture, which
includes the presence of spinal contour noting any hyperlordosis or loss of
lordosis.
• Gait has predictive patterns (see also ‘Gait assessment’, pp. 37–39):
• Note any antalgic gait from trauma or inflammation.
• A Trendelenburg or waddling gait can occur from hip abductor weakness
from neuromuscular disorders or hip joint disorders.
• Circumduction gait from hemiplegia or leg length discrepancy attributable
to chronic knee synovitis (see Plate 1).
• Ataxia due to neurological involvement.
• Toe walking—if unilateral or not correctable with advice, upper motor
neuron or lysosomal disorders should be considered.
• Weakness can be assessed though the Gower sign in a younger child, rising out
of a chair without use of upper limbs, sustained neck flexor strength, and
winging of scapulae when pushing against a wall.
• Regional MSK assessment is described in Chapter 3 and is usually key to
diagnosis and management of non-inflammatory conditions.
• Regional examination should include assessment of adjacent regions given the
functional connection between regions.
Investigations: imaging
The principles of imaging in young children are to minimize procedure time and
radiation exposure wherever possible and to request imaging judiciously
following discussion with a paediatric radiologist.
• Radiographs are often normal in early joint inflammation, but they are the
investigation of choice if considering periosteal lesions, traumatic or stress
fractures, mineralization defects (e.g. rickets), or major structural conditions
such as skeletal dysplasia.

[SECTION]• Consider US if there is likelihood of joint/tendon synovitis, an osteochondral
lesion, or a ligament, enthesis, or tendon lesion.
• MRI and further radiological investigation may include assessment of any
organ, especially for feet and ankles, hips, and spine.
• Where there is a pyrexia of unknown origin or similar broad differential
diagnosis, whole-body MRI (with fat suppressed sequences) may be helpful.
Investigations: laboratory tests
• All investigations should be performed with a clear understanding of how to
interpret the results and specific tests (such as serology for multisystem
disorders, Streptococcus, Borrelia, etc.) should be interpreted according to the
pre-test probability.
• Weak positive results for lupus anticoagulant, RF, ANA, ENA, and ASOT may
need repeating.
• Serological tests should also be interpreted with caution after immunoglobulin
infusions or serious infections and HIV.
Chronic pain without identifiable MSK abnormalities in children and
adolescents
Key considerations
Chronic pain is defined (for research purposes) as the presence of pain or
discomfort for >3 months. This may be continuous in the same location or
intermittent. This may be a useful definition for clinical purposes and to help
raise chronic pain syndromes or disorders in the differential diagnosis.
• In most circumstances, there is a characteristic history and examination
findings and a positive diagnosis should be made. This does not require
investigation.
• Treating these conditions as diagnoses of exclusion tends to undermine the
diagnosis and raise suspicion in the patient or parent that sufficient
investigation has not been done to rule out alternative causes of pain.
• If investigations are ordered, the exact purpose of this investigation should be
explained and should be framed in the context of a positive diagnosis.
• In children and adolescents, both local, or regional, and widespread chronic
pain occurs. This includes the current terminology of complex regional pain
syndrome (CRPS) and juvenile fibromyalgia (FM), both pain processing or
neuromatrix problems. There should be guarded use of these terminologies as
there is a far better prognosis in children and adolescents than in adults and use
of such terms may lead to unintended interpretations.
• The commonest cause of regional and widespread pain, however, remains

[SECTION]•
•

•

•
•

•

•

biomechanical problems typically associated with growth and development.
This includes benign nocturnal limb pains of childhood.
It is likely that patients will have seen other professionals and at the beginning
the patient or parent should be asked what they hope from the consultation.
Localized pain such as CRPS is typically associated with an episode of minor
trauma (major trauma is usually associated with high levels of appraisal and
adjustment) in circumstances that may be challenging or alarming (e.g.
unanticipated summersault on a trampoline, unexpected fall, excessively
boisterous play, road traffic accident, or the presence of exhaustion from lack
of sleep or heat stroke).
The pain often builds up over time and the source of pain is considered
mysterious and unexplained to patient and/or parent. This is frequently
compounded by inconsistent assessment and explanation by health
professionals and by agitating family members or friends.
Widespread idiopathic pain including juvenile FM is usually insidious in onset
with gradual imposition on quality of life over time.
The levels of disability and distress for both localized and widespread chronic
pain are usually well in excess of the clinical findings from history and
examination, but should not be dismissed.
The needs of patients with chronic pain should be clearly identified to help
direct an effective treatment strategy that often requires a multidisciplinary
approach (input from experienced physiotherapist, occupational therapist
(OT), and psychologist).
The role of medication is unclear and if used, medicine use should be closely
monitored for benefit and side effects. Medication tends to be most effective
when used to support engagement with other physical and psychological
therapeutic strategies.

Assessment of patterns of MSK features in adults
When evaluating an adult with joint, tendon, and muscle problems, it helps to
initially consider what is normal variation and what is abnormal and, in the case
of joint pains, the likely number of joints involved. Whether monoarticular (1
joint), oligoarticular (2–3 joints), or polyarticular (>3 joints) will influence the
initial differential diagnosis and working diagnosis.
• For example, RA can present with monoarthritis but it would be a very unusual
presentation whereas gout in men typically presents as a single site of
inflammation.
• The differential diagnosis generates a working diagnosis which in turns

[SECTION]dictates to a degree what tests are done and in what order.
Normal variants
Normal variant features of MSK origin in children are usually developmental in
origin (see
Table 2.1, p. 32). In adults, varied skeletal morphological
appearances are not usually associated with disease directly, though their
mechanical effects may lead to secondary MSK problems, notably early
degeneration.
• In adults, asymmetric MSK appearances, however, are more likely to represent
relevant pathology.
• Adults can come to clinical attention, reporting noticeable change in MSK
appearance though invariably, such changes, if indeed present at all, but
without pain and other features, are not sinister and rarely indicate serious
disease.
• Adult MSK appearances do vary notably. Typical sites of high variation are
neck length, kyphotic/hyperlordotic lumbar thoracolumbar spine contour,
degree of shoulder protraction, sloping shoulders, degree of elbow valgus,
pelvis width and tilt, degree of femoral anteversion angle, Q-angle at the knee,
degree of tibial torsion, in-toeing/out-turn, and reducible plano-valgus in the
feet.
• Subtle appearances of some MSK structures, however, can indicate an
underlying condition and occasionally are not identified through childhood
and adolescence and lead to (a late) diagnosis of the condition in adulthood
(e.g. trichorhinophalangeal syndrome, hypermobility syndrome/EDS3, and
Scheuermann’s disease).
Monoarticular pain in adults
• Acute pain and swelling of a joint follows intra-articular trauma such as
cruciate or meniscus tears in the knee. History will be key indiscriminating
trauma or spontaneous inflammation; MRI is essential to identify the cause of
trauma.
• Acute inflammatory monoarthritis is commonly due to crystal arthropathies in
the older patient (see Chapter 7), infection (particularly gonococcal in the
younger adult; Chapter 17) or haemarthrosis, the causes of which include
trauma, bleeding disorder, vitamin C deficiency, synovial haemangioma, and
PVNS.
• Aspiration of fluid for Gram stain, culture, and polarized light microscopy is
an early priority of management.
• A fracture across the joint line may also cause an acute monoarthritis. Stress

[SECTION]•

•

•
•
•

•

•

fractures occur as the result of repetitive loading of bone, and can be found
with occupational, recreational, or athletic activities. Stress fractures may be
small and therefore can be missed on plain radiographs; MRI may be more
sensitive and should be considered if the patient is at risk.
Non-gonococcal septic arthritis is particularly important to consider in the
elderly, who may not present with the signs and symptoms expected with
infection. Non-gonococcal septic arthritis is a rheumatological emergency (see
Chapters 17 and 25), and should be treated with intravenous antibiotics
immediately on suspicion.
In the UK, although Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism
causing septic arthritis in the elderly, it is prudent to consider atypical
infections (e.g. Gram negative).
Septic arthritis preferentially occurs in patients with RA, in patients with renal
disease, and immunocompromised patients.
The presence of crystals in monoarticular joint fluid aspirates does not exclude
infection.
Distinguishing a swollen digital joint from a swollen digit is important in
discriminating dactylitis—usually associated with PsA and other
spondyloarthritides.
Not all great toe pain/swelling is gout. The great toe is very commonly
affected in PsA—check if digit is dactylitic and there is nail disease—see
Chapter 8.
Boxing glove-type swelling of a hand is a typical manifestation of calciumcontaining crystal-induced inflammation, particularly calcium pyrophosphate
deposition (CPPD)-pseudogout—on hand radiographs look for the joint space
loss and marked sclerosis of articular surfaces of bones in CPPD of the carpal
joints and chondrocalcinosis in the wrist triangular fibrocartilage complex.

Oligoarticular pain in adults
(See also Table 2.4.)
The assessment of an inflamed joint
• The clinical features of inflammation and pain at any given synovial joint and
the differential diagnosis in the context of other possible regional MSK
diagnoses are discussed in Chapter 3.
• Synovitis is the term given to inflammation of the synovial lining. This
inflammation may be a consequence of a range of cellular processes, and is not
specific for any one diagnosis. Joint effusions often accompany synovitis.
• Inflammation of periarticular tissues may accompany synovitis. Enthesitis

[SECTION](inflammation at a tendon or ligament insertion into bone) or tenosynovitis
(inflammation of the tendon itself) may be the most prominent feature.
History: general points
• Pain and stiffness are typical features of synovitis and enthesitis. Both are
often worse in the morning, or after periods of immobility. The presence or
absence of stiffness does not discriminate between different causes of
synovitis.
• Pain is often severe in acute joint inflammation. In chronic situations, pain
may be less severe (due to mechanisms that increase physical and
psychological tolerance). There are no specific descriptors that discriminate
pain from synovitis or enthesitis.
• Swelling, either due to synovial thickening or effusion, often accompanies
synovitis.
• A patient’s report of swelling is not always reliable. Patients with carpal tunnel
syndrome, for example, will frequently report that their hands are swollen,
even when no swelling is visible.
• Reduced mobility in a joint affected by enthesitis/synovitis is almost universal
regardless of its cause.
Examination: general points
• Swelling may be observed or detected by palpation. Its absence does not rule
out synovitis or enthesitis. Synovial swelling needs to be discriminated from
bony swelling, fat, and other connective tissue swellings (e.g. ganglia, nodules,
etc.). Without imaging or attempting to aspirate joint fluid, it may be difficult
to discriminate synovial thickening from effusion.
• Skin erythema (implying periarticular inflammation) and warmth do not
always accompany joint inflammation, but they are common with crystalline
and septic arthritis. Erythema can also occur in reactive arthritis, rheumatic
fever, and with nascent Heberden’s or Bouchard’s nodes in osteoarthritis (OA;
see Chapter 6).

Chapter

Most common cause Staphylococcus aureus. Associated
with chronic arthritis, joint prostheses, and reduced host
immunity. Peak incidence in elderly. Systemic symptoms
common and sometimes overt. Synovial fluid is Gram +ve
in 50% of cases and culture +ve in 90% of cases

Gonococcal
arthritis (see
Chapter 17)

Age 15–30 yrs in urban populations and with inherited
deficiency of complements C5 to C9. One form presents as
an acute septic monoarthritis. Organism detected by Gram
stain of joint fluid in 25% and by culture in 50% in the
second group

[SECTION]• Tenderness of thickened synovium is common, but is not always present.
Severely tender swelling suggests joint infection, haemarthrosis, or an acute
inflammatory reaction to crystals.
• Inflammation of entheses results in ‘bony’ tenderness at joint margins, and
sites of tendon or ligament insertion.
• Decreased range of motion is almost always demonstrable in a joint affected
by synovitis or enthesitis. The degree to which passive and active range of
motion is reduced depends on a number of often interdependent factors (e.g.
pain, size of effusion, periarticular muscle weakness, or pain).
• Movement of a joint affected by synovitis or enthesitis will induce pain and
stiffness, although neither is specific. Affected joints will demonstrate reduced
range on active or passive range of motion exercises; moving the joint beyond
that point will elicit pain.
• The age, sex, and occupation of the patient give non-specific, but important
clues:
• Oligoarthritis is uncommon in young adults. SpA, especially reactive
arthritis, is likely to be the main cause; 75% of patients who develop
reactive arthritis are <40 years old.
• Gout typically occurs in those >40 years old, and is the most common cause
of inflammatory arthritis in men (self-reported in 1 in 74 men and 1 in 156
women).
• The mean age of patients with CPPD arthritis is about 72 years (range 63–93
years).
• Areas endemic for tick infection (forestation) with Borrelia are at risk of
Lyme arthritis.
History: which joints are affected?
Some processes are more common in certain joints than others:
• Shoulder synovitis is typical in hydroxyapatite arthritis (Milwaukee
shoulder/knee syndrome) and AL amyloidosis (see Chapter 18).
• Involvement of a shoulder or hip is extremely unusual in gout.
• CPPD arthritis (as pseudogout) occurs rarely in the small finger joints (see
Chapter 7).
• The knee is the commonly involved in acute crystalline arthropathy and septic
arthritis (both gonococcal and non-gonococcal).
• Large knee effusions are common with Lyme arthritis, but this is a nonspecific finding. Large effusions can also be seen with septic and psoriatic
arthritis (see Chapter 8).
• In theory, there are many causes of synovitis in a single first

[SECTION]metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, but the majority of cases will be due to gout;
50–70% of first attacks occur in this joint. Care is needed in not mistaking
dactylitis due to PsA for gout.
History: preceding factors
Factors preceding swelling of a single joint or oligoarthritis may be highly
relevant. These include trauma and infection:
• Acute non-traumatic monoarticular synovitis is most commonly due to crystalinduced synovitis or synovitis associated with SpA.
• A preceding history of trauma typically suggests intra-articular fracture
(with/without haemarthrosis), a meniscus tear (knee), or an intra-articular
loose body, such as an osteochondral fragment (which may cause the patient to
complain about a ‘locking’ knee).
• Twinges of joint pain often precede an acute attack of gout. Acute arthritis
(‘pseudogout’) occurs in 25% of patients with CPPD arthritis.
• In hydroxyapatite arthritis, synovitis is usually mild to moderate, gradual in
onset, and typically worse at night.
• An acute monoarthritis with fever in FMF (see Chapter 18) is a mimic of
septic arthritis. Such joint manifestations are present in up to 75% of cases.
• Septic arthritis should always be considered (and promptly ruled out) as a
cause of acute joint swelling (see Chapter 25).
History: family and social history
There may be important clues from the family and social history:
• Both gout and SpA have a familial component. Between 6% and 18% of
patients with gout also have a family history of gout. There may be a family
history of SpA or uveitis in patients who have reactive, psoriatic, or
enteropathic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
• Gout in young adults suggests an inherited abnormality (usually increased
urate production from 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase ‘super’activity, since the other enzyme deficiencies present in childhood).
• Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with gout. Alcohol can also
contribute to lactic acidosis that inhibits urate breakdown.
• Consider Lyme disease if patients live, work, or visit endemic areas; outside of
the United States, this includes Europe, Russia, China, and Japan. Peak
incidence occurs during the summer.
• Brucella arthritis is generally monoarticular and occurs primarily in areas
where domesticated animals are infected and poor methods of animal
husbandry, feeding habits, and hygiene standards coexist.

[SECTION]History: ask about other associated features
Associated extra-articular features include previous eye, gastrointestinal, cardiac,
and genitourinary symptoms:
• Low-grade fever, malaise, and anorexia occur commonly in both septic
arthritis and gout. Marked fever can occur in gout and only occurs in about a
third of patients with septic arthritis.
• Ask about any current or previous features which might suggest SpA:
• back or buttock pain (enthesitis or sacroiliitis).
• swelling of a digit (dactylitis).
• plantar heel pain (plantar fasciitis).
• red eye with irritation (anterior uveitis).
• urethritis, balanitis, cervicitis, recurrent or acute diarrhoea (reactive arthritis)
—be suspicious of previous diagnosis of IBD—ask about getting up at night
to open bowels and passing slime/mucus—both suggestive symptoms for
IBD.
• psoriasis.
• symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
• Behçet’s disease (see Chapter 18) can cause an oligoarthritis. Other features
include painful oral and genital ulcers, and uveitis.
• The involvement of more than one joint does not rule out septic arthritis. In up
to 20% of cases, multiple joints can become infected.
Examination: general
• Always compare sides, to establish if the changes are symmetric or
asymmetric.
• It is important to establish from the examination whether there is true synovial
swelling. A history of swelling is not always reliable and other, non-synovial,
pathology can present with single or oligoarticular joint pain.
Examination of affected joints
Examine the affected joints for tenderness. Check passive range of motion for
evidence of locking or instability:
• Acute processes such as crystal arthritis, infection, and post-traumatic effusion
often lead to painful swelling, marked tenderness of swollen soft tissues, and
painfully restricted active and passive movement of the joint. These features
are usually less overt with chronic arthritis.
• Instability of an acutely inflamed joint or tests for cartilage damage in the knee
may be difficult to demonstrate. Further examination will be necessary after
drainage of joint fluid.

[SECTION]• Detection of enthesis tenderness around the affected joints or at other sites is a
useful clue to the diagnosis of SpA.
Examination of other musculoskeletal structures
• Examine the low back and typical sites of bony tenderness—sacroiliitis and
enthesitis are common features of SpA.
• Tendonitis is not specific and can occur in gout, CPPD arthritis, SpA, and
gonococcal infection.
Examination: look for skin rashes and any inflammation
Oligoarthritis may be part of a systemic inflammatory or infectious condition:
• Temperature and tachycardia can occur with some non-infectious causes of
acute arthritis (e.g. crystal arthritis), although their presence in the context of
oligoarticular joint swelling requires exclusion of joint infection.
• Gouty tophi may be seen in the pinnae and in other peripheral locations. They
can be difficult to discriminate clinically from rheumatoid nodules. Polarized
light microscopy of material obtained by needle aspiration will be diagnostic
for tophi.
• The hallmark of relapsing polychondritis (see Chapter 18) is lobe-sparing,
full-thickness inflammation of the pinna.
• Mouth ulcers are common; however, crops or large painful tongue and buccal
lesions associated with oligoarticular arthritis suggest Behçet’s disease.
• A typical site for the osteitis (tender swelling of bone) of SAPHO syndrome
(see Chapter 16) is around the sternum and clavicles.
• Skin erythema over a joint suggests crystal arthritis or infection.
• Associated skin rashes may include erythema nodosum (associated with
ankle/knee synovitis in acute sarcoid), purpuric pustular rashes (Behçet’s,
gonococcal infection, and SAPHO syndrome), erythema marginatum
(rheumatic fever), or keratoderma blennorrhagica (aggressive-looking rash of
the sole of the foot in sexually acquired reactive arthritis).
• Psoriasis may be associated with both synovitis and enthesitis.
Investigations
The presence of synovitis can be confirmed by obtaining US or MRI of the joints
in question. At larger joints, both are sensitive for the detection of effusion and
synovial thickening. Inflammation at periarticular or capsular entheses can also
be seen.
Laboratory tests: joint fluid
The most important investigation of a patient with monoarticular synovitis is

[SECTION]joint aspiration and prompt examination of fluid. Fluid should be sent in sterile
bottles for microscopy and culture:
• The appearance of synovial fluid is not specific; however, blood or
bloodstaining suggests haemarthrosis from trauma (including the aspiration
attempt), a haemorrhagic diathesis, haemangioma, PVNS, and synovioma.
• Turbidity (decreased clarity) of fluid relates to cellular, crystal, lipid, and
fibrinous content. Synovial fluid in septic arthritis and acute crystal arthritis is
frequently turbid due to the effects of a high number of neutrophils.
• Cell counts give some diagnostic guidance but are non-specific (Table 2.5).
There is a high probability of infection or gout if the neutrophil differential is
>90%.
• Joint fluid eosinophilia is not specific.
• Polarized light microscopy of fluid can discriminate urate (3–20 µm in length,
needle-shaped, and negatively birefringent—blue and then yellow as the red
plate compensator is rotated through 90°) and calcium-containing crystals such
as calcium pyrophosphate (positively birefringent crystals, typically small and
rectangular or rhomboid in shape).
• Lipid and cholesterol crystals are not uncommon in joint fluid samples, but
their significance is unknown.
• Crystals appearing in synovium less commonly, but in typical settings include
hydroxyapatite associated with Milwaukee shoulder (and knee) syndrome
(alizarin red-S stain positive), calcium oxalate in end-stage renal failure on
dialysis (may need scanning electron microscopy to confirm), cystine in
cystinosis, and xanthine in xanthinosis.
• The presence of crystals in joint fluid does not exclude infection.
• The most common causes of non-gonococcal septic arthritis in Europe and
North America are Staphylococcus aureus (40–50%), Staphylococcus
epidermidis (10–15%), Streptococcal species (20%), and Gram-negative
bacteria (15%).

Investigations: radiographs
Radiographs can confirm an effusion, show characteristic patterns of chondral
and bone destruction (e.g. in infection or erosive gout), and can reveal intraarticular calcification associated with CPPD or hydroxyapatite arthritis.
• Septic arthritis causes patchy osteopenia and loss of bone cortex.
• ‘Punched-out’ erosions (within joints or around metaphyses; ‘Lulworth Cove
erosions’), soft tissue swellings (tophi), and patchy calcification are hallmarks
of chronic gout.
• Intra-articular calcification may commonly be either chondrocalcinosis (fine
linear or punctate fibrocartilage calcification) or larger loose bodies (often
with prolific osteophytes)—both are associated with CPPD arthritis.
• Numerous regularly shaped calcific masses in a joint may be due to synovial
chondromatosis (most common in middle-aged men; 50% of cases affect the
knee).
• The presence of erosions does not implicate RA. The arthritis may be due to
an enthesitis associated with SpA or erosive OA. Discrimination of erosive
enthesitis, RA erosions, OA-associated subchondral cysts, and gout erosions is
often poorly done by non-MSK radiologists and the unwary/unlearned
rheumatologist!
Investigations: further imaging
Further imaging should be discussed with your radiologists:
• MRI confirmation of traumatized structures such as meniscus damage in the
knee and labral damage in the shoulder should be sought if suspected.
• US of knee or shoulder might be first-line imaging depending on the
experience of the radiologist when considering periarticular lesions (e.g.
anterior knee structure lesions around the patellar ligament or the rotator cuff
of the shoulder).
• MRI can confirm synovitis, although appearances are usually non-specific.

[SECTION]Characteristic MRI appearances of enthesitis and associated osteitis and PVNS
are recognized.
Other laboratory investigations to consider
• FBC, acute-phase response (ESR, CRP). Neutrophilia is not specific for
infection and can occur in crystal arthritis.
• Blood urea, electrolytes, creatinine, and urate (e.g. hyperuricaemia and renal
impairment associated with gout).
• Blood calcium, phosphate, albumin, alkaline phosphatase (±PTH), thyroid
function tests, and ferritin to screen for hyperparathyroidism, thyroid disease,
and haemochromatosis, all of which can be associated with CPPD arthritis.
• Autoantibodies: RF and anticitrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) may help
identify early RA. RF is not specific for RA and is less specific than ACPA. Be
aware of the association of RF with primary Sjögren’s syndrome.
• Immunoglobulin M (IgM) Borrelia burgdorferi serology may help diagnose
Lyme disease in patients at risk (e.g. acute arthropathy or migratory arthritis).
• Antibodies to the streptococcal antigens streptolysin O (ASOT) DNAase B,
hyaluronidase, and streptozyme may be useful in patients who have had sore
throat, migratory arthritis, or features of rheumatic fever (see Chapter 18).
Investigations: synovial biopsy
• If there is a haemarthrosis or suspicion of PVNS, MRI of the joint is wise
before biopsy to characterize the vascularity of a lesion.
• Consider a biopsy to evaluate a monoarthritis of unclear aetiology. Biopsy may
be helpful to diagnose sarcoid arthropathy (see
Chapter 18), infectious
arthritis, or crystal arthropathy when the usual diagnostic tests are negative.
• Formalin fixation of samples is sufficient in most cases. Samples for polarized
light microscopy are best fixed in alcohol (urate is dissolved by formalin).
Snap freezing in nitrogen is essential if immuno-histochemistry is required.
• Arthroscopic biopsy will yield more tissue than needle biopsy and will allow
joint irrigation.
• Congo red staining of synovium, ideally with polarized light microscopy,
should be requested if AA, AL, or β 2-microglobulin amyloid is a possibility
(see Chapter 18). This should be considered in patients with myeloma (AL)
and long-term dialysis patients (β 2-microglobulin). AA amyloid is an
uncommon, but recognized complication of RA, AS, FMF, and Crohn’s
disease.
Widespread MSK pains in adults

[SECTION]Widespread MSK pain is a common reason for adults to seek medical advice
(Table 2.6). Although some patients will have a polyarticular arthritis, many
conditions are characterized by MSK symptoms which may be diffuse or
multicentric. In addition, the interpretation and reporting of symptoms varies
considerably and can be a source of confusion. This section reviews important
aspects of the history, examination, and investigations in the initial evaluation of
patients who present with non-localized, multicentric pains.
Initial impressions
• Think broadly about the possible diagnoses.
• Use what you know about the epidemiology of likely conditions. For example,
a 35-year-old man with peripheral joint pains is more likely to have psoriatic
arthritis (see Chapter 8) than RA or generalized OA (see Chapter 6), SLE
(see Chapter 10), or PMR.
Age, gender, and racial background
• What clues can be drawn from the age, sex, and racial background?
• The degree to which these factors influence the likelihood of disease varies
according to the prevalence of the disease in the local population. Review
what you know about epidemiology of diseases.
Previous diagnoses
Presenting features may be put in context early if you have knowledge of MSK
associations of diagnoses that have already been made. For example:
• Synovitis in patients with (radiological) chondrocalcinosis (CPPD
disease/arthritis).
• Arthropathy in patients with hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia (see
Chapter 16, CPPD arthritis/pseudogout).
• Enthesitis/synovitis in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (see
Chapter 8, Spondyloarthritis).
• Polyarticular synovitis and myalgia in patients with lymphoma.
• Crystal-induced or β 2-microglobulin deposition arthritis and osteodystrophy
in chronic renal disease (see Chapter 16).
Taking a history
First, establish whether pains arise from joints or tendons/entheses, muscles,
bone, or are neurologic.
• Although the patient may report ‘joint pains’, take time to establish whether
the pains are truly from the joint or periarticular tissues.
• Listen carefully to the description of the pains; try to determine if the patient

[SECTION]has a single condition or a number of overlapping causes of pain.
Table 2.6 Broad categories of conditions that may present with widespread MSK pain

Common Inflammatory polyarthritis (e.g. RA or psoriatic arthritis)
Generalized (nodal) OA (see

Chapter 6)

Fibromyalgia/chronic pain syndromes (see

Chapter 22)

Non-specific myalgias and arthralgias* associated with infection
(e.g. viruses) (see Chapter 17)
Less
Myoarthralgias* in autoimmune connective tissue diseases
common
Myalgias/muscle inflammation (e.g. polymyositis) (see Chapter
14)
Myoarthralgias* with neoplasia and/or skeletal metastases
Polyostotic Paget’s disease (see
Rare

Chapter 16)

Metabolic bone diseases (e.g. osteomalacia, see

Chapter 8)

Metabolic myopathies (e.g. hypokalaemia; see

Chapter 14)

Neurological disease (Parkinson’s disease)
* In certain situations/conditions patients may complain of both muscle and joint pains. This is easily
appreciated if you’ve ever had influenza!

Obtain a detailed history of the pain at different sites
• A good history should help narrow the differential diagnosis considerably. For
example, a 70-year-old man referred with ‘widespread joint pains mostly in his
legs’ could have multiple weight-bearing joint OA or lumbosacral nerve root
claudication symptoms (see
Chapters 3 and 6 and
Chapter 21,
respectively). A middle-aged woman with ‘hand and neck pain’ could have an
arthropathy or radicular pain associated with cervical spondylosis.
• Widespread pain due to bone pathology could be due to skeletal metastasis.
Bony pain is often unremitting, and changes little with changes in posture and
movement.
• One pitfall is to assume that all pains arise from a single pathological process.
For example, in an older patient, multiple pathologies frequently exist and can
be complicated to unravel. The following are all common in the elderly:
• osteoarthritis (any/multiple joints).

primary hyperparathyroidism.
CKD-related MSK symptoms.
hypovitaminosis D/osteomalacia.

Joint pain at rest, after rest, or with joint use?
Establish whether pain arises from joints or tendons/entheses.
• Pain occurring with inflammation is conventionally regarded as being
associated with morning stiffness or stiffness after periods of rest. It tends to
be prominent in conditions such as RA, SpA, PMR, and myositis.
Inflammatory joint pain often improves in the day.
• Mild degrees of immobility-associated pain and stiffness occur in some other
conditions, such as OA and fibromyalgia, although such forms of stiffness
generally last for <1 h. Stiffness may also be a feature of muscle spasm and
soft-tissue oedema.
• Mechanical joint damage such as OA is also painful. Unlike inflammatory
joint pain, mechanical joint pain is worsened by use, and improves with rest.
Ask, and document in detail, which joints are affected
• A symmetric polyarthritis affecting the small joints is typical for RA. RA can
also present with carpal tunnel syndrome, tenosynovitis, tennis elbow, or an
asymmetric pattern of joint involvement, and can be preceded by a
palindromic pattern of joint pain (see
‘Ask about the pattern of joint
symptoms over time’, pp. 57–58).
• Arthritis from parvovirus B19 infection may also be polyarticular and
symmetric but also may cause myopathy and general symptoms.
• Small joint pain in the hands occurs in nodal generalized OA. Distal
interphalangeal joints (DIPJs), proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPJs), and
thumb joints are usually affected. OA is also associated with pain in the spine,
hips, and knees.
• The combination of sacroiliac (low back and buttock), pelvic, and lower limb
joint/enthesis pain, typically in an asymmetric oligoarticular pattern, is
suggestive of SpA. Typical sites of involvement include anterior knee,
posterior and inferior heel (plantar fascia).
• Enthesitis can affect the wrists and small joints of the hand and feet (e.g.

[SECTION]plantar fascia origin and insertion at metatarsal heads) and may be difficult to
distinguish from RA on clinical grounds alone.
• CPPD typically favours the large and medium-sized joints, but a picture of
multiple joint involvement similar to that in RA is possible (including
tenosynovitis).
• Widespread arthralgias/arthritis occurs in patients with leukaemia, lymphoma,
myeloma, and certain infections.
Ask about the pattern of joint symptoms over time
• A short, striking history of marked, acute polyarticular symptoms often occurs
with systemic infection (Table 2.7). Prominent malaise and fever should raise
suspicion of infection.
• There may be a longer history than is first volunteered. Autoimmune
rheumatic and connective tissue diseases may evolve over a period of time and
often naturally relapse and remit; the first symptoms of disease may be
dismissed by the patient as irrelevant.
• Conventionally, persistent inflammatory joint symptoms should be present for
at least 6 weeks before RA is diagnosed.
• Migratory arthralgias occur in 10% of RA patients initially: a single joint
becomes inflamed for a few days then improves and a different joint becomes
affected for a few days and so on. A similar pattern can occur in poststreptococcal arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as
Wegener’s granulomatosis), sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, and Whipple’s disease.
• Recurrent pains from various MSK lesions, which have occurred from injury
or have developed insidiously, are typical in patients with underlying
hypermobility (e.g. EDS including hypermobility-EDS, OI, Marfan Syndrome
etc) (see Chapter 19).
• The onset of enthesopathy may be insidious or acute.

* The presentation of parvovirus B19 illness may be quite different in children.
Even if serological tests have high sensitivity and specificity, the positive predictive value of the test is
low if the clinical likelihood of the infection is low. Therefore, do not use serological tests
indiscriminately.

Is there widespread muscle pain?
If you think there is widespread muscle pain, consider that:
• The myalgias may be fibromyalgia or enthesitis.
• Pain locating to muscle group areas may be ischaemic or neurologic in origin,
and not necessarily due to intrinsic muscle disease.
• The differential diagnosis of polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) is
broad, but many of these conditions are rare (Table 2.8 and see Chapter 14).
Ask about the distribution and description of myalgias and weakness
• True weakness may denote either myopathy or a neurological condition.
However, patients may report a feeling of weakness if muscles are painful,
therefore, rely more on your examination before deciding muscles are weak.
• PMR (rare in patients <55 years old), myositis, and endocrine or metabolic
myopathies typically present with proximal weakness.
• PMR does not lead to objective weakness; instead, patients experience
proximal muscle pain and stiffness that is worse in the morning, and is
frequently described by the patient as ‘weakness’.
• Although rare, truncal muscle pain, and stiffness can be a presenting feature of
Parkinson’s disease.

[SECTION]• Cramp-like pains may be a presenting feature of any myopathy (e.g.
hypokalaemic) or even motor neuron disease. However, some patients may
interpret radicular (nerve root) pains as ‘cramp-like’.
• Inflammatory, endocrine, and metabolic myopathies are often not painful.
• Occasionally, some genetic muscle diseases (e.g. myophosphorylase, acid
maltase deficiency), can present atypically late (in adults) with progressive
weakness that may be mistaken for PM.
Ask about the pattern of muscle pains over time
• Severe, acute muscle pain occurs in a variety of conditions. The most common
causes are viral, neoplastic, and drugs. Some toxic causes may result in
rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and acute kidney injury (AKI).
• Usually PM/DM is characterized by slowly evolving but progressive muscle
pain and weakness (e.g. weeks to months).
• Low-grade episodic muscle pains may denote a previously undisclosed
hereditary metabolic myopathy.
• Fibromyalgia (see Chapter 22) is a chronic pain syndrome and symptoms
may have been present for a considerable time at presentation.
Are the pains ischaemic?
• Ischaemic muscle pain often occurs predictably in association with repeated
activity and eases or resolves on rest (‘claudication’). Consider this especially
if pains are confined to a single limb or both legs.

* Drugs most likely to cause painful myopathy.
† Because of variable severity, some conditions may not present until adulthood.
Note: Guillain–Barré syndrome and motor neuron disease may be considered in the differential
diagnosis of non-painful muscle weakness

• The distribution of pains may give clues as to sites of underlying pathology,
e.g. upper extremities are affected by subclavian artery stenosis and thoracic

[SECTION]outlet syndrome; lower extremities are affected by atherosclerotic vascular
disease or lumbar nerve root stenosis.
• Ischaemic pains in the context of a highly inflammatory state may suggest
systemic vasculitis, such as polyarteritis nodosa.
Widespread pain may be due to bone pathology
• Bone pains are unremitting and disturb sleep. They could denote serious
pathology—radiographic and laboratory investigations are important.
• The major diagnoses to consider include disseminated malignancy, multiple
myeloma, metabolic bone disease (e.g. renal osteodystrophy,
hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia), and polyostotic Paget’s disease.
Specific questions are often required because previous problems may not be
regarded as relevant by the patient. For example:
• For those with joint pains a history of the following may be of help:
• other autoimmune diseases (increased risk of RA, SLE, etc.).
• Raynaud’s phenomenon (association with SScl, RA, and SLE).
• dry eyes (possible Sjögren’s syndrome).
• uveitis or acute ‘red eye’ (association with SpA).
• recurrent injuries/joint dislocations (association with joint hypermobility
syndrome.
• genital, urine, or severe gut infection (link with SpA).
• psoriasis (association with SpA).
• diabetes (cheiroarthropathy).
• For those in whom myalgias/myositis seems likely:
• preceding viral illness (possible viral myositis).
• foreign travel (tropical myositis).
• other autoimmune disease (associated with PM/DM).
• previous erythema nodosum (sarcoid).
• drugs and substance abuse.
• For all patients:
• weight loss or anorexia (association with malignancy).
• fevers or night sweats (association with infection).
• sore throat (possible post-streptococcal condition).
• persistent spinal pain (association with fibromyalgia).
• rashes (association with Lyme disease, SLE, DM, vasculitis).
• For those with widespread bony pain:
• history of rickets (association with osteomalacia).
• chronic renal disease (will precede renal osteodystrophy and may predispose
to crystalline arthritis and osteoarticular deposition of β 2-microglobulin).

[SECTION]Psychosocial and sexual history
• Preceding sexual activity and genital infection is important primarily because
of an association of Chlamydia trachomatis infection with reactive arthritis
and enthesitis/SpA (see Chapter 8).
• Reactive arthritis has an association with HIV. HIV is also associated with PM,
and is a risk factor for pyomyositis.
• There is an association of anxiety and depression with FM (see Chapter 22).
Ask about travel
• Residence in, or travel to, rural areas populated by deer might be important in
indicating a risk of exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi and contracting Lyme
disease (the spirochete is carried by ticks that colonize deer, boar, and other
animals and bite other mammals).
• Plasmodium falciparum (intertropical areas), Trypanosoma (mainly South
America), Trichinella, and cysticerci (tapeworm larval cysts) infections are
associated with myalgias/myositis.
Family history
Ask about family with arthritis or autoimmune diseases:
• There is a hereditary component to psoriatic arthritis, SpA, large joint and
generalized nodal OA, and hyperuricaemia/gout.
• The risk of developing any autoimmune condition is higher in families of
patients with autoimmune diseases than generally.
• Hypermobility per se (not necessarily joint hypermobility syndrome) and FM
show a strong heritability in twin studies.
Drug history
• The following drugs have been reported to cause a myopathy (those marked*
are more likely to be painful): lithium, fibrates, statins, penicillin, colchicine,
penicillamine*, sulphonamides, hydralazine, ciclosporin, phenytoin,
cimetidine* (muscle cramps), zidovudine, carbimazole, TNFα inhibitors, and
tamoxifen.
• The myositis that occurs with penicillamine is not dose dependent or
cumulative dose dependent. It can be life-threatening.
• Drug-induced SLE, which is characterized commonly by arthralgias, aching,
and malaise, and less commonly by polyarthritis, can occur with a number of
drugs including hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, minocycline, TNFα
inhibition therapy. Quinidine, labetalol, captopril, phenytoin, methyldopa, and
sulfasalazine may also cause similar symptoms.

[SECTION]• Mild myalgias and arthralgias may be caused by a number of commonly used
drugs, e.g. proton pump inhibitors and quinolone antibiotics.
• Alcohol in excess and some illegal drugs are associated with toxic myopathy
occasionally resulting in rhabdomyolysis.
Ask about chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitations, cough, and haemoptysis
• Cardiac abnormalities are features of autoimmune rheumatic and connective
tissue diseases, but are infrequent at initial presentation. Cardiac infection is
associated with widespread aches and pains (e.g. rheumatic fever/poststreptococcal myalgias/arthralgias, infective endocarditis).
• Chronic effort-related dyspnoea due to interstitial lung disease occurs in many
patients with autoimmune connective tissue and rheumatic diseases. Up to
40% of RA patients may have CT evidence of lung disease. In many sedentary
patients, however, symptoms are not prominent. Dyspnoea may be present at
presentation.
• Respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia can occur as a result of a
combination of truncal striated, diaphragmatic, and smooth muscle weakness
in PM.
• There is an association between bronchiectasis and RA.
• The most common neoplasm in patients diagnosed with malignancy-associated
myositis, is of the lung.
Ask specifically about dysphagia, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea
• Patients may not mention gastrointestinal symptoms if they have resolved.
There are many links between bowel disease and inflammatory arthritis (SpA
linked to IBD is probably the commonest).
• Ask specifically about previous severe diarrhoeal or dysenteric erythema
migrans in Lyme disease.
• Erythema marginatum in rheumatic fever.
• UV sensitive rash on face/arms in SLE.
• Violaceous rash on knuckles/around eyes/base of neck in DM.
• Livedo reticularis in SLE and APS.
• Purpuric rash in vasculitis (e.g. HSP).
• Erythema nodosum in sarcoidosis.
• Illnesses such as those caused by Campylobacter, Yersinia, Shigella, or
Salmonella, will be relevant to diagnosing reactive arthritis/SpA.
• Gut smooth muscle may be affected in polymyositis and give rise to dysphagia
and abdominal pain.
Examination

[SECTION]In patients with widespread pain, a full medical examination is always necessary.
Skin and nails
In all patients look carefully at the skin and nails:
• Nails may show prominent ridges or pits in psoriatic arthropathy, splinter
haemorrhages in infective endocarditis, systemic vasculitis or APS, or
periungual erythema in scleroderma and the inflammatory myopathies.
• Look for skin rashes in conditions characterized by widespread pain. For
example, lymphadenopathy may be present with either infection or
inflammation and is non-specific. However, if prominent it may denote
lymphoma.
• Signs of anaemia are a non-specific finding in many chronic systemic
autoimmune diseases.
• Clubbing of the digits may be present in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis
(associated with SpA) and bronchiectasis (associated with RA).
• Oedema can occur in both upper and lower extremities in a subset of patients
presenting with inflammatory polyarthritis/tenosynovitis. The condition has
been termed RS3PE (remitting seronegative symmetric synovitis with pitting
oedema). This condition is striking in that it occurs suddenly, often in patients
60–80 years old and is very disabling. It may be associated with other
conditions. It may be a manifestation of pseudogout in CPPD disease.
Examination of the joints
Important points to note when examining joints:
• Each joint should be compared to the joint on the opposite extremity, first by
observation, then palpation, then by its active and passive range of motion
exercises.
• Useful examination tools include a tape measure to record swelling
(circumferential) and a goniometer (protractor with arms) to measure the range
of joint movement.
Patterns of abnormality
Note the specific cause of joint swelling and site of tenderness, distribution of
affected sites, and hypermobility:
• In nodal generalized OA, osteophytes (bony swelling—may be tender) can be
noted at DIPJs (Heberden’s nodes) and PIPJs (Bouchard’s nodes). Periosteal
new bone at sites of chronic enthesitis may be palpable and tender.
• Nodules may occur in nodal OA, RA, polyarticular gout, ANCA-associated
vasculitis, multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, or hyperlipidaemia (xanthomata).
• Soft tissue swelling with tenderness and painful restriction of the joint on

[SECTION]•

movement suggests an inflammatory arthritis. There is often adjacent muscle
wasting. This is most easily appreciated in the interosseous muscles in patients
with hand arthritis, or the quadriceps in patients with knee arthritis.
The ‘painful joints’ may be inflamed tendons or entheses. Tender tendon
insertions and periarticular bone tenderness, often without any joint swelling,
may denote enthesis inflammation associated with SpA.
Tendonitis may be part of many autoimmune rheumatic or connective tissue
diseases. Look specifically for thickening of the digital flexors and swelling of
the dorsal extensor tendon sheath in the hand, and tenderness/swelling of both
peroneal and posterior tibial tendons in the foot.
Gross swelling with painful restriction of small joints is unusual in SLE. Often
there is little to find on examination of joints.
General joint hypermobility may lead to joint and other soft tissue lesions. An
examination screen for hypermobility may be helpful (Table 2.9; also see
Chapter 19). Check also for associated features.
Table 2.9 Features of hypermobility. These are the ‘Brighton’ criteria

[SECTION]Eye signs: drooping eyelids, myopia, downslanting eyes
Examination of patients with widespread myalgia
• Check for muscle tenderness and weakness. Document the distribution. Is
there evidence of neurologic or vascular disease?
• The characteristic sites of tenderness in fibromyalgia should be confidently
recognized (Fig. 2.1; see also Chapter 22). Despite discomfort, the muscles
should be strong.
• Examine the strength of both truncal and limb muscle groups (Fig. 2.2). In the
presence of pain, it may be difficult to demonstrate subtle degrees of muscle
weakness.
• Patterns of muscle weakness are not disease specific; however, there are some
characteristic patterns: symmetric proximal extremities in PM and DM;
quadriceps and forearm/finger flexors in inclusion body myositis; limb
muscles in mitochondrial myopathy. (Note: using specific apparatus physical
therapists can help document isometric muscle strength in certain muscle
groups.)
• Muscles in PMR are not intrinsically weak.
• Muscle wasting is not specific. If wasting is profound and rapid, consider
neoplasia. Wasting will occur in most long-standing myopathies.
• Check for increased limb tone and rigidity—most evident by passive
movement at a joint—consistent with extrapyramidal disease. There may be
resting tremor in the hand, facial impassivity, and ‘stiff’ gait. Muscular tone in
the limbs may also be increased in motor neuron disease; however, if
presenting with muscle pains, the patient with motor neuron disease is more
likely to have a lower motor neuron pattern of neuronal loss (progressive
muscular atrophy) with muscular weakness/wasting, flaccidity, and
fasciculations.
• The fatiguability of myasthenia gravis can be identified by determining the
length of time the patient can keep their arms extended in front of them, or
maintain an upward gaze.
• Muscle pains or cramps due to large-vessel ischaemia are likely to be nontender at rest and strong. Demonstrate absent pulses and bruits and substantiate
findings with US Doppler examination.
• In suspected cases of PM and DM, examine for cardiopulmonary
abnormalities. Other associated signs in DM include periungual

[SECTION]erythema/telangiectasia, erythematous violaceous rash and skin calcinosis.
Dysphonia and swallowing abnormalities occur in both PM and DM.
• Because of its associations, patients with myositis should be carefully
examined for the following signs: dry eyes/mouth (Sjögren’s syndrome; see
Chapter 12), skin thickening/tenderness or discoloration (scleroderma; see
Chapter 13), skin rashes (SLE; see
Chapter 10), thyroid tenderness or
enlargement (endocrine myopathy; see Chapter 4).

Fig. 2.1 Typical sites of tenderness in fibromyalgia.

Investigations: general points
• ESR and CRP may be higher than normal in the setting of infection,
malignancy, or active rheumatic disease. A slightly elevated ESR is a common
finding in healthy elderly people.
• A positive ANA may occur in association with many autoimmune conditions,
in other diseases (Table 2.10), and in some healthy people. It is, therefore, not
diagnostic for SLE or any single condition; however, high-titre ANA may be
significant and conversely, ANA-negative SLE is rare.
• ACPA is more specific for RA than RF (see
Chapter 5), which can be
positive in a number of inflammatory conditions.
• Controversy exists about the diagnosis of FM. It is prudent to only make a
diagnosis of FM when other disorders can be confidently excluded. Consider:
psoriasis-related MSK disease, SAPHO, sarcoid, autoimmune connective
tissue diseases including APS, vasculitides.
Basic tests in patients with polyarthropathy
• Urinalysis (dipstick) may show proteinuria or haematuria. Both glomerular
and tubular damage are possible. Glomerulonephritis (in SLE, vasculitis, or
endocarditis, for example) is usually associated with significant proteinuria

[SECTION]•

and haematuria simultaneously. These patients will need urgent evaluation by
a nephrologist.
ESR and CRP are non-specific and may be normal in the early stages of these
conditions. If very high, then consider infection or malignancy. There is often
no evidence of an acute-phase response in patients with enthesitis (even
though pain and bony tenderness may be widespread). A mild anaemia and
thrombocytosis may accompany inflammation.
Throat swab, ASOT, anti-DNAaseB antibodies may be useful to identify a
recent post-streptococcal condition, but levels may remain mildly elevated
long-term and indicate previous infection (IgG).
Other tests which can be considered in the appropriate setting:
• random blood sugar (diabetes).
• TFTs/thyroid antibodies (hyper/hypothyroidism).
• prostatic-specific antigen (malignancy).
• fecal calprotectin (screening for inflammatory bowel disease in SpA).
Joint fluid aspiration and culture is mandatory for patients in whom sepsis is a
possibility. Fluid should be examined by polarized light microscopy in
suspected cases of crystal-induced synovitis.
In patients who are ANA-positive, test for extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs)
to help characterize the type of autoimmune process.
In many patients presenting with a short history of widespread joint pains,
radiographs will be normal. An early sign of joint inflammation is periarticular
osteopenia, but this is not specific. Recognized types of erosions, and bone
reaction lesions and their distribution can be noted by experienced radiologists
in specific conditions (e.g. RA, psoriatic arthritis, gout, CPPD arthritis).
Referral to a sexual health clinic for further detailed investigations if there is a
suggestion of recent or recurrent genital infection may help to strengthen the
evidence for a diagnosis of sexually acquired reactive arthritis.

Laboratory tests in patients with widespread muscle pain/weakness
• Dipstick urinalysis: to screen for haematuria or myoglobinuria.
• FBC, ESR.
• Initial screening tests to consider: urea/electrolytes (U&E), creatinine,
TFTs/TSH, bone profile, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, liver function tests
(LFTs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), CK, parathyroid hormone

• Elevated CK or aldolase occurs in most cases of PM. ALT, AST, and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) are non-specific markers of muscle damage. Note that
specific muscle isoenzymes of CK and LDH exist and the normal range of all
enzymes may vary in different populations. Muscle enzymes may be elevated
after non-inflammatory causes of muscle damage, e.g. exercise/trauma.
• Check for ANA and, if positive, screen for ENAs. Antibodies to certain
(cytoplasmic) tRNA synthetases (e.g. Jo-1, SRP) are myositis-specific.
• Think of checking for urinary myoglobin in cases where acute widespread
muscle pain may be associated with myolysis—causes include excessive

[SECTION]alcohol or ingestion of certain drugs (cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy, heroin),
exercise, or trauma. Such patients may be at risk of renal failure.
• PM can be a presenting feature of HIV. In HIV-positive patients, infections
causing muscle disease include TB and microsporidia.
• Viral myositis may be clinically indistinguishable from PM. Serology may
yield diagnostic clues.
Electrophysiology and imaging in patients with muscle conditions
• Electromyography (EMG) abnormalities occur in two-thirds of patients with
muscle inflammation. More information is likely if studied in the acute rather
than the chronic phase of the illness. In the acute phase, denervation and
muscle degeneration give fibrillation potentials in 74% of PM and 33% of DM
patients (see
Chapter 14). Other features include low-amplitude shortduration motor unit and polyphasic potentials.
• EMG is poor at discriminating ongoing muscle inflammation in myositis from
steroid-induced myopathy.
• There are characteristic MRI patterns of abnormality in PM and DM. MRI can
be used to identify potential muscle biopsy sites to avoid false-negative results
associated with patchy muscle inflammation.

proximal lower limb muscle strength. (b) Resisted movement testing of deltoid (i), longitudinal flexors of
the neck (ii), and iliopsoas/quadriceps (iii) strength.

Muscle biopsy
• Muscle biopsy should be considered in all patients evaluated for PM or DM.
• In PM, inflammatory infiltrates predominate in the endomysial area around
muscle fibres without perifascicular atrophy. In DM, inflammation is more
prominent in the perimysial area and around small blood vessels and there is
typically perifascicular atrophy.
• Routine tests do not reliably distinguish PM from cases of viral myositis.
Some of the glycogen storage diseases will become apparent from light

[SECTION]microscopy of biopsy material.
• An autoimmune myositis is unlikely in the absence of positive HLA
immunohistochemistry on biopsy material.
Investigations for malignancy
Investigations in adults with widespread bony pain should aim to rule out
malignancy, particularly myeloma, gonadal tumours, and malignancies from
breast, renal, and prostate cancers:
• Investigations should include mammography, urine cytology, PSA, renal US,
serum and urinary protein electrophoresis.
• Hypercalcaemia may accompany these conditions; check blood calcium,
phosphate, 25-hydroxyvitamin-D, PTH, PTH-related protein.
• PTH should also be checked in suspected cases of osteomalacia (raised due to
calcium/vitamin D deficiency) together with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (low
or low/normal), alkaline phosphatase (high/normal), 24-hour urinary calcium
will be low.
• Radiographs of affected sites are important. Include a CXR.
• Bone scintigraphy can identify sites of neoplasia, Paget’s disease, osteoporotic
fractures, severe PTH bone disease, or osteomalacia. Characteristic patterns of
abnormality exist.
• Whole-body CT scan is often the best single investigation to rule out deep
tissue masses in abdomen and pelvis.
• Bone biopsy (maintained undecalcified by placing sample in 70% alcohol) of
affected sites will be diagnostic in some, but not all, cases of osteomalacia,
osteoporosis, and renal osteodystrophy. The best samples are obtained from a
transiliac biopsy. Bone marrow can be aspirated for examination at the same
time.
• PET-CT is now used to screen for suspected small tumours where other tests
are negative, for locating lymphoma tissue for biopsy and in identifying deep
tissue inflammation or sepsis where diagnosis is otherwise unclear.

Introduction
This chapter aims to provide a guide to constructing a differential diagnosis in
the patient who presents with regional musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms. It
does not make reference to all possible diagnoses, only the most common.

[SECTION]General considerations (adults)
• Findings from conventional clinical examination and imaging of the MSK
system usually occur when the patient is at rest, and therefore only minimally
symptomatic.
• Examination in the context of function (i.e. carrying, lifting, walking, bending,
etc.) is not easy, although it is arguably more appropriate. Therefore, a
thorough history utilizing a good depth of knowledge of functional anatomy is
the best alternative and an invaluable way of obtaining good information about
abnormal function and its causes.
• Time spent obtaining a detailed account of onset of symptoms is helpful
whether or not the symptoms are of recent onset, or chronic, or associated with
trauma. Patients usually have a clearer concept of injury-induced disease and
may try to rationalize the appearance of non-trauma-related symptoms by
association with an event or injury.
• Lay terms may reflect lay understanding. For example, the term ‘repetitive
strain injury’ is commonly used by the layperson to denote a diagnosis. It is
not a diagnosis, merely a description of a (unlikely!) mechanism by which
injury has occurred. It is important to identify anatomically where the problem
lies and to then enquire as to activities that may have induced or perpetuated
the problem.
• Consider the possibility that the problem is a ‘work-related disorder’ (WRD).
A WRD may not just be MSK; consider the possibility of associated
respiratory (asthma, fibrosis), dermatological (dermatoses), neurological
(neuropathy, behavioural), psychosocial (anxiety, depression), and infective
(sewage, carcasses, needlestick) pathologies. Examples of MSK WRDs are
given in this chapter.
• With children, it is important to obtain a history from both the child and a care
provider. Second-hand information, even if provided by a parent, may be less
reliable than direct information from someone who has the opportunity to
observe the child during the day.
• Regional MSK lesions may be a presenting feature of a systemic disorder,
such as an autoimmune rheumatic disease, malignancy, or infection. Clinical
suspicion should guide the evaluation.
• Screening for disseminated malignancy, lymphoma, myeloma, and infection
should at least include a FBC, metabolic screen, serum and urine protein
electrophoresis with immunofixation, ESR, and CRP.
• Weakness (as a symptom) may be due to a neuropathic or myopathic condition
or it may be perceived according to the impact of other symptoms such as

[SECTION]pain.
General considerations (children and adolescents)
Regional MSK assessment in children and adolescents differs from adult
assessment, in the need to account for developmental variation, and motor
‘competence’.
• Though MSK problems from congenital deformities can present for the first
time in adults—to adult rheumatologists—it is more likely that congenital
anomalies are disclosed initially in children. Regional MSK assessment in a
child requires consideration of this.
• Although MSK pain is an ubiquitous experience in childhood, response to pain
by an individual child depends on various states of anxiety, stress, and past
experiences and can be influenced by the role of parents or other family
members.

Neck pain in adults
Background epidemiology
• About 10% of the adult population has neck pain at any one time, although
many people do not seek medical help.
• About 1% of adult patients with neck pain develop neurological deficits, but
overall levels of disability are lower than for patients with low back pain.
• A continuum of radiological appearances exists in relation to age:
intervertebral disc narrowing, marginal end-plate osteophytes, and facet joint
changes. Appearances are often termed ‘degenerative’; however, the
correlation with presence and severity of pain is poor; Table 3.1 lists the major
causes of neck pain in adults.
Functional anatomy
• The neck is the most mobile (37 separate articulations), but least stable part of
the spine. There are seven vertebrae (C1–C7) and five intervertebral discs
(C2/3–C6/7). The C5/6 disc is most often associated with radicular symptoms.
If it occurs, cord compression is most likely in this region, although
atlantoaxial (C1–C2) subluxation may produce the same picture, especially
among patients with RA.
• Minor congenital abnormalities are not infrequent and increase the risk of
degenerative changes.
• Nerve roots C2 and C3 cover sensation over the back of the head, the lower
jaw line, and the neck.

[SECTION]• Nerve roots (C4–T1) leave the spine in dural root sleeves, traverse the
intervertebral foramina, and form the brachial plexus.
• Cervical nerves have a dermatomal representation (Fig. 3.1) and supply upper
limb musculature in a predictable way.

nerve root lesions.

Taking a history of neck pain in adults
The site, radiation, and description of pain
• Nerve root (radicular) pain is usually sharp and reasonably well localized in
the arms. It is often ‘burning’ and associated with paraesthesia and numbness.
• Nerve root irritation and compression by an intervertebral disc are common
causes of radicular pain. However, in older adults and those who suffer
recurrent bouts of pain it is usually due to encroachment of vertebral end-plate
or facet joint osteophytes, or thickened soft tissue or fibrosis on the nerve
leading to stenosis of the exit foramen.
• Pain from deep cervical structures is common. It often localizes poorly across
the upper back. It can be referred to the upper arms, is typically described as
‘heavy’ or ‘aching’ and is more diffuse than nerve root pain.
• Muscle spasm can accompany any lesion. It can be very painful.
• Pain from the upper cervical spine (C1–C3) can be referred to the
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or retro-orbital regions. Conversely, pain from
both TMJ disorders and as a result of dental malocclusion can be referred to
the neck.
• Pain from the lower neck may be referred to the interscapular and anterior
thoracic wall regions. The latter may mimic cardiac ischaemic pain.
• Florid descriptions of the pain and of its extent and severity (‘catastrophizing’)
are associated with prominent psychological modulators of pain.
• Evaluation of the shoulder joint is often necessary as pathology there often
coexists and symptoms around the shoulder often complicate neck evaluation.
• Occipital headache is a common manifestation.
Acute neck pain with trauma
Acute neck pain with trauma requires urgent assessment, even if there are no
obvious neurological symptoms:
• Acute trauma requires urgent evaluation for fracture, spinal cord damage, and
vertebral instability. About 80% of serious injuries occur from an accelerating
head hitting a stationary object.
• An abrupt flexion injury may fracture the odontoid (less common with

[SECTION]extension); however, <1 in 5 injuries at C1/C2 produce neurological deficit
because of the wide canal at this level.
• If not traumatic or osteoporotic (the latter being relatively rare in the cervical
spine), fractures may occur in bone invaded by malignancy.
New and/or associated symptoms
Ask about associated leg weakness, and new bladder or bowel symptoms. Newonset acute neck pain with neurological features needs urgent evaluation.
Neurological symptoms may also accompany chronic neck pain:
• Spinal osteomyelitis, meningitis, discitis (infection or inflammation), myelitis,
and fracture may all present with acute or subacute neck pain. All may cause
cord compression. Myelopathy due to spondylosis typically presents with a
slowly progressive disability over weeks to months, although it can be acute,
particularly if associated with central disc prolapse.
• Subacute pain, flaccid paralysis, and profound distal neurological signs may
suggest myelitis, a condition caused mainly by infections and autoimmune
diseases.
• Tinnitus, gait disturbance, blurring of vision, and diplopia associated with neck
pain are all ascribed to irritation of the cervical sympathetic nerves.
• The vertebral arteries pass close to the facet joints just anterior to emerging
nerve roots. Disruption of vertebral blood flow may cause dizziness in severe
cases of neck spondylosis.
Previous trauma
Ask about previous trauma. It can precede and influence chronic pain:
• Acute and occupational (chronic overuse) trauma is a common antecedent of
chronic neck pain.
• Cervical dystonia (torticollis) can occur 1–4 days after acute trauma, it
responds poorly to treatment, and can be long-standing. It may also complicate
arthropathy, such as in RA or Parkinson’s disease.
• Whiplash injury is associated with chronic myofascial pain.
• In some patients with chronic pain following (sometimes trivial) trauma, there
may be dissatisfaction with the quality of care received at the time of the
injury.
• Unresolved litigation associated with trauma correlates with the persistence of
neck pain and reported disability.
Occupational and leisure activities
Some occupations, sports and activities are associated with recurrent neck pain:
• Neck pain (and early spondylosis) is prevalent in people whose occupations

[SECTION]require persistent awkward head and neck postures, e.g. professional dancers.
• Although biomechanical factors may be an important influence in initiating
and aggravating neck pain, there may also be an underlying genetic
predisposition to OA and/or hypermobility.
Other points
Establish whether the pain started or varies with non-MSK symptoms:
• Cardiac ischaemia, dyspepsia, or abdominal pain can result in referred pain to
the neck (Table 3.1).
Examination of the neck: adults
The neck is part of the functional upper limb and symptoms in the arms and legs
may be relevant. Neurological examination of the arms is important:
• An adequate examination cannot be performed in a clothed patient. Despite the
inconvenience, it is important to have the patient change into an examination
gown to avoid missing relevant clues.
• Inspection from front and back may reveal specific muscle wasting or spasm
and poor posture.
• Observing active movements reveals little if the patient has severe pain or
muscle spasm. Inability to move the neck even small distances is characteristic
in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA; see Chapter 8).
• Tenderness often localizes poorly in degenerative disease. Exquisite
tenderness raises the possibility of a disc lesion, osteomyelitis, or malignancy
(the latter two are rare).
• There may be ‘trigger points’ in neck stabilizer and extensor muscles.
Activation of a trigger point elicits myofascial pain in a zone that is
stereotypical for the individual muscle.
• Tender points (localized, non-radiating pain elicited by pushing with the
thumb), notably at the occipital origin of the trapezius, the medial scapular
border, and the mid-belly of the trapezius, are features of fibromyalgia (FM;
see Chapter 22). It is not clear whether tender and trigger points are the
same.
• Examination of passive mobility may be helpful primarily if it reveals gross
asymmetry. The normal range of movement varies depending on age, sex, and
ethnicity. Generally, at least 45° of lateral flexion and 70° of rotation should be
achieved in a middle-aged adult. Global loss of passive mobility is nonspecific and occurs with increasing age. The range of movement that might
indicate hypermobility has not been established.
• Care should be taken if neck instability is a possibility (e.g. fracture, RA).

[SECTION]Vigorous passive examination of forward flexion may exacerbate disc lesions.
• Examination of the shoulder is important to evaluate any referred pain or
associated articular lesion (e.g. adhesive capsulitis).
• Neurological examination of upper and lower limbs is important in all cases
where pain is referred to the arms and/or the legs if cord compression is a
possibility: look for increased tone, clonus, pyramidal weakness, and extensor
plantar response. Check for a cervicothoracic sensory level.
Investigation of neck conditions in adults
Radiographs
Radiographs should be requested with specific objectives in mind:
• A lateral neck film may demonstrate soft tissue thickening in infection or
synovium in RA (see
Chapter 5), will document spondylitis
(syndesmophytes, discitis, and periosteal apposition in posterior elements
associated with psoriasis), and the severity of spondylosis.
• Oblique views centred on the suspected level may show nerve root foramen
stenosis from bony encroachment in patients with radiculopathy. There may be
underlying OA (see Chapter 6).
• High cervical flexion and extension views and a ‘through-the-mouth’
(odontoid) view are useful to see odontoid pathology.
• In an adult with RA, if the distance between the anterior arch of the atlas and
odontoid process is >3 mm on a lateral (flexion) image there is likely to be
C1/C2 subluxation in the sagittal plane.
• On a lateral image, superior odontoid subluxation in RA can be judged from a
reduced distance from the antero-inferior surface of C2 to a line drawn
between the hard palate and base of the occiput (McGregor’s line). The
distance should be >34 mm in men and >29 mm in women. Lateral odontoid
subluxation is best demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
• Stepwise vertebral subluxation throughout the cervical spine demonstrated on
a lateral image is characteristic of advanced RA.
• There may be only a few, but important signs of spinal infection, such as a soft
tissue mass or isolated loss of joint space.
Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT)
• MRI has largely superseded CT, arthrography, and CT arthrography in
assessing cervical spine/nerve, dural, vertebral, disc, and other soft tissue
lesions in the neck.
• In many cases the relevance of some MRI findings is still being established—
patterns of signal abnormality do occur in asymptomatic people. The

[SECTION]frequency of these effects increases with age.
• MRI is the technique of choice for imaging disc prolapse, myelopathy (see
Plate 2), myelitis and for excluding infection or tumours. MRI is used to help
evaluate the need for, and plan, neurosurgical intervention in high cervical
instability in RA patients.
• MRI may show soft tissue swelling around the odontoid in calcium
pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease (see Chapter 7), but the diagnosis
is best made with CT, which shows calcification around the odontoid and of
adjacent ligaments (‘crowned dens syndrome’).
• In patients with the combination of unexplained radiographic signs and
generalized symptoms MRI is an important investigation. Cases of spinal
infection such as tuberculosis (TB) or brucellosis and lymphoma and can be
picked up (see Chapter 17).
Bone scintigraphy
• Despite improved image quality and tomographic images, the neck is poorly
imaged using bone scintigraphy.
Treatment of neck pain in adults
Fig. 3.2 shows the principles of treating mechanical cervical syndromes in adults
and the timing of MRI scanning:
• Remember to review the diagnosis if pain persists despite treatment and
symptoms seem disproportionate to the results of imaging.
• In our experience, inflammatory spondyloarthritis (SpA)-related neck pains
can be mistaken as a result of ‘cervical spondylosis’. This may be because the
clinician too readily assumes the latter diagnosis and/or radiologists report
degenerative changes only on radiographs.

[SECTION]Fig. 3.2 The principles of treating mechanical neck syndromes in adults and the timing of MRI scanning.

Neck pain in children and adolescents
General considerations
Neck pain in children is common. See Table 3.2. Though there are conditions
specific to childhood below, this section should be read in association with neck
pain assessment in adults p. 74 including functional anatomy and examination
(for adolescents).
• The prevalence of neck pain in secondary school-aged children is ~11%.
• In one study, 60% of children experienced at least one episode of neck pain
over a 2-year period and 9% experienced neck pain ‘often’.

[SECTION]• Of those children with neck pain who present to A&E, 62% have had trauma,
19% presented following infection, in 18% neck pain is related to adverse
posture, and just 1.2% had neck pain associated with other conditions. Neck
pain resolves in 96% within 2 weeks.
Clinical features
• In younger children, neck problems are most commonly manifest as torticollis
or stiffness.
• Subacute or chronic infectious aetiology includes lymphadenitis, including
tuberculous retropharyngeal abscess, and discitis.
• Bone pathology is very rare but causes include eosinophilic granuloma, nonbacterial osteomyelitis, and osteoid osteoma. Malignancy is usually associated
with characteristic MRI findings.
• Systemic onset and other forms of JIA are associated with neck stiffness more
than with pain.
• Studies in adulthood have indicated cervical spine involvement in up to 80%
cases of polyarticular JIA.
• In JIA, neck involvement is often associated with TMJ involvement.
Examination of the neck: children and adolescents
• General guidelines for the assessment of pain should be followed as outlined
in Chapter 1.
• There should be full exposure of the spine for the examination and a
neurological examination undertaken in all cases.
• A full examination includes assessment of posture and biomechanics of the
shoulders and lower spine and pelvis.
• Examination of lymph nodes, pharynx, eyes, and joints is important.
• Imaging of choice is MRI.

Shoulder pain in adults
Anatomy of the shoulder
(See Fig. 3.3.)
• The glenohumeral joint is a ball and socket joint. The shallow glenoid cavity
permits a wide range of movement. The circular fibrocartilaginous labrum sits
on the glenoid, increases the articular surface area, and acts as a static joint
stabilizer.
• Normal glenohumeral movements include depression, then glide and rotation
of the humeral head under the coraco-acromial (CA) arch to enable elevation
of the arm. As the arm elevates, there is smooth rotation and elevation of the
scapula on the thoracic wall.
• Shoulder movements are a synthesis of four joints: glenohumeral,
acromioclavicular (AC), sternoclavicular (SC), and scapulothoracic.
• Movements at AC and SC joints enable slight clavicular rotation, shoulder
elevation/depression, and protraction/retraction.
• The rigid CA arch protects the glenohumeral joint from trauma and it, and the
overlying deltoid, are separated from the capsule by the subacromial
(subdeltoid) bursa.
• A cuff of muscles surrounds the glenohumeral joint capsule. These ‘rotator
cuff ‘muscles are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and
subscapularis.
• The supraspinatus initiates abduction by depressing the humeral head, then
elevating the arm alone for the first 10° of movement. The more powerful
deltoid then takes over abduction. Infraspinatus/teres minor and the
subscapularis externally and internally rotate the arm in the anatomical
position respectively (Fig. 3.4).
• Production of powerful shoulder movements requires some degree of arm
elevation as the larger muscles, such as deltoid, latissimus dorsi (extensor),

[SECTION]and teres major (adductor), work inefficiently with the arm in the anatomical
position. Rotator cuff muscles act synchronously as joint stabilizers through
the range of shoulder movement.
• The long head of the biceps tendon originates above the glenoid usually
attached to the labrum and runs within the glenohumeral joint capsule
anteromedially in a bony groove.
Pain and shoulder lesions in adults
(See also Chapter 20.)
• Shoulder pain is common and may have its origin in articular or periarticular
structures or may be referred from the neck or thoracic spine, thoracic outlet,
or sub-diaphragmatic structures (Table 3.3).
• Shoulder lesions often produce pain referred to the humeral deltoid insertion
(patient points to upper arm).
• Periarticular disorders, mainly shoulder subacromial impingement (SAI)
disorders, are the most common cause of shoulder pain in adults (>90% of
cases).
• Traumatic or inflammatory lesions of many different shoulder structures and
conditions that result in neuromuscular weakness of the rotator cuff or
scapular stabilizers may result in impingement pain.
• Pain from subacromial impingement syndrome is thought to be generated by
the ‘squashing’ of subacromial structures between the greater tuberosity of the
humeral head and the CA arch during rotation/elevation of the humeral head.

Taking a history about shoulder pain in adults

[SECTION]When did the pain start?
Shoulder injuries are common, and may be acute or chronic (overuse).
• Rotator cuff lesions (inflammation, degenerative weakness, or tear) are often
associated with activities and occupations that involve straining the arm in
abduction or forward flexion. A history of an acute injury, however, is not
always obtained. Subsequent calcification in the tendon following a
supraspinatus injury can be asymptomatic or present with acute pain.
• Manual labour is a risk factor for rotator cuff lesions. There is typically no
acute injury, but a history of repetitive movements over years that lead to
injury.
• Athletes who take part in throwing and racket sports are at risk of rotator cuff
tendinopathy and labral tears. Rugby and American Football players and
cyclists are at risk of clavicle fracture, shoulder dislocation and disruption of
the AC joint.
• Pain from degenerative glenohumeral or AC joint arthritis might be a longterm sequela of a bone or joint injury.
• Myofascial pain of the shoulder girdle is common and may mimic the
symptoms of cervical radiculopathy and even reflux oesophagitis or ischaemic
heart disease.
• Severe, persistent, sleep-disturbing pain of recent onset may be indicative of
avascular necrosis, osteomyelitis, or bony tumours.
Where is the pain?
• Pain from the shoulder may be referred to the deltoid insertion.
• Well-localized pain may occur with AC joint arthritis (e.g. patient places a
finger on the affected joint), but remember that referred C4 nerve root pain and
pain from bone lesions of the distal clavicle is maximal in the same area.
• Glenohumeral articular and capsulitis pain is not well localized (e.g. the
patient covers their shoulder with their hand).
• Pericapsular pain may be associated with SAI, but may also be myofascial
(typically) or referred from the cervicothoracic spine.
• Bilateral shoulder pain should increase suspicion of the presence of an
inflammatory polyarthritis such as RA (see Chapter 5), psoriatic arthritis
(see Chapter 8) or CPPD arthritis (see Chapter 7)—but these would be
rare without other joint symptoms.
• Diffuse pain across the shoulder girdle muscles in those >55 years old raises
the possibility of PMR. Pain is often associated with immobility and stiffness,
particularly early in the day.
• A deep aching pain associated with stiffness is characteristic of adhesive

[SECTION]capsulitis (frozen shoulder). The use of the term frozen shoulder is popular,
but often incorrectly applied. It is a condition that is rare in patients <40 years
of age. The condition occurs in three phase: a painful phase, an adhesive
(‘frozen’) phase, and a resolution phase. Phases often overlap and the duration
varies but long-term limitation of shoulder movement remains in up to 15% of
patients. It is associated with diabetes.
Does the pain vary?
Movement- or posture-related pain may be a clue to its cause:
• Rotator cuff lesions often present to rheumatologists with a subacromial
impingement pattern of pain—that is, pain reproducibly aggravated by specific
movements during each day such as reaching up (overhead) with the arm.
Articular, bone, and adhesive capsulitis pain is more likely to be persistent.
• A history of recurrent bouts of shoulder pain in young adults may suggest
glenohumeral instability due to hypermobility or previous trauma, e.g. a labral
tear.
• In an unstable shoulder, pain may result from synovitis, subchondral bone
damage, or an SAI disorder. The frequency of recurrent anterior subluxation is
inversely proportional to the age at which the initial dislocation occurs.
Are there spinal symptoms?
There is an association between neck conditions and shoulder pain. C4 nerve
root pain is referred to the shoulder, adhesive capsulitis is associated with
cervical nerve root symptoms (the nature of the link is unknown), and
inflammatory conditions, such as CPPD and psoriatic spondylitis forms can be
associated with bilateral shoulder pain referral and can mimic PMR.
Examination of the shoulder in adults
Visual inspection
Inspect the neck, shoulders, and arms from the front, side, and back with the
patient standing.
• Abnormality of the contour of the cervicothoracic spine could indicate muscle
imbalance/spasm or might be associated with a nerve root origin of pain.
• Scapular asymmetry at rest is especially relevant when examining children and
may indicate a congenital bony deformity. Subtle degrees of asymmetry are
common and are not usually due to specific pathology, nor are they of
consequence.
• Diffuse swelling of the whole shoulder may suggest a shoulder
effusion/haemarthrosis or subacromial bursitis. In the elderly, Milwaukee

[SECTION]shoulder should be considered. Swelling of the AC joint occurs with joint
diastasis, arthritis, and distal clavicular bone lesions.
• Arm swelling and skin changes distally could indicate a complex regional pain
syndrome.
Elicit any tenderness
Eliciting tenderness of shoulder structures is often unrewarding:
• Tenderness of the AC joint, humeral insertion of the supraspinatus tendon, and
the long head of biceps tendon may be clues to pathology, but palpation will
not be specific for diagnosis.
• The deltoid origin is a typical enthesis involved in active PsA.
• An appreciation of trigger points associated with myofascial pain and tender
points in fibromyalgia (see Chapter 22) is important in the interpretation of
regional soft tissue tenderness.
Document bilateral (active) shoulder movements
This aids diagnosis but also gives an indication of the level of functional
impairment and can help in monitoring changes over time. The movements are
first tested actively (the patient does the movement) and then passively (the
clinician supports the limb). Muscle strength can also be assessed while testing
active movement.
• Observe active arm elevation in the scapular plane from behind, noting
symmetry of scapular movement, the pattern of pain during elevation, and the
range of elevation. Hunching of the shoulder at the outset of arm elevation
often occurs with an impingement problem. A painful arc may suggest a
rotator cuff lesion. Inability to lift the arm suggests a rotator cuff tear or
weakness, capsulitis, or severe pain, e.g. acute calcific supraspinatus
tendonitis.
• Observe and compare active internal rotation of shoulders, which can be
judged by how far up the back the hand can reach. Poor performance may be
due to rotator cuff weakness, weakness of the scapular stabilizing muscles, or
pain (generally from impingement syndrome). This manoeuvre assumes
normal elbow function.
• Observe the active range of external rotation of the humerus from the front.
Ask the patient to flex their elbows as if they were holding a tray and then
rotate the arms outwards. Minor degrees of restriction caused by pain are not
specific, but severe restriction is characteristic of adhesive capsulitis.
• Passive range of motion should be tested with two hands: one hand guides the
movement, while the second rests on the shoulder. Many patients will

[SECTION]subconsciously flex the spine to compensate for restricted range of motion at
the shoulder; using both hands can help detect this and other abnormalities in
movement at the joint.
Test for subacromial impingement
• Always compare the affected with the non-symptomatic side and make
conservative judgements about muscle weakness if there is pain impeding
voluntary effort.
• Most tests rely on their ability to narrow the distance between the humeral
head and the CA arch, by driving the greater tuberosity under the CA arch as
the humerus rotates (Fig. 3.5).
• Whether the tests are specific for lesions of the subacromial structures or for
the site of impingement is unknown.
Movement of the glenohumeral joint
Move the glenohumeral joint passively in all directions by moving the upper arm
with one hand and placing the other over the shoulder to feel for ‘clunks’,
crepitus, and resistance to movement:
• If the humeral head can be slid anteriorly (often with a ‘clunk’) clearly without
rotation in the glenoid it suggests instability.
• Grossly reduced passive shoulder movement (notably external rotation, with or
without pain) is the hallmark of adhesive capsulitis.
• Pull down on both (hanging) arms. If the humeral head moves inferiorly
(sulcus sign) there may be glenohumeral instability.
Stress the acromioclavicular joint
Stressing the AC joint may reproduce the pain. This is conventionally done by
compression or shear tests:
• These tests should not normally be painful. Although painful tests have not
proved to be specific for AC pathology (pain from SAI may also be present), a
positive test may provide a clue that the AC joint is arthritic, dynamically
unstable, or that impingement of structures in the subacromial space under the
AC joint is occurring.
• Hold the patient’s arm in forward flexion (90°) and draw it across the top of
the patient’s chest. The resulting compression of the AC joint may produce
pain. AC joint pain can also be elicited by passively elevating the arm through
180°, bringing the hand to the ceiling. Pain is experienced in the upper 10° or
so of movement.
Gauge strength in rotator and other shoulder muscles

[SECTION]Once the potential active range of movement has been ascertained in the context
of pain and you know which movements hurt (by testing actively and passively)
then you can judge the validity of the examination of isolated muscle resistance
testing (Table 3.4):
• Rotator cuff muscles need to be tested sub-maximally in regard of strength for
strength against resistance—explain to the patient not to push too hard—see
Table 3.4.
• Knowledge of nerve supply is important to know whether there might be a
neuromyopathic cause for weakness and where a lesion might be (postinfective brachial neuritis can cause focal rotator cuff neuromyopathy and is
not uncommon).

Shoulder examination with the patient supine
Examine the shoulders with the patient supine to test whether there is anterior
cuff deficiency, glenohumeral joint laxity, or a labral tear: this is especially
important in young adults and adolescents to identify an ‘unstable shoulder’.
Hold and support the upper arm held in slight abduction and external rotation
(the elbow is flexed). Move the arm gently (cranially in the coronal plane) and
apply gradual degrees of external rotation.
• Deficiency of anterior structures is suggested by patient apprehension that pain
is imminent or that the shoulder will slip forward. With a labral tear, there may
be an audible or palpable ‘clunk’.

[SECTION]• Pressure down on the upper arm (taking the pressure off anterior shoulder
structures by an anteriorly translocated humeral head) may relieve
apprehension or pain associated with it (+ve relocation test).
• An unstable shoulder identified with the above tests may denote previous
traumatic injury (e.g. shoulder dislocation) or a hypermobility disorder.
Investigations of shoulder disorders in adults
Optimum initial imaging for investigating undiagnosed shoulder pain is
disputed. Management of shoulder problems based on history and examination
alone is a practical approach to a common problem, since many problems get
better in the short term. The long-term sequelae of such management strategies,
however, are unknown. Studies of shoulder pain primarily suggest that chronic
shoulder problems are common, often despite initial improvement.
Radiographs
• The standard projection for screening purposes is anteroposterior (AP),
although the AP axial–lateral view taken with the arm abducted may add
information about the relationship of the glenoid and humeral head. Look for
calcific deposits in soft tissue basic calcium phosphate crystals: Milwaukee
shoulder (see Chapter 7).
• Supraspinatus outlet views are often used to assess acromial configuration and
identify inferior acromial osteophytes in patients with SAI.
• If recurrent dislocation is suspected, associated humeral head defects may be
identified by an AP film with internal humeral rotation or a Stryker view.
Bilateral films distinguish anomaly (invariably bilateral) from abnormality.
• Bilateral AP AC joint views with the patient holding weights may identify, and
grade degrees of, AC joint diastasis (separation). Distal clavicular erosion may
be due to RA, hyperparathyroidism, myeloma, metastases, or post-traumatic
osteolysis.
• Although characteristic patterns of abnormality are associated with SAI (see
Plate 3), minor age-related radiographic abnormalities are normal.
Other imaging: ultrasound, arthrography, CT arthrography, MRI, isotope
bone scan
• Ultrasound (US) scoring systems for locating and grading rotator cuff tears
now exist. US permits examination of the rotator cuff with the shoulder in
different positions, but is highly operator dependent.
• Patterns of rotator cuff abnormality and subacromial impingement are well
recognized with both arthrography and MRI. However, there is no consensus
about which of ultrasound, MRI, or arthrography is most accurate for detecting

[SECTION]rotator cuff tears.
• Children, adolescents, and young adults suspected of having unstable
shoulders should have an MRI examination, since detailed views of the
humeral head, glenoid labrum, periarticular glenohumeral soft tissues, and
subacromial area are important.
• MRI is the modality of choice in young adults when instability is diagnosed.
Rotator cuff lesions and labral abnormalities are best assessed with MRI.
Enhancement with IV contrast may increase the chance of detecting a labral
tear.
• No specific patterns of bone scan abnormality have been consistently
recognized for isolated shoulder lesions, although a phase study may be
diagnostic for complex regional pain syndrome in the arm.
Other investigations
• Local anaesthetic injection may help disclose the site of shoulder pain,
although it is possible that by the time anaesthesia occurs, the injected
anaesthetic has spread to areas not intended as a target.
• Joint aspiration is essential if infection is possible. Fluid is usually aspirated
easily from a distended shoulder capsule. Haemarthroses can occur in
degenerate shoulders, with haemophilia, trauma, and pigmented villonodular
synovitis (PVNS).
• Electrophysiological tests (electromyography (EMG)/nerve conduction study
(NCS)) may confirm muscle weakness and help establish the presence of
neuromuscular disease, e.g. myositis or neurological amyotrophy.
• Blood tests are required if considering infection or inflammation.
• A normal creatine kinase (CK) and aldolase will rule out myositis in the
majority of cases.
• Blood urea, electrolytes, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphate,
thyroid function tests, and myeloma screen should be considered if metabolic
bone or myopathic disease is considered.
Treatment of shoulder disorders in adults
• Physical therapy should play a focal part in encouraging mobilization of the
joint, and early assessment is prudent.
• Know whether there is an additional neck/spinal generated pain component
(physical therapists are independent diagnosticians and some may erroneously
aim therapy at cervicothoracic segments for individual shoulder lesions).
• Do not refer to physiotherapy without knowledge of who will see the patient,
and the approach that will be taken for instability and rotator cuff weakness.

[SECTION]• Simple analgesics are often necessary.
• Steroid injections can be considered in the following situations (see also
Chapter 24):
• Tendonitis of the rotator cuff.
• Adhesive capsulitis (see Plate 4).
• AC joint pain.
• Subacromial bursitis (see Plate 5).
• The principles of steroid injection and rehabilitation are dealt with in
Chapter 24.
• There are several situations where local steroids should be avoided:
• Bicipital tendonitis (rest, analgesia, physical therapy).
• The first 6 weeks of an acute rotator cuff tear.
• When symptoms have become chronic and conservative therapy has not
helped for a presumptive clinical diagnosis (this requires reassessment,
imaging as surgery may be required).
• Surgical intervention may be: subacromial decompression arthroscopy,
synovectomy of the SC joint and AC joint, or excision of the distal end of the
clavicle:
• Subacromial decompression may be necessary for chronic rotator cuff
tendonitis especially when imaging has shown inferior acromial
osteophytes.
• Other interventions include repair of a rotator cuff or biceps tendon rupture
and joint replacement (for pain relief rather than improvement in function
mainly).
• Lithotripsy does not offer advantages over steroid injection and physical
therapy for calcific supraspinatus tendonitis.

Shoulder pain in children and adolescents
General considerations
The prevalence of chronic shoulder pain in adolescents is 7–11%.
• The principal cause of shoulder pain is biomechanical imbalance either from
deconditioning, sporting injury (e.g. labral tear or rotator cuff lesions),
overuse, or secondary to direct trauma.
• The shoulder can be involved in JIA.
• Examination follows the principles of adult examination already described and
paediatric guidelines on examination—see Chapter 1.

Pain around the elbow in adults
Functional anatomy
• The humero-ulnar articulation is the prime (hinge) joint at the elbow. The
radius also articulates with the humerus and allows forearm and hand
supination/pronation, with the ulna at the elbow (Fig. 3.6).
• Normal extension results in a straight arm, but some muscular people lack the
last 5–10° of extension and some (especially women) have up to an extra 10°
of extension (hyperextension).
• Normal flexion is to 150–160° and forearm supination/pronation range is
around 180°.
• Due to obliquity of the trochlea, extension is associated with a slight valgus
that can be accentuated in women (up to 15°).
• Unilateral acute traumatic or chronic overuse lesions of the elbow are
common. Bilateral symptoms may occur in these situations, but also consider
the possibility of an inflammatory arthritis affecting the elbows or referred
pain from the neck.
Taking a history of elbow pain in adults
Is pain exclusively located in the elbow or referred from elsewhere?

[SECTION]Establish whether the pain is associated with neck pain and whether it has
neurogenic qualities or is associated with paraesthesias or numbness. Pain may
be referred from proximal neurologic lesions (e.g. C6, C7) or from distal lesions
such as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
Is there a history of acute or chronic (overuse) trauma?
• Pain at the lateral epicondyle 1–2 weeks after a weekend of ‘home
maintenance’ might suggest lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) following
excessive use of a screwdriver, for example.
• Other common sites of pain, where characteristic conditions related to overuse
are recognized, include the medial humeral epicondyle (‘golfer’s elbow’) and
the olecranon bursa (repetitive pressure/friction). Although typically acute in
onset, these conditions may develop insidiously.
• Fractures around the elbow and fractures/dislocations in the forearm are
common.
• Dislocation of the radial head alone is rare and is usually associated with
concurrent fracture of the ulna (radiographs may not identify the fracture). If
not associated with fracture (and especially if recurrent), dislocation may be
associated with generalized hypermobility (see Chapter 19) or shortening of
the ulna due to bone dysplasia.

Fig. 3.6 Bony configuration at the (right) elbow (anterior view).

Does the pain radiate distally?
• Forearm pain may be an additional clue to C6 or C7 radicular pain, but may
also be due to the spread of MSK pain along the extensor group of muscles
from lateral epicondylitis or from entrapment of the median nerve in the elbow
region.

[SECTION]• Peritendonitis crepitans is pain, tenderness, and swelling in the forearm
associated with occupational overuse. It is thought to be due to damage of the
long wrist/hand flexors and extensors at the muscle–tendon junction.
• Diffuse pain in the forearm can occur as a result of overuse injury, particularly
in musicians and typists, although there is overlap with regional pain
syndromes.
• Pain around the forearm may also arise from inflammation at the wrist (see
‘Wrist pain in adults’, pp. 106–109) particularly in De Quervain’s
tenosynovitis.
Is there prominent stiffness with the pain?
• Stiffness is often non-specific but may denote inflammation such as synovitis
of the joint or olecranon bursa. It raises the possibility of an autoimmune
rheumatic or crystal deposition disease.
• In the middle aged and elderly, gout (see Chapter 7) of the olecranon bursa
and surrounding soft tissues, particularly overlying the border of the ulna, is
common and is often misdiagnosed as a cellulitis.
Ask about locking
Locking of the elbow either in flexion or supination/pronation may be due to
loose intra-articular bodies. A single loose body is most commonly due to
osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum and multiple loose bodies are
associated with OA or synovial chondromatosis.
Is the pain unremitting and severe?
This type of pain suggests bony pathology:
• Although non-fracture bone pathology is rare in the elbow region, local bony
pain might suggest osteochondritis or avascular necrosis or, if part of a wider
pattern of bony pain, metabolic bone disease.
• In the elderly and others at high risk for osteoporosis, supracondylar, and other
fractures may occur with surprisingly little trauma.
Are there symptoms in other joints?
Ask about other joints, low back (sacroiliac) pains and risks for gout:
• Elbow synovitis is an uncommon presenting feature of adult RA.
• Periarticular enthesitis is a recognized feature of spondyloarthritis (SpA) (see
Chapter 8) and may mimic tennis elbow.
• The periarticular tissue around the elbow is a common site for gout.
Examination of the elbow in adults

[SECTION]Look for abnormality then palpate with the thumb. Observe the active, passive,
and resisted active range of joint and related tendon movements, and consider
examining for local nerve lesions. A complete assessment should include
examination of neck, shoulder, and wrist.
Visual inspection
Look for obvious deformity or asymmetry in the anatomical position:
• Up to 10° of extension from a straight arm is normal. More extension might
suggest a hypermobility disorder.
• A child with an elbow lesion typically holds the extended arm close to the
body, often in pronation.
• Swelling due to joint synovitis is difficult to see in the antecubital fossa unless
it is florid: it is most easily seen (and more easily felt) adjacent to the triceps
tendon insertion.
• The olecranon bursa, which may be inflamed, overlies the olecranon and does
not as a rule communicate with the joint. Overlying erythema, though nonspecific, may be a sign of infection or gout.
• Nodules over the extensor surface or ulna border may be associated with RA
(see Chapter 5).
• Psoriatic plaques are commonly found at the elbow extensor surface.
Observe active flexion and supination/pronation with the elbows held in 90° of
flexion
• Although the range of movement may be affected by extra-articular pain, loss
of range usually implies an intra-articular disorder.
Palpate the lateral epicondyle of the humerus
• In lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow), there is tenderness, which may extend
distally. Resisted wrist and finger extension with the elbow in extension or
passively stretching the tendons (make fist, flex wrist, pronate forearm, then
extend elbow) may reproduce the pain.
• Lateral epicondyle tenderness may be due to inflammation of the radiohumeral
bursa that lies under the extensor tendon aponeurosis.
• Note that tenderness of lateral and sometimes medial epicondyles can occur in
chronic pain syndromes. In these cases, the relevant extensor or flexor tendon
provocation tests are likely to be negative.
Palpate the medial humeral epicondyle
• Tenderness suggests traumatic medial epicondylitis (‘golfer’s elbow’), a
regional or chronic pain syndrome, or enthesitis. Confirm the site of the pain

[SECTION]by stretching the wrist flexors—supinate the forearm then passively extend
both the wrist and elbow simultaneously. Resisted palmar flexion of the wrist
or forearm pronation with elbow extension may also cause pain. Tasks that
rely on this repetitive movement are often the provoking cause.
• Consider osteochondritis of the medial humeral epicondyle as a cause of
persistent pain following an injury.
Passively flex and extend the elbow joint
Passively flex and extend the joint and note the range of movement and ‘endfeel’ (the feel of resistance at the end of the range of passive joint movement):
• ‘End-feel’ may tell you whether there is a block to full flexion or extension
from a bony spur or osteophyte (solid end-feel) or from soft tissue
thickening/fibrosis (springy, often painful).
• Note any crepitus (often associated with intra-articular pathology) and locking
(may have loose bodies in the joint).
Supinate and pronate the forearm
Passively supinate and pronate the forearm supporting the elbow in 90° of
flexion with your thumb over the radioulnar articulation:
• There may be crepitus or instability/subluxation associated with pain.
Instability might suggest a tear/damage to the annular ligament (due to trauma
or chronic/aggressive intra-articular inflammation).
Test peripheral nerve function if there are distal arm symptoms
• Given its course around the lateral epicondyle, the integrity of the radial nerve
should always be tested when a lateral elbow lesion is suspected.
• The median nerve runs in the antecubital fossa and may be affected in
traumatic elbow lesions. It is particularly susceptible where it runs between the
two heads of pronator teres (from medial epicondyle and the coronoid process
of the ulna) and separates into anterior interosseous and terminal median nerve
branches.
• The ulnar nerve lies in the groove behind the medial epicondyle. Bony or soft
tissue abnormality in this area may affect nerve function and lead to reduced
sensation in the little finger and weakness in the small muscles of the hand, the
flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), or the abductor
digiti minimi (ADM). The median and ulnar nerves are dealt with in more
detail in the later sections on wrist and hand disorders.
Investigation of elbow conditions in adults
Radiographs and other imaging

[SECTION]• Standard AP and lateral radiographs are the most straightforward way of
imaging the elbow initially. CT or MRI may then be needed if the diagnosis is
still obscure and referred pain can be ruled out.
• Look for periosteal lesions and enthesophytes (new bone spurs at clear
entheses like the triceps insertion). Periosteal new bone and enthesophytes are
typical in psoriatic arthritis (see Chapter 8).
• A lateral radiograph may identify displacement of the anterior fat pad
associated with a joint effusion (sail sign).
• Dislocations of the radial head and associated ulna fractures in children are
easily missed. To make this diagnosis a high degree of suspicion and further
imaging are often needed.
Needle arthrocentesis/olecranon bursocentesis
• Arthrocentesis/bursocentesis with fluid sent for microscopy and culture should
always be done in suspected cases of sepsis.
• Fluid should be sent for polarized light microscopy in cases of bursitis that
may be due to gout. Serum urate is worth requesting but may not be raised in
acute gout.
• Examination of fluid for crystals should always be considered in cases of
monoarthritis in the elderly or patients on dialysis.
Electrophysiology
If nerve entrapment is suspected and there is some uncertainty after clinical
examination, then electrophysiological tests may provide useful information.
Testing can help identify the degree and likely site of nerve damage and can help
to discriminate between a peripheral and nerve root lesion (if EMG of selected
muscles requested also).
Treatment of elbow conditions in adults
• The management of fractures is beyond the scope of this text.
• Epicondylitis is best managed early on with rest, splinting, analgesia, and local
steroid injections. The efficacy of physical manipulation has not been proven,
although there are theoretical reasons why ultrasound therapy could be of
value (e.g. it passes through the myofascial planes and concentrates near
bone). Resistant cases may benefit from surgery—a ‘lateral release’.
• Steroid injections (see
Chapter 24) may be of value in the following
situations:
• lateral or medial epicondylitis (hydrocortisone). See Plate 6.
• inflammatory arthritis (usually long acting steroid).
• olecranon bursitis.

[SECTION]• ulnar nerve entrapment.
• Surgical procedures include excision of nodules and bursae, transposition of
the ulnar nerve, synovectomy, excision of the head of the radius, and
arthroplasty.
• Arthroplasty in inflammatory arthritis is best reserved for severe pain and
should be undertaken by an experienced surgeon. Lesser procedures such as
proximal radial head excision can be effective to improve pain and function if
forearm pronation/supination are poor.
• Radiation synovectomy of the elbow (Re-186) for inflammatory arthritis,
PVNS, or synovial chondromatosis requires ultrasound guidance (see
guidelines available at http://www.eanm.org).

Elbow pain in children and adolescents
General considerations
The elbow is a common site of injury in children and adolescents; the growth
plate and entheseal attachments are vulnerable to overuse injury before skeletal
maturity.
• Characteristic injurious lesions are associated with specific activities (e.g.
baseball pitching or throwing sports, gymnasts).
• The two main entheses at the elbow—origin of long tendons to the fingers at
medial and lateral humeral epicondyles—can become inflamed or painful in
people with juvenile PsA or SpA.
• Examination of the elbow in young people is as for adults see p. 100. See
also functional anatomy see p. 98.
Table 3.6 Causes of elbow pain in children and adolescents

Lateral

Lateral humeral epicondylitis/enthesitis (caused by trauma or JSpA
or JPsA); osteochondritis and osteochondritis dissecans (adolescent
gymnasts); Panner’s disease (osteonecrosis of capitellum seen in
children aged 5–10 years and may be related to throwing injuries)

Medial

Wrist pain in adults
Functional anatomy of the wrist
• The wrist includes radiocarpal (scaphoid and lunate) and intercarpal
articulations. The ulna does not truly articulate with the lunate, but is joined to
it, the triquetrum, and the radius (ulnar side of distal aspect), by the triangular
fibrocartilage complex.
• The intercarpal joints are joined by intercarpal ligaments and are most stable
when the wrist is in full extension. Anterior carpal ligaments are stronger than
posterior ones and are reinforced by the flexor retinaculum. Wrist and finger
flexor tendons, the radial artery, and the median nerve enter the hand in a
tunnel formed by the carpal bones and the flexor retinaculum (carpal tunnel).
• Flexion (70°), extension (70°), radial and ulnar deviation (about 20° and 30°
from midline, respectively) occur at the wrist but supination/pronation of the
wrist and hand is due to radiohumeral movement at the elbow.
• Flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and ulnaris (FCU) are the main flexors of the wrist,
although palmaris longus (PL) also helps (Fig. 3.7). They all arise from the
medial humeral epicondyle.
• All carpal extensors arise from the lateral humeral epicondyle (Fig. 3.7).
• Radial deviation (abduction) occurs primarily when radial flexors and
extensors act together. Ulnar deviation (adduction) occurs primarily when
ulnar flexors and extensors act together.
Taking a history of wrist pain in adults
Table 3.7 details the major diagnoses for painful conditions of the wrist and
hand.
Determine the exact location of the pain
• Pain localizing only to the wrist most likely comes from local tissue pathology.
Cervical nerve root pain as a result of a C6, C7, or C8 lesion and pain from
peripheral nerve lesions is likely to be located chiefly in the hand.
• Pain at the base of the thumb, aggravated by thumb movements, in middle and
old age is typical of OA (see Chapter 6) of the trapezium-first metacarpal
joint. Pain in this area might also be due to tenosynovitis of thumb tendons.
Trauma history

[SECTION]Injury/post-injury conditions are common. Taking a history of trauma is
important.
• Common fractures in adults are scaphoid and base of the first metacarpal
(Bennett’s), and head of the radius (Colles’).
• Post-traumatic chronic wrist pain following injuries may be due to
ligamentous injury and chronic carpal instability or osteonecrosis (lunate).
• Unusual or florid pain descriptors suggest a regional pain syndrome (e.g.
CRPS; see Chapter 22).

Are there features to suggest synovitis?

[SECTION]• Pain due to wrist joint synovitis may be associated with ‘stiffness’ and be
worse at night or early morning. Stiffness ‘in the hand’ may have various
causes including multiple tendon/small joint synovitis, diabetic
cheiroarthropathy or systemic sclerosis (SScl; see Chapter 13).
• Wrist synovitis occurs commonly in adult RA and PsA.
• In the elderly, wrist synovitis may be due to CPPD arthritis (see Chapter 7).
The quality of the pain
• Although primary bone pathology is rare, local bony pain (unremitting, severe,
sleep disturbing) might suggest osteonecrosis or, if part of a wider pattern of
bony pain, metabolic bone disease.
• Radicular pain may be burning in quality and is typically associated with
numbness and paraesthesia. Such neurogenic pain is commonly due to nerve
root irritation or compression.
Other joint/MSK symptoms
• Wrist and extensor tendon sheath synovitis is a common presenting feature of
adult RA. Other joints may be affected.
• CPPD arthritis commonly involves the wrist, and can mimic RA in its joint
distribution and presentation in the elderly.
• Wrist synovitis and enthesitis occurs in SpA. Pain may be considerable,
although swelling is minimal. There may be inflammatory-type symptoms of
spinal pain and enthesitis elsewhere.
Ask specifically about job/leisure activities
• Repetitive lateral and medial wrist movements with thumb adducted can cause
tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus (APL) or the extensor pollicis
brevis (EPB), commonly called De Quervain’s tenosynovitis.
• If there is no obvious history of trauma, tendonitis may be a presenting feature
of a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease or even gonococcal infection in
adolescents and young adults.
• Overuse pain syndromes may occur as a result of repetitive activity. The term
‘repetitive strain injury’ is controversial. Objective assessment of pain,
location of swelling, etc., from the outset is invaluable in assessing the
response to treatment. Lack of objective findings (if imaging is normal)
suggests a regional pain disorder.
Examination of the wrist in adults
Visual inspection
Inspect the dorsal surface of both wrists looking for swelling, deformity, or loss

[SECTION]of muscle bulk (see Plate 7a):
• Diffuse swelling may be due to wrist joint or extensor tendon sheath synovitis
or both.
• A prominent ulna styloid may result from subluxation at the distal radioulnar
joint owing to synovitis or radioulnar ligament damage.
• Prominence (‘squaring’) of the trapezoid–first metacarpal joint commonly
occurs in OA of this joint.
• Loss of muscle bulk in the forearm may be due to a chronic T1 nerve root
lesion or disuse atrophy.
Flexion/extension range tests for major wrist lesions
• The normal range of both flexion and extension in adults is about 70°.
Synovitis invariably reduces this range.
• Substantial common flexor or extensor tendon swelling will probably block
the full range of wrist movements.
• There is normally an additional 20° of flexion and extension to the active
range with passive movement.
• Pain and crepitus are unlikely to be specific for any type of lesion.
Examine the dorsum of the wrist in detail
• Note any abnormal excursion of the ulnar styloid associated with pain and/or
crepitus suggesting synovitis.
• Post-traumatic carpal instability, particularly scapulolunate dissociation, is
relatively common. The latter is demonstrated by eliciting dorsal subluxation
of the proximal scaphoid pole by firm pressure on its distal pole as the wrist is
deviated radially from a starting position with the forearm pronated and the
wrist in ulnar deviation. Note any gap between scaphoid and lunate, and any
associated tenderness.
• Note any tenderness or thickening of the common extensor tendon sheath and
tendon sheath of APL and EPB.
• Tenderness at the base of the thumb may be due to wrist synovitis, carpal or
carpometacarpal OA, tenosynovitis, a ganglion, or a ligament lesion.
• Finkelstein’s test for De Quervain’s tenosynovitis may be used to elicit
APL/EPB tendon pain. With the thumb adducted and opposed, the fingers are
curled to form a fist. Passive ulnar deviation at the wrist stretches the abnormal
tendons and elicits pain. Although it is a sensitive test, it is not specific for
tendon pain.
• Protrusion of the thumb out of the fist on the ulnar side of the hand during the
first part of this test is unusual and suggests thumb, and perhaps general,

[SECTION]hypermobility.
Test the integrity of the tendons
Many muscles/tendons that move both the wrist and digits originate at the
elbow; therefore, the quality of information gained from isolated tendon
resistance tests (either for pain or strength) may be affected by pain elsewhere
around the wrist, wrist deformity, or elbow lesions.
• Interpret findings cautiously.
• Useful information might be obtained by passive movement of a tendon, rather
than by resisted active movement, and also by feeling for thickening or
crepitus of the tendons.
Investigation and treatment of wrist conditions in adults
The investigation and treatment of wrist conditions is covered in
in the hand in adults’, pp. 112–121.

‘Symptoms

Symptoms in the hand in adults
Symptoms in the hand are a common presenting feature of some systemic
conditions, and localized neurological and MSK lesions are common, especially
in adults. Detailed knowledge of anatomy is beyond the scope of this text.
Functional anatomy is important and the more common abnormalities are
summarized here.
Functional anatomy of the hand
The long tendons
• Digital power is provided primarily by flexor and extensor muscles arising in
the forearm. Their action is supplemented and modified by small muscles in
the hand. Precise movements of the hand are mainly due to small muscles.
• Powerful flexors (Fig. 3.7): flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), flexor
digitorum profundus (FDP), and flexor pollicis longus (FPL).
• FDS flexes proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPJs) and, more weakly,
metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPJs)/wrist.
• FDP flexes distal interphalangeal joints (DIPJs) and, increasingly weakly,
PIPJs, MCPJs/wrist.
• FPL flexes (at 90° to other digits) mainly the PIPJ, but also the whole thumb in
a power grip (see later).
• Powerful digital extensors (Fig. 3.7 and Fig. 3.8): extensor digitorum (ED)
arises from the lateral epicondyle splitting at the wrist to insert into each

[SECTION]•
•
•
•

digital dorsal expansion (digits two to five) that attaches to all three phalanges.
The fifth digit has an additional tendon, extensor digiti minimi (EDM) that
also arises at the lateral epicondyle.
APL abducts the thumb at the MCPJ, provided the wrist is stable.
EPB and EPL extend the thumb.
Extensor indicis (EI) arises from the ulna posterior border distal to EPL and
joins the index finger ED tendon.
The muscles of the thenar eminence (Table 3.8) act synchronously. All except
adductor pollicis (ulnar nerve, C8/T1) are supplied by the median nerve from
C8/T1 nerve roots. All three muscles are supplied by the ulnar nerve (C8/T1).

The intrinsic muscles
• The longitudinal muscles of the palm (four dorsal and four palmar interossei
and four lumbricals) all insert into digits.
• Palmar interossei from metacarpals 1, 2, 4, 5, insert into dorsal tendons.
• Each dorsal interosseous arises from origins on two adjacent metacarpals. The
muscles abduct the second and fourth fingers and move the middle finger
either medially or laterally.
• The four lumbricals (Fig. 3.9 and Table 3.9) arise from tendons of FDP in the
palm passing to the lateral side of each MCPJ inserting into the dorsal
expansions.
• The interossei combine with lumbricals to facilitate fine control of flexion and
extension of MCPJs and PIPJs.

• For power, the wrist extends and adducts slightly, and the long digital flexors
contract.
• A modified power grip, the hook grip, is used to carry heavy objects like a
suitcase. The thumb is extended out of the way and extension at MCPJs
accompanies flexion at PIPJs/DIPJs.
• More precision in the grip can be obtained using varying degrees of thumb
adduction, abduction, and flexion. The thumb can be opposed with any of the
four other digits depending on the shape of the object to be held and the type
of manipulation required.

Taking a history of hand symptoms in adults
A history of acute or overuse trauma with subsequent localized symptoms
requires a straightforward application of anatomical knowledge, precise
examination, and judicious choice of imaging techniques for diagnosis.
However, there are subtler or less easily delineated patterns of symptoms in the
hand, particularly when pain is diffuse or poorly localized.
Is the pain associated with immobility or stiffness?
• Stiffness may be associated with joint or tendon synovitis but is not specific.
Prompting may provide more accurate localization of symptoms.
• If unilateral, especially on the dominant hand, be suspicious that diffuse hand
pain may be due to a regional pain syndrome.
Is stiffness local or diffuse?
• Patterns of joint involvement in autoimmune rheumatic disease and
polyarticular arthritis are summarized in Chapter 2.
• If localized in the palm, there may be Dupuytren’s contracture (associated with
diabetes). If diffuse, there may be thickening of soft tissue from a systemic
process, e.g. hypothyroidism, SScl, diabetic cheiroarthropathy, or disorders of
mucopolysaccharide metabolism (the latter especially in infants, although
Fabry’s disease can present in adulthood with acroparaesthesias and palmar
telangiectasia).
• Stiffness due to an upper motor neuron lesion (an interpretation of increased
tone) is unlikely to be confined to the hand and is likely to be associated with
weakness. The pattern of symptoms over time should give a clue to its

[SECTION]aetiology.
Are there neurologic qualities to the pain or characteristics typical of a
common nerve lesion?
• ‘Burning’ or ‘deep’ episodic pain varying with head, neck, and upper spinal
position is typical of cervical nerve root pain. Ask about occupation and other
activities that are associated with neck problems, the relationship with sleep
posture, and frequent headaches.
• Pain on the radial side of the hand waking the patient at night and often
relieved, at least partially, by shaking the hand is typical of median nerve
entrapment in the wrist. However, pain in this condition is often poorly
localized at initial presentation. Remember other lesions that produce pain in
the area around the thumb base: trapezoid–first metacarpal joint OA,
tenosynovitis of APL/EPB (De Quervain’s) or EPL, referred pain from a C6
nerve root lesion, and ligament lesions (e.g. ulnar collateral ligament of first
MCP—‘skier’s thumb’).
Tingling/pins and needles/numbness
Make sure both you and the patient understand what you each mean by these
terms:
• Symptoms usually denote cervical nerve root or peripheral nerve compression,
although they can reflect underlying ischaemia.
• Tingling in the fingertips of both hands, however, is recognized to occur
commonly in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia.
• Symptoms associated primarily with specific positions of the whole arm may
be due to thoracic outlet compression of neurovascular structures.
Pain arising from bone
Pain in the hands arising from bones may be difficult to discriminate.
Radiographs will often lead to confirmation of the diagnosis:
• The most common tumour in the hand is an enchondroma. It is usually
painless. If they are painful, then one should suspect infarction or malignant
change.
• Secondary metastases and malignant bone tumours in the hand are rare, but
must be ruled out in children, adolescents, and young adults with persistent
localized bone pain.
• Paget’s disease of hand bones can occur, but is relatively rare.
• Digital bone pain from osteomalacia/rickets occurs, but is unusual at
presentation.
• Digital pain may rarely be due to sarcoidosis, hyperparathyroid bone disease,

[SECTION]thyroid acropachy, hypertrophic (pulmonary) osteoarthropathy (HO), or
pachydermoperiostitis. Look for clubbing.
Ischaemic pain?
A history suggestive of ischaemic pain in the hands is rare in rheumatologic
practice. Persistent ischaemic digital pain can complicate systemic sclerosis and
severe Raynaud’s (see Chapter 13):
• Digital vasomotor instability (e.g. Raynaud’s disease (RD); see Chapter 13)
is episodic, triggered by cold and emotion, and characterized by digital colour
changes: white/blue then red.
• Pain from vasculitis is likely to be persistent and associated with a purpuric
rash, nailfold infarcts, or splinter haemorrhages.
• Ischaemic pain associated with cervicothoracic posture or prolonged arm
elevation may be due to a lesion of the thoracic outlet.
• Pain may be due to thromboembolism (e.g. antiphospholipid syndrome),
infective endocarditis, or thromboarteritis obliterans (Buerger’s disease).
‘Swelling’
Examination is more reliable than a history:
• Apart from isolated lesions, such as ganglia, patients’ description of soft tissue
or joint swelling may be unreliable and should be substantiated by
examination.
• Nerve lesions can give the impression that swelling is present (think what a
dentist’s local anaesthetic does for your lip!). Patients with carpal tunnel
syndrome, for example, can complain of the hand swelling at night.
‘Weakness’
Ask about trauma, neck, and median nerve entrapment symptoms:
• Acute tendon injuries are common industrial accidents. Chronic occupational
overuse may also lead to rupture.
• If weakness is profound and there has been no obvious trauma, the cause is
likely to be neuromuscular.
• If not associated with pain, weakness is more likely to be neurological than
MSK in origin.
• Weakness associated with pain may be due to a neurologic or MSK lesion, the
latter situation often due to an inability to use the hand (or part of it) because
of pain or an alteration in biomechanical function as a result of deformity,
which may only be slight.
• True weakness associated with stiffness is associated with myelopathy or even
motor neuron disease.

[SECTION]• A detailed history of the progression of symptoms is important and neurologic
examination should be thorough.
Trigger finger
This may denote tenosynovitis of a digital flexor tendon. Damage to the tendon
and its sheath can result in a fibrous nodule attached to the tendon that moves
and catches under the proximal annular ligament just distal to the MCPJ. It may
not be painful. This most commonly affects the middle and ring fingers, and is
prevalent among professional drivers, cyclists, and those in occupations
requiring repeated use of hand-held heavy machinery.
Examination of the hand: adults
The following sequence is comprehensive, but should be considered if a general
condition is suspected. Often an examination only needs to be more specifically
directed.
Inspection of the nails and fingers
• Pits/ridges and dactylitis are associated with psoriatic arthritis (see Plate 8
and Chapter 8).
• Splinter haemorrhages may be traumatic, but are associated with infective
endocarditis or vasculitis (see Chapter 13).
• Obvious cuticle damage and punctate cuticle erythema (dilated capillary
loops) are features of secondary RD or SScl (see Plate 9).
• Periungual erythema is associated with a number of autoimmune rheumatic
and connective tissue diseases.
• Multiple telangiectasias are associated with lcSScl (see Chapter 13).
• Diffuse finger thickening (dactylitis) may be due to gross tendon thickening
(e.g. SpA or sarcoid), or connective tissue fibrosis/thickening (SScl,
cheiroarthropathy). Bony or soft tissue DIPJ or PIPJ swelling should be
discriminated.
• A shiny/waxy skin appearance may indicate scleroderma/morphoea.
• Scattered, tiny, non-blanching dark red punctate lesions are typical of
cutaneous skin vasculitis.
• Erythematous or violaceous scaly papules/plaques over MCPJs or PIPJs may
suggest dermatomyositis (see Chapter 14).
Note any diffuse swelling of the hand
• Diffuse soft tissue/skin swelling, may occur in association with RA, CPPDpseudogout, CRPS, and SScl.
• RS3PE (remitting seronegative symmetric synovitis with pitting oedema),

[SECTION]which presents mainly in adults in their 70s, may be a distinct type of nonerosive polyarticular/tendon synovitis, but may be associated with other, often
haematological, conditions.
• Swelling associated with CRPS may be localized or diffuse (see Plate 10).
Skin may be shiny and later there is often a dark red or blue mottled
appearance.
• Typical skin appearances are critical to making a clinical diagnosis of
scleroderma. The skin may be initially puffy, but later shiny and tight and,
with progression, atrophic with contractures.
Note any muscle wasting
Wasting may be due to a degree of chronic denervation (e.g. the thenar eminence
in CTS), disuse atrophy (e.g. painful polyarthropathy, joint hypomobility), or
catabolism of muscle (e.g. polymyositis, RA). In the elderly, there may be agerelated muscle loss (‘sarcopenia’).
Note any deformity of digits
• Deformities tend to occur with long-standing polyarticular joint disease, e.g.
OA, severe RA, and psoriatic arthritis.
• Isolated deformities may be due to previous bone or tendon trauma, severe
neurological lesions and Dupuytren’s contracture. A mallet finger (loss of
active DIPJ extension) is due to rupture of the distal extensor tendon
expansion usually due to direct trauma.
Inspect the palm and dorsum of the hand
• Palmar erythema is not specific, but is associated with autoimmune disorders
of connective tissue and joints.
• Check for Dupuytren’s disease (fascial thickening on ulnar side).
• On the dorsum of the hand, ganglia and swelling of the common extensor
tendon sheath are usually easily noted. Swelling of the extensor tendon sheath
is commonly associated with RA in adults.
Palpation of joints and nodules
Palpation of joints and nodules is best done using thumb pads with the patient’s
wrist supported:
• Swelling should be noted for site, consistency, tenderness, and mobility.
Osteophytes and exostosis are periarticular or at sites of pressure, may be
tender, but are always fixed (see Plate 7d).
• Ganglia are hard and usually quite mobile (can occur anywhere).
• Rheumatoid nodules (occur anywhere, but typically on the dorsum of the hand

[SECTION]and the extensor surface of the elbow) and tophi (usually distal) are rubbery,
hard, relatively fixed, but may be moved (see Plate 7a).
• Synovitis is often represented by soft (‘boggy’), often springy, swelling around
a joint. It may be tender and warm but this is not invariable.
• Synovitis in a single joint may be due to autoimmune rheumatic disease, OA,
infection, or foreign-body synovitis (e.g. rose thorn synovitis).
Palpate tendons in the palm or on the volar aspect of the phalanges
• Thickening, tenderness, and crepitus suggest tenosynovitis, but tenosynovitis
can be hard to spot if it is mild.
• Tethering and thickening of tendons in the palm associated with excessive
digital flexion when the hand is at rest and a block to passive finger extension
suggests chronic flexor tenosynovitis (take care to note any contributory joint
damage).
• Passive tendon movement by gently flexing/extending a proximal phalanx
may disclose palpable tendon nodules, crepitus and tenderness.
Discriminate Dupuytren’s disease from flexor tendinopathy
Dupuytren’s disease (a fascia contracture) typically involves the fourth and fifth
fingers (40% bilateral). It is common in males aged 50–70 years. The fascia
extends to the second phalanx, thus, if severe, the condition causes fixed flexion
of MCPJs and PIPJs. It is associated with epilepsy, diabetes, and alcoholism, and
usually is not painful.
Investigation of wrist and hand disorders: adults
Radiographs
• An AP view of the hand and wrist is a useful screening investigation to
characterize a polyarthropathy and diagnose traumatic and metabolic bone
lesions (Table 3.10).
• Radiographs may reveal soft tissue swelling around joints compatible with a
diagnosis of synovitis.
• Radiographs are insensitive for identifying erosions in early autoimmune joint
disease.
• An oblique view of the hand may add information about joint erosions if an
erosive MCPJ arthritis is considered.
• Lateral and carpal tunnel views of the carpus can be obtained by varying the
degree of X-ray projection angle; however, unless searching for evidence of
fracture these views are rarely needed.

Cove. Bases of erosions sclerosed

[SECTION]Further imaging: US, MRI, and bone scintigraphy
• In experienced hands, US can be a useful way of looking for early synovitis
and patterns of abnormality in association with median nerve entrapment.
• MRI may demonstrate a torn or avulsed triangular cartilage in patients with a
post-traumatic painful wrist or with carpal instability.
• MRI images of the carpal tunnel are useful in confirming median nerve
compression/tethering and soft tissue wrist pathology, particularly when
symptoms recur after carpal tunnel release surgery.
• MRI can provide valuable information about the degree and distribution of
inflammatory disease in joints and tendons, particularly in children and
patients where history and examination are difficult.
• MRI is more sensitive than radiography in identifying joint erosions in RA.
Choosing MRI over US depends on availability and sonographer experience.
• Bone scintigraphy is not specific for any single condition, but in young adults
(after closure of epiphyses and before OA is likely) it may be useful for
disclosing patterns of inflammation at and around joints and entheses. 99mTclabelled human immunoglobulin is more specific for detecting patterns of
synovitis in children and adults.
Laboratory investigations
• FBC, ESR, CRP: the characteristic, though non-specific, picture in patients
with a systemic inflammatory condition such as RA is mild anaemia with
normal (or slightly hypochromic, microcytic) red cell indices, high or
high/normal platelets, and increased acute phase.
• Notably in PsA and in SpA the acute phase measures may be low, even
normal, even when there is widespread pain/disease activity.
• Lymphopenia frequently accompanies autoimmune disease.
• Neutrophils are raised in infection, with steroids, with crystal-induced arthritis,
and in adult-onset Still’s disease (see Chapter 18).
• Blood urea, electrolytes, creatinine, and urate will detect hyperuricaemia and
renal impairment associated with gout.
• Blood calcium, phosphate, albumin, vitamin D, alkaline phosphatase, and PTH
will screen for metabolic bone disease. Test all components to interpret fully
the metabolic picture.
• Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACPA) are
useful for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis.
• Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and a screen of extractable nuclear antibodies
(ENAs) may be helpful for the evaluation of a number of disorders, including
SLE and scleroderma.

[SECTION]• Other investigations to consider: serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
for sarcoidosis, glycosylated haemoglobin in diabetics, serum, and urinary
protein electrophoresis for myeloma.
Other investigations
• Neurophysiology (EMG/NCS) is a useful adjunct to clinical examination in
diagnosis of upper limb neuropathies.
• Joint/bursa fluid aspiration is mandatory in suspected cases of sepsis and
should be sent for culture and microscopy (request Gram stain and polarized
light microscopy of fluid from the lab).
Treatment of wrist and hand disorders in adults
Treatments for specific diseases are considered in the relevant chapters in Part II
of this book. Management of the soft tissue lesions in the hand and wrist, like
elsewhere, combines periods of rest and splinting with active physical therapy,
avoidance of repetitive activity, and analgesia. In most cases, the condition will
resolve spontaneously, but severe or persistent pain and disability may warrant
input from a hand occupational therapist, local steroid injections, or occasionally
surgical soft tissue decompression:
• Conditions that respond to local steroid therapy (see Chapter 24):
• tenosynovitis, e.g. De Quervain’s.
• tendon nodules and ganglia.
• flexor tenosynovitis (and trigger finger).
• Dupuytren’s contracture.
• carpal tunnel syndrome.
• synovitis: radiocarpal and radioulnar at the wrist, MCPJs and PIPJs, first
carpometacarpal.
• The accuracy of needle placement is likely to be improved by US guidance;
however, greater efficacy from an US procedure versus blind injection has not
yet been shown.
• The principles of steroid injection are dealt with in Chapter 24.
• Functional evaluation (from a physical and occupational therapist) is likely to
be of use in cases of polyarthropathy. Early use of splints, orthotics, and
exercises may lead to greater functional ability and a decrease in symptoms.
• Surgical options for the hand and wrist may include:
• fusion or resection of the carpal bones.
• ulna styloidectomy and wrist synovectomy (RA).
• tendon repair and transfer operations (RA).
• synovectomy of joints and/or tendons (RA).

[SECTION]• fusion of small joints.
• PIP/MCP joint replacements.
• Dupuytren’s release/fasciectomy.
• carpal tunnel release.
• trapeziectomy for thumb CMC joint OA.
Many of these procedures primarily reduce pain; function may not be restored.

Wrist and hand pain in children and adolescents
General considerations
Isolated MSK lesions in the wrist and hands of children are rare. A few notable
conditions exist.
• Small swellings may be ganglia—resolve spontaneously in 50%.
• Congenital trigger thumb or finger is not rare and can affect 1 in 300 children.
Spontaneous resolution occurs in up to 60% within 2 years.
• Swelling in wrists and fingers may denote JIA. US is a relatively easy and
acceptable way of confirming synovitis is present in joints in young children,
though older children may tolerate MRI.
• Wrist pain and swelling may be the key presenting feature of rickets,
especially in a child or adolescent with a severely restricted diet.
• Digital vasomotor instability is more commonly seen in children with
neurological conditions including cerebral palsy.
• Assessment of Raynaud’s Disease, typically in adolescents, is similar to that in
adults (see Chapter 13) and erythromelalgia, which causes marked redness
of hand and feet associated with diffuse pain, swelling and distress, is more
commonly seen in toddlers than older children.
• Digital ulcers and ischaemic lesions, Gottron’s patches and nail bed vascular
changes may indicate SLE, JDM or SScl.
• Although CRPS (see Chapter 22), is occurs in children, it is less common
than in adults.
• Wrist pain may be the presenting feature of a skeletal dysplasia—a wrist
radiograph should be obtained. Specialist centre radiologist input can be
helpful in such cases (e.g. dREAMS: http://www.d-reams.org)
• Assessment of the wrist and hand in children and adolescents is essentially
similar to the assessment in adults.
• For functional anatomy of the wrist see pp. 106–107, and for the hand, see
pp. 112–115.

[SECTION]Upper limb peripheral nerve lesions
Background
• Upper limb peripheral nerve lesions are common. Most are entrapment
neuropathies. Occasionally, nerve trauma may present to primary care
providers or rheumatologists with (primarily) regional muscle weakness.
• Although not specific for its diagnosis, the combination of pain, paraesthesia,
numbness, and weakness is suggestive of nerve entrapment. Features may be
considered more specific for nerve entrapment if there is a history of acute or
overuse trauma proximal to the distribution of the symptoms.
• Lesions may characteristically occur in association with specific activities,
occupations, or sports (e.g. ulnar neuropathy in cyclists).
• Accurate diagnosis relies on demonstration of the anatomic lesion. Useful in
this respect is knowledge of likely sites of entrapment or damage and, in the
case of entrapment, the ability to elicit a positive Hoffman–Tinel sign (i.e.
pressure or percussion over entraped nerve course eliciting sensory symptoms
in the nerve distribution).
• Always compare examination findings in both upper limbs.
• Neurophysiologic examination is an adjunct to clinical diagnosis. It should not
be relied on to make a diagnosis in the absence of good clinical assessment.
• MRI of nerve roots/spine and potential sites of distal nerve entrapment can be
used, with clinical assessment and neurophysiology, to pinpoint with high
accuracy, any nerve lesion in the upper limb.
The long thoracic nerve
• Entrapment is in the differential diagnosis of painless shoulder weakness. The
nerve origin is at C5–C7, and its course runs beneath the subscapularis and
into the serratus anterior.
• Muscle paralysis is often painless and implies loss of the last 30° of overhead
arm extension, disrupted scapular rhythm, and scapula winging. Winging is
demonstrated by inspection from behind with the patient pressing against a
wall with an outstretched arm.
• Damage to the nerve occurs typically from an anterior direct blow or brachial
plexus injury. Damage sometimes occurs after carrying heavy backpacks (e.g.
army recruits) or after surgical resection of a cervical rib.
• It can also occur spontaneously after infection. There is no specific treatment.
The suprascapular nerve
• The nerve origin is at roots C4–C6; its course is lateral and deep to the

[SECTION]•

•
•

•
•

trapezius, through the suprascapular notch, terminating in the supraspinatus
and posteriorly in the infraspinatus. It carries pain fibres from the
glenohumeral joint and AC joint.
Impingement of the nerve at the suprascapular notch should be considered in a
patient complaining of shoulder pain despite a normal examination and
imaging tests.
Injury to the nerve often gives diffuse shoulder pain, although painless
paralysis of the muscles can occur.
Injury is often thought to occur from repeated stretching of the nerve at the
notch. Weightlifters are prone to bilateral injury and volleyball players prone
to dominant side injury.
Neuromyopathy (acute weakness, pain, CK+, muscle wasting on MRI?
secondary to infection) of supraspinatus or infraspinatus is not uncommon.
Compression by ganglia or tumours (and even possibly gout tophi) occurs and
can be confirmed by MRI.

Ulnar nerve
The ulnar nerve originates from C8 and T1. It lies along the medial side of the
brachial artery in the upper arm, then above the medial humeral epicondyle
where it passes posteriorly, piercing the medial intermuscular septum. It then
runs behind the elbow in a groove between the olecranon and medial epicondyle,
covered by a fibrous sheath and arcuate ligament (cubital tunnel). Following the
line of the ulna in the flexor compartment of the forearm, branches supply the
flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU). The nerve
enters the hand on the ulnar side dividing into superficial (palmaris brevis and
skin over the medial one and a half digits) and deep (small muscles of the hand)
branches:
• Lesions are usually due to entrapment.
• The ulnar nerve is occasionally damaged in the relatively exposed cubital
tunnel (cubital tunnel syndrome) resulting in pain and paraesthesia along the
medial forearm, wrist, and fourth/fifth digits. Damage may occur from direct
trauma, compression, or recurrent subluxation. The Tinel test at the elbow may
be positive and there might be sensory loss over the palmar aspect of the fifth
digit.
• There are a number of sites where entrapment of the ulnar nerve may occur
around the wrist, either proximal to the volar carpal ligament or beneath it or
the pisohamate ligament. External compression, acute or recurrent trauma, and
ganglia are the usual causes. Symptoms have been noted in cyclists, users of
pneumatic or vibrating tools and in avid videogame players. Entrapment of the

[SECTION]•

purely sensory cutaneous branch can occur from excess computer mouse use.
Motor weakness may be most evident by observing general muscle wasting in
the hand (hypothenar eminence, interossei, adductor pollicis) and flexion
deformity of the fourth and fifth digits—the latter caused by third and fourth
lumbrical weakness (see Plate 11).
Flexion of the wrist with ulnar deviation (FCU) and thumb adduction may be
weak (adductor pollicis weakness will be evident if you ask the patient to ‘run
the thumb across the base of the fingers’ as normally it can sweep across
touching the skin).
Froment’s sign also signifies weakness of the adductor pollicis, and is
demonstrated by a weakness in holding paper between the thumb and the
index finger when both are in the sagittal plane.
Discrimination of a wrist site from an elbow site of nerve entrapment is helped
by the site of a positive Hoffman-Tinel test, preservation of power of wrist
flexion/medial deviation (FCU) in a wrist lesion, and electrophysiology.
Rest, analgesia, and occasionally local steroids are helpful. A review of
posture, repetitive activity, and a biomechanical assessment with changes in
activities and technique are recommended. Surgical decompression may also
be necessary.

Radial nerve
The nerve origin is at roots C5–C8, and its course runs anterior to subscapularis
then passes behind the humerus in a groove that runs between the long and
medial heads of triceps. It then winds anteriorly around the humeral shaft to lie
between brachialis and brachioradialis. In the flexor compartment of the arm it
divides at the level of the lateral epicondyle into superficial branch
(cutaneous/sensory) and the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN), which runs
through the supinator muscle into the forearm to supply the extensor
compartment muscles:
• Entrapment needs to be considered in those cases of shoulder or upper arm
trauma, where subsequent presentation includes arm and wrist weakness.
• Compression of the radial nerve in the upper arm causes stiffness in the dorsal
arm and forearm, weakness of the wrist, and little finger extension. The triceps
is usually unaffected as the nerve supply to the muscle leaves the radial nerve
proximally.
• Transient compression of the nerve at the site of the medial head of triceps has
been described in tennis players.
• Compression can occur as the nerve pierces the lateral intermuscular septum
just distal to the radial head and also where the PIN pierces the supinator.

[SECTION]• At this lower site, compression is often a consequence of trauma, may be
associated with a positive Hoffman-Tinel test and local tenderness, and the
pain may be reproduced by extreme passive forearm pronation combined with
wrist flexion. Symptoms may mimic those of lateral epicondylitis. Surgical
exploration may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis.
Median nerve
The nerve origin is from C6–T1 nerve roots. Its course from the brachial plexus
runs together with the brachial artery in the upper arm (supplying nothing) then
enters the forearm between the two heads of pronator teres (from medial humeral
epicondyle and coronoid process of the ulna). It runs deep in the forearm
dividing into median and anterior interosseous branches. The median branch
enters the hand beneath the flexor retinaculum on the radial side of the wrist. All
pronator and flexor muscles in the forearm (except FCU and the medial half of
FDP) are supplied by the two branches. The median supplies sensory nerves to
the radial side of the hand:
• Entrapment syndrome at the wrist is very common; CTS.
• In the rare pronator syndrome, trauma, swelling, or masses between the two
pronator heads can cause entrapment giving lower arm pain, paraesthesias, and
weakness of forearm pronation. There is local tenderness and reproduction of
pain from resisted forearm pronation or wrist flexion.
• Pain in CTS is often present at night and relieved by exercising the hand.
Daytime symptoms can persist. Pain can be referred up the arm even to the
shoulder. Sensory symptoms are confined to the radial three and a half digits.
• Clumsiness is a common early feature of CTS.
• Symptoms reproduced by a positive Tinel’s sign (percussion over the volar
aspect of the wrist) and Phalen’s manoeuver (volar aspect of the wrist rested
on the back of a chair and the hand allowed to fall loosely under gravity, held
for 1 min) indicates nerve compression.
• A severe or chronic lesion is associated with sensory testing abnormality (Fig.
3.10) and motor weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), opponens
pollicis, and the first and second lumbricals.
• NCSs are indicated if the diagnosis is uncertain, the condition is progressive,
motor neuron disease is suspected (thenar muscle wasting marked/progressive
with minimal sensory symptoms), dual pathology is suspected, surgical
decompression is being considered, and in cases of surgical failure. Falsenegative results occur in 10% of cases.
• MRI appears to be more sensitive than US for detecting abnormalities
involving the median nerve in or around the carpal tunnel.

[SECTION]• Aetiology of CTS is debated, but probably multifactorial. The following are
associated: Colles’ fracture, trauma, carpal OA, diabetes, inflammatory
joint/tendon disease (e.g. RA, SScl), ganglia, menopause and pregnancy.
Hypothyroidism, acromegaly, amyloid, and benign tumours are also associated
with CTS.
Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)
( Chapter 24 has further information on steroid injection techniques.)
• Night splinting may be curative, especially early in the condition.
• NSAIDs are helpful if there is underlying inflammatory disease.
• Local steroid injections are of value. If partial remission is achieved, consider
repeating the injection (see Chapter 24).
• Surgical decompression is indicated when there is failure of conservative
therapy,
progressive/persistent
neurological
changes,
or
muscle
atrophy/weakness.
• Failure of surgical release of the carpal tunnel requires further consideration of
underlying causes such as a ganglion or other soft tissue lesion. Reconsider
also whether there really is a mechanical/local or perhaps a subtler cause (e.g.
mononeuritis or peripheral neuropathy, entrapment at the pronator or nerve
root lesion).

upper limb. Approximate area of sensory change in lesions of the median (c) and ulnar (d) nerves.

Thoracic back and chest pain in adults
Background
• The thoracic segment (T1–T12) moves less than the lumbar and cervical spine.
Segmental movement in any direction is about 6°. However, given the number
of segments this can add up to appreciable mobility overall. Less segmental
movement results in reduced frequency of problems overall (only 6% of
patients attending a spinal clinic have thoracic spine problems).
• Ribs (1–10) articulate posteriorly with vertebrae at two points: the articular

[SECTION]facet of the rib head with the costovertebral facet on each vertebral body and
the articular facet of the rib tubercle with the costotransverse facet on each
vertebral lateral process. These are both synovial joints. Ribs 11 and 12 do not
have costotransverse joints.
• The ribs, each continuous with its costal cartilage, articulate anteriorly by a
synovial joint with the manubrium (1–2), sternum (2–7), each costal cartilage
above (8–10), or do not articulate (11/12 ‘floating ribs’).
• A massive block of spinal extensor muscles is responsible for maintaining the
body against gravity. Some extend over some distance (e.g. the spinalis
thoracis from the upper thoracic to the mid-lumbar spinous processes).
• Dermatomes are circumferential and extend from T2 at the clavicles to T10 at
the umbilicus. However, up to five nerve roots may contribute innervation of
any one point in a truncal dermatome.
Taking a history in adults
The interpretation of cardiac, oesophageal, or pleural chest pain as MSK in
origin can occur. It may result in missing a serious condition (Table 3.11 and
Table 3.12). Similarly, the interpretation of neurogenic or MSK chest pains as
cardiogenic, oesophageal, or pleural can occur and may lead to unnecessary
investigations.
Table 3.11 Characteristics of chest pain in adults: from non-neurological and non-MSK pathology

Process

Characteristics of pain

Angina

Gradual onset often related to exercise, a heavy meal, or
emotion. Squeezing, strangling, or constriction in chest, can
be aching or burning in nature. Commonly substernal, but
radiates to any of anterior chest, interscapular area, arms
(mainly left), shoulders, teeth, and abdomen. Reduces with
rest and sublingual nitrates

Myocardial
infarction

Similar to above regarding quality and distribution. Longer
duration. Less easily relieved

Pericardial
Sharp or steady substernal pain. Can be referred to shoulder
inflammation tip, anterior chest, upper abdomen, or back. Often has a
pleural component and is altered by change in position—
sharper more left-sided when supine but eased by leaning
forward

[SECTION]Aortic
dissection

Acute onset with extremely severe peak. Felt in centre of
chest or back. Lasts for hours

Pleuritic
Common. Sharp, knife-like, superficial. Aggravated by deep
inflammation inspiration, sneezing, or coughing. If accompanied by
haemoptysis consider pulmonary embolism
Mediastinal
conditions

Empyema or surgical emphysema may be intense and sharp
and radiate from substernal to shoulder area. Associated with
crepitus. Mediastinitis and tumour pain resembles pleural
pain. May have constant feeling of constriction/oppression

Peptic
disease

Penetrating duodenal ulcers can cause intense, persistent midthoracic back pain

Oesophageal Persistent retrosternal burning is typical. Often post-prandial,
reflux
when lying or at night/early morning. Oesophageal spasm can
be similar to angina and can cause mid-thoracic back pain, but
reflux symptoms often coexist

In adolescents only

• A review of the quality and radiation of cardiac and oesophageal pain in the
clinical context should always be considered.
• Pleuritic pain is common. Chronic pulmonary emboli may be underdiagnosed
and have serious consequences. Any inflammatory, infective, or infiltrative
pleural lesion will be painful.
• Lesions confined to pulmonary parenchyma do not produce pain.
• Pericardial pain can be misinterpreted as MSK or pleuritic.
• Mediastinal abnormalities can produce pain that is often referred.
• Thoracic spine lesions can result in referred anterolateral chest pain.
• Costovertebral and costotransverse joint dysfunction is relatively common and
is generally age-related, but can occur in anyone with spinal deformity. It may
produce thoracic spine pain alone or result in an extensive pattern of radiation
of pain over the back, lateral, and anterior chest wall.
• Lower cervical spine lesions can refer pain to the anterior chest wall.
• Many painful chest conditions are associated with radiation of the pain down
the left arm. This pattern is not specific for myocardial ischaemia.
• Lower cervical pain may be referred to the inter-scapular region.
• Inter-scapular pain may also be associated with mechanical lumbar disorders.
Unlike infection, tumours, and fracture, referred pain is eased or abolished by

[SECTION]changes in position or posture.
• If there is thoracic back pain alone and it is acute and/or severe consider
osteoporotic fracture, tumours, and infection.
• Osteoporotic vertebral collapse is common in postmenopausal women. An
acute, non/minimal-trauma-associated severe pain is typical. Fractures occur in
many other situations, e.g. AS or a neoplastic bone lesion.
• Spinal infections should not be missed. The most common are Staphylococcus
aureus, Brucella, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Ask about the quality of pain
• MSK pain (local or referred) generally associates with specific movements,
positions, or postures, and is reproducible.
• Pain that increases with coughing, sneezing, or deep inspiration, is suggestive
of pleural lesions. Rib and intercostal lesions or costovertebral joint
dysfunction may also cause this sort of pain.
Ask about other symptoms and risk factors
• The pain from a fracture/lesion (osteoporotic, malignancy, infection) is often
localized and extreme, waking the patient at night.
• Acute or chronic thoracic spine lesions may be associated with cord
compression. Ask about recent change in sphincter function and progressive
lower limb stiffness or heaviness.
• Risks for osteoporosis (see Chapter 16).
• Systemic symptoms of fever (osteomyelitis).
• Bone pain elsewhere (metastases, osteomalacia, Paget’s disease).
• Spinal pain in adolescence (for an adult with kyphosis/spinal pain).
• A positive family history is recognized in idiopathic scoliosis, osteoporosis,
and generalized osteoarthritis (see Chapter 6).
• Depression and anxiety are important modulators of pain. However, although
thoracic back and chest pains may be psychogenic, it is unwise to settle on this
diagnosis without excluding MSK conditions and diseases of viscera that can
cause referred pain.
Examination of the (MSK) thorax in adults
Visual inspection
Observe the patient (who has undressed down to their underwear) from the back
and front. Look for deformity, asymmetry, swellings, and note the respiratory
pattern:
• Any scoliosis should be noted. Non-structural scoliosis is frequently due to

[SECTION]posture, severe back or abdominal pain, leg length discrepancy, and, rarely,
can be psychogenic. Structural scoliosis may be due to various lesions at any
age.
• There is a normal mild thoracic kyphos; however, marked kyphos in adults
(particularly postmenopausal women) might suggest multiple osteoporotic
vertebral fractures or degenerative disc disease. A loss of normal kyphosis (flat
spine) may be seen in spondylitis or possibly severe muscle spasm.
• Loose folds of skin on the back can denote height loss from multiple vertebral
fractures.
• Costochondral swelling occurs in some cases of costochondritis or SAPHO
(synovitis, acne, pustulosis (palmoplantar), hyperostosis, and (aseptic)
osteomyelitis) syndrome. Look for lesions of costosternal or sternoclavicular
joints (which are also found in PsA).
Palpation
Palpate over the vertebrae, paravertebral joints, and back musculature with the
patient prone. Palpate the anterior chest wall:
• Spinal osteomyelitis may be associated with obvious skin swelling and
erythema, exquisite focal tenderness, and extensor spasm. Tumours may give
similar signs, though skin erythema is not likely.
• Costotransverse joints may be tender (4–5 cm from midline). Discomfort at
any costovertebral joint and its referred pain can be elicited by individual rib
manipulation (downward pressure on the rib lateral to its vertebral joints when
the patient is prone).
• Identify any trigger points that reproduce myofascial pain in back muscles.
• Tender swelling of the sternoclavicular, costomanubrial, or sternocostal joints
may suggest spondyloarthritis (axSpA) or SAPHO syndrome. See Chapter
8.
• Inflammation of costal cartilages is often associated with painful swelling and
tenderness. Rib and intercostal lesions should be easily discriminated from
referred pain by eliciting local tenderness.
Check thoracic spinal movement
Movements of the thoracic spine should be checked. Ask the patient to sit on the
couch with their arms folded in front of them. Guided by movements of the
spinous processes, gauge the range of thoracic spine movement:
• Approximate normal ranges of movement in the above-mentioned position are
extension 30°, lateral flexion 30°, flexion 90°, and rotation 60°.
• Scoliosis is often associated with rotation that is accentuated, on examination,

[SECTION]on flexion.
• Abnormal mobility will not be specific for any underlying condition, but may
draw attention to the major affected spinal segment. Painful segments are
‘guarded’ and may appear hypomobile.
• AxSpA/ankylosing spondylitis (AS) may become obvious if there is extensive
spinal hypomobility.
• Chest expansion should be measured from forced expiration to complete
inspiration measuring at expansion, with a tape, at the level of the
xiphisternum.
Other examination
• Given the range of serious conditions causing chest pains, a full medical
examination is important and should always be considered.
• Neurological examination of the legs should be considered in anyone who is at
risk of spinal cord compression. Look for increased tone, weakness, and brisk
reflexes.
• Breast and axillary lymph node examination should be done.
Investigations of thoracic conditions in adults
Radiographs
• Lateral view radiographs generally provide more information about thoracic
spine lesions than anteroposterior views; however, together, both views should
confirm osteoporosis, degenerative disease (e.g. previous Scheuermann’s
osteochondritis, ochronosis, DISH), and Paget’s disease (see Chapter 16).
• Look for vertebral squaring (in axSpA/AS) and either marginal or nonmarginal syndesmophytes as in psoriatic spondylitis or other SpAs (see
Chapter 8).
• Discriminate enthesitis in SpA from DISH at the corners of vertebrae by the
presence of erosions with bone reaction (enthesitis) compared with bone
proliferation alone (DISH). Spondylodiscitis is part of the SpA spectrum of
diseases.
• Radiographs of the spine, or CT images, are probably a better indicated of PsA
in the spine compared with MRI.
• Normal radiographs do not exclude malignancy.
• Bone lesions can be well characterized by CT (e.g. osteoid osteoma).
MRI
• MRI is important in discriminating tumour from infection.
• Disc lesions, spinal canal, and cord are well visualized with MRI.

[SECTION]• Fat suppressed or contrast-enhanced MR sequences may be necessary to detect
enthesitis or spondylodiscitis associated with SpA.
Bone scintigraphy (99mTc-diphosphonate-MDP)
• Bone scintigraphy is a sensitive test for infection and malignancy.
• In suspected cases of malignancy, it is more sensitive than radiographs, can
often confirm the lytic or sclerotic nature of a lesion and will identify any
other skeletal sites of disease.
• The pattern of abnormalities in SAPHO syndrome are characteristic.
• It is a useful investigation in patients with malignancy who present with back
pain. A lack of additional lesions strongly suggests against a single spinal
abnormality being malignancy-related.
• Scintigraphic tomography can detect abnormality in the pars interarticularis,
facet joint, and disc/vertebral body.
• Scintigraphy sensitively identifies rib and, in most cases, inflammatory
intercostal lesions. The differential diagnosis is of a metastasis, primary
malignant or benign bone tumour, healed rib fracture, fibrous dysplasia,
Paget’s disease, hyperparathyroidism, or infection.
Other investigations to consider in patients with chest pain
• CXR, then consider pulmonary ventilation-perfusion scan and spiral CT to
evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
• CT of the chest in patients with unexplained pleural pain.
• ECG and an exercise stress test if possible cardiac ischaemia.
• Transthoracic echocardiography to show thickened pericardium or an effusion
associated with pericarditis.
• Upper GI endoscopy in suspected cases of peptic ulceration.
• Diagnostic trial of a proton pump inhibitor in cases of reflux oesophagitis.

Thoracic back and chest pain in children and
adolescents
General considerations
Chest pain is a common paediatric presentation to primary care and A&E in
patients aged 10–21 years. Acute chest pain is cardiac in <6% of patients.
• Chest pain is often alarming to parents and patients, but rarely caused by a
serious condition (Table 3.13).
• In a study of 300 patients with chronic chest pain there was a cardiac cause in

[SECTION]just one patient.
• Differentiating cardiac pain and other serious parenchymal pathology, from
musculoskeletal and other benign pain remains imperative.
• Paediatric chest pain can be classified into MSK, respiratory, GI, cardiac and
other conditions (see Table 3.13).
• For assessment of: thoracic back pain in children and adolescents see
Chapter 21 p. 618; low back pain in children see
p. 154; and thoracic
assessment in adults, see p. 130.
History and examination
General considerations
• Focal chest pain in children is usually chest-wall (MSK) or pleural in origin.
• Diffuse chest pain is most likely to be referred from internal organ pathology.
• A third of adolescents with chest pains who present to outpatients have a
history of stressful events. Their chest pain symptoms are typically associated
with other somatic complaints and sleep disturbance. Hyperventilation,
dyspnoea, dizziness, or paraesthesia may indicate panic attacks, unrecognized
by the patient or parent.

[SECTION]Cardiac history and examination
• Exertional chest pain with chest tightness and syncope might be due to atrial
flutter or tachycardia which in turn may be due to structural cardiac disease
(e.g. hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy).
• Angina chest pain is usually associated with exertion, a feeling of tightness,
and radiates to the neck, throat, jaw, teeth, or shoulder.
• Pericarditis presents as sharp retrosternal chest pain often radiating to the left
shoulder, aggravated by lying supine or deep breaths and relieved by bending
forward.
• Severe and tearing midsternal chest pain radiating to the back may be due to
aortic dissection in Marfan syndrome, Turner’s syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos type
IV, and homocystinuria.
• Though non-specific, chest pain with fatigue and exertional dyspnoea or
syncope can indicate pulmonary hypertension.
• Past medical history should be taken to note any previous Kawasaki disease or
cardiac surgery.
• Take a family history for arrhythmias, to note familial sudden death, genetic
conditions or hyperlipidaemia.
• Cardiac signs on examination: a harsh ejection systolic murmur radiating to
the neck in aortic stenosis; an ejection click from a stenosed bicuspid aortic
valve; abnormal peripheral pulses (e.g. previous Kawasaki disease).
Musculoskeletal features
• Chest wall pain exacerbated by deep breathing lasting seconds to minutes may
be due to costochondritis (e.g. secondary to infection or intercostal muscle
enthesitis in ERA or JSpA). Chest-wall tenderness may be present (usually
unilateral along the upper two or more contiguous costochondral joints).
• Tietze syndrome is a term used to describe anterior chest wall pain usually in a
single joint (commonly at the second or third rib articulation at the sternum or
sternoclavicular joint). Differential diagnosis SAPHO syndrome in adolescent
and enthesitis (see Chapter 16).
• Intense pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen may denote ‘slipping-rib’
syndrome, which is secondary to trauma and dislocation of ribs 8, 9, 10.
Noting a history of physical strain, sports-related injury, or direct trauma is
important.
• Slipping rib syndrome pain can be reproduced by hooking fingers under the
inferior rib margin and pulling the rib edge outward and upward (hooking
manoeuvre). This manoeuvre may produce a click.

[SECTION]• A history of sickle cell disease may be relevant given any MSK pains and
pulmonary disease (e.g. thromboembolism).
Pulmonary disease features
• Pulmonary disease is chiefly identifiable from a history of dyspnoea, cough,
and conventional respiratory symptoms.
• Severe pain, dyspnoea, and low oxygen saturations require both pulmonary
embolism and pneumothorax to be excluded.
Other
• Abdominal pathology can present with chest pain (e.g. typical ‘heartburn’
symptoms in the throat; cholecystitis-related chest pain radiating to the right
shoulder).
• Throbbing or burning focal chest pain locating to breast tissue is typical of
mastitis, fibrocystic disease, or pregnancy.
• Burning pain or paraesthesia in a dermatomal pattern, preceding a rash by a
few days suggests herpes zoster.

[SECTION]Low back pain in adults
(See also

Chapter 21.)

Epidemiology
• The lifetime prevalence of back pain is 58% and the greatest prevalence is
between 45 and 64 years of age.
• Most recent statistics report in the order of 12 million primary care
consultations and over 2.4 million adult specialist consultations annually in the
UK for low back pain (population 64 million). Low back pain is the fifth most
common reason for all physician visits in the USA.
• 2% of the workforce in the USA is compensated for back injuries every year.
• Estimated annual cost to the UK National Health Service is £500 million with
over £5 billion lost annually due to absence from work. The financial
healthcare and indirect employment costs of low back pain in the USA are
estimated to be more than $24 billion.
Lumbar and sacral spine anatomy
• There are normally five lumbar vertebrae. Anomalies are not uncommon at the
lumbosacral junction.
• The transition between the mobile lumbar spine (flexion, extension, and lateral
flexion) and fixed sacrum together with high weight-loading combine to make
the region highly prone to damage.
• The facet joints are sharply angled, effectively reducing rotation in lumbar
segments.
• The sacroiliac joints (synovial) are held firmly by a strong fibrous capsule and
tough ligaments. The amount of normal movement (essentially rotation) is
normally inversely proportional to age.
• The spinal cord ends at L1/L2. Nerves then run individually, are normally
mobile in the spinal canal, and together are termed the cauda equine.
• Each nerve exits its appropriate lateral intervertebral exit foramen passing
initially superior and then laterally to the disc, e.g. L4 from L4/L5 exit
foramen. However, in the spinal canal each nerve descends immediately
posterior to the more proximal intervertebral disc before it exits. Thus, for
example, L4 root symptoms can occur from either lateral herniation of the
L4/5 disc or posterior herniation of the L3/L4 disc (or from both).
• Facet joint innervation is from posterior primary rami, each of which supplies
the corresponding joint at its level, one higher and one lower.

[SECTION]Basic principles of assessment
• Low back pain can arise from damage or inflammation of the thoracic or
lumbar spines or from the posterior pelvis. Pathology in retroperitoneal
abdominal and pelvic viscera can result in referred pain to the low back.
• A simple way of categorizing back pain is to consider its cause to be
mechanical, inflammatory, neurologic, referred, or due to bone pathology
(Table 3.14).
• Over 90% of episodes of low back pain in adults are mechanical, self-limiting,
and do not require investigation.
• Indicators for further investigation include age >55 years, stiffness, focal pain,
pain that disturbs sleep, nerve root symptoms, and chronic persistent (>6
weeks) pain.
• The low back is often a focus for those who may use pain (consciously or
unconsciously) as a protective device in the face of domestic, emotional, or
occupational stress. These stresses commonly influence the description and
impact of pain but rarely act alone in causing pain—there is usually some
underlying organic pathology.

Taking a history of low back pain in adults
Differentiate whether the pain is likely to be primarily mechanical or
inflammatory, due to bone pathology or referred:
• The site and extent of the pain does not easily discriminate the cause. All
disorders may be associated with mechanical deformity and/or muscle spasm
that may cause pain in a diffuse distribution.
• Generally, pain due to mechanical lesions is often acute in onset, while
patients with pain from inflammatory lesions often present after symptoms
have been present for some time.
• Inflammatory pain is often associated with morning stiffness that can last for
several hours and is eased by movement. Mechanical lesions tend to worsen
with use. Many ‘mechanical’ or ‘degenerative’ lesions may have an
inflammatory component, e.g. internal disc disruption causing discogenic pain.
• Intrinsic bone pathology often causes severe, unremitting, focal pain. Sleep is
disturbed. Pain does not ease substantially with movement.
• About 3% of patients presenting with back pain have non-MSK causes. A
significant proportion of women have pelvic conditions such as ovarian cysts
or endometriosis. Pain may be cyclical.
• For those aged >55 with no previous similar episodes of pain increase
suspicion of an underlying neoplastic lesion. Investigation is required.
• Associated systemic symptoms are common in osteomyelitis and may be
present if a malignancy has disseminated.
Ask about pain radiation and symptoms in the legs
• Progressive neurological leg symptoms suggest a worsening/expanding lesion
such as a tumour, infection/vertebral collapse, Paget’s disease, or lumbosacral
spinal stenosis.
• Pressure on the cauda equina sufficient to cause a disturbance in perineal
sensation and/or bowel/bladder paralysis is a neurosurgical emergency (cauda

equina syndrome; see Chapter 21).
Leg pain caused by nerve root irritation/compression is often clearly defined
and sharp, often accompanied by numbness or paraesthesias. The most
commonly involved nerve roots are L4, L5, or S1. Pain generally radiates to
below the knee and often, but not always, to the heel and big toe.
Sciatic nerve entrapment at the piriformis muscle can produce identical
radicular symptoms to L5 or S1 nerve root entrapment.
Neurological symptoms in the distribution of the femoral nerve (primarily
anterior thigh musculature) might suggest a high lumbar nerve root lesion
(L1–L3, for example).
Disc prolapse is the most common cause of nerve root pain, but bony
encroachment at the nerve root exit foramen by vertebral end-plate or facet
joint osteophytes, and/or soft tissue thickening or fibrosis can cause similar
pain (foramenal stenosis).
Annular disc tears and internal disruption (i.e. microfractures in vertebral endplates) can cause a pattern of pain, termed discogenic pain, characterized by
low back and referred buttock/posterior thigh pain aggravated by movement.
Generally, all mechanical lesions of the lumbar spine can result in referred
pain around the pelvis and anterior thighs. However, pain from lumbar facet
joints and probably other segmental structures can be referred to the lower leg.
Aching in the back and posterior thighs after standing is typical of, but not
specific for, spondylolisthesis. There are often added spasms of acute pain,
especially if there is segmental instability.
The symptoms of spinal stenosis are often relieved by sitting bent slightly
forward, since the spinal canal dimensions increase in this position.
Sacroiliitis often causes referred pain to the buttocks and back of thighs. It
occurs commonly in SpA (see Chapter 8).
Sacroiliac pain can occur in multiparous women—the condition may be
associated with hypermobility.

Note the description of the pain
• Pain may be ‘severe’ whatever the cause; however, note whether the patient’s
descriptors of it suggest non-organic influences.
• Sharp, lancinating leg pains suggest nerve root irritation/compression
(radicular pain), whereas leg pain referred from other structures within a
lumbar segment is generally deep and aching. The distribution may be similar
(see earlier in section). More persistent, rather than episodic, radicular pain
may denote stenosis of the nerve root exit foramen.
• A description of bilateral buttock/leg pain that worsens on walking is

[SECTION]consistent with spinal stenosis, especially in those with normal peripheral
pulses and no bruits.
• A change in the description of pain in someone who has an established
diagnosis may be important, e.g. subacute, severe, unremitting localized pain
in a patient with axSpA who normally has mild inflammatory pain might
reflect a superadded discitis; or, acute severe unremitting sleep-disturbing pain
in an elderly woman with known chronic mechanical pain associated with OA
might suggest osteoporotic fracture.
• Florid descriptions of the pain and its severity are associated with
psychological modulators of pain.
Previous back pain and trauma, occupation, and family history
• Scheuermann’s disease (which is associated with irregular vertebral endplates)
causes spinal pain in adolescence. It is a risk for spinal degeneration and
kyphosis in adults. See p. 514.
• Previous trauma may have caused pars interarticularis fractures (an antecedent
of spondylolisthesis), vertebral fracture (risk of further mechanical damage),
or ligament rupture (subsequent segmental instability).
• It is generally accepted that the high prevalence of disc disease among manual
workers at a relatively young age provides some evidence for a causal
relationship.
• It is often the case that patients with chronic pain following (sometimes trivial)
trauma may be dissatisfied with the quality of care received at the time of the
injury. Be aware that many believe, and there is some evidence to support this,
that the way in which spinal pain is handled at its onset significantly
influences its subsequent course.
• Sacroiliitis is an early part of Brucella arthritis (20–51% of patients). Poor
animal- or carcass-handling hygiene or ingestion of infected foodstuffs/milk
can lead to infection. Spondylitis is a late feature and is characterized by
erosions, disc infection, and abscesses.
• A positive family history of low back pain might, in context, suggest SpA or
generalized OA.
Examination of an adult with low back pain
Inspect the undressed patient from the side and behind
• Note the fluidity of movement when the patient is undressing.
• Check the skin for redness, local swelling, and skin markings. Redness and
swelling occasionally accompany osteomyelitis.
• Lipoma, hairy patches, café-au-lait patches, or skin tags often reflect

[SECTION]underlying structural nerve or bone abnormality, e.g. spina bifida,
diastematomyelia, neurofibromatosis.
• Skinfolds often suggest an underlying significant structural change, such as
osteoporotic fracture or spondylolisthesis.
• Note any deformity: hyperlordosis (associated with L5/S1 damage and weak
abdominal musculature), prominent thoracolumbar kyphosis (multiple disc
degeneration or vertebral fractures), scoliosis (degenerative, compensatory
muscle spasm for unilateral pain).
• Look from the side. A gentle lordotic curve is normal. Flattening suggests
muscle spasm or fusion in SpA. With major spondylolisthesis, a step between
spinous processes can sometimes be seen.
Observe active movements while the patient is standing
Lumbar forward flexion (‘. . . with your legs straight, slowly reach down to try
and touch your ankles . . .’), lateral flexion (‘. . . with your legs and back
straight, tip sideways and run your hand down your leg towards your knee . . .’)
and extension (‘. . . with your legs straight, slowly bend backwards . . .’). Note:
flexion can be mediated by the hip joints; extension can be affected by slight
pelvic tilt and body sway. Ask what can be achieved normally and what is
painful:
• Abnormal movements are not specific for any condition though they may help
to localize a problem.
• Pain in extension is characteristic of retrolisthesis, facet joint arthritis, or
impinging spinous processes. May be relieved by flexion.
• Failure of the spinous processes to separate in a patient who manages good
forward flexion would be consistent with permanent spinal stiffness, e.g.
axSpA/AS, with flexion mediated by the hip joints.
• Forward flexion can be measured using the modified Schöber test. When erect,
mark the skin at the point midway between the posterior superior iliac spines
(Venus’ dimples) and again 10 cm above and 5 cm below. Measure the
increase in distance between the outer marks at full forward flexion—in a
young adult this is normally >6 cm.
• Ask the patient to stand on one foot then lift onto their toes a few times.
Weakness might imply an L5 nerve root entrapment (gastrocnemius/soleus).
Observe the gait pattern
Abnormality of gait may reflect any spinal or lower limb problem:
• An antalgic gait; a self-protective limp due to pain, typically characterized by
a short stance phase on the affected leg. The commonest cause is pathology at

[SECTION]•
•
•
•
•

the hip.
A wide-based gait suggests unsteadiness (due to dizziness, muscular weakness,
proprioceptive, or cerebellar deficit, etc.).
Leaning forwards/stiff legged—although not specific, in older people this may
denote spinal stenosis.
Shuffling, which could suggest parkinsonism (back pain/stiffness is a
recognized early sign).
Foot drop, which could suggest L5 or S1 nerve root compression.
Flat feet, hind feet valgus, and genu recurvatum on stance phase, might
suggest general hypermobility—associated with various low back lesions.

Check extension and lumbar rotation (patient seated)
With the patient seated on the couch, check lumbar extension and rotation (the
pelvis is now fixed):
• Typically, combined rotation and extension can elicit pain from arthritic facet
joints. It is a sensitive though not specific test.
• Slumping forwards (Fig. 3.11) stretches the dura. Increased lumbar pain may
be elicited in cases of disc prolapse, but more importantly, leg pain can be
elicited in cases of nerve root entrapment. A more provocative test can be done
by gently extending each knee in turn in the slump position. Look for
asymmetry.

Fig. 3.11 The (passive) slump test identifies pain from lumbar disc and nerve root irritation or compression.
‘Active’ leg extension can also trigger pain.

Examine the sacroiliac joints and hips (patient supine)
With the patient supine, examination of the sacroiliac joints and an examination

[SECTION]of the hips should be done to exclude pain arising from these structures:
• Test flexion and the rotational range of each hip by lifting the leg, flexed at the
knee, so that the upper leg is vertical. Passive movement should normally be
pain-free.
• No SI joint stress test is specific. Tests are designed to reproduce pain in cases
of SI joint dysfunction or sacroiliitis. Here are two:
• Press down/out reasonably firmly over both anterior superior iliac spines at
the same time.
• Lift one leg, flex, and abduct the hip slightly. Exert an axial force into the
acetabulum at two or three different angles. This test is considered by many
to be more useful and probably stresses both the joint and many of the sacral
ligaments, but is less specific if the hip joint is abnormal.
Testing nerve root tension
(Also see Chapter 21.) Use straight leg raise with the patient supine, Lasegue’s
test, and the slump test.
• The normal variation in straight leg raise ranges from 60° to more than 90° in
adults. Compare sides:
• Discomfort from normal tightening of the posterior thigh or calf muscles
must be discriminated from a positive test.
• A positive test (leg raising restricted to 40° or less by the radicular pain) is
most specific in patients aged <30 years and for L5 or S1 nerve root lesions.
• A crossed straight leg raise (pain elicited by raising the unaffected leg) is
even more specific for nerve root entrapment.
• Lasegue’s test is done by lifting the affected leg with knee fully flexed at first
then with the upper part of the leg vertical, slowly extending the patient’s leg
at the knee (passive examination).
• A positive Lasegue’s test is when pain is triggered in buttock or back as in the
straight leg raise.
• Slump test is particularly useful when the patient is unable to lie supine for a
straight leg raise or Lasegue’s test. With the patient sitting, and slumped (Fig.
3.11) and legs hanging free off the ground, gradually extend the lower leg and
ask if buttock or low back pain is triggered (a positive test).
• To identify more subtle cases of nerve root entrapment with all three tests,
apply additional foot dorsiflexion at the maximum possible extent of leg
raise/knee extension (pain-free).
Neurological examination
Neurological examination of the legs is essential in suspected cases of nerve root

[SECTION]entrapment, cord compression, spinal stenosis, and cauda equina syndrome.
Table 3.15 lists tests for muscle strength in the lower limbs—weakness may
denote nerve root entrapment—and Table 3.16 lists the principal signs of lumbar
nerve root lesions.
Examination of the prone patient
Ask the patient to turn to lie prone. Palpate low back and over sacrum:
• Diffuse tenderness may be due to muscle spasm.
• Superficial tenderness over the spinous processes or interspinous interval
might suggest interspinous ligament disruption or impinging processes.
• Paravertebral bony tenderness may suggest facet joint arthritis.
• Costovertebral angle/loin tenderness could indicate renal pathology.
• Tenderness over the SI joints is not specific for sacroiliitis.
• A positive femoral stretch test reproduces L1–L4 (especially L3) radicular pain
in the anterior or medial part of the thigh. Flex the patient’s knee to 90° and
passively extend the hip.
Other examination
• In suspected cases of spinal stenosis or cauda equina syndrome, it is essential
to check for sensory loss in the sacral nerve dermatomes. Also check anal
sphincter tone by rectal examination (S5).
• In suspected cases of spinal stenosis, the patient can be asked to walk until
limited by pain then re-examined. If there is any ischaemia of the cauda equina
or of a nerve root (from foramenal stenosis), nerve root signs may become
more obvious.
Investigation of low back pain in adults
(Also see Chapter 21.)
There are two important initial steps in investigating low back pain.
First deciding whether radiographs will help. Second, although relatively rare in
practice, the possibility of infection, malignancy, and cauda equina
compression always needs to be considered.
• Simple radiographic views are insensitive indicators of these conditions and,
in most cases, are not specific although most radiologists would agree they are
desirable in addition to CT or MRI. Laboratory tests are mandatory in all
suspected cases of inflammation, infection, and malignancy.

Radiographs: decision-making in requesting them
(See Table 3.17.)
• Lumbar spine radiographs are not always helpful. Remember that nine out of
ten cases of back pain in the primary care setting are mechanical and selflimiting. Features on a plain radiograph of the lumbar spine correlate poorly
with the presence or pattern of pain.
• Spondylosis is common, age-related, and often isn’t symptomatic.
• MRI best identifies a pars interarticularis fracture, any associated bone oedema
and spondylolisthesis seen in young people and athletes (see p. 620). CT
helps clarify the healing response (bridging of bone across the defect).
• Obtaining radiographs to help in the management of patients is a different
issue to obtaining them to aid diagnosis and one that requires careful thought,
e.g. is the patient likely to perceive that they have received suboptimal care if a
radiograph is not requested?
• Spondylolysis may be seen on a lateral view, but is seen better on oblique
view. Oblique views may also show pedicle stress fractures.
• Spondylolisthesis may be identified and graded by a lateral film.
• Flexion and extension views may be helpful in delineating subtle cases, and

[SECTION]instability (spondylolytic).
• General osteopenia is a risk factor for low bone mass; however, it is not a
sensitive indicator of low bone mass.

vertebra(e)
• Look for vertebral squaring (in AS), non-marginal syndesmophytes (in other
SpA, such as psoriatic—see Plate 13), or flowing syndesmophytes (in DISH
—at least three contiguous vertebral bodies).
• Consider obtaining an AP view of the pelvis. Established (but not early)
sacroiliitis can be ruled-out. A further ‘coned’ view is often helpful.
• Sacroiliitis (periarticular osteoporosis, erosion, sclerosis of bone, widening
joint space) occurs in all types of SpA. It can be unilateral.
• Sclerosis of the SI joint on the lower iliac side alone suggests osteitis
condensans ilii. Joint space is normal and joint margin well defined.
• Patterns of metabolic bone disease, Paget’s disease and hip pathology are
usually readily identifiable on a pelvic film.
Bone scintigraphy (see Plate 16)
• Bone scintigraphy is a sensitive test for infection or malignancy. It is a useful
investigation in patients with previously diagnosed malignancy who present
with back pain, especially in those who have had no previous skeletal
metastases. No additional lesions strongly suggests against a single spinal
abnormality being malignancy related.
• It is not specific for the various degenerative lesions, but can help localize the
site of a lesion.
• SI joint appearances can locate pathology but appearances may depend on
both previous pathology and/or current inflammation.
CT or MR?
The choice of imaging depends on local availability and likely differential
diagnosis, although MRI is preferred in young people:
• For spondylolytic spondylolisthesis, CT shows bone bridging and size of

[SECTION]•
•

•

•

•

defect whereas MRI shows bone stress of any recent fracture.
Nerve impingement can be shown by CT or MRI.
Intervertebral disc prolapse, both posterior and posterolateral, can be shown by
either technique. Prolapse material is of similar CT density and MR signal to
the disc, and well-defined against epidural fat.
Changes in the normal disc signal pattern are associated with age-related disc
degeneration. Discogenic pain has been associated with MRI abnormalities
classified according to Modic.
On T2-weighted MRI, disc material is usually of higher signal than ‘scar’ (e.g.
fibrosis from a previous lesion), in which signal decreases with ageing. Recent
scarring enhances immediately, but old scarring does so only slowly. This
discrimination requires gadolinium-enhanced MRI.
CT or MRI shows early sacroiliitis in axSpA when radiographs are normal
though MRI will show current inflammation better than ‘ever’ involvement of
SIJs—for which CT is better.
The shape and outline of the spinal canal are ideally shown on CT, but are also
seen with MRI. It is difficult for MRI to distinguish fibrous structures from
sclerotic or cortical bone, though it shows intrathecal content more readily
which is an advantage in identifying intradural tumours.
Spondylodiscitis (part of axSpA), if chronic, may be difficult to discriminate
from degenerative disc/vertebral end-plate disease. Fat-suppressed or
gadolinium-enhanced sequences may show high signal at the anterior disc
vertebral end-plate junctions.

Screening for infection, malignancy, or metabolic bone disease
• In cases where the history and examination suggest a mechanical condition,
but where the clinician wishes to be more confident of excluding an
inflammatory condition, ESR, and CRP are suggested.
• A raised ESR would point towards further laboratory investigation.
• An infection screen should include an FBC for anaemia and leucocytosis,
CRP, blood, and urine cultures. If spinal tuberculosis is suspected a plain CXR
should be taken and serial (over 3 days) early morning urine samples taken.
• Serum and urine protein electrophoresis (with immunofixation) are essential
tests in the ‘work-up’ for myeloma. Urea and creatinine are also important as
hypercalcaemia, and acute renal impairment have prognostic significance in
this condition.
• Routine blood tests may point to an underlying metabolic bone disorder such
as Paget’s disease or osteomalacia. These tests are normal in postmenopausal
osteoporosis.

[SECTION]• If osteoporosis is diagnosed (see Chapter 16) a screen for secondary causes
should include ESR (and if raised, serum, and urine protein electrophoresis),
calcium, phosphate, sex hormones, but also serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
parathyroid hormone (PTH), thyroid function tests (TFTs), and liver function
tests (LFTs).
Treatment of low back pain: adults
(See also Chapter 21 for greater detail)
• An important therapeutic intervention in the case of acute pain is to take the
patient seriously, take a positive view, and in the absence of sinister signs, e.g.
nerve root pain, urge early mobility.
• Analgesics and muscle relaxants can be used in the short term, initially
regularly, then as required.
• Physical therapy with graded-activity programmes may be of value, certainly
early in disc disease or spondylosis.
• Cord compression due to bone collapse from a tumour is an acute emergency
and should be discussed immediately with an oncologist or radiation
oncologist, and a spinal orthopaedic or neurosurgeon.
• Cases with disc prolapse failing to respond to conservative therapy, or cases
where there is ongoing or rapidly progressive neurological deficit, should be
referred for surgery.
• Available surgical techniques for acute or persistent disc disease include
decompression (e.g. nerve root decompression and partial facetectomy),
prosthetic intervertebral disc replacement, intradiscal thermocoagulation, and
intradiscal steroid injections, although evidence for long-term efficacy is
lacking for all these procedures.
• Surgery for spinal stenosis is useful for relieving leg neurogenic features, but
not indicated if there is no significant neurological compromise. Surgery is not
usually done if the only effect of spinal stenosis is back pain.
• In chronic back pain, aerobic exercises combined with behavioural methods
may be more effective than exercise alone and can help motivate the patient.
Methods may also incorporate psychological and social assessment and
management.
• The common treatments available for chronic back pain include:
• analgesics and muscle relaxants.
• antiepileptics/antidepressants for neuropathic pain.
• local anaesthetic/steroid injections.
• acupuncture.
• transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

[SECTION]• physical therapy. See p. 609
• ergonomic advice.
• multidisciplinary programmes—counselling, cognitive therapy, education,
relaxation, corsets and belts.
• Timely surgery for structural scoliosis can lessen spinal curvature.

Low back pain in children and adolescents
Synopsis
Children and young people present with a combination of back pain, deformity,
limp, systemic or neurological features. Many of the features of adolescents
overlap with young adults and the reader is referred to the assessment of adults
on pp. 140–152. See also Chapter 21, pp. 618–621.
• Back pain in children and adolescents is common (lifetime prevalence up to
80% by 20y) and, as in adults, most cases are non-specific, self-limiting and
do not present to the medical profession.
• Back pain is more common at times of rapid growth in girls and with high and
low levels of activity. It is especially common in young athletes.
• Times of rapid growth are also associated with: progression of idiopathic
scoliosis; other spinal deformities; and (if excessive) volume expansion of
vertebrae which confers the potential for a discrepancy between bone size and
bone mass (a reason for correcting DXA scan-derived BMD measures).
• The likelihood of finding underlying pathology (see Table 21.6, p. 618) is
low, but more likely at younger ages (especially <4y old).
• Low back pain in adolescence is a significant risk factor for back pain in
adulthood.
Taking a history of low back pain in children
• It is important to consider back pain in relation to age and development. Loss
of developmental milestones, refusal to walk, or irritability in a non-verbal
child, especially if <4y, warrants immediate investigation.
• Systemic features, intractable or night pain in children <6y require assessment
for infectious or neoplastic causes including TB in relevant populations.
• Back pain is more common at times of rapid growth in girls and with high and
low levels of activity. It is especially common in young athletes. (see also
Box 21.1).
• Trauma, especially sudden or repetitive twisting in adolescents may aggravate
or cause a pars defect leading to spondylolisthesis.
• Disability (including school absence) disproportionate to examination findings

[SECTION]may indicate pain amplification. Social history including stresses and sleep
pattern should be elicited.
• Incongruence of history and examination raises suspicion of non-accidental
injury.
• As in adults, differentiation between biomechanical and inflammatory clinical
features should be elicited.
Examination of back pain in adolescents
• Be opportunistic with a young child, observe play and review findings in
context of developmental stage.
• Focal bony tenderness identified by palpation or percussion should be assessed
further through radiological investigation.
• Examine gait (see pp. 37–39) and posture, for loss or exaggerated lordosis,
pelvic tilt (from leg length discrepancy), neck jut, and kyphosis.
• Scoliosis is rarely painful.
• Reduced hamstring flexibility (determined by popliteal angle) and tight hip
flexors (Thomas’s test) are commonly associated with back pain.
• New, unilateral or persistent toe-walking suggests spasticity, tethered cord, or
muscle weakness.
• Survey the skin for possible bruising, mid-line hairy patches, café-au-lait,
axillary freckling (neurofibromatosis). Soft tissue swelling may denote
extension of a spinal tumour.
• Neurological examination in 20% of children with bone or spinal cord tumours
will show motor weakness.
Investigations
• Investigations are the same as for adults see pp. 148–151.
• A general anaesthetic is commonly required for an MRI in young children.

Pelvic, groin, and thigh pain in adults
Anatomy
Anatomy of the pelvis and hip region
• The bony pelvis consists of two innominate bones (ilium above the
acetabulum and ischium below it) that articulate with each other at the anterior
symphysis pubis and posteriorly with the sacrum at the SI joints (SIJs).
• SIJs are initially synovial but become fibrous with age. A few degrees of
rotation can be demonstrated in children and young adults.
• Strong ligaments stabilize the posterior pelvis through sacroinominate, lumbo

[SECTION]•
•

•

•
•

(L5)–sacral, and lumbo (L5)–iliac attachments.
The symphysis pubis is a cartilaginous joint and normally does not move.
When standing, weight is transferred through the head of the femur. The
femoral head is stabilized in the acetabulum by the acetabular labrum and
strong pericapsular ligaments.
The ligamentum teres crosses the hip joint and carries blood vessels to the
head of the femur in children and young adults. In old age, blood supply is
largely via vessels that enter the femoral neck.
Two bursae are found at the insertion of the gluteus maximus: one separates it
from the greater trochanter, the other separates it from the vastus lateralis.
The ischial bursa separates gluteus maximus from the ischial tuberosity and
can become inflamed from overuse.

Anatomy of pelvic musculature
• Three groups of muscles move the hip joint: the gluteals, the flexor muscles,
and the adductor group.
• The major gluteal group muscles are:
• gluteus maximus (L5, S1/2): arises mainly from ilium and sacrum, projects
down posteriolaterally and inserts into the posterior femur and the lateral
tensor fasciae latae. It extends and externally rotates the hip (the hamstrings
also extend the hip).
• gluteus medius (L4/5, S1): lies deeper and more lateral. It inserts into the
lateral greater trochanter and abducts and internally rotates the hip.
• piriformis, obturator internus, and quadratus femoris arise deep in the pelvis
and insert into the posterior greater trochanter. All externally rotate the hip.
• The major hip flexor, psoas major (L2/3), is a massive muscle that arises from
the lateral part of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs (T12–L5) and lateral
processes of the lumbar vertebrae. It runs anteriorly over the iliac rim, across
the pelvis, under the inguinal ligament, and inserts into the lesser trochanter.
The iliacus (L2–L4) arises from the ‘inside’ of the iliac blade, passes under the
inguinal ligament medially to the lesser trochanter. Both flex, but the psoas
also internally rotates the hip.
• The psoas is enveloped in a fascial sheath. Retroperitoneal or spinal infections
that track along soft tissue planes sometimes involves the psoas sheath and can
cause inflammation in the psoas bursa, which separates the muscle from the
hip joint.
• All adductor muscles arise from the pubis or ischiopubic rami. The adductor
longus and gracilis are the most superficial; they arise from the pubis and
insert into the femoral shaft and pes anserinus (‘goose’s foot’) below the knee,

[SECTION]respectively. The adductor magnus (L4/5) is the largest of the deeper
adductors; it inserts into the medial femoral shaft.
• Adductors stabilize movement around the hip towards the end of the stance
phase of the gait. Body weight is transferred onto one leg during this action
and, therefore, adductors need to be strong, especially for running.
Functional anatomy of the hip
• With a flexed knee, the limit of hip flexion is about 135°.
• Hip extension (at 30°), internal rotation (at 30–35°), and external rotation (at
45–55°) is limited by strong, pericapsular ligaments.
• Abduction is limited to 45–50° by contact between the greater trochanter and
acetabular labrum rim. Adduction is limited to 20–30° with a fixed pelvis (see
Plate 15). These are adult ranges.
• Greater femoral neck anteversion (angle of the neck compared to the distal
femur) allows greater internal rotation of the hip (and reduced external
rotation). Tibial torsion can compensate but this and hip anteversion results in
a toe-in gait. Femoral neck retroversion (if the angle is posterior to the femoral
intercondylar plane) allows greater external rotation of the hip, usually
resulting in a toe-out gait.
• Normally infants have more anteversion than older children or adults (30–40°
at age 2 years compared with 8–15° at age >18 years).
Neuroanatomy
• The femoral nerve is formed from L2–L4 nerve roots and supplies mainly
muscles of the quadriceps group and some deeper hip adductors.
• With contributions from L4–S3 roots, nerves from the plexus converge at the
inferior border of the piriformis to form the sciatic nerve. This is at a foramen
formed by the ilium (above and lateral), sacrum (medial), sacrospinous
ligament (below), and sacrotuberous ligament (posteromedial).
• In about 10% of people the sciatic nerve divides before exiting the pelvis. In
some a branch exits above the piriformis muscle. Nerve entrapment and
trauma at this site may give rise to piriformis syndrome, and may benefit from
physical therapy.
Taking a history
Age
Age is a risk factor for some conditions:
• Unless there has been previous hip disease (e.g. osteonecrosis, synovitis),
trauma, or a long-standing biomechanical abnormality (e.g. epiphyseal

[SECTION]dysplasia) hip osteoarthritis (OA) is uncommon in adults <55 years old.
• Paget’s disease of bone is rare in adults <50 years old except in familial
disease.
Distribution and type of bone and soft tissue pain
• All mechanical lesions of the lumbar spine can result in referred pain around
the pelvis and thighs. It is often bilateral, localizes poorly, and is aching in
nature.
• Lateral pelvic pain is often referred from the lumbosacral spine. If pain
localizes (i.e. the patient points) to the greater trochanter, it may be due to
trochanteric bursitis, enthesitis, or meralgia paraesthetica (lateral femoral
cutaneous nerve syndrome, see Table 3.18).
• Hip joint pain is felt in the groin, but it can be located deep in the buttock
when ischial bursitis and sacroiliac pain should also be considered. It may be
referred distally to the anteromedial thigh and knee.
• Groin pain on weight-bearing suggests hip pathology such as synovitis,
osteonecrosis or OA, but it is not specific. Tendonitis of the adductor longus,
osteitis pubis, a femoral neck stress fracture, osteoid osteoma, or psoas bursitis
can give similar symptoms.
• Bone pathology typically gives unremitting pain. Sleep is often disturbed.
• Pain from deep MSK pelvic structures is typically poorly localized, although
can be severe. If the pain appears to be ‘catastrophic’ consider pelvic bone
disease (tumours, infection, Paget’s disease, osteomalacia, osteoporotic
fracture) (see Chapter 16) or an unstable pelvis (chronic osteitis pubis with
diastasis/laxity of the symphysis pubis and sacroiliac joints).
• Enthesitis of the anterior pelvis and osteitis pubis associated with SpAs (see
Chapter 8) are probably under-recognized.
• Aching in the back of the legs after standing is found with spondylolisthesis
(i.e. anterior displacement of a vertebra).
• Sacroiliac pain and stiffness radiates to the buttocks and posterior thighs.

Pain in a muscular distribution
• Diffuse pain in the buttocks and thighs occurs in PMR. It is often sudden or
subacute in onset, associated with stiffness, and may give similar symptoms to
those caused by sacroiliitis but invariably occurs for the first time in a much
older age group.

[SECTION]• Pain is not invariably present for all types of autoimmune myositis (see
Chapter 14). When it does occur, it is unlikely to be confined to pelvic
musculature or to be unilateral, but should be considered where acute or
subacute onset diffuse pelvic girdle/thigh pain accompanies weakness.
• Multiple entheseal lesions—particularly of structures at the greater trochanter
—can present with quite diffuse pain—interpreted by patients as ‘muscular’.
Quality and distribution of nerve pain
• Nerve root pain is often clearly defined and sharp. It may be burning in quality
and is often accompanied by numbness or paraesthesias. L5 or S1 lesions
generally cause pain below the knee, but can also cause posterior thigh pain.
L1–L3 root lesions can cause pain in the anteromedial thigh.
• Pain with paraesthesia on the anterolateral part of the thigh may be due to
entrapment of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh under the lateral part of
the inguinal ligament (i.e. meralgia paraesthetica). Symptoms may be referred
to this area with L2 or L3 nerve root lesions, since this is where the nerve
originates.
• Diabetics with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia are at risk of diabetic
amyotrophy. Acute unilateral or bilateral thigh pain with muscle wasting
occurs. It should not be misdiagnosed as PMR (in which weakness or wasting
do not occur) or inflammatory myopathy.
• Footballers are at risk of adductor tendonitis (often an adductor apophysitis)
and osteitis pubis owing to substantial mechanical forces placed on pelvic
structures during running and kicking.
• Although hip fractures are usually obvious, they can also present subacutely in
a patient who continues to walk; this is particularly common among the
elderly, who may develop stress fractures of the hip.
Previous trauma, low back, and MSK problems
• Previous trauma or disease causing permanent deformity of any lumbosacral
or hip joint structure can be considered a risk factor for asymmetry, poor core
stability and MSK pains (Table 3.19).
• Multiparity is a risk factor for osteitis pubis, sacroiliac, and pelvic pain,
particularly where there is hypermobility.
• Trochanteric pain syndrome owing to enthesitis, bursitis or insertional
tendonitis/tendon tear may coexist with referred back pain.
• Enthesitis of the gluteus medius can occur at its greater trochanter insertion
and give similar symptoms to those caused by bursitis.
• Historically, tailors were at risk of ischial bursitis because of sitting on the

[SECTION]floor continually crossing and uncrossing their legs, causing friction irritation
of soft tissues overlying the ischial tuberosity.

Examination of adults with hip and pelvic pain
The reader is referred to the sequence of examination for the low back, including
the sacroiliac and lower limb neurologic examination elsewhere in this chapter
(see ‘Examination of an adult with low back pain’, pp. 144–147). Always
consider lower spinal, muscle, or neurological pathology when assessing
weakness and pain around the pelvis.
Observation and palpation
For observation and palpation, the patient should be supine on a couch:
• Look for leg length discrepancy (hip disease, scoliosis) and a leg resting in
external rotation (hip fracture).
• Psoriasis may be associated with pelvic enthesitis/sacroiliitis.
• Swelling in the groin may be a hernia (reducible, moves with cough), lipoma
(soft/non-tender/diffuse), a saphenous varix, or lymphadenopathy
(hard/rubbery and invariably mobile). A hip joint effusion cannot be felt.
• Tenderness over the hip joint in the groin is not specific for joint pathology:
the joint is deep—muscles and psoas bursa overlie it.

[SECTION]• If the groin is very tender with slight touch, consider hip fracture or infection.
Hyperpathia (and allodynia) is consistent with CRPS (see Chapter 22).
• Numbness over the anterolateral thigh suggests meralgia paraesthetica (Fig.
3.12).
• The adductor longus tendon can be palpated at its insertion at the pubic
tubercle and distally along the upper medial thigh. The pubic tubercle is found
by palpating slowly and lightly downwards from umbilicus over the bladder
until bone is reached.
• Pain from osteitis pubis or adductor apophysitis is often significant, with
abdominal rectus contraction (ask the patient to slowly lift their head and
shoulders off the couch keeping your finger on the pubic tubercle).
Hip examination
The patient is supine. Tests generally help to discriminate articular and extraarticular disease, but not the causes of articular disease:
• Measure and determine actual or apparent leg length discrepancy: measure
from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial tibial malleolus; by flexing
hips and knees, the site of shortening should become apparent.
• A fixed loss of extension is a sign of intra-articular hip disease. The patient
flexes the hip and knee on one side until normal lumbar lordosis flattens out
(confirmed by feeling pressure on your hand placed under their lumbar spine
during the manoeuvre). If the other hip flexes simultaneously, it suggests hip
extension loss on that side (Thomas’ test).
• Using the patella or tibial tubercle as pointers, test the rotational hip range in
extension by rotating the straightened legs by holding the heels.
• Rotational movements are also tested by lifting the leg, flexed 90° at the knee,
and swinging the foot out (internal rotation) or in (external rotation). Hip
flexion can be tested in this position too (see Plate 15a). Patients without
intra-articular pathology should have a pain-free range of movement.
• Rotational ranges in hip flexion and extension may differ between left and
right in an individual. Also, variations in femoral neck anteversion contribute
to variations in rotation range.
• To test hip abduction/adduction, fix the pelvis to avoid pelvic tilt by placing
one hand firmly over the iliac crest (see Plate 15b). Occasionally, pain at the
end of abduction or internal rotation occurs with a bony block (solid ‘endfeel’). In an older patient this might suggest impingement of a marginal joint
osteophyte.
• Barlow’s manoeuvre checks for congenital dislocation of the hips in babies.
Flex and adduct the hips exerting an axial force into the posterior ‘acetabulum’

[SECTION]to demonstrate posterior dislocation.
• Greater retroversion (allowing excessive hip external rotation) usually occurs
in cases of slipped femoral epiphysis. External rotation is accentuated when
the hip is flexed. The slip (usually inferoposterior) is thought to occur in
association with a period of rapid growth.
Muscle activation tests
Specific muscle activation against resistance can be used to elicit pain, but
results need to be interpreted cautiously in the context of known hip disease:
• Hip adduction against resistance (sliding their leg inwards towards the other
against your hand) reproducing pain is a sensitive test for adductor longus
tendonitis, but may be positive in osteitis pubis, hip joint lesions, and other
soft tissue lesions in the adductor muscles.
• Test psoas by resisted hip flexion in slight internal rotation. Psoas bursitis or
infection tracking along the psoas sheath is likely to give intense pain with
minimal resistance.
• Hip abduction (sliding the leg outwards against your hand) may be particularly
painful in cases of gluteus medius tears, but also in trochanteric bursitis or
intra-articular pathology.
Palpate posterolateral structures
Ask the patient to lie on their side and palpate the posterolateral structures (Fig.
3.13):
• Tenderness over the greater trochanter is usually well-localized, although it
may be anterior or posterolateral to the trochanter and refers a small way down
the leg.
• The ischial tuberosity and its overlying bursa lie at the apex of the buttock.
• The soft tissues overlying the point where the sciatic nerve exits the pelvis is
found midway between the ischial spine and the greater trochanter. There may
be tenderness as a result of soft tissue lesions or trauma causing sciatic nerve
entrapment (piriformis syndrome), which can lead to foot drop.
• A tender coccyx (coccidynia) can be palpated in this position. It can also be
palpated (and the sacrococcygeal joint moved) from a bi-digital examination,
though this requires the index finger to be placed inside the rectum, the thumb
outside, the two digits then holding the joint.

[SECTION]Fig. 3.13 Bony anatomy of the posterior hip and pelvis, showing the position in which lesions around the
greater trochanter and ischial bursa can be palpated.

Investigation of an adult with hip and pelvis pain
Radiographs
An AP radiograph of the pelvis is a good initial screening test in patients with
pelvic, hip, or thigh pain. AP and lateral lumbar spine films may be warranted:
• The pelvis is a common site of involvement in myeloma, metastatic
malignancy, and Paget’s disease of bone (see Chapter 16).
• Established, but often not early, sacroiliitis can be ruled out. The main
differential diagnoses of the causes of sacroiliitis are AS, psoriatic or reactive
arthritis, enteric arthropathy, brucellosis and other infections,
hyperparathyroidism and osteitis condensans ilii (sclerosis of the SI joint on
the lower iliac side.)
• Widening of the symphysis in children may be a sign of congenital disorders
of development (e.g. epispadias, achondrogenesis, chondrodysplasias,
hypophosphatasia), trauma and hyperparathyroidism (see Chapter 16).
• Widening of the symphysis pubis, osteitis pubis (bone resorption and sclerosis)
and osteitis condensans ilii are signs associated with chronic pelvic pain in
multiparous women.
• General osteopenia is a risk factor for general low bone mass measured by
densitometry; however, it is not a sensitive or specific indicator of
osteoporosis (i.e. may be osteomalacia or rickets).
• Regional osteoporosis confined to the femur is non-specific: hip synovitis,

[SECTION]•
•

•
•

infection, or transient osteoporosis of the hip are possible.
Early synovitis and infection may be demonstrated through subtle radiological
signs such as joint space widening and change in soft tissue fat planes.
A ‘frog leg’ (lateral) view of the hip shows the anterior and posterior femoral
head more clearly than an AP view (useful in early osteonecrosis/Perthes’
disease, slipped epiphysis).
The acetabulae are best visualized on 45° oblique views (acetabular fractures
can be missed on a conventional AP view).
‘Stork’ views of the symphysis pubis (standing on one leg) are useful for
confirming diastasis of the joint.

Diagnostic ultrasound
US is a sensitive and simple way of confirming a hip joint effusion. Using US,
fluid can be aspirated for culture and an assessment of the extent of synovial
thickening can be made.
• Tendon damage in the groin area should be identifiable with US alone (guided
steroid injection can then be done if necessary) but MRI may be needed either
to characterize pathology further or rule out joint pathology.
Bone scintigraphy
Characteristic, though non-specific, patterns of bone scan abnormality are
recognized in the hip/pelvic area.
• The following conditions can be recognized: sacroiliitis, bone malignancy,
myeloma, Paget’s disease, hip fracture, femoral head osteonecrosis (see
Plate 17), osteoid osteoma, OA, bursitis/enthesitis at the greater trochanter and
synovitis of the hip.
• Visualizing osteitis pubis/adductor apophysitis requires special seated ‘ring’
view.
CT and MRI
• MRI of the high lumbar region should be considered to confirm a nerve root
lesion causing groin or thigh pain.
• Specific patterns of X-ray attenuation or signal change around the SIJs occur
in sacroiliitis with CT/MRI, although active and previous inflammation cannot
easily be distinguished unless both modalities of imaging are arranged.
• A suspicion of bony malignancy from radiographs of the pelvis requires
further characterization. CT is the technique of choice for characterizing bone
lesions around the hip, such as femoral neck stress fracture, osteoid osteoma,
or other bone tumours. CT may give more information about the lesion (and is
valuable for ‘guided biopsy’), but MRI is useful in checking for pelvic visceral

[SECTION]lesions.
• MRI is the technique of choice if hip infection or osteonecrosis is suspected. In
adults, patterns of signal change have been correlated with prognosis.
• During a single examination, the pattern of hip synovitis (vascularity and
thickness), cartilage loss, and subchondral bone erosion can be documented.
Laboratory investigations
• ESR and CRP may be normal in inflammatory SIJs, lumbar vertebral disc, and
pelvic enthesis disorders.
• PMR is invariably associated with an acute-phase response.
• Myeloma is unlikely if the ESR is normal.
• A high alkaline phosphatase is typically associated with an acute-phase
response, although in the elderly, it might suggest Paget’s disease.
• ANA and RF are unlikely to help diagnostically.
• Major metabolic bone disease, such as osteomalacia and hyperparathyroidism
is usually excluded by a normal serum calcium and phosphate.
Treatment of pelvic conditions in adults
Treatment of spinal and neuropathic pain is covered in the earlier section on
‘Low back pain in adults’, pp. 140–152 and in Chapter 21.
• NSAIDs may be required for a number of the conditions described earlier,
particularly OA, hip synovitis, and tendon inflammation.
• Physical therapy and rehabilitation play a vital and early part in management,
maintaining
mobility,
preventing
tissue
contracture,
and
restrengthening/stabilizing the lower back, pelvis, and hip.
• Either physical therapists or podiatrists may help in accurately evaluating back
and lower limb biomechanics. Asymmetry and muscular imbalance may be
modifiable relatively simply with foot orthotics, for example.
• Steroid injections may be important in the following conditions:
• meralgia paraesthetica.
• osteitis pubis.
• trochanteric bursitis/enthesitis.
• ischial bursitis/enthesitis.
• adductor tendonitis.
• coccidynia.
• hip synovitis (under imaging guidance).
• sacroiliitis—in intractable pain and under X-ray or US guidance.
• Injection techniques are covered in Chapter 24.
Surgery

[SECTION]• When the hip has been damaged by an inflammatory arthritis or OA the
principal surgical intervention is joint replacement. Osteotomy has been
mainly superseded by more reliable replacement.
• Surgical synovectomy of the hip is a difficult procedure and opening the hip
carries a risk of avascular necrosis. This procedure is very rarely done.
• Excision arthroplasty is only really necessary where infection or poor bone
stock make reconstruction unwise. Power is often greatly reduced and even the
previously fit young patient will not be able to ambulate without crutches.

Pelvic, groin, and thigh pain in children and
adolescents
General considerations
Hip and pelvic problems in young children usually present with a limp noticed
by a parent. In an older child or adolescent pain may be reported initially—in
groin, around buttocks or greater trochanter areas.
• The commonest causes of pelvic, hip and upper thigh conditions in children
are either due to developmental disorders, inflammatory lesions or
trauma/overuse (see Table 3.20).
• If stress fracture of the femoral neck is suspected in a teenage girl then
consider: amenorrhea, eating disorder and athletic over-training (‘female triad
syndrome’).

Examination
Examination begins with gait evaluation. Account for the developmental stage.
Examine squatting, single-leg hopping, lunging, zig-zag running and abdominal
curls/sit-ups (to disclose any symphyseal pain).
• Hip range of movement in children is similar to adults except the degree of
femoral anteversion is greater in toddlers (30–40° at 2 years) reducing to 8–
15° by 18 years of age.
• Reduced range of movement and irritability at end of range is typical of
intraarticular pathology. Joint pain radiates into the groin.
• Palpate for tenderness over ASISs, iliac crests, iliac tubercles, greater
trochanters, SIJ region and pubic tubercles with the patient standing and lying
on the side with hip flexed (when include posterior superior iliac spines too).
• Include joints above and below (lumbar spine, SIJ, knee) and try to reproduce
the hip pain through palpation and manipulation.
• Also, examine groin nodes and masses and abdomen.
Leg length discrepancy
Slight differences are normal and not associated with hip or knee restriction.
• Broadly, leg length discrepancy can be ascertained by assessment of pelvic tilt
and knee crease symmetry when standing.
• Evaluation is then done with the patient lying prone measuring from anterior

[SECTION]superior iliac spine to the medial malleolus and umbilicus to the medial
malleolus. The latter may need to account for pelvic tilt, muscle contracture or
spasm.
• Unless leg length discrepancy is idiopathic, the shorter leg is usually the
abnormal one and usually due to either shortening of soft tissues, growth plate
trauma, Perthes disease, SUFE, tumours, or infection and secondary
degenerative changes.
• Radiographic evaluation assesses skeletal, joint and epiphyseal causes of leg
length discrepancy.
Specific examination tests
Some tests in children and adolescents are similar to those in adults though
should be considered a guide to further tests/investigations as none are highly
specific for pathology (Table 3.21).

Knee pain in adults
Anatomy of the knee
• The knee extends, flexes, and rotates.
• The main extensor quadriceps consists of four muscle segments—rectus
femoris, vastus lateralis, medialis, and intermedius, which converge to form a
tendon containing the patella that then inserts into the tibia. Rectus femoris
arises from the pelvis and vastus muscles from the upper femur.
• The hamstring muscles (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semi-membranosus)
all arise from the ischial tuberosity and flex the knee. The biceps femoris
inserts around the fibular head. The other two muscles insert into the tibia on
the medial side and can externally rotate the femur.
• In the knee, the femoral condyles articulate within semicircular fibrocartilage
menisci on the tibial condyles (Fig. 3.14). Only the peripheral 10–30% of the
menisci is vascular and innervated and can potentially repair itself.
• As the knee approaches full extension, the femur internally rotates on the tibia
(biceps femoris action) tightening each pair of ligaments relative to each other.
This configuration confers maximum stability.
• As flexion is initiated, a small amount of femoral external rotation on the tibia
occurs. This ‘unlocking’ is done by the popliteus—a muscle that arises from
the posterior surface of the tibia below. It passes up obliquely across the back
of the knee and inserts, via a cord-like tendon, into the lateral femoral condyle.
The tendon partly lies within the knee joint capsule.
• Grooves on the femoral condyle articular surfaces allow tight congruity with
the anterior horns of the menisci when the knee is extended. If full extension—
and this optimal articulation configuration—is lost, then articular cartilage
degeneration invariably follows. This is particularly important in inflammatory
arthritis.
• The cruciate ligaments are the principal joint stabilizers. The anterior cruciate

[SECTION]•

•
•
•

•

attaches above to the inside of the lateral femoral condyle and below to the
tibia in front of the tibial spines though a slip attaches to the anterior horn of
the lateral meniscus. Its main role is to control and contain the amount of knee
rotation when the joint is flexed.
The posterior cruciate attaches above to the inside of the medial femoral
condyle. At the other end, it attaches in a (posterior) groove between tibial
condyles. Its main role is to stabilize the joint by preventing forward
displacement of the femur relative to the tibia when the knee is flexed.
The cruciates are extra-articular and are covered by a layer of vascular
synovium. Bleeding usually accompanies disruption.
The tibial or medial collateral ligament (MCL) has superficial and deep layers
(Fig. 3.15). It stabilizes the knee against valgus stresses, mostly during flexion.
The superficial MCL overlies, and moves relative to, the deep part and is
separated from it by a bursa. The lower part of the superficial MCL is covered
by the long adductors, gracilis, semitendinosus, and sartorius muscles, as they
merge into the pes anserinus before inserting into the tibia.
The MCL and pes anserinus are separated by the anserine bursa. Deeper MCL
fibres attach to, and stabilize, the medial meniscus.

Fig. 3.14 Axial section of the right knee joint (looking down on the tibial plateau, where the foot is fixed on
the floor). The femoral condyles articulate within the menisci. As the knee extends the cruciate ligaments
tighten and pull the femoral condyles acting to internally rotate the femur through the last few degrees of
extension. The knee therefore ‘locks’ and is stable when the leg is straight.

[SECTION]Fig. 3.15 Anterior knee structures.

• The fibular or lateral collateral ligament (LCL) joins the lateral femoral
condyle to the fibular head and is separated from it by a bursa. It stabilizes the
knee on its lateral side. It has no meniscal attachment. A small bursa separates
it from the overlapping tendon insertion of biceps femoris.
• The patella is a seamed bone that articulates in the femoral condylar groove
and makes quadriceps action more efficient. Patella articular facet
configuration can vary; congenital bi/tripartite patellae are associated with
anterior knee pain.
• The strongest force on the patella is from vastus lateralis (Fig. 3.16).
Mechanical factors that increase the ratio of lateral to medial forces during
patella tracking such as a wide pelvis, a more lateral origin of vastus lateralis,
femoral neck anteversion, external tibial torsion, and a weak vastus medialis
are risk factors for patella tracking problems and anterior knee pain.
• There are bursae between the quadriceps tendon and the femur (suprapatellar),
the patellar tendon and tibial tubercle (deep infrapatellar), and overlying the
patella (prepatellar) and patellar tendon insertion (superficial infrapatellar).
The suprapatellar bursa communicates with the knee joint and large joint
effusions invariably fill it.
• Posteriorly, bursae separate each of the heads of gastrocnemius (which arise
from femoral condyles) from the joint capsule. The bursae communicate with
the knee joint and can fill from joint effusions.

Taking a history of knee pain: adults
Ask about the site of pain
Try to establish whether pain is from articular, soft tissue, or anterior knee
structures. Is it referred pain?
• Bursa, tendon, and most ligament lesions cause well-localized pain.
• Localized tibiofemoral joint line pain suggests meniscal pathology.
• Localized medial knee pain has a number of possible causes: MCL tear or
chronic inflammation (calcification of MCL origin termed the Pellegrini–
Stieda phenomenon), medial meniscus tear, meniscal cyst, anserine tendonitis,
bursitis, or enthesitis (semimembranosus insertion).
• Enthesitis of structures at their insertion to the patella margins can result in
considerable pain.
• Overuse in runners and cyclists can cause localized inflammation and pain of
the iliotibial band (ITB) or its underlying bursa over the lateral femoral
condyle (as the band moves across the bone as the knee flexes).

[SECTION]• Anterior pain in adults invariably suggests an underlying mechanical
abnormality. In older adults, the most common cause is patellofemoral OA
(Table 3.22).
• Anterior knee pain may be referred from the hip or L3 nerve root. Hip pain is
an aching pain; nerve root pain is sharp often with paraesthesia.
• Posterior knee pain associated with ‘a lump’ is often due to synovitis in the
posterior knee compartment with popliteal cyst formation (Baker’s cyst).

Ask about injury

[SECTION]Knee injuries are common; the most significant is anterior cruciate injury. Ask
about injury and if the knee feels unstable or ‘gives way’:
• Anterior cruciate injuries are invariably associated with a haemarthrosis, thus a
painful effusion will have occurred immediately. Meniscus tears can cause
immediate pain, but synovitis and swelling are delayed for about 6 hours.
• Patients may volunteer that the knee ‘keeps giving out on me’. This feeling
may be the pivot shift phenomenon caused by reduced anterior cruciate
stability against a valgus stress as the knee is flexing.
• Anterior cruciate and MCL injuries often coexist (since they are attached). Ask
about medial knee pain originally and subsequently.
Ask about knee locking
Knee locking is a mechanical effect of disruption of normal articulation by
‘loose bodies’:
• Suspect meniscus damage in the middle aged or if the patient plays sports. A
meniscus tear is the most common cause of the knee locking. In adolescents,
locking may be due to a tear in a discoid meniscus (>98% lateral).
Morphologically abnormal discs are prone to degeneration.
• Synovial chondromatosis is a rare cause.
• Some patients with anterior knee pain describe the knee locking or giving way.
This is due to reflex quadriceps inhibition rather than true instability.
Ask about the initial onset of pain
• Acute pain is usual with injuries of cruciates and vertical meniscal tears.
• Acute onset pain without trauma (but always with swelling) suggests infection,
crystal arthritis, or spontaneous haemarthrosis.
• In the very elderly, traumatic lesions may be missed, since the presentation is
not always striking, e.g. intra-articular fracture with haemarthrosis.
• An insidious onset of pain is usual in cleavage tears of menisci (horizontal
tears), which occur typically in adults where the disc is degenerate, in
adolescents with discoid menisci, and in early osteochondritis dissecans.
Ask about the pattern and type of pain
• Pain from synovitis is often associated with stiffness and is often worse after a
period of immobility. Almost without exception knee synovitis can occur in all
forms of arthritis.
• Pain from subchondral damage (e.g. OA) is almost always worse on weightbearing, but this association is not specific.
• Pain on kneeling/squatting is characteristic of anterior knee pain.
• Burning pain may be neurogenic, e.g. L3 nerve root or osteodystrophy pain or

[SECTION]if focal may be enthesitic.
Past medical, family, occupational, and leisure history
• Knee synovitis and patellar enthesitis occur in all forms of SpA. Ask about
previous uveitis, low back pain, urethral discharge, sexually transmitted
disease, IBD-type symptoms, and psoriasis.
• Gout (see Chapter 7) is not uncommon around the knee. Ask about gout risk
factors and whether the patient has ever had acute first MTPJ pain.
• There may be a family history of OA, an hereditary disease of connective
tissue, or hypermobility in young adults with OA.
• Prepatellar bursitis classically occurred in housemaids, hence the nickname
‘housemaid’s knee’. Friction caused by repeated kneeling can cause it.
• Sports injuries are common. Anterior cruciate injury occurs characteristically
in skiing. Meniscal injuries are common in soccer. Jumping events (e.g. high
jump, basketball) can lead to patellar tendon apophysitis. Cycling is associated
with anterior knee pain. MCL and meniscal injuries are common in skiing and
weight-bearing activities where rotation and change of direction are frequent.
Cycling and running are associated with ITB/bursa pain and inflammation.
Examination of an adult with knee pain
From front and behind, observe the patient standing
• Look for mechanical abnormalities that might be associated with knee lesions:
patella asymmetry, prominent tibial tubercles from previous Osgood–Schlatter
disease (anterior knee pain), flat feet, and hypermobility (patella dislocation,
hyperextension of >10°).
• Check for mechanical abnormalities which might suggest specific pathology:
genu varum (bowed leg, typical appearance with primarily medial
compartment OA), obvious suprapatellar knee swelling (synovitis), psoriasis
(associated synovitis or enthesitis), and genu valgum (knock-kneed).

[SECTION]Examination of the sitting patient
Ask the patient to sit on the examination table with legs hanging, knees bent.
Patellar tracking and pain from medial meniscus damage can be assessed. An
alternative approach is with the patient supine. Observe any muscle wasting.
Palpate anterior, medial, and lateral structures:
• In patients with anterior knee pain, look for symmetric patellar alignment.
• Observe active knee extension. Patellar movement should be smooth, pain
free, and symmetric.
• Passively externally rotate each lower leg to its extreme. This is a reasonably
sensitive test for conditions of the medial knee compartment (e.g. meniscus
tear) and medial knee structures. Discomfort will be felt. If the MCL is totally
deficient, an abnormally increased range of external rotation may occur.
• Quadriceps wasting (accentuated depression in muscle just above the patella)
occurs with disuse after injuries and chronic arthritis.
• Sites of bursae, patellar tendon, and ligament insertions should be palpated in
patients with localized pain (Fig. 3.17).
• Tibiofemoral joint line tenderness is likely to be due to either meniscus
pathology or marginal osteophytes. Osteophytes give bony swelling.
• Anterior pain from patellofemoral joint disorders may be elicited by gentle
pressure down on the patella. Mobilizing the patella sideways will give an
impression of tissue laxity (possible underlying hypermobility).
• Factors that predispose to patellofemoral pain syndrome include: high or
lateral patella, weak vastus medialis, excessive pronation, weak ankle
dorsiflexors, tight hamstrings, reduced movement at the ankle, and a wide Qangle. The Q-angle is formed between a line from the anterior superior iliac
spine to the centre of the patella, and a line extended upwards from the tibial
tubercle through the centre of the patella. The larger the angle the greater the
lateral tensile pull on the patella (Fig. 3.17).
• Localized tenderness of the femoral condyle is often the only sign of
osteochondritis dissecans in adolescents. The most common site is on the
inside of the medial femoral condyle (75%).
Examine for joint synovitis (synovial inflammation giving synovial thickening
and/or tenderness) and an effusion
• The joint may be warm. Chronic synovitis doesn’t always result in a warm
joint, but infection, acute crystal arthritis, and haemarthrosis usually do.
• Gross synovitis can produce obvious effusions and/or synovial thickening
most easily felt around the patellar edges.

[SECTION]• Effusions may be confirmed by the patellar tap test (see Plate 18).
• Small effusions can be detected by eliciting the ‘bulge sign’. Fluid in the
medial compartment is swept firmly upward and laterally into the suprapatellar
pouch. Firm pressure on the lateral side of the joint may then push fluid back
into the medial compartment, producing a bulge.
• Thickened synovium can be detected by experienced examiners in the absence
of a detectable effusion. It is not always tender.
• Posterior compartment synovial thickening and popliteal cysts can be felt by
wrapping the fingers around under the knee when it is slightly flexed.
• In contrast to adults, popliteal cysts in children are not usually associated with
intra-articular pathology. Investigation is not always necessary.

[SECTION]Fig. 3.17 Position of the knee for palpation of most of its structures. Palpating for enthesitis at the patellar
tendon insertion. (a) Palpation over the insertion of semimembranosus and pes anserinus under the tibial
plateau (b) The site of the majority of osteochondritis lesions in the knee is shown by the ‘X’.

Test the knee for stability
There are many tests for instability: instability may be straight or rotational and
can be graded according to consensus criteria (consult orthopaedics texts).
• The Lachmann test (Fig. 3.18) is arguably the most sensitive test for eliciting
anterior cruciate disruption: hold the knee flexed between 20–30°, grasped
above and below the joint. Attempt to move the tibia forwards and backwards
on the femur. Ask about pain and feel for laxity or a ‘clunk’.
• The anterior draw test is not as sensitive as the Lachmann test for detecting
partial anterior cruciate tears, but is easier to do. The patient lies flat, hip
flexed, the knee flexed at 90°, with the foot flat on the table. Fix the foot by
gently sitting on it and pull the top of the lower leg forwards in the line of the
thigh. Ask about pain and feel for laxity.
• The posterior draw test identifies posterior cruciate disruption: with the knee
flexed to 90°, press the top of the lower leg backwards in the line of the thigh,
ask about pain and feel for laxity.
• Test medial stability at 0° and 30° of flexion (MCL stabilizes maximally at
30°) by holding the upper leg still and applying a valgus force to the tibia.
Laxity associated with widening of the tibiofemoral joint (with or without
pain) is a positive test and suggests MCL deficiency.
• Lateral (LCL and ITB) stability is similarly tested, though using a varus force
on the lower leg.
• MCL tears can accompany anterior cruciate injuries and deep lesions are
associated with simultaneous tears of the medial meniscus. Such complex
pathology can make specific examination manoeuvers difficult to interpret.
Test for meniscus damage
• McMurray test (Fig. 3.19). Flex the knee, internally rotate the lower leg, then
extend the joint. Repeat with the lower leg externally rotated. The fingers
(over the joint line) may feel a ‘clunk’ as a femoral condyle passes over a torn
meniscus. It is often positive (21–65% of cases) when surgery subsequently
reveals no tear.
• Ask the patient to turn over. When prone, look and palpate for swelling in the
popliteal fossa and proximal calf that may indicate a low lying popliteal cyst.
• Inflammation of the bursa underlying the ITB may result in tenderness over
the lateral femoral condyle. The ITB may be tight. This is demonstrated using
the Ober test. With the patient lying on their side and affected leg uppermost,

[SECTION]the leg is abducted and knee flexed to 90°. Holding the hip joint in neutral
with slight extension and external rotation, the leg is released. Failure of the
knee to adduct/fall is a positive test—leg length inequality and foot overpronation may be causative factors.
• Detecting specific structures in the posterior fossa is often difficult because of
the lack of bony landmarks and overlapping soft tissue structures. Synovial
cysts may form under pressure and are often hard and tender. Diffuse
thickening suggests joint synovitis.
Relevant proximal MSK examination
As always examine the immediate proximal structures at the end of the
examination sequence—here examine the hip and gait.
• Gait examination—consider the lower limb as functionally inter-related from
lower spine to toes.
• Hip examination can help determine ante/retroversion at the hip—and the
configuration of such can have a bearing on lower leg pronation, in-toeing and
pains at both knee and in feet (see Fig. 3.20).

Fig. 3.18 Dynamic tests of anterior cruciate function. Patients should be relaxed lying supine on a couch.
Excessive laxity is the most important sign.

[SECTION]Fig. 3.19 Dynamic test designed to elicit signs of meniscus damage. ‘Clunks’, intra-articular pain, and
coarse crepitus may indicate damage. The test is not specific and is open to misinterpretation.

[SECTION]Fig. 3.20 Femoral anteversion, retroversion, and tibial torsion. (a) Where the femoral neck angulates
excessively forward relative to an imaginary axis through the femoral condyles, the hip is anteverted. (b)
Femoral neck anteversion can lead to a greater than usual range of hip internal rotation and a toe-in gait. (c)
and (d) Retroversion, where the femoral neck angulates posteriorly relative to a femoral condyle axis, can
cause a toe-out gait. (e) In-toeing can also be caused by excessive medial tibial torsion. Normally the ankle
mortise faces 15° externally relative to a sagittal plane axis through the tibial tubercle (arrow) but in medial
torsion it faces forward or internally.

Investigations of adults with knee pain
Radiographs
AP and lateral weight-bearing radiographs are suitable screening views if the
diagnosis is unclear after clinical assessment:
• Early synovitis may only be evident from the presence of an effusion,
periarticular osteopenia, or soft tissue swelling. Patterns of bone damage in
chronic arthropathies may be recognized.
• Signs of joint infection, which may not necessarily present acutely, are patchy
bone osteolysis and irregular loss of bone cortex.
• Osteonecrosis is uncommon in the knee although it is seen in femoral condylar
bone, often without symptoms, in sickle cell anaemia.
• Loss of joint space, angulation deformity, osteophytes, subchondral bone
sclerosis, and bone cysts are hallmark features of OA.
• Linear or vague intra-articular calcification suggests chondrocalcinosis
(associated with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) arthritis).
• Gross ‘thumbprint’ calcification is typical of synovial chondromatosis.
Specialized radiographic views: tomographic views; ‘skyline’ (axial with knee
bent) view; or lateral view taken with at least 30° of flexion
• Tomography is useful for clarifying non-peripheral osteochondral defects.
• Skyline views demonstrate anomalous patellar facet configuration and can
reveal patellofemoral incongruity though multiple views may be needed.
Subchondral patellar pathology is seen more clearly than on lateral views.
• Patella alta is most reliably seen on a lateral view with 30° flexion.
Further imaging
Further imaging depends on differential diagnosis and a discussion with your
radiologist:
• Periarticular soft tissue lesions can be characterized with MRI, although with
superficial lesions adequate information needed for further management may
be obtainable with US alone.
• Patterns of meniscus damage are recognized on MRI, give an indication of
prognosis, and aid the surgeon’s decision to proceed to arthroscopy.

[SECTION]• MRI is essential if there is likely to be a combination of lesions, e.g. anterior
cruciate, MCL, and medial meniscus lesions.
• In anterior knee compartment symptoms alone, US is a reasonable first option
for imaging because inflammatory lesions can be injected with glucocorticoid
if needed using imaging guidance.
• MRI is more sensitive than radiographs or US at identifying joint erosions in
RA (‘pre-erosions’).
• The place of CT or MRI in investigating radiographically detected bone
tumours depends on the nature of the lesion.
Aspiration of joint and periarticular fluid collections
• Early aspiration is essential if infection is suspected (see Plate 19).
• The knee is a common site of monoarthritis forms of systemic diseases (e.g.
PsA, CPPD disease).
• Send joint fluid for cell count, polarized light microscopy, and culture.
• In adults, the usual differential diagnosis of sepsis of knee structures is gout,
so fluid should be examined by polarized light microscopy for urate crystals.
• Blood-stained fluid either suggests a traumatic tap or chondrocalcinosis. Frank
blood suggests haemarthrosis, the major causes of which are cruciate tear,
bleeding diathesis, intra-articular fracture, and PVNS.
• Bursa fluid may be more successfully detected and aspirated using US
guidance.
Laboratory investigations
These should be directed towards suspected underlying disease:
• FBC, acute-phase measures (ESR, CRP).
• Blood urea, electrolytes, creatinine, and urate.
• Blood calcium, phosphate, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, 25-OH vitamin D,
and PTH to screen for metabolic bone disease.
• Autoantibodies: rheumatoid factor (RF), ACPA, antinuclear (ANA), and
extractable nuclear antibodies (ENAs) to characterize an autoimmune process
where synovitis is chronic.
• Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) for sarcoidosis.
• IgM Borrelia burgdorferi serology for acute arthropathy in Lyme disease,
streptococcal antibodies for reactive streptococcal arthritis and parvovirus
serology.
Treatment of adults with knee pain conditions
• In general, most soft tissue lesions will settle with rest and NSAIDs.
• Anterior knee pain may respond well to isometric exercises, adjustments to

[SECTION]•
•

•
•

foot alignment, e.g. with sensible shoes, orthotics (support insoles), and
hamstring stretching exercises.
The acute swollen knee requires aspiration, rest for 24 hours and gentle
mobilization.
If infection is considered, broad-spectrum antibiotics against staphylococcal
and streptococcal agents should be started immediately while awaiting culture
data. In infection, intra-articular antibiotics and steroids should be avoided.
The patient should not bear weight on an acutely infected joint (see Chapter
17).
Acute and chronic inflammation can lead to joint destruction and instability
this is relevant for RA—early treatment may prevent long-term morbidity.
Physical therapy and splinting play an important role in maintaining function
and preventing contractures, etc.

Address biomechanical factors
Input from a physical therapist may be helpful in cases of anterior knee pain.
Success from McConnell (patellar) taping is more likely in non- patellofemoral
OA-related anterior knee pain.
• Quadriceps strengthening exercises can be reviewed and reinforced by
physical therapists in cases of knee OA.
• Knee pain, particularly anterior pain, may be linked to foot abnormalities (e.g.
over-pronation), and hip alignment (Q-angle, above).
• Specific muscle strengthening exercises, foot orthotics, and knee braces should
be considered.
Local steroid injection
Chapter 24 has more detail on local steroid injections.
Local steroid injections can be helpful in the following situations:
• Acute flare of non-infective inflammatory disease:
• OA (especially when in inflammatory phase)—mild OA may also respond to
hyaluronan injections.
• autoimmune arthritis, e.g. RA.
• intra-articular gout or CPPD/pseudogout.
• SpA or more likely PsA effusion/monoarthritis.
• Bursitis (may be gout):
• pre- and infrapatella (superficial and deep) bursa (the latter may require US
guidance).
• anserine.
• Baker’s cyst (note: the knee joint is injected at the site of the pathology

[SECTION]•
•
•
•

•

•

assuming there is intra-articular communication between joint and cyst. Direct
popliteal cyst injection should be under US guidance only to avoid damage to
vascular and nerve tissues).
Enthesitis, e.g. semimembranosus insertion.
Trauma, e.g. pain over MCL insertion.
Other soft tissue: ITB syndrome.
In patients with large joint effusions, merely aspirating the effusion may
provide some level of symptomatic relief—this procedure may need to be
done alone initially without steroid injection pending results from fluid
microscopy and culture.
Knee OA may respond transiently to an injectable steroid, such as
methylprednisolone. Saline irrigation and injections with hyaluronan
preparations are also used, but response is variable.
Note: all intra-articular injection therapies are more effective when patient’s
knee is immobilized for 24 hours following the procedure.

Drugs
• NSAIDs will invariably be helpful in cases of inflammatory and septic
arthritis.
• Colchicine 0.5 mg two to three times daily for 5 days is often useful in
relieving pain from crystal arthritis in patients intolerant of NSAIDs.
• Paracetamol/acetaminophen may be as effective as NSAIDs for some patients.
• The effect of glucosamine and chondroitin for OA is debated. Although some
studies demonstrate improved pain control and function, other studies indicate
that these are no better than placebo.
Surgery
• Arthroscopy is often used as a diagnostic tool in cases of undiagnosed
monoarthritis and to confirm and trim cartilage tears. Synovium and synovial
lesions (e.g. PVNS, synovial chondromatosis) can be biopsied or excised
(synovectomy) and the joint can be irrigated.
• In appropriate cases, joint replacement can be remarkably successful and is an
important option to consider in OA and inflammatory arthritis, where pain is
severe and present at rest, and when mobility is substantially restricted.
• Unicondylar osteotomy can aid realignment of the tibiofemoral joint, e.g. in
metabolic bone disease, such as Paget’s disease.
Other
• In OA, capsaicin cream applied three or four times daily to painful superficial
structures, e.g. patellar margins or marginal tibiofemoral joint pain, can ease

[SECTION]symptoms. Response is cumulative and may not occur for 6–8 weeks.
• Yttrium-90 radiation synovectomy has a long history of use for isolated knee
synovitis occurring as a result of a number of conditions. Y-90 injection can be
arranged to follow arthroscopic synovectomy aiming to maximize the effect of
both procedures.
• Topical lidocaine patches may also be useful for control of pain limited to one
joint.

Knee pain and lower limb development in
children and adolescents
General considerations
In younger children, especially, knee, foot, and ankle problems need assessment
in light of developmental stage and with reference to any developmental
abnormalities.
History
• Growing pains are common and occur typically in children <6 years. There is
a nighttime predominance, hence the term ‘benign nocturnal pain of
childhood’. Knee is often identified as a key site but also thigh, shins, and feet.
• Osteochondroses of knee structures are common in the growing skeleton (see
Table 16.11).
• Osteochondritis can affect the articular cartilage (e.g. medial/proximal tibia
(Blount’s)) or an enthesis or an epiphyseal plate.
• The osteochondritis lesion becomes more severe if the cartilage becomes
separated as a fragment (‘dissecans’ lesion).
• Cause of osteochondritis at an enthesis is assumed to be traction-trauma in
aetiology though the number of children with these lesions, who might have
ERA, PsA, or JSpA is not known.
• Anterior knee pain at all ages is relatively common (the term ‘chondromalacia
patella’ is a surgical finding which may or may not be associated with pain).
• The commonest cause of anterior knee pain in adolescents—termed
patellofemoral syndrome (PFS)—is attributable to abnormal loading of the
patellofemoral joint and patella mal-tracking. There is often underlying
biomechanical imbalance including muscle tightness and vastus medialis
obliqus (VMO) weakness.
• Anterior knee pain can be secondary to patella instability. This is a variable
lesion which ranges from mild dynamic imbalance with lateral patellar

[SECTION]•

•

compression to recurrent patella dislocation and chronic dislocation.
Other causes of anterior knee pain in active children includes patella ligament
origin or insertional enthesitis (in ERA, JSpA or JPsA), local bursitis or fat pad
syndrome.
Impingement of the infrapatellar fat pad—which is richly innervated—
between patella and femoral condyle is amplified by mal-tracking of the
patella, knee extension, prolonged standing and kneeling.
The knee is a common presenting site for inflammatory disease particularly in
IBD-related arthritis and JPsA.
A swollen knee can be a presenting sign of JIA, PVNS, tuberculous/septic
arthritis, and haemarthrosis (trauma).
Pain is the main presenting features of tumours, which can occur around the
knee (e.g. osteoid osteoma, chondroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, leukaemia,
neuroblastoma).
Mechanical symptoms on movement (catching, knee giving way, painful
clunks, etc.) may occur with patellofemoral instability or with an internal
structural lesion—such as cruciate ligament deficiency or synovial plica.
Synovial plicae are embryonic remnants, with a septated structure, which
become tender and inflamed when trapped between patella and medial femoral
condyle. Snapping and catching during flexion differentiate it from other
biomechanical lesions.
Finally ask about hip/groin pains given referred pain from the hip joint may be
present and can denote Perthes disease or SUFE.

Examination
A general overview of relative MSK stiffness, hypermobility, functional
movement ability, and muscle tone is helpful before a regional examination takes
place.
• Functional biomechanics are assessed by evaluation of gait, and manoeuvres
such as jumping, hopping, and squatting. This is followed by assessment of
muscle group strength and stretch.
• Assess for the ‘J’ sign of patellar tracking. This is medial shift of the patella in
early flexion as it enters the trochlea, suggestive of VMO weakness or tight
lateral patella retinaculum.
• Fixed loss of extension or loss of full flexion is indicative of intraarticular
pathology.
• A joint effusion is shown by sweep (or bulge) sign (see earlier).
• Other tests include patellar compression (Clarke test), Lachman test; anterior
and posterior draw tests; McMurray and Trendelenburg tests—see ‘Knee

[SECTION]pain in adults’, pp. 170–183.
Lower limb developmental factors and variations
Developmental factors
• Developmental characteristics often imply that different age groups are prone
to a different spectrum of conditions.
• Due to ligamentous laxity, when babies begin to walk, the midfoot is flat to the
floor. A longitudinal arch usually develops by 5 years.
• During growth, tendon insertions (apophyses) are often weaker than the
tendons themselves. Traction strain on tendons can lead to apophysitis
(osteochondritis). This is a common pattern of injury in the foot in active older
children.
Femoral anteversion
• This causes internal femoral torsion leading to a medially rotated patella and
in-toeing.
• See Fig. 3.20.
• Femoral anteversion is present at birth in 40% but decreases with age and
disappears by 10 years of age.
• Mild persistence with in-toeing does not usually result in functional disability.
• It may persist with patterns of sitting such as the ‘W’ position. Sitting crossed
legged may encourage external rotation at the hips instead.
Internal tibial torsion
• This results in in-toeing and is normal in toddlers, resolving at 2–4 years.
• See Fig. 3.20.
• Thigh-foot axis angle of more than about −10° confirms the diagnosis,
although treatment is only considered when greater than −45°.
• By contrast, external tibial torsion is a common cause of an out-toe gait and
may lead to PFS.
• Osteotomy may be recommended for a thigh-foot axis angle of more than
+40°.
Genu varum (bow legs)
• Bow legs are normal in toddlers and normal beyond 4 years if mild and
symmetrical.
• Bow legs appear more pronounced in an overweight child and associated intoeing may give appearance of a clumsy gait, but does not require intervention.
• Asymmetric or exaggerated bowing and reports of pain requires a full MSK
assessment including metrology (of intercondylar distance and lateral thrust at

[SECTION]•
•
•

•

the knee) and gait assessment.
Radiographs may disclose Blount’s disease (osteochondritis of the medial
aspect of the proximal tibial physis).
Bowing can occur in rickets (check vitamin D levels).
A full leg AP radiograph assesses hip, knee, and ankle contribution and
measures joint-to-diaphysis angles to identify which physis is contributing to
the deformity.
MRI, CT, and DXA are rarely useful.

Genu valgum (knock knees)
• Knock knees is physiological between 2 and 6 years of age and does not
progress after 7 years. Intervention with braces or orthoses is unwarranted and
meddlesome.
• Adolescent idiopathic genu valgum may be associated with circumducted gait,
anterior knee pain and patellofemoral instability. Often hereditary, it may
progress into adulthood to premature OA of the patellofemoral joint and lateral
compartment of the knee.
• An angle of 12° of valgus or intermalleolar distance of >8 cm should prompt
orthopaedic assessment for adolescent genu valgum.
• Other causes of genu valgum include local pathology from trauma or infection
(usually unilateral), skeletal dysplasias, neurofibromatosis and vitamin Dresistant rickets.
• Genu valgum is best assessed using a full-length standing AP radiograph. The
mechanical axis or centre of gravity (drawn from the centre of the femoral
head to the centre of the ankle) should bisect the knee and lie within the
intercondylar central area of the knee.

Lower leg and foot disorders in adults
Anatomy
Anatomy of bones and joints
• The leg absorbs six times the body weight during weight-bearing. Strong
ligaments secure the ankle (formed by tibia above/medially and fibular
malleolus laterally) and talocalcaneal (subtalar) joints and bones of the
midfoot (Fig. 3.21).
• Anomalous ossicles in the foot are common. Some are associated with specific
pathology. There are many potential sites, though the sesamoids in flexor
hallucis brevis (FHB) are invariable.

[SECTION]• The foot is an optimal mechanical device to support body weight when
walking or running over flat, inclined and uneven types of terrain. The
configuration of bones at synovial articulations allows dorsal flexion (foot
pulled up), plantar flexion (to walk on toes), inversion (foot tips in), eversion
(foot tips out) and small degrees of adduction and abduction. Midfoot
movements allow pronation and supination.
• The normal ankle joint range is about 25° of dorsal flexion and 50° of plantar
flexion from neutral (foot 90° to leg). The range of subtalar inversion–eversion
is normally 10–15°.
Anatomy of the long muscles and tendons
• In the lower leg, a strong fascia connects the tibia and fibula. Lower leg
muscles primarily move the foot. They are separated into compartments by
fascia and are prone to pressure effects.
• The foot dorsal flexors—tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus (EDL),
extensor hallucis longus (EHL), and peroneus tertius—lie adjacent to the
anteromedial side of the tibia. Their tendons pass in front of the ankle in
synovial sheaths held down by strong retinaculae (Fig. 3.22). The tibialis
anterior, the bulkiest flexor, inserts into the medial midfoot (medial
cuneiform).
• In the posterior lower leg, the gastrocnemius (and plantaris), which arise from
the femur, plantar flexes the foot by pulling the back of the calcaneum. The
soleus, which arises in the lower leg, merges with them in the Achilles tendon.
This tendon has a deep and superficial bursa at its insertion site.
• Plantar flexion is assisted weakly by long muscles, which arise in the lower
leg, pass behind the medial malleolus in synovial sheaths (Fig. 3.22), and
insert into the sole. They mostly invert the foot. Tibialis posterior, the bulkiest
plantar flexor, inserts into the plantar surface of the navicular.
• The peroneus longus and brevis arise from the fibular side of the leg and pass
around the lateral malleolus in a common synovial sheath held by a
retinaculum. Longus passes into the sole and inserts into the medial cuneiform.
Brevis inserts into the fifth metatarsal base. Both evert the foot.
• The tibial nerve and artery follow the course of the medial tendons under the
flexor retinaculum (Fig. 3.22).

[SECTION]Fig. 3.21 The bones of the foot.

Anatomy of intrinsic foot structure
• Intrinsic foot structures have been greatly modified during evolution to
combine provision of a flexible platform for support and a rigid lever for
thrusting body weight forward when walking.
• In the sole of the foot, muscles are aligned longitudinally in four layers. The
deepest layers include phalangeal interossei in the forefeet, tibialis posterior,
peroneus longus, adductor hallucis, and FHB, which has two insertions into
the proximal great toe phalanx, each containing a sesamoid.
• The superficial layers include flexor digitorum longus (FDL), which inserts
into the lateral four distal phalanges, the phalangeal lumbricals, flexor
digitorum brevis, and abductor hallucis. The latter two muscles arise from the
plantar surface of the calcaneum deep to the plantar fascia.
• Flexor tendons merge with the deeper part of the plantar fascia, a swath of
tissue that extends from os calcis to the metatarsal area.

[SECTION]• Longitudinal muscles, ligaments, and fascia contribute to stabilize the foot
with a longitudinal arch—its apex at the talus, but also with some effect
laterally. The foot arches transversely—its apex at medial cuneiform level.
Neuroanatomy
• The sciatic nerve splits into tibial and common peroneal nerves above the
knee. The common peroneal is prone to pressure neuropathy as it runs
superficially around the fibular head. The nerve then divides. A deep branch
runs distally with EDL under the extensor retinaculum to the foot. It supplies
tibialis anterior, EHL and EDL. A superficial branch supplies the peroneal
muscles and most of the skin over the dorsum of the foot.
• The tibial nerve runs in the posterior lower leg compartment supplying
gastrocnemius and soleus. It then passes under the medial flexor retinaculum
dividing into medial and lateral plantar nerves, which supply the intrinsic
plantar muscles of the foot and skin of the sole.
Functional anatomy
• In a normal gait pattern, the foot is dorsiflexed and invertors/evertors stabilize
the hindfoot for heel strike. As weight is transferred forward, the foot plantar
flexes and pronates, the great toe extends (optimally between 65° and 75°),
and push off occurs through the medial side of the forefoot.
• All metatarsals bear weight and can suffer weight-bearing injury.
• Ligamentous attachments around the hindfoot are strong. A fall on a pronated
inverted foot without direct trauma can result in a fracture of the distal fibula.
This is probably a consequence of the relative strength of the talofibular
ligaments compared with bone.
Conditions of the lower leg
• Patients with lower leg conditions present with pain or deformity.
• Pains in the calf may be due to local soft tissue or muscle conditions, and are
commonly due to referred lumbosacral pain. These pains are often described
by patients as ‘cramps’—suggesting a muscle problem at first. A detailed
history may suggest nerve root pathology.
• Imbalance of muscles in the foot can lead to increased tension at tendon and
fascial insertions in the calf and shin, resulting in ‘shin splints’. Shin splints
usually present after activity and are relieved by rest. Conditions to consider
include:
• stress fractures of the tibia or fibula.
• tibialis posterior fasciitis—often with a flat, pronated foot.
• compartment syndrome (soft tissue and vascular swelling).

[SECTION]• popliteal artery stenosis.
• referred nerve pain (spinal claudication).
• peripheral vascular disease (intermittent claudication).

Fig. 3.22 Tendons, retinaculae, and bursae of the hindfoot.

Taking a history from an adult with lower leg or foot pain
Ask about site and quality of pain in the lower leg
• Localized anterior pain occurs in bony lesions of the anterior tibia, e.g. stress
fractures, periostitis.
• Burning pain suggests a neurogenic cause. Diffuse burning pain may be
caused by peripheral neuropathy, CRPS (see
Chapter 22), or (rarely)
erythromelalgia.
• Most commonly occurring in the elderly, bilateral leg pain with ‘heaviness’ or
‘stiffness’ limiting walking distance is typical of spinal stenosis. An alternative
would be vascular claudication where often pain is more overt, and critical
ischaemia can give night pain eased by hanging the legs over the side of the

[SECTION]bed (gravity effects).
• Simultaneous knee problems may be relevant. Escape of synovial fluid from
the knee into the soft tissues of the calf can present with acute pain and
swelling and be misdiagnosed as a deep vein thrombosis
(pseudothrombophlebitis). Often a history of preceding joint effusion can be
elicited.
• Low-lying synovial cysts connecting with the knee can cause calf pain (with or
without swelling). This invariably occurs only with chronic synovitis.
Establish possible causes of hindfoot pain
(See Table 3.23.)
• Establishing the cause of hindfoot pain from the history alone is difficult.
There are important clues, mainly from patterns of injury or overuse.
• Posterior heel pain has a few causes. Often clinically indistinguishable from
Achilles tendonitis or retrocalcaneal bursitis, enthesitis is usually associated
with axSpA (see
Chapter 8). An os trigonum may become damaged
especially in soccer players and ballerinas (see later in section).
• The origin of plantar heel pain is varied. Mechanical plantar fasciitis is thought
to occur more frequently in people who are on their feet for long periods of
time, those who are obese, have thin heel fat pads, or poor footwear.
Symptoms of arthritis and enthesopathy elsewhere, low back pain (sacroiliitis),
eye inflammation (iritis), psoriasis, or previous gut or ‘urethral’ infection,
might suggest SpA.
• Less common causes of plantar heel pain include fracture through a calcaneal
spur and lateral plantar nerve entrapment between the fascia of abductor
hallucis and quadratus plantae muscles (causing pain/paraesthesias on the
lateral side of the sole).
• In the elderly and postmenopausal women, calcaneal stress fractures are a
recognized feature of osteoporosis and can present with heel pain.
• Ankle and talocalcaneal synovitis, OA, ankle osteochondritis dissecans, and
tendonitis around the hindfoot may be difficult to distinguish from the history
alone. Synovitis or an effusion often accompanies OA of these joints.
Establish possible causes of midfoot and first MTPJ pain
• Gout (see Chapter 6), OA (see Chapter 6), enthesitis, and referred L5
nerve root pain are the most likely diagnoses of midfoot and first MTPJ pain.
• Gout should always be considered a possible cause of painful lesions in the
foot in people at risk. Gout is not always intra-articular, intra-bursal or intratendon. Local or diffuse soft tissue inflammation is common and often

[SECTION]misdiagnosed as cellulitis.
• The first toe and midfoot are common sites for PsA; check radiograph for
typical PsA periosteal new bone formation.
• L5 pain is referred to the dorsum and S1 pain to the sole, of the foot.
• In older adults OA of midfoot joints is common. Mild synovitis can occur with
it and may be caused by CPPD disease (see Chapter 7).

Establish possible causes of forefoot pain
• In those with forefoot pain, typically referred to as metatarsalgia, establish
whether the condition is focal or due to arthropathy.
• Pain under the ball of the foot while walking is non-specific but might suggest
any MTPJ abnormality, distal metatarsal stress fracture, Freiberg’s disease,
plantar nerve neuroma, or bursitis.

[SECTION]• Patients with RA often describe pain under the MTPJs and a feeling of
‘walking on pebbles’ (due to joint swelling and/or subluxation). Synovitis of
the MTP joints is a common feature of early RA.
• Acute pain under the forefoot spreading into one or more (adjacent) toes and
worse on walking suggests a plantar nerve neuroma (Morton’s metatarsalgia)
or intermetatarsal bursitis.
• Pain associated with paraesthesias or numbness under the forefoot might be
due to S1 root irritation (common) or entrapment of the tibial nerve in the
hindfoot (rare). Ask about back pain and other hindfoot problems.
• Non-traumatic toe pain associated with swelling of the entire toe suggests a
dactylitis (associated with axSpA). Although many toes may be affected,
dactylitis may be unilateral and affect just one toe.
• The development of hallux valgus is associated with tight footwear. The
deformity is associated with altered weight-bearing and a second toe (hammer)
deformity.
• Big toe pain might be due to hallux rigidus. It is usually due to OA and
important to recognize as it may prevent toe dorsiflexion sufficiently to lead to
a compromised gait pattern.
• Pain specifically under the hallux may be due to damage to the sesamoids in
the flexor hallucis brevis tendon and be misdiagnosed as a joint problem.
Ask for a description of the pain
• As in the hand, neurogenic pain is common and typical.
• Severe or unremitting pain when at rest suggests intrinsic bone pathology.
Consider osteonecrosis, infection, fracture, and tumours, e.g. osteoid osteoma.
• Neurogenic pain may be sharp and well defined (e.g. in acute L5 or S1 root
pain), deep, achy, and less well defined (e.g. chronic nerve root symptoms as
in spinal or foramenal stenosis), or burning in quality. Paraesthesias and
numbness may accompany both.
• If swelling accompanies neurogenic pain, consider a complex regional pain
syndrome. There are numerous triggers, e.g. trauma and surgery. Patients may
be unwilling to walk and apparent disability may appear profound.
Weakness
If true weakness is the major problem rather than pain, the diagnosis is usually
between a myopathic process, but more likely is a spinal or peripheral nerve
lesion (see ‘Examination’, p. 194).
Examination of an adult with lower leg or foot pain

[SECTION]Observation
Observe the lower legs and feet from front and back, while the patient is
standing. Note any swelling, deformities, or rashes:
• Lower leg deformities to note: tibia varum (or bow legs) in an older adult may
be due to Paget’s disease of the tibia. Muscle wasting might suggest disuse
atrophy, old polio, or spinal stenosis (bilateral and subtle usually in older
adults).
• Oedema or soft tissue swelling may be relevant to an underlying condition
causing ankle synovitis. Although it may cause discomfort, oedema from
cardiac failure, venous congestion, hypoproteinaemia, or lymphoedema is not
painful unless there are ulcers or thrombophlebitis.
• Gout can cause swelling anywhere; gouty tenosynovitis can mimic the
appearance of a cellulitis in the region of a joint.
• Calf swelling may be due to vein thrombosis or ruptured popliteal cyst.
Common patterns of foot deformity are: flat feet (pes planus), high-arched feet
(pes cavus) with high medial arch, hallux valgus and rigidus, over-riding toes,
hammer toes, or claw toes.
• Skin conditions from venous abnormalities are common in the elderly. Other
skin lesions which may be relevant include purpura, panniculitis—which is
often subtle and over the shins—and pyoderma gangrenosum.
Ask the patient to walk in bare feet
Gait patterns should be noted:
• An antalgic (‘limp/wince’) gait is a non-specific indicator of pain.
• A wide-based gait (>10 cm wider than normal) suggests instability: joint
instability, muscle weakness, or neurological lesions may be the cause.
• A foot that slaps down or a high stepping gait suggests tibialis anterior
weakness (L4 nerve root or common peroneal nerve lesion).
• Significant weakness of gluteus medius and gluteus maximus in L5 and S1
root lesions, respectively, can result in lurching during gait. In the former, as
weight is taken on the affected side, gluteus medius may be weak in
controlling the small 2–3 cm lateral displacement in the weight-bearing hip
that normally occurs. This can be compensated for if the body centre of gravity
is brought over the hip by lurching the upper body over the affected side. With
gluteus maximus lesions (S1) extension of the hip, which helps mediate
motion through the stance phase prior to toeing-off, may be weak. Thrusting
the thorax forward with an arched back (forward lurch) compensates for the
weakness and helps to maintain hip extension.
• A flat-footed gait with little or weak toe-off may suggest an S1 root lesion;

[SECTION]however, ‘flat-foot’ (loss of the medial arch) with associated hind foot eversion
and heel pain (plantar fasciitis) is extremely common. Often the arch weakness
corrects when the patient is asked to walk.
Examine the lower leg
With the patient supine on the couch, examine the lower leg:
• After a ruptured popliteal (Baker’s) cyst, calf tissues are often diffusely tender
and swollen. Calf circumferences can be compared (e.g. 10 cm below tibial
tubercle). There may also be mild skin erythema. Findings are not specific.
Gout and infection are the main alternatives if there is marked tenderness.
• Check for bruising, swelling, and tenderness around the fibula head in patients
with foot drop (possible peroneal nerve palsy). Neurological examination may
be done at this point.
• Localized anterior tibial tenderness is often found in patients with stress
fractures or with pseudo-fractures.
• Tibial deformity in adults may be associated with diffuse bony tenderness and
heat (arteriovenous shunting) in Paget’s disease.
Examine the ankle and hindfoot
At the ankle and hindfoot, examine for joint and tendon synovitis, palpate
specific structures and test passive hindfoot joint mobility:
• Synovitis of hindfoot joints is not always easily detected. With ankle joint
synovitis, thickened tissue may be felt anteriorly in the ankle crease (where
there may be a ‘springy fullness’) or laterally around the malleoli.
• Posterior tibial and peroneal tendonitis are associated with soft tissue swelling
of the medial and lateral hindfoot, respectively. Synovial thickening from
ankle and talocalcaneal joints may also be felt here and synovitis of structures
may coexist in RA or SpA. Pain from resisted movement of tendons may not
be specific.
• Pathology of medial hindfoot structures may be associated with tibial nerve
entrapment resulting in sensory symptoms on the sole of the foot. There may
be a positive Tinel’s sign.
• Posterior heel pain may be due to Achilles tendonitis, enthesitis and
mechanical damage to the tendon, and retrocalcaneal bursitis. Deep tenderness
may suggest an os trigonum lesion.
• The loss of passive hindfoot movements is not specific and can be associated
with any cause of ankle or subtalar arthritis (20–30° of dorsiflexion and 45–
55° of plantar flexion is average for the ankle and a 10–20° inversion–eversion
range is average for the subtalar joint). Subtalar joint movement can be

[SECTION]difficult to test accurately.
• The pain of plantar fasciitis may be elicited by firm palpation of the medial
underside of the calcaneum. A negative test does not rule out pathology, as
often the history is more sensitive. Full MSK examination is required to check
for features of SpA, such as arthritis/enthesitis elsewhere and sacroiliitis.
Examine for midfoot lesions
Identifying specific midfoot lesions is difficult, though bony landmarks and
discrete tender areas can be noted:
• Twisting the midfoot may elicit pain but locating the source in the midfoot
may be difficult. Common lesions include PsA, OA, gout, and enthesitis or
synovitis from SpA or RA respectively.
• Bony tenderness alone without soft tissue swelling does not rule out synovitis
of an adjacent joint.
• The midfoot is a typical site for neuroarthropathy in diabetes.
• Bony exostoses that may have formed at sites of pressure are common in the
foot (e.g. medial or dorsal aspect of the first MTPJ, base or head of the fifth
metatarsal, distal talus, or over the midfoot).
• Both gout and infection result in swelling, skin erythema and local tenderness.
Gout of the first MTPJ occurs at any one time in 70% of patients with the
condition. It can occur anywhere in the foot.
Examine the forefoot
Check for bony or other swelling, digit separation, and examine the sole of the
foot. Squeezing the whole forefoot at the line of the MTPJs is a non-specific, but
useful screening test for painful forefoot lesions:
• Tender swelling of the whole toe (dactylitis) occurs in SpA, sarcoidosis (see
Chapter 8), and HIV infection. Swelling is soft not bony. Tender bony swelling
suggests a bunion and is common on the dorsal aspect of the toes and the first
and fifth MTPJs.
• Forefoot splaying and interdigital separation suggests MTP synovitis or
interdigital bursitis. MTPJs may be individually tender (simultaneously
palpated with thumb below and finger above).
• Tenderness between metatarsal heads is typical in Morton’s metatarsalgia.
There may be a sensory deficit in the interdigital cleft. The differential
diagnosis (in adolescents) may be osteochondritis of the second and third
metatarsal head.
• Check for hallux rigidus. Passive hallux dorsiflexion should be >50°.
Extending the hallux can reveal an ability to form a medial longitudinal arch in

[SECTION]•
•
•

•

patients with flat feet (Jack’s test).
Discrete bony tenderness without swelling occurs with stress fractures.
Uneven callus distribution under the forefoot may suggest an abnormally
focused area of weight-bearing and an underlying mechanical abnormality.
Rashes on the sole of the foot are uncommon but important to consider are
pompholyx, pustular psoriasis, and keratoderma blennorrhagica (‘reactive
arthritis’, see Chapter 8).
Loss of sensation under the forefoot may be due to an S1 root lesion,
peripheral neuropathy (e.g. diabetes), mononeuritis (e.g. vasculitis; see
Chapter 15), Sjögren’s syndrome (see Chapter 12), other AICTDs or, rarely,
tibial nerve entrapment (examine hindfoot).

Neurological examination
Neurological examination of the feet is essential in cases where pain is
neurogenic and likely to be referred or nerve root in origin or there is weakness,
numbness, or paraesthesias (Table 3.24).
Relevant proximal MSK examination
As always examine proximally—here, the knee.
• Gait examination is important—consider the lower limb as functionally interrelated from lower spine to toes.
• Hip examination can help determine ante/retroversion at the hip—and the
configuration of such can have a bearing on lower leg pronation, in-toeing and
pains at both knee and in feet (see Fig. 3.20).
Investigations of an adult with lower leg or foot pain
Imaging of the lower leg
• Suspected tibial abnormalities such as stress fractures and pseudofractures in
osteomalacia and Paget’s disease have characteristic radiological appearances.
• Periosteal changes occur in trauma, psoriatic arthritis (above ankle), HPOA,
and pachydermal periostitis.
• In athletes with exercise-related pain, three-phase bone scintigraphy is part of
the work-up for anterior shin pain.
• In suspected (but radiograph-negative) cases of bony disease, such as cortical
stress fracture, periostitis, or cortical hyperostosis, bone scintigraphy may be
useful to identify subtle pathology.
• MRI is needed in suspected cases of myopathy though imaging may b done
more usefully of the upper leg.

Imaging of the foot
Information available on radiographs of the hindfoot includes:
• Increased soft tissue attenuation around the tendon insertion in cases of
Achilles tendonitis or retrocalcaneal bursitis.
• Erosions or periostitis at the Achilles tendon insertion in enthesitis associated
with SpA.
• Erosions in gout and RA-associated retrocalcaneal bursitis.
• Axial radiographs of the hindfoot are useful in showing talocalcaneal joint
abnormalities, e.g. in RA.
• If radiographs are normal in patients with posterior heel pain, US can show
patterns of tendon and bursal inflammation. MRI can further characterize any
discrete pattern of tendon injury.
• Osteonecrosis of an os trigonum or posterior talar process or tarsal navicular

may be identified by radiographs. It is invariably located by bone scintigraphy
and can be characterized further, usually with soft tissue swelling, by MRI.
A plantar spur may denote recurrent plantar fasciitis.
Plantar heel pain may be due to a fracture in a spur. Erosions just above the
spur may be seen. The thickness of heel fat pad can be gauged from its X-ray
attenuation (thin = risk for plantar fasciitis). A fat pad >23 mm thick in men
and >21.5 mm thick in women is associated with acromegaly.
Calcaneal fractures or an osteoid osteoma can be seen in some cases with
radiographs alone. Bone scintigraphy/CT are more sensitive.
Patterns of joint, enthesis, and tendon inflammation can be documented using
MRI or bone scintigraphy. This is useful information when characterizing an
arthropathy.
Bony abnormalities in the mid and forefoot are generally revealed by
radiographs alone, though metatarsal stress fractures may be missed. MRI can
discriminate a plantar neuroma from interdigital bursitis and MTPJ synovitis.
The former are probably best initially demonstrated by US.

Other investigations
• Neurophysiology (NCS) is a useful adjunct to clinical examination in
diagnosis of lower limb neuropathies, and can help discriminate between
peripheral (common peroneal or sciatic) or nerve root causes of foot drop, and
also S1 root or tibial nerve entrapment causes of paraesthesias of the sole of
the foot.
• Joint/bursa fluid aspiration is mandatory in suspected cases of sepsis and
should be sent for culture (remember to consider gonococcus in young adults
and TB in patients from endemic or inner-city areas). Fluid should be sent for
polarized microscopy if a crystal-induced disease is suspected.
• Laboratory tests requested should reflect suspicion of specific infective,
inflammatory, metabolic, or malignant pathology.
Treatment of lower leg and foot conditions: adults
Lower leg disorders
• Anterior shin pain should be treated according to cause. If there is also a
problem of foot alignment, then orthoses that support both the hind foot and
mid arch may be very useful. Patients may volunteer that good walking shoes
or ‘trainers’ (‘sneakers’) help (as is the case with plantar fasciitis).
• Exercise-induced lower leg pain has a number of causes and includes shin
splints and compartment syndrome. The latter may require further
investigation with pressure readings or exercise scintigraphy (99mTc-MIBI). In

[SECTION]cases resistant to rest, analgesia, and modification of triggering factors,
decompressive surgery may be required.
• Patients with Paget’s disease of the tibia may require treatment with IV
zoledronate and will need a biomechanical assessment.
Ankle and hindfoot disorders
• Tendonitis around the ankle should respond to treatment of its underlying
cause. Chronic posterior tibial tendonitis left untreated will eventually
accelerate the development of hindfoot valgus. Consider heel and arch support
orthotics early.
• Steroid injection of inflamed ankle, subtalar and (both posterior tibial and
peroneal) tendons can be done easily (though with subtalar injection, image
guidance is advisable). See Chapter 24.
• Plantar fasciitis may respond to a number of measures:
• Hind and midfoot orthotics and/or supportive shoes.
• NSAIDs.
• Modification of weight-bearing activity.
• Achilles tendon stretching.
• Hindfoot strapping.
• Resting night splint (preventing ankle plantar flexion).
• Steroid injection around the medial calcaneal tubercle.
• surgery.
• Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs/immunosuppressants (e.g.
sulfasalazine or methotrexate) if part of PsA or SpA.
• External beam radiotherapy.
Forefoot disorders
• Localized forefoot pain (e.g. metatarsalgia) may respond to support pads and a
change to a wider, more supportive, low-heel shoe. A podiatry/chiropody
opinion should be sought as required.
• Forefoot stress fractures and metatarsal head osteochondritis require rest,
supportive footwear and time to heal.
• Patients with chronic forefoot pain may benefit from a podiatric assessment.
‘Stress offloading’ foot orthoses for metatarsalgia and other biomechanical
abnormalities (e.g. hallux rigidus) can be individually moulded using
thermoplastic materials.
Steroid injections
Steroid injections may be of value in the following:
• Ankle joint inflammation (e.g. RA, PSA, OA, acute CPPD and gout) (see

[SECTION]•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•

Plate 20a).
Subtalar joint inflammation (imaging guidance needed).
Tarsal tunnel syndrome.
Achilles peritendinitis (steroid injections for Achilles nodules should be
avoided as the risk of rupture is high. The same concern, though probably
lesser risk, applies to Achilles peritendinitis).
Calcaneal apophysitis (Sever’s disease—Achilles tendon insertion).
Retrocalcaneal bursitis.
Plantar fasciitis.
Gout/OA/enthesitis at first MTPJ.
Initial treatment of a Morton’s neuroma.

Surgery
• Minor surgical techniques can be curative in tarsal tunnel syndrome and in
excising an interdigital (Morton’s) neuroma.
• Consider excision of painful exostoses and troublesome rheumatoid nodules
and amputation of deformed or over-riding toes.
• Major surgical procedures with good outcomes in appropriate patients include
fusion of hindfoot joints and forefoot arthroplasty in chronic inflammatory
arthritides.
• Osteotomy realignment of a hallux valgus deformity can be successful in the
long term.

Lower leg and foot disorders in children and
adolescents
General considerations
Foot and ankle problems are common in children and adolescents and most are
attributable to minor trauma or repetitive stress. Concerns can arise from overinterpretation of common developmental variation or congenital anomalies (see
Table 2.1) and failure of conditioning or rehabilitation after acute injury.
Taking a history in children and adolescents
• Overuse and acute trauma is common: tendinopathy, stress fractures,
osteochondritis and apophysitis. Taking an accurate history of trauma is
important.
• If stress fracture is suspected (e.g. second, third, or fifth metatarsals or
navicular or calcaneal) in a teenage girl then amenorrhea, eating disorder and
overtraining (in an athlete) needs to be considered (‘female triad syndrome’).

[SECTION]• A history of initial trauma then chronic symptomology is recognized with
some lesions—particularly lateral tibiofibular ligament injury, ‘turf-toe’ and
tarso-metatarsal joint injury.
• Pes cavus or planus, tarsal coalitions (stiffness and sometimes pain in the hindmid foot), and metatarsus adductus presenting in young children are primarily
developmental/congenital in origin. Symptoms may have been present since
the child started walking though not always and a history of discomfort may
have evolved over a long period of time.
• Pain under the heel or a reluctance to heel strike can disclose plantar fasciitis
(e.g. traction apophysitis).
• Tendonitis may not be an isolated lesion. For example, posterior tibial
tendonitis can often accompany an accessory navicular and peroneal tendonitis
is associated with excessive pronation.
• Osteochondritis of different structures present across somewhat differing but
broad age ranges: fifth metatarsal base enthesis (9–15 years), Achilles
insertional apophysitis (6–17 years), navicular articular chondritis (3–7 years
old).
• A dissecans osteochondritis lesion of the dome of the talus presents with
hindfoot pain ± catching/locking of the hindfoot. Severe lesions can develop
osteonecrosis.
• JIA and pain amplification syndromes can present with foot symptoms though
it is wise to rule out all trauma and developmental lesions initially. Dual
pathology of course may exist.
Examination
Examination should begin with functional assessment of gait, jumping, hopping,
toe walking, walking on heels and in inversion, and figure-of-8 running. Major
problems will become apparent.
• Observe when standing and look for pelvic tilt, hindfoot valgus, subtalar and
forefoot position, medial longitudinal foot arch, claw toes and a Morton’s foot
(first ray shorter than second).
• Palpate and move the foot to reproduce pain and assess range of movement.
• Be aware that if the subtalar is only examined offloaded, abnormalities of the
joint may not be apparent.
• Test heel rise to assess rigid or flexible pes planus.
• Check thigh–foot angle to screen for tibial torsion (see
‘Internal tibial
torsion’, p. 180).
• Other examination: is there correctable forefoot adduction? Is there pain on
hindfoot external rotation suggesting a deficiency to the anterior talofibular

[SECTION]ligament?.
• Check strength (active movement against resistance) of ankle dorsiflexion and
plantar flexion, subtalar inversion (tibialis posterior), subtalar eversion
(peroneal tendons), first MTPJ dorsiflexion (EHL) and plantar flexion (FHL).
• Finally examine the knee (see p. 185).
Common foot conditions in children and adolescents
Metatarsus adductus (MTA)
This is a common exaggerated turning in of the forefoot typically identified
when the child starts to walk.
• MTA may be detected at birth, when attributed to an in utero foot position.
• Most MTA configurations are flexible and asymptomatic and require no
intervention.
• Stretching may help the foot move into a straighter position and may be
supported by the use of a boot, although evidence for this is limited. Casting
and surgery are rarely required—only in severe cases.
Calcaneovalgus
This excess dorsiflexion and valgus of the hindfoot, detected in neonates, is
typically identified when the child starts to walk.
• The position of the foot is usually correctable by the examiner.
• There is no dislocation or bony deformity.
• Muscle imbalance due to neurological disturbance may result in weakness of
the plantar flexors and unopposed action of tibialis anterior and foot extensors.
• Radiographs typically show posteromedial bowing of the tibia and the first
metatarsal lining up with a vertically held talus.
• The condition differs from rocker bottom feet which are not correctable—
when the talus is plantar to the first metatarsal.
• Prognosis is good with spontaneous resolution. Passive stretching exercises
may expedite resolution.
Pes planus
Pes planus (flat feet) is a normal variant in young children unless the foot is rigid
from a neurological deficit (diplegia) or bony changes.
• Associations of pes planus include hind foot valgus, tightening of the Achilles
tendon, and inward rotation of the forefoot to balance the heel position (or the
foot may begin to slant outwards from the middle of the foot).
• Hypermobile pes planus corrects if the child rises on tip-toe.
Radiographs need only be done for rigid flat feet or if pain suggests a tarsal

[SECTION]coalition, congenital vertical talus, or accessory navicular.
• Usually no treatment is needed and the patient should be encouraged to walk
barefoot as much as possible.
• The value of arch supports is debated as this does not improve the dynamic
support of the foot and may make things worse, although can provide pain
relief.
Pes cavus
A high medial longitudinal arch that does not flatten when weight-bearing is
termed pes cavus. It is present in 10% of the population.
• A full neurological history (including of motor milestones) and examination is
wise.
• Pes cavus may rarely indicate neuromuscular disease (hereditary motor
sensory neuropathy, Friedrich’s ataxia, muscular dystrophy, or cerebral palsy).
• If pes cavus is unilateral or rapidly progressive, then consider there may be a
spinal tumour.
• Associated clawing of the toes, contracture of the plantar fascia, and
dorsiflexed great toe may cause midfoot pain.
• May also affect footwear.
• Physiotherapy, foot orthoses, and foot wear modifications for pain or
instability should be considered.
• Surgical treatment is reserved for cases where conservative measures have
failed. Surgery includes tendon transfers, soft tissue manipulation, osteotomy
and arthrodesis
Talipes equinovarus (clubfoot)
• The flexible variant is a common congenital deformity and requires
physiotherapy guidance alone.
• The rigid form, which is of genetic aetiology, typically responds to the Ponseti
method of manipulation without invasive surgery.
Tarsal coalition
A tarsal coalition is a congenital anomaly where there is an abnormal fibrous,
cartilaginous or osseous connection between hindfoot bones.
• Coalitions are usually asymptomatic.
• Pain occurs when there is decompensation of supporting musculature, a rigid
flat foot, hindfoot valgus, or peroneal spasticity.
• The commonest coalitions are calcaneonavicular (presenting at 8–12 years
old) and talocalcaneal (presenting in 12–15-year-olds).
• Radiographs confirm the lesions but MRI is helpful in characterizing fibrous

[SECTION]variants and assessment of bone stress (bone oedema).
• Management includes ‘determined’ physiotherapy working on gait and muscle
support of the foot, which, if successful avoids surgery.
• Overall surgery is rarely required and not desired.
In-toeing
Clumsiness or regular tripping after 2 years of age is common. Mild in-toeing
may be a normal variant. However, assessment requires a thorough examination
of potential contributing factors which might be modifiable with physiotherapy
and/or foot orthoses (e.g. femoral anteversion, MTA, or any condition resulting
in muscle weakness).
Toe anomalies
• Congenital curly toes result from shortening of flexor tendons as child starts to
walk. Surgical tendon release can be considered in cases where there are
painful blisters or rubbing.
• A hammer toe is a tendon contracture with progressive PIPJ flexion and
compensatory extension at the MTPJs and DIPJs. Management, including for
pain, is usually conservative.
• A mallet toe is a contracture of the DIPJs.
• A claw toe is formed from dorsal toe subluxation at the MTPJs and flexion
deformities at the PIPJs and DIPJs.
• Toe instability (dorsal subluxation of the proximal phalanx over the metatarsal
head) is rare in young people. Often there is a history of repeat tearing (pain)
and swelling of the plantar plate with local tenderness and swelling.
• Polydactyly occurs 1 in 500 live births with radial, ulnar, or central extra
digits. There is a high likelihood of syndromic genetic anomaly and chance of
multiple genetic defects. A referral to a geneticist is recommended.
• Syndactyly is an embryonic failure of apoptosis of the digit webbing at about
16 weeks’ gestation. Most lesions are isolated defects but there may also be an
association with genetic defects.

Skin disorders and rheumatic disease
The importance of examining the skin
• The skin is the most accessible organ to examine.
• Pattern recognition of skin symptoms and lesions is valuable in aiding
diagnosis (e.g. acute or chronic sarcoid) and prognosis of rheumatic diseases
(e.g. nodules and vasculitis in RA).
• MSK abnormalities may be mirrored by skin abnormalities (e.g. joint
hypermobility and skin laxity with bruising, scarring, and striae).
• Some antirheumatic drugs produce specific and potentially serious cutaneous
reactions that require prompt management.
• Some rare autoinflammatory conditions associated with MSK symptoms can
manifest primarily with skin pathology (see Chapter 18).
Regional abnormalities
The scalp

[SECTION]Scalp symptoms and lesions may be subtle.
• Scalp tenderness is a sign of GCA.
• C2 root/occipital neuropathy (e.g. in C1–C3 facet joint OA or crowned dens
syndrome/CPPD disease) or shingles may be associated with dysaesthesia over
the scalp and occipital neuralgia.
• Alopecia may be localized (areata) or diffuse (e.g. in SLE or iron deficiency).
Scarring alopecia is typical of discoid lupus.
• Scalp psoriasis may be patchy and discrete, and often affects the hairline.
Face and ears
Face and ears are in sun-exposed areas. Consider ultraviolet (UV) skin
sensitivity.
• A variety of patterns of SLE-associated, UV-sensitive rashes may occur. The
rash is often diffuse. Shaded areas (e.g. nasolabial folds) may not be affected
(see Chapter 13).
• As in SLE, rosacea can present with an erythematous facial rash. Distinction is
sometimes difficult without biopsy.
• Periorbital oedema occurs in dermatomyositis, angio-oedema (which may be a
presenting feature of SLE), and in nephrotic syndrome.
• Heliotrope rash refers to violaceous oedema/erythema of the eyelids in
dermatomyositis (see Chapter 14).
• The cutaneous infiltration of chronic sarcoid (lupus pernio) (see Chapter 18)
across the nose and cheeks may be overt (papular) but also may be quite subtle
(see Plate 21).
• Saddle nose deformity/nasal cartilage destruction has a number of causes:
PR3-positive ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV; see Chapter 15), relapsing
polychondritis ( Chapter 18), hereditary connective tissue disease (e.g.
Stickler’s syndrome; see Chapter 19), and lethal midline granuloma. Nasal
septal perforation can occur from cocaine use.
• Oral aphthous ulcers are common. Oral ulceration may follow disease activity
(e.g. in SLE). Ulcers in reactive arthritis are typically painless. Oral aphthous
ulcers are frequently idiopathic, and not associated with systemic disease.
• Large punched-out and numerous tongue and buccal ulcers that scar are a
hallmark of Behçet’s disease (see Chapter 18). They may remain for several
weeks.
• Strawberry erythema of the tongue and lips should not be missed in children. It
may denote self-limiting streptococcal infections but may also herald the
desquamating palmar (and sole) rash of Kawasaki disease (KD; see Chapter
15).

[SECTION]• Lacy white streaks on the buccal mucosa suggest lichen planus.
• The pinna is a common site for gouty tophi and discoid lupus. Relapsing
polychondritis typically causes softening and distortion of cartilage (but is
lobe-sparing).
• Lipid skin deposits around the eye occur in hyperlipidaemia and multicentric
reticulohistiocytosis.
Hands and nails
Hands and nails should be examined closely.
• A photosensitive eruption spares the finger webs and palms.
• Erythema on the back of the fingers may help distinguish dermatomyositis
from SLE.
• In patients with Raynaud’s disease (RD), finger ulceration, finger pulp atrophy
(with smooth tapering of the finger tips), induration, and tethering of the skin
indicate scleroderma (see Chapter 13).
• Unlike normal skin, the skin of scleroderma does not form fine wrinkles when
pinched.
• Onycholysis, nail-pitting, salmon patches, and subungual hyperkeratosis are
typical of psoriasis (see Chapter 8).
• Subungual splinter haemorrhages may be associated with trauma, infective
endocarditis, vasculitis, or thromboangiitis obliterans.
• Nailfold capillaries can be examined with an ophthalmoscope at 40 dioptres
after applying a drop of oil (or surgical lubricant) to the cuticle. Enlarged
(dilated) capillary loops and capillary ‘dropout’ suggests an underlying
autoimmune connective tissue disease (AICTD), particularly systemic
sclerosis (SScl).
• Nailfold vasculopathy is non-specific, and can occur with vasculitis,
dermatomyositis and infective endocarditis.
Types of eruption
Macular rashes
Macular rashes are flat (non-palpable) areas of altered skin colour. Papules are
lumps <1 cm in diameter.
• Maculopapular rashes are typical of viral infections.
• A short-lived, pinkish, maculopapular eruption occurs on the trunk and limbs
in systemic-onset JIA (soJIA; see Chapter 9) and adult-onset Still’s disease
(see Chapter 18). It is often prominent in the late afternoon, and coincides
with temperature spikes. If scratched, the rash may blanch (Koebner
phenomenon).

[SECTION]• Erythema that enlarges to form erythematous patches with pale centres
suggests rheumatic fever (‘erythema marginatum’).
• A ‘bulls-eye’ erythematous lesion around a tick bite may be the erythema
migrans of Lyme disease.
• Maculopapular eruptions can occur from NSAIDs, gold, sulfasalazine,
azathioprine hypersensitivity, and leflunomide (see Chapter 23).
Pustules and blisters
Blisters may be vesicles (<0.5 cm) or bullae (>0.5 cm).
• The most common pustular rash is due to folliculitis.
• Pustules confined to the hands and feet suggest reactive arthritis or SAPHO,
although local forms of psoriasis may be indistinguishable. Psoriasis can also
occur as ‘raindrop’ erythematous lesions, also known as guttate lesions.
• Generalized pustular rashes can occur in vasculitis, the neutrophilic
dermatoses, intestinal bypass syndromes, Behçet’s disease, and gonococcal
bacteraemia.
• Bullous eruptions may be due to SLE and drug reactions, pemphigus, and
pemphigoid.
Plaques
Plaques are slightly raised, circumscribed areas—often disc shaped.
• Plaques are the hallmark of psoriasis. Skin may be scaly and flake off easily.
Lesions are often red.
• Psoriatic plaques can occur anywhere on the skin, but typical sites are over the
extensor surfaces of the joints, in the intergluteal cleft, at sites of skin friction
(e.g. under waistbands of trousers or underwear) and the umbilicus.
• Scaling may be a feature of discoid lupus; scaling tends to occur at the
periphery of the lesion.
Vascular lesions
Bleeding into the skin that does not blanch is called purpura. It may sometimes
be palpable. Telangiectases are dilated small vascular lesions that blanch on
pressure.
• Non-palpable purpura may be due to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction,
trauma (± capillary/skin fragility, e.g. chronic steroid use), haemophilia,
anticoagulation, and hereditary connective tissue diseases (e.g. EDS; see
Chapter 19).
• Palpable purpura suggests vasculitis, including drug-induced disease (see
Chapter 15).
• Widespread telangiectasia occurs in limited cutaneous scleroderma (lcSScl;

[SECTION]see
Chapter 13), hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, and
dermatomyositis.
• Livedoid rashes can be subtle, occur mainly over the legs, can occur in
smokers but are also associated with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome
(APS).
• Lumpy erythema on the lower legs especially, which can be tender, may be
panniculitis (e.g. erythema nodosum), and related to systemic disease (e.g.
sarcoid, Crohn’s)
Ulcers and ulcerating rashes
Ulcers are defined as a loss or defect of dermis and epidermis produced by
sloughing of necrotic tissue.
• Cutaneous ulceration may have more than one cause in autoimmune diseases.
For example, vasculitis, venous stasis in an immobile patient, and ulceration
over nodules or pressure points may all contribute to the same set of lesions.
Trauma may be an important cause of cutaneous ulcers in a patient who is
already predisposed towards forming these lesions.
• An indurated, expanding, plum-coloured plaque or acneiform pustule that then
ulcerates suggests pyoderma gangrenosum. The ulcer has irregular, bluish
margins.
• Neurotropic ulcers are classic sequelae of diabetes, but they can also occur in
association with mononeuritis multiplex (from vasculitis) and other rheumatic
diseases.
• Vasculitic ulcers in the context of livedo reticularis and antibodies to
phospholipids (e.g. cardiolipin) may denote APS (see Chapter 11).
Textural abnormalities
Abnormalities of the texture of the skin may be difficult to discern. Atrophy and
thinning, laxity, thickening, and induration may all be associated with disease.
• Generalized skin atrophy and thinning is an age-related process, but this can
be accelerated by chronic steroid use; hereditary diseases of connective tissue
should also be considered.
• Skin laxity can best be demonstrated over elbow and knee extensor surfaces.
Generalized laxity of connective tissue may result in varicose veins and
internal organ prolapse.
• True acral and digital puffiness in a patient with Raynaud’s disease is
suggestive of SScl. Skin thickening has a variety of causes (see later in this
topic and Chapter 13).
• Scleroderma and scleroderma-like skin may be localized, limited, or diffuse—

[SECTION]this distinction is important (Table 4.1).
Diagnostic issues in patients with skin thickening
• Raynaud’s disease (RD) invariably precedes the onset of SScl, but is not a
characteristic of morphea or linear scleroderma.
• In patients with RD, abnormal nailfold capillaries on capillaroscopy may
indicate SScl (see Plate 9).
• The specificities of autoantibodies are often predictive of SScl subtype. In
patients with RD, ANA has predictive value for identifying patients who may
progress to SScl; anticentromere antibody can predict progression to limited
cutaneous SScl; anti-topoisomerase I (SCL-70) and anti-RNA polymerase
antibodies are linked with progression to diffuse cutaneous SScl (dcSScl).
• Patients with dcSScl have a preponderance of visceral organ involvement in
the first 5 years of disease; screening investigations are usually useful, and
should include cardiovascular screening tests (refer to Chapter 13).
• Eosinophilic fasciitis (see
Chapter 18) may occur as a paraneoplastic
syndrome, and is associated with haematological malignancies.
• Linear scleroderma in children can produce lifelong deformities because limbs
fail to develop correct length and bulk.

Classification Skin features
Morphea
may be
localized
(guttate) or
generalized

Early small skin areas affected (itchy). Progression to
hidebound skin, typically on trunk (areola spared) and legs.
Lesions become waxy and hypo/hyper-pigmented guttate
(small <10 mm) papules usually on neck and anterior chest

Linear
scleroderma

Linear band-like pattern often in dermatomal distribution.
Atrophy of muscles is common. Fixed joint deformities and
growth abnormalities can occur

‘Coup de
sabre’

Linear scleroderma on the face/scalp can be depressed; ivory
in appearance. Hemi-atrophy can occur

SScl (early)

Early morning ‘puffiness’ in hands and feet, facial ‘tightness’.
Non-pitting oedema of intact dermal and epidermal
appendages. High degree of suspicion needed

SScl (classic) Firm, taut, hidebound skin proximal to MCP joints. Skin may

[SECTION]be coarse, pigmented, and dry. Epidermal thinning, loss of
hair, and sweating can occur. Telangiectasia and skin
calcinosis become obvious. Skin creases disappear. Such
change proximal to elbows or knees in the limbs or below the
clavicles (in those with face and neck involvement) classifies
disease as diffuse as opposed to limited systemic sclerosis
SScl (late)

2–15 years after onset of classical phase, skin softens, but
pigmentation changes remain. Skin becomes atrophic and can
ulcerate

Eosinophilic
fasciitis

Phases: early—pitting oedema; progressive—peau d’orange;
late—induration (‘woody feel’) with venous guttering when
limb elevated. Arms and legs most commonly affected, but
fingers mainly spared. Synovitis and low-grade myositis may
occur. Eosinophilia is usually striking, but not always present

Lipodermato- Hyperpigmentation and induration of lower legs associated
sclerosis
with venous stasis (‘champagne-bottle legs’)
Diabetes

Waxy thickening of extremities. Insidious progression. Joints
of the hands become stiff, the tendons can thicken. Skin
changes proximal to wrist and on the face very unlikely, but
stiffening of elbow and shoulder joints not uncommon

Dependent
Feet/ankles/lower legs. Often pitting. Chronic presence may
lymphoedema give hyperkeratosis. Main causes: R- or L-sided heart failure,
renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, and low-protein states

Skin vasculitis in adults
Background
There are a variety of ways in which systemic vasculitis may present, including
fever of unknown origin, organ infarction, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and
high acute phase in a generally unwell patient. A vasculitic skin rash is one of
the most common presenting features of systemic vasculitis, and is an important
diagnostic clue (see Chapter 15).
When to consider a diagnosis of vasculitis
• Primary systemic vasculitis is rare.
• Cutaneous vasculitis, however, is not rare; it can follow viral or bacterial

[SECTION]illness, can be triggered by drugs, and is associated with malignancy. Biopsy
generally demonstrates degranulation of neutrophils (‘leucocytoclasis’) and
evidence of vessel destruction.
• The list of causes is long (Table 4.2); however, in about 50% of cases no cause
may be found.
• Cutaneous vasculitis may also occur in association with another autoimmune
disease not normally characterized by vasculitis, such as SLE, RA, and
Sjögren’s syndrome.
Important considerations
The following important points of clinical assessment should be followed in
patients with possible vasculitic rashes.
• Determine whether the patient has been taking a new drug. Many antibiotics,
including penicillins, sulfonamides, and cephalosporins, cause cutaneous
vasculitis. Biologics may too, notably anti-TNFα.
• Evaluate the patient for evidence of chronic infection: hepatitis B, hepatitis C,
and HIV are worth considering. Endocarditis should also be considered (e.g.
the elderly, or patients who use IV drugs).
• Look for evidence of a primary autoimmune disorder that may be associated
with cutaneous vasculitis. IBD, for example, can occasionally cause a
leucocytoclastic vasculitis in addition to oral ulcerations and pyoderma
gangrenosum. Because SLE is common, check ANA and serum complement
C3/C4.
• Look for evidence of cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis. Serum cryoglobulins tests
are often mishandled, leading to false-negative results, primarily because the
sample needs to be kept warm (usually by simply holding in the closed palm
of the hand) and should be taken straight to the laboratory.
• RF is detected in 80% of patients with mixed essential cryoglobulinaemia, and
may be a better screening test than the latter.
• Age-appropriate screening for malignancy should be done. Serum and urine
electrophoresis with immunofixation may be of value.
• Urinalysis may demonstrate ‘active sediment’; evidence of haematuria,
proteinuria, or red blood cell casts may be the first clue that a patient has a
systemic vasculitis.
Systemic vasculitis
• Untreated primary systemic vasculitis is generally characterized by general
inflammation; many patients will complain of B-type symptoms, including
fevers, weight loss, and night sweats. Patients with cutaneous vasculitis alone,

[SECTION]on the other hand, often feel quite well.
• The extracutaneous signs and symptoms may provide clues to the correct
diagnosis:
• Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP): colicky abdominal pain.
• Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis: adult-onset asthma,
eosinophilia.
• PR3-positive AAV: chronic sinusitis, pneumonitis.
• Microscopic polyangiitis: haemoptysis, red blood cell casts.
• Mononeuritis multiplex, which presents as a ‘wrist drop’ or ‘foot drop’, is
suggestive of systemic vasculitis in a non-diabetic patient.

Investigations
Skin biopsy

[SECTION]• Discuss the case with a histopathologist.
• Punch biopsy is simple, and may be sufficient to yield a diagnosis. Elliptical
biopsy provides more tissue, and may increase yield.
• Use a needle to lift the skin sample. Avoid forceps-induced damage.
• Biopsy should extend to the subcutaneous fat, which generally includes the
arterioles and venules affected by primary systemic vasculitis. Idiopathic
leucocytoclastic vasculitis affects the capillaries but generally spares the
arterioles and venules.
• Biopsy should be sent for routine histology and for direct
immunofluorescence, which may yield important clues regarding the
underlying cause:
• IgA: HSP.
• IgM, C3: cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis.
• IgG, IgM, IgA, C3: SLE.
• Low immunoreactant staining: AAV.
• Samples for immunofluorescence should be snap frozen in liquid N2 or dry ice
or transported immediately to the laboratory. Immunofluorescence cannot be
done on samples treated with formalin.
• See Table 4.3 for a list of laboratory investigations to be carried out in patients
with suspected vasculitis.
Table 4.3 Laboratory tests in patients with suspected vasculitis

Haematology FBC, ESR, lupus anticoagulant
Biochemistry Electrolytes, urea, creatinine, LFTs, ACE, CRP, serum and
urine protein electrophoresis
Microbiology Urine microscopy for red cell casts, blood culture, Hep B and
C serology, consider HIV, streptococcal antibodies. Also, save
10 mL of clotted blood for viral serology and repeat in 2–3
weeks for paired titre analysis
Immunology Immunoglobulins (include IgG subsets if IgG4 disease being
considered), cryoglobulins, ANA, ENAs, RF, anti-cardiolipin
antibodies, ANCA, Complement (C3, C4, CH50/CH100, antiC1q antibodies if considering urticarial vasculitis))

Cardiac conditions

[SECTION]Subclinical cardiac involvement is found in many rheumatic MSK diseases, and
it is not uncommon for a cardiac abnormality to be discovered incidentally. As
our ability to treat the underlying rheumatic diseases improves, our ability to
identify and to treat the cardiac complications of these diseases becomes
increasingly important.
Pericardium
• Pericardial effusion has been reported in association with a large number of
rheumatic diseases, including SScl, Sjögren’s syndrome, polymyositis, mixed
connective tissue disease (MCTD), RA, SpAs, and systemic vasculitides.
• In the majority of cases, effusions are discovered incidentally, are often small,
clinically asymptomatic, and require no specific therapy.
• Pericardial effusions can also occur in the setting of non-rheumatic illness.
When a patient with a known rheumatic disease presents with a symptomatic
effusion, it is important to consider other possible explanations, such as
infection (e.g. TB, viral), malignancy, and other unrelated conditions (uraemia,
hypothyroidism).
• Pericardial effusions are common in SLE and are due to immune complex
deposition into the pericardium. Effusions can be serous, serosanguinous, or
haemorrhagic. Analysis of the pericardial fluid generally demonstrates
evidence of complement, immune complexes, and leucocytes, consistent with
an active inflammatory state.
• Although pericardial effusions are common with SLE, they are generally
trivial. Cardiac tamponade is found in <1% of patients with SLE. Since the
effusion tends to reflect the overall disease, generally treatment of the
underlying disease is adequate to resolve the effusion. Rarely, therapeutic
pericardiocentesis may be required.
• Pericardial effusions are found in up to 30% of patients with RA, although
only a small number of these patients will present with pericarditis or evidence
of tamponade.
• Pericardial effusions are more common in RF-positive patients with a history
of rheumatoid nodules. Chronic pericardial effusions can become infected, and
in rare cases lead to constrictive pericarditis.
• For both groups of patients, the presence of a symptomatic pericardial effusion
is associated with increased mortality. In one study of patients with SLE who
presented with cardiac tamponade, the 5-year survival was only 46%.
Myocardium
• Myocarditis is an uncommon feature of rheumatic diseases. Myocarditis can

[SECTION]•

•

•

•

be found among patients with active SLE and RA, although it generally does
not lead to clinically significant dysfunction.
Cardiomyopathy among patients with RA and SLE is more likely to be due to
premature coronary artery disease, followed by the development of ischaemic
heart disease.
Although uncommon, the possibility of hydroxychloroquine-induced
cardiomyopathy should be considered in patients who develop congestive
heart failure in the absence of coronary artery disease. The diagnosis can be
confirmed with myocardial biopsy, and the condition responds to drug
cessation.
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; formerly Churg–Strauss
vasculitis) can lead to an acute eosinophilic myocarditis that can be lifethreatening if not treated promptly.
One-third of patients with AAV may have cardiac dysfunction as a
consequence of the underlying vasculitis. The majority of these patients will
have wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, but valvulitis and
ventricular aneurysm have also been reported. The majority of these lesions
will be asymptomatic, but the 5-year survival rate for patients with cardiac
lesions attributable to AAV is 57%.

Valvular disease
• Aortic regurgitation is an important potential consequence of aortitis, which
can occur with any of the large-vessel vasculitides (including Takayasu
arteritis, GCA, and Behçet’s disease). The aortitis leads to aneurysms, which
create valvular incompetence.
• Aortic regurgitation can also occur as a consequence of AS. Unlike the
vasculitides, in AS there is inflammation at the aortic root leading to dense
scarring of the aortic valves. Although the mechanism is unique to this disease,
it should be monitored and treated like any form of aortic insufficiency.
• Mitral regurgitation and mitral valve prolapse are common manifestations of
SLE.
• Mitral valve prolapse may also be a feature of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.
• A more serious valvulitis can occur in association with SLE or APS. In the
process of healing, the valves become scarred and calcified, a process that can
eventually lead to clinically significant valvular disease.
• Libman–Sacks endocarditis is a classic manifestation of SLE. In this disease,
vegetations form from immune complexes, mononuclear cells, and fibrin,
which attach to the valves. Although not infectious, these vegetations can
embolize.

[SECTION]• Haemodynamically insignificant valve lesions have also been reported in
association with RA, MCTD, SScl, and Sjögren’s syndrome.
Coronary artery disease
• Surprisingly, the primary vasculitides rarely lead to coronary artery
inflammation, although coronary artery vasculitis has been reported in
association with PAN and AAVs.
• APS is associated with a substantial increased risk of myocardial infarction,
even in the absence of true coronary artery disease.
• Both RA and SLE are strongly associated with coronary artery disease. This
may be the result of systemic inflammation or a response to chronic
immunosuppression. Regardless, patients with these diagnoses should undergo
early cardiac evaluation to address modifiable risk factors for coronary artery
disease.
• Accelerated atherosclerosis may be an important consequence of
glucocorticoid exposure. Even chronic low-dose prednisone may place some
patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
Conduction abnormalities
• Clinically insignificant dysrhythmias and conduction defects are common
among patients with inflammatory myopathies (dermatomyositis,
polymyositis) and scleroderma.
• Clinically significant abnormalities (including heart block) can be seen in
patients with SpAs as a result of the same scaring process that leads to the
valvular abnormalities noted earlier.

Pulmonary conditions
Pleura
• An exudative pleural effusion is found in up to 50% of patients with SLE.
These effusions can be unilateral or bilateral, and frequently are found in
association with a pericardial effusion.
• Pleural disease is a common manifestation of RA, which is associated with
pleural effusions and pleural thickening. Effusions are generally
asymptomatic, and are found in the setting of active disease.
• Asymptomatic pleural effusions can also be found in 10–30% of patients with
AAV.
• Pleural effusions are classified as transudates, typically arising as a
consequence of left ventricular, renal and hepatic failure, and SLE; or

[SECTION]exudates, usually due to infection, malignancy or pulmonary embolism.
• By the ‘Light’ criteria (with a 75–80% sensitivity) a transudate is:
• clear.
• specific gravity <1.012.
• fluid protein <2 g/dL.
• fluid:serum protein ratio <0.5.
• fluid:serum LDH ratio <2/3.
• cholesterol <45 g/dL.
• In the same criteria, an exudate is defined as:
• cloudy.
• specific gravity >1.020.
• fluid protein >2.9 g/dL.
• fluid:serum protein ratio >0.5.
• fluid:serum LDH ratio >2/3.
• cholesterol >45 g/dL.
• If an exudate is identified fluid should be examined for:
• amylase: in oesophageal rupture, pancreatitis.
• glucose: decreased in infection, malignancy and RA.
• pH: low in empyema.
• Gram stain.
• polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for tuberculosis.
Pulmonary nodules/masses
• Both PR3-positive AAV and sarcoidosis are often diagnosed incidentally, after
the discovery of lung masses. Sarcoidosis is associated with hilar
lymphadenopathy, while PR3-positive AAV generally presents with multiple
peripheral pulmonary nodules that can be mistaken for lung cancer.
• In a patient with a known rheumatic disease who presents with a lung mass, it
is always important to consider the possibility of malignancy. Lung cancer risk
is increased among patients with RA and SScl, and many rheumatic diseases
are associated with an increased risk of lymphoma.
• PR3-positive AAV (and less commonly, AS and RA) can lead to cavitating
apical lesions that can be mistaken for TB.
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
• ILD and pulmonary fibrosis (with a predilection for the lung bases and
periphery) is a common feature of both dcSScl and the inflammatory
myopathies.
• Pulmonary fibrosis is found in 20–65% of patients with SScl.

[SECTION]•
•
•
•
•
•

Radiographically, the lesions take on the appearance of ground glass ILD
infiltrates that gradually lead to honeycombing and fibrosis.
ILD may be the initial manifestation of an inflammatory myopathy, and
pulmonary symptoms may precede clinical evidence of muscle involvement.
RA is also associated with ILD.
Apical fibrosis can be found in 1% of patients with AS. Apical fibrosis is also
an uncommon feature of rheumatoid lung.
Pulmonary fibrosis can also occur as the long-term sequelae of pulmonary
capillaritis, which may occur in patients with AAV.
ILD in primary Sjögren’s syndrome can be subtle and evolve insidiously. The
usual pattern is non-specific (NSIP).
Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) has been associated
with autoimmune rheumatic and connective tissue diseases but the association
is not frequent.

Vasculature
• Haemoptysis can be the result of pulmonary capillaritis, which can be found in
association with the so-called pulmonary renal syndromes: SLE, AAV
(predominantly microscopic polyangiitis), and anti-glomerular basement
membrane syndrome. Acute or severe pulmonary vasculitis may require
prompt plasmapheresis.
• Cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis can also cause pulmonary capillaritis, although
this is not one of its more common manifestations.
• Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is most commonly associated with
lcSScl. Isolated PAH can also be seen with dcSScl, although it generally
appears as a consequence of pulmonary fibrosis.
• SScl causes PAH by narrowing of the small arteries and arterioles that
gradually leads to obliteration of the pulmonary vascular bed.
• RA, SLE, inflammatory myopathy, MCTD, and Sjögren’s syndrome can also
be associated with PAH, but it is considered an uncommon feature of these
diseases.
Airways
• RA can lead to laryngeal obstruction when it affects the cricoarytenoid joints.
It usually presents with hoarseness or odynophagia.
• Subglottic stenosis is a common feature of PR3-positive AAV, which can lead
to significant stridor.
• Uncontrolled relapsing polychondritis can cause tracheomalacia, which is a
significant cause of morbidity for this disease.

[SECTION]• Any part of the airway can become symptomatic in primary Sjögren’s
syndrome: xerotrachea, xerostomia, sinus symptoms.

Renal conditions
Evaluation of renal failure: overview
The kidneys are an essential component in the evaluation and management of the
rheumatic MSK diseases.
• In terms of time course, renal failure may be secondary to acute kidney injury
(AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI can occur in patients with stable
CKD.
• AKI (grade 1) is defined when one of the following criteria is met:
• Serum creatinine rises by ≥26 µmol/L within 48 hours.
• Serum creatinine rises ≥1.5× from the reference value, which is known or
presumed to have occurred within 1 week.
• Urine output is <0.5 mL/kg/hour for >6 consecutive hours.
• The above-listed indices are the minimum required for definition (grade 2 and
3 AKI have definitions: http://www.renal.org/guidelines/modules/acutekidney-injury).
• Urgent urinalysis and renal ultrasound should be obtained in all AKI patients.
• Glomerular filtration rate value (mL/min/1.73m2) classifies renal function as
WHO stage: normal (grade 1; >90), mild (grade 2; 60–89), moderate (grade 3;
30–59), severe (grade 4; 15–29), severe failure (grade 5; <15).
• The presence of red blood cells and protein, or red blood cell casts (i.e. ‘an
active sediment’) implies glomerulonephritis, which can occur with vasculitis
and SLE.
Pre-renal azotaemia
• Hypovolaemia is an important cause of pre-renal AKI. Dehydration and
anaemia can both lead to pre-renal azotaemia (e.g. the elderly RA patient).
• Renal hypoperfusion can also be caused by diminished blood flow to the
kidneys. Diseases involving the renal artery (such as renal artery stenosis or
thrombosis or PAN affecting the renal artery) may cause pre-renal azotaemia.
This may be acute leading to AKI or slowly evolving causing CKD.
• Conditions associated with low cardiac output (including shock, congestive
heart failure, myocarditis, tamponade, and pulmonary arterial hypertension)
may all predispose the patient to pre-renal AKI.
• Hyperviscosity, which is seen with type I (monoclonal) cryoglobulinaemia, is
a very rare cause of pre-renal azotaemia.

[SECTION]• All of these conditions may be exacerbated by drugs that decrease renal
perfusion, including NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors.
• With pre-renal azotaemia, the fractional excretion of sodium [FENa = (UNa ×
PCr)/(PNa × UCr)] is <1.0; this test is not reliable in patients treated with
diuretics.
Post-renal azotaemia
• Nephrolithiasis is not a common cause of post-renal azotaemia, but should be
considered in a patient with gout: 5–10% of renal calculi in the United States
are caused by uric acid; this is particularly common among patients with gout
who have been treated with uricosuric agents (e.g. probenecid).
• Sarcoidosis can cause hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria, which in turn can
lead to nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, both of which can rarely cause
post-renal azotaemia.
• Methotrexate and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can cause crystalluria and
renal obstruction.
• Ultrasound is a useful modality to evaluate both for the presence of obstruction
leading to hydronephrosis and renal calculi.
Intrinsic renal failure: ‘active sediment’
• Intrinsic renal disease from a rheumatological conditions can present acutely
(AKI) or insidiously as evolving CKD.
• The nephritic syndromes are an important cause of moderate/severe AKI
among patients with rheumatic diseases, particularly vasculitis and SLE.
• The presence of haematuria, proteinuria, and red blood cell casts strongly
suggests the presence of glomerulonephritis.
• A renal biopsy is crucial to determining the underlying diagnosis and the
severity/chronicity of the disease.
• Nephritic syndromes can be divided into ‘focal proliferative’ and ‘diffuse
proliferative’ based on histology.
• Causes of focal proliferative glomerulonephritis include SLE, HSP, and other
forms of small vessel vasculitis.
• Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis is caused by cryoglobulinaemia, SLE,
anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (Goodpasture’s syndrome), and
small-vessel vasculitis (including AAV and renal-limited vasculitis).
• Direct immunofluorescence can also provide valuable information regarding
the correct diagnosis: SLE biopsy demonstrates multiple immunoreactants
(‘full house’ staining pattern); IgA deposition implies HSP; cryoglobulinaemic
vasculitis leads to IgG and C3 deposition; sparse or absent immunoreactants

[SECTION]on biopsy is sometimes called ‘pauci-immune’, and implies an AAV.
Intrinsic renal failure: ‘bland sediment’
• A bland sediment refers to a urine sample that is acellular; transparent hyaline
casts may be seen.
• A bland sediment is also seen in pre-renal and post-renal azotaemia.
• Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) reflects acute, intrinsic renal failure associated
with a urine sediment that has muddy brown casts and tubular epithelial cells.
• Nephrotoxic tubular injury from drugs is a common cause of ATN in patients
with rheumatic disease.
• Prolonged pre-renal azotaemia can lead to permanent kidney damage;
therefore, diseases of the renal artery (including polyarteritis nodosa and renal
artery thrombosis from APS) should be considered.
• Interstitial nephritis is most commonly seen as a drug reaction (e.g. gold,
penicillamine).
• Interstitial nephritis can also be seen as a manifestation of several rheumatic
diseases, including Sjögren’s, SLE, sarcoidosis, and EGPA.
• NSAIDs cause renal vasoconstriction and interstitial nephritis, both of which
can eventually lead to a chronic analgesic nephropathy.
• Unlike the other forms of AAV, the mechanism of renal failure among patients
with the EGPA is an interstitial nephritis; glomerulonephritis is relatively rare
with this diagnosis.
• The most common causes of secondary renal amyloidosis are AS, RA and
FMF. Glomerular deposits of amyloid lead to proteinuria (which can be
nephrotic range) and progressive renal failure.
SScl renal crisis
• SScl renal crisis is a rheumatologic emergency characterized by AKI and
malignant hypertension (see Chapter 25, p. 720).
• Patients with dcSScl are at greatest risk.
• SScl renal crisis generally occurs within the first 4 years after diagnosis, but it
can occur at any time. Patients who are treated with high-dose glucocorticoids
and are anti-RNP positive are at highest risk.
• Urinalysis generally demonstrates a bland sediment. Kidney biopsy
demonstrates evidence of a thrombotic microangiopathy that histologically
cannot be distinguished from malignant hypertensive nephrosclerosis,
haemolytic–uraemic syndrome, SLE, or APS.
• The cornerstone of therapy is escalating doses of ACE inhibitors, followed by
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers if

[SECTION]adequate blood pressure control is not achieved.
Renal tubular acidosis
• Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by
a failure of the renal tubules to maintain acid–base status.
• Type I RTA, caused by an inability to excrete acid, is found with Sjögren’s
syndrome and SLE.
• Type IV RTA is most commonly caused by hyporeninaemic
hypoaldosteronism, can occur as a result of treatment with NSAIDs, ACEinhibitors, and ARBs. This is commonly associated with hyperkalaemia.

Endocrine conditions
Well-characterized MSK conditions occur in many endocrine disorders. Some
are specific for certain disorders; others are non-specific, but occur with greater
frequency among patients with endocrine disease. MSK features occur either as
a result of metabolic disturbances or are influenced by a common link in
autoimmune pathophysiology.
Diabetes
• Dupuytren’s contracture, trigger finger, carpal tunnel syndrome, diffuse
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and adhesive capsulitis all occur with
greater frequency among patients with diabetes.
• Some form of tissue or joint hypomobility/stiffness is common among patients
with diabetes (Table 4.4); in some cases, this can appear similar to
scleroderma. These scleroderma-like skin changes are more prevalent among
patients with type I diabetes.
• Hand weakness may be due to diabetic neuropathy and may be mistaken for
carpal tunnel syndrome. Neurophysiology tests help discriminate between
these two diagnoses.
• Calcification of soft tissues around the shoulder occurs in approximately 20%
of diabetics, and is associated with variable symptoms and disability.
• Diabetic amyotrophy is uncommon. It presents acutely with pain, weakness,
and wasting of the proximal lower limb muscles. It may be unilateral.
Differential diagnosis includes myositis (see Chapter 14) and PMR. It is
associated with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia. The aetiology is unknown, but it
is probably a neuromyopathy.
• Though rare (1:500 diabetics), neuropathic arthritis can occur in advanced
disease. Most patients are aged 40–60 years and have poor glycaemic control.

[SECTION]•
•

•

•

Tarsal and metatarsal joints are most frequently affected (60%). The usual
presentation is of swelling of the foot with no or little pain. Trauma may have
occurred. Early radiographic changes can resemble OA.
Asymptomatic osteolysis can occur at the distal metatarsals and proximal
phalanges with relative joint sparing: aetiology unknown.
Osteomyelitis is not uncommon and needs to be discriminated from cellulitis
and neuropathic arthritis (Charcot’s joint). A triple-phase bone scan should be
helpful. Osteomyelitis is usually disclosed by prominent blood flow in the
dynamic (first) phase and increased uptake of tracer by soft tissue and bone in
later stages. Cellulitis is associated with minimal uptake of tracer in bone in
the delayed (third) phase. Neuropathic joints display minimal first-phase
abnormalities but prominent tracer uptake in the third phase.
Diabetic muscle infarction can present as a painful muscle mass and is a result
of arterial narrowing. Often mistaken for thrombophlebitis, myositis or
vasculitis, this is a late complication of diabetes. Biopsy may be needed to
confirm this diagnosis.
Diabetes may be associated with a ‘metabolic syndrome’ (diabetes +
hypertension, hyperuricaemia, obesity).
Table 4.4 Patterns of joint and tissue hypomobility/stiffness in diabetes by reported series. Tissue
changes are thought to occur from changes in hydration properties/kinetics of glycosaminoglycans

Hypothyroidism
• Over 25% of patients with hypothyroidism have an arthropathy—crosssectional data. The likeliest explanation is coincidental arthritis disease:
generalized OA, CPPD-related (see next bullet point) or an autoimmune
arthritis (e.g. RA). Whether a specific arthritis occurs directly as a result of
thyroid abnormality, is debatable.
• Radiographically-defined chondrocalcinosis is only marginally increased
compared with controls (17% vs 10%). About 1/10 patients with acute CPPD
are hypothyroid.
• Thyroid disease may also be autoimmune and the serum ANA positive, again
often mistaken for assuming the presence of a primary rheumatic condition.
• Carpal tunnel syndrome is common (7%). Up to 10% of patients with carpal
tunnel syndrome may have hypothyroidism.
• Hyperuricaemia is common, but gout attacks are rare. However, screening for
hypothyroidism in patients with gout is recommended. Treated
hypothyroidism then requires review of the need for uric acid-lowering
therapy.
• Myopathy is relatively common. About 1 in 20 cases of acquired myopathy
are due to hypothyroidism. The presentation can mimic polymyositis with
elevation of muscle enzymes, but muscle biopsy typically shows no
inflammatory cell infiltrate. Improvement with thyroxine replacement is
sometimes complicated by muscle cramps, but these should resolve in a few
weeks.
• The combination of weakness, muscular stiffness, and an increase in muscle
mass in an adult with myxoedema is termed Hoffman’s syndrome. Muscle
mass increase is sometimes striking and can take many months to resolve on
treatment.
• Lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s) is an autoimmune condition
characterized by hypothyroidism and autoantibodies to thyroglobulin and

[SECTION]thyroid microsomes. These antibodies are found in 40% of patients with
primary Sjögren’s syndrome, but only about 10% are or have been overtly
hypothyroid.
Thyrotoxicosis
• Hyperthyroidism can cause a proximal myopathy (70%), shoulder periarthritis
(7%), acropachy (thickening of extremities), and osteoporosis.
• Graves’ disease is frequently associated with fatigue and muscular weakness.
It is associated with autoimmune rheumatic and connective tissue diseases.
Thyroid acropachy
This is rare (<2% of patients with thyrotoxicosis) and most often occurs in
treated patients who are hypo/euthyroid.
• There is clubbing, and painful soft tissue swelling of hands and feet.
• Periosteal new bone occurs on the radial aspect of the second and third
metacarpals.
• Acropachy occurs most frequently in patients who have the ophthalmopathy or
dermopathy associated with autoimmune thyroid disease.
Hyperparathyroidism
See Chapter 16.
The following points refer to both primary and secondary disease:
• MSK symptoms are the initial manifestation in up to 16% of patients with
primary hyperparathyroidism.
• Hyperparathyroidism, chondrocalcinosis, and CPPD frequently coexist. Acute
CPPD can be triggered by parathyroidectomy.
• Chronic CPPD arthropathy can mimic RA. Unlike RA, synovial proliferation
is absent. Radiographically, erosions have a predilection for the carpus, midfeet and second/third MCPJs. Pericapsular calcification is often present.
• An erosive polyarthritis favouring the large joints can occur with renal
osteodystrophy in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis. It may relate
to a number of different, or combination of, crystal induced inflammatorybased mechanisms (hydroxyapatite, basic calcium phosphate, pyrophosphate,
urate).
• Hyperparathyroidism is associated with a specific shoulder arthropathy
characterized by intra/periarticular erosions of the humeral head. This may be
sub-clinical.
• Subjective muscle weakness and fatigability are common complaints.
Typically, muscle enzymes are normal and biopsy shows type II fibre atrophy;
the features of an inflammatory myopathy are generally absent.

[SECTION]• The hallmark of radiographic changes is bone resorption: sub-periosteal
(typically on the radial side of second and third phalanges), intracortical,
subchondral, trabecular, sub-ligamentous, and localized (Brown’s tumours)
resorption patterns are seen. Bone sclerosis, periostitis, and chondrocalcinosis
also occur.
• Fragility fracture is common and often precedes a diagnosis of primary
hyperparathyroidism. Although significant and fast accretion of bone occurs
after surgery, bone mass often remains low long term.
Acromegaly
• Over-stimulation of bone and connective tissue cells from excessive growth
hormone can result in several features: bursal and cartilage hyperplasia,
synovial and bony proliferation, an OA-like picture, backache, and
hypermobility.
• Joint complaints usually manifest about 10 years after the onset of clinical
acromegaly. Knees are frequently affected.
• Joint symptoms are not typical of an inflammatory arthritis. Morning stiffness
is not prominent and joint swelling is present in <50%.
• Carpal tunnel syndrome affects >50% and is frequently bilateral.
• Back and neck pain and radicular symptoms from nerve root compression or
spinal stenosis are not uncommon and are related to axial bony proliferation.
• A painless proximal myopathy occurs infrequently.
• Radiographs characteristically show widened joint spaces (e.g. >2.5 mm in
adult MCPJs) and a thickened heel pad (>23 mm in men and >21.5 mm in
women).
• Diagnosis relies on demonstration of a failure of growth hormone to be
suppressed by a glucose tolerance test, but a lateral skull radiograph is a good
screening test as 90% have enlargement of the pituitary fossa.

Gut and hepatobiliary conditions
MSK features frequently occur in patients with gut or hepatobiliary disease
(Table 4.5).
• Data on the frequency of rheumatological features are largely based on studies
of hospital patients with clinically overt gut or biliary disease—leading to an
underestimate of the frequency of association.
• Well-established associations include:
• toxic effects of medications (e.g. NSAIDs; see Chapter 3).
• irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia.

[SECTION]• functional GI motility disorders (e.g. SScl, EDS).
• sacroiliitis, arthritis, and enthesitis in patients with SpA and IBD.
• degenerative arthritis in haemochromatosis and Wilson’s disease.
• The frequency of enthesitis in patients with IBD may be underestimated.
Enthesitis may be detected at the medial/lateral humeral epicondyles, Achilles’
tendon insertion, calcaneal plantar fascia origin and insertion, greater
trochanters, and the patellar tendon origin and its insertion at the tibial
tubercle.
• Radiology studies in patients with IBD suggest that sacroiliitis is underrecognized by clinicians.
Severity of rheumatologic manifestations
• Optimal surveillance strategies for the MSK manifestations of gut or biliary
disease are not known in many instances.
• Faecal calprotectin is a sensitive measure for IBD screening in patients with
SpA, but modest elevations can occur in a number of scenarios.
• Life-threatening vasculitis may occur from chronic viral infection. Hepatitis B
is associated with polyarteritis nodosa, and hepatitis C may lead to
cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis.
• In most patients who develop joint inflammation or enthesitis after bacterial
dysentery, the condition is self-limiting. Chronicity and severity may be linked
to HLA-B27. Progressive spondylitis is rare.
Gut and hepatobiliary conditions in patients with rheumatic diseases
(Tables 4.6 and 4.7; also see Chapter 15, ‘Vasculitis’)
• The most common problem among patients with RA is dyspepsia associated
with gastroduodenal erosions or ulcers due to NSAIDs. Peptic lesions may be
clinically silent and may present with dropping haemoglobin levels or an acute
bleed.
• RA may be the most common cause of AA amyloidosis. Biopsies of the upper
GI tract will demonstrate amyloid deposits in 13% of patients. There are
numerous GI manifestations of amyloidosis, including GI haemorrhage,
malabsorption, obstruction, and hepatosplenomegaly.
• In SLE, serious gut and hepatobiliary manifestations are relatively uncommon
(5%), but nausea, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhoea are quite frequent.
• SScl has numerous GI manifestations including refractory gastro-oesophageal
reflux disease, gastric antral vascular ectasia (‘watermelon stomach’),
oesophageal dysmotility, bacterial over-growth, and faecal incontinence.
• The reflux associated with SScl often requires treatment with high-dose proton

[SECTION]•

•

pump inhibitors.
‘Watermelon stomach’ can lead to significant acute and chronic haemorrhage.
In SScl, bloating and abdominal distension caused by bacterial overgrowth
may respond to cyclic courses of antibiotics.
Mesenteric vasculitis is classically caused by polyarteritis nodosa, but can be
seen with a variety of rheumatic illnesses, including Takayasu arteritis, AAV,
and (rarely) with SLE. Although mesenteric angina is the symptom most
strongly associated with mesenteric vasculitis, the earliest sign of intestinal
ischaemia is diarrhoea.
HSP is an IgA-mediated small vessel vasculitis that presents with colicky
abdominal pain and purpura (adults and children). Although generally mild
and self-limited in children, it can occasionally cause intussusception and
bowel necrosis.

Gut and hepatobiliary side effects from drugs used in treating rheumatic
and bone diseases
(See also Chapter 23.)
The main rheumatology drugs causing side effects are:
• NSAIDs—which are a common cause of GI distress. COX-2 inhibitors were
developed to decrease the risk of peptic ulcer disease; most have been
withdrawn from the market due to concerns regarding increased risk of
cardiovascular events and those remaining may be no more effective than
taking a conventional NSAID with a proton pump inhibitor.
• Glucocorticoids may cause gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and GI haemorrhage.
Although the absolute increase in events is small, the combination of steroids
and NSAIDs results in a synergistic increase in the risk of GI sequelae.
• Methotrexate (MTX) may cause stomatitis, which may respond to
supplemental folate. Nausea, emesis, and dysgeusia may respond to dose
reduction. MTX can cause a transaminitis; it is therefore recommended that
patients minimize alcohol intake.
• Sulfasalazine gut and hepatobiliary side effects are common and may occur in
up to 20% of patients. The most frequent are mild: indigestion, nausea,
vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Gut ulceration, bloody diarrhoea and
serious liver problems are rare; in 65% of patients, side effects occur in the

[SECTION]•

first 3 months of treatment.
Azathioprine (AZA) can cause nausea (15%), vomiting (10%), and abdominal
pain (8%). Diarrhoea is rare (5%). Liver enzyme abnormalities are often mild
and may remit on lowering the dose. The GI side effects can occur in patients
with normal levels of thiopurine methyltransferase.
Penicillamine causes altered taste (25% within the first 3–6 months), nausea or
vomiting (18%), and stomatitis/mouth ulcers (5%). Hepatotoxicity and
haemorrhagic colitis are rare.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause non-specific GI intolerance
(10%). The onset is often insidious.
Ciclosporin causes gingival hyperplasia, nausea, diarrhoea, and elevation in
hepatic enzymes.
Effects of cyclophosphamide on the gut are frequent: nausea, vomiting,
diarrhoea, and stomatitis. Serious hepatotoxicity is rare.
Leflunomide can cause nausea (8–13%), diarrhoea (up to 25%), and abnormal
liver enzymes. In studies, most rises in transaminases have been mild (<2-fold)
and are reversible on drug withdrawal.
Oral bisphosphonates (such as alendronic acid and risedronate) and strontium
ranelate can cause nausea, dyspepsia, and diarrhoea. Oesophageal ulceration
has occasionally been noted with alendronate, although it is thought this
occurs only in people who do not follow the instructions for taking them.
Myalgias and arthralgias can also occur with bisphosphonates.
Calcitonin either given as subcutaneous injection or as nasal spray can give
abdominal pains and diarrhoea.

Malignancy
Rheumatic MSK features may be clues to the existence of cancer. Symptoms
may arise directly from neoplastic tissue invasion or indirectly as a
paraneoplastic phenomenon.
Primary and secondary neoplastic diseases of bone and joints
• Synovial tumours are rare. Sarcoma (synovioma) is more common in men than
women and unusual in those >60 years. It usually occurs in the legs (70%) and
can occur around tendon sheaths and bursa. At diagnosis, pulmonary
metastases are common.
• Para-articular involvement by bone tumours may give a monoarticular
effusion. Invasion of synovium may occur and malignant cells can be detected
in joint fluid. Breast, bronchogenic carcinoma, GI tumours, and melanoma can

all metastasize to joints.
Lymphomas and leukaemias may simulate various conditions especially in
children and cause synovitis in a single or in multiple joints.
Arthritis complicating the presentation of myeloma or an acute leukaemia is
most likely to be polyarticular and asymmetric.
In adults, arthritis complicating leukaemia is rare (5% of cases).
Leukaemia is the most common cause of neoplastic skeletal symptoms in
childhood and adolescence (15% of leukaemia cases).
Neuroblastomas are the most frequent cause of a solid tumour metastasizing to
the skeleton in children.

Clues that may lead to a suspicion of malignancy directly causing MSK
symptoms
• Constitutional symptoms without evidence for vasculitis.
• The coexistence of bone pain from metastases (see Plate 16). Also, consider
metabolic bone diseases, sarcoid, SAPHO syndrome, and the SpA conditions.
• Haemorrhagic

(also
consider
trauma,
PVNS,
chondrocalcinosis/pseudogout).
• Radiographs that show adjacent bone destruction, perhaps with loss of cortex
(also consider infection).
• Radiographic calcification in soft tissue mass (consider synovioma).
Paraneoplastic idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM)
• IIMs may be due to carcinomatous neuromyopathy.
• Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, Eaton–Lambert myasthenic syndrome
(ELMS), and hypophosphataemic (oncogenic) osteomalacia are all found in
association with malignancy (Table 4.8).
• Carcinomatous neuromyopathy is characterized by symmetric muscle
weakness and wasting and can pre-date the malignancy.

Non-myopathy paraneoplastic syndromes
• The non-myopathic paraneoplastic syndromes are rare.
• Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy consists of clubbing, periostitis of
diaphysis of long bones, and an arthropathy (varies from arthralgias to diffuse
polyarthritis). Suspicion of HPOA should be investigated with bone
scintigraphy, which typically shows increased radionuclide uptake in affected
bones. Radiographs often show periosteal elevation.
• HPOA complicates 20% of primary lung tumours, but it is associated with
other malignancies.
• Polyarthritis may be the presenting feature of cancer. Most cases occur >60
years old. The arthritis associated with malignancy tends to be asymmetric,
and does not cause erosions.
• Eosinophilic fasciitis, severe bilateral palmar fasciitis (often mistaken for
scleroderma), and fasciitis associated with panniculitis have been associated

[SECTION]with malignancy.
• Cases of ‘shoulder–hand’ syndrome (a form of osteodystrophy; see
22) have been reported in association with malignancy.

Chapter

Rheumatological diseases associated with an increased incidence of
malignancy
A number of rheumatic MSK diseases are associated with an increased incidence
of malignancy compared with healthy populations.
• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is most strongly associated with RA. Myeloma and
paraproteinaemia are also found in RA patients.
• The relative risk of colon cancer among RA patients is 0.77; this may be due to
the use of chronic NSAIDs in this patient population, which may be protective.
• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma develops in a subset of patients with Sjögren’s
syndrome (4%). Its onset may be indicated by rapid enlargement of salivary
glands, the appearance of a paraprotein, or decrease in circulating
immunoglobulins or RF titre.
• SScl has been associated with an increased risk of both lung cancer and nonHodgkin’s lymphoma.
• Dermatomyositis is probably associated with malignancy in adults, though as
convincing evidence for an association of polymyositis with malignancy is
lacking. Gonadal tumours are relatively common among such patients.
• Eosinophilic fasciitis may be associated with malignancy.
Rheumatological drugs and malignancy
(See also Chapter 23.)
• Chronic azathioprine use is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer so
patients taking azathioprine long term should be counselled regarding sun
protection and monitoring for skin cancer.
• Use of cyclophosphamide is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma
and bladder cancer.
• Anti-TNFα drug therapy is theoretically associated with a risk of malignancy.
However, patient disease registries have not identified an excess incidence in
patients treated long-term with the therapy.
• If malignancy develops while a patient is taking anti-TNFα then usually its
correct to stop the therapy.
• There is incomplete data on whether starting anti-TNFα increases the risk of
relapse of malignancy in patients previously treated successfully for their
cancer.
• Though very high dose per weight teriparatide is associated with sarcoma

[SECTION]development in rats, there is no evidence, at doses used in humans, that there
is an increased risk.
• The following have not been associated with an increased risk of malignancy
(as of 2016): sulfasalazine, leflunomide, rituximab, abatacept, apremilast,
ustekinumab, secukinumab, belimumab, and denosumab.

Neurological conditions
Entrapment neuropathies and radicular lesions are discussed in
Also, radiculopathy is included in Chapter 21.

Chapter 3.

Inflammatory peripheral neuropathy
• Inflammatory neuropathies can occur as part of any AICTD, though are
probably most likely to occur in association with SLE and Sjögren’s
syndrome.
• Vasculitis (and probably APS) can cause small vessel vascular lesions which
compromise peripheral nerve function and cause sensory, and if severe, motor
features of nerve damage.
• Nerve conduction studies may form part of the investigations at the outset of
characterizing systemic vasculitis and severe AICTDs.
• Mononeuritis occurring as part of RA is possible but nowadays is very
unlikely unless severe RA disease is left untreated.
Entrapment neuropathies
• Entrapment neuropathies are common in rheumatological practice. Symptoms
arising from these lesions include paraesthesiae, a feeling of swelling,
numbness and a burning quality to pain in the distribution of the trapped nerve.
• Median nerve irritation/entrapment may be secondary to carpal OA or
inflammation secondary to inflammatory arthritis.
• Ulnar nerve irritation (fourth and fifth finger territory symptoms) is most
commonly associated with medial elbow lesions.
Spinal cord lesions
Spinal cord lesions usually arise due to intrinsic spinal canal or extrinsic
compression or inflammation.
• Tumours and ischaemic spinal cord lesions often present acutely with upper
motor neuron features distal to the affected level and issues of bladder and
bowel sphincter control.
• Some tumours and syrinxes (thoracic, neck) can cause subacute evolution of
pyramidal features in the legs (often not pain but stiffness and motor function

[SECTION]problems).
• Extrinsic cord compression can occur secondary to tumours, osteoporotic
vertebral and a combination of (usually degenerative) lesions. In the latter,
spinal cord compression is rarely acute and because it evolves very slowly is
often overlooked in the elderly.
• Transverse myelitis causes acute focal back pain and distal spinal cord
symptoms and features including acute lower limb motor symptoms. It is a
feature of SLE and APS.
Cerebrovascular lesions
• Acute cerebellar or stroke-like symptoms can be a presenting feature of
ischaemic lesions secondary to APS. If occurring in the non-elderly <60 years
then screening for APS and SLE is mandatory.
• Cerebral lupus can be present with profound symptoms of confusion and brain
function decompensation or may be subtler presenting with mild cognitive or
frontal cortex dysfunction.
• Conventional stroke disease is a complication of many inflammatory
rheumatic diseases, probably most associated with APS and ongoing poorly
controlled inflammatory disease and in the context of other risk factors (e.g.
smoking, metabolic syndrome in PsA, glucocorticoid-associated
hyperlipidaemia).
Headache
• Among the causes of headache in rheumatological practice, neurological
causes are probably rare.
• The hemicranial headache (with scalp sensitivity) of GCA and drug-induced
headache are the most likely causes of headache encountered in rheumatology
patients.
• Other causes of headache occasionally encountered are the global headache
from cranial sinus thrombosis in Behçet’s disease, and meningeal lesions (e.g.
in neurosarcoid).
Neuromyopathy
• Neuromyopathies may present to rheumatologists with focal pain or
generalized pain and weakness.
• Focal neuromyopathies can occur after nerve trauma or infection. Marked
acute wasting with pain, often with raised CK and a myositis-type signal on
MRI, can be seen.
• Fluctuating neuromyopathic effects can occur in myasthenia gravis. There may
be a variation of effects over a day with muscle fatigue influencing the timing,

[SECTION]characteristics, and severity of weakness. Symptoms can be focal—as in
orbital muscle myasthenia, which can present initially with diplopia—or
general involving larger muscle groups.

Ophthalmic conditions
Blepharitis, conjunctivitis, uveitis, and ischaemic lesions can all occur with
rheumatic MSK diseases.
Dry eye (xerophthalmia)
• Xerophthalmia often presents with sore or gritty eyes and sensitivity in certain
atmospheric environments (e.g. air-conditioning). Oddly patients can get
epiphorae if tear film is not drained because of inferior orbital duct blockage
through to the sinuses.
• Blepharitis is often a consequence of dry eye—lids can get ‘sticky’.
• Xerophthalmia is most severe in primary Sjögren’s syndrome but can occur in
SOX syndrome and all autoimmune joint and connective tissue diseases
(secondary Sjögren’s syndrome).
Uveitis
• Anterior uveitis can be acute or chronic. Symptoms include ocular pain and
photophobia. The eye becomes visibly erythematous.
• The most common associations of anterior uveitis include SpAs, sarcoid,
Behçet’s disease, and JIA.
• All children and adolescents diagnosed with any form of JIA, regardless of
ANA status, should have an eye examination to rule out uveitis.
Ischaemic ophthalmic lesions
• Retinal examination is the most direct and accessible way to visualize blood
vessels in vivo.
• Ophthalmic examination is valuable in the assessment of systemic vasculitis.
• The input of an experienced medical ophthalmologist is essential in
departments that offer a service to manage vasculitis patients.
• The ischaemic lesions of GCA can present variably but most typically with
amaurosis symptoms (visual field curtaining).
Scleral and corneal disease
• Lesions of the sclera and cornea are rare in rheumatology patients except in
severe (usually high-titre seropositive) RA patients.
• Scleral or corneal disease in an RA patient should prompt consideration of the

[SECTION]presence of systemic RA vasculitis.
Other
• Proptosis is a recognized feature of AAV and is usually due to granulomatous
inflammation in the retro-orbital space.
• Conjunctivitis can accompany many diseases but is an acute lesion in some
cases of (SpA-associated) reactive arthritis.
• Ophthalmoplegia is a recognized presenting feature of mononeuritis associated
with systemic vasculitis. Cerebrovascular disease (thus APS and GCA also)
should be considered as possible in relevant patients also.

Introduction
Epidemiology
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory arthritis, with an
incidence in the general UK population of 1.5 and 3.6 per 10,000 people per
year, for male and females respectively.
• RA affects people worldwide and affects females more frequently than males,
with a F:M ratio of ~3:1.
• RA most commonly occurs at age 45–65 years although it can occur at any age
—occurring as a distinct disease in childhood.
Classification
The updated ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria (Table 5.1) have been
designed to identify early RA. However, they should not be used to exclude the
diagnosis if all criteria are not met; clinical judgement should be used.
Pathogenesis
RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disease, manifest primarily in synovial
tissues, mediated by interaction between T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and
synovial fibroblasts, leading to dysregulation of the inflammatory cascade.
• Smoking increases the risk of developing RA.
• Familial RA does exist but the odds ratio of developing RA if there is a firstdegree relative with the disease is only 1.1.

[SECTION]Immunopathology
Overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, in particular tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), is central to the pathology of RA.
• Persistent inflammation leads to increased vascularity and inflammation of the
synovial lining of joints (synovitis), and secondary cartilage degradation (joint
space narrowing) and bone erosion.
• Autoantibodies are seen in 50–80% of RA cases, in particular rheumatoid
factor (RF) and anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA).
• The sensitivity and specificity of ACPA for identifying RA is greater than that
of RF (67% and 95% for ACPA vs 69% and 85% for RF, respectively).1
• Positivity for both RF and ACPA has a near 100% positive predictive value for
subsequent development of RA.
• Genetics also contribute to the risk of developing RA. HLA-DRB1 is most
commonly associated with RA, and is often referred to as the ‘shared epitope’.

Synovial pathology
The exact reason why synovium is targeted is unknown. Synovium in joints and
tendons becomes inflamed and local tissue damage of cartilage, bone, and
surrounding tissues ensues.
• There is increased synovial vascularity, influx of monocytes and plasma cells,
and activation of tissue macrophages and fibroblasts.
• Synovial plasma cells are numerous and produce antibodies which will have a
proinflammatory local effect.
• Cellular activation of cytokines locally results in bone resorption activating
osteoclasts causing bone erosion.
• In severe cases, cellular aggregation can lead to lymphoid follicles forming in
the synovial tissue.
• Extra-synovial inflammation includes rheumatoid nodule formation and
inflammation of lung and cardiac tissue.

RA. Ann Intern Med 2007;146:797–808.

[SECTION]Clinical features
RA is characterized by swelling, pain, and stiffness of synovial joints, systemic
features, and involvement of extra-articular organs and tissue.
Joints and tendons
RA typically affects the small joints of the hands and feet, but can affect any
joint (bursa or tendon) where there is synovial tissue (e.g. elbows, shoulders,
ankles, knees, hips, and TMJs).
• Symptoms characteristically include stiffness worse in the morning, and lasts
for >30 min.
• Joint symptoms develop over weeks, but can also do so over a few days.
Occasionally symptoms can have a migratory onset over months, with
temporary periods of resolution/improvement.
• Movement of the affected joints often alleviates stiffness and discomfort in the
early stages of the disease.
• Active movement of an inflamed joint can cause ‘gelling’ where the patient
describes an abrupt momentary ‘paralysis’ of movement.
• The functional impact of joint symptoms should be assessed. The Health
Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) is helpful to provide a standardized
assessment of disability.
• Examination should focus on any affected joints, assessing for the degree of
swelling, warmth, and range of movement.
• Joint or tendon synovitis may not be detectable clinically in the early/mild
stages of disease. Boggy swelling over the joint line is indicative of joint
synovitis. Ballotable joint effusions can be present if larger joints are involved.
• In the early stages of the disease, deformities are not seen; however, in
aggressive, longstanding, or untreated disease, deformity can occur and lead to
significant disability.
• Deformities seen in RA include:
• ulnar deviation at the wrist, often accompanied by a depressible prominent
ulna styloid (piano-key sign).
• swan-neck and boutonniere deformities may be identified in the fingers in
advanced disease.
• fixed loss of extension deformities.
• limited shoulder movement, due to joint erosion, effusion, or ligament
rupture.
• lateral deviation of the toes.
• subluxation of the metatarsal heads leads to discomfort when walking.

Callosities, skin degradation, soft tissue infection, and osteomyelitis may
ensue.
At the atlanto-axial joint, erosion of the odontoid can lead to an unstable C1–
C2 articulation, with potentially life-threatening consequences from cord or
brainstem compression.
Symptoms of atlanto-axial joint involvement can include occipital pain,
syncope, and headaches.
The consequences of small cervical facet joint involvement can be upper limb
radicular symptoms and hand weakness, and if the spinal cord is affected,
stiffness (including of legs).
The differential of lower cervical radiculopathy is carpal tunnel syndrome—
also a secondary lesion in RA from wrist joint disease.

Extra-articular features
• Rheumatoid nodules are associated with seropositivity (RF and ACPA) and
can occur anywhere in the body, but are most commonly found on the hands,
feet, and elbows. When a small mass/nodule is identified in any internal organ
in a RA patient, cancer must be excluded before attributing the lesion to a
rheumatoid nodule.
• RA is associated with pulmonary fibrosis, exudative pleural effusions, and
pleurisy.
• Splenomegaly is common, and may be part of Felty’s syndrome (RA,
neutropenia, and splenomegaly).
• Lymphadenopathy can be due to RA but patients also have a greater likelihood
of developing lymphoma compared to the general population, so investigation
of ‘B symptoms’ is very important.
• Neurological examination may reveal nerve impingement due to synovitis,
tenosynovitis (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome), joint damage, or bony
impingement (e.g. spinal nerve root impingement).
• Rheumatoid vasculitis can present as a mononeuritis multiplex.
• Leucocytoclastic rashes are rare but may cause skin ulceration.
• The most common ophthalmic manifestation is dry eyes (sicca).
• Painful scleritis, leading to scleromalacia, is a serious sight-threatening
condition. Scleral thinning may manifest as a darkening of the sclera, and
requires urgent ophthalmic input.
Systemic features and assessment
• Fatigue is often a prominent symptom and is challenging to manage.
• Disease activity should be assessed using a standardized clinical outcome

[SECTION]measure at each clinical review. The most commonly used measure is the
Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28).
• Other disease activity measures include the Clinical Disease Activity Index
(CDAI), and the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI).
Associated clinical manifestations
• Patients with RA have an increased risk of developing septic arthritis due to
pre-existing joint damage and use of immunosuppressants.
• Active RA commonly is associated with muscle atrophy, primarily due to
reduced use, but also due to systemic inflammation.
• Osteoporosis is more common in RA than the general population, due to
systemic inflammation, reduced mobility, and steroids.
• Osteoporosis risk should be assessed in patients >40 years using FRAX® (
http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX) and in postmenopausal women and men >50
years using FRAX® and DXA scanning.
• Patients with RA have an increased cardio- and cerebrovascular risk profile
due to chronic inflammation promoting atherosclerosis. Active risk
management is important.
• Secondary amyloidosis is increasingly uncommon, but should be considered in
patients with long-standing active disease.

Investigations
RA is primarily a clinical diagnosis. However, a set of baseline investigations
can assist in making the diagnosis, and provide a point of reference for
monitoring disease progression, drug response, and toxicity.
• Laboratory tests should be done to aid diagnosis, as a baseline before and
when monitoring disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; Table
5.2).
• Imaging can confirm a clinical diagnosis and characterize synovitis in joints
and tendons, evaluate joint and bone damage from joint inflammation, and can
help exclude alternative diagnoses (Table 5.3).
• Key to diagnosis is detection of ACPA and RF. ACPA are as sensitive for
diagnosis of RA as RF but are more specific.

Management
General considerations
Intensive target-driven treatment of RA, aiming for disease remission, is
recommended.2, 3 All patients with RA should have access to regular meetings
with a rheumatologist. Patient involvement and shared decision-making is
essential in treatment planning. For example, for a guide to RA management by

[SECTION]auditable standards, see NICE Clinical Guideline 79.2
• Remission is defined depending on the disease activity score used (e.g. <2.6
using DAS28).
• Early institution of DMARD therapy, usually with conventional synthetic
DMARDs (csDMARDs) initially before the onset of joint damage, is essential
(see Chapter 23 for DMARD nomenclature).
• A ‘treat-to-target approach’ has been shown to improve outcomes in RA and
involves setting a realistic treatment target (e.g. remission) with the patient and
escalating treatment until the goal is reached. This approach can be intensive
and requires frequent patient meetings or contacts to assess treatment response
until the target is achieved.
• While remission is an appropriate target in early disease, patients with longstanding disease may require a more pragmatic target, such as low disease
activity.
• A multidisciplinary approach is essential when managing RA:
• Early and regular specialist practitioner consults can help both disease and
medicines management, as well as self-management through education and
a deeper understanding of the patient of their RA.
• Early referral to physiotherapy and occupational therapy is recommended to
advise patients on appropriate exercises to maximize joint movement,
function, and strength.
• Living aids, pacing, coping skills, and self-management of disease activity
flares/fatigue can also be learned through therapy and practitioner input.
• Early institution of strategies to help patients to continue to participate in
work and social activities is essential to maintaining a good quality of life
for individuals with RA.
• Podiatric or foot orthotics input can be helpful to alleviate foot symptoms
and deformity.
• RA can lead to problems with low mood and depression so screening for
psychological dysfunction and referral for specialist input is very important.
• Patients with RA have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular disease. An annual review and management of risk factors is
therefore mandatory.

management of RA *This summarizes UK (NHS care) NICE guidelines. Local/regional guidelines may
vary. Guidelines adapted from NICE https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg79.

General pain-relieving measures and analgesia
Analgesia can help manage symptoms while csDMARD and/or biologic
DMARD therapy (bDMARD) takes effect, and to treat flares of disease activity.
• Paracetamol and/or weak opiates (or in combination) will reduce pain and can
be well tolerated.
• Concomitant NSAIDs (preferentially selective COX-2 inhibitors are invariably
effective though they are tolerated variably.
• NSAIDs should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest

[SECTION]time possible.
• A proton pump inhibitor to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and
to reduce GORD symptoms should be considered, especially in patient aged
>65 years, or with a history of GI disease.
• When choosing a NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor, consider a patient’s individual risk
factors, and choose a drug which least increases these risks. Patients should be
counselled about the possible cardiorenal, GI, and liver side effects.
• Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be a helpful measure
to manage local/regional pain, and poses few side effects. Broken skin and
areas with reduced sensation (i.e. diabetic neuropathy) should be avoided.
Synthetic DMARD medications (sDMARDs)
For a more detailed discussion, see Chapter 23.
RA immunotherapeutics need planning with each patient. Objectives and a
time-frame for achieving objective should be set by agreement. There needs to
be a baseline safety assessment (Box 5.1) and careful monitoring of disease
activity, any disability, comorbidity, and drug effects (Box 5.2).
• Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line conventional sDMARD of choice.
sDMARD doses should be escalated rapidly if tolerated.
• All sDMARDs and bDMARDs have a variable time to onset of efficacy,
between 3 and 6 months.
• Combination therapy (>1 sDMARD), ideally including MTX, is recommended
if tolerated.
• There is good quality evidence that using low-dose GC therapy during the first
6 months (e.g. ‘COBRA-lite’ 30 mg prednisolone daily initially), in order to
achieve early disease control, reduces long-term structural joint damage.
• Once disease control is achieved, GCs should be tapered and stopped as
quickly as possible.
• Intra-articular (IA) GC injections can be efficacious for particularly swollen
joints. IM and IV GCs can be helpful to manage flares of joint pain/disease
activity.
• If combination sDMARD therapy is ineffective, early escalation to biological
therapy should be considered.
• MTX should be co-prescribed with biologic therapy (particularly with antiTNFα) where possible, as it improves anti-TNFα response and persistence.
• If first-line biologic therapy is inefficacious, switching to another biological
agent is recommended.
Box 5.1 Investigations and assessments to consider before starting

[SECTION]sDMARDs for RA
Height, weight, blood pressure
Some sDMARDs cause ↑ blood pressure, so a baseline measure is required.
Height and weight are required for drugs prescribed by (‘ideal’) bodyweight.
Laboratory tests and imaging
See Table 5.2 and Table 5.3, respectively.
Comorbidities
Review comorbidities, especially any respiratory, hepatic, or renal conditions
that may affect sDMARD choice. Consider screening for occult viral infection
(such as hepatitis/HIV).
Pregnancy, fertility and breastfeeding
Discuss current and future plans for pregnancy and breastfeeding and tailor
treatment accordingly.
Vaccinations
Vaccinations against pneumococcus and influenza before starting sDMARDs
or biologics are recommended. Live vaccines are not recommended (except
with hydroxychloroquine or SSZ). The shingles vaccine is a live vaccine and
evidence is limited on the use in immunocompromised individuals. Local
recommendations and clinician discretion should guide decisions. Prior to
commencing anti-TNFα, hepatitis B vaccination should be considered in atrisk individuals.
Data from Ledingham J et al. BSR and BHPR guideline for the prescription and monitoring of nonbiologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Rheumatology 2017;56(6):865–8.

Methotrexate (MTX)
• Once-weekly oral preparation, or subcutaneous (SC) injection. Folic acid coprescription, often the day after MTX administration.
• Therapeutic range is approximately 10–25 mg weekly and time to therapeutic
effect: 8–12 weeks.
• Toxicity (stomatitis, GI disturbance, dysphoria-lassitude effects, and alopecia)
may be addressed by the addition of folic acid daily (apart from day of MTX
dosing).
• SC administration is a useful option if oral treatment is not tolerated. There is
some evidence of improved efficacy with SC compared with oral
administration, due to the higher bioavailability.
• Mild drug-induced hepatitis is relatively common and is often corrected by the

[SECTION]•

•
•
•

addition of folic acid. Routine liver biopsy is not necessary, but can be helpful
in patients with other liver disease or persistent low-grade liver function
abnormalities.
Liver function abnormalities fluctuate and may require the drug to be stopped
for a short period if transaminase levels rise above 2–3 times the upper limit of
normal, with re-introduction after a period of time when levels have
normalized, with close monitoring.
Myelosuppression is rarely severe. Antifolate drugs such as trimethoprim and
folate deficiency increase the risk of toxicity.
Renal impairment reduces MTX clearance and may lead to toxicity.
Concomitant NSAID use is not contraindicated, but monitoring for
hepatotoxicity is recommended.

Sulfasalazine (SSZ)
• Daily oral preparation. Therapeutic range 1.5–3 g daily in twice-daily doses.
• Time to therapeutic effect: 12 weeks.
• Toxicity: may cause leucopenia, pancytopenia, haemolysis, aplastic anaemia,
and hepatic transaminitis. Bone marrow toxicity unusual.
• SSZ can rarely cause a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by LFT
abnormalities, lymphadenopathy, and rash.
• Spermatogenesis and libido can be affected by SSZ, but it is reversible. No
apparent adverse effect on female fertility.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)
• Daily oral preparation with usual therapeutic dose 200 mg twice daily.
• Time to therapeutic effect: about 12 weeks.
• Retinal toxicity and maculopathy are rare. The risk increases with abnormal
liver or kidney function; after a cumulative dose >1000 g; and treatment
duration >5–7 years.
Leflunomide (LFN)
• Daily oral preparation. Therapeutic dose 20 mg daily.
• Time to therapeutic effect: 12 weeks
• LFN is an inhibitor of the enzyme dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase and shows
antiproliferative activity, inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis. It has a long half-life
of 2 weeks.
• Initially, it was administered with a loading dose of 100 mg daily for 3 days
followed by maintenance therapy with 10–20 mg daily. The loading dose was
associated with diarrhoea in many patients, and clinicians now use
maintenance therapy dose from the start.

[SECTION]• Side effects include myelosuppression, elevation of liver transaminases,
diarrhoea, and hypertension. Severe hepatitis is uncommon and usually occurs
in the first 6 months of treatment.
• The long half-life has implications for drug withdrawal. If rapid washout is
required, cholestyramine for between 14 days to 6 weeks should be prescribed,
followed by two blood tests to ensure drug levels are below 0.02 mg/L.
Azathioprine (AZA)
• Daily oral preparation dose range 2–2.5 mg/kg/day in twice-daily or three
times a day doses.
• Time to therapeutic effect: 12 weeks.
• Infrequently used for RA as therapeutic effect relatively weak.
• Toxicity: may cause leucopenia, pancytopenia, haemolysis, and aplastic
anaemia; especially in individuals with low/absent thiopurine
methyltransferase (TPMT) activity. AZA should not be prescribed for patients
with ‘low-activity’-associated TPMT alleles.
Gold (myocrisin)
• IM preparation with loading doses then usually 50 mg monthly.
• Time to therapeutic effect: variable.
• Infrequently used for RA nowadays (and auranofin, the oral gold salt
preparation, is even less seldom used).
• Toxicity: hypersensitivity to injections, permanent blue/grey skin
discoloration, renal and liver dysfunction can occur uncommonly.
Glucocorticoids (GCs)
• Oral, IM, IV, or IA use.
• Time to therapeutic effect: depends on the mode of administration; hours/days.
• IM and oral GCs can be very effective to manage flares and as a bridge to
sDMARDs taking effect.
• IA injections are of value in symptom control, in both early disease and flares.
However, their effect is transient, with little impact on the overall process of
RA, and should not be repeated any more than 3-monthly.
• Caution should be exercised if considering IA injection in anticoagulated
patients as the risk of haemarthrosis is increased.
• There is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of joint infection, as long as
an aseptic technique is used.
• Long-term systemic GCs can have sequelae, including cataracts, premature
coronary artery disease, osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, insulin
resistance/diabetes, and osteonecrosis. Appropriate fracture prevention therapy

[SECTION]should be given to patients expected to be on glucocorticoid therapy for >6
weeks at a dose ≥7.5 mg.
Box 5.2 Managing and monitoring sDMARDs: British Society for
Rheumatology UK recommendations
Methotrexate (MTX)
Co-prescribed with weekly folic acid (e.g. 5 mg/day after MTX).
Teratogenic. Not safe in breastfeeding. Advise low alcohol intake. Rarely
causes pneumonitis (caution with pre-existing lung disease/poor respiratory
reserve). Rarely causes myelosuppression.
Monitoring: FBC, Cr/GFR, ALT, albumin all 2-weekly until dose/results
stable then monthly for 3 months then 3-monthly thereafter.
Sulfasalazine (SSZ)
GI side effects early in treatment course generally mild and do often subside.
Very rarely causes leucopenia, pancytopenia, haemolysis, and aplastic
anaemia in early treatment. Reduced potency in men.
Monitoring: FBC, Cr, ALT, albumin all 2-weekly until dose/results stable,
then monthly for 3 months, then 3-monthly until 12 months and no routine
monitoring required thereafter.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)
Cumulative dose should not exceed 6.5 mg/kg of body weight.
Monitoring: no routine lab monitoring required. Eye screening within 1
year of starting and then annually if on drug for >5 years.
Leflunomide (LEF)
Diarrhoea relatively common side effect. Can cause hypertension so avoid if
BP uncontrolled. Not recommended in pregnancy or breastfeeding. Long halflife drug and requires active washout if there is severe toxicity (e.g. 10-day
cholestyramine). Rarely causes pneumonitis.
Monitoring: FBC, Cr, ALT, albumin: all 2-weekly until dose/results stable
then monthly for 3 months then 3-monthly thereafter. BP monthly.
Azathioprine (AZA)
Assess thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype before treatment. If
likely absent TPMT activity do not prescribe AZA. Avoid co-prescription with
allopurinol (blocks excretion of AZA). GI disturbance relatively common but
often mild. Relatively safe in pregnancy.
Monitoring: FBC, Cr, ALT, albumin: 2-weekly until dose/results stable,

[SECTION]then monthly for 3 months then 3-monthly thereafter.
IM gold
Can cause bone marrow and liver disturbance. Contraindicated in
pregnancy/breastfeeding. Rarely: hypersensitivity reactions from injections.
Long-term treatment can cause chrysiasis (grey/blue skin pigmentation).
Monitoring: FBC, Cr, ALT, albumin: all 2-weekly until dose/results stable
then monthly for 3 months then 3-monthly thereafter. Urinalysis for blood and
protein prior to each dose.
Data from Ledingham J et al. BSR and BHPR guideline for the prescription and monitoring of nonbiologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Rheumatology 2017;56(6):865–8.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor α therapy (anti-TNFα)
Baseline assessment is advisable (Box 5.1 and Box 5.3).
• Given SC (e.g. etanercept, adalimumab) or IV (e.g. infliximab).
• Time to effect: 2–24 weeks.
• TNFα is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine whose levels are elevated in RA.
• Anti-TNFα therapies are available as originator or biosimilar drugs—mainly
either monoclonal antibodies or receptor fusion proteins (infliximab,
etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab).
• Common adverse effects include infection, headache, nausea, and injectionsite reactions, and increased risk of infection.
• Rarely can trigger a (ANA-positive) lupus-like syndrome responsive to
therapy withdrawal.
• Very rarely can cause demyelination.
• Withdraw if cardiac failure worsens.
• Consider withdrawal if interstitial lung disease develops or worsens.
• Can cause psoriasis when used to treat RA and even worsens psoriasis in PsA
patients (‘paradoxical psoriasis’). This is a class effect and will re-occur if an
alternative anti-TNFα is tried.
• Antibodies can develop versus the therapeutic antibody/fusion protein. Such
antibodies can be detected by specific immunoassays. MTX therapy may
reduce anti-anti-TNFα drug antibody formation.
B-cell depletion (anti-CD20): rituximab (RTX)
Baseline assessment is advisable (Box 5.1 and Box 5.3).
• Given IV. A dose consists of 1g given twice by infusions given 2 weeks apart.
Most rheumatologists advocate a minimum of 6 months between subsequent
doses, but often required less frequently. Usually co-administered with IV

[SECTION]•

•

GCs.
Time to therapeutic effect: 12–24 weeks.
B cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA and administration of
rituximab leads to rapid CD20 positive B-cell depletion in the peripheral
blood. Normal B-cell repopulation occurs within the next 3 months.
The best responses are seen in RF-seropositive patients, and when coprescribed with MTX. If patients are unable to take MTX then consider LFN
or RTX monotherapy.
RTX is contraindicated if there is hypogammaglobulinaemia.
Very rarely causes progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy.

CTLA4-Ig: abatacept (ABA)
Baseline assessment is advisable (Box 5.1 and Box 5.3).
• Given SC (125 mg weekly) or IV (maintenance dose every 4 weeks according
to weight).
• Time to effect: 12–24 weeks.
• Abatacept disrupts the CD80/86 co-stimulatory signal required for T-cell
activation by competing with CD28 for binding.
• Co-prescription with MTX is advisable.
Box 5.3 Investigations and considerations before starting biologic therapy
TB infection
All patients should be screened (history, CXR, T-spot/IgRA test) for presence
of active or latent mycobacterial infections and treated according to current
guidelines before starting biologic therapy.
Hepatitis
Screen all patients starting a biologic for hepatitis B and C. Increased risk of
infusion reactions in patients with hepatitis C treated with RTX.
HIV
A thorough history is required and if any risk factors are present, HIV testing
should be undertaken.
Malignancy
See ‘RA-associated cancer risk’, p. 260.
ANA testing
Anti-TNFα therapy has been associated with development of lupus-like
syndrome in rare cases. Obtain a baseline test of ANA.

[SECTION]Demyelination (including optic neuritis)
Anti-TNFα therapy has been associated with demyelination, and it should not
be prescribed to patients with a history of demyelination.
Cardiac failure
Anti-TNFα is not recommended with NYHA grade 3/4 cardiac failure.
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
There is mixed evidence on the association of anti-TNFα therapy and ILD.
Monitoring lung function should be considered.
Uveitis
Anti-TNFα should be used cautiously in patients with pre-existing uveitis.
Some studies have identified an increased risk of uveitis.
Fasting lipids
Patients starting on tocilizumab (TCZ) should have a baseline fasting lipid
profile. A repeat profile is recommended after 3 months of treatment. If
worsening lipid level, consider reviewing treatment. Ongoing monitoring
should be in line with local guidelines and individual risk factors.
Immunoglobulins
Immunoglobulins should be checked in patients starting RTX, 4–6 months
after an infusion, and before each treatment. There’s an increased risk of
infection with IgG <6 g/L.
ANA, antinuclear antibodies; NYHA, New York Heart Association; RTX, rituximab.
Information summarized from Ding T, et al. BSR and BHPR rheumatoid arthritis guidelines on safety of
anti-TNF therapies. Rheumatology 2010;49:2217–9.

Anti-interleukin-6 receptor blocker: tocilizumab (TCZ)
Baseline assessment is advisable (Box 5.1 and Box 5.3).
• Given SC (162 mg weekly) or IV (8 mg/kg every 4 weeks).
• Time to effect: 12–24 weeks.
• IL-6 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine. High levels have been found in
serum and synovial fluid of RA patients, and levels correlate with disease
activity.
• Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble (sIL-6R) and membrane-bound
IL-6 receptors (mIL-6R).
• Best results are when it is co-prescribed with MTX, but is licensed as
monotherapy.
• Use with caution in patients with a history of diverticulitis due to increased

[SECTION]risk of gut perforation. Risk is elevated if patient taking GCs and/or NSAIDs.
Patients need counselling about the risk.
Box 5.4 The British Society for Rheumatology consensus guidelines for
biologic therapies for RA
Anti-TNFα*
Local guidelines vary on blood monitoring requirement for anti-TNFα. It is
prudent to check FBC with WCC regularly to screen for neutropenia and
malignancy such as lymphoma.4
Anti-IL-6 receptor (TCZ)
Check WCC and neutrophil count monthly for 6 months. If no neutropenia
occurs in the first 6 months, monitoring can be reduced to 2-3 monthly. For
TCZ monotherapy, check LFTs monthly for the first 6-months, then every 2-3
months if results are stable. For TCZ co-prescribed with sDMARDs, monthly
LFT monitoring is recommended.5
Abatacept (ABA)
None available. For safety and monitoring, see information on its SPC at
http://www.medicines.org.uk
Anti-CD20 (RTX)
Check immunoglobulins 4–6 months after each infusion. If there is active
infection, IgG levels <6g/L or very low CD4/CD8 counts, withhold
treatment.6 See also its SPC at http://www.medicines.org.uk

Biologic DMARD biosimilars
The European Medicines Agency defines biosimilars as ‘a biological medicine
that is similar to another biological medicine that has already been authorised for
use’. This usually occurs after a patent expires on an originator drug. See Box
5.4.
• Since biologic therapies are derived from yeast or bacterium, biosimilars are
not identical to the originator drug and as such, cannot be classed as a generic
drug.
• For this reason, caution should be exercised if switching between originator
and biosimilar compounds.

[SECTION]• At the time of writing, three anti-TNFα biosimilar therapies were available.
Experience in the widespread use of biosimilars is lacking.
• There are currently no long-term data on the use of biosimilars. If starting or
switching a patient into a biosimilar drug, consider enrolling the patient onto a
patient (national) registry.
• Guidance regarding usage (including switching) of biosimilars varies widely,
so it is advised to follow local policies.
Novel medications on the horizon
• In addition to currently licensed drugs, numerous drugs are in development for
use in RA. Most notable of these are small molecules that target intracellular
processes involved in RA.
• Small molecule drugs can be administered orally.
• Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been extensively investigated and one JAK
inhibitor (tofacitinib) is currently available in the USA for the treatment of
RA.
• Further biologic therapies continue to be developed and trialled in RA,
including IL-17 inhibitors and variations on IL-6 blockade.
Managing infections while on immunosuppression
The main risk of immunosuppression is infection. ‘Serious infection’ is generally
defined as an infection that requires hospitalization or parenteral antimicrobial
treatment.
• See references 4 and 7 at the end of the chapter for full details.
• Generally, all sDMARDs (with the exception of HCQ) should be stopped
during any serious infection, and until recovery is complete.
• Biologic DMARDs should be discontinued during serious infection.
• Anti-TNFα therapy increases the risk of getting a serious infection, and
infection can present atypically, so vigilance is required.
• A careful review of the risks and benefits of anti-TNFα therapy should be
undertaken, especially in patients with:
• chronic infected leg ulcers.
• septic arthritis of a native joint within the last 12 months.
• sepsis of a prosthetic joint within the last 12 months (if removed) or
indefinitely (if joint remains in situ).
• persistent/recurrent chest infections.
• indwelling urinary catheter.
• bronchiectasis.
• hypogammaglobulinaemia.

[SECTION]Tuberculosis (TB)
• If a patient develops symptoms suggested of TB infection while on anti-TNFα,
anti-mycobacterial treatment should be initiated.
• If the patient remains systemically well, anti-TNFα therapy may continue
while the TB infection is treated.
• Patients on anti-TNFα therapy are more likely to develop extra-pulmonary TB.
• Non-TB mycoplasma infections are rare and require expert advice.
• Evidence for the occurrence of TB with other biologic agents is limited, but
appears to be less than for anti-TNFα.
Opportunistic infection risk issues
• While rare, monitor for opportunistic bacterial (e.g. Listeria, Salmonella) and
fungal (e.g. histoplasmosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, Coccidioides,
Pneumocystis jirovecii) infections in patients treated with anti-TNFα.
• Consider treatment with varicella zoster immunoglobulin in all
immunocompromised RA patients who have had significant contact with an
individual with varicella zoster.
• Treat shingles and herpes zoster according to standard guidance.
RA-associated cancer risk
There is an increased risk of malignancy with RA, with a standardized incidence
ratio (SIR) of 1.1. The risk is greatest for Hodgkin’s (SIR 3.21) and lung cancer
(SIR 1.64).8
• A recent study from the BSR Biologics Register for RA reported no increased
risk of solid tumours with anti-TNFα therapy when compared to RA patients
treated with sDMARDs.9
• There is some evidence that skin cancers (both non-melanoma and melanoma)
may be more likely.
• There is a theoretical increased risk of cancer in patients treated with antiTNFα therapy who have previously had a cancer, or have risk factors for
cancer (e.g. smoking). Treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case
basis. However, because patients with previous cancer have been excluded
from most RCTs, little is known about the risk in this context.
• Data on cancer risk are scarce for other biologics; primarily due to smaller
numbers of patients taking these drugs and shorter exposure times since drug
licensing.
Pregnancy and breastfeeding with RA
The topic has been extensively reviewed quite recently.10

[SECTION]• RA often improves in pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester.
• Preconception counselling is essential, as many sDMARDs are contraindicated
in pregnancy and breastfeeding, and some sDMARDs can affect fertility.
• Ideally, conception should be planned and medications optimized prior to
conception.
• The management of RA in pregnancy should be discussed with all women of
childbearing age, and men considering having children.
• It is important to review how the pregnancy and birth are likely to proceed. If
possible, early referral to a specialist obstetric clinic with expertise managing
pregnant women with RA is recommended.
• If RA affects the hip, pelvis, or spine, an obstetric review is necessary to
discuss birth plans and analgesia.
• RA may make certain tasks more difficult for the new mother or father with
RA (e.g. changing nappies, bathing the baby). Planning and addressing these
problems prospectively is recommended.
• Patients should have a method of contacting the rheumatology team (e.g.
telephone advice line) should difficulties arise. A management strategy should
be agreed with the patient and obstetric and primary care team should the RA
flare in the perinatal period. Arrangement for an early rheumatology review in
the postnatal period, to ensure optimal disease management, is recommended.
• Drug use in pregnancy needs careful planning. Guidelines updating practice
have been recently published (Box 5.5).
• Paracetamol is safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Intermittent use might be
reasonable given restrictions on NSAID use (see Box 5.5). Avoid regular
paracetamol use during weeks 8–14 of pregnancy as there is a small risk of
cryptorchidism. There are no data on paternal exposure, but paracetamol is
likely to be safe.
• Biologic therapy experience is emerging for a number of the therapies but for
abatacept there are still very few data on its safety.
Box 5.5 The British Society for Rheumatology 2016 guidelines for
prescribing NSAIDs, GCs, sDMARDs, and bDMARDs in pregnancy and
breastfeeding
NSAIDs (including COX-2 selective NSAIDs)
Limited evidence. Possible ↑ risk of miscarriage and fetal malformation ∴
caution in first trimester. Stop NSAID by 32 weeks’ gestation to avoid
premature closure of ductus arteriosus. NSAIDs are excreted in breast milk
but no evidence of harm. Compatible with paternal exposure.

[SECTION]Glucocorticoids (GCs)
Compatible with pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Hydroxychloroquine (HQC)
Compatible with pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Methotrexate (MTX)
Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Stop MTX >3 months before
conception. In accidental pregnancy, stop MTX and start folic acid (5
mg/day). Low-dose MTX paternal exposure probably not risky.
Sulfasalazine (SSZ)
Compatible with pregnancy (use folic acid 5 mg/day) and breastfeeding.
May ↓ fertility in men, however, don’t stop SSZ to improve fertility unless
conception is delayed >12 months.
Leflunomide (LEF)
Not recommended in pregnancy or when breastfeeding. Women considering
pregnancy should undergo cholestyramine washout prior to conception. If
accidental conception occurs, cholestyramine washout should be instituted
until LEF plasma levels are undetectable.
Azathioprine (AZA)
Compatible with pregnancy at doses ≤2 mg/kg/day and in breastfeeding and
with paternal exposure.
Anti-TNFα
Infliximab: stop after 16 weeks’ gestation. Compatible with paternal exposure.
Etanercept: stop by third trimester. Compatible with paternal exposure.
Adalimumab: stop by third trimester. Compatible with paternal exposure.
Certolizumab pegol: compatible with all trimesters of pregnancy. Compatible
with paternal exposure. Breastfeeding probably safe on any anti-TNFα
therapy, although evidence is limited.
Rituximab (RTX)
Stop 6 months before pregnancy. No evidence on RTX during breastfeeding.
Second/third trimester exposure associated with neonatal B-cell depletion.
Limited evidence on paternal exposure—likely not harmful.
Tocilizumab
Stop 3 months <conception. No data on breastfeeding.

[SECTION]Surgery in RA patients
A thorough perioperative plan should be made for all patients.
• Inform the surgical and anaesthetic team of the diagnosis of RA and any
relevant complications/comorbidities.
• Spinal involvement should be highlighted to the anaesthetist, to inform
intubation, positioning, and spinal anaesthesia.
• Respiratory involvement may make artificial ventilation challenging, and
increase the risk of postoperative infection.
• Postoperative occupational and physiotherapy will need to be tailored to
accommodate the patient’s RA.
• For elective procedures, advance assessment and preparation of the home
environment should be undertaken to facilitate rehabilitation.
• Generally, sDMARDs should be continued throughout the perioperative
period, to minimize the need for GCs (as the latter increase risk of surgical site
infection and non-healing).
• For high-risk (‘dirty’/lengthy) procedures and when patients have
comorbidities, sDMARDs may need to be stopped.
• Close monitoring of renal function is essential in the perioperative period, to
monitor for sDMARD-related toxicity.
• Anti-TNFα therapy should be stopped before surgery. ‘Washout’ times for
biologics vary depending on half-life of the drug.
• Biologics can be restarted after surgery once good wound healing has
progressed and there is no evidence of infection. Please refer to local
guidelines, but a typical current practice is to stop biologic therapy 2 weeks
prior to surgery, and restart 2 weeks after surgery.
Complementary therapies for RA
• Some patients will want treatment from complementary therapists, either in
advance or during their long-term management of RA.
• Some commonly used complementary therapies include acupuncture,
chiropractic, homeopathy, aromatherapy, and faith healing.
• Patients often find treatments beneficial, and provided they do no harm, there
is generally no reason to advise patients to stop treatment.
• It is important to highlight the absence of robust evidence for these treatments,
and they are not a substitution for standard management.
• Spinal/neck manipulation is generally not recommended, especially if RA is
known to affect the spine.
• Inquire about any supplements, herbal, or other medication use that might

[SECTION]interfere with the metabolism of analgesics and sDMARDs.
• Please refer to
Chapter 9 for information on juvenile RF-positive
polyarthritis.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disorder characterized by cartilage loss, bone
remodelling, joint deformity, and synovial inflammation. It is the most common
joint disease in humans.

Epidemiology
• It is estimated that 8.5 million people in the UK have joint pain attributable to
OA, and that 15% of the UK population aged >55 years have symptomatic
knee OA.
• The prevalence of radiographic hand OA in the UK is estimated at 4.4 million
people, significant radiographic knee OA at 0.5 million people, and significant
radiographic hip OA at 0.2 million.1
• By 2020, OA is expected to be the fourth leading cause of disability in the
world.
• OA poses a significant economic burden on the UK economy, using 1% of
gross domestic product, and causing 36 million working days to be lost each
year.2

Pathology
• Although there are recognized associations between OA, age, and trauma,
advances in knowledge of cartilage biochemistry and the recognition of
crystal-associated disease have renewed interest in OA as a dynamic condition
of cartilage loss (chondropathy) with periarticular bone reaction.
• At present, OA is assessed and managed clinically as a structural, rather than
physiological condition, with an emphasis on established disease and disease
prevention.
• Chondrocyte dysfunction leads to changes in the extracellular matrix, and
metalloproteinase enzyme release.
• Proteoglycan degradation leads to oedema and micro-fissures in the cartilage.
Micro-fissures progress to subchondral cysts and erosions.
• Cartilage degradation products stimulate synovial inflammation and the
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL1 and TNFα).
• Macroscopic changes in OA include cystic bone degeneration, cartilage loss,
and growth of bone at joint margins (osteophytes).
• Microscopic changes include flaking and fibrillation of articular cartilage with
variations in vascularity and mineralization of subchondral bone, leading to
sclerosis and new bone formation.
• Most surveys of OA rely on radiographic features for definition and severity—
this is problematic because of poor correlation of radiographic change with
clinical status, symptoms, or function.
• Radiographic staging is best done at the hip and knee, but is poorest in the
hand and spine. The correlation between pathology and radiology is shown in
Table 6.1.

Aetiology
• Females are at higher risk of OA (relative risk (RR) 2.6) and tend to develop
structural damage more quickly, and are more likely to proceed to a total hip
arthroplasty.
• Hip OA is more common in Europeans than in Asians or in African
Americans.
• The Framingham study found that 27% of people aged 63–70 years, and 44%
of people aged >80 years had radiographic knee OA.
• A UK study showed that 50% of adults aged >50 years with radiographic knee
OA had symptoms. Similar figures are seen in hip OA.
• Notably only 3–7% of people with radiographic features of hands OA, are
symptomatic.
• Risk factors associated with OA include the following:
• Family history; particularly with generalized nodal OA.
• Genetics: increased concordance for OA in monozygotic vs dizygotic twins,
and particularly for nodal OA.
• Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic loci associated
with OA: hand OA with chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 13, and 19; knee OA with the
LRCH1 gene on chromosome 13; hip OA with chromosome 11 (RR 1.4–
1.6).
• Genetics of bone or articular cartilage structure (COL2A1 gene).
• High bone density.
• Calcium crystal deposition disease and acromegaly.
• Obesity (close association with onset and progression of knee and hand OA,
but not hip OA).
• Femoral dysplasia (hip OA).
• Trauma (repeated or single event).
• Low vitamin C and D levels (progression of knee OA).
• Factors with less, or no, evidence for there being a risk for OA:
• For hip OA: previous hip disease (e.g. Perthes disease), acetabular
dysplasia, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, severe trauma,
generalized OA, and occupation (e.g. farming).

[SECTION]• There is little evidence to link OA with repetitive injury from occupation or
sports, such as running in those with normal joints, except perhaps kneebending in men.

Clinical features
The symptoms, and to a degree, most features of OA (Table 6.2), often do not
correlate with functional or anatomical change judged radiographically.

• Several potential mechanisms may be responsible for the pain associated with
OA.
• Since cartilage is aneural, pain may arise from a number of other sites:

[SECTION]inflammatory mediators causing intra-articular hypertension, capsular
distension, and/or stimulation of synovial and subchondral bone nerve
fibres.
• Concomitant enthesopathy or bursitis may lead to pain.
• Morning stiffness of <30 min is common in OA.
• Muscle weakness and atrophy due to altered joint use is common.
• Several subsets of OA exist, with migration between patterns:
• Primary OA.
• Generalized nodal OA (GNOA).
• Inflammatory/erosive OA (iOA).
• Large joint OA (knee and hip).
• Spinal OA.
• Secondary OA (Table 6.3).
Generalized nodal OA (GNOA)
• This common condition (see Plate 7d), more common in women than in
men, is characterized by polyarticular involvement.
• It is characterized by Heberden’s nodes (DIPJ) and Bouchard’s nodes (PIPJ).
• GNOA predisposes to OA of knee, hip, and spine.
• The is often a strong family history.
• There is often MCPJ involvement, particularly the second and third. If there is
MCPJ involvement, further investigation to exclude causes of secondary OA
are recommended.
Inflammatory/erosive OA (iOA)
• Sometimes called erosive OA, iOA is characterized by interphalangeal joint
involvement, flares of inflammatory symptoms with rapid progression, and a
tendency to joint ankylosis.
• Central joint subchondral erosions and associated bony remodelling.
• The peak onset is around the menopause.
• Functional impairment is more likely than with nodal OA.
• The key differential diagnosis is psoriatic arthritis. Unfortunately, the two
conditions can be indistinguishable on plain radiographs in the early stages
and on ultrasound unless there are other psoriatic disease features such as
skin/nail psoriasis or tenosynovitis.
Large joint OA
• The knee is commonly affected; most often the patellofemoral and medial
tibiofemoral compartments.
• Severe bone and cartilage loss leads to instability and varus (bow) deformity.

[SECTION]• Instability and ‘giving way’ of a knee may be exacerbated by quadriceps
weakness.
• Hip OA tends to present as groin, buttock, or anterior thigh pain on weight
bearing, rather than lateral hip discomfort.
• Differential diagnosis for hip and groin pain include iliopsoas dysfunction,
ischial bone lesions, symphysis, and trochanteric pain syndrome.
• Subdivision of hip OA is usually made on the basis of acetabular cartilage loss
patterns:
• Superior pole: common pattern, often unilateral, more common in men, and
likely to progress.
• Central (medial): less common, usually bilateral, more common in women,
and less likely to progress.
• Indeterminate acetabular-concentric patterns are also described.
Secondary OA
Secondary OA is associated with a wide variety of disorders as listed in Table
6.3.

Metabolic/endocrine:
Haemochromatosis
Acromegaly

Neuropathic disorders:

Anatomical abnormalities:

Investigation
• The diagnosis of OA is based on clinical and radiological findings. There are
no specific laboratory tests.
• As the disease progresses, other findings may appear and aid diagnosis,
including osteophytes, subchondral bone sclerosis, and subchondral cysts.
• Radiographs correlate poorly with symptoms and clinical function. Many older
patients will have radiographic changes consistent with OA, but will be
asymptomatic.

[SECTION]• MRI is better at identifying early articular cartilage loss, subchondral bone
oedema, and low-grade synovitis, but it is rarely used.
• Laboratory tests (including synovial fluid analysis) may be useful to exclude
other causes of joint pain, such as RA, though abnormalities and pattern of
acute phase may be similar for PsA and calcium pyrophosphate deposition
disease.
• There are biomarkers of tissue destruction and inflammation that may
eventually translate from research settings to clinical use, including:
• cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP).
• pyridinoline and bone sialoprotein.
• metalloproteinases.
• hyaluronan.
• C-terminal cross-link telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II).
• Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging: uses infrared light (in a similar
way to sonography) to produce high-resolution dynamic images. This research
tool may translate to clinical practice.

Management
Management is based on symptoms and the impact of symptoms and joint
structural changes including the effect on quality of life, function, occupation,
leisure, and sleep.
• Functional requirements are addressed by therapists following therapy
assessment (occupational and physiotherapy).
• Occupational therapy can provide splints, aids, safe environment, and joint
protection techniques.
• Exercise is a key treatment in many cases as it improves muscle strength, joint
proprioception, and aerobic fitness.
• Patient expectations influence the use of analgesia and referral for surgical
procedures.
• Weight is associated with a number of types of OA in weight-bearing joints
and is linked to poor prognosis. Weight loss is therefore important as a key
intervention.
• Psychosocial factors (mood and relationships) may influence symptoms and
impact of OA and require therapeutic input occasionally.
• A multi-disciplinary approach is sensible. In the UK, NICE has produced
guidelines for management of OA in adults that emphasize a holistic approach
tailored to the patient’s specific needs.3
• NICE identifies core treatments that should be offered to all patients, in

[SECTION]addition to the use of pharmacological and adjunctive treatments based on
patient needs (Box 6.1).
Pharmacotherapies
• NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors may can be effective for use in short periods
during inflammatory disease flares.
• UK NICE guidance emphasizes NSAID use for the shortest time and at the
lowest dose possible and with caution in older patients.
• Cardiovascular adverse events appear equal between conventional NSAIDs
and COX-2 inhibitors.
• The addition of local anaesthetic to intra-articular GC injection does not
improve efficacy, but may reduce pain from the injections.
• Asymptomatic effusions do not require intra-articular injection.
• Most joint injection data are for knee OA. Infection is rare (<1:10,000), but
care should be taken to clean overlying skin and avoid injecting through
infected skin or psoriatic lesions. Patients should be warned of the risk of skin
depigmentation and fat atrophy. It is advised that patients receive no more than
3–4 injections per year, each ≥3 months apart
• Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid derivatives (viscosupplementation)
is not supported by robust data and is not supported by UK NICE guidance.
• Oral glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate supplements have been shown in
RCTs and meta-analyses to be no better than placebo, and are not
recommended by NICE in the UK.
• Evidence that avocado/soybean unsaponifiable supplementation, evening
primrose oil, rose hip extract, blue-lip mussel extract, and omega-3 fish oils
improve pain is limited.
Box 6.1 OA: Disease management principles
Core treatments
• Holistic, patient-centred care plan.
• Provision of written and verbal information.
• Advice on footwear.
• Exercise.
• Weight loss.
Adjunctive treatments
• TENS machine.
• Braces, walking aids, and insoles.
• Thermotherapy: cold/warm measures to reduce symptoms.

[SECTION]Pharmacological treatments
Initial
• Regular paracetamol 1 g 3–4 times daily.
• Topical anti-inflammatory gels (NSAIDs).
• Topical capsaicin cream.
Subsequent
• Oral NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors ± proton pump inhibitor.
• Intra-articular glucocorticoids (useful during flares; duration of benefit
variable).
Rarely
• Codeine–paracetamol combination analgesics.
• Buprenorphine.
• Gabapentin or pregabalin.
Surgical
• Arthroscopic lavage/debridement if mechanical locking.
• Joint replacement for activity-limiting symptomatic OA—may reduce pain
rather than increase function.
Future therapeutic strategies
Current OA research is focusing on disease-modifying anti-osteoarthritis drugs
(DMOADs), with the aim of preventing joint damage. Approaches include:
• Inhibition of RANK ligand-mediated subchondral bone resorption using
monoclonal antibodies.
• Bisphosphonates reducing bone loss—putatively anti-(subchondral bone)
resorption.
• Inhibition of cathepsin K, a potent protease involved in degradation of type I
collagen in bone matrix.
• Vitamin D supplementation, which will optimize calcium absorption and
reduce PTH, slowing bone resorption. Studies are yet to be done.
• Diacerein, an IL1 blocker, has been shown to reduce joint space loss in hip OA
over 3 years in one RCT. Further studies need to be performed.
• Mesenchymal stem cell therapy—precursor cells capable of differentiating
into osteogenic, chondrogenic, or adipogenic cells. Several clinical trials are
ongoing in early phases.

Prognosis
Knee OA
• Progression in the knee may take many years. Cohort studies have found that
radiographic deterioration occurs in one-third of cases.
• BMI predicts progression of patellofemoral OA.
• For tibiofemoral compartment OA, patients with contralateral knee OA, a
baseline index knee OA grade of 1, higher body mass index (BMI) and higher
baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities arthritis index total
scores are more likely to develop Kellgren & Lawrence grade of 3 or 4 within
5 years.
Hip OA
• Progression of hip disease is variable. A Danish study found that 66% of hips
worsened radiologically over 10 years, although symptomatic improvement
was common.
• Heterogeneity of prediction factors is found across studies and within study
populations.
• Clinical characteristics (higher comorbidity count and presence of knee OA),
health behaviour factors (no supervised exercise and physical inactivity), and
sociodemographics (lower education) have been found to predict deterioration
of pain (weak evidence).
• A higher number of comorbidities have been found to predict deterioration of
physical functioning (strong evidence).

Gout and hyperuricaemia
Gout is a common, painful, and potentially destructive rheumatologic disorder,
related to hyperuricaemia. The clinical consequences of uric acid or urate
(monosodium urate (MSU)) crystal deposition include acute and chronic
arthritis, tophus formation, nephrolithiasis, and gouty nephropathy.
Epidemiology
• Several epidemiologic studies from different countries suggest that the
incidence and prevalence of gout is increasing, perhaps related to better
recognition, and changes in lifestyle and diet.
• In the UK, gout affects 25 per 1000 of the population, and accounts for
250,000 GP consultations per year. Prevalence data from the USA on selfreported gout estimate that 13.6 per 1000 adult males and 6.4 per 1000 adult
females are affected.
• Gout is more common in middle-aged and elderly people.
• The risk factors for gout are the same as those for hyperuricaemia (Table 7.1).
Classification criteria
• The current ACR/EULAR guidelines stipulate, for the classification of gout,
the occurrence of ≥1 episode (‘attack’) of joint or bursal swelling, pain or
tenderness.
• MSU crystals in (symptomatic) synovial fluid or from a tophus is sufficient for
diagnosis of gout.

[SECTION]• The domains of the criteria include:
• clinical (pattern of joint involvement, characteristics, and time course of
symptomatic episodes).
• laboratory (serum uric acid (SUA) levels).
• synovial fluid (aspirate analysis for crystals).
• imaging (radiographic gout-related erosion, double-contour sign on
ultrasound, or MSU crystals on dual-energy CT).
Clinical features
• The first stage of the condition is usually asymptomatic hyperuricaemia (SUA
>680 mg/L) often starting years before symptoms develop.
• This concentration marks the physiological point above which urate salts are
no longer soluble in the serum at physiologic pH and temperature. Not
everyone with hyperuricaemia develops gout, however.
• Inflammation to MSU crystals is typically sudden and severe and is often
referred to as an ‘attack’ of gout.
• The initial attack commonly occurs in the fourth to sixth decade of life in men,
and in postmenopausal women.
• The initial attack is usually monoarticular, affecting the first
metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra) in up to 60% of patients.
• Other frequently involved joints include the ankle, midfoot, knee, wrist, elbow
(olecranon bursa), and the small joints of the hands.
• Axial and large joints and spinal structures are rarely involved.
• With an attack, pain reaches its maximum intensity in 4–12 hours, with
marked limitation of physical function. Symptoms usually resolve in 3–14
days.
• 70–80% of individuals will have another attack(s) within 2 years.
• The initial attacks are usually separated by asymptomatic inter-critical period,
lasting months to years.
• As the disease progresses, acute attacks may become more polyarticular, with
associated joint damage and deformity. Intervals between attacks tend to
shorten. Disability, chronic pain, and tophi formation can be observed if
treatment is suboptimal (see Plate 7).
• Tophi are deposits of MSU embedded in a matrix composed of lipids, proteins,
and calcific debris:
• Tophi are usually subcutaneous, but have been reported to occur in bone,
eyes, and other organs.
• Classic sites for tophi formation include ear pinna, elbow and knee bursae,
Achilles tendon, and dorsal surface of the MCPJs.

[SECTION]• Tophi are usually painless, although the overlying skin may ulcerate and
become infected.
• Those most at risk of tophi are patients with prolonged severe
hyperuricaemia, polyarticular gout, and the elderly with primary nodal OA
on diuretics.
• Some clinicians will treat asymptomatic hyperuricaemia to prevent the onset
of ‘urate nephropathy’; but this is controversial.
• Hyperuricaemia and gout are associated with the metabolic syndrome
(dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance).
Investigation
• Synovial fluid analysis is the most important investigation.
• Negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals on polarized light microscopy
confirms the diagnosis.
• Crystals may be extra- or intracellular. However, the absence of crystals does
not rule out the diagnosis.
• MSU crystals are identifiable in the synovial fluid from previously affected
joints and about 70% of those receiving SUA-lowering therapy during the
asymptomatic inter-critical period.
• SUA concentrations may be normal during an acute attack in up to 30% of
cases, and may not reflect pre-flare levels. Therefore, SUA concentration
cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis during an acute flare.
• SUA concentrations are of value in assessing the patient only once the acute
flare has subsided; either to confirm hyperuricaemia or to monitor the
effectiveness of therapy.

enzyme converting hypoxanthine back to precursors and therefore competing with its conversion to
xanthine and then uric acid; PRPP, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase—a component enzyme in
purine ring synthesis.

Imaging
• Imaging findings vary at different stages of gout.
• Plain radiographs are often normal during the early phase of the disease, but
soft tissue swelling can be apparent.
• Radiographs are useful to assess for other conditions such as trauma or
infection (Box 7.1). Subcortical bone cysts may be suggestive of tophi or
erosions. Para-articular erosions with ‘overhanging edges’ of bone are
characteristic of gout.
• Later in the disease, radiographs may demonstrate tophi near joints, tissue
swelling, para-articular erosions, periosteal new bone formation, and joint
deformity. Many features mimic RA.
• US can be useful to detect early disease and monitor treatment. Diagnostic
features include a linear density parallel to the joint surface (double-contour
sign), or tophaceous deposits which appear as oval stippled signal
(hyperechoic cloudy area).
• Dual-energy CT specifically identifies MSU deposits and distinguishes them
from calcium deposition.

Management
The management of gout should be approached in two phases: the treatment of
the acute attack and the treatment of chronic or tophaceous gout (Fig. 7.1).
The acute attack of gout
• Rest, elevation, and ice packs can partly ease symptoms.
• The principal therapies are NSAIDs, colchicine, and oral and intra-articular
(IA) glucocorticoids (GCs).
• SUA-lowering drugs are ineffective in acute gout. Patients already on SUAlowering drugs, should continue without interruption.
• NSAIDs decrease pain, swelling, and duration of gout attacks.
• All NSAIDs, including COX-2 selective NSAIDs, have potentially similar
efficacy for gout.
• NSAIDs are most effective when initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset.
The dose may be reduced after a reduction in symptoms, and discontinued 1–2
days after complete resolution of signs.
• The typical duration of NSAIDs required for an acute attack is 5–7 days.
NSAIDs are contraindicated in renal insufficiency (e.g. CKD3b–5). NSAIDs
should be used with caution in the elderly and patients with GI risk factors.
• Colchicine can be very effective in acute gout, and have a rapid onset of
action. Oral colchicine 0.5 mg, two to four times daily, for 5 days can be
effective but may cause diarrhoea at higher doses.
• Colchicine is often given in addition to NSAIDs, although there is no evidence
to support this. IV colchicine is no longer used due to high risk of bone
marrow suppression and death.
• Oral prednisone 10–30 mg daily is effective for immediate relief of gout, with
dose then tapered over 7–10 days.
• Parenteral GCs maybe used in individuals unable to take oral form and with
polyarticular gout. A study comparing intramuscular triamcinolone with oral

[SECTION]indometacin found no significant difference in time to recovery.
• IA GCs are useful if ≤4 joints are affected. A systematic review on the safety
and efficacy of IA GCs for acute gout could not identify any RCTs of their use.
• IA GCs should be avoided if septic arthritis is possible.
• IL-1 inhibitors are under study for acute gout. IL-1β is the predominant
mediator of acute inflammation.
• Anakinra 100 mg SC daily has been used until symptoms improve with
good effect.
• Canakinumab 150 mg SC is licensed for acute gout in Europe.
• In one study comparing SC canakinumab with IM triamcinolone,
canakinumab achieved better outcomes in terms of pain relief, joint swelling
reduction, and patient-assessed global response.
• Canakinumab is effective in patients either with multiple gout ‘flares’ or
whose disease is refractory to other treatment or have contraindications to
other medications.
• However, canakinumab is associated with increased infections, and at the
time of writing is 5000× the cost of triamcinolone.

[SECTION]Treatment of chronic or tophaceous gout
• Addressing adverse lifestyle factors and comorbidities should be a priority,
including to:
• attain a normal BMI (20–25)/reduce centripetal obesity.
• reduce, or preferentially stop, consumption of alcohol, red meat, shellfish,
and sugary drinks.
• manage hypertension and associated hypertriglyceridemia.
• encourage to drink low-fat milk daily (a natural uricosuric).
• remain well hydrated.
• consider how best to minimize treatments which can aggravate
hyperuricaemia (e.g. thiazide, furosemide, indapamide, ciclosporin,
levodopa, theophylline).
• The target SUA with all drug therapy is <360 µmol/L (6 mg/dL) or <300
µmol/L (5 mg/dL) where there is severe gout. Gout attacks are very unlikely
where SUA is below target.
• Drugs that decrease SUA levels are indicated in individuals with frequent or
disabling attacks of gout, clinical or radiological evidence of chronic gouty
arthropathy, tophaceous disease, with secondary renal impairment, or
urolithiasis.
• SUA-lowering drugs are initiated 2–4 weeks after an acute flare subsides, as
they may prolong or worsen the acute flare.
• Allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor) is the first-line treatment:
• Allopurinol is initiated at 100 mg daily with incremental dose titration every
month, aiming to lower SUA to ≤300 mg/L.
• The dose range of allopurinol is 100–900 mg daily.
• Most patients respond to 400 mg daily of allopurinol.
• Dosing should be adjusted for renal impairment.
• Allopurinol takes 4 days to 2 weeks to take effect.
• Approximately 5–10% of patients develop significant drug intolerance:
nausea, diarrhoea, elevated transaminase levels (3–5%).
• Severe hepatic disease including granulomatous hepatitis, cholestatic
jaundice, and hepatic necrosis are rare.
• About 2% of patients develop a pruritic, maculopapular rash. Pruritis alone
can herald the onset of rash.
• Bone marrow suppression occurs rarely—at high doses.
• HLA-B*5801 status increases the risk of developing allopurinol drug
reaction eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).
• In mild to moderate intolerance, allopurinol can be reintroduced at very low

[SECTION]•

•

levels (e.g. 10 mg daily) and titrated up slowly.
• Allopurinol can interfere with the metabolism of azathioprine and warfarin,
increasing the risk of side effects.
• Concomitant colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily orally) is recommended as
prophylaxis against acute flares for the first 3–6 months of allopurinol
treatment.
Febuxostat is a non-purine xanthine oxidase inhibitor:
• Febuxostat is more effective at lowering SUA than allopurinol, and may be
used in patients allergic to allopurinol, patients not attaining target SUA at
maximal allopurinol dose, and in patients with moderate renal insufficiency.
• Doses range from 40 to 120 mg/day.
• Dose reduction is required in patients with renal dysfunction.
• Side effects include nausea, liver dysfunction, arthralgia, and rash.
• Some studies have shown a higher incidence of cardiovascular side effects
with febuxostat compared with allopurinol.
• Febuxostat is substantially more expensive than allopurinol.
Some patients may respond to allopurinol and a uricosuric agent (e.g.
probenecid) when either alone has been ineffective.
Uricosuric drugs should be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency or a
history of nephrolithiasis.
Fenofibrate decreases SUA by increasing renal uric acid clearance. It may
have an unlicensed role in patients resistant or intolerant to other treatments. It
should be avoided in hepatic and biliary disease, hypothyroidism and
pregnancy. Side effects include myoarthralgias.
Sulfinpyrazone is a uricosuric drug which is effective and well tolerated, but is
contraindicated in patients with renal stones and is ineffective in those with
renal insufficiency.
Benzbromarone is a uricosuric agent available in Europe. It is effective in
patients with renal insufficiency. Liver function must be monitored for druginduced hepatitis (fulminant liver failure reported).
Pegloticase is a porcine uricase reserved for patients with severe gout, in
whom other gout treatments have been ineffective. Administration is 8 mg IV
every 2 weeks. Concomitant colchicine prophylaxis is recommended for the
first 6 months of use. Anti-pegloticase antibodies have been reported.
Rasburicase is a non-pegylated recombinant uricase. It may be more
immunogenic than pegloticase.
Patients with uric acid stones are best managed with adequate hydration,
urinary alkalization, and allopurinol. This regimen is also effective in
preventing calcium oxalate stones.

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease
• See Box 7.2 for an overview of EULAR definitions and clinical presentations.
• Precipitation of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals in tissues is extremely
common and arguably the most common reason why previously ill
hospitalized patients develop MSK problems when unwell in hospital.
• The spectrum of CPP crystal deposition disease includes acute and chronic
arthropathy, inflammation and symptoms at entheses or within/involving
tendons, soft tissue and bursal inflammation, asymptomatic cartilage
calcification, and symptoms from spinal canal and intervertebral disc crystals.

Tendon insertion/enthesis-based inflammation associated with CPPD; boxingglove-like hand/wrist swelling features of acute disease.
• The risk of CPPD-related disease increases with age. Presentation in a young
adult <50 years old should prompt a search for an associated metabolic cause.
• Definite associations with CPPD disease and chondrocalcinosis (i.e.
calcification of fibrocartilage and hyaline cartilage typically of the knee and
wrist) include:
• Hypomagnesaemia (check Mg, PTH, vitamin D, bone profile and renal
function).
• Hypophosphatasia (low ALP, raised serum pyridoxal-5 phosphate and
increased urinary phophoethanolamine).
• Haemochromatosis (positive family history, abnormal LFTs, raised
haemoglobin, ferritin and transferrin saturation, and disease-associated HFE
genotype).
• Wilson’s disease (neurological disease, abnormal LFTs, eye disease, and
abnormally low serum caeruloplasmin).
• Hyperparathyroidism (primary, secondary, and tertiary in renal disease). So
check PTH, bone profile, renal function/estimated GFR, and vitamin D).
• Vitamin

deficiency—chronic
(through

hyperparathyroidism). Check as for hyperparathyroidism.
• Possible CPPD disease associations include gout, ochronosis, hypocalciuric
hypercalcaemia, diabetes, DISH, and XLHR.

term was ‘pseudogout’) are listed in Box 7.3.

• Joint lavage.
Investigation
• CPPD disease is defined by the presence of positively birefringent, rhomboidshaped crystals under polarized light microscopy of synovial fluid. Crystals
may be intra- or extracellular.
• Radiographs of the affected joints may not be helpful in establishing the
diagnosis. However, the presence of chondrocalcinosis increases the likelihood
of CPPD disease. Radiographic clues that may help to distinguish CPPD
disease from OA include:
• axial involvement.
• sacroiliac erosions.
• cortical erosions of the femur.
• osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle.
• associated hyperparathyroid disease signs: endocortical erosions of long
bones in the hands and feet, cortical tunnelling, and osteopenia in phalanges.
• US features indicative of CPPD include a thin hyperechoic band along the
cartilage, running in parallel to the bony cortex (‘tram-lines’). Sites can
include the MCPJs, wrists, knees, and tendons. Nodular deposits in bursae,
entheses, and hyperechoic lines parallel to tendons can also be observed.
• Both CT and MRI may be needed to disclose disease in spinal structures: MRI
to show inflammatory changes and CT to disclose the distribution of
calcification (see Plate 22).
Management
Acute CPPD-related arthritis
• The management of acute CPPD disease is summarized in Fig. 7.2.
• Rest, ice, and splinting in the acute phase will help symptoms.
• NSAIDs in the acute phase.
• Oral colchicine (0.5 mg, two to four times a day) can be used in patients in
whom NSAIDs are contraindicated in the acute setting or as prophylactic use
to prevent recurrent flares (see Fig. 7.2).
• Joint aspiration and IA GC injection for acute joint inflammation, once joint
infection has been excluded (see Chapters 24).
• Oral GCs will undoubtedly help in the acute setting but the dose should be
reviewed and minimized to avoid long-term use and steroid dependency.
• Anakinra has been used in polyarticular acute CPPD disease, unresponsive to

[SECTION]other medications.
• As in all CPPD cases, identify and manage associated metabolic abnormalities.
Chronic CPPD arthritis/disease
• Disease may mimic RA if polyarticular and can cause persistent inflammatorytype spinal symptoms.
• Ongoing metabolic influences of CPPD disease may need addressing. Renal
disease, hyperparathyroidism (primary, secondary, or tertiary (but for
secondary also consider vitamin D deficiency)), and chronic dehydration may
all play a role.
• Hydroxychloroquine (200–400 mg daily in twice-daily doses for trial period of
4 months for example) or methotrexate (e.g. 15 mg weekly for trial period of 6
months initially) may be tried in patients with resistant disease.
• Arguably there is more evidence to support the use of methotrexate than
hydroxychloroquine.1

Spondyloarthritis (SpA): a paradigm shift
Axial SpA including ankylosing spondylitis
Psoriatic arthritis
SpA-associated reactive arthritis
Inflammatory bowel disease-related SpA
Juvenile spondyloarthritis

Introduction
All spondyloarthropathies (SpAs) are commonly characterized by inflammatory
back and axial skeletal pains, enthesitis, and an association with HLA-B27.
• The SpAs are:
• Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA).
• Ankylosing spondylitis (AS; encompassed by axSpA definition).
• Psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
• Reactive arthritis (ReA).
• Inflammatory bowel disease-related SpA.
• Juvenile SpA/enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA; see Chapter 9).
• Considered together the SpAs are the most common form of chronic
inflammatory arthritis; more common than RA.
• All SpAs are potentially manifest by:
• enthesitis.
• inflammatory back pain.
• asymmetric peripheral arthritis.
• inflammatory bowel lesions.
• psoriasis.

[SECTION]•

•
•
•

• dactylitis.
• osteitis.
• sterile urethritis.
• uveitis (typically acute anterior uveitis).
• aorta/aortic valve lesions (rare).
• abnormal antigen presentation associated with HLA-B27.
Similarities exist between SpAs and the SAPHO (synovitis, acne,
palmoplantar pustulosis, hyperostosis, aseptic osteomyelitis) syndrome;
SAPHO is not considered to be a SpA; see Chapter 16.
Pathological changes are mainly at entheses but also in tissues of the gut, uveal
tract, urethra, aorta, bone, synovium, and skin.
A common inflammatory ‘target’ or precise common reason why such tissues
might be affected is postulated though not yet proven.
Lines of immunopathology research currently focus on general and local tissue
resident Th17 cell activation by Il-23 and subsequent activating effects
specific to the local tissue environment.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA): a paradigm shift
Key to classifying all SpAs is the presence of inflammatory back pain (Box 8.1)
and, for day-to-day clinical recognition—the presence of enthesitis (Box 8.2).
• Sadly, there is still a 7–10-year delay in a sizable number of patients between
symptom onset and diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS)—similar data to
data derived >30 years ago. One reason is that it takes many years in some
patients to confirm AS as it is based partly on radiographic criteria (of SIJs)
which can take years to evolve (Box 8.3).
• The classification of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA; see the Assessment of
Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) working group criteria:
http://www.asas-group.org) includes classical AS as well as earlier stages and
abortive courses of the disease, in which structural alterations have not yet
occurred.
• ASAS has facilitated classification of SpA in terms of axial or peripheral
predominant disease.
• The new ASAS criteria (for axSpA; Box 8.4) potentially allow all patients,
who will ultimately develop AS, to be identified earlier in their disease
compared with the modified New York (mNY) criteria.
• However, it is likely that not all ASAS axSpA classifiable patients will
progress to an AS phenotype classifiable by the mNY criteria.
• Previously, early SpA disease was recognizable formally only through a

[SECTION]definition (ESSG) of ‘undifferentiated SpA’ (USpA). Many such patients
would now be classifiable by the newer ASAS working group criteria for
(peripheral) SpA (Box 8.5).
• Recently, classification criteria for PsA have also been developed (CASPAR;
see ‘Psoriatic arthritis’, pp. 308–313).
Box 8.1 Inflammatory back pain (IBP)
A history of IBP is key to considering axial symptoms as secondary to SpA—
for people in whom it starts at <40 years of age. Applicable for back and/or
posterior pelvic symptoms. A number of descriptions exist (e.g. after Calin,
Rudwaleit, or ASAS). Typically, IBP:
• comes on gradually over time (insidious onset).
• is improved with exercise.
• does not improve with rest.
• causes pain at night with improvement on getting up.
• is reported by patients as occurring with “stiffness”.
• improves with a (‘once-daily’) modified-release NSAID taken at bedtime.
Box 8.2 Enthesitis
An enthesis is the name given to specialized tissue which attaches a ligament
or tendon to a bone. Examples include the attachments of the Achilles tendon
to os calcis, the origin of the finger extensor tendons at lateral humeral
epicondyle, the gluteus tendon insertion at the greater trochanter, or the
attachments of the patella ligament.

Axial SpA including ankylosing spondylitis
The diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) includes classical ankylosing
spondylitis (AS) as well as earlier stages and abortive courses of the disease, in
which (radiological evident) structural alterations have not yet occurred. Cases
of the latter might be also classified as non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA).
For a comparison of the ASAS criteria for classification for axSpA and
peripheral SpA, see Box 8.4 and Box 8.5.
Epidemiology of AS (on modified New York criteria or earlier definitions)
• There is an extensive wealth of data on the epidemiology of AS defined on
mNY and earlier criteria.

[SECTION]• Patients are typically <40 years of age with a M:F ratio of 3:1.
• The condition occurs most frequently in Caucasians.
• In Pima American Indians, where HLA-B27 prevalence is high, AS is
particularly frequent, whereas the condition is less common in African
Americans, and rarer still in sub-Saharan Africans, reflecting the low
prevalence of HLA-B27 in these groups.
• Prevalence estimate is 0.5–0.8/100,000 in Caucasian adults.
• Epidemiology data necessarily depend on patients satisfying criteria for
diagnosis that necessarily means they have had their disease a relatively long
time (to have radiographic changes at SIJs).
Epidemiology of axSpA
• One implication of this paradigm shift is that a definition of axSpA results in a
defined patient prevalence much higher than has been accepted for AS (based
on mNY criteria, for example).
• There is an evolving understanding of the prevalence of axSpA based on
ASAS criteria.
• Studies of modelling disease prevalence suggest that axSpA is considerably
more common than AS.
• It is likely that the frequency of axSpA patients in any given cohort of IBP or
chronic back pain patients, is higher than previously defined for an AS
definition (e.g. 29% of patients with IBP met the criteria for nr-axSpA and
39% of patients with chronic low back pain had IBP).1
Box 8.3 Modified New York (mNY) criteria for classifying AS
Clinical criteria
• Low back pain and stiffness for >6 months, improving with exercise, but not
relieved by rest.
• Limitation of lumbar spine movements in sagittal and frontal planes.
• Limitation of chest expansion relative to normal values for age and sex.
Radiological criteria
• Greater than or equal to grade 2 bilateral sacroiliitis.
• Grade 3 or 4 unilateral sacroiliitis
Combined diagnostic criteria
• Definite AS if radiological and clinical criterion.
• Probable AS if three clinical criteria or a radiological criterion without signs
or symptoms satisfying the clinical criteria.

Pathogenesis
HLA-B27 and genetics

[SECTION]• HLA-B27 is associated with the SpAs in 50–95% of patients. In most
populations, HLA-B27 is prevalent in about 10%.
• HLA-B27 is inherited as autosomal co-dominant: 50% of first-degree relatives
of probands with HLA-B27 possess the antigen.
• 5–10% of HLA-B27-positive people develop AS over time.
• 20% of people with HLA-B27 develop a reactive arthritis after bacterial
infection with Chlamydia or Salmonella.
• About 50% of patients with psoriatic or inflammatory bowel disease-related
spondylitis are HLA-B27 positive.
• 50% of non-Caucasians with AS are HLA-B27 positive (< the prevalence of
HLA-B27 in Caucasians with AS; 95%).
• Concordance in monozygotic twins is 70% vs 13% in dizygotic twins.
• HLA-B27 is found in up to 40% of cases of uveitis, even in the absence of
underlying rheumatic disease.
• There is an excess of HLA-B27 prevalence in patients presenting with isolated
aortic root or valve insufficiency.
• HLA-B27 has been found in 90% of males with a combination of aortic
regurgitation and conduction system abnormalities.
• Genotyping studies have shown two AS susceptibility loci in addition to HLAB27: ERAP1 and the gene encoding the IL-23 receptor. The former codes for
an aminopeptidase of the ER involved in trimming peptides to an optimal size
for binding to MHC class I molecules.
• HLA-B27 is probably relevant to pathogenesis by (possibly non-exclusive)
mechanisms currently summarized as either:
• allowing abnormally restricted T-cell immune responses to self-antigens or
arthritogenic peptides.
• itself misfolding during assembly and leading to endoplasmic reticulum
stress and autophagy responses.
• itself triggering innate T-cell, NK cell pro-inflammatory responses by
presenting on the cell surface as homodimers and being recognized by these
cells.
Immunopathology
• There is debate over whether one or a number of microorganisms contribute to
pathophysiology.
• Increased faecal carriage of Klebsiella aerogenes has been reported in patients
with established AS and may relate to exacerbation of both joint and eye
disease.
• There is increasing evidence that axSpA and AS are due to an abnormal host

[SECTION]response to the intestinal microbiota with involvement of Th17 cells, which
play a key role in maintaining mucosal immunity.
• This leads to production of various inflammatory cytokines including Il-12, Il23, Il-17, and TNFα which play key roles in the pathogenesis of enthesitis and
other inflammatory lesions.
• Th17 cells may be resident in tissues and activated there causing local tissue
inflammation and triggering local tissue changes.
Clinical features of axSpA and AS
• Hallmark features of axSpA are IBP, fatigue, and enthesitis.
• Most axSpA lesions occur at entheses, subenthesial bone (osteitis), in tendons
and synovium (see Plate 24).
• Typical entheses affected include plantar fascia origin at os calcis medial
calcaneal tubercle, Achilles insertions at os calcis, extensor digit tendon origin
at lateral humeral epicondyle, and gluteus medius insertion at greater
trochanter (see also Table 8.4).
• Synovitis can occur, typically in the larger peripheral joints (hips and knees in
particular). Though 20–40% of patients have peripheral joint disease at some
stage, studies have not previously shown whether the features are synovitis or
enthesitis or both.
• About 50% of patients with adult AS will develop hip arthritis.
• The standardized mortality ratio for AS is 1.5, due to cardiac valve and
respiratory disease, amyloidosis, and fractures.
• AS patients are high risk for having to alter or give up work.
• Although recognized as typical of AS, few patients progress to the classical
late ‘bamboo spine’.
• When spine segments do fuse in AS (syndesmophytes bridging the gap
between vertebral bodies), microfractures can occur leading to acute episodes
of severe pain.
• Spondylodiscitis is an uncommon though severe lesion: acute aseptic disc and
end-plate inflammation.
• The burden of spinal disease is typically variable chronic low-grade IBP and
stiffness with evidence of reduction in spinal mobility.
Non-musculoskeletal clinical features
• Constitutional features of fatigue, weight loss, low-grade fever, and anaemia
are common. Fatigue is often the most troublesome symptom for many
patients.
• IBD lesions are present in about 50% of AS patients though lesions are not

[SECTION]•

symptomatic in all patients.
Uveitis occurs in up to 40% of cases, but has little correlation with disease
activity in the spine.
There are no known triggers for uveitis and although self-limiting, topical, or
systemic steroids may be required in severe cases. The uveitis is
predominantly anterior and mostly unilateral.
Upper lobe, bilateral pulmonary fibrosis is a recognized but rare feature of AS.
Occasionally, the fibrotic area is invaded by Aspergillus with changes
mimicking tuberculosis.
In late AS, fusion of the thoracic wall leads to rigidity and reduction in chest
expansion. Ventilation is maintained by the diaphragm; however, there is a
threefold increased risk of death from a respiratory cause compared with the
normal population.
Cardiac involvement includes aortic incompetence, cardiomegaly, and
conduction defects. Of the 20% of AS patients with aortic valve disease, the
majority are clinically undetectable.
Neurological lesions are a rare consequence of spinal MSK disease: nerve root
entrapment and cauda equina syndrome.
Sterile urethritis is an under-recognized SpA lesion.
Renal involvement is rare but can be due to NSAID use (interstitial nephritis)
or renal amyloidosis.
Osteoporosis is an under-recognized finding:
• AS patients are at high risk of vertebral fracture.
• Micro-fractures may occur with trauma and fractures can occur through
syndesmophytes.
• Systemic osteoporosis occurs and is identifiable through hip and forearm
BMD measurement.
• Estimates of osteoporosis prevalence range from 20–60%, increasing with
age and disease duration.
• DXA evaluation of lumbar spine BMD will be inaccurate in advanced AS
due to the presence of syndesmophytes.
• Studies suggest that bone loss occurs early and during the acute
inflammatory stage of the disease.

Investigations in axSpA
• Systemic measures of acute-phase response are often detected though typically
also can be normal despite symptoms.
• Plain AP, or ‘coned’ view radiographs of the posterior pelvis are
conventionally used to detect established sacroiliitis.

[SECTION]• Radiographic SIJ changes may initially be asymmetric. Late changes include
subchondral sclerosis, erosions, and finally ankylosis.
• Conventional axial skeletal signs on spine and pelvis radiographs include
squaring of vertebrae, syndesmophytes, spinal ligament ossification, Romanus
lesions, pelvic enthesophytes, and osteitis pubis.
• Radiograph detection of syndesmophytes requires a distinction to be made
between DISH and AS syndesmophytes. Generally, DISH patients present
later than AS patients, have paramarginal syndesmophytes, frequently
asymmetric in thoracic spine and have OA (DISH may be associated with
chondrocalcinosis and CPPD disease).
• 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy is sensitive for SIJ inflammation, and scans can
identify significant peripheral skeletal lesions from a single study through
obtaining ‘spot’ peripheral views.
• CT provides excellent images of the SIJs and sensitively detects previous SIJ
lesions but cannot date the lesions and is not an investigation to use to detect
current inflammation.
• MRI of SIJs show active inflammatory lesions but subtle previous SIJ
pathology can be missed.
• MRI discriminates spinal DISH from AS in doubtful cases.
• Both fat-suppressed MRI and US can detect inflammation at entheses though
the absence of inflammatory ‘signal’ on MRI or Doppler signal on US, does
not rule out enthesis disease as part of SpA.
Disease status and prognostic indicators in axSpA/AS
There are validated instruments measuring disease status in AS including Bath
indices, ASAS response criteria, and quality of life indicators.
• Historically, for staging and monitoring AS, the Bath indices have been used
(devised in Bath, UK by Andrei Calin’s group):
• Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI).
• Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI; Box 8.6).
• Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI).
• Bath AS Radiology Index (BASRI) (see Table 8.1).
• The AS disease activity score (ASDAS) combines simplified self-reported
clinical indices with a measure of ESR or CRP. The performance of ASDAS to
discriminate low and high disease activity and cut-off values are quite similar
in
patients
with
AS
and
axSpA
(
http://www.asasgroup.org/clinicalinstruments/asdas_calculator/asdas.html).
• ASAS have defined response criteria for therapies used in AS.2 These
measures (ASAS 20, ASAS 40, ASAS 5/6; see Box 8.7) incorporate some

[SECTION]Bath measures, are increasing used and more widely validated (in an axSpA
definition of disease), and may update the BASDAI (alone) as favoured
disease (treatment) response measures.
• A number of quality of life measures can be used (e.g. ASQoL3).
• A number of enthesitis indices have been developed (Table 8.1). In clinical
practice, either MASES or SPARCC are most useful:
• The most frequently used radiographic index of skeletal spine changes is the
Modified Stoke AS Spinal Score. It is based on the degree of vertebral
erosion, sclerosis, and squaring and the presence of syndesmophytes and
their degree of vertebral bridging.
• MRI spinal osteitis scoring for research purposes: SPARCC index.
• The main predictive factors of poor outcome in AS are to be:
• hip involvement, early loss of lumbar spine mobility.
• oligoarticular disease; low social–educational background.
• sporadic disease rather than familial; onset <16 years; ESR >30.
• poor initial response to NSAIDs; presence of dactylitis.
Box 8.6 Measuring disease activity in AS and axSpA: Bath AS Disease
Activity Index (BASDAI) and AS disease activity score (ASDAS)
BASDAI description
The assessment comprises six questions. Patients score each as 0–10 on a
linear scale. Scores are weighted and a composite score is generated.
ASDAS description
On a 0–10 scale, the patient scores back pain, duration of morning stiffness,
their assessment of global disease, a score of peripheral pain and stiffness,
then a contribution of either CRP or ESR is added and a composite score is
generated.

Performance of indices
• In AS, BASDAI has long since been shown to have validity in
discriminating high and low disease activity in different populations and is
responsive to change over a practical duration of disease. BASDAI has
historically been adopted widely as a useful index of AS disease activity.

[SECTION]• ASDAS-CRP and ASDAS-ESR have similar performance to BASDAI in
discrimination of high and low disease activity, and change in disease
activity generally and with anti-TNFα therapy, both in AS and in axSpA.

General treatment
• UK NICE guideline for management of axSpA 2017.4
• Treatment principles are indicated and include the following:
• Patient education.
• Exercises (see http://www.nass.co.uk).
• Other physical therapy and hydrotherapy.
• Avoid smoking given its pro-inflammatory effects.
• NSAIDs for IBP and enthesitis.
• Oral glucocorticoid (GC) or IM methylprednisolone.
• With exercise the emphasis is placed on the need to maintain posture and
physical activity. Spinal extension exercises are important as the natural
history of the disease otherwise leads to spinal ‘stoop’, lack of back extension,
and loss of height.
• Physiotherapy provides benefit in the short term. Spa treatment improves

[SECTION]function for up to 9 months and reduces health resource use.
• Fatigue is not easily treated though some effort to improve sleep health and
maintain some aerobic exercise may play a positive role.
NSAIDs and synthetic DMARDs (sDMARDs)
• For the majority of patients, NSAIDs remain the treatment of choice. Regular
full-dose NSAID use is often required.
• Continuous, rather than intermittent NSAID (including COX-2 selective
NSAIDs) may slow radiographic progression of axial skeletal changes but the
research evidence overall is weak.
• Sulfasalazine (SSZ) has been shown in a meta-analysis to be efficacious when
compared with placebo for peripheral joint disease only. However,
improvement in symptoms and quality of life is not dramatic.
• Mixed results have been found with methotrexate. A Cochrane meta-analysis
concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support its use in AS. Benefit
may be limited to patients with peripheral disease.
• Joint inflammation can be managed in acute, severe cases with IA GC
injections.
• Care should be taken injecting GC around tendons, as rupture can occur if the
injection is placed into the tendon itself.
• Steroid injection around the Achilles tendon can help/is safe if there is
paratenon inflammation alone (preceding imaging advisable).
• Topical GC eye drops should be used to treat uveitis. If the symptoms persist
for >3 days an ophthalmological opinion should be sought.
• IV bisphosphonates can help spinal osteitis symptoms. Pamidronate 90 mg
monthly can be used. Zoledronic acid can resolve osteitis lesions for 3 months
in a majority of patients.
Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs)
• Anti-TNFα bDMARDs are effective in AS in reducing symptoms and
inflammation though there is debate on whether they can reduce the
progression of structural skeletal changes (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab,
certolizumab, and golimumab).
• In the UK, NHS anti-TNFα is recommended for treating ‘severe active’ AS in
adults whose disease has responded inadequately to, or who cannot tolerate,
NSAIDs. Infliximab is recommended only if treatment is started with the least
expensive infliximab product.
• Infliximab is licensed to treat AS at a dose of 5 mg/kg (compared with 3
mg/kg used in RA), though published data suggest AS can be frequently

[SECTION]•

treated to remission with 3 mg/kg dosing.
Remission of disease following anti-TNFα treatment is more common the
earlier in the disease course anti-TNFα is used. These consistent findings
highlight the need for early identification of AS and prompt treatment plan
implementation.
Evidence overall now supports the efficacy and safety of anti-TNFα in nraxSpA. Secukinumab is the first drug targeting the Il-17 pathway in
radiographic-axSpA (AS) that has shown efficacy.
Anti-TNFα therapy recommendations in UK (NICE TA383)5 are now
available based on the ASAS definition of nr-axSpA.
Secukinumab (monoclonal anti-IgG1 k ) is the first drug targeting the Il-17
pathway (it targets Il-17A) and is licensed to treat AS and PsA. At a dose of
150 mg (monthly SC after 4 initial weekly disease) it has shown efficacy in
two phase III RCTs (NNT to achieve ASAS40 response: 3–4).
Ustekinumab (monoclonal antibody targeting the common subunit of both Il12 and Il-23) and tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor) have shown positive results in
phase II/proof-of-concept trials.

Psoriatic arthritis
Epidemiology
Psoriasis (Ps) affects up to 3% of the population. The heterogeneity of clinical
features of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), the numerous classification criteria existing
for it historically, and until recently poor understanding of its lesions and their
detection, have implied great uncertainty in knowing the true prevalence of PsA
(see Box 8.8).
• Historic estimates of the prevalence of PsA suggest it is present in up to 40%
of patients with Ps. More conservative estimates suggest PsA occurs in about

[SECTION]10–20% of the Ps population (i.e. 0.5–1% of the whole population).
• However, estimates have not adequately considered the overall likely
prevalence of PsA in all its forms, and given obvious difficulties in identifying
PsA sine Ps and defining disease without peripheral joint synovitis (e.g.
enthesopathic forms and forms characterized by tendonitis and/or enthesitis
and/or spinal disease alone).
• The condition affects women and men equally with usual onset between the
ages of 20 and 40 years.
Box 8.8 CASPAR classification criteria for PsA
CASPAR updates previous criteria: Moll and Wright 1973; Vasey and
Espinoza 1984; Gladman 1987, McGonagle 1999, Fournie 1999.
Inflammatory articular disease (joint, spine or enthesis)
with ≥3 points from the following:
(1 point each unless stated)
• Current Ps (scores 2 points)
• History of Ps in 1st- or 2nd-degree relative
• Psoriatic nail dystrophy
• IgM RF negative*
• Current dactylitis
• History of dactylitis
• Juxta-articular new bone.**
* By any method except latex.
** Ill-defined ossification near joint margins (excluding osteophytes) on radiographs of hands or feet.

Pathophysiology
Genetics
• Ps is familial. There are about 40–50 genes which are associated with an
increased odds ratio of developing psoriasis.
• Genetic factors also have an important role in PsA and family studies have
suggested that the heritability may exceed 80%.
• Variants in the HLA-B and HLA-C genes are the strongest genetic risk factors
but other variants exist.
Immunopathogenesis
• Many variants overlap with those implicated in Ps where there may be >40
susceptibility loci, and lie within or close to genes in the IL-12, IL-23, and

[SECTION]•

NFκB signalling pathways.
It is thought that an environmental trigger, probably a microorganism, triggers
the disease in genetically susceptible people, leading to activation of dendritic
and T cells.
CD8+ T cells, which recognize antigen presented in the context of HLA class
I, are more abundant than CD4+ T cells within the joint which is in keeping
with the genetic association between PsA and HLA-C and -B variants.
Il-23/Il-17 pathway plays a pivotal role in PsA.
A triggering stimulus may cause over-production of Il-23 by dendritic cells,
which then promotes differentiation and activation of Th17 cells which
produce Il-17A.
Il-17A and Th1 cytokines such as IFNγ and TNFα, act on macrophages and
tissue-resident stromal cells at entheses, in bone, and within the joint to
produce additional proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators which
contribute to inflammation and tissue damage.

Clinical features
• Ps-related MSK symptoms can present with, before, or after the onset of Ps.
The situation for nail disease is the same. In some cases, gaps between
presentations of the different aspects of Ps disease can be many years. Some
patients can go through life with their PsA and never get Ps.
• MSK imaging research has shown lesions exist at entheses of tendon and
ligaments, in the nail bed, in bone, and on bone surfaces (adjacent to entheses,
probably periostea). Synovitis may well be a secondary lesion due to adjacent
enthesitis and by no means an essential lesion of PsA.
• Nail lesions are not always present but distinctive. Nail lesions occur in 40%
of patients with Ps alone. See Plate 8.
• Fatigue is a consistent and often severe symptom of Ps-related disease.
• Dactylitis, swelling of the whole finger, occurs in over one-third of classically
defined PsA patients.
• In about 20% of PsA cases there is a chronic, progressive, and deforming
arthropathy with an often-asymmetrical pattern including DIPJ involvement,
or arthritis mutilans, and/or polydactylitis and/or large joint deterioration.
• Some clinical patterns of PsA that have been written about historically are
listed as follows. However, it is probable that patterns do not always persist in
any individual and as yet no distinct genotype or immunopathological features
segregate in association with these descriptive patterns of disease:
• DIPJ predominant disease.
• Asymmetric oligoarthritis.

[SECTION]•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Symmetrical polyarthritis.
Spine predominant disease (estimates 2–40%).
Enthesopathic predominant disease.
Arthritis mutilans is a classic but uncommon manifestation of PsA. Bone
resorption leads to collapse of the soft tissue in the digits, creating
‘telescoping fingers’.
It is not clear, however, if the patterns of disease have any prognostic
significance in themselves.
Adverse prognostic factors in the 1995 Toronto cohort were polyarthritis,
greater HAQ, and increase in use of sDMARDs.
Persistent dactylitis is a marker of associated digit small joint deterioration.
The radiological features associated with PsA that help to differentiate it from
RA and inflammatory generalized OA include:
• absence of juxta-articular osteoporosis.
• absence of subchondral plate changes in early disease.
• DIPJ disease (with marginal changes initially and an absence of early
subchondral plate changes).
• ‘whittling’ (lysis) of terminal phalanges.
• asymmetry of joint involvement.
• ‘pencil-in-cup’ deformities.
• ankylosis.
• periostitis (often ‘fluffy’ juxta-articular periosteal new bone—see Plate
23).
• spondylitis (asymmetric ‘floating’ syndesmophytes, spondylodiscitis, facet
joint (FJ) changes—though FJ appearances in PsA are not at all well-defined
given a presumed common finding of OA affecting FJs and poor definition
to date of juxta-articular new bone in PsA FJs).

Clinical assessment in PsA
• The variation in clinical features between patients, the potential for multiple
MSK lesions, and involvement of spine structures has historically led to a
difficulty in establishing agreed and universal classification criteria for PsA
and consequently in designing applicable treatment outcome assessment tools
for PsA.
• Typically, assessments have been adopted from their use in RA. Some salient
points are:
• DAS68 should be used rather than DAS28 for assessing joint tenderness and
swelling.
• Though all have been developed for AS, different enthesitis indices (see

[SECTION]•

•

•

•

Table 8.4) can be applied to PsA.
• Though representing some methodological challenges, the PASI remains the
best assessment of Ps skin response to treatment.
Comprehensive PsA assessment requires an index (indices) to allow
measurement of the response of joint, tendon, enthesis, nail, spine, and skin
disease to treatment, but also to measure general health and function changes
capturing the effects of fatigue and mood.
Composite indices have been proposed. DAPSA: Disease Activity for
Psoriatic Arthritis; PsAJAI: Psoriatic Arthritis Joint Activity Index; CPDAI:
Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index. Indices have been summarized.6
The only enthesitis index which has been developed specifically for PsA is the
Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI). It scores six entheses scoring tenderness (1) or
no tenderness (0) at lateral humeral epicondyles, over medial femoral
condyles, and at Achilles insertions.
An index of minimal disease activity (MDA) has been proposed.7 A patient
with PsA is defined as having MDA when 5 of 7 of the following are present:
• Tender joint count ≤1.
• Swollen joint count ≤1.
• PASI ≤1 or BSA ≤3.
• Patient pain VAS ≤15/100.
• Patient global activity VAS ≤20/100.
• HAQ ≤0.5.
• Tender entheses ≤1.

The extended psoriasis-related disease comorbidities
• Comorbidities, which require screening for in Ps patients, include arterial
hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome,
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD), depression, nicotine abuse, alcohol
abuse, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and lymphoma.
• In the UK, screening Ps patients for PsA using PEST is currently
recommended ( http://www.bad.org.uk/library/).
• The association of metabolic syndrome with PsA in patients with or without Ps
is unknown.
• Hyperuricaemia is associated with Ps and PsA. An association of PsA with
gout has been recognized for a long time.
Treatment of PsA
General treatment
• Patient education about the various lesions of PsA, their relapsing and

[SECTION]•
•
•
•

remitting nature, and about the risk of long-term comorbidity risk is of
increasing importance.
Encouraging patient group participation may be helpful (e.g. in the UK:
PAPAA ( http;//www.papaa.org).
Localized lesions may respond to rest, ice, and physiotherapy.
Comorbidities need to be addressed: obesity, cardiovascular risk,
hyperuricaemia, depression (e.g. screen with HADS).
Physiotherapy assessment particularly if there is IBP.

NSAIDs and synthetic DMARDs (sDMARDs)
• Treatment is tailored to the site and number of MSK lesions.
• NSAIDs would be expected to help.
• sDMARDs have conventionally been reserved for patients who have
inflammatory disease threatening joint integrity; however, with multiple site
and/or severe symptoms, fatigue, Ps, and a potential impact from multiple
symptoms on function and contributing to comorbidities, many specialists
regard sDMARD therapy introduction wholly reasonable when based on such
symptom-based and ‘holistic-view’ criteria.
• Evidence for unequivocal sDMARD efficacy is not strong though some
evidence exists for methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide (LEF), and ciclosporin.
Evidence is weaker still for SSZ, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), gold,
penicillamine, and azathioprine (AZA).
• The first-line sDMARD choice of many rheumatologists for PsA remains
MTX. This is reflected in the EULAR guideline for managing PsA.8
• Essentially, the EULAR guide advocates:
• Phase 1: NSAIDs and GC injections.
• Judge phase 1 response against treatment target.
• If target not reached: phase 2—start MTX.
• If contraindications to MTX: start LEF.
• If target not reached: phase 3—start anti-TNFα.
• If axial disease alone, on failure of phase 1: start anti-TNFα.
• Many clinicians would advocate relevant efficacy only occurs at the higher
weekly doses of MTX (20–25 mg/week).
• HCQ can aggravate psoriasis (see Summary of Product Characteristics for the
drug).
• Oral and IM GCs might be generally avoided in patients with Ps because
although the skin disease responds, after the steroids there can be a rebound
worsening of skin disease.
• Good efficacy on joint disease in PsA is established with all anti-TNFα drugs;

[SECTION]•

•

however, criteria for study recruitment and judging outcome with all antiTNFα drugs has been set fairly conventionally and has focused on joints, and
therefore to a significant degree, on synovial disease (i.e. using ACR 20/50
outcome criteria or DAS28—both adopted from their development in
assessing RA, not PsA).
In the UK, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab (see NICE
Technology appraisal guidance TA199 and TA220)9, 10 are approved by NICE
for the treatment of PSA. All have positive effects on skin, as well as joint
disease.
For UK NHS funded anti-TNFα treatment, PsA patients need to have
peripheral arthritis with ≥3 tender and ≥3 swollen joints and have not
responded to, or failed to tolerate, at least two standard sDMARDs alone or in
combination.
• Essentially merging UK NICE requirements and EULAR guidance suggests
UK clinicians need to choose MTX first then LEF second, pre-anti-TNFα.
• In the UK, NICE requires anti-TNFα treated PsA patients are assessed at 12
weeks using validated outcome measures such as Psoriatic Arthritis
Response Criteria (PSARC) measurements.
• NICE rules do not require PsA patients to be simultaneously treated with
MTX while receiving anti-TNFα.
For patients with significant nail disease for whom topical (GC ± calcipotriol)
therapy has failed, treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, intralesional
steroid, ustekinumab, MTX and acitretin are recommended.
Certolizumab pegol has shown efficacy in PsA also with specific effect
demonstrated on different MSK lesions and nail disease; however, it is not
authorized for treatment in UK by NICE. Some concern has been raised11 that
this anti-TNFα drug is associated with greater risk for adverse effects
compared with other anti-TNFα drugs.
Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody which binds to, and neutralizes IL-23
(specifically binds the p40 subunit common to Il-12 and Il-23 preventing
receptor binding) has been licensed to treat Ps for some years.
Efficacy of ustekinumab in PsA importantly shows significant responses in
joint, dactylitis, and enthesitis extending to a year after treatment in phase III
trials.
In the UK, NICE has authorized use of ustekinumab for PsA patients who have
failed anti-TNFα.
The finding that Il-23 stimulated Th17 cell activation (including generating Il17) in SpAs and psoriasis has heralded a new approach to developing

[SECTION]bDMARDs targeting this immune activation pathway (e.g. the anti-Il-17A
monoclonal secukinumab in phase III development).
• Apremilast, an orally available small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase
4 (PDE4), was licensed by the FDA in the USA in 2014 and in the European
Union for treating PsA.
• In the UK, NICE has not authorized the use of apremilast (in the USA
marketed as Otezla® for Ps and PsA) for both Ps and PsA.
• Apremilast compares favourably to placebo in patients failing previous
sDMARD therapy in PsA but has not directly been compared with high-dose
MTX therapy alone. Apremilast is associated with frequent mild to moderate
adverse effects but also weight loss, worsening depression, and suicidal
ideation.

SpA-associated reactive arthritis
Background and clinical features
• SpA-associated reactive arthritis (ReA) is a (‘lesion-aseptic’, i.e. lesions not
directly infected) inflammatory condition affecting spine and axial skeletal
structures, joints, tendons, and entheses triggered by infection with certain
bacteria including Chlamydia, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia,
and possibly also Clostridia, Ureaplasma, and Mycoplasma.
• The risk of developing ReA after having one of these infections is ~1–4%
generally but 20–25% in people who are HLA-B27 positive.
• Non-SpA-associated ReA can occur after viruses (particularly parvovirus) and
Streptococcus (β-haemolytic), gonococcus, HIV, Borrelia (Lyme disease),
Mycobacterium (Poncet’s disease) and possibly other pathogens but the
characteristics of ReA following these infections are not SpA-like in clinical

[SECTION]•

features nor immunopathology and have no association with HLA-B27.
SpA-associated ReA is basically an acute form of SpA. Indeed, it is possible
that ReA is the triggering event in developing long-term SpA—a semantic
issue perhaps when considering the alternative—‘chronic ReA’, which
historically is regarded to occur in a small minority of patients with acute ReA.
A high index of suspicion of sexually acquired ReA (SARA) is required
particularly in women where genital Chlamydia infection can be asymptomatic
in up to 50%.
The onset of reactive arthritis is usually acute with systemic symptoms and
inflammatory MSK symptoms.
Differential diagnosis includes septic arthritis, gout, and other SpAs.
Non-MSK symptoms worth noting are mucocutaneous features including
painless circinate balanitis of the glans penis, conjunctivitis, and pustular
psoriasis of the palms or feet (keratoderma blennorrhagica).
In GI infection-triggered ReA, the acute GI symptoms may precede the MSK
symptoms by 1–4 weeks:
• Initial GI symptoms may be so mild as to be ignored by the patient and often
the provoking bacterium has cleared from the gut before the MSK
symptoms arise.
• Persistent bowel symptoms, particularly pain and diarrhoea should raise
suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease.
Recurrent or repeated infections do not always lead to a recurrence of ReA
MSK lesions and, in the case of SARA, may occur in the absence of further
sexual intercourse.

Investigation of SpA-associated ReA
• Acute-phase response measures are invariably high.
• If SARA is suspected from symptomatic urethritis, prostatitis, or cervicitis, or
if suspicion of SARA is high based on MSK and non-genitourinary (GU)
symptoms alone, referral for rigorous GU investigation is recommended.
• With triggering bowel infections, often by the time ReA is apparent, then stool
culture will likely be negative.
• Serological evidence of recent Yersinia or Campylobacter can be sought
(IgM+) but often delays from initial infection to ReA issues with assay
specificity impede use. For example, recent parvovirus B19 infection leads to
false-positive ELISAs for a number of these pathogens.
• Serology for Chlamydia infection—C. pneumoniae or C. trachomatis—is not
recommended.
• Radiographs are of limited use. The distribution of inflammatory lesions at

[SECTION]SIJs, joints, and entheses can be confirmed with bone scintigraphy.
• Lumbar spinous processes and posterior pelvis MRI may show typical SpA
inflammatory lesions (osteitis, sacroiliitis, enthesitis).
• Regional MSK US may be useful in selected cases (e.g. of ‘hindfoot’ may
show enthesitis at Achilles insertion, plantar fascia origin, any synovitis, and
its site and fluid can be aspirated under US guidance for Gram stain and
culture and for polarized light microscopy examination, to rule out gout).
Management of SpA-related ReA
• NSAIDs and local joint or enthesis GC injections are the mainstay of
therapeutic intervention.
• If symptoms persist >6 months and there is clinical evidence of ongoing
synovitis and joint destruction, then a synthetic DMARD (sDMARD) such as
SSZ or methotrexate may be considered.
• Physiotherapy should be considered if there is persistent IBP.
• The majority of patients are in complete remission at the end of 2 years of
sDMARD therapy, most within 6 months.
• Balanitis and keratoderma may persist—predictors of poor prognosis. Other
factors that may be predictive of poor outcome include arthritis of the hip,
persistently raised ESR, B27 positivity, poor response to NSAIDs, dactylitis,
and lumbosacral spine involvement.
• Aseptic urethritis and early conjunctivitis resolve quickly and spontaneously.
• Antibiotic therapy will clear underlying infections, but this may not have any
effect on the duration of ReA disease.
• Uveitis should be treated in the usual way with topical steroid drops and a
referral to an ophthalmologist if there has been no response within 3 days.
• Patient education, particularly in the context of food hygiene and prevention of
exposure to sexually acquired infection, is important. Contact tracing is vital in
cases of sexually transmitted infection.
• Anti-TNFα is reserved for cases of sDMARD failure. In the UK, there are no
specific NICE guidelines for treating SpA-related ReA.

Inflammatory bowel disease-related SpA
Clinical presentation
• The clinical characteristics of inflammatory MSK symptoms presenting in
patients with active Crohn’s disease and (ulcerative) colitis are often typical of
SpA lesions and occur, broadly speaking considering all studies, in a sizeable
minority of IBD patients.

[SECTION]• Epidemiology data depend on whether patient groups are defined first by their
IBD or by their SpA.
• In one series of IBD patients, sacroiliitis was present in 17% detected by MRI;
though of note, non-inflamed, non-current SIJ disease may be missed by MRI.
• By contrast, when AS or axSpA patients are investigated for IBD rigorously,
bowel lesions are seen in about 50% of patients.
• Whether IBD-related SpA is distinct from axSpA (new ASAS definition) will
need to be established; however, pre-ASAS axSpA definition, many, if not all
IBD-related SpA patients might be classified using the ESSG criteria for SpA.
• In summary, there is still some uncertainty as to whether all cases of IBDrelated arthritis are true SpAs.
• The association of the inflammatory arthritis with IBD is arguably stronger
with Crohn’s disease than with UC. The association might be more visible
given the likelihood that the correlation between activity of IBD and severity
of MSK symptoms is greater for Crohn’s than it is for UC.
• In Crohn’s-associated inflammatory arthritis/SpA, the arthritis tends to remit
after surgical removal of diseased bowel tissue or tight control of enteric
inflammation.
• It is observed that MSK symptoms associated with IBD are greater if the
integrity of the ileocecal valve is lost. Speculatively, then, it may be that
bacterial colonization of previously bacteria-free small bowel is a key trigger
in pathogenesis of the SpA.
• Lesions can be discordant by some years. IBD can evolve (sometimes years)
following the onset of SpA (e.g. see reference 12).
• Non-MSK extra-intestinal features of IBD include:
• aphthous stomatitis.
• fatigue.
• anaemia.
• uveitis (in about 10%).
• erythema nodosum.
• pyoderma gangrenosum.
Management of IBD-related SpA
• NSAIDs are usually contraindicated if there is known IBD.
• IA or IM GCs are used relatively early in the disease course given the
avoidance of NSAIDs.
• Mesalazine and AZA, used to treat IBD, is not recognized for its effect on
MSK symptoms but SSZ and MTX do have effect. Their use may require
liaison with the gastroenterologist as mesalazine/AZA needs to be

[SECTION]discontinued in most cases.
• Anti-TNFα choices need to be made carefully given both SpA and IBD lesions
in relevant patients. Etanercept has no efficacy in IBD.
• The use of anti-TNFα in UK NHS patients with IBD-related SpA requires
qualification for funding for treatment based on either AS, PsA, or IBD criteria
alone.

Juvenile spondyloarthritis
Epidemiology and classification
• Juvenile SpA (JSpA) is an ‘umbrella’ term encompassing a group of diseases
with shared genetic predisposition that affect children <16 years of age.
• The classification of JSpA (International League of Associations for
Rheumatology (ILAR); Table 8.7) accepted by most is:
• enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA).
• juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA), which can be sub classified into SpA
similar to PsA in adults or peripheral arthritis similar to ANA-positive JIA.
• undifferentiated SpA (if ERA and JPsA features are present).
• Juvenile PsA and ERA are classifiable using the ILAR classification endorsed
by WHO in 1999 (see Table 8.2, p. 318).
• Other JSpAs not specifically accounted for in the ILAR classification include
juvenile AS (JAS) who fulfil the mNY criteria before they are 16 years,
reactive arthritis, and IBD-related SpA.
• Estimates of JSpA prevalence are based on data for JIA and do not include
JAS.
• ERA and JPsA together account for 10–20% of JIA, which gives an estimated
2–60 cases per 100,000 children.
• Of adults with AS, 8–15% have onset in childhood.
• JSpA mostly occurs in late childhood or adolescence with peak onset at 12
years; 60% are male.
• Approximately 50% of JSpA patients are HLA-B27 positive and 20% have a
family history of HLA-B27-associated disease.
• Rheumatoid factor and ANA characteristically are negative.
Clinical presentation

[SECTION]• Arthritis is usually oligoarticular, asymmetric, and primarily of the lower
extremity.
• Hip and midfoot arthritis are suggestive of JSpA and dactylitis is typical of
JPsA.
• Enthesitis is present in 66–82% of JSpA patients, affecting mainly the inferior
pole of the patella, Achilles tendon insertion, plantar fascia origin and
insertions at metatarsal heads, and gluteus medius insertion into the greater
trochanter.
• Axial involvement at onset occurs in 10–24% of children frequently presenting
as sacroiliac pain and stiffness.
• Two-thirds of MRI-positive sacroiliitis may be asymptomatic.
• By age 10 years, two-thirds of JSpA patients have axial disease.
• Other manifestations include acute anterior uveitis (unilateral painful red eye
with photophobia in 25% of children over time), bowel inflammation,
psoriasis, nail pitting, and, rarely, cardiac disease.

Approach to diagnosis
• There is no standardized enthesitis index for paediatric patients.
• Recent evidence suggests a role for whole-body MRI as enthesitis can be
overestimated in children by physical examination.
• Typical clinical findings in JSpA include:
• insidious onset of low back pain with morning stiffness of >30 min that
improves with exercise.
• tenderness on direct compression over the SIJ.
• decreased lumbar flexion.
• positive

(
http://www.physiopedia.com/FABER_Test).
• MRI utility in asymptomatic and symptomatic disease is unclear. Correlation
of positive MRI findings with symptomatic improvement on bDMARD
therapy has yet to be shown. Gadolinium enhancement of MRI is preferred by
some paediatric centres.
• Where JSpA fulfils the New York criteria for AS, a diagnosis of juvenile AS is
made.
Management of JSpA
• JSpA conditions, like all forms of JIA, can be severely debilitating and places
a heavy physical and psychological burden on children and families affected
by the disease. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) support is essential.
• The principles of treatment include patient and parental education, physical
therapy, splints, orthotics, NSAIDs, and IA GC for peripheral arthritis.
• With joint involvement, there is a high risk of permanent joint contractures
with persistent disease. Intensive physiotherapy and judicious use of IA steroid
is important.
• Treatment guidelines for JIA, including JSpA, have been published by the
American College of Rheumatology.
• MTX, SSZ, and LEF are used for peripheral arthritis, but efficacy for
enthesitis and axial disease has not been fully assessed in ERA.
• Response to anti-TNFα therapy appears to be similar to that of AS and axSpA

[SECTION]in adults. It is not clear whether treatment halts progression of structural
damage.
• Drugs that target Il-12/23 and Il-17 may have a role in JSpA treatment but are
not yet approved in JSpA or JIA.
Outcome of JSpA
• JSpA may have a poorer overall prognosis than JIA and <20% of patients
experience disease remission within 5 years.
• Persistent disease activity is associated with midfoot arthritis/disease, hip
arthritis with 6 months of disease onset, family history of AS, HLA-B27, and
HLA-DRB1*08.

Introduction
Inflammatory arthritis, resulting in stiffness, swelling, joint restriction and
damage, was characterized in children in 1896 by GF Still and is now recognized
as one of the commonest causes of disability in childhood. Juvenile idiopathic
arthritis (JIA) is the ‘umbrella’ term, accepted by the international community,
for several forms of arthritis (summarized into subtypes for practical terms in
Table 9.1; for JSpA conditions there are many similarities with adult
presentations, see Chapter 8).
Epidemiology
• JIA affects 1 in 1000 children and young people up to 16 years of age, from
best available UK estimates and has similar prevalence to diabetes (1 in 700).
More recent international studies indicate a higher prevalence of 167–400 per
100,000 person-years.
• The annual incidence of JIA is ~1 in 10,000 children/young people.
• A majority of patients with JIA have a phenotype distinct from adult
inflammatory arthritis which includes an association with uveitis.
• The diagnosis of JIA requires the presence of arthritis for 6 weeks to
distinguish it from reactive arthritis etc.; however, the treatment of JIA and
referral to ophthalmology should not wait 6 weeks.
• In most forms of JIA, there is inflammation of the joint lining (synovium).

[SECTION]Circulating activated lymphocytes migrate into joints and the resulting
generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines leads to activation of macrophages
and joint stromal cells (e.g. fibroblasts) similar to that seen in adult RA. In
affected joints, there is excess cytokine production, of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-17.
Classification
The classification of JIA was radically changed in 2001. For years, there was
confusion between North America and European conventions for naming the
different forms of juvenile arthritis.
• Classification has been subsequently complicated in practice by the evolving
understanding of the breadth of effects in the spondyloarthritis (SpA)
conditions.
• We include juvenile SpA also in Chapter 8.

Diagnosing arthritis in children
There are no diagnostic tests for JIA. Diagnosis requires a thorough history and
examination to distinguish JIA from other causes of joint pain or swelling (Table
9.2).
• Inflammatory arthritis in children is characterized by prolonged morning
stiffness (typically >20 min), swelling, restriction, and loss of joint function.
• JIA should be considered when:
• joint swelling from presumed trauma (including knee and ankle) persists
beyond 2 weeks.
• there is involvement of several joints.
• aspirated joint fluid is shown to be aseptic.
• there is morning stiffness.
• there is joint restriction in the absence of a mechanical lesion.
• Careful examination aims to confirm swelling, which may be subtle, identify
joint restriction (typical of actively inflamed joints in children) and establish
the distribution of affected joints.
• Quick and methodical assessment of other joints is achieved using pGALS

[SECTION]•
•
•
•

•

(see Chapter 1, ‘The paediatric GALS screen’).
The examination technique of specific joints uses a systematic approach
identified in pREMS ( http://www.pmmonline.org).
Abnormal signs which might reveal JIA summarized from a typical detailed
regional examination are shown in Table 9.3.
Involvement of multiple joints increases the likelihood that arthritis is JIA,
especially in the absence of systemic symptoms.
Juxta-articular changes in JIA include muscle atrophy, leg length discrepancy
due to limb overgrowth from knee involvement, reduced limb length from
early closure of growth plates adjacent to inflammation during adolescence,
and synovial cysts.
SoJIA presents with systemic features and the differential diagnosis is wide so
a broad approach to assessment and investigations is essential (Table 9.4).

Differences from adult arthritis
• Arthritis in children directly affects limb growth and may have an overall
effect on height and weight attainment.
• Joint restriction is often a more sensitive sign of inflammatory joint disease
activity in children than it is in adults.
• With effective disease control and before puberty there is a likelihood of repair
of joint damage.
• Medication has to account for body size and different pharmacodynamics and
pharmacokinetics.
• Blood monitoring of medications use is frequently different.

Investigations
At presentation, investigations help distinguish differential diagnoses since there
are no diagnostic tests for JIA.
• ESR and CRP do not correlate well with the extent or severity of inflammation
and may be normal.
• A particularly high ESR may indicate the presence of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) or (very rarely) leukaemia.
• A low haemoglobin may indicate anaemia of chronic disease rather than iron
deficiency.
• ANA positivity occurs in 40–75% of JIA patients and indicates an increased
risk of eye disease. It is not a diagnostic test or predictive of outcome.
• Rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity is rare in JIA and difficult to interpret in
oligoarticular JIA. High titre ANA and RF may indicate SLE.
• US is the radiological investigation of choice to corroborate arthritis and
evaluate tenosynovitis and joint damage. Its false-negative rate is higher in
foot and ankle disease than for other joints.
• Radiographs may show soft tissue swelling, periarticular osteopenia. and
erosions in long-standing arthritis.
• Arthroscopy should be avoided unless a biopsy is required as in PVNS.
• Synovial fluid aspiration, but not arthroscopy, is essential when considering
sepsis and TB.
• To monitor disease activity, drug therapy and tissue damage:
• ESR and CRP frequently do not reflect the extent or severity of
inflammation.
• A falling ESR and haemoglobin with climbing ALT/AST may indicate
macrophage activation syndrome (see Chapter 25) as may a ferritin level
>10,000 ng/mL.
• US is used to monitor changes in synovial inflammation and joint damage
but contrast-enhanced MRI may provide more useful images including the
presence of bone oedema.
• Monitoring of drug side effects includes the measurement of FBC and LFTs.

Treatment
The overall approach to treatment in JIA is to gain early rapid control of
inflammation, minimize the adverse effects of treatment, and support the general
physical and mental health of the patient. This patient-centred holistic approach
requires the participation of a full multidisciplinary team—each member with

[SECTION]dedicated experience of JIA.
Treatment of the acute swollen joint
The management of the acute swollen joint should primarily focus on ruling out
sepsis (see Chapter 25, pp. 708–709).
• Ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, or other NSAIDS, should be used, especially
when waiting for a paediatric rheumatology review.
• For an effective NSAID response (managing inflammation as opposed to
simply pain), the recommended dosing frequency should be continued for >2
weeks +/– gastroprotection.
• IA glucocorticoids (GCs) can be considered for:
• limp, disability, joint restriction, other complications of arthritis.
• persistently marked joint swelling.
• a bridging strategy whilst awaiting long-term medication to become
effective.
• Oral or IV GCs should be used to supplement, or as an alternative, to IA GC, if
there are many joints involved or joint injections therapy is not immediately
feasible or the effect of IA GCs has been tried and was limited.
Long-term management of JIA
• Long-term management of JIA requires close collaboration between members
of the MDT with effective communication both within the service and across
the regional network.
• Members of the MDT include a clinical nurse specialist, physiotherapist,
occupational therapist, orthotist or podiatrist, ophthalmology colleagues,
musculoskeletal radiologist, psychologist, social work, and dietetic support.
• Medication forms only a part of the long-term management of JIA.
• Fundamental is the promotion of physical activity which encourages a return
of the strength and stamina lost from active arthritis, and correction of
muscular imbalances that result in pain, injury, and loss of joint protection.
• Provision of information and education for parents and patients is a constant
requirement. This is critical for their participation in joint decision-making and
adherence to agreed treatment plans and helps dissipate lingering anxiety.
• Pain management frequently involves strategies other than the use of
medication.
• Vaccination advice is usually given at the outset and changes in national
guidelines (August 2017) indicate that it is safe to give live vaccines to
patients before treatment or whilst on low to moderate doses of GCs and
csDMARDs
(

[SECTION]•

http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/655225/Green
In individual cases, giving live vaccines even if immunosuppression is being
taken far outweighs the risks. All routine non-live vaccines may be given
without complication.
Effective liaison is required with schools, primary care, and community
services.
Effective transition, which includes age-appropriate services for young people
from puberty onwards, is also an essential requirement to optimize the wellbeing and self-efficacy of this age group. This should continue well after
transfer to adult services.
A healthy diet avoids some of the problems of growth restriction or delay and
excess weight gain from low physical activity or GC use.
Although close collaboration with orthopaedics ensures timely referral of
patients and good medical management of orthopaedic conditions, the rate of
surgical intervention in JIA has greatly diminished.
Surgical synovectomy, soft tissue release (tenotomies and capsulotomies) and
joint replacement are now rare.

Long-term medication in JIA
The aim of medication in the long term is to reduce the frequency and impact of
flares of arthritis and uveitis.
• Long-term medications in the form of (synthetic) disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs) are used for:
• Persistent arthritis or uveitis refractory to, or incompletely controlled by, IA
or periocular GCs.
• Presence of chronic complications or tissue damage.
• Extension to other joints or eye.
• Joint-specific effects on the wrist and hand function, the hip and mobility, or
jaw.
• sDMARD treatments typically take a few weeks to become effective and may
require a bridging course of GCs either IA, orally, or IV.
• Given the extensive support and experience required, sDMARDs are best
instituted by a specialist service or delegated responsibility to secondary care
within a clinical network.
• There is now extensive experience of the valuable role of primary care in
monitoring treatment with the back-up of an accessible secondary or tertiary
service.
• The standard sDMARD used in JIA and uveitis is methotrexate (MTX).
• MTX in SC form, rather than tablets or liquid preparations, is typically used in

[SECTION]•

the young child and where there is extensive or severe inflammation.
Alternative sDMARDS for arthritis include leflunomide (LEF), sulfasalazine
(SSZ), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
Azathioprine (AZA) and ciclosporin may have a role in both arthritis and
uveitis, whereas mycophenolate and tacrolimus are considered to have a
specific role in uveitis.
The value of sDMARD combinations is not well studied in JIA but are used
with good effect in some patients and have not been shown to have increased
levels of adverse effects.
Biologic DMARD (bDMARD) therapies including anti-TNFα therapies have
been shown in high-quality studies to be effective in JIA and are now a
standard treatment in the presence of refractory disease to or intolerance of
MTX or other sDMARDs:
• In the UK, there is NHS (NICE) approval for the use of abatacept (a fusion
protein of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyteassociated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) linked to a modified Fc portion of IgG1), the
anti-TNFα therapies adalimumab and etanercept, and tocilizumab (an antiIL-6 receptor monoclonal bDMARD) in JIA. In England there is also an
agreement with NHSE to use anakinra, infliximab and rituximab under
certain conditions.
• bDMARD use in England is directed by NICE and NHSE (
http://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/wpcontent/uploads/sites/12/2015/10/e03pd-bio-therapies-jia-oct15.pdf).
Supplementary medications include those for pain, gastritis, and nausea and to
optimize bone density and strength in the presence of GCs or reduced physical
activity.

Outcome and prognosis
Given the progress in management strategies and advent of bDMARD therapies,
old published outcome data will no longer be applicable. Current paediatric
rheumatologist consensus is that there has been a marked improvement in
outcome and many patients.
• The incidence of joint replacement has reduced considerably from reports in
the early 2000s when 80% of patients with RF-positive JIA followed up over a
period of 20 years required arthroplasty.
• There is strikingly little high-quality data measuring long-term remission off
medication.
• About 50–75% of patients with persistent oligo-JIA will achieve long-term
remission by their early teens but may still experience flares at any time in

[SECTION]•
•

•

•

adulthood.
About 20–30% of patients with (RF and ACPA) seronegative polyarticular-JIA
achieve drug-free long-term remission into adulthood.
The concept of minimal disease activity has only recently been validated in
JIA and may be a better outcome variable for those patients who do not
achieve complete remission.
Despite changes in treatment strategies and outcome, suboptimal outcomes do
occur and are associated with:
• delayed diagnosis.
• delayed referral to a specialist MDT.
• suboptimal control of active disease.
• inadequate engagement and collaboration with the patient, parent, or other
carers (see psychology support later in this list).
• presentation with uveitis and ocular damage.
• ongoing disease activity in systemic-onset JIA (SoJIA) at 6 months.
• SoJIA in males.
• young age of onset in oligoarticular and polyarticular disease.
• psoriatic arthritis.
• hip involvement.
• rapid early onset of JIA in small joints of hands and feet.
• in association with early radiographic changes.
Psychology support improves outcome by:
• reducing the impact of MTX-associated nausea.
• reducing the impact of fear and anxiety around diagnosis and treatment.
• identifying, managing, and referring any mental health concerns.
• alleviating factors that adversely impact on quality of life and engagement
with school.
• addressing adverse body image concerns.
• managing the frustration or disappointment of persistent or flaring disease
activity and side effects from medication.

Transition services
‘Transition’ means, and hopes to achieve, the seamless and appropriate care
transfer from paediatric/adolescent services to a young-adult or adult service.
The development of age-appropriate clinics is a well-regarded strategy to reduce
the barriers to effective treatment.
• A transition service is achieved through optimizing engagement of adolescents
or young adults, promotion of self-efficacy, and enhancement of self-advocacy

[SECTION]and adherence to agreed management plans.
• Many centres now offer adolescent clinics for patients aged from 10–13 years
to 17–18 years and young adult clinics for those aged 17–25 years.
• The implementation and optimization of adolescent and young persons’ clinics
requires:
• close collaboration between paediatric and adult clinicians.
• age-specific nursing expertise.
• age-appropriate environment and information resources.
• that the patient be seen (first) without parents present.
• the promotion of an understanding of confidentiality and consent (or assent).
• the promotion of effective health-related behaviours including joint
decision-making, self-advocacy, and self-efficacy.
• support for the attendance and performance at school, college, and
university and when seeking employment.
• the early identification of mental health problems that may be a barrier to
care.
• respect for developing body awareness.
• assistance with family planning and sexual health.
• early anticipation of any surgical needs.
• Guidelines to support the development of young person clinics include You’re
Welcome Quality Criteria (Department of Health) and Transition to Adult
Care: Ready Steady Go (University of Southampton).

JIA subtypes and their specific features
Oligoarticular JIA (oligo-JIA)
• Oligo-JIA is the commonest subtype, accounting for 30–40% of JIA and is
characterized by the risk of uveitis. See Table 9.1
• It predominantly affects females with peak ages of onset between 2 to 4 years
and 7 to 13 years.
• About 50% of cases are monoarticular in presentation.
• If >4 joints become involved after 6 months of disease activity the condition is
reclassified as extended oligo-JIA.
• Extension to polyarticular JIA is more likely in those with uveitis and rare
beyond 5 years from diagnosis.
• The commonest joints involved are elbow, knee, and ankle.
• Joint or a limb deformity is of great concern in the growing patient.
• Leg length discrepancy is more common when arthritis of the knee begins <3

[SECTION]•

•
•
•

years of age. To accommodate for the excess length, the child stands with the
knee flexed resulting in a flexion contracture.
Hip monoarthritis or primary coxitis can occur especially in peripubertal Asian
girls, but a search to rule out other causes is essential. The following should be
considered: septic arthritis, leukaemia (e.g. in an at-risk population such as
Down’s syndrome), psoriatic arthritis, IBD-associated arthritis, and juvenile
SpA.
Studies have shown that over 80% of patients have little or no disability or
joint damage after 15 years of follow-up.
The HLA associations with oligo-JIA include HLA-DRB1*08 with additional
susceptibility haplotypes HLA-DRB*1103/1104.
HLA-DRB1*0401, found in RA, is protective for selected subtypes of JIA.

Polyarticular JIA (poly-JIA)
• Poly-JIA is diagnosed when >4 joints are involved within the first 6 months of
disease activity (excluding psoriatic arthritis, IBD-associated arthritis, and
enthesitis related arthritis).
• Pragmatically, decision-making for extended oligo-JIA is similar to that for
poly-JIA and long-term data indicates a similar outcome.
• A polyarticular course occurs in 20–30% of JIA and is subdivided by the
presence or absence of RF, which should be checked (on latex) on two
occasions at least 3 months apart.
• RF positive JIA occurs in <5% of JIA, is most common in females and has a
phenotype very similar to RA in adults.
Rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular JIA
• In RF-negative poly-JIA there is often incomplete control of arthritis despite
major advances in treatment.
• RF-negative poly-JIA is associated with higher levels of disability especially
during flares of the arthritis.
• Joint restriction often indicates disease activity and is commonly associated
with muscle atrophy, disability, and joint damage.
• There is a poly-JIA phenotype with boggy synovitis that is not associated with
much pain or disability and joints are commonly well preserved. Tenosynovitis
can coexist with joint synovitis and can remain undisclosed unless suspected.
• Another poly-JIA subtype is characterized by predominantly foot and ankle
involvement, the consequences of which can be a reduction in generalized
mobility, tarsal fusion, tenosynovitis, and bursitis.
• TMJ involvement is often insidious in onset. It is unlikely to be missed if

[SECTION]pGALS (see
Chapter 1) is undertaken at each clinic visit. If left
undertreated, TMJ arthritis may result in micrognathia and dental
malocclusion.
• Neck involvement can cause marked irritability and be particularly disabling
in the classroom. Occupational therapy assessment is advisable.
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA)
• JPsA is considered as one of the juvenile spondyloarthritides (JSpA; see
Chapter 8; and for ILAR diagnostic criteria see Chapter 8, p. 318).
• Features of JPsA are similar to adult PsA (see Chapter 8, p. 318).
• JPsA should be considered even if there is no psoriasis but there is a history of
psoriasis in a first-degree relative.
• Nail pitting, dactylitis, previous or concurrent acute panuveitis, and
inflammatory back pain history may be present.
• JPsA can be oligo- or polyarticular.
• JPsA is frequently resistant to conventional treatment strategies including GC
resistance.
Juvenile spondyloarthritis (JSpA) and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA)
• See Chapter 8 for additional detail.
• JSpA should only be considered in patients older than 6 years, especially
males, and when there is asymmetric large joint involvement.
• Enthesitis is the inflammation at the sites of bony insertion of tendons and
ligaments. In ERA, enthesitis can be very painful and disproportionate to
examination findings.
• HLA-B27 is found in 30–50% of ERA patients and is associated with an
increased risk of developing juvenile ankylosing spondylitis.
• ERA is generally associated with a low-grade grumbling disease persisting
into adulthood but associated with little erosive joint disease.
• In a minority of patients with ERA there may be high levels of disability
responsive to anti-TNFα therapy.
Systemic-onset JIA (SoJIA)
This form of JIA, presenting with fever and rash, affects just 5–8% of the JIA
population. A broad approach to diagnosis is essential—many conditions can
present with MSK pains, rash, and systemic symptoms.
• SoJIA is best considered as an umbrella term that covers several
autoinflammatory disorders (see Chapter 18 and Table 18.1, p. 544) and
poly-JIA triggered by or presenting with a viral infection.
• Previously known as ‘Still’s disease’, this term is now discouraged due to the

[SECTION]confusion it may cause.
• Incidence: M = F. SoJIA occurs at any age including infants with peak onset
between 2 and 3 years old.
• Typically: high levels of IL-1 and IL-6 in serum and synovial fluid.
Diagnosis of SoJIA
• No specific diagnostic tests exist.
• There is a broad differential diagnosis that requires assessment by a paediatric
rheumatologist.
• Many of the characteristic features including fever, rash, polyarthritis,
lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly overlap with other conditions (see
Table 9.4).
• Similarly, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia can present with fever, rash, and
joint/limb pains (attributable to marrow invasion).
• Neuroblastoma should be considered in patients <5 years old.
• A history of travel and contact with animals or tics should be taken.
• True persistent joint inflammation may not be found at diagnosis or for many
months (up to 9 years old) after diagnosis.
• The fever, of up to 39°C, is typically quotidian—occurring once or twice per
day in a diurnal distribution with return to a normal baseline between fever
spikes.
• Typical blood results include high ESR and CRP, neutrophilia (of the order of
20 × 109/L), thrombocytopenia (often >600 × 109/L), and anaemia of chronic
inflammation (often <80 g/L).
Treatment of SoJIA
The initial treatment of SoJIA focuses on the need to allow time for
investigations to exclude other causes of fever and manage pain and disability.
• A trial of NSAIDs for 2 weeks is used initially, though NSAIDs may have no
effect on serositis, or florid polyarthropathy.
• SoJIA is a GC-responsive condition, but there’s little evidence that GCs alter
the long-term outcome.
• GCs may be used once other conditions have been ruled out. A short or limited
course of GCs may be used to temporize pain, fatigue, and disability to see if
inflammation of a post-infectious origin settles on its own.
• GCs provide effective symptomatic relief while waiting for a sDMARD
(typically MTX) response.
• Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) are used when:
• unable to wean off GCs despite use of MTX.

[SECTION]•
•
•
•

• MAS is persistent.
• when a flare of joint pains/disease occurs despite MTX being taken at a
therapeutic dose for >3 months.
If SoJIA is unresponsive to anakinra (an anti-IL-1 bDMARD) after 4 weeks
treatment, then treatment should be switched to tocilizumab.
Tocilizumab is recommended in the UK by NICE.
Anti-TNFα therapy can be used for children with a polyarticular course of
SoJIA once systemic features have settled.
Other less routine treatments for SoJIA include ciclosporin, canakinumab,
IVIg, and stem cell transplantation in severe disease.

Macrophage activation syndrome
Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is rare but is life-threatening (mortality
is 8–22%). MAS can complicate other diseases. MAS is also termed secondary
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). For a summary see
http://www.the-rheumatologist.org/article/macrophage-activationsyndrome/6/)The reader is referred to Chapter 25

Uveitis
This important association of JIA occurs in 10–20% of patients and within 7
years of arthritis onset.
• Visual loss occurs in ~25% of JIA-associated uveitis and irreversible blindness
occurs without symptoms or changes in eye appearance.
• Irreversible complications may occur after only a few weeks of uncontrolled
uveal inflammation.
• However, about half of children with anterior or intermediate uveitis do not
experience visual loss despite prolonged inflammation.
• There are numerous causes of uveitis (Table 9.5).

Uveitis surveillance (screening) programmes
All paediatric rheumatology units/physicians should have an agreed mechanism
of systematically screening for, managing, and having emergency access to, a
suitably resourced ophthalmology team skilled in examining very young
children.
• Uveitis surveillance in JIA is essential because uveitis:
• is sight-threatening.
• is rarely apparent from routine history and examination, especially in
children <8 years of age.
• is not predictable and is unrelated to the severity of arthritis.
• is present in 40% cases at the time of the first eye screen.
• complications, especially cataract, occur in up to 40%.
• is most likely to respond with aggressive treatment.
• Other major ophthalmological concerns include glaucoma, macular oedema,
retinal detachment, band keratopathy, and hypotony.
• There should be immediate access to advice and assessment should eye
symptoms develop.
• A uveitis screening interval schedule should be adopted (e.g. Table 9.6) to
avoid irreversible eye damage.
• Uveitis surveillance schedules should be adapted to the risk of uveitis, and in
the context of treatment use (e.g. when stopping MTX).
• Eye screening continues until 12 years of age when a patient can reliably selfreport features of inflammation such as floaters and pain.
• Cessation of eye screening at 12 years old does not indicate that uveitis may
not occur, but the risk beyond this age is sufficiently low to make self-report
more reliable.

Management of uveitis
Uveitis management aims to balance long-term risk of visual loss with short- and
long-term risks of treatment.
• First-line treatment of anterior uveitis: topical GCs (e.g. Maxidex® or Predsol®
eye drops) given up to hourly depending on the severity. Topical GCs are less
effective in intermediate or posterior uveitis.
• There is a dose-dependent increase in risk of cataract formation from using
steroid eye drops. The risk from one drop per day is 0.1% per year and rises
with more frequent and prolonged use.
• Other topical agents include mydriatics to reduce the risk of the iris sticking to
the lens (posterior synaechiae) and glaucoma agents.
• Systemic or periocular GCs are used in the presence of panuveitis and features
inadequately responsive to eye drops.
• Aggressive or long-term treatment should be confined to those with a
significant risk of permanent visual loss.
• sDMARDs or bDMARDs are used when recurrent courses or prolonged use of
steroid eyedrops is required to maintain inflammation to less the 0.5+ activity
using the SUN criteria.3
• Poor outcome from uveitis is associated with presence of ocular damage at
presentation, when uveitis precedes arthritis, when there is delay in treatment
initiation, and with failure to achieve early remission.

Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE/‘lupus’) is a multisystem autoimmune
disorder with a broad spectrum of clinical features involving almost all organs
and tissues.
• SLE is a chronic disease which remits and relapses. A preclinical phase exists
characterized by autoantibodies common to other autoimmune diseases,
followed by a disease-specific autoimmune phase.
• Variations exist in the incidence of clinical features between ethnic groups
necessitating a keen sense of awareness of a variety of multisystem
pathologies and appreciation that SLE has taken on the mantle of syphilis as
the great mimic of other conditions.
Epidemiology
• Prevalence varies worldwide, but in the UK it is 97 per 100,000.
• SLE is 10–20× more common in women than men, and most likely to develop
between the ages of 15 and 40 years.

[SECTION]• It is more common and often more severe in certain ethnic groups such as
those of African-Caribbean, India, Hispanic, and Chinese origin living in the
USA and Europe than in white Caucasians.
Classification
• The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published its revised criteria
for the classification of SLE in 1997 (Table 10.1).
• Criteria are for the classification of SLE for epidemiological and research
purposes and not for diagnostic purposes. In practice, however, criteria
naturally tend to form the cornerstone for clinical diagnosis. The criteria were
developed and validated in patients with established, long-standing disease and
therefore may exclude patients with early or limited disease.
• The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinic (SLICC) classification
criteria for SLE are similar to the ACR classification criteria. The main
differences are that, for the SLICC classification:
• Haematological abnormalities need be present on only one occasion.
• There is inclusion of low C3, C4, and CH50 levels and a positive Coombs
test in the absence of haemolytic anaemia.
• The criteria also include non-scarring alopecia and a broader range of
cutaneous and neurological manifestations.

classification of SLE

classification of systemic lupus erythematosus’ (1997) Arthritis & Rheumatology 40(9):1725 with

Pathophysiology
The cause of SLE is incompletely understood but genetic, immunological, and
environmental factors all play an important role.
Genetics
• There is a higher concordance in monozygotic twins and the disease is
strongly associated with polymorphic variants at the HLA locus.
• In a few cases, SLE is associated with inherited mutations in complement
components C1q, C2, and C4, and in the immunoglobulin receptor FcγRIIIb or
in the DNA exonuclease TREX1.
• Genome-wide association studies have identified common polymorphisms

[SECTION]near several other genes that predispose to SLE, most of which are involved in
regulating immune cell function.
Serology and immune complexes
The characteristic feature of SLE is autoantibody production.
• Autoantibodies have specificity for a wide range of targets, but many are
directed against antigens in the cell or within the nucleus.
• SLE may occur because of defects in apoptosis or in the clearance of apoptotic
cells, which causes inappropriate exposure of intracellular antigens on the cell
surface, leading to polyclonal B- and T-cell activation and autoantibody
production.
• Following autoantibody production, immune complex formation is thought to
be an important mechanism of tissue damage in SLE, leading to vasculitis and
organ damage.
Environmental factors
• Environmental factors cause flares of lupus.
• UV light and infections increase oxidative stress and cause cell damage.
• Stress can aggravate SLE.

Clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE)
There is an extensive number of clinical features which can occur in SLE. Of the
several non-specific features that are common to many chronic diseases, lethargy
and fatigue are often the most disabling.
Mucocutaneous
Approximately half of patients diagnosed with SLE will have the classic UVsensitive ‘butterfly’ rash over the nasal bridge and malar bones. The cutaneous
manifestations of SLE include a combination of acute, subacute, chronic, and
other rashes, listed in Table 10.2.
Musculoskeletal features
• Musculoskeletal immobility-related stiffness and polyarticular, symmetrical
arthralgia or arthritis occur in 90% of cases.
• In most cases, symptoms outweigh objective clinical signs, and overt joint
damage from synovitis is confined to <10% of patients.
• Reversible subluxation of joints without erosive disease (Jaccoud arthropathy)
can also occur.

[SECTION]• Osteonecrosis occurs in 5–10% of patients; most cases are associated with
previous glucocorticoid (GC/‘steroid’) use or secondary to antiphospholipid
syndrome (APS).
• Raynaud’s disease, vasculitis, fat emboli, GCs, and APS can result in bone
ischaemia.
• Myalgia is common, but true myositis is seen in <5%.
• Myopathy may be a consequence of steroid treatment.
Cardiovascular disease
• Pericardial disease is the most common manifestation.
• Most cases of pericardial disease are asymptomatic. A mild pericarditis is
more common than a clinically significant pericardial effusion. On
echocardiography, pericardial thickening is seen more frequently than
pericardial effusions.
• Although SLE can lead to life-threatening pericardial effusions or constrictive
pericarditis, these manifestations are quite rare.
• Myocarditis, present in 8–25% of patients, is often asymptomatic.
• Clinical myocarditis (defined by combinations of tachycardia, dysrhythmias, a
prolonged PR interval on ECG, cardiomegaly, or congestive cardiac failure) is
considerably less common. Blood testing often reveals a raised troponin level
and N-terminal pro-BNP. Diagnosis is confirmed by cardiac MRI.
• Valvular heart disease is common. The most frequent abnormality is diffuse
thickening of the mitral and aortic valves followed by vegetations, valvular
regurgitation, and stenosis. Any valve vegetations identified in a patient who is
febrile should raise the possibility of bacterial endocarditis. Libman-Sacks
endocarditis is characterised by immune-complex dominant vegetations
classically on the mitral or the aortic valves in patients with SLE. The
vegetations are associated with lupus duration, disease activity and
anticardiolipin antibodies, among others.
• SLE patients have increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular
disease. Patients are 5–10× more likely to have clinically evident coronary
artery disease than the general population.
• Subclinical cardiovascular disease is also seen, with increased prevalence of
carotid plaque and faster progression of plaque formation. The pathogenesis of
early cardiovascular disease is multifactorial including traditional risk factors
(smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, and
positive family history), SLE-related risk factors (disease activity and damage,
GC use, disease duration), and factors related to the inflammatory process
(raised C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, elevated

[SECTION]homocysteine levels).
• Reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality requires management of
traditional risk factors, using antihypertensive agents and statins as
appropriate, as well as minimizing GC and NSAID use and achieving early
and prolonged control of disease activity.
• GCs, although indicated for inflammatory cardiac disease, are an added risk
factor for atherosclerosis given its propensity to induce hypertension,
hypercholesterolaemia, and obesity.

Pulmonary disease
• Because of the tendency for disease to be subclinical, CXR and pulmonary
function tests invariably indicate a greater degree of involvement than is
evident clinically.
• Patients may present quite late in the disease process following a history of
slow-onset non-productive cough and increased dyspnoea.
• Pulmonary function tests typically show reduced total lung capacity and peak

[SECTION]•

flow rates.
Shrinking lung is associated with unexplained dyspnoea, initially exertional,
but then at rest and on lying flat, small lung volumes on CXR, diaphragmatic
elevation, and restrictive pulmonary function tests in the absence of
parenchymal lung disease.
Pleuritic pain/pleuritis is present in up to 60% of cases, with a clinically
apparent pleural effusion in up to 50%.
Pleural effusions are a feature in one-third of patients, but they are usually
small and clinically insignificant.
Interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary vasculitis, and pneumonitis are found in up to
20% of patients.
Pulmonary haemorrhage is rare but potentially a catastrophic complication of
SLE.
Pulmonary hypertension is found in ~10% of patients with SLE, and is
associated with Raynaud’s disease, vasculitis, and APL antibodies.
Patients presenting with pleuritic pain and/or pulmonary hypertension should
be investigated for the presence of pulmonary emboli and APS (see Chapter
11).

Renal disease
Assessment of blood pressure for hypertension, urine for protein, blood, and
casts, and the serum creatinine, urea, and albumin is an essential part of regular
proactive monitoring.
• Symptoms suggesting renal failure rarely become obvious until substantial
damage has occurred.
• If early disease is suspected, a spot urine protein:creatinine ratio (uPCR), is
more accurate than urine dipstick and more convenient than the conventional
24-hour urine collection for protein and creatinine.
• Even low levels of proteinuria (<100 mg/mmol) may indicate renal
involvement.
• The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal function may also be assessed
by nuclear medicine techniques.
• A uPCR of >50 mg/mmol should be investigated in a patient with SLE. A
uPCR of >300 mg/mmol is suggestive of nephrotic range proteinuria.
• Renal biopsy should be considered if there is any evidence of new-onset
proteinuria, increasing proteinuria, haematuria, casts, or acute kidney injury.
• Biopsy should be done in centres with a high degree of experience.
• In 2003, the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) and Renal Pathology
Society (RPS) released a new classification of SLE (‘lupus’) nephritis

[SECTION]•
•

•
•

designed to standardize definitions. The 2003 ISN/RPS classification of lupus
nephritis replaced the 1982 modified World Health Organization (WHO)
classification:
• Class I: minimal mesangial lupus nephritis.
• Class II: mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis.
• Class III: focal lupus nephritis (< 50% of glomeruli).
• Class III (A): active lesions.
• Class III (A/C): active and chronic lesions.
• Class III (C): chronic inactive lesions.
• Class IV: diffuse lupus nephritis (50% glomeruli), divided into diffuse
segmental (IV-S) or global (IV-G) lupus nephritis.
• Class IV-(A): active lesions.
• Class IV-(A/C): active and chronic lesions.
• Class IV-(C): chronic inactive lesions.
• Class V: membranous lupus nephritis.
• Class VI: advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis (90% globally sclerosed
glomeruli without evidence of activity).
Chronic inactive lesions (glomerulosclerosis) are a poor prognostic feature.
A repeat renal biopsy may be considered when there is increasing proteinuria
or progressive renal failure in the absence of an alternative cause (i.e. poorly
controlled blood pressure, intercurrent infection, or non-compliance with
medication).
Active lupus nephritis may be present in otherwise clinically quiescent
disease.
Patients with lupus nephritis should have good blood pressure control with a
target of ≤130/80 mmHg.

Haematological features
• A microcytic anaemia may be due to anaemia of chronic disease, NSAIDrelated peptic ulcer disease, dietary deficiency of iron, gastrointestinal blood
loss, haemoglobinopathy, or menorrhagia.
• A normocytic anaemia can be due to myelosuppression from
immunosuppressants, chronic kidney disease due to nephritis, macrophage
activation syndrome (MAS), or rarely acute bleeding in alveolar haemorrhage
or in the context of autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
• Macrocytosis can be caused by immunosuppression (e.g. azathioprine (AZA)
or methotrexate (MTX)) or as a consequence of hypothyroidism, alcohol
excess, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency or occasionally with a reticulocytosis
after haemolysis.

[SECTION]• Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia causes fragments on blood film, an
increased reticulocyte count, low haptoglobin, raised lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) and bilirubin, and a positive Coombs test (direct antiglobulin test).
• Leucopenia and lymphopenia are common abnormalities, in 50% and 80% of
patients, respectively.
• A leucocytosis is rare, suggesting infection or GC therapy.
• There are several forms of clinical thrombocytopenia. Chronic, indolent, and
uncomplicated thrombocytopenia (<100 × 109/L) is present in up to 20% of
patients, particularly among patients with APL antibodies. A rarer acute and
life-threatening severe thrombocytopenia is also recognized, as well as
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
• Some patients may also present with immune thrombocytopenia, later
followed by other manifestations of SLE.
• Thrombocytopenia also occurs in the context of MAS. This ‘cytokine storm’
requires urgent treatment with high-dose GCs (see Chapter 9 and 25).
Neurological disease
Features of neurological disease range from cognitive impairment (in up to 50%
of patients) to psychoses and seizures (in 5–10% of patients over the course of
their disease).
• About 10% of patients develop a sensory (or, less often, sensorimotor)
peripheral neuropathy.
• Cranial nerve involvement is not common.
• Up to 70% prevalence of psychiatric illness has been quoted in the literature
(includes anxiety and depression).
• While it is accepted that GCs can induce psychiatric symptoms, in general it is
felt the drugs given in SLE are not responsible for most of the psychiatric
manifestations observed.
• Examination of CSF in neuropsychiatric disease should be done as part of the
initial evaluation—it may reveal a raised protein and/or white cell count, and
glucose may be low. CSF can also be normal, making diagnosis challenging.
• Electroencephalography is often non-specific.
• MRI with contrast is more sensitive than CT in detecting small vessel
vasculopathy associated with SLE.
• Brain biopsy can be used to exclude opportunistic infection or neoplastic
disease but is often not required. The pathological findings in lupus cerebritis
are of a small vessel vasculopathy.
Other clinical features and important comorbidities

[SECTION]Other clinical features are listed in Table 10.3.
Vitamin D deficiency
This may be associated with loss of immune tolerance. Most patients with SLE
have insufficient levels of vitamin D, and the effect of replacement on disease
activity remains uncertain.
Osteoporosis and osteopenia
There is a high prevalence of fractures in young patients with SLE, due to a
reduction in bone density.
• Factors that contribute to osteopenia and osteoporosis include GCs, renal
osteodystrophy, low vitamin D levels due to sun avoidance, premature
menopause, or cyclophosphamide (CYC) treatment.
Malignancy
There is a 7× increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with SLE. There is
increased incidence of cervical cancer due to human papilloma virus in SLE.

[SECTION]Investigations
• Important initial investigations are shown in Box 10.1.
• There are a variety of circulating autoantibodies to a range of nuclear,
cytoplasmic, and plasma membrane antigens (Table 10.4).
• Most patients (≥98%) will have antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). ~60% have
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies (detected by immunofluorescence
on crithidia lucillae or by ELISA or radioimmunoassay).
• Some patients have varying combinations of antibodies that may change over
the course of the disease.
• SLE is associated with deficiencies of the early classical pathway of
complement (e.g. C1q, C1r, C1s, and C2).
• Reduced levels of complement C3 and C4 are common in SLE, particularly at
the time of a disease flare.
• A subset of patients will be ‘serologically active but clinically quiescent’,
meaning they will have low complement levels and raised dsDNA antibody
titre, but no signs of active disease.
• Patients should always be treated on the basis of symptoms rather than blood
tests alone, but should be closely monitored for a flare in the context of a
rising anti-dsDNA antibody level and falling C3.
• Some individuals may have high levels of RF and features of RA (thus an
‘overlap’ syndrome termed ‘rhupus’).

Antiphospholipid syndrome and SLE
(See also
Chapter 11.) Abnormal procoagulant factors occurring in SLE
patients include a positive lupus anticoagulant test, anticardiolipin and anti-β 2
glycoprotein-1 (GP1) antibodies.
• Antiphospholipid (APL) antibodies occur in up to 33% of SLE patients.
• Although the presence of APL antibodies alone is not sufficient to make a
diagnosis of APS, 50% of SLE patients with positive APL antibodies will

[SECTION]develop hypercoagulopathy.
• The manifestations of SLE-associated APS include venous and arterial
thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, cerebral disease, recurrent fetal loss,
pulmonary hypertension, and livedo reticularis.
• Some patients with APL antibodies develop renal impairment (e.g.
hypertension or proteinuria) due to multiple small thrombi.

Pregnancy and SLE
• There is debate about whether pregnancy is associated with an increased risk
of SLE flare. However, pregnancy does not appear to worsen the long-term
outcome of SLE.
• A USA study1 has shown that SLE patients suffer more from gestational
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, renal failure, and
thrombotic episodes in pregnancy.
• Incidence of intrauterine growth retardation, pre-term delivery, and incidence
of caesarean sections are also increased.
• Active disease increases the risk of miscarriage and preterm birth.
• A major complication is pre-eclampsia—it occurs in 22.5% of women with
SLE. Pre-existing renal disease is an important risk factor.
• SLE is associated with an increased rate of fetal death late in pregnancy. ~10%
of SLE pregnancies result in fetal loss.
• APS-associated complications are discussed in Chapter 11.
• Anti-Ro associates with fetal heart block and neonatal lupus.
• Women who wish to conceive should receive appropriate counselling to
discuss discontinuation of teratogenic drugs.
• Features of a high-risk pregnancy include increasing age, significant organ
impairment/damage, lupus nephritis, active disease, high-dose GCs, and
presence of APL/Ro/La antibodies.
• Women at high risk should be managed in a combined medical-obstetric clinic,
and care should continue into the postpartum period, when flares and
thromboembolic events can occur.

Assessment of disease activity

[SECTION]Assessment of changes in SLE activity is an essential part of decision-making
and drug treatment.
• Several global activity indices have been produced that correlate well and are
reliable.
• Global scoring systems such as the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease
Activity Index (SLEDAI) and the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group
(BILAG) activity index are of some value, both in the context of clinical trials
and long-term follow-up of patients.
• Equally constructive is the concept of an index of damage as distinct from
disease activity. For example, a patient with dyspnoea may have an active but
reversible pneumonitis or irreversible fibrosis.
• The distinction between disease activity and damage is important since
treatments/management for each situation are different.
• The SLICC damage index has been developed as a method of recording

Drug-induced SLE
Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) should be suspected in patients with
no history of SLE, who develop a positive ANA and at least one clinical feature
of SLE after an appropriate duration of drug exposure.
• Drugs most commonly associated with DILE are:
• minocycline.
• hydralazine.
• procainamide.
• isoniazid.
• quinidine.
• methyldopa.
• chlorpromazine.
• sulfasalazine (SSZ).
• anti-TNFα drugs.
• Hydralazine-associated DILE is considered to be dose dependent, and
procainamide, time dependent.

[SECTION]• Up to 90% of patients taking procainamide develop a positive ANA and 30%
of these develop DILE.
• Renal, central nervous system, and skin features of SLE are rare in DILE.
Other features of SLE such as musculoskeletal, pulmonary, and serosal disease
are common.
• In the majority of cases, the condition subsides on withdrawing the drug.

Management of SLE
General measures
• It is important to avoid overexposure to UV/sunlight.
• Sunblock should be SPF30 or greater, and should protect against both UVA
and UVB.
• Advice should include supplement intake of vitamin D and in some cases
calcium to maintain adequate vitamin D levels (>50 nmol/L 25hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)).
• Postmenopausal women and men >50 years old on long-term GCs should be
offered a bisphosphonate as prevention against GC-induced osteoporosis
(GIO).
• In premenopausal women and men <50 years old, a DXA scan should be
obtained, and FRAX assessment done, and fracture risk—and need for
bisphosphonates—assessed accordingly.
• Live vaccines (e.g. yellow fever, polio) are contraindicated in patients taking
immunosuppressants. Other vaccinations are not contraindicated though the
degree of response to a vaccine may differ from the healthy individual.
• Oestrogen-containing contraceptives should be avoided ideally. Progesterone
only contraceptives or other methods of contraception are advised in
preference.
• All oral contraceptives should be avoided by women with SLE who have APL
antibodies (or positive lupus anticoagulant).
• Many patients tolerate hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but use of HRT in
the menopause is controversial. There is, for example, a 20% increase in SLE
flares among women taking HRT.
Reduction of cardiovascular disease risk factors
There is an excess incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in SLE patients
compared with non-SLE general population.
• Management of basic CVD risks is essential (smoking, hypertension, diabetes,
obesity).

[SECTION]• Consider statins for hypercholesterolaemia.
• Aspirin or formal anticoagulation in the presence of APS or if APL antibodies
are present (but see also Chapter 11).
• Tight control of SLE disease may reduce risk (see Table 10.5)

Immunosuppression
(See Fig. 10.1.)
Glucocorticoids (GCs)
• Prednisolone is frequently used with immunosuppressive drugs to rapidly
reduce SLE disease activity.
• Dosing of GCs varies widely depending on the severity of disease activity, and
is gradually tapered.
• Intravenous ‘pulsed’ methylprednisolone 0.25–1 g used daily for 3 consecutive
days is preferred in serious organ or life-threatening disease.
Antimalarial drugs
• Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 200–400 mg/day is an initial treatment for
patients with mild SLE symptoms.
• HCQ reduces the frequency of flares so is normally continued in all patients,
even when they require additional immunosuppression.
• Patients should be advised about the need for annual eye testing, and after 5
years of use they should be referred to an ophthalmologist to assess for retinal
toxicity.
• Eye examination should include examination of central visual field, visual and
reading acuity, slit lamp of the cornea, and stereoscopic slit lamp of the retina.
• For patients intolerant of HCQ, chloroquine phosphate 250 mg daily is a
useful alternative.
• Mepacrine is an antimalarial effective in treating SLE skin rashes, but does not
treat other manifestations of the disease.
Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and methotrexate

[SECTION]• Azathioprine (AZA) 2–3 mg/kg/day or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 0.5–
3g/day are used in moderate to severe disease.
• MMF is often preferred to AZA for lupus nephritis after the ALMS trial4
demonstrated superiority as a maintenance treatment with significantly less
time to treatment failure (and equivalence of MMF to IV CYC as an induction
agent5).
• Trial data show MMF is useful in treating non-renal manifestations.
• MTX is used when arthritis is the main clinical manifestation of SLE, or in
overlap syndromes with RA.
• A recent systematic review found MTX is also associated with a significant
reduction in SLEDAI.
Rituximab
RTX depletes circulating B cells through targeting anti-CD20. It is a monoclonal
antibody that was first used effectively in 2002 in patients with active SLE
which had failed, or only had partially responded to, conventional treatments.
• Open-label studies using pulse IV infusions of RTX confirmed the efficacy,
with benefits extending to 6 months.
• However, a major RCT failed to demonstrate that RTX was beneficial to
patients with moderate-to-severe SLE.
• In NHS England healthcare, RTX is allowed for use in SLE, as long as the
patient has one BILAG A and/or 2B scores or SLEDAI-2K score >6, in
addition to having failed at least two immunosuppressive drugs (at least one of
these must be MMF or CYC).
• B-cell depletion can be tested by monitoring the CD19 count.
• Significant side effects include infusion-related reactions and infection. Rarely,
progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported in
association with RTX, but PML is also seen in SLE patients who have never
received RTX.
• Low IgG levels can occur with successive cycles, with very low levels
occasionally preventing further treatment, or necessitating the use of
maintenance immunoglobulin.
Cyclophosphamide (CYC)
• IV ‘pulsed’ CYC is commonly used for many of the severe manifestations of
SLE, and has been demonstrated to be particularly effective for renal and
neurological disease.
• The ‘Euro-Lupus’ regimen (low-dose IV CYC) is often used with clinical
outcomes similar to the higher-dose regimens.

[SECTION]• As an alkylating agent with a broad effect on different cells, CYC depletes
both B and T cells.
• Major side effects include infection, hair fall, premature menopause, and
bladder toxicity (now rare due to co-treatment with mesna).
• There is some evidence that using GnRH agonists given prior to each dose of
CYC may prevent premature menopause and preserve fertility following
treatment.
Belimumab
• Belimumab is a fully-humanized antibody that neutralizes the activity of the
soluble B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS)/B-cell activating factor (BAFF).
BLyS/BAFF is also known as TALL-1, and THANK, and is a TNF
superfamily member (TNFSF13B) best known for its role in the survival and
maturation of B cells.
• It is the first drug to be licensed for SLE in approximately 50 years, and is
currently approved by NICE in the UK.
• Given IV, belimumab has principally demonstrated a positive effect in MSK
and mucocutaneous disease, as well as reduction in disease activity and flares.
• Its efficacy in neurological and renal SLE remains uncertain.
Plasma exchange (PE)
• PE is a treatment option for severe manifestations of SLE such as alveolar
haemorrhage, refractory nephritis, or associated catastrophic APS, though the
limited trial data for its use are conflicting.
Stem cell transplantation
• Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is used to treat haematological
disease, but has also been used in patients with severe refractory SLE.
• HSCT is effective in inducing remission but is curative only in <50%.
• Mortality is high and long-term effects are unknown.
• New autoimmune conditions have been reported after HSCT.
• It is currently used only in those with life-threatening SLE.
• Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation has recently emerged as an alternative
treatment. It significantly reduces SLE activity and may induce remission in
up to 50% of patients.
Other agents
• Tocilizumab has been shown to improve disease activity scores and dsDNA
antibody titres in open-label studies.
• Epratuzumab, an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody, reduces disease activity and

[SECTION]seems to deplete a more ‘lupus-specific’ set of B-cells than RTX. It is currently
undergoing phase III trials.
• Ofatumumab is a fully humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that may
be useful in SLE as an alternative to RTX when there has been an infusion
reaction.
• Eculizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against complement C5
has passed phase I trials in SLE. There are case reports of its benefit.
• Atacicept is a recombinant fusion protein that acts on B cells inhibiting
BAFF/BlyS and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). In recent studies, it
significantly reduced the SLE flare rate. Phase IIb trials are ongoing.
• Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, may be used in lupus nephritis. A recent
RCT suggests it may be non-inferior to MMF when used as an induction
agent.
• Pooled immunoglobulin (IVIg) may be of use in severely ill patients not
responding to other therapies, and especially in situations where sepsis is the
trigger and life-threatening.
• IVIg may have a role in drug-resistant membranous and
membranoproliferative nephritis, and has been used in severe immune
thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia with good effect.
For additional detail on all drug therapies used for rheumatic disease,
including immunosuppressants, see Chapter 23.

Prognosis and survival
Many studies of the duration of disease and survival rates are confounded by

[SECTION]inadequate attention paid to the ethnic group, age of onset, and socioeconomic
status of individual patients. The number of patients lost to follow-up is also
high.
• In relevant studies, with the division of patients into those with or without
overt nephritis, there is a 5-year survival in SLE of 90%.
• At 15 years, only 60% of those with nephritis will be alive compared with
85% of those patients without renal disease.
• A bi-modal mortality curve is considered to exist. Patients who die within 5
years usually have very active disease, requiring high doses of
immunosuppressive drugs.
• Patients dying after 5 years tend to do so from cardiovascular disease, renal
disease, and possibly infection.
• The combined effect of the disease and its treatment is to increase the risk of
infection markedly. The possibility of infection must always be considered and
treated aggressively as outcomes from sepsis can be very poor.
• SLE increases the risk of all malignancies compared to the general population,
particularly non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
• Cervical dysplasia is increased in SLE patients and regular monitoring should
be emphasized.
• The exact contribution of disease activity, duration, and immunosuppressive
drug exposure to the risk of developing a malignancy requires further research.
Clinicians should be aware of this increased risk and be alert to investigating
worrying symptoms promptly.

Juvenile SLE
Epidemiology
Approximately 20% of patients with SLE present before 18 years of age,
commonly between 12 and 14 years.
• Increased incidence of renal, haematological, and neuropsychiatric disease is
seen in juvenile SLE (JSLE).
• The overall incidence of JSLE is 0.4–0.6 per 100,000, but is much higher in
Afro-Caribbean and Asian populations.
• F:M ratio is less pronounced than in adults and is 3:1 pre puberty but increases
to 9:1 post puberty.
Clinical features
The clinical features of JSLE are extremely variable, ranging from a mild illness
with rash, fatigue, and joint involvement to severe life-threatening organ

[SECTION]involvement.
• JSLE tends to be a more severe phenotype than adult disease, accruing a
greater burden of organ damage.
• JSLE has a similar presentation to adult disease and follows a
relapsing/remitting course.
• Other differences from adult disease include:
• Raynaud’s disease is less common (10–20% of patients).
• Avascular necrosis of the hip is more common in JSLE.
• In JSLE, the disease itself and its treatments have significant consequences
on growth and physical development.
• Malar rash occurs in 30% of cases at diagnosis.
• Prevalence of renal disease is high at diagnosis, up to 60% of cases.
• Neuropsychiatric disease is present in up to 40% of cases.
Diagnosis and investigations
• Similar to adult SLE, diagnosis is based on both clinical and laboratory
features.
• The ACR revised classification criteria for SLE have also been validated in
JSLE.
• Of the ACR criteria features, the commonest found in JSLE include ANA
positivity, arthritis, haematological disorders, malar rash, renal and
neuropsychiatric involvement.
• Assessment of JSLE includes history, examination, and disease activity
assessment using tools used in adult SLE, including BILAG and SLEDAI.
Initial assessment investigations
• ANA (+ve in >95%), dsDNA (+ve in 60%), ENAs—most commonly include
anti-Ro and La, anti-Sm antibodies.
• Lupus anticoagulant (LA), ACL IgG and IgM, β 2GP1 antibodies.
• Clotting screen—prolonged in APLS and MAS.
• Fibrinogen—increased in inflammation, low in MAS.
• Coombs test/DAT—positive in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
• Immunity status to measles and varicella IgG.
At each review
• FBC (Hb low in anaemia of chronic disease or autoimmune anaemia,
leucocyte count increased in infection and serositis, low platelets often).
• If pancytopenia on FBC in unwell patient—consider MAS.
• ESR typically increased in flares, low in MAS.
• CRP—if increased consider infection, serositis, polyarthritis.

[SECTION]• Complement: low C3 and C4 levels can correlate with disease activity but with
low sensitivity.
• Urinalysis for blood and protein to check for renal involvement. If protein
present, quantification is needed with uPCR.
Management of JSLE
Early and aggressive therapy is key to improve outcome and prevent organ
damage. This includes induction and maintenance therapies.
• Management is similar to adult SLE (see
‘Management of SLE’, pp.
360–365).
• The current treatment paradigm is to treat all children with HCQ to minimize
flares, skin disease, and limit atherogenic and thrombotic risks associated with
JSLE.
• Provide advice regarding sun and UV avoidance and use of sunblock (SPF 50)
to reduce flares and photosensitive rashes.
• Induction therapy typically includes use of IV GCs (e.g. IV
methylprednisolone on 3 consecutive days), followed by a dose reduction
regimen of oral prednisolone (from 1–2 mg/kg/day) together with a sDMARD.
• The role of IV CYC in induction is less clear and MMF is typically preferred
in JSLE nephritis.
• CYC is still used in neurological disease, systemic vasculitis, and refractory
JSLE nephritis.
• Mild to moderate disease at presentation is treated with GCs, MMF, or AZA.
MTX is used when arthritis or cutaneous manifestations (including discoid
lupus) predominate.
• Maintenance treatment is with AZA, MMF, or MTX—similar to adult disease.
• RTX is effective in JSLE and can be used in disease refractory to first-line
induction therapy or in patients experiencing unwanted adverse effects of
alternative treatments.
• Anticoagulants (heparin and/or warfarin) should be considered in APLS, and
low-dose aspirin in cases of positive LA or ACL antibodies. Optimum
anticoagulation regimens, are not known, however.
• Hypertension and proteinuria should be aggressively managed with ACE
inhibitors and calcium channel blockers to prevent organ damage.
• Close surveillance of patients at intervals of 1–3 months is necessary to ensure
there are no unexpected complications of JSLE or its treatment.
Prognosis and survival
• The prognosis of JSLE is often determined by the severity, management, and

[SECTION]outcome of renal disease.
• Risk factors for poor outcome include severe JSLE flares, infection,
neuropsychiatric manifestations, and some features, seen notably in black and
Hispanic populations, such as persistent anaemia, high creatinine,
hypertension and persistently low C3.
• JSLE continues to have a 2× higher mortality than adult SLE, although
outcome has improved in recent years.
• 5-year survival of JSLE now exceeds 90%.

Neonatal lupus syndrome
Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is an autoimmune condition attributable to
transfer of maternal autoantibodies across the placenta, such as anti-SSA/Ro
and/or anti-SSB/La antibodies.
• The condition can present in utero or postnatally.
• ~50% of mothers of babies with NLE are healthy at childbirth with no
recognized symptoms of AICTD.
• Only 1–2% of autoantibody-positive mothers will have an infant who develops
NLE, although subsequent risk increases to 10–25% for future pregnancies.
• NLE is transient in cases other than those with heart block. Skin and
haematological manifestations resolve as maternal antibodies disappear at 3–6
months post birth.
• Severe hepatitis can be life-threatening and mortality in cardiac NLE is 20–
30%.
Clinical features
There should be suspicion of the presence of NLE where there is a persistent
bradycardia or a combination of non-scarring rash, transaminitis, and
cytopenia in a baby 0–6 months old.
Skin
• Rashes occur in 70% of NLE babies—typically present at birth.
• Typical lesions are transient and similar to subacute cutaneous LE with

[SECTION]annular pink scaly plaques.
• Lesions may be crusted and may affect head and neck as elsewhere.
• Telangiectasia and petechiae are also common and may occur alone.
Cardiac manifestations
• Cardiac lesions occur in 65% of NLE babies.
• A third of affected babies have congenital complete heart block, which usually
develops between 18 and 20 weeks of gestation.
• Other problems include bradycardia, prolonged QT interval, ventricular
tachycardias, valve disease, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure.
Other manifestations
• Haematological effects usually appear during the second week of life and
include thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, and neutropenia.
• Liver involvement includes transaminitis in half of patients and conjugated
jaundice.
• Other effects of NLE can include transient neurological and lung involvement.
The former may be manifest by asymptomatic neuroimaging abnormalities.
Investigations
• All women of childbearing age with an AICTD should be tested for anti-Ro
and anti-La antibodies early in their pregnancy.
• Women testing positive for anti-Ro and/or anti-La antibodies should be
referred to a specialist obstetric unit for weekly fetal US-echocardiography
from 16 weeks’ gestation onwards.
• The frequency of US-echo may be reduced in absence of complete heart block
after week 26.
• Diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical features and in the presence of
positive autoantibodies in neonatal or maternal serum.
Management of NLE
• In complete heart block, 64% of live births require a pacemaker, almost all in
the first year of life. About 60% of cases require a pacemaker during the first
10 days after birth.
• GCs, HCQ, and IVIg may reduce the risk of NLE-related cardiac lesions
overall.
• Skin lesions can be managed with UV avoidance, sun block, and topical
steroids (± HCQ).
Prognosis
• Affected babies may be at increased risk of future autoimmune conditions but

[SECTION]development of JSLE is rare.
• Other inflammatory conditions in infants that may subsequently occur include
autoinflammatory conditions such as CINCA/NOMID, Kawasaki disease, and
systemic-onset JIA.

Antiphospholipid syndrome
Classification
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease
characterized by recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis. APS can be primary or
secondary to an underlying autoimmune disease—commonly SLE (see
Chapter 10).
• Patients may be classified in terms of the antibody present. Anticardiolipin
(ACL) and anti-β 2 glycoprotein 1 (β 2GP1) are detected by quantitative
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). See Table 11.1.
• Lupus anticoagulant (LA) is a functional test that quantifies coagulation in
vitro.
Table 11.1 Classification criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome

Clinical criteria
Vascular
thrombosis

One or more clinical episodes of arterial, venous, or small
vessel thrombosis in any tissue or organ, confirmed by
objective criteria. Histopathology should show thrombosis
without significant inflammation in the vessel wall

Pregnancy
morbidity

One or more unexplained death of a morphologically normal
fetus at or beyond 10 weeks’ gestation
or
One or more premature birth of a morphologically normal

[SECTION]neonate at or before 34 weeks’ gestation due to pre-eclampsia,
eclampsia, or placental insufficiency
or
Three or more unexplained, consecutive, spontaneous
abortions before 10 weeks’ gestation, excluding maternal
anatomical or hormonal abnormalities, and excluding maternal
and paternal chromosomal causes
Laboratory criteria
ACL
antibodies

Medium/high titre of IgG and/or IgM isotype anticardiolipin
antibody in blood on 2 or more occasions at least 12 weeks
apart using standard assays

Anti-β 2

anticoagulant
(LA)
A diagnosis of APS requires the presence of one positive clinical criterion manifested by thrombosis or
pregnancy loss, plus one positive laboratory criterion (any one of the three antibodies) on two different
occasions separated by 12 weeks.
Adapted from Miyakis S et al. International consensus statement on an update of the classification
criteria for definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). J Thromb Haemostasis 2006;4:295–306 with
permission from Wiley.

Epidemiology
• Case–control studies estimate the prevalence of ACL antibodies in the normal
population to be 1–4%.
• Prevalence of ACL antibodies in people >65 years increases to 12–50%
depending on the study.
• Age-dependent reference ranges do not exist but have been suggested by some
authors.
• Prevalence of ACL antibodies and LA in SLE patients is estimated at 20–40%
and 10–20%, respectively. These differences arise due to treatment history and
the lack of uniformity of assay methods.
Pathophysiology
• APL antibodies are directed against phosphorus-fat components of cell

[SECTION]•

•

•

membranes called phospholipids.
Certain blood proteins will bind with phospholipids to form complexes to
which antibodies may occur.
ACL antibodies are a family of the immunoglobulins IgG, IgM, IgA, or a
combination of these isotopes. The IgG subtypes have a stronger association
with clinical complications compared with IgM.
High levels of the IgM isotype can be associated with autoimmune haemolytic
anaemia.
The clinical consequences of IgA ACL antibodies are unclear.
β 2GPI is a plasma glycoprotein co-factor to which ACL binds. Anti-β 2GPI is
more specific than ACL antibody in predicting thrombosis, and can occur in
~10% of APS patients as the only positive test.
LA is a functional measurement of the capacity of heterogeneous APL
antibodies that interferes with phospholipid-dependent stages of blood
coagulation in vitro, inhibiting both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.
Hence, in vitro, LA exhibits anticoagulant properties, whereas in vivo it
functions as a procoagulant. APL antibodies are therefore paradoxically
associated with thrombosis, rather than haemorrhage.
Apart from clinical suspicion, a clue to the presence of APS is prolonged
clotting time in assays for the ‘internal pathway’ clotting cascade. Around 50%
of patients with positive LA antibodies have a prolonged activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT).

Differential diagnosis
The most characteristic feature of APS is thrombosis in the presence of
thrombocytopenia.
• The main differential diagnosis to consider is thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP).
• TTP is a microvascular disorder, often associated with neurological features of
confusion, seizures, and altered consciousness.
• The differential diagnosis of unexplained thrombosis includes genetic causes
(e.g. protein C and S, and antithrombin III deficiencies) and drugs (including
oestrogen, thalidomide, IVIg). Therefore a full thrombophilia screen should be
carried out in patients with recurrent venous thrombosis.
Clinical features
(See also Table 11.2.)
Thrombosis
• Vessels of all sizes, venous or arterial, may be affected without evidence of an

[SECTION]•
•
•
•

inflammatory infiltrate, hence the range of clinical features is wide.
Unlike in most clotting disorders, arterial thrombosis is a major feature of
APS.
Thrombosis can be present with or without a history of relevant pathology
associated with pregnancy.
Occlusion of the intracranial arteries is the most common arterial
manifestation, with the majority of patients presenting with stroke.
APL antibodies should be sought in the younger stroke patient, where they
may account for up to 20% of cases.

Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome
• Widespread thrombosis is the feature of life-threatening ‘catastrophic
antiphospholipid syndrome’ (cAPS).
• cAPS may present with acute collapse, severe thrombocytopenia, multiorgan
failure (notably cerebral and renal), and adult respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS).
Fetal loss
• Recurrent spontaneous pregnancy loss is a common manifestation of APS,
which occurs as either recurrent early miscarriage or intrauterine fetal demise.
• Screening for APL antibodies in the context of previous pregnancy history is
of importance in determining the significance of positive APL antibodies.
• In APL antibody-positive pregnancies that do not end in miscarriage, there is a
high incidence of early onset pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction,
placental abruption, and premature delivery.
Skin lesions
• The most frequent manifestations are livedo reticularis and skin ulcers.
• Livedo reticularis is characterized by a mottled purple reticular pattern.
Appearances look similar to a fishnet pattern and in APS is usually
disseminated. Livedo is a marker of poor prognosis and disease severity.
• Skin ulcers can be found in the extremities, and extensive cutaneous necrosis
has been reported. Digital gangrene has also been described.
• Subungual splinter haemorrhages are seen in ~5%, and may suggest the
occurrence of other thrombotic events.
• Other cutaneous lesions also described include purpura, tender nodules,
papules, palmar–plantar erythema, and anetoderma.
Liver and gastrointestinal tract
• Liver abnormalities are common in APS, possibly due to vascular sludging or

[SECTION]small vessel thrombosis.
• Budd–Chiari syndrome was a feature of the original description of APS. It is
caused by thrombosis of the hepatic veins, presenting as a triad of abdominal
pain, ascites, and liver enlargement. It may be fulminant, acute, chronic, or
asymptomatic.
• Intestinal ischaemia and perforation due to thrombosis and coeliac artery
stenosis have also been described.
Musculoskeletal
• Osteonecrosis is a complication of APS. It is most commonly of the femoral
head but can affect other bones such as the navicular.
• Non-specific arthralgia may occur. Joint pains and stiffness are more common
in APS associated with SLE and other autoimmune rheumatic and connective
tissue diseases.
• Metatarsal fractures and other spontaneous vertebral and rib fractures have
also been reported.
Endocrine
• Adrenal insufficiency is the most common endocrinological manifestation, and
can be the presenting feature of APS.
• A few cases of hypopituitarism and ovarian/testicular involvement have been
reported.
Kidney
• The kidney is a major target organ in APS.
• Renal artery occlusion and renal artery stenosis have been described in APS
patients with hypertension, and may result in renal infarction.
• Thrombosis of the renal veins and thrombotic microangiography has been
described.
• Distinguishing between SLE nephritis (immune complex mediated) and APS
nephritis (thrombotic disease) can only be established by renal biopsy.
Lungs
• Pulmonary embolism and infarction is the most common lung manifestation of
APS.
• Pulmonary hypertension is found in around 2% of APS patients.
• ARDS is rare with high mortality of ~50%, usually seen in cAPS.

arterial thrombotic manifestation. Less commonly associated is sagittal venous
sinus thrombosis.
Migraine is a common complaint, and cognitive deficits can occur.
APS patients may exhibit features seen with multiple sclerosis, and MRIs may
fail to differentiate.
Seizures can occur, thought to be secondary to the interaction of APL
antibodies and neuronal tissue.
Transverse myelopathy, though rare, has a strong association with APL
antibodies.
Other less frequent manifestations include chorea, Guillain–Barré syndrome,
sensorineural hearing loss, and retinal ischaemia.

Cardiac features
• APS may be associated with multiple cardiovascular complications including
accelerated atherosclerosis, valvular heart disease, and intracardiac thrombi.
• Cardiac manifestations of APS result in significant morbidity in around 5% of
patients.
• In a European cohort, myocardial infarction was a presenting feature of APS
in 3% of patients, and was seen during follow-up in 5.5%.
• The prevalence of APL antibodies in patients with myocardial infarction is
estimated at 5–15%, but screening is not indicated, except in younger patients,
patients with other symptoms and signs of APS, and those with a family
history of autoimmune disease.
• Mitral and aortic valve thickening and dysfunction is commonly seen on
echocardiography, but significant morbidity is uncommon.
• Intracardiac thrombus is a rare manifestation of APS.
Laboratory features
Thrombocytopenia
• Thrombocytopenia is common, seen in ~25%. It is rarely severe enough to
cause bleeding.
• ACL antibodies have been found in up to 30% of presumed cases of immune
thrombocytopenic purpura.
• Haemolytic anaemia with a positive direct antiglobulin test may co-exist with
thrombocytopenia (Evans syndrome).
General aspects
• Given an association with all AICTDs, extensive autoantibody screening
should be considered: ANA, RF, anti-CCP antibodies.

Treatment of APS

[SECTION]There is no evidence for the role of warfarin in primary prevention (‘primary
prevention’ defined by prevention before diagnosed thrombosis). Modifiable risk
factors for thrombosis and cardiovascular lesions should be addressed (e.g.
smoking, high cholesterol, increased blood pressure, systemic inflammation,
oestrogen use).
• Hydroxychloroquine has antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant
properties, and is recommended in SLE patients with positive APL antibodies
(Table 11.3 and Table 11.4). It has also been shown to reduce APL antibody
titres.
• HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lower cholesterol levels and have antiinflammatory, immunoregulatory, and antithrombotic effects.
• Studies have shown that fluvastatin may prevent thrombosis in patients with
APS by inhibiting tissue factor and other monocyte markers that contribute to
activation of the coagulation pathway, in addition to reducing thrombus
formation biomarkers.1
• Rituximab (RTX), an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes CD20positive B-cell populations, has been used in APS-related thrombocytopenia,
haemolytic anaemia, venous and arterial thrombosis, ischaemic cardiac and
bowel events, cutaneous lesions, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, nephropathy,
and cAPS.
• RTX may be used in refractory cases of APS after failure of anticoagulation.
• Glucocorticoids (GCs), immunosuppressive drugs, IVIg, or plasmapheresis
have been used in the treatment of APS with thrombosis, but the latter are
more justified in cAPS.
• Over the last 4 years, successful treatment with eculizumab (a complement
inhibitor) has been reported in a few cases, showing benefit in preventing
recurrence of APS among transplant recipients, and in refractory cAPS.
Anticoagulation in primary thromboprophylaxis (APL antibody positive
without previous thrombotic event)
• Recommendations for primary thromboprophylaxis in APS support the use of
low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day).
Anticoagulation in secondary thromboprophylaxis (APS—after first venous or
arterial event)
• After the first thrombotic event (either arterial or venous), recurrence of
thrombosis is common, but can be prevented by treatment with warfarin.
• Patients <50 years of age with cerebrovascular events and positive APL
antibodies, have a 5× increased risk of further ischaemic stroke.

[SECTION]• In venous thrombosis with transient or reversible risk factors or low-risk APL
antibody profile, 3–6 months of treatment may be adequate, aiming for an
international normalized ratio (INR) of 2–3.
• High-intensity anticoagulation (an INR of 3–4) is associated with increased
bleeding risk compared to standard intensity treatment (INR of 2–3) with no
clear reduction in thrombotic events according to studies.
• Hence, high-intensity anticoagulation is not recommended, but could be
considered in complicated cases where thrombosis occurs despite
warfarinizing with an INR of 2–3.
• For patients with refractory thrombosis, fluctuating INR levels, or high risk of
major bleeding, alternative therapeutic options to warfarin should be
considered, such as long-term low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH),
hydroxychloroquine, or statins.
• Table 11.4 summarizes APS treatments in patients refractory to
anticoagulation or who are unable to take warfarin.
• Mild thrombocytopenia need not be treated but severe cases (<50 × 109/L)
should be treated with oral GCs in the first instance. In those failing to
respond, IVIg, danazol, and splenectomy have been used with varying success.
Anticoagulation in obstetric APS
See Table 11.5.
Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)
• Anticoagulation with warfarin is limited by drug and food interactions,
teratogenicity, high variability in response and necessity of frequent blood
monitoring.
• NOACs directly inhibit a single enzyme of the coagulation cascade, and seem
to be promising in the prevention of thrombosis in APS (but no APS trials).
• Minimal drug and food interactions and fixed drug dosing without the need for
laboratory monitoring contribute to the advantage of NOACs compared to
warfarin. However, the lack of antidotes remains a limitation. Some studies
report a risk of major bleeding of up to 10% of cases per year.
• NOACs include direct thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran, and direct antiXa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. The Rivaroxaban
for Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (RAPS) study is currently underway
comparing the effects of warfarin versus rivaroxaban in thrombotic APS
patients.

Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome
Introduction
This rare variant of APS (<1% cases) affects small vessels and visceral organs
and was first described in 1992.
• Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (cAPS) is an important and serious
condition that can present in previously asymptomatic patients.
• The trigger is an infection in 20% of cases. Other precipitating factors include
trauma/surgery, malignancy, warfarin withdrawal in a patient with APS,
pregnancy, and oral contraceptives. However, it is estimated that 45% of cAPS
cases have no known trigger.
• cAPS is associated with other autoimmune conditions such as SLE (see
Chapter 10), RA (see Chapter 5), and SScl (see Chapter 13).
• Mortality is high at 50%, and most patients require care in an intensive care
unit.
Clinical features
• Diffuse peripheral and central thrombosis occurs leading to:
• limb arterial and venous occlusion.
• intra-abdominal organ infarction including renal failure.
• pulmonary emboli and ARDS.
• small vessel cerebrovascular disease.
• aortic and mitral valve defects, and myocardial infarction.
• other thrombotic complications, such as ovarian, testicular, and retinal
vessel occlusion.
• Livedo reticularis, gangrene, and purpura are visible markers of the disorder

on the skin.
Bone marrow infarction has also been reported.
Following the production of classification criteria, data from 300 patients in a
cAPS registry have shown the majority are female (72%), almost half had
primary APS (46%), and a precipitating factor was found in 53%.2
Data from the cAPS registry also show the most common sites are renal
(71%), pulmonary (64%), cerebral (62%), and cardiac (51%).
The presence of systemic immune response syndrome, in which proinflammatory cytokines are released from affected tissues, is also thought to
contribute to morbidity and mortality.

Laboratory features
• Moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia.
• Haemolysis with schistocytes.
• Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
• High levels of IgG ACL antibodies or presence of a LA.
Differential diagnosis
• The clinician should consider the following conditions:
• Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (red cell fragments more numerous
than in cAPS).
• HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets).
• Haemolytic–uraemic syndrome.
• Cryoglobulinaemia.
• Vasculitis.
Treatment and prognosis
• Apart from techniques and therapies used in the intensive support of multiple
organ failure, IV heparin, GCs, plasma exchange, and IVIg (for 4–5 days at a
dose of 0.4 g/kg/day) can be used.
• Case reports exist in single patients describing the use of epoprostenol,
defibrotide (not licensed in the UK), and fibrinolytics.
• RTX can be used in refractory cases or in the presence of micro-angiopathic
haemolytic anaemia.
• CYC has been shown to be beneficial in cAPS with the presence of secondary
autoimmune disease such as SLE.
• A RCT on belimumab (a B-cell activating factor inhibitor) in SLE patients has
shown a decrease in ACL IgA.
• Mortality remains >50% and 25% of survivors will develop further APSrelated events.

Epidemiology and pathophysiology
Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology,
characterized by lymphocyte infiltration of exocrine glands resulting in dryness
of mucosal surfaces including mouth (xerostomia), eyes (xerophthalmia), nose,
pharynx, larynx, and vagina.
• SS may be primary, associated with specific extraglandular (systemic) disease,
or secondary, in association with a number of other autoimmune diseases
including RA (see Chapter 5), SLE (see
Chapter 10), thyroid disease,
coeliac disease, and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).
• SS is (rarely) associated with progression to lymphoid malignancy.
• SS has a F:M ratio of 14–24:1 in the largest reported series, and is common
between 40 and 60 years of age.
• Population prevalence is estimated at 1%, similar to that of RA.
• EBV and retroviruses have been implicated in pathogenesis.
• Antibodies to nuclear proteins Ro/SSA and La/SSB may be formed when Ro
and La are exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells.
• Rheumatoid factor (RF) and a positive ANA are also common and patients
may be erroneously diagnosed with RA.
• HLA-DR3 is strongly associated with SS.

syndrome: a consensus and data-driven methodology involving three international patient cohorts. Ann
Rheum Dis 2017;76:9–16.

Clinical manifestations and classification criteria
The classification criteria for primary SS are listed in Table 12.1. These
represent an update of the 1993 European Community Criteria for classifying SS
and have been adopted by the scientific community worldwide. They have a
sensitivity and specificity of around 94%.
• Exclusions include head and neck irradiation, hepatitis C, AIDS, pre-existing
lymphoma, sarcoidosis, graft vs host disease and anticholinergic drug use.
• Extraglandular disease is seen in one-third of patients with primary SS. The
main symptoms are fatigue, low-grade fever, myalgia, and arthralgia (Table
12.2).
Glandular disease
• The initial manifestations can be non-specific and 8–10 years can elapse
before the diagnosis is established.
• Typical initial features of ‘sicca’ syndrome include dry eyes (xerophthalmia) in
>50% at presentation, dry mouth (xerostomia) in 40%, and parotid/salivary
gland enlargement in 25%. The prevalence of these manifestations increase
with the duration of disease.
• Concurrent corneal and conjunctival damage (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), and
dental caries from poor tear and salivary flow respectively, can occur.
• Lack of secretions may also affect the respiratory tract (nasal dryness, cough,

[SECTION]or hoarse voice), oesophagus and pharynx (dysphagia) or vagina (dyspareunia
and pruritus).
• A number of conditions can cause xerostomia and other ‘dryness’ symptoms
and also parotid/salivary gland swelling (see Table 12.3).
Joints
Joint disease needs careful assessment. Associated (‘overlap’) RA can occur
(ACPA positive and typical RA erosions on radiographs) and generalized
inflammatory osteoarthritis (OA) is common in the same age/gender
demography as primary SS. Whether a true SS-associated arthritis or (or)
whether (there is) there is a significant association between generalized OA and
PSS, is debated but essentially is not known.
• Non-erosive arthritis is more frequent in patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon,
and the latter can pre-date SS by many years.
• A milder form of SS has been linked to generalized OA and has been termed
‘SOX syndrome’ (sialadenitis, osteoarthritis, xerostomia).

Skin
• Itchy annular erythema, alopecia, and hyper/hypopigmentation can occur. A
hypersensitivity vasculitis may also develop.
• Vascular involvement in SS affects small- and medium-sized vessels. The
most common manifestations are cutaneous purpura, urticaria, and skin
ulceration.
• Skin vasculitis in SS is benign and treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) not
always needed.
• Cryoglobulins are present in 10–20% of patients with skin vasculitis in SS

[SECTION](and may be associated with hepatitis C positivity).
• In contrast to SScl (see Chapter 13), Raynaud’s disease in SS is not typically
associated with digital ulceration and infarcts.
Pulmonary disease
Pulmonary disease is common.
• Pulmonary function abnormalities are seen in 25% of patients, although they
are not usually clinically significant.
• Rarely a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) may occur, causing
pyrexia, cough, and dyspnoea.
• In LIP, lymphocytic infiltration occurs around bronchioles, leading to
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. This responds well to GCs.
Renal disease
Overt renal disease is found in 10% of patients with primary SS.
• A renal tubular acidosis (RTA) may occur, causing a normal anion gap
metabolic acidosis, a urine pH of >5.5, and hypokalaemia.
• RTA is typically type 1 distal tubule predominant in SS.
• Long-term RTA can result in nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis.
• Glomerulonephritis is rare and seen mainly in those with SS/SLE overlap. In
many cases, a consistent finding is cryoglobulinaemia and
hypocomplementaemia.
Gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary disease
• Dysphagia due to dryness of the pharynx and oesophagus is common. Chronic
atrophic gastritis may occur due to lymphocytic infiltration similar to that seen
in the salivary glands.
• Subclinical hyperamylasaemia is a common finding in up to 25% of cases and
there may be a close link between the ‘autoimmune cholangitis’ of SS and
PBC. Sicca syndrome is found in 50% of PBC cases.
• Transaminitis may be due to hepatitis C, which can cause a Sjögren’s-like
disease often in association with a ‘mixed’ cryoglobulinaemia.
Neuromuscular disease
• Peripheral sensory neuropathy is the most common neuromuscular feature of
SS. This may be a sensory ataxic neuropathy (dorsal root ganglionopathy) or a
painful small fibre neuropathy.
• Autonomic neuropathy is rarely seen.
• Mononeuritis multiplex as a consequence of vasculitis is well recognized as is
the isolated involvement of cranial nerves, particularly the trigeminal and optic

[SECTION]nerve.
• Involvement of the central nervous system remains a controversy.
Demyelinating, multiple sclerosis-like syndromes may be seen.
• Myalgia is common but myositis is rare. The pattern of myositis is like
polymyositis and is treated as such accordingly (see Chapter 14).
Lymphoproliferative disease
• Patients with SS have an ~16% increased risk of developing a lymphoma,
compared to age-, gender-, and race-matched normal controls.
• The lymphomas are primarily B cell in origin, usually expressing the
monoclonal IgMκ, and of two major types, either highly undifferentiated, or
well-differentiated immunocytomas.
• The clinical picture is diverse. The approach to therapy should be determined
by the stage and histological grade of the disease.
• The salivary glands are the main site of lymphomatous change. The presence
of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, or persistent, painful, and continuously
enlarged salivary glands, in the absence of infection, should raise suspicion
and warrants biopsy.
• Other organs and systems may be affected including lungs, kidneys, and GI
tract.
• Risk
factors
include
monoclonal
gammopathy,
cryoglobulins,
hypocomplementaemia, and ganglionopathy.
Cardiovascular system
• Anti-Ro and La antibodies cross the placenta and can cause fetal congenital
heart block. Mothers with these antibodies have a 1 in 20 risk of having an
affected pregnancy (see Chapter 10).
• Fetal heart rate monitoring in specialist centres is needed.
• Oral dexamethasone given to mothers early following detection of heart block
may reverse the condition.
• Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is also seen (see Chapter 10).
Fatigue
• Fatigue is often the worst symptom for many patients with SS.
• Patients often learn to cope with fatigue with the most successful adopting a
frame of mind that ‘accepts’ the fatigue; having close relatives and family
realize that fatigue is part of the disease; pacing their activities; and
undertaking some regular aerobic exercise.
• Failure to cope with fatigue may lead to chronic pain.

[SECTION]Other pathology in SS
• Over 50% of patients have antithyroid antibodies and altered thyroid
biochemistry without necessarily overt clinical symptoms.
• Non-bacterial interstitial cystitis due to an intense inflammation of the mucosa
can cause frequency, nocturia, and perineal pain.
• Mild normochromic, normocytic anaemia is common. Leucopenia is seen in
15–20% of patients with SS. The ESR is often raised (requiring a paraprotein
to be excluded), but the CRP is usually normal.
Other autoimmune diseases
In a recent retrospective case review of 114 patients with primary SS, 33% had
an additional autoimmune disease, 6% two diseases, and 2% three diseases.
Hypothyroidism was the most common condition seen. Coeliac disease is also
commonly associated.

Investigations
Common laboratory findings in primary SS are detailed in Table 12.4.
Assessment of sicca symptoms
• Salivary flow rates (sialometry) can be measured for whole saliva or separate
secretions from different salivary glands, with or without stimulation.
• Patients with overt SS have decreased unstimulated salivary flow rates.
Measuring salivary flow rate is simple but can be confounded by concomitant
use of drugs with anticholinergic properties.
• However, a simple screening test is to have a patient spit all saliva into a
graded measuring sample pot for 10 min. More than 2 mL (>0.2 mL/min)
makes primary SS unlikely.
• Anatomical changes in the ductal system can be assessed by radiocontrast
sialography. This can, however, be painful and there is some controversy as to
its sensitivity and specificity.
• Scintigraphy, with uptake of 99Tc, may provide a functional evaluation of all
the salivary glands by observing the rate and density of uptake and the time for
it to appear in the mouth after IV administration. Scanning has a high
sensitivity albeit low specificity, but has a greater sensitivity and specificity
than unstimulated sialometry.
• The Schirmer test is used for the evaluation of tear secretion. Strips of filter
paper 30 mm in length are slipped over the inferior eyelid by a fold at one end
of the strip. After 5 min the length of paper that has been made wet by the

[SECTION]tears is measured; wetting of <5 mm is a strong indication of diminished tear
secretion.
• Salivary gland US is emerging as a useful non-invasive tool in the diagnosis of
SS. It has a high specificity and has been shown to correlate well with labial
gland biopsy findings. It is used in some centres to establish whether a labial
gland biopsy is required.
Biopsy
A labial gland biopsy is often essential to the establishment of a diagnosis of SS,
particularly when the patient lacks anti-Ro or anti-La antibodies.
• Because there is a risk of sensory nerve damage, the biopsy should be done by
a surgeon with experience in the technique.
• At least 4–6 glands must be biopsied, since the pathologic process is
invariably focal.
• Biopsies should not be taken if there is mucosal inflammation overlying the
biopsy site or there is a past history of therapeutic head and neck irradiation.
• The biopsy must be scored for the number of lymphocytic foci (i.e. aggregates
of 50 or more lymphocytes) that surround ducts or blood vessels, and are
adjacent to histologically normal acini.
• A score of 1 or more foci per 4 mm2 is compatible with SS. However, focal
lymphocytic sialadenitis can also be seen in hepatitis C, HIV, graft vs host
disease, and patients with autoimmune disease in the absence of sicca
symptoms.

Treatment
Table 12.5 summarizes the general and organ-directed treatment options for SS.
For more extensive detail the reader is directed to the 2017 BSR Guideline for
the management of adults with primary Sjögren’s syndrome.
• Dental input and close collaboration is essential.
• Patients should be encouraged not to smoke, to avoid sugar-laden foods, and to
attend dental hygienist sessions regularly.
• Periodically, swabbing palate, tongue, and pharynx for oral Candida
overgrowth is prudent, especially if dysgeusia develops.
• There is merit in patients trialling topical preparations for xerophthalmia and
xerostomia as there may be personal preference to one preparation or another.
• Many patients favour the combination use of a runny eye drop for frequent use
during the day and a more viscous preparation at night or in situations where
frequent drop insertion is impracticable.
Synthetic DMARDs (sDMARDs)
• Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the most commonly used sDMARD though
evidence for its effectivity in SS is weak.
• Significant improvements have been described in a retrospective study in
terms of the sicca features, parotid gland enlargement, oral infection, myalgia,
arthralgia, fatigue, and joint swelling following 12 months of treatment with
HCQ.
• In a 2014 study reported in JAMA, HCQ was no better than placebo in
improving pain, fatigue, or dryness.
• There is no evidence that other sDMARDS or anti-TNFα therapies are
effective in primary SS.

[SECTION]Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs)
• Rituximab (RTX; anti-CD20/anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody) has only shown
short-lasting benefit in clinical trials, but may be useful for SS-related
cryoglobulinaemia or neuropathy, as well as for other coexisting immunedriven conditions, e.g. coeliac disease.
• Belimumab (anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody (B-cell activating factor, also
known as BLyS, TALL-1, and THANK), is a TNF superfamily member

Prognosis
There are few studies on the prognosis of primary SS.
• Some studies suggest the presence of vasculitis, cryoglobulins, or low

Introduction and definitions
Systemic sclerosis (SScl) is a generalized autoimmune connective tissue disease.
Scleroderma—the cutaneous lesion which is prominent and key to a diagnosis of
SScl—is epidermal-dermal tethering associated with microangiopathy and
excessive collagen production and fibrosis. Morphoea essentially describes
localized scleroderma and it can exist in a number of forms though all forms are
not associated with systemic disease/internal organ lesions (unlike in SScl).
• The classification of SScl is shown in Table 13.1.
• Raynaud’s disease (RD) describes (usually cold-induced) peripheral digital
vasospasm and is highly associated with SScl (See Plate 25).
• The spectrum of morphoea conditions includes:
• Generalized morphoea which is characterized by widespread indurated
plaques and pigmentary changes.
• Linear scleroderma is localized scleroderma, which is characterized by a
line of thickened skin which can affect the bones and muscles underneath it.
It most often occurs in the arms, legs, or forehead. It is also most likely to be
on just one side of the body. Linear scleroderma generally first appears in
young children.
• Other: morphoea profunda, morphoea-lichen sclerosis et atrophicus,

localized scleroderma, and scleroderma-like fibrosing disorders’, pp.

Epidemiology and pathophysiology of systemic
sclerosis (SScl)
Epidemiology
• The incidence and prevalence of SScl varies in different populations.
• SScl appears to be less prevalent in Europe (80–150 cases per million adults)

[SECTION]compared with the USA (276 cases per million adults).
• There is a racial difference in the prevalence of SScl—greater in Europeans
than in Asians.
• Mild disease often remains undiagnosed. Therefore, the true prevalence of
SScl is probably underestimated.
• Annual incidence is reported at 1–20 cases per million. Males and females are
both affected.
Pathophysiology
SScl is characterized by three main pathogenetic features: microvasculopathy,
immune activation with inflammation, and increase of extracellular matrix
deposition in the skin and internal organs resulting in fibrosis.
General
(For a recent review, see reference 1). Currently, the mechanisms involved in
SScl pathogenesis remain unknown and are likely to be very complex. Evidence
suggests a close connection between environmental factors and SScl
pathogenesis.
Immune cell activation and cytokines
• The activation of T cells is considered to play an important role in the
development of the vasculopathy and fibrosis in SScl.
• Activated oligoclonal CD8 T cells may be detected in the blood and lungs of
SScl patients and effector memory CD8 T cells may be involved in the
pathogenesis of organ involvement in SScl.
Genetics/epigenetics
• The genetic heritability for SScl is <0.01; however, there is a higher incidence
in patients with a family history than in the general population and a positive
family history significantly increases the relative risk (RR) of SScl by 15–19fold in siblings—indicating a genetic influence on pathogenesis.
• Epigenetic effects such as DNA methylation, histone modification, non-coding
RNA effects (microRNA) are all thought to play a key role in pathogenesis.
For example, hypomethylation of the gene encoding integrin-α9, a membrane
glycoprotein that mediates cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion, can produce an
overexpression of integrins causing myofibroblast differentiation and
increased TGFβ production promoting fibrogenesis.
Environmental factors
Several chemical agents have been implicated in the development of

[SECTION]scleroderma, although exposures account for only a small fraction of patients
who develop scleroderma or similar conditions.
• Possible chemical triggers of scleroderma include silica, organic chemicals,
aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g. vinyl chloride, naphtha), aromatic hydrocarbons
(e.g. benzene, toluene), drugs (e.g. hydroxytryptophan, carbidopa,
fenfluramine, bleomycin).
Vasculopathy
Vascular injury may be the primary pathophysiological event either by
vasomotor instability or microvascular intimal proliferation and vessel
obliteration. Intravascular pathology in the form of increased platelet activity,
red cell rigidity, and thrombosis may also be a factor.
Inflammation
Occurs early in SScl, and may no longer be present at the time of diagnosis.
Causes oedematous (not indurated) skin.
Fibrosis
Consequence of inflammation, widespread and non-organ-specific in SScl.
Excess extracellular matrix protein in the skin and internal organs.
• TGFβ plays a crucial role particularly through the activation of collagen
production that leads to fibrosis.

Classification of SScl
Classification and disease patterns
Patients with SScl have a potentially wide range of features of pathology
affecting different organ systems, and can present in varied ways. The
ACR/EULAR 2013 classification criteria for SScl (Table 13.1) have a sensitivity
of 91% and specificity of 92%.
• Clinical features are wide ranging and their classification, in association with
typical serological findings, within disease patterns is shown in Table 13.2.
• Table 13.2 highlights the two main clinical forms of SScl: limited cutaneous
(lcSScl) and diffuse cutaneous (dcSScl). Over 60% of cases are in the ‘limited’
subset, where visceral involvement is late, and some 10–30 years after onset of
Raynaud’s disease (RD).

[SECTION]• The definition of ‘limited cutaneous’ subsumes the definition of CREST
(Calcinosis, Raynaud’s disease, (o)Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly,
Telangiectasia) syndrome, although this acronym is a useful reminder of the
common characteristics of lcSScl.
• SScl can develop insidiously and in early disease non-SScl sclerodermaassociated disorders need to be considered (see Table 13.3, p. 409).

Approach to diagnosis of SScl
Differential diagnosis
The principles that underlie diagnosis include considering first whether there is a
form of systemic sclerosis (dcSScl or lcSScl; Table 13.2) or a disease that
mimics SScl (Table 13.3) or a scleroderma-associated fibrosing disease (see later
in this chapter,
‘Morphoea, localized scleroderma, and Scleroderma-like
fibrosing disorders’, p. 422. Then, if SScl is likely, establish the extent of
disease.
• The input of a dermatologist may be very helpful if a scleroderma-like
fibrosing disorder is possible.
• Nephrology input should be considered early.
• A skin biopsy should not be taken unless discussed with a dermatologist and
pathologist first and probably should only be done once the patient has seen
the dermatologist.
• The extent of involvement of SScl requires a methodological approach to
evaluating organs and bodily systems (see later in this topic).
• Assessment may be aided by an appreciation of how early or late the disease is
likely to be (Table 13.4).
Essential initial investigations
The extent of organ involvement disease should be assessed by baseline
investigations as follows:
• Blood pressure measurement and urinalysis.
• Barium swallow/GI endoscopy depending on symptoms.
• Chest radiograph and lung function tests.
• High-resolution CT lung scan if auscultation of the lungs reveals crackles or if
lung function abnormal.
• Laboratory tests: renal and liver function, paraprotein, FBC, ESR, CRP, TSH,
random glucose, ANA/ENAs; RF, complement C3, immunoglobulins.
• ECG and transthoracic echocardiography (with estimate of pulmonary artery
pressure).

[SECTION]• Nailfold capillaroscopy and distal upper limb thermography with cold
stimulation challenge (in specialist centres) can highlight abnormal patterns of
disease and can point to systemic disease in cases with limited early features.

Clinical features of SScl
Raynaud’s disease (RD)
The overall prevalence of RD is 3–10% worldwide, variation depending on
climate, skin colour, and racial background.
• In SScl, RD is present in 95% of cases.
• History: classic triphasic response to cold starting with episodic pallor of the
digits (due to ischaemia, see
Plate 25), followed by cyanosis (due to
deoxygenation), and then redness and suffusion. The last stage of redness is a
reactive hyperaemia following the return of blood and is the most painful
phase, also associated with tingling/numbness.
• Continuous blueness/cyanosis with pain is not characteristic of RD and the
main differential diagnosis then is chilblains or vasculitis.
• Symptoms that might suggest secondary RD include an onset in men, patients
>45 years, symptoms all year round, digital ulceration, and asymmetry.

[SECTION]• ANA should be tested and nail-fold capillaroscopy obtained (see Plate 9).
Pathological changes seen on capillaroscopy include nailfold capillary
dilatation, haemorrhage, and drop-out. Both have a high predictive power for
detecting those patients likely to develop SScl.
• Conservative measures should be directed at keeping the core body (i.e. base
of neck and upper trunk) temperature warm.
• Smoking cessation is essential.
• Severe RD can cause digital ulceration (DU). Ulcers can become infected and
may lead to osteomyelitis. Treatment is usually conservative with antibiotics.
• Early finger pulp tissue threat/pathology (hardening, cracks, callus and small
erythematous lesions)—can be painful. Skin infection can ensue—the process
worsened by subcutaneous calcification. Regular application of fusidic acid
and hydrocortisone cream can help soften the skin and lessen pain.
• Digital gangrene may occur following prolonged ischaemia, leading to autoamputation of digits. Surgery is usually avoided due to poor wound healing.
• RD can occur in fingers, toes, ear lobes, and even genitalia in SScl.

Skin—scleroderma
Scleroderma in dcSScl and lcSScl usually proceeds through three phases: early,
classic, late. In the early stage there may be non-pitting oedema of the hands and
feet, marked in the mornings and associated with RD. The skin then becomes
taut, the epidermis thins, hair growth ceases, and skin creases disappear—the
‘classic’ changes of scleroderma become pronounced. The classic changes
remain static for many years.
• The late phase may evolve at any time. Truncal and limb skin softens such that
it can be difficult to know that a person ever had sclerosis. However, the hand
changes rarely resolve and continue to show the ravages of fibrosis and
contractures.
• During the late phase, digital pitting scars, loss of finger pad tissue, ulcers,
telangiectasia, and calcinosis can occur.
• All patients with SScl will have some involvement of the face and the digits
(although this involvement may be mild). Skin thickening limited to the
fingers, but sparing the proximal upper extremities is called sclerodactyly.
• lcSScl is associated with skin involvement limited to the face and distal
extremities (below the elbows and knees).
• dcSScl is associated with taut hypo- or hyperpigmented skin involvement
proximal to the elbow, knee, or clavicle.
Gastrointestinal

[SECTION]The GI tract is probably the most commonly involved system in SScl (Table
13.6).
• Over 90% of all patients with lcSScl and dcSScl develop oesophageal
hypomotility, with >50% of patients with lcSScl having serious disease.
• The cause of GI dysfunction in SScl is not entirely clear. Possible contributing
factors include neural dysfunction, tissue fibrosis, and muscle atrophy. In the
earliest stages of neural dysfunction most patients are asymptomatic.
• Prokinetic drugs such as metoclopramide may help some patients with
oesophageal hypomotility.
• Many patients develop reflux oesophagitis. Simple advice such as raising the
head of the bed, taking frequent small meals, and avoiding late night snacks,
may help. Patients often require high-dose proton-pump inhibitors.
• Small bowel disease with hypomotility can lead to weight loss and
malabsorption; bacterial overgrowth may exacerbate the situation requiring
rotational courses of antibiotics and the use of prokinetic drugs. Ultimately, the
small bowel may fail, necessitating total parenteral nutrition.
• Atony and hypomotility of the rectum and sigmoid colon may cause
constipation and incontinence, best managed with bulking agents, although
severe cases may need limited surgery or the use of implantable sacral
stimulators.
• Anaemia due to vascular lesions in the GI mucosa is now widely recognized.
The classic appearance in the stomach is now called gastric antrum venous
ectasia (watermelon stomach), and these lesions may be treated by argon laser
therapy if blood loss is significant, although this is not curative.
Pulmonary and cardiac disease
Pulmonary disease ranks second to oesophageal disease in SScl in frequency of
internal organ effects (Table 13.7).
• Pulmonary disease is now the major cause of death in SScl.
• The major lesions are parenchymal lung disease (interstitial lung disease,
organizing pneumonia, and traction bronchiectasis) and pulmonary vascular
disease (isolated pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary hypertension associated
with interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary oedema).
• Far less common lung conditions include pleurisy, aspiration pneumonia,
drug-induced pneumonitis, and spontaneous pneumothorax.
• Interstitial lung disease often develops insidiously and established fibrosis is
currently untreatable. Early diagnosis is therefore vital. Most centres would
now treat active disease with oral GCs and either oral or IV
cyclophosphamide.

[SECTION]• The CXR is not a sensitive test for early fibrosis. Lung function tests can be
discriminatory. The single-breath diffusion test (diffusion capacity for carbon
monoxide (DLCO)) is abnormal in >70% of early cases and lung volumes are
often decreased.
• Low DLCO with normal lung volumes may signify pulmonary hypertension.
• High-resolution lung CT will confirm and stage lung disease and serial
imaging can be compared with changes in DLCO and functional indices (e.g.
6-min timed walking test).
• Fibrosis tends to occur mainly in dcSScl and is associated with antitopoisomerase I antibodies; and pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH)
associates with lcSScl and anti-centromere antibody.
• Heart block has been reported, but is rare.
• Severe left ventricle impairment from myocarditis is treated with
cyclophosphamide and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may be
indicated to treat ventricular arrhythmias.
• Recent studies suggest a prevalence of PAH of 12–15% in SScl.
• Right heart catheterization is the gold standard method of diagnosis, but
screening using this method is not practical. Annual transthoracic
echocardiography done by experienced practitioners, lung function tests, and
clinical assessment are essential to help detect subclinical disease.
• DETECT ( http://detect-pah.com/home) is a composite data calculator that
can be used to screen for patients with SScl who may have PAH, to identify
patients who should proceed to right heart catheter. DETECT has a sensitivity
of 96% and specificity of 48% and comprises:
• FVC% predicted/DLCO% predicted.
• current/past telangiectasia.
• anticentromere antibody.
• serum NT pro-BNP.
• serum urate.
• right-axis deviation on ECG.
• echo findings of right atrial area and TR velocity.

years.
• Historically continuous parenteral epoprostenol was used for moderate and

severe PAH. However, the treatment improves symptoms and pulmonary
artery pressures, but not mortality.
Bosentan, an oral endothelin receptor antagonist, improves function.
Sildenafil inhibits phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), enhancing relaxation of
vascular smooth muscle and also inhibits endothelial cell growth.
A recent double-blind placebo-controlled study of patients with idiopathic or
autoimmune connective tissue disease-associated PAH found that sildenafil
significantly improves the 6-min walk times and mean pulmonary artery
pressures.
Combination treatment with ambrisentan (another endothelin receptor
antagonist) and tadalafil (a PDE5 inhibitor) have improved functional status
and haemodynamics in a recent open label trial.
Macitentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist with a better side effect
profile and longer duration of action, with similar outcomes in therapy studies
of PAH.
Riociguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator that has demonstrated
efficacy in PAH.

Renal disease
Renal disease has been superseded by lung disease as the main cause of death in
SScl due to the impact of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of SScl hypertensive
renal crisis (see also Chapter 25).
• Both epithelial and endothelial damage typically occurs before becoming
clinically detectable.
• A renal crisis characteristically occurs in dcSScl within the first 5 years of
disease onset. Risk factors include exposure to prednisolone at doses >20 mg,
rapidly progressive skin disease, diffuse cutaneous disease, and the presence of
antibodies to Scl-70 or RNA polymerase III. In high-risk patients, the
incidence may be as high as 20%.
• A renal crisis presents acutely with features of hypertension, acute kidney
injury (mild haemoproteinuria and sometimes casts), micro-angiopathic
haemolytic anaemia often with thrombocytopenia and fragments on blood
film, pulmonary oedema, hypertensive retinopathy, encephalopathy, and
convulsions. Mortality may reach 10%.
• Essential basic investigations to establish any presence of renal involvement in
all patients are blood pressure measurement, urea and electrolytes, NT proBNP, troponin, serum urate, creatinine clearance, and urinalysis for
proteinuria.
• In some patients, a renal crisis can begin indolently, initially with just

[SECTION]hypertension.
• Hypertension should be treated rapidly, even in the presence of acute kidney
injury, with ACE inhibitors and titrated to aim for a target blood pressure of
<150/85 mmHg.
• Continuous epoprostenol is often also given during a renal crisis. Dialysis may
become necessary. It is important to know that considerable recovery of renal
function can be made after an acute crisis and that decisions involving renal
transplantation should be withheld for up to 2 years.
• APL antibodies or lupus anticoagulant can contribute to renal SScl disease
(including a crisis).

Treatment and prognosis of SScL
General disease treatments
Currently no treatment can induce complete remission of the disease. Some
therapies can offer partial relief and control of end-organ damage, and many of
these are advised by the 2016 BSR and BHPR guidelines for the treatment of
SScl.
• The evaluation of treatments is extremely difficult given the complexity,

[SECTION]heterogeneity, and episodic nature of SScl, as well as the paucity of patients
for recruitment.
• Active phase skin disease is treated with methotrexate (MTX) or
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1g twice daily, sometimes with low-dose
prednisolone (≤10 mg daily).
• MMF can be used for lung fibrosis when the disease not extensive.
• Tocilizumab improves skin scores in phase II trials and could be an important
new therapy for SScl.
• Cyclophosphamide may offer benefit in cardiac or lung disease.
• Rituximab is used in refractory cases of severe pulmonary fibrosis, with trial
evidence demonstrating prevention of progression of lung disease and
improvement in skin score.
• IVIg is useful in SScl overlap syndromes with myositis and may have a
beneficial effect on severe GI manifestations. There are ongoing trials
assessing IVIg effectiveness in treating skin disease.
• Autologous stem cell transplantation has been undertaken in severe SScl
disease, but has a high mortality rate.

Prognosis
SScl has the highest case-specific mortality of any autoimmune rheumatic or
connective tissue disease. However, major advances in the management of SScl
have taken place over the past decade, confirming the effectiveness of treatment.
• Estimates of 5-year mortality in SScl range from 34% to 73%. Standardized
mortality ratios have been estimated at 3–4× expected.
• Logistic regression modelling suggests three factors (proteinuria, elevated
ESR, and low DLCO) are >80% accurate at predicting mortality >5 years.
• Patients with renal crisis had a mortality of 50%, although the use of ACE
inhibitors and renal replacement therapies may have reduced this figure in
recent years.
• Anti-topoisomerase I and anti-RNA polymerase antibodies have also been
associated with a higher incidence of SScl-related mortality.
• Advances in the understanding of mechanisms leading to PAH has led to new
therapies that, with time, may show significant impact in slowing disease
progression.

Morphoea, localized scleroderma, and

[SECTION]scleroderma-like fibrosing disorders
Morphoea
Morphoea may be ‘circumscribed’ with just one or two lesions or ‘generalized’.
The generalized form may be very symptomatic and distressing as it progresses.
• The rash is often itchy, violaceous or erythematous, and progresses to firm
‘hide-bound’ skin with hypo- or hyperpigmentation and subsequent atrophy.
• The ‘circumscribed’ lesion tends to resolve within 3–5 years and treatment is
often unnecessary.
• The ‘generalized’ morphoea form can be disfiguring, leading to contractures,
ulceration, and occasionally malignancy.
• Generalized morphoea may respond to PUVA, systemic/topical or intralesional
GC, topical tacrolimus, MTX, ciclosporin, or MMF.
• Guttate morphoea is a variant with small 1 cm diameter papules and minimal
sclerosis, resembling lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. The lesions usually occur
on the neck, shoulders, and anterior chest wall.
Linear scleroderma
This describes a band-like pattern of sclerosis, often in a dermatomal
distribution. The sclerotic areas often cross over joints, and are associated with
soft tissue and bone atrophy, and growth defects.
• Treatment is similar to that previously described for generalized morphoea.
Physiotherapy and appropriate exercises may help to minimize growth defects
in the childhood form.
• En coup-de-sabre is linear sclerosis involving the face or scalp, and associated
with hemi-atrophy of the face on the same side. The lesion assumes a
depressed appearance like a scar from a sabre.
Eosinophilic fasciitis
(See also Chapter 18.)
• Characterized by the rapid spread of skin changes (‘peau d’orange’) over
extremities. Skin becomes indurated.
• Unlike SScl, the epidermis is spared (i.e. superficial wrinkling is intact) and
nail-fold capillaroscopy is normal.
• The condition may resolve spontaneously or respond to GCs.
• The condition may be a paraneoplastic phenomenon in some patients
(haematological malignancy).
• MTX and MMF can be used as well as GCs (no RCTs).
Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis

[SECTION]Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)—also known as nephrogenic fibrosing
dermopathy—is a systemic disease, which can lead to fibrosis in skeletal muscle,
myocardium, lungs, kidneys, and testes.
• NSF is characterized by the presence of skin induration, nodular plaques, and
flexion contractures in the absence of RD.
• Lesions develop over days to weeks, and initially favour the lower extremities.
• The majority of patients will have end-stage renal disease and a history of
exposure to gadolinium-based contrast.
• Histologically, NSF lesions are characterized by collagen bundles surrounded
by fibroblast-like epithelioid or stellate cells, and mucin deposition, which can
extend into the fascia and muscles.
• Response to immunosuppressive agents is disappointing.
• Early institution of physical therapy to prevent contractures and muscle
wasting is important. Pain management may be especially challenging.
Scleromyxoedema
Is characterized by waxy induration of the skin along the forehead (glabella), the
neck, and behind the ears.
• Scleromyxoedema may also affect the middle of the back, which is generally
spared in SScl.
• Scleromyxoedema can be associated with oesophageal dysmotility and
myopathy.
• Case reports have shown an association with severe neurological sequelae,
including encephalopathy, seizures, coma, and psychosis.
• Scleromyxoedema may respond to IVIg.
Scleroedema
Scleroedema is a fibromucinous connective tissue disease, a scleroderma-like
disorder associated with doughy induration of the skin along the back, neck,
face, and chest.
• Unlike in SScl, the extremities are typically spared.
• It is seen in association with poorly controlled diabetes, monoclonal
gammopathy or following infections (e.g. Streptococcus).
• Prognosis depends on the underlying aetiology. Scleroedema that occurs after
infection may resolve spontaneously. Scleroedema associated with diabetes
may improve with better glucose control.
• For some patients, ultraviolet light therapy (such as UVA-1, PUVA, and
photopheresis) may be beneficial.

Idiopathic inflammatory myositis
General considerations and classification
The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of
conditions characterized by varied patterns of inflammation within striated
muscle and evidence of autoimmune-mediated muscle breakdown. The IIMs are
believed to be autoimmune in nature. They have distinct pathological features,
but the aetiopathogenesis of each subtype remains largely unknown.
• The strongest genetic association of IIMs is with HLA class II alleles. In
Caucasians, HLA-DRB1*0301 and -DQA1*0501 are strongly associated,
compared to HLA-B7 in Asian populations. HLA-DQA1*01 seems to be a
protective factor.
• Proximal, symmetrical, and painless weakness of muscles is the hallmark of
IIMs.
• Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the most common forms of
IIM, the latter distinguished by the presence of a characteristic rash.
• Overlap with other autoimmune diseases occur in 15–20% of cases.
• The classification of IIM conditions is shown in Box 14.1.
• Secondary causes of myopathies are discussed later in this chapter.

[SECTION]• IIM has an estimated incidence of 2–8 per million.
• PM and DM are more common in women than in men (2:1), and peak
incidence is at 50–60 years old.
• The F:M ratio is lower in myositis associated with malignancy, and higher
during childbearing years (5:1).
• There is a latitude gradient of prevalence of PM and DM. DM is more
common closer to the equator correlating directly with UV-light irradiation,
and PM is more common in northern countries.
• The criteria for PM and DM diagnosis are shown in Box 14.2.
• The principal features of PM and DM are listed in Table 14.1.

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis
Application of the criteria for diagnosis of PM or DM assumes infective, toxic,
metabolic, dystrophy, and endocrine myopathies are excluded.
Pathogenesis
• DM has been conceptualized traditionally as a complement-mediated
microangiopathy, but this paradigm has limitations.
• PM arises from a cytotoxic T-cell immune-mediated inflammation on muscle.
• Type I interferon signature is upregulated in DM and PM, but not in IBM.
• Aberrant expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins
contributes to muscle damage both directly and indirectly in all subtypes of
IIM.
• A characteristic pattern of autoantibody production often occurs, in PM and
DM and in overlap myositis disorders.
• There is evidence of inflammasome complex activity in the IIMs.

[SECTION]• Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are upregulated in IIMs and may link innate and
adaptive immune processes.
• Autophagy is upregulated in IIM tissue, particularly within regenerating
myofibres, and this may occur via activation of TLR3 and TLR4.
• Immature and regenerating muscle cells may perpetuate the immune-mediated
attack in IIMs.
Clinical features
Myositis
• Muscle weakness is the main clinical feature in both conditions and is almost
universal, tending to develop insidiously over months, but occasionally with
great speed.
• Weakness is usually symmetrical and diffuse, involving the proximal muscles
of the neck, shoulders, trunk, hips, and thighs. The lower limb muscles tend to
be clinically symptomatic first.
• Weakness of the distal muscles is rare, but can occur late in the disease. The
face and ocular muscles may also be involved.
• Myalgia occurs in about 50% of cases: it can be mild and sometimes difficult
to distinguish from polymyalgia rheumatica.
• There may be muscle atrophy in chronic disease, more so in PM than DM, and
contractures may occur in disease of long duration.
• Often the distinction between autoimmune rheumatic disease overlapping with
PM or DM and an autoimmune rheumatic disease with myositis as a
manifestation can be very difficult.
Box 14.2 Diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of PM and DM
1. Symmetrical proximal muscle weakness developing over weeks or
months.
2. Elevated serum muscle enzymes: creatine kinase (CK), aldolase, AST,
ALT, and lactate dehydrogenase.
3. Typical electromyographic findings: myopathic potentials (low amplitude,
short duration, polyphasic) fibrillation, positive sharp waves, increased
insertional activity, complex repetitive discharges.
4. Typical muscle biopsy findings.
5. Dermatological features of DM:
• Gottron’s papules, involving fingers, elbows, knees, and medial malleoli.
• Heliotrope sign around the eyes.
• Erythematous and/or poikilodermatous rash.

Skin and cutaneous disease
• The rash of DM commonly precedes the weakness by weeks to months. The
rash may parallel the weakness or remain independent, persisting after the
myositis resolves.
• Erythematous or violaceous papules or plaques (Gottron’s papules) or macular
patches (Gottron’s sign) may occur over the metacarpophalangeal and
proximal (occasionally distal) interphalangeal joints. The rash is present in up
to 80% of cases.
• Occasionally, these lesions may be found on the extensor surfaces of the
knees, wrists, elbows, or medial malleoli.
• Periungual abnormalities affecting the capillary nailbeds in DM and PM with
erythema and in some cases tenderness can be seen.
• Vascular changes observed at the nailbed resemble those found in other
connective tissue diseases, e.g. systemic sclerosis and SLE. Abnormal
capillary loops may alternate with areas of vascular dilatation and dropout.
• A macular eruption may involve the upper chest, neck, shoulders, extremities,
face, and scalp. This may develop into poikiloderma, hyper- or
hypopigmentation with atrophy and telangiectasia. Typical features include the
‘V’ sign at the base of the neck anteriorly, and the ‘shawl’ sign at the back of
the neck and across the shoulders.
• The heliotrope rash, found in 30–60% of cases, is a purple/lilac coloured
suffusion around the eyes, often associated with periorbital oedema. It is
characteristic, but not pathognomonic.
• Some patients have typical cutaneous DM, but do not develop overt myositis.
The term ‘amyopathic DM’ is applied. The same risk of malignancy and
systemic complications remains.
• Calcinosis, cutaneous vasculitis, and ulceration are more common in juvenile
DM.
Joints
Coexistent polyarthralgia is quite common. It is usually non-erosive and
glucocorticoid (GC) responsive.

[SECTION]Cardiac disease
• Clinical features of heart involvement are rare in PM and DM.
• Asymptomatic subclinical manifestations are often reported, and can occur in
up to 70% of patients. These are mainly conduction abnormalities and
arrhythmias detected by ECG.
• Cardiovascular disease is a major risk factor for death in myositis, and should
therefore not be overlooked. The most frequently overt manifestations are
congestive heart failure, conduction abnormalities, and coronary heart disease.
• The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms responsible include
myocarditis, coronary artery disease, and involvement of the small vessels of
the myocardium.
Pulmonary
• Shortness of breath may be a consequence of diaphragmatic and intercostal
muscle weakness (as well as other causes that will be discussed later), and
should be assessed.
• ILD is common, with a variable response to immunosuppression.
Gastrointestinal
• Dysphagia occurs in up to 30%.
• Cricopharyngeal myotomy is occasionally needed.
Malignancy
• Studies suggest a modest increase in malignancies within 1–2 years of onset in
DM. In the majority of cases, cancer and myositis have an independent course.
• The largest population studies suggest malignancy occurs in 15% of cases of
DM (relative risk in men 2.4/in women 3.4) and 9% of cases of PM (relative
risk in men 1.8/in women 1.7).
• Cancer deaths in studies suggest an increase in DM, but not PM, supporting a
true association with DM, rather than a study bias due to intensive searching.
• The highest cancer risk appears to be in men >45 years with DM who lack
myositis autoantibodies or overlap autoimmune connective tissue disease.
• Tumours that are frequent in the general population are frequent in PM and
DM. However, there appears to be an increase in ovarian, breast, lung,
stomach, colon, and bladder cancers out of proportion to that of other tumours.
• The extent of investigations required is debated. Thorough physical
assessment should always include rectal, pelvic, and breast examination.
Specific investigations should include a chest radiograph, urinalysis, prostatespecific antigen in men, faecal occult blood testing, mammography, and

[SECTION]cervical smear, and probably pelvic ultrasound and CA125 levels in women.
• Further bowel investigations are open to debate and determined by individual
patient symptoms. An elevated ALT may be from muscle and need not
indicate liver pathology.
• Malignancy can manifest as paraneoplastic myopathy (see Chapter 4).
Clinical assessments
Features suggesting an alternative diagnosis to IIM
It is important to consider whether there are features of non-inflammatory
myopathy, which may point towards storage diseases, genetic myopathies, and
neuropathy.
• Drug history: a number of medications are associated with causing myositis
(Table 14.2).
• Weakness/cramp worsened by exercise or dietary changes (e.g. fasting,
carbohydrate intake), which might suggest a metabolic or mitochondrial
myopathy.
• Muscle atrophy without pain or hypertrophy can suggest a muscular
dystrophy.
• Fasciculation or myotonia and other neurological signs may suggest a primary
neurological disease (e.g. motor neuron disease).
• Facial and shoulder girdle muscle involvement may suggest
facioscapulohumeral dystrophy.
• A family history of myopathy may suggest a genetic myopathy.

Assessment of disease impact
See Table 14.3.
Changes in muscle strength and function may change slowly with indolent
disease, or with treatment, and measures of long-term muscle and general
function are important to take regularly. General (Likert scale) patient and
physician global disease activity scores are easy to take and reproduce:
• HAQ or SF36 may be used.
• Muscle metrology from an experienced physiotherapist.
• The manual muscle test (MMT) is the most often used test of muscle strength,
although only partly validated in adult myositis.
• Quantitative muscle atrophy (e.g. by MRI).
• Several scales of composite measures are available e.g. MYOACT (activity)
and MYODAM (damage) and MDI (disease index). The latter have recently
been demonstrated to have good construct and validity in adult and juvenile
IIM.1,2

Investigations
The investigation of potential malignancy in DM/PM has been discussed earlier
in this chapter.
Muscle enzymes
• Serum levels of enzymes released from damaged muscle are helpful in the
diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. Creatine kinase (CK) is most widely
used. Aldolase may be more sensitive in some cases.
• There are a number of other causes for raised CK levels (Table 14.4). Muscle
bulk influences the CK levels. But it is also possible, despite active myositis,
for the CK levels not be elevated (i.e. relative chronic muscle atrophy). In
these cases, imaging such as MRI may be a useful indicator of
damage/severity.
• The isoenzyme CK-MB can be elevated in myositis and less often in
myocarditis. It is released from regenerating skeletal muscle fibres and also
damaged myocardiocytes.
• As a guide, patients with myositis without cardiac involvement may have a
CK-MB/total CK ratio of >3%.
• A more specific marker for myocardial damage in myositis is the cardiac
isoform troponin I.
• Other cardiac troponin isoforms such as troponin C (cTnC) and troponin T
(cTnT) are less specific and expressed in skeletal muscle, hence levels can be
raised in various muscle disorders.
Muscle biopsy
• All patients should have a muscle biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to
exclude conditions that may resemble IIM.
• There is an argument for not obtaining a biopsy in patients with proximal
weakness, elevated enzymes, typical EMG changes, a rash of DM, confirmed
myositis-specific autoantibodies, or an overlap autoimmune rheumatic disease
and myositis-associated autoantibodies.

[SECTION]• For most patients however, it is important to remember that the mimics of IIM
are more common than the IIMs themselves. Therefore, patients with a clinical
diagnosis of PM/DM who do not respond to immunosuppressive treatment as
expected should have a biopsy in order to confirm an alternative diagnosis.
• A negative biopsy does not exclude myositis, as inflammatory changes can be
focal. Therefore the site of biopsy should be preferably from a symptomatic
muscle which is not atrophic.
• Muscle biopsy samples are stained with haematoxylin and eosin.
• Further immunohistochemical staining for MHC class antigens provide
additional useful information. The presence of MHC class I and II antigens in
muscle fibres is a feature of inflamed muscles tissue.
• There are important histological descriptions that associate with specific
diagnoses:
• Fibre hypertrophy suggests dystrophy.
• Inclusion bodies are seen in IBM.
• Widespread necrosis with profuse regeneration is the typical finding in
rhabdomyolysis.
• Inflammation affects striated muscle and occasionally heart muscle, but not
smooth muscle.
• Histologically, the cellular infiltrates of skeletal muscle involve mainly T
lymphocytes and macrophages. Dendritic cells, B cells, and plasma cells can
also be found.
• IIMs often have specific biopsy features:
• In DM, there are mainly perivascular and perimysial inflammatory
infiltrates with a predominance of CD4+ T cells.
• In PM, there is endomysial (intramuscular) inflammatory infiltrates with a
predominance of CD8+ T cells causing destruction of muscle fibres and
fatty replacement.
• In IBM, the early disease may be indistinguishable from the histological
appearances of PM. Characteristic findings are intracellular amyloid
deposits or basophilic intracellular vacuoles (‘inclusion bodies’) seen on
electron microscopy.
• Optimal processing, evaluation, and minimizing of artefacts require
coordination with the pathologist prior to biopsy, to ensure appropriate
handling of samples and maximum diagnostic information.

Autoantibodies
• Autoantibodies are present in ~60–70% of patients with PM and DM. The
main antibody is antinuclear antibody (ANA).

[SECTION]• Myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) are associated with specific clinical
phenotypes, and favour PM/DM over other myopathies.
• The most prevalent MSA is an antibody directed against histidyl transfer RNA
synthetase (anti-Jo1) present in around 11–33% of patients with PM/DM.
• Histidyl is one of a number of amino-acyl transfer RNA synthetase relevant
targets for antibody formation.
• The various clinical associations of the main myositis-associated (MAAs) and
MSAs are shown in Table 14.5.
• Anti-signal recognition peptide (SRP) antibodies occur in ~5% of myositis
patients and herald an acute-onset aggressive disease. It is not linked to skin
manifestations. Muscle biopsy tends to show a necrotizing myopathy with few
inflammatory cells. Treatment response is often poor.
• Anti-Mi2 and anti-CADM-140 are found in 10–20% of DM cases.
• Statin-induced myopathy is associated with anti-HMG-CoA antibodies. The
presence of these antibodies is not linked to statin exposure in every case.
• Anti-p155/p140 (anti-MJ) is found in up to 25% of cases of juvenile DM and
is associated with calcinosis.
• Detailed description of all MAAs/MSAs is beyond this text. New antibodies
are described regularly. It is worth noting up-to-date publications in this area
given that antibody immunological tests through specialist labs can help in
difficult cases where malignancy and drugs are being considered as causes.
Electromyography
• Electromyography (EMG) cannot establish the diagnosis of PM/DM with
certainty, but can demonstrate a myopathic process, and help to exclude
neuropathies and distinguish some myopathies.
• 90% of patients will have abnormal EMG studies.
• Early findings include low-amplitude, short-duration, polyphasic potentials,
with early recruitment and full interference patterns (i.e. more fibres are
required to achieve a given force). The latter features are in contrast to
neuropathies where there is decreased recruitment and interference.
• With time, re-innervation of denervated fibres leads to high-amplitude, longduration, polyphasic potentials.
• Other features include spontaneous activity in up to 75% of cases, fibrillations,
and repetitive discharges akin to myotonia, but of constant amplitude and
starting and stopping abruptly.
Imaging
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), computed tomography

[SECTION]•

•

(CT), 99mTc, and thallium have been used to assess the distribution of disease.
MRI with T2-weighted images and fat suppression or short tau inversion
recovery (STIR) is best at identifying areas of muscle inflammation, atrophy,
or fatty infiltration.
On MRI, active myositis results in the appearance of fluid signal changes in
muscle—interpreted as oedema.
When evaluating a patient for weakness, MRI may be particularly useful in
distinguishing weakness due to active inflammation from weakness due to
previous damage or GC myopathy (which would not be expected to show
muscle oedema).
Because muscle involvement may be patchy, MRI can help identify an optimal
site for muscle biopsy.

[SECTION]Other tests
• The ESR is elevated in 50% of cases, but correlates poorly with disease
activity and response to therapy.
• CRP is not specific; high levels suggest a concurrent infection.
• Complement levels in PM/DM are usually normal.
• Proteinuria may be the result of myoglobinuria.
• Serial spirometry for respiratory muscle weakness may be required.

Treatment
Treatment should be started promptly pending completion of investigations,
particularly in acute-onset weakness, dysphagia, respiratory insufficiency, and
systemic complications.
• GCs have never been tested adequately in randomized, placebo-controlled
trials, but are the cornerstone of therapy.
• 90% of patients will have at least a partial response to GC therapy. Most
require treatment with a GC-sparing agent to maintain disease remission and
to minimize GC exposure.
• An exercise programme helps improve fatigue and muscle strength. Exercise
should be used with caution during periods of disease activity, but there is no
evidence that it causes prolonged worsening in muscle enzyme levels or
inflammation.
Glucocorticoids.
See also p. 660
• Most clinicians use a starting oral prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg until a
decline in CK and/or a substantial improvement in muscle strength is seen.
• Lower GC doses of 0.5 mg/kg may be sufficient. Severe cases (or extraskeletal
involvement) may be treated with IV methylprednisolone 0.5–1 g/day for 3
days before starting oral prednisolone.
• As high doses are required for several months, early vitamin D/calcium
supplementation and bisphosphonates should be considered to prevent GCinduced osteoporosis.
• IIM patients are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis also due to
decreased skeletal loading and immobility.
• A case–control study has also shown that most IIM patients have low serum
levels of vitamin D. This may confer a risk factor for developing adult
myositis, suggesting vitamin D replacement therapy is important.
• Most patients will respond to treatment, but this can be slow and partial. CK

[SECTION]levels often improve quicker than any apparent improvement in strength.
• Failure to respond despite 4–6 months of treatment may be due to one of
several reasons (especially if the ANA is negative):
• Incorrect diagnosis.
• Hereditary myopathy or ‘inclusion-body’ myositis.
• GC myopathy.
• Permanent loss of strength.
• No response to GC therapy.
Synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs). See also
pp. 662–80
• Methotrexate (MTX) and azathioprine (AZA) have demonstrable efficacy;
AZA may be a better option for patients with ILD or hepatitis, but may take
longer to show effectiveness.
• Studies have shown a synergistic effect of MTX and AZA where a single drug
has failed.
• Cyclophosphamide (CYC) has had variable results and is used in resistant
cases or in those cases where there is severe extraskeletal involvement such as
vasculitis or lung disease.
• Tacrolimus has been used in refractory patients with PM/DM-ILD, with
improvement in muscle strength, lung function, and cutaneous manifestations.
• Ciclosporin can be a useful therapy in patients where MTX and AZA have
been ineffective/not tolerated. It has been used in combination with MTX or
IVIg.
• Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and chlorambucil have been reported to
achieve disease remission in some refractory cases.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)
• Efficacy of IVIg has been demonstrated in small double-blind controlled trials
and one open-label trial, showing significant clinical improvement in muscle
strength and reduction in CK levels after 3 months of treatment, compared
with placebo.
• Case reports have suggested efficacy of IVIg in the treatment of PM/DM-ILD,
and it has been used in one case of refractory amyopathic DM-ILD with good
response.
• High-dose regimens in the form of 2 g/kg/day for 2–5 days every month for 3–
6 months have been advocated, and can be used concomitantly with other
sDMARDs.
• Duration of efficacy of each treatment may be limited to a few months, but the

[SECTION]dose or interval can be changed based on severity of disease and treatment
responsiveness.
• A major advantage of IVIg is that it is safe to use in the context of active
infections, but its high cost may restrict long-term use. There is also a risk of
tachyphylaxis.
Biologic therapies
There is growing interest in evaluating biologics that target various pathways
involved in the pathogenesis of IIM.
• Anti-TNFα therapy has been studied in small patient series. There have been
suggestions that it may trigger IIM, therefore they should be used with caution.
• In open label studies, rituximab (RTX) has been used in refractory DM with
reports of clinical improvement.
• The first placebo-phase trial to assess the efficacy of RTX in refractory
myositis did not show a significant difference between the two treatment
groups.
• A recent summary of published evidence for RTX effect in IIM suggested a
majority of patients derived benefit though markers of response varied and
there was of course marked heterogeneity of disease at the outset.
• Further research is required to assess the role of biologic therapies though
many treatments have been tried (Table 14.6).
Treatment of extramuscular disease
• The rash of DM may respond to the treatment of the myositis. If lesions
persist, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) at 200–400 mg/day or topical tacrolimus
may be of benefit. Photosensitivity can respond to sunscreens. Topical GCs are
often not successful.
• The treatment of amyopathic DM is controversial. Sunscreens and HCQ can
be used and in some severe cases, GCs or immunosuppressives are justified
for the cutaneous disease. If treatment is withheld due to an absence of
myositis, the patient should be followed closely, especially in the first 2 years
after onset to avoid delay in treatment should myositis develop.
• Calcinosis, principally a problem in juvenile disease, is difficult to treat and
does not respond to immunosuppression. Surgical resection may help for
accessible deposits.
• Active exercise is discouraged during acute inflammation, but passive range of
motion exercises should be commenced early to avoid joint contractures.
Isometric exercise should be introduced once inflammation subsides. This
must be supervised by a physiotherapist to avoid muscle overuse.

[SECTION]• ILD is managed as in other autoimmune connective tissue diseases with oral
GCs and oral or IV CYC.
• Distal oesophageal dysmotility does not generally respond to
immunosuppression, but measures similar to treatment of reflux may help.
Prognosis in PM and DM
• PM and DM are diseases with a high mortality and morbidity. One
retrospective study estimated a mortality rate of 22%, mostly due to
malignancy and pulmonary disease.
• In most cases, the course of disease is either monophasic, remitting/relapsing,
or chronic progressive.
• A small number (5–10%) make a full recovery following treatment.
• The use of prolonged immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of
infection, especially with unusual organisms.
• Case reports have described atypical mycobacterial infections in patients with
long-standing PM/DM.
• A worse prognosis is associated with increasing age, bulbar muscle, and
cardiopulmonary involvement.

Inclusion-body myositis
• Inclusion-body myositis (IBM) is a distinct disorder that comprises 20–30% of
idiopathic myositis cases. IBM usually begins after the age of 50 years and is
3× more common in men. The difficulty in distinguishing it from PM and its
insidious onset can lead to considerable delay in diagnosis by 3–5 years.
• Distal weakness and wasting can be as common as proximal, often involving
the lower limbs before the upper, and sparing the face.
• Unlike PM or DM, IBM can present with diminished hand-grip strength, in
addition to proximal muscle weakness.
• Dysphagia is a feature in 40% of cases, and myalgias in 20%.
• An open biopsy (as opposed to needle biopsy) is essential to diagnose IBM.
• A needle biopsy may not be sufficient to allow the recognition of important
clues that point away from other forms of myositis.
• There is a significant inflammatory component early in the disease course, that
may partially respond to GCs, though generally patients are usually nonresponsive to GCs.
• There may be a period of stabilization for a few months but this may reflect
the natural history of disease.
• Prolonged administration of GCs may result in worsening of disease despite

[SECTION]improvements in CK levels.
• Treatment usually begins with high-dose GCs for 3 months, adding in MTX or
AZA if clinical improvement or in patients with another autoimmune
connective tissue disease. If there is continued decline in strength or function,
immunosuppression should be discontinued.
• Anti-T-lymphocyte globulin, interferon-β, MMF, and anabolic GCs such as
oxandrolone, may have beneficial effects as in some reports.
• Weakness will progress in most patients but this is often very slow. Patients
may need assistance with daily activities within 10 years and some may be
wheelchair bound within 15 years from onset of symptoms.

Other (adult) inflammatory myopathies
Drug-induced myopathies
• The range of myositis severity caused by different drugs varies, from
asymptomatic increases in CK to necrotizing severe myopathies resulting in
rhabdomyolysis.
• HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can cause myalgia and cramps along
with an elevated CK level and may be exacerbated by the use of other drugs
(ciclosporin and fibrates) or other diseases (hypothyroidism).
• Patients on any drugs suspected of causing myositis, presenting with myalgia,
should have their renal function and CK checked and the drug stopped.
• See Table 14.2, p. 431 for an overview.
PM/DM with interstitial lung disease
Polymyositis or dermatomyositis occurring together with interstitial lung disease
(PM/DM-ILD) may be a distinct condition.
• Characteristic features include myositis, ILD, Raynaud’s disease, ‘mechanic’s
hands’ (i.e. dry, cracked skin across the digits), and small joint polyarthritis.
• Associated with a range of autoantibodies directed against aminoacyl transfer
RNA synthetases including histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HRS; termed the antiJo1 autoantibody).
• Anti-Jo-1 is present in ~20% of PM/DM patients and titre of antibody can be
associated with disease activity.
• Can be associated with fevers at onset or during flares.
• Some patients presenting with ILD or arthritis may go on to develop myositis
later, so presentation of components of the disease may not be concordant.
• Patients need to be managed with a chest physician monitoring lung function
tests and inflammatory disease activity.

[SECTION]• CYC, MMF, and RTX give alternative choices for therapies in addition to
GCs.

Juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy
Introduction
• The juvenile IIMs are heterogeneous inflammatory conditions in young people
<17 years of age characterized by proximal myopathy, rashes, and other organ
involvement.
• Juvenile IIMs are classified into groups that share similar clinical and
laboratory features, treatment responses, and prognosis.
• The juvenile IIMs are:
• juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM): 80%.
• juvenile polymyositis (JPM): 5%.
• overlap myositis: 10%.
• rare forms: macrophagic myofasciitis, focal myositis, granulomatous, and
graft-vs-host myositis.
• inclusion body myositis and cancer associated myositis are exceptionally
rare in children.
• A form of inclusion body myositis also occurs in critical illness myopathy seen
in intensive care units.
• Benign acute childhood myositis is self-limiting and typically presents with
calf pain, walking difficulty, and very high CK levels.
• Benign acute myositis can be misdiagnosed as something more severe or
complex resulting in unnecessary tests, admission, and follow-up.
• Although the 1975 ‘Bohan and Peter’ criteria6 remain in principle the
diagnostic criteria (see Box 14.2, p. 427), the invasive nature of EMG and
biopsy means they are rarely used and MRI and US are often substituted for
confirmation of muscle involvement.
Differential diagnosis of muscle weakness in childhood
Muscle weakness may be a sign of muscle disease or a manifestation of a muscle
function-related pathology or even general pathology.
• Viral myositis or benign acute childhood myositis.
• Drug-induced myopathy.
• Critical illness myopathy (e.g. patients in intensive care units).
• Muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy.
• Juvenile fibromyalgia.
• Other multisystem inflammatory diseases (MCTD, SLE, vasculitis).

[SECTION]• Skeletal dysplasias.
• Electrolyte imbalances (potassium and calcium).
Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM)
• JDM is by far the commonest inflammatory myopathy in children and
adolescents and in typical circumstances does not require a search for
neoplasia.
• The incidence is 2–4 per million (USA and UK) with a median age of onset of
7 years old (25% are <4 years old at diagnosis).
• Presentation is typically with a classical rash and insidious onset of muscle
weakness.
• A facial rash is common with a photosensitive malar distribution and
nasolabial-sparing characteristic of SLE.
• Distinguishing JDM from SLE is important. With JDM there are shiny raised
red marks on the knuckles, elbows, knees, and ankles (Gottron’s papules) and
a dusky purple-red hue to the upper eyelids (heliotrope rash).
• Weakness manifests as difficulty getting upstairs or out of bed, difficulty with
putting on a jumper or T-shirt, or tiring more quickly than usual during sport.
• Other features include low-grade fever, weight loss, arthralgia, abdominal
pain, melaena, change in character of voice, and difficulty swallowing.
• ILD and dilated cardiomyopathy may occur in chronic disease.
• The clinical course of JDM falls into different patterns:
• Monocyclic (lasting up to 3 years) in 25–40%.
• Polycyclic (periods of remission and relapse relapse) or chronic, both of
which can be lifelong, in 50–60%.
• Ulcerative in 10–20%.
Myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs)
• MSAs have been identified in ~70% of JDM patients.
• All autoantibodies are seen in JDM. More common MSAs include:
• anti-TIF1-gamma associated with classical JDM (18%), extensive skin
involvement (and lipodystrophy), and chronic course.
• anti-MJ, anti-NPX2 (15%): both associated with a monocyclic course, but
more severe calcinosis, dysphonia, and joint contractures.
• MDA5 (6%): patients are less likely to be weak, but cutaneous ulceration
and arthritis are common. Associated ILD is uncommon.
Treatment
• Managing JDM requires a multidisciplinary approach to optimize muscle
strength, function, and quality of life while controlling inflammation of skin,

muscle, gut, and other organs, and aiming to avoid calcinosis evolving.
Calcinosis cutis (occurring in up to 35% of JDM cases) can be a major cause
of morbidity due to pain, cosmetic problems, tethering of skin, muscles, and
nerves, and as a nidus for infection.
GCs are the mainstay of treatment and universally supplemented with
synthetic DMARDs (MTX, HCQ, ciclosporin, and IVIg).
Early aggressive treatment to rapidly and completely control inflammation is
essential to fully restore muscle function and avoid damage and calcinosis.
Consensus guidelines (CARRA 2012, USA) recommend escalating
immunosuppression for the first 2 months depending on disease severity.
The treatment regimens utilize SC MTX, and a GC tapering schedule based on
weight and severity of disease (e.g. see Table 3 in reference 7).
IV methylprednisolone is added for rapid induction especially for severe
disease and to replace oral prednisolone when there is gut involvement.
If there is initial clinical improvement, then prednisolone dose is reduced at
weekly intervals initially and then monthly at lower doses with the aim of
being off GCs by 10–12 months.
CYC is typically used for ulcerative cases, severe muscle disease, and ILD.
IVIg is used for refractory and skin-predominant disease, or when there is
severe weakness.
More recently MMF, RTX, and anti-TNFα agents have been used for
refractory disease.

Amyopathic JDM
• Has the characteristic rash but no obvious muscle disease, although typically
muscle inflammation and weakness is subclinical and insidious in onset.
• Amyopathic JDM is not generally associated with calcinosis or ILD.
Overlap myositis
• Occurs with scleroderma, SLE, JIA, Sjögren’s disease, and type 1 diabetes and
more often in non-Caucasian populations.
• It is often associated with Raynaud’s and ILD resulting in a higher mortality.
Juvenile polymyositis
• Is very rare and results in more clinically apparent proximal and distal muscle
weakness with little skin involvement.
• It is usually severe at onset with very high CK levels, affects older children
(adolescents), and frequently has cardiac involvement.
• A muscle biopsy is required to differentiate from muscular dystrophy and
shows endomysial infiltrates.

Large vessel vasculitis
Takayasu arteritis
Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis
Polyarteritis nodosa
ANCA-associated vasculitides
Small vessel vasculitis
Childhood-onset vasculitides

Introduction
• The vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of relatively uncommon diseases
that can arise as primary conditions or secondary to an established disease
such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (see
Chapter 5) or systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) (see Chapter 13).
• The vasculitides are linked by the presence of vascular inflammation, which
can lead to one of two common outcomes:
• Vessel wall destruction: leading to aneurysm or rupture.
• Stenosis: leading to tissue ischaemia and necrosis.
• In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) developed a
classification system based on vessel size, with the inclusion of a division
between primary and secondary vasculitis (Table 15.1).
• This classification system is not perfect. Patients with ‘large vessel vasculitis’
and ‘small vessel vasculitis’ can have disease that affects some medium-sized
vessels. Moreover, not all patients with ‘antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
(ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV)’ have detectable levels of ANCA.
However, this is a useful framework for the clinician, since categorizing the
patient into one of these groups can narrow the differential diagnosis

considerably.
The Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) in 1994 had developed the
most widely used nomenclature system for most forms of vasculitis. This was
revised in the 2012 CHCC to include new insights gained over the past two
decades, add new forms of vasculitis, and address issues surrounding
eponyms. (Box 15.1).
The notable changes of the 2012 CHCC are:
• the adoption of new names for several conditions, consistent with the trend
of replacing eponyms with disease names that reflect pathology.
• formally adopting the term ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) for the major
systemic small vessel vasculitis subtypes.
• adoption of additional categories to include variable vessel vasculitis and
secondary forms of vasculitis.
This nomenclature does not substitute the classification criteria.
The AAVs have a predilection for the respiratory tract and kidneys.
The AAVs are granulomatosis and polyangiitis (GPA; formerly Wegener’s
granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; formerly Churg–Strauss syndrome).

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
• ANCA exists in two main forms based on neutrophil autoantibody
immunofluorescence patterns:
• Cytoplasmic (C-ANCA; antibodies against proteinase-3 (PR3)).
• Perinuclear (P-ANCA; antibodies against myeloperoxidase (MPO)).
• Other ANCA-staining patterns (i.e. non-cytoplasmic, non-perinuclear) can
occur.
• P-ANCA pattern may be caused by antibodies against antigens other than
myeloperoxidase. These are sometimes referred to as ‘atypical ANCA’, and do
not predict the presence of vasculitis, although they can be found in
inflammatory bowel disease, immune-mediated neutropenia, and other
autoimmune diseases.
• C-ANCA is found in patients with GPA.
• Patients with MPA and EGPA tend to be P-ANCA positive.
• Counterintuitively, patients with AAV can be ANCA negative in up to 50% of
cases.
• AAV patients with active or untreated disease are more likely to be ANCA
positive.

[SECTION]• The role that ANCAs play in the pathogenesis of vasculitis remains
controversial.

General principles of vasculitis management
• To be complete, any evaluation of a chronic disease (such as primary systemic
vasculitis) must include both an assessment of disease activity and of disease
damage. The concept of damage denotes the aspects of disease that are
unlikely to reverse with immunosuppression (such as pulmonary fibrosis or
renal insufficiency).
• Clinical trials of vasculitis commonly use the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity
Score (BVAS) and Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI) to assess activity and
damage, respectively.

[SECTION]• Other clinical indices exist. The French Vasculitis Study Group (FVSG) has
developed a prognostic Five-Factor Score (FFS). This index provides another
useful method of classifying patients with vasculitis. Patients with PAN or
AAV who have a FFS >0 have substantially higher mortality than patients with
a FFS = 0.
• The FFS was revised in 2008, and now includes the following: age >65, renal
insufficiency, cardiac involvement, and gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations.
The presence of ear, nose, and throat signs was found to correlate with an
improved outcome among patients with GPA.

Large vessel vasculitis
• The ‘large vessels’ include the aorta and its main branches (i.e. the subclavian,
carotid, and brachiocephalic arteries). Primary and secondary forms of large
vessel vasculitis are shown in Table 15.2.
• The classic forms of primary large vessel vasculitis are TA (see ‘Takayasu
arteritis’, pp. 454–455) and giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is associated with
PMR.
• Recent studies demonstrate that many patients with polymyalgia rheumatica
(PMR) have subclinical aortic inflammation, which seems to validate this
classification scheme.
• The clinical manifestations of large vessel vasculitis can be predicted by the
pattern of vessel involvement. Arch aortitis leads to aneurysmal dilatation and
aortic regurgitation. Subclavian involvement causes arm claudication and
diminished pulses on examination. Carotid involvement may lead to visual
loss, jaw claudication, and stroke. Involvement of any major blood vessel may
cause bruits of physical examination.

Takayasu arteritis
Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic granulomatous arteritis that affects the aorta
and the great vessels. The pulmonary arteries can also be involved, although this
is relatively uncommon.
Epidemiology
• It is most common in Japan, Southeast Asia, India, and Mexico. It is rare in the
UK and in the USA, its annual incidence is estimated at 2.6 per million, where
it is not limited to patients of Asian descent—the majority of patients in the
USA are Caucasian.
• TA tends to affect women (90% of cases) with adolescents and young adults
20–40 years old at greatest risk.
• The hallmark of the disease is arteritic inflammatory infiltrates that cause
luminal narrowing or occlusion presenting with bruits, claudication, and
diminished (or asymmetric) pulses.
Presentation
• Systemic symptoms are common in the early phase of the disease, including
fever, malaise, weight loss, and fatigue.
• As the disease progresses, consequences of vascular inflammation and
insufficiency can become apparent.
• Arthralgias and myalgias are common.
• Clinically evident synovitis is rare.
• Lightheadedness, visual disturbance, and strokes can occur. Subclavian steal
can be an important cause of neurological symptoms.
• Hypertension may develop as a consequence of renal artery stenosis.
• Myoarthralgias are not uncommon.
• Cardiovascular complications are an important cause of morbidity, and include
aortic insufficiency, congestive heart failure, systemic hypertension, and ostial
involvement of the coronary arteries.

[SECTION]Investigation
• Traditionally, the diagnosis of TA has depended on angiography to
demonstrate the characteristic changes of arterial dilatation, thrombosis, and
aneurysm formation.
• Conventional angiography has the added benefit of allowing a comparison
between central and peripheral blood pressures—important because subclavian
stenosis is a common consequence of this disease and a standard arm cuff
blood pressure reading may underestimate hypertension. Angiography may
also allow for therapeutic intervention, e.g. angioplasty or stenting of the
stenotic vessels.
• Magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) have excellent
resolution at the level of the large vessels. MRI can also demonstrate evidence
of vessel wall inflammation, which could support a diagnosis of TA.
• High-resolution US is sensitive for detecting carotid lesions.
• 18F-FDG PET-CT scanning is useful for identifying the presence of large
vessel vasculitis, but it is not clear whether it can be used to monitor response
to therapy.
Treatment
• Initial medical treatment is with glucocorticoids (GCs) such as prednisolone
40–60 mg per day in an average-sized adult.
• Tapering GC dose is attempted when symptoms and laboratory tests of
inflammation subside. About one-half of all patients have steroid-resistant
disease. In this group, methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine (AZA),
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or leflunomide (LEF) may be tried.
• In severe forms of the disease, or if there is continuing evidence of disease
activity, cyclophosphamide (CYC) may be given.
• Experience with biologics is limited. Anti-TNFα agents or tocilizumab (antiIL6r) may be tried in severe or resistant cases.
• Hypertension can be difficult to manage, and may require angioplasty or
surgery to address renal artery stenosis.
• Surgical management ranges from angioplasty to bypass procedures. These are
best performed during the inactive phase of disease.
• Angioplasty is often a temporizing measure, and lesions tend to restenose over
time. Restenosis is less likely following bypass grafting. Operative mortality is
4%—mostly with aneurysm rupture.
• The prognosis depends mainly on the presence of hypertension and aortic
incompetence. The majority of patients (75%) will have some impairment of
daily living, and 50% are permanently disabled.

[SECTION]• Mortality is low, with 5-year and 10-year survival rates reported as 80% and
90%, respectively.
• TA is not a contraindication to pregnancy. Cytotoxic agents should be stopped
and GCs kept to as low a dose as possible.
• Obstetric decisions can be made on their own merits and not because of
coexistence of TA. The main complications are exacerbation of hypertension
and congestive cardiac failure. The anaesthetist should be made aware of the
diagnosis, as the patient may require invasive blood pressure monitoring
during delivery.

Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis
Polymyalgia rheumatica
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is characterized by pain and stiffness affecting
structures of the shoulder and pelvic girdle areas. Neck pain and stiffness is also
a feature.
Epidemiology
• PMR is rare in patients <50 years old. The mean age of onset is 70 years.
• Prevalence among patients older than 50 years is 1 in 133, and women are
affected more than men (ratio 2:1).
• There is a higher frequency of diagnosis in northern latitudes.
Pathology
• Parainfluenza, parvovirus B19, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Chlamydia
pneumoniae infections have been shown to have a temporal relation to
incidence peaks of PMR, although other studies have found no relationship.
• HLA-DRB1*04 and -DRB*01 predict disease susceptibility.
• PMR and GCA have a close clinical relationship. One-half of patients with
GCA have symptoms of PMR and up to 20% of patients with PMR have
histological or clinical evidence of GCA.
• The pathogenesis of both conditions is not known.
Presentation
• The diagnosis of PMR is based on clinical features. The criteria of Jones and
Hazleman 19811 are succinct and practical (Box 15.2).
• The European League Against Rheumatology (EULAR) and the ACR have
proposed classification criteria to be used as a research tool to identify patients
with PMR.2

[SECTION]• EULAR/ACR criteria include 3 required criteria and 4 points from additional
criteria:
• Required criteria include age ≥50 years, bilateral shoulder aching, and an
abnormal ESR or CRP.
• A scoring algorithm was developed for the additional criteria, which include
morning stiffness ≥45 minutes (2 points); pain or limited range of motion at
hip (1 point); absence of RF or anti-CCP (2 points); absence of peripheral
joint pain (1 point).
• There may be apparent muscle weakness on testing, which is due to pain rather
than intrinsic muscle disease.
• Symptoms may start asymmetrically, but soon become bilateral.
• Systemic features of malaise, weight loss, low-grade fever, and depression are
common.
• Arthralgia and synovitis may occur. Up to 5% of patients with RA (see
Chapter 5) have an initial PMR-like presentation.
Investigation
• The lack of specific clinical features, a specific laboratory test, and the
presence of several conditions that can present with PMR-like symptoms,
makes PMR a diagnosis of exclusion (see Box 15.3).
Box 15.2 Criteria for the diagnosis of PMR
All the following need to be valid/relevant:
1. Shoulder and pelvic girdle pain which is primarily muscular in the
absence of true muscle weakness.
2. Morning stiffness.
3. Duration of at least 2 months (unless treated).
4. ESR >30 mm/hour or CRP >6 mg/dL.
5. Absence of inflammatory arthritis or malignancy.
6. Absence of muscle disease.
7. Prompt and dramatic response to glucocorticoids.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA)
GCA is a granulomatous arteritis of the aorta and larger vessels, including
extracranial branches of the carotid artery. For diagnostic criteria, see Table 15.3.
Epidemiology
• GCA is the most common form of primary systemic vasculitis. In North
America the annual incidence is estimated at 18 per 100,000.
• Like PMR, the female to male ratio is 2:1.
Pathology
• Infectious and genetic associations are also similar to PMR with evidence of
disease ‘clustering’.
• Increasing age and ethnicity are the major risk factors for developing GCA.
GCA is rare among African Americans.
Presentation
• Severe headache and scalp tenderness localized to the occiput or temporal area
are common initial symptoms, and are present in 70% of cases. The critical
feature of the headache is that it is new.
• Headache is often localized to the temples, but may be frontal, occipital, or
generalized.
• The temporal artery can be swollen, tender, and pulseless.
• Jaw claudication is present in about half of the patients. Some patients report
tongue claudication. Jaw claudication is strongly associated with a positive
biopsy.
• Scalp necrosis has also been reported.
• Large arteries are affected in 15% of cases, leading to claudication, bruits,
absent neck and arm pulses, and thoracic aorta aneurysm and dissection.
• Visual disturbance is usually an early finding. Patients may describe symptoms
of amaurosis fugax by temporary ‘curtaining’ of the visual field. Visual loss

[SECTION]•

•

due to retinal ischaemia may be irreversible within hours. A history of prior
transient visual loss is the strongest predictor for subsequent permanent visual
loss.
Diplopia and ptosis may also occur.
Fundoscopy may show optic disc pallor, haemorrhages, and exudates. Optic
atrophy is a late finding.
Arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy is the most common finding, and
must be differentiated from non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, a
cause of visual loss that does not respond to steroids.
Malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever, and anaemia are common.

Investigation
• The ESR and CRP are characteristically elevated, but can be normal in up to
3% of cases.
• Patients suspected of having GCA should be evaluated with bilateral temporal
artery biopsies, taking segments of 1.5 cm each.
• Treatment should not be delayed. Biopsies may be helpful to confirm the
diagnosis up to 2 weeks after steroids are started.
• Unlike most forms of vasculitis, GCA does not cause fibrinoid necrosis and
the presence of fibrinoid necrosis on a temporal artery biopsy should prompt a
search for another form of vasculitis, such as GPA or cryoglobulinaemic
vasculitis.
• Temporal artery biopsies may be negative in 12% of patients. A negative
temporal artery biopsy does not exclude a diagnosis of GCA.
• Data regarding the usefulness of Doppler ultrasound for the diagnosis of GCA
are mixed. Various abnormalities described include stenosis, occlusion and the
presence of a hypoechoic ‘halo’ (halo sign) around the temporal arteries.
• The sensitivity and specificity of the halo sign for the diagnosis of GCA are
69% and 82%, respectively.
• MRA is useful to diagnose GCA, identify regions of temporal artery
involvement, help gauge disease activity, and assess response to treatment.
• 18F-FDG-PET-CT may be useful in showing abnormal metabolic activity in
the aorta of many patients with GCA (see Plate 26). Direct evaluation of the
temporal arteries is not possible using 18F-FDG-PET-CT.

classification of the giant cell arteritis. Arthritis Rheum 1990;33:1122–8.

Treatment of PMR and GCA
• Both conditions require GC treatment; however, the amount and duration of
treatment required are quite different.3,4
• PMR responds dramatically to low–moderate doses of GC (i.e. prednisone 15–
20 mg daily) within 24 hours.
• Some patients respond immediately to prednisolone, and the vast majority of
patients have a substantial improvement within days of starting treatment.
• ACR/EULAR suggest use of the minimum effective dose of prednisolone,
ranging from 12.5–25 mg prednisolone (or equivalent) per day.
• Lower doses of 7.5–10 mg prednisolone may be sufficient in those with mild
symptoms.
• Persistent symptoms despite treatment mandate consideration of an alternate
diagnosis.
• After treatment for 2–4 weeks, the prednisone dose may be decreased by 2.5
mg every 2 weeks until the patient reaches a maintenance dose of 10 mg/day.
Prednisone may subsequently be tapered in 1 mg per month increments.
• GCA requires treatment with high-dose GCs (i.e. prednisone 40–60 mg daily)
and the patient may take a week or longer to experience substantial relief.
• Treatment with GCs should be instituted once a diagnosis of GCA is
suspected, even before it is confirmed.
• After treatment for 1 month, prednisone may be gradually tapered over 9–12
months.
• In patients who have GC-resistant or GC-dependent disease, or develop

[SECTION]•

•

significant adverse effects with treatment, MTX may be added as a steroidsparing drug.
A meta-analysis (of 161 patients) showed that the use of MTX resulted in a
cumulative reduction in the steroid dose over 48 weeks.
Tocilizumab can be effective as GC-sparing, as demonstrated in a small trial of
30 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA.
Small uncontrolled studies have suggested that CYC may also be considered
for this indication.
Patients with visual symptoms associated with GCA should be treated with
intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy (1 g daily for 3 days) prior to
initiating therapy with prednisone.
Daily low-dose (e.g. 75 mg) aspirin may prevent cranial ischaemic events,
such as stroke and blindness, and should be considered if there is no
contraindication.
Osteoporotic fracture protection against GC-induced osteoporosis is essential.
All patients with either GCA or PMR should be commenced at the time of
starting GCs, on either a weekly oral bisphosphonate or IV zoledronic acid,
alongside daily calcium and vitamin D supplements.

Polyarteritis nodosa
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) was the first form of systemic vasculitis described in
the literature. It is characterized by a necrotizing vasculitis of medium-sized
arteries, which can lead to cutaneous ulcers, kidney infarction, GI haemorrhage,
and mononeuritis multiplex.
The CHCC created a distinction between ‘classic’ PAN (i.e. an ANCAnegative, medium vessel vasculitis associated with renal infarcts) and
microscopic PAN (i.e. an ANCA-positive, medium vessel and small vessel
vasculitis characterized by glomerulonephritis). This re-classification (and the
hepatitis B vaccine) has made PAN increasingly uncommon.

[SECTION]Aetiology
• Some cases of PAN have been linked to infection with hepatitis B.
• Patients with PAN should be screened for viral hepatitis, as antiviral therapy
may be needed in addition to immunosuppression.
Presentation and clinical features
• The clinical features are shown in Table 15.4.
• Patients often present with non-specific features of systemic disease including
myalgias, arthralgias, weight loss, and fever.
• About 50% of cases develop a vasculitic rash, which includes purpura,
nodules, livedo reticularis, bullous and vesicular lesions, ulcers, often with
‘punched out’ border in the lower extremities.
• GI involvement occurs in up to 50% of cases. Non-specific abdominal pain,
gut/gallbladder infarction, and pancreatitis are all features.
• Renal involvement occurs in up to 50% of cases in the form of renal infarct
and hypertension. Renal impairment is often mild and present in around 20%
of cases.
• Mononeuritis multiplex occurs in up to 70% of patients.
• Isolated organ involvement is rare, but disease affecting the skin, testes,
epididymis, breasts, uterus, appendix, and gallbladder has been reported.
Treatment
• Treatment and prognosis in all the small vessel and medium vessel vasculitides
ARE discussed at the end of this section.

ANCA-associated vasculitides
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener’s granulomatosis)
• Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is the most prevalent of the AAVs.
Renal-limited vasculitis and drug-induced AAV are less-common members of
this group.
• The CHCC has defined GPA as: ‘necrotizing granulomatous inflammation
usually involving the upper and lower respiratory tract, and necrotizing
vasculitis affecting predominantly small to medium vessels (e.g. capillaries,
venules, arterioles, arteries and veins). Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is
common.’
Epidemiology
• GPA is a worldwide disease with an incidence of 4–9 per million.
• It is slightly more common in men than women.
• It most often appears in the fourth and fifth decades.
Presentation and clinical features
• GPA is often a clinical triad with manifestations affecting the upper respiratory
tract, lower respiratory tract, and kidneys.
• Patients can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations.
• Some patients have an indolent presentation characterized by respiratory tract
involvement, such as sinusitis and pulmonary nodules.
• However, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary haemorrhage
can occur (Box 15.4).
Musculoskeletal symptoms
• Rheumatic symptoms are seen in 60% of cases.
• Symptoms can range from mild myalgias (in 50% of the cases) and arthralgias
to overt arthritis. 20–30% of rheumatic symptoms may be related to a nonerosive and non-deforming polyarthropathy.
• Migratory arthralgias are a classic presentation for GPA.
Box 15.4 American College of Rheumatology 1990 classification criteria
of GPA*
Diagnosis requires two or more of the following:

[SECTION]1. Nasal or oral inflammation: development of painful or painless oral
ulcers or purulent or bloody nasal discharge.
2. Abnormal chest radiograph: the chest radiograph may show nodules,
cavities, or infiltrate.
3. Urinary sediment: microscopic haematuria or red cell casts.
4. Histological changes of granulomatous inflammation on biopsy.
5. PR3-ANCA (C-ANCA) positivity.
* Then known as ‘Wegener’s granulomatosis’.

classification of wegener’s granulomatosis. Arthritis & Rheumatism, 33: 1101–1107 with permission
from Wiley.

Ear, nose, and throat symptoms
• Up to 90% of patients have ear, nose, and throat involvement.
• Chronic sinusitis is a common initial presentation for GPA and typically many
patients will have been treated with several courses of antibiotics before the
correct diagnosis is reached.
• Other manifestations include nasal septal perforation, bloody nasal discharge
(‘crusts’), and nasal bridge collapse due to erosion of underlying cartilage
(‘saddle nose’).
• Patients may also complain of diminished hearing, either due to sensorineural
hearing loss or Eustachian tube dysfunction.
• Subglottic stenosis is a classic feature of GPA and may present with
hoarseness and stridor. Subglottic stenosis may worsen even when a patient is
otherwise in remission, and responds better to steroid injections than systemic
therapy.
• In the oral cavity and oropharynx, inflammation can lead to mucosal ulcers or
gingivitis (‘strawberry gums’).
• It is thought that Staphylococcus aureus has a role in disease pathogenesis.
Nasal carriage in GPA patients is 3× that of the healthy population. The exact
mechanisms leading to disease are unclear, but trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
may benefit patients with GPA by eliminating S. aureus colonization.
Pulmonary disease
• 80% of cases have pulmonary disease.
• The tracheobronchial tree may be locally involved before any signs of
generalized disease.
• Subglottic pseudo-tumours and/or stenosis cause stridor or dyspnoea. Lower
bronchial stenosis may cause atelectasis and obstructive pneumonia. Multiple

[SECTION]nodules with or without cavitation are found in the lungs of asymptomatic
patients.
• Severe pulmonary disease is associated with alveolar capillaritis, haemorrhage
and haemoptysis, with infiltrates on CXR (typically an alveolar or mixed
alveolar–interstitial pattern; the distribution is often like that of pulmonary
oedema and focal infection).
Renal disease
• Up to 90% of patients with ‘severe’ GPA have renal involvement.
• Renal involvement can range from milder focal and segmental
glomerulonephritis to fulminant diffuse necrotizing (rapidly progressive) and
crescentic glomerulonephritis, which can rapidly lead to end-stage renal
disease.
• The milder form of the condition is most common, manifesting in the
asymptomatic patient as a nephritic picture of microscopic haematuria, active
sediment, and mild renal impairment.
Skin disease
• 40% of cases have skin disease.
• Features include palpable purpura due to a leucocytoclastic vasculitis, necrotic
papules (‘Churg–Strauss nodules’), livedo reticularis, and pyoderma
gangrenosum.
Nervous system
• About 30% of patients with GPA have involvement with mononeuritis
multiplex and distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy the main lesions. Seizures
and cerebritis are much less frequent events.
• Disseminated granulomatous lesions (‘pachymeningitis’) can involve the
retropharyngeal area and skull base affecting cranial nerves I, II, III, VI, VII,
and VIII. Pachymeningitis can also be associated with diabetes insipidus and
meningitis.
Eye disease
• Granulomatous lesions may obstruct the nasolacrimal duct and cause orbital
pseudotumour, with optic nerve compression from masses developing in the
retrobulbar space.
• Rarely a purulent sinusitis may spread and cause secondary bacterial orbital
infection.
• Manifestations in the generalized stage of GPA include episcleritis (red eye),
vasculitis of the optic nerve, and occlusion of retinal arteries, in addition to the

[SECTION]granulomatous lesions described earlier.
Investigation
(See Table 4.3, p. 214 for laboratory tests to consider.)
• A biopsy should be done in patients with suspected AAV to confirm the
diagnosis. In some patients, biopsy is not feasible and so a presumptive
diagnosis is made on the clinical features and ANCA.
• Laboratory investigation should include FBC with differential, routine
chemistry, ESR, CRP, and urinalysis to look for active sediment.
• A positive ANCA strongly suggests the diagnosis of vasculitis; however, falsepositive and false-negative results are seen.
• About 82% of patients with GPA have a positive ANCA. This is usually
specific for proteinase-3.
• 10% of GPA cases are ANCA negative. A negative ANCA does not exclude
the diagnosis.
• CXR and HRCT chest should be considered in all cases as the chance of
pulmonary lesions is high despite sometimes few symptoms.
Treatment
• Treatment and prognosis of GPA is discussed later in this sectionwith the other
AAVs.
ANCA-associated vasculitides: microscopic polyangiitis
• MPA is classified as a pulmonary-renal (haemorrhage) syndrome, a group that
also includes Goodpasture’s disease and SLE. GPA may also occasionally
present as a pulmonary-renal syndrome.
• MPA lacks the granulomatous manifestations characteristic of GPA, such as
sinus disease and pulmonary nodules.
• Unlike GPA, MPA is characterized by MPO-ANCA antibodies, which are
associated with a P-ANCA immunofluorescence pattern. Up to 80% of
patients with MPA will be ANCA positive.
• Like PAN, the male to female ratio is 2:1, with the majority of patients being
Caucasian. The mean age of presentation is 50 years.
• Most patients with MPA will present with renal involvement in the form of a
necrotizing glomerulonephritis, similar to what can be seen with GPA. Unlike
most forms of vasculitis, glomerulonephritis from AAV is ‘pauci-immune’ (i.e.
there is only minimal immunoglobulin deposition on immunofluorescence
stains).
• Pulmonary haemorrhage presents as haemoptysis, and can be surprisingly
subtle in some patients. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage will

[SECTION]demonstrate haemosiderin-laden macrophages. Chronic pulmonary capillaritis
may eventually lead to pulmonary fibrosis.
• Other clinical features of the disease are shown in Table 15.4.
ANCA-associated vasculitides: eosinophilic granulomatosis with
polyangiitis (EGPA/formerly Churg–Strauss syndrome)
• EGPA is often described as a clinical triad of adult-onset asthma, eosinophilia,
and vasculitis.
• Typically, the asthma gradually worsens in intensity until the patient requires
daily oral steroids for symptom control. Many of these patients will have been
treated with a leukotriene inhibitor (although leukotriene inhibitors do not
cause the disease).
• Peripheral blood hyper-eosinophilia is typically mild and resolves quickly
upon treatment with oral steroids.
• Other manifestations of hyper-eosinophilia include ‘fleeting’ pulmonary
infiltrates, myocarditis, and interstitial nephritis; frank glomerulonephritis is
much less common in this diagnosis.
• Nerve involvement is a common manifestation of vasculitis among patients
with EGPA, and patients should be examined for evidence of a sensory
neuropathy or mononeuritis multiplex.
• Cutaneous granulomata that form along the elbows and fingers are called
‘Churg–Strauss nodules’. Ironically, they appear more commonly in
association with GPA.
• Cardiac involvement is one of the more serious manifestations of EGPA,
accounting for approximately half of all deaths in patients with EGPA. Clinical
manifestations include arrhythmias, pericarditis, and heart failure.
• Treatment and prognosis in all the small vessel and medium vessel vasculitides
are discussed at the end of this section.
The treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitides
• Assessment of disease activity in GPA or MPA is usually done using the
BVAS.
• BVAS ranges from 0 to 68; with a score of 0 indicating remission.
• AAV are managed with treatment aiming to provide remission induction and
then remission maintenance.
• Current treatment choices are based on classifying patients as having ‘severe
generalized disease or poor prognosis’ versus ‘localized, early systemic
disease or good prognosis’.
• Initial immunosuppressive therapy consists of GCs in combination with either

[SECTION]CYC or rituximab (RTX). MTX with GCs can be used in patients with mild
extrarenal disease.
• In a select group, those who present with severe disease, plasma exchange may
be tried.
Severe generalized GPA and MPA
• The National Institutes of Health regimen consisted of 1 year of oral CYC (2
mg/kg daily) with prednisolone (1 mg/kg daily tapered over 6–12 months).
This has been modified in the last decade to minimize exposure to CYC and
GCs.
• The induction phase consists of 3–6 months of CYC, followed by either AZA
(CYCAZAREM trial)5 or MTX (WEGENT trial)6 to maintain remission.
• MMF was found to be inferior compared to AZA in a randomized trial
(IMPROVE trial).7
• IVIg leflunomide and calcineurin inhibitors have been used in a small number
of patients, but data to access their efficacy is insufficient.
• Etanercept was found to be ineffective in maintaining remission in a placebocontrolled trial (WGET trial).8
• The optimal length of maintenance therapy is unclear but continuation for 12–
18 months after remission is reasonable as the majority of patients flare after
therapy is discontinued.
• The CYCLOPS trial compared daily oral to IV pulse CYC.9 Both regimens
resulted in similar rates of remission. Extended follow-up for a duration of 4.3
years showed comparable survival rates of about 80%, and similar side effect
profile. However, relapses were more common with pulse therapy.
• RTX has demonstrated efficacy and short-term safety comparable to CYC and
AZA.
• In the RAVE trial, 64% of patients who received RTX for 6 months
discontinued prednisolone compared to 53% who had CYC.10 RTX was more
efficacious compared with CYC in those who had relapsing disease at
baseline.
• At 12 months, 42% of patients in the RTX arm remained in remission
compared with 38% in the CYC arm.
• In the RITUXIVAS trial, about 90% of patients attained remission in both the
RTX and CYC arms, and 90% and 85% respectively remained relapse free at
12 months.11
• RTX may be preferable to CYC for induction of remission in patients with
concerns about fertility or those with a high risk of malignancy.

[SECTION]Localized and early generalized GPA and MPA
• Disease may respond to a combination of MTX and prednisolone. In the
NORAM trial,12 which compared MTX with CYC, remission at 6 months was
achieved in about 90% of patients in both treatment arms. But relapses after
drug discontinuation were significantly higher in those given MTX.
• Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may decrease the risk of relapse in patients
with localized disease.
Other treatments
• Plasma exchange has been used with some effect in those with severe renal
disease, although the benefit is transient.
• IVIg has a short-lived benefit, but may be used in patients at high risk of
systemic infection.
• Treatment of a vasculitis associated with an infectious disease (e.g. hepatitis
B-associated PAN, hepatitis C-associated cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis) should
include treatment of the pathogen.
• There is evidence that respiratory tract infections may trigger a relapse of
GPA. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in patients with stable disease on
maintenance therapy may decrease respiratory infection, and is also useful for
prevention of pneumocystis among patients treated with CYC.
EGPA
• Patients without poor prognostic factors (FFS = 0) achieve remission with GCs
alone in >90% of cases. Although about a third may relapse, the long-term
prognosis is excellent.
• In patients with poor prognostic factors (FFS ≥1) IV CYC pulses are effective.
Flares are frequent on CYC discontinuation. Extrapolating results from
GPA/MPA trials, AZA may be used for maintaining remission.
• Successful treatment with RTX has been described in case series and case
reports.
• Mepolizumab, an anti-IL5 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated
encouraging results in pilot trials.
Prognosis of ANCA-associated vasculitides
• Prior to the introduction of CYC and GCs, mortality associated with AAV
approached 100%. Modern immunosuppressive regimens have transformed
these diseases into chronic conditions, characterized by cycles of relapse and
remission.
• For many patients, the consequences of treatment (such as GC-associated

[SECTION]complications) may lead to greater morbidity than the underlying disease
itself.
• Mortality due to infection continues to be an important consideration for
patients treated for AAV; indeed, patients with ‘treatment-resistant’ AAV
should be carefully evaluated for the presence of Nocardia, Aspergillus, and
other infections that can mimic some of the manifestations of the AAV.

Small vessel vasculitis
The definition of small vessel vasculitis is open to different interpretations.
Small vessel disease can be one feature of GPA, MPA, and EGPA. However,
there are a range of clinical and pathological features that define a specific group
of small vessel vasculitides outlined in Table 15.5. See also Table 4.3, p. 214
for advice on laboratory investigation.
Leucocytoclastic vasculitis
• Histologically, leucocytoclastic vasculitis appears as a neutrophil infiltration in
and around small vessels, with fragmentation of the neutrophils
(leucocytoclasis), fibrin deposition, and endothelial cell necrosis. Immune
complex deposition appears to be important in pathogenesis.
• Small vessel vasculitis usually presents in the skin, although the
microvasculature of any tissue may be affected.
• Some forms of cutaneous vasculitis are predominantly lymphocytic, without

[SECTION]evidence of neutrophils or leucocytoclasis. However, the division into
leucocytoclastic and non-leucocytoclastic (lymphocytic) vasculitis is not
absolute. Likewise, the clinical presentation of cutaneous vasculitis can vary
considerably.
• The finding of leucocytoclasis should prompt a thorough review of drug
treatment (e.g. sulfonamides, penicillin, thiazides), a search for infection
(hepatitis B, HIV, β-haemolytic streptococcus), a screen for autoimmune
rheumatic disease, malignancy (in particular myelo- and lymphoproliferative
diseases), inflammatory bowel disease, chronic active hepatitis, and
cryoglobulinaemia (see later).
Allergic (hypersensitivity) vasculitis
(See also Table 4.2, p. 212.)
• Allergic vasculitis is the most common pattern of presentation in adults, both
sexes being affected equally.
• Non-blanching haemorrhagic papules (palpable purpura), purpuric macules,
plaques, pustules, bullae, and ulcers may occur, classically distributed
maximally over the lower leg.
• A low-grade fever, arthralgias, and microscopic haematuria may accompany
such presentation.
• Often the condition is self-limiting and identifiable causes should be managed
as appropriate. Analgesia may be needed and systemic steroids may be
required for acute organ disease, especially progressive renal impairment.
• AZA may be appropriate for refractory disease but removal of the offending
drug or exposure is the most effective treatment strategy.

Henöch–Schönlein purpura (HSP; IgA vasculitis)
• HSP occurs most often in children (see ‘Childhood-onset vasculitides’, pp.
474–481), but can affect adults of any age. IgA is usually detected in skin, gut,
or renal biopsies.
• The classic presentation is with purpura, and in adults: arthritis (50%),
haemorrhagic GI disease (40%), and glomerulonephritis (50%).
• GCs given early may relieve joint and GI symptoms, but there is little
evidence that they prevent progression of renal disease or influence overall
outcome.
• If renal function is rapidly deteriorating, pulsed methylprednisolone and/or
plasmapheresis may be of benefit.
• Patients who present with a nephritic or nephrotic syndrome have an increased
lifetime prevalence of renal complications, including hypertension.
• Although most cases are self-limited, HSP can (rarely) become a chronic,
relapsing disease. Such patients should be evaluated for the presence of a
monoclonal IgA antibody, which may herald a pre-malignant lesion.
Urticarial vasculitis
• Urticarial lesions with arthralgias are the most common features of this
condition, with men outnumbering women by 2:1. The typical age of onset is
40–50 years.
• Morphologically, the skin lesions resemble ordinary urticaria and sometimes
may be mistaken for erythema multiforme.
• Unlike ordinary urticaria, urticarial vasculitis tends to last for days (not hours)
and tend to be burning and painful (not pruritic).
• Patients with hypocomplementaemic urticarial vasculitis tend to develop more
systemic features such as renal, GI, and pulmonary disease. Less common
manifestations include lymphadenopathy, uveitis, and benign intracranial
hypertension.
• Systemic antihistamines are widely used, but their effects tend to be
disappointing.
• There are anecdotal reports of success with indometacin, hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ), colchicine, ciclosporin, and dapsone. AZA may be particularly

[SECTION]effective.
• For the majority of patients, the condition is chronic and benign. For those
with end-organ damage, chronic immunosuppression may be necessary.
Cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis
• Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate when cold. They are
divided into three types: type I (monoclonal), type II (mixed monoclonal and
polyclonal), and type III (polyclonal).
• Mixed cryoglobulins are associated with autoimmune rheumatic diseases,
infection, and lymphoproliferative disorders. Hepatitis B and C viral infection
should always be excluded; the latter in particular is strongly associated with
mixed essential cryoglobulinaemia.
• Mixed essential cryoglobulinaemia presents with purpuric skin lesions
showing a leucocytoclastic vasculitis on biopsy; polyarthralgias (70%),
weakness, progressive renal disease (55%), and transaminitis (70%) are
common.
• Women are affected twice as frequently as men.
• Less common problems include oedema, hypertension, leg ulcers, Raynaud’s
disease, abdominal pain, neuropathy, and susceptibility to bacterial
pneumonia.
• The prognosis is worse with renal disease.
• The main causes of death among patients with cryoglobulinaemia include
renal failure and infection.
• Treatment requires management of the underlying cause; immunosuppression
by itself is frequently unsatisfactory.
• Choice of immunosuppression should be dictated by the disease
manifestations; the most severe forms may require treatment with CYC, pulse
steroids, and plasmapheresis.
Hypergammaglobulinaemic purpura
• This is a rare, benign IgM condition presenting as long-standing
leucocytoclastic purpura similar to the cutaneous features of Sjögren’s
syndrome (see Chapter 12).
• It should not be confused with Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, a
monoclonal IgM paraproteinaemia associated with lymphoma.
Erythema elevatum diutinum and granuloma faciale
• These are rare distinctive forms of chronic localized leucocytoclastic
vasculitis. There are no systemic effects and the aetiology is unknown.
• Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is characterized by slowly enlarging

[SECTION]oedematous purplish-brown plaques or blisters over the backs of the hands,
elbows, or knees. They heal very slowly (months to years) with fibrosis. It
may respond to dapsone.
• Granuloma faciale (GF) presents as single or multiple pink-brown, welldefined, smooth papules and plaques on the face. They persist for years. It is
distinguished histologically from EED by the presence of eosinophils and a
normal collagen beneath the epidermis. It may respond to intralesional
steroids.
Non-leucocytoclastic (lymphocytic) vasculitides
• The differential diagnosis of nodular forms of cutaneous vasculitis embraces a
wide range of disorders, including the panniculitides (see Chapter 18 and
Chapter 4, p. 206).
• Nodular vasculitis is regarded as a distinct group characterized by recurrent
subcutaneous nodules. Patients are otherwise healthy though it may be
associated with streptococcal infection.
• Bazin’s disease is sometimes used to describe the nodular vasculitis that
occurs in tuberculosis. The condition resolves spontaneously, but may take
many years. Intralesional triamcinolone may help.
• Livedoid vasculitis is characterized histologically by endothelial cell
proliferation and intraluminal thrombosis leading to ischaemia.
• Livedoid vasculitis has been attributed to defects in the tissue plasminogen
activator (tPA) gene, although similar lesions can be seen in the
antiphospholipid syndrome. The lesions heal with white atrophic scar
(‘atrophie blanche’).
• Pityriasis lichenoides is an uncommon disorder of pink papules, which enlarge
rapidly and may become haemorrhagic before becoming necrotic and heal
with scarring. It is usually self-limiting and may respond to ultraviolet B
irradiation.

Childhood-onset vasculitides
• The primary vasculitides in children are rare but life-threatening conditions.
The commonest are Kawasaki disease (KD) and the acute usually self-limiting
Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP).
• Suspicion of the chronic vasculitides (Table 15.6) arises in the presence of
fever (often low grade), weight loss, rash, and multisystem clinical features.
• As in adults, perivascular inflammation occurs and the site and size of affected
vessels influences the spectrum of presentation.

[SECTION]• A history should be taken of infection, immunizations, family history and drug
exposure.
• The first paediatric specific classification of vasculitis by EULAR and the
Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES) was developed in 2005 and
validated in 2010.

Epidemiology of childhood vasculitis
The incidence and prevalence of childhood-onset vasculitides are not accurately
described and vary depending on the population studied.
• The prevalence of HSP is 3–20 per 100,000 of the general population, and of
KD is 9–32 per 100,000 of the population in the USA and 134 per 100,000 of
the population in Japan.
• The other childhood-onset vasculitides occur in 1–10 per million of the
population.

[SECTION]Kawasaki disease
• KD is the leading cause of childhood acquired heart disease in developed
countries and includes coronary artery aneurysms (in 15–25% of untreated
cases) which often appear late.
• Pericarditis, myocarditis, and myocardial infarction may occur.
• With rapid detection and IVIg treatment, aneurysms occur in less than 5–10%
of patients and mortality is reduced from 3–4% to <1%.
• The burden of adult cardiovascular disease and premature atherosclerosis is
the subject of ongoing research.
Epidemiology and pathogenesis
• The annual UK incidence of KD is 5–8 per 100,000 of the population, with a
peak incidence in children aged 1–2 years (0–5 years typically), differing to
Japan with a peak at 6–12 months of age.
• 5–10% of KD cases occur in children aged 5–10 years.
• The aetiology is unknown. Pronounced seasonality and clustering suggests an
infectious or environmental trigger in genetically susceptible individuals.
• Recent epidemics have been linked to large-scale tropospheric wind currents
originating in central Asia.
Presentation
• Diagnostic criteria require a high spiking fever (usually ≥40°C) for ≥5 days;
plus ≥4 of the following (all criteria are not required at one time):
• Widespread polymorphic erythematous rash.
• Bilateral conjunctival injection or congestion.
• Reddening of the palms and soles, indurative oedema, and subsequent
desquamation (Beau lines are seen in retrospect).
• Reddening/cracking of lips, strawberry tongue, oral and pharyngeal
injection.
• Acute, usually single (>1.5 cm), non-purulent cervical lymphadenopathy.
• Fever may occur abruptly but there is a prodrome including coryza, abdominal
pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, and arthralgia.
• Irritability is considered universal.
• KD is also diagnosed when there are <5 features with coronary aneurysm or
dilatation or in an infant with pronounced irritability.
• Incomplete KD is diagnosed in patients with a fever and fewer than 4
additional features so that they receive IVIg before 10 days from fever onset.
This is most common in infants.
• Atypical KD is diagnosed in children older than 9 years, younger than 6

[SECTION]months, and when there are additional inflammatory features.
• Other features include induration or redness at the BCG inoculation site;
arthritis, uveitis, aseptic meningitis, pneumonitis, intestinal obstruction,
hydrops of the gallbladder and jaundice, encephalopathy, macrophage
activation syndrome, and SIADH.
• Persisting additional features should raise the possibility of alternative
diagnoses. Coronary ectasia can occur in other conditions including systemic
onset JIA, TA, and PAN.
Investigations
• Echocardiography should be done at diagnosis, 2 weeks, and 6–8 weeks after
disease onset to detect myocardial inflammation and coronary aneurysmal
formation.
• ECG will show conduction defects.
• There are no diagnostic blood tests but marked thrombocytosis may alert
clinicians to KD.
• Viral serology (IgG and IgM) for mycoplasma pneumonia, enterovirus,
adenovirus, measles, parvovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus can
be positive.
Treatment
The reduction in risk of long-term cardiac disease is best achieved with IVIg and
aspirin started within 10 days of onset of fever.
• IVIg reduces the risk of coronary artery aneurysm formation from about 20%
to 6%.
• IVIg (2 g/kg) is administered over 10–12 hours, except in infants with cardiac
failure when the dose is split over 2–4 days.
• If the fever recurs or persists 36 hours after initial IVIg, a second dose is
given.
• Although the evidence supports early use of IVIg, it may be given after 10
days of illness.
• Aspirin is initially given at a dose of 80–100 mg/kg/day, and reduced to 2–5
mg/kg/day when the fever has settled (low dose).
• Low-dose aspirin can be continued for a minimum of 6 weeks. It is then
stopped if echocardiography is normal or when aneurysms have returned to
normal.
• However, there is debate over the use of aspirin as RCT data are not available,
and the positive considerations of its use must be balanced against the risk of
Reye syndrome.

[SECTION]• Clopidogrel or dipyridamole may be temporarily substituted for aspirin in
patients who develop influenza or varicella. Warfarin is substituted in the
presence of giant aneurysms (>8 mm).
• Fever that recurs after two doses of IVIg is termed IVIg resistance and occurs
in 10–20% of cases. It is associated with an increased risk of aneurysm.
• IVIg resistance is often treated with IV methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg
(maximum 1 g) for 1–3 days followed by oral prednisolone (1–2 mg/kg daily)
then with gradual dose reduction.
• Alternatively, infliximab (5 mg/kg) is associated with fewer days of fever and
hospitalization compared to a second dose of IVIg, but a reduced rate
aneurysm formation has not yet been defined.
Henoch–Schönlein purpura
• HSP is the most common systemic vasculitis in childhood.
• HSP is a small vessel, non-granulomatous IgA leucocytoclastic vasculitis of
unknown aetiology.
• HSP is generally a benign, self-limiting disease with most patients
experiencing a full resolution within 8 weeks (<5% of patients develop chronic
symptoms).
• One-third of children have symptoms for up to a fortnight, and another third
for up to a 1 month.
• Recurrent disease occurs in 50% within 6 weeks.
• HSP nephritis accounts for up to 3% of all childhood cases of end-stage renal
failure (ESRF) in the UK.
Epidemiology
• UK incidence is 20 per 100,000 of the general population per year
(0.8/100,000 in adults).
• 75% occurs at the age of 2–11 years, and is rare in infancy.
• HSP is most prevalent during the winter and spring, and associations have
been considered with infectious disease such as group A streptococci,
hepatitis, CMV, HSV, human parvovirus B19, coxsackievirus, adenovirus, and
some vaccinations.
Presentation and clinical features
• HSP has a characteristic purpuric rash (in 95% at presentation) affecting backs
of the legs, buttocks, and arms, and in children needs to be distinguished from
meningococcal septicaemia, acute haemorrhagic oedema of infancy, immune
thrombocytopenic purpura, acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis,
haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.

[SECTION]• Purpura rarely involves trunk or face. Urticaria, angio-oedema, deep bruising,
or necrotic appearances may also occur.
• Abdominal pain may precede the rash by 2 weeks and may be associated with
vomiting, haematemesis, and melena.
• GI complications are rare but include intussusception, appendicitis,
cholecystitis, pancreatitis, ulceration, infarction, and perforation.
• Arthralgia or arthritis (47% of cases), typically of the knees and ankles, tends
to be self-limiting.
• Nephritis affects 25–60% of patients.
• However, <5% of cases progress to CKD, and only 1–2% to ESRF (20% of
children with renal disease and over 10–25 years).
• Renal prognosis is best in children <7 years.
• Renal disease occurs in 97% of children within 3 months of disease onset but
generally <10% of patients require renal biopsy (usually for persisting
haematuria and nephropathy).
• Rare manifestations include orchitis, pulmonary haemorrhage, and cerebral
vasculitis.
Treatment and monitoring
• No treatment has been shown to shorten the duration of HSP or significantly
improve long-term renal outcome.
• Treatment is primarily symptomatic (rest, analgesia, and hydration).
• Admission can be helpful where there is severe abdominal pain, GI
haemorrhage and renal failure and occasionally for arthritis.
• Glucocorticoids (GCs) are used for symptomatic improvement and severe
facial or scrotal oedema. Prednisolone dose is adjusted according to response
and typically started at 1 mg/kg/day orally for 5 days. If higher doses or
methylprednisolone are used, tertiary centre input is recommended.
• GCs are also used for persisting renal disease and where there are >50%
crescentic glomerular involvement on renal biopsy.
• Severe renal involvement may require GC-sparing immunosuppression,
antiproteinuric, and antihypertensive agents.
• Monitoring of the condition should be weekly for the first month, alternate
weeks for 1 month and then monthly—the frequency increasing with renal
involvement.
• Monthly urinalysis screening is recommended up to 6 months.
Leucocytoclastic vasculitis
Leucocytoclastic vasculitis is a common small vessel vasculitis in children and

[SECTION]presents as palpable purpura often with urticaria, vesicles, bullae, or pustules,
but not itch, pain, or burning.
Presentation and clinical features
• Internal involvement may include joints, GI system, and renal system.
• About 50% of cases may be idiopathic, 10–15% secondary to autoimmune
disease (e.g. RA, SLE, IBD), about 5% are associated with malignancy and
other cases attributed to medications or herbal remedies, food additives, or
primarily underlying infection.
• ~10% of patients have chronic or recurrent disease.
• Erythema elevatum diutinum and granuloma faciale are rare distinctive forms
of disease (with pink/purple-brown well-defined lesions).
Investigations
(See also Table 4.2, p. 212 and Table 4.3, p. 214.)
• Investigations are for underlying infections (group A streptococci, viral
hepatitis, and HIV), autoimmunity or malignancy.
• Measure total haemolytic complement (CH50 or CH100), C3, C4, anti-C1q
antibodies if urticarial vasculitis is being considered and cryoglobulins if there
is a suggestion of previous hepatitis C.
• Consider a skin biopsy if there is multisystem involvement and appearances
are not typical of HSP.
Treatment
• Treat underlying conditions and withdraw suspicious medications
• Treatment of primary disease includes GCs, colchicine, HCQ, dapsone, AZA,
or MTX.
• RTX has been shown to be more effective than CYC for those with systemic
involvement.
Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa
Cutaneous PAN is a paediatric condition that runs a benign course, over months
to years, distinct from systemic polyarteritis nodosa.
Presentation and clinical features
• Arthralgias, myalgias, and neuralgia may occur, but there is invariably no
internal organ damage.
• Distinct from a leucocytoclastic vasculitis, cutaneous PAN results in larger
inflammatory plaques, tender lumps and erythema nodosum (or other forms of
panniculitis), ulceration.

[SECTION]• Infarcts attributable to medium vessel and pan-arteritis involvement. Postinflammatory pigmentation may occur.
• Triggers include Streptococcus A, hepatitis B and C, HIV, and parvovirus B19.
Investigations
• Skin biopsy should confirm the diagnosis. See also

Table 4.3, pp. 213–214.

Treatment
• Prednisolone is considered the mainstay of treatment, although there are no
RCTs for glucocorticoids, colchicine, IVIg, or MTX.
• Penicillin is given for Strep A infection.
• Symptomatic treatment is often required for pain and ulcers.
(Systemic) Polyarteritis nodosa
• PAN is the third most common vasculitis in children and adolescents.
• Childhood PAN is now more common than PAN in adults since the
introduction of hepatitis B vaccine.
• PAN has an incidence of 3–7 per 100,000 per year.
• PAN characterized by a necrotizing vasculitis of medium-sized arteries,
aneurysmal formation, thrombi, ischaemia, and infarction. It spares the
smallest vessels and venules.
Presentation and clinical features
• PAN should be considered in patients with malaise, fever, weight loss (>5%),
myalgia, arthropathy, and:
• vasculitic rash (especially on the legs, palms, or soles).
• mono/poly neuropathy (pure sensory or motor or mixed).
• testicular tenderness or pain.
• muscle tenderness or focal weakness.
• PAN is usually idiopathic, but may be secondary to viral hepatitis.
• Permanent morbidity is relatively rare but relapses occur in 35–50% over a
mean of 6 years.
• Mortality is 4% over 5 years improved from 87% without treatment.
• Complications can include:
• ulcerations and gangrene.
• stroke, encephalopathy, myelopathy, and neuropathy.
• pericarditis, coronary aneurysms, MI, and heart failure.
• GI bleeding and infarction.
• renal failure.
• However, lungs are rarely affected.

[SECTION]Investigations
• Routine haematology, ESR, CRP, liver and renal biochemistry, CK, and
hepatitis serology should be checked. See also Table 4.3, p. 214.
• Conventional renal and mesenteric angiography shows aneurysms and
stenoses (not generally shown by CT or MRI angiography).
• Consider EMG, sural nerve, and muscle (e.g. vastus lateralis) biopsy.
• Biopsy of nodules and deep dermal ulcer margins may be helpful; however,
renal biopsy is unhelpful and often associated with postoperative bleeding and
fistulae.
• Other features include hypertension, retinal vasculitis, unexplained
tachycardia, psychiatric symptoms, polymyositis, livedo reticularis, and
Raynaud’s disease.
Treatment and prognosis
• Active or latent hepatitis B may require concurrent antiviral therapy (e.g.
lamivudine) in addition to immunosuppression.
• GC therapy should be combined with either MMF, MTX, or AZA.
• CYC is used for serious organ involvement or steroid-refractory disease.
• The role of plasmapheresis remains to be determined.
• Prognostic scoring, using the FFS may be useful (FFS =1 has a mortality of
25%; FFS = 2 has a mortality of 45%; etc.). The five factors—each scoring
one—are.
• Renal failure.
• Proteinuria (>1 g/dL).
• GI bleed or perforation or infarction or pancreatitis.
• Cardiomyopathy.
• CNS involvement (<10%).
Primary angiitis of central nervous system in children (cPACNS)
• CNS vasculitis is increasingly recognized in children but presents a diagnostic
challenge. A lack of consensus on disease classification has made it difficult to
establish the true incidence of the disease.
• Brainworks (
http//www.sickkids.ca/research/brainworks/) is helping to
better clarify this condition and provides support when there is diagnostic
uncertainty.
• Secondary CNS vasculitis occurs in a broad set of systemic conditions,
including neurosarcoidosis, which is a differential diagnosis.
Presentation and clinical features
• Clinical presentation is typically with non-focal symptoms including

[SECTION]•
•
•
•

headaches and altered mental state (in 50% of cases).
Alternatively, children present with localizing symptoms include lateralized
weakness (30%), aphasia, ataxia, visual symptoms, and seizures (each ~15%).
The spinal cord is involved in 5–15% of cases.
Systemic features are rare.
Mimics of CNS vasculitis should be considered, and include:
• Moyamoya disease.
• Thrombophilic conditions (e.g. antiphospholipid syndrome).
• Neurological conditions (e.g. multiple sclerosis, Devic’s disease).
• Metabolic conditions.
• Sarcoidosis.
• Malignancy.

Investigations
• Diagnostic criteria13 require:
• An acquired neurological deficit.
• Angiographic and/or histopathological features of CNS angiitis.
• Absence of a systemic condition.
• Catheter arteriography is the gold standard diagnostic test due to an ability to
detect distal lesions affecting smaller vessels and identify lesions in the
posterior part of the brain.
• MRI of brain and/or spine and MRA may demonstrate acute ischaemia of
varying patterns dependent on size of vessel involve and use of diffusionweighted imaging (for large vessel disease).
• Meningeal enhancement may be seen with MRA which can reveal beading,
tortuosity, stenosis, and occlusion of the vessels.
• Brain biopsy should be considered for difficult cases when arteriography is
negative or in cases with a poor response to therapy.
Treatment and prognosis
• Current therapeutic recommendations are similar to those for systemic
vasculitis:
• Induction with IV CYC, GCs and low-dose aspirin.
• 1–2-year maintenance therapy with MMF or AZA, simultaneously reducing
the dose of prednisolone but continuing aspirin.
• Full anticoagulation may need to be considered.
• A poor prognosis is suggested by presentation with neurocognitive
dysfunction, seizures, multifocal parenchymal lesions on MRI, or distal
stenosis on arteriography.

[SECTION]ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAVs)
• Using internationally recognized diagnostic criteria and algorithms, 80% of
paediatric AAV patients are GPA, 15% are MPA, and 5% are EGPA. Cases of
renal-limited vasculitis (crescentic glomerulonephritis) are also included.
• The Paediatric Vasculitis Activity Score, PVAS (modified from BVAS), has
been validated for objective assessment of childhood vasculitis.
• Of all AAV childhood cases, 55% are cANCA positive (almost consistently
PR3 positive), 30% are pANCA positive (90% MPO positive), and 3% are
mixed cytoplasmic and perinuclear.
• Median age at diagnosis is 14 years with a relatively high burden of disease
(median PVAS of 19).
• Time from symptom onset to diagnosis is now quick, averaging 2.5 months,
but rates of organ damage at this time are still high.
• 80% of patients have pulmonary or renal disease; 60% have both.
• Pulmonary presentations include alveolar haemorrhage and massive
haemoptysis.
• 10–20% of cases present in renal failure which requires dialysis and 5% have
end-stage renal disease.
• ENT involvement occurs in 60% and MSK in 50%.
• CYC and GCs have been used most commonly to induce disease remission but
in keeping with practice with adult cases, RTX is increasingly used.
• The choice of maintenance therapy after induction of remission includes
MTX, AZA, and MMF.
• Plasmapheresis is usually for pulmonary-renal syndrome and alveolar
haemorrhage.
• Low-dose aspirin is used to decrease thrombosis risk.
• Co-trimoxazole use for nasal Staphylococcus carriage is controversial.
• High levels of organ damage still occur. In one large study of GPA in children,
40% had chronic renal impairment at 3 years of disease duration.

Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis can be defined as a decrease in bone mass and strength resulting in
an increased risk of fracture with minimal or no trauma (‘fragility fracture’).
• Osteoporosis can be defined using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to derive
an estimate of bone mineral density (BMD).
• The clinical consequence of osteoporosis is fragility fracture and its
consequences, which include pain, skeletal deformity, functional loss
(including loss of mobility and independence in the elderly), and reduced life
expectancy (e.g. hip fracture in the elderly).
• The risk of osteoporotic fracture is greater in women than in men and varies
with site (Table 16.1).

Pathogenesis and classification
• During childhood and adolescence, growth and skeletal modelling lead to an
increase in the size, shape, strength, and composition of bone. Growth ceases
with the closure of the growth plates (epiphyseal cartilage). However,
remodelling and mineral homeostasis continue throughout life with bone
resorption and deposition coupled by the interaction between osteoclasts and
osteoblasts, respectively.
• Peak bone mass/BMD or maximal bone density is usually achieved in the third
decade. Peak bone mass is determined by both genetic and environmental
factors.
• After about the age of 35 years, the amount of bone produced is less than that
resorbed during each remodelling cycle. The net effect is an age-related
decrease in bone mass. Trabecular and cortical BMD decline by ~6% and 3%
respectively per decade.
• Accelerated bone loss occurs at the time of menopause with declining ovarian
function and circulating oestrogen. Up to 15% of bone mass can be lost over
the 5-year period immediately after menopause. The andropause (decreased
circulating bioavailable testosterone, so decreased aromatization to oestrogen)
occurs for many men over many years through late-middle and advanced age.
There is a moderate correlation between serum testosterone and BMD.
• The mechanism of age-related bone loss is multifactorial and is a consequence
of genetic, environmental, and comorbid influences:
• decreased intestinal calcium absorption.
• decreased synthesis of vitamin D.
• hyperparathyroidism (caused by the above).
• factors increasing osteoclast function (e.g. oestrogen lack).
• reduced osteoblast development (e.g. ageing-related stem cell fate—away
from osteoblast in favour of adipocyte).
• increasing immobility reducing the physical stress on bone leading to

[SECTION]activation of bone resorption.
• Risk factors for osteoporosis (see also Table 16.2) include:
• race (Caucasian or Asian > Afro Caribbean).
• increasing age and female gender.
• positive family history (especially parental hip fracture).
• previous ‘fragility’ fracture.
• drugs (e.g. glucocorticoid (GC) therapy).
• chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g. RA, Crohn’s disease, AS)
• malabsorption (e.g. coeliac disease)
• endocrinopathies (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome)
• low body mass index (BMI <18).
• short fertile period (late menarche, early menopause).
• diseases of bone marrow (e.g. mastocytosis, Gaucher disease)
• immobility, sedentary lifestyle.
• low intake of calcium (<240 mg daily).
• excessive alcohol intake.
• smoking.
• The World Health Organization has developed a Fracture Assessment Tool
(FRAX;
htpp://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX) to identify patients at risk of
fragility fracture. BMD measurement is incorporated into FRAX. Assessing
BMD alone to predict fragility fracture may lead to an incomplete fragility
fracture risk profile. FRAX takes account of many of the major BMDindependent fragility fracture risk factors (with the exception of falls risk) and
allows a calculation of a 10-year risk of fragility fracture:
• age, low BMI, and gender.
• prior fragility fracture.
• GC use.
• parental history of hip fracture.
• rheumatoid arthritis.
• secondary osteoporosis (selected causes).
• current smoker and daily alcohol >3 units.

Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis
• Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IJO) is uncommon. It occurs before or at
onset of puberty. It affects the sexes equally. The cause is unknown and there
are no consistent biochemical abnormalities.
• IJO should be discriminated from osteogenesis imperfecta (OI; see Chapter
19) and osteoporosis from secondary causes (e.g. see Table 16.2).
• The child presents with pain, non-traumatic fractures around the weightbearing joints, and collapsed vertebrae. No specific treatment is available and
for most, bone mass increases to normal values as puberty progresses;
however, in some cases fractures may lead to deformity. Supportive physical

[SECTION]therapy should be made available.
• Children with IJO and all forms of osteoporosis have low BMD for their age
and skeletal development. It is essential that DXA scan-derived BMD data are
adjusted for skeletal growth if growth deviates from average velocity
significantly
(see
ISCD
position
statements
online:
https://www.iscd.org/official-positions/) using skeletal growth adjustment
algorithms (for UK data, using bone mineral apparent density (BMAD)).
Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO)
• GIO is a common and (as published audits continually suggest) a poorly
managed condition.
• Numerous guidelines for managing GIO risk exist (e.g. ACR, EULAR,
American Society of Bone Mineral Research (USA), National Osteoporosis
Foundation (USA), National Osteoporosis Society (UK))
• The effects of GIO are greatest in the older patient given the additional
osteoporosis risk factors and comorbidities likely.
• The effect of GCs on the skeleton is most profound with early GC treatment,
so preventive osteoporosis strategies need considering at the beginning of GC
use, particularly in the elderly.
• Any vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism requires
correcting at the outset of any GC treatment.
• GP patient databases suggest patients on long-term inhaled GCs may be at
increased of osteoporosis defined by DXA, but there is no overall evidence
that there is an increased risk of fracture compared to control patients with
underlying lung diseases.
• The pathogenesis of GIO is complex. There are direct effects of GCs on bone
cells and indirect effects through an influence of metabolic and endocrine
factors though convincing data in humans for all these effects being systematic
are lacking (Table 16.3).
• A bisphosphonate should be recommended, to patients ≥65 years and 50–65
years old with multiple risk factors for osteoporosis, who will take GCs ≥3
months and should be started simultaneously with the GCs.
• For younger patients FRAX ( http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX) is useful to
predict major fragility fracture risk or very low risk in patients before starting
GCs. FRAX can be used without DXA scan data and can be adjusted
depending on GC dose.

Clinical features
• Osteoporosis frequently presents with low-trauma fracture.
• Other presentations include back pain (vertebral fracture due to osteoporosis),
loss of height evident in the spine by ‘xmas-tree’ folds of skin of the back or
the lower rib cage margin approximating to the iliac crests, thoracic spine
kyphosis (multiple vertebral fractures can cause this though this is not the
commonest cause for kyphosis).
• Features of the cause of osteoporosis may be obvious or not. For example,
immobility due to spinal cord injury and paraplegia (potent cause of bone loss)
but hypogonadism in men, though detectable to an experienced clinician, may
be subtle and relatively ‘invisible’.
• Obvious and/or important clinical features that might be detected to indicate
conditions highly associated with osteoporosis include stigmata for chronic
alcohol excess, hypogonadism features in men, Cushing’s disease appearance,
etc.
• High falls risk is an important clinical feature. Though high falls risk does not
define osteoporosis, it is arguably the main risk factor for fracture in the
elderly, and it can be detected systematically using guidelines (see UK advice
in NICE Clinical Guideline 161).1
Investigations
• People aged >50 years old who have a fragility fracture should be investigated
to exclude secondary causes of osteoporosis (e.g. hyperparathyroidism,

[SECTION]•

CKD3b–5, myeloma, etc.).
Any fracture in a person >75 years suggests some degree of skeletal fragility,
regardless of DXA scan-derived BMD; tests for underlying disease is
advisable.
Plain radiographs are an insensitive method of assessing bone mass but lateral
spinal images are useful for staging previous vertebral fractures, which may
have occurred with minimal symptomology.
The standard technique for measuring BMD is DXA. It is quick, accurate, low
in radiation dose, and is fairly precise. Sites measurable include lumbar spine,
femoral neck, forearm, and whole body.
DXA is typically interpreted in terms of the T-score or Z-score. The T-score
(used only by convention for postmenopausal women and men >50 years of
age) is the SD multiple difference between the individual’s BMD compared
with the mean peak BMD achieved in the third decade matched for gender and
ethnicity. The Z score (used by convention in premenopausal women and
children and all men <50 years of age) is the standard deviation (SD) multiple
difference between the individual’s BMD and the age/gender/ethnicitymatched average. T- and Z-scores can be minus values. In postmenopausal
women, for every SD decrease in BMD there is a twofold increase in the risk
of fracture.
Quantitative CT allows volume measurements and can distinguish between
cortical and trabecular bone in vertebrae. It is, however, costly and entails a
high radiation exposure.
Bone ultrasound (US) of the os calcis has been used to predict fracture. Both
the attenuation and speed of US in bone may relate to material properties of
bone relevant to fragility and fracture.
Bone biopsy (undecalcified transiliac) may be useful in cases of multiple
comorbidity to discriminate high and low turnover disease and whether there
is demineralization but is not routinely in the assessment of osteoporosis.
Routine biochemical and haematological tests are usually normal in
osteoporosis. High bone turnover disease may be indicated by high bone
turnover markers (e.g. collagen crosslinks (CTX)).
Reduction of CTX has been linked with bisphosphonate response and may be
an indicator of drug adherence.

Prevention of osteoporosis and fragility fractures
• The prevention of a first fragility (osteoporotic) fracture is termed ‘primary
prevention’ and prevention of second and subsequent fragility fractures
—‘secondary prevention’ (/treatment of osteoporosis).

[SECTION]• All people who have a fragility fracture after the age of 50 years (or for
women, if post-menopausal) should be assessed for their risk of further
fragility fracture and osteoporosis. Typically, this will be done by a Fracture
Liaison Service (FLS) linked to the Orthopaedic Unit (secondary prevention
assessment).
• Underlying diseases (known or unknown) and modifiable clinical or lifestyle
issues relevant to skeletal health will be identified in many patients by such an
assessment. FLSs will triage patients for specialist assessment or secondary
fracture prevention management including DXA scanning and considering
osteoporosis medications.
• Primary prevention is best undertaken by case-finding based on the presence
of osteoporosis risk factors, utilizing the FRAX risk factor tool (
http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX) then obtaining DXA in people with multiple
risk factors or high scores on FRAX. Osteoporosis treatment can be considered
based on BMD and fracture risk.
Calcium
• Calcium intake, either increased by dietary intake or supplements, has not
been shown to prevent osteoporotic fractures.
• However, chronic calcium lack leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism which
can cause accelerated bone loss and this may contribute to osteoporosis and
bone fragility.
• Providing calcium supplements is wise if there is a low-calcium diet (e.g. poor
in dairy products) and/or secondary hyperparathyroidism.
• Calcium supplementation in pre-pubertal children enhances the rate of
increase in BMD with age but whether this translates into higher peak BMD is
unknown.
• At present the use of calcium supplements is recommended for:
• calcium deficiency indicated by secondary hyperparathyroidism if vitamin
D levels are replete (but reasonable then to rule out coeliac disease/poor GI
absorption).
• poor calcium diet particularly in children (<400 mg/day).
• to optimize the effect of bisphosphonate therapy.
• There has been considerable debate as to whether calcium supplementation is
associated with an increased risk of cardio/cerebrovascular disease.
Exercise
• There is some evidence to suggest that weight-bearing activity decreases the
rate of bone loss around the menopause, although the level and type of activity

[SECTION]remains unclear.
• There is little impact of exercise in improving bone mass once osteoporotic,
although it may aid in preventing further loss.
• Profound losses of hip BMD in the elderly may be highly and predominantly
influenced by reduction of mobility/weight-bearing.
Hormone replacement
• Oestrogen replacement therapy is an effective way of preventing postmenopausal bone loss. The addition of a progestogen allows endometrial
shedding and minimizes risk of neoplasia.
• The minimum oral dose of estradiol required is 1 mg/day, and conjugated
oestrogen 0.3 mg/day. Estradiol gels and transdermal treatments should be
started at 1 mg/day or 25 micrograms/day, respectively.
• Evidence suggests that the use of HRT increases risk of DVT, coronary artery
disease, breast cancer, and stroke. HRT should therefore be used with caution,
should be time limited, and used when the risks of these diseases otherwise is
lowest.
Bisphosphonates
• Weekly oral bisphosphonates (risedronate or alendronic acid) reduce fragility
fractures by 35–50% at the spine and by less at the hip in women who have
had a fragility fracture or osteoporosis-range BMD.
• Monthly ibandronic acid 150 mg is also licensed for postmenopausal
osteoporosis. Cyclical etidronate is nowadays seldom used.
• Fracture prevention data with oral bisphosphonates is not as extensive for men
as for women but treatment is considered effective for men with fragility
fracture and with DXA-defined osteoporosis.
• IV zoledronic acid 5 mg given yearly (×3 years original RCT data), is
available if oral therapies fail, are not tolerated or contraindicated. Fracture
prevention is as much as 70% for vertebral fractures in 3 years.
• Ibandronic acid 3 mg IV (‘push’ injection taking just a few seconds) once
every 3 months is licensed also for postmenopausal women and some bone
physicians considered it relatively safe in mild renal impairment, where
zoledronic acid is not used (i.e. estimated GFR 25–35 mL/min/1.73 m2) and
denosumab is contraindicated.
• Currently most physicians will review the balance of risks and benefits of
long-term bisphosphonate therapy after 5-year oral, and 3-year parenteral,
bisphosphonate use. For those patients still at high fracture risk though,
treatment can be continued for a further 3–5 years accordingly.

[SECTION]• The emerging concern about the incidence of atypical femoral fractures
(AFFs) in long-term bisphosphonate users has prompted changes in strategic
long-term planning of medications for osteoporosis. AFFs can present with
proximal femoral bone pain for many months before (somewhat catastrophic)
subtrochanteric fracture, and can be bilateral. Cause is unknown but thought to
be a combination of low bone turnover/bone replacement at a site of critical
weight-bearing stress on the femoral bone.
• In general, bisphosphates are well tolerated, but should be used with caution in
renal impairment (estimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), history of
oesophageal reflux/hiatus hernia, or poor dentition requiring dental work (risk
of mandibular osteonecrosis).
• Oral medications should be taken fasting. Absorption may be optimum if food
intake is avoided for 60 minutes following taking the tablet. Symptoms of
nausea and reflux can be lessened by taking with plenty of water and avoid
lying down after taking the tablet.
• Adherence with oral therapy is variable with reports from the USA of <30%,
but reports in the UK of >80% at 2–4 years’ therapy. Adherence is best when
treatment is started by a FLS following fragility fracture in comparison to
starting as part of primary fragility fracture prevention treatment plan.
• The effects of bisphosphonates are optimized if vitamin D remains replete and
there is sufficient calcium intake to prevent deficiency (e.g. no secondary
hyperparathyroidism).
• The therapeutic effect of bisphosphonates can be predicted to a degree by
demonstration of a reduction in bone resorption biomarkers (e.g. CTX)
measured on serum or plasma before and 2 months after treatment is started.
Strontium ranelate
• Strontium ranelate 2 g daily was shown to decrease fracture risk over 3 years
in men and postmenopausal women (by about 40%), but its use has been
considerably restricted in recent years because it increases vascular disease
risk (e.g. CVD, IHD, and thrombosis). Strontium has now been withdrawn
from use.
• Strontium is similar to calcium chemically but much ‘heavier’. It is
incorporated into the hydroxyapatite bone matrix and naturally leads to large
increases in BMD, though the relationship of change in BMD to change in
fracture risk is neither linear nor proportional to BMD changes associated with
fracture risk reduction seen in other therapies, for example.
• The association with markedly increased BMD is important to note when
reviewing serial DXA scan data on patients previously treated with strontium.

[SECTION]Teriparatide
• Teriparatide is a parathyroid hormone analogue given as a SC injection daily
for 2 years.
• Licensed for use in postmenopausal osteoporosis, though not in men, it
reduced vertebral fracture risk by about 70%.
• Teriparatide initially triggers osteoblast-mediated bone matrix production then
an increase in bone turnover. It may achieve therefore a gain in bone
(‘anabolic’) unlike anti-resorption therapies.
• In the UK, teriparatide is heavily restricted for use for NHS postmenopausal
osteoporosis by NICE and cannot be used without specialist application for
individual funding for men with osteoporosis.
Denosumab
• Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the RANK
ligand, and is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption.
• Denosumab is licensed in Europe for a range of bone loss conditions including
post-menopausal osteoporosis and bone loss in patients being treated with
hormone ablation for prostate and breast cancer.
• Denosumab 60 mg SC injection once every 6 months reduces vertebral
fracture rate by about 70% in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis over 3
years (FREEDOM trial).
• The FREEDOM trial extension now shows fracture prevention, BMD accrual,
and no major safety issues for up to 8 years’ continuous use.
Odanacatib
• Odanacatib was developed a cathepsin K inhibitor to inhibit osteoclastic bone
resorption, then slowing bone loss.
• Phase II data indicate that 50 mg once weekly inhibits bone resorption and
increases BMD, with only a transient decrease in bone formation.
• In a phase III RCT, fracture reduction was shown but subsequently the drug
was withdrawn due to an unacceptably high number of cerebrovascular events
in patients in the treatment arm.
Romosozumab
• The monoclonal antibody romosozumab binds to sclerostin thus inhibiting the
effect of sclerostin, which is an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of osteoblast
activity, thus increasing bone formation.
• In the phase III FRAME (FRActure study in postmenopausal woMen with
ostEoporosis) study, which enrolled 7180 women, SC 210 mg dose of

[SECTION]romosozumab resulted in a statistically significant 73% reduction in the
relative risk of a new vertebral fracture at 12 months compared to those
receiving placebo (fracture incidence 0.5% vs 1.8%, respectively (p <0.001).
• At time of going to press the licensing for romosozumab is on hold pending
further investigation into cardiovascular adverse events in clinical trials.
Abaloparatide
• Abaloparatide is a novel synthetic analogue of human PTHrP (1–34).
• It can stimulate bone formation with less accompanying bone resorption and
hypercalcaemic effects that can occur with PTH (1–34).
• In postmenopausal osteoporosis, weekly SC abaloparatide, compared with
placebo, reduced the risk of new vertebral and non-vertebral fractures over 18
months (ACTIVE study).
• Treatment with a bisphosphonate after an 18-month course of abaloparatide
may consolidate BMD and fracture risk reduction gains.
Other therapies
• Vertebroplasty is the percutaneous injection of bone cement into painful
fractured vertebrae. It can be used to treat osseous haemangiomas and
fractures caused by malignancy.
• Initially vertebroplasty was reported to reduce the pain of vertebral fractures
though RCTs then showed conflicting results. Currently a large RCT (vs sham
procedure) is in process (VERTOS IV).
• Kyphoplasty (balloon inflation in the vertebral body then balloon injected with
bone cement as for vertebroplasty) is unproven by robust study as to whether
there is cost-effectivity of the procedure vs conservative fracture pain
management or vs vertebroplasty.
Guidelines for managing osteoporosis
• In the UK, Europe and North America, numerous societies have generated
guidelines for managing osteoporosis.
• In the UK, NICE guidelines operate to control funding treatments in the NHS.
Guidelines are based on economic models of disease and treatment effects, not
on clinical factors alone. The reader is advised to consult the NICE
Technology Appraisal Guidance (TA204 and TA464) and Clinical Guideline
146.2
• In the UK the National Osteoporosis Guideline Group regularly posts
consensus guidelines (e.g. see: https://www.shef.ac.uk/NOGG/).

Vitamin D deficiency, osteomalacia, and rickets
• Osteomalacia (adults) and rickets (children) are characterized by defective
mineralization of bone and cartilage and the accumulation of unmineralized
bone matrix (osteoid).
• Rickets is the term used for this defect in growing children before the closure
of the epiphyses.
• There is considerable debate over the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25(OH)D) that constitutes ‘repletion’ and ‘deficiency’. For the majority of the
UK population a reasonable ‘repletion’ level is >50 nmol/L and deficiency
level <30 nmol/L. In the elderly, levels of ‘insufficiency’ (30–50 nmol/L) may
be pathologically relevant and a better ‘repletion’ level taken as >75 nmol/L.
• There are many causes of osteomalacia, but essentially they all occur due to
either a deficiency (low sunlight exposure, dietary lack, or suboptimal
metabolism) or resistance to vitamin D, or a non-PTH related defect in renal
handling of phosphate (Table 16.4).
• In both osteomalacia and rickets, PTH is invariably raised due to vitamin Dassociated calcium lack. High PTH can increase bone turnover/bone loss and
amplify bone loss in osteoporosis.
• Both vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) from vegetables in the diet, and vitamin D3
(cholecalciferol) from animal tissues and de novo synthesis in skin, are
metabolized in the liver to 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2/25(OH)D3) and then in the
kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2/D3 respectively: the active forms of
vitamin D.
• 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is considered more biologically potent than 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D2 and negatively affects both 1α-hydroxylase (its own
activating enzyme), and transcription of the PTH gene, but increases the
capacity of GI calcium absorption by enhancing the transcription and therefore
effect of calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs).
• 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 stimulates bone formation through stimulating
osteoblast differentiation and activity thereby increasing coupled bone
turnover.
• 25(OH)D3 can be also be converted into 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which is
biologically inactive and destined for excretion.

[SECTION]Clinical and laboratory findings
• Classical symptoms of osteomalacia are bone pain and tenderness, bone
deformity (depending on age of onset), and proximal muscle weakness
(waddling gait); muscle enzymes and biopsy are normal.
• The hypocalcaemia of osteomalacia usually does not cause symptoms but can
cause paraesthesia and tetany. Rarely, it is severe enough to cause cardiac
dysrhythmia, convulsions, or psychosis.
• Children with rickets may be hypotonic and apathetic with growth retardation
and delayed walking. On weight-bearing, bones become bowed, and there is
irregularity of the metaphyseal–epiphyseal junction, usually at the wrist and
costochondral junctions. The latter gives rise to the feature ‘rachitic rosary’.
An indentation may also arise along the attachment of the diaphragm to the
softened ribs (Harrison’s groove). Rapid growth of the softened skull leads to
craniotabes, parietal bone flattening, and frontal bossing. Dentition is delayed
and poor.
• In rickets, many bony deformities persist despite treatment (unless due to
simple dietary deficiency and treated early) and may require surgery, e.g. tibial
osteotomy to correct lower limb alignment.
• The classical radiographic change of osteomalacia is the pseudo-fracture
(Looser’s zone). These are incomplete radiolucent fracture lines perpendicular
to the cortex, with poor callus formation and found most often at ribs,
clavicles, pubic rami, femoral neck, metatarsals, and outer border of scapulae.
• Laboratory investigations show low 25(OH)D, a low or low reference range
serum calcium and phosphate, elevated ALP, low urinary calcium excretion,
and secondary hyperparathyroidism.
• Osteomalacia may exist with reference range levels of calcium, phosphate, and
ALP; thus only raised PTH, reduced 25(OH)D, and low urinary calcium (24
hour), tested simultaneously, disclose the diagnosis.
• Levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may be in the reference range and are
therefore not routinely tested.
• Vitamin D deficiency through poor diet intake is rare unless combined with
exposure to sunlight. It is a phenomenon seen most often in the housebound
elderly, and in immigrant Asian populations.
• Intestinal disorders that lead to fat malabsorption can cause vitamin D
deficiency, as vitamin D is fat soluble.

Management of hypovitaminosis D, rickets, and osteomalacia
• The strategy should be to replace 25(OH)D to target repletion level, provide
enough calcium to mineralize bone normalizing any secondary
hyperparathyroidism, control skeletal pain, pursue a physio-led muscle
rehabilitation regimen if there is any myopathy, and finally prevent the
condition from recurring.
• Quite commonly there may be two lesions in the elderly: osteomalacia and
osteoporosis. It is unknown to what degree bisphosphonate therapy for
osteoporosis will impair mineralization/osteomalacia recovery if treatment for
both conditions is given simultaneously. Delaying osteoporosis treatment for
4–6 weeks is unlikely to harm and may give valuable time for osteomalacia
healing based on necessary higher bone turnover (can be indicated by an ‘ALP
flare’).
• Bone pain and muscle weakness respond quickly to successful replacement
therapy though laboratory and radiological features may take longer to return
to normal.
• In adults, various regimens for cholecalciferol replacement might be
recommended (e.g. 20,000 IU cholecalciferol weekly for 5 weeks), though
caution is advised in regard of ‘over-replacement regimens’, which have been
associated with an increased falls and fracture risk.

[SECTION]• An alternative (and potentially well-adhered-to regimen) is 3200 IU
colecalciferol daily in twice-daily doses for a calendar month. Repletion status
should then be tested with repeat 25(OH)D check and repeat course of
treatment given if required.
• Vitamin-D (and calcium) lack may be habitual as it depends on UV-skin
exposure and dietary preferences. Identification of repeat deficiency then in
future is facilitated by periodic 25(OH)D testing.
• Co-treatment with calcium supplements isn’t necessary in all cases but is
usually safe at daily supplement doses of 500–1000 mg without causing
hypercalcaemia.
Vitamin D-dependent rickets
• Type I vitamin D-dependent rickets is a rare autosomal recessive disease
caused by inactivating mutations in the 1α-hydroxylase gene. Low levels of
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D result. Children are often affected with rickets
before the age of 2 years, and fail to respond to normal levels of vitamin D
replacement. Treatment is most effective with physiological doses of 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D (e.g. calcitriol).
• Type II vitamin D-dependent rickets is an autosomal recessive disorder caused
by loss of function mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR). About 70% of
patients will have alopecia—an important prognostic feature when discussing
likely outcome of treatment. In patients with normal hair, remission can be
achieved with high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Only about 50% of
patients with alopecia will respond to a similar therapeutic approach.
Osteomalacia from altered phosphate homeostasis
• Osteomalacia from phosphate depletion is histologically the same in the
skeleton as 25(OH)D deficiency, although serum calcium and 25(OH)D
are/can be normal.
• X-linked (AD) hypophosphataemic rickets (XLHR) is a disorder of vitamin D
resistance. It is important to diagnose early in young children as treatment
prevents bone deformity.
• XLHR manifests as delayed growth, short stature, lower limb skeletal
deformity, and rickets.
• In XLHR, dental development can be delayed but dentition is usually normal.
Proximal myopathy is not a feature. Laboratory tests show a low serum
phosphate, normal serum calcium and PTH, and low/normal 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D with high FGF23. The renal tubular maximum
reabsorption of phosphate for GFR is low for the degree of

[SECTION]•

•

•

•

hypophosphataemia (TMP-GFR).
The treatment of XLHR is a combination of calcitriol (0.125–1.5
micrograms/day) and phosphate (25 mg/kg/day in infants, and 1–3 g elemental
phosphorus in adults).
Complications
of
long-term
treatment
include
hypercalcaemia,
hypercalciuria/renal lesions, and hyperparathyroidism.
The requirements for calcitriol and phosphorus therapy in adults with XLHR is
generally reduced and management of the condition refocuses on the need to
address tertiary hyperparathyroidism, address osteoarthritis, and MSK
symptoms caused by or associated with the enthesopathy which evolves over
time.
Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and Fanconi syndrome may be associated with
osteomalacia and rickets.
In RTA, there is a disorder of bicarbonate handling leading to low plasma
bicarbonate, metabolic acidosis, and an inappropriate urine pH. Type I distal
tubular RTA occurs as a result of failure to secrete hydrogen ions.
Type II proximal RTA is a consequence of bicarbonate wasting and is often
associated with Fanconi syndrome. The development of rickets in both forms
of RTA is due to hypophosphataemia. The acidosis should be treated and
vitamin D supplements given.
Fanconi syndrome is associated with a number of acquired or inherited
disorders including multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, heavy metal toxicity, and
disorders of carbohydrate metabolism.
The net effect of proximal renal tubular defects is glycosuria, aminoaciduria,
phosphaturia, and hypophosphataemia. Treatment is with phosphate and
calcitriol supplements.

Oncogenic hypophosphataemic osteomalacia
Also known as tumour-induced osteomalacia, this is caused by (usually small)
benign mesenchymal tumours, which secrete FGF23. See Plate 16.
• The condition is cured after removal of the tumour though detection of the
tumour can be difficult.
• Tumours can be anywhere including in bone. Many anecdotal reports of
tumours existing in odd positions exist (e.g. sinuses, in skin, deep fat tissue,
labia, etc.).
• Functional imaging with somatostatin receptor or PET scintigraphy (e.g.
gallium-67 gadopentetate) is often used as first-line imaging with CT or MRI
then used to precisely locate the lesions.
• A milder form of the condition occurs in fibrous dysplasia and

[SECTION]neurofibromatosis.
• In the absence of curative surgery, treatment involves long-term phosphate and
calcitriol supplements and careful monitoring for phosphate-induced
hyperparathyroid disease and effects of hypercalciuria.

Hypercalcaemia, parathyroid disease, and related
disorders
Hypercalcaemia
• The clinical picture of hypercalcaemia can range from the asymptomatic to an
acute medical emergency.
• Serum calcium is normally balanced between homeostatic mechanisms in the
gut, skeleton, kidneys, and extracellular fluids.
• Hypercalcaemia arises most often from excessive mobilization of calcium
from bone by osteoclastic resorption, but may also occur due to excessive gut
absorption (Table 16.5).
• The excessive bone loss, a failure of the kidneys to handle high loads of
calcium, and a failure of bone to reclaim minerals quickly enough, leads to the
imbalance.
• Accelerated osteoclast activity may be driven by several causes including
excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) or PTH-related protein (PTHrp) and
cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-1, TNFα, and TGF-β).
• Clinical presentation of moderate to severe hypercalcaemia includes:
• joint, bone, muscle pain.
• muscle weakness.
• dehydration and polyuria.
• lethargy.
• fatigue.
• acute confusional state—unconsciousness.
• abdominal pains and vomiting.
• renal colic pains.
• ECG findings—short QT interval, etc.
• Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and malignancy are the most common
causes of hypercalcaemia (90% of cases). Other causes include sarcoid,
lymphoma, and granulomatous inflammatory conditions.
• Active vitamin D3 (calcitriol/1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) can be produced by
tissue
macrophages
which
generate
1α-hydroxylase.
Macrophage/inflammatory cell calcitriol production (e.g. in sarcoid) is not

[SECTION]regulated as occurs in renal vitamin D3 activation as there is no feedback
inhibition of 1α-hydroxylase nor diversion of its substrate (25-hydroxyvitamin
D3) to an inactive form (24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) by increasing amounts of
calcitriol, which happens in normal renal calcitriol production.
• Treatment of hypercalcaemia (Table 16.7) depends on the level of serum
calcium, the presence of symptoms, renal impairment, and the underlying
cause. For example, borderline high serum calcium in an asymptomatic
individual with a mildly elevated PTH may simply warrant observation in the
absence of renal impairment or vitamin D deficiency. On the other hand, an
individual with severe hypercalcaemia, dehydration, and renal impairment due
to a treatable malignancy would require urgent aggressive management.
• With acute hypercalcaemia, dehydration is very common. Early rehydration is
very important and often given for 24–48 hours prior to review of serum
calcium levels and the instigation of further therapies such as bisphosphonates
and loop diuretics (Table 16.6).

Hypercalcaemia in infancy and childhood
• Chronic hypercalcaemia of infancy may not be associated with the more
common clinical features mentioned previously. More often there is a failure
to thrive, abdominal pain, and irritability. Acute hypercalcaemia is very rare in
children.
• Conditions to consider are listed in Table 16.7.

Parathyroid disorders
Primary hyperparathyroidism
• Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a relatively common condition;
incidence 1 in 1000. It occurs at all ages, although is much more common after
the age of 60 with a female to male ratio of 3:1. It is unusual in childhood—
when it should raise the possibility of familial multiple endocrine neoplasia
(MEN) type I or type II.
• A single benign adenoma accounts for 80% of cases of PHPT.
• Generalized four-gland hyperplasia accounts for 15–20% of cases.
• Parathyroid carcinoma is very rare.
• PHPT is associated with bone, renal, GI, and neuromuscular complications.
Bony problems can be seen on plain radiographs and range from low BMD on
DXA scanning and mild sub-periosteal bone resorption to osteitis fibrosa
cystica, bone resorption of the distal phalanges and clavicles, patchy
osteosclerosis (classic ‘rugger jersey’ spine), and multiple lytic lesions of the
skull.
• General symptoms include fatigue and myalgias (myopathy is rare).
• CPPD disease is a relatively under-recognized association (look for joint
chondrocalcinosis, crowned dens syndrome See Plate 22, typical features in
OA joints (‘OA-plus’)). Kidney stones are uncommon. GI manifestations
include peptic ulceration and pancreatitis.
• PHPT is easily diagnosed with raised PTH in the context of replete level
25(OH)D, and high (or high reference range) serum calcium and low (or lowreference range) phosphate. Often 24-hour urinary calcium levels are
uninformative.

[SECTION]• Medical management includes adequate rehydration and avoidance of high
calcium intake and calcium supplements, gentle correction of 25(OH)D
deficiency and a bisphosphonate to limit bone loss.
• Successful parathyroidectomy from minimally invasive targeted surgery is
feasible in the majority of cases for single adenomas identified by imaging
(e.g. 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy and US though (contrast-enhanced, delayed
phase) CT is also used in equivocal cases).
• Neck exploration surgery is required if imaging fails to identify an adenoma.
Surgery should only be done by experienced surgeons.
• Conservative management is acceptable if patients are asymptomatic, and do
not have osteoporosis though also may be necessary if surgery is not feasible.
Bisphosphonates do stabilize BMD loss as indicated by DXA and can be used
long-term.
• Clinical trials with calcimimetic agents (stimulates the PTH gland Calcium
sensing receptors with consequent inhibition of PTH secretion) such as
cinacalcet, can be used in cases where parathyroidectomy is not feasible/failed
and there are hypercalcaemic symptoms.
Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism
• Secondary HPT (SHPT) occurs as a consequence of low serum calcium and
PTH gland CaSR ‘sensing’ of calcium levels.
• Calcium lack and thus SHPT are often due to vitamin D deficiency.
• SHPT from calcium lack alone (where there is replete 25(OH)D) is unusual
though may point to a severe GI absorption problem.
• With time, persistent SHPT can lead to autonomous PTH release (tertiary
HPT). This is most often seen in severe or prolonged renal bone disease or
from long-term calcitriol use (e.g. XLHR).
• Calcimimetics may have an important role to play in controlling tertiary HPT
but at present parathyroidectomy is the best option.
Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH)
• FHH is extremely rare. It is inherited as autosomal dominant with high
penetrance. Radiographs, PTH, and renal function are normal in
uncomplicated cases. Although parathyroid gland hyperplasia occurs,
parathyroidectomy is invariably unsuccessful at lowering serum calcium
levels.
• The two indications for parathyroidectomy in FHH are neonatal severe HPT
and adult relapsing pancreatitis.
• Use of diuretics, oestrogens, or phosphate to regulate serum calcium has been

[SECTION]unsuccessful. Patients should therefore be followed without intervention
unless complications arise.
• FHH needs to be considered when diagnosing PHPT (where hypercalcaemia
and elevated PTH levels are modest). First discrimination is made by repleting
25(OH)D to 100 nmol/L then retesting all biochemistry. PTH usually
normalizes in FHH, unless there is tertiary HPT, but won’t in PHPT. Also if
the calcium:creatinine clearance ratio is <0.02 then FHH is 98% likely (CCCR
= uCa/(uCr × sCr)).
• In pregnancy the three situations to be aware of are:
• asymptomatic hypercalcaemia in an affected baby of a carrier.
• neonatal hypercalcaemia in an affected baby of an unaffected mother
(intrauterine SHPT, which resolves spontaneously).
• hypocalcaemia in an unaffected baby of an affected mother (fetal
parathyroid suppression).
Familial primary hyperparathyroid syndromes
• Up to 10% of cases of PHPT may have a hereditary syndrome. The most
common of these is MEN.
• MEN1 is autosomal dominant (M = F), is associated with pancreatic, thymic,
gastric, and pituitary adenomas, and adrenal hyperplasia.
• Pancreatic, thymic, and bronchial neuroendocrine tumours are the leading
cause of death in patients with MEN-1 and should be regularly monitored for
(e.g. biannual computed tomography imaging).
• The MEN1 gene consists of ten exons, spanning 10 kb, and encodes a 610amino acid protein (‘menin’—its function as yet not fully known but may play
a role in tumour suppression).
• MEN2A (Sipple syndrome) is autosomal dominant and is characterized by
phaeochromocytomas and medullary thyroid carcinoma and is highly
associated with the RET proto-oncogene.
Parathyroid hormone resistant syndromes
• Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a term applied to a heterogeneous group
of disorders whose common feature is end-organ resistance to PTH. PHP type
1A (PHP1A) is characterized by resistance to other hormones, including TSH
and gonadotropins.
• PHP1A is associated with clinical features referred to as Albright hereditary
osteodystrophy (AHO; includes short stature, obesity, round facies,
subcutaneous ossifications, brachydactyly, other skeletal anomalies, and some
patients have mental retardation).

[SECTION]• In PHP1A, there is decreased cellular cAMP response to PTH infusion,
decreased erythrocyte Gs activity, and a GNAS1 mutation in the maternally
derived allele.
• In PHP1B, there is renal PTH resistance, decreased cAMP response to PTH
infusion, normal erythrocyte Gs activity, and imprinting/methylation defects at
the GNAS locus resulting in lack of expression of the maternal allele in renal
tissue. Classically, patients do not have features of AHO.
• PHP1B is not associated with generalized hormone resistance, although
resistance to thyroid-stimulating hormone has been reported.
• Individuals with AHO without endocrine abnormalities, a normal cellular
cAMP response to PTH infusion, decreased erythrocyte Gs activity and a
GNAS1
mutation
in
the
paternally-inherited
allele
have
pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP).
CKD-mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) incorporating renal
osteodystrophy (ROD)
• The kidneys are key in regulating calcium and phosphate, are a target organ
for PTH and FGF23, and are the primary source for 1α-hydroxylation
mediated activation of 25(OH)D.
• CKD-MBD (the term was first proposed by Kidney Disease: Improving
Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2005) describes a broad clinical syndrome
which includes skeletal, soft tissue, and vascular abnormalities that develop as
a result of CKD. Renal skeletal disease alone is termed ‘renal osteodystrophy
(ROD; Table 16.8).
• ROD can be a spectrum of bone disease from ‘high turnover’ (due to primary
or tertiary hyperparathyroidism) to ‘low turnover’ (termed adynamic) bone
disease where PTH levels are generally low (reference range or modest
elevation).
• Phosphate retention (secondary), FGF23 elevation, hypovitaminosis D,
hypocalcaemia, impaired calcitriol production, and skeletal resistance to PTH
all contribute to secondary HPT in CKD with relevant effects beginning in
CKD3 (estimated GFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2).
• Historically low turnover, adynamic ROD has been related to excess
aluminium deposition in bone in dialysis patients—thus more prevalent in
peritoneal dialysis patients compared with haemodialysis.
• Bone fragility and increased fracture risk is a consequence of all types of
ROD. Clinical manifestations of ROD are in Table 16.8.

General management of ROD
• Early dietary restriction of phosphate can maintain normal calcium levels, but
low-phosphate diets are often unacceptable and normal phosphate levels are
best achieved with binding agents (some contain calcium).
• Small doses of calcitriol (vitamin D) may help to lower serum PTH levels.
Some individuals may be sensitive to calcitriol and serum calcium levels may
increase. Most patients require doses of 0.25–0.5 micrograms daily; children
may require higher doses.
• Parathyroidectomy is indicated in persistent symptomatic hypercalcaemia,
ectopic calcification, and severe bone pain.
Ectopic calcification and ossification
• Ectopic calcification can arise from any one of a number of causes of
hypercalcaemia or hyperphosphataemia. These include renal failure,
hyperparathyroidism, familial hyperphosphataemia tumoural calcinosis
(OMIM 211900) and sarcoidosis. Dystrophic calcification is also a feature of
systemic sclerosis (see Chapter 13), dermatomyositis (see Chapter 14),
and primary calcinosis.
• Ectopic ossification can be seen post trauma and following myositis. It is also

[SECTION]a feature of several rare conditions including PHP and myositis ossificans
progressiva. Early signs of muscle ossification are best detected with MRI
scanning. Later ossification is easily visible on plain radiographs. Treatment is
difficult, but includes physiotherapy to maintain suppleness and possibly
heparins or bisphosphonates to halt bone formation.

Paget’s disease of bone
• Paget’s disease of bone (PDB) is a localized disorder of bone remodelling
resulting in expansion and deformity of bone.
• PDB is common (about 5% of the population >55 years) in the UK, North
America, Australia, and New Zealand, with a male to female ratio of 3:2. It’s
uncommon in Asia, Africa, Scandinavia, and South America.
• The ‘lesion’ in PDB is substantially increased (coupled) bone remodelling,
driven by an excess number of multinucleated, highly active osteoclasts,
producing excessive woven bone (immature bone characterized by erratic
collagen orientation).
• Theories of PDB being caused by viruses have largely been disproved.
• PDB has a genetic basis; 15–30% PDB patients have a positive family history;
there is a 7× risk of developing PDB if your first-degree relative has it and
30% of familial cases have gene mutations at 5q35 (the gene encodes for an
ubiquitin-binding protein sequestasome-1 (SQSTM1/p62)).
• SQSTM1 mutations indicate severity of PDB, the protein playing an important
role in NFKβ signalling.
• PDB patients with SQSTM1 mutations can have a variable clinical phenotype
however, indicating modifying gene or environmental effects also are relevant.
• The clinical features of PDB are shown in Table 16.9.

Investigation and treatment
• Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a measure of osteoblast-derived bone
formation, is the most useful marker of high bone remodelling and may be
elevated as much as 30× above normal.
• Reference range ALP can mean bone turnover is low (‘inactive PDB’) but is
not specific. The degree of abnormality of ALP often associates with the
number of bones affected, polyostotic disease being associated with higher
ALP values.
• The differential diagnosis of increased (bone) ALP includes metastatic bone
disease, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, and osteomyelitis or
inflammation.
• Because of the increased bone turnover, other biomarkers will be abnormal:
e.g. increased urine hydroxyproline, serum/plasma CTX, P1NP.
• There is a wide variation in radiographic appearance of the condition but the
main features are localized sclerosis, coarse and irregular trabecular
patterning, and bone expansion.
• 99mTC methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphy is a sensitive
investigation for defining the extent of lesions. See Plate 22.
• There are several indications for treatment of Paget’s disease:
• Pain arising from affected sites.
• Deforming disease.
• Fissure fractures.
• Skull disease.

PDB and related osteoarthritic pain may be reduced by simple analgesics, but
pure pagetic bone pain responds poorly to this.
Full biomechanical assessment, particularly looking for correctable
deformities with judicious orthosis use, is invariably helpful.
First-line treatment of PDB is a single dose of zoledronic acid 5 mg IV.
An alternative is risedronate 30 mg daily for 2 months. The relapse rate with
risedronate is significantly higher than with zoledronic acid.
Historically, etidronate (e.g. 6 months at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day), pamidronate
(e.g. 90 mg IV ×2 doses fortnight apart) and calcitonin (50–100 IU SC
injection daily, reducing to 50 IU 2 or 3 times per week once a symptomatic
response is achieved (usually after 4–8 weeks) have shown benefit in reducing
PDB pain and ALP. However, relapse risk is moderately high compared with
zoledronic acid. Calcitonin often causes nausea, flushing, and diarrhoea.
Many PDB patients achieve long-term biochemical remission with just a
single treatment of zoledronic acid 5 mg.
Typical side effects of zoledronic acid, as with pamidronate, includes transient
‘flu-like’ symptoms of fever, myalgia, and arthralgia.
Zoledronic acid 5 mg IV used for ALP rise alone does not appear to benefit
PDB patients compared with patients treated on the basis of PDB symptoms
alone (PRISM-EZ); indeed, it may be associated with a greater risk of
fractures (in non-pagetoid bone).
Zoledronic acid is currently being studied for its role in PDB development in
high-risk (SQSTM-1 mutation-positive) patients.
Typical surgical interventions include arthroplasty—where accelerated OA has
evolved in joints adjacent to pagetoid bone, fixation of fractures, and
realignment osteotomies where there is significant deformity amenable to
surgical correction.
Vitamin D deficiency is increased in frequency in PDB patients compared to
expected, thus it should be sought and corrected.
Denosumab is predicted to be effective at reducing bone turnover, pain, and
ALP in PDB but treatment will be relatively expensive, relapse of PDB is
likely to occur on treatment cessation, and the rebound increase in bone
turnover at that time, is likely to preclude its adoption as a routine treatment
for PDB.

[SECTION]Childhood autoinflammatory bone diseases
Introduction
Autoinflammatory bone diseases are disorders primarily driven by abnormalities
of the innate immune system.3
• The most common disorders include chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis
(CNO); synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO)
syndrome; Majeed syndrome; deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
(DIRA); cherubism; and juvenile mandibular chronic osteomyelitis (JMCO).
• Bone inflammation is typically characterized by a subacute or chronic
inflammation that is bacterial culture negative and with no demonstrable
organism on histopathology.
• NSAIDs are typically used as first-line therapies in CNO. Bisphosphonates
and anti-TNFα drugs have been used for second-line therapies to prevent
pathologic fractures, pain, and disease relapse.
• CNO and SAPHO are discussed in greater detail later in this section and for
the rarer autoinflammatory bone diseases see Table 16.10.

CNO
The terminology for CNO has changed over the last 40 years. The most
commonly used term is chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO);
however, not all patients have multifocal bone lesions or numerous recurrences,
hence the term chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) encompasses all
possible disease presentations.
• CNO is a systemic disease that predominantly occurs in childhood. It has
many similarities to SAPHO syndrome, a disorder primarily seen in adults.
• The incidence and prevalence of CNO is unknown, but the majority of reports
are from Scandinavia, Europe, Australia and North America. Female
predominance/mean age of onset about 10 years of age.
• CNO is a diagnosis of exclusion established by clinical presentation, imaging
studies, and a culture-negative bone biopsy.
• Pain occurs with or without swelling at the site of a bony lesion. Inflammatory
markers are normal or moderately raised.
• Bone lesions tend to cluster around metaphysis, but can occur at sites such as
the clavicle (commonly the medial third).
• The most common CNO sites include the femur, pelvis, calcaneus, ankle,
vertebrae, and clavicle. Multifocal lesions tend to have a symmetrical
distribution. Unifocal disease occurs in 10–20%.
• CNO patients frequently have other coexisting chronic inflammatory diseases
such as psoriasis, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis,
myositis/fasciitis, and parotitis.
• Imaging to clarify diagnosis: radiographs and MRI. CT can be used, but
exposes children to high radiation, so is not recommended.
• Whole-body MRI can assess for asymptomatic (polyostotic) lesions, and
should be considered for indeterminate CNO cases.
• Typical radiographic findings include a lytic lesion at or around the
metaphysis, which may progress to sclerosis or hyperostosis.

[SECTION]• Bone biopsy is often required to confirm the diagnosis—important in isolated
bone lesions, as malignancy can mimic CNO.
Treatment
• NSAIDs are the gold standard initial therapy.
• Case reports suggest GCs, methotrexate (MTX), and sulfasalazine (SZP) may
be beneficial, but results are inconclusive.
• Reports on use of anti-TNFα are inconclusive: some responses are
unsustained.
• IV bisphosphonate (e.g. pamidronate) has been used due to its effect on
reducing osteoclast-driven osteitis pathophysiology.
• Several studies have demonstrated high efficacy rates and good clinical
response occurring in the first 3 days, and inducing remission for 12–18
months.
• However, there are concerns regarding the use of bisphosphonates in children
given the lack of long-term safety data.
• The most common adverse event of pamidronate is minor flu-like symptoms.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is a rare but serious complication and to date
unreported in paediatric use.
• CNO can be a difficult condition to treat, with high rates of non-responders. If
untreated, there is increased risk of pathological fractures, in addition to other
possible morbidities such as generalized growth failure, scoliosis, and
hyperostosis.

SAPHO syndrome
SAPHO syndrome was originally an acronym from the French term: le
Syndrome Acne, Pustulose, Hyperostose et Osteite but later changed and
terminology anglicized in terminology to Syndrome of Synovitis, Acne,
Pustulosis, Hyperostosis and Osteitis. However, the original description is
notable for the absence of synovitis, which probably is quite an uncommon
lesion of the condition.
• SAPHO syndrome has similarity to CNO but can also be classified as an
osteosclerotic bone disease. Furthermore, there may be overlap with the SpA
diseases—some features exist in both SAPHO and some forms of psoriatic
arthritis though SAPHO is not B27 related.4

[SECTION]Patterns and spectrum of disease
• Typical presentation age 30–50 years old though childhood forms exist.
• Pathogenesis may derive from an amplified abnormal innate immune response
to pathogens, with the most likely triggering pathogen being
Propionibacterium acnes.
• A patient’s disease phenotype can be indistinguishable also from axial skeletal
sarcoid.
• There are similarities to and overlap with forms of psoriatic arthritis.
• CRMO has been described as the paediatric presentation of SAPHO. However,
the localization of inflammation is different between the two conditions with
the extremities more often affected in CRMO than SAPHO whereas for the
latter, axial skeleton with costo-sternoclavicular region is the focus.
• Both enthesitis and spondylodiscitis are likely to be associated SAPHO
lesions.
Clinical features
• Painful osteitis lesions, enthesitis, and spondylodiscitis are likely to all occur
in SAPHO lesions.
• Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) and severe acne (acne conglobata, acne
fulminans, hidradenitis suppurativa) are among the typical lesions seen in
SAPHO.
• PPP is more often seen in women and severe acne in men.
• Other skin lesions described in SAPHO include various types of psoriasis;
pyoderma gangrenosum; Sweet’s syndrome; Sneddon–Wilkinson disease.
• Systemic symptoms of fever and fatigue frequently occur.
Differential diagnosis
• Psoriatic arthritis. This can pose diagnostic dilemma since psoriatic arthritis
manifest by spondylodiscitis, osteitis, entheseal/juxta-articular hyperostosis
and pustular psoriasis can mimic SAPHO.
• Infection (osteomyelitis) and neoplasia should be considered though MRI is
usually discriminatory.
• In children, the following should also be considered: Ewing sarcoma, Majeed
syndrome, histiocytosis, and DIRA.
Investigations
• 99mTC MDP (bone) scintigraphy is characteristic in most cases showing
marked tracer accumulation at sternoclavicular area lesions (e.g. Bull’s head
sign).
• On radiographs lesions are often primarily expanded and sclerotic.

[SECTION]• MRI discriminates osteitis from infection and malignancy.
• Laboratory tests are not specific and features of inflammation may be seen:
raised CRP, ESR, platelets, C3, ACE. Immunoglobulins are usually normal
and autoantibodies not detected.
• Bone should be cultured for TB, Propionibacterium, and general pathogens.
• Histology of bone often shows dense disorganized sclerosis with features of
increased bone turnover.
• Histology of skin lesions can show neutrophilic infiltration and pseudoabscesses (differential diagnosis—Sweet’s syndrome).
Treatment
• NSAIDs are used for pain.
• Appropriate antibiotics for culture-positive bone biopsy.
• Colchicine, GCs, oral and IV bisphosphonates, and sDMARDs (e.g. MTX)
have all been used with variable effects.
• Anti-TNFα and anti-IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) have shown good
effect persistent disease.
• For skin manifestations, topical steroids, PUVA, and retinoids have been used.

The osteochondroses
Osteochondrosis is a trauma-induced focal disturbance of cartilage in a joint
(articular), at a periarticular epiphyseal plate or tendon or ligament insertion
(apophysis/enthesis).
• Lesions typically occur in active children and adolescents.
• Osteochondritis may be associated with a delay in growth-associated
endochondral ossification, with a potential consequence of joint or other
biomechanical deformity (see Table 16.11).
• Where the lesion is associated with cleft formation through articular cartilage,
then the lesion is termed ‘dissecans’.
Scheuermann’s disease
Although not consistently defined, Scheuermann’s disease is a vertebral
epiphyseal osteochondritis that occurs in adolescence. See also p. 620
• Although an incidental radiographic finding, Scheuermann’s is also associated
with diffuse spinal pain which is more likely to be present if the
osteochondritis is thoracolumbar (25%), rather than thoracic (75%) and if the

[SECTION]child is an athlete or very active.
• It can present with painless dorsal kyphosis with compensatory lumbar
lordosis and lateral spine radiographs show irregularity of vertebral end-plates,
anterior vertebral wedging, and kyphosis—the latter can develop in late
adolescence or gradually over years.
• In adults who present late, the vertebral deformities may be mistaken for grade
1 vertebral fractures.
• Management is with physiotherapy—working on extensor spinal muscular
strength, and judicious use of analgesics.
Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease
Perthes disease is an osteonecrosis of the femoral epiphysis and occurs in the age
range 3–8 years, most frequently in boys (ratio 4:1).
• Perthes disease is bilateral in 10–20% of cases.
• Symptoms include an insidious onset of limp and pain in the groin or referred
to the knee/thigh that is relieved by rest.
• There may be limitation of hip internal rotation and abduction (due to adductor
spasm).
• Leg length inequality suggests femoral head collapse. There may be
spontaneous resolution, especially in younger patients, in whom conservative
management is indicated.
Osgood–Schlatter disease
This osteochondrosis is probably due to repetitive trauma at the site of patellar
tendon insertion into the tibial tubercle.
• It typically occurs in athletic adolescents, especially young males aged 14–16
years.
• Pain is usually on exercise and eases with rest.
• The diagnosis is made clinically and on demonstrating an enlarged fragmented
tibial tubercle on a lateral view radiograph.
• Bilateral knee views help to distinguish normal from abnormal.
• Differential diagnosis includes SpA-related enthesitis.
Sinding–Larsen–Johansson disease
This osteochondrosis occurs as a consequence of overloading of the patella at its
secondary centre of ossification producing a traction apophysitis at the patella
lower pole.
• Although not exclusive to the group, it is a typical sports-related injury in
adolescent athletes who jump, e.g. high-jump, basketball.
• Treatment is with simple analgesia or NSAIDs, and rest.

[SECTION]Köhler disease
This osteochondrosis is essentially an osteonecrosis lesion of the tarsal navicular.
Changes may represent a developmental variation in ossification and it presents
with a painful limp. Weight-bearing is more comfortable on the outside of the
foot and the navicular is tender.
Freiberg disease
An osteonecrosis of the metatarsal (usually the second) head following trauma,
is most common in adolescent females. Pain is localized and worse on weightbearing with swelling sometimes detectable.
An osteochondritis ‘dissecans’ lesion
An articular osteochondritis lesion can become a ‘dissecans’ lesion when a
fragment of articular cartilage and subchondral bone becomes demarcated and
may form an intra-articular loose body.
• Symptoms of a dissecans lesion are mainly acute-onset pain, an effusion, and
limited movement of the joint.
• Plain radiographs will show a well-circumscribed, sclerotic lesion.
• In young patients before skeletal maturity there is a good chance of dissecans
healing.
• After the epiphysis has closed, however, there is more risk of a loose body and
secondary osteoarthritis if a dissecans lesion persists.
• Arthroscopy can assist in assessing the degree of damage and removing loose
bodies.
• Surgery ranges from drilling the lesion in situ to encourage healing, to bone
osteochondral allografts.

Osteonecrosis
Osteonecrosis is regional ischaemic skeletal injury, which can be caused by
trauma, drugs (e.g. GCs), or systemic conditions—metabolic, haematological, or
endocrine (e.g. sickle cell disease, antiphospholipid syndrome).

[SECTION]• If severe and/or prolonged, ischaemia can cause skeletal cell death leading to
necrotic bone, which can compromise regional skeletal integrity and strength
and lead to fracture, damage to adjacent cartilage, and deformity.
• Osteonecrosis can be symptomatically silent and persist, with no or minimal
symptoms, for years in some cases.
• Ischaemia occurs after mechanical interruption of blood delivery, nontraumatic intravascular occlusion, thrombosis, cholesterol, expanding nitrogen
bubbles or other mechanisms that lead to critical ischaemia; then deposition of
vascularized connective tissue can accumulate at the interface of necrotic and
normal bone. Calcification can follow and necrotic tissue remains as an
‘island’ of inviable bone.
• Local skeletal features include pain or discomfort. Pain evolution may denote
the onset of subchondral bone collapse. If secondary adjacent joint damage
evolves and progresses then features of mechanical joint disease will evolve—
pain and discomfort on movement, stiffness, swelling, and a functional impact
accordingly.
• There may be tenderness on palpating over osteonecrotic bone and signs of
joint effusion if the lesion has affected the adjacent joint causing cartilage loss
or microfracture.
• MRI signs are characteristic and can contribute to grading (e.g. femoral head
after Ficat). See also bone scintigraphy Plate 17.
• Practical radiographic-based osteonecrosis grading can be done using
Steinberg (2001) or even ARCO (1992) grading systems.
• Laboratory testing should focus on systemic causes (Table 16.12).
• Initial management: pain control, addressing remediable underlying systemic
causes/associated disease, agreeing and planning what amount of weight- or
load-bearing of the affected bone is permissible.
• In the absence of data from controlled studies of treatment, management is
based on stage of the lesion and degree of effect on the adjacent joint, thus for
early disease with reversible cause, or repair or revascularization possible
before any collapse of the subchondral bone, conservative measures are
appropriate. But in late disease with subchondral bone collapse, arthroplasty is
considered.
• For osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) consider an 8-week period of
non-weight-bearing.
• Evidence for bisphosphonate use and its effect is anecdotal only.
• Core decompression for ONFH involves removing bone from the medullary
cavity or multiple smaller holes through the bone surface. The cavity may be
then filled with a vascularized fibular graft or by non-vascularized cortical

[SECTION]bone.
• Osteotomy attempts to shift the weight from the necrotic segment but
subsequent joint replacement is technically more difficult. Hemi-resurfacing
preserves the bone for later arthroplasty and is an option for femoral head
collapse in younger patients.
• Skeletal stem cells combined with impaction bone grafting is a novel treatment
translated to the treatment of ONFH.

Fibrous dysplasia
Fibrous dysplasia (FD) manifests as either an isolated (monostotic) or
polyostotic condition as fibrous bone cysts.
• FD presents most often in the second to third decade of life as monostotic
disease, or usually <10 years of age in polyostotic disease.
• FD is manifest by cystic expansion of bones. Lesions can cause pain and local
mechanical effects due to their site and proximity to critical structures (e.g.
nerve foramen in the skeleton).
• FD is due to activating or gain-of-function GNAS1 mutations.
• McCune–Albright syndrome is a triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, hyper
pigmented ‘café-au-lait’ patches, and endocrine abnormalities (Cushing’s,
thyroid, precocious puberty).
• There is genetic mosaicism given the mutation in FD and McCune–Albright
syndrome is somatic in origin. The degree of extent of pathology and severity
therefore depends on the stage of development at which the postzygotic
somatic mutation occurred.
• When the mutation occurs at an early post-zygotic development stage, the
condition is more severe (a germline GNAS1 mutation would be lethal).
• FD bone lesions grow under the influence of growth hormone (/IGF-1) and
may stop growing at skeletal maturity, but need monitoring.
• Any FD bone lesion can produce FGF23 and mild hypophosphataemia is not
uncommon and additional osteomalacia can result.
• Bone pain is common and difficult to treat.
• Bone pain is sometimes severe and its cause unexplained.
• Pain can be treated with serial IV pamidronate infusions. Dose regimens vary
and options have not been systematically studied.

[SECTION]• Some FD lesions do not cause symptoms though can cause complications such
as fracture, neural compromise (expansion of bone adjacent to a nerve canal),
or bone collapse depending on their site. Fracture healing does not appear to
be compromised however.

Sclerosing bone disorders
Sclerosing bone disorders comprise those affecting cortical bone (hyperostotic)
and those affecting trabecular bone (osteosclerotic).
• There are many sclerosing bone disorders.5 The most common are dealt with
here but see also Table 16.13.
Osteopetrosis
Is a term that defines a range of osteoscleroses (‘the osteopetroses’).
• The osteopetroses are caused by one of a number of genetic abnormalities
which result in functional deficit (mostly regulation of acidification) in
osteoclastic bone resorption (e.g. CLCN7, GL, CA II (causes carbonic
anhydrase II deficiency)).
• AD and AR forms exist—the former lethal in childhood unless treated—the
latter often benign and presents later in life. (See http://www.omim.org for a
comprehensive review of genetics.)
• Diagnosis is made on radiographs where the effects of osteoclast failure during
endochondral bone formation result in ‘islands’ or ‘bars’ of calcified cartilage
within trabecular bone.
• HLA identical bone marrow transplant has been very effective for some
infantile forms of osteopetrosis.
Camurati–Engelmann disease (CED) and Ribbing disease (RD)
• CED and RD are manifest by slowly evolving long bone hyperostosis in
children and adolescents (CED) and in adolescents and young adults (RD).
• Bone sclerosis may be driven by release of active TGF-β from bone matrix
which drives the development and activity of osteoblasts.
• CED is likely a consequence of one or a number of germline mutation in the
TGF-β gene or peptides which regulate TGF-β activation.
• It is unclear whether RD is similar but with variable penetrance or whether
there are acquired systemic factors that can, similar to the functional effect in

[SECTION]CED, ‘switch on’ TGF-β activity.
Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA)
• HOA is a familial disorder characterized by digital clubbing, hyperhidrosis,
facial skin thickening, and long bone hyperostosis.
• There are variable features of pachydermia, delayed closure of the fontanelles,
and congenital heart disease.
• The AD form (pachydermoperiostosis) is very rare and the genetic cause
unknown. AR primary hypertrophic osteoathropathy-1 (PHOAR1) is caused
by a homozygous mutation in the HPGD gene on chromosome 4q34.1.
Pulmonary (secondary) hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HPOA)
• HPOA differs from HOA and is characterized by digital clubbing secondary to
acquired diseases, most commonly intrathoracic neoplasm.
Endosteal hyperostosis
The process of sclerosis characterizes two conditions: Van Buchem disease and
sclerosteosis.
• Both diseases are autosomal recessive and are caused by mutations in the
SOST gene, which encodes for sclerostin.
• A loss of function in sclerostin results in de-suppression of osteoblast
differentiation and function thus causing generalized bone sclerosis and
hyperostosis.
• The diseases have informed the development of a therapeutic inhibitor of
sclerostin to treat osteoporosis.
Osteopoikilosis
Is a benign condition often disclosed incidentally on radiographs (‘spotted
bones’).
• Occasionally the condition is associated with the occurrence of connective
tissue nevi and dermatofibrosis (Buschke–Ollendorf syndrome) and
melorheostosis.
Hepatitis C osteosclerosis
Hepatitis C can be associated with severe generalized osteosclerosis (craniumsparing).
• Remodelling of good quality excessive bone seems accelerated during active
disease, though it will respond to anti-resorption treatment and gradual
spontaneous remission can occur.
• The condition may be caused by effects of IGF as there are increases in IGF
binding protein (‘big IGF2’).

Bone tumours
Primary tumours of bones and joints are rare, have a peak incidence in childhood
and adolescence, and can be benign or malignant. Paget’s disease accounts for
most cases of osteosarcoma occurring >40 years of age.

[SECTION]Osteoid osteoma
An osteoid osteoma (OO) is a benign osteoid-forming tumour that can be an
elusive cause of intense focal bone pain in children or adults.
• OOs are uncommon and accounts for 10% of benign bone neoplasia.
• OOs are 2–3× more common in men than women and the incidence is highest
in the second and third decades of life; >66% occur in long bones and
especially the femur and tibia.
• OO lesions are identified on radiographs (or more commonly CT) as a welldefined area of sclerosis with radiolucent nidus often containing speckles of
calcium.
• 99mTc MDP scintigraphy is a sensitive method of isolating a lesion and CT is
valuable for localizing the nidus before surgical resection.
• Pain will respond, in part, to aspirin or NSAIDs. Provided the nidus is
completely resected, surgery is curative.
Osteosarcoma
This is a rare tumour with an incidence of 0.6–0.9 per 100,000 population. It is
the commonest primary bone tumour.
• Most patients present at <30 years of age.
• The presentation is with local pain and swelling.
• Radiographs show expansion of the bone with a surrounding soft tissue mass,
often containing islands of calcification.
• MRI or CT should be arranged to determine the extent of tumour.
• Patients suspected to have osteosarcoma should be referred to a specialist team
for biopsy.
• Treatment depends on histology but generally involves surgical removal of the
tumour (and often radical field surgery including amputation), followed by
chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
• The prognosis is generally good in cases that present in childhood and
adolescence, but poor in elderly patients with osteosarcoma related to Paget’s
disease of bone.
Chondrosarcoma
• This is the second most common primary bone tumour. Presentation is similar
to osteosarcoma. Treatment choice is between surgical resection and
radiotherapy. Chondrosarcomas are relatively resistant to chemotherapy. The
prognosis is good for low-grade tumours but poor for anaplastic tumours.

Septic arthritis
Septic arthritis caused by a bacterium is a medical emergency. See also
Chapter 25, p. 708 for management in adults and children.
Epidemiology
Incidence in the general population is 2–10 per 100,000 and rising to 30–70 per
100,000 in those with autoimmune rheumatic disease or prosthetic joint
replacements.
Pathology
• Most cases are due to haematogenous seeding during transient bacteraemia,
but septic arthritis can also be caused by direct penetration through the skin, or
by local spread from a contiguous infected site.
• Joints damaged by chronic arthritis (e.g. RA and OA) and prosthetic joints are
at increased risk of infection.
• Risk factors include advancing age (>80 years), recent joint surgery, IV drug
use, alcoholism, previous intra-articular steroid injection, immunodeficiency
states, CKD3b-5, and diabetes.
• The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA),
Streptococcus spp., and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in adults.
• The clinical features and natural history of gonococcal and non-gonococcal
arthritis are sufficiently distinct to discuss them separately (Table 17.3).
• Gram-negative bacilli may be involved in patients with a current history of IV
drug abuse, or those who are immunosuppressed.
• Salmonella is a common cause of septic arthritis among patients with sickle
cell disease, although Staph. aureus remains the most common organism in
this group.
Presentation

[SECTION]• The most commonly affected joint is the knee (>50%).
• Wrists, ankles, and hips are also commonly involved.
• Intravenous drug users (IVDUs) are predisposed to septic arthritis involving
the axial joints, e.g. sternoclavicular joint.
• Transient synovitis, particularly of the hip, is not uncommon in children, and
generally occurs in the setting after upper respiratory tract infection.
• Patients with septic arthritis usually present with joint pain, swelling, and
restricted range of movement of the affected joint(s). Most patients are febrile;
however, the elderly do not always show a systemic response.
Investigation
Every attempt should be made to undertake joint aspiration prior to starting
antibiotics.
• The aspirate should be sent for Gram stain, cell count and differential,
microscopy, culture, and sensitivity, and blood cultures.
• A fluid sample should be analysed with polarized light microscopy for
crystals.
• Depending on likely source of infection, skin, oral, and genital swabs should
be considered.
• For a septic joint, the leucocyte count (predominantly neutrophils) in the
aspirate is usually > 50,000 cells/mm3.
• Routine blood tests should be done: FBC, ESR, CRP, renal function, and liver
function tests.
• Plain radiographs are a useful baseline investigation for assessing for
osteomyelitis or alternative pathology. In untreated septic arthritis, patchy
lucencies in periarticular bone and evidence of articular cartilage loss (joint
space narrowing) can be seen.
• US can confirm a joint effusion and aid diagnostic aspiration of small joints.
• If osteomyelitis is suspected, MRI is the investigation of choice.
Management
See also Chapter 25.
Three principles determine outcome: (i) prompt diagnosis; (ii) immediate
institution of appropriate antibiotics; and (iii) adequate joint drainage.
• The joint should be aspirated to dryness.
• Surgical drainage/washout, or daily arthrocentesis may be required.
• An affected joint should be rested and non-weight-bearing until the
inflammation and pain have subsided enough to allow passive mobilization.
Mobilization should be encouraged as soon as possible.

[SECTION]• Empiric therapy should be started while awaiting culture results. See local
guidelines, but common regimens include flucloxacillin 2 g IV four times a
day ± gentamicin IV, or an oral third-generation cephalosporin.
• In cases of suspected MRSA infection, discussion with a microbiologist and
consideration of vancomycin is advised.
• Pseudomonas spp. should be suspected in IVDUs.
• IV antibiotics are usually continued for 2 weeks followed by 4 weeks of oral
antibiotics. Prolonged courses of up to 6 weeks of IV antibiotics may be
required in severe cases until swelling subsides, inflammatory markers
normalize, and cultures become negative.
• There are no studies comparing long and short courses of antibiotics.
• Infection of a prosthetic joint is a challenging surgical problem, and the
management should only be undertaken by specialist arthroplasty surgeons,
ideally as part of a prosthetic joint infection MDT.
• Infection of a prosthesis soon after surgery or within a short period following a
bacteraemic episode can sometimes be managed with prosthesis retention, but
often revision of the prosthesis is required.
• Prosthesis revision is either a single operation or done in a staged manner, with
an interval period during which an antibiotic impregnated cement spacer
replaces the prosthesis.
• A joint should not be injected with glucocorticoid (GC) if intra-articular
infection is suspected, or if there is superficial infection over the skin covering
a joint (e.g. cellulitis or psoriasis).
• There is no benefit from intra-articular antibiotics. Indeed, antibiotics can
cause a chemical synovitis.
Septic bursitis
The two most common sites are the olecranon and prepatellar bursae.
• Septic bursitis should be managed with serial fluid aspiration and oral
antibiotics.
• Non-responders will need IV antibiotics, and will probably need surgical
incision and drainage.
• Chronically infected bursitis can lead to osteomyelitis.
Gonococcal arthritis
Gonococcal arthritis is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoea.
• May present as an acute monoarthritis but is more commonly a migratory
polyarthritis with tenosynovitis and dermatitis.
• The polyarthritis is usually asymmetric.

[SECTION]• Patients are usually afebrile.
• Investigations should include synovial fluid analysis, blood cultures,
skin/urethral/rectal/pharyngeal cultures.
• If patients are found to have gonococcal infection they should be tested for
other sexually transmitted infections.
• There is increasing resistance, including multidrug resistance, of N.
gonorrhoea to a wide range of antibiotics.
• Treatment should be guided by local policies but a common regimen is
ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV every 24 hours, with a single dose of azithromycin 1
g orally for potential Chlamydia trachomatis co-infection. An oral switch can
be considered after 24–48 hours when clinical improvement is seen. Treatment
should continue for 7 days.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Epidemiology
• Until 1985, the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the USA and Europe
declined. More recently, the recurrence of TB has become an important
complication of new biologic DMARDs.
• It is thought that 30% of the world’s population is infected with TB.
• In industrialized countries, <5% of cases of TB develop infection of bone or
joints.
Pathology
• TB can affect any MSK structure.
• Predisposing factors for MSK TB infection include pre-existing arthritis,
alcoholism, use of GCs, and immunosuppression.
Presentation
• TB of bone is usually a low-grade and slowly progressive infection associated
with a variable degree of local and systemic symptoms, such as fatigue, weight
loss, or night sweats.
• Onset is insidious and usually mono-articular or monostotic.
• The spine is the commonest site, whether within a vertebral body (Pott’s
disease), disc, or a paravertebral abscess.
• Spinal cord compression due to vertebral destruction and/or soft tissue
swelling due to an abscess is a serious complication and must be treated
urgently.
• Spinal stabilization procedures carry a good prognosis in preventing
neurological sequelae.
• Monoarticular disease is seen most often in weight-bearing joints (hip, knee,
ankle, sacroiliac joint—in order). The wrist and shoulder are less commonly
affected.
• Osteomyelitis may affect any long bone and is associated with either solitary
or multifocal cysts.
• In TB arthritis, typical features of septic arthritis (e.g. warmth and erythema)

[SECTION]are often absent.
Investigation
• The diagnosis of TB is made by identifying acid-fast bacilli from a lesion or
by histopathological changes in excised tissue.
• Synovial fluid analysis is not usually diagnostic and a synovial tissue biopsy
may be required.
• A high level of clinical suspicion, in the absence of other identified pathology,
might lead the clinician to treat empirically.
Management
• Standard anti-TB regimens should be used for prophylaxis or treatment, and
surveillance for 1 year after treatment is recommended.
• Treatment is usually continued for 6–9 months, or 9–12 months for more
advanced disease.
• Surgical intervention may be necessary—tissue biopsy, debridement of
necrotic tissue, or stabilization of a joint or long bone.
• Owing to an association between biologics therapy (particularly anti-TNFα)
and disseminated TB, the identification of latent TB has become increasingly
important in patients being treated for chronic arthritis.
• In such patients, a tuberculin skin test (PPD) is useful. Induration of >5 mm
should be considered positive in patients who are immunosuppressed.
• Quantiferon-TB gold, which is a blood-based IFNγ release assay, is also useful
for the diagnosis of latent TB.
Atypical mycobacterial infections
• Patients with autoimmune rheumatic or connective tissue diseases who are
taking immunosuppressant medications are at risk of developing atypical
infections.
• These infections are usually chronic in nature and can mimic an inflammatory
flare of rheumatic disease, thus making a diagnosis can be difficult.
• Atypical infections should be considered in patients with autoimmune diseases
who present with MSK symptoms that do not respond to conservative
treatment.
• Mycobacterium malmoense has been described causing tenosynovitis and
septic arthritis of the knee.
• M. avium complex and M. chelonae osteoarticular infections have also been
described.

[SECTION]Osteomyelitis
Osteomyelitis refers to any infection involving bone or bone marrow.
Pathology
• Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of osteomyelitis. Other
important pathogens to consider, particularly in the immunosuppressed patient,
are TB, Pseudomonas, and Salmonella.
• The long bones are most commonly affected in children, and the vertebrae in
adults.
Investigations
• No single laboratory investigation is reliable enough to be used routinely for
the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. An elevated white cell count and ESR may not
be seen.
• Imaging is important in establishing the diagnosis. Which imaging technique
is successful at identifying osteomyelitis depends partly on the stage of the
infective process.
• Once the pathogen has reached bone, a suppurative reaction and marrow
oedema occurs. This can be seen using MRI.
• The next stage—vascular congestion, ischaemia, thrombosis, and soft tissue
swelling—is readily detected by CT. After 2–3 weeks, bone reaction including
new periosteal bone formation and decalcification can be seen on radiographs.
• Radiographs should be requested as routine as they provide a point of
reference, and assess for other disease.
• Vertebral osteomyelitis is often seen early on radiographs. There may be
erosion of the vertebral body or disc, and paravertebral abscesses and vertebral
collapse are common complications.
• Bone scintigraphy can help localize an area of abnormality. 99mTcbisphosphonate scans, however, are not specific and the negative predictive
value is often greater than the positive predictive value.
• 111In-labelled leucocyte scintigraphy is an alternative.
• Bone biopsy is the gold standard investigation to confirm location of infection,
identify specific organisms, to inform treatment choices.
Management
Several general, local, and systemic factors need to be considered in the
management of osteomyelitis (Table 17.4).
• Initial treatment in the acute phase is the same as that for septic monoarthritis.
In general, antibiotics are needed for 6 weeks, although chronic infection may

require long-term (>3 months) low-dose treatment.
Antibiotic choice should be guided by tissue microscopy and culture results
and local antibiotic therapy policy.
Surgery may be required early in the acute phase especially if there is an
abscess or spinal involvement with neurological compromise.
Chronic osteomyelitis implies that dead bone is present, and will require
surgical debridement.
Hyperbaric oxygen has also been used successfully in the treatment of air
embolism, osteonecrosis, myonecrosis, and burns patients with infection.

Factors Examples
General Age: neonates tend to harbour S. aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and
β-haemolytic streptococci. In children >4 yrs, H. influenzae is
common, and in adults S. aureus.
Bone: long bones (especially lower limb) are more susceptible
than short bones to infection. Pelvic and cranial bones are
infrequently involved

Lyme disease
Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by the spirochaetes Borrelia
burgdorferi, B. afzeli, and B. garinii.
Epidemiology
• All three spirochaetes are found in Europe but Borrelia burgdorferi is the only
species identified in cases of Lyme disease in the USA.
• Cases of Lyme disease have been reported from most states in the USA, as
well as throughout Europe, China, and Japan.
• Highest incidence is in children <15 years and middle-aged adults.
• Seasonal variation: common in the summer months of June and July.
• The tick vector Ixodes is found on rodents, boar or deer—animals inhabiting
wooded, brush, or grassy areas.
• A history of potential exposure in an endemic country within the last 30 days
is an important fact to establish in considering the diagnosis.
Presentation
• The diagnosis is made on epidemiological history and presenting features
(Table 17.5), and is confirmed with laboratory tests.
• A clear history of a tick bite is not necessary to make the diagnosis.
Investigations
• Diagnosis is made by either isolation of the spirochaete from tissue or body
fluid or detection of diagnostic levels of IgM or IgG antibodies in the serum or
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and changes in antibody levels between acute-phase
and convalescent paired sera.
• False-positive results occur in other infections (e.g. syphilis), RA, and SLE.
• Western blotting is available as a confirmatory test, distinguishing between
true seroreactivity and false-positive serology.
• If the serological status is negative, then the diagnosis is unlikely and an
alternative diagnosis should be sought.
Management
The management of Lyme disease is primarily with antibiotics with choice of
therapy varying depending on organ affected.
• Erythema migrans is treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 3 weeks,

[SECTION]or with cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily for 3 weeks.
• Septic arthritis is treated similarly but antibiotic treatment may need to be
continued for 30 days.
• The choice of antibiotics for neurological or cardiac disease includes IV
penicillin, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone/imipenem.
• Lyme disease can cause a post-infective inflammatory (‘reactive’) arthritis
which is typical migratory (differential: sarcoid, post-streptococcal,
palindromic RA).

Skin

Erythema migrans (EM): begins as a red macule/papule
expanding, over days or weeks, to become a large round

measures 5 cm or more. There may be smaller secondary
lesions*
An expanding lesion is often accompanied by general

defects often associated with myocarditis. Resolves in days
to weeks.
Carditis—rare and remits spontaneously

* A similar lesion occurring within hours of a tick bite is usually a hypersensitivity reaction and does not
qualify as EM.

Rheumatic fever
Rheumatic fever is a delayed, non-suppurative sequelae to a pharyngeal
infection with Lancefield group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus.
Epidemiology
• Although there has been a dramatic decline in incidence in Europe and the
USA, rheumatic fever still occurs, and remains common in developing
countries.
• There are an estimated 10–20 million cases per year worldwide, with an
annual incidence of 100–200 per 100,000 of the population.
Pathology
• Associations have been described with HLA-DR2, -DR3, and -DR4.
Presentation
• There is a latent period of 2–3 weeks after transmission before the appearance
of the illness.
• A symptomatic pharyngitis is seen in 60% of cases.
• Patients can present with migratory arthritis (typically of the large joints),
myocarditis, or valvulitis, though with chorea is unlikely.
• Diagnosis follows the revised ‘Jones’ criteria (Table 17.6)
• Patients who have had previous acute rheumatic fever are at risk of repeat
episodes following reinfection with group A β-haemolytic streptococci. In
repeat episodes, 2 major, or 1 major and 2 minor or 3 minor criteria are
sufficient for diagnosis.
Arthritis
Joint involvement is more common and often more severe in teenagers and
young adults.
• Arthritis tends to start in the large weight-bearing joints and tends to occur
early. The pain can be severe. Often there is an absence of objective signs of
inflammation. It lasts 2–3 weeks and is self-limiting.

[SECTION]• NSAIDs are the recommended first-line treatment.
• Discriminating post-streptococcal reactive arthritis (seen in the absence of
carditis) from rheumatic fever can be difficult. Most patients will fulfil the
Jones criteria and, therefore, should be considered as having rheumatic fever.
Cardiac disease
• Rheumatic heart disease is the most severe outcome of acute rheumatic fever.
It remains the major cause of acquired valvular heart disease in the world.
• Rheumatic heart disease usually occurs 10–20 years after the initial infection.
The mitral valve (stenosis) is most frequently involved.
• When left untreated, cardiomegaly and cardiac failure secondary to valvular
disease may ensue.
• Carditis may also occur and is associated with cardiomyopathy and conduction
defects including second- or third-degree heart block.

ASO, anti-streptolysin O antibodies. Titres peak at about 4 weeks, which is about 2 weeks into the
clinical illness then titres fall rapidly over the following 2–3 months.

Chorea
• Sydenham’s chorea (St Vitus’ dance) consists of abrupt, purposeless
movements, muscle weakness, and emotional disturbance.
• The hands and face are usually the most obviously affected parts. The
movements are not present during sleep, but do occur at rest and may be more
marked on one side of the body.
• Chorea may be the sole feature suggesting rheumatic fever (beyond observing
new cardiac murmurs) and may occur weeks to months after onset of an
arthropathy.
Skin
• Subcutaneous nodules of rheumatic fever are firm and painless. They range
from a few mm to 2 cm in size. They are located over bony surfaces or near
tendons. Lesions are present for 2–4 weeks only, and more often in patients
with carditis.
• Erythema marginatum is an evanescent, non-purpuric rash, usually affecting
the trunk and proximal part of the limbs, but sparing the face. Because the rash
often appears to make a ring, it is also called ‘erythema annulare’. The lesions
come and go in a matter of hours, heat can make them appear worse, and they
are more common in association with carditis. They resolve spontaneously.
• Erythema nodosum is rare.
Investigation
• There is no diagnostic test.
• Diagnosis is based on detection of group A streptococcal infection followed by
the typical clinical manifestations.
• Raised inflammatory markers and mild anaemia are often seen.
• Serial rises in ASO antibody (or anti-DNAaseB) titres may be seen if
measured every 14 days.
• CXR and ECG to look for conduction defects/cardiomegaly.
Management
• The three goals of management include symptomatic relief, eradication of
group A β-haemolytic streptococci, and prophylaxis against future infection
with group A β-haemolytic streptococci.
• NSAIDs should be given until all symptoms have resolved.
• Heart failure should be treated with conventional medications.

[SECTION]• Penicillin is given for 10 days, even in the absence of pharyngitis.
• Chorea is treated with haloperidol 1–2 mg/kg/day. GCs are sometimes also
given, though there is little evidence of added benefit.
• Recurrence can occur within the first 2 years. However, recurrence rates are
low, and the risk of recurrence declines with age of first attack. Recurrence is
associated with increased risk of cardiac disease.
• Prophylaxis should be started as soon as antibiotic treatment has finished with
oral phenoxymethylpenicillin or benzylpenicillin 1.2 million units IM every 3–
4 weeks. Duration of prophylaxis depends on severity of disease.
Erythromycin 250 mg daily can be used in patients allergic to penicillin.

Rare autoinflammatory diseases
Introduction
Rare autoinflammatory diseases (RAIDs) are mostly rare monogenic
immunological disorders that typically present in childhood with recurrent
fevers, high inflammatory markers, and systemic features.
• The typical presentation is with bouts of fever, and associated symptoms
between which the patient is well (‘periodic’ fever).
• The term ‘autoinflammatory’ arose from the understanding that gene
mutations result in switching on of innate immunity that has a secondary effect
on adaptive immunity. This differs from autoimmunity where failure of
recognition between self and non-self is caused by self-reactive T cells,
involves MHC class II and leads to circulating antibodies.
• Since the discovery of the gene for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF),
MEFV (pyrin innate immunity regulator), the genes of many other RAIDs
have been identified and collectively have proven extremely valuable in

[SECTION]understanding inflammatory pathways.
• Although RAIDs are not generally life-threatening, early diagnosis may avoid
repeated hospital visits, unnecessary investigations and treatment, reduced
quality of life, and morbidity from AA amyloid.
Pathogenesis
• RAIDs are disorders of the innate immune system. Innate immunity is the first
line of defence against pathogenic microbes and mediates host responses
against cellular stress (e.g. against lipopolysaccharide or peptidoglycan
constituents).
• Highly conserved molecular processes, known as pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs), are detected by intracellular pattern-recognition
receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), which are expressed by
macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes.
• PRR signalling drives (the ‘inflammasome’) cytokine production such as
interleukin-1β (IL-1β).
• Genotype-influenced inflammasome function can cause RAIDs and contribute
to other diseases (e.g. NOD2 mutations can causes Blau syndrome and
contribute to IBD phenotype also).
Epidemiology
• FMF, the commonest RAID, has a carrier frequency in Middle Eastern
populations of 30–50%.
• Fewer than 200 families have been reported with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and there are 100 reported
cases of familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle–Wells
syndrome (MWS).
• As an example of other RAIDs, there are fewer than 10 families reported to
have Majeed syndrome, mostly arising from Jordan.

Approach to diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, mostly in children, at times of recurrent
fevers or multisystem inflammation of unknown aetiology.
• Treatable causes of fever such as infection, neoplasia, and autoimmune
diseases should be excluded.
• Family history, ethnicity, age of onset of fever, especially within first year of
life, characterization of the fever, and rash and manifestations are important
clues to diagnosis with RAIDs.
• Characterization of the fever includes its duration and periodicity. This also
helps to understand the burden of disease on quality of life.
• High inflammatory markers and a neutrophilia are typical during febrile
episodes and normalize during disease-free intervals.
• Associated features also include abdominal or limb pain and:
• Diarrhoea—present in 75% of cases with MVK deficiency.
• Uveitis.
• Sensorineural hearing loss.
• Inflammatory episodes provoked by vaccination.
• Arthritis.
• Confirmation of a RAID can be sought with genetic testing; however, >50% of
RAID patients have negative genetic results.
• In the UK, genetic testing is undertaken by the National Amyloidosis centre at
University College Hospital, London ( http://www.ucl.ac.uk/amyloidosis).
• Information about the latest genetic abnormalities is available on the In-Fever
website at http://http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/ISSAID/infevers/.
• Urinalysis should be requested to screen for proteinuria which raises the
possibility of secondary AA amyloidosis.
Cutaneous manifestations of RAIDs
• Urticarial eruptions—typical of patients with the cryopyrinopathies—are often
indistinguishable from the more common mast cell-mediated chronic urticaria.
The latter is usually asymmetric with itchy recurrent wheal and flare and
angio-oedema.

[SECTION]• Urticarial vasculitis, which is fixed in shape for >24 hours and also seen in
cryopyrinopathies.
• Multiple sterile abscesses—seen in pyoderma gangrenosum, acne and
pyogenic arthritis (PAPA) syndrome, SAPHO syndrome, Majeed syndrome,
DIRA, early-onset IBD, and several other RAIDs.
• Psoriaform rashes: seen in congenital forms of psoriasis (e.g. CAMPS) and
pustular skin lesions as in SAPHO syndrome.
• Ichthyosiform rash: tan-coloured and scaly is seen in ~90% of patients with
Blau syndrome.
RAID presentations
RAIDs might be considered in a differential diagnosis on the basis of age of
presentation, familial inheritance (see Table 18.1), and typical clinical features
common to certain groupings of RAIDs.
Neonatal and infantile periodic fevers
• A RAID is considered in infancy when a fever is unresponsive to antibiotics or
recurrent, when an associated rash is persistent or unusual, and there are
atypical features, such as bone oedema.
• Alternative diagnoses for consideration include neonatal lupus (NLE; see
Chapter 10), Kawasaki disease, Behçet’s disease, and systemic-onset JIA.
• A RAID in the first year of life includes:
• chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA), a
cryopyrinopathy also known in the USA as NOMID (neonatal-onset
multisystem inflammatory disease).
• FCAS.
• Majeed syndrome.
• deficiency of IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA).
• Blau syndrome.
• chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated
temperature (CANDLE).
Childhood periodic fevers (cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes)
CAPS are a group of autosomal dominant RAIDs that share the same gene
mutation (NLRP3) but present at different ages with variations of phenotype that
includes an urticarial rash.
• NLRP3 gene encodes the protein cryopyrin. Cryopyrin is a key component of
the inflammasome (an intracellular multi-protein complex), which regulates
the processing of IL-1β.
• CAPS result in excess IL-1β and respond to anti-IL-1 therapy (anakinra,

[SECTION]•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•

canakinumab, and rilonacept).
AA amyloidosis occurs in ~25% generally in all CAPS.
In CINCA, fevers are usually short lived, low grade, or absent.
Typical features in CINCA are frontal bossing, saddle nose, midface
hypoplasia; arthritis and bony overgrowth of knees, hands and feet, clubbing,
CNS and ophthalmic involvement.
Radiographs in CINCA may show irregular ossification of metaphyses and
epiphyses.
FCAS is also known as familial cold urticaria and associated with low-grade
fever and arthralgia. It presents within the first 6 months of life.
Typically in FCAS, cold precipitates symptoms within 1–2 hours and attacks
last <24 hours.
MWS typically presents in an older child with high fever, typically in the
afternoon.
In MWS, fever attacks last 1–2 days although the rash can be persistent and
sensorineural deafness is common usually appearing in childhood or even
early adulthood.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)
FMF is most common in non-Ashkenazi Jews, Arabs, Turks, and Armenians as a
result of a mutation in the gene which encodes pyrin. Pyrin is expressed in
myeloid cells and regulates the inflammasome.
• Diagnosis is based on the presence of:
• short, intense, self-limiting episodes of fever (1–3 days) with a leucocytosis
and high ESR.
• serositis (peritonitis and less commonly pericarditis or pleuritis).
• comprehensive response to oral colchicine, which achieves remission in
65% of patients and 20–30% experience a reduction in the severity and
number of fever attacks.
• Less common features include large joint lower limb arthritis, meningitis
headache, orchitis, vasculitic rash, and myalgia.
• Genetic analysis is not always helpful.
• The recommended dose of colchicine is 0.5 mg/day for children <5 years of
age, 1 mg/day for children 5–10 years, and 1.5 mg/day for children >10 years.
Doses are titrated upwards for lack of efficacy and downwards for abdominal
pain/diarrhoea in 0.25 mg steps (max. 2 mg/day). Colchicine virtually
eliminates the risk of AA amyloid.
• Anti-IL-1 (e.g. anakinra) may be effective in colchicine-resistant FMF
patients.

[SECTION]TNF receptor-associated periodic syndromes (TRAPS)
Previously known as Hibernian fever, TRAPS affects 1 per million in Europe
and is caused by mutations in the p55 TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). 50% have no
family history.
• Presentation is often by 4 years with prolonged, although milder, periodic
fevers, lasting 1–3 weeks. In 30%, symptoms are almost continuous. Fever is
always associated with high ESR.
• Common features are myoarthralgia, tender macular rash on the extremes
and/or torso, and abdominal pain, headache, pleuritic pain, conjunctivitis,
periorbital oedema, and lymphadenopathy.
• Genotyping is helpful but two polymorphisms are present in 4% of the normal
population (and may be associated with mild symptoms).
• Acute flares are treated with glucocorticoids (GCs) and flares best prevented
with anakinra or canakinumab. Etanercept (not infliximab) may be effective.
• Without effective long-term treatment 25% develop AA amyloid.
Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD; mevalonic aciduria (MVA) / hyper-IgD
syndrome (HIDS))
• The condition(s) was first identified in 1984 in six patients of Dutch ancestry
with a long history of recurrent attacks of fever and high serum IgD levels.
• An AR condition, mutations in the mevalonate kinase (MVK) gene result in a
deficiency of mevalonate kinase, essential in cholesterol biosynthesis.
Complete absence of MVK activity results in mevalonic aciduria (MVA)
associated with developmental delay, progressive ataxia, visual loss, and
failure to thrive.
• MKD starts in early childhood and presents with fevers lasting 3–7 days.
• Characteristically the condition is precipitated by vaccination.
• Other features include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, lymphadenopathy,
arthralgia, aphthous ulcers, and polymorphic rash.
• Diagnosis is supported by an IgD concentration >100 IU/mL during/between
attacks and increased urine mevalonic acid during fever.
• MVK gene molecular analysis is used to confirm the diagnosis.
• Treatment is symptomatic during a flare which may also respond favourably to
GCs. There may be a role in treatment for inhibitors of IL-1 or TNFα.
• Symptoms improve with age and AA amyloidosis is rare.
Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome
PFAPA syndrome is included here as it is the commonest syndrome associated
with recurrent fever, although it is not a RAID.

[SECTION]• It is defined by debilitating episodes of abrupt onset of fever lasting 3–6 days
with recurrence every 2–6 weeks.
• Other features include sore throat, small mouth or lip ulcers, tender swelling of
the cervical lymph nodes.
• The syndrome usually presents before the age of 5 years and spontaneously
resolves during the second decade of life.
• CRP/ESR and neutrophils are elevated during attacks and normal (or settle)
between them.
• 1–2 days of prednisolone (1–2 mg/kg) may be given at the start of an attack,
which may be prevented by colchicine, anti-IL-1 therapy, or even cimetidine
in some cases.
Late-onset FMF
This form of FMF is a milder variant of the condition in children.
• It occurs typically in men and with abdominal attacks.
• Chronic manifestations (e.g. amyloid) rarely occur.
Late-onset TRAPS
Of all patients with TRAPS, 9% present in adulthood with mean age of onset of
35 years and a similar phenotype to paediatric onset.
Schnitzler’s syndrome
Very rare and usually from 50 years of age with urticarial rash and fatigue.
When diagnosis is unclear
There is considerable overlap in features of the inherited periodic fevers making
diagnosis challenging.
• In some cases genetic analysis is inconclusive. This may be because of a single
mutation in an AR disorder or identification of variants of unknown
significance (e.g. low-penetrance mutations, functional polymorphisms, and
novel variants of unknown functional impact).
• As a guide to diagnosis in general, the Eurofever Project has produced a
validated evidence-based tool (Table 18.2).

with suspected RAIDs after careful exclusion of other causes.

RAIDs with prominent skin manifestations
Pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and pyogenic arthritis (PAPA) syndrome
PAPA syndrome is characterized by multiple sterile abscesses or pyoderma with
severe cystic acne and painful hot arthritis.
• PAPA is attributable to mutations of the PTSTPIP1 gene that encodes a protein
which interacts with pyrin.
• PAPA may be responsive to anti-TNFα or IL-1 blockade.
Deficiency of IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA)
DIRA presents in the neonatal period with a pustular rash, arthritis, periostitis,
and osteolytic lesions of ribs and long bones. An excellent response to IL-1
inhibition (e.g. anakinra) is seen.
Chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated
temperature (CANDLE) syndrome
CANDLE syndrome is AR with increased IFN-γ expression. It appears to be
responsive to drugs inhibiting Janus kinases (JAKs), which mediate IFN-γ
signalling.
Blau syndrome
Blau syndrome is an AD RAID characterized by a tan-coloured ichthyosiform
rash (90%) and non-caseating granulomas. Blau syndrome is indistinguishable
from sarcoid, similarly affecting the joints, skin, and uveal tract.
CARD14-mediated psoriasis (CAMPS)
In CAMPs, severe generalized pustular psoriasis presents before 3 years of age.
Fevers are uncommon however.

Behçet’s disease
Epidemiology and pathophysiology
Behçet’s disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown
aetiology. It is most common in the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, and
Asia.
• Prevalence is estimated at 80–370 cases/100,000 in Turkey.
• The usual onset of the disorder is in the third to fourth decades. Onset is rare
before puberty or after the sixth decade.
• The M:F ratio is equal, but the disease tends to run a more severe course in
men and the young.
• Patients from Eastern Asia, Middle East, and Mediterranean countries show a
higher prevalence of HLA-B51; In Israelis there is an association with HLAB52, and in the UK HLA-B57.
• BD is considered to have a strong angiopathic basis and considerable
morbidity overall is caused by thrombosis in addition to inflammation.
• Mild anaemia of chronic disease and neutrophilia is seen in 15% of patients.
ESR and CRP are often only moderately raised with episodes of arthritis,
erythema nodosum (EN) and thrombophlebitis.
• Autoantibodies are characteristically absent (i.e. ANCA negative).
Clinical features and their management
Full-blown BD might be easy to identify, but there are conditions that mimic the
incomplete picture, including reactive arthritis, antiphospholipid syndrome
(APS), multiple sclerosis, IBD, erythema multiforme, and neutrophilic
dermatoses. The International Study Group (ISG) criteria published in 1990 are
the most widely accepted diagnostic and classification criteria (see
Table
18.3). For clinical manifestation frequencies, see Table 18.4.
Skin and mucosal involvement
• Skin lesions may be nodular (like EN), acneiform, or vasculitic.
• The pathergy reaction, a hyper-reactivity of the skin to a needle prick, is a
nonspecific phenomenon, but may be helpful in diagnosis of BD (note: also
positive in IBD and Sweet’s Syndrome). After skin puncture with a needle, a
papule or pustule forms in 24–72 hours. The reaction is thought to be unusual
in patients from Northern Europe or the United States, but is positive between
60–70% of patients from Japan and Turkey.

[SECTION]• Painful oral aphthous ulcers may precede other features by several years.
Idiopathic oral aphthous ulcers are common, and alone do not imply BD. The
ulcers may resemble ordinary aphthae, but tend to be more frequent and
multiple, and may heal with scarring.
• Genital ulceration in men is most prominent over the scrotum (90%).
Urethritis is not seen unless there is a meatal ulcer. In women, the labia are
commonly affected.

inhalers.
Colchicine 1.5 mg/day (0.5mg tds) can be used to treat frequent attacks of
aphthous ulceration.
More resistant cases may respond to azathioprine (AZA) 2.5 mg/kg/day,
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and/or brief courses of prednisolone 20
mg/day.
Anti-TNFα (etanercept and infliximab) have been shown to be beneficial for
mucocutaneous disease.
Ciclosporin and interferon alfa have been shown to be effective in RCTs.
NSAIDs are frequently used for pain control.
Thalidomide has modest benefits in mucocutaneous BD, but it is difficult to
obtain and carries a significant risk of peripheral neuropathy and
teratogenicity. It is generally reserved for highly resistant disease in patients
who will follow strict contraception.

Eye disease
• Eye disease is a serious complication and a poor prognostic factor.
• It is more common in men, in the <25 years age group, is usually seen during
the first 2 years of having BD, and is bilateral in 70–80%.
• The most frequent eye involvement is chronic relapsing panuveitis. The
presence of a hypopyon occurs in ~20% of patients and is almost always
associated with severe posterior retinal vasculitis. Recurrent bouts of
inflammation result in structural change, and total loss of vision occurs in 20%
of cases despite treatment.
Eye involvement treatment
Topical GC and mydriatics with close supervision may be sufficient in mild
disease, but severe disease requires AZA 2.5 mg/kg/day, ciclosporin, up to 5
mg/kg/day, anti-TNFα therapy (especially infliximab), and cyclophosphamide
(CYC) for refractory cases.
Musculoskeletal involvement
Arthritis or arthralgia is seen in about 50% of patients.
• MSK symptoms may precede the other findings by months or years.
• Arthritis might commonly involve knees, ankles, hands, and wrists, or
occasionally symmetrical. It is usually a self-limiting synovitis, and tends to be
non-erosive and non-deforming.
• Back pain is rare. However, a subgroup of patients have a reactive arthritislike features, presenting with acne, arthritis and enthesopathy (see main
differential: SAPHO syndrome, Chapter 16).

[SECTION]Musculoskeletal involvement treatment
Pain may respond to NSAIDs and colchicine (e.g. 0.5 mg three times a day).
• Inflammatory disease often requires the introduction of AZA 2.5 mg/kg/day.
Other therapies include SSZ 2–3 g/day or MTX 10–20 mg weekly. Infliximab
could also be considered.

Cardiovascular and pulmonary involvement
• BD can affect both arteries and veins. In spite of the thrombotic episodes,
there is a relative absence of embolic phenomena.
• The heart is rarely involved in BD, but may manifest as endocarditis,
myocarditis, pericarditis, coronary vasculitis, and ventricular aneurysms.
Right-sided endomyocardial fibrosis with intracardiac thrombi is an unusual
manifestation that has been observed in young males with widespread vascular

[SECTION]disease.
• Thrombophlebitis occurs in 25% of patients. Lower limb venous thrombosis of
the deep veins is often seen. Occlusion of suprahepatic veins (Budd–Chiari
syndrome) is a rare complication of BD that carries a high death rate.
• Artery involvement (1.5–7.5%) carries significant associated mortality.
Lesions are typically aneurysmal with a risk of rupture, or uncommonly,
occlusive. The abdominal aorta is the most frequently affected resulting in
abdominal pain. Peripheral arterial involvement may result in reduced/absent
pulses with intermittent claudication, cold extremities, or even gangrene.
• The pulmonary pathology of BD is related to arterial vasculitis. Aneurysms,
thromboses, and infarcts are found. Pulmonary embolism is rare despite high
rates of thrombophlebitis.
Cardiovascular and pulmonary involvement treatment
• Aspirin and NSAIDs can be used for phlebitis.
• Aneurysms and arterial occlusion can be treated with endovascular surgery
including intra-arterial embolization if combination immunosuppressants fail
or are considered inappropriate.
• There remains debate as to whether to use heparin or oral anticoagulants for
BD thrombophlebitis. Most physicians will choose to treat with
anticoagulation in addition to immunosuppression. If patients have BDassociated aneurysms, anticoagulation increases the risks of haemorrhage.
Neurological involvement
Neurological involvement is seen in 5% of patients with BD. It usually occurs
after the first 5 years of the disease, and is almost never a presenting feature.
Patterns of involvement are either vascular or parenchymal.
• Parenchymal disease is usually manifested by bilateral pyramidal signs,
unilateral hemiparesis, behavioural changes, and headaches.
• The most commonly affected site is the brainstem and basal ganglia. Cerebral
cortices seem to be spared. Meningeal irritation and dementia may also occur.
As is the case with eye disease, central nervous involvement is often more
severe in men.
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes such as pleocytosis and increased
cellularity occur in 60% of patients with parenchymal involvement.
• MRI is more sensitive than CT for imaging. Signal changes, with contrast
enhancement in the brainstem and basal ganglia regions, occur but are not
specific (consider MS, sarcoid, APS).
• Dural sinus thrombosis is a feature characterized by headache, sixth nerve

[SECTION]palsy, papilloedema, and raised CSF pressure. It has a better prognosis than
parenchymal involvement. An association between dural sinus thrombosis and
deep vein thrombosis exists.
• In contrast to other vasculitides, peripheral neuropathy is unusual.
Neurological involvement treatment
• Thrombosis of the dural sinuses and increased intracranial pressure should be
treated with IV methylprednisolone 1 g for 3–5 days.
• Parenchymal involvement is usually treated with CYC or AZA combined with
GCs.
• A small trial has found MTX may stop the progression of chronic neurological
involvement, but larger studies are needed.
• A few case reports suggest infliximab may be beneficial in refractory
parenchymal disease.
Gastrointestinal involvement and its treatment
• While seen in up to one-third of patients in Japan, gastrointestinal (GI) disease
is rare in patients from the Mediterranean basin.
• The pathology is mucosal ulceration, mostly in ileum and caecum.
• The course is one of relapse and remission, and a tendency for bowel
perforation. It can be difficult to distinguish the findings of GI BD from those
of Crohn’s disease.
• In treating GI BD, ulceration may respond to prednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day,
SSZ 2–3 g/day, or infliximab. AZA is an alternative.
• Surgical evaluation may be necessary to manage severe sequelae.
• Large ulcers, high CRP and perforation are predictors of recurrence.
Renal involvement and its treatment
Renal disease is seen much less than might be expected with systemic vasculitis.
• There are occasional reports of glomerulonephritis, ranging from IgA
nephropathy to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
• Secondary amyloidosis AA usually presents with nephrotic disease, and has
been reported in about 1% of patients.
• Epididymitis is seen in up to 20% of males. Other urological problems include
cystitis and erectile dysfunction.
• Treatment focuses on symptom control. Patients with AA amyloidosis require
therapy for BD.
• Colchicine can be used to treat both BD and amyloidosis.

[SECTION]Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown aetiology, characterized by the
presence of multiple, non-caseating granulomas.
Epidemiology and pathophysiology
• Sarcoidosis is found worldwide but the prevalence, clinical features, and
outcome varies considerably.
• It may present at any age, but prevalence peaks in the 20–40 years age group
with a second peak in women >50 years old.
• It is seen more often in developed vs underdeveloped, Western vs Eastern, and
in Northern vs Southern European countries.
• Sweden and Denmark have prevalence rates of 60 per 100,000, The UK 20 per
100,000. In the USA, sarcoidosis is 10–15× more prevalent in African
American people than in Caucasians, and in this ethnicity, disease is often
severe. Studies have suggested a link between HLA-B8, HLA-DR3, acute
sarcoidosis, and arthritis.
• Granulomata and associated tissue inflammation can occur in virtually any
tissue in the body and can manifest local symptoms alone. Systemic effects are
not always present.
General patterns of disease
Acute sarcoidosis (Lofgren’s syndrome)
• This presents with rapid-onset fever, acute arthritis/arthralgias, EN, and hilar
lymphadenopathy.
• LÖfgren’s syndrome has a high rate of remission and a good prognosis.
• Treatment usually requires NSAIDs only.
• It has been reported to occur in seasonal clusters, especially winter and early
spring, suggesting environmental/infectious triggers.
• The chest radiograph clears within 1 year in 60% of cases.
• Around 15% of patients with LÖfgren’s syndrome have a raised angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) level at presentation.
Chronic sarcoidosis
• Chronic sarcoid is less common than LÖfgren’s syndrome and has an often
subtle, insidious, progressive, and highly variable clinical course. Clinical
manifestations can be extensive (Table 18.5).
• Granulomata can occur in virtually any tissue in the body and can manifest
local symptoms. Systemic effects are not always present.

[SECTION]Early-onset (childhood) sarcoidosis
EOS refers to disease onset in the first 5 years of life and has a clinical
phenotype distinct from adult-onset disease and very similar to Blau syndrome
(see earlier in this chapter).
• A typical presentation is with rash, polyarthritis (typically a ‘boggy’
tenosynovitis), and uveitis (little pulmonary involvement).
• The rash occurs in 77% and is often unusual including a soft yellow-brown
papillomatous lesion, hypopigmentation, and ulceration.
• Eye disease is often asymptomatic and uveitis requires screening with a slit
lamp. Lacrimal hypertrophy and conjunctival granuloma may be found.
• Other organ involvement is rare but may include parotids glands, testes,
vasculitis, lungs, and renal involvement from hypercalciuria.
• Treatment is as described later in this section. There is a guarded prognosis for
EOS as nearly all develop long-term morbidity despite intervention.
• Older children have a clinical phenotype similar to adult-onset disease.
Musculoskeletal manifestations of sarcoid
Joints
• Distinctive patterns of arthropathy are seen in both acute and chronic
sarcoidosis. In acute disease, migratory arthralgias may precede other
symptoms.
• Acute sarcoid arthritis is mainly oligoarticular, occasionally polyarticular, but
rarely monoarticular. It commonly involves the lower limb joints, often
resulting in symmetrical effusions affecting the knees and ankle joints. After
recovery, recurrence rates are low.
• Chronic polyarthritis is uncommon. It is more frequent in women and in
association with pulmonary disease.
• Different forms of chronic arthritis can occur: non-deforming with
granulomatous synovitis, non-erosive deformity (Jaccoud’s), dactylitis, and
tenosynovitis. Knees and ankles are often involved.
• Rheumatoid factor is positive in 10–47% of chronic arthritis.
Bone
• Bone involvement is estimated to occur in up to 15% of all patients with
sarcoidosis, and is usually accompanied by skin disease.
• Approximately 50% of affected patients are asymptomatic.
• Different types of bone involvement are seen: cystic (most common), lytic,
sclerotic focal lesions, and osteopenia/osteoporosis.
• Bone cysts are often found incidentally on plain films, and seen most often in

[SECTION]•

•

phalanges but may also occur in the skull, facial bones, ribs, spine, pelvis and
long bones.
Bone cysts are frequently seen with persistent disease and/or lupus pernio (i.e.
erythematous induration of the skin across the face).
Dactylitis appears as ‘sausage-like’ swollen digits.
Other radiological features include thickening of cortical bone, acrosclerosis,
and joint destruction.
Lytic lesions which appear in vertebral bodies can lead to back pain, and be a
cause of vertebral fractures.

Muscles
• Skeletal muscle involvement occurs in ~50–80% of patients with sarcoidosis,
but is often asymptomatic. It may present as proximal pain, tenderness, and
weakness.
• Myopathy may be focal with painful nodular granulomatous masses, insidious

[SECTION]with a symmetrical diffuse pattern, or acute with elevated muscle enzymes.
• Muscle weakness is often more pronounced than either the symptoms of pain
or the level of raised CK.
• Acute sarcoid myopathy may involve the respiratory muscles.
• Electromyography is abnormal as for polymyositis.
Diagnosis and investigations
Diagnosis relies on the combination of clinical and radiographic findings,
histological proof of non-caseating granulomas, and exclusion of other diseases
with similar presentation.
• All patients with suspected sarcoidosis should undergo the following
investigations: electrocardiogram (ECG), pulmonary function tests, PA chest
radiograph, slit-lamp examination, tuberculin skin test, urinalysis, 24-hour
urinary calcium and blood tests (urea, electrolytes, creatinine, FBC, ESR, bone
profile, vitamin D, PTH, LFTs, CRP, ACE, CK) in addition to a thorough
physical examination and symptom-driven evaluation.
• A CT chest will also be necessary to assess the degree of parenchymal lung
involvement.
• Leucopenia can be seen in around 30% of cases, and eosinophilia in 25%.
Thrombocytopenia is also relatively common.
• The ESR may be elevated in the acute phase, particularly if EN is present (see
later in chapter for EN/panniculitis).
• Hypercalciuria and/or hypercalcaemia is seen in 10–20%, secondary to
increased 1α-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to active 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) by inflammatory cell-derived 1αhydroxylase. Hypercalciuria can exist without there being (supra-reference
range) hypercalcaemia (but PTH will be suppressed).
• Liver function tests may be deranged and a third of patients have significant
proteinuria.
• Granuloma epithelial cells produce ACE. Serial measurements of ACE may be
useful in monitoring the course of the disease.
• The distribution of inflammatory tissue in sarcoid and guidance to site of
potential biopsy can be identified using either Ga-67 or somatostatin receptor
scintigraphy.
• Other causes of granulomatous disease include tuberculosis and other viral,
parasitic, bacterial, or fungal infections, lymphomas, Crohn’s disease,
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and drug reactions.
• Since sarcoidosis can resemble other diseases, the diagnosis should ideally be
confirmed by histology.

[SECTION]• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may demonstrate lymphocytosis and is useful
in excluding other diagnoses. Transbronchial lung biopsy or mediastinal
lymph node biopsy may also be required.
Treatment (see also pp. 662–80)
• Acute, transient disease may resolve spontaneously, and require only
supportive care. NSAIDs alone may be effective, and should be used in
conjunction with proton pump inhibitors.
• More severe disease may require treatment with GCs, either alone or in
combination with MTX.
• Addition of HCQ may also help the skin and joint manifestations. Several
reports also describe its use in pulmonary and neurological disease, and in
hypercalcaemia.
• AZA is most often used as second-line drug therapy in patients with
progressive disease despite GCs.
• CYC has been used in neuro- and cardiac sarcoidosis.
• Infliximab may be effective for refractory forms of this disease, including
lupus pernio; however, relapse of sarcoidosis has been observed upon
discontinuation.
• Colchicine has been used in patients with sarcoid arthritis at doses similar to
those used in gout.
• No therapy is required for asymptomatic osseous or cystic bone disease, or
asymptomatic muscle disease. The place for GCs in chronic sarcoid myopathy
remains uncertain.
• Mortality is <5% and mainly results from respiratory failure secondary to
pulmonary fibrosis and refractory neurological or cardiac disease.

Miscellaneous skin conditions associated with
arthritis
Panniculitis
Panniculitis is inflammation in fat tissue. It is an inflammatory process involving
neutrophils, leucocytes, and histiocytes that causes fibrosis and granulomas.
• The categories of panniculitis, based on histopathology are septal, lobular,
mixed type septal and lobular, panniculitis with vasculitis.
Septal panniculitis
• This includes erythema nodosum (EN) and Vilanova’s disease (subacute
nodular migratory panniculitis). EN is a common, acute, and self-limiting

[SECTION]condition (typically in lower legs). It usually heals in 4–6 weeks without
scarring. A rare form can cause ulceration and a migratory form can occur for
several years (women 40–50 years old).
• Associations of EN are numerous (see Table 18.6).
Lobular panniculitis
Numerous syndromes have been defined:
• Weber–Christian disease: a relapsing, febrile, nodular non-suppurative
disorder. Multiple recurrent nodules and fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and
abdominal pain. Any area of the body containing fat can be involved, e.g.
mesentery, heart, lung, liver, kidney. There is a 10–15% mortality.
Investigations may show typical histological features on biopsy, elevated ESR,
anaemia, leucopenia, or leucocytosis.
• Lipogranulomatosis: this group of conditions tends to occur in children.
Multiple lesions, often on the extremities, resolve with subcutaneous atrophy.
• Post-GC use: the pathogenesis of this rare condition is not understood. It
seems to be limited to children. It occurs on withdrawal of GCs, and may clear
up on GC re-administration.
• α1-antitrypsin deficiency: may predispose to panniculitis in many types—
worth checking genetic status if severe, recurrent, or family history of
panniculitis.
• Calcifying panniculitis: a feature of chronic renal failure. It is not the same as
metastatic calcification. The prognosis is poor even with good calcium–
phosphate balance. Parathyroidectomy may help.
• Lipodermatosclerosis: may be a result of venous insufficiency and
thrombophlebitis. It should be treated with compression stockings.
Intralesional GCs or low-dose aspirin may also help.
• Lupus profundus is a rare manifestation of chronic cutaneous SLE, occurring
in <3% of cases. The lesions are usually tender and may ulcerate and calcify,
commonly occur on the face, upper arms, and buttocks, and may underlie an
area of discoid lupus. The lesions do not seem to follow the course of the
systemic disease. It may respond to GCs.
• Associated with acute pancreatitis and acute vasculitis.

Sweet’s syndrome

Neutrophilic dermatoses
• The neutrophilic dermatoses are a group of non-infectious disorders
characterized by the presence of an angiocentric, primary neutrophilic
inflammatory cell infiltrate (Table 18.7).
• The disorders can be divided into those that cause vessel wall destruction
(vasculitis) and those that do not.
Sweet’s syndrome
• This condition is rare and occurs more in women than men (4:1), between 30
and 70 years. It has occasionally been reported in children.
• It is otherwise known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis and was
originally described following respiratory infection, but is more commonly
seen in patients with malignancy. It is also caused by drugs, especially
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.
• The characteristic features are fever, neutrophilia, and tender erythematous
cutaneous lesions (plaques, nodules, and papules).
• Lesions can resemble vasculitis, especially in a febrile ill patient.
• Skin biopsy shows intense infiltrate of mature neutrophils, typically in the
upper dermis.
• Untreated, the lesions resolve over 6–8 weeks, but new lesions will continue to
appear.
• The condition is usually an acute, GC-responsive self-limiting disorder. If
longer-term treatment is required, GC dosage may be reduced by the addition
of an NSAID, dapsone, colchicine, or possibly MTX.
• A secondary cause for the condition should be sought (Table 18.8).

Pyoderma gangrenosum
• This is an uncommon, ulcerative, cutaneous lesion associated with AAVs,
SLE, severe RA, and IBDs and rarely spondyloarthritis.
• The lesion is characterized by an erythematous, violaceous border overhanging
a central area of ulceration and necrosis.
• The lesions start as discrete pustules, most often on the legs, and are often
extremely painful, healing with scars.
• There is no specific treatment. An underlying disease should be excluded.
Treatments include topical sodium cromoglicate or 5-amino salicylic acid, oral
sulfonamides, dapsone, and GCs.
Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis
• This is a rare systemic disease, occurring in adults in their 50s. Its recognized
clinically by the combination of papular and nodular skin lesions and a severe
destructive polyarthritis.
• It is associated with malignancy (25%).

[SECTION]• The arthritis mimics RA but notably involves DIPJs. The destruction may give
a picture similar to arthritis mutilans. See Plate 7c.
• The skin lesions occur in ~90% of cases. Histologically, the infiltrate consists
of multicentric giant cells and histiocytes from the monocyte-macrophage
lineage. The lesions are often numerous, non-pruritic, skin coloured (or
yellow/brown), size mm–cm in diameter, and occur most on the dorsum of the
hands and face (nose, corner of the mouth, and ears). Extensive facial
involvement may lead to a ‘leonine’ facies.
• About 25% of cases have xanthelasma.
• The differential diagnosis includes RA, PsA, sarcoid dactylitis, xanthoma,
histiocytosis X, histiocytoma or tendon sheath giant-cell tumour—usually
solitary.
• The condition waxes and wanes. Spontaneous remissions can occur.
• For patients with mild disease, MTX may be sufficient, but the condition can
be aggressive so many patients require treatment with CYC or chlorambucil to
prevent progressive damage.

Relapsing polychondritis
Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare multisystem disorder of unknown
aetiology, characterized by episodic and sometimes progressive inflammation of
cartilage leading to destruction and fibrosis.
• Common sites of involvement include the ear, nose, larynx, joints, heart, and
eyes. Characteristically, the cartilaginous part of the pinna is involved, sparing
the non-cartilaginous lobe.
• Arthralgia involves large and small joints.
• Similar patterns of disease may be seen in PR3-positive AAV. Some patients
with relapsing polychondritis are ANCA positive.
• The disease predominantly affects Caucasians, with peak incidence in the fifth
decade (M=F).
• 50 paediatric cases have been reported worldwide and there appears to be an
association with (monogenetic) autoinflammation.
• There is also an association with HLA-DR4.
• Approximately 30% of cases are associated with other inflammatory or
autoimmune diseases, such as systemic vasculitis, RA, SLE, Sjögren’s
syndrome, thyroiditis, and IBD.
• There are no specific laboratory tests. Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds.
The course of the disease is generally not life-threatening unless it involves the
laryngotracheal cartilage or major artery roots.

[SECTION]• MAGIC syndrome (Mouth And Genital ulcers with Inflamed Cartilage) might
represent a distinct condition but is exceptionally similar to BD with
secondary RP.
Treatment
• Treatment is based on anecdote and consensus. There are no RCTs.
• If involvement is limited to external ear and nasal cartilage with no apparent
destruction or arthritis, symptoms may be controlled with NSAIDs alone.
• Dapsone (50–200 mg/day) may also be of value and some prefer small doses
of GCs (10–20 mg/day) for mild disease also.
• For destructive disease in the cartilage or laryngotracheal, vestibuloneural,
lung, eye, heart, kidney involvement, or systemic vasculitis—high dose GCs
are used (prednisolone ~60 mg/day).
• CYC at 1–2 mg/kg/day has been considered in severe life-threatening lung,
heart, or renal disease.
• Persistent or severe cases may also be treated with AZA, MTX, or ciclosporin
(with due attention to renal function).
• Patients should be assessed for tracheal involvement (e.g. stridor). Some cases
may require temporary or permanent tracheostomy and stents if laryngeal
involvement is severe. Other measures may include continuous positive airway
pressure at night.
• There have been a few case reports regarding the use of biologic therapies
including anti-TNFα, and both IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors, but clinical outcomes
have been variable.

Amyloidosis
Amyloid—a proteinaceous, fibrillar material—is associated with many
conditions. The low solubility of amyloid and its relative resistance to
proteolytic enzymes contributes to the irreversible and often progressive course
of amyloidosis.
• Despite morphological similarities (including the formation of a β-pleated
sheet), amyloid is a heterogeneous group of proteins (at least 20). All types of
amyloid fibrils have a carbohydrate moiety in the form of glycosaminoglycans
and proteoglycans. Most forms of amyloid also contain the extrafibrillar
protein, amyloid-P.
• Two forms are important as manifestations of a response to chronic systemic
inflammation: amyloid-L (AL) and amyloid-A (AA).
• AL consists of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains and is seen in
idiopathic and myeloma-associated amyloidosis. It is the commonest systemic
amyloidosis in Western countries.
• AA is derived from serum amyloid A (SAA), an acute phase apolipoprotein,
and is secondary ‘reactive’ amyloidosis.
• It is unclear why not all chronic inflammatory disorders are associated with
amyloidosis and how various precursor proteins are converted to insoluble
amyloid fibrils.
• In the context of rheumatic disorders, AA amyloidosis is mainly seen in adult
RA and AS.
• Several conditions are rarely associated with AA amyloidosis due to relatively
low levels of acute-phase SAA protein. These include SLE SScl, and Sjögren’s
syndrome (SS).
• Other conditions associated with AA include chronic infections, periodic
fevers, IBD, and less frequently malignancies.

[SECTION]Investigations
The diagnosis of amyloidosis is made by tissue biopsy.
• Although specimens can be obtained from the liver, heart or kidneys, increased
blood vessel fragility associated with amyloid deposition carries an increased
bleeding risk. Therefore readily accessible abdominal subcutaneous fat is the
standard aspiration (ASFA), with a sensitivity of 57–88%, and specificity of
100%.
• If the ASFA is negative, or contraindicated, biopsy of the salivary gland or
rectal mucosa may be useful. Peripheral nerve biopsies vary in their diagnostic
value and can cause residual dysaesthesia.
• Alkaline Congo red stain shows amyloid deposits as apple green/yellow under
the polarizing microscope.
• Immunofixation of serum and urine, as well as an Ig free light chain assay
should be done to confirm AL amyloidosis. If the diagnosis is uncertain, a
bone marrow biopsy could be considered.
• If AL and AA amyloidoses are excluded on immunofixation, further genetic
testing may help identify other weakly amyloidogenic proteins known to make
up the hereditary amyloidoses.
• In patients with chronic inflammatory disease and proteinuria and/or chronic
renal failure, increased SAA confirms AA amyloidosis.
• Echocardiogram is the gold standard for diagnosing cardiac amyloid. Cardiac
MRI is also highly sensitive for heart involvement.
• The serum amyloid protein contributes to stability of amyloid deposits in vivo.
This property is used diagnostically in radiolabelled serum amyloid protein
scintigraphy to detect amyloid in the body and is of value in assessing
response to treatment.
Treatment
• The condition is progressive and there is no cure. Marked heterogeneity of the
hereditary amyloidoses makes counselling difficult.
• The processes by which the disorder may be controlled include liver
transplantation for lysosomal amyloidosis and bone marrow transplantation.
• In the rheumatic diseases, the main goal is to control underlying disease to
suppress SAA production. Various immunosuppressive agents including MTX,
chlorambucil, LEF, and CYC (often in combination with GCs) have improved
the prognosis in RA and JIA patients.

Adult-onset Still’s disease
Epidemiology and pathogenesis
• Adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder of
unknown aetiology, characterized by daily spiking of high fevers accompanied
by a fleeting rash, arthritis, and systemic manifestations.
• Men and women are equally affected with bimodal peaks at ages 15–25 and
36–46 years though case series have suggested an association with pregnancy

[SECTION]and in the post-partum period.
• There may be a genetic predisposition. A Canadian study found a possible link
with HLA-B17, -B18, -B35, and -DR2, but this has not been confirmed in
other studies. Genetic polymorphisms of the IL-18 gene may also be linked to
AOSD susceptibility and/or severity.
• Various infectious triggers have been postulated, suggesting AOSD may be a
reactive syndrome. These include EBV, echovirus, CMV, parvovirus 19,
coxsackievirus, influenza, and bacteria including Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
Chlamydia pneumonia, Brucella abortus, and Borrelia burgdorferi.
• T helper1 (Th1) cytokines present in blood and tissues are thought to play a
role in the pathogenesis of AOSD in addition to IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, TNFα, and
IFN-γ.
Clinical features
Several sets of classification criteria have been proposed and are well developed
from retrospective data. The Yamaguchi criteria (Box 18.1) provide the highest
sensitivity (93.5%).
• Fever: acute onset of daily spiking high fever exceeding 40°C is often the first
symptom. Typically peaks once daily in late afternoon or early evening
(quotidian), lasting <4 hours, and normalizing in 80% without antipyretics.
There may be a double quotidian pattern, with highest spikes occurring in late
afternoon.
• Rash: evanescent salmon-pink, macular or macular papular eruption,
predominantly involving proximal limbs and trunk. The overall incidence of
the rash in AOSD is ~70%. The rash usually appears in conjunction with fever,
and may exhibit Koebner phenomenon. There may be pruritus and
appearances confused with drug allergy.
• Musculocutaneous disease: arthritis may initially be mild, oligoarticular, and
transient, and may evolve gradually into a more severe, destructive, and
symmetrical polyarthropathy—affecting mainly knees, wrists, and ankles.
Elbows, shoulders, hips interphalangeal joints, and temporomandibular joints
may also be involved. Generalized myalgias with fever spikes are seen in the
majority of patients, but inflammatory myopathy is rare.
• Pharyngitis: estimated to occur in ~70% of AOSD cases.
• Liver: hepatomegaly occurs in 50–70%, partly influenced by NSAID use.
Cases of fulminant liver failure have been described.
• Tender cervical lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly occur in 50%. Lymph
node biopsy may resemble lymphoma on light microscopy, but
immunohistochemistry demonstrates benign polyclonal B-cell hyperplasia.

[SECTION]• Cardiopulmonary disease: serositis occurs in 30–40% (pleuritis, pericarditis),
transient pulmonary infiltrates. ILD progressing to ARDS, cardiac tamponade,
and myocarditis have been described.
• Haematological disease: is rare, but pancytopenia secondary to macrophage
activation syndrome (MAS) may occur (~40% of patients), which can be lifethreatening (see
Chapter 25). There have been reports of pure red cell
aplasia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and haemolytic uraemic
syndrome (HUS).
Laboratory and radiographic findings
• There is no specific diagnostic test in AOSD, and no association with RF or
positive ANA.
• ESR is raised in virtually all cases, and CRP may be elevated.
• Marked elevations in serum ferritin occur in ~70%, correlating with disease
activity. A threshold of greater than fivefold the upper limit of normal as a
diagnostic tool for AOSD is thought to have a sensitivity of 80%, but a
specificity of 45%. Levels of 3000–30,000 ng/mL are not uncommon,
normalizing with disease remission.
• A ferritin level of >1000 ng/mL with a glycosylated fraction of 20% or less,
has diagnostic specificity of >90%.
• There is leucocytosis (>10 × 109/L), with a granulocyte predominance.
Normocytic normochromic anaemia and reactive thrombocytosis is common,
especially during active disease.
• There is increased risk of elevated intravascular coagulation in AOSD, and this
may be associated with haemophagocytosis (macrophage activation syndrome)
resulting in pancytopenia, requiring prompt immunosuppression.
• Elevated liver transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, and bilirubin levels are
seen in 75% of cases, ranging from mild to fulminant. Liver biopsy changes
are non-specific.
• Very high levels of IL-18 have been demonstrated in a number of studies of
AOSD.
• Pregnancy and the post-partum period may be facilitative on the development
of AOSD (high IL-18 responses can occur in association with pregnancy).
• Secondary haemophagocytic syndrome (HS) can occur: diffuse intravascular
coagulation (DIC), hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, a decrease in ESR,
hypofibrinogenaemia, marked hyperferritinaemia, and raised triglycerides and
liver enzymes.
• Early suspicion of HS is crucial as there is high morbidity and mortality. The
gold standard diagnostic test is bone marrow aspirate to identify the presence

[SECTION]of haemophagocytosis, but appearances may be visible on a blood film, in
addition to features of haemolysis.
• There are no specific radiographic findings. Classically, there is bilateral nonerosive intercarpal and carpometacarpal joint space narrowing on radiographs,
which may progress to ankylosis over several months. Rapid destruction of the
hip and knee joints can occur in some cases, requiring total joint arthroplasty.
Box 18.1 The Yamaguchi criteria for AOSD
Diagnosis requires the presence of ≥5 criteria, including at least 2 major
criteria, without the presence of any exclusion criteria.
Major criteria
• Fever of >39°C, intermittent, ≥1 week.
• Arthralgias or arthritis, ≥2 weeks.
• Typical rash.
• Leucocytosis (>10 ×109/L) with ≥80% granulocytes.
Minor criteria
• Sore throat.
• Recent significant lymphadenopathy.
• Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
• Abnormal LFTs (including lactate dehydrogenase).
• Negative tests for ANA and RF.
Exclusion criteria
• Infections.
• Malignancies.
• Other rheumatic disease, i.e. vasculitis.

Rheumatol 1992;19:424–30.

Treatment
Treatment strategies are based on organ involvement and disease severity,
aiming to control fever, arthritis, and systemic disease.
• NSAIDs can be used first line, and often a high dose of aspirin is required.
Although effective for MSK symptoms and fever, efficacy rates are low, ~20%
in AOSD patients
• GCs remain first-line treatment, regardless of presentation. The usual dose is
0.5–1 mg/kg/day of prednisolone. Pulsed methylprednisolone is helpful in

[SECTION]•

severe disease refractory to oral GCs. GCs control disease activity in ~60%,
but efficacy seems higher for systemic rather than articular symptoms.
For refractory AOSD, MTX is a commonly used GC-sparing agent, inducing
remission in ~70%.
There is also reported efficacy of AZA, HCQ, D-penicillamine, ciclosporin,
and tacrolimus.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) seems to have a suspensive effect, but is
well tolerated and safe to use if concomitant infection. Usual dose is 2 g/kg
over 2–5 days. Two randomized open label trials have demonstrated efficacy
of IVIg if used early in the course of AOSD. It should also be considered in
the context of macrophage activation syndrome, life-threatening
complications, and in the case of AOSD flare during pregnancy.
Biologic DMARDs used include anakinra (IL-1 antagonist), tocilizumab (IL-6
inhibitor) with beneficial effects on systemic and articular features, and antiTNFα especially in chronic polyarticular disease.
Adalimumab and etanercept may have led to macrophage activation in two
reported cases of AOSD, and have been associated with paradoxical disease
flares. Further prospective evidence is required on their use.

Course of disease and prognosis
There are three main patterns of disease, with ~1/3 of patients falling into each
category.
• Self-limiting or monophasic pattern characterized by a single disease episode.
Most achieve complete remission within 1 year.
• Intermittent or polycyclic systemic pattern consisting of recurrent attacks, with
remission between flares. Subsequent disease flares are often less severe, of
shorter duration and may be years apart.
• Chronic articular pattern associated with poor prognosis. Disease is persistent
with predominant articular symptoms resulting in severe destructive arthritis
and arthroplasty frequent within 2 years.
• Predictors of a chronic disease course include rash, polyarthritis, and
involvement of shoulders and hips. Patients with systemic disease generally
have a favourable diagnosis. Serious complications from disease or treatment
are rare, but amyloidosis is thought to be a common cause of death.

[SECTION]Eosinophilic fasciitis
Eosinophilic fasciitis is an uncommon idiopathic condition that is characterized
by the rapid spread of skin changes over the extremities.
• Skin—usually in the limbs—initially takes on a ‘peau d’orange’ appearance,
which is replaced by induration.
• Like SScl (see Chapter 13), flexion contractures and Raynaud’s disease may
be present. Unlike SScl, the epidermis is spared (i.e. superficial wrinkling is
intact) and nailfold capillaroscopy is normal.
• Other localized scleroderma conditions (see
Chapter 13) will be in the
differential diagnosis in early disease.
• The condition may resolve spontaneously. Otherwise, 70% of cases respond to
GCs.
• The condition may be a paraneoplastic phenomenon.
• It is over-represented in women and in the haematological malignancies in this
respect. The paraneoplastic condition often fails to respond to GCs and
resolves on successful treatment of the underlying malignancy.
• MTX and MMF may be effective and are used as GC-sparing
immunosuppressants.

Immunoglobulin G4-related disease
Epidemiology and pathophysiology
Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare systemic fibroinflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology.
• The pathophysiology and role of the immune system in IgG4-RD is not well
understood. There is Th2 cell involvement with numerous Th2 cytokines (IL4, IL-5, and IL-13) present alongside T-regs (IL-10 and TGF-β). Circulating
plasmablast levels correlate with disease activity, suggesting the importance of
B cells in pathogenesis.
• Characteristic histopathological findings are a lymphoplasmacytic infiltration
with IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis (irregularly whorled pattern
of fibrosis), and obliterative phlebitis.
• It can affect multiple organ sites (see later in section) and may be localized or
systemic, but most commonly affects the extra-pancreatic bile ducts, lacrimal
or salivary glands, or pancreas.
• IgG4-RD often presents with a tissue mass and so may mimic a solid
malignancy or lymphoma.
• It is more common in males and appears to predominantly affect patients

[SECTION]between the age of 50–70 years.
Clinical manifestations
• Multiple organs can be affected: extra-pancreatic bile ducts, lacrimal or
salivary glands, or pancreas (Table 18.11).
• Disease is often incidentally identified on imaging or histopathology
examination of a tissue specimen.
Investigations
• Tissue biopsy is diagnostic.
• Serum IgG4 levels may be raised, although these can be normal.
• ESR and CRP may be elevated.
• Hypergammaglobulinaemia is often seen.
• Low serum complement levels occur in around one-third of patients with renal
involvement.
Treatment and prognosis
• There are no RCTs to guide treatment. GCs are effective, particularly in the
inflammatory phase but less so in the fibrotic phase.
• Though frequently used, there is a lack of consensus as to whether a GCsparing agent should be used.
• RTX has been shown to be effective in a case series and a recent prospective
open-label trial.
• MMF, MTX, and AZA are suggested as treatment options, but there is little
evidence base for their use.
• The natural history and prognosis are poorly described. Significant organ
dysfunction may result from uncontrolled and progressive inflammation and
fibrosis in involved tissues. Relapses are common on weaning GCs,
particularly in systemic disease.

Rare disorders of synovium
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS)
• PVNS is a rare non-malignant condition (2 per million) characterized by an
uncontrolled proliferation of synoviocytes.
• It is associated with iron and fat deposition.
• Repeated small haemorrhages and lipid deposits stain the synovium red-brown
and yellow, respectively.
• The cause of the condition is unknown, although some studies have proposed a
link with chronic repetitive trauma or haemarthroses.
• Any age may be affected (mainly third to fourth decade; both sexes).
• The classic presentation is with monoarthritis.
• The knee is the most commonly affected joint and ‘diffuse’ disease is more
aggressive and more likely to recur.
• PVNS causes an insidious onset of pain and swelling, blood-stained synovial
fluid aspirate, with characteristic synovial biopsy findings.
• Differential diagnosis: malignant synovioma, TB arthritis, synovial
haemangioma, synovial chondromatosis, amyloidosis, haemophilia.
• Radiographs are often normal. Calcification is not a feature of PVNS and
might suggest another cause (e.g. malignant lesion, chondromatosis, gout,
CPPD, trauma, etc.).
• Erosions and subchondral cysts (also on non-articular surfaces) can occur.
Loss of joint space occurs late. MRI is diagnostic.

[SECTION]Treatment
• Monoarticular PVNS is treated by excision of the lesion with or without
preceding Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radiation synovectomy (RS).
• Y-90 RS is essentially only suitable for the knee.
• Y-90 RS can be coadministered with intra-articular steroid.
• Re-186 HEDP RS can be given for mid-size joints (e.g. elbow, ankle).
• Diffuse forms of PVNS tend to be progressive and recurrent.
• There are no robust treatment trials of PVNS. Treatment is based on
radiological staging and technical feasibility.
Synovial chondromatosis
• Synovial chondromatosis is a chondrometaplasia of the sub-synovial
connective tissue. The joint contains thickened, white-blue nodular synovium.
• The cause is unknown, the disorder uncommon, and the process nonmalignant. It tends to occur more often in middle-aged men and has never
been reported in prepubertal childhood.
• Clinically the condition resembles PVNS but tends to be slowly progressive
and sometimes can be self-limiting.
• Radiographs may show punctate calcification at the joint margin.
• The diagnosis should be confirmed on synovial biopsy. In rare cases, there
may be transformation to a chondrosarcoma.
• Treatment is surgical and usually managed with arthroscopy, removing loose
bodies and/or the synovial membrane.

Background: molecular abnormalities of collagen
and fibrillin
Collagen and fibrillin are major connective tissue proteins with important
mechanical functions particularly in tissues relevant to MSK integrity, strength,
and flexibility in tendons, ligaments, and bone. In this chapter, we outline the
conditions manifest by abnormalities in collagen and fibrillin: osteogenesis
imperfecta (OI), Marfan syndrome (MFS), Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), and
hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD)—the most common hereditary disorders
of connective tissue (HDCT).

Osteogenesis imperfecta
Osteogenic imperfecta (OI) is a collection of genetic disorders caused by a lack,
or deficiency, of type I collagen historically known as brittle bone disease.
Varied genotypes can result in related bone phenotypes.
Epidemiology
• OI is uncommon—about 1:20,000 live births.

[SECTION]Genetics
• OI occurs, in >90% of cases, because of mutations in the COL1A1 or
COL1A2 gene.
• In most cases of OI type I there is a ‘functional null’ allele of COL1A1 on
chromosome 17 or COL1A2 on chromosome 7 leading to reduced amounts of
normal collagen I.
• Historically four main types have been defined on clinical criteria (Table 19.1)
though at least 17 distinct genotypes are now recognized.
• OI may exhibit considerable interfamilial and intrafamilial variability in the
number of fractures and degree of disability.
Pathophysiology
• Pathology arises as a result of defects in structure or quantity of type I collagen
found in bone, ligaments, teeth, sclerae, and skin.
Clinical features
Fractures, bone deformity, ligament laxity, joint hypermobility, easy bruising,
poor dentition, and hearing deficit are common features.
• Generalized osteopenia and fractures early in childhood are common.
Fractures are rare in the neonatal period; fracture tendency is constant from
childhood to puberty, decreases thereafter, and often increases following
menopause in women and >60 years in men.
• OI can present in young adults with low BMD or fragility fractures including
recurrent insufficiency fractures.
• Fractures in OI are treated with standard orthopaedic procedures appropriate
for the type of fracture and the age, and heal rapidly with evidence of good
callus formation (sometimes with hypertrophic callus formation) and without
deformity.
• Using clinical, radiographic, and genetic criteria, Sillence developed the
classification currently in use into OI types I to IV: a dominant form with blue
sclerae, type I; a dominant form with normal sclerae, type IV; a perinatally
lethal OI syndrome, type II; and a progressively deforming form with normal
sclerae, type III.
• Hearing loss of conductive or mixed type occurs in about 50% of families,
beginning in the late teens and leading, gradually, to profound deafness,
tinnitus, and vertigo by the end of the fourth to fifth decade.
• Individuals with OI type I have blue sclerae which remain intensely blue
throughout life, in contrast to the sclerae in OI type III and OI type IV which
may also be blue at birth and during infancy.

[SECTION]• The intensity of blue sclerae fades with time such that these individuals may
have sclerae of normal hue by adolescence and adult life.
• A differential diagnosis to consider in young children is non-accidental injury
(NAI) and depending on the time of presentation, idiopathic juvenile
osteoporosis, Cushing’s, and homocystinuria.

Management
• Fractures heal rapidly with evidence of a good callus formation, and, with
good orthopaedic care, without deformity.
• Short-term use of bisphosphonates in children and adults with type I OI is
associated with BMD gains and fracture risk reduction.
• In children, IV bisphosphonate is favoured over oral treatment—mostly
pamidronate historically but now zoledronic acid is being increasingly used.
• Treatment with bisphosphonates can reduce bone pain and fractures, increases
BMD, results in more normal skeletal growth, and is well tolerated. Greatest

gains are probably in the first 2–4 years of treatment.
In children, pamidronate is given at 1 mg/kg body weight over 4 hours on 3
successive days; infusion cycles are repeated every 4 months.
Some evidence for a positive effect on BMD, bone pain, and fracture
prevention from teriparatide exists anecdotally. Intuitively teriparatide may
offer a better ‘treatment fit’ for OI compared with bisphosphonate in low
collagen production OI.
The long-term skeletal effects of anti-resorption therapy in adults with OI are
unknown.
There are anecdotal reports of the use of teriparatide in adults with OI where
gains in BMD are documented.
RCTs of teriparatide and abaloparatide are in planning.
Regular hearing evaluations after adolescence and early stapedectomy or
stapedotomy are recommended.

Distal arthrogryposes
Case reports of congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA; Beal’s
syndrome/distal arthrogryposis type IX) highlight the wide variation in clinical
features representing variable genetic expressivity in the distal arthrogryposes
(DAs).
• In the DAs, the MSK features of joint contractures, arachnodactyly,
camptodactyly, and kyphoscoliosis predominate in CCA.
• The DAs types 1–10 are a group of disorders that mainly involve the distal
parts of the limbs manifest by congenital contractures of two or more different
body areas without primary neurologic or muscle disease. The prototypic
distal arthrogryposis is type 1 (DA1)—characterized largely by camptodactyly,
clubfoot, and heterozygous mutation in the TPM2 gene on chromosome 9p13
(the gene encoding beta-tropomyosin).

Marfan syndrome and related disorders
Marfan syndrome (MFS) is due to heterozygous mutations (numerous) in the
fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1) on chromosome 15q21.1.
• MFS is an autosomal dominant condition with complete penetrance and
prevalence of 1 in 25,000; criteria for diagnosis are shown in Table 19.2.
• MFS is characterized by long extremities (span/height ratio >1.05), long

fingers and feet (arachnodactyly) with a hand/height ratio >11% and
foot/height ratio >15%, tall stature (with upper segment/lower segment ratio
<0.89), pectus deformity of the chest wall, high-arched palate, mandibular
hypoplasia, lens dislocations and myopia, and joint laxity.
Other common or peculiar manifestations include striae distensae, pulmonary
blebs (which predispose to spontaneous pneumothorax), and spinal arachnoid
cysts or diverticula.
All features are listed in Table 19.2.
Mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation, dilatation of the aortic root, and
aortic regurgitation are cardiovascular features. Aneurysm of the aorta and
aortic dissection are life-threatening.
About 35% of affected persons have MV prolapse, aortic root enlargement or
both on echocardiography, despite normal auscultatory findings on cardiac
examination, thus all MFS patients should have an echocardiogram and
thoracic CT/MR to assess the aortic valve and arch.
Beta blockade has been used on the premise it will decrease the rate of aortic
dilatation and improve survival.
In comparing MFS with non-MFS children, height is a discriminant criterion
when >3.3 standard deviations above the mean for age.

Beal’s syndrome
• MFS shows pleiotropism and clinical variability. It shares overlapping features
with congenital contractural arachnodactyly (also termed Beal’s syndrome and
distal arthrogryposis type IX), which is caused by a mutation in the FBN2
gene (chromosome 5q23–q31).
Loeys–Dietz syndrome (LDS)
LDS has similarities to MFS.
• LDS characteristics include craniofacial dysmorphism (craniosynostosis, cleft
palate, hypertelorism), arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, scoliosis, joint laxity,
talipes equinovarus, translucent and hyperelastic skin, umbilical hernia, and
vascular lesions, e.g. dilatation of the ascending aorta.
• LDS1 is caused by a mutation in the TGF-βR1 gene.
• LDS2 is caused by a by mutation in the TGF-βR2 gene.
• LDS3, which is associated with early-onset osteoarthritis, is caused by a
mutation in the SMAD3 gene.
• LDS4 is caused by a mutation in the TGF-β2 gene.
• LDS5 is caused by a mutation in the TGF-β3 gene.

In the absence of genetic confirmation, 2 major criteria and 1 other system involvement are required for
the diagnosis. In a case where genetic mutations are known in the family, 1 other major criterion is
required with involvement of one other organ system.

[SECTION]Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a clinically heterogeneous condition
characterized by skin fragility, ligament laxity, short stature, spinal deformity,
vascular fragility, and (rarely) retinal detachment.
Classification
The Villefranche nosology for EDS has been updated. Villefranche recognized
nine subtypes based on the severity of the clinical features, the underlying
biochemical and genetic defect, and the pattern of inheritance. The 2017 updated
classification (Table 19.3) lists 13 subtypes and is available online at:

Genotyping and clinical diagnosis
• There is considerable overlap between subtypes.
• Diagnosis is increasingly though genotyping—available on blood or saliva
DNA sequencing analysis.
• For those who meet the minimal clinical requirements for an EDS subtype, but
who have no access to molecular confirmation; or whose genetic testing shows
one (or more) gene variants of uncertain significance in the genes identified
for one of the EDS subtypes; or in whom no causative variants are identified in
any of the EDS-subtype specific genes, then a ‘provisional clinical diagnosis’
of an EDS subtype can be made.
• If no diagnosis is made by genotyping and if there is an extreme clinical
phenotype, then expanded molecular testing can be considered.
• Embryonic testing can be done either by pre-implantation genetic diagnosis
(PGD) and pre-natal testing in utero. PGD is only approved for use in the
vascular and classical EDS types.
Classical EDS (cEDS)
• cEDS is often predominantly initially manifest by disability. It affects skin,
wound healing, and joints. The effects often worsen over time as hypermobile
joints can be unstable, causing painful dislocations, subluxations, arthritis,
bursitis, tendonitis, and (later-adult) painful OA.
• Hyperextensible skin is easily torn and doesn’t repair itself well, causing pain
and disfiguring scarring.
• Difficulties may arise during pregnancy: joint pain from increased body
weight, early rupture of membranes and premature birth, cervical
incompetence and spontaneous abortion, excessive tissue trauma during
delivery, and MSK complications in the post-natal period due to lifting and
caring for the newborn.
• Patients are often partly resistant to local anaesthetic—cause unclear.
• Physical therapy for EDS should focus on graded exercise and joint and skin
protection. Some individuals require joint splints. Spinal deformity may need
bracing or surgery, and retinal disease requires ophthalmic expertise.
Hypermobile EDS (hEDS)
The 1997 criteria for diagnosing hEDS were updated in 2017. Formerly, criteria
for diagnosis were met if there was either hyperextensibility (and/or smooth
velvety skin) and/or generalized joint hypermobility and the presence of ≥1

[SECTION]minor criteria (recurring joint dislocations, chronic joint/lib pain, positive family
history.
• The 2017 criteria supercede the Brighton criteria. See are Table 19.4.
• hEDS evolves over time. Contortionism and propensity for sprains and
dislocations occurs in hEDS but is not specific to the diagnosis.
• Pain initially is often limited to lower limbs.
• There may be easy fatiguability and voiding dysfunction.
• The ‘pain’ phase (which starts in the second to fourth decade of life) includes
more widespread and progressively worsening MSK pain, pelvic pain in
women, and headache.
• The ‘stiffness’ phase (observed in a few adults and elderly only) results in
general reduction of joint mobility, significant reduction in function due to
disabling pain and fatigue, and limitations from reduced muscle mass and
weakness, prior injuries and arthritis.
• Patients with all types of EDS, may be at risk of developing postural
orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS)—an abnormal increase in heart rate
that occurs after sitting up or standing, causing dizziness, fainting, and other
symptoms.
• However, the EDS-PoTS association is disputed as PoTS can be a benign
condition affecting most commonly girls and women aged 15–50 years.
• PoTS can be treated with salt and fluid supplementation.
Vascular EDS (vEDS)
Uterine, arterial, or visceral rupture and a history of spontaneous bleeding raises
the possibility of vascular (type IV) EDS.
• There is an expected shortened lifespan (median 49 years for men and 53 years
for women). Acrogeria is common.
• Appearance is often characteristic: translucent skin, increased visibility of
veins, thin lips, small chin, thin nose, large eyes, receding gums. Also often
seen: receding gums, easy bruising, congenital club foot.
• vEDS can cause massive bleeding (e.g. intracranial aneurysm, arterial
dissection, uterine and GI bleeding).
• In vEDS, operative therapy is reserved for compelling indications in which
benefit clearly warrants risk because of bleeding risk.
Table 19.4 The 2017 criteria for diagnosing hypermobile EDS (hEDS)

Criteria 1
There is generalized joint hypermobility based on a ‘positive’ Beighton score

[SECTION](see Table 19.6) of:
• ≥6 in prepubertal children and adolescents.
• ≥5 in men and women, post-puberty up to age of 50 years.
• ≥4 in men and women older than 50 years.
Criteria 2
Two or more of the following features apply. There is/are:
A. At least 5 systemic manifestations of a more generalized connective tissue
disorder are present (from following list).
B. A positive family history (≥1 first-degree relatives independently meeting
criteria for hEDS).
C. Musculoskeletal complications (≥1 from following list)
A: an unusually soft or velvety skin, mild skin hyperextensibility, unexplained
striae without a history of significant weight change, bilateral piezogenic
papules of the heel, recurrent or multiple abdominal hernias, atrophic
scarring involving at least 2 sites and without the formation of truly
papyraceous and/or haemosideric scars as seen in cEDS, dental crowding
and high or narrow palate, pelvic floor, rectal and/or uterine prolapse in
children men or nulliparous women without a history of morbid obesity or
other predisposing condition, arachnodactyly defined by bilateral
Steinberg and/or Walker signs, arm span to height ratio ≥1.05, mitral
valve prolapse, aortic root dilatation with Z-score >+2.
C: MSK pain in ≥2 limbs, recurring daily for at least 3 months, chronic
widespread pain for ≥3 months, recurrent joint dislocations or frank
instability, in the absence of trauma (requiring both ≥3 atraumatic
dislocations in same joint or more atraumatic dislocations in 2 different
joints occurring at different times and medical confirmation of joint
instability at ≥2 sites, unrelated to trauma.
Criteria 3
All the following are required:
• Absence of skin fragility, which should prompt consideration of other
types of EDS.
• Exclusion of other heritable and acquired connective tissue disorders
including autoimmune rheumatic conditions.
• In patients with an acquired/autoimmune connective tissue disorder
additional diagnosis of hEDS requires meeting both features A and B of
criterion 2. Feature C of criterion 2 cannot be counted towards a diagnosis
of hEDS.
• Exclusion of other diagnoses that may also include joint hypermobility by

[SECTION]means of hypotonia and/or connective tissue laxity.
A diagnosis of hEDS is made when all three criteria are met.

Hypermobility spectrum disorder in adults
Hypermobility is now characterized through the term ‘hypermobility spectrum
disorder’ (HSD). Generalized and localized forms are recognized (Table 19.5).
Notably, having an HSD can be an advantage if it is not severe; for example,
flexibility/hypermobility may present greater opportunity for enhanced motor
competence and sporting prowess through increased agility, as with gymnasts
and some dancers.
• Associated features of HSD include chronic widespread pain, fatigue,
cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, pelvic organ
prolapse.
• In adults, the diagnosis of both hEDS and an HSD requires knowledge of the
Beighton hypermobility scale (Table 19.6). The scale has been validated across
some but not all ethnic groups where the range of connective tissue laxity may
vary.
• The genetics of the HSDs is poorly understood.
• Although hypermobility diminishes with age, the symptoms tend to continue
and may worsen.
• It is important to remember that older patients may have been previously more
mobile and that the Beighton score may not be an appropriate measure. A
history of joint laxity should be sought.

Treatment of joint hypermobility syndrome in adults
• It is important to de-medicalize simple situations of flexible joints and mild
hypermobility where possible.
• Patients should be reassured that unlike other forms of heritable connective
tissue disease, there are often no serious long-term complications of most
HSDs and the mainstay of treatment is a combination of conservative
measures such as physiotherapy and pain relief.
• Analgesics are often unhelpful for chronic pain, but have their place in acute
symptoms. Pain and fatigue cause significant morbidity.
• Joint stabilizing exercises with particular reference to core stability, posture,
and proprioception are beneficial, as may be advice on avoiding overuse
injuries and practical ways of managing day-to-day activities. A global
approach to joint stability and function, as opposed to just treating regional
symptoms, is effective.
• ‘Pain management’ should be considered in chronic pain cases. This might
include for example, cognitive behavioural therapy and management plans

similar to those used in fibromyalgia.
The role of serotonergic/noradrenergic agents in these patients is unclear. In
part there may be effective control of depression; however, there may also be
direct analgesic properties to these agents.
Neuroleptic agents for neuropathic pain have not been studied in this group of
patients. However, gabapentin or pregabalin and other similar agents may have
a role.
Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction requires specialist assessment and
advice.
Pregnancy is often a concern. Unlike the rarer forms of EDS, hEDS and the
HSDs are not associated with any major vascular hazard during pregnancy and
labour. However, in hEDS, and generalized HSD there are a number of
considerations:
• Joint pain/dislocation may increase during pregnancy.
• Positioning during delivery should be careful to avoid excessive strain on
joints.
• Labour may be rapid.
• Membranes may rupture prematurely.
• There is an apparent resistance to the effects of local anaesthetics.
• Healing may be impaired and surgical technique may need to be modified
accordingly.
• There is no absolute indication for caesarean section.
• Severe pelvic floor problems (uterine prolapse, etc.) May occur than
otherwise anticipated.

Hypermobility in children and adolescents
A robust definition of the HSDs in children and/or adolescents has not been
established, so distinguishing ‘the more hypermobile of the range of normal’ (i.e.
familial connective tissue laxity) from ‘pathological’ is challenging if based on
hypermobility alone.
• Historically, use of the diagnostic terms ‘benign joint hypermobility syndrome’
and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (EDS type 3) had a tendency
to draw attention to a heterogeneous population of children and adolescents
with widespread pain and other clinical features whose level of stress and
disability was poorly served.
• In considering making a diagnosis of hEDS or an HSD in a child or adolescent
it is important to consider that:
• Beighton criteria have never been validated in children.

[SECTION]• in the past, diagnostic labels such as EDS type 3 have been over- and
misused without reference to validated criteria.
• that joint hypermobility and connective tissue laxity is a manifestation of a
number of disorders—see Box 19.1, p. 592.

Epidemiology (of asymptomatic hypermobility)
• Hypermobility is present at high levels in the normal paediatric population.
There are racial variations and a Beighton score of ≥4 is especially common in
preschool children.
• In teenage girls and boys (mean 14 years), a large UK study found generalized
joint laxity in 27.5% and 10.6%, respectively, using a cut-off of four
hypermobile joints.
• Hyperextensibility at the little finger has been found in >40% girls and >30%
scored positively for thumb apposition. One explanation of this is that
hypermobility may be normal in a teenage population.
The relationship of hypermobility and chronic pain in children
• A theoretical basis for problems with hypermobility is that individuals with
hypermobility require greater muscular control to avoid stress, and possible
damage, of the joint capsule or associated ligaments. As a result, it has been
inferred that hypermobility may be a risk factor for chronic MSK pain.
• However, although there is some, if inconsistent evidence, that hypermobility
in children and adolescents is associated with an increased risk of MSK pain,
the true value of a diagnostic label of HSD as the cause of pain is unclear and
may even be harmful in asserting a life-long condition when this is unproven.
• Pain associated with hypermobility should also be seen in the context of the
general prevalence of MSK pain. Several studies have shown MSK pain can
occur in a third of people from the general population.

[SECTION]• It is prudent to consider that if there is long-term pain in a child who has some
features of hypermobility, the pain and hypermobility may not necessarily be
linked through a causal mechanism:
• A prospective study of the relationship between hypermobility (Beighton
score ≥6) and MSK pain in the same population found a twofold increased
risk of pain in shoulders, knees, feet, and ankles, but not other joints.
• In the same study, the impact of pain on daily activities was found to be
unrelated to hypermobility.
• The lack of association between chronic widespread pain, hypermobility,
and pain intensity is consistent across studies.
• In a study of juvenile fibromyalgia, pain scores were similar in those with
and those without hypermobility.
• As a result of the above-listed points, in a child with chronic pain where there
is some evidence for hypermobility, rehabilitation and functional restoration is
best achieved by a ‘needs’ rather than ‘diagnostic’ focus.

Stickler syndrome
Stickler syndrome is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous disorder
characterized by ocular, auditory, skeletal, and orofacial abnormalities.
Most forms of Stickler syndrome are characterized by the eye findings of high
myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration, retinal detachment, and cataracts. Additional
findings may include midline clefting (cleft palate or bifid uvula), Pierre Robin
sequence, flat midface, sensorineural or conductive hearing loss, mild
spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and early-onset osteoarthritis.
There are five genetic subtypes of Sticker syndrome:
• Type I is caused by heterozygous mutation in the COL2A1 gene on
chromosome 12q13.
• Stickler syndrome type II (STL2), sometimes called the beaded vitreous type,
is caused by mutation in the COL11A1 gene on chromosome 1p21.
• Stickler syndrome type III (STL3), sometimes called the non-ocular form, is
caused by mutation in the COL11A2 gene on chromosome 6p21. STL1–3 are
AD inherited.
• AR forms include Stickler syndrome type IV (STL4), caused by mutation in
the COL9A1 gene on chromosome 6q12–q14, and type V (STL5), caused by
mutation in the COL9A2 gene on chromosome 1p33–p32.2.

For a detailed view on the differential diagnosis of the entire range of upper
limb lesions, see Chapter 3
For steroid injection of upper limb lesions, see Chapter 24

Subacromial impingement
Subacromial impingement (SAI) is impingement of tissues between the humeral
head (often the greater tuberosity) and an arch of overlying tissues formed by the
acromion, coracoacromial ligament, and coracoid. The tissue most frequently
affected is part of the rotator cuff tendon, the supraspinatus tendon.
Clinical features
Impingement causes shoulder pain when the patient reaches up or behind their
back, or rolls over on the shoulder at night.
• SAI is the most common type of presentation of shoulder pain in adults.
• Pain is often referred to the upper arm.
• Causes are acute rotator cuff tendonitis (which may be calcific), subacromial
bursitis, rotator cuff tear with cuff instability and impingement, and
glenohumeral (GH) instability due to a number of different lesions (e.g. labral
tear, synovitis due to crystal arthritis).
• Inferior acromial osteophytes/acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) osteoarthritis
(OA) can accompany any subacromial lesion, and often precede them and thus
are risk factors for recurrent rotator cuff disease.
• Weakness and loss of range of motion occur particularly if the tendon tears.
• Long-term rotator cuff disease can lead to ‘cuff arthropathy’, with OA of the
GH joint (GHJ) and significant chronic morbidity.

[SECTION]• In children or young adults with SAI, consideration of an underlying GH
(instability) lesion is mandatory.
Making a diagnosis
• Exclude alternative causes of shoulder pain, including rotator cuff tear,
adhesive capsulitis, and referred pain from the neck or abdomen (e.g.
cholecystitis with pain referred to the shoulder).
• Signs: painful arc on active arm elevation, pain on active reach behind back,
positive Neer or Kennedy–Hawkins test (see Fig. 3.5 p. 91; Table 20.1).
• An AP radiograph can show changes identifying GH or bony pathology,
calcific tendonitis, and chronic changes at supraspinatus insertion on humeral
head.
• Consider requesting an AP view with 30° external rotation at the arm, an outlet
Y view, and an axillary view.
• In many cases, US is the mainstay of further clarifying the nature of rotator
cuff pathology, detecting structural damage, and identifying alternative
explanations for shoulder pain.
• MRI also characterizes sites of cuff inflammation and is more sensitive than
US in identifying cuff tears and can provide more information about the whole
shoulder complex including GHJ lesions, deeper lying enthesitis, the ACJ, and
bone lesions.
• The gold standard for diagnosing cuff tears is direct vision at arthroscopy.
Management
• Avoid overhead arm activities.
• Trial a full-dose regular NSAID for 2 weeks.
• If the rotator cuff is convincingly not torn (feasible to tell only for
supraspinatus by testing shoulder abduction against submaximal resistance at
position of downward vertically held arm), consider steroid (e.g.
methylprednisolone 40 mg; see Plate 5) with local anaesthetic injection (e.g.
5 mL 1% lidocaine). Approach laterally or posteriorly under acromion—see
also Chapter 24.
• Follow-up injection with cuff physiotherapy 2 weeks later. Physiotherapy can
address rotator cuff muscle(s) weakness and imbalance and abnormal posture.
• Patients should be given realistic expectations that physiotherapy may take
several months to provide relief, and much self-motivation is needed.
• Consider a second injection not before 6 weeks after the first (Fig. 20.1; see
also Chapter 24 for injection procedure/technique).
• Refer for surgical opinion if symptoms persist, as some are amenable to

[SECTION]arthroscopic debridement of impinging acromial osteophytes.
• A full-thickness tear that is identified early and not fully retracted, can be
amenable to surgical repair.

* Use 20–40 mg triamcinolone acetonide or methylprednisolone acetate. LH, long head.

Adhesive capsulitis
Adhesive capsulitis (AC)—aetiology unknown, though it involves capsular and
coracohumeral ligament contractures—is suggested by a gradual, painful loss of
both active and passive range of movement of the GHJ (see also Chapter 3 for
clinical assessment and differential diagnosis on presentation).
Epidemiology
• AC is more common in females than males, and is four times more common in
diabetics than the general population.
• Females are typically affected between the ages of 40 and 60 years.
• AC occurs bilaterally in 15% of patients.
• Recurrence is unusual.
• Without intervention, the pain usually resolves in <2 years, but the patient may
be left with long-term restriction of shoulder movement.
Presentation and investigations
• AC should not be confused with SAI, though the two lesions can co-exist.
With SAI, passively induced GHJ movements remain intact and are less

[SECTION]painful than active movements. With AC, passive and active movements are
equally impaired.
• Clues to the diagnosis from examination include marked restriction of external
rotation, early scapular abduction (normally the scapula doesn’t move until
30° of abduction has been completed).
• If the presentation is delayed (e.g. >6 months), a secondary SAI may have
evolved and is exposed as some range of motion begins to return.
Management
• Rule out associated conditions: diabetes, hypothyroidism, lung carcinoma,
myocardial infarction, stroke, and protease inhibitor use for human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
• Control pain during the initial painful/stiff phase of the condition. Consider
NSAIDs, IA steroid injection (e.g. 40 mg methylprednisolone with 5 mL 1%
lidocaine), suprascapular nerve block, or a short course of prednisone 30
mg/day for 3 weeks.
• If rotator cuff intact (confirm with US), consider image-guided hydrodilatation
or manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA), early.
• Hydrodilatation improves pain and function to a greater degree than MUA
when compared in RCTs.
• Mobilize with physical therapy early, but be aware this may be limited by poor
pain control.

Lateral humeral epicondylitis
Lateral humeral epicondylitis (LHE)—often called tennis elbow or apophysitis
of the common extensor tendon origin—is essentially an enthesitis. It is
common, and affects 1–3% of the adult population, typically age 40–60 years.
The dominant arm is most affected. It is rare in elite tennis players, but up to
40% of social players get it at some time. Enthesitis at the site is common and is
typically associated with the SpA conditions (see
Chapter 8). For clinical
assessment and differential diagnosis, see Chapter 3.
Pathophysiology
LHE is thought to be due to either cumulative trauma overuse disorder from
mechanical overloading or typical SpA-related pathophysiology if an
inflammatory cause.
• If chronic, it can lead to tendon degeneration and bone changes.
• True inflammation of the enthesis can occur but pain can exist without there

[SECTION]being any identifiable inflammation.
• Poor prognosis is associated with manual work, high level physical strain at
work, and high baseline pain and distress.
• Consider that the lesion may be part of SpA if bilateral, recurrent without
trauma or associated with other SpA features.
Presentation and diagnosis
(See also Chapter 3.)
• Pain is elicited by resisted force in forearm/wrist pronation (e.g. handshakes,
turning doorknobs, carrying bags) or resistance of finger or wrist extension.
• Pain often extends from the LHE down the extensor compartment to the
forearm.
• Enthesitis, tendon tears, and joint lesions may be diagnosed by an experienced
MSK ultrasonographer.
• MRI may miss mild LHE/enthesitis and appearances are not specific. MRI is
more useful for ruling out tendon tears and joint lesions.
• If lesions are bilateral then specifically consider SpA.
• The main differential diagnoses are elbow joint lesions, referred neck pain,
and enthesitis (e.g. DISH or enthesitis linked to SpA, particularly PsA; see
Chapter 8).
Management
(See also Chapter 24.)
• During the acute phase, LHE can be treated with activity restriction, pain
control, an elbow clasp, and immobilization.
• NSAIDs and gabapentin/pregabalin may help in some cases. Employ a
treatment trial for a limited period of time and review.
• Injection around the epicondyle with methylprednisolone 20 mg should be
considered if conservative therapy fails—see Chapter 3 for details (see
Plate 6).
• Isometric grip exercises and stretching forearm extensor tissues (graded wrist
flexion mobilisations) may also help with recovery.
• If other inflammatory MSK lesions are evident then examining for widespread
enthesitis lesions and other features of SpA is indicated. With substantial SpArelated enthesopathic disease then DMARDs may be considered (e.g.
sulfasalazine or methotrexate).
• Surgery is rarely indicated, and should be considered for patients with
persistent symptoms despite other therapies (Fig. 20.2).
• Unproven therapies include autologous blood injection of tendon origin,

[SECTION]lithotripsy, and therapeutic US.

Introduction
For a review of spinal anatomy and functional anatomy, see Chapter 3 under
relevant sections for thoracic or lumbar spine in adults.
• The differential diagnosis of symptoms located to the neck and back is
included in the relevant part of Chapter 3.
• Relevant review of issues and tables on spinal conditions include the
following:
• Painful neurological and MSK conditions of the thoracic spine and chest
wall. See Table 3.12, p. 132.
• Common and/or serious causes of neck pain in adults. See Table 3.1, p.

• Testing nerve root tension in patients with low back pain and associated leg
pain. See ‘Testing nerve root tension’, p. 146.
• Testing muscle strength in the lower limbs (in patients with neurogenic leg
pain associated with low back pain). See Table 3.15, p. 147.
• Principal combinations of signs used for identifying lumbar nerve root
lesions. See Table 3.16, p. 148.

A categorization of back pain
Non-spinal back pain
Pain may radiate to the back from lesions in other structures, e.g. renal, aortic
aneurysmal, pleuritic or pancreatic disorders, and periaortitis. For summary of
conditions causing spinal pain see ‘Thoracic back and chest pain in adults’, p.
132 and ‘Low back pain: adults’, p. 140).
Acute non-specific back pain
• This accounts for 80–85% of all acute back pain.
• Typically, 90% of cases will recover in <6 weeks (the threshold for
reassurance).
• Most causes will be ‘mechanical’ in origin but some causes will be
neuropathic and others inflammatory in nature.
Chronic back pain
• Describes pain that has been present for >12 weeks.
• Some causes will be neuropathic, others inflammatory in nature, but the
majority can be categorized as ‘mechanical’.
Neuropathic pain
• This type of pain accounts for approximately one-third of acute and chronic
low back pain.
• The painDetect® questionnaire is a useful assessment tool, as well as an aide
memoire for the typical symptoms of neuropathic pain: burning, prickling,
hot/cold dysaesthesia, sensitivity to touch and pressure, numbness, and sudden
‘electric shock’-like symptoms.
‘Red flags’ and ‘yellow flags’
This terminology is used to identify potentially serious secondary physical (red)
and psychosocial (yellow) pathologies (Table 21.1).

Acute and subacute back pain (adults)
Acute mechanical back pain
• Most cases in a primary care setting are due to lumbar muscle strain or sprain
presenting with diffuse pain in the lower back to buttocks, which resolves
spontaneously.
• If pain is related to posture or movement, especially of the thoracic cage, and
local tenderness is felt at the lumbosacral junction then the pain is highly
likely to be MSK in origin.
• Within the gravid population, two-thirds of the pregnant women suffer from
low back pain, typically increasing with gestational stage, impacting on sleep,
work, and day-to-day function.
• ‘Red flags’ merit more thorough investigation. Although far less common
(<15% of all cases), the following should be considered (% of cases in back
pain population):
• Fracture.
• Symptomatic herniated disc (4%).
• Spinal stenosis (3%).
• Malignancy (0.7%).
• Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)/ankylosing spondylitis (0.3%).
• Cauda equina syndrome (0.04%) causing saddle anaesthesia, leg weakness,
bilateral sciatica, and bladder dysfunction).
• Spinal infection or inflammatory radiculopathy (0.01%).

[SECTION]• Herniated discs account for 4% of lower back pain. Disc herniation presents
with leg pain radiating past the knee, and is most common in patients between
20 and 50 years of age.
• Degenerative causes of back pain, including degenerative disc disease, facet
joint OA, and lumbar canal spinal stenosis, are more common in older
patients.
• The immediate management is a combination of adequate and regular
analgesia, titrating as per patient response, as well as encouraging gentle
mobilization and normalization of activities.
• In the short term, as diazepam may be considered to decrease muscle spasm
and aid sleep.
• The clinician should explore patient fears (‘yellow flags’) and, where
appropriate, reassure that serious illness is unlikely, that tests are not usually
needed, and severe pain is often short-lived.
• Radiographs are likely to be unhelpful for management in most cases unless
red flag signs are present.
• MRI of the lumbar spine, for example, frequently demonstrates abnormal
findings in asymptomatic patients; the relationship between such findings and
clinical symptoms is not always clear.
• A rehabilitation approach should be considered (Table 21.2). The evidence for
therapies is variable. Adherence may be augmented by providing patient
education literature.
Table 21.2 Therapies used in facilitating rehabilitation after acute mechanical low back pain

Manipulation Either done by an osteopath, chiropractor, or physiotherapist.
Cochrane review (2012) demonstrated lack of efficacy
compared to inert treatment or sham manipulation. Smaller
studies since 2015 demonstrate a slight benefit, however
McKenzie
exercises

Passive extension exercises designed to improve pain and
stiffness associated with disc and anterior spinal structure
pathology. May aggravate pain from posterior spine
structures, e.g. facet joints, spinous processes.
A systematic review in 2011 has demonstrated a modest
benefit in patients undertaking directional preference
exercise within the McKenzie framework

Hydrotherapy Poorly studied, but warmth can ease movement and augment
or
land-based exercises. Might be considered after initial

[SECTION]balneotherapy painful phase to regain normal movements and mobility. May
only suit a few patients and resources may be limited
Graded
activity
programmes

Useful for patients who require guidance and would be
unable to gain optimally from home exercise regimen. A plan
for rehabilitation with milestones is useful for some patients

Behavioural
programmes

Focuses on psychological aspects of pain, involves moderate
supervision and planned withdrawal of treatment. Differs
from some other approaches in that the therapist takes over
the ‘control’ of the back pain. Limited resources may restrict
provision of this approach

Back pain and nerve root lesions
See also ‘Low back pain: adults’, pp. 144–147 for review of anatomy and
functional anatomy.
• Nerve root compression occurs mostly because of acute or subacute disc
prolapse or foraminal stenosis. The peak incidence is age 30–50 years. 70%
resolve within 3 months and 90% within 6 months.
• Nerve root compression should be suspected if acute or subacute back pain is
associated with segmental nerve or sciatic leg pain.
• Acute sciatic pain (‘sciatica’ affecting the outer and posterior leg) is often
sharp or burning in nature, and most frequently arises from acute disc prolapse
of either L4/5 or L5/S1 (>90% of cases).
• Sciatica is characterized by leg pain projecting past the knee, which may be
more severe than the associated back pain.
• A patient with a herniated disc may present with sciatica.
• Evidence of disc herniation may be elicited by straight leg raise or crossed
straight leg raise (i.e. elevation of unaffected leg). These tests are positive if
pain is felt in the buttock or in the back at a leg angle of 30–60°. Pain elicited
at a leg angle <10° is consistent with MSK back pain.
• L5 nerve root lesions give decreased strength of the foot and great toe
dorsiflexion, standing on heel, and decreased ankle reflex and sensation over
great toe.
• S1 root lesions give decreased strength in plantar foot flexion, difficulty in
weight-bearing on toes, and decreased ankle reflex and sensation on the sole or
outer part of foot.
Principles of management

[SECTION]• The natural history: 30–60% of patients recover in 1 week.
• Analgesia such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs should be
considered first.
• Use of diazepam may be of benefit in the short term to lessen muscle spasm.
Some patients may need opiate therapy for pain control, e.g. codeine
phosphate, tramadol, buprenorphine, and short- or long-acting morphine
sulfate.
• Bed rest should be discouraged: prolonged bed rest leads to worse outcomes.
Gentle mobilization should be encouraged.
• An epidural steroid injection can improve pain in the short term, but data from
RCTs does not show better long-term outcome at 3 months or longer compared
with controls.
• A meta-analysis showed that 1 in 7 patients having a steroid epidural
experienced >75% improvement in pain in the short term, and 1 in 13
experienced >50% symptom improvement in the long term.
• Physical therapy and supervised rehabilitation using lumbar extensor exercise
regimens may be of benefit.
• MRI can characterize lesions, but 25% of asymptomatic people have frank
disc protrusions; so MRI gives poor specificity. MRI should be used to
confirm a diagnosis, not to reach for one.
• The absolute indications for surgery (Table 21.3) are cauda equina syndrome,
progressive muscle weakness, and neuropathy causing functional disability.
Facet joint arthritis/syndrome
• Lumbar spine facet joint (FJ) osteoarthritis (OA) is common in middle
aged/elderly adults, and can be part of generalized OA.
• FJOA is associated with degenerative and spondylolytic spondylolistheses—
forward slippage of a vertebrae on the vertebrae below it.
• Psoriatic arthritis (see
Chapter 8) and calcium pyrophosphate disease
(CPPD; see
Chapter 7) can also affect FJs and are under-recognized as
causes of low back pain.
• Typical symptoms include pain on extension or rotation of the lower back. The
pain is often referred to the upper buttocks, is worse while standing still, and
eased by forward lumbar flexion.
• Facet hypertrophy itself cannot be felt, but true FJ syndrome is accompanied
by muscle spasm and superficial soft tissue tenderness.
• Arthritic FJs may be seen on oblique spinal radiographs; however, imaging in
general cannot reliably identify symptomatic FJs. FJ injection with anaesthetic
may confirm the diagnosis if this results in significant pain relief.

[SECTION]Table 21.3 Surgical approaches for lumbar disc prolapse

Discectomy

Essential for discs causing cauda equina syndrome and
progressive neurological deficits. Excluding above
indications, compared with conservative therapy, in a
randomized control trial (RCT) 66% vs 33% patients
were satisfied following surgery at 1 year, and 66% vs
51% were satisfied at 4 years; thus, benefit of surgery in
the long term is small. Adverse events with surgery
include mortality (<0.2%), dural tears (4%), and
permanent nerve root injuries (<1%). 70% success rate in
short term. Risk of failure from surgery relates to hysteria
or hypochondriasis scores on MMPI* and presence of
litigation claims

Microdiscectomy Smaller surgical field results in earlier mobilization and
less postoperative disability. Outcomes similar to those
of conventional discectomy from Cochrane review, 2014
Percutaneous
discectomy

Suctioning of central disc material causing disc
decompression and relieving nerve root pressure.
Associated with low complication rate and rapid
rehabilitation. Small RCT studies suggest similar
efficacy to discectomy and microdiscectomy

Chemonucleolysis Injection of proteolytic enzyme into disc. RCTs suggest
standard discectomy is superior. Rare, but devastating
neurological complications; risk of anaphylaxis (0.3%)
Laser lumbar
discectomy

Vaporizing of part of disc by laser through a needle
probe. Efficacy similar to discectomy. No RCT data

Prosthetic
Also, indicated for degenerative disc disease, postintervertebral disc laminectomy syndrome and non-specific persistent low
replacement
back pain. Artificial discs consist of two end-plates
separated by pliable inner core. RCT comparative studies
have shown a short-term benefit in ameliorating back
pain and long-term benefit in reducing leg pain,
compared with discectomy. Complication rate may be
high (up to 45%) and serious: discitis, re-herniation,
haematoma

[SECTION]* MMPI = Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.

Management of FJ arthritis/syndrome
• Patients can be treated according to principles applied for all patients with
acute mechanical back pain except that extensor exercises are contraindicated
as they will aggravate symptoms.
• Short courses of analgesics and/or NSAIDs as for OA.
• Generally, advise minimal bed rest.
• Steroid injection of FJs is frequently used, although studies have failed to
demonstrate benefit over placebo injection.
• Radiofrequency denervation of medial branches of dorsal rami supplying FJs
can help, but the procedure should only be considered if local anaesthetic
block works first.
Lumbar canal spinal stenosis
• The diagnosis is frequently missed in the elderly.
• It presents mainly with achy, stiff pains in the legs increased on walking and
easing if the patient stops walking, sits, or leans forward (neurogenic or
pseudo-claudication).
• Pain, numbness/tingling, and weakness are the most common symptoms.
Neurological leg signs can be accentuated after exercise.
• The diagnosis is made using MRI of the lumbar spine.
• Non-surgical management (including pain control and physical therapy) is
often adequate.
• Decompressive laminectomy is required for progressive neurological
symptoms, bladder dysfunction, or cauda equina syndrome.
Non-traumatic vertebral fracture
• A fragility (minimal or not) trauma vertebral fracture is usually due to
osteoporosis, collapse of an abnormal vertebra (e.g. vertebral haemangioma),
or secondary to malignancy or infection.
• The history should focus on identifying risk factors for these conditions. Postmenopause or hypogonadism, previous fracture history, steroid use, and
alcoholism may all contribute to osteoporosis.
• Weight loss or B-type symptoms may indicate the presence of malignancy or
infection.
• Kyphosis and loss of height can occur after vertebral fracture.
• A full examination should be done to evaluate the possibility of cord
compression or malignancy.

[SECTION]• Investigate with anteroposterior and lateral spinal radiographs, MRI, bone
biochemistry (bone profile, PTH), morning luteinizing hormone (LH) and free
testosterone, 25-OH vitamin D, CRP, thyroid function tests (TFTs), serum and
urine electrophoresis.
• MRI is good at discriminating infection and tumours from osteoporosis, and
can date fractures, but biopsy for histology and culture is essential if tumour or
infection has not been ruled out by MRI.
Management of non-traumatic vertebral fracture
• The patient should be carefully monitored for evolving neurological deficits
with a low threshold for MRI whole spine.
• Pain control often requires long-acting narcotics, with short-acting narcotics
for breakthrough pain as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs alone are
unlikely to be sufficient.
• Calcitonin 100–200 IU twice-daily SC or 200 IU/day by nasal spray has an
analgesic effect and reduces bone turnover in osteoporosis.
• Osteoporosis should be treated aggressively in due course (see Chapter 16)
but bisphosphonates should not be regarded to have/relied on to provide an
analgesic effect.
• Discuss any pathological malignancy-related fracture with a clinical
oncologist.
• Consider vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty where pain is uncontrolled by
analgesia.
Post-surgical back pain
• There are numerous causes and no single entity (Table 21.4).
• Post-surgical back pain presents a management challenge. A multi-disciplinary
approach is often need in providing optimization of analgesia, physical
therapy, behavioural modification via psychotherapy, use of nerve blocks,
epidurals, and spinal cord stimulators, radio-frequency ablation as well as
considering the need for re-operation.
• Some preoperative factors such as nerve root exit foraminal stenosis, smoking,
obesity, and pre-morbid psychiatric conditions can lead to higher prevalence of
post-surgical back pain.
• Imaging with gadolinium-enhanced MRI may be helpful to delineate
inflammatory tissue around the surgical site.
• Persistent pain after surgery may be associated with adverse psychological and
social factors, outstanding litigation, or insurance claims.
Non-septic discitis

[SECTION]• Inflammation of the intervertebral disc is often associated with annulus
enthesitis at the vertebral end-plates and vertebral osteitis.
• The causes include disc degeneration, CPPD disease, axSpA/ankylosing
spondylitis (‘romanus’ lesions) and other SpAs; also, SAPHO (see Chapter
16.
• The lesion should be identified with MRI and treatment should include
aggressive analgesia adjusted as tolerated.
• In RCTs, intradiscal steroid injections have been shown to be little help
overall. IV bisphosphonate (e.g. pamidronate 60–90 mg) has anecdotally been
shown to help the symptoms of axSpA and SAPHO discitis
(‘spondylodiscitis’).
Table 21.4 Implicated causes of post-surgical back pain

Recurrent
disease

Example: further disc protrusion and radicular features. If reoperation not appropriate consider nerve root block, steroid
epidural, etc.

Operation for MRI can show lesions, which may not be relevant to clinical
wrong lesion features. More than 1 or 2 lesions can coexist. Detailed
clinical assessment prior to imaging is essential
Misdiagnosis A structural lesion treated when an inflammatory disease,
originally
typically SpA-related disease, was present and causing
ongoing symptoms
Altered
Increased load burden over the adjacent structures, leading to
biomechanics accelerated degenerative changes in areas both above and
below the surgery. Also, altered biomechanics may
potentially result in increased tension over the pre-vertebral
and post-vertebral muscles, leading to stiffness, spasm, and
pain
Adverse
Resolution of symptoms and regaining functional capacity if
rehabilitation slow has been associated with significant psychological and
conditions
social factors. Poor result of surgery also associated with an
outstanding insurance claim or litigation
Arachnoiditis Thought to be a direct effect of surgery. Dural tissue becomes
inflamed. In nerve root/disc surgery often associated with
sensory root symptoms for some months afterwards.

[SECTION]Diagnosis with contrast-enhanced MRI. Where associated
with sensory radicular symptoms, may respond to steroid root
block, epidural. If radicular symptoms chronic and disabling
consider spinal cord (implanted) stimulator

Chronic back pain (adults)
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 published in The Lancet delineated
how MSK disorders are the second main cause of disability worldwide measured
by years lived with disability (YLDs). Low back pain was the leading
contributor to the YLDs attributable from MSK disorders.
• Further analysis demonstrated how low back pain was the sixth out of 291
causes of global burden of disease measured by disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs). In Western Europe, it is the first cause.
• In 2010, the global age-standardized prevalence of chronic back pain was
9.4%, with a higher rate in men (10.1%) than in women (8.7%).
• In Western Europe, the prevalence of low back pain was 15.5% in men and
14.5% in women.
• Managing chronic back pain requires an emphasis on psychological and social
management.
• Patients with chronic back pain are likely to have set beliefs about their
problem, the ability of healthcare systems to help them, and are more likely to
have developed coping strategies than patients with acute or subacute back
pain.
• People with chronic back pain who continually seek further and different
healthcare options are likely to have less successful coping strategies.
Initial approach to managing chronic low back pain
(See Table 21.5.)
• Be confident that there is no undiagnosed condition affecting back pain and
that no new neurological lesions have evolved. If examination raises concern,
use MRI to rule out lesions.
• Establish empathy and trust, taking time to get information about patients’:
• social situation.
• health and illness beliefs.
• intra-family dynamics.
• work and home role.
• perception of their role at work.

[SECTION]•

•

•
•

•

• view on conventional and complementary therapies.
• view on what does and doesn’t work.
• specific view of exercise therapy.
Plan the management approach with the patient and establish short- to midterm goals, including whether, and what type of, supervision is required (e.g.
graded programme of exercise) and how often a review is needed.
Consider ‘domains’ of therapy under the following headings:
• Physical therapy.
• Work/life commitments.
• Psychological and social support.
• Painkillers and medications.
• Education (insight and coping strategies).
Plan to review progress at regular intervals.
Evaluate patients carefully at baseline if considering long-term opiate use.
There may be an increased risk of dependency if the patient currently or
previously abused drugs, there is a high level of psychological distress, if
short-acting opiates are used, or drugs are prescribed ‘as needed’.
Although many strategies, especially those that combine techniques, can be
costly, these costs to healthcare are likely to be offset by the saving in lost
wages.

Exercises

RCT evidence supports use. Greater evidence of effect
when combined with behavioural methods. Aerobic
exercises augment effect of ‘back school’. Should be
essential part of outpatient physical retraining programme.
No difference in efficacy between individual or group
programmes

Manipulation

Trials show efficacy on pain in the long term

Transcutaneous Disappointing results from RCTs in chronic back pain,
electric nerve
although efficacy for other specific diagnoses are unknown
stimulation

Posture training May be more appropriate than corset use and easy to
combine training with supervised exercise therapy
Pilates

Low-level evidence for short-term benefit

[SECTION]Medications

Paracetamol, especially used in conjunction with opiates to
obtain a synergistic effect.
NSAIDs best for acute-on-chronic pain flares, for
regulating pain intensity, as shown by current RCTs.
COX2-selective NSAIDs may have better GI side effect
profile.
Systemic review and meta-analysis has demonstrated
efficacy of opiates in terms of pain reduction in the short
term. The medications can be delivered in a variety of
ways: oral, trans-dermal, and buccal. Chronic opiate use for
chronic low back pain has not been extensively studied. A
mental health evaluation before long-term prescribing is
essential to avoid triggering dependency (see text); short
courses, initially for a trial period, are sensible. Best
supervised by a specialist with experience in pain
management.
Low-dose tricyclics (e.g. amitriptyline, nortriptyline) are
useful particularly if chronic neuropathic pain is present.
Other neuropathic agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin,
and duloxetine can be used.
Muscle relaxants: diazepam has been shown to have shortterm benefits in acute-on-chronic exacerbations of back
pain. Evidence for eperisone is currently limited.
Topical lidocaine can be used as adjunctive treatment for
neuropathic pain, though as yet no clear evidence base.
Systemic anti-nerve growth factor agents: limited evidence,
experimental phase

Back school

Regular programme carrying an educational component.
Programmes vary from one to many sessions. May be more
effective in occupational setting. Non-compliance and
relapse are problems. Recent meta-analyses show
inconsistent results with regard to efficacy

Psychologyorientated
rehabilitation
programmes

Intensive courses often run by psychologists and ‘handsoff’ physical therapists can help (highly) selected patients.
Focus is on learning to cope with pain and increased
control of effects of pain on functioning and psyche. Not
suitable for many patients. Courses few and far between.
Cost-effectiveness of courses not proved. Good efficacy

[SECTION]compared to standard care, especially with work outcomes
Complementary Increasingly used. By consensus, chiropractic has been
therapies
shown to be helpful for chronic low back pain.
Acupuncture has yet to be proved successful in robust
studies. Poor evidence base otherwise
Epidural steroid Good level of evidence for short- and medium-term
injections
efficacy in reducing back and radicular leg pain.
Greater benefit established with regimen consisting of local
anaesthetic and steroid
Epidural
etanercept
therapy

Does not seem to have adverse events compared to placebo
but further studies needed to establish robust efficacy

Intrathecal
opiates

Conflicting results from (only) non-controlled studies.
Generally, results show overall short-term improvements
regarding pain perception, but not function. Best reserved
for patients where all else has failed

Spinal cord
stimulator
(SCS)

A number of good studies show that a SCS is effective for
neuropathic including radicular pain. Technique is
relatively safe. Careful patient selection is important.
Studies show 50% reduction in pain in the long term

Percutaneous
adhesiolysis

Robust evidence from RCTs demonstrating short- and longterm efficacy in diminishing chronic back pain and
improving functional impairment

[SECTION]Back pain in children and adolescents
Children with spinal problems present with deformity, back pain, limping,
systemic or neurological features, or a combination of effects.
• Back pain in adolescents is common— by 20y of age, occurs in up to 80%, but
is rare in children <8 years. Pain in a child <4y and pain requiring hospital
admission typically predict underlying pathology.
• Age determines the likelihood of cause, with infection and tumours being
more common in young children compared with adolescents (Table 21.6).
• The principles of history taking and examination in children are discussed in
Chapter 3, See pp. 154–155.
Non-specific low back pain
• The annual incidence is 13–24% in school children.
• Adolescent back pain is linked with familial clustering, physical inactivity,
sports injuries, and psychosocial factors.
• Particular risk factors from a recent birth cohort studies include female sex,
muscle deconditioning previous sports injuries, sleeping problems, and
persistent fatigue.
• Most children and adolescents have self-limiting symptoms.
• Management should focus on an explanation of the short natural history,
reassurance, addressing predisposing factors that remain a trigger for
recurrence and increasing exercise to improve muscle strength.
• Back pain associated with hyperlordosis and pain on lumbar extension of is
commonly associated with tight hamstrings or hip flexors, weak core and tense
paraspinal muscles with reduced forward flexion.
• A thorough assessment of gait, posture, core stability, limb strength and
muscle tightness will help direct physiotherapy-led home exercise plan.
Idiopathic scoliosis
The major form of idiopathic scoliosis is vertebral malalignment in the coronal
plane associated with spinal rotation accentuated on spinal flexion.
• Overall prevalence is reported to range from 0.5% to 5%, with the highest
prevalence within the 12–14 years age groups.
• About 70% are asymptomatic. The incidence of back pain is probably higher
than in the background population. Progression is more likely in the presence
of pain or thoracic curve convex to the left—conditions that should be
investigated for serious underlying spinal pathology.
• Potential interventions include scoliosis specific exercises, bracing, and
surgery. There is poor quality evidence for scoliosis-specific exercises as an

adjunctive treatment alongside other interventions.
Progressive scoliosis (Fig. 21.1) requires bracing or surgery. Usually curves of
25–45° are braced; rigid bracing seems to be superior compared to elastic
bracing.
A child with a curve >40° would be considered for surgical intervention.
Similar outcomes are achieved at short term follow up for both traditionally
open surgery versus minimally invasive procedures.
An MRI to look for tumour, syrinx, neural tethering or infection should be
done if there is a curve concave to the left and pain.
It’s important to differentiate the cause of scoliosis (e.g. biomechanical, posttraumatic, neuromuscular, metabolic, congenital, idiopathic).

Congenital and neuromuscular scoliosis
Congenital scoliosis (CS) is associated with genitourinary malformations (20%)
and, rarely, congenital heart disease. It is a rare condition, occurring in about 1 in
10,000 newborns. Neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) is associated with cerebral
palsy, muscular dystrophy, spinomuscular atrophy, and myelodysplasia.
• CS is associated with spinal dysraphism (20%), myelodysplasia, and Klippel–
Fiel syndrome.
• To avoid rapid progression and increased long-term morbidity and disability,
refer for prompt correction of progressive curves.

tilts to the concavity of curve; 2, the erect perpendicular to line 1; 3, the highest vertebra whose top tilts to
the concavity of curve; 4, the drop perpendicular to line 3; α, the intersecting angle. Curves less than 20° are
considered to be mild, 20–40° are moderate, and above 40° are severe.

Scheuermann’s osteochondritis
• This is perhaps the most common cause of spinal deformity in children and
adolescents (1–8% of all adolescents usually 13–17 years).
• The aetiology is unknown.
• Most cases are asymptomatic and present with concerns about the kyphosis.
Pain occurs over the apex of the deformity often related to activity or
prolonged sitting. Lumbar pain occurs with a compensatory hyperlordosis.
Tightness occurs in anterior shoulder muscles, hip flexors and hamstrings.
• The typical radiographic pattern is of mild wedge vertebral deformities (<10°)
of thoracic vertebrae and irregular end-plates.
• Delayed presentation occurs in adults either with (degenerative) back pains or
disclosed on a spinal radiograph as ‘vertebral fractures’ (erroneously—as the
wedge shape does not denote fracture).
Management

[SECTION]• Minor kyphosis is treated with an exercise program to increase flexibility of
trunk, hamstring and pectoral muscles, and is monitored with radiographs,
obtained periodically until skeletal maturity.
• Bracing is indicated for a kyphosis >55° or a thoracolumbar scoliosis >40° and
should continue until one year after fusion of the iliac apophyses. Surgery is
typically reserved for a thoracic kyphosis >70° or thoracolumbar scoliosis
>60°.
Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis
Spondylolysis is a defect in the pars inter-articularis, most commonly at L4 or
L5. Alone as a lesion it is common (4% preschool children and 6% <18 years). It
occurs in up to 15% of elite adolescent athletes.
• Spondylolysis is a risk factor for asymptomatic and symptomatic
spondylolisthesis (forward slip of a vertebra on the one below facilitated by
the bilateral spondylolysis. (Fig. 21.2)).
• Progressive slippage may occur during the adolescent growth spurt.
Management
• If the slip is >25% (grade II, III, or IV), then effective physical therapy is
important, to stabilise the spine (which is at risk of lumbar hyperextension)
before a return to sports.
• Advice should be given on regular abdominal muscle exercises, avoiding
gaining abdominal obesity, and consider regular bracing.
• Surgery is considered for progressive vertebral slippage or grade III/IV slip.
Herniated disc
Herniated discs are infrequent in children <11y, but disc protrusion affects up to
20% by 18y of age.
• How much pain can be attributed to the disc protrusion is often unclear.
Buttock or hip pain exacerbated by forward bend, cough or sneeze, or positive
leg raise, suggests pain is due to the disc protrusion.
Management
• Without nerve root impingement, management is conservative and includes a
short period of bed rest, adequate analgesics, and NSAIDs with early exercisebased rehabilitation regimen.
• Over 50% improve with conservative treatment, but reported results from
surgery for significant nerve root lesions, are very good.
Spinal tumours
• Although rare in children, spinal tumours present with night pain increasing in

[SECTION]intensity over time and associated with weight loss, radicular features, and
focal tenderness.
• Other typical (though not specific) features include painful scoliosis and
effectiveness of NSAIDs.
Management
• Radiographs (may be negative in early disease) and MRI are essential with
bone scintigraphy (+ SPECT) or CT to identify posterior element tumours (e.g.
osteoid osteoma).
• Adequate analgesia is required. NSAIDs: ibuprofen in recommended but doses
for weight may not be sufficient. Consider naproxen 15 mg/kg/day for
adolescents.
• Bed rest is not essential, although wise if scans suggest risk of vertebral
collapse or cord compression. If the latter, discuss urgently with a paediatric
spinal surgeon and radiotherapist-oncologist.
• Initiate a search for other tumours known to metastasize to spine (Box 21.1).
• Investigation within an adolescent unit is advisable given the specific
multidisciplinary input often needed.

Fig. 21.2 Spondylolisthesis measured as a % slip of L4 on L5 (α/β). Grade I <25%, grade II 25–50%, grade
III 50–75%, and grade IV >75%.

Box 21.1 Primary spinal tumours in children and adolescents
Osteoid osteoma
Benign. Not uncommon. Mainly adolescents. Posterior vertebral bone usually.
Pain can be severe. Discriminate from osteoblastomas by size (osteomas are
<1.5 cm, osteoblastomas >1.5 cm) as histology is often identical. Lesions are

[SECTION]associated with scoliosis (63%). Surgical excision is treatment of choice.
Aneurysmal bone cyst
Benign. Symptoms often triggered by vertebral collapse. Take care when
considering biopsy to discriminate from malignant lesions. Discuss in detail
with MSK radiologist.
Eosinophilic granuloma
Benign—often occurs around 10 years of age. Rare. Lytic. May occasionally
be multiple/disseminated—staging important. Symptoms often triggered by
vertebral collapse. Cord and radicular compression can occur. Biopsy essential
to discriminate from malignant lesions. Surgical excision or internal spine
fixation not usually needed. Consider radiotherapy if cord compression
threatened. Consider external brace fixation in all and monitor for
spontaneous resolution. Disseminated lesions can be treated with
chemotherapy.
Ewing sarcoma
Overall rarely affects spine (~10% cases). Can affect any part of spine
including sacrum (latter cases often delayed diagnosis). Suspicion of it
requires biopsy. Treat with combination chemotherapy and local radiotherapy.
5-year survival ~50%. Outcome better for tumour sizes <8 cm or localized
disease.
Leukaemia
Consider in all cases of spinal osteopenia or single/multiple vertebral collapse.
May be referred pain from hip and or pelvic lesions.
Notorious association with delayed diagnosis. Associated systemic symptoms
may not necessarily be present, but normal FBC at presentation unlikely
(~10% cases only). Also look for eosinophilia and hypercalcaemia, and
consider bone marrow aspirate.
Lymphoma
Rarely presents with back pain; however, known cause of persistent back pain.
MRI is imaging of choice: can show vertebral collapse and soft tissue
paraspinal mass. Biopsy is diagnostic. Case reports of plasmacytomas
presenting similarly.
Secondary malignant tumour
Neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumour, retinoblastoma, and
teratoblastoma are known to present with back pain. Positive biopsy should
trigger a search for the underlying primary neoplasm.

Pain
Introduction
Acute pain is a danger signal. Pain signals a ‘threat’ and stimulates a behavioural
response and memory to enable avoiding future ‘threat’. By nuanced contrast,
chronic pain is typically a maladaptive process of reporting such a ‘threat’.
• Pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as ‘an
unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or
potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage’.
• The pain neuropathway can be modified—either by amplification or damped
at various levels including peripherally—at the spinal cord and centrally.
Modifications may occur in response to a vast array of interpretive senses such
as beliefs, earlier life experiences, emotions, and emotional responses.
• The physiology and pathophysiology of pain is thus complex and it is best
viewed in the context of a neuromatrix rather than a pain nerve or a simple
gate theory.
• Chronic pain is considered a maladaptive sensation that both over-reports the
peripheral threat signals so typical of acute pain, and directly contributes to, or
may be the principal explanation for, the patient’s distress.
• Viewed another way, tissue damage or inflammation cannot explain the
presence or level of distress and effective pain management requires an
understanding of all factors that influence pain perception.

[SECTION]• It is now widely recognized that effective explanation of pain processing that
integrates the patient’s own experiences is in itself therapeutic and allows the
patient to build on the pain management strategies recommended.
• Chronic pain management strategies recognize the biopsychosocial model of
pain interpretation and are most effective when they integrate a
multidisciplinary approach targeting specific needs.
For ease of explanation, chronic pain syndromes have been sub-divided into
chronic widespread (or diffuse) pain (CWP) and regional (or focal) pain
syndromes. Pragmatically this helps with considerations of differential
diagnoses and targeting investigations effectively. Management strategies
often overlap.
Pain neurophysiology: peripheries
Noxious painful stimuli are detected in the periphery by nociceptors on primary
afferent neurons and transmitted to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
• Nociceptive primary afferents are specialized sensory neurons: either small
myelinated Aδ fibres or unmyelinated C fibres.
• These synapse mainly in lamina I and II of the spinal dorsal horn with spinal
second-order interneurons. This is also one of the principal sites of pain
amplification.
• It is possible that during inflammation, nociceptors may become activated at
lower thresholds than usual, thus giving a degree of peripheral sensitization.
Pain neurophysiology: central
The brain and spinal cord are responsible for central pain processing of noxious
stimuli transmitted from the periphery. Numerous areas (upwards of 700 centres)
within the brain influence pain perception.
• Nociceptive impulses ascend by two main spinal pathways.
• Information from Aδ fibres encodes ‘fast pain’ through the anterolateral
neospinothalamic tract (ALNT), which transmits pain and temperature and
discriminative qualities of pain: location, quality, and intensity of pain.
• This ALNT projects to the lateral thalamus with further connections to the
sensory cortex allowing pain localization.
• Information from C fibres encodes ‘slow pain’ transmitted through the more
primitive-origin spino-reticulo-diencephalic tract in the posterolateral cord.
This projects to the reticular system of the brainstem, thalamus, and
hypothalamus and onwards to the limbic system. These connections are

[SECTION]responsible for the affective, emotional aspects of pain.
• Connections to the sympathetic nervous system mediate arousal.
Theories of pain pathophysiology
Over the years, various theories have been proposed to try and explain the
complex nature of pain sensation and how this is modulated.
• René Descartes first postulated the existence of pain nerves which directly
transmit peripheral painful stimuli to the brain.
• The gate control theory of pain was put forward by Melzack and Wall. This
states that there is a gate in the spinal cord that influences pain transmission.
Non-noxious stimulation inhibits upward transmission of pain (closes the
gate), hence other stimuli affecting the same peripheral nerve distribution (e.g.
rubbing) reduces acute pain.
• Dissociation between peripheral stimuli and activation of the pain
neuromatrix, a process known as central sensitization, is thought to underlie
chronic pain that persists in the absence of tissue damage.

Pain’ delivered by the Neuro-orthopaedic Institute (

Generalized pain syndromes
Chronic widespread pain
Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is a common finding present in 5–10% of the
general population. In the absence of diffuse degenerative or
inflammatory/autoimmune rheumatic MSK, fibromyalgia (FM) is the
commonest manifestation.
• CWP affects women more than men with a ratio of 1.5:1 and is defined as pain
for >6 months in two or more sites both above and below the pelvis.
• CWP may present alone, may be misinterpreted as another condition, or may
be associated or complicate another condition.
• Conditions that can be associated with CWP or give rise to CWP as a
secondary effect are shown in Box 22.1.
• CWP is often associated with disturbed and unrefreshed sleep.
• People with CWP often have fatigue and many may ultimately be diagnosed
with chronic fatigue syndrome.
• Peripheral threat (/pain) signals will often be amplified by other threats

[SECTION]including anxiety, depression, and any other persistent or unresolved
psychological conflict. Assessment of these should be considered a normal
part of the history and should be considered sympathetically as contributory
but not the sole cause.

Fibromyalgia and ‘syndromic’ fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia (FM) is the term given to patients who have CWP that satisfies
classification criteria: either ACR 1990 criteria for FM or ACR 2010 criteria for
FM which expands the earlier criteria to include a wider spectrum of symptoms
and their severity (‘syndromic’ FM or FM syndrome).
History of use of the term fibromyalgia
FM is a type of CWP that has the cardinal feature of sleep disturbance.
Historically this was previously labelled as muscular rheumatism or fibrositis to
describe a condition with pain, fatigue, and psychological involvement.
• Both FM and CWP are often associated with other somatic symptoms, such as
chronic fatigue, IBS, multiple chemical sensitivities, and headache syndromes.
Other causes of fatigue should always be excluded, e.g. hypothyroidism,
hypoadrenalism, primary Sjögren’s syndrome and anaemia (Box 22.1).
• Both CWP and FM are associated with alterations in peripheral and central
pain processing. Painful stimuli are detected at lower levels in affected
patients. Allodynia (pain in response to non-painful stimuli) found in these

[SECTION]conditions is thought to be due to central sensitization and an ‘amplification’
phenomenon.
Diagnosis of FM
There are two classification criteria for FM (ACR 1990 and ACR 2010 criteria).
The 1990 criteria require diffuse tenderness at discrete anatomical sites. The
2010 criteria are based on mood, pain, and sleep disturbance. The 2010 criteria
are designed to provide an alternative method of classification to allow longterm follow-up of FM patients and a method of evaluating the symptom severity
of FM.
• Many FM tender points (Box 22.2) are over entheses which are scored for pain
in enthesitis indices when assessing SpA conditions. It is of exceptional
importance that SpA is distinguished from FM. Of course, both may coexist.
An enthesitis predominant form of psoriatic arthritis is not uncommon (see
CASPAR criteria for diagnosis of PsA in Chapter 8).
• FM is also found in up to 25% of patients with RA (see Chapter 5), and SLE
(see
Chapter 10). It is also commonly found in association with
hypermobility spectrum disorders and hypermobility-EDS ( Chapter 19).
• Care must be taken to avoid misdiagnosing CWP/FM as the only cause for
pain when there is an AICTD, axSpA, or PsA present.
• FM cases tend to aggregate within families but no genetic contribution has
been defined as yet. It is implausible that genetic influences will not eventually
be defined; thus common environmental triggers should be considered.
• The 2010 criteria for classification of FM are shown in Box 22.3.
Box 22.2 ACR 1990 criteria for diagnosis of fibromyalgia
1. History of widespread chronic pain
Pain is considered widespread and chronic when all of the following are
present:
• Pain in the left and right side of the body
• Pain above and below the waist
• Axial skeletal pain
• Pain present for 3 months
and
2. Pain in at least 11/18 tender point sites on digital palpation with 4 kg
pressure*. One point is given for each side of the body at the following
9 sites:

[SECTION]1. Occiput: at the suboccipital muscle insertions
2. Low cervical: at the anterior aspects of the inter-transverse spaces at
C5–C7
3. Trapezius: at the midpoint of the upper border
4. Supraspinatus: at origins above scapula spine near medial border
5. 2nd rib: at 2nd costochondral junction
6. Lateral humeral epicondyles: 2 cm distal from epicondyles
7. Gluteal: in upper outer quadrants
8. Greater trochanter: posterior to trochanter
9. Knees: at medial fat pad proximal to joint line
* Positive tender point when subject says palpation was painful, (‘tender’ is not considered painful).
FM is said to be present when both criteria (CWP and tender point count) are satisfied. FM is not
excluded by the presence of another disorder.
Criteria taken from Wolfe F et al. The American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for the
Classification of Fibromyalgia. Arthritis and Rheumatism 1990;33(2):160–72.

Box 22.3 ACR (revised) 2010 fibromyalgia criteria
A patient satisfies criteria for FM if the following three criteria are met:
1. Widespread pain index (WPI) ≥7 and a symptom severity (SS) scale score
of ≥5 or WPI 3–6 and SS scale score ≥9.
2. Symptoms have been present at a similar level for ≥3 months.
3. The patient does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the
symptoms.
WPI = the number of areas in the last week where there has been pain (score
0–19): left and right—shoulder girdle, upper arm, lower arm, ‘hip’
(buttock/trochanter), upper leg, lower leg, jaw. Also: upper back, lower back,
chest, abdomen, neck.
SS scale score (0–12) is calculated by:
Scoring each of these 3 symptoms: waking unrefreshed, fatigue, and cognitive
symptoms, on a scale of 0–3 where:
0= no problem
1= slight or mild problems, generally mild or intermittent

[SECTION]2= moderate, considerable problems, often present and/or at a moderate level
3= severe: pervasive, continuous, life-disturbing problems.
And adding
a score for the extent (severity) of somatic symptoms* where:
0= no symptoms
1= few symptoms
2= a moderate number of symptoms
3= a great deal of symptoms.
* Somatic symptoms that might be considered: muscle pain, IBS, fatigue/tiredness, thinking or
remembering problem, muscle weakness, headache, pain/cramps in the abdomen, numbness/tingling,
dizziness, insomnia, depression, constipation, pain in the upper abdomen, nausea nervousness, chest
pain, blurred vision, fever, diarrhoea, dry mouth, itching, wheezing, Raynaud’s, hives, welts, ringing in
ears, vomiting, heartburn, oral ulcers, loss of/change in taste, seizures, dry eyes, short of breath, loss of
appetite, rash, sun sensitivity, hearing difficulties, easy bruising, hair loss, frequent urination, painful
urination, bladder spasms.

Management of CWP and fibromyalgia
The ultimate goal of pain rehabilitation is to improve quality of life and sense of
well-being rather than focus on pain reduction. With improvement in factors
such as sleep or anxiety and improvements in physical activity and general
participation, distraction from pain is improved and the overall sense of threat
reduced. This will in turn reduce the volume of pain signal.1
Management issue 1: explanation and reassurance
It is of paramount importance to consider carefully the way in which an
explanation is given as to the nature of the condition. This may take some time
and may be best approached in the context of a multidisciplinary team
(psychologists, physiotherapists, OTs, doctors).
• It is important to assess the effect of symptoms on the patient’s life, and
develop a good rapport so psychosocial issues can be discussed.
• The emphasis in the explanation should be reassurance that there is no serious
underlying inflammatory or systemic condition, that nothing has been missed,
and there is no damage to the joints and muscles. This fear blocks engagement
with explanations and undermines rehabilitation strategies.
• Effective explanation uses appropriate language and stories to help the patient
understand:
• more about the complexity of pain processing and why it goes wrong.

[SECTION]• why there isn’t a quick switch to turn it off.
• why a return to activities and routines including normalization of sleep
helps.
• why there needs to be a change in coping strategies.
• Explanations also challenge the value of ongoing litigation and it may be
necessary to wait for this to be resolved before beginning a pain management
programme
• Education of family and partners is invariably helpful and often essential.
• Both CWP/FM are conditions with relapses and remissions. Most patients will
have ongoing symptoms. Patients with appropriate coping strategies,
improvements in psychosocial stressors, and good social support networks are
more likely to have a better outcome.
Management issue 2: symptom management
Often people with CWP limit activity due to a fear of provoking more pain. In
addition to addressing physical symptoms such as pain and fatigue,
psychological input (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy) is helpful in providing
tools to manage pain and activity levels.
• Although exercise may cause a short-term increase in pain, a graded exercise
programme has been shown to be beneficial.
• Low-impact exercise, such as Pilates may be helpful. Pilates is helpful because
it:
• requires control avoiding jarring and unpredictable movements.
• works all individual muscle groups including those that have become weak
from previous unhelpful patterns of muscle use.
• is tiring and releases endorphins.
• encourages effective stretching.
• builds confidence and resilience.
• A physiotherapist should help support and guide engagement with Pilates,
yoga, and gym classes and may indicate what specific activity might be
avoided in the first instance.
• Pacing of activities is important, avoiding ‘boom and bust’ patterns of overactivity when feeling well, followed by periods of inactivity due to subsequent
pain and fatigue.
• Cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs) provide a small incremental benefit
over control interventions in reducing pain, negative mood and disability at the
end of treatment and at long-term follow-up in FM.2
• Lack of adequate forms of sleep reduces resilience and promotes pain
amplification. Poor sleep is one of the major barriers to improvement and is

[SECTION]tackled at the outset of most pain programmes.
• Sleep disturbance needs to be addressed through sleep hygiene measures (e.g.
have a quiet bedroom, reduce light and noise where possible, avoid eating late,
reducing caffeine intake in the evening).

Management issue 3: pharmacological therapy
The role of medication is to help establish and reinforce good sleep routines,
reduce anxiety and fear of pain, and where possible allow improvements in pain
severity to allow engagement with pain programme recommendations. Many of
the techniques learnt in psychological-based treatment strategies help with this,
reducing the reliance on often unhelpful pain medications.
• NSAIDs and GCs are not effective and may cause morbidity due to side
effects.
• Narcotics should be avoided.
• Many patients will have tried analgesics with little effect. This in itself can
fuel anxiety as to the cause and severity of their underlying condition, and
frustration and lack of confidence in their doctor.
• Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (10–50 mg 2 hours before
bedtime) are often helpful in embedding changes to sleep routines and
improving quality of sleep, decreasing morning stiffness, and alleviating pain.
• Patients should be warned of side effects of tricyclics such as dry mouth, selflimiting morning somnolence and weariness, and that they may take 3–4
weeks to take effect.
• Patients are often also wary of being given an ‘antidepressant’. An explanation
that a tricyclic is being used as a modifier of the impact of pain is important to
improve adherence. Amitriptyline is one of a group of drugs that increase 5hydroxytryptamine.
• Amitriptyline can be used with tramadol and this combination may be helpful
in those with severe exacerbations or waves of pain.
• The efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is debated
given variable evidence of efficacy. The use of fluoxetine, duloxetine
sertraline, or citalopram improves mood and anxiety, but SSRIs may be less
effective than tricyclics in treating pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.
• Venlafaxine (a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) in high doses is
effective in treating multiple symptoms in FM. Low-dose treatment is
ineffective.

[SECTION]• Pregabalin has shown efficacy on pain in some studies and can be combined
effectively with duloxetine.3
• Sedative hypnotics have been reported to improve sleep in severe
circumstances.
• A recent meta-analysis of RCTs4 showed that duloxetine 60 mg, pregabalin
300 mg, milnacipran 100 mg, and 200 mg were more efficacious than placebo.
However, there was no significant difference in the efficacy and tolerability
between the medications at the recommended doses.
• Overall however, when treatments are judged against quite strict criteria for
improvement there is not strong evidence for efficacy.4
• The conclusion from the meta-analysis report4 was: ‘The available data
regarding efficacy . . . (treating pain, sleep, physical function, fatigue, anxiety,
depression, and cognition) . . . were insufficient to draw definite conclusions . .
. (regarding response of FM patients to reported treatment modalities). . . .
Indirect evidence indicates that efficacy may be expected with the use of
serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), noradrenaline reuptake
inhibitors (NRIs), and multidisciplinary treatment. . . .’
• A number of meta-analyses of drug therapies are available in the Cochrane
Library ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cochranelibrary).

Localized pain syndromes
Localized pain syndromes are chronic pain conditions in a defined area. The
diagnosis of a localized pain syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion given
conditions that can present with similar features. Often there is underlying
neuropathic pain and abnormal neural activity.
Chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS)
General considerations

[SECTION]CRPS is characterized by variable dysfunction of the MSK, skin, neurological,
and vascular systems. CRPS may occur in a variety of situations with a number
of clinical manifestations varying around central core features.
• Several terms have evolved, describing aspects of the same condition: reflex
sympathetic dystrophy, Sudeck’s atrophy, shoulder–hand syndrome, and
transient osteoporosis.
• These terms have been superseded by the term CRPS, which is recognized by
the International Association for the Study of Pain.
• There are two subtypes of CRPS: type 1 describes symptoms in the absence of
peripheral nerve injury, and type 2 (‘causalgia’) in the presence of injury to a
specific peripheral nerve.
Epidemiology and aetiology
CRPS is a common disorder. It affects both sexes equally, and occurs at any age
in all races and geographical regions. Although the exact aetiology is unclear,
there is likely to be a combination of peripheral and central neurological factors
involved.
• Trauma (e.g. fracture, burn, surgery, etc.) is the most common triggering event.
The event may be trivial. Often no cause is identified.
• CRPS is reported in up to a third of series of distal forearm fracture.
• Several neurological conditions may act as triggers, including, for example,
hemiplegia and meningitis. Peripheral nerve root injury may also lead to the
syndrome.
• Pregnancy, tumours, and prolonged immobilization have also been linked as
possible triggering factors. However, 25% of cases have no clear trigger.
• It is important to try and identify psychosocial stresses as these may have an
effect on the persistence of symptoms.
Clinical features
Typically, the syndrome involves the distal part of a limb, e.g. forearm or foot.
Early clinical features of the condition include pain, soft tissue swelling (e.g.
may be synovitis if over a joint), reticular/livedo rash, warmth over affected part.
Occasionally there may be localized, sweating and piloerection.
• The pain has several particular characteristics and is often described as
‘burning’. The features include:
• allodynia—an otherwise innocuous stimulus produces pain.
• hyperalgesia—increased pain perception to a given stimulus.
• hyperpathia—delayed over-reaction, often after repetitive cutaneous
stimulus.

[SECTION]• The affected limb is often guarded to avoid any contact as allodynia is usually
extreme.
• Novel clinical signs described in recent years support involvement of the CNS
and MRI studies show evidence of cortical reorganization. These clinical signs
include digit misperception, astereognosis, altered hand laterality, and
abnormal body schema.
• Patients become ‘depersonalized’ from their affected limb with a feeling that it
no longer belongs to them and a desire to remove that limb.
Investigation, staging, and diagnosis
Clinical suspicion and knowledge, and a good history and examination will
make the diagnosis of CRPS in all cases, but it is important to recognize changes
that may occur in some radiological and functional imaging. These tests may be
misinterpreted in other settings and may help with explanations with patients.
• Laboratory tests need to be interpreted cautiously. ESR, CRP, and FBC
abnormalities may be present if there is underlying inflammatory rheumatic
MSK disease.
• However, there may be evidence of bone demineralization (osteopenia on
radiographs, CT or low bone density estimated using regional DXA) if the
lesion is severe.
• High bone resorption can be indicated biochemically by hypercalciuria
(hypercalcaemia would be very unlikely), and raised plasma/serum collagen
crosslinks (e.g. CTX).
• Thermography can demonstrate changes in cutaneous temperature.
• Perhaps of most value, and high specificity, is the triple-phase bone
scintigraphy (99mTc-MDP scintigraphy).
• An experienced nuclear medicine physician can specify CRPS based on
characteristic patterns of bone scintigraphy abnormality in the early regional
blood flow distribution, blood pool appearances, and late skeletal radionuclide
uptake.
• CRPS stage I is essentially regional pain and swelling. In most cases, the
symptoms fluctuate, then gradually resolve.
• Stage II CRPS is a period of dystrophic change (see Plate 10). This tends to
occur several months after onset of the disorder. The affected region becomes
cool, pale, and often cyanosed in colour with abnormal sensation
(dysesthesia).
• Stage III CRPS is manifest by a decrease in hair and nail growth, osteopenia,
and eventually atrophy of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Stage III CRPS is
difficult to treat and reverse.

[SECTION]• Most cases of CRPS tend not to progress beyond stage I, or at most early stage
II.
• The Budapest criteria for diagnosis of CRPS are shown in Table 22.1.
Table 22.1. The Budapest criteria for diagnosis of CRPS. For a diagnosis of CRPS, all four criteria (A–
D) must be met

Criteria

A: continuing pain disproportionate to the inciting event and
B: ≥1 symptom in ≥3 categories (below)
and
C: ≥1 sign in ≥2 categories (below)
and
D: no other diagnosis better explains the symptoms and signs

Categories Sensory: allodynia (to light touch and/or temperature sensation
and/or deep somatic pressure and/or joint movement) and/or
hyperalgesia (to pinprick)
Vasomotor: temperature asymmetry (>1°C) and/or skin colour
asymmetry between limbs
Sudomotor/oedema: oedema and/or sweating changes and/or
sweating asymmetry
Motor/trophic: decreased range of motion and/or motor
dysfunction (weakness, tremor, dystonia) and/or trophic tissue
changes (hair, nail, skin)
Management of CRPS
Success treating CRPS relies on an early and accurate diagnosis and early
treatment in order to prevent chronicity.
• Once CRPS persists beyond 6–8 months, it is difficult to reverse.
• Early and ongoing treatment should focus on the whole individual and not
simply the regional symptoms.
• Treatment is based around the broad categories of physical therapies
(physiotherapy and desensitization therapy), psychological therapies
(cognitive behavioural techniques), and pharmacotherapy.
• Attention to anxiety, psychosocial stressors, pain behaviour, and sleep
disturbance is important.
• Patients often require repeated reassurance and counselling.

[SECTION]• The aim should be to resume premorbid levels of activity so early physical
therapy (/hydrotherapy) input should be considered.
• Desensitization therapy of the affected region can help to normalize the
sensations of hyperalgesia and allodynia.
• Desensitization is achieved by applying different textures to the affected area,
concentrating particularly on the interface between normal and abnormal
sensations.
• Mirror therapy to reflect the unaffected limb while performing synchronized
movements can also help in regaining function and range of movement and
relieving pain.
• In early acute disease, IV pamidronate may be helpful in relieving pain,
especially if there are bony changes on imaging. Short courses of
glucocrticoids (GCs) may also be helpful in the acute stages.
• Tricyclic antidepressants can help correct sleep disturbance and increase the
pain threshold.
• Gabapentin or pregabalin may also be of value.
• Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may help pain control and
allow entry into a physical activity programme.
• In some severe cases, regional sympathetic or ganglion blocks have been
reported to control pain sufficiently to facilitate engagement with pain
management programmes.
• Patients may request limb amputation as a result of their depersonalization
from that limb. However, this should be discouraged as it does not guarantee
improvement in pain and such patients may suffer with intractable phantom
limb pain.
Other adult regional pain syndromes
Post-herpetic neuralgia
This neuropathic pain condition develops in a dermatomal distribution following
an episode of herpes zoster. It is defined as pain that continues for 3 months
following an attack of herpes zoster. Typically, the neuralgia begins as the
vesicles start to heal and crust over.
• Pain can be variable in severity and is neuropathic in nature.
• Antivirals such as aciclovir are often used at the beginning of an attack of
herpes zoster to limit the duration of the attack and reduce the chances of
developing post-herpetic neuralgia. However, these are not useful in
established disease.
• Treatment includes anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and gabapentin as
well as tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline.

[SECTION]• Ganglion regional nerve blocks can be considered for severe cases.
• Analgesics such as paracetamol, anti-inflammatories, and opioids may all be
helpful in managing pain.
• Short courses of GCs are often used to reduce the duration of pain.
• Conservative measures that may be helpful are TENS, acupuncture, relaxation
techniques, and heat/cold therapy.
Trigeminal neuralgia
This is a type of neuropathic pain affecting the trigeminal nerve and causing
intense facial pain along the trigeminal nerve divisions. There are two main
types: typical and atypical trigeminal neuralgia.
• The typical form causes attacks of severe sudden pain on one side of the face
which can last for seconds to minutes while the atypical form causes constant
burning pain.
• The exact aetiology is unknown but is thought to be due to loss of the myelin
nerve sheath.
• Treatment is with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and tricyclics such
as amitriptyline. Opioids are usually not effective.
• Surgery may be an option if conservative measures fail.
Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction
The most important feature of TMJ dysfunction is pain and restricted mandibular
opening.
• There is often clicking associated with movement of the joint.
• About 20–30% of the general population have some degree of TMJ
dysfunction.
• There is a link to the habit of teeth grinding so often prosthetic mouth guards
are fashioned to wear particularly at night.
• The TMJ can be affected in all inflammatory arthritides such as RA and PsA
and such causes should always be considered as an underlying cause of TMJ
pain.

Chronic pain in children and adolescents
Introduction
In childhood and adolescence, pain is a ubiquitous experience affecting over
80% of individuals in any given preceding 3–6-month period. As in adults, this
threat, or danger, sensation is associated with neuroendocrine, MSK, and
inflammatory responses, and provokes threat appraisal and behavioural

[SECTION]adaptation that may be attentive or avoidant.
• Prevalence rates of chronic (recurrent or persistent) pain in children and
adolescents are high (11–38%) with 5% experiencing significant pain-related
dysfunction.
• Chronic pain affects most body sites with a prevalence that increases with age
(see Table 22.2)

• Over 10% of all GP contacts with adolescents are attributable to MSK pain
and of those seeking medical intervention the direct cost to the USA is $19
billion.
• Although the international criteria for chronicity is 3 months’ duration
(constant or intermittent), taken from the definition in adults, a diagnosis can
often be made sooner.
• On careful enquiry the site, character, and severity of pain, and any loss of
function, are often incongruous with the mechanism of any injury or
background disease state (JIA, sickle, IBD, etc.) and this frequently overrides
the relevance of duration.
Associations of chronic pain in children and adolescents
Most chronic MSK pain might reasonably be attributed to biomechanical
imbalances and stresses that typically result from tissue tightness and changes in
patterns of muscle use with normal growth and development.
• Inappropriate patterns of muscle use may also derive from previous injury,
repetitive sport or dance activities, or commonly from deconditioning when
sedentary behaviour predominates.
• Other common associations with chronic pain and pain amplification include

[SECTION]obesity, poor sleep health, lower socioeconomic status, parental
catastrophizing, risk aversion, thought and attention problems, anxiety, low
mood, rule breaking, aggressive behaviour and hypermobile joints, but the
extent to which these factors are contributory in childhood vary.
• Pain in multiple sites, including chest, abdomen, and head, is strongly
associated with obesity in girls and a high number of psychosocial and
mechanical factors.
• Multiple MSK pains in adolescence have a high tendency to persist (>2 years)
with both psychosocial factors and lifestyle factors contributing to this
vulnerability.
Chronic widespread pain in children and adolescents
The diagnosis term chronic widespread pain (CWP) is preferred to juvenile FM
or joint hypermobility syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorder or other labels
which intimate poorly established aetiologies, have overlapping diagnostic
criteria, marked heterogeneity, and may unnecessarily inculcate (or trap) patients
into an expectation of lifelong disability.
• Due to variation in diagnostic labels and criteria, the epidemiology of CWP is
poorly understood.
• The prevalence of juvenile fibromyalgia (JFM), defined by ACR criteria for
adults (chronic MSK pain, multiple discrete tender points, fatigue, and sleep
disturbance), is up to 6%.
• JFM accounts for 8% of diagnoses made by paediatric rheumatologists. The
prevalence of joint hypermobility syndrome in children diagnosed with JFM is
probably the same as in the general paediatric population.
• Enigmatic symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, blurring of vision, ‘black outs’, and
tachycardia occur in 50% of children and adolescents with CWP and might
reasonably be attributable to variations in ‘threat signalling’ and may be
exacerbated by anxiety.
• Labels of ‘postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome’ PoTS, ‘autonomic
dysfunction,’ or ‘chronic Lyme disease’ are usually unhelpful and most of the
clinical symptoms resolve with effective explanation and engagement in a
rehabilitative programme.
• CWP may be triggered by or coexist in 5–20% of cases with an underlying
disorder such as sickle cell disease, heart disease, or cancer. CWP in the
presence of a SpA condition requires careful disentangling as enthesitis linked
to SpA may be present (see Chapter 8).
Management of CWP: general principles

[SECTION]• Irrespective of the medical setting there is always a potential to positively
intervene, beginning with recognition of a primary pain disorder and making
time for the patient to explain their history, the impact, and their
understanding.
• The therapeutic consult acknowledges the pain and explains the role of pain as
a threat signal.
• Further explanations about pain processing, in appropriate language, should
assist an understanding to promote engagement in the treatment strategies
described in the next subsection and reduce a sense of helplessness.
• Effective explanations of pain are therapeutic and can be enormously
motivational.
• In particular, there should be an understanding of disruptions to the ‘4Ss’
(sleep, sports/physical activity, social life, and school).
• A focus on returning to normal 4S routines should improve resilience and
improve quality of life, with consequent reductions in the psychological
impact of pain and enhanced biofeedback to counteract pain signals.
Programmes of care for CWP
• Effective programmes of care target an appropriate amount of resource to the
level of need.
• Integration across a network of services is often required with community and
secondary care services working with a tertiary hub.
• The focus of care is to return to normal function with an incident decrease in
pain.
• Core features of a programme of care include:
• adequate explanation about pain and rehabilitation.
• an interdisciplinary and goal-orientated approach with a specific focus on
self-management.
• medication used to enhance engagement with advice and other selfmanagement strategies.
• Pain workshops inform and educate in an engaging way, dispel myths, and
create a narrative that helps to increase participation and improvements in
quality of life despite minimal changes levels of pain. Workshops also provide
the benefit of peer support.
• Physical therapies such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy treatment
strategies are most effective when goal oriented.
• Physiotherapists help to reduce the fear of movement and guide the patient
through a programme of exercise and increase participation in general
physical activity.

[SECTION]• Physiotherapy promotes resilience, as well as reducing muscle tightness and
building strength, stamina, balance, and normal patterns of muscle use.
• Occupational therapists support upper limb physical activity, a graded return
to school, sleep advice, management of bullying and a return to an active
social life.
• Physiotherapists often support such re-engagement with regaining normal
4S function too.
Psychological therapies for CWP
• Psychological intervention now draws from an array of treatment strategies in
addition to CBT.
• Effective psychology programmes include a focus on resilience and promotion
of patient strengths in addition to reducing barriers to engagement and coping
modification.
• A Cochrane review in 2014 showed psychological treatments are effective in
reducing pain intensity and disability in various forms of CWP and the
benefits appear to be maintained.
• Evidence for the effects of psychological therapies on mood is limited as it is
for effects on disability in children with headache.
Active mind–body techniques
• Techniques are useful in promoting self-management.
• Techniques include breathing strategies (square breathing, diaphragmatic and
slow exhale breathing), mindfulness, yoga, Pilates, and progressive muscle
relaxation. This is not an exclusive list and the benefit varies between patients.
Parent coaching
• A child or adolescent in pain exerts a considerable emotional, and often
financial, toll on family life.
• Pain-related disability is more consistently related to poor family functioning
than pain intensity.
• Parenting behaviours can act to maintain or even enhance their child’s pain
experience; e.g. if the child has to interpret ambiguous emotional parental
expressions.
• There is a risk of increased anxiety and depression for a child of a parent with
CWP. Familial dysfunction can follow.
• Normalizing parental protectiveness reduces guilt and defensiveness and
refocuses parents’ attention on healthy and adaptive behaviours.
• Parents are taught how to calm themselves and use skills to distract and avoid
emotional escalation. A focus should be maintained on their child’s function

[SECTION]and participation.
• Parents’ pain experiences should be addressed and discussed openly with the
child present. It should be clearly pointed out that the child’s pain is different
from the parent’s disability and pain, with an expectation that the child can
become pain free.
• Parents are taught how to optimize the independence of teenagers and
encourage self-management skills.
Pharmacotherapy in CWP
• There is little evidence to support the sole use of medication but it may have a
role in the integrated management plan described here.
• There are no RCTs which confirm the benefit of paracetamol in treating
paediatric CWP but there is some limited evidence for ibuprofen although both
are associated with potential long-term side effects including overuse
headaches.
• Opiates should be avoided in primary pain disorders due to poor safety and
side effect profiles associated with worse outcomes.
• Care should be taken with opiate use when IBD or sickle cell disease is
associated with a primary pain disorder.
• Codeine has been withdrawn from the WHO pain ladder for children.
• Adjuvant therapies including low-dose tricyclic antidepressants,
gabapentinoids, SSRIs, and melatonin may be helpful.
• There are no RCTs which support the use of gabapentin in treating paediatric
CWP, and its use may result in cognitive impairment and reduced resilience.
• The anxiolytic effects of tricyclics and SSRIs may help to improve
engagement with management strategies and resilience from improving sleep.
• Medication is associated with a strong placebo effect in CWP. For example, in
various RCTs for migraine therapies, a placebo response is typically seen in
50–60% of study participants and can decrease headache frequency from six to
three headaches/month.

Complex regional pain syndrome in children and
adolescents
CRPS is clinically distinct from adult CRPS in that the lower limb is more
commonly involved than the upper limb, there is a marked female
predominance, dystrophic changes and long-term disability are less common,
and multiple limbs can typically become involved.
• The peak incidence is in early adolescence (median 13 years).

[SECTION]• MRI shows increased bone signal (‘oedema’) early in the condition.
• Thermography highlights abnormal regional blood flow changes, which can be
compared to the other limbs.
• Later in the disease radiographs show osteopenia.
• Ultimately, limb deformity occurs in the most severe cases.
Management of CRPS
• Effective management of CRPS requires a careful explanation of the condition
to the child or adolescent and their family, a graded exercise programme
supervised by a therapist experienced in chronic pain management, and
frequent desensitization.
• Work on restoring normal 4S function improves resilience and most patients
respond within 4–6 therapy sessions. Patients can expect to become pain free
and return to all activities.
• 25–35% of children and adolescents with CRPS are resistant to routine
management techniques and will benefit from more intense programmes of
care as described for CWP (see , ‘Chronic widespread pain’, pp. 639–641).

Pain relief
General considerations
The descriptors and assessment of the impact of pain are discussed in Chapters
1 and 22. Good pain management is associated with improvement in various
physiological and psychological outcome measures.
• In general, pain management may be broadly divided into pharmacological
and non-pharmacological methods. The individual description of each nonpharmacological method is beyond the scope of this chapter but may include
the following:
• Hot/cold/pressure compress.
• Physical therapies—land based and hydrotherapy.
• Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).
• Acupuncture.
• Hypnosis.
• Cognitive and behavioural therapy (CBT).
• Pulsed radiofrequency and nerve ablation therapies.
• Low-level laser therapy (LLLT).
• Massage, relaxation therapy, and meditation.
• Other complementary medicine methods.
• Effective pain management must begin with a thorough assessment of the
patient’s pain, treatment expectations, and concerns.
• Unrealistic expectations or misunderstanding of pain could mean that the
management strategy may fail from the beginning.
• In chronic painful conditions please refer to Chapter 22. Patients should be
aware that there might be a period of trial and error before the optimal
combination of pain relief is found although in many circumstances
medication may be unhelpful.
• In assessing efficacy of an oral analgesic, it is important to consider:
• the analgesic effect.
• the frequency and maximum dose tried.
• any unwanted side effects.
• If there was temporary relief that then wore off, this may be due to either an

[SECTION]•
•

•

•

•

insufficient dose, or the interval between doses is too long.
Unpleasant side effects may also put patients off some medications.
Patients may use the term ‘addiction’ to express concerns over the long-term
use of analgesics, in particular, opioid-based pain relief. If such concerns are
not addressed, patients may be reluctant to take opioids regularly which in turn
leads to poor pain control.
Rather than ‘substance abuse’, the patient is most likely reflecting on the
possibility of ‘tolerance,’ when citing ‘addiction’, i.e. ‘becoming used to’ the
analgesic so that a higher dose is required to sustain the effect over time. This
often needs clarification during consultation.
Abuse of opioids—addiction or recreational use and deliberate self-harm by
overdosing—is a legitimate cause for concern.
The safety and suitability of these agents are very much dependent on
assessment of the individual patient.
Follow-up appointments are important to allow both the patient and the
clinician to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment regimen and to then make the
necessary adjustments.
There is very little high-quality evidence for the use of analgaesia in paediatric
pain.

Analgesic escalation: the ‘analgesic ladder’
The WHO analgesic ladder (Fig. 23.1) is a useful framework to consider when
commencing patients on pharmacological pain treatment. But see also more
specific guides for managing and prescribing strong analgesics in chronic pain
(e.g.
SIGN-136:
www.sign.ac.uk;
and
at
CDC:
www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm).
• Escalation of pain relief modality follows a stepwise approach depending on
the assessment of the severity of pain.
• Movement up the analgesic ladder is a balancing act between increasing
analgesic potency versus increasing risk of side effects.

[SECTION]Fig. 23.1 WHO analgesic ladder. Reprinted from WHO’s cancer pain ladder for adults, Copyright (2014)
http://www.who.int/cancer/palliative/painladder/en/. Accessed May 2017.

• At the bottom of the ladder (Step 1) are non-opioid compounds with relatively
good safety profile such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs). These are effective for mild to moderate pain severity.
• Step 2 involves adding in weak opioids such as tramadol or codeine phosphate
for pain of moderate severity, although codeine is no longer included in the
WHO ladder for pain relief in children. This is because children are variable
metabolisers of codeine, leading to an unpredictable effect. Codeine should not
be used in chronic pain in long term paediatric conditions.
• If long term opioid use is to be maintained consider converting to sustainedrelease form as a basal analgesia. This is supplemented with instant-release
opioid for breakthrough pain. Caution should be taken when using opioids in
long term paediatric conditions and alternative strategies to pain management
should be sought.
• Opioids used for an extended period lead to tolerance, create physical
dependency, and should not be withdrawn abruptly.
• If an episode of acute pain is superimposed upon chronic pain requiring
regular strong opioids, any analgesia prescribed should be in addition to the
regular opioid regimen.
• Some analgesics, when taken together, have a synergistic effect that is greater
than the sum of its individual effects. It makes sense therefore to have a
compound form (e.g. co-codamol which contains codeine and paracetamol).

[SECTION]• A compound agent may be easier for the patient to manage by reducing the
number of separate pills to ingest. However, the ability to alter the dose of one
of the component agents without altering the other is lost. There is also the
additional risk of patients double dosing on a medication from failure to
recognize the active components of the drug (e.g. taking co-codamol and
paracetamol together).
• Clear advice on the options for increasing dose according to tolerability and
efficacy should be given, including the principle of starting at the lowest dose
whenever possible (particularly in the elderly). Clear guidance puts the patient
in control of their pain relief.
Simple and compound analgesics
Paracetamol (acetaminophen)
Paracetamol is thought to reduce pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis
within thecentral nervous system. It has both analgesic and antipyretic activity
without anti-inflammatory activity.
• It is available over the counter in many countries and is effective in managing
soft tissue injury, joint pain, dental pain, and headache.
• It is usually given orally at 4 g/day (children 30–60mg/kg/day; max 4g) given
in 4 divided doses. It is also available in suppository and IV formulations.
• It is reasonable to try paracetamol first. Most GPs will and it is important to
assure the patient of its efficacy. The specialist may hear patients say ‘my GP
just gave me paracetamol’.
• Common concerns and interactions are shown in Table 23.2.

Paracetamol compounds
• Paracetamol 500 mg is also available in compound analgesics, such as cocodamol (paracetamol and codeine), co-dydramol (paracetamol and
dihydrocodeine), and paracetamol and tramadol. These are not recommended
in chronic paediatric conditions.
• Care should always be taken, as with ‘over-the-counter’ aspirin products and
other NSAIDs, that patients ensure they do not take more than the maximum
daily dose of paracetamol, irrespective of the combination of single and
compound medications used together.
• The codeine content varies in these formulations between 10, 15, and 30 mg
per tablet to a maximum total daily dose of 240 mg divided into 8 tablets and
taken as 2 tablets four times a day.
• Codeine is discussed later under opioid analgesics.
• Because of safety concerns (related to toxicity in overdose) co-proxamol
(paracetamol and dextropropoxyphene) is only available in the UK by special
arrangement on a named-patient basis.
Opioid analgesics
Opioid drugs act as agonists at opioid receptors which are found mainly in the
brain and spinal cord and also peripherally.
• For all opioid drugs, there are numerous cautions (See Table 23.3) and care
should be taken in all chronic conditions, especially in children.

Commonly used weak opioids: codeine and dihydrocodeine
• Codeine and dihydrocodeine (also available as modified release) can be used
as a single agent to maximum daily adult dosage of 240 mg (usually 2 × 30 mg
tablets four times a day). It is available in 15 mg or 30 mg tablets.
• It is also available in compound agents with paracetamol as described earlier
and with ibuprofen or aspirin.
• Codeine is marketed in various salt compounds including phosphate and
sulfate (typical in the USA, Canada, and UK), hydrochloride (continental
Europe), hydro-iodide, and citrate.
• Low-dose codeine is available ‘over the counter’ in some countries and is also
found in cough suppressants. In the majority of countries however, it remains
prescription only due to concerns over dependency and misuse. Its use is still

[SECTION]classed as illegal in a few places. Travellers with legitimate prescriptions are
advised to carry documentation of their condition from their physician.
• Cimetidine, acting as a P450 enzyme inhibitor, increases plasma concentration
of codeine and dihydrocodeine.
• Metoclopramide and domperidone are antagonized by codeine and
dihydrocodeine.
Tramadol and meptazinol
Tramadol is a weak opioid agonist. It inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin and
norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at the dorsal horn.
• The maximum recommended adult dose is 400 mg/day in divided doses. It is
available in modified-release 12-hourly preparations (200 mg twice daily) and
in combination with paracetamol.
• Meptazinol is a partial opioid receptor antagonist and is given at 800 mg/day
in divided doses. Its mixed effect reduces the risk of dependence and is less
likely to be used as a substance of abuse.
• These agents are often tried after or instead of codeine compounds given the
difference in mechanisms of action.
• They have a more favourable gastrointestinal (GI) side effect profile than
codeine and may be one of the reasons for trying them before codeine in those
prone to constipation. However, this is offset by a greater risk of intolerance
from neuropsychiatric effects.
Commonly used strong opioids
These include morphine sulfate and oxycodone hydrochloride 5–10 mg, both 4–
6-hourly (can be titrated up to 400 mg per day in severe cases); the latter also has
a compound of oxycodone/naloxone, which may be beneficial in those with
severe constipation from opioids despite trials of different classes of laxative.
Thereafter, escalation might move to morphine salts, but before any of these are
utilized it is common to try patch formulations.
Opioids delivered through transdermal patches
These are applied to the skin and, therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned
cautions, be aware of allergic reaction with localized sensitivity.
• Buprenorphine (also available in the UK as Temgesic® 200 micrograms
sublingual) is produced as BuTrans® and Transtec®. Both have formulations
that allow a wide variety of dosing, e.g. BuTrans 5 micrograms/hour 7-day
patch, gradually building dose, perhaps every 2 weeks depending on tolerance
and response of symptoms.

[SECTION]Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
NSAIDs are commonly used. Most have a licensed indication for OA (see
Chapter 6) and RA (see
Chapter 5); some have a licence for ankylosing
spondylitis (see Chapter 8).
• In reality, most NSAIDs are prescribed in effect ‘off licence’ for a number of
rheumatic conditions outside these diagnoses, but based on being effective
analgesics with the capacity to reduce inflammation such as occurs in soft
tissues, tendonitis, and synovitis.
• NSAIDs are classified by their inhibitory action on cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1), e.g. ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac, or COX-2, e.g. celecoxib and
etoricoxib. Some agents (e.g. oxicams) demonstrate inhibitory action against
both enzyme pathways.
• It is reasonable to try a NSAID from a different class when another has failed.
• Ibuprofen and aspirin compounds are available over the counter in many
countries. Naproxen (250–500 mg twice daily) and diclofenac (150 mg daily
in divided doses) probably represent the two most commonly prescribed
NSAIDs worldwide.
• COX-2 inhibitors are discussed later in this section.
• Oral preparations are most often used. Some are available as slow-release
formulations, e.g. diclofenac.
• Although per rectum agents are also available in some, these do not appear to
reduce side effect (specifically gastric) enough to warrant their preference over
oral agents in the majority of cases.
• Topical agents have variable efficacy, often with limited evidence of benefit.
That said, they are popular with patients as part of their management.
• Paediatric dosing includes: Ibuprofen 10mg/kg 4-6 times daily; naproxen 10–
20mg/kg/day in 2–3 divided doses; diclofenac 3–5mg/kg/day in 2–3 divided
doses.
Adverse effects of NSAIDs
A number of adverse reactions are recognized. Caution applies to all NSAIDs,
particularly avoiding their use in hepatic and renal impairment, pregnancy, and
GI ulceration (Table 23.4).
• Using the lowest possible dose for the shortest period of time lessens the
adverse effects risk of NSAIDs. It is inevitable, however, that those with longterm conditions for which remission is less than optimal will require long-term
therapy.
• While cardiovascular complications occur, many patients with cardiovascular
disease and risk factors use NSAIDs, particularly if the benefit is considered to

[SECTION]•
•

•

•
•

outweigh the risk (e.g. improved function/exercise tolerance encourages a
healthier lifestyle).
It is imperative that blood pressure and renal function are monitored regularly
(preferably every 3 months).
The highest risk of cardiovascular complications is with diclofenac, COX-2
NSAIDs, and high-dose ibuprofen (2.4 g daily). The lowest risk is with
naproxen (1 g daily) and ibuprofen (1.2 g or less daily).
It is not uncommon for individuals to also be on aspirin for its platelet
inhibitory function.
All NSAIDs are contraindicated in severe heart failure.
GI risks are documented in Table 23.4.
The highest GI risk is seen with piroxicam and ketoprofen; intermediate risk
with diclofenac, etodolac, indometacin, naproxen, and oxicams; and the lowest
risk with ibuprofen.
In renal disease, NSAIDs should be used with caution and avoided if possible.
NSAIDs can induce acute kidney injury, as well as exacerbate chronic
impairment. The ‘rule of thumb’ of lowest possible dose for shortest possible
period of time applies.
NSAIDs can exacerbate asthma; however, it should not be an absolute
contraindication to prescribing.
Many patients may well have inadvertently tried aspirin and ibuprofen overthe-counter compounds without complication. The clinician may therefore
gain some sense of tolerability. The decision to prescribe should always be
based on the severity and responsiveness/stability of asthma in each
individual.

NSAID cautions: sDMARD co-prescribing
• Concern is often expressed over the co-administration of sDMARDs and
NSAIDs. Toxicity monitoring is a fundamental responsibility when managing
sDMARDs.
• sDMARD monitoring applies irrespective of NSAID use.
• In principle, as disease comes under control on sDMARDs it is appropriate to
reduce the frequency of NSAID use if possible.
NSAID cautions: pregnancy and breastfeeding
It is generally advised that NSAIDs should be avoided in pregnancy unless the
benefits to well-being significantly outweigh the risk.
• NSAIDs can be used with caution in the first and second trimester but should
be avoided in the third trimester due to the added risk including closure of the

[SECTION]fetal ductus arteriosus in utero, delay in onset, and an increase in the duration
of labour. In addition, pulmonary hypertension may affect the newborn infant.
• In some cases, studies show concentrations of certain NSAIDs to be too low in
breast milk to warrant concern. In general, manufacturers advise avoiding
NSAIDs for the duration of breastfeeding.
• Low-dose aspirin may be continued throughout pregnancy but high-dose
aspirin should be avoided.
• There are limited data for COX-2 inhibitors, which have been shown to be
teratogenic in animal studies and hence these should be avoided in pregnancy
and breastfeeding.

[SECTION]Aspirin
• As the prototype NSAID, aspirin is available in single and compound
formulations over the counter. While it is rarely prescribed as an NSAID, it is
important to acknowledge its availability, as well as its common use in lower
dosage (75–150 mg daily) as a cardio-protective agent, when prescribing other
NSAIDs, and advising on side effects and drug interactions.
• For analgesic effect, aspirin is dosed at 300–900 mg four times a day
(maximum adult dose 4 g/day). It is available in oral and suppository
formulations.
• Low-dose aspirin may be continued throughout pregnancy but high-dose
aspirin should be avoided.
• Aspirin is avoided in children under the age of 16 years (except for cardiac
conditions such as Kawasaki Disease) due to the risk of Reye syndrome.
Oxicams
• This group of NSAIDs was developed for their longer half-life.
• Meloxicam (7.5–15 mg daily) and piroxicam (20 mg daily) are the two most
commonly used agents.
• Piroxicam has a relatively high relative toxicity:efficacy ratio for GI adverse
effects compared with other NSAIDs.
Coxibs/COX-2 inhibitors
• These agents were introduced because of their efficacy and selective COX-2
inhibition, recognizing the value of preserving COX-1 ‘protective’ enzyme
activity, particularly in relation to GI tolerability.
• However, large-scale phase III control trials, an integral part of modern
pharmacological practice and essential in seeking approval for a licence,
demonstrated an appreciable cardiovascular risk. As a consequence, several
COX-2 drugs (e.g. rofecoxib) have been withdrawn.
• Celecoxib (100–200 mg twice daily) and etoricoxib (30–120 mg once daily)
are available in Europe. Celecoxib is available in the USA. In 2007, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) voted not to approve etoricoxib.
• Regular blood pressure monitoring is required.
Antidepressants
Several antidepressants are used in the management of pain, usually as a single
agent given at bedtime, sometimes in combination with other drugs using
different mechanisms of action, and often at lower doses than typically used for

[SECTION]controlling depression. There is no compelling evidence for their use in chronic
paediatric pain.
• There is often a need to explain to patients that these drugs are being used for
pain control and not for depression, even if there is a degree of reactivedepression present as a consequence of chronic pain.
• Educating the patient and explaining the mechanisms of action (blocking pain
messages from travelling up the spinal cord and modifying the response to
pain in the midbrain), one can gain greater compliance and enhance the
clinician–patient relationship.
• A detailed exploration of the mechanisms is beyond the scope of this book, but
most agents are thought to have a dual effect by modifying responsiveness of
spinal opioid receptors, and changing mood and perception centrally.
• These agents are perhaps most logically used when pain disturbs sleep. A mild
sedative and relaxant effect may also be beneficial.
Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
Tricyclics
Tricyclics are predominantly serotonin and/or norepinephrine re-uptake
inhibitors. The ‘typical’ agents in this group include amitriptyline, clomipramine,
imipramine, and dosulepin.
• Amitriptyline is the agent most frequently used (although sometimes
nortriptyline is better tolerated). Given at doses up to 75 mg/day taken before
bedtime, it is often titrated from a baseline of 10–25 mg in 10 mg steps
gradually until a balance between maximum efficacy and tolerability is
reached.
• Common side effects and interactions are shown in Table 23.5.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
• This group includes fluoxetine (20–40 mg once daily), sertraline (50 mg once
daily), and paroxetine (20 mg once daily).
• Randomized control trials in fibromyalgia (FM; see
Chapter 22)
demonstrate SSRI efficacy similar to 25 mg amitriptyline; however, the
average impact on pain reduction and quality of life is only about 15–20% and,
as such, these agents are probably not suitable candidates as analgesics when
used in isolation. The side effect profile in Table 23.5 applies.
Mixed serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
• Increasing interest in the complexities of central pain pathways and the action
of SNRIs has led to several studies demonstrating SNRI efficacy in FM (see

[SECTION]Chapter 22).
Table 23.5 Cautions and side effects of serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors

Caution

Comment

Sedative

Care needed when used with other potentially sedating
agent. Note: CNS toxic effects of tramadol can be
enhanced (serotonin syndrome). Also note caution with
driving or using machinery

Antimuscarinic
action

Caution in those with ocular (closed-angle glaucoma),
genitourinary (retention, prostatic hypertrophy), dry
eyes/mouth, constipation

Cardiovascular

Risk of dysrhythmias especially ventricular (e.g. increased
with concomitant use of sotalol and amiodarone)

Hypotension

Increased risk in patients on diuretics

Thyroid disease

Amitriptyline enhances effects of thyroid drugs

Epilepsy

Amitriptyline antagonizes antiepileptics reducing the
threshold for seizures

Sexual
dysfunction

Sexual dysfunction may occur.

Hyponatraemia

Usually in the elderly and possibly due to inappropriate
secretion of antidiuretic hormones.

Hepatic
impairment

Try to avoid in severe liver disease—risk of sedation

Pregnancy and
breastfeeding

Avoid unless being used for psychiatric reasons and in the
best interests of well-being

Neuropsychiatric Induction of hallucinations, delusions, (hypo)mania,
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and suicidal behaviour
Motor function

Tremor/extrapyramidal signs

Endocrine

Breast enlargement, galactorrhoea

• The FDA (USA) approved duloxetine (2008) and milnacipran (2009) for

[SECTION]treatment of FM in adults. Neither is approved for use in children.
• Duloxetine is given as 60–120 mg daily and milnacipran at 100 mg twice
daily. Side effects include nausea, headache, insomnia, dizziness, constipation,
hepatic dysfunction, hyponatraemia, and orthostatic hypotension (duloxetine)
and hypertension (milnacipran).
• Like all antidepressants duloxetine carries a warning highlighting an increased
risk of suicide, especially in children and young adults.
• Tramadol should not be co-administered with duloxetine; there is a risk of
developing serotonin syndrome. Through cytochrome P450 enzyme system
interactions, duloxetine may prolong opioid effects.
Other adjuvant analgesics
Gabapentin and its analogue pregabalin (both structural analogues of γaminobutyric acid (GABA)), has been shown to have efficacy, particularly in
studies of FM (see Chapter 22), although the NNT is 9 and there is a high
incidence of side effects. There is no compelling evidence for their use in
chronic pain in children and adolescents.
Gabapentin
• Dose: oral, titrated from 300 mg daily to maximum 3600 mg daily in divided
doses, e.g. 300 mg once daily on day 1, then 300 mg twice daily on day 2, then
300 mg 3 times daily on day 3, then increased according to response and
tolerability in increment of 300 mg daily every 2–3 days to maximum dose of
3600 mg daily.
• Dose needs to be reduced in renal impairment according to GFR.
• Side effects: dizziness/light-headedness, oedema, weight gain, and
sedation/mental impairment. Other concerns include leucopenia, ataxia,
Stevens–Johnson syndrome, hepatitis, and pancreatitis.
• Avoid during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
• Discontinuation has to be done gradually over minimum of 1 week.
Pregabalin
• Dose: oral, titrated after 3–7 days from 150 mg to maximum 600 mg daily in
2–3 divided doses.
• Dose needs to be reduced in renal impairment according to GFR.
• Side effects: dizziness/light-headedness, oedema, weight gain, and
sedation/mental impairment. Other concerns include visual disturbance,
neutropenia, ataxia, arrhythmia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and pancreatitis.
• Avoid during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
• Discontinuation has to be done gradually over minimum of 1 week.

[SECTION]Muscle relaxants
The most likely agent to consider is diazepam, a benzodiazepine.
• Given at doses of 2–5 mg three times a day for up to 14 days diazepam can be
helpful in alleviating acute severe pain associated with spasm, particularly
across the neck and shoulder girdle, and the lumbar spine.
• Diazepam should be avoided in hepatic and renal impairment, pregnancy, and
breastfeeding.
• As with opioids, care should be taken to counsel the patient over perceived
risk of dependency of benzodiazepines, and prescription should be avoided if
there are any concerns over potential abuse.
• Drugs such as baclofen, dantrolene, methocarbamol, and tizanidine usually sit
within the realm of the neurologist and may be valuable in controlling muscle
spasm and pain in conditions such as stroke and multiple sclerosis. Where
indicated, the rheumatologist should seek advice from a neurologist if spasm
pain is considered to be the consequence of a neurological condition.
• Quinine sulfate is often used in doses of 200–300 mg to control cramps. It
should be prescribed with caution in patients with arrhythmia and avoided or
dose halved in hepatic and renal impairment.
• Quinine sulfate is contraindicated in haemoglobinuria, myasthenia gravis,
optic neuritis, and tinnitus; and it may be teratogenic (certainly in higher
dosage) in the first trimester of pregnancy, but safe during breastfeeding.
Topical agents
• The most common classes to be used (excluding opioid transcutaneous
delivery by patch) include a variety of ‘over-the-counter’ preparations
(rubefacients), NSAIDs, and capsaicin.
• Capsaicin is an active component of chili peppers. It is licensed to treat postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. It can be considered an adjunct to
treating OA. One risk is a severe burning and irritation if contact is made with
mucous membranes, including the lips and conjunctiva. Hand-washing after
use should be meticulous.
• Capsaicin is prescribed as a 45 g tube of 0.025% or 0.075% concentration, to
be applied twice daily in the smallest of volume; literally a tiny amount
squeezed onto the tip of the little finger and then rubbed in over the site of
pain.

Glucocorticoids
Glucocorticoids (GCs; ‘steroids’) are powerful anti-inflammatories and range in

[SECTION]use from short duration of low and high dosage to gain control of a condition
(including intra-articular; see
Chapter 24), through to prolonged and even
lifelong therapy.
Commonly used GCs are prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and
triamcinolone. Disease-specific indications and dosing regimens are stated in
each relevant chapter of this book.
Table 23.6 highlights the major and common cautions and concerns that
should be monitored and discussed with the patient. Patients on long-term GC
treatment should be encouraged to hold a steroid treatment card or some form of
alert bracelet, etc.
Table 23.6 Cautions and complications of glucocorticoid use

Caution

Comment

Adrenal
insufficiency

Long-term use can lead to adrenal atrophy
Abrupt withdrawal should be avoided
Replacement (even higher dosing) should be given during
surgery, inter-current illness (especially associated
vomiting)

Diabetes

Induction and exacerbation of hyperglycaemia

Hypokalaemia

Can cause hypokalaemia

Infection

GCs are immunosuppressive—there is an increased
susceptibility to infections and severity of infections
especially after prolonged use
Live viral immunization should be avoided
Exposure to chickenpox or measles leading to concern
over significant infection should be managed with
passive immunoglobulin
May expose latent TB

Neuropsychiatric Can induce mania, confusion, delirium, and suicidal
thoughts—can occur early after starting corticosteroid (3–
5 days on average) and take several weeks to resolve
having discontinued therapy
Weight gain

This may be either as a consequence of peripheral oedema
or increased appetite—patients should be warned to be
careful of this and to use tricks like drinks of water to

[SECTION]reduce sense of hunger
Skin

Long-term use leads to atrophy and bruising

Eyes

Increased risk of cataracts and glaucoma

Cardiovascular

Induction and exacerbation of hypertension and
congestive cardiac failure

Peptic ulceration
Bone and muscle Induction and exacerbation of osteoporosis
Growth retardation
Myopathy
Osteonecrosis
Pregnancy

GCs can be used or continued if indicated—preferably
lowest dose possible. No evidence of teratogenic effects;
occasional neonatal adrenal suppression which usually
resolves spontaneously

Breastfeeding

Doses of prednisolone up to 40 mg daily are unlikely to
result in systemic effect in infants

Glucocorticoid interactions
• Because of the tendency for GCs to increase blood pressure, the effect of
antihypertensives may be blunted. Monitoring is key.
• Barbiturates and antiepileptics increase the metabolism of GCs.
• Diuretics may be antagonized by GCs.
• Erythromycin and azoles may inhibit the metabolism of GCs thus increasing
their effect.
• GCs may amplify the severity of NSAIDs peptic ulceration risk.
• GCs may increase the risk of bone marrow suppression with methotrexate
(MTX).
• GCs in combination with theophylline increases hypokalaemia risk.
• GCs may increase or decrease the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.

Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) are the cornerstone of
disease management aimed at the slowing or arrest and remission of chronic
inflammatory rheumatic disease. For additional detail see also Chapter 5 (RA)

[SECTION]and Chapter 8 (SpAs). Terminology can be confusing since the introduction of
‘biologics’, which are also ‘disease-modifying’. A new nomenclature of
DMARD terminology has been proposed by Smolen et al.1:
• Firstly: ‘synthetic DMARDs’, which are subdivided into conventional
synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), i.e. traditional DMARDs, and targeted
synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), which are oral synthetic drugs designed to
target a particular molecular structure.
• Secondly: ‘biologic DMARDs’ (bDMARDs), which are subdivided into
biologic original DMARDs (boDMARDs) and biosimilar DMARDs
(bsDMARDs).
• At the time of writing it is unknown whether this proposed nomenclature will
be generally accepted. In this book we have mainly used the terminology
sDMARDs and bDMARDs, and have avoided introducing the other terms
extensively, with the exception being this chapter with the distinction being
made clear in the following subsections.
Conventional synthetic DMARDs
General considerations
Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) are slow-acting drugs that take
8–12 weeks to begin to demonstrate benefit, and even then, possibly longer to
achieve maximum benefit as the dose is escalated (typically >6 months). Patients
should always be informed of this, clarifying expectations and improving
compliance.
• It is not uncommon for combinations of csDMARDs to be used either by
sequential ‘step up’ (adding one after the other over time) or ‘step down’
(starting with two or three, and reducing to one over time).
• In the UK, it is unlikely that more than three csDMARDs would be used since
the introduction of bDMARDs: UK guidance allows use of bDMARDs after
failure of at least two csDMARDs (see later).
• The most common drugs used are: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), leflunomide
(LEF), MTX, and sulfasalazine (SSZ).
• Of these drugs, MTX is probably the drug of first choice for most conditions
(e.g. RA, PsA, JIA) at doses of 7.5–30 mg weekly.
• csDMARDs are not without their toxicity and the protean complications and
monitoring requirements can seem daunting.
• Tables 23.7–23.10 describe principles applicable to all csDMARDs.
• Advice on immunization and risk assessment of viral infection is shown in
Box 23.1.

[SECTION]• General monitoring of csDMARDs—see Table 23.7 (please refer to Box 23.2
for common side effects to assess for, at every blood test check and clinical
review).
• Common csDMARD side effects and advice on initial action to be taken—see
Box 23.2.
• Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding—see Table 23.10.
• All csDMARDs should be used with caution in hepatic and renal impairment,
blood dyscrasias (including suspected or known G6PD deficiency and
porphyria), recurrent infection, and in the elderly.
Box 23.1 Immunization and assessment of infection risk before
commencing csDMARDs
Disclaimer: all readers should refer to their own local practice guidelines.
Information here is incomplete and brief and a skeleton guide only.
• In some circumstances it may be appropriate to give live vaccines to
patients on DMARDs. Refer to local guidelines. (e.g. oral polio, BCG,
MMR, yellow fever).
• Patients should receive the pneumococcal vaccine.
• Annual flu vaccination is recommended.
• Patients exposed to chickenpox (who have no clear history of chicken pox
in the past) or to shingles, should receive passive immunization using
varicella zoster immunoglobulin.
• Patients should be screened for hepatitis B and C risk by history, and, if
required, serum antibodies.
• Patients should be assessed for risk of HIV and tested if applicable.
• Patients should be assessed for risk of active/latent TB.
csDMARD management for surgery and during infective illness
• csDMARDs do not need to be discontinued before surgery though some
surgeons/surgical specialties request csDMARDs are discontinued. There is a
lack overall of robust data as few randomized trials have been undertaken.
• If the surgeon wishes csDMARDs to be stopped then, as a ‘rule of thumb’, it is
reasonable to discontinue for 2 weeks before and up to 2 weeks after surgery.
• It is not possible to predict the risk of a flare of inflammation during this
period, although many patients report a level of tolerance for up to 4 weeks.
• csDMARDs are discontinued during severe infective illness if there is concern
their immunosuppressant effect outweighs the risk of a disease flare.

See published guidelines, e.g. at British Society of Rheumatology:
http://www.rheumatology.org.uk/resources/guidelines/default.aspx

Family planning, pregnancy and breastfeeding, while taking csDMARDs
• Some csDMARDs can be taken reasonably safely while pregnant and
breastfeeding; see guidelines (e.g. BSR guideline on prescribing for pregnancy
and
breastfeeding
can
be
found
at:
http://www.rheumatology.org.uk/resources/guidelines/default.aspx).
• Table 23.8 shows specific regimens advised before trying to conceive, and
which drugs to avoid during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
• LEF should be stopped 2 years before trying to conceive, or ‘washed’ out as
described later in this section (see ‘Leflunomide’, p. 670).
• Advice on use of analgesics and GCs in pregnancy and breastfeeding is given
in the previous sections.
Malignancy risk with csDMARDs
• Establishing the risk of malignancy from csDMARDs is challenging owing to
the excess incidence of malignancy in some of the conditions being treated and
a lack of ‘real-world’ data of csDMARD use.
• MMF, CYC, and AZA are associated with increased incidence of malignancy
but SSZ, HCQ, MTX, and LEF are probably not.
Shared care information on csDMARDs and their use
• It is essential that the patient receives information and advice on csDMARDs
and their primary care physician has access to correspondence from the
prescribing clinician and results of monitoring.
• It is essential that there is clarity over the roles and responsibilities of the
prescribing and primary/community clinicians and the patient.
• Various guidelines on csDMARD monitoring exist (e.g. see UK BSR
guidelines
2017
at:

[SECTION]http://www.rheumatology.org.uk/resources/guidelines/default.aspx).
• Box 23.2 broadly outlines management of csDMARD side effects.
Box 23.2 csDMARD monitoring and side effects management
Disclaimer: all readers should refer to their own local practice guidelines.
Information here is incomplete and brief and a skeleton guide only.
• Abnormal AST or ALT. Stop csDMARD if enzyme level > twice upper limit
of normal. As with all blood indices listed below, repeat weekly until
normalized.
• Abnormal leucocyte count. Stop csDMARD if neutrophils <1.5 × 109/L, or
if steep downward trend in count, and assess for infection. With eosinophilia
>0.5 × 109/L, increased vigilance required but may be unassociated atopy.
• Low platelets. Stop csDMARD if platelet count <100 × 109/L or serial
results show significant trend downwards.
• Abnormal bruising. Check clotting screen and platelets urgently. If
abnormal withhold csDMARD immediately. Bruises are common in
children.
• Abnormal MCV. If MCV >110 fL, check folate, vitamin B12, TSH, and for
excess alcohol intake. MCV+ may be an effect of AZA, MTX, SSZ, or
allopurinol
• Proteinuria. Send urine for microscopy/culture + treat infection. Quantify
proteinuria, check creatinine, U&E, exclude haematuria + urinary casts and
obtaining ‘KUB’ ultrasound. Consider withdrawing csDMARD.
• Note: proteinuria may indicate worsening disease so stopping the
csDMARD may be inappropriate.
• Rash. If mild in adults, drop csDMARD dose. If moderate/severe, then stop
csDMARD. Rashes are common in children but advice may be sought.
• Mucosal ulceration. Consider cause of ulceration and add folate (for MTX)
and adjust dose if persistent. If severe consider trial off csDMARD.
• Hair loss. Consider cause of alopecia and adjust dose if persistent. A trial
off treatment may be appropriate but hair growth may not recover for ≥1
hair cycle, i.e. several months.
• Hypertension. If mild rise, may respond to small drop in csDMARD dose or
leave alone and monitor. If moderate to severe, treat hypertension first (see
advice for ciclosporin on dose reduction).
• Weight loss. Consider the cause of weight loss and reduce the dose or stop
for a trial period depending on the severity.
• Dyspnoea. Chest exam + CXR. Treat infection and cardiac failure. If

[SECTION]pulmonary fibrosis suspected stop csDMARD and arrange further
investigation.
• Advisable actions if stopping a csDMARD. Repeat blood test after 1 or 2
weeks. Assess for any recent change in medication, alcohol consumption,
illness, csDMARD dosing error. Treat disease ‘flare’ with GCs. If trend
downwards in laboratory indices, then csDMARD should be reviewed
irrespective of laboratory value. Once abnormalities return to normal, start
csDMARD at a lower dose, or switch to a new csDMARD, and in both
cases return to the early monitoring phase.
Azathioprine
Azathioprine (AZA) is prescribed for a number of autoinflammatory and
autoimmune conditions. AZA inhibits purine synthesis by generating
thioguanine nucleotides from its metabolite: 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP).
• The typical dose of AZA is 0.5–1 mg/kg/day orally in twice-daily divided
doses, increasing after 4–6 weeks to 2–3 mg/kg/day with an anticipated
response within 6–12 weeks.
• Thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) activity status can be checked before
AZA is started:
• 99% of people will have high or intermediate TPMT levels and be at low
risk of AZA toxicity (from slow AZA clearance).
• In a TPMT deficiency homozygous state (0.3% of population (1:300)) it
may be fatal—toxicity occurring in the first 6 weeks.
• In the heterozygous state (10% of population), there may be delayed (up to 6
months), but usually reversible, bone marrow toxicity.
• Although measurement of TPMT is advised in guidelines, it may be
impractical so close FBC monitoring in the first 6–12 weeks of treatment is
imperative.
• AZA can cause a photosensitivity reaction—patients should be advised to wear
sunscreens and protective covering.
• AZA has some specific drug interactions:
• Allopurinol: AZA dose should be reduced to 0.25–0.5 mg/kg/day.
• Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: co-prescription may
exacerbate anaemia.
• Anticonvulsants: AZA may reduce absorption.
• Aminosalicylates: (mesalazine (ME)/SSZ): increase risk of bone marrow
toxicity.
• Ciclosporin: AZA can decrease ciclosporin levels.

[SECTION]• Co-trimoxazole/trimethoprim: bone marrow toxicity.
• Warfarin: AZA inhibits anticoagulant effects.
Ciclosporin
Ciclosporin is considered in PsA, RA, AICTDs, uveitis, and MAS. It is a
calcineurin inhibitor and has a fairly selective action on lymphocytes: blocking
mitosis and inhibiting lymphokine release.
• Ciclosporin dose is typically 2.5 mg/kg/day orally in twice-daily doses for 6
weeks, then may be increased at 4-weekly intervals in 25 mg increments up to
a maximum of 4 mg/kg/day. Response in <12 weeks.
• Pre-monitoring (Table 23.8) should include fasting lipids, repeated 6-monthly
and the drug discontinued if an uncontrollable significant rise in lipids occurs.
• Monitoring includes checking creatinine clearance/GFR. A rise in creatinine
>30% above baseline on two consecutive readings 7 days apart warrants
stopping the drug and reassessing.
• It is essential that blood pressure monitoring be commenced at baseline. If
uncontrollable hypertension occurs, the drug should be stopped.
• Electrolyte balance should be checked every 2 weeks until stable dose
achieved and then every 3 months with other routine monitoring (Table 23.8).
If the potassium rises above the laboratory threshold the drug should be
stopped and re-assessed (having ensured it is not a result of other medication
changes).
• Grapefruit (including juice) increases the bioavailability of ciclosporin.
Grapefruit should be avoided for an hour before and after taking the drug.
• Ciclosporin has some specific drug interactions. Ciclosporin is an inhibitor of
CYP3A4, which metabolizes some drugs:
• Calcium channel blockers: reduce dose of ciclosporin to 50%.
• Statins: use in low dose as ciclosporin can elevate concentration of all these
drugs.
• Colchicine: should be avoided.
• Diclofenac: reduce the maximum dose of diclofenac to 75 mg daily.
• Digoxin: measure levels and reduce dose accordingly as ciclosporin can
increase serum levels.
• Diuretics: caution with electrolyte imbalance.
• Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): may increase plasma concentrations of
ciclosporin.
• PUVA: avoid ciclosporin given significant increase risk of invasive
squamous cell carcinoma.
• Concomitant use of potentially nephrotoxic drugs requires special concern

[SECTION]and monitoring.
• Simvastatin: avoid dosing above 10 mg/day.
• St. John’s wort: decreases ciclosporin activity.

Cyclophosphamide
The main use of the cytotoxic drug cyclophosphamide (CYC) is for organ- or
life-threatening manifestations of autoimmune connective tissue diseases
(AICTDs) and for remission induction of vasculitis.
• CYC can be administered either orally at a dose of 1.5–2 mg/kg/day or IV
given as a pulsed regimen.
• IV CYC dose is typically calculated based on weight or body surface area and
adjusted for renal function and age; given once every 2–4 weeks for up to 3–6
months.
• For ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), the CYCLOPS regimen is used: IV
CYC at dose of 15 mg/kg (reduced for age and renal function) each 2 weeks
for 6 weeks then each 3 weeks for 3 months.
• Pulsed IV CYC regimens are associated with lower total lifetime doses and
reduced toxicity.
• CYC-induced suppression of gametogenesis is often irreversible. Prior to the
decision to use CYC, patients should be counselled about infertility and
offered the use of GNRH analogue and/or harvesting and storage of
sperm/ova.
• Urothelial toxicity from the active CYC metabolite acrolein can cause
haemorrhagic cystitis. Patients should be well hydrated before receiving CYC
and for 24–48 hours after IV administration.
• Mesna is given to reduce risk of CYC-induced urothelial toxicity. The usual
dose is 2 g before and repeated 2 and 6 hours after IV therapy.
• Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, arthralgia, fatigue,
headache, tachycardia, and hypotension.
• Prophylactic antiemesis treatment should be offered to patients who are
receiving IV CYC.
• Co-trimoxazole 960 mg three times a week should be prescribed for
prophylaxis against Pneumocystis during treatment with CYC.
• Leucopenia/neutropenia is a significant risk and CYC dose should be reduced
if this happens. FBC may be checked on days 0, 7, 10, and 14 after the first
infusion and with any subsequent infusions where the dose is changed. An
FBC is often checked on day 12 (the usual nadir in neutrophil count) in
anticipation of the next infusion.

[SECTION]• After induction of disease remission, the usual practice is to switch from CYC
to alternative maintenance therapy such as AZA or MTX) to maintain
remission.
• There are a few CYC drug interactions:
• Avoid clozapine: increased risk of agranulocytosis.
• Digoxin: CYC reduces absorption.
• Phenytoin: CYC reduces absorption.
Gold (auranofin and sodium aurothiomalate)
Gold was used extensively in the management of RA and JIA but its use has
become infrequent since the widespread adoption of relatively high-dose MTX
and the availability of bDMARDs.
• The precise mode of action of gold is unknown though numerous in vitro
actions which may be relevant have been observed.
• Gold is given as 3 mg 2–3 times daily (oral; auranofin) or as a 50 mg IM
injection (sodium aurothiomalate), usually monthly.
• A test dose of 10 mg IM sodium aurothiomalate should be given on the first
treatment; thereafter 50 mg is given weekly until disease response achieved.
Thereafter, the injection is given every 4 weeks.
• In children, IM gold is given at 1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 50 mg.
• If no response is seen after a cumulative dose of 1 g (about 20 weekly doses)
of sodium aurothiomalate, it should be discontinued.
• Both formulations of gold are contraindicated in severe renal or hepatic
disease, ulcerative colitis, history of marrow dysplasia, porphyria, exfoliative
dermatitis, SLE, pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchiolitis.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine phosphate
HCQ and chloroquine phosphate are (old) antimalarials. Their use is common in
the management of RA, and in all the AICTDs. HCQ is especially popular for its
use as maintenance treatment in SLE (see Chapter 10).
• Antimalarial drugs have a number of anti-inflammatory and
immunomodulatory actions.
• HCQ is produced as a sulphate. Some side effects to HCQ may be a
consequence of the sulphate component of the drug (e.g. rash) thus a
phosphate form of HCQ can be used instead.
• The therapeutic dose of HCQ is 200 mg once or twice daily. The dose of
chloroquine phosphate is 250 mg once daily.
• The daily dose of chloroquine should not exceed 6.5 mg/kg. Alternate daily
regimes may be used in small children.

[SECTION]• Enquire about visual impairment and measure acuity. Near-vision testing
should demonstrate the capacity to read small print N8 or N6 on an acuity
chart.
• A thorough baseline visual assessment, including a view of the retina, may be
requested of an optometrist, optician or ophthalmologist prior to drug onset.
• Once on an antimalarial, patients should report any changes in visual
acuity/blurring; this would trigger re-assessment at any time and immediate
withdrawal of the drug until the nature of the problem is found. Otherwise,
accurate visual acuity assessment should take place annually.
• Antimalarials can exacerbate psoriasis.
• Antimalarials can cause skin rash, nausea, diarrhoea and can in rare cases
cause cardiac conduction abnormalities.
• There are a few drug interactions:
• Antimalarials can increase the plasma concentration of digoxin, MTX, and
ciclosporin.
• Avoid antimalarial use with amiodarone, quinine, mefloquine, and
quinolones for risk of hypersensitivity reaction.
Leflunomide
LEF is used in RA, PsA, and JIA and can be used in csDMARD combination
regimens. LEF is an ‘antiproliferative’ drug inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorodate dehydrogenase.
• A loading dose of 100 mg daily for 3 days is suggested (see SPC) but often
this causes GI upset and most rheumatologists avoid it, starting at the longterm maintenance dose of 20 mg daily.
• A dose of 10 mg daily may be sufficient if there are side effects on 20 mg.
• The dose in children over 3 years of age is 5mg daily if <10kg; 10mg daily is
10-40kg; 20mg daily if >40kg.
• LEF has a long half-life and requires a washout when severe toxicity is
suspected. A washout is achieved using colestyramine 8 g three times a day or
activated charcoal 50 g four times a day for 11 days. Blood concentrations
should be checked twice, 14 days apart prior to conceiving (levels should be
<0.02 mg/L).
• Caution is recommended when using LEF with MTX, since this combination
has been associated with liver dysfunction and failure. Cytopenia has also been
observed.
• Blood pressure is monitored with blood monitoring since LEF may cause an
increase in BP and destabilize controlled hypertension.
• Rarely, LEF can cause pneumonitis, acute allergic reaction and neuropathies.

[SECTION]• Women planning a family should have stopped LEF for 2 years (teratogenic)
(and men 3 months) before trying to conceive.
• There are a few drug interactions with LEF:
• LEF can increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
• LEF enhances the hypoglycaemic effects of tolbutamide.
• LEF may lead to increased concentrations of anticonvulsants.
Methotrexate
MTX is the most commonly used csDMARD. It is used as a first-line
csDMARD in RA, JIA and PsA, and in managing some AICTDs and
vasculitides.
• The action of MTX as an immunomodulator is not clear, although it is known
to be an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase in high doses. This is associated
with an inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and may effect cell
division.
• The typical maintenance dose of MTX is 15–25 mg once a week.
• The use of MTX varies across centres, but typically begins at 10–15 mg per
week and increase by 2.5–5 mg every 2 weeks for a period of 6–8 weeks.
• In children and adolescents the subcutaneous route is commonly used at
initiation at a dose of 10–15mg/m2. Higher doses of up to 20–25mg/m2 may be
used but are associated with more side effects and a lower rate of additional
benefit.
• A lower dose and slower escalation is recommended in the elderly and frail
and where there is reduced renal clearance.
• The subcutaneous route is associated with reduced risk of GI side effects and
higher bioavailability, compared to oral.
• MTX tablets should be taken whole, not crushed or chewed.
• MTX tablets come in 2.5 mg and 10 mg formulations. It is recommended that
only 2.5 mg tablets are prescribed and dispensed to avoid confusion and risk
of overdose.
• Folic acid (5mg once per week) is often given to reduce the risk of side
effects. It may be increased up to 6 days of the week avoiding the same day as
MTX.
• Folic acid may be increased when there is: raised MCV, mildly deranged
LFTs, anaemia, mucositis symptoms, nausea, mucosal ulceration; hair loss.
• Emergency folinic acid ‘rescue’ (15–25 mg four times a day IV or oral) should
be given if any concern over severe toxicity (primarily pneumonitis and
marrow suppression) and in overdose usually above a cumulative of 100 mg
MTX. If serum MTX levels can be measured it is advisable to continue rescue

[SECTION]•

•

•

until MTX levels fall below <0.1 µmol/L. In most cases, the response is
judged by the daily improvement in haematological indices.
The role of liver biopsy and serum pro-collagen III (PIIINP) testing remains
unclear. Some centres consider obtaining a liver biopsy when there has been
three consecutive elevations in PIIINP over a 12 month period. The decision to
stop therapy would be based on a risk/benefit assessment in each individual.
History should be taken at each monitoring visit for new dyspnoea as a
screening assessment for pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis. Further
investigation may require high-resolution CT and lung function tests detailing
lung volume and gas transfer coefficients.
The antifolate effect of some drugs, particularly co-trimoxazole and
trimethoprim, may increase the toxicity of MTX.
MTX concentration can be increased slightly by regular NSAIDs.

Mycophenolate mofetil
MMF has been routinely used in organ transplantation. MMF has also been used
in the control of lupus nephritis, myositis, and vasculitis, often in ‘remission
maintaining’ or in ‘steroid-sparing’ roles.
• MMF is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA). MPA is a
potent, selective, uncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine
monophosphate dehydrogenase, and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of
guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA.
• Because T and B lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation
on de novo synthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilize salvage
pathways, MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on
other cells.
• MMF dose is 1–3 g/day (300–600mg/m2 in children and adolescents) orally in
divided doses, starting at 500 mg daily for the 7 days, then 500 mg twice daily
for 7 days, building sequentially by an additional 500 mg daily every 7 days
over the ensuing weeks to an optimal/tolerable dose.
• MMF is monitored using FBC, LFTs, and urinalysis (screening for
nephrotoxicity).
• Main drug interactions of MMF:
• Decreased absorption of MMF can occur with antacids (magnesium and
aluminium hydroxide) and colestyramine.
• Increased concentration may arise with the use of aciclovir.
• Concomitant NSAIDs may add to nephrotoxic risk.
Sulfasalazine

[SECTION]Sulfasalazine (SSZ) is a useful csDMARD in treating peripheral and
enteropathic SpA and RA. There is weak to moderate evidence for efficacy in
PsA.
• A SSZ is an active substance although most is converted by bacteria in the
colon into the active metabolites colon where bacteria split the drug into
sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated,
or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolized SP appears in the
urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall. SSZ is also
excreted unchanged in the bile and urine.
• Overall SSZ and its metabolites exert immunomodulatory effects, antibacterial
effects, effects on the arachidonic acid cascade, and alteration of activity of
certain enzymes.
• SSZ therapeutic dose range is from 1.5 g to 3 g daily in divided doses. The
dose in children and adolescents is 30-50mg/kg/day (maximum 3g daily) in
two divided doses.
• A dose increment regimen is typically advised starting at 500 mg/day
(approximately 10mg/kg in children) for 7 days and increasing by an
additional 500 mg daily every 7 days over the ensuing weeks to the planned
therapeutic dose.
• Patients should be warned that bodily fluids may turn a darker yellow/orange
and not to be alarmed.
• SSZ may lead to staining of contact lenses.
• The enteric-coated formulation is well tolerated. SSZ also can be prescribed in
liquid form.
• Slow acetylators of SSZ may develop a drug-induced lupus-like syndrome. It
is not necessary to check acetylator phenotype since the drug will have been
stopped when suspicion occurs.
• The majority of patients who develop SSZ side effects do so in the first 3
months of taking the drug. Correspondingly, laboratory test monitoring can be
relaxed and in most guidelines, in long-term use, is only advised once every 3–
6 months.
• A history of hypersensitivity to sulfonamides/co-trimoxazole should deter use
of the drug.
• SSZ contains in part salicylic acid thus it can produce aspirin and NSAID-like
side effects (e.g. peptic lesions, interstitial nephritis, tinnitus).
• SSZ can reduce sperm count and viability directly and can affect fertility by
reducing gonadotrophin production.
• SSZ in combination with AZA may potentiate the risk of bone marrow toxicity
from either drug.

[SECTION]Targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs)
Tofacitinib
Tofacitinib is a JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitor that impairs the JAK-STAT
signalling pathway and affects immune cell function.
• Tofacitinib has been shown to be effective in RA as monotherapy or cotherapy with MTX. Trials have also taken place in psoriasis and colitis.
• It has been approved in the USA for treatment of RA and it is being reviewed
by NICE in the UK.
• It is given orally 5 mg twice daily for the immediate-release tablet or 11 mg
once daily for the extended-release tablet.
• The dose needs to be adjusted in moderate renal and hepatic impairment to 5
mg once daily and avoided in severe impairment.
• It is not recommended to co-prescribe tofacitinib with strong CYP3A4
inducers such as rifampicin and the dose should be reduced with concomitant
use of CYP3A4 inhibitors.
• Test and treatment for latent TB is recommended prior to commencement of
tofacitinib.
• Lymphoma and other malignancies including skin cancers have been reported.
• EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders have been
reported in renal transplant patients treated with tofacitinib and concomitant
immunosuppressants.
• Bone marrow suppression, lipid abnormalities, and hepatotoxicity can occur
and hence monitoring should include FBC, lipid profile, and liver function
tests.
• GI perforation has been reported in clinical trials so use with caution in
patients at increased risk such as diverticulitis.
Apremilast
Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, which results in increased
intracellular cAMP levels and consequently affects the regulation of numerous
inflammatory mediators including decreasing the expression of TNFα:
• Apremilast is licensed for the use of PsA.
• It is approved in the USA and Europe but it is yet to be approved by NICE as
‘cost-effective’ in the UK.
• Apremilast is given orally initially at 10 mg in the morning on day 1, titrate
upward by additional 10 mg per day on days 2 to 5 and maintenance dose of
30 mg twice daily from day 6.
• Dose needs to be adjusted when creatinine clearance is <30 mL/min.

[SECTION]• Apremilast may cause weight loss and discontinuation should be considered
with significant weight loss.
• Neuropsychiatric effects such as depression and mood changes have been
reported.
Biological DMARDs
Anti-TNFα therapy
TNFα is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine and the levels are elevated in
autoinflammatory/autoimmune inflammatory conditions.
• At present, there are five main anti-TNFα bDMARDs available: adalimumab,
etanercept, certolizumab pegol, infliximab, and golimumab.
• Infliximab is a chimeric human–murine anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody,
etanercept a recombinant human TNFα receptor fusion protein, certolizumab
pegol a pegylated Fab fragment of a fully humanized anti-TNF monoclonal
antibody, adalimumab and golimumab are both fully humanized anti-TNFα
monoclonal antibodies.
• Infliximab is administered by slow IV infusion at 0, 2, 4, and every 4–8 weeks,
thereafter depending on response.
• Etanercept is administered by SC injection and can be given once (50 mg)
instead of twice (25 mg) weekly.
• Certolizumab pegol is given by SC injection at a dose of 400 mg in weeks 0,
2, and 4, followed by a dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks.
• Adalimumab is given by SC injection: 40 mg (20mg if the child weighs
<30kg) every 2 weeks.
• Golimumab is given by SC injection at a dose of 50 mg every 4 weeks. An
increase in dose to 100 mg every 4 weeks can be given in patients who weigh
>100 kg.
• With all anti-TNFα agents, co-administration with MTX is recommended for
treating RA and JIA when MTX is tolerated as this has been shown to increase
efficacy. In addition, MTX use with infliximab and adalimumab reduces the
risk of antibodies to the anti-TNF agent.
• For efficacy alone there appears to be no additional effect of adding MTX to
anti-TNFα therapy for PsA or AS/axSpA.
• For RA patients who cannot take MTX, adalimumab, etanercept and
certolizumab pegol can be used as monotherapy.
• Notably, and particularly in PsA and axSpA/AS, there is evidence that patients
may respond to a second anti-TNFα if there is an inadequate response to a first
therapy.
• In the UK, anti-TNFα is restricted by criteria for use (NICE has published

[SECTION]guidelines for NHS use based on cost-effectiveness assessments; Table 23.9).
• Infliximab has been used to treat conditions (‘off-licence’) such as Behçet’s
disease (see Chapter 18).
Table 23.9 Summary of UK (NICE) guidelines for the use of the anti-TNFα therapy in RA in NHS
practice

1 Patients with clinical diagnosis of RA: ‘recent onset’ (disease duration
of up to 2 years and established (>2 years)
2 A Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) of >5.1
3 Adequate trial of at least 2 conventional DMARDs, one of which should
be methotrexate. An adequate trial is defined as:
Treatment for at least 6 months, with at least 2 months at standard target
dose (unless toxicity)
Treatment for <6 months where treatment was withdrawn due to
intolerance or toxicity, normally after at least 2 months of therapeutic
doses
4 Exclusion criteria: active infection or high risk of infection. Malignant or
pre-malignant states
5 Criteria for withdrawal of therapy: adverse events or inefficacy
6 An alternative anti-TNFα therapy may be considered for patients in whom
treatment is withdrawn due to an adverse event before the initial 6-month
assessment of efficacy

Anti-TNFα: cautions and monitoring
All the assessment and monitoring principles set out in Table 23.7, Table 23.8,
and Box 23.2 apply to bDMARDs as much as they do to csDMARDs,
particularly the assessment of infection and malignancy risk.
• Active bacterial or severe viral infection and current/recent malignancy are
exclusion criteria for treatment with anti-TNFα. Paediatric judgment is
required in children.
• Anti-TNFα should not be given to patients with a history of multiple sclerosis
or severe heart failure (NYHA grade 3 or 4).
• Guidelines for using anti-TNFα therapy in pregnancy have recently been

[SECTION]•

•

published (Table 23.10).
Common reactions include headache, nausea, and injection-site reactions.
Serious bacterial infections have been reported, and patients with active
infection should have their treatment stopped.
For patients at risk of recurrent infection (e.g. in-dwelling urinary catheter,
immunodeficiency states) it is usually recommended to avoid anti-TNFa
therapy.
Other reported side effects include demyelination, worsening of heart failure,
lupus-like syndromes, and blood dyscrasias.
Reactivation of TB has been reported mainly with infliximab and adalimumab
use (3–4× increased risk compared with etanercept) and most commonly
within 3 months of beginning of treatment. Patients should be assessed for TB
risk.
There are guidelines for assessing risk and managing TB infection in patients
due to start anti-TNFα therapy (e.g. British Thoracic Society available at:
http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk). Use of anti-TNFα therapy is not
contraindicated but patients may require up to 3–6 months’ treatment for latent
TB.
The long-term safety of anti-TNFα especially with regard to malignancy is not
known. It is well known that RA patients have a 2× risk of developing
lymphoma compared with the general population. Debate continues as to
whether reports of lymphoma in RA patients on anti-TNFα therapy reflect a
real drug effect or the known increased incidence of lymphoma in RA patients.
There is no increased risk of developing solid tumours. However, there
appears to be an increased risk of some skin cancers especially melanoma and
hence patient should be advised on preventive skin care and close monitoring
of skin.

B-cell depletion therapy
B cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA and other autoimmune
conditions generating antibodies and, through their surface receptors, in
processing and presenting antigen to T cells.
Rituximab
RTX is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against human CD20 that is present on
developing B cells prior to the plasma cell stage. Administration of RTX leads to
rapid CD20 positive B-cell depletion in the peripheral blood. Normal B-cell
repopulation (measured by monitoring the CD19 count) occurs variably but
typically over the next 6–9 months.

[SECTION]• RT. RCTs have shown that in RF-positive RA patients who have failed several
csDMARDs, a course of RTX (two infusions, 1 g 2 weeks apart with
methylprednisolone infusions) achieves a significant improvement in RA
disease activity at 6 months compared to MTX alone.
• In RA, the time to next infusion regimen can range from 6 to 18 months, but
has a mean of 9 months.
• There is concern about persistent hypogammaglobulinaemia after repeated
courses of RTX. The possibility of increased risk of infection with
hypogammaglobulinaemia should be discussed with patients before retreatment.
• In the UK, NICE allows RTX to be used with MTX in the treatment of severe
RA for NHS patients, where there has been an inadequate response to other
DMARDs and one or more other anti-TNFα therapy.
• Open-label studies in SLE initially suggested efficacy of RTX, with benefits
extending to 6 months; however, a RCT failed to show that RTX was
beneficial to patients with moderate-to-severe SLE.
• Repeated RTX infusions in SLE appear to increase BAFF/BLyS (see later),
which is associated with increasing severity of post-treatment flares in some
patients.
• Rituximab is as effective as CYC in the treatment of AAV as induction or
maintenance therapy and is used if avoidance of CYC is preferable or there is
an inadequate response to CYC.
• There is a growing literature suggesting benefit of RTX in other conditions,
e.g. polymyositis and dermatomyositis.
• The serious condition progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) has
been reported with RTX in a small number of patients. Patients should be
counselled appropriately before treatment.
• The assessment and monitoring recommended for RTX is similar to that
recommended for anti-TNFα therapy.
• A lymphocyte CD19 count can be checked before and 6 weeks after
administering RTX. The observation of it falling with treatment and then rising
as the disease ‘flares’ is evidence in favour of drug efficacy and a means of
predicting need for retreatment.
Belimumab
• Belimumab is monoclonal antibody that depletes B cell by blocking the
binding of soluble BAFF/BLyS to receptors on B lymphocytes, reducing the
activity of B-cell-mediated immunity. BAFF/BLyS is a TNF superfamily
member (TNFSF13B) best known for its role in the survival and maturation of

[SECTION]B cells.
• Belimumab may be used in SLE resistant to other agents.
• Belimumab is given as an infusion initially at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 3
doses and maintenance of 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks.
Interleukin-1 receptor antagonists
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Anakinra is an IL-1 receptor
antagonist that competes with Il-1 for binding.
• Anakinra is given by 100 mg (in children 1–4mg/kg) SC injection daily.
• RCTs have shown that anakinra is more effective than placebo in RA but
smaller disease responses are evident compared to anti-TNFα.
• Anakinra is used in treating MAS, systemic onset JIA and autoinflammatory
conditions, e.g. TNF receptor-1 associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS),
SAPHO syndrome, and adult-onset Still’s disease (see Chapter 18).
• Side effects include injection-site reactions, blood dyscrasias, and infection.
• Anakinra should not be used together with anti-TNFα therapies.
• Clearance is reduced in renal impairment.
Interleukin-6 inhibition
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine and mediator of the
acute-phase response. High levels of Il-6 have been found in serum and synovial
fluid of RA patients.
• Recent work has shown that both upstream and downstream signalling
pathways for IL-6 differ between myocytes and macrophages.
• It appears that unlike IL-6 signalling in macrophages, which is dependent on
activation of the NFκB signalling pathway, intramuscular IL-6 expression is
regulated by a network of signalling cascades, including the Ca2+/NFAT and
glycogen/p38 MAPK pathways.
• IL-6 signalling in monocytes or macrophages, creates a pro-inflammatory
response, whereas IL-6 signalling in muscle (independent of a preceding
TNFα response or NFκB activation) is anti-inflammatory.
Tocilizumab
Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the Il-6 receptor. It
is licensed for use in treating RA, systemic JIA, and Castleman’s disease.
• Tocilizumab is given by monthly IV infusion at a dose of 8 mg/kg. It is also
available as SC injection at 162 mg every other week if weight is <100 kg or
162 mg every week if weight >100 kg. In children >2y with systemic JIA the
dose is: weight <30kg–12mg/kg every two weeks by infusion; weight >30kg–
8mg/kg every two weeks. In children with polyarticular JIA the dose is 8–

[SECTION]•

•
•
•
•

10mg/kg every 4 weeks by infusion.
Tocilizumab is effective in controlling disease and limiting radiographic
progression in RA patients in whom MTX and anti-TNFα therapy have been
ineffective or not tolerated.
Tocilizumab can be used as monotherapy if MTX is not tolerated or
contraindicated.
Tocilizumab is currently under trial for use in large vessel vasculitis and
uveitis.
Lipids should be monitored 6-monthly given the association with druginduced hyperlipidaemia.
Bone marrow side effects are more frequent in the first few months of
treatment. FBC and liver function tests should be monitored monthly.

Biologic DMARDs targeting Th17 cell activation
Common to a number of conditions, Th17 cell activation is driven by Il-12 and
Il-23, which triggers the activated T-cell to produce Il-17 and elaborate other
cytokines, which have downstream pro-inflammatory effects in various tissues
then having tissue-specific effects. Diseases where Th17 cell activation is
pertinent include psoriasis and the SpAs (see Chapter 8).
Ustekinumab
Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23. Ustekinumab binds to the (common
sequence) p40 subunit of both cytokines so that they cannot activate their
receptors on Th17 cells.
• In PsA, ustekinumab has shown superior efficacy in treating synovitis,
dactylitis and enthesitis compared to MTX alone. Responses are positive in
both anti-TNFα naïve and anti-TNFα treated patients.
• Ustekinumab is given by SC injection: dose 45 mg (weight <100 kg) or 90 mg
(weight >100 kg) at week 0, 4, and 12-weekly thereafter.
• In the UK, NICE has approved use for NHS patients with PsA when disease is
still active despite treatment with DMARDs and if anti-TNFα has failed or is
contraindicated.
• Common side effects include infection, fatigue, and headache.
• Uncommon side effects include exfoliative dermatitis, encephalopathy, and
facial palsy.
Secukinumab
Secukinumab is a recombinant fully human monoclonal IgG1k antibody which
binds Il-17A inhibiting its receptor binding. It is licensed for use in treating

[SECTION]plaque psoriasis and has shown efficacy in treating AS.2
• For AS, the recommended dose is 150 mg once weekly subcutaneously at
weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3; followed by a maintenance dose monthly from week 4.
• Secukinumab may be effective in some adults with PsA whose response to
csDMARDs has been inadequate. Case reports suggest effectivity in patients
defined as having axSpA.
• It should be used with caution in patients with Crohn’s disease as it can cause
exacerbation of inflammatory disease.
Other biologic DMARDs
Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig)
Abatacept disrupts the CD80/86 co-stimulatory signal required for T-cell
activation by competing with CD28 for binding.
• Abatacept is effective in patients with RA whose disease is not controlled with
one or more csDMARDs including MTX or anti-TNFα.
• Abatacept is administered IV at a dose according to body weight; 500 mg (<60
kg), 750 mg (60–100 kg), and 1000 mg (>100 kg) at weeks 0, 2, and 4 and
then monthly thereafter. In children <75kg the dose is 10mg/kg by infusion in
the same frequency as adults.
• Abatacept can also been given SC at a dose of 125 mg once weekly. In
children 25–50kg the dose is 87.5mg and if >50kg an adult equivalent dose is
used.
• A recent systematic review has shown that the incidence of serious infections
was low, and compared with placebo was equal.

Drugs used in treating gout and hyperuricaemia
The management of gout is described in Chapter 7. The treatment of acute
gout is with NSAIDs, colchicine, and GCs. Urate lowering drugs are used if gout
is severe (e.g. chronic/tophaceous) and/or recurrent. See also Cochrane review
CD010069 ( http://www.cochranelibrary.com).
Colchicine
• Colchicine is anti-inflammatory and used in gout and CPPD disease for both
acute attacks and chronic disease.
• Colchicine can also be used long term in the treatment of Behçet’s disease and
familial Mediterranean fever.
• It is given initially at a dose of 0.5 mg twice daily in acute gout and CPPD.
The dose in children is 0.3 – 2.4mg in one to two divided doses increasing in
0.3mg/day increments as tolerated.
• Dose should be adjusted with renal impairment and avoided completely in
severe renal impairment (estimated GFR <10 mL/min).
• Dose is increased to three or four times daily but is limited by dose-related
diarrhoea.
• Colchicine frequently causes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Larger
doses may cause profuse diarrhoea, GI haemorrhage, skin rashes, and renal
and hepatic damage.

[SECTION]• The rare side effects are myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, alopecia, with prolonged
treatment, bone marrow suppression can occur.
Allopurinol
• Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor which is usually the first-line uratelowering drug.
• Initiate at 100 mg orally daily then adjust according to plasma uric acid
concentration each month by 100 mg to maximum 900 mg daily.
• The dose should be adjusted down in renal impairment, and in severe renal
impairment, reduce daily dose below 100 mg.
• The dose should be changed inversely (e.g. each 4–6 weeks) titrated against
urate level to a target <360 nmol/L or in severe disease <300.
• About 2% of patients develop a rash which is typically pruritic and
maculopapular. If mild, withdraw therapy and re-challenge can be undertaken
with caution but discontinue promptly if recurrence.
• Life threatening hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome,
toxic epidermal necrolysis, or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic
symptoms (DRESS) can occur rarely and re-challenge should not be
undertaken.
• GI disorders, e.g. nausea and diarrhoea, are uncommon and bone marrow
suppression is rare even in high doses.
• Allopurinol can interfere with the metabolism of AZA and 6-MP, potentiating
side effects. The dose of AZA or 6-MP should be ~25% of the usual dose if
they are given concurrently with allopurinol.
• Other interactions include warfarin (monitor INR), theophylline (monitor drug
level), and ACE inhibitors (haematological reactions).
Febuxostat
Febuxostat is a non-purine xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to treat
hyperuricaemia. It is appropriate for patients who are allergic to allopurinol, do
not reach the target uric acid level with maximal allopurinol doses, or have
severe renal insufficiency.
• Febuxostat is initiated at 80 mg orally daily then increase to 120 mg daily after
2–4 weeks if serum uric acid >6 mg/dL.
• The most common side effects are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, liver function
test abnormalities, and rash.
• Severe hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic
epidermal necrolysis, or DRESS occur but are rare.
• Mild liver function abnormalities were observed in 5% in clinical studies,

[SECTION]hence checking LFTs is recommended before starting febuxostat and
periodically thereafter. In known mild hepatic impairment, the dose is reduced
to 40–80 mg daily.
• Febuxostat is not advised for people with ischaemic heart disease or heart
failure because initial trials showed a higher incidence of cardiovascular side
effects from febuxostat compared with allopurinol; however, the observation
has not been substantiated in further trials.
• Febuxostat can interfere with metabolism of AZA and 6-MP and hence
concomitant use is not recommended.
Probenecid
Probenecid is a uricosuric agent, which is effective by altering renal handling of
urate and increasing urine excretion. It has been used to increase the
concentration of some antibiotics.
• The recommended dose is 250 mg oral twice daily for 1 week and 500 mg
twice daily thereafter.
• Probenecid should not be started until after an acute attack of gout.
• In some countries, including the UK, probenecid is only available from
‘special-order’ manufacturers or distributors.
• It is important to ensure adequate fluid intake.
• Probenecid is contraindicated in patients with a history of blood disorders,
renal stones, and renal impairment where estimated GFR is <30 mL/min.
Sulfinpyrazone (sulphinpyrazone)
Sulfinpyrazone is a uricosuric agent. It should not be started during an acute gout
attack.
• Sulfinpyrazone is initiated at 100–200 mg orally daily with food increasing
over 2–3 weeks to 600 mg daily until target serum uric acid concentration is
reached and then reduced to maintenance dose which may be as low as 200 mg
daily.
• Dose should be reduced in renal impairment. It should be avoided in severe
renal impairment and is ineffective if GFR is <30 mL/min.
• It is contraindicated in patients with history of blood disorders.
• Regular FBC/CBC monitoring is advisable as sulfinpyrazone can cause blood
disorders.
• Caution is advised in prescribing where there is cardiac, cerebrovascular, or
hypertension disease as the drug may cause salt and water retention.
• Other side effects include GI disturbances and ulceration, allergic skin
reactions, acute kidney injury, and hepatitis.

Benzbromarone
Benzbromarone is a uricosuric agent and non-competitive inhibitor of xanthine
oxidase, available in Europe. Benzbromarone also inhibits cytochrome CYP2C9,
which is responsible for metabolizing a number of drugs including drugs with a
narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin and phenytoin and other drugs such as
tolbutamide, losartan, and some NSAIDs.
• Benzbromarone offers advantages over some uricosuric drugs as it may be
safer and better tolerated in patients with renal insufficiency.
• Liver function must be monitored for drug-induced hepatitis; fulminant liver
failure has been described.
• Given its effects on CYP2C9 caution with co-prescribing, any medication is
mandatory.
Rasburicase
Rasburicase is a recombinant uricase/urate-oxidase enzyme produced by
genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. Urate oxidase exists in
many mammals but does not occur in humans.
• Rasburicase catalyses enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into a metabolite,
allantoin, which is 5–10× more soluble than uric acid, with CO2 and hydrogen
peroxide as by-products in the chemical reaction.
• Rasburicase is licensed in the USA and Europe for treatment of acute
hyperuricaemia associated with tumour lysis syndrome in patients receiving
lymphoma or leukaemia chemotherapy.
• The recommended dose is 0.2 mg/kg/day given as a once-daily 30-minute IV
infusion in 50 mL of 0.9% saline.
• The duration of treatment may be up to 7 days, the exact duration should be
based upon adequate monitoring of uric acid levels in plasma and clinical
judgement.
• Long-term use for hyperuricaemia associated with gout at doses of 0.15–0.2
mg/kg is being investigated.
Pegloticase
Pegloticase is a recombinant porcine-like uricase and like rasburicase it
metabolizes uric acid to allantoin.
• Pegloticase is pegylated to increase its elimination half-life from about 8 hours
to 10–12 days and to decrease the immunogenicity of the foreign uricase
protein. So pegloticase is given every 2–4 weeks.
• Pegloticase might be considered* for patients with severe gout in whom other

[SECTION]•
•

•

•

•

urate-lowering agents have been ineffective.
Pegloticase produces rapid reduction in signs and symptoms of gout.
Pegloticase is given as an IV infusion, 8 mg every 2 weeks, infused over >2
hours with premedication to decrease infusion reactions including oral
paracetamol, hydrocortisone, and antihistamine.
All patients should be given prophylaxis for prevention of acute gout during
the first 6 months of treatment.
Trials have shown that the urate-lowering effect can be attenuated or lost in
some patients due to high titre anti-pegloticase antibodies.
In the UK, pegloticase has not been sanctioned for use in gout by NICE for
NHS-treated patients, citing poor cost-effectivity but also noting reported
severe anaphylaxis reactions have occurred with it.
* In 2016, the European Commission withdrew the marketing authorization
for pegloticase in the EU.

Pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)
Pooled IVIg is primarily used as replacement therapy in primary
immunodeficiency conditions. However, IVIg can have an immunosuppressive
effect though the mechanism of effect is not precisely known. A number of
theories exist.
• Apart from immunodeficiency, the main indications for IVIg are in Guillain–
Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, SLE
(see
Chapter 10), dermatomyositis (see
Chapter 14), and Kawasaki
disease (see Chapter 15).
• The typical dosing regimen is 400 mg/kg/day as a single infusion over 2–4
hours as tolerated and for 5 days; or 1 g/kg/day for 2 days. This is repeated
every 4–8 weeks for up to 6 months in the first instance according to efficacy.
• Side effects occur in <5% of patients and most often within 24 hours of an
infusion.
• However, the FDA (USA) requires IVIg products to carry a black box
warning, cautioning that IVIg has been associated with renal dysfunction,
acute kidney injury, osmotic nephrosis, and death, especially in the elderly or
with simultaneous use of other nephrotoxic drugs or other pre-existing issues
that affect the kidneys.
• Side effects at the time of infusion include headache, flushing, chills, myalgia,
wheezing, tachycardia, lower back pain, nausea, and hypotension. If these
occur, the infusion should be slowed or stopped. Most cases will respond to
antihistamines and IV hydrocortisone if symptoms persist.
• Other significant, but rare complications include acute kidney injury,

serum sickness, transient neutropenia, aseptic meningitis, post-infusion
hyperproteinaemia with pseudohyponatraemia, eczematous dermatitis, and
alopecia.

Introduction
Local anaesthetic and glucocorticoid (GC; ‘steroid’) injection into joints,
tendons, bursae, and soft tissues is a very effective treatment for localized pain
and inflammation.
• Injection offers a local maximal anti-inflammatory effect with minimal
systemic absorption.
• As a general rule, it is recommended that any one joint should not be injected
more than four times in 12 months and there are at least 6 weeks between
injections.
• The indications for local steroid injection include:
• reduction of inflammation.
• relief of pain from inflammatory lesions.
• relief of inflammation at sites of nerve compression.
• reduce the size of nodules and ganglia.
• The contraindications are:

[SECTION]•

•
•
•

•

• absolute: septic arthritis/sepsis, a febrile patient with cause unknown,
serious allergy to previous injection, sickle cell disease.
• relative: unknown cause of lesion, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,
anticoagulation, or bleeding disorder.
Common steroid preparations used include:
• hydrocortisone acetate—a short-acting, weak steroid useful for superficial
lesions such as tendons and bursae: 25mg is typical.
• methylprednisolone acetate 40 mg/mL.
• prednisolone acetate 25 mg/mL.
• triamcinolone acetonide 10 and 40 mg/mL.
The latter three agents are long-acting synthetic glucocorticoids.
Choice of strength of steroid remains empiric.
Volume of steroid/anaesthetic ‘accepted’ by joints varies:
• Small joints accept only a small volume; thus, for IPJs, MCPJs, MTPJs, and
temporomandibular joints, 0.5 mL only is appropriate.
• All other joints should accept at least 1 mL.
• There may be merit in diluting the steroid in sterile saline, to increase
volume for better distribution in larger joints.
• alternatively, larger volume levobupivacaine (10 mL) is of value.
Potential, though uncommon, side effects (see also Chapter 23) are:
• exacerbation of pain for 24–48 hours.
• septic arthritis and reactivation of TB.
• tissue atrophy (less likely with hydrocortisone than others).
• depigmentation of skin.
• anaphylaxis.
• nerve damage.
• tendon rupture.
• osteonecrosis.
• cartilage damage.
• soft tissue calcification.
• temporary exacerbation of hyperglycaemia in diabetes.

Principles of injection techniques
The procedure need not necessarily be done in a sterile environment. However,
there is a need to maintain an aseptic technique. Efficacy may be greater using
US-guided injection but will be more accurate. US should only be done by
appropriately qualified clinicians.
• Mark the exact spot of needle insertion.

[SECTION]• Wash hands. Use sterile gloves for the procedure.
• Clean the skin with povidone-iodine and allow it to dry.
• Anaesthetize the skin (either with local anaesthetic or refrigerant alcohol
spray). Children and some adolescents may require a light general anaesthetic
given the procedure can be traumatic. An alternative is to use local anaesthetic
gel pads (e.g. EMLA® patch).
• Insert a clean needle with empty syringe and aspirate back.
• Leave the needle in place, detach the syringe, and place the syringe containing
steroid/local anaesthetic onto the end of a new needle.
• Insert needle into site to be injected.
• Pull back the syringe plunger again before injecting to confirm placement,
ensuring the needle is not in a blood vessel.
• Introduction of steroid should be effortless. Resistance implies the end of the
needle is in the wrong space. Stop if it causes more pain.
• On completion of the procedure, remove the syringe and needle and throw
away the ‘sharps’.
• Cover the injection site with clean gauze or a bandage.
• Rest the joint for 24 hours (consider up to 48 hours for a weight-bearing joint),
including using a non-rigid splint (e.g. Velcro® attached semi-rigid splint for
wrist, or modified Robert-Jones bandaging for the knee).
• Advise that icing the area/joint may reduce post-injection discomfort, and reemphasize possible side effects and benefits.

The shoulder
The glenohumeral joint (for glenohumeral joint synovitis or adhesive
capsulitis)
US-guided injection technique
It is difficult to be confident a needle is placed in the glenohumeral joint space
without confirmation imaging with US. The default technique for injecting the
glenohumeral joint should be with US.
• US-guided injection is the gold standard for comparing therapy options in
research studies (e.g. steroid injection vs hydrodilation for adhesive capsulitis).
• US is probably not required, however, when an injection is done as the second
part of a linked procedure when the first part is aspirating a large effusion (e.g.
in CPPD-pseudogout).
Non-US-guided injection technique

[SECTION]Sometimes it is not possible to obtain US and a ‘blind’ injection may need to be
done. It is essential that anyone undertaking the injections has been appropriately
trained or is supervised and is knowledgeable about anatomy and functional
anatomy.
• The approach may be anterior or posterior.
• The anterior approach is favoured for adhesive capsulitis given the
predominant pathology involves the anterior part of the joint complex
including coracoacromial ligament and subscapularis bursa.
• The anterior route is undertaken thus:
• Palpate the coracoid process anteriorly and acromion posteriorly.
• The injection is made just lateral to the coracoid with the needle pointing
towards the acromion (see Plate 4).
• The posterior route is done thus:
• The clinician palpates the spine of the scapula with the thumb to its lateral
end where it bends forward as the acromion.
• With the forefinger, palpate the coracoid anteriorly. The line between finger
and thumb then marks the position of the joint line.
• The needle is advanced from behind, 1 cm below the acromion, and towards
the coracoid. There should be no resistance.
• By either approach, the joint can be injected with relatively large volumes
such as 1 mL (40 mg) methylprednisolone acetate mixed with 5 mL 1%
lidocaine.
• A long needle is needed.
• Withdrawing the needle slightly and redirecting 30° upward will allow one to
reach the rotator cuff with the same procedure.
Subacromial space (for subacromial impingement disorders)
US-guided injection technique
It is difficult to be confident a needle is placed in the subacromial space without
confirmation with US. The default technique for injecting the subacromial space
should be with US.
• US may be used diagnostically and, with appropriate sonographer experience
and skill, calcific supraspinatus lesions and tears can be identified.
• Radiological expertise varies from department to department and local advice
on choosing MRI or US for specific lesion identification would be appropriate.
Non-US-guided injection technique
Sometimes it is not possible to obtain US and a ‘blind’ injection may need to be
done. It is essential that anyone undertaking such an injection has been

[SECTION]appropriately trained or is supervised and is knowledgeable about anatomy and
functional anatomy.
• The subacromial space is injected most effectively from the lateral aspect of
the shoulder.
• The arm is placed in a neutral position, hanging to the side, and the gap
between the acromion and the humeral head is palpated.
• A long, narrow-gauge (e.g. 23) needle is directed medially and slightly
posterior (but on a horizontal plane) for about 2–3 cm (see Plate 5).
• Usually a volume of 3–4 mL can be accepted (e.g. 40 mg methylprednisolone
acetate in 1 mL with up to 5 mL 1% lidocaine).
• Advise avoidance of overarm activity or heavy lifting for a few days and
consider arranging physiotherapy to start 2 weeks after the injection to work
on restoring rotator cuff function.
Acromioclavicular joint (ACJ)
The ACJ is sometimes very difficult to locate so US to help mark the joint is
desirable. US is somewhat limited in its utility however, given the amount of
bone present—usually an ACJ which needs injecting is somewhat arthritic with
osteophytes and periarticular sclerosis—thus interfering with US imaging data.
• The ACJ is located by following the clavicle laterally to a ridge in the bone.
The joint is often tender to palpate.
• Marking the bony edge/landmarks with a pen will be helpful.
• With the patient either sitting or lying supine, a small-gauge needle with 20
mg methylprednisolone (or equivalent) in 0.5 mL mixed with 0.5 mL of 1%
lidocaine is directed in to the joint.

The elbow
Lateral epicondylitis/‘tennis elbow’/common extensor tendon origin
enthesitis
Please see Chapter 3 for advice on clinical assessment and making a diagnosis.
This lesion may be secondary to trauma or associated with a SpA condition or
PsA.
• US imaging is not required. The injection is best placed at the point of
maximum tenderness. The target is usually very superficial.
• The lateral humeral epicondyle and surrounding tissue is injected with the
elbow resting on a pillow—or similar—on the examination table and flexed at
90°.
• Use hydrocortisone initially 25 mg because other steroid preparations may

[SECTION]•
•
•

•
•

cause local fat atrophy and depigmentation (as this is necessarily often a very
superficial injection just under the skin).
Use 0.5–1 mL 1% lidocaine mixed with the hydrocortisone.
The injection is aimed at 45° to the end of the tendon origin.
A fair amount of pressure is required for this injection. Efficacy of the
injection may rely partly on disruption of the periosteum of the epicondylar
bone. It is often painful (see Plate 6).
Advise rest and icing post procedure.
Autologous blood injection has been reported anecdotally as effective, though
the technique is controversial, convincing data on efficacy is lacking and in the
UK NHS, the technique is not recommended. Guidance on this procedure may
be found at: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg438/.

Medial epicondylitis/‘golfer’s elbow’/common flexor tendon origin enthesitis
Please see Chapter 3 for advice on clinical assessment and making a diagnosis.
This lesion may be secondary to trauma or associated with a SpA condition or
PsA.
• US imaging is not required. The injection is best placed at the point of
maximum tenderness. The target is usually very superficial.
• The medial humeral epicondyle and surrounding tissue is injected with the
elbow extended and resting on a pillow—or similar—on the examination
table.
• Use hydrocortisone initially 25 mg because other steroid preparations may
cause local fat atrophy and depigmentation (as this is necessarily often a very
superficial injection just under the skin).
• Use 0.5–1 mL 1% lidocaine mixed with the hydrocortisone.
• The injection is aimed at 45° to the end of the tendon origin.
• The needle is directed to the flexor tendon origin. However, care should be
taken to avoid the groove just behind the medial epicondyle—the site of the
ulnar nerve.
• Advise rest and ice post procedure.
Olecranon bursitis
An olecranon bursa can be aspirated and injected without US guidance. Needle
position is confirmed by the aspiration of fluid.
• The usual causes of bursitis are gout, infection, and RA.
• Fluid aspirated may reasonably be sent initially for microscopy and culture
and infection ruled out before steroid is injected.
• Always send fluid for polarized light microscopy.

[SECTION]• Use triamcinolone acetonide or methylprednisolone at a dose of 20–40 mg and
advise icing and rest for 48 hours.
• Arrange appropriate follow-up as the olecranon bursa is prone to develop
infection and may need prompt reassessment—advise the patient accordingly.
Elbow joint (e.g. RA synovitis)
US guidance may help though often, when there is an effusion, needle placement
is relatively straightforward and can be confirmed by fluid aspiration.
• The elbow joint is most easily reached by a posterior approach.
• Use 40 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent, with 2–3 mL 1% lidocaine.
• Injection into a swollen elbow joint after fluid aspiration, when there is a
distended capsule is relatively straightforward; however, an effusion may be
present and not readily clinically identified—so landmark identification is
necessary.
• Place the thumb on the lateral epicondyle and the third finger on the olecranon.
The groove between the two fingers identifies the joint line.
• Inject at 90° to the skin, just above and lateral to the olecranon.
• Alternatively, the radial head can be palpated (by feeling for it during forearm
pronation/supination) and the needle sited tangentially just under the capsule
(an anterolateral approach).
• Advise rest and icing post procedure and advise to avoid lifting or gripping
with the arm for a few days.
• Consider arranging physiotherapy to encourage/exercise the elbow back to full
range. There is a high chance, with persistent inflammatory disease in the
elbow, of progression to permanent loss of elbow extension.

The wrist and hand
Lesions of the wrist
Radiocarpal joint
(Please see also Chapter 3.)
• The radiocarpal joint is best identified for injection with the patient’s forearm
supported and their hand—also supported—palm down with the wrist then in
slight flexion. A triangular gap is felt between the radius scaphoid and lunate.
• The needle (small gauge) is pointed directly down into the space.
• For most causes of wrist joint inflammation and synovitis, 40 mg
methylprednisolone acetate with 2 mL 1% lidocaine is appropriate.
• Image-guided injection technique is not usually needed for this injection as the

[SECTION]wrist space is easily gained.
Carpal tunnel syndrome
For anatomy and clinical assessment see
‘Upper limb peripheral nerve
lesions’, pp. 124–127.
• The carpal tunnel is injected on the palmar surface of the wrist in the first
crease, midline. Position the patient’s supported arm, volar side up and with
gentle extension at the wrist; hand supported also.
• US guidance for this injection is not needed.
• Sit opposite the patient so their arm and hand is pointing towards your own
position.
• Advance the needle at 30–45° to the skin towards the hand for about 2 cm (i.e.
towards you).
• Improvement of neurogenic symptoms can be gained with hydrocortisone 25
mg but most rheumatologists will use triamcinolone 20 mg or
methylprednisolone acetate 20 mg.
• Do not use lidocaine.
• If the palmaris tendon is present, the injection should be sited just medial (i.e.
closer to the ‘little finger’) to the midline, by about 1cm.
• There should be no resistance on injection or nerve pain (see Plate 12).
Extensor pollicis brevis/abductor pollicis longus
De Quervain’s tenosynovitis should be injected at the point of maximal
tenderness, advancing the needle through the tendon sheath at a very shallow
angle to the skin, along the line of the tendon rather than at 90° to the tendon.
• For functional anatomy and clinical assessment please, see ‘Wrist pain in
adults’, pp. 106–110.
• Inject 25mg hydrocortisone initially. If a second injection is required, consider
either using methylprednisolone or asking for a US-guided injection.
• A US can also rule out other lesions of the wrist and tendon area (e.g. ganglia,
carpal bone disruption, lateral wrist compartment synovitis, 1st CMCJ
synovial cyst, etc.).
The small hand joints
The small joints of the hand are frequently affected by synovitis in patients with
chronic inflammatory arthritis. Excess joint fluid and capsule extension and
thickening can be confirmed by US. Effusions are usually under high pressure,
though cannot easily be aspirated without a large-gauge needle. Use of the latter,
however, is somewhat brutal and is best not attempted except under anaesthetic.
• US to confirm joint synovitis is often very useful and there are specific

diagnostic signs potentially available with it (e.g. double contour sign in
detecting MSU crystals in gout and calcium pyrophosphate deposits in CPPD
arthritis).
The MCPJs and PIPJs will normally ‘accept’ 0.5–1 mL of injected fluid (e.g.
0.5 mL triamcinolone acetonide or methylprednisolone (20 mg) and 0.5 mL
1% lidocaine).
For MCPJ injection, ensure the patient’s forearm and hand are supported. Sit
opposite the patient.
Use a small 23- or 25-gauge needle and ‘run’ the needle under the skin parallel
to the finger just to the side of the metacarpal head (Fig. 24.1), away from you
but aiming very slightly towards the metacarpal head—envisage entering the
needle under the distended joint capsule and in this way, avoid contacting the
bone (which will be painful). Look for a subcutaneous bleb appearing (a sign
of not getting the injection into the joint).
Using the same needle access point but angling the needle appropriately, two
MCPJs can be accessed in the one procedure (but plan this and fill the syringe
with appropriate amount of steroid/lidocaine).
The approach to a PIPJ is probably best undertaken from the ulnar side of the
digit but the technique is similar to MCPJ injection.
The small joint injections can cause discomfort and so advise icing and
NSAID use in the post-injection period for 2–3 days.
As always with joint injections, advise against mobilizing the joint too much
in the first few days after injection.

[SECTION]Fig. 24.1 Direction of needle access to a swollen metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) or proximal
interphalangeal joint (PIPJ). Synovitis swells the joint capsule which can be accessed by running the needle
virtually parallel with the digit but slightly angled.

The hip and periarticular lesions
Hip joint
Hip injection is not a routine outpatient procedure. Aspiration and injection of
the joint either under US or fluororadiographic guidance is recommended.
Greater trochanter pain syndrome
Pain at and around the greater trochanter may be due to referred lumbosacral
pain, gluteus medius (or other tendon) tear or insertional tendonitis/enthesitis, or
a local bursitis. Lesions can coexist.
• Imaging to confirm the lesion and to rule out a tendon tear—when an injection
would be contraindicated—is advisable.
• Trochanteric bursitis or enthesitis at this site, however, often responds well to
local steroid injection.
• US-guided injection is preferable as the inflamed tissue is deep and ‘blind’
injection placement may be quite inaccurate.
• However, occasionally ‘blind’ injection is appropriate.

[SECTION]• The patient should lie on their side with knees drawn up and the most tender
area located with markers—e.g. with pen on the skin.
• The usual point of maximum tenderness in gluteus medius enthesitis is just
posterior and high to the greater trochanter apex.
• The site of injection is at the point of maximal tenderness.
• The injection target is deep and therefore a pragmatic approach using a large
volume is sensible (e.g. 5–10 mL).
• Use 20–40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone (thus 1–2 mL) and then
diluted with sterile saline or 1% lidocaine.
• Injection failure should raise the possibility of poor needle position thus USguidance on a second injection attempt is advisable.
Other lesions around the pelvis and hip
• Meralgia paraesthetica occurs as a consequence of lateral cutaneous nerve
entrapment (see Chapter 3) as it traverses the fascia 10 cm below and medial
to the anterior superior iliac spine. If this spot can be clearly demarcated
because of localized tenderness, steroid injection has a greater chance of
success.
• The ischial tuberosities are located deep in the medial side of the buttocks. The
hamstring entheses or overlying bursae can become inflamed, causing pain on
sitting. These tender points can be injected. The differential diagnosis is
coccidynia.
• The coccyx can be palpated with the patient prone or lying on their side) and is
amenable to local anaesthetic and steroid injection.
• Adductor enthesitis/insertional tendonitis is amenable to steroid injection but
is technically difficult. Imaging initially is essential as there is a differential
diagnosis—which includes symphysitis, osteitis pubis, ischiopubis fracture,
inguinal hernia, and medial hip joint lesions. An inflamed symphysis pubis is
best injected under US guidance.

The knee and periarticular lesions
The knee joint
Knee joints are, with appropriate training and experience, straightforward to
access with a needle without imaging guidance.
• Access to the joint is perhaps simplest by the lateral approach so the procedure
does not have to take place ‘over’ the patient’s other leg/knee, and the person
undertaking the procedure can sit comfortably without having to reach over
the patient.

[SECTION]• The patient should be supine and comfortable with support under the knee
(which may not, when there is an effusion, be able to extend fully and rest on
the couch).
• Mark a point about a third of the way down the patella but midway between
the upper and lower parts of the leg—this should be where an effusion will
‘balloon’ out because of pressure distribution within the joint, and thus be
most easily accessed.
• A wide-gauge needle is most appropriate given aspiration of synovial fluid is
often also required for symptom relief and diagnostics.
• If the procedure may be long because of anticipation that a large volume of
fluid will need to be aspirated, then consider anesthetizing the skin and
subcutaneous tissues first.
• The needle is advanced at 90° to the skin surface (see Plate 19).
• A joint effusion should be reached, in all but the most obese patients, within 2
cm. A common mistake that inexperienced operators can make is to insert the
needle too far and cause pain by hitting the femur or patella bone with the
needle.
• If sepsis or crystal arthritis is suspected, send a sample of fluid for microscopy
and culture, and polarized light microscopy, respectively.
• If a sample is needed to assess for infection, take great care to harvest the
sample in a sterile way—with the aid of an assistant to help collect the sample
in a sterile pot.
• Aspirate the joint to dryness or until aspiration becomes difficult. Try not to
reposition the needle too many times as this will cause trauma and bleeding—
effusions with PsA and infection can be large (e.g. author’s personal record is
300 mL from a TB effusion!).
• Access to the joint space may be improved, and greater fluid removal
facilitated, by pressing on the medial side of the knee and pressing on, and
tilting, the patella with your other hand.
• Disengage the needle from the syringe and re-attach the syringe containing
steroid: 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone is appropriate for most
size joints and conditions—but add perhaps 5 mL of either sterile saline or 1%
lidocaine because the joint space is potentially quite large.
• The efficacy of a steroid injection may relate to the amount of rest following
the procedure—avoidance of weight-bearing on a flexed knee for example.
Advise 48 hours rest ideally.
• Icing and NSAID use for 24 hours after the procedure may ease discomfort
associated with the procedure.
• Consider follow-up physiotherapy if there is poor extension range and/or

[SECTION]quadriceps wasting associated with chronicity of the knee synovitis.
Knee periarticular injections
• Prepatellar bursitis, patellar ligament enthesitis, pes anserinus enthesitis or
bursitis, and trigger points around the knee may all respond to local steroid and
anaesthetic.
• US scanning to confirm diagnosis may reasonably be combined with a USguided procedure but the details of this need to be agreed with an appropriate
radiologist in advance.
• Popliteal cysts can be directly aspirated and injected but due to the risk of
damaging superficial neurovascular structures, should be done under US
guidance.

The ankle and foot
Ankle and subtalar joints and tarsal tunnel
The ankle joint can sometimes be accessed without US guidance though the
technique is difficult when affected by the common occurrence of subcutaneous
oedema.
• The ankle joint is located most easily with the patient supine on a couch and
whole leg rested and supported.
• The joint line can be palpated just lateral to the extensor digitorum tendon as it
crosses the ankle crease.
• The needle is initially advanced downwards over the dome of the talus and
parallel to the sole of the foot for about 1–2 cm in most cases—when there is
an effusion, the swelling will balloon out/forward towards this point.
• It is quite frequent to hit bone with the needle so caution in needle placement
is advised (see Plate 20a).
• It is unusual to be able to aspirate fluid from an ankle joint though a small
volume is accessible with a larger-gauge needle. The ankle is a common joint
to be affected by gout and CPPD arthritis so sending any sample for PLM is
appropriate.
• For an inflammatory ankle arthritis, 40 mg of triamcinolone or
methylprednisolone acetate with 2–3 mL of 1% lidocaine is typical.
• Advise elevation, rest, and icing post procedure and avoiding all but necessary
weight-bearing for 48 hours.
• Subtalar joint can be affected by synovitis and infection but accessing the joint
without US guidance is very difficult.
• The tarsal tunnel (see Plate 20b) is injected under the flexor retinaculum

[SECTION]between the calcaneum and the medial malleolus.
Plantar fasciitis
The origin of the plantar fascia at the medial calcaneal tubercle of the os calcis is
frequently affected by recurrent trauma and inflammation. The latter occurs
commonly in axSpA, PsA, reactive (SpA-associated) arthritis, and IBD-related
arthritis.
• The plantar fascia origin is injected from the medial side after carefully
localizing the position of maximal pain (see Plate 20c).
• Never inject through the sole of the foot (i.e. at 90° to the skin) but a point of
needle entry at the medial edge of the foot, angled towards the point of
maximal tenderness may be optimal.
• Some clinicians will numb the area with local anaesthetic injection of the
posterior tibial nerve, in the tarsal tunnel (see Plate 20b).
• Use 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide or methylprednisolone mixed with 1–2 mL
of 1% lidocaine.
• Advise post-procedure foot elevation, restricting of weight-bearing, and icing
if the heel is sore.
• Many rheumatologists will consider it appropriate to offer a second injection if
the first is only partly helpful. Allow 4–6 weeks to tell if the first injection has
been satisfactorily effective or not.
Small joints of the feet
• The MTPJs are injected most easily via the dorsal approach (20 mg
triamcinolone or methylprednisolone) through the toe web.
• The needle is directed towards the appropriate metatarsal head.
• The same technique is used to inject around an interdigital neuroma (Morton’s
neuroma).
• Care should be taken with sterilizing the skin prior to the procedure as there is
a particular risk of infection after the procedure.

Septic arthritis
Infection in a joint can progress rapidly, causing tissue destruction, permanent
deformity, and disability. When septic arthritis is suspected, investigation and
antibiotic initiation should be prompt, and where feasible, infected tissue
resected. The epidemiology and aetiopathogenesis of septic arthritis is reported
in Chapter 17.
Septic arthritis: in adults
• Patients may not appear systemically unwell, so a high index of clinical
suspicion is required.
• Septic arthritis is more common in patients with established joint disease,
prosthetic joints, and where there are comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic
renal disease, immunosuppression, and IV drug abuse.
• Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are the most common pathogens. Septic
arthritis from Haemophilus influenzae type b is becoming rare due to
vaccination programmes.
• Crystal arthropathy and cellulitis are differential diagnoses.
• Consider primary or secondary infective endocarditis in high-risk cases, (e.g.

[SECTION]IV drug users and prosthetic/diseased cardiac valves).
• Gonococcal arthritis is the most common cause of monoarthritis in a young,
sexually active adult; women during menstruation may be at particular risk.
Disseminated gonococcal infection may present as a clinical triad of pustular
skin lesions, tenosynovitis, or migratory arthralgias. The cutaneous
manifestations are fleeting and are not required to make this diagnosis.
Septic arthritis: in children
• Diagnosis is considered if there is high or spiking fever, loss of weight bearing
or limp, or joint swelling. There may be focal bony tenderness if there is
associated osteomyelitis (especially in infants).
• Most cases occur in young children (50% of cases aged <2 years).
• The lower limb is involved in 75% of cases (knee > hip > ankle). The shoulder
is a commonly affected site.
• Presentation depends on organism and host immunity. Infants may have few
signs and not appear unwell or pyrexial.
• Although >2 joints may be affected, this is rare, and alterative diagnoses
should be considered, e.g. JIA.
• The yield from joint/bone aspirate and biopsy is poor.
• Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause in children, but communityacquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-CA) is
increasingly common. Consider other pathogens by age:
• Neonates: Escherichia coli and group B streptococci.
• 2 months to 5y group A Strep, and Strep. pneumoniae.
• Adolescents: Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
• Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an increasingly recognized, albeit rare cause of
chronic pyogenic arthritis. Mantoux and an IFNγ release assay (IGRA) should
be done in high-risk cases.
• Consider Haemophilus influenzae type B in non-vaccinated children.
• Viral-induced transient synovitis of the hip is an important differential
diagnosis. It is a benign condition, far more common than septic arthritis of the
hip, presenting with hip pain, impaired mobility, apyrexia, and without
systemic upset.
Immediate management of septic arthritis in adults
• Joint immobilization, analgesia, and fluid resuscitation if septic.
• Laboratory testing (FBC, U&E, creatinine, LFT, ESR, and CRP) and blood
cultures.
• Complete joint drainage synovial fluid analysis with Gram stain, culture, and

[SECTION]•

polarized light microscopy.
Joint fluid with a white blood cell count >50,000/mm3 (mainly neutrophils)
and a glucose <400 mg/L is highly suggestive of infection (see Chapter 17).
If crystals are evident, and cultures are negative after 48 hours, a diagnosis of a
crystal arthropathy should be considered (see Chapter 7).
Antibiotic therapy initiation immediately after joint samples have been
obtained. Culture and sensitivity results may change antibiotic therapy as they
become available, but broad-spectrum IV therapy should be given initially.
Joints with implants or prostheses should not be aspirated without prior
discussion with an orthopaedic specialist, and should only be aspirated in
sterile theatre environments; ideally prior to antibiotic administration.
For a non-gonococcal septic arthritis, seek orthopaedic input for joint washout,
and microbiology input to arrange a Gram stain of joint fluid and set up
cultures/special tests for atypical organisms (especially for a septic arthritis
resistant to empiric antibiotics).
Empiric antibiotic treatment in the absence of a positive Gram stain in adults
in a straightforward clinical scenario should be guided by local policies; some
examples regimens are detailed as follows:
• Common regimens include flucloxacillin 2 g IV four times a day ±
gentamicin IV or a third-generation cephalosporin.
• In cases of suspected MRSA infection, discussion with microbiology and
consideration of vancomycin is advised.
• Pseudomonas spp. should be suspected in IV drug users (Table 25.1) and
treated with cephalosporin IV with an aminoglycoside (e.g. gentamicin 3–5
mg/kg IV).
• For further information see Chapter 17.

Management of septic arthritis in children
Follows a similar line to adults and includes a hip ultrasound in children if the
cause of the limp is not obvious. IV antibiotics and analgesia will depend on
local policies, but as a guide according to age (see Table 25.1 and Table 25.2) the
following are recommended

• <3 months old: IV cefotaxime and amoxicillin.
• 3 months: 5 years old: IV cefuroxime.
• >5 years old: IV flucloxacillin
Post-immediate management of septic arthritis in adults
• Regular analgesia review.
• Assess for multiple foci of infection.

[SECTION]• Discontinue any immunosuppressants, but consider stress-dose glucocorticoids
(GCs) if the patient is systemically unwell and has been on long-term GCs.
• Adjust antibiotics according to culture sensitivities and in discussion with an
infectious disease specialist.
• For affected weight-bearing joints, keep non-weight-bearing until there is
obvious improvement in pain and swelling, and you are confident the patient is
on appropriate antimicrobials.
• Physical therapists should be involved early to help passive mobilization of
joint before patient weight-bears.
• The evidence for routine duration of antibiotic course is not strong and the
regimen should be tailored to the individual. A common protocol is IV
antibiotics for 1–2 weeks, followed by oral antibiotics for 2–4 weeks.
• Reasons for limited/no response to treatment can include:
• Alternative diagnosis. Consider crystal-induced MSK disease (see
Chapter 7), RA (see Chapter 5), and spondyloarthritis (see Chapter 8).
• Concomitant crystal-induced MSK disease, reactive arthritis, foreign body,
or flare of underlying arthritis, e.g. RA.
• Inappropriate antimicrobial choice for an atypical organism (e.g.
Mycobacterium marinum, Borrelia, fungus) or multiple infecting organisms
(see Chapter 17).
• Secondary osteomyelitis—especially if treatment had been delayed (see
Chapter 17).
• Surgical lavage may need to be repeated, and surgical synovectomy
considered. Recalcitrant cases may require joint excision ± subsequent
arthroplasty.
Gonococcal septic arthritis
• Synovial fluid and blood cultures can be negative. If gonococcal infection
suspected, re-culture blood but also urethra, cervix (80–90% positive), rectum,
pharynx, any skin pustules, and joint fluid.
• Urine can be tested for gonococcal nucleic acid by PCR.
• Treatment should be guided by local policies but a common regimen is
ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV every 24 hours. An oral switch can be considered
after 24–48 hours when clinical improvement is seen. Treatment should
continue for 7 days.
• Due to increasing organism microbial resistance, treatment with ciprofloxacin
is no longer advisable.
• Consider empiric therapy for Chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg for 7 days
or one dose of azithromycin 1 g, and concurrent testing for HIV and syphilis.

[SECTION]• All sexual partners should receive one dose of ceftriaxone 125 mg IM and
empiric treatment for Chlamydia.

Infections in patients on biologics
• Over the last 10 years, immunosuppressants that specifically inhibit the actions
of TNFα, Il-6, and T cells, and deplete B cells have become widely used to
treat multiple rheumatic diseases (see Chapter 23).
• The risk of infections is increased with use of these ‘biologic’ drugs, although
is probably greater with anti-TNFα agents than other classes. Patients with a
history of serious infections should be treated with this class of drug with
extreme caution and vigilance.
• The risk and severity of infections may be increased in those also taking other
immunosuppressants, typically MTX or GCs.
Common pathogens
• Patients are at particular risk for tuberculosis (TB).
• Disseminated fungal and viral infections can occur (Table 25.3).
• Reactivation of latent infections may be a particular problem.
• Latent histoplasmosis should be considered in patients from endemic regions
or with a history of potential exposure (e.g. caving/potholing, construction).
• Listeriosis should be considered in the context of unpasteurized dairy
consumption.
Tuberculosis and its risk
Reports of TB occurring with biologics advocate taking precautions:
• Screen for latent TB prior to initiation of therapy.
• Screen people who travel to endemic areas and healthcare workers.
• Screen using intradermal injection of PPD and CXR given the possibility of
anergy.
• With PPD injection, induration of ≥5 mm should be considered a positive
response for most patients with rheumatic disease.
• If active TB is found, patients should be treated as per the British Thoracic
Society Guideline and treatment should be postponed until ≥2 months of antiTB therapy has been received.
• Reactivation of TB should be considered in biologic-treated febrile patients
and those not screened for TB before biologic treatment.
• Patients may need a longer than normal course of antibiotics and need careful
reassessment before restarting therapy.

[SECTION]Varicella infections
• If a patient on a biologic, or a household contact, develops primary varicella
(chickenpox), then varicella immunity should be checked.
• People not immune and at significant risk of infection should be given
varicella zoster immunoglobulin within 72 hours. This will provide temporary
immunity.
• If a patient develops shingles, standard treatment should be given and the
biologic withheld.

Acute systemic lupus erythematosus
Acute systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) will manifest either as a flare in
patients with an established diagnosis or as the first presentation of the disease.
Declining C3 and increasing dsDNA titres may predict acute disease flares in
some patients. The reader is referred to Chapter 13 for SLE and to Chapter
11 for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and catastrophic APS.
Diagnosing SLE in an acute medical context
• Consider SLE as a diagnosis in all young and middle-aged women who
present with a history of joint pain, photosensitive rash, or pleuritic chest pain.
• Raynaud’s disease (RD) and recurrent mouth ulcers are non-specific, but may
also appear in association with SLE.
• ANA serology and complement levels may not be available at initial
assessment.
• Inflammatory markers such as the ESR or CRP are not reliable indicators of
SLE activity.
• Although pericardial effusions are common with SLE, they are generally
trivial. Cardiac tamponade is found in <1% of patients. Since the effusion
tends to reflect the overall disease state, generally treatment of the underlying
disease is adequate to resolve the effusion. Rarely, therapeutic
pericardiocentesis is required.
Acute renal SLE (adults)
• Check the BP, send blood for creatinine, U&E, send urine for culture, a spot
urine protein/creatinine ratio (as an estimate of proteinuria) and organize a
renal tract US to rule out post-renal obstruction.
• Quantification of urinary protein and creatinine grades severity of the renal
lesion and guides management approach (Fig. 25.1).
• Control BP aggressively. Use an ACE inhibitor or ARB for those with
proteinuria.
• Biopsy can inform treatment decisions. Induction treatment is usually given
with GCs and oral mycophenolate mofetil (titrate to 1–1.5 g twice daily) or IV
cyclophosphamide.
• GC-induced osteoporosis and cardiovascular risk should be managed from the

[SECTION]outset. Consider getting the following done early: DXA scan, ECG, and fasting
lipid panel.
• Daily calcium (1000–1500 mg) and vitamin D (800 IU) should be
administered to all patients receiving GCs.
• With cyclophosphamide, there is a need to counsel patients about the risks of
infertility, malignancy, and haemorrhagic cystitis, the dosing schedules (e.g.
using mesna), monitoring (FBC at day 10 after and prior to IV pulse), and
Pneumocystis prophylaxis chemotherapy (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole;
Fig. 25.1).

practice. Reproduced from Watts et al. (2013) Oxford Textbook of Rheumatology with permission from
Oxford University Press.

Acute cardiorespiratory SLE (adults)
• Cardiac and isolated pulmonary manifestations of SLE are rare and in many
patients with SLE, acute cardiac and pulmonary features may be due to other

[SECTION]common conditions (Table 25.4).
• CRP elevation may reflect infection or significant pleuropericardial SLE.
Lupus pericarditis alone without evidence of cardiac compromise can be
treated with NSAIDs and prednisone 20–40 mg daily for 2–4 weeks with
subsequent GC dose taper.
• If not due to cardiac failure, acute dyspnoea in SLE may be due to intercurrent
infection, pneumonitis, pulmonary vasculitis, pulmonary embolism,
pulmonary hypertension, or dyspnoea from the pain of pleural serositis.
• Cyclophosphamide should be considered for severe or life-threatening
manifestations of SLE.
Acute haematological SLE (adults)
• Many patients with SLE are Coombs (direct antiglobulin) test positive without
having haemolysis (and do not need treating as such).
• Features of haemolysis include fever, shivers, pyrexia, anaemia, elevated
bilirubin in serum and urine, low serum haptoglobins, and reticulocytosis.
• Acute thrombocytopenia is a relatively frequent presentation.
• If severe, both haemolytic anaemia (Hb <70 mg/L) and thrombocytopenia
(platelets <25,000) require high-dose prednisone 60–80 mg/day and AZA or
CYC (pulsed IV or oral).
Acute renal SLE (paediatrics)
• The most common lesion is Class IV diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis
(30–45% of cases), and carries the worst prognosis.
• One-third of children with acute renal SLE have hypertension which often
needs aggressive management.
• All have microscopic haematuria and proteinuria >3 mg/kg/day. Most have
>25 mg/kg/day proteinuria. Up to 33% have serum albumin >35 g/L. About
50% maintain GFR >100 mL/min/1.73 m2.
• Prognosis and therapy of nephritis is guided by the histopathology active ISNgrade pathological lesion and chronicity index, thus obtaining a biopsy is
important.
• Management should be in a specialist unit, and includes high-dose GCs and
MMF 600mg/m2 BD. In some cases IV CYC uitilising the low- or high- dose
Eurolupus protocol is used for induction or flare of lupus nephritis.
• The value of plasma exchange and IVIg in crescenteric or fulminant renal
disease is unclear but its often considered, and dialysis may ultimately be
necessary.

Mycophenolate

Mycophenolate mofetil (0.5 mg twice daily initially
increasing after 1–2 weeks to 1–1.5 g twice daily) can
be considered if AZA or cyclophosphamide
contraindicated or patient intolerant. It is increasingly
being used instead of cyclophosphamide for inducing
remission in lupus nephritis

Anti-CD20

Though evidence minimal, rituximab (anti-CD20) 1 g
infusion repeated after 2 weeks may be considered if
other immunosuppressants are contraindicated or cause
side effects

Fragility

All patients treated with GCs require daily calcium (1

[SECTION]fracture/osteoporosis g) and vitamin D (800 IU). For all >50 yrs a
bisphosphonate should be offered initially (and
prevention
withdrawn if DXA scan and overall fracture risk
assessment (e.g. FRAX) suggests fracture risk is low.
Local guidelines may exist
Acute haematological SLE (paediatrics)
• Overt haemolysis occurs in <10%, thrombocytopenia in 15–45%.
• Bleeding is uncommon.
• Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is treated with oral GCs, but, when there is
rapidly progressing anaemia, IV methylprednisolone and IVIg may be needed.
• Most patients with thrombocytopenia respond to oral GCs. If there is active
haemorrhage or no response to oral GCs, then IV methylprednisolone and
IVIg may be needed.
• Splenectomy should be avoided.
• A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose catastrophic APS. It is
characterized by multiple organ thromboses and microangiopathy.
• Leucopenia usually resolves as disease activity improves.
• If there is neutropenia with infection, granulocyte colony stimulating factor
can be used to increase the neutrophil count. If neutropenia is due to drug
toxicity and infection is absent, this usually improves with stopping or
decreasing the dose of the offending medication.
• Close working with haematologists will assist interpretation of coagulation
studies and advise on anticoagulant use including factor 10a inhibitors.

Systemic vasculitis
A vasculitis flare should be treated aggressively because permanent damage
from tissue ischaemia may occur rapidly. Patients diagnosed with pulmonary
capillaritis or glomerulonephritis will typically benefit from treatment with pulse
GCs. The specific management of each type of vasculitis is outlined in
Chapter 15. See
Table 4.2 p. 212 for precipitants and associations of
leucocytoclastic small vessel vasculitis and Table 4.3 p. 214 for the range of
laboratory tests needed in patients with suspected vasculitis.
Giant cell (temporal) arteritis
• Since giant cell arteritis (GCA) can lead to cranial ischaemic events including
blindness and stroke, treat empirically if suspected.

[SECTION]• The prevalence of GCA increases with age. Visual changes, jaw claudication,
and diplopia in the setting of B-type symptoms all support the diagnosis of
GCA.
• Empiric therapy is with prednisone 40–60 mg daily for 1 month but if there are
visual symptoms, urgent ophthalmology examination is essential.
• Ischaemic GCA-related ocular pathology is treated with methylprednisolone 1
g IV for 3 days.
• Daily low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of cranial ischaemic events, and
should be used as part of standard therapy unless there is a clear
contraindication.
• Treatment should not be delayed. Biopsy is diagnostically useful up for some
weeks after GC therapy is initiated.
• To optimize yield, temporal artery biopsy should be bilateral, with samples
>1.5 cm in length.
‘Severe’ vasculitis
• Patients with active vasculitis can quickly develop manifestations that threaten
life or the function of a vital organ.
• Patients with a potential flare of vasculitis, already on immunosuppression,
need thorough assessment to rule out infection initially—see Tables 4.2 and
4.3 (p. 212 and p. 214).
• Severe manifestations of the small vessel vasculitides include pulmonary
haemorrhage (or capillaritis) and glomerulonephritis. Severe manifestations of
medium vessel vasculitis include mononeuritis multiplex (e.g. foot drop/wrist
drop) and mesenteric angina/ischaemia.
• When glomerulonephritis is suspected, renal biopsy should always be
considered.
• Severe vasculitis is generally treated with pulse methylprednisolone 1 g IV for
3 days, followed by prednisone 1 mg/kg/day.
• Most patients with severe vasculitis will also be treated with
cyclophosphamide 1.5–2.0 mg/kg/day. Lower doses should be used in the
elderly or in patients with renal insufficiency.
• Plasmapheresis can be life-saving for AAV-related pulmonary vasculitis; not
all centres have a facility to give plasmapheresis though.
• Cyclophosphamide places patients at risk for Pneumocystis infection, and
appropriate chemoprophylaxis should be instituted.
• In patients who decline on clinical grounds, despite immunosuppression, then
infections mimicking vasculitis should be considered.

[SECTION]Systemic sclerosis ‘crises’
Renal crisis
• This may manifest as an acute or subacute hypertensive crisis, usually within
the first 4 years after diagnosis of diffuse systemic sclerosis (dcSScl). It can be
the presenting feature of SScl (see Chapter 13). It rarely occurs in limited
cutaneous SScl (lcSScl).
• An abrupt increase in BP >150/85 and new renal insufficiency are consistent
with this diagnosis. Very occasionally patients are normotensive, and
paradoxically subject to a poorer prognosis.
• Other manifestations include those of a hypertensive emergency:
microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, encephalopathy, and hypertensive
retinopathy.
• Urinalysis is usually normal.
Management
• ACE inhibitors are the cornerstone of renal crisis management.
• The patient should be treated with escalating doses of captopril until BP is
brought under control. Calcium channel blockers can be added sequentially if
captopril is inadequate.
• Fast drops in BP should be avoided, as low perfusion pressures in abnormal
renal vessels may worsen renal failure.
• Early consulting with a nephrologist about the potential need for
haemodialysis is prudent.
• Prompt initial treatment can lead to return of good renal function.
Pulmonary hypertension crisis
(See also Chapter 13.)
• Primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) occurs as a complication of
lcSScl, although it can also occur in dcSScl (both as a primary feature and
secondary to pulmonary fibrosis).
• Echocardiography can be used to screen for PAH. A RVSP estimate of >40
mmHg is suggestive, but the diagnosis must be confirmed by right heart
catheterization.
• Decompensated PAH presents with dyspnoea, syncope, raised JVP, loud P2
heart sound, and ankle oedema.
Management
• Intensive coronary care unit monitoring is essential.
• Patients with rapidly decompensating heart failure secondary to PAH should

[SECTION]be treated with supplemental oxygen, diuresis.
• Continuous IV epoprostenol can be considered but decreasing cardiac preload
too much can reduce overall pulmonary perfusion if the PA is not responsive.
• Diuretics decrease right ventricular preload, and can lead to significant
symptomatic relief.
• A large pulmonary embolism can also result in rapidly worsening of PAH, and
should be considered contributory if the PAH was known to be high
previously, if there is APS and in the appropriate setting.

Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis
This is rare but can occur in any patient taking methotrexate (MTX).
Epidemiology and risk factors
• Incidence 5–70 per 1000 patients per year taking MTX. It is probably much
rarer in children/adolescents compared with adults.
• Life-threatening pneumonitis requiring hospital admission occurs in <1%
patients taking MTX.
• Mild pneumonitis likely resolves on drug withdrawal alone.
• Most patients suffering from pneumonitis do so within the first few months of
starting MTX or after a significant dose change.
• In patients on stable-dose MTX, blood levels may change in the setting of
progressive renal insufficiency or low levels of folate.
• Consider the diagnosis in all patients on MTX with acute onset of dry cough,
dyspnoea, headache, and fever.
• The differential diagnosis lies between chest infection, acute pulmonary
oedema, or acute interstitial lung disease associated with the underlying
condition.
Management of severe toxicity
• Stop MTX.
• Intensive respiratory care is not often needed but should be considered. Severe
cases need supplemental oxygen and blood transfusion.
• Assess for infection. Consider bronchoalveolar lavage for samples and highresolution lung CT. It may be necessary to treat empirically for the most likely
pathogens, while awaiting results.
• Optimal therapy for MTX-induced pneumonitis has not been well defined.
Folinic acid (15–25 mg orally four times a day) may reverse MTX toxicity.
• Anecdotally, GCs accelerate recovery. In cases of severe respiratory

[SECTION]decompensation, treat with methylprednisolone 1 g IV for 3 days, followed by
prednisone 1 mg/kg/day. Prednisone can be tapered over the subsequent 1–6
months, depending on disease severity.
• Most patients with MTX-induced lung injury will recover, but may have
chronic lung damage as a result.

Macrophage activation syndrome
Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is rare but is life-threatening (mortality
is 8–22%). MAS can complicate other diseases. MAS is also termed secondary
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). For a summary, see
http://www.the-rheumatologist.org/article/macrophage-activation-syndrome/6/
Pathology
• Activated macrophages engulf other haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow,
liver, and spleen.
• Polyclonal T- and NK-cell activation is associated with a cytokine ‘storm’ with
consequent extensive immunological abnormalities.
Presentation and clinical features
• A high level of suspicion remains key to MAS diagnosis as it may present
insidiously in an already unwell child.
• Unremitting fever and high levels of persistent inflammation despite broadspectrum antibiotics or an unexpected fall in ESR associated with new-onset
cytopenia and hyperferritinaemia should raise suspicion of MAS.
• MAS can be the initial presentation or a complication of oncologic, infectious,
and rheumatic disorders, including systemic-onset JIA, SLE, and Kawasaki
disease and less commonly juvenile DM, PAN, polyarticular JIA, MCTD, and
other autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions.
• Sepsis should be considered as a cause.
• Infective triggers of MAS include EBV, VZV, CMV, coxsackievirus,
parvovirus B19, hepatitis A, Salmonella, and enterococcus.
• If MAS is the initial presentation of an inflammatory illness, assessment
should be made for malignancy.
• By contrast to MAS/secondary HLH, primary HLH is usually seen in children
<2 years old, with consanguineous parents. There may be a history of death of
young family member with unexplained fever, and a primary central nervous
system presentation.
Diagnosis

[SECTION]Clinical features are not specific for diagnosis. Combinations of typical features
are often present and high suspicion for the diagnosis remains important; see
Table 25.5.
• New diagnostic criteria for MAS in the context of active SoJIA1 include:
• Ferritin >684 ng/mL.
• Plus ≥2 of the following: platelet count <181 × 109/L, AST >48 U/L,
triglycerides >156 mg/dL, fibrinogen <360 mg/dL.
• The value of testing for CD25 and CD163 positive circulating lymphocytes,
low NK-cell activity, haemophagocytosis in bone marrow, liver, spleen, or
lymph nodes, high D-dimer, and abnormal perforin expression, is debatable.
Table 25.5 Clinical and laboratory features of macrophage activation syndrome

Clinical signs

Laboratory findings

• High, persistent, unremitting
fever or change in pattern of
fever
• New-onset hepatosplenomegaly
• Neurological
manifestations
including irritability
• Lymphadenopathy
• New-onset heart, lung, or kidney
failure
• Petechiae or haemorrhages

• Low/falling ESR in context of active
inflammatory disease or high CRP
• Low/rapidly falling white blood cells,
Hb, or platelet count
• Low/falling or unexpectedly normal
platelet count
• Low/falling or unexpected normal
fibrinogen
• Rising AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin,
triglycerides and LDH
• Ferritin higher than would be expected
for patient’s diagnosis

Haemophagocytosis in the bone marrow aspirate is present in 60% of MAS cases, and tends to be a
relatively late sign. Absence of haemophagocytosis does not rule out MAS.

Treatment
• Treatment should be started promptly as delayed treatment is associated with
poor prognosis.
• Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment is usually started in cases other than those
with active autoimmune conditions.
• First-line treatment of IV then oral GCs is effective in >50% of cases. For
example: methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day (maximum 1 g) for 3 consecutive
days, followed by oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day and then dose tapering.
• If there is a poor response to steroids, IVIg 1–2g/kg is recommended.

[SECTION]• IL-1 inhibition (e.g. anakinra) is dramatically effective in MAS associated
with SoJIA (and increases survival rate vs placebo in adult sepsis + MAS
features). Anakinra is given SC or IV 2–8 mg/Kg/day (max 100mg/dose) in 1–
4 divided doses.
• In refractory disease other options include anti-IL-6r (tocilizumab), antiTNFα, etoposide, rituximab (anti-CD20+ B-cell therapy) for EBV-driven
MAS, and cyclophosphamide in SLE-associated MAS.

Paediatric osteomyelitis
In children, osteomyelitis is most common in infants; 50% of cases occur before
5 years of age.
• There is usually a history of trauma, typically involving the metaphysis of long
bones.
• Osteomyelitis can arise from haematogenous spread of pathogens from a
primary site (e.g. lung, skin ear, nose, or throat) or by direct inoculation from
open fractures or penetrating wounds.
• There are acute, subacute (2–3 weeks’ delay), chronic (rare in children), and
non-bacterial (e.g. CRMO or SAPHO) forms of osteomyelitis (see also
Chapter 17).

Malignancies presenting with musculoskeletal
symptoms in children
Causes
The annual incidence of primary malignant tumours of bone, synovium, or
muscle is 6 per 1 million children. The main causes are osteosarcoma (about
50% of cases) and Ewing sarcoma (40–45% of cases).
• Widespread MSK symptoms may of course be from bone metastases from
osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma.
• Bone marrow infiltration by different lymphoproliferative disorders can
present with MSK symptoms.

[SECTION]Presentation and clinical features
• Malignancy should be suspected, particularly in an adolescent if there is
persistent pain of long bones or vertebrae of >2 weeks with associated:
• point tenderness.
• night awakening.
• pain out of proportion for clinical findings.
• Other features can include bony swelling or enlargement, weight loss, malaise,
pathological fracture (5–10%), and rarely, lung involvement.
• A mass increasing in size, extending deep into soft tissues, or a presumed
exostosis >5 cm, should raise the possibility of malignancy.
• The associated arthritis usually involves large joints, is mild, migratory, and
often without morning joint stiffness.
Investigation and management
• Early referral to a paediatric oncologist is essential.
• Making a diagnosis prior to metastasis greatly enhances the prognosis.
Mortality rate following metastasis is 40%.
• Blood tests may show increased inflammatory markers and LDH. FBC is often
normal initially, but there may be a reduction trend in platelet count and
haemoglobin. A low leucocyte count is a late sign.
• A blood film showing blast cells is pathognomonic for leukaemia.
• A bone marrow aspirate or tissue biopsy provides a histological diagnosis and
can facilitate tumour grading.
• Tumour staging is dependent on the diagnosis, histological grade, and both
size and location of the tumour.
Imaging
• Plain radiographs characterize the primary bone tumour.
• US is important to screen for hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and
further define soft tissue masses such as lipoma or vascular malformation.
• MRI provides specific information regarding the tumour nature and size and
the surrounding soft tissue involvement.
• MRI images facilitate the planning of a biopsy.
• CT helps define tumour anatomy prior to surgery and to evaluate for
metastases locally, though bone scintigraphy or whole-body MRI are useful
investigations to get an overview of any skeletal metastases.
Treatment
• Therapy measures are beyond the scope of the text here. However, for
overviews see references 2 and 3 for osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma

[SECTION]management respectively.
Other malignancies
Many childhood malignancies have MSK features at presentation, in particular
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), lymphoma, and neuroblastoma.
• Isolated hip or back involvement in a young child raises the suspicion of
leukaemia in the absence of sepsis. Risk factors for leukaemia include
conditions such as Down’s syndrome.
• Back pain can be a presenting feature of neuroblastoma in young children and
toddlers and is attributable to metastases which occur in 75% of patients at
diagnosis.
• Limb pain in leukaemia and lymphoma is due to marrow invasion. Pain is
usually intense and continuous and associated with night awakening. Local
signs, such as arthritis or erythema, may be absent.
• All malignancies can be associated with systemic features such as pallor,
petechiae, bruising, weight loss, and fever.
• In lymphoma, there may be hypertrophic osteoarthropathy associated with
painful periostitis and lymphadenopathy.
• Investigations should include checking FBC, LDH, LFTs, a blood film,
measuring urinary catecholamines/metadrenalines, CXR, and abdominal US.
• Bone marrow aspirate and whole-body MRI are then more definitive
investigations.

PREFACE
A sound understanding of pathology is crucial to the study and practice of clinical medicine.
Moreover, an appreciation of the basics of this challenging subject helps students and doctors
provide answers to the vital questions of how and why disease affects their patients. Despite
its paramount importance, pathology is often poorly covered in the medical school syllabus
though heavily represented in undergraduate and postgraduate examinations. We therefore
hope that these 100 cases encompassing histopathology, clinical biochemistry, immunology,
genetics, haematology and microbiology will provide medical students and junior doctors an
insight into the pathologic basis of common clinical problems as well as helping in preparation for assessments.

CASE 1:

POLYURIA AND POLYDIPSIA

History
A 45-year-old woman with a history of hypothyroidism presents to her GP with a three-month
history of passing urine more frequently, including up to three times at night. She finds that her
constant desire to drink fluids, particularly cold water, and her frequent need to visit the toilet
are bothersome since she works as a teacher. Apart from hypothyroidism, she has no other
health problems and takes no regular medications.

Examination
Peripherally, the patient is warm and well perfused, with no evidence of dehydration.
Examination of her heart, lungs, and abdomen is unremarkable. Neurologic examination is
normal. Urine dipstick is negative.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 1
This woman presents with polyuria, nocturia and polydipsia. These symptoms have four
important differential diagnoses: (1) diabetes mellitus, (2) diabetes insipidus, which may
either be central or nephrogenic in origin, (3) hypercalcaemia, which may present like the
above in an acute setting, and (4) primary polydipsia (PP). Therefore, investigations need to
be directed at elucidating one of the above diagnoses. For diabetes mellitus, a fingerprick glucose may be performed, but formal fasting or random serum glucose is needed to make a diagnosis. Simple urinalysis may show the presence of glucose, which would point towards this
diagnosis. Measurement of corrected serum calcium is needed to look for hypercalcaemia.
Diabetes insipidus is a relatively rare disease characterized by the excretion of large volumes
of dilute urine as a result of either a deficiency of or a resistance to the actions of the posterior pituitary hormone antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin
(AVP). ADH is released into the circulation from the posterior pituitary gland in response
to an increase in serum osmolality, and acts to increase reabsorption of water by causing
the insertion of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) channels into the apical membrane of the distal parts
of the nephron. Deficiency of ADH leads to central diabetes insipidus (CDI), while failure of
the kidney to respond to its actions causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI).
Diagnosis of diabetes insipidus includes basic laboratory investigations and a fluid deprivation test. Hypernatraemia may be found secondary to dehydration, while urinalysis may show
a low specific gravity (<1.005). Serum osmolality is increased due to excess free water loss. It
may be formally measured, or estimated using the formula: 2 × [Na+] + [urea] + [­glucose],
as these are the main solutes in plasma. (For this patient, estimated serum osmolality
would be around 300 mOsm/kg.) Similarly, urine osmolality will be low, generally less than
200 mOsm/kg, due to inadequate reabsorption of water from the distal parts of the nephron.
When the diagnosis is equivocal, a fluid deprivation test may be performed. Patients are
withheld from fluid intake under close supervision for a period of 8 hours, with hourly measurement of body weight, urine volume and urine osmolality. After allowing a sufficient time
for dehydration, desmopressin (synthetic ADH) is administered subcutaneously, and a final
urine sample is taken one hour afterwards to measure urine osmolality. The table below
shows how the results may be interpreted:

Diagnosis
CDI
NDI
PP
Non-diagnostic

The essence of the test is that with CDI, urine will become more concentrated once the deficient ADH is replaced, whereas with NDI, the inability of the kidney to respond to ADH
means that any further replacement by ADH has no effect.
CDI is commonly idiopathic though autoantibodies against ADH-secreting cells of the
hypothalamus are found in several cases. Moreover, these patients tend to exhibit other
autoimmune conditions, so the patient in our case is most likely to fall into this category,
4

Case 1: Polyuria and polydipsia

since she has a background of hypothyroidism. Other causes of CDI include benign or
malignant tumours of the brain (such as germinomas and craniopharyngiomas), neurosurgery, head injury, and infiltrative conditions (such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis). There
are also genetic forms of the disease, with the majority being inherited in an autosomal
dominant fashion with mutations in the ADH gene.
Treatment of diabetes insipidus depends on whether it is cranial or nephrogenic in origin.
CDI responds well to ADH replacement, usually via the synthetic analogue, desmopressin
(DDAVP). High-dose DDAVP may be used for mild cases of NDI, but treatment of NDI
requires management of the underlying cause (e.g. correcting metabolic abnormalities, discontinuing any offending drugs). In any case, treatment is required only if the patient is suffering from severe dehydration, with urine volumes >4 L per day.
KEY POINTS

• Causes of polyuria and polydipsia include diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus,
hypercalcaemia and primary polydipsia.

• Diabetes insipidus is due either to inadequate central production of ADH or failure
of the kidneys to respond to ADH.

• Central diabetes insipidus is frequently idiopathic and managed with synthetic
ADH (desmopressin).

Case 2: Traces of blood found on a routine urine dipstick

CASE 2: TRACES OF BLOOD FOUND ON A ROUTINE
URINE DIPSTICK

History
A 60-year-old office executive presents to his GP for his yearly ‘well man’ check. He reports
no significant health problems. He has a history of hypertension treated with lisinopril, type
2 diabetes controlled by diet and exercise, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), for which
he takes tamsulosin. He has a family history of prostate cancer, in his father and two paternal
uncles. He has a 20 pack-year smoking history.

Examination
Physical examination is unremarkable. Digital rectal examination confirms a large, smooth
prostate. Urine dipstick shows ++ blood, but no other abnormalities.

Questions
1. What are the causes of non-visible haematuria?
2. What features in the history might warrant the haematuria to be further investigated by the GP or merit referral to secondary care?
3. What investigations need to be performed in the Urology clinic to elucidate the
cause in this patient?

7

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 2
Haematuria is classified as either visible or non-visible, with the latter defined as the presence
of 3–5 red blood cells per high power field on urine microscopy on at least two of three examinations over a period of 2–3 weeks. Visible haematuria is less prevalent than non-­v isible
haematuria and is defined as a single observation of gross urine discolouration by blood.
While the same pathologies may cause either visible or non-visible haematuria, the relative
frequency of these causes varies between the two.
The causes of non-visible haematuria are:
1. Glomerular (e.g. glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, hereditary causes)
2. Non-glomerular
a. Upper urinary tract (nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, renal cell carcinoma, cystic
disease of the kidney, renal trauma, metabolic derangements such as hypercalciuria)
b. Lower urinary tract (bladder and prostate cancer, benign lesions such as BPH
and bladder papillomas, urethritis, cystitis)
3. Other (e.g. excess anticoagulation, ‘march’ haematuria)
Malignancy and urolithiasis are the underlying cause in 10% of patients while a significant
proportion of cases turn out to be unexplainable. Glomerular and non-glomerular causes
may be distinguished by the presence of proteinuria, which is often found in the former but
not the latter.
While an isolated dipstick-positive haematuria does not necessarily immediately merit further evaluation, features in the history may help the GP decide whether or not to investigate
further – the family history of prostate cancer, as well as the patient’s history of BPH and
smoking history, would be worrying features. The GP should also look for causes such as
exercise, recent sexual activity, or any trauma to the urinary tract.
Evaluation of haematuria in secondary care occurs in a systematic manner, with ‘one-stop’
haematuria clinics becoming the norm. Urine dipstick, microscopy and culture are required,
and renal function should be assessed. In the presence of proteinuria and deranged renal function, referral to a nephrologist is merited since a glomerular cause is likely. Urine m
­ icroscopy
helps to confirm haematuria as well as looking for potential clues to the cause (e.g. red cell
casts in glomerulonephritis), while culture will identify infection.
Work-up then proceeds to the upper and lower urinary tracts. The cornerstone of upper
­urinary tract investigation is imaging via ultrasound or CT urography; CT is preferred as
it has higher sensitivity and specificity. In around 30% of patients, the above investigations
will identify a cause; the remainder require lower urinary tract investigations. Urine cytology is required to look for urothelial malignancy, and cystoscopy should be considered as
it has higher sensitivity than cytology for diagnosing bladder cancer. It is generally recommended for all patients with non-visible haematuria over the age of 40, and for anyone with
risk ­factors for bladder malignancy.
KEY POINTS

• Haematuria has a number of causes and should always be taken seriously.
• Investigation of haematuria includes urinary testing, assessment of renal function,
imaging of the upper urinary tract and possibly cystoscopy.

• Painless haematuria should raise the suspicion of bladder cancer.

Case 3: Confusion, lethargy and shortness of breath

CASE 3:

CONFUSION, LETHARGY AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH

History
A retired 68-year-old man is admitted to the Medical Assessment Unit with a three-month
history of progressive shortness of breath, lethargy and recent-onset confusion. He is now
short of breath at rest and has noted that he has very little energy. His past medical history
includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild hypertension. He has a 20 packyear smoking history.

Examination
Respiratory rate is 24, with an O2 saturation of 94% on air. Breath sounds are reduced in the
right mid-zone. JVP is not elevated and there is no peripheral oedema.

Questions
1. What are the possible causes of hyponatraemia?
2. What is the likely diagnosis and underlying pathophysiology in this case?
3. How should the patient be managed next?

9

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 3
Hyponatraemia is defined as a serum sodium concentration of less than 135 mM. It is a
­common problem, particularly in hospitalized patients, and is generally a secondary phenomenon to an underlying pathologic or physiologic process.
Plasma osmolality may be increased, normal, or decreased in hyponatraemia, and is reduced
in the majority of cases. Hypertonic hyponatraemia arises when solutes in the extracellular
fluid (as occurring with hyperglycaemia or with hypertonic mannitol infusion) draw water
across from cells. Isotonic hyponatraemia usually arises with retention of isosmotic fluid in
the extracellular space (e.g. isotonic glucose infusion), or when severe hyperlipidaemia or
hyperproteinaemia reduces the fractional water content, leading to a ‘pseudohyponatraemia’.
Hypotonic hyponatraemia is most common. This may be in the presence of a reduced, normal
or increased extracellular fluid volume. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia is caused by sodium
depletion, either by renal or extra-renal means. Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia occurs with
retention of sodium and water, which is due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-­a ldosterone
axis secondary to heart failure, cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome. In our case, fluid status
appears normal, indicating the presence of euvolaemic hyponatraemia. Here, sodium content
is diluted by water excess, the causes of which include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone (SIADH), hypothyroidism, and a reduced intake of solutes.
SIADH is the most frequent cause of hyponatraemia and describes a condition where
antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels are inappropriately high for the plasma osmolal­
ity. The key diagnostic criteria for SIADH are (1) reduced plasma osmolality <275 mOsm,
(2) urine osmolality >100 mOsm, (3) clinical euvolaemia and (4) continued natriuresis
>40 mM in the presence of (5) normal thyroid and adrenal function, and (6) without recent
use of diuretics. Common conditions causing SIADH include malignancy (especially small
cell lung cancer), lung disease (including pneumonia, TB and cystic fibrosis), cranial disease
(encephalitis, meningitis and trauma), and drugs (e.g. SSRIs and antipsychotics).
Here, the history of lethargy and shortness of breath in a smoker together with a suspicious
chest radiograph suggests a paraneoplastic process. Small cell lung cancers are thought to
arise from neuroendocrine progenitor cells of the lining bronchial epithelium and can secrete
high levels of ADH with resultant hyponatraemia.
The management of SIADH is directed at the underlying cause – in this case, this would
involve management (typically via chemotherapy) of the lung malignancy. In the short term,
fluid restriction is the cornerstone of treatment; the aim should be to gradually correct the
electrolyte abnormality since too rapid a correction can lead to osmotic demyelination in the
central nervous system (central pontine myelinolysis).
KEY POINTS

• When faced with hyponatraemia, first ask yourself whether plasma osmolality is
reduced, increased or normal.

• The most common cause of a hypotonic hyponatraemia where fluid status is
­normal is SIADH.

• In addition to treating the underlying cause, patients with SIADH require fluid
restriction.

Case 4: A child with facial swelling

CASE 4:

A CHILD WITH FACIAL SWELLING

History
A seven-year-old boy is brought into the Emergency Department by his mother as she has
noticed his face ­‘swelling up’ in the past week. The boy has also told her that his urine is
becoming bubbly. Apart from a sore throat two weeks ago, the boy has been fit and well,
though he has felt a bit ‘off colour’ since the minor illness. He does not have any known
allergies.

Examination
Physical examination reveals a well-looking child with bilateral periorbital oedema and
­bilateral pitting pedal oedema.

3. What is the pathophysiology of the most likely cause, and what should the mother
be told about the likely prognosis?

11

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 4
The spectrum of findings found in this patient – proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and
oedema – comprises the nephrotic syndrome. The initiating event is the leakage of large
amounts of protein (>3.5 g per day) in urine, which results in hypoalbuminaemia. The subsequent fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to redistribution of extracellular fluid to the interstitial compartment, producing oedema. Nephrotic syndrome should be distinguished from
nephritic syndrome, the latter representing an inflammatory process often characterized by
haematuria, uraemia and a degree of renal failure, whereas the former typically represents a
degenerative process.
There are numerous consequences of proteinuria, which need to be the subject of further
investigations. The hypoalbuminaemic state provokes an increased rate of hepatic protein
synthesis, which leads to hyperlipidaemia and, on occasion, lipiduria. The loss of protein
leads to other metabolic derangements as well, principally hypocalcaemia. Nephrotic syndrome is also associated with a hypercoagulable state, with a particular association with
renal vein thrombosis. The cause for this is unclear, but hypotheses include (1) excess loss
of anticoagulant factors (such as protein S and antithrombin) in urine and increased production of procoagulant factors (such as factors V and VIII) by the liver, (2) increased
platelet aggregation, (3) immune-complex-mediated injury to the glomerulus, causing a
procoagulant effect, and (4) increased production of lipoprotein (a).
The causes of nephrotic syndrome may be grouped into two categories:
1. Primary glomerular disorders, such as minimal change disease, membranous glomerulopathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and other glomerulonephritides
2. Systemic diseases affecting the kidney, such as diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, systemic
lupus erythematosus, and drugs (e.g. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories [NSAIDs]).
The commonest cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is minimal change disease (MCD).
Here, the history of an upper respiratory tract infection is suggestive of MCD given the
­temporal association between the two.
The term minimal change disease refers to the fact that the histologic appearance of nephrons
in diseased individuals looks normal. However, on electron microscopy, effacement of podocyte foot processes in the glomerulus is observed. The pathogenesis of MCD is uncertain,
with the most popular theory proposing that it arises as a disorder of T-cell function, with
release of several cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13, that injure the glomerulus.
Treatment of the first attack of MCD is via steroids, typically for a period of around 6–8
weeks, and the majority of children achieve a complete remission. Relapses may be treated
with steroids, or, in refractory cases, with immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide or
cyclosporine. In any case, the majority of children with MCD stop having relapses and live a
normal life without any evidence of renal failure or urinary abnormalities.
KEY POINTS

• Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and
oedema.

• The commonest cause of nephrotic syndrome in a child is minimal change disease
(MCD).

• Treatment of MCD principally involves use of corticosteroids, and most children
can be anticipated to make a full recovery with retention of normal renal function.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 5
The key features in this history are arthralgia, headache and fatigue, which are non-specific
and give a wide differential. However, the examination findings and investigations reduce the
number of possibilities significantly. The investigations reveal a normocytic anaemia with
an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), possibly suggesting haemolytic anaemia, with a
borderline thrombocytopenia and positive ANA, against the background of normal thyroid,
renal and liver function. ANA positivity is not specific for any particular autoimmune disease but does raise this possibility. In this case, ANA positivity points towards a differential of
autoimmune or connective tissue disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjögren’s syndrome, and
inflammatory myopathies, such as dermatomyositis and polymyositis.
Indeed, this patient meets the American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the diagnosis of SLE, as she has (1) arthritis, (2) neurologic symptoms, (3) haemolytic anaemia, and
(4) positive ANA. While SLE can be putatively diagnosed with these conditions, further
investigations would be useful in confirming this. In particular, specific autoantibodies for
SLE (e.g. anti-dsDNA and anti-SmAg) would be helpful in making the diagnosis. Given the
history of a miscarriage, antiphospholipid antibodies could be tested, to exclude lupus anticoagulant syndrome.
The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood, with genetic, environmental, hormonal and
immunoregulatory factors all playing a part in the ultimate breakdown of self-tolerance,
which leads to organ injury. One theory is that a defect in clearance of apoptotic or necrotic
cells leads to the sensitization of T- and B-cells to intracellular antigens, triggering the autoimmune process. For example, deficiencies of early complement components (C1q, C4),
which are important for these clearance processes, produce an SLE-like syndrome. Other
hypotheses include aberrant T-cell signal transduction as well as overexpression of particular
cytokines (in particular type I interferons).
Tissue injury in SLE is immune-complex mediated (type III hypersensitivity) as a result of
defective clearance of apoptotic or necrotic cells due to deficiency of Fc and complement
receptors. The most important complication arises in the kidney, where immune complex
accumulation stimulates secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by mesangial cells and
podocytes, giving rise to lupus nephritis. About 50% of patients develop clinically evident
renal disease, which carries substantial morbidity if severe. Further complications of SLE
include an increased cardiovascular risk due to accelerated atherogenesis, arising from
inflammatory damage to the endothelium. While prognosis is variable, depending on the
extent of organ involvement, current treatments are reasonably effective, with overall 10-year
survival more than 90%.
KEY POINTS

• A positive ANA does not definitively indicate the presence of an autoimmune condition but should prompt suspicion of such.

• SLE is a multi-system autoimmune disorder whose presentation is protean.
• The most important complication of SLE is kidney damage, which may affect up to
half of all patients and carries substantial morbidity.

History
An otherwise healthy 32-year-old woman presents to the General Medical Clinic with a
­feeling of being ‘on edge’ for three months. She also reports difficulty sleeping, increased
irritability, ‘grittiness’ in her eyes, and reduced frequency of her periods. She has lost 5 kg in
weight over the same period. Family history is notable for rheumatoid arthritis in her mother.

Examination
Her pulse is 90 and regular, and she has warm, slightly sweaty peripheries along with a fine
bilateral tremor. Proptosis is noted, and a diffusely enlarged thyroid is palpable.
INVESTIGATIONS

1. Suggest a differential diagnosis in this patient. Which is most likely?
2. Discuss the pathophysiology of the likely diagnosis and suggest further investigations that may be useful.
3. What is the explanation for the visual signs and symptoms?
4. Suggest a preliminary management plan for this patient.

15

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 6
The cardiovascular, neurologic, reproductive and metabolic findings are classic symptoms of
a thyrotoxic state. Hyperthyroidism specifically refers to the increased production of thyroid
hormone by the thyroid gland, and the suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level
and high levels of T4 and T3 confirm that it is the cause of thyrotoxicosis here. The most
important causes of hyperthyroidism are:
• Autoimmune disease (Graves’ disease)
• Thyroidal autonomy (e.g. toxic multinodular goitre, toxic adenoma, functional thyroid carcinoma)
• Inflammatory conditions affecting the thyroid (e.g. painless thyroiditis, subacute
thyroiditis)
• Exogenous source of thyroid hormone (e.g. ‘hamburger’ thyrotoxicosis, surreptitious use of thyroxine)
• Drug-induced (e.g. amiodarone, radiographic contrast dyes)
The features of hyperthyroidism, the presence of eye disease, a diffusely enlarged thyroid,
and the absence of any history of any drug use or recent infection are all suggestive of Graves’
disease, which is the underlying cause of 50–80% of cases of hyperthyroidism.
Graves’ disease affects less than 1% of the population, with a 5:1 female preponderance. It is
an autoimmune disorder where autoantibodies against various proteins (including the TSH
receptor, thyroid peroxidase enzyme, and thyroglobulin) bind and activate the TSH receptor.
This stimulates thyroid follicular hyperplasia and hypertrophy, leading to diffuse thyroid
enlargement and increased thyroid hormone synthesis.
Further investigations that may help support the diagnosis of Graves’ disease include measurement of autoantibodies, though these are not formally needed for diagnosis. Radioiodineuptake studies would help distinguish Graves’ (uniformly high uptake) from a toxic adenoma
(solitary ‘hot’ nodule), toxic multinodular goitre (patchy uptake), and subacute thyroiditis (low uptake). A neck CT or MRI may be required if there are features of upper airway
obstruction, while a thyroid ultrasound could help identify any nodules and provide a means
for biopsy in uncertain cases.
Testing for ophthalmopathy is important in Graves’ disease as the eyes are affected in 50% of
cases, and the condition is serious enough to threaten sight loss in 2–3%. Symptoms of Graves’
ophthalmopathy include diplopia, grittiness, photophobia and tearing, while the ­characteristic
signs include eyelid retraction, lid lag, proptosis, cheimosis and o
­phthalmoplegia. The
­pathophysiology is uncertain but is thought to be due to autoreactive T-cells reacting against
antigens in the eye, causing the activation of orbital fibroblasts with subsequent synthesis of
extracellular matrix. These serve to displace the eyeball forward, and may interfere with the
function of the extraocular muscles.
The management options for Graves’ hyperthyroidism include anti-thyroid drugs,
­radioiodine treatment, and surgery. Randomized data have shown that all three are equally
effective, with anti-thyroid drugs (e.g. carbimazole) preferred as initial management in
Europe. Beta-blockers may be used to provide rapid symptomatic relief prior to initiation of
definitive management.

16

Case 6: Anxiety, irritability and reduced menstrual frequency

KEY POINTS

• Hyperthyroidism specifically refers to increased production of thyroid hormone by
the thyroid gland, and is the commonest cause of thyrotoxicosis.

• Graves’ disease is the most frequent cause of hyperthyroidism and is an autoimmune disorder where autoantibodies stimulate the TSH receptor.

• Ophthalmopathy is an important complication of Graves’ disease and may be due
to T-cells reacting against retro-orbital antigens.

Case 7: Screening for prostate cancer?

CASE 7:

SCREENING FOR PROSTATE CANCER?

History
A 55-year-old Caucasian man presents to his GP with questions on a recent news article that
he has read on prostate cancer screening. As he has a family history of the disease (his father
and uncle were both diagnosed with the disease in their 70s), he wishes to undergo screening
for the disease via PSA (prostate specific antigen) measurement. He does not complain of any
lower urinary tract symptoms. He has a background of diet-controlled diabetes mellitus and
hypertension, for which he takes amlodipine.

Examination
Cardiac, respiratory and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. On digital rectal examination, the GP finds what he believes to be a benign-feeling prostate.
INVESTIGATIONS
The patient’s most recent full blood count and renal function are within normal limits.

Questions
1. Describe the principles of screening and what criteria are used to determine the
quality of a screening test.
2. What is the PSA screening test, and what are the ways in which it may be used in a
more accurate fashion?
3. What is the current evidence on PSA screening for prostate cancer? Would you
­recommend it in this case?

19

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 7
Screening is a public health service where members of the whole population are offered a test
that helps identify those at higher risk of the disease so that they may undergo further testing. In the UK, screening takes place from birth to older age, including programmes such as
foetal anomaly testing, infectious diseases in pregnancy, the newborn blood spot, diabetic
eye screening and cancer screening (bowel, breast and cervical). The criteria for a suitable
screening test, as defined by Wilson and Jungner for the World Health Organisation in 1968,
state that:
• The disease being screened should be an important health problem.
• The natural history of the disease should be well understood.
• There should be an identifiable early stage of disease.
• Treatment at an early stage should be of more benefit than at a later stage.
• There should be a suitable test to identify the early stage.
• The test should be acceptable to the population.
• The intervals for repeating the test should be well defined.
• Suitable facilities should exist to account for the workload resulting from screening.
• Risks of the test, both physical and psychological, should be less than the anticipated
benefits.
• Costs should be balanced against benefits.
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer overall in the UK and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. PSA is an enzyme produced by the prostate gland whose
purpose is to liquefy semen, and normally, only very small levels of PSA are found in serum.
Elevated levels may be found in men with prostate cancer, along with other benign conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, and after digital rectal examination and ejaculation. As a crude measure, PSA may therefore not be very accurate as a
screening measure for prostate cancer. However, it may be used in a better fashion through
calculation of PSA density (which corrects for prostate volume), PSA velocity (the rate of the
rise in PSA is greater in malignancy), age-specific PSA ranges, and the ratio between free
and bound PSA in serum (in general, the percentage of free PSA is lower in cancer). Despite
these modifications, PSA screening for prostate cancer is not currently recommended by the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK.
The current evidence on PSA screening is very controversial. A large European r­ andomized
study found that although PSA screening did significantly reduce mortality from prostate cancer, more than 1000 men would have to be screened and 37 cancers would need
to be detected in order to prevent one death from prostate cancer over 11 years of followup. In contrast, an American randomized trial found that PSA screening did not achieve
a ­reduction in mortality from prostate cancer, though this study was hampered by the fact
that a significant proportion of men in the control (the non-PSA screened arm) did actually
undergo a PSA test at some point during the study period. A recent meta-analysis found that
there was no significant effect of screening on mortality from prostate cancer, although all
trials had substantial methodological limitations.
Currently, the NHS does not recommend routine PSA screening of older men, but PSA
testing is still performed and actually quite popular. However, the focus should be on
informed and shared decision-making for men who wish to undergo PSA screening.
In this case, the GP should explore the above issues with the patient and try and arrive
20

Case 7: Screening for prostate cancer?

at a shared consensus. Given the family history of prostate cancer, it may be prudent for
PSA testing to be p
­ erformed, but only once the patient is fully aware of the pros and cons
of screening.
KEY POINTS

• The purpose of screening is to identify individuals at increased risk of disease so
that they may undergo further testing.

• Criteria for a screening test include the condition being an important health problem and there being an identifiable early stage of disease.

• PSA screening is not currently recommended for regular use in the UK, though
physicians and patients are encouraged to discuss the issue and arrive at an
informed decision.

CASE 8:

A YOUNG WOMAN FOUND UNCONSCIOUS IN BED

History
A 27-year-old woman is brought into the Emergency Department by her husband, who found
her unconscious in bed. The paramedics perform an ABCDE assessment and find her fingerprick glucose to be 1.2 mM. Administration of 50 mL of 20% dextrose revives her. In hospital,
the patient gives a history of awakening that morning with a headache but not being able
to remember anything else. She has no past medical history and family history is positive
for ‘thyroid problems’ in her mother. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol only socially,
though does confess to drinking large amounts of Coca-Cola every day.

Examination
Cardiac, respiratory, abdominal and neurologic examinations are all unremarkable.

Given the history of a hypoglycaemic episode, a supervised fast is performed. At the start
of the fast (8 am), plasma glucose is 5.4 mM, falling to 4.2 mM at noon, and then 2.3 mM
at 4 pm, before reaching a nadir of 1.8 mM at 6 pm. At that time the fast is stopped, and
levels of insulin and C-peptide taken at this point are 70 pM (5–20) and 25 nM (0.2–0.9),
respectively.

Questions
1. What are the causes of the patient’s hypoglycaemic state?
2. Explain the rationale for the investigations performed in this case. Why would the
physician feel confident of a diagnosis at the end of these?
3. What further tests are required at this stage with regards to forming a management
plan for the patient?
4. What are the principles of treatment in this case, and how should the patient be
treated while awaiting her definitive management?
5. What follow-up should the patient receive?

23

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 8
Blood glucose level is determined by the balance between insulin and the counter-regulatory
hormones (glucagon, adrenaline, growth hormone and cortisol), with hypoglycaemia arising
when the balance is shifted too far towards the latter. The clinical features of hypoglycaemia
are divided into either autonomic or neurologic symptoms. This presentation highlights the
neuroglycopaenic symptoms (e.g. blurred vision, amnesia, loss of consciousness) that occur
as a result of deficient supply of glucose to the brain. The responses of glucagon and adrenaline to a low glucose state are responsible for the symptoms of autonomic hyperreactivity,
such as sweating, tremor, nausea, and palpitations.
Symptomatic hypoglycaemia has several causes, which may be broadly classified as either
fasting or non-fasting. Non-fasting hypoglycaemia occurs after a meal; possible causes of
this include (1) gastrectomy or alimentary bypass surgery resulting in rapid gastric emptying, leading to overproduction of insulin, (2) pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia, and (3) occult
diabetes, which may produce late hypoglycaemia after a meal owing to the d
­ eficient
early response of insulin in diabetics, leading to exaggerated delayed release 4–5 hours
afterwards.
The causes of fasting hypoglycaemia include:
1. Hyperinsulinaemic states
a. Insulin reaction or sulphonylurea overdose (the commonest cause)
b. Autoimmune hypoglycaemia
c. Surreptitious use of insulin or sulphonylureas
d. Pancreatic β-cell tumours (typically insulinoma)
2. Non-hyperinsulinaemic states
a. Reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis, which may arise from liver disease or inborn
errors of metabolism
b. Renal insufficiency (the kidney contributes to gluconeogenesis too)
c. Alcohol excess, which increases the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (consuming NAD+) and thereby limits the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, which is a
gluconeogenic substrate
d. Non-pancreatic tumours (e.g. retroperitoneal fibrosarcoma) that release IGF-2,
which can activate the insulin receptor
This patient has fasting hypoglycaemia (a clue is the persistent drinking of Coca-Cola as a
subconscious defence against this!), and the absence of other causes point towards a hyperinsulinaemic state as the cause. If we assume that the patient has not been using insulin or other
antidiabetic agents, the most important diagnosis to exclude is an insulinoma, which is the
commonest cause of spontaneous, fasting hypoglycaemia in a healthy individual.
Insulinomas are benign tumours of pancreatic β-cells, with hypoglycaemia arising from
the excess secretion of insulin. The key investigation for insulinoma is a supervised fast,
the premise of which is to elicit Whipple’s triad, which is required for diagnosis. Whipple’s
triad requires (1) symptoms to be associated with fasting or exercise, (2) confirmation of
­hypoglycaemia during these episodes, and (3) reversal of symptoms on administering
­glucose. In this case, all three criteria are met, and the inappropriately high levels of insulin
at the end of the fast (with a glucose level of 1.8 mM) confirm hyperinsulinism. The high
C-peptide levels confirm an endogenous rather than exogenous cause (C-peptide is the other
product from cleavage of pro-insulin and is released with insulin from β-cells).
24

Case 8: A young woman found unconscious in bed

As the majority of insulinomas are single and benign, the treatment of choice is surgical
resection. Further investigations are needed for tumour localization, including abdominal
ultrasound and CT; endoscopic ultrasound may be useful to identify pancreatic lesions.
If these are not fruitful, selective angiography of pancreatic vessels with calcium stimulation
(to cause vesicle release) and measurement of insulin levels in the hepatic vein may help locate
the tumour anatomically.
While awaiting surgery, options to manage the hypoglycaemia include cornstarch infusion at
night (this releases glucose in a slow, sustained fashion) and diazoxide, a thiazide-type drug
that opens the K ATP channel, leading to efflux of K+ from β-cells, which causes hyperpolarisation and reduced insulin release.
The finding of an insulinoma in a young patient should raise the possibility of an endocrine
syndrome, in particular multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). This is an autosomal
dominant syndrome characterized by tumours in the pancreas, pituitary and parathyroids
(‘3Ps’) caused by germline mutations in the MEN1 gene. While insulinoma is generally not
a presenting feature of MEN1, the family history of ‘thyroid problems’ should serve to raise
notice about its relevance to this patient.
KEY POINTS

• The symptoms of hypoglycaemia arise from neuroglycopenia and autonomic
hyper-reactivity.

• The most common cause of fasting hypoglycaemia in an otherwise healthy person
is an insulinoma.

• The diagnosis of insulinoma is made by fulfilling Whipple’s triad.

should the patient be further evaluated?

27

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 9
The metabolism of bilirubin is summarized in Figure 9.1. In essence, bilirubin is a breakdown
product of haemoglobin and, as it is insoluble, it needs to be conjugated in the liver before it
may be excreted. Some of the conjugated bilirubin is excreted in urine as urobilinogen (which
is colourless) and in faeces as stercobilin (which is brown).
Hyperbilirubinaemia at levels >50 μM is sufficient to cause a yellowish discolouration of
skin and sclerae (i.e. jaundice). The excess levels of bilirubin may either be conjugated or
unconjugated depending on what part of the metabolic pathway is dysfunctional. There are
five main causes of hyperbilirubinaemia: (1) excess production, (2) reduced hepatic uptake,
(3) impaired conjugation, (4) reduced hepatocellular excretion, and (5) impaired bile flow.
1, 2, and 3 produce an unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, whereas 4 and 5 lead to conjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia.
The causes of jaundice are classically threefold:
1. Pre-hepatic. This causes an unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and arises from
increased production of bilirubin (e.g. haemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis).
2. Hepatic. The hyperbilirubinaemia may either be conjugated or unconjugated
depending on which part of the hepatic metabolic pathway is affected. Congenital
causes include Gilbert, Crigler–Najjar, and Dubin–Johnson syndromes, while
acquired causes include viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, drugs (e.g. halothane, paracetamol and methyldopa) and primary biliary
cirrhosis.
3. Post-hepatic. This typically causes a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and arises as a
result of biliary obstruction, causes of which include gallstones, malignancy (pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and ampullary tumours of the duodenum), biliary strictures, pancreatic pseudocysts, and sclerosing cholangitis.
The presence of dark urine in this case indicates a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia arising
from biliary obstruction. This colour is due to conjugated bilirubin, which leaks from hepatocytes or the biliary system when its excretory route is blocked and enters the systemic circulation, with some of it being excreted in urine. The pruritus arises from accumulation of bile
salts in the skin, which again suggests a cholestatic picture.

Case 9: A middle-aged woman with jaundice

The liver function results are also suggestive of a post-hepatic cause, with proportionately
greater elevation of ALP compared to AST or ALT. The latter two are liver-specific enzymes
released from damaged hepatocytes and are therefore raised in hepatocellular causes of
­jaundice. In contrast, ALP activity increases as a result of cholestasis stimulating greater
enzyme ­synthesis. The elevation of INR may be due to vitamin K malabsorption, which is
likely due to an obstruction causing bile salt deficiency (bile salts are needed for the ­absorption
of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K).
A history of painless jaundice and constitutional symptoms with investigations favouring
a post-hepatic picture should raise the suspicion of pancreatic carcinoma (or any other biliary malignancy). Further evaluation would begin with an abdominal ultrasound, which
may identify any pancreatic lesions as well as inform on the degree of biliary dilatation.
Abdominal CT would be required to evaluate the pancreas and look for any metastases;
if any lesions were found, a tissue diagnosis would be needed, most likely obtained by endoscopic ultrasound. It may also be worthwhile to measure tumour markers such as CA19-9
and CEA.
KEY POINTS

• Bilirubin is a breakdown product of haemoglobin and is conjugated before being
excreted by the liver.

• Jaundice occurs from elevated levels of bilirubin in the body, and its causes are
conveniently categorized as pre-hepatic, hepatic or post-hepatic.

• Measurement of liver enzymes helps distinguish between the causes, with a dis-

proportionately elevated ALP suggestive of biliary obstruction and high AST/ALT
indicative of hepatocyte damage.

Case 10: Drug overdose

CASE 10:

DRUG OVERDOSE

History
A 19-year-old student is found by her flatmate on a Monday morning minimally responsive.
She notices a large amount of vomitus by the bedside and several packs of paracetamol tablets
lying on the floor. At hospital, her friend informs the doctors that she last saw the patient on
Saturday night after a big argument had taken place between the patient and her boyfriend.
The patient confesses to taking numerous paracetamol tablets with alcohol throughout the
day on Sunday, but is unable to recollect the precise number though she informs the doctor
that her last tablet was taken at 6 pm on the previous evening.

Examination
The patient is haemodynamically stable (T 37, HR 90, BP 110/65, O2 sat 97% on air).
Abdominal examination reveals diffuse abdominal tenderness, most prominent in the right
upper quadrant.

Questions
1. What investigations are necessary for this patient?
2. What is the mechanism of paracetamol toxicity?
3. How should the patient be treated? Would management be affected if the patient
were unable to remember when she last took the tablets?

31

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 10
Paracetamol is the most common drug taken in overdose in the UK, with around 70,000
cases and 100–200 deaths each year. It is one of the leading causes of acute liver failure.
The key aspects of dealing with a suspected paracetamol overdose are a thorough history,
complete physical examination and prompt investigations. The aim of the history is to determine the quantity and chronology of the tablets taken as well as to ascertain whether the
patient has risk factors for hepatotoxicity (e.g. background liver disease, malnourishment,
excess a­ lcohol consumption, enzyme-inducing medication). Physical examination is directed
mainly at evaluating for possible liver disease, while the key investigations that need to be
performed are (1) urinalysis (for ketones), (2) timed serum paracetamol level, (3) liver function, (4) clotting screen (a marker of synthetic liver function), and (5) renal function.
The clinical features of paracetamol overdose are dependent on time. In the first 24 hours,
patients may complain of nausea or vomiting, while serum transaminases may start to rise.
One to two days post-overdose, abdominal signs and symptoms increase, with a continued
rise in transaminases and possible evidence of liver dysfunction (coagulopathy). After this
time, untreated patients may develop acute liver failure, with ensuing coagulopathy, encephalopathy and renal failure.
The recommended dosing of paracetamol is a maximum dose of 4 g a day for adults.
Normally, the drug is metabolized by cytochrome P4502E1 to form a reactive metabolite,
N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which can be hepatotoxic. However, NAPQI
is detoxified by glutathione and hence, when there are sufficient amounts of the latter, the
liver is not damaged. Overdoses of the drug deplete glutathione stores, and hepatic damage
results. Glutathione stores also depend on nutritional status, which is why it is important to
assess for background risk of liver damage.
The key investigation for paracetamol overdose is measurement of paracetamol concentration
in the blood 4–16 hours post-dose. Levels taken before 4 hours are inaccurate due to incomplete absorption, while those taken after 16 hours may be falsely high due to the liver injury
that may have occurred. If levels are higher than the treatment threshold, the patient requires
treatment with three sequential intravenous infusions of acetylcysteine, which can replenish
glutathione stores. Additionally, all suspected paracetamol overdose patients require fluid
replacement. If paracetamol has been taken in the past hour, activated charcoal may be of
use in limiting drug absorption. In cases where the timing of the paracetamol dose(s) are
unknown, treatment with acetylcysteine should be started immediately in any patient who is
at potential risk. If risk assessment is uncertain, the latest guidelines allow for treatment with
acetylcysteine irrespective of the plasma paracetamol level.
KEY POINTS

• The most common drug taken in overdose in the UK is paracetamol.
• The mechanism of paracetamol toxicity is via depletion of glutathione stores,
which helps detoxify NAPQI, a metabolite of the drug.

• Paracetamol levels need to be measured between 4 and 16 hours after the last
dose in order to decide whether treatment is required.

CASE 11:

FATIGUE, WEAKNESS AND CONSTIPATION

History
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP with several non-specific complaints. She has been
suffering from generalized fatigue for the past couple of months, as well as muscle weakness.
She complains of reduced frequency of bowel opening and 1.5 kg of weight loss over the past
few months. She has a past history of depression, hypertension and kidney stones.

Examination
Physical examination of her cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic systems is
­u n­remarkable. Abdominal examination reveals mild generalized tenderness and possible
­faecal loading. The neck is supple and non-tender, and there is no lymphadenopathy.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 11
Hypercalcaemia is the only abnormality in the blood tests, and is frequently seen in primary
care. It typically presents in a chronic setting and the clinical features may be remembered
via the ‘renal stones, skeletal bones, abdominal moans, psychic groans’ mnemonic.
There are several possible causes of hypercalcaemia:
• Hyperparathyroidism, which may be primary (e.g. parathyroid adenoma), secondary (from renal failure leading to hyperphosphataemia and stimulation of parathyroid hormone [PTH] secretion), or tertiary (autonomous parathyroid activity
arising from secondary hyperparathyroidism)
• Malignancy-associated, which may be either humorally mediated (e.g. release of
PTHrP from squamous cell carcinomas) or osteolytic (e.g. multiple myeloma and
bone metastases)
• Vitamin D-related (granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, vitamin D excess)
• Drug-induced (e.g. thiazide diuretics)
• Endocrine disorders, including thyrotoxicosis
• Genetic disorders (e.g. familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia, FHH)
Of these, the first two are by far the commonest causes, accounting for up to 90% of cases,
and therefore require the closest attention when evaluating the patient.
Investigations to elucidate the underlying cause should be preceded by a careful history
(including medications) and examination, with emphasis on examination of the neck (to
assess the parathyroid glands) and searching for a possible tumour (e.g. chest and breast
examination). A full blood count is required to look for possible evidence of chronic disease,
renal function is needed to identify possible secondary hyperparathyroidism, and phosphate
levels may be useful.
A key investigation is the measurement of serum PTH, with suppressed PTH levels indicating feedback inhibition from high calcium levels arising from an extra-parathyroid source
(a likely malignancy). In this situation, investigation for malignancy (e.g. chest radiographs,
mammogram, and serum and urine electrophoresis for myeloma) would be warranted. High
PTH levels would indicate primary (or tertiary) hyperparathyroidism, which may be confirmed with measurement of 24-hour urinary calcium. If the above work-up is unable to
identify either malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism, attention should be diverted
towards the less common causes of hypercalcaemia, including measurement of vitamin D
levels and serum ACE levels (for sarcoidosis).
Primary hyperparathyroidism is the commonest cause of hypercalcaemia and typically
affects older people, particularly women. The classic ‘stones, bones, moans and groans’ presentation is quite rare, with most individuals presenting with various, seemingly non-specific
symptoms such as nephrolithiasis, weakness and mental status changes. Management of this
condition is conservative (observation), medical (some evidence supports the use of bisphosphonates and cinacalcet, which inhibits PTH release), or surgical (via parathyroidectomy).
A parathyroidectomy is recommended only for symptomatic patients, or for asymptomatic
individuals who are young (<50 yrs), have renal failure (eGFR <60), have reduced bone density (T score < –2.5, or previous fragility fracture), or whose serum calcium is 0.25 mM above
the upper limit of normal.

34

Case 11: Fatigue, weakness and constipation

KEY POINTS

• Hypercalcaemia usually presents in a vague fashion with several, seemingly
­unrelated complaints such as fatigue, constipation and polyuria.

• The two commonest causes are hyperparathyroidism and malignancy-related.
Measurement of PTH helps distinguish between these.

Case 12: Excessive hair growth and infertility

CASE 12:

EXCESSIVE HAIR GROWTH AND INFERTILITY

History
A 22-year-old woman presents to her GP because she is embarrassed by ‘excessive hair growth’
on her upper lip, lower abdomen and thighs. She has waxed her legs and body and shaved her
upper lips weekly throughout her teenage years. On direct questioning, she confesses to her
periods being irregular since menarche and that she is having difficulty conceiving despite
regular unprotected sexual intercourse with her partner for the past year. Her family history
is significant for diabetes and hypertension in her mother and maternal grandfather.

Examination
Physical examination reveals a mildly obese woman (body mass index [BMI] 31) with
­moderate facial acne and confirms hirsuitism (Ferriman–Gallwey score 15). Examination
of the genitalia is unremarkable, with a patent outflow tract and no clitoromegaly. Bimanual
examination reveals a mobile anteverted uterus.
INVESTIGATIONS
FBC, U+E: normal
Urine β-hCG: negative

Questions
1. Suggest a differential diagnosis for the cause of this woman’s hirsuitism.
2. Based on the clinical picture, what is the most likely diagnosis and why? What do
you know about the aetiology of this condition?
3. What further investigations would be useful to confirm the likely diagnosis?
4. What are the management options in treating this woman’s symptoms and overall
condition?
5. Are there longer-term health problems that need to be considered in this patient?

37

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 12
Medically, hirsuitism refers to excessive terminal hair growth in a male pattern in women.
Up to 5% of women of reproductive age are hirsuite, according to the Ferriman–Gallwey
scale (which scores hair growth in the most androgen-dependent parts of the body, with a
score >7 defined as hirsuite). As sexual hair growth is entirely androgen-dependent, androgen levels and the sensitivity of hair follicles to androgens are the primary factors leading
to hirsuitism. However, women with milder hirsuitism may not show elevated androgen
levels and have what is known as idiopathic hirsuitism, which accounts for around 50% of
cases. The remainder of cases are associated with hyperandrogenism, the causes of which are
(1) ­polycystic ovarian syndrome, (2) adrenogenital syndromes (e.g. nonclassic congenital
adrenal hyperplasia), (3) androgen-secreting tumours, (4) other causes of hormone over-­
production, such as Cushing’s syndrome, and (5) drug-induced.
In this woman, the main presenting complaints of hirsuitism and difficulty conceiving,
with probable anovulation, are consistent with a diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome
(PCOS). PCOS affects up to 10% of women of reproductive age, and is the underlying factor
in around 15–20% of infertility cases. A diagnosis of PCOS, according to the 2003 Rotterdam
PCOS Consensus Group, can be made with two of the following three findings: (1) clinical or
biochemical evidence of androgen excess, (2) oligo- or anovulation, and (3) polycystic ovaries
on ultrasound. The clinical findings in this case are sufficient to meet the first two of these,
allowing a putative diagnosis of PCOS to be made.
While the exact pathophysiology of PCOS is unclear, one theory suggests that increased
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsing leads to increased luteinising hormone
(LH) pulsing, stimulating increased production of androgens by theca cells in the ovary.
There is also evidence that women with PCOS have elevated levels of insulin, which is known
to act synergistically with LH to enhance androgen production by theca cells. Further, insulin inhibits synthesis of sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) by the liver, thereby increasing the proportion of free testosterone in the blood. These effects of insulin account for the
hyperandrogenaemia in PCOS, which disrupts the normal follicular d
­ evelopment process,
leading to anovulation.
Before a diagnosis of PCOS can confidently be made, other conditions that produce hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles need to be excluded. Further investigations that
may be performed to look for other causes include:
• Thyroid function (hypothyroidism)
• Serum prolactin (hyperprolactinaemia)
• 24-hr urinary cortisol (Cushing’s syndrome)
• Morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels (elevated in nonclassic congenital adrenal
hyperplasia)
• Oral glucose tolerance test and growth hormone suppression (acromegaly)
• Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol (high and low/normal, respectively, in premature ovarian failure)
Biochemical investigations may show increased testosterone levels, reduced SHBG, increased
LH and a high LH:FSH ratio. An ovarian ultrasound should be performed to visualize
the ovaries.
Management of PCOS is essentially symptomatic. Hirsuitism and acne are managed by
agents designed to inhibit hyperandrogenism, such as the combined oral contraceptive pill,
38

Case 12: Excessive hair growth and infertility

anti-androgens (such as cyproterone acetate or spironolactone), and eflornithine ­hydrochloride,
as well as laser or electrolysis for hair removal. The presence of chronic anovulation carries a
higher risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, and therefore requires treatment (typically with the contraceptive pill or cyclical progestagens). Ovulation may be induced with the
use of clomiphene (an oestrogen receptor antagonist at the hypothalamus).
PCOS also carries a significant risk for development of metabolic and cardiovascular disease,
including obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes, and accelerated atherosclerosis.
The likely pathophysiology behind these is insulin resistance, since women with PCOS are
usually hyperinsulinaemic. These longer-term complications require similar management to
type 2 diabetes, with weight reduction and certain anti-diabetic agents (metformin and the
thiazolidinediones) forming the mainstay of treatment.
KEY POINTS

• Hirsuitism refers to the excessive growth of hair (in a male pattern) in women.
• It may arise from elevated androgen levels or be idiopathic.
• Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a clinical diagnosis that often presents with hirsuitism and oligo- or amenorrhoea.

• The mechanism of hyperandrogenism in PCOS is unclear but may relate to
increased GnRH and LH pulsing.

CASE 13:

FATIGUE AND IRREGULAR PERIODS

History
A 50-year-old female pilot undergoes a medical screening examination prior to joining a
new airline. She has been generally fit and well over the past few months. She reports some
tiredness, but “nothing that a good holiday would not solve”. She has a past history of a ductal
carcinoma of the breast, which was excised and has completed ten-year follow-up without
any problems. Her periods are becoming increasingly irregular and she has noticed a few hot
flushes recently.

Examination
Physical examination reveals a well-looking, slightly overweight woman. There is slight

3. Is any treatment required for this patient?

41

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 13
A goitre refers to an enlarged thyroid gland and is one of the commonest causes of a mass in the
muscular triangle of the neck. The basic pathophysiology of a goitre is stimulation of thyroid
follicular cells by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Therefore, causes of goitre include any
cause of hypothyroidism (e.g. iodine deficiency, thyroiditis, TSH-secreting pituitary tumours,
thyroid dyshormogenesis and thyroid hormone resistance). Autoantibodies stimulating the
TSH receptor also produce a goitre, as seen in Graves’ disease. Certain substances (e.g. amiodarone, cassava) can interfere with iodine uptake by the thyroid and can therefore cause increased
TSH secretion and subsequent goitre. Additional causes of thyroid enlargement include
tumours (benign adenomas or malignant carcinomas), infection and granulomatous diseases.
This woman’s blood results are normal except for thyroid function. TSH is elevated at twice
the upper limit of normal, but free T4 levels are within the normal range. These results could
be consistent with two possibilities:
1. Subclinical or compensated hypothyroidism
2. Treated hyperthyroidism
The absence of any history of thyroid disease makes subclinical hypothyroidism the likeliest diagnosis. This indicates some degree of thyroid failure that is compensated for, at least
partly, by a rise in TSH levels, which is sufficient to keep thyroxine levels in the normal range.
There are typically only non-specific or very mild symptoms in this condition.
Subclinical hypothyroidism is frequently associated with anti-thyroid antibodies (e.g. antiTPO), which is a marker of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune thyroid disease that
affects up to 2% of the population. Other causes of subclinical hypothyroidism include partial thyroidectomy, radioiodide treatment, external radiotherapy to the neck, infiltrative disorders affecting the thyroid gland (e.g. amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) and inadequate thyroxine
replacement for hypothyroidism. Given the demographics of the patient and positivity to
anti-TPO, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.
Subclinical hypothyroidism may progress to overt thyroid failure, but also has other physiologic effects, including impairment of cardiac function and increasing LDL cholesterol levels,
both of which are responsible for the higher cardiovascular risk seen in patients.
Treatment with thyroxine replacement for subclinical hypothyroidism is controversial.
Various factors, including age and background cardiovascular risk status, symptomatology (e.g. goitre), antibody positivity and TSH levels need to be considered before making a
decision on whether to commence treatment. In this case, antibody positivity suggests an
autoimmune thyroid disease that will likely progress to overt hypothyroidism. Given the
additional finding of a goitre, it would probably be prudent to begin thyroxine replacement.
KEY POINTS

• A thyroid goitre arises through excess stimulation of thyroid follicular cells by TSH.
• Subclinical hypothyroidism is frequently encountered and may progress to overt
•

42

thyroid failure particularly if autoantibodies are positive, indicating the likelihood
of Hashimoto thyroiditis.
There is no consensus on whether subclinical hypothyroidism should always be
treated, though it is worth remembering that the condition carries an increased
cardiovascular risk.

Case 14: Stiff and painful hands

CASE 14:

STIFF AND PAINFUL HANDS

History
A 28-year-old legal assistant presents to her GP after being bothered by stiffness in the joints
of both of her hands for the past few weeks. The stiffness is most prominent on awakening
and lasts approximately an hour before getting better through the day. She denies any other
musculoskeletal problems or any other joints being affected. Her only medical history is mild
asthma. Her family history is positive for type 1 diabetes in her brother.

Examination
Physical examination reveals a well-looking, slim woman. Her metacarpophalangeal joints
are slightly swollen bilaterally and mildly tender, and there is some pain on palpation over a
few of the interphalangeal joints in both hands. Metacarpal squeeze test is positive bilaterally.

Questions
1. Based on the history and examination findings, suggest a differential diagnosis.
Which diagnosis is most likely and why?
2. What further investigations are required, and which tests are most predictive for the
likely diagnosis?
3. Summarize the pathophysiology of the underlying diagnosis. What extra-articular
complications may arise with this condition?

43

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 14
The clinical picture in this case is very suggestive of an inflammatory arthropathy with the
findings of joint swelling, morning stiffness and evidence of synovitis. The key differential
diagnoses therefore include:
• Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
• Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (e.g. psoriatic arthritis, arthritis associated
with inflammatory bowel disease)
• Post-viral or post-infectious arthropathy
• Connective tissue diseases (such as lupus and scleroderma)
• Crystal arthropathy (gout and pseudogout)
• Degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis)
The most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis, which is the commonest inflammatory
arthropathy and typically affects adults between the ages of 30 and 50. This is because the
history of bilateral joint problems, mainly in the small joints of the hand, as well as morning
stiffness lasting greater than one hour, is very suggestive of an inflammatory, rather than
a degenerative process (in the latter, symptoms tend to get worse throughout the day and
stiffness generally lasts less than an hour). Similarly, the absence of any background medical
history or other symptoms makes seronegative arthritis, postviral arthritis and connective
tissue disease unlikely.
The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, according to the American College of Rheumatology,
requires four of the following to be present (the first four for at least 6 weeks):
• Morning stiffness lasting >1 hour
• Symmetric arthritis
• Arthritis of three or more joint areas
• Hand joint involvement
• Rheumatoid nodules
• Rheumatoid factor seropositivity
• Typical radiographic features (e.g. erosions, juxta-articular osteopenia)
This patient meets three criteria from history and examination alone, and referral to a rheumatology specialist would be warranted. Further investigations would include basic blood
tests (full blood count – possible anaemia of chronic disease, renal and hepatic function –
which may guide medication choice) and tests of inflammatory activity. The latter include
CRP and ESR along with more specific tests for RA, namely rheumatoid factor (RF) and
anti-CCP antibodies. Anti-CCP has a similar sensitivity (65–85%) but much higher specificity (>95% vs. 80%) for RA in patients with suspected rheumatic disease than RF, and antiCCP positivity is also associated with a more severe clinical course. Radiographs of the hand
would also be useful to look for evidence of joint damage.
The pathophysiology of RA is incompletely understood and the cause remains unknown. It is
an autoimmune disease triggered by the exposure of a genetically susceptible individual to an
as-yet unidentified antigen. Interplay of genetic (e.g. human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DR4
allele) and environmental (e.g. smoking, infection) factors lead to altered post-­transcriptional
regulation of proteins and citrullination of self-proteins. Loss of tolerance to these new epitopes leads to the formation of autoantibodies (e.g. anti-CCP) and the stimulation of B- and
CD4 T-cell responses, which act against unknown target antigens in joints and mediate joint
injury via production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1. These stimulate
44

Case 14: Stiff and painful hands

proliferation of synovial cells and the production of matrix metalloproteinases, which assist
in destruction of articular cartilage, and the inflammatory-rich hyperplastic synovium
adheres and grows over the articular surfaces forming pannus.
RA is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, resulting from endothelial activation by inflammatory cytokines. This generalized inflammatory response may
also account for the other systemic manifests of RA, involving the lungs (fibrosis), bones
(osteoporosis) and brain (reduced cognition), as well as a higher risk of lymphoma.
KEY POINTS

• Morning stiffness is a common rheumatologic symptom, and the key to distin•
•

guishing whether it is inflammatory or degenerative in origin is seeing whether it
gets better or worse through the day.
Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the small joints of the hands bilaterally, and
is associated with positivity for anti-CCP antibodies.
It is believed to arise from the immune system reacting against as-yet unidentified antigens, provoking the formation of an inflammatory pannus over articular
surfaces.

CASE 15:

ABDOMINAL PAIN, NAUSEA AND VOMITING

History
A 15-year-old boy is brought into the Emergency Department after complaining of a­ bdominal
pain through the day. He has been feeling generally unwell for the past couple of days but is
much worse today with a decline in his level of alertness. He is drowsy but still communicates
in sentences, and complains of a productive cough. He has had three episodes of non-bilious,
non-bloody vomiting over the past few hours, and gives a vague history of drinking more
water in the past few weeks. His past medical history is significant for asthma.

Examination
Physical examination reveals an ill-looking boy with pulse of 100, blood pressure 110/70
mmHg, respiratory rate 24 per minute and shallow, O2 saturation of 95% on air, temperature 35.8°C, and GCS 14 (E4V4M6). Auscultation of the chest is positive for crackles at the
right mid and lower zones. Abdominal palpation reveals a diffusely tender abdomen, but no
guarding or rebound tenderness. No focal neurology is demonstrable.

4. What are the principles of managing this patient in the short-term?
47

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 15
The arterial blood gas is consistent with a partly compensated metabolic acidosis. The low pH
and the low bicarbonate levels confirm that the cause of the acidosis is metabolic; since pCO2
is slightly low, there is some degree of respiratory compensation in an effort to blow off H+ as
CO2. This correlates with the clinical finding of a high respiratory rate and shallow breathing
(Kussmaul breathing).
When investigating a metabolic acidosis, it is useful to determine the anion gap ([Na+] +
[K+] – [Cl−] – [HCO3−]), as the causes of a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis are distinct from
those of a raised anion gap acidosis. Here, the anion gap is 21, which is elevated, indicating
that an unmeasured anion is present in increased quantities (e.g. lactate, β-hydroxybutyrate).
The causes of a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap include:
• Lactic acidosis (e.g. tissue hypoxia, drugs such as metformin and ethanol)
• Ketoacidosis (e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis)
• Exogenous acids (e.g. salicylate overdose)
• Accumulation of organic acids (e.g. inherited organic acidoses)
• Renal failure (‘uraemic acidosis’)
Here, the likeliest cause is diabetic ketoacidosis, given the symptoms of abdominal pain and
vomiting on a background of feeling generally unwell with polyuria. The finding of Kussmaul
breathing is also characteristic. Additionally, blood tests confirm hyperglycaemia, with the
presence of both glucose and ketones in urine.
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a medical emergency, accounting for up to 10% of hospital
admissions for children with diabetes. It can often be the first manifestation of a previously
undiagnosed case of type 1 diabetes, and comprises three key elements: (1) marked hyperglycaemia, (2) ketosis, and (3) acidosis. It results from acute insulin deficiency, which leads
to the following:
• Rapid mobilisation of energy from muscle and fat stores, with conversion of amino
acids to glucose, and fatty acids to ketones
• The low insulin:glucagon ratio and higher levels of catecholamines and cortisol promoting hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
• Reduced peripheral utilisation of glucose and ketones, due to lack of insulin, thereby
leading to hyperglycaemia and ketosis
• Hyperglycaemia provoking an osmotic diuresis, leading to depletion of intravascular volume, with reduction in renal blood flow hampering the ability of the kidneys
to excrete glucose, and resultant hyperosmolality, which may lead to CNS depression and coma
The precipitating factor here is probably a chest infection. The stress response to infection
invokes a counter-regulatory hormone drive, with a rise in the glucagon:insulin ratio, leading
to the sequence of events described above.
The key aspects of managing DKA are fourfold:
• Immediate resuscitation
• Fluid and electrolyte replacement
• Insulin replacement
• Treatment of precipitating causes

48

Case 15: Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting

Emergency management should follow an ABCDE approach and be combined with fluid
resuscitation. At least 2 L of normal saline are required in adult patients in the first 2–3
hours to reduce the hyperosmolar state, clear ketones and restore extracellular fluid volume.
The overall fluid deficit in an average adult may be up to 7 L. As soon as fluid resuscitation
is under way, insulin replacement by way of a fixed-rate insulin infusion (0.1 units/kg) is
required. The aim should be to reduce blood ketone concentrations by at least 0.5 mM per
hour and capillary blood glucose by 3 mM per hour, and to raise venous bicarbonate by 3 mM
per hour. Once blood glucose levels fall below 14 mM, 10% glucose infusion is recommended
to avoid hypoglycaemia, with continuation of the insulin infusion to suppress ketogenesis.
The electrolyte deficiencies in DKA are sodium, potassium, chloride and phosphate.
Potassium losses may be particularly high (though serum levels may be artificially high from
the potassium flux into the extracellular space as a result of acidosis), and generally 40 mmol
of K+ is given with each bag of normal saline. In addition to these resuscitative measures,
treatment should be directed at the precipitating cause (e.g. antibiotics for chest infection)
and the diabetic specialist team should be involved in management, particularly as they will
be needed to plan long-term treatment.
KEY POINTS

• Calculation of the anion gap helps distinguish between the causes of a metabolic
acidosis.

• DKA is a common cause of a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis and fundamentally results from acute insulin deficiency.

• Management of DKA is based on replacing the deficient insulin, fluid and electrolytes and treating the provoking cause.

of this condition?
3. How should this woman be managed for the likely underlying condition? What
other complications need to be monitored for?

51

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 16
Immunodeficiency should be suspected in patients with severe, persistent, recurrent or
‘unusual’ infections; in this case, the history of recurrent sinopulmonary infections is suspicious, while the presence of chronic diarrhoea should also raise the suspicion of an infectious
gastroenteritis (e.g. giardiasis).
Immunodeficiency may be either primary (an intrinsic immune system defect) or secondary to an underlying condition. Important secondary causes of immunodeficiency to consider are infections (e.g. HIV), malnutrition, malignancy (particularly haematologic), drugs
(immunosuppressants, immunomodulators), protein-losing states (e.g. nephrotic syndrome,
protein-losing enteropathy) and metabolic disease (e.g. diabetes and severe liver disease).
Initial work-up of a suspected immunodeficiency involves taking a pertinent history and
performing a complete examination. Investigations should include a full blood count, liver
and renal function tests, urinalysis (for proteinuria), HIV status, measurement of total serum
proteins and relevant imaging for sinusitis and chest infections. Measurement of serum
immunoglobulins is crucial to look for antibody deficiencies.
Here, serum immunoglobulin levels show low levels of IgG and IgA with normal IgM levels.
If we rule out secondary causes, the key causes of primary immunodeficiency to consider are
(1) common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), (2) X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA),
(3) selective Ig subclass deficiency, and (4) hyper-IgM syndrome. All cause antibody deficiency, but XLA presents in the neonatal period, while levels of IgM are greatly increased in
the hyper-IgM syndrome. Selective Ig deficiency may be a possibility here, but is less likely
given that two different immunoglobulins are deficient. Hence, the most likely diagnosis,
partly by exclusion and partly because of the age of the patient, is CVID.
CVID, the commonest symptomatic primary immunodeficiency, typically presents in late childhood with recurrent sinopulmonary and bacterial infections as well as gastrointestinal complications. Capsulated bacteria (H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae) account for the bulk of respiratory
infections, while Giardia is more frequent given the deficiency in mucosal antibody defences.
CVID is usually sporadic and though the molecular basis of the disease is incompletely
understood, the defect lies in the inability of B-cells in blood and lymphoid tissue (present in
normal numbers) to differentiate into plasma cells. It is unclear whether this is an intrinsic
B-cell problem or whether the fault lies with a defective ability of T-cells in activating B-cells.
The mainstay of CVID management is immunoglobulin replacement and prompt treatment
of infections. Further, attention should be paid to potential complications of CVID, which
include an increased risk of autoimmune disease (e.g. haemolytic anaemia), lung disease
(e.g. bronchiectasis, fibrosis), granulomatous disease (usually affecting the lung), and cancer
­(particularly lymphoid malignancy).
KEY POINTS

• Suspect an immunodeficiency if there is evidence of severe, persistent, recurrent
or unusual infections.

• Immunodeficiency may be either primary or secondary to an underlying condition
such as HIV.

• CVID is the commonest symptomatic primary immunodeficiency and is due to a
defect in differentiation of B-cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 17
The arterial blood gas shows a metabolic acidosis, given the low pH and reduced bicarbonate
levels. When confronted with any metabolic acidosis, the anion gap ([Na+] + [K+] – [Cl−] –
[HCO3−]) should be calculated as this helps in determining the cause. Normally, the anion
gap is between 10 and 18 mM, and in this case it is normal (11 mM). A normal anion gap metabolic acidosis indicates that either H+ is being retained or that HCO3− is being lost, and the
HCO3− that is lost (or used up to maintain electroneutrality via buffering of H+) is replaced by
Cl−. Hence, it is often termed a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis.
Causes of a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis include:
• Increased losses of HCO3− from the gut (e.g. diarrhoea, via stomas)
• Increased losses of HCO3− from the kidney (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
therapy, proximal or type 2 renal tubular acidosis, tubular damage from drugs or
paraproteins)
• Reduced renal excretion of H+ (e.g. distal or type 1 renal tubular acidosis, and type
4 renal tubular acidosis)
• Increased production of HCl (e.g. ingestion of ammonium chloride)
In this patient, the history rules out several of the above, leaving the source of the acidosis to
be either higher renal HCO3− losses or reduced renal H+ excretion, with the likeliest underlying cause therefore being renal tubular acidosis. The best way to confirm this would be to
calculate the urinary anion gap ([Na+]urine + [K+]urine – [Cl−]urine), which would be positive in
renal tubular acidosis and negative in other causes. In the latter, the higher H+ in the tubular
fluid that occurs with a metabolic acidosis is excreted as NH4Cl, thereby increasing Cl− in
urine, and creating a negative urinary anion gap. In renal tubular acidosis, where acidification of urine is impaired, this does not occur, thus giving rise to a positive urinary anion gap.
Renal tubular acidosis comprises a group of tubular disorders that arise from impaired reabsorption of HCO3− or impaired excretion of H+ in urine. There are three main types: (1) distal
(type 1), where there is impaired H+ excretion, (2) proximal (type 2), where there is ­failure of
HCO3− reabsorption, and (3) hyperkalemic (type 4), which is caused by aldosterone deficiency
or resistance. Here, the likely diagnosis is type 1 renal tubular acidosis, which is associated
with nephrolithiasis, as there is often hypocitraturia, which is a risk factor for stone formation. This is a result of the acidosis causing increased citrate reabsorption in the proximal
tubule. The condition is often secondary to an underlying factor (e.g. autoimmune disease,
sickle cell anaemia, and drugs such as lithium), and the mainstay of treatment is oral potassium and bicarbonate replacement. These are needed to balance H+ production, and lifelong
treatment is usually needed.
KEY POINTS

• A normal anion gap metabolic acidosis indicates that either H+ is being retained
or that HCO3− is being lost.

• Renal tubular acidosis is one cause of a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis.
• It may present with recurrent kidney stones, as it causes hypocitraturia.

CASE 18:

A ROUTINE ‘HEALTH CHECK’ FOR A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN

History
A 55-year-old man presents to his GP for his annual check-up. He has a history of hypertension, which is controlled by amlodipine, and hyperlipidaemia, for which he takes a statin.
He does not complain of any particular symptoms but notes that he has been going to the
toilet to pass urine more frequently. He wonders whether this may be an early sign of diabetes
as both his brothers have recently been diagnosed with the same. He has a family history of
cardiovascular disease, with both his parents having suffered a heart attack prior to reaching
70 years of age. He recently stopped smoking but has a 35 pack-year history.

Examination
BMI is 28. Cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal and neurologic examinations are
­u nremarkable. Digital rectal examination reveals a small and benign-feeling prostate.

55

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 18
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is predominantly a disease of the older population, and accounts for
90% of cases of diabetes. It may be diagnosed through three tests: (1) fasting glucose levels,
(2) glucose tolerance test, and (3) glycated haemoglobin levels. Additionally, in this case, testing the urine for glucose might also be useful, though it must be remembered that around
10% of cases of glycosuria are not caused by hyperglycaemia.
Fasting glucose levels were the easiest way in which to test for diabetes until glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) assays became available. The World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria
for diabetes require a fasting glucose level of ≥7 mM, since that is the level above which the
microvascular complications of diabetes become detectable. An oral glucose tolerance test
(measuring plasma glucose 2 hours after a standardized glucose load, with levels ≥11.1 mM
being diagnostic of diabetes) is a more sensitive marker of glucose dysregulation but is more
expensive and less reproducible. More recently, the use of HbA1C levels have been used in
diagnosing type 2 diabetes. HbA1C measures the nonenzymatic glycation of amino acids on
the haemoglobin molecule and reflects the glycaemic state over the prior 8–12 weeks. Normal
levels are between 4 and 6%, with the WHO recognising a threshold of 6.5% as the cut-off
point for diagnosing type 2 diabetes.
The two main metabolic defects that underlie type 2 diabetes are insulin resistance and subsequent pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. The former is caused by both quantitative and qualitative changes in insulin signalling, such as reduced receptor tyrosine kinase activity, which
are strongly linked to obesity (‘lipotoxicity’). Initially, insulin resistance is compensated for
by pancreatic β-cell hypersecretion of insulin; however, there is eventual decompensation,
the mechanisms of which remain unclear, but are likely linked to lipotoxicity and ‘glucotoxicity’. It is also important to be aware of the genetic link in type 2 diabetes, which is stronger
than in type 1 diabetes.
Life expectancy in diabetics is reduced by 5–10 years compared to non-diabetics. The major
causes of excess mortality are cardiovascular disease, renal problems and infection. Hence,
the complications of diabetes are just as important to monitor as glycaemic control itself.
Broadly speaking, these complications may be categorized as either microvascular (disease
of small blood vessels) or macrovascular (large-vessel disease). Microvascular complications
include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, while the predominant macrovascular
complications are cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease.
The principal mechanism underlying macrovascular complications is accelerated atherosclerosis of large vessels, leading to a higher risk of thrombosis and occlusion, while the
basic pathophysiology underlying microangiopathy is thickening of capillary basement
membranes in the retina, kidneys and vaso nervorum. In the kidney, these thickened capillaries are more leaky than normal to plasma proteins, giving rise to microalbuminuria.
Similarly, in the eyes, microangiopathy gives rise to non-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy. Indeed, diabetes is the commonest cause of blindness in individuals under 65 years
of age.
Given the burden of disease that diabetes imposes, its management is multi-faceted.
Patient education and dietary measures form the basis of conservative management, particularly in diabetics whose β-cells are able to compensate. Oral anti-diabetic agents that
aim to either stimulate insulin secretion (e.g. sulphonylureas) or increase insulin sensitivity (e.g. metformin) may be required to optimize glycaemic control, and the last resort
56

Case 18: A routine ‘health check’ for a 55-year-old man

is insulin. However, it is important to remember that diabetes management is not just about
controlling sugar levels, but that hypertension and hyperlipidaemia need to be aggressively managed too. Additionally, patients with nephropathy require ACE-inhibitors or
­a ngiotensin-receptor-antagonist therapy, and regular diabetic eye screening is needed to
monitor for retinopathy.
KEY POINTS

• Type 2 diabetes is the commonest form of diabetes, and may be diagnosed via
•
•

measurement of fasting glucose levels, an oral glucose tolerance test, or via HbA1C
levels.
The pathophysiology underlying the disease stems from insulin resistance and
eventual pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and decompensation.
Management of type 2 diabetes involves not only aggressive glycaemic control but
also minimizing cardiovascular risk factors and possible renal and retinal disease.

History
A 30-year-old man undergoing his second cycle of Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine,
dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy for bulky stage II Hodgkin’s lymphoma is brought into
hospital by his wife after collapsing at home. His wife says that the patient has been vomiting

4. What are the main aspects in managing this patient in the acute setting?

59

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 19
This patient has acute renal failure, which may be defined as the rapid loss of renal function
with retention of urea, creatinine and other metabolic products and usually characterized by
oliguria. His urea and creatinine levels are around 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, while
his urine output (prior to fluid resuscitation) of 20 mL/hr is significantly less than expected
of an adult male. Classically, the causes of acute renal failure are categorized as:
• Pre-renal, which arises from hypovolaemia leading to inadequate renal blood flow
(haemorrhage, sepsis, heart failure, diarrhoea, and use of diuretics)
• Intrinsic renal disease, which may affect the glomeruli (e.g. various glomerulo­
nephritides), tubules and interstitium (e.g. drugs such as NSAIDs and aminoglycosides, contrast media, and intra-renal obstruction arising from renal calculi or the
cast nephropathy in multiple myeloma), or the blood vessels (e.g. vasculitis, hypertension, diabetes)
• Post-renal obstruction, which leads to renal failure when both outflow tracts are
obstructed or when one is obstructed in patients with a single kidney (e.g. bladder
outflow obstruction, ureteric calculi, intratubular crystal nephropathy and urothelial neoplasms)
Measurement of urine composition and using ratios of serum urea:creatinine may help
­differentiate between the above when the history is not especially suggestive, as shown below.

Here, renal failure is accompanied by hyperkalemia, hypocalcaemia and hyper­
phosphataemia. These are suggestive of tumour lysis syndrome as the underlying aetiology
for the renal failure, with hypovolaemia as a contributory factor too. Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is classified as either laboratory TLS or clinical TLS. Laboratory TLS requires
the presence of two or more metabolic abnormalities (hyperuricaemia, hyperkalemia,
hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia) occurring 3 days prior to or up to 7 days after the
start of anti-cancer therapy, whereas clinical TLS is present when laboratory TLS is accompanied by the clinical findings of raised serum creatinine, seizures, arrhythmia or death.
Our patient meets the criteria for both.
TLS is most frequently seen with chemotherapy against rapidly proliferating tumours,
typically haematologic cancers, given their high rate of cell turnover. The pathophysiology
behind TLS is the release of potassium, phosphorus, and nucleic acids from rapidly dividing
cancer cells when they begin to be lysed by anti-cancer therapy. Hyperphosphataemia gives
rise to hypocalcaemia, and nucleic acids are metabolized to uric acid, producing hyperuricaemia. Renal failure may arise since both urate and phosphate may crystallize and cause
­intratubular obstruction. Crystal-independent mechanisms, including renal vasoconstriction and reduced renal blood flow, may also have a part to play. In this case, we see the manifestations of these metabolic abnormalities, with ECG changes suggestive of hyperkalemia,
paraesthesia probably induced by hypocalcaemia, and oliguria indicative of renal failure.
60

Case 19: Collapse in a patient undergoing chemotherapy

Given the patient’s hypovolaemic state, which predisposes the patient to develop renal
failure, the immediate management priority is fluid resuscitation. Hydration also helps
minimize a­ cidosis and increases urine pH, which reduces the risk of urate crystallization.
Hyperkalemia requires intervention with calcium gluconate, insulin and dextrose, given that
ECG changes are seen with the higher risk of arrhythmia. The other metabolic abnormality
that requires urgent intervention is hyperuricaemia. Rasburicase, which converts uric acid
to the inactive and soluble metabolite allantoin, is preferred to xanthine oxidase inhibitors
such as allopurinol, as rasburicase also breaks down existing uric acid whereas allopurinol
only prevents its further formation. Clinical TLS patients also often require management in
an ITU setting, given the need for cardiac monitoring and supportive management of renal
failure through haemofiltration.
KEY POINTS

• Acute renal failure is the rapid loss of renal function with retention of waste metab•
•

olites such as urea and creatinine, and may be due to pre-renal, renal or post-renal
causes.
Tumour lysis syndrome occurs with rapid lysis of rapidly proliferating cancer cells
after anti-cancer therapy and produces several metabolic derangements, including hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalemia and hyperuricaemia.
Crystallization of phosphate and urate may occlude renal tubules, causing renal
failure.

3. What treatment does this baby now require?

63

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 20
Around 1 in 4500 newborns have what may be considered ‘ambiguous genitalia’. Broadly,
there are two causal categories of ambiguous genitalia:
1. Virilized XX female. This may be the result of androgens of foetal (e.g. congenital
adrenal hyperplasia [CAH]) or maternal (e.g. drugs such as progesterone and danazol, maternal androgen-secreting tumours of the ovary or adrenal gland) origin.
The other main causes are dysmorphic conditions such as Beckwith–Wiedemann
and Seckel syndromes.
2. Undervirilized XY male. This may arise from a biosynthetic defect leading to
reduced foetal androgen production (e.g. Leydig cell defects, 5-α-reductase deficiency, deficiency of anti-Müllerian hormone), end-organ unresponsiveness to
androgens (androgen insensitivity syndrome), dysmorphic syndromes (e.g. Smith–
Lemli–Opitz syndrome) and testicular dysgenesis or malfunction.
The evaluation of ambiguous genitalia should begin with the history to look for the use of
any drugs that may cause female virilization, any evidence of maternal virilization that may
suggest a maternal androgen-secreting tumour, and any family history of a genetic disorder. A complete examination of the child is required to assess its general condition, identify dysmorphic features, and assess the external genitalia (number of gonads, degree of
virilization, length of the phallus and any hyperpigmentation that would suggest excessive
­adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] production). The most important initial tests are to
determine karyotype and assess internal anatomy by way of pelvic ultrasound. The other priority is to avoid a salt-losing crisis (seen in CAH); therefore, blood tests for electrolytes, LH,
FSH and androgen levels (testosterone, DHEA, androstenedione and 17-OH-progestrone)
are required.
In this neonate, physical examination is consistent with clitoromegaly and labial fusion,
suggesting a virilized XX female, though formal karyotypical analysis is needed for confirmation. The blood tests are informative of the diagnosis as they reveal mild hyponatraemia, hyperkalemia, evidence of hypovolaemia and acidosis. These are consistent with the
salt-wasting form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the enzyme defect accounting for more than
90% of cases of CAH.
CAH is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficiencies of one of five enzymes
required for adrenal steroid synthesis (see Figure 20.1). 21-hydroxylase is required for the
synthesis of aldosterone and cortisol but not that of adrenal androgens. Deficiency of cortisol
leads to feedback upregulation of ACTH, which overstimulates the adrenal cortex, producing adrenal hyperplasia. Since a block in adrenal mineralo- and glucocorticoid production is
present, the steroid precursors are diverted towards the androgen pathway, leading to their
overproduction and subsequent virilization. The aldosterone and cortisol deficiency leads to
a state of adrenal insufficiency, causing hyponatraemia, hyperkalemia, acidosis and circulatory collapse (typically between day 5 and 15).
This case illustrates the severest form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the so-called ‘salt-­wasting’
subtype, where there is total lack of the enzyme. Partial enzyme deficiency produces a less
severe phenotype (‘simple virilizing’) with adequate aldosterone production, and hence no
fluid or electrolyte losses, but with still a strong virilizing effect. Non-classic 21-­hydroxylase
deficiency is commoner than classic forms of the disease and produces late-onset and mild

without gross virilization at birth.
The diagnosis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency can be made with the finding of elevated ­random
17-hydroxyprogesterone levels in the blood. Measurement of this metabolite after ACTH
stimulation can help determine the clinical subtype, with the highest levels seen with
­salt-wasting forms and lower levels with non-classic deficiency.
Management of this baby involves urgent fluid resuscitation with subsequent gluco- and
mineralocorticoid replacement. The other issue is that of the virilized genitalia, which may
be surgically corrected in the first year of life.
KEY POINTS

• Ambiguous genitalia in a newborn may represent either an over-virilized XX female
or an under-virilized XY male.

• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is usually due to a deficiency of 21-hydroxylase,
and is a common cause of ambiguous genitalia.

• When 21-hydroxylase is completely deficient, newborns may present with a ‘saltwasting’ crisis as a result of their lack of mineralocorticoids.

67

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 21
In this case, the clinical picture is suggestive of Cushing’s syndrome (chronic h
­ ypercortisolism).
The clinical features of Cushing’s syndrome may be categorized by system:
• General (obesity and hypertension)
• Dermatologic (striae, bruising, acne, hirsuitism)
• Musculoskeletal (weakness, osteopenia)
• Neuropsychiatric (depression, emotional upheaval)
• Reproductive (menstrual disturbance, reduced libido, impotence)
• Metabolic (glucose intolerance, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia)
Other signs that the physician should look out for include a ‘Cushingoid’ facies (‘moon’ face),
facial plethora, and supraclavicular and cervical fat deposits (‘buffalo hump’).
Appreciation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis allows us to understand the causes
of Cushing’s syndrome. Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is produced in the hypothalamus and stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce ACTH. The latter acts on the
adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids (cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone).
Hence, the causes of Cushing’s syndrome are categorized as either ACTH-dependent or
ACTH-independent. The commonest cause of the former is an ACTH-producing pituitary
adenoma (the term Cushing’s disease is used in this case), while ectopic production of ACTH
(e.g. paraneoplastic phenomenon in small cell lung cancer) is another. The commonest
ACTH-independent cause (and indeed the commonest cause overall) is exogenous s­ teroid
therapy. Less common ACTH-independent causes include a cortisol-producing adrenal
­neoplasm and adrenal hyperplasia.
The first stage in the evaluation of suspected Cushing’s syndrome is biochemical confirmation
of the diagnosis. This is achieved with a low-dose or overnight dexamethasone suppression
test (i.e. failure to suppress cortisol levels after a steroid dose), midnight serum or salivary cortisol levels (elevated in Cushing’s but low in healthy individuals), or 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. All three have similar specificities of ~90%, but the specificity is much lower with the
latter test (40–50%), compared to nearly 100% for a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test.
Once the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome is made, the priority is to determine its cause. The first
step would be to exclude exogenous use of glucocorticoids, before moving on to measure plasma
ACTH levels (to determine ACTH dependence). In the case of normal ACTH levels, imaging of
the adrenal glands by CT or MRI is needed to identify the type of adrenal lesion (e.g. adenoma,
carcinoma). With elevated ACTH levels, prompt pituitary imaging via MRI should be performed
to look for a pituitary macroadenoma. In the presence of a radiologically normal pituitary, CRH
stimulation with measurement of ACTH via bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling can be
used to identify a pituitary microadenoma. Additionally, a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test may help, with suppression of cortisol levels seen in Cushing’s disease but not in cases
of ectopic ACTH secretion or an adrenal tumour. If a paraneoplastic syndrome is suspected, CT
imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will be required to look for a primary tumour.
KEY POINTS

• Causes of Cushing’s syndrome are either ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent.
• A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test may be used to confirm the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome.

• Measurement of ACTH levels can help distinguish between the various causes.

69

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 22
According to the latest NICE guidelines, hypertension is defined as blood pressure of
140/90 mmHg or higher that is confirmed by home or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. In the majority of patients, there is no clear cause (“essential hypertension”) but a
secondary cause is present in around 5–10% of cases. Secondary hypertension should be
­considered in young patients, those with very high blood pressure (>180/110 mmHg), absence
of risk factors for essential hypertension, a history of hypertensive emergencies, and severe
or progressive target organ damage (e.g. deteriorating renal function), and where there are
particular symptoms or signs suggestive of an underlying cause (e.g. palpitations, flushing).
Here, the fact that our patient was first diagnosed with hypertension in her thirties and that
it is still poorly controlled is an indication that a secondary cause should be considered.
The causes of secondary hypertension may be categorized as follows:
• Renal, including renal parenchymal disease, renal artery stenosis and renin-­
producing tumours
• Endocrine, including primary aldosteronism, Cushing’s syndrome, phaeochromocytoma, acromegaly, and hypo- or hyperthyroidism
• Cardiac (coarctation of the aorta)
• Neurologic, particularly raised intracranial pressure and stress
• Other, including obstructive sleep apnoea and drugs (e.g. steroids, NSAIDs)
In this patient, the normal abdominal and cardiac examination would seem to rule out a renovascular or cardiac cause, while normal renal function excludes the presence of renal parenchymal disease. A normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) precludes thyroid dysfunction, and
there are no clinical features to suggest Cushing’s syndrome or phaeochromocytoma. Though
stress could be a potential cause, the finding of mild hypokalemia makes primary aldosteronism the likeliest diagnosis.
Primary aldosteronism refers to increased production of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex,
most commonly caused by an adenoma (Conn’s syndrome) and sometimes by bilateral adrenal
hyperplasia. This leads to excess retention of sodium, and subsequently water, consequently
expanding extracellular fluid volume, and thereby leading to higher blood pressure. Aldosterone
is responsible for stimulating potassium excretion, hence the finding of hypokalemia.
There are three steps in working up a suspected case of primary aldosteronism: (1) ­screening,
(2) diagnosis, and (3) elucidating the cause. Screening is performed by measuring the
aldosterone:renin ratio, which would be very high (>2000) in hyperaldosteronism as a result
of feedback suppression of renin secretion. Subsequently, a confirmatory diagnostic test is
needed, such as a fludrocortisone suppression test or a saline infusion test. The principle
is that fludrocortisone should suppress aldosterone levels in normal individuals, while in
the saline infusion test, sodium loading should inhibit aldosterone secretion. Once primary
aldosteronism is confirmed, imaging of the adrenal glands (via CT, or, occasionally, MRI) is
needed to identify an adenoma or to exclude a functional adrenocortical carcinoma.
KEY POINTS

• The majority of cases of hypertension are idiopathic, but around 5–10% are due to
a secondary cause.

• Clues suggesting a secondary cause include young age of onset, very high blood pressures, hypertensive emergencies and specific symptoms (e.g. flushing, palpitations).

• Primary aldosteronism is one cause of secondary hypertension and may be
screened for by measuring the aldosterone:renin ratio.

She reports vomiting up to 12 times a day, aggravated by eating and drinking, and generalized fatigue and muscle weakness “all over”. She describes paraesthesia in the distal extremities of her limbs. Her other medical problems include asthma, insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, hypertension and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

Examination
There is reduced skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. There is some epigastric tenderness, but the abdomen is otherwise soft and non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. Digital
rectal examination demonstrates good sphincter tone.

Questions
1. How is serum potassium regulated within the body?
2. What are the causes of hypokalemia?
3. What risks and complications are associated with hypokalemia?

71

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 23
The normal serum (extracellular) potassium ranges from 3.5 to 5.5 mM, with intake of
around 60 mmol equalling excretion by the cortical collecting duct of the kidneys (50 mmol)
and faeces (10 mmol). In the case of chronically impaired kidney function, the body adapts
to increase the excretion of potassium in faeces.
There are several causes of hypokalemia, but fundamentally they result from three processes:
(1) reduced K+ intake, (2) transcellular movement of K+, and (3) increased K+ excretion.
Movement of potassium from the extracellular to intracellular compartment is seen with an
alkalosis (K+ and H+ tend to move in opposite directions, so when H+ moves out of cells to
correct an alkalosis, K+ moves in), insulin treatment, use of β-agonists (hence why salbutamol can be used to treat hyperkalemia) and in the refeeding syndrome. Increased excretion
of potassium may occur via the kidneys (e.g. diuretics, diuretic phase of acute renal failure,
mineralocorticoid excess) or via extra-renal means (e.g. diarrhoea, vomiting, excess sweating, villous adenomas of the rectum).
This patient’s hypokalemia was most likely a result of vomiting, which caused excess losses
of potassium from gut contents. Other contributing factors could include anti-hypertensives such as loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide), which inhibit potassium reabsorption via the
Na+/K+/2Cl– cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The patient was
also on insulin and salbutamol, which promote influx of potassium into cells through the
Na/K−ATPase channel. The metabolic alkalosis also likely contributed too.
Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarisation of membranes, resulting in an impaired ability to
fire action potentials. This may particularly affect the heart with risk of subsequent arrhythmia. Indeed, ECG changes are observed with hypokalemia, including ST depression, T wave
depression or inversion, prolongation of the PR interval and a prominent U wave. Other
consequences of hypokalemia include constipation, ileus, rhabdomyolysis, and respiratory
muscle weakness resulting in ventilatory failure. With an impaired ability to concentrate
urine, patients may also develop a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which results in polydipsia
and polyuria with dilute “pale” urine.
The main aim in treating hypokalemia is to identify and manage the underlying cause
(e.g. discontinue offending drugs, prevent vomiting and diarrhoea). Potassium replacement
is frequently required, and generally 140 mmol is needed over 24 hours. It may be given
intravenously to start, but regular measurement is required to titrate the level of replacement. High doses of intravenous potassium can irritate peripheral veins, and should always
be diluted (e.g. in normal saline, which is also required to rehydrate the patient).
KEY POINTS

• Normal serum potassium ranges between 3.5 and 5.5 mM.
• When dealing with potassium, always remember to think of H+, since the two often
go in opposite directions.

• Causes of a low potassium level include reduced intake, transcellular movement
•

72

of potassium into the intracellular compartment, and increased excretion of
potassium.
ECG changes may be seen with hypokalemia, and there is an increased risk of
arrhythmia.

Case 24: Erectile dysfunction in a young man

CASE 24:

ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IN A YOUNG MAN

History
A 36-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of reduced libido and erectile dysfunction
that has been ongoing for a few months. He also gives a vague history of headaches increasing in frequency over the past few weeks. He denies weight loss and otherwise does not
suffer from any medical problems. He is on no regular medications, apart from ­occasional
­ibuprofen for headache.

Examination
Cardiac, respiratory and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Testicular size is 10 mL
by orchidometry. Neurologic examination is positive for bitemporal hemianopia.
INVESTIGATIONS
Full blood counts, renal function, electrolytes and liver function are all within normal
­limits. Further tests are sent with the results pending.

Questions
1. What are the causes of hypogonadism in men?
2. What is the likely diagnosis in this case, given the history and examination ­findings?
What investigations should be performed to confirm this?
3. What are the management options for this man’s underlying condition?

73

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 24
The finding of reduced testicular volume (normal testicular volume in post-pubertal men is
15–25 mL) is indicative of hypogonadism, a term that implies defective functional activity of
the gonads. Hypogonadism in men can either be primary (i.e. an intrinsic testicular problem)
or secondary to an underlying cause. In primary hypogonadism, there is loss of feedback suppression of gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) owing to low testosterone levels, hence the term
hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism is used. Causes of primary hypogonadism are either congenital (e.g. Klinefelter’s syndrome, testicular agenesis, enzyme defects such as 5-α-reductase
deficiency) or acquired (e.g. mumps orchitis, bilateral testicular injury or torsion, irradiation
to the testes, and effects of cytotoxic drugs). A number of conditions may lead to secondary
hypogonadism, including pituitary disorders (tumours and hypopituitarism), hypothalamic
disorders (e.g. Kallman’s syndrome), obesity and drugs.
Here, the findings of headache and bitemporal hemianopia are strongly suggestive of a
­pituitary tumour. The visual field defect results from suprasellar extension of the pituitary
gland, leading to compression of the optic chiasm, where the nasal fibres from each retina
decussate (these carry inputs from the temporal fields of vision). In the context of hypogonadism, reduced libido and erectile dysfunction, a prolactin-secreting adenoma (prolactinoma)
is the most likely diagnosis. Prolactinomas are the commonest type of pituitary adenoma,
accounting for 60% of cases. Hyperprolactinaemia leads to these symptoms via interference
with the secretion of GnRH by the hypothalamus. Testosterone production is downregulated, leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In women, this may manifest as amenorrhoea or infertility, while gynaecomastia and galactorrhoea may also be seen.
The first step in working up this man should include measurement of serum prolactin.
Baseline assessment of thyroid function would be useful, as primary hypothyroidism is a
common cause of hyperprolactinaemia. Subsequently, an MRI of the brain would be indicated to look for an adenoma. This would help classify the tumour as a micro- (<10 mm) or
macroadenoma (≥10 mm), though the presence of a visual field defect is indicative of the
latter. This categorization is useful, as it helps govern whether treatment is required (microadenomas do not always need it, whereas macradenomas generally do).
Treatment of prolactinoma is either medical or surgical. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine or cabergoline, form the mainstay of treating micro- and macro-adenomas as
they suppress prolactin secretion. Trans-sphenoidal surgical resection is a curative option
for microadenomas and as a debulking method for macroadenomas. Reasons for considering surgery include tumour growth despite optimum medical treatment, inability to tolerate
dopamine agonists and persistent optic chiasm compression on optimal medical therapy.
KEY POINTS

• Hypogonadism in men can either be primary (due to an intrinsic testicular prob•

lem) or secondary to a condition that interferes with the hypothalamo-pituitarytesticular axis.
Prolactinomas are the commonest form of pituitary adenoma and may present
with infertility, reduced libido and gynaecomastia.
Management of prolactinoma is usually with dopamine agonists, which inhibit prolactin secretion.

75

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 25
The principal lipids in plasma are fatty acids, triglycerides (TGs) and cholesterol. These are
transported in plasma in association with proteins, with free fatty acids carried by albumin
and other lipids circulating in complexes, termed lipoproteins, that have a non-polar lipid core
and a surface layer of phospholipids, cholesterol and apolipoproteins. Lipoproteins are class­
ified based on their density, increasing from chylomicrons to very low-density l­ipoproteins
(VLDL), intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high
density lipoproteins (HDL). As density increases, less TG is present, with increasing amounts
of cholesterol and proteins.
Chylomicrons are formed from dietary fat, and their function is to transport TG to the tissues. VLDLs are the primary transport mode for endogenous TG, and as TGs are released to
tissues by the action of lipoprotein lipase, they become denser to form IDL, and then LDL.
LDL carries the majority of plasma cholesterol, which may be taken up by macrophages, a
pathogenic event of atherosclerosis. LDL also binds to receptors in the liver, with subsequent
lysosomal degradation leading to release of cholesterol intracellularly, which is excreted into
bile. The metabolism of HDL is complex but essentially it mediates ‘reverse cholesterol transport’ by taking up cholesterol from senescent cells and transferring it to remnant lipoprotein
particles that are eventually cleared by the liver.
Hyperlipidaemia is one of the key modifiable risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis. It may either be primary, arising from a genetic disorder, or secondary to other conditions, including hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, obesity, nephrotic syndrome, renal and
liver failure, drugs (e.g. thiazides, antiretrovirals), and alcohol.
In this case, the man has high levels of total and LDL cholesterol. Given his young age,
potential family history and the clinical findings of tendon xanthomata and corneal arcus,
a primary hyperlipidaemia is likely to account for this. The likely diagnosis is familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), which is an autosomal dominant disorder of LDL metabolism, usually arising from mutations in the LDL receptor leading to reduced uptake by the liver. The
homozygous form of the disease is rare and presents in childhood; our patient is more likely
to have the heterozygous form, which is reasonably common with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 500. It typically presents in adulthood with total cholesterol >7.5 and LDL cholesterol >5; a family history of early coronary artery disease or hypercholesterolaemia in a
close relative is also required to make the diagnosis. Tendon xanthomas, which are essentially
deposits of cholesterol, are pathognomonic.
The management of FH involves lifestyle changes (dietary restriction and regular exercise)
and drugs, principally using statins, ezetimibe (which inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption) and bile acid sequestrants. LDL apheresis is used in extremely severe cases.
KEY POINTS

• LDL is the principal lipoprotein responsible for transporting cholesterol in the
body, and is cleared by the liver, with excretion of cholesterol in bile.

• Mutations in the LDL receptor cause familial hypercholesterolaemia, which presents with hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, early-onset vascular disease
and tendon xanthomas.

CASE 26:

RASH AFTER A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT

History
A 45-year-old man presents to the Haemato-Oncology clinic with a rash. He was diagnosed
with acute myeloid leukaemia a year ago and received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant
for relapsed disease 28 days ago. He also complains of abdominal pain, and worsening vomiting and diarrhoea. He takes cyclosporin prophylaxis.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 26
After a bone marrow transplant (and any associated chemotherapy), the main risks are
­infection (from low white cell counts and the use of immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporin), bleeding (from low platelet counts) and graft versus host disease (GVHD). The causes of
a rash in this setting can be a viral, bacterial or drug exanthem, GVHD, or toxic epidermal
necrolysis. Given that this patient also has a fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and
signs of jaundice, he may also have an underlying gastroenteritis or liver pathology.
An erythematous rash that develops on the palms or soles of the feet of a patient 10–30 days
after a bone marrow transplant is characteristic of GVHD. The pathophysiology of GVHD is
still not completely understood, but three requirements for it to occur are proposed:
1. The graft contains immune cells (T-cells).
2. The host expresses antigens that are different to those in the donor.
3. The host is unable to mount an immune response to eliminate the donor cells.
Essentially, donor T-cells recognize host antigens as foreign or ‘non-self’ and provoke an
immune response also involving B-cells and leading to production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1. As the patient’s immune system is designed to be suppressed
to allow engraftment of the recipient bone marrow, this response is directed against the
patient’s own body.
GVHD is a potentially life-threatening problem that can occur in up to 80% of successful
allogeneic bone marrow transplants. It may also occur in a milder form in up to 10% of
autologous engraftments, where it is hypothesized that chemotherapy exposes self-antigens,
which the immune system did not recognize before.
Clinically, GVHD manifests like an autoimmune disease with a macular-papular rash, jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly and ultimately organ fibrosis. It classically involves the skin,
gastrointestinal tract and the liver. Further investigations in this patient would include a full
blood count, measurement of renal function and electrolytes, and liver function tests. A skin
biopsy would allow histological grading and assessment of the severity of the disease.
Depending on severity, treatment of acute GVHD may involve topical and intravenous steroid therapy, immunosuppression (e.g. cyclosporine), or biologic therapies targeting TNF-α
(e.g. infliximab, entanercept), a key inflammatory cytokine. Resolution often takes more than
one month, and patients should be carefully monitored for opportunistic infections.
Prognosis is related to response to treatment. The mortality of patients who completely respond
can still be around 20%, and the mortality in those who do not respond is as high as 75%.
KEY POINTS

• The complications of a bone marrow transplant include infection, bleeding and
GVHD.

• Fever and a rash in a patient who recently received chemotherapy or is using an

immunosuppressant should be investigated thoroughly, and has a broad differential diagnosis.
GVHD is a type IV, T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction by the graft against
the host.
GVHD is potentially life-threatening, and is more common in allogeneic bone
­marrow transplants.

Case 27: A fall on an outstretched hand

CASE 27:

A FALL ON AN OUTSTRETCHED HAND

History
A 55-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department after slipping on an icy road
and falling on her outstretched right hand. She complains of pain in her right wrist that has
not responded to simple analgesia, and has been unable to use her right hand since falling.
She has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica though has not had a flare-up for a couple of
years. She is a non-smoker.

Examination
The patient is haemodynamically stable. She is tender on palpation of the right wrist joint and
the ulnar styloid. There is no evidence of any neurovascular compromise.
INVESTIGATIONS
Plain radiograph of the wrist: transverse fracture of the distal radius with minimal dorsal
displacement of the wrist; there is also a fracture of the ulnar styloid.
The fracture is reduced and a back-slab is applied, and the patient is told to return to
Fracture Clinic in 2 weeks.

Questions
1. What is the name given to this fracture and what suspicion should its occurrence
raise?
2. What investigations should be arranged in clinic, and why?
3. Does the patient require any treatment, and what are the various options in
management?

79

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 27
A fracture of the distal radius with dorsal displacement of the distal fragment describes
a Colles fracture, and is classically caused by a fall on the outstretched (extended) hand.
The presence of a Colles fracture, especially in a relatively young individual, should raise the
question of osteoporosis, since it is one of the three “fragility fractures” associated with this
condition (the other two being fracture neck of femur and vertebral body fracture).
Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and microarchitectural disruption with
a resultant reduction in bone strength and predisposition to fracture. It is defined by a reduction in bone density of 2.5 times or greater from the standard deviation of a young adult
reference mean (i.e. T score ≤ –2.5). Bone density is governed by the rates of bone formation
and breakdown: bone mass accrues through adolescence and reaches a peak in early adulthood, remaining relatively stable until around the fourth decade. Beyond this age, bone mass
declines as a result of increased osteoclastic and reduced osteoblastic activity, and does so
at a faster rate in women as a result of oestrogen deficiency (oestrogen inhibits osteoclasts).
Osteoporosis may therefore be “primary” (post-menopausal in women) or secondary to an
underlying condition that accelerates the above process. Secondary causes are:
• Endocrine (e.g. thyrotoxicosis, glucocorticoid excess, hyperparathyroidism)
• Nutritional (e.g. vitamin D deficiency, malabsorptive conditions such as coeliac
disease)
• Drugs (principally steroid use)
• Other (e.g. multiple myeloma, osteogenesis imperfecta, rheumatoid arthritis)
In this case, the underlying aetiology may be a combination of chronic steroid treatment
for polymyalgia rheumatica and post-menopausal oestrogen deficiency. However, routine
investigations to exclude other secondary causes would be worth performing, including a
full blood count and ESR (to identify chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid
arthritis), bone profile (for Paget’s disease), liver and renal function (vitamin D deficiency
in renal failure), thyroid function, and a screen for myeloma (Bence Jones proteinuria and
serum immunoglobulins). The other important test would be to perform a dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) scan that will be able to measure bone density and confirm the
diagnosis.
Treatment of osteoporosis is via a combination of lifestyle and pharmacologic measures.
The former includes fall education and prevention as well as dietary supplementation of calcium and vitamin D. Pharmacologic measures consist of anti-resorptive agents (e.g. bisphosphonates, which inhibit osteoclasts, hormone replacement therapy, and selective oestrogen
receptor modulators – SERMs – such as raloxifene) and anabolic agents (e.g. strontium, and
parathyroid-hormone-related peptides such as teriparatide). In this patient, a bisphosphonate
would certainly be indicated, given that a fragility fracture has already occurred.
KEY POINTS

• Fragility fractures include fractures of the distal radius (Colles fracture), neck of
femur and vertebral body.

• Osteoporosis is characterized by a reduction in bone mass and most commonly
arises as an age-related phenomenon in women.

• Treatment for osteoporosis usually involves the use of bisphosphonates, which
inhibit osteoclastic activity.

3. How can the risk of graft rejection be reduced?

81

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 28
The leading indication for a liver transplant is alcoholic cirrhosis in adults and biliary atresia
in children. To enhance the viability of the graft, transplants of the liver should take place less
than 24 hours after the harvest. During this time the organ is kept at 4°C and in a specialized University of Wisconsin preservative solution that facilitates immediate graft perfusion
after transplant. The overall one-year survival of a liver transplant is over 90%, with 10-year
survival of around 70%.
Allograft transplant rejection tends to involve the biliary epithelium before the vascular
endothelium. Thus, the signs of rejection include increased serum bilirubin (indicating
reduced drainage of bile), and deranged liver function tests. If there is suspicion of r­ ejection,
other complications of transplantation must be ruled out. These include operative complications (e.g. thrombosis or anastomotic leak) and complications of immunosuppression
(infection, especially CMV) and lymphoproliferative diseases such as Epstein–Barr-virus
(EBV)–mediated B-cell proliferation. Diagnosis of CMV infection or EBV B-cell proliferation will often require tissue biopsy of the donated organ.
Transplant rejection can be classified by time course, which relates to the underlying immune
mechanism:

• Hyperacute organ rejection occurs within minutes of the graft perfusion in the oper-

ating theatre. It is characterized by a type II antibody-mediated hypersensitivity
reaction whereby pre-existing anti-graft antibodies in the recipient bind to foreign
antigens. This results in opsonization with phagocytes engulfing cells that have been
marked by antibodies. The antibodies activate complement, which enhances phagocytosis, and causes cell lysis. The treatment for hyperacute rejection is immediate
removal of the graft.
• Acute organ rejection take place a number of weeks after the transplant and is the
likely mechanism in this case. It is characterized by cell-mediated toxicity by cytotoxic T-cells. This process involves host CD4 T-cells recognising foreign antigens
(on the graft) and producing cytokines such as IL-2 that stimulate cytotoxic T-cells,
which are able to initiate apoptosis of the foreign tissue. The treatment for acute
rejection includes high dose steroids.
• Chronic organ rejection can take place months to years after the transplant. It is irreversible and characterized by both cell-mediated (cytotoxic T-cell) and antibodymediated (humoral) immune reactions that result in fibrosis and obliteration of the
blood vessels of the transplanted organ. As it is irreversible, treatment for chronic
rejection is difficult, and may include re-transplantation.
All recipients of an organ transplant receive immunosuppressive therapy. This is usually
a triple regime consisting of corticosteroids, azathioprine and cyclosporin or tacrolimus.
Triple therapy enables the use of lower doses of each drug, thereby reducing side effects.
Corticosteroids downregulate the immune response by inhibiting the principal proinflammatory transcription factor, NFκB. Azathioprine is a pro-drug that is cleaved into
the active metabolite mercaptopurine, which inhibits DNA replication and therefore hinders lymphocyte production and replication. Cyclosporin and tacrolimus (the latter is more
potent) both inhibit the protein calcineurin and the production of IL-2 by helper T-cells.
This results in reduced activation of helper and cytotoxic T-cells.

sis of organ rejection. These include operative complications, infection (especially

Hyperacute organ rejection is characterized by a type 2 antibody-mediated hypersensitivity reaction whereby antigraft antibodies in the recipient bind to foreign

Acute organ rejection is characterized by cell-mediated toxicity by cytotoxic
T-cells.
Chronic organ rejection is irreversible and characterized by both cell-mediated
(cytotoxic T-cell) and antibody-mediated (humoral) immune reactions.

85

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 29
The most obvious abnormality in the blood tests is a high serum creatinine and urea. Plasma
creatinine is the most reliable biochemical test of renal glomerular function and has an
inverse relationship with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). An estimate of GFR may be
made using the Cockcoft–Gault formula, whereby
eGFR (mL /min) =

(140 − age ) × Weight in kg
[ serum Cr ] × 0.81

An eGFR of 15 mL/min can be calculated for this patient, indicating renal failure. Although
we are not given details of the patient’s baseline renal function, the renal ultrasound shows
small kidneys bilaterally, which suggests that this is long-standing in nature.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a reduction in GFR over a period of 3 or
more months (normal GFR is >90–120 mL/min). It arises from a progressive impairment of
renal function with a decrease in the number of functioning nephrons; generally, patients
remain asymptomatic until GFR reduces to below 15 mL/min (stage V CKD). Common
causes of CKD are (1) diabetes mellitus, (2) hypertension, (3) glomerulonephritis, (4) renovascular disease, (5) chronic obstruction or interstitial nephritis, and (6) hereditary or cystic
renal disease (e.g. polycystic kidneys). In this case, the most likely underlying cause of the
patient’s CKD is hypertension.
There are several metabolic consequences of CKD, which give rise to the clinical manifests
illustrated by this case. There is impairment of urinary concentration, leading to polyuria
and nocturia. Electrolyte homeostasis becomes deranged as the kidney’s primary roles
in excreting potassium and H+ are affected, which can cause hyperkalemia and acidosis.
The kidney’s synthetic function in producing erythropoietin (EPO) is reduced, leading
to a normocytic anaemia. There is also retention of waste metabolic products, principally
urea, and the consequent uraemic state may lead to pericarditis and interference with the
­hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (as manifested by impotence in this case). Dyslipidaemia
is another complication, and partly explains why cardiovascular disease is the most frequent
cause of death amongst patients with CKD.
The bony pains experienced by this patient are also related to renal failure. In CKD, there
is phosphate retention with subsequent hypocalcaemia as well, with reduced production of
1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (DHCC) (activated vitamin D) by the kidneys. The latter leads
to osteomalacia, while the former stimulates increased parathyroid hormone production,
leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Additionally, in an acidotic state, excess H+ ions
are buffered by bone, causing further demineralisation. These various mechanisms underlie
what is termed renal osteodystrophy.
The general principles of managing this patient would include close monitoring of renal
function, aggressive control of blood pressure, dietary protein restriction and management of cardiac risk factors. Further, as this patient is bordering upon stage V CKD (GFR
<15 mL/min), referral to a nephrologist for consideration of renal replacement therapy
and/or transplantation would be warranted.

86

Case 29: A man with poorly controlled blood pressure

KEY POINTS

• CKD refers to the progressive and irreversible impairment in renal function, l­eading
to a reduction in the GFR over at least 3 months.

• The most important causes of CKD include diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis and renovascular disease.

• Various metabolic abnormalities are seen in CKD, including hyperkalemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia and a normocytic anaemia.

She complains of dizziness on waking up in the morning and has lost 2 kg in weight over
this period. She has a history of coeliac disease that is well controlled by a gluten-free diet.

Examination
Vital signs are T 36.4°C, HR 85 and regular, BP 105/70 (sitting) and 95/60 (standing). General
examination reveals a thin woman with evidence of pigmentation in the palmar creases,
nipples and areolae, as well as around her Caesarean scar.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 30
Postural hypotension has several causes, including cardiac and neurologic disease as well as
a drug side-effect. In this case, there is absence of a drug history and positive neurologic or
cardiac findings; the most suggestive clinical finding is hyperpigmentation, which is one of
the earliest features of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease). Addison’s disease
is characterized by the destruction or loss of adrenal cortical function. The adrenal cortex is
responsible for producing mineralocorticoids (e.g. aldosterone), glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol)
and adrenal androgens. Normally, cortisol feedback inhibits ACTH secretion by the anterior
pituitary. ACTH is itself produced from a larger product (pro-opiomelanocortin [POMC]),
which is a precursor for MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone); hence, when there is cortisol
deficiency, the release from feedback suppression causes high levels of ACTH and MSH to be
produced, the latter contributing to hyperpigmentation. Similarly, the deficiency of aldosterone
is responsible for postural hypotension (resulting from reduced extracellular fluid volume) and
the electrolyte abnormalities seen here (mild hyponatraemia and hyperkalemia, with a raised
urea:creatinine ratio, suggestive of volume depletion).
There are various tests that may be used to evaluate adrenal insufficiency. Measurement of
9 am serum cortisol can be used to rule out adrenal failure, with a level >550 nM effectively
excluding the diagnosis; similarly, a very low level (<50 nM) would point towards adrenal
insufficiency. However, in many subjects, these may not be conclusive and an ACTH stimulation test (‘short synacthen test’) is required. In this test, a 9 am cortisol is measured with
administration of synthetic ACTH (‘Synacthen’) at this time; further cortisol levels are measured at 30 and 60 minutes and should normally exceed 550 nM. Failure to do so, or to at
least increase by 200 nM, would indicate adrenal insufficiency. While this test does not tell
us whether insufficiency is primary or secondary to pituitary disease, measuring the plasma
ACTH level can help determine this – a very high level (>20 pM) would indicate primary
adrenal failure due to lack of feedback suppression.
Addison’s disease merely signifies the presence of primary adrenal failure, which itself has
numerous causes. The commonest aetiology is an autoimmune adrenalitis, which, given the
history of coeliac disease, is likely in this scenario because of the link with certain HLA
alleles (DR3/DR4). Other causes of Addison’s include adrenal haemorrhage (e.g. disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to Neisseria meningitidis infection, the so-called
Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome), infections (tuberculosis was the commonest cause
historically), metastatic adrenal disease (especially from a lung primary), and adrenoleukodystrophy (an X-linked disorder afflicting men, characterized by accumulation of very long
chain fatty acids in several organs, including the adrenal gland).
KEY POINTS

• Addison’s disease describes primary adrenal insufficiency, which has several
causes.

• Autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex is the commonest cause of
•

90

Addison’s disease and is usually associated with other autoimmune conditions
(such as diabetes and coeliac disease).
A short synacthen test with concomitant measurement of ACTH levels can be used
to diagnose Addison’s disease.

Case 31: Sudden-onset chest pain in a tall woman

CASE 31:

SUDDEN-ONSET CHEST PAIN IN A TALL WOMAN

History
A 32-year-old woman is brought into hospital by ambulance after complaining of severe
retrosternal chest pain while on her way to work. Her past history is notable for a spontaneous pneumothorax. She has a 20 pack-year smoking history and takes regular bisoprolol. Her
family history is notable for her father dying from a ‘heart condition’ at age 40.

Examination
General examination reveals a tall, gangly female with a pectus deformity of the chest and
ectopia lentis. Abdominal and flank striae are present. HR is 120 and BP 100/60, with RR of
28 and 94% O2 saturation on 15 L/min. A third heart sound is heard, together with bibasal
crackles on auscultation of the chest.
INVESTIGATIONS
ECG: ST elevation in leads V1–V6, I and L
Chest radiograph: widened mediastinum
Emergency coronary angiography: dilated aortic root, with a dissection flap and no flow
within the left main coronary artery

Questions
1. How do the angiography findings account for the patient’s presentation?
2. In light of the clinical findings, what condition is suspected? Discuss its genetics and
pathophysiology.
3. What treatment should the patient receive after this acute episode?

91

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 31
The clinical presentation here is strongly suggestive of myocardial ischaemia and the fi
­ nding
of ST elevation in the anterior and lateral leads corroborates this diagnosis. However, the
pathology is not purely limited to an acute coronary syndrome as there are also features
of aortic dissection (widened mediastinum and dissection flap on coronary angiography).
We may conclude that the dissection flap has closed off the ostia of the left main coronary
artery (so this is a type A aortic dissection), thereby leading to cardiac ischaemia. This has
also produced likely cardiogenic shock, given the tachycardia and borderline hypotension,
the presence of a third heart sound and bibasal crackles.
This constellation of findings are highly consistent with an underlying diagnosis of Marfan’s
syndrome, a connective tissue disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with
high penetrance but significant phenotypic heterogeneity. Several of the classic features of
Marfan’s are present, including a pectus deformity of the chest, ectopia lentis, the characteristic body habitus, and aortic root dilatation. The positive family history and the history of
prior spontaneous pneumothorax support this diagnosis.
The genetic defect underlying most cases of Marfan’s is a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene,
which encodes a matrix glycoprotein that forms a key component of the extracellular
matrix. Dilatation and weakness of the aortic root arises as a direct result of the loss of
vessel elasticity, predisposing individuals to aortic aneurysms and dissection. The inherent
weakness in connective tissues provides the explanation for other pathognomonic features
of Marfan’s, including ectopia lentis (subluxation of the lens), joint hypermobility and chest
wall deformity.
The predominant causes of death in patients with Marfan’s syndrome are aortic dissection
and rupture. All patients should therefore have regular echocardiographic monitoring to
chart the rate of increase of aortic diameter, and direct family members should be evaluated for any signs of disease, given the autosomal dominant genetics. Changes in lifestyle
designed to avoid sudden or high stresses on the aortic vessel wall are also needed, including
the avoidance of intense exertion or exercise. Drugs may also be used to achieve this, with
the negative ino- and chronotropic effects of β-blockers particularly effective in this regard.
Finally, ­surgery (ideally prophylactic) on the aortic root (a graft repair) has a beneficial effect
on survival and is recommended electively in all adults with an aortic root diameter of more
than 5 cm.
KEY POINTS

• Marfan’s syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the
fibrillin-1 gene, which encodes a matrix glycoprotein in the extracellular matrix.

• The most significant clinical feature of Marfan’s syndrome is aortic root dilatation,
which predisposes individuals to aortic aneurysms and aortic dissection.

Case 32: Concerns about the risk of breast cancer

CASE 32:

CONCERNS ABOUT THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER

History
A 33-year-old teacher comes to her GP worried about her risk of developing breast c­ ancer.
Both her sisters have recently been diagnosed with the disease at a young age (31 and
38 years), and her mother died of breast cancer at age 45. Additionally, her maternal aunt
died of ­ovarian cancer in her fifties. She does not complain of any breast symptoms at present.
Her periods started at age 13, and she has one child who is now seven years old. She currently
takes the combined oral contraceptive pill.

Examination
General and breast examination is unremarkable.

Questions
1. Given her family history, what is the likelihood that this woman is at increased risk
of breast cancer?
2. What are the common forms of hereditary breast cancer that you know? Describe
their genetics and how they predispose to oncogenesis.
3. What strategies would you recommend regarding (a) screening for, and (b) prevention of breast cancer in this case?

93

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 32
Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in women in the UK and is the second ­commonest
cause of female cancer death. While 15% of women will have at least one close relative
(mother, sister or daughter) who is affected by breast cancer, a small proportion of breast
cancers (10%) are ascribed as “hereditary breast cancer”, owing to germ-line mutations in
single, dominantly acting genes. This should be suspected in a family where the following
features are present:
• Early-onset breast cancer (<50 yrs)
• Bilateral cancers
• Particular ethnicity (e.g. Ashkenazi Jews)
• Any male breast cancer
• Other associated cancers (e.g. ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube)
The family history here is strongly suggestive of a hereditary predisposition to breast cancer,
with three first-degree relatives and one second-degree relative being afflicted by either a
breast or related cancer at a young age.
The most common mutations underlying hereditary breast cancer are those in the BRCA1
and BRCA2 genes, whose prevalence is estimated at between 1 in 400–800. Women harbouring these mutations have a 10–30-fold increased risk of breast cancer compared to the
general female population. For BRCA1, the lifetime breast cancer risk is around 80% with a
40% ovarian cancer risk. There is also a small risk (<5%) of primary peritoneal carcinoma.
In the case of BRCA2, lifetime risks for breast and ovarian cancer are smaller (40% and 10%,
respectively); there is also an increased risk of fallopian tube carcinoma and an excess risk of
prostate cancer in men carrying the mutation.
Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 encode proteins that have a crucial role in the cell cycle, which helps
us understand how mutations accelerate oncogenesis. BRCA1, on chromosome 17, encodes a
protein that is involved in the DNA damage response; in individuals with a germ-line mutation, the wild-type allele is deleted, leading to impaired checkpoint regulation and allowing
mutated and damaged DNA to be replicated. Similarly, BRCA2, on chromosome 13, encodes
a protein that plays a role in homologous recombination, which is one of the mechanisms by
which double-strand breaks of DNA are repaired, a mutation in this gene thereby increasing
the chances that the cell will replicate damaged or mutated DNA.
The first step in evaluating this woman for a possible hereditary predisposition would be
genetic testing of affected family members and herself to confirm the presence of a mutation.
If this is confirmed, there are two management options: primary prevention, and surveillance. The former includes prophylactic mastectomy and/or oophorectomy, or chemoprevention with tamoxifen, while the latter involves regular breast self-examination along with
frequent physician examination together with annual radiographic screening by way of
mammography and breast MRI.
KEY POINTS

• 10% of breast cancers are hereditary in nature, and should be suspected in families
with early age of onset of disease and presence of bilateral tumours.

• The commonest genetic causes of a hereditary breast cancer are mutations in
BRCA1 and BRCA2, both of which are important in the DNA damage response.

Case 33: Seizure in a neonate

CASE 33:

SEIZURE IN A NEONATE

History
A five-day-old neonate, born via normal delivery, is seen by his mother to have a “seizure”
when she is feeding him. She says that he became limp and his arms flexed before being
released. The episode ended within a minute without any medical intervention. Routine prenatal scanning had identified cardiac features consistent with tetralogy of Fallot.

Examination
The neonate is cyanotic, with a soft ejection systolic murmur. The physician notes dysmorphic facies including microcephaly, low set ears with abnormal folding, and increased distance between the medial epicanthi of the eyes. The eyes are downward slanting.

95

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 33
Neonatal seizures may be caused by several conditions, the most common of which are
hypoxic-ischaemia encephalopathy, intracranial haemorrhage, CNS infections, and metabolic disorders. Seizures may also be benign, typically occurring in the first week of life.
Here, blood tests show low calcium, high phosphate and low parathyroid hormone levels,
which are suggestive of hypoparathyroidism, and this is the most likely cause of the seizure
in this case.
Approximately 40% of serum calcium exists in the active ionized form. However, the majority of calcium is bound to proteins such as albumin. Thus the commonest cause of hypocalcaemia is hypoalbuminemia, usually caused by reduced synthesis resulting from liver
failure, or increased protein losses as a result of the nephrotic syndrome. Other causes of
hypocalcemia include autoimmune or congenital hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, and loop diuretics (not thiazide diuretics, which can cause hypercalcemia).
Tetralogy of Fallot is a reasonably common congenital cardiac anomaly, characterized by
(1) significant ventricular septal defect, (2) pulmonic stenosis, (3) over-riding aorta with
respect to the septal defect, and (4) subsequent right ventricular hypertrophy. The association
of tetralogy of Fallot with neonatal seizures (due to hypoparathyroidism) as well as dysmorphic facies is very suggestive of a congenital cause.
The most likely cause for this combination of problems is DiGeorge syndrome. DiGeorge
syndrome is caused by a deletion in chromosome 22q11 (affecting the gene TBX1). This
results in defects in neural crest cell migration and their derived tissues, notably the 3rd and
4th branchial pouch. Embryologically, the 3rd branchial pouch is responsible for the develop­
ment of the inferior parathyroid glands and the thymus, whereas the 4th branchial pouch
develops into the superior parathyroid glands. Neural crest migration is also critical for the
development of the heart, ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk.
Clinically, erroneous development of the parathyroid glands results in hypocalcemia, which
can present as neonatal seizures, tetany, proximal muscle weakness or mental state changes.
Hypoplasia of the thymus gland results in T-cell deficiency and recurrent viral or fungal
infections. Congenital cardiac anomalies such as tetralogy of Fallot are caused by problems
with neural crest cell migration. Of note, DiGeorge syndrome is the second commonest cause
of congenital cardiac abnormalities after Down’s syndrome. Other signs include ­learning
­difficulties, and dysmorphic facies, as described in the case.
DiGeorge syndrome is usually the result of de novo mutations, with 100% penetrance and
variable expression. It may also be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
KEY POINTS

• Neonatal seizures are commonly a result of ischaemia, haemorrhage, and metabolic disturbances, or they may be benign.

• Aberrant development of the 3rd and 4th branchial pouches causes DiGeorge
syndrome (deletion in chromosome 22q11).

• This is associated with T-cell deficiency (thymic aplasia) and hypocalcaemia (failure
of parathyroid development). It is also the second commonest cause of congenital
heart defects.

4. What further HIV-specific investigations should be performed at this stage?
5. What prophylactic measures can be taken against opportunistic infections in HIVinfected individuals?

97

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 34
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that has infected more than
30 million people worldwide. The laboratory diagnosis of HIV can be made genomically
(detection of viral nucleic acid by PCR), serologically (detection of antigens or antibodies by ELISA) or immunologically (through detection of a low CD4 cell count). Here, the
presence of the capsid protein (p24) of HIV has been confirmed but no anti-HIV antibodies have been detected. This is because the serologic response to HIV infection may
take a minimum of 4–8 weeks to develop (even as long as 6 months in some cases – the
‘window period’).
The primary target of HIV is the immune system, and the virus predominantly infects
CD4 T-cells (helper T-cells), as well as other immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. In a subversive manner, latent infection of these cells is released when the
immune system is activated – inflammatory cytokines lead to activation of NFκB, which
binds the promoters of various target cytokine genes as well as sequences of the HIV
genome, leading to activation of proviral DNA. When new virions bud off, cell lysis is
induced (up to 2 billion CD4 T-cells may be killed in this way each day). Aside from the
quantitative impact on T-cells, HIV also produces qualitative defects in T-cell function,
with reduced proliferation in response to antigenic stimulation and a general reduction
in T H1 responses, leading to a deficit in cell-mediated immunity. It should be appreciated
that CD4 T-cells act as a “master regulator” of the adaptive immune response (e.g. through
activating B cells and antibody production), and hence the virus indirectly causes a defect
in the entire immune system.
The interplay between the virus and the immune system governs the clinical course of HIV
infection, and typically, there are three phases to infection:
1. Acute retroviral syndrome. This is the primary response of an immunocompetent
individual to HIV and is characterized by a flu-like illness 3–6 weeks after exposure
(seen in this case).
2. Middle chronic phase. The virus is latent and the immune system is largely intact.
It may be asymptomatic or characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy.
3. Full-blown AIDS. In this final phase, there is a dramatic increase in the viral load
with breakdown of host defences and appearance of serious opportunistic infections, secondary neoplasms and neurologic disease (“AIDS-defining illnesses” –
e.g. Pneumocystis, toxoplasmosis and mycobacterial infection, Kaposi’s sarcoma
and primary CNS lymphoma).
As the diagnosis of HIV has been confirmed, the specific anti-retroviral investigations that
need to be performed include obtaining a CD4 T-cell count and the HIV viral load (detection
of viral RNA by real-time PCR). There is typically an inverse relationship between the two,
with the latter governing the rate of decline of the former, which predicts the susceptibility of
the host to opportunistic infection. Other tests required at this stage include serologic tests
for toxoplasma and CMV, a tuberculin skin test (given the potential of reactivation or infection of TB in an immunodeficient host), an ECG (for baseline purposes prior to initiating
any anti-retroviral therapy) and a chest radiograph (as several HIV-related infections may
produce lung disease).
Certain prophylactic measures can be taken against opportunistic infections if the patient
has a high susceptibility (governed by CD4 T-cell count). For example, trimethoprim-­
sulphamethoxazole (Septrin) can be used to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
98

Case 34: Flu-like illness after foreign travel

(if CD4 count is <200) and toxoplasmosis (if CD4 count is <100). Similarly, azithromycin
can be used as mycobacterial prophylaxis in individuals with a CD4 count of 50 or less,
while prolonged anti-tuberculous treatment is merited in any HIV-positive patient with a
positive tuberculin test. Patients should also receive streptococcal, influenza and hepatitis
B vaccines (regardless of CD4 count).
KEY POINTS

• Antibody responses to HIV may take a few weeks to become detectable, so
•
•
•

c­ aution should be observed when interpreting serology in the immediate period
after potential viral transmission.
HIV mainly infects CD4 T-cells, producing both qualitative and quantitative defects
in their function.
There are three phases to HIV infection, starting with an acute retroviral syndrome,
moving on to a middle, latent phase, and progressing to full-blown AIDS.
Prophylaxis against opportunistic infection is used, depending on the CD4 T-cell
count.

HISTOPATHOLOGY

Case 35: A young woman with ankle swelling and shortness of breath

CASE 35: A YOUNG WOMAN WITH ANKLE SWELLING
AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH

History
A 25-year-old woman of Indian origin presents to the Emergency Department with
­progressive shortness of breath and ankle oedema over the previous three months. There
is a history of fever with joint pains during her childhood, which was spent in India. She
moved to the UK at age 18. There is no family history of note.

Examination
General examination confirms bilateral, pitting pedal oedema and mild clubbing of the
­fingers but no cyanosis. Cardiac examination reveals a rumbling mid-diastolic murmur
heard best at the apex, and a decrescendo early diastolic murmur heard best in end expiration at the left sternal edge. There are fine basal crepitations at both lung bases.
INVESTIGATIONS
ECG shows features consistent with left atrial enlargement. A chest radiograph shows
mild cardiomegaly, and an echocardiogram is booked.

Questions
1. What is the relevance of fever and joint pains in childhood?
2. Why is there a delay in the appearance of the cardiac symptoms?
3. What are the complications that may arise from this condition?

103

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 35
A history of fever and joint pains in childhood suggests rheumatic fever following Group A
(beta-haemolytic) streptococcal infection. The immune response to the bacterial antigens
cross-reacts with cardiac valvular and connective tissue elements in the joints and other sites.
It must be emphasized that cardiac valvular pathology is due to a type II (immune-mediated)
hypersensitivity reaction and not direct bacterial infection. The characteristic presentation
includes migratory polyarthritis of large joints, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema
marginatum of the skin and Sydenham’s chorea. Blood investigations typically show a raised
ESR or the presence of anti-streptolysin O (ASO) antibody.
The commonest valve to be involved is the mitral valve, followed by the aortic valve. The
murmurs found in this patient reflect this, being indicative of mitral stenosis (mid-diastolic
murmur) and aortic regurgitation (early diastolic murmur). The mitral valve is most frequently affected as it is the valve across which the greatest pressure difference arises. The
continued immunologic damage and fibrosis may progress over years to cause deformity of
the valves. This is the reason for the late manifestation of symptoms of valvular heart disease
although features of myocarditis may be present in the acute phase of rheumatic fever. Initial
valve damage results in mitral prolapse and with time the valvular damage takes the form of
thickening of the leaflets and fusion of commissures and cordae tendinae.
Inflammation of all three layers of the heart is termed pancarditis. If this is caused by
rheumatic heart disease, pathognomonic Aschoff bodies may form in all three layers of
the heart, but predominantly the myocardium. Aschoff bodies are granulomas with giant
cells (mainly macrophages), which can develop into Anitschkow’s cells, which represent
­activated enlarged macrophages.
The signs and symptoms of valvular disease depend on the valves involved and the severity of involvement. Cardiac failure may develop, accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy and
dilatation. In a tight mitral stenosis, the left atrium becomes dilated and a mural thrombus
may form. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (which may arise as a result of left atrial
enlargement) may lead to thromboembolic complications. Damaged cardiac valves are also
susceptible to infective endocarditis, which can worsen the valvular insufficiency and also
result in infective emboli to the brain, kidneys, spleen (left-sided lesions) and lungs (rightsided lesions).
KEY POINTS

• Rheumatic heart disease results from a type II immune-mediated hypersensitivity
reaction to Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci.

• It most commonly affects the mitral valve, causing prolapse in early stages of the
disease and stenosis later on.

• Pathognomonic lesions that affect all three layers of the heart in rheumatic heart
disease include Aschoff bodies and Anitschkow’s cells which represent granulomas with giant cells (macrophages).

Case 36: Chest pain and sudden death

CASE 36:

CHEST PAIN AND SUDDEN DEATH

History
A 70-year-old man is working in his garden when he suddenly experiences crushing central
chest pain, starts sweating profusely and feels short of breath. An ambulance is called, but he
collapses in the interim and becomes unresponsive. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is commenced by the paramedics and continued until they reach hospital where no output can be
restored and the patient is declared dead. The Coroner requests that a post-mortem examination be carried out.

Examination
External examination of the body is unremarkable. The heart is of mildly increased weight
compared to the normal expected weight (up to 0.5% of body weight). The heart valves are
normal and there is concentric thickening of the left ventricle. The coronary arteries show
marked eccentric thickening and calcification of their walls, resulting in such narrowing that
only a pinpoint lumen can be seen at one site in the right-sided coronary artery.

Questions
1. How is sudden cardiac death defined and what are the main causes of sudden ­cardiac
death?
2. What is the most likely cause of death in this patient?
3. What is the aetiology and pathogenesis of the likely cause of death?
4. If the patient had been successfully resuscitated, what complications might have
occurred?

105

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 36
Sudden cardiac death is defined as unexpected death from a cardiac cause early after the
onset of symptoms, usually within one hour. The commonest causes of sudden cardiac death
include ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction or, especially in younger patients,
dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Other causes include aortic valve stenosis, mitral
valve prolapse, myocarditis, pulmonary hypertension, congenital structural abnormalities
or, when all of these conditions and other non-cardiac causes of sudden death have been
excluded, hereditary or acquired abnormalities of the conduction system. Irrespective of
the underlying cause of sudden cardiac death the common mechanism of death is a lethal
arrhythmia triggered by irritability of the myocardium even when the abnormality or injury
is distant from the conduction system. These conditions often do not cause symptoms and
sudden death may be the first presentation.
The cause of death in this patient is ischaemic heart disease. This term encompasses related
presentations of myocardial ischaemia and includes myocardial infarction, where the degree
and duration of interruption of blood supply is sufficient to cause death of the heart muscle,
or else angina, a lesser form where the heart muscle does not become infarcted. Since myocardial ischaemia of up to 30 minutes may be reversible, features of an acute infarct would
not necessarily be seen at autopsy.
Ischaemic heart disease is the most common cause of death in industrialized countries.
The dominant cause of ischaemic heart disease is reduced perfusion of coronary arteries relative to myocardial requirement, and in over 90% of cases reduced perfusion is
the result of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries with progressive narrowing of the
affected coronary artery. Such atherosclerotic plaques, which commonly show calcification, may rupture (‘acute plaque change’) and result in overlying thrombosis, which may
completely interrupt perfusion, or progressive stenosis of the coronary artery may lead to
critical narrowing (usually defined as a pinpoint residual lumen, or narrowing of more
than 75%).
Myocardial infarction, also known as a ‘heart attack’, implies death of heart muscle from
ischaemia. Whether ischaemia of the heart muscle results in infarction depends on the location and severity of the coronary artery narrowing, the rate at which it develops, the extent of
collateral blood supply and the metabolic needs of the heart muscle (this explains why angina
or infarction often occurs following exertion). Figure 36.1 demonstrates a recent transneural
infarct of the left ventricle.
Great progress has been made in the timely diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction
and as a result the overall mortality of myocardial infarction has sharply declined over the
last fifty years. In general, patients with previous infarcts, diabetes mellitus or higher age are
less likely to survive an infarct whereas those who do commonly develop one or more complications, some of which may be life threatening in themselves. These include heart failure
(which may be early or late), arrhythmias, rupture of the heart muscle with collection of
blood in the pericardial sac (cardiac tamponade), pericarditis, extension of the infarct, mural
thrombosis and embolism (e.g. a stroke) or valvular dysfunction due to papillary muscle
rupture.

KEY POINTS

• Sudden cardiac death is defined as death occurring within one hour of the onset

• The most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the middle aged and elderly
is ischaemic heart disease.

• Patients who survive a myocardial infarct may develop complications such as heart

failure, arrhythmia, cardiac tamponade, which may all cause death some time after
the infarct.

Case 37: An elderly man with severe back pain

CASE 37:

AN ELDERLY MAN WITH SEVERE BACK PAIN

A 77-year-old man phones ‘999’ after experiencing severe backache. The paramedics arrive to
find him in severe pain, and cold and clammy. While at his house, they note that he smokes
and also elicit a history of hypertension. He is tachycardic and hypotensive en route to hospital, and intravenous fluids are started.

Examination
At the Emergency Department, the patient’s observations are HR 120, BP 90/60, RR 26, 92%
on air. The physician is uncertain about the presence of an expansile mass in the abdomen,
but examination is hampered by an obese body habitus. Before further imaging or treatment could be commenced, the patient has a cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
is commenced but proves unsuccessful.
In view of the sudden unexplained death, the case is referred to the coroner and an autopsy is
performed. This shows extensive haematoma in the retroperitoneum.

Questions

ANSWER 37
The autopsy demonstrates massive haemorrhage into the retroperitoneum from a ruptured
abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The definition of an aneurysm is an abnormal permanent focal dilatation of all the layers of a blood vessel. An AAA is defined when the aortic
diameter, as measured below the level of the renal arteries, is one and a half times normal.
Women have smaller aortas, but for convenience, more than 3 cm qualifies as aneurysmal.
The main risk factors for aneurysm formation are male gender, smoking, hypertension,
Caucasian/European descent and atherosclerosis. Although atherosclerosis is a risk factor and
both diseases share common predisposing factors, there are also differences. Atherosclerosis
is primarily a disease of the intima, the innermost layer of the vessel wall, whereas in aneurysms there is degeneration of the media, the middle layer. The mechanisms are not fully
understood, but inflammation, oxidative stress and inappropriate enzyme activation results
in degradation of tissue matrix, collagen and elastin. The weakened wall progressively dilates
and with increasing diameter the tension in the wall increases, as does the risk of rupture.
The annual risk of rupture equals and begins to outstrip the risk of dying from surgery when
the aneurysm exceeds 5.5 cm. This is the size above which surgical repair is recommended,
comorbidities permitting. A UK national screening programme will eventually (by way of
abdominal ultrasound) target all men over the age of 65.
Clinical examination for an expansile, as opposed to a merely pulsatile, mass is helpful, but
not always reliable. Ultrasound and computed tomography are the preferred imaging modalities. In some AAAs, incipient rupture may be heralded by a ‘sentinel’ leak that is contained by
haematoma – this can be misdiagnosed as back strain or ureteric colic. Catastrophic rupture,
as in this case, presents with hypovolaemic shock and carries a dismal prognosis. The aorta is
retroperitoneal, so the pain may be felt in the back, flank and groins as well as the abdomen.
Aneurysmal change can occur in any vessel, including the iliac, femoral and popliteal arteries, albeit more rarely. More proximally, thoracic aortic aneurysms share a similar pathogenesis, but in the ascending aorta, a different form of degeneration known as cystic medial
necrosis is also described. Late stage syphilis and inherited collagen defects such as Marfan’s
syndrome are associated with thoracic aneurysms.
Aneurysms of a different pathogenesis can occur in the cerebral circulation, sometimes
called berry aneurysms due to their appearance, which, if they rupture, cause subarachnoid
haemorrhage. Coronary artery aneurysms occur in Kawasaki’s disease, a form of autoimmune vasculitis. The term aneurysm is also used to refer to the thinning and dilatation of the
heart wall following myocardial infarction.
The term false aneurysm is used to refer to contained collections of blood immediately
­outside a vessel, but where there is still a direct communication through a defect in the vessel wall. This usually occurs following trauma, commonly iatrogenic trauma caused during
arterial puncture required for percutaneous transarterial interventional procedures.
KEY POINTS

• An aneurysm is an abnormal permanent focal dilatation of all the layers of a blood
vessel.

• Some of the risk factors for aneurysm formation are male gender, smoking, hypertension and atherosclerosis.

• Rupture of a previously unsuspected aortic aneurysm is a life-threatening condition.

Case 38: Increased breathlessness and sudden death

CASE 38:

INCREASED BREATHLESSNESS AND SUDDEN DEATH

History
A woman finds her 68-year-old husband dead in his bed. During the last year of his life he
had slept on a bed in the downstairs living room, as he was unable to walk upstairs because
of extreme and worsening breathlessness. As his death is sudden and somewhat unexpected,
the General Practitioner discusses the case with the local coroner who decides that a postmortem examination is required.

Examination
At autopsy the most significant features on external examination are an abnormally shaped
chest with an increase in the anteroposterior diameter, and mild peripheral oedema. The
most significant abnormality on examination of the organs is seen in the lungs, which are
voluminous and meet in the anterior mediastinum, where they overlap the heart anteriorly. There are also large air-filled and intact bullae seen in subpleural positions and more
­strikingly at the apex. There is also mild thickening of the right ventricular heart muscle.

Questions
1. What is the most likely cause of death?
2. Describe the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition.
3. How may this condition lead to death?

111

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 38
The most likely cause of death is respiratory failure resulting from chronic obstructive
­pulmonary (or airway) disease (COPD). COPD refers to two separate disorders, chronic
bronchitis and emphysema, which commonly co-exist and are characterized by progressive
and irreversible damage to the lungs and airways that limits airflow to and from the lungs.
Cigarette smoking is, by far, the most common causative factor of COPD. COPD is a major
cause of morbidity and ranks in the ten most common causes of death worldwide. Although
there are typical clinical and radiological features of COPD, this diagnosis, in life, is made on
the basis of lung function tests (spirometry).
Emphysema is the result of chronic inflammation of the airways and lungs, with release
of inflammatory mediators resulting in destruction of alveolar walls. As a result of this the
alveolar surface area needed for gas exchange is reduced and there is loss of structural support for intrapulmonary airways which are then more likely to collapse and trap air within
the lungs. This chronic over-inflation of the lungs leads to the classic barrel-shaped enlargement of the chest (increased anteroposterior diameter). Typical clinical features of emphysema include progressive dyspnoea (usually a relatively late sign), coughing, wheezing and
weight loss. Patients typically show prolonged expiration due to entrapment of air, tend to sit
hunched forwards and breathe through pursed lips.
Depending on the predominant distribution of tissue damage, emphysema is classified as centriacinar, panacinar, paraseptal or irregular. In general, centriacinar emphysema is the result of cigarette smoking with reactive oxygen free radicals from cigarette smoke causing inactivation of
antiproteases. The resultant functional antiprotease deficiency is responsible for tissue damage.
A further cause of emphysema, more commonly with a panacinar distribution, is α-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic abnormality in which homozygous patients have a congenital
deficiency in α-1 antitrypsin and are therefore unable to counteract the destructive effects of
inflammatory mediators on lung tissue. These patients develop emphysema at an earlier age,
and may also develop chronic liver disease.
Chronic bronchitis is the result of chronic irritation of the airways caused by inhaled particles
in cigarette smoke, or, less commonly, dust from substances such as grain and cotton. Chronic
bronchitis presents with hypersecretion of mucus in the airways, a persistent cough and frequent infective exacerbations. Recurrent infections are a secondary rather than a causative
­feature of chronic bronchitis but are an important factor in the chronic nature of the illness.
Emphysema and long-standing severe chronic bronchitis may lead to respiratory failure or
cause pulmonary hypertension with the latter leading to increased strain on the right ventricle. This culminates in cor pulmonale (pure right-sided heart failure). Both conditions can
result in sudden death. Rupture of a bulla can result in pneumothorax, which may also result
in sudden death, especially in a patient with already compromised respiratory function.
KEY POINTS

• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) encompasses emphysema and
chronic bronchitis and is most commonly caused by cigarette smoking.

• The predominant abnormality in emphysema is destruction of alveolar walls

whereas chronic bronchitis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways.

• Complications of COPD include respiratory failure, cor pulmonale with right-sided
heart failure, and pneumothorax, all of which may result in sudden death.

Chest radiograph: moderate left pleural effusion with a bulky left hilum

Questions
1. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?
2. What is the importance of the raised serum calcium?
3. What investigative techniques may be employed in confirming the diagnosis?

113

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 39
This presentation is typical of lung cancer. The patient is a smoker presenting with worsening
cough and haemoptysis and while these features may be seen in non-neoplastic lung disease
such as COPD and TB, the rapid progression of symptoms is more likely to be associated
with malignancy. The findings on the chest radiograph further strengthen the diagnosis.
Loss of appetite and weight loss with associated anaemia are indicative of a wasting process,
although not specifically lung cancer.
The hypercalcaemia observed in this patient likely represents a paraneoplastic syndrome,
which results from ectopic hormone secretion by the tumour. Squamous cell carcinomas in
particular are associated with the production of PTH-related proteins, which are responsible for the hypercalcaemia. Other paraneoplastic syndromes seen with lung cancer include
Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which causes muscle weakness as a result of autoantibodies against calcium channels in neuromuscular junction. Peripheral neuropathy
and acanthosis nigricans may also be manifestations of lung carcinoma. Apical lung lesions
(Pancoast tumours) may invade the cervical sympathetic chain and produce Horner’s syndrome with enophthalmos, ptosis, miosis and anhidrosis.
The diagnosis of lung carcinoma may be made on clinical and radiological findings, but
­confirmation by examination of tumour tissue or cells is essential. This is because the treatment and prognosis is strongly linked to the histological type of lung carcinoma. Tumour
tissue may be obtained in the following ways:
• Bronchoscopic biopsy of the lung mass.
• Bronchoscopic brushing of the lung mass and/or saline washing (lavage) of the
bronchi and lung for deep-seated tumours. These may be done in combination with
biopsy to increase the chances of obtaining diagnostic material or as an alternative
to biopsy if the tumour is very vascular and therefore likely to bleed excessively.
• In patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, endobronchial ultrasound combined with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS TBNA) provides not only the
tissue diagnosis but also establishes the lymph nodal stage of the carcinoma. In
addition, the cells obtained from this procedure may be used for analysis of molecular markers such as EGFR, KRAS and ALK-1, which predict the responsiveness of
tumours to certain groups of chemotherapeutic agents. This allows the selection of
the most appropriate therapy for individual patients (targeted therapy).
• Cells may also be obtained from the pleural fluid for diagnosis, staging and molecular testing.
The commonest histological types of lung cancers are squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma. These may be present in variable proportions within the
same tumour. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are sometimes referred to as
non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) to distinguish them from small cell lung carcinoma
(SCLC), which is a form of neuroendocrine carcinoma and is responsive to a different group
of chemotherapeutic agents.
The strong association between smoking and lung carcinoma (SCLC and squamous cell
­carcinoma) is well proven. Adenocarcinoma is seen to arise in the vicinity of scars in the lung
secondary to infarcts and inflammatory conditions. While surgery may be effective for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, chemoradiotherapy is the treatment of choice for
small cell carcinoma (Figure 39.1).

KEY POINTS

• Lung carcinoma is a common form of carcinoma which should be readily suspected
from its clinical and radiological features.

• Advances in bronchoscopic techniques in obtaining tumour tissue have made
accurate diagnosis and staging easier.

• Histological typing and molecular analysis of the tumour are central to tailoring
the appropriate therapy for individual patients (personalized medicine).

CASE 40: A YOUNG MAN WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH
AND HAEMOPTYSIS

History
A 22-year-old man is brought into the Emergency Department complaining of a one-week
history of shortness of breath and one episode of haemoptysis. He does not report a fever or
any gastrointestinal symptoms. There is no family or medication history of note.

Examination
The patient is tachypnoeic (RR 28) with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. He is afebrile
and there is no cyanosis or jaundice. A further episode of haemoptysis is observed during
assessment.

Questions
1. What are the likely causes of this clinical presentation?
2. What is the best test to confirm the diagnosis?
3. What is the treatment for the underlying condition?

117

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 40
The above clinical presentation may be caused by an infection involving the lungs with
systemic spread. In the absence of fever or signs of infection other possibilities should be
considered but blood and urine cultures should always be performed to exclude sepsis. The
presence of tubular epithelial urinary casts is indicative of renal parenchymal damage and
in conjunction with the respiratory symptoms and radiographic findings, the possibility of
Goodpasture syndrome should be considered.
Goodpasture syndrome is an immunologically mediated disorder (type 2 hypersensitivity)
which affects the lungs and kidney. Antibodies are directed against native tissue antigens of
the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and lung alveolar septa, accounting for the renal
and pulmonary manifestations seen in the condition. It usually presents in young adults and
teenagers and may be triggered by a viral infection or exposure to chemicals (e.g. dry cleaning solvents). Smoking has been implicated as a co-factor and there is a genetic association
with the HL-DR2 subtype.
While testing for anti-GBM antibodies is required in the work-up for suspected Goodpasture
syndrome, the best investigation to confirm the diagnosis is a renal biopsy. This would
be expected to show focal proliferative glomerulonephritis in early cases, and crescentic
­glomerulonephritis in rapidly progressive cases. Linear deposits of immunoglobulins (IgG)
and complement (C3) would be seen along the GBM in the kidney and also in alveolar septa
in the lungs. The GBM antigen responsible is a component of the non-collagenous domain
(NC1) of the alpha-3 chain of collagen type 4.
There are other conditions that damage the glomerulus: those caused by an intrinsic tissue
antigen (Heymann nephritis) and those by planted antigens (drugs, infections). In Heymann
nephritis, the pattern of deposition of immune complexes in the glomerulus is granular and
interrupted in contrast to the linear pattern seen with Goodpasture syndrome.
The treatment for this condition is plasmapheresis, which clears anti-GBM antibodies and
other chemical mediators circulating in the blood. Immunosuppressive therapy limits further antibody production and prevents lung and renal bleeding. Some patients may require
dialysis or renal transplant if the kidney damage is severe. Goodpasture syndrome was a
rapidly fatal disease in the 1970s but prompt diagnosis and treatment has improved the prognosis in recent times.
KEY POINTS

• The Goodpasture syndrome involves a type 2 hypersensitivity reaction that results
in a combination of renal and pulmonary manifestations.

• The anti-GBM antibody results in rapid damage to the renal GBM and the lung
alveolar septa.

• Treatment involves plasmapheresis and immunosuppression without which the
disease may be fatal.

right arm and right leg.
INVESTIGATIONS

Questions
1. What is the diagnosis?
2. What treatment is most likely to have been given and why is the urgent CT scan
required?
3. What risk factors are associated with this condition?
4. What blood vessel and what territory of the brain are involved?

119

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 41
The likely diagnosis in this case is an ischaemic stroke. Stroke refers to an acquired focal
­neurological deficit caused by an acute vascular event. The neurological deficit persists
beyond 24 hours, in contrast to a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) where symptoms resolve
within 24 hours, although the distinction is now blurred with the advent of thrombolysis.
The term cerebrovascular accident is sometimes used synonymously with stroke, but many
dislike the connotations of inevitability it implies, given the treatable nature of the predisposing factors and, to an extent, the acute event itself.
Strokes are broadly categorized into ischaemic and haemorrhagic types, the majority being
ischaemic. The pathophysiology in a haemorrhagic stroke is rupture of a blood vessel causing extravasation of blood into the brain substance with tissue damage and disruption of
neuronal connections. The resulting haematoma also compresses surrounding normal tissue.
In most ischaemic strokes, there is thromboembolic occlusion of vessels due to underlying
atherosclerosis of the aortic arch and carotid arteries. In 15–20% of cases, there is atherosclerotic disease of smaller intrinsic blood vessels within the brain, most commonly the lenticulostriate arteries, occlusion of which result in so-called lacunar infarcts. A further 15–20%
are due to emboli from the heart.
Although ostensibly an anastomosing ring connecting the main blood vessels of the brain,
the circle of Willis has limited capacity to provide collateral blood supply in the event of
­sudden occlusion of one branch. At certain levels of ischaemia, neurons cease to function, but
remain viable and can recover with restoration of blood flow, which is the situation in a TIA.
The area at the periphery of an infarct (penumbra) is therefore potentially salvageable with
thrombolysis. In this case, thrombolytic therapy by means of tissue plasminogen activator
(t-PA) was given to the patient. A CT scan was required to exclude conditions such as haemorrhagic stroke or brain tumours, which are contra-indications to thrombolysis.
If the critical ischaemic threshold is crossed, irreversible neuronal damage occurs. Dead neurons release destructive cellular enzymes and excitatory neurotransmitters into the extracellular fluid, damaging neighbouring neurons and inciting the release of inflammatory mediators
from the surrounding microglia and astrocytes. Infarction and liquefactive necrosis ensues.
Where atherosclerosis is the main underlying pathological process, other non-modifiable
risk factors include age, gender, race and genetic factors. In contrast, modifiable risk factors
for atherosclerosis include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and smoking.
For embolic disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and endocarditis are known risk factors.
The blood supply to the brain can be divided into an anterior circulation, supplied by the
anterior and middle cerebral arteries (branches of the internal carotid artery), and a posterior
circulation, consisting of the posterior cerebral arteries, which are fed by the vertebrobasilar
arteries. The territory and the extent of the infarct influences the prognosis; here, expressive
dysphasia and right hemiparesis are attributable to infarcts in Broca’s area and the motor
cortex, both frontal lobe territories supplied by the left middle cerebral artery.
KEY POINTS

• Stroke refers to focal neurological deficit arising from an acute vascular event
which may be either ischaemic or haemorrhagic.

• Early thrombolysis has revolutionized the clinical management of stroke.
• The neurological deficit corresponds to the blood vessel involved and the territory
of the brain that it supplies so that accurate localization of the lesion is possible.

History
A 35-year-old female presents to her GP with increasing clumsiness and weakness in both
legs, having developed over a period of several weeks.

Examination
On examination, the GP notes mild stiffness and hyperreflexia and refers her to a neurologist
for further investigation.
When questioned in more detail by the neurologist, she recalls previous episodes of paraesthesia in her arms a few years previously as well as a separate incident of unilateral visual field
loss associated with eye pain. She did not seek medical attention on either occasion as the
paraesthesia was only a mild nuisance and she attributed the visual symptoms to irritation
from her contact lens.

MRI brain: lesions with high T2 signal intensity in the periventricular region

Questions
1. What is the likely diagnosis?
2. What is the commonest pattern of this disease?

121

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 42
The likely diagnosis is multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an immune-mediated d
­ emyelinating
disorder, the aetiology of which is unclear. Several weak genetic factors, mainly in the
genes regulating inflammatory mediators, are thought to interact with environmental factors. The idea of environmental influences is supported by observation that the incidence of
MS is greater at higher latitudes, with the place of childhood up to the age of 15 being key.
Influences such as vitamin D and various viruses have been implicated, but none of these
have been proven conclusively.
The name of the disease derives from the multiple inflammatory lesions seen histopathologically that eventually progress to sclerosis. These are typically located in the periventricular
areas and mainly, but not exclusively, affect white matter (myelin is macroscopically white).
However, the cerebellum, spinal cord and optic nerve can be affected too. Inflammation and
destruction of the myelin results in degeneration of the nerves associated with the myelin
covering. Neurological deficit occurs because neurons fail in the same way that the chewed
or broken insulation of a fine wire causes failure of the ability of the wire to transmit electrical signals.
Diagnosis, however, is rarely made on biopsy and is primarily based on clinical features with
radiological corroboration. The lesions and plaques enhance with MRI contrast ­(gadolinium-​
based compounds). Cerebrospinal fluid protein electrophoresis may show oligoclonal immunoglobulin G bands, a manifestation of the inflammation, but as lumbar puncture is an invasive
procedure, this investigation is increasingly reserved for cases where MRI is contraindicated or
where there is diagnostic doubt.
Classically, MS is described as having lesions separated in space and clinical attacks separated in time. These symptoms are myriad and include visual problems (optic neuritis), as
well as sensory and motor symptoms such as bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction. The
most common clinical pattern is the relapsing-remitting form, where there are episodes of
neurologic deficit with recovery or near resolution in between. The majority of patients with
this form develop progressive disease, usually after 10–15 years.
Other patterns include primary progressive MS (10% of cases). This pattern responds poorly to
immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments, where most therapeutic efforts have
been concentrated. The progressive-relapsing form accounts for 5% of cases, which resembles
primary progressive MS, but shows fluctuations superimposed on a progressive course.
KEY POINTS

• Multiple sclerosis (MS) typically presents as a remitting and relapsing neurological
disorder.

• The multifocal damage and partial regeneration of the myelin sheath of neurons
underlies the pathology of this condition.

• Clinical diagnosis is supported by radiological appearances of typical periventricular lesions and the CSF demonstrating oligoclonal IgG protein bands.

that he has become increasingly disorientated and forgetful, and is sometimes unable to
recall things such as the names of various members of his family. He has a history of bowel
cancer and is currently in remission.

Examination
Neurologic examination shows preservation of sensory and motor functions but reduced

INVESTIGATIONS
A CT scan is ordered, and shows evidence of cortical atrophy but no significant cerebral

Questions
1. What is the clinical diagnosis based on the above data?
2. Why are the clinical features not localized to well-defined areas of the brain?

123

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 43
The features described above are most suggestive of Alzheimer’s disease. This is c­ haracterized
by progressive deterioration of cognitive functions (dementia), which is beyond what is
expected as part of normal ageing. Alzheimer’s disease is the commonest dementia in all
age groups, but is usually seen over the age of 65 years. It can be diagnosed only when other
causes of cognitive decline are ruled out. Other causes of dementia include Pick’s disease,
vascular dementia, diffuse Lewy body disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and neurosyphilis.
Examination of the brain tissue is diagnostic but clinical and radiological features allow
accurate diagnosis in the vast majority of cases. For instance, Pick’s disease is characterized by an earlier age of presentation (40–60 years) and mainly with behavioural and speech
defects. It is associated with excessive deposition of one or two isoforms of tau proteins within
­ballooned cells (Pick cells) in the brain, typically in the frontal and parietal lobes. In contrast,
Alzheimer’s is characterized by a later age of presentation, mainly with memory loss, and
histologically by deposition of all six isoforms of tau proteins extensively across the brain.
Signs and symptoms of vascular dementia typically present following a stroke and then
show a ‘stepped’ pattern of progression. The single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) provide evidence of metabolic activity of
the brain and help in distinguishing vascular dementia from Alzheimer’s.
Lewy body disease overlaps between Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases due to loss of
cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons respectively. Visual hallucinations and rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep disorders are common. SPECT and PET are helpful investigations in
making a clinical diagnosis. Histologically, Lewy bodies are characterized by deposition of
alpha-synuclein throughout the brain.
Macroscopic examination of the brain in Alzheimer’s disease at autopsy shows a variable
degree of cortical atrophy with widening of sulci most pronounced in the frontal, temporal and
parietal lobes. There is secondary dilatation of the ventricles due to loss of parenchyma. The
main abnormalities include the presence of neurofibrillary tangles, senile (neuritic plaques)
and amyloid angiopathy. These may be present in smaller degrees in normal elderly people.
The neurofibrillary tangles represent the end stage of a number of degenerative processes and
are seen in other neurodegenerative disorders. The neuritic plaques are found in the superficial portions of cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellar cortex and may be centred on
blood vessels or clusters of neurons. Amyloid deposition is seen commonly in Alzheimer’s
disease and is composed of the same amyloid as that in the neuritic plaques. Granulovacuolar
degeneration occurs in abundance in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Hirano bodies are
found along the hippocampal pyramidal cells. The widespread distribution of the pathology
explains the overall deterioration rather than symptoms referable to a well-defined area of
the brain as seen with vascular disease.
KEY POINTS

• Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive
functions (dementia) beyond what is expected as part of normal ageing.

• Other causes of dementia include vascular dementia, Lewy body disease and
•

124

Pick’s disease which are distinguished by a constellation of signs and symptoms
and backed up by investigations such as SPECT and PET.
Characteristic pathological findings in Alzheimer’s disease include atrophy of brain
sulci, widening of gyri and histologically the presence of neurofibrillary ­tangles,
amyloid deposition and granulovacuolar degeneration.

of other medical illnesses or medications. The pain appears to be worsening and has been
associated with two days of nausea and vomiting. He describes the contents of his vomit as

INVESTIGATIONS

Questions
1. What is the likely diagnosis?
2. What are the aetiological factors associated with this?
3. What complications may occur with this condition?

125

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 44
The likely diagnosis is a bleeding peptic ulcer with resultant haematemesis and melaena.
The term peptic ulcer disease covers duodenal and gastric ulcer disease. Classically, gastric
ulcers are worse during meals as eating stimulates acid production, whereas duodenal ulcers
are worse after meals but in practice, history is unreliable in distinguishing the two.
The aetiologic factors underlying this condition can be thought of as those that increase acid
secretion and those that weaken the mucosal barrier. Acid hypersecretion can be caused by
hormone-secreting rarities such as systemic mastocytosis, which secretes histamine, or gastrinomas, which secrete gastrin. The latter, when located in the pancreas and associated with
peptic ulceration, is known as Zollinger–Ellison syndrome.
One should think of the gastric mucosa as a dynamic system which responds to injury and
possesses the ability to repair itself rather than as a passive barrier. Many of these functions
are mediated by autacoids, in particular prostaglandin E2. Glucocorticoids and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) both interfere with production of these protective prostaglandins, with NSAIDs responsible for 20–25% of peptic ulcers. Compromised mucosal
defences are also causative in ‘stress’ ulcers seen in trauma, burns and other severe illnesses.
Smoking and alcohol are recognized ‘softer’ risk factors.
By far the strongest aetiologic factor is Helicobacter pylori (HP), a bacillus that survives
the harshly acidic stomach environment by producing urease. This enzyme splits urea into
­carbon dioxide and ammonia, the latter of which neutralizes stomach acid. It also expresses
membrane proteins that mediate adhesion to gastric epithelial cells and other proteins that
aid evasion of the human immune response.
Asymptomatic carriage of HP is present in more than half of the general population. However,
only 15–20% of infected individuals develop symptomatic disease. HP causes acid hypersecretion and disruption of the gastric mucosa via cytotoxin production and the inflammatory
response it elicits. The resulting gastritis is manifest as acute inflammation (histologically,
neutrophils would be present) along with varying degrees of tissue damage.
Over a long period, chronic blood loss from erosive gastritis may result in anaemia. In contrast, larger ulcers may present as overt bleeding, as in this case. Upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy in this scenario is diagnostic and potentially therapeutic. Gastric biopsy may be
taken to determine HP status using a rapid urease test – if positive, HP should be e­ radicated
with a suitable combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitor (e.g. amoxicillin,
clarithromycin and omeprazole). Anatomically, bleeding ulcers are typically more posterior, whereas ulcers on the anterior surface ulcerate into the peritoneal cavity resulting in
perforation and peritonitis.
If HP persists, acute gastritis evolves into chronic gastritis with accompanying atrophy of the
gastric epithelium and intestinal metaplasia. Bacterial cytotoxins and oxidative stress from
ongoing inflammation increase the susceptibility of the gastric epithelium to dysplasia and
ultimately adenocarcinoma, a recognized long-term complication that has led to HP being
classified as a carcinogen (Figure 44.1).

KEY POINTS

• Peptic ulcers occur when there is either increased acid secretion or weakening of
the mucosal barrier.

• The aetiological agent for peptic ulceration is the bacterium H. pylori and treatment involves antibiotics to eradicate the infection.

• Long-standing chronic gastritis may be associated with atrophy, metaplasia and

History
A 58-year-old female, with treated hypertension as her only other medical history, p
­ resents
to her GP with constant right upper quadrant pain and nausea after a particularly rich
­celebratory meal. She describes previous similar episodes after meals, but she attributed these
to indigestion from over-eating. On questioning, she has not noticed skin or conjunctival
discoloration. The appearance of her urine and faeces is normal.

Examination
Abdominal examination is unremarkable.

2. What factors are associated with this condition?
3. What complications are associated with this condition?

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 45
The clinical history is typical of biliary colic, a common presentation of gallstones. Biliary
colic is usually experienced as epigastric (the gallbladder is a foregut structure) or right upper
quadrant pain, occurring shortly after protein- or fat-rich meals that stimulate gallbladder
emptying. The term ‘colic’ is a misnomer as the pain is often constant, caused by mechanical
impaction or distension of the gallbladder by gallstones (Figure 45.1). The explanation is that
the gallbladder does not contract in peristaltic waves; rather, each wave is several hours apart.
Nausea and vomiting may accompany the pain.
Bile is 80–85% water, 10% bile salts, with the remainder made up of mucus, pigments,
­inorganic salts, lipids and cholesterol. Bile is supersaturated with cholesterol, which is kept in
solution by the bile salts. Gallstones form when there is an imbalance in the constituents of
bile or bile stasis. About 80% of stones are mixed cholesterol/pigment stones, about 15% pure
cholesterol stones, and the remainder pigment stones.
The stereotypical profile of a gallstone patient is summed up by the 4Fs: female, fat, fertile
and forty. However, while gallstones are twice as common in females, increasing age is a
more important risk factor. Above the age of 60, 10–20% of the Western population have gallstones. Conditions that favour gallstone formation include haemolytic disorders (e.g. sickle
cell disease), pregnancy (progestagens are thought to reduce gallbladder emptying), parenteral nutrition (which abolishes regular emptying), rapid weight loss (which changes the relative proportions of cholesterol and pigment in bile) and loss of bile salts due to terminal ileitis
or ileal resection.
Most people with cholelithiasis are asymptomatic, but there is a 1–4% annual risk of developing symptoms or complications. Repeated episodes of biliary colic can result in inflammation
of the gallbladder, sometimes with bacterial infection. Such flare-ups are referred to as acute
cholecystitis, usually suggested by the presence of fever, systemic malaise, raised inflammatory
markers and peritoneal irritation. The latter is elicited by testing for Murphy’s sign, where a
hand is placed on the right subcostal area and the patient is asked to inspire. As the diaphragm

130

Case 45: Episodic right upper quadrant abdominal pain

descends, the liver and gallbladder impinge on the fingers of the examining hand. Murphy’s
sign is positive if there is sudden cessation of the inspiratory effort due to pain.
Complications depend on the size of the stones. Smaller stones may escape into the common
bile duct, but may lodge at the narrowing of the hepatopancreatic sphincter (sphincter of
Oddi), obstructing the common bile duct and pancreatic duct, leading to obstructive jaundice and pancreatitis respectively. Obstructive jaundice can also occur when a larger stone
within the gallbladder compresses the common bile duct indirectly, a condition known as
Mirizzi’s syndrome. Other rare complications include erosion of gallstones into the duodenum or stomach, effectively causing a fistula and gallstone ‘ileus’ where the escaped gallstone
obstructs the small bowel distally.
Once symptomatic, the definitive treatment of gallstone disease is generally surgical via
a cholecystectomy.
KEY POINTS

• Biliary colic is caused by mechanical impaction or distension of the gallbladder by
gallstones.

• Repeated episodes of biliary colic can result in inflammation of the gallbladder,
sometimes with bacterial infection (acute cholecystitis).

• Treatment of persistent symptoms is cholecystectomy.

Case 46: Chronic diarrhoea and flatulence

CASE 46:

CHRONIC DIARRHOEA AND FLATULENCE

History
A 25-year-old Irish woman is referred by her GP to the Gastroenterology clinic with a
three-month history of diarrhoea, accompanied by flatulence and weight loss. She reports
that her bowels open up to three times each day. She does not report any other symptoms,
and there is no history of foreign travel. She has a family history of Graves’ disease in
her brother.

Examination
Physical examination reveals a thin young woman with evidence of mild conjunctival pallor.
Abdominal examination is unremarkable.
INVESTIGATIONS
Baseline blood tests show a mild microcytic anaemia but nothing else of note. Serological
tests are requested and a biopsy is planned.

Questions
1. What serological investigations and biopsy are likely to be requested?
2. What is the underlying disorder and how is it managed?
3. What long-term risks are associated with this condition?

133

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 46
The clinical presentation of diarrhoea, flatulence and weight loss is fairly typical of coeliac
disease.
Coeliac disease results from sensitivity to gluten, the protein component (gliadin) of
grains such as wheat, oat, barley and rye. There is a strong association of coeliac disease
with certain HLA haplotypes. Deaminated gluten peptides bind strongly to HLA-DQ2
and DQ8, presenting an HLA-gluten peptide complex that activates CD4+ T cells which
produce inflammatory cytokines, including interferon gamma, which leads to flattening
of the intestinal mucosa. Indeed, association with these various HLA haplotypes is also
seen with other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid
disease. The positive autoimmune family history in this case therefore provides a clue to
the coeliac diagnosis.
The diagnosis of coeliac disease can be made in the following ways. First, the presence of
autoantibodies, namely anti-endomysial or anti-tissue-transglutaminase (TTG) ­antibodies,
favours the presence of coeliac disease. The gold standard, however, is a small intestinal
biopsy, typically of the duodenum or jejunum. This would be expected to show atrophy
and blunting of villi, accompanied by intraepithelial lymphocytosis. The changes are more
marked in the proximal small intestine as it is exposed to the highest concentration of gluten;
hence this is the preferred site for biopsy.
The small intestine is the site of absorption of various nutrients, and hence coeliac disease can
lead to malabsorption of these, leading to various deficiencies. Iron, vitamin B12 and folate
deficiencies may produce an anaemia, while calcium malabsorption leads to osteomalacia.
Lack of fat absorption causes steatorrhoea, and also interferes with the absorption of fatsoluble vitamins (A, D, E and K).
Clinical management includes withdrawal of gluten from the diet and demonstration of a
subsequent improvement in symptoms and histological findings. Indeed, this would prove
the diagnosis. Management of the various features of malabsorption (e.g. iron, vitamin and
folic acid deficiencies) may also be required.
With regard to the complications of coeliac disease, there is a small increase in the longterm risk of malignancies such as intestinal lymphomas (enteropathy-associated T-cell
­lymphoma – EATCL) and gastro-intestinal and breast carcinomas as well.
KEY POINTS

• Coeliac disease is caused by sensitivity to the gliadin component of gluten resulting in villous atrophy and blunting in the small intestine.

• The gold standard for diagnosis is jejunal biopsy. Anti-endomysial and anti-tissue
transglutaminase (TTG) are highly specific.

• Treatment involves lifelong abstinence from gluten, including barley (including
beer), oats, flour, wheat and rye.

Case 47: A young man with bloody diarrhoea

CASE 47:

A YOUNG MAN WITH BLOODY DIARRHOEA

History
A 22-year-old Caucasian male presents to his GP with bloody diarrhoea and mucus on and
off over the last few weeks. He does not report a fever or any history of recent foreign travel.
On direct questioning, he denies any extra-intestinal symptoms.

Examination
General and abdominal examination is unremarkable. Digital rectal examination is also
unremarkable.
INVESTIGATIONS
Baseline blood tests ordered by the GP show a mild normocytic anaemia. The patient is
referred for a fast-track colonoscopy, which shows moderate inflammation in the rectum
and sigmoid but the proximal large bowel appears normal. A biopsy series is taken from
rectum to terminal ileum. A stool sample is also sent for culture.

What are distinguishing pathological features of this condition?

135

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 47
Bloody diarrhoea may be caused by acute infections (viral, bacterial or protozoal). Noninfectious causes of haemorrhage into the large bowel include inflammatory bowel ­disease,
ischaemic bowel disease, diverticular disease, polyps, angiodysplasia, haemorrhoids or a
bleeding diathesis. The presentation of bloody diarrhoea intermittently over a period of weeks
and without any features of infection is suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Leftsided disease on colonoscopy with a sharp demarcation between inflamed and proximally
normal mucosa supports this and favours ulcerative colitis.
A history of extra-intestinal symptoms is important because ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s
disease, the other variant of IBD, may be associated with migrating polyarthritis, ankylosing
spondylitis and sacro-iliitis. Hepatic involvement by pericholangitis and primary sclerosing
cholangitis is seen more commonly in ulcerative colitis. Uveitis and renal obstruction due to
retroperitoneal fibrosis may also accompany IBD. Fat and vitamin malabsorption may ensue
with Crohn’s disease due to involvement of the terminal ileum, as this is where these nutrients are absorbed. IBD is an immunological disorder with established genetic associations
which are, however, different for the two clinical subtypes.
Ulcerative colitis involves the mucosa and submucosa of the rectum, and the inflammation
spreads proximally but is typically confined to the colon with occasional backwash ileitis. No
normal intervening areas remain. With regeneration of the mucosa, pseudopolypoid appearance develops. A diffuse chronic inflammatory infiltrate is present in the submucosa, and
crypt abscesses form as neutrophilic infiltration progresses. There is distortion of the crypt
architecture with mucosal ulceration and fibrosis (Figure 47.1).
Crohn’s disease is characterized by transmural inflammation of segments of the gastrointestinal tract (from the mouth to anus), accompanied by non-necrotising granulomata and
fissuring of the mucosa. The intervening segments of the GI tract are normal (skip lesions).
Early mucosal lesions (aphthous ulcers) coalesce to produce linear fissures in between surviving mucosa with a cobblestone appearance. The fissures may extend deeply into the bowel,
producing adhesions or even fistulae.
Crohn’s disease may be associated with perforation and strictures, while ulcerative colitis may
progress to involvement of deeper layers (muscularis propria and neural plexus) with resultant toxic megacolon and potential perforation. However, it is the development of dysplasia
and invasive malignancy that poses a long-term risk more so in patients with ulcerative colitis.
It is assumed that long-standing chronic inflammation is responsible for this increased risk.
This is supported by the fact that colon cancer risk increases with longer duration of colitis,
extent of colitis, the concomitant presence of other inflammatory manifestations such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, and the fact that certain drugs used to treat inflammation, such
as 5-aminosalicylates and steroids, may prevent the development of colorectal cancer.
The major carcinogenic pathways that lead to colorectal cancer, namely chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability, and hypermethylation, are seen in inflamed colonic mucosa.
Oxidative stress also plays a role as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species produced by inflammatory cells can interact with key genes involved in carcinogenic pathways such as p53 and
DNA mismatch repair gene.
The risk of carcinoma is 20–30 times higher in patients with pancolitis of more than 10 years’
duration compared to the normal population.

KEY POINTS

• Bloody diarrhoea may be caused by infectious agents (viral, bacterial or protozoal)
as well as non-infectious conditions (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease).

• Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are the two clinical types of inflammatory
bowel disease.

• Long-standing and extensive inflammatory bowel disease is associated with an
increased risk of dysplasia and carcinoma of the colon.

Case 48: Abdominal discomfort and generalized weakness

CASE 48: ABDOMINAL DISCOMFORT AND GENERALIZED
WEAKNESS

History
A 58-year-old man presents to his GP with a four-week history of generalized weakness and
malaise. He also complains of mild abdominal discomfort but cannot identify any change
in his bowel habit (he opens his bowels once a day) nor any blood in his stools. There is no
family history of note.

Examination
General examination reveals conjunctival pallor. His weight has reduced by 5 kg since it was
previously recorded on his last attendance two months ago. Abdominal examination is
­unremarkable. Digital rectal examination identifies soft stool, but no masses.
INVESTIGATIONS
Baseline blood tests show a mildly microcytic anaemia (Hb 11.5, MCV 78), but no other
abnormalities. As a faecal occult blood test is positive, the GP refers the patient for
­further investigations, which identify a polypoid mass in the caecum and a biopsy is taken.
The remaining large bowel appears normal.

Questions

4.

What is the likely nature of the polypoid mass and why?
What other findings may come to light at colonoscopy?
How do right-sided colonic tumours differ in their presentation from left-sided ones?
What factors determine the prognosis of patients with colon carcinoma?

139

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 48
The clinical history and examination point to a progressively worsening condition over a period
of a few weeks, which in the absence of features of chronic infection are suggestive of malignancy.
Occult blood in the faeces and anaemia is due to chronic blood loss from the polypoid tumour,
which tends to have a friable surface and bleed easily. The biopsy will confirm whether the polyp
shows epithelial dysplasia only or invasion into the deeper layers of the bowel wall. Histologically,
polypoid tumours may be adenomas with dysplasia which may be low grade or high grade. The
term adenocarcinoma is used when invasion is seen into the stalk of the polyp or deeper into the
bowel wall. Adenomas may show a tubular, villous or a combination of architecture. The larger
the adenoma and the more villous its architecture, the higher is the risk of adenocarcinoma.
Colonoscopy may detect synchronous tumours in other parts of the bowel or identify underlying conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease. Bowel cancer may arise in familial
syndromes such as polyposis coli in which the bowel is carpeted with polyps and in which
the risk of progressing to invasive malignancy is almost 100%. Long-standing inflammatory

140

Case 48: Abdominal discomfort and generalized weakness

bowel disease may also give rise to epithelial dysplasia and progression to malignancy.
Inflammatory bowel disease may be variably symptomatic but there is usually a suggestive
clinical history.
Right-sided tumours such as those in the caecum may grow into large polypoid masses due to
its large capacity. Those arising in the left-sided colon may give rise to fresh bleeding, mucus
in stools and rectal pain and therefore are more likely to present early.
The prognostic features in colon cancer include the grade or differentiation of the carcinoma,
as well as the pathological TNM stage (Figure 48.1), which includes the depth of invasion (T)
and assessment of metastasis to lymph nodes (N) and other organs (M). Grade 1 corresponds
to well-differentiated carcinoma and Grade 3 to poorly differentiated. The higher the grade the
worse the prognosis. The pathological stage can be fully assessed only after definitive surgery.
Both of these factors are addressed in the modified Dukes’ staging of colorectal carcinoma.
The presence of lymphovascular invasion and distant metastases are other important prognostic features.
The biopsy in this case demonstrated Grade 3 adenocarcinoma with invasion into the muscle
layer of the bowel wall, hence right hemicolectomy with lymphadenectomy would be the
treatment of choice.
KEY POINTS

• Anaemia associated with weight loss and positive faecal occult blood is highly
suggestive of bowel cancer.

• Right-sided tumours often present just with anaemia, whereas left-sided cancers
are more symptomatic.

• Worse prognosis is rendered by higher grade tumours (containing less-­differentiated
cells), lymph node involvement and distant metastasis.

143

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 49
This is alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis. Taking the history alone, differential diagnoses to
be considered include causes of foregut pain such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and, given
the deranged liver enzymes, gallstone disease and hepatitis.
Pancreatitis is typically diagnosed with a suitable history and a serum amylase of at least
3 times the upper limit of normal (a mild hyperamylasaemia may be seen in various intraabdominal pathologies). Lower levels may be consistent with a diagnosis of pancreatitis, as
levels decline after 2–3 days. The level of amylase does not correlate with severity of pancreatitis. Lipase is equally valid for diagnosis.
In most series, alcohol and gallstones each account for 30–35% of cases. In the in-patient setting,
pancreatitis occurs in about 10% of patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). A significant number of cases, as many as 10–20%, remain idiopathic,
although this may reflect the diminishing returns of exhaustive investigation once alcohol and
gallstones have been excluded. The remaining 1–2% are caused by hypercalcaemia, hyperlipidaemia, various drugs and toxins, trauma, hypothermia, mumps and autoimmune disease.
In the normal pancreas, self-digestion is prevented by several mechanisms: the enzymes are stored
as pro-enzymes, requiring activation by trypsin, itself a digestive enzyme, and the intra-cellular
pH and calcium concentration keep the enzymes inactive. Alcohol and several of the other causes
disrupt these mechanisms, resulting in premature activation and leakage of enzymes into the
parenchyma. In gallstone disease, small stones or biliary sludge block the ampulla, ­preventing
drainage of pancreatic secretions, forcing pancreatic secretions into the parenchyma.
Regardless of the initiating cause, there is inappropriate activation of enzymes within the
parenchyma that creates a cascade of further activation of more unreleased enzymes. The
damage caused can be extensive as the pancreas is a soft, fleshy organ (pan = all, creas = flesh).
The inevitable acute inflammation is usually mild and self-limiting, but in about 10% of cases,
it is sufficient to result in widespread systemic inflammation and cause compromise of various
organ systems. Circulatory collapse, renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome may
ensue. These severe cases of pancreatitis carry a mortality of up to 10% and should be identified early through a combination of clinical assessment, imaging and predictive physiological
scores (e.g. the modified Glasgow score) so they can be given the best supportive care.
Repeated episodes may result in chronic inflammation with destruction of the pancreas with
irreversible morphological changes. The early changes are mainly on a histological level (atrophy and fibrosis) but in later stages are detectable radiologically as calcification. Ultimately,
there is both endocrine and exocrine impairment, such that these patients require insulin
and enzyme supplementation with meals. With little residual exocrine pancreas remaining,
serum amylase is rarely raised in chronic pancreatitis.
KEY POINTS

• Pancreatitis can be diagnosed with severe epigastic pain and a markedly elevated
serum amylase or lipase.

• The most common causes of pancreatitis are excessive alcohol intake and gallstones.
• Activation of digestive pancreatic enzymes within the pancreatic parenchyma leads to
acute inflammation; chronic inflammation results in irreversible atrophy and fibrosis.

• Remember that pancreatitis displays a broad clinical spectrum from mild disease to

pancreatic necrosis that results in multi-organ failure and death. Never underestimate diseases of the pancreas.

Questions

2. Is the clinical condition reversible?
3. What other investigation should be performed to ascertain the diagnosis and how
do the findings correlate with clinical progress of the condition?

145

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 50
The clinical presentation is one of advanced liver damage. The presence of ascites and ­jaundice
in the absence of features of malignancy suggest alcoholic liver disease (ALD) as the likely
cause. A history of alcohol excess often has to be elicited through direct questioning as the
patient will not always be forthcoming with this information.
ALD is associated with fatty infiltration into hepatocytes initially in a centrilobular location.
The liver is enlarged, tender and palpable per abdomen at this stage. These fatty changes are
reversible in the early stages of disease if alcohol use is discontinued.
The next step of the disease process is alcoholic hepatitis. This is characterized biochemically
by an aspartate aminotransferase:alanine aminotransferase (AST:ALT) ratio of more than
1.5, and pathologically by necrotic hepatocytes and cytoplasmic accumulation of cytoskeletal
material (Mallory bodies). Some fibrosis commences around the sinusoids and venules.
With continued alcohol-related damage, cirrhosis develops which is irreversible. Cirrhosis
may be defined as organ-wide fibrosis with intervening regenerating nodules of liver tissue.
Pathologically this is characterized by a shrunken, misshapen, sclerosed liver that contains
micronodules that make the surface rough. This shrinkage means that the liver may no longer
be palpable. Accompanied clinical findings include portal hypertension as a result of regenerating hepatic nodules distorting blood flow in the hepatic parenchyma. This manifests as
ascites and opening of collateral blood vessels by portal-systemic blood flow. Manifestations
of the latter include prominent veins around the umbilicus (caput medusae), oesophageal
varices and life-threatening haematemesis and haemorrhoids with bleeding per rectum.
Liver damage also interferes with synthesis of blood-clotting factors, which may result in a
bleeding diathesis.
Once the ascites has been reduced by paracentesis, a liver biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis. It would also exclude other contributory metabolic disorders
such as Wilson’s disease and haemochromatosis.
The fibrosis of blood vessels in the portal and intestinal circulation in the liver results in
portal hypertension. The raised haemodynamic pressure within this circulation leads to the
outflow of a transudate into the peritoneal cavity. It is also promoted by hypoalbuminaemia,
filtration of lymph into the peritoneal cavity, and sodium and water retention (secondary
hyperaldosteronism). Long-standing portal congestion can lead to splenomegaly.
Metabolic disturbances such as hyperammonaemia result in abnormal neurotransmission
in the central nervous system and neuromuscular systems (encephalopathy). This is usually
seen in advanced stages of hepatic failure. The hepatorenal syndrome may also develop and is
associated with signs of renal failure that typically reverses with improvement in liver function. Long-term survivors of cirrhosis face an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
KEY POINTS

• ALD and alcoholic hepatitis are reversible processes that involve centrilobular
fatty infiltration.

• Continued alcohol abuse results in irreversible cirrhosis which is characterized by
fibrosis and a shrunken liver.

• Portal hypertension causes ascites due to outflow of transudate into the peritoneal
cavity. Portosystemic anastomoses may subsequently form, leading to bleeding
oesophageal varices and haemorrhoids.

CASE 51:

DELAYED PASSAGE OF MECONIUM IN A NEWBORN

delayed passage of meconium.

2. What is the pathologic basis of the clinical features in this condition?
3. How is this condition managed clinically?

147

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 51
The clinical picture of delayed passage of meconium in a newborn suggests cystic fibrosis as
the most likely diagnosis.
Cystic fibrosis is the commonest lethal genetic disease affecting the Caucasian population,
with an incidence of around 1 in 3000 births. The underlying abnormality is in the regulation of epithelial chloride transport which results in increased reabsorption of sodium and
water from the lumina of various organs, resulting in dehydration of secretions within the
lumen (mucoviscidosis). This defect is caused by abnormal function of the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator) gene on chromosome 7, which encodes an epithelial chloride
channel. The commonest mutation (responsible for 70% of cases) involves deletion of phenylalanine in the 508th amino acid position (ΔF508).
The epithelial defects are manifest in exocrine glands and the linings of the respiratory,
alimentary and reproductive tracts. In the sweat ducts, there is decreased reabsorption of
sodium chloride, manifested by a very salty sweat. There is thickening of mucus within the
bronchial tree, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, epididymis and vasa deferentia. Blockage of
the respiratory tract with stagnant viscid secretions predisposes to recurrent infections and
bronchiectasis. The presenting complaint of meconium ileus in this case is related to the thick
secretions plugging the gastrointestinal tract. Pancreatic insufficiency results from reduction
of the outflow of enzymes, leading to fat malabsorption and steatorrhoea, and consequently,
growth and development of an affected child is poor. In adulthood, infertility is common due
to thickened secretions in the epididymis and vas impairing spermatogenesis.
The best investigation is genetic analysis for abnormalities of chromosome 7 (band q31-32).
Analysis of sweat for high sodium chloride content and a blood test for immunoreactive trypsinogen are other investigations employed in the diagnosis of this condition. A chest x-ray
would show the extent of the chest infection in this patient.
Clinical management is centred on the organs and systems affected by cystic fibrosis.
Maintenance of adequate hydration is important, and recurrent chest infections are common and need to be managed with appropriate antibiotic therapy; sufferers are particularly
predisposed to developing Pseudomonas infections and often require prolonged antibiotic
courses. Lung and other organ transplantation are options in advanced cases.
As this is an autosomal recessive disorder, the condition is inherited if both parents contribute a defective allele. Prenatal screening can predict the likelihood of the foetus being born
with cystic fibrosis and improves the chances of being appropriately clinically managed from
birth. Cloning of the cystic fibrosis gene raises hope for in vivo gene therapy.
KEY POINTS

• Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with multi-organ involvement.
• The defect lies in trans-membrane chloride transport resulting in accumulation of

dehydrated thick secretions in the lungs, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract and other
organs.
Patients suffer from general poor health with recurrent chest infections and pancreatic insufficiency being the most debilitating symptoms.

Case 52: Back pain and fever in a diabetic

CASE 52:

BACK PAIN AND FEVER IN A DIABETIC

History
A 58-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with a three-day history of
increasing back pain and fevers. The patient is a type 2 diabetic on oral hypoglycaemic agents
and suffers from mild hypertension. There is no history of burning micturition or colicky
abdominal pain. There is no history of chronic analgesic ingestion.

Examination
The patient is febrile (37.9°C) and appears unwell. There is tenderness over the left loin. There
is no anterior abdominal tenderness.
INVESTIGATIONS
Examination of the urine shows presence of leucocytic and granular casts. Urine culture is
requested. Haematological investigations reveal a mild normocytic normochromic a
­ naemia.
Serum creatinine and urea are normal.
An ultrasound of the abdomen is requested and shows atrophic, cystic kidneys with
dilated pelvicalyceal systems. The gall bladder, liver and spleen are normal.

Questions
1. What is the likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?
2. What is the significance of casts on examination of the urinary sediment?
3. How do the ultrasound findings reflect the underlying pathology?

149

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 52
These features are most likely due to an episode of acute pyelonephritis. The patient is ­diabetic
and therefore is predisposed to urinary tract infection and the symptoms point to an upper
tract rather than lower urinary tract infection.
The presence of casts indicates renal parenchymal pathology. Casts may be of different types
and leucocytic casts are indicative of an infective renal parenchymal episode. Renal tubular
casts are associated with some types of glomerulonephritis such as SLE, while red blood
cell casts are seen in acute renal failure. Granular casts are seen in advanced forms of renal
parenchymal pathology (i.e. chronic pyelonephritis). The co-existence of acute symptoms on
a background of chronic disease (NIDDM) suggests acute and chronic pyelonephritis.
The ultrasound appearances closely reflect the underlying pathology. Chronic pyelonephritis
is accompanied by damage to the renal parenchyma with resulting atrophy and scarring
(Figure 52.1). Obstruction perpetuates the renal damage, predisposes to infection and also
results in dilatation of the pelvicalyceal systems proximal to the obstruction.
Chronic pyelonephritis may be associated with obstruction to the lower tract (posterior
­urethral valves) or with ureteric calculi. It may also be due to reflux nephropathy, p
­ articularly
in children. The kidneys are typically coarsely scarred, and if bilateral the involvement is
asymmetric. In chronic glomerulonephritis, on the other hand, renal scarring is symmetric.
The coarse scarring in pyelonephritis leaves the calyces blunted and dilated, most marked at
the poles where reflux is most pronounced.
Histologically, the tubules would show atrophy and dilatation and their lumina would
be filled with eosinophilic casts, imparting a thyroid-like appearance to the renal parenchyma. Loss of tubular concentrating function gives rise to polyuria and nocturia. There
is chronic inflammation in the interstitium. In the presence of acute infection, leucocyte

casts may be seen in the tubules. Long-standing chronic pyelonephritis may be a­ ssociated
with hypertension due to hyaline arteriosclerosis of the renal interstitial blood vessels.
Changes attributable to ­d iabetes may also be seen if this was a predisposing condition.
Patients with chronic pyelonephritis and reflux nephropathy may also show focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
Acute episodes of infection complicate chronic pyelonephritis with the appearance of fever
and systemic symptoms. If uncontrolled, this may result in septicaemia and shock, especially
in the presence of diabetes or unrelieved obstruction. Hence, prompt recognition and clinical
management of the condition is essential.
KEY POINTS

• Acute pyelonephritis is characterized by fever and loin pain and individuals with
compromised immunity are predisposed to this condition.

• Urine examination including microbiological culture is helpful in making the
diagnosis.

• Chronic pyelonephritis has a very characteristic appearance of asymmetrically
contracted, coarsely scarred kidneys.

Case 53: Urinary problems in an elderly man

CASE 53:

URINARY PROBLEMS IN AN ELDERLY MAN

History
A 70-year-old man presents to his GP for a check-up. On direct questioning he admits to
increasingly frequent urination, also at night, and difficulty starting to urinate. He denies
any pain at urination and has not noticed blood in his urine. He has no significant previous
medical history.

Examination
The GP requests a blood test for prostate specific antigen (PSA) and performs a digital rectal
examination (DRE), which reveals firmness in one lobe of the prostate. The PSA result is
received several days later and is increased at 8 ng/mL. The patient is referred to a urology
clinic, where transrectal prostate biopsies are performed and sent for histological examination.

Questions
1. What are the features on biopsy that would suggest a prostate cancer, and how may
these changes be graded?
2. Discuss the aetiologic factors underlying prostate cancer?
3. What are the treatment options if this gentleman is found to have prostate cancer?

153

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 53
Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a product of prostatic epithelium and as such is specific to
the prostate, which allows a PSA level to be used as a screening test for unsuspected prostate
cancer in asymptomatic men. Many laboratories consider a level of 4 ng/mL as the upper limit
of normal, but practice varies. As there is considerable overlap in PSA levels associated with
cancer and benign conditions and because neither DRE nor most imaging modalities used
to visualize the prostate (transrectal ultrasound and MRI) are sensitive or specific enough,
transrectal or transperineal core biopsies of the prostate are required to confirm the diagnosis.
Microscopic examination of the prostate biopsies in this man showed prostatic carcinoma.
The volume (length or percentage of tumour per biopsy) and degree of tumour differentiation
are also determined microscopically. Gleason patterns are graded from 1 to 5, with patterns
1 and 2 rarely encountered. Pattern 3 is the commonest (well differentiated), followed by pattern 4 (moderately differentiated) and pattern 5 (poorly differentiated). The Gleason score
is the sum of the two most prevalent and/or most aggressive growth patterns seen in the
tumour. Cancer diagnosed on needle biopsies typically is assigned a Gleason score between
6 (least aggressive) and 10 (most aggressive). For example, a tumour showing a predominant
pattern 3 and some pattern 4 would be recorded as Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7. A tumour with
a predominant pattern 3 and some patterns 4 and 5 would be recorded as Gleason score
3 + 5 = 8 to include the worst area of the tumour in the score.
Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer of men and is typically slow growing, with many men
remaining asymptomatic and eventually dying of unrelated conditions. A minority of prostate
cancers are aggressive and may spread to bone, especially the lumbar vertebrae, or lymph nodes.
The aetiology of prostate cancer is not well understood but several risk factors such as increased
age, family history and diet are suspected. Prostate cancer is androgen-dependent, and antiandrogen agents or even oestrogens may be used for treating advanced prostate cancer.
Management options for prostate cancer include active surveillance, surgery, radiotherapy or
hormonal therapy. Cancer that is considered to be low risk (low Gleason score, low volume
and confined to the prostate) can in many cases be safely managed through active surveillance. This typically consists of annual PSA tests and future re-biopsy or earlier re-biopsy if
the PSA level increases rapidly.
Surgery is usually recommended to those men where the expected benefit of prostatectomy
outweighs the risk of side effects such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence.
Modern surgical techniques have limited the extent of such adverse effects, and in younger
men with higher-risk cancer (larger volume or high Gleason score) that is confined to the
prostate, prostatectomy tends to be the best option. Radiotherapy or hormonal treatment is
most often used in cases of advanced cancer or those cases where tumour recurs following
potentially curative surgical treatment.
KEY POINTS

• Although an elevated PSA and abnormal digital rectal examination may suggest

•

154

prostate cancer, histological examination of a prostate biopsy is required for confirmation of the diagnosis and determination of important factors which will affect
prognosis and management decisions.
Depending on the grade and stage of prostate cancer, management options
range from active surveillance to surgery, radiotherapy and hormonal treatment.

Case 54: A young man with a testicular lump

CASE 54:

A YOUNG MAN WITH A TESTICULAR LUMP

History
A 25-year-old man presents to the urology clinic with a nodule palpable in the left testis on
self-examination. There is a history of groin injury during a game of rugby three weeks ago;
however the nodule is not painful.

Examination
A 1.5 cm firm nodule is palpable at the lower pole of the left testis. There is no transilluminance and the penis and scrotum are normal. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy.
INVESTIGATIONS
An ultrasound examination of the left testis demonstrates the lesion to be solid and
with poorly defined margins. The right testis is normal and there is no abdominal lymphadenopathy. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is moderately elevated while alpha-­
fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are normal.

Questions
1. What is the differential diagnosis in this case?
2. What is the value of serum markers in the clinical management of this condition?
3. What pathological features are important in predicting the clinical outcome?

155

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 54
A testicular nodule may represent a tumour, a cyst, a loculated hydrocele or an inflammatory condition. A solid nodule with ill-defined borders on imaging is likely to be a malignant tumour, while that with a sharp circumscription is more likely to be benign; however,
there are many exceptions to this rule. Cysts may also arise in the testis but more commonly
in its vestigial remnants (appendix of testis and appendix of epididymis) and are benign
although they may enlarge and undergo torsion. Loculated hydrocele may develop secondary to trauma or inflammatory conditions. Fluid collections around the testis may be fluctuant and transilluminant on physical examination and an ultrasound will confirm the fluid
contents. Inflammatory conditions such as epididymo-orchitis (mumps, tuberculosis) are
accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and a painful testicular mass. Syphilitic
gumma may be painless, indicating burnt-out disease ­(tertiary syphilis).
Serum tumour markers play an important role in the diagnosis, staging, risk stratification
and post-treatment monitoring of testicular cancer. On the other hand, serum markers are
normal in testicular cysts and benign tumours such as Leydig cell adenoma.
Serum LDH is elevated in seminoma but it is a relatively non-specific marker as LDH is
secreted by a number of other organs such as the liver. Serum AFP is elevated in yolk sac
tumours while hCG is produced in large quantities in a choriocarcinoma. Monitoring serum
tumour marker levels after removal of the tumour is useful as this would be accompanied
by a steep decline in its serum levels, which may progressively rise again if there is tumour
recurrence. Testicular tumours frequently occur in mixed forms so that one or more of these
serum markers may be elevated.
Pathological examination of the testis following orchidectomy plays a key role in ­predicting
clinical outcome (Figure 54.1). Malignant tumours (95%) are much more common than benign
tumours. Broadly speaking, these are germ cell tumours and are subdivided into seminoma
and non-seminomatous histological types. Seminoma is the commonest subtype (80%) while
embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumour and choriocarcinoma are collectively referred to as

Figure 54.1 Testis bisected to reveal a central lobulated, pale tumour.
156

Case 54: A young man with a testicular lump

non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT). Teratomas are another interesting subtype
of testicular cancer characterized by presence of somatic (epithelial and connective tissue)
elements. NSGCT may transform into the less aggressive teratoma following good response
to chemotherapy.
Other adverse pathological features that influence clinical outcome include lymphovascular
invasion, and invasion of the rete testis, spermatic cord, peritoneal covering (tunica vaginalis) and scrotal skin. Ultrasound and CT scan are important in identifying metastases to
lymph nodes and other organs such as lungs, liver and bones.
Treatment of seminoma in the absence of the above adverse features is orchidectomy, which is
curative in 80–85% cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy is required if adverse features are present
or for NSGCT with markedly elevated serum tumour markers.
It is also important to remember that germ cell tumours may arise in an extra-testicular location anywhere along the midline from the base of the skull to the sacrococcygeal tip.
KEY POINTS

• Testicular tumours are usually malignant and the commonest type is seminoma.
• Tumour markers and pathological features define the clinical outcome with a good
chance of cure (80–85%) if these are favourable.

• Unfavourable histology and elevated tumour markers usually require adjuvant
chemotherapy after orchidectomy.

Case 55: Heavy and painful menstrual bleeding

CASE 55:

HEAVY AND PAINFUL MENSTRUAL BLEEDING

History
A 40-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of increasingly heavy and painful
menstrual bleeding. She denies any significant medical history and is taking no regular
medication.

Examination
On examination the patient looks well. She has a body mass index of 28, and no abnormality
is found on abdominal examination.
INVESTIGATIONS

of which measures 8 cm in diameter

Questions
1. What is the likely diagnosis?
2. The patient asks what the diagnosis means and what the treatment options are.
How will you explain this to her?

159

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 55
This patient has uterine fibroids, also known as leiomyomas (Figure 55.1). These are benign
tumours of the muscle of the uterus (myometrium). Whereas fibroids are the most common
benign tumours of the female genital tract (and of women in general), malignant tumours
of the myometrium are rare and are called leiomyosarcomas. Fibroids typically present
during the reproductive years and most are asymptomatic. Others, depending on their
size and location, may present with abdominal distension, abnormal menstrual bleeding
(which in turn may lead to iron deficiency anaemia), urinary frequency, pain ­during ­sexual
­intercourse or (rarely) infertility, which is associated more often with fibroids located
immediately underneath the lining of the womb (endometrium). Malignant transformation is exceedingly rare and most leiomyosarcomas are thought to arise de novo and not
from leiomyomas.

Figure 55.1 Uterus including cervix with three intramural and a pedunculated subserosal
fibroid (lower left). All fibroids show the typical white whorled cut surface. The endometrial
cavity is located centrally.
160

Case 55: Heavy and painful menstrual bleeding

Fibroids may be single or multiple and located anywhere within the uterus (subserosal,
intramural or submucosal), including the cervix, and can also be found in the uterine broad
ligament. Although larger fibroids may be diagnosed by bimanual pelvic examination, the
diagnosis is usually made through gynaecological ultrasound examination. Fibroids may also
be diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but neither imaging modality reliably distinguishes fibroids from their rare malignant counterpart. Larger fibroids may show
changes such as infarction or haemorrhage which makes this distinction more difficult.
Fibroids are monoclonal benign tumours, with nearly half of fibroids having a simple
­chromosomal abnormality. The aetiology is poorly understood but factors that play a role in
the development and growth of fibroids include a genetic predisposition, growth factors and
the effects and interplay of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Known risk factors
include obesity, diabetes, hypertension, African descent and polycystic ovary syndrome.
Fibroids tend to shrink after menopause when levels of oestrogen decrease. Therefore, it is
typically only symptomatic fibroids in women in their reproductive years which require treatment. The treatment options may be medical (with drugs aimed at shrinking fibroids or controlling symptoms) or surgical (uterine artery embolisation, myomectomy or hysterectomy).
All fibroids need to be submitted for histological examination to exclude malignant change.
Fibroids typically have a white or cream-coloured whorled cut surface and shell out with
ease from the surrounding myometrium. Microscopically they consist of uniform smooth
­muscle cells arranged in bundles, with cigar shaped nuclei and slender cytoplasmic processes. The presence of significant nuclear atypia, necrosis and prominent mitotic activity
will alert the pathologist that the fibroid may not be a leiomyoma but its malignant counterpart, a leiomyosarcoma.
KEY POINTS

• Fibroids (uterine leiomyomas) are the most common benign tumours of women
•
•

and may present with vague abdominal symptoms, heavy menstrual bleeding,
­urinary symptoms or are commonly asymptomatic.
Diagnosis is made by abdominal or bimanual pelvic examination or gynaecological ultrasonography.
Management options depend on patient choice and size and location of fibroids,
and may include medical, interventional radiological or surgical treatment.

161

Case 56: Abnormal vaginal bleeding

CASE 56:

ABNORMAL VAGINAL BLEEDING

History
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of post-coital vaginal bleeding and a
vaginal discharge. She has no other medical history and has never had a cervical smear. She
cohabits with a male partner and has no children.

Examination
General examination is within normal limits. The patient is referred for a cervical smear
test, and on receipt of an abnormal result ten days later an urgent referral to the colposcopy
service at her local hospital is made.
Colposcopic examination shows a firm mass distorting the cervix. Directed biopsies are
obtained from the mass and submitted for pathological examination.
INVESTIGATIONS
Cytological examination of the exfoliated superficial cervical epithelial cells sampled in
the smear test shows severe squamous dyskaryosis and koilocytosis. The subsequent
biopsy is reported as showing “invasive squamous cell carcinoma with associated CIN 3”.

Questions

4.

What is the diagnosis?
What is the role of cervical screening?
How does this condition typically present?
What treatment options are available?

163

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 56
The patient has cervical cancer. The most common type of cervical cancer is squamous cell
carcinoma (approximately 85% of cervical cancers), with the rest being adenocarcinomas or
adenosquamous carcinomas.
The vast majority of both squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the cervix are
preceded by a precancerous lesion, known as CIN (cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia) or
CGIN (cervical glandular intra-epithelial neoplasia) respectively. These precancerous lesions
can be detected on smear tests of the cervix, commonly known as a Pap (Papanicolaou)
smear, which is now being replaced by an improved method known as liquid-based cytology. As these precancerous lesions may exist in the non-invasive stage for many years, its
timely diagnosis allows treatment to prevent progression to invasive carcinoma (although
such ­progression is not invariably the case for all precancerous lesions).
Squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix may occur at any age from the late teens to old age
but is most common between the ages of 40 and 45, and approximately 10 years later than the
peak incidence for high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia.
The NHS cervical screening programme, which screens the highest risk age group (25–49
years) every 3 years, and those aged 50–64 every 5 years, has been highly successful as
­evidenced by the marked decline in deaths from cervical cancer.
In almost all cases of cervical cancer, infection by human papilloma virus (HPV) is a
­necessary factor. This is a large group of viruses with several low-risk and high-risk types
identified. Vaccines have been developed against two of the most important high-risk
types (types 16 and 18) and HPV vaccination is currently being offered to certain groups
of women and to girls aged 12–13 years. Smoking is a much less common risk factor for
the development of cervical cancer and the incidence of cervical cancer is higher in women
with HIV disease.
The most common presenting symptoms of cervical cancer are abnormal vaginal bleeding or
a vaginal discharge but many cases are asymptomatic even at an advanced stage. Cervical precancers are most commonly asymptomatic, further demonstrating the importance of screening.
Treatment for precancerous lesions of the cervix, depending on the grade of abnormality, is
typically local excision of the transformation zone of the cervix, known as a LLETZ, with
more frequent follow-up by cervical smear following such treatment.
Treatment for invasive cervical carcinoma usually includes surgery (e.g. trachelectomy, in
which the uterus and ovaries are not removed, in order to preserve fertility, or hysterectomy)
and in more advanced stages radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.
KEY POINTS

• Cervical smear tests are an effective method of detecting the vast majority of
­cervical precancerous lesions so that preventative treatment can be offered.

• Cervical cancer is often asymptomatic, even in advanced stages, or may present
with abnormal vaginal bleeding or a vaginal discharge.

• High-grade precancerous lesions and early stage invasive cancers are typically
treated with surgical procedures in which fertility is retained.

Case 57: A lump in the breast

CASE 57:

A LUMP IN THE BREAST

History
A 33-year-old woman presents with a lump in her right breast that has been present for two
weeks. It was detected on self-examination and has continued to enlarge. There is a history of
ovarian cancer (mother) but not breast cancer in her family.

Examination
A 2.5-cm diameter lump is found in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, which
is hard and irregular but not fixed to the skin or to deeper tissue. There is also a palpable
1-cm lymph node in the right axilla. Examination of the contralateral breast and axilla is
unremarkable.
INVESTIGATIONS
Ultrasound: suspicious lump in right breast; axillary lymph node of normal echogenicity
with a prominent vascular hilum.
A core biopsy of the breast lump and fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the right axillary
lymph node are performed.

Questions
1. Is the history of ovarian cancer relevant in this patient?
2. Why is a core biopsy of the breast lump performed, and FNA of the axillary lymph
node?
3. What clinically useful information is provided by the tissue samples above?

165

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 57
The clinical and radiological features in this patient are suspicious of breast cancer. Breast
cancer affects 1 in 8 women (lifetime risk) in the UK. Screening for breast cancer by mammography or ultrasound begins at age 50 years in the UK but 10 years earlier if there is a family history of breast (or ovarian) cancer. However, some patients may present with a tumour
at an earlier age. Younger women tend to have ultrasound assessment as they have more glandular tissue whereas in older women the breast undergoes fatty replacement, which makes
them less dense and more amenable to mammographic assessment. Mammography will
typically show a spiculated mass in breast cancer. However it should be noted that mammography could miss palpable breast lumps and non-calcified lesions especially in the radiodense
breasts of premenopausal women. Between 10 and 40% of women who are found to have a
mass by mammography will have breast cancer.
Core biopsy is the standard method of sampling a suspicious breast lump. This allows assessment of both invasive and in situ carcinoma; the latter is not reliably predicted by fine needle
aspiration (FNA) and thus core biopsy is important in clinical decision-making. However,
FNA is preferred for targeting axillary nodes as it is easier to direct a fine needle deep in the
axilla under ultrasound guidance. It is less traumatic and poses a lower risk of accidentally
puncturing deeper structures, including blood vessels and the pleura, compared to the larger
core biopsy needle.
Core biopsy provides histological confirmation of whether the carcinoma has invaded the
basement membrane and what subtype it is – ductal, lobular or mucinous. Invasive ­ductal
carcinoma is the commonest subtype of breast cancer, accounting for around 75% of all breast
cancer. It commonly metastasizes to the axillary nodes, and is associated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Invasive lobular carcinoma shows a diffuse distribution in the breast,
hence is more likely to be multifocal and bilateral.
Nuclear grading (1–3) of the tumour is also a prognostic marker, with higher grades of carcinoma being associated with a more aggressive clinical course. Tissue sampling also allows
assessment of oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression by the tumour cells. Expression
of these steroid receptors makes the tumour susceptible to hormone (anti-oestrogen) therapy
and is associated with a better outcome compared to tumours that do not express these markers. Expression of c-erbB2 (Her2/neu) is also associated with better outcome and amenability to specific types of therapy in selected cases. The presence of lymphovascular invasion
indicates the likelihood of spread of tumour cells beyond the breast, thereby conferring a
poorer outlook. Without lymph node involvement, the 10-year disease-free survival is close
to 70–80% but falls progressively with the number of involved nodes.
Clinical management of breast cancer includes using combinations of surgery, radiotherapy,
hormonal therapy and systemic chemotherapy. In spite of good local control of disease, local
and distant recurrences remain a problem in breast cancer as tumour cells are believed to
spread systemically early in the course of the disease.
KEY POINTS

• Breast carcinoma affects 1 in 8 women and a screening programme is available in
the UK.

• Diagnosis relies on triple assessment by physical examination, radiology, and biopsy.
• Despite advances in clinical management, local and distant recurrences remain a
significant challenge.

Case 58: Lymph node enlargement in a young man

CASE 58:

LYMPH NODE ENLARGEMENT IN A YOUNG MAN

History
A 26-year-old Afro-Caribbean man is referred to the ENT clinic with progressively enlarging bilateral neck lumps. There is a history of mild, non-productive cough off and on but no
fever or weight loss.

Examination
Examination of the neck reveals cervical lymphadenopathy with discrete, firm, non-tender
nodes. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy in the axillae or groins. There is no clinical
evidence of ear, nose or throat infection.
INVESTIGATIONS
Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the largest lymph node: groups of epithelioid cells in a
reactive lymphoid background, with no evidence of necrosis or malignant cells.

Questions
1. What is the clinical differential diagnosis in this case?
2. What clinically useful information is available from the FNA?
3. What further investigations should be performed to confirm the diagnosis?

167

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 58
The clinical differential diagnosis in this case includes tuberculosis (TB), sarcoidosis and
Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Systemic symptoms such as fever and night sweats are seen in TB and
lymphoma but are not reported by the patient. In TB, the lymph nodes are typically matted
while in Hodgkin’s lymphoma these are rubbery and involve contiguous groups of nodes.
Hence, the clinical history and investigation favours sarcoidosis by exclusion but diagnosis
requires histologic confirmation.
The FNA shows groups of epithelioid cells, which are modified macrophages with abundant
cytoplasm and a footprint-shaped nucleus. Collections of epithelioid cells are called granulomata, hence the cytological diagnosis is granulomatous lymphadenitis. There is an accompanying mixed lymphoid population of mature and transformed lymphocytes. No necrosis
is seen, which makes TB less likely although this is not an essential feature. There is no evidence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma in which Reed–Sternberg cells, mononuclear Hodgkin cells
and eosinophils may be seen on FNA.
There are many possible causes for granulomatous inflammation. Infectious causes of granulomatous inflammation (besides mycobacteria) include fungal infections such as Histoplasma
and Cryptococcus. Non-infectious causes include inflammatory conditions such as Crohn’s
disease and sarcoidosis. Foreign bodies such as prosthetic implants and surgical suture material in tissues may also lead to formation of granulomata with giant cells.
Needle washings from the FNA should always be sent for detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB)
by direct demonstration on special stains such as Ziehl–Neelsen stain or auramine. Silver
staining should be performed to look for fungal organisms. Microbiological culture should
also be done as AFB are not always detected on special stains.
In the given case, the FNA finding of non-necrotising granulomatous inflammation in a
young man should prompt further investigations for sarcoidosis. If found to be elevated,
the serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level would suggest a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, since the enzyme is found in epithelioid cells forming granulomas. Serum calcium may also be elevated, since sarcoidal macrophages contain 1-α-hydroxylase, thereby
leading to increased levels of 1,25-Vitamin D, which is responsible for increasing calcium
reabsorption from the gut as well as mobilisation from bone. Chest imaging (initially plain
radiography and then CT) should be performed to look for pulmonary involvement, which
is a common site of disease. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is classically seen if the lungs
are involved.
The aetiology of sarcoidosis is not well understood, but is believed to be due to dysregulation of the immune system after exposure to an as yet unidentified agent. The disease may
affect any organ in the body, but often involves the lungs, producing a restrictive lung
defect. Skin lesions may also be seen, with the combination of erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and arthralgia being called Löfgren’s syndrome, a form of
acute sarcoidosis. Systemic symptoms, such as fevers, night sweats and weight loss, are also
common.
Many patients with sarcoidosis do not require treatment as the disease may remit spontaneously and often does so within 5 years. If patients are especially symptomatic, corticosteroids
may be used. A small number of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis may progress to progressive pulmonary fibrosis.
168

Case 58: Lymph node enlargement in a young man

KEY POINTS

• Granulomata are collections of modified macrophages called epithelioid cells and
•
•

are found as a specialized inflammatory response to certain agents, which may be
infectious (e.g. mycobacteria) or non-infectious (e.g. sarcoidosis).
Sarcoidosis is a systemic illness and investigations such as serum ACE levels, radiological investigations and FNA are used in making the diagnosis.
FNA is the first-line investigation for palpable lumps and can rapidly and accurately make a tissue diagnosis, avoiding the need for an excision biopsy.

Case 59: An itchy, bleeding mole on the back

CASE 59:

AN ITCHY, BLEEDING MOLE ON THE BACK

History
A 64-year-old Caucasian male presents to his GP with darkening of a pre-existing mole on
the back noticed by his wife while on holiday in the Bahamas. The patient complains that it is
itchy and bleeds readily but attributes it to being out in the sun for long hours.

Examination
The mole measures 8 mm, having grown by 2 mm since it was last recorded by the GP a year
ago. There is darkening of the lesion in the central part and the edges appear irregular compared to the earlier examination. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy and other moles on
the body appear unchanged.
INVESTIGATIONS
The GP refers the patient promptly to the dermatology clinic where an excision biopsy of
the lesion with a wide margin is performed.

Questions
1. Why did the GP maintain a record of the patient’s naevi?
2. What is the natural history of the progression of this lesion?
3. What are the clinical features that characterize this progression?

171

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 59
Some kinds of pigmented lesions (dysplastic naevi) have a predisposition to malignant
­t ransformation, particularly if they are 5 mm or more in diameter in parts of the body
not normally exposed to sunlight, if multiple lesions are present, and if there is a family
history of skin cancer. Regularly recording the appearances of a pigmented lesion and recognising the risk of development of melanoma in a dysplastic naevus indicates an alert GP.
Melanoma is a cancer of melanocytes, the pigmented cells in the skin, and is caused by injury
to lightly pigmented skin by excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. The
change in colour of a pre-existing pigmented lesion with itching and bleeding and irregular
margins on examination are indicators of transformation to melanoma.
Melanomas progress through a radial growth phase to a vertical growth phase. In the radial
growth phase, the lesion expands horizontally within the epidermis and superficial dermis
often for a long period of time. Progression to the vertical phase is characterized by downward growth of the lesion into the deeper dermis and with absence of maturation of cells
at the advancing front. During this phase, the lesion acquires the potential to metastasize
through lymphovascular channels. The probability of this happening increases with increasing depth of invasion (Breslow thickness) by the melanoma cells. Mitotic activity indicates
their aggressive potential. On the other hand, the presence of a lymphocytic reaction to the
tumour is a favourable sign.
The ABCDE mnemonic aids in the diagnosis of melanoma:
Asymmetry – melanomas are likely to be irregular or asymmetrical.
Border – melanomas are more likely to have an irregular border with jagged edges.
Colour – melanomas tend to be variegated in colour and may have different shades,
such as brown mixed with a black, red, pink, white or bluish tint.
Diameter – melanomas are usually more than 7 mm in diameter.
Evolution – look for changes in the size, shape or colour of a mole.
Most melanomas are less than 1 mm thick and are cured by complete excision, while thicker
melanomas may spread to the regional lymph nodes. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) may
confirm this spread and surgical dissection of the lymph nodes may be necessary to clear
the disease. Recurrences or spread of melanoma to other organs require adjuvant treatment
­(chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy). Prevention is through protection from
direct sunlight by use of appropriate clothing and the use of effective sunscreens.
KEY POINTS

• Melanoma is a form of skin cancer and UV radiation in sunlight (and sun beds) is
the most important risk factor.

• Change in colour, irregularity of margins and itching are indicators of transformation to melanoma in a pre-existing naevus.

• The progression from radial to vertical growth phase marks the acquisition of
­metastatic potential of a melanoma.

SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND HEARTBURN

A 52-year-old gentleman presents to his GP complaining of shortness of breath on exertion
and fatigue, which has been worsening for the past three months. During a systemic enquiry,
the patient reveals that his previously uninvestigated heartburn and indigestion have recently
become increasingly bothersome, especially at night. This is unabated by over-the-counter
antacids. The patient also admits to using regular ibuprofen for long-term knee pain. He
denies any change in weight, bowel habit or appetite. The patient has drunk 30 units of alcohol

This patient’s haematological indices suggest anaemia (low haemoglobin level), with microcytic red cells demonstrating low MCV (reflecting reduced average red cell size) and MCH
(reduced number of haemoglobin molecules per red cell).
The iron profile suggests a deficiency of serum iron, associated with a reduction in the
amount of iron storage (ferritin) and an increase in the body’s attempts to bind to serum
iron (TIBC). Both serum iron and ferritin levels are affected by other conditions – for example, ferritin increases with liver disease and infection. Hence, unless the patient does not
have any other pathology, their levels may not give an accurate assessment of the iron status
in the body. Haematologists tend to rely more on transferrin saturation for giving an accurate assessment.
Usually the body absorbs less than 10% of dietary iron via the duodenum. Absorption is
impaired by tea and alkaline foods such as vegetables. During deficiency, an increase in iron
absorption is concomitant with a rise in transferrin, which acts to carry iron to developing
red cells in the bone marrow. A high level of transferrin distinguishes iron deficiency anaemia from other causes of anaemia.
The peripheral blood smear shows hypochromic (pale) red blood cells. There are also long,
pencil-shaped red cells, typically seen in iron deficiency. All of these features point towards
iron deficiency as a cause of this man’s anaemia. The raised platelet count is also a recognized
feature of iron deficiency anaemia.
A differential diagnosis would include beta thalassaemia trait because this also produces
anaemia with low MCV. Usually beta thalassaemia trait would demonstrate raised haemoglobin A2 (HbA2). Beware that iron deficiency can mask beta thalassaemia trait by normalising the HbA2. Sideroblastic anaemia can present with microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic
anaemia. However, the levels of iron and ferritin may be raised, with a normal TIBC. Bone
marrow biopsy demonstrates ring sideroblasts, which are erythroblasts in which the nucleus
is encircled by rings of mitochondria containing iron deposits.
Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of anaemia worldwide. It takes several years for
dietary deficiency of iron to manifest. The more common causes are chronic blood loss from
the heavy menstrual bleeding in women and bleeding from the gastrointestinal system in men
and women. Iron can also be lost through the skin, as seen in exfoliative dermatitis. Other
causes include increased demand for iron as seen in newborns, adolescents, and pregnant and
lactating women. Gluten enteropathy and a gastrectomy can also predispose to iron deficiency.
Occasionally patients (usually children) with iron deficiency will exhibit pica, which is an
appetite for non-nutritive substances like crushed ice, paper or chalk. This disappears upon
correction of iron levels.
Acute blood loss presents with a normochromic normocytic (as opposed to hypochromic
microcytic) anaemia and reticulocytosis because plasma volume is able to re-expand over the
course of 3–7 days. However there are several clinical indicators of chronic blood loss in this
patient’s history. These include worsening heartburn and indigestion, a long-term history of
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen) use and high alcohol intake. GI lesions are
commonly associated with bleeding and iron deficiency. Further investigations in this patient
included both upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and a colonoscopy. This revealed gastritis and a duodenal ulcer. Biopsies showed positivity for Helicobacter pylori infection.

Case 60: Shortness of breath and heartburn

Blood transfusion is not indicated for this patient. Unfortunately many clinicians tend to
rush and give a blood transfusion when it is not indicated. A low haemoglobin level is not on
its own an indication for blood transfusion. A healthy patient with iron deficiency should be
expected to recover his normal haemoglobin levels with adequate iron supplements. Oral ferrous sulphate is available, and if not tolerated, other products such as ferrous fumarate can be
an alternative. If oral iron is not effective, then intravenous iron can be given and is usually
very effective in treating iron deficiency.
A common threshold for transfusion is a haemoglobin level of 8.0 g/L or less, but this in itself
is not an absolute indication. Young patients with iron deficiency and a haemoglobin level
of less than 8.0 g/L who are not symptomatic are expected to recover well with iron supplements. The patient’s symptoms and clinical signs, low BP and tachycardia, should be taken
into consideration when deciding on whether to give a blood transfusion. (Note: patients
with history of ischaemic heart disease have a higher threshold for the need for transfusion,
usually a haemoglobin level of 10.0 g/L or less).
KEY POINTS

• Iron deficiency anaemia is commonly caused by dietary deficiencies, but all
•
•

patients need to be assessed for possible blood loss through a GI lesion, and if
indicated appropriate investigations should be arranged.
In practice a high transferrin saturation is the best indication of iron deficiency in
the body.
Blood transfusion should not be given based on low haemoglobin levels alone: the
patient’s symptoms and signs need to be taken into consideration.

179

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 61
The initial full blood count shows a lymphocytic leucocytosis. Causes of lymphocytosis include:
• Infection, both acute (e.g. infectious mononucleosis, mumps, herpes simplex/zoster,
and HIV) and chronic (tuberculosis and syphilis)
• Chronic lymphoid leukaemias, most commonly chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
• Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
• Thyrotoxicosis
In the absence of symptoms (such as features of infection) and signs (such as lymphadenopathy
and organomegaly), and with normal thyroid function, the most likely diagnosis in this case
is CLL. This is corroborated by the blood film shown in Figure 61.1, which shows increased
numbers of small, mature lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm. As these cells are fragile, they
may be disrupted in the process of making smears, giving rise to “smudge cells” that are seen
in film. Immunophenotyping is required to confirm the diagnosis of CLL, and the phenotype
of CD5, CD20 and CD23 positivity is characteristic of CLL.
CLL is the most common leukaemia in the Western world. Typically, it is picked up via
an incidental lymphocytosis in an asymptomatic individual. Diagnosis requires an absolute ­lymphocytosis of at least 5×109/L and an appropriate lymphocyte immunophenotype.
Common cytogenetic abnormalities in CLL include deletions of chromosomes 11, 13 and 17

Case 61: Raised white cell count in an asymptomatic individual

(del 11q, del 13q, del 17p), as well as trisomy 12. About 50% of cases also show evidence of
somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IGVH).
The disease is staged according to the Binet classification. Typically, patients with Binet stage
A disease require no immediate treatment. Symptomatic stage B and all stage C patients
receive chemotherapy. Options for treatment include chlorambucil, or fludarabine, sometimes in a combination with cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). However, cure is rare
and the aim is to achieve periods of remission and symptom control. Younger patients may
be suitable for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which is curative but has a significant
morbidity and mortality rate.
The patient’s blood results at three years highlight an important complication of CLL. They
show a normocytic anaemia (as well as a marked lymphocytosis). The latter represents progression of CLL, but the absence of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia suggests that marrow infiltration is not severe. However, taken together with the positive direct antiglobulin
test (DAT), the most likely explanation for the anaemia is immunohaemolytic. Autoimmune
haemolytic anaemia is sometimes seen in CLL, as a result of autoantibody generation by
lymphocytes against red blood cells. This produces pallor (due to anaemia) and icterus (as a
result of increased destruction of red cells, leading to an unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia).
The median survival in CLL is between four and six years, though some patients survive a
decade or more. Adverse prognostic features include stage B or C disease at diagnosis, male
gender, rapid lymphocyte doubling time (<1 yr), presence of del 11q, del 17p and trisomy 12,
a raised LDH, positivity for CD38 expression and high ZAP-70 expression. There is also a
tendency of CLL to transform into a more aggressive leukaemia, typically a prolymphocytic
transformation (in 15–30% of patients) or, less commonly (<10% of cases), transformation
into a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (a so-called Richter transformation). Appearance of
transformative disease is an ominous sign, with few patients surviving for more than a year
with such disease.
KEY POINTS

• Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the commonest form of leukaemia in the
Western world.

• CLL is a lymphoproliferative disorder of mature lymphocytes and typically presents as an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients.

• Staging of the disease helps govern whether treatment is required.
• Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is a known complication of CLL, caused by autoantibody production by diseased lymphocytes against red blood cells.

183

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 62
The patient has pancytopenia with blast cells in the circulation consistent with a ­d iagnosis
of acute leukaemia. The patient is lethargic due to the anaemia. She is also bleeding because
of low platelets. She is at increased risk of infections due to neutropenia. Blast cells are
immature cells that turn into mature blood cells in the bone marrow. In acute leukaemia, an arrest in the maturation process keeps these cells at their early ­non-functioning
stage, and they begin to divide rapidly; the increased proliferation occupies space in the
bone marrow, thereby disturbing the normal haemopoiesis, and eventually leading to
pancytopenia.
The blast cells eventually leak out into the circulation and they can be seen on a peripheral
blood film. They are usually large in size (causing a higher MCV reading in the full blood count)
with an open chromatin appearance. They are also light in colour, compared to the nuclei
of mature cells, which are smaller and darker. Blast cells have high n
­ ucleus-to-cytoplasmic
ratio (a large nucleus in scanty cytoplasm).
Distinguishing between acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukaemia
(ALL) can be based on morphological features; however, this is not always easy, and since the
treatment depends on an exact diagnosis, other tests must be done to clarify the exact nature
of the cells.

Figure 62.1 Blood film showing neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and blast cells.

184

Case 62: Worsening fatigue and bleeding gums

Other tests that this patient needs include a bone marrow biopsy by the haematology team.
The biopsy provides tissue that can be examined for:
• Further morphological assessment, as the percentage of blast cells would be much
higher in the bone marrow. The general haemopoietic status of the bone marrow can
also be assessed.
• Immunophenotyping studies to test the CD markers on the blast cells, which should
provide a more accurate assessment of their nature
• Cytogenetic studies, as certain chromosomal abnormalities are associated with
adverse prognosis, which will influence treatment options (e.g. whether to offer the
patient stem cell transplant or not)
• Molecular genetic studies, as certain mutations are associated with adverse prognosis and respond to specific therapies (e.g. BCR-ABL-positive patients with ALL are
given imatinib)
Clotting studies need to be arranged and any clotting abnormality needs to be corrected.
Variants such as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) are associated with disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can be life threatening, especially with a very low
platelet count.
The patient is neutropenic, so she needs close observation. Fever should initiate septic screening and administration of intravenous antibiotics as a matter of urgency (according to local
neutropenic sepsis guidelines).
This patient would also benefit from a platelet transfusion. Haematologists usually aim for
a level of greater than 20 × 109/L in young patients, unless there is bleeding, in which case
the level should be even higher. This patient’s deranged liver function tests might represent
leukaemic infiltration or another pathology of the liver. Blood tests for a liver screen and an
abdominal ultrasound scan should be arranged.
Acute leukaemia can infiltrate other organs, especially the central nervous system (CNS) in
ALL. A careful screening of the patient’s symptoms, asking her about headaches and clinical
examination to exclude neurological signs, is essential. If there is any suspicion of CNS
involvement, a CT scan of the brain is needed, and a lumbar puncture should be performed
to evaluate the CSF for presence of leukaemic cells.
The initial treatment will be chemotherapy, but a stem cell transplant may be a treatment
option, so it would be useful to know whether she has siblings who are a match and can be
stem cells donors. Otherwise, a search for a matched unrelated donor will be needed to find
suitable HLA-matched stem cells.
KEY POINTS

• Acute leukaemia is a medical emergency that needs to be excluded in any patient
with an isolated cytopenia or pancytopenia.

• Neutropenic sepsis is a serious complication of acute leukaemia. It can occur at
•

presentation or during treatment, and needs to be treated urgently with intravenous antibiotics without any delay.
The exact treatment of acute leukaemia will depend on the type of leukaemia,
which can be determined through immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and molecular genetic studies.

187

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 63
The patient has urinary symptoms, positive urine dipstick, signs of sepsis (fever, t­ achycardia
and hypotension) and raised serum inflammatory markers. These are all suggestive of ­urinary
sepsis.
She also has acute renal failure (assuming she had a normal baseline) and deranged clotting. She has prolonged clotting times (PT and APTT) and low fibrinogen. She also has
elevated D-dimers, which are products of fibrin degradation (giving an indication of fibrin
formation). These clotting abnormalities are features of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
DIC is a syndrome that is characterized by loss of control of intravascular activation of coagulation. The hallmark of DIC is the widespread activation of thrombin, and hence thrombosis,
that leads to excessive consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, and as a consequence
leads to excessive bleeding. The simultaneous thrombosis and bleeding, in association with the
activation of the inflammatory cascade, causes widespread organ damage and high mortality.
Associated organ damage can precipitate the abnormalities in DIC: renal failure could impair
platelet function, liver failure decreases synthesis of clotting factors, and endothelial dysfunction depletes nitric oxide from the circulation which leads to constant platelet activation.
There are several conditions that are associated with DIC:
• Sepsis
• Trauma (head injury, burns, fat embolism)
• Malignancy
• Obstetric complications (placental abruption, pre-eclampsia)
• Pancreatitis
The best treatment in DIC is to treat the cause. In the case of this patient, the urinary sepsis
was treated with intravenous antibiotics and fluids. Supportive therapy with blood products
is also needed:
• Platelet transfusion to keep the platelet count greater than 50 × 109/L if there is a
high risk of bleeding.
• Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a source of clotting factors, except fibrinogen. The adult
dose is 15 mL/kg, which is approximately equivalent to four units of FFP.
• Cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate should be given to keep the fibrinogen
level greater than 1.5.
• Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) could be considered, and in severe bleeding recombinant (r) factor VIIa may be advised. However, these special products
need to be discussed with the haematology team prior to their use.
Widespread thrombosis in the micro-circulation of organs leads to ischaemia and possible
permanent damage in the kidneys, liver, spleen, lungs and brain.
KEY POINTS

• DIC is a syndrome that can be triggered by several conditions, including renal and
liver failure.

• It is characterized by simultaneous thrombosis and bleeding, as a result of consumption of clotting factors.

• The best treatment is to treat the cause and use supportive blood products.

3. What is your management plan?

189

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 64
The patient has erythrocytosis (a high haemoglobin level), thrombocytosis (a high platelet
level), and polycythaemia (a high haematocrit and packed cell volume [PCV]). Given his presentation, and his splenomegaly, this is most likely polycythaemia vera (PV).
PV is a haematological disorder with expansion of all three major myeloid cell lineages: red
blood cells, neutrophils and platelets. The majority of patients have a mutation in the tyrosine
kinase JAK2, the main function of which is to stimulate erythropoiesis. The most common
mutation is V167F, followed by mutation in exon 12.
In PV, erythropoiesis is autonomous as a consequence of these mutations and does not
depend on the erythropoietin (EPO) hormone. In fact, EPO levels are reduced in PV.
True polycythaemia needs to be distinguished from apparent polycythaemia. The former
is a true increase in total red cell mass, while the latter is caused by a reduction in plasma
volume. True polycythaemia may be primary (either a clonal disorder such as PV, or the
result of an inherited defect either in EPO receptors or the red cell precursors), or secondary.
Secondary polycythaemia is best divided according to whether it is associated with hypoxia
or not. Conditions with systemic hypoxia, such as lung disease, heavy smoking, and congenital cyanotic heart disease, may all cause secondary polycythaemia. Other conditions, without
hypoxia, may also cause polycythaemia:
• Elevated levels of EPO due to either inherited conditions or to renal or liver disease
• Endocrine conditions such as Cushing’s disease and Conn’s syndrome
PV usually presents with neurological symptoms, similar to the patient in this case. Such
symptoms are due to increased viscosity of the blood and the sluggish cerebral circulation.
Pruritus occurs in almost 25% of patients. Thrombotic events, either arterial or venous, especially in splenic vessels, are serious complications of PV, and can be the presenting feature in
previously undiagnosed patients. Many patients also are diagnosed incidentally on a routine
blood test.
To confirm the diagnosis the following are required:
• JAK2 mutation screen, and if negative, a test for exon 12 mutation (currently available only in certain centres).
• EPO levels to exclude secondary polycythaemia.
• Abdominal ultrasound scan to measure the spleen and to search for an abdominal
lesion that may be responsible for high EPO levels.
• If there is a possibility of hypoxia or lung disease, then arterial blood gas measurement to measure oxygenation levels. Carboxyhaemoglobin can be tested in heavy
smoking as well.
• If the above tests do not confirm the diagnosis, then other tests can be arranged, e.g.
red cell mass studies and high affinity haemoglobins.
Venesection to reduce the PCV to less than 0.45 is an effective way to improve a patient’s
symptoms and reduce the risk of thrombosis. Patients initially undergo weekly venesection
until their PCV is below 0.45, after which at 4–6-week and then 2–3-month intervals.
If venesection is not effective or not tolerated by the patient (dizziness is a common side effect),
cytoreductive therapy can be considered. Hydroxycarbamide is a common option. Patients
with significant thrombocytosis may benefit from aspirin.
190

Case 64: Headaches, blurred vision and itching

KEY POINTS

• PV is a clonal disorder affecting all three myeloid lineages (haemoglobin, neutrophils and platelets).

• JAK2 mutation is detected in the majority of cases, and needs to be tested in any
patient with unusual thrombosis, e.g. splenic vein thrombosis.

• Venesection is an effective treatment for PV.

193

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 65
The blood film shows numerous sickle cells, which is likely to represent homozygous
inheritance of sickle haemoglobin Hb-S. This child has sickle cell disease, which is a type
of i­ nherited chronic haemolytic anaemia.
His blood tests confirm anaemia and show an inflammatory response, by his elevated white
cell count, platelets and C-reactive protein. Given that he is presenting with coryzal symptoms, it is likely that he has an infection. His deranged liver function tests could reflect the
underlying infection, but it is more likely that haemolysis has caused his elevated bilirubin
and low haemoglobin level.
Haemolysis is a chronic process in sickle cell disease, but at times of infection, acute or
chronic haemolysis happens. It is vital that for such patients the baseline haemoglobin is
known. In the case of this child who arrived recently from Nigeria, where sickle cell is commonly inherited, it seems that his mother is not aware of his diagnosis. He is likely to have
been missed on screening when he was born.
Hb-S is caused by a single nucleotide change in the beta-globin chain that results in the
substitution of valine for glutamic acid. This increases the tendency for Hb-S to polymerize in de-oxygenated conditions. This intracellular polymerization gives the red blood cells
the elongated sickle shape (Figure 65.1). These cells have reduced deformability and their
flow through small capillaries increases blood viscosity, causing vaso-occlusion, hypoxia and
bone infarction. Bone pain is the commonest symptoms of a vaso-occlusive crisis and can be
very severe.

Figure 65.1 Blood film showing elongated, sickle-shaped red blood cells.
194

Case 65: A painful arm and a large spleen

A septic screen should be performed that includes a blood culture, urine microscopy, culture &
sensitivity, chest radiograph and a viral swab from his nasal discharge. A plain radiograph of his
right forearm will help exclude bone injury and osteomyelitis. The patient also needs to have a
group and save sample with extended phenotype matching to be performed by the blood transfusion lab. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen to measure the size of the spleen and exclude
any other liver pathology is necessary. Most sickle cell disease patients have atrophic spleens
because of recurrent vaso-occlusion and infarction, which leaves them with non-­functioning
spleens. They need vaccination against encapsulated bacteria, so a vaccination every five years
against pneumococcal bacteria is required. Also, they have chronic haemolytic anaemia, so
they need regular folic acid to maintain a supply to the newly formed red blood cells.
This patient is likely suffering from a painful (vaso-occlusive) sickle cell crisis precipitated
by a viral infection. Pain needs to be controlled. The first line is regular paracetamol and
NSAIDs. If the mother already tried them, then codeine phosphate could be given. Some
patients with sickle cell disease have severe painful episodes, which can be quite frequent and
require hospital admission. Morphine should be used promptly for such patients.
In addition to analgesia, patients must have adequate hydration and oxygenation because
the polymerization of Hb-S is influenced by the oxygenation status and dehydration. Start
intravenous fluids if oral hydration is not adequate.
If there is any suspicion of bacterial infection, then antibiotics must be started. Haemoglobin
baseline level varies between patients with sickle cell disease, but they tend to have lower
­levels than the rest of the population. This patient’s haemoglobin level is borderline low,
and it needs to be monitored closely. Most physicians would transfuse if it drops below
6.0 g/dL in sickle cell disease. This needs to be anticipated and thus a sample is usually sent
to the blood transfusion lab on admission. Importantly, since some of these patients need
recurrent blood transfusions over their lifetime, the laboratory would usually give extended
phenotype matching blood units. This means they are matched not only for the ABO and
RhD blood groups but for other blood groups as well. This is to reduce the risk of developing
antibodies against these other blood groups, which would lead to difficulty in finding suitable units of blood to transfuse the patient in the future.
One of the severe complications of sickle cell disease is stroke, which can be silent in children.
This patient needs an MRI of the brain to exclude this and a referral to a paediatric haematologist for long-term follow-up and a secondary prevention program to protect against
further brain damage.
KEY POINTS

• Sickle cell disease is an inherited chronic haemolytic anaemia.
• Infections can precipitate painful episodes from vaso-occlusion and they need
prompt treatment.

• Other long-term complications of the disease need to be addressed: chronic haemolytic state, vaccination, and reducing risk of cerebrovascular disease.

• Psychological support and family education are vital in such chronic conditions.

A 34-year-old woman presents to her GP with a rash on her thighs which appeared this morning. She started noticing it following two days of coryzal symptoms.
Following a quick assessment, the GP suspects meningitis and administers intramuscular
benzylpenicillin and refers the patient to the local the Emergency Department. Upon arrival,
the doctors take a more detailed history. She has no photophobia or neck stiffness, and apart
from being worried about the rash, she is otherwise well. She also remembers some gum
bleeding from the night before while she was brushing her teeth. Her family history reveals
several relatives with autoimmune disease.

Examination
She is not febrile, and cardiovascular and respiratory examinations are normal. She has no
palpable spleen, liver or lymph nodes. The rash is purpuric and does not blanch on stretching
the skin. Joints examination is unremarkable.

ANSWER 66
Blood results show thrombocytopenia, and mild neutropenia with lymphocytosis. The top
two differential diagnoses are leukaemia, which affects normal haemopoiesis and causes
cytopenia by the rapid divisions of abnormal leukaemia cells in the bone marrow. The other
main differential diagnosis is primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), previously known
as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, which typically causes low platelets and sometimes
neutropenia if there is a concurrent viral illness or autoimmune disease.
To exclude leukaemia, a blood film is usually examined for blast cells, which are cells with
abnormal maturation. This blood film (Figure 66.1) does not show blast cells. Instead it confirms thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and giant platelets at the centre of the film.
This patient has ITP, which is an autoimmune condition characterized by low platelets and
tendency to bleed. It was initially thought to be a condition caused purely by auto-antibodies
against platelets leading to opsonization and premature destruction in the reticuloendothelial system. However, recently a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology has shown that
in fact other mechanisms are involved.
Autoantibodies opsonize megakaryocytes, which are the cells of the bone marrow that
­synthesize platelets. This has an inhibitory effect of their growth and platelet release, and
induces apoptosis. Relatively low levels of free thrombopoietin (TPO), the hormone that
drives platelet production, might also be contributing to low levels of platelets, as may
­T-cell-directed lysis of platelets.

Figure 66.1 Blood film showing thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and giant platelets at the
centre of the film.
198

Case 66: A rash on the thighs

As ITP is an autoimmune condition, giving a transfusion of platelets will not correct the
abnormality. Platelet transfusion is reserved for emergencies, where there is serious bleeding
or an urgent procedure that needs to be done and cannot be delayed.
Patients with ITP have low levels of platelets. With a platelet count of less than 30 × 109/L
most patients will not bleed. Younger patients who are otherwise well might even tolerate
platelets of less than 20 × 109/L with no symptoms at all.
The main treatment is immunosuppression, and the first-line therapy is steroids, intravenous
immunoglobulins (Ig) or anti-D. Steroids are given either orally or intravenously depending
on severity of bleeding. The patient is usually started on a high dose of 1 mg per kg oral prednisolone, or 1 gram methylprednisolone intravenously.
The dose is gradually weaned off over several weeks. The patient may be kept in hospital
overnight for observations, but if she is well, she can be sent home and return the next day
for a review and a blood test to ensure appropriate rise in platelet count following steroids.
She must be referred to a haematologist who will ensure appropriate follow-up.
ITP can be associated with infections, usually viral, and can relapse with future infections.
HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C should be screened for. It can also be associated with autoimmune diseases; hence some physicians send an autoimmune screen at presentation.
KEY POINTS

• ITP is an autoimmune bleeding disorder caused by increased platelet destruction
and impaired production.

• Acute leukaemia needs to be excluded with any presentation with thrombocytopenia.
• Platelet transfusion is rarely needed, unless in emergency or to cover a procedure.
• In the short term steroids work very well, and the platelet level rises appropriately,
but long-term follow-up is needed with the haematology team.

CASE 67:

FATIGUE AND WEIGHT LOSS

A previously healthy 55-year-old man presents to his GP with concerns regarding his energy
levels; it has gotten so bad lately that he feels very tired while doing simple gardening. He has
lost 10 kg of weight over the last six weeks. He has no previous history of heart or lung disease
and the only medication he takes is allopurinol for recurrent gout. His only other symptom is
slight abdominal discomfort, which he is attributing to his medication.

Examination
The patient appeared breathless, but with normal examination of cardiology and the respiratory system. His abdominal examination is also normal apart from an enlarged spleen.
Temperature is 37.2ºC. Blood pressure is 135/75.

201

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 67
The blood test shows high white cell count (with a significant neutrophilia) and a normal
C-reactive protein level. So this is not an inflammatory response, especially given that the
patient is apyrexial and has no signs of infection.
The blood film (Figure 67.1) shows neutrophilia, myelocytes (cells in the maturation stage
previous to neutrophils) and some blast cells. This is likely to be chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), which is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by clonal expansion of the
myeloid mass in the bone marrow which eventually displaces normal haemopoiesis. Many
cases are diagnosed incidentally on a routine blood test that shows typical features shown
in Figure 67.1. However, it can also present with the symptoms typical of those in this case.
The disease has several phases: ‘chronic’ phase is when the most cases are diagnosed and it
represents the initial stage of the disease, which could last 2–7 years. It can then transform
into the ‘accelerated’ phase, which can take months to years, before the final phase, which is
known as ‘blast transformation’. At this final phase, the overwhelming majority of cells are
blast cells, either myeloid or lymphoid, which are non-functioning cells that occupy the bone
marrow and have the potential to invade other tissues.
Note that the difference between the presentation of acute and chronic leukaemia is that in
chronic leukaemia, all of the stages of maturation of blood cells are expanded in numbers,
namely blast cells, promyelocytes, myelocytes, band cells, and neutrophils. In acute leukaemia, or blast transformation of CML, most cells are blast cells, and hence the bone marrow
produces no effective blood cells, leading to bone marrow failure.

Figure 67.1 Blood film showing neutrophilia, myelocytes and some blast cells.
202

Case 67: Fatigue and weight loss

To confirm the diagnosis, a bone marrow biopsy to detect the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is
needed. Some 90–95% of patients with CML have this gene, which is the result of translocation (9;22), also known as the Philadelphia chromosome.
The ABL gene is a proto-oncogene coding for a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. However, with
the translocation of this gene onto chromosome 22, its fusion with the BCR produces a new
oncoprotein which has a greater activity than the normal product of the ABL gene. The mechanism by which this new gene product affects the cell kinetics is still not fully understood.
The treatment that has changed the course of this condition is tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the
first line being imatinib. This family of drugs is thought to act by binding to the oncoprotein
product of the BCR-ABL1 gene and inactivating it. There are other generations of this family
available now, such as dasatinib and nilotinib.
The response to the drugs is assessed by testing three modalities: peripheral blood to ensure
normalisation of blood count, cytogenetics to ensure elimination of Philadelphia-positive
cells from the bone marrow, and finally molecular studies to confirm the elimination of BCRABL1 transcript product in the circulation.
KEY POINTS

• CML is a myeloproliferative disorder in which there is expansion of numbers of
cells at all stages of maturation.

• The condition should be suspected in any patient with persistent unexplained
neutrophilia, as this might represent CML at the chronic phase.

• Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are an example of targeted therapy, in which the oncoprotein product of the BCR-ABL1 gene is bound to and inactivated by the drug.

Case 68: Pneumonia with abnormal liver function

CASE 68:

PNEUMONIA WITH ABNORMAL LIVER FUNCTION

A 32-year-old man presents to his GP with symptoms of productive cough and fever. He is
not a smoker and he does not have any past medical history. He works as a civil engineer and
he does not drink any alcohol. There is no history of any recent travel.

Examination
The patient looks unwell, his temperature is 37.9ºC, and auscultation of his chest reveals
crepitations in the right base. Examination of the cardiovascular and abdominal systems is
unremarkable. The GP makes a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and prescribes
a course of amoxicillin.
The patient returns in one week with no improvement. The GP sends a routine blood test and
a screen for atypical pneumonia, which comes back positive. He adds clarithromycin to the
treatment and the patient eventually improves.
Concerned about extrapulmonary complications of an atypical pneumonia, the GP performs
a full liver screen six weeks later.

What is the most likely diagnosis?
What other tests would you order to confirm the diagnosis?
What is your management plan?
What other advice would you give the patient regarding his lifestyle and his family?

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 68
The patient had abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) at the time of his diagnosis with
­pneumonia. Sometimes this can be attributed to the infection. However, the LFTs remained
abnormal six weeks after, and this suggests an alternative underlying liver pathology.
The level of ferritin increases with infection or inflammation. But at such a high level and in
absence of viral liver disease, iron studies are necessary to evaluate iron status. The best test
for this is transferrin saturation. In view of the elevated transferrin saturation levels, iron
overload is the most likely explanation, and the most common cause for this in the Western
world is haemochromatosis.
Haemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic conditions found in northern Europe.
It has four types. The most common is type 1, involving mutation in the HFE gene, for which
the homozygous state is strongly associated with iron overload. The second commonest is the
H63D mutation.
Approximately one in eight people are carriers of the C282Y genetic mutation of the HFE
gene. The function of this gene is to regulate another gene, the transferrin receptor gene,
and hepcidin expression. The transferrin receptors are molecules through which transferrin binds to the cell, thereby allowing iron uptake into the cell. Hepcidin is a small peptide,
expressed predominately in the liver and is involved in iron absorption and reducing iron
release from macrophages.
Patients with haemochromatosis are usually asymptomatic; the disease is usually discovered
on routine screening. This patient clearly was asymptomatic. The only signs of disease were
persistently deranged LFTs, which prompted further investigation. The main lesson to be
drawn is not to overlook abnormal LFTs, which could have been attributed to his atypical
bacterial chest infection. It is important to follow up such results after patient discharge from
hospital to ensure resolution once the chest infection has cleared.
Following a confirmation of the diagnosis, screen the patients for further possible complications. Increased iron absorption from the gut encourages iron deposition in tissues. Iron
could accumulate in the pancreas, causing diabetes mellitus; in the pituitary gland, causing
hypogonadism; in the joints, causing arthralgia and arthritis; and in the heart, causing cardiomyopathy. The clinical assessment of haemochromatosis needs to address symptoms and
signs of dysfunction in all of these organs. Appropriate tests for the function of these organs
may be necessary: fasting glucose, LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone, x-rays of joints and, if
indicated, echocardiogram.
Excessive iron removal by venesection needs to be started. It is usually done at the haematology day unit by the nursing staff. The patient attends regular sessions of venesection (450 mL
is usually removed each time), initially weekly until the ferritin level is below 50 µg/L. Once
this is reached, the frequency of venesection will depend on regular monitoring of ferritin
to keep it below the level of 50 µg /L. Some patients will need to come every two weeks, but
eventually most patients are established on 4–6 weekly sessions. Venesections may be associated with symptoms of dizziness and headaches.
All patients need to be advised about their dietary intake of iron, which needs to be reduced.
Also alcohol intake ought to be reduced to avoid further liver damage.
Since haemochromatosis is an inherited condition, all first-degree family members of the
patients are advised to have transferrin saturation and haemochromatosis gene tests.
208

Case 68: Pneumonia with abnormal liver function

KEY POINTS

• Haemochromatosis is a common inherited condition causing excessive iron
absorption.

• Patients commonly present asymptomatically with either abnormal LFTs or
­elevated ferritin.

• Transferrin saturation is the best test to indicate iron overload.

Case 69: Recurrent epistaxis

CASE 69:

RECURRENT EPISTAXIS

A 25-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with epistaxis. He has been
­bleeding for two hours and it is not responding to local pressure and ice application. The doctors call an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon, who upon inspection finds a bleeding vessel
in the left nostril and carries out cauterization.
After two weeks, the patient returns to the Emergency Department with further bleeding.
A repeat cauterization is carried out and an ENT surgery outpatient follow-up is arranged
for a week later. Before the date of the follow-up, he returns to the Emergency Department
again with bleeding from the right nostril.
At the clinic review the ENT surgeon advises that cauterization is not the best option for
his recurrent bleeding, and he suggests vessel embolisation by interventional radiology to
­prevent further bleeding in the future.
The patient is booked for the procedure and has the following pre-procedure blood tests.

211

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 69
This is a real case of a patient where there was a significant delay in making the correct
diagnosis. The patient presented with recurrent epistaxis that needed more than treatment
in the Emergency Department. The epistaxis should have been investigated further before
sending the patient home.
One important feature here is that he is bleeding from both nostrils. If this is simply a local
vessel causing the bleed, then the bleeding is expected to be from one nostril only. The fact
that both nostrils are involved should arouse suspicion that the patient may have a clotting
disorder.
The patient’s microcytic anaemia is likely to be due to iron deficiency secondary to recurrent
bleeding. His slight thrombocytosis is likely to be secondary to bleeding as well.
He has normal PT but slightly prolonged APTT, which heightens suspicion for factor VIII
and factor IX abnormalities. Factor VIII and factor IX deficiencies (i.e. haemophilia) tend
to present with joint bleeding and usually at an early age. The level of factor VIII in haemophilia B is usually very low. This patient has a slightly low level, which is inconsistent with
haemophilia B. However, von Willebrand factor deficiency can cause moderately low levels
of factor VIII.
This patient has mucosal bleeding, which makes von Willebrand disease (VWD) the most
likely diagnosis. VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. The VW factor is
an important element in haemostasis. It is produced predominantly by the vascular endothelium, and has two main functions:
a. Binding to collagen at sites of vascular injury, and then capturing circulating platelets to form the initial primary haemostasis plug
b. Stabilising factor VIII in the circulation by protecting it from degradation, which is
why it is considered as a co-factor for factor VIII
VWD can be caused by either quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of the VW factor.
Patients often present in their second or third decades of life, or after prolonged bleeding
from a minor procedure like a tooth extraction. The usual bleeding is from mucosal surfaces,
bruising, epistaxis or menorrhagia.
The patient needs to have a repeat test of factor VIII and factor IX levels as a confirmation
and VW screening before any intervention is carried out. The usual VW screen includes level
and functional activity. VWF:Ag measures the level of the factor, and VWF:RCo measures
its activity. These tests could have been done fairly quickly and they could have spared the
patient recurrent hospital attendance and unnecessary interventions.
Artery embolisation procedures should be delayed until the confirmation of the diagnosis of
VWD. For any future episodes of epistaxis, anti-fibrinolytic drugs such as tranexamic acid
should be tried as a first line. Tranexamic acid works by stabilising the blood clot and usually
prevents further bleeding. For recurrent bleeding not responding to tranexamic acid alone,
desmopressin should be used. Intravenous desmopressin usually works within 30 minutes to
produce a rise in factor VIII and VW factor levels. If this fails, then intravenous VW f­ actor
concentrate needs to be given. Such products are available only in t­ ertiary haematology referral centres, where patients with haemophilia and VWD are usually treated. Regular follow up
is needed with the haematology team and patient education for these conditions is essential.
212

Case 69: Recurrent epistaxis

KEY POINTS

• Any patient presenting with recurrent bleeding needs to have a coagulation
screen.

• VWD is an inherited bleeding disorder that needs to be excluded in any patient
with recurrent bleeding.

• An isolated prolonged APTT needs further evaluation and discussion with the haematology team, especially if the patient is presenting with bleeding or bruising.

Case 70: Bruising after a pneumonia

CASE 70:

BRUISING AFTER A PNEUMONIA

A 65-year-old woman is admitted to hospital with a community-acquired pneumonia. She was
initially treated by her GP with oral antibiotics, without any improvement, so she was admitted
to hospital for IV antibiotics. She had no previous medical history apart from an appendectomy
at age 17. Over the next 48 hours she showed significant improvement in her symptoms and
she was ready for discharge. The FY1 doctor is preparing her discharge letter when he is called
by nursing staff to review the patient as the patient reports some concerns regarding her skin.

Examination
The FY1 doctor examines the skin and finds some bruising over the arms and forearms. He
conducts further examination, and discovers that the patient has significant bruising over
her back and upper legs. Otherwise, she feels well.
He sends an urgent clotting screen and decides not to delay her discharge, based on her feeling well and the limited number of beds in the hospital. The patient is sent home without
reviewing the blood results.
Upon arriving home, the patient’s bruising got worse, and the next morning she noticed
some blood in her urine.
The FY1 doctor had meant to check the blood results the next day but didn’t have a chance
because of his busy morning. The patient attended the Emergency Department in the afternoon with extensive bruising and epistaxis. The the Emergency Department doctors repeated
her clotting screen.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 70
When faced with a patient with bruising, there are several issues that doctors need to be
aware of:
• Any previous history of bruising, as this may well be a normal variation in the population, and some patients may bruise more easily than others. However, this can be
considered a normal variation only after a careful assessment.
• Bleeding needs to be excluded, so ask the patient about any epistaxis, haematuria,
menorrhagia and haemoptysis. The major medical emergency you need to be aware
of is intracranial bleeding, so careful assessment of the patient for any symptoms of
headache, drowsiness or limb weakness is essential.
• Another important part of history is any previous surgical intervention, including
tissue biopsy or dental work, as this would give a very good idea regarding previous haemostasis functioning. This patient had in fact had an appendicectomy many
years ago, and she reports no complications.
In this patient, PT and fibrinogen are within a normal range; however, the APTT is prolonged.
Since PT measures the activities of factors II, V, VII and X, this screen shows that these factors
also are essentially normal.
APTT measures the activities of factors VIII, IX, XI and XII. The conclusion is that this
patient has some abnormalities in one of these factors and given that factors VIII and IX are
the most clinically significant, their level of activities needs to be assessed.
von Willebrand factor (VWF) is an important co-factor for factor VIII. VWF:Ag measures
the level of the factor, and VWF:RCo measures its activity. Both tests are normal in this
patient.
Factor VIII is low, and in a patient with previously unreported bleeding symptoms, this is
likely to be acquired haemophilia B. This disorder presents similar to congenital haemophilia,
with bleeding subcutaneously or into the muscles, but rarely into the joints. The pathology
is the result of autoantibodies associated with certain conditions which are directed against
factor VIII. These antibodies can be found in autoimmune conditions, such as SLE, lymphoproliferative conditions, malignancy, and infections. They can also be idiopathic, without
any known associations.
Stabilizing the patient is the first priority: any bleeding needs to be stopped and treated
promptly. Urgent FBC needs to be sent to assess haemoglobin level and the possible need for
blood transfusion.
If there is significant continuous bleeding, then a bypassing agent needs to be used to correct
the clotting deficiency. At the current time, two options are available: (a) activated prothrombin complex concentrate FEIBA (factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity) and (b) recombinant factor VIIa. Both preparations aim to bypass the deficiency and activate the clotting
cascade further down from factor VIII, to eventually convert fibrinogen into fibrin and form
a clot at the site of vascular injury.
Regardless of the bleeding, once the diagnosis is confirmed, the treatment aimed at eradicating the autoantibody needs to be started. The first line is steroids, and response is usually
monitored with factor VIII serial levels. If there is no response, then other options are cyclophosphamide, azathioprine or rituximab.
216

Case 70: Bruising after a pneumonia

KEY POINTS

• Any change in the patient’s condition needs to be discussed with senior colleagues prior to discharge.

• Significant bruising needs to be investigated before reassuring the patient that
there is nothing wrong.

• Acquired haemophilia B is a disorder of antibodies against factor VIII.
• Treatment is immune suppression, with a bypassing agent to stop any bleeding.

Case 71: Headache and a rash

CASE 71:

HEADACHE AND A RASH

A 34-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with a headache. She saw her
GP last week, who thought her symptoms may stem from stress at work. The headache is
getting worse and not responding to analgesia. She has no vomiting, and her headache feels
like a band around her head. It was not made worse by lying flat or by straining. She also
complains of coryzal symptoms. She has no significant past medical history.

Examination
She has no skin rash and her observations are all normal. Respiratory and cardiovascular
examinations are both normal. Gross neurological assessments including her reflexes are
normal. She has no photophobia. Her the Emergency Department doctors arrange routine
blood tests.
While waiting for the results, she develops a high temperature of 39.4°C, and the nurse
reports to the doctors that the patient has noticed a skin rash.
The doctor returns to reassess the patient, and he notices that she has become slightly more
vague about her history. On examination, she has developed a small purpuric rash over both
her arms.

219

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 71
The patient has anaemia with a high reticulocyte percentage, raised LDH and undetectable
haptoglobins, which suggests haemolysis. Haptoglobins are produced by the liver, and they
are usually consumed by binding to free haemoglobin in the circulation.
Thrombocytopenia is confirmed on the blood film, which also shows increased red blood
cell fragments (Figure 71.1). This is suggestive of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia
(MAHA), where the red cells are destroyed intravascularly by a mechanical force. A false
thrombocytopenia can be caused by platelets clumping together as a reaction to EDTA solution in an FBC bottle. Such clumps would be seen on blood film. To obtain an accurate platelet count in these situations, a blood sample should be collected in a citrate (clotting) bottle.
The association of MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and the development of purpura with neurological symptoms are all features of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The other
important differential diagnosis would be haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which in its
typical type is associated with diarrhoea and renal failure.
The understanding of the pathophysiology of TTP has improved following the discovery of the
role of ADAMTS-13, which is the 13th member of a family of metalloproteases. The function
of this protease is to regulate the size of the von Willebrand (VW) factor molecule by cleaving
the ultra-large polymers of VW factor once they are released into circulation. A deficiency in
ADAMTS-13 leaves high numbers of large polymers of VW factor in circulation. These polymers are prothrombotic: they adhere to vessel walls in the microcirculation of many organs
and activate passing platelets, leading to widespread platelet-rich thrombi formation.

Figure 71.1 Blood film showing thrombocytopenia and increased red cell fragments.
220

Case 71: Headache and a rash

TTP has congenital and acquired forms. The congenital form usually presents at birth and
is due to an inherited deficiency of ADAMTS-13. The acquired form is secondary to either
autoantibodies against ADAMTS-13, which leads to low levels of the enzyme, or massive
endothelial activation releasing high numbers of the large-size VW factor molecules that
exceeds the ability of the normal levels of the enzyme to regulate them.
Measurement of ADAMTS-13 serum levels would establish the diagnosis of TTP. TTP is a
medical emergency, and has a high mortality rate of 80–90%.
Plasma exchange is the treatment of choice, and it needs to be started as soon as possible.
It should not be delayed until serum ADAMTS-13 results are known.
Plasma exchange is usually done at renal units or at specialist haematology units. If the hospital where the patient has presented does not have such facilities, then plasma infusion can
be started until the patient is transferred. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be given at a high
dose; this would provide a source of functional ADAMTS-13.
KEY POINTS

• TTP is a medical emergency which can lead to rapid deterioration of a patient.
• Deficiency in the enzyme ADAMTS-13 or widespread endothelial activation which
•

exceeds its levels to regulate the size of VW factor polymers leads to widespread
platelets activation and thrombi formation in various organs.
Plasma exchange needs to be started promptly, and if not available, plasma
­infusion should be started.

Case 72: Shortness of breath and weight loss

CASE 72:

SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND WEIGHT LOSS

A 53-year-old woman presents to her local hospital with shortness of breath. This started
­yesterday after she got back home from the school where she works as a dinner lady. She
has not been coughing and has no pain in her chest. She has osteoarthritis in her wrists, for
which she takes NSAIDs. She also reports some symptoms of lethargy and weight loss over
the last six months. Occasionally she experiences sweating at night.

Examination
Her oxygen saturation is 85% on air and 96% on 5 litres of oxygen. Her temperature is 36.5°C.
She has a respiratory rate of 22 and pulse of 110. Auscultation reveals normal heart sounds
and a clear chest. Her abdominal examination reveals no organomegaly. Of note, she has
palpable lymph nodes in the cervical, axillary and inguinal areas.
INVESTIGATIONS
Chest radiograph is reported as normal. The the Emergency Department team request
a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA), which confirms a pulmonary embolus and enlarged
anterior mediastinal, pre-tracheal, hilar, para-aortic and axillary lymph nodes.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 72
The patient has hypoxia, tachycardia, and tachypnea consistent with a diagnosis of
­pulmonary embolism (PE). Absence of the typical pleuritic chest pain should not confuse
the clinicians. Based on these signs, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) needs to be
given, followed by investigations to confirm or exclude PE. Treatment of her PE with a
therapeutic dose of LMWH needs to be started even before the CTPA is done, providing
there is no contraindication.
Once anti-thrombotic treatment is started, it should be continued for six months. Initially
this is in the form of an LMWH, after which the patient is loaded with oral anticoagulation
(warfarin) until a therapeutic INR of 2–3 is reached. There is usually a bridging period of
around 48 hours when both LMWH and warfarin are used, as the onset of action of warfarin
is 36–48 hours.
Many conditions were discovered as incidental findings. This patient presented with a medical emergency but this should not distract the team from the possibility of another pathology
that may have contributed to developing a PE.
The patient has a history of B-symptoms, including night sweats, significant weight loss
(equivalent to around 10% body weight loss over six months) and lethargy.
In view of this history, and the fact that the patient has enlarged lymph nodes, the top two
differential diagnoses are lymphoma and tuberculosis. Both conditions are associated with
B-symptoms. However, malignancies increase the risk of developing a PE, which makes lymphoma the most likely diagnosis here. The most definitive way to confirm the diagnosis is to
do a biopsy of the suspected lesion. For mediastinal lesions, cardiothoracic surgeons perform
a mediastinoscopy as well as a biopsy.
While waiting for the biopsy to happen, a screening needs to be sent which includes:
• LDH, indicating the degree of cell proliferation
• Viral screening, to exclude hepatitis A, B and C and HIV infection
• Mantoux test, to screen for TB
• CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis. This is called a staging CT and its function
is to exclude further lesions or lymphadenopathy. If the patient has lymph nodes in
the neck, then the CT needs to include the neck in the staging.
This patient needs to be referred to the haematology multidisciplinary team meeting and the
haematology outpatient clinic for an urgent review. Once lymphoma is confirmed, a bone
marrow biopsy is done as part of the staging process to exclude bone marrow infiltration by
the lymphoma.
This patient will likely need chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. This will have an impact
on the metabolism of warfarin and will present a challenge in maintaining therapeutic
INR. Hence, all cancer patients on chemotherapy or radiotherapy are usually continued on
LMWH until treatment is finished or they complete six months of therapy. This is a much
safer method of anticoagulation, which does not need monitoring.

224

Case 72: Shortness of breath and weight loss

KEY POINTS

• Lymphoma can present as an incidental finding, and all suspected patients need
to be screened for presence of B-symptoms.

• Verbal reports of imaging need to be followed by formal approved reports to
ensure no pathology is missed.

• Tissue biopsy is the only test that would confirm the diagnosis of a suspected
lymphoma.

• MDT meetings are essential in the management of patients with malignancies.
•

Unnecessary delays usually happen in the diagnosis process, because of some
staging/screening tests not being done.
Referral teams need to arrange such tests while awaiting reviews by the specialists.

Case 73: Low platelets in pregnancy

CASE 73: LOW PLATELETS IN PREGNANCY
A 27-year-old woman who is 39 weeks pregnant is admitted for induction of labour. The
obstetrician seeks advice from the haematology team regarding her platelet count and
requests a platelet transfusion.
After 48 hours of induction she has failed to progress, and the team decides to do a Caesarean
section. The child is born healthy and the patient and her new baby are returned to the labour
ward. On the following morning, the mother feels well but slightly tired. She has post-­
operative blood tests.
The midwife calls the obstetrician to alert him about the results, and she asks him to take
action. He requests two units of blood transfusion for the patient. The paediatric team
assesses the newborn to discover some bruising over the body. They request urgent blood
tests.

227

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 73
The mother’s most likely diagnosis is gestational thrombocytopenia. This is common in
pregnancy, and the platelet count usually recovers after labour. The platelet count rarely
goes below 70 × 109/L. The other important differential diagnosis of low platelets in pregnancy is HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets). Hence it is important to examine the patient’s blood film for evidence of red cell haemolysis, and to perform
a haemolysis screen which includes LDH, reticulocyte count, DAT and haptoglobins. This
patient’s liver function tests, blood pressure and urinalysis (looking specifically for proteinuria) must be monitored as eclampsia can be complicated by HELLP. Other causes of
thrombocytopenia which may not be related to pregnancy include infection with HIV or
hepatitis B or C, though the patient’s status of these infections should have already been
checked at pregnancy booking.
Most surgical teams would like a normal platelet count before operating, but in fact a platelet
count of 90 × 109/L is quite safe for most operations, including a Caesarean section. Most
haematologists would recommend the following platelet counts as adequate for the respective
operations:
• Ophthalmology or neurosurgical operation, platelets greater than 100 × 109/L
• Epidural or lumbar puncture, platelets greater than 80 × 109/L
• All other surgical intervention including C-section, platelets greater than 50 × 109/L
So even if this patient needed an epidural anaesthetic, it would be quite safe with a platelet
count of 90 x 109/L. The working plan would be to not give a platelet transfusion, and to
repeat platelets daily. If the count drops to below 80 x 109/L and she is having an epidural
anaesthetic, then one pool of platelets should be given.
This patient dropped her haemoglobin level from 12.2 to 8.8 g/dL following her Caesarean
section. However, the patient is feeling well and although she might be complaining of feeling
tired, giving birth with an operation is enough to explain her symptoms. Unless she is complaining specifically of feeling dizzy or has cardiovascular compromise, she does not need a
blood transfusion. She is young and has healthy bone marrow and thus is expected to recover
her normal haemoglobin level over the next few weeks.
The management plan would be to prescribe regular oral iron supplements such as ferrous
sulphate and to check her haemoglobin level in three weeks. The iron supplement can be discontinued once the haemoglobin is back to normal.
The decision not to transfuse unless symptomatically or cardiovascularly unstable is not only
for blood unit stock conservation, but also to avoid unnecessary exposure of a young woman
to human red cell antigens. Repeated exposures through blood transfusion would put the
patient at risk of developing antibodies that could affect the foetus in any future pregnancies.
Such antibodies could cross the placenta and cause foetal haemolysis.
The newborn is most likely affected by neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT).
This condition occurs when the mother develops antibodies against human platelet antigens (HPA). The mother of a foetus with NAIT lacks the antigens which these antibodies
would bind to. The foetus inherits these antigens from his father. Hence the mother develops
antibodies and they pass through the placenta to cause thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is
confirmed by detecting these antibodies. Commonly they are anti-HPA-1a and anti-HPA-5b
in the mother. Demonstrating that these antigens are present in the baby and that the mother
228

Case 73: Low platelets in pregnancy

has the antibodies supports the diagnosis of NAIT. Thus blood samples from both mother
and baby need to be sent to the transfusion laboratory.
The first step in the management is to transfuse the baby with HPA-compatible platelets to
keep platelets above 30 × 109/L. Gradually the antibodies will be washed out of the baby’s
circulation system and the baby will recover its normal platelet counts. It is important to
perform a transcranial ultrasound scan to exclude intracranial haemorrhage.
KEY POINTS

• Gestational thrombocytopenia is a benign condition in pregnancy, but HELLP
needs to be excluded.

• Platelet transfusion should be discussed with the haematology team, but levels
•

above 50 x 10 9/L are safe for most general surgical operations.
Newborn babies with bruising need to be tested for NAIT and screened for intracranial haemorrhage.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 74
This patient has symptoms and signs consistent with anaemia. She has menorrhagia, which
could cause iron deficiency anaemia, but her pre-transfusion blood tests showed a macrocytic anaemia. Iron deficiency would cause microcytic anaemia with a low mean cell volume
(MCV). This is not a combined micro- and macrocytic anaemia, as her folate and B12 levels
are normal.
The blood film shows polychromasia (Figure 74.1). This is a result of excessive reticulocytes,
which are the cells that precede mature red cells in the maturation stages. They are larger in
size, which explains the raised MCV, and are found in peripheral circulation, usually only
when the bone marrow is under stress to produce more red cells. Nucleated red cells are
another type of cell that are usually found only in the bone marrow, and their presence confirms that the bone marrow is under stress. The blood film shows no features of hypochromic
cells typical of iron deficiency.
Bleeding, inflammation or haemolysis may explain her thrombocytosis. The isolated raised
bilirubin in addition to all of the above is suggestive of haemolysis as the cause of anaemia.
The the Emergency Department doctor rushed to give a blood transfusion without comprehensively reviewing the results. This is a common problem in busy departments where doctors are expected to make quick decisions. The diagnosis in this patient is haemolysis, and
giving a blood transfusion to such patients would not correct their pathology. It is likely that
the two units of transfusion that were given overnight were simply consumed by the haemolytic process, hence the patient’s haemoglobin levels remained the same.

Figure 74.1 Blood film showing polychromasia, thrombocytosis and some nucleated red cells.
232

Case 74: Anaemia resistant to a blood transfusion

Haemolysis can be immune or non-immune mediated. The non-immune destruction of red
cells can be mechanical, physical, chemical or associated with infections. Immune-mediated
haemolysis is caused by antibodies produced against a person’s own red cells (autoimmune)
or towards antigens introduced to the person’s body. These antigens can be introduced by
drugs or via a blood transfusion (donor red cells).
The autoimmune haemolysis can be caused by antibodies active in warm temperature (warmacting antibodies) or at cold temperatures (cold-acting antibodies). Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is the commonest form of immune haemolytic anaemia. The diagnosis is
confirmed using the Coombs’ test, also called the direct antiglobulin test (DAT). This test
detects the antibodies bound to the surface of the red cells and these antibodies can then be
analysed. Haemolysis usually takes place at the spleen, hence the spleen enlargement. As the
red cells coated with antibodies pass through the spleen, they are taken up and destroyed by
macrophages. These cells have Fc receptors for the antibodies coating the red cells.
To confirm haemolysis, the following tests are needed:
• DAT
• LDH
• Haptoglobin
• Reticulocyte count
The first step in the management is to stabilize the patient. Given that she had a low blood
pressure and tachycardia, fluid resuscitation has to be started as soon as possible. Once diagnosis is confirmed using the above tests, the definitive treatment for autoimmune haemolytic
anaemia needs to be given in the form of immunosuppression (usually starting with high
dose steroids, which are tapered once the patient is responding).
For patients who do not respond to steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig) can be
used. IV Ig is thought to work by saturating the Fc receptors of the spleen macrophages, thus
preventing the uptake and destruction of red cells.
It is worth noting that warm autoimmune haemolysis can be associated with other autoimmune diseases such as SLE or lymphoproliferative conditions such as lymphoma. Thus a
careful assessment of the patient is needed to exclude other diagnoses.
KEY POINTS

• Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia can be precipitated by infections.
• Careful assessment of the anaemia facilitates treatment and prevents unnecessary
blood transfusion.

• The haemolysis screen involves DAT, LDH, haptoglobin and a reticulocyte count.
• Knowledge of the haemolysis screen avoids delays in the diagnosis.

what is the most likely diagnosis?
3. What is the appropriate management for this patient?

236

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 75
This patient had an IgG kappa monoclonal band detected in his initial blood test. This represents excessive production of a paraprotein by a clone of plasma cells. Excessive plasma cell
proliferation causes anaemia by displacing normal bone marrow tissue, thereby affecting
haemopoiesis. Excessive paraprotein production will cause interference with bone metabolism, bony lytic lesions, accumulation in the kidneys and renal failure. This patient has no
features of end organ damage and his haemoglobin level, renal function and calcium level
are all normal. The skeletal survey, which is a series of radiographs of all the major bones in
the body, is also reported as normal with no lytic lesions, which would be seen in multiple
myeloma. In view of these results, this patient has a monoclonal gammopathy of unknown
significance (MGUS).
This patient’s pancytopenia (anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) may be a sign
of end organ damage caused by the progression of MGUS to multiple myeloma. However,
with only a small rise in M-band, this is unlikely. Confirmation of progression to multiple
myeloma requires (in addition to monoclonal IgG >20 g/L) more than 10% plasma cells in
the bone marrow, Bence Jones proteins in the urine and bony lytic lesions in around 70% of
patients. The anaemia could also be due to blood loss, and in this age group a gastrointestinal
(GI) bleed must be excluded by gastroscopy and colonoscopy.
The blood film report in this case study is crucial as it shows low numbers of platelets and low
numbers of abnormal neutrophils (Figure 75.1). These are morphological features consistent
with myelodysplasia. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of stem
cell disorders, characterized by an ineffective production of blood cells, dysplastic features

Figure 75.1 Blood film showing neutropenia, pseudo-pelger neutrophils, and hypogranulated neutrophils.
238

Case 75: Asymptomatic anaemia in the elderly

in the bone marrow and increased risk of transforming into leukaemia. Most patients who
present with MDS are over the age of sixty. Approximately 15% of patients with MDS have
had previous exposure to cytotoxic medications or radiotherapy.
A bone marrow biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis of MDS. Many patients with MDS
are elderly and can be managed conservatively with blood product support. This is usually done in the haematology day unit where patients have regular blood tests to determine
how often they need red cell transfusions. Usually if the haemoglobin level is below 8.0 g/L
(or below 10.0 g/L in patients with a history of ischaemic heart disease), the patient will
receive a red cell transfusion. Some patients may need a platelet transfusion as well. Young
patients and those who can tolerate chemotherapy need to be referred to transplant units for
a consideration of chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplant.
It is worth remembering that this patient still has MGUS and will need annual follow-up of
this M-band and any features of progression towards multiple myeloma.
KEY POINTS

• MGUS is part of the spectrum of clonal plasma cells disorders, and has the risk of
developing into multiple myeloma.

• Any change in the patient’s condition needs to be thoroughly evaluated and
should not be assumed to be a progression of his disease.

• MDS is a pre-leukaemic disorder which is treated with supportive care unless the
patient can tolerate chemotherapy.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 76
This patient has multiple myeloma (MM). He has anaemia, renal failure and hypercalcaemia,
the typical triad of MM.
His lethargy is secondary to either anaemia or renal failure. The abdominal pain is caused by
constipation, which is secondary to high calcium levels. His back pain may well be related to
lytic lesions in his spine.
Multiple myeloma is a condition caused by plasma cell clonal proliferation. The normal function of these cells is to produce immunoglobulins. Their production of these antibodies is
normally described as polyclonal, that is, antibodies which are produced by several cells,
each with its own specificity, but for the same antigen. They have slightly different epitopes to
match different parts of that one antigen.
In multiple myeloma, there is a proliferation of one clone of plasma cells, and this proliferation produces a monoclonal protein, usually described as M-band on the serum electrophoresis test. The excessive cell proliferation in the bone marrow disturbs the normal haemopoiesis
(production of blood cells). Hence anaemia and thrombocytopenia occurs.
The monoclonal protein accumulates in the kidney, causing renal failure, and the adhesion of
plasma cells to the stromal cells in the bone marrow causes secretion of osteoclast-activating
factors. It also inhibits the factors activating the osteoblast cells. This imbalance between
osteoclast and osteoblast cells leads to bone weakness.
MM is usually treated with chemotherapy. For young patients the combination of
­v incristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD) is followed by autologous stem cell
transplant. Elderly patients are treated with other drug combinations, such as melphalan
and prednisolone (MP).
A multiple myeloma screen includes (1) serum electrophoresis to detect the monoclonal
band, (2) 24 hours urine collection to quantify Bence Jones proteins (BJP), (3) serum levels
of beta-2 microglobulin, which is present on all nucleated cells and is used as a marker of
cell proliferation and hence useful in staging multiple myeloma, and (4) a full skeletal survey
which involves radiography of all the bones in the body to look for lytic lesions. Although the
abdominal radiograph has already shown evidence of bone disease in the pelvic bone in this
patient, a full skeletal survey is mandatory.
The first step of management involves correcting the hypercalcaemia and the renal failure. Hypercalcaemia can further worsen the renal failure by causing interstitial nephritis.
Hydration with intravenous fluids and giving the patient intravenous bisphosphonates will
help to reduce the calcium levels and correct the renal failure. His haemoglobin level is low,
but he does not have cardiovascular compromise, so there is no need for a blood transfusion
at this stage.
Complications of this disease include renal failure, bone disease and anaemia. The bone
­disease could cause fractures, especially in the femur, or crush fractures in the vertebrae,
which can be very dangerous and could cause spinal cord compression. MM could also
cause recurrent infections as a result of impaired antibody production. The paraprotein
could also interfere with the clotting proteins and cause acquired von Willebrand disease.
Another common complication is the development of plasmacytoma, which is a malignant
plasma cell tumour in soft tissues or in the skeleton. These may not respond to systemic
therapy (­chemotherapy) and may need local radiotherapy as a treatment. MM can also
242

Case 76: Back pain and fatigue

lead to amyloidosis, which is a diagnosis that should be suspected in any patient with MM,
­hypertension, an enlarged tongue or peripheral neuropathy.
KEY POINTS

• In patients with anaemia and renal failure, multiple myeloma always needs to be
excluded.

• The possible complications of MM include interfering with normal haemopoiesis
•

(anaemia), kidney disease, bone disease and fractures, recurrent infections, clotting abnormalities, and development of amyloidosis.
Cord compression secondary to vertebral crush fractures is a medical emergency
that doctors need to be aware of in patients with multiple myeloma.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 77
In any patient presenting with lethargy and pancytopenia (low counts of all three cell
lines, namely the red cells, white cells and platelets), acute leukaemia needs to be excluded.
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) usually present
with constitutional symptoms such as lethargy and an isolated cytopenia or pancytopenia. Normal counts may be seen in patients who are incidentally diagnosed by routine
blood tests.
A blood film is usually the test of choice to exclude acute leukaemia (Figure 77.1). Initially
a senior laboratory technician screens the blood film for blast cells. Then a haematologist
reviews the blood film. However, morphological assessment can be challenging, so if there
are any suspicious-looking cells, the blood sample can be analysed by flow cytometry to confirm the presence of blast cells.
This patient’s pancytopenia is associated with a significant macrocytosis (high MCV), which
may represent a high volume of immature red cells. This may be explained by acute leukaemia whereby blast cells (immature blood cells) increase the MCV as they are larger than
mature red cells. Other causes of pancytopenia with a raised MCV include cytotoxic drugs,
infections such as HIV, Epstein–Barr virus, myxoedema and SLE. Macrocytosis can also be
caused by thyroid abnormalities; however, the test for this patient was normal. Given the history of low BMI, dietary deficiencies also have to be ruled out.
In practice, the commonest causes of macrocytic anaemia are vitamin B12 and folate
­deficiencies. Serum levels can be checked fairly quickly. This patient was eventually found

Figure 77.1 Blood film showing severe macrocytosis, with no polychromasia, neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, or nucleated red blood cells seen. No blast cells seen.
246

Case 77: Short of breath and underweight

to have a mixture of low vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies. It is a good clinical practice to
check the haematinics (iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate) in any patient with anaemia, as
patients can have multiple deficiencies.
The replacement of the deficiencies should be done with care. If folate were given before vitamin B12, the bone marrow would be stimulated to completely deplete the body of vitamin
B12 stores. This might put the patient at risk of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal
cord. Hence, all such patients should have vitamin B12 replacement first (at least one intramuscular injection) before oral folic acid is given.
Unless the patient is significantly symptomatic, she should not have a blood transfusion.
Her anaemia will be corrected with vitamin B12 and folate replacement. It is unfortunately a
common mistake for clinicians to transfuse such patients. She is young and her bone marrow
should be healthy and able to recover once the deficiencies are corrected. She is also a women
of child-bearing age, so a blood transfusion would put her at a risk of developing antibodies
against some rare blood groups which could affect her future pregnancies and increase the
risk of her developing antibodies against her foetus’s red blood cells.
The causes of the deficiencies should be further investigated. For example, further questioning is needed regarding bowel symptoms and dietary restrictions. In the case of this patient,
a referral to counselling services regarding the perception of her body image and dietary
intake should be considered.
KEY POINTS

• Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are common causes of macrocytic anaemia.
• Severe deficiencies can cause pancytopenia.
• Replacement with B12 must precede folate treatment to avoid subacute combined
degeneration of the spinal cord.

well as a vague history of night sweats. His past medical history is significant only for chronic
back pain he has had since a road traffic accident 50 years ago.

Examination
On examination, he is afebrile with normal cardiorespiratory observations except for a raised
respiratory rate of 24. Abdominal palpation reveals a palpable 8 × 4 mass in the epigastrium.

An abdominopelvic CT scan shows a heterogeneously enhancing large retroperitoneal
mass surrounding the duodenum and pancreas with central necrosis, together with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
ACT-guided biopsy of the mass shows sheets of lymphoid cells with large lymphocytes
(three times normal size) and immunohistochemistry is positive for CD19 and CD20 (B-cell
markers).

Questions
1. What is the differential diagnosis of a retroperitoneal mass, and what further investigations are needed?
2. What is the most likely diagnosis and its pathophysiology?
3. Discuss the principles of management of this condition. What factors are prognostic?

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 78
Anatomically, the retroperitoneum is a space in the body cavity behind the peritoneum and
contains several structures, including much of the urinary tract (kidneys, adrenal glands,
ureters), part of the alimentary tract (most of the duodenum, the head, neck and body of the
pancreas, ascending and descending colon, and the rectum) and the main abdominal vessels
(aorta and inferior vena cava) and draining lymph nodes. Retroperitoneal masses may arise
from any of the above. Most commonly, however, retroperitoneal masses are lymph nodes
which are usually enlarged through either malignancy or infection.
Infectious causes of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy are rare and are generally a consequence of tuberculosis. Malignancy is a far more frequent cause, giving rise to either haematologic disorders or metastases. The latter may arise from primary tumours in any organ whose
lymphatic drainage is to para-aortic nodes, including much of the lower gastrointestinal
tract, while germ cell tumours (primary retroperitoneal tumours or metastases) are a common cause, especially in younger patients. Haematologic causes of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy include both Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The central necrotic area of
the mass in this case is suggestive of a high-grade malignancy, and in a patient of this age, a
high-grade lymphoma is most likely. Further investigations would include haematologic tests
such as LDH, the level of which is indicative of the rate of cell turnover, a blood film and a
staging CT (chest, abdomen and pelvis). Diagnostic imaging, by way of biopsy, is of absolute
importance. The deranged liver function in the above case is likely due to compression of the
biliary tree by the large mass. An ultrasound of the liver itself may be indicated if this is not
the case.
The history of symptomatic lymphadenopathy indicates the disease process to be a high-grade
lymphoma (compared to lower-grade lymphomas, which generally produce painless lymphadenopathy), and the immunohistochemistry and B-cell morphology confirm the diagnosis
of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which comprise the majority of aggressive lymphoid neoplasms and around a fifth of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.
A frequent pathogenetic event observed in DLBCL is dysregulation of bcl-6, a transcriptional repressor involved in germinal centre B-cell differentiation, while mutations in the
c-myc oncogene and t(14;18) translocations – which upregulate the anti-apoptotic protein
bcl-2 – are also involved, though the latter do not occur together with bcl-6 dysfunction.
The mainstay of treatment for DLBCL is the classic R-CHOP regimen, which incorporates
the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab with cytotoxic drugs (cyclophosphamide,
hydroxydaunorubicin [Doxorubicin] and oncovin [vincristine]) and prednisolone, a steroid.
Involved field radiotherapy may also be used, on an adjuvant basis, for localized disease.
Prognosis has traditionally been informed by the International Prognostic Index (IPI), which
incorporates age, number of extranodal sites of involvement, tumour stage, performance
status and LDH levels, with five-year survival rates of over 70% for good-risk patients and
less than 50% for poor-risk patients. More recently, gene expression profiling has identified
two molecularly distinct forms of the disease – germinal centre B-like DLBCL and activated
B-like DLBCL – that can predict prognosis, with five-year overall survival rates of 76% and
16%, respectively.

250

Case 78: A large epigastric mass

KEY POINTS

• Always suspect lymphoma in an individual with constitutional symptoms (fever,
weight loss, night sweats and fatigue) and lymphadenopathy.

• Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive lymphoid
malignancy, accounting for around 20% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.

• Tissue biopsy is absolutely required in diagnosing a lymphoma.
• Treatment for DLBCL (and many other non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas) revolves around
the use of the R-CHOP regimen.

CASE 79:

DETERIORATION AFTER A BLOOD TRANSFUSION

A 33-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department by ambulance, having been a
victim of a major road traffic accident. During assessment, the trauma surgeon identifies
an open tibial fracture from which the patient is bleeding. The patient is taken to theatre to
operate on the fracture. He gives consent and the anaesthetic team starts preparing him for
the operation. He is usually fit and well and his only significant history is a previous tonsillectomy that was complicated by excessive bleeding for which he had to receive a blood
transfusion.
The patient is transfused with one unit of blood. Some 10 minutes later the patient becomes
increasingly nauseous, short of breath, sweaty and feels dizzy. On assessment, his SpO2 is 94%
on air, respiratory rate is 26 bpm, heart rate 110 bpm, blood pressure 95/64 mmHg, temperature 38.7°C.

253

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 79
This patient has a haemolytic transfusion reaction, which is a type 2 hypersensitivity reaction
that occurs within minutes to hours of exposure to a foreign red cell antigen.
Although there are more than 400 different types of antigens found on red cells, groups ABO
and Rh are most likely to cause haemolytic transfusion reactions. Typically anti-A and anti-B
antibodies are of the IgM class (and so associated with immediate and more severe reactions),
whereas the Rh antibody (known as anti-D), which can cross the placenta during pregnancy
to cause haemolytic disease of the newborn, is class IgG.
Antibodies to the ABO system are associated with complement activation and intravascular
red cell lysis (haemolysis). Rh system reactions induce extravascular haemolysis within the
reticuloendothelial system, because Rh system antibodies cannot activate the complement
cascade. Thus, phagocytes will remove IgG-coated red cells within the reticuloendothelial
system. A peripheral blood smear would demonstrate small red cells, or spherocytes.
The timing and severity of the patient’s deterioration, as well as the clinical sign of haemoglobinuria, indicate that an acute haemolytic transfusion reaction is taking place. This
rare complication is usually caused by transfusing a patient with an incompatible red blood
cell unit; this could happen through collection errors, mislabelling by the doctor or the
laboratory, or mistaking a patient’s identity when checking blood compatibility before the
­transfusion. Such a reaction can also happen if a patient has been sensitized from a previous
blood ­transfusion. If in a blood transfusion a unit of blood containing red cell antigens is
given a patient who lacks them, antibodies against these antigens will form. If a blood unit
containing the same antigens were given any time later, the patient’s pre-formed antibodies
would react to those antigens.
The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is used in cases of suspected haemolysis, while the indirect
test is used in blood transfusion. DAT is simply a test to check for the presence of any antibodies or complement proteins on the surface of red cells. Their presence is not on its own
a confirmation that haemolysis is taking place. Some patients with autoimmune conditions
have a persistently positive DAT without any haemolysis. But in cases of proven haemolysis,
it allows the clarification of the nature of haemolysis.
In the case of this patient, he must have antibodies to the blood group of the newly transfused red cells from the donor sample. Hence, the new cells are coated with either antibodies
or complement proteins, which gives the DAT a positive result. Further tests are needed to
identify the nature of this antibody.
The blood transfusion should be immediately stopped and a new blood sample from the
patient needs to be sent to the laboratory along with the donor blood for repeated group and
cross-matching compatibility testing. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate
resuscitation, especially if the patient shows signs of shock. Intravenous fluids, piriton and
hydrocortisone must be given immediately.
The transfusion laboratory needs to be informed of the incident and the haematologist needs
to get involved in reporting this reaction to the SHOT (serious hazards of transfusion), which
is a professionally lead scheme that collects and reports data related to transfusion reactions
to enhance safety through the sharing of information.

254

Case 79: Deterioration after a blood transfusion

KEY POINTS

• Patients receiving blood transfusion should be monitored regularly for signs of a
transfusion reaction.

• Human error in identifying the patient is the most common cause of transfusionrelated hazards.

• Following a transfusion reaction, further tests are needed to identify the cause,
and reporting the case is necessary to improve safety of blood transfusion through
learning and sharing of experiences.

CASE 80:

LEG PAIN AND FEVERS

A 72-year-old woman complains of a three-month history of worsening pain in the left thigh.
The pain started as a deep ache and has gradually worsened. She reports feeling increasingly
unwell over the last month, with fatigue and fevers. She has recently returned from a trip
abroad and does not recall trauma to the leg. She also suffers from hypertension and type
2 diabetes mellitus, which is controlled by oral medication and not insulin injections.

Examination
Respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 98%, pulse 108, blood pressure 128/72, and temperature 37.8oC.
There is swelling extending from the left knee to the upper thigh. The overlying skin is dusky
brown and warm. The entire left femur is extremely tender on palpation. Hip movements
are normal, but there is restriction in left knee flexion and extension. The patient has good
peripheral pulses and no foot ulcers are noted.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 80
Pain, swelling, warmth, tenderness and immobility are the five cardinal signs of acute
­inflammation. In this patient the differential diagnosis includes cellulitis, soft tissue abscess,
septic arthritis of the knee, osteomyelitis, malignancy of either bone or soft tissue, severe
destructive osteoarthritis, ruptured Baker’s cyst, and deep vein thrombosis. The recent longdistance travel history is an important risk factor for the latter.
The raised white cells and inflammatory markers (CRP) do not accurately distinguish
between infective and inflammatory conditions (including malignancy). The very high white
blood cell count is suggestive of an abscess.
The most likely diagnosis, suggested by the MRI, is osteomyelitis, with typical findings
described above. This is supported by the blood and bone culture results.

abnormality, periosteal reaction and extensive cortical thickening extending from the distal

260

Case 80: Leg pain and fevers

Osteomyelitis requires two of the following four criteria for diagnosis:
1. Pus aspirated from affected bone
2. Positive bone or blood culture
3. Positive classic localized signs
4. Positive imaging
Osteomyelitis is an infection of bone that is characterized by progressive inflammatory
destruction with the formation of sequestra (dead pieces of bone within living bone), which
if not treated leads to new bone formation occurring on top of the dead and infected bone. It
can affect any bone, although it occurs most commonly in long bones.
Osteomyelitis is caused by two main pathophysiological events:
1. Spread from adjacent site (contiguous spread), which can be soft tissues or joints, or
direct inoculation into bone from surgery or trauma. More common in adults.
2. Spread from distant site via the bloodstream (haematogenous spread) with seeding
of the bone. More common in children.
The commonest cause of osteomyelitis is Staphylococcus aureus, although in osteomyelitis caused by contiguous spread from an open source (e.g. ulcer) it is often polymicrobial (caused by mixed organisms). The causative organism may be affected by underlying
patient conditions. For example, gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas spp.)
are more common in diabetic patients; Salmonella spp. in patients with sickle cell disease;
and ­coagulase-negative staphylococci in patients with prosthetic material in their bones or
joints.
Bone phagocytes engulf the bacteria and release osteolytic enzymes and toxic oxygen free
radicals, which lyse the surrounding bone. Pus raises intraosseus pressure and impairs
blood flow, resulting in thrombosis of the blood vessels. Ischaemia results in bone necrosis
and devitalized segments of bone (known as sequestra). These sequestra are important in
the pathogenesis of non-resolving infection, acting as an ongoing focus of infection if not
removed.
Osteomyelitis is one of the most difficult infections to treat. Treatment may require surgery
in addition to antibiotics, especially in chronic osteomyelitis where sequestra are present.
Antibiotic therapy is prolonged (weeks to months) and getting the microbial diagnosis is
extremely important in ensuring appropriate treatment. Blood cultures will be positive in
only approximately 50% of patients with osteomyelitis. Direct sampling of the bone should
be attempted wherever possible in adults, particularly in chronic osteomyelitis.
Initial treatment for acute osteomyelitis is usually empiric, especially if the patient is
systemically unwell and antibiotics cannot be delayed for a microbiologic diagnosis.
Intravenous empirical treatment should always cover the common organisms, taking into
account individual patient factors. Treatment may be changed once culture results are
available.
Poorly controlled diabetics are at increased risk of infections, and having an infection leads
to poor control of diabetes via altered physiology occurring during infection. Diabetics are
prone to developing foot ulcers, which in turn are prone to becoming infected, which then
act as a source of bacteria for infecting the contiguous bones of the feet. This process is exacerbated in patients with peripheral neuropathy, poor diabetic control and peripheral vascular disease, as these all increase the risk of development of skin breakdown and subsequent
osteomyelitis.

tory destruction with the formation of sequestra (dead pieces of bone within living
bone). A sequestrum is caused by ischaemic necrosis to a piece of bone, causing
it to die. The ischaemic necrosis is caused by raised intraosseus pressure, which in
turn is caused by pus collecting in the bone.
The commonest organism is Staphylococcus aureus. Gram negative bacteria
including Pseudomonas affects diabetics; Salmonella affects patients with sickle
cell disease, and staphylococci affects patients with prostheses.
Bacteria causing osteomyelitis can be spread from adjacent sites (contiguous
spread), or from distant sites via the blood.
Diabetes is an important risk factor where skin breakdown and ulcers can act as a
source of infection.

What is the differential diagnosis?
What is the pathogenesis of this disease?
What is the value of the echocardiogram in diagnosis?
What is the treatment?

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 81
The blood results clearly show raised inflammatory markers (CRP, WBC), therefore
­suggesting an infective or inflammatory process. Her fever indicates that an infective cause
is more probable. The petechiae suggest a systemic process of infection or vasculitis but may
be from a fall, although their distribution on the body makes this unlikely. The petechiae
on her hands may be one of the cutaneous manifestations of IE, which are caused either by
embolisation of the infected vegetation or immunologic phenomena. There are findings on
examination and investigations suggesting the source may be from the heart (endocarditis)
or the shoulder (septic arthritis). The findings of the echocardiogram make infective endocarditis (IE) the most likely diagnosis.
IE is infection of the inner lining of the heart, the endocardium. This includes the heart
valves, their supporting structures, intraventricular septa and the walls of the heart. Strictly
speaking it also includes the endothelium of the intrathoracic great vessels and any intracardiac foreign bodies, such as prosthetic valves or pacemaker wires.
Two factors are necessary for bacterial colonization of a valve to take place:
1. Valvular damage: this can occur from turbulent blood flow, congenital heart
disease, prosthetic valves, previous endocarditis, physical manipulation, the
particulate material of intravenous drug user’s injections, and degeneration.
Degenerative valves make the incidence of IE three times higher in the elderly
population.
2. An inflammatory reaction to the exposed and damaged valvular endothelium
results in the deposition of platelets and fibrin. Circulating bacterial colonies grow
on these platelet-fibrin clots to form vegetations which are relatively resistant to host
immune defences.
In the general population left-sided valves are predominantly affected, most often the mitral
valve. Right-sided valve involvement forms less than 10% of IE, and has a lower mortality
than left-sided disease. Right-sided IE is more common to cohorts of intravenous drug users,
congenital heart disease and in patients with pacemakers.
On account of their resistance to complement and their propensity to adhere to damaged valvular endothelium, more than 80% of microbes responsible for endocarditis are
gram-positive, namely streptococci, staphylococci, and enterococci. Coagulase-negative
staphylococci more commonly causes prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). Native valve
endocarditis (NVE) has a mortality of up to 30%, with Staphylococcus aureus infection
displaying more pathogenicity than oral streptococci species. PVE has a higher mortality
than NVE.
There are underlying risk factors that assist in determining the likely pathogen. Poor dentition, recent dental procedures and other maxillofacial pathology make oral streptococci
more likely. Skin lesions, recent trauma or surgery, intravenous drug use or presence of a
vascular access device make staphylococci more likely. Bowel and urological pathology, or
endocarditis in patients who are severely debilitated and have had multiple courses of broadspectrum antibiotics, makes enterococci more likely. A noteworthy association is Strep. bovis
with colon cancer in elderly patients.
A causative organism will be identified in 90% of cases if two separate sets of blood
­cultures are taken 30 minutes apart. It is imperative to take blood cultures before antibiotics are started, which was not done in this scenario. Antibiotics are the leading cause
266

Case 81: Fever and collapse

of negative blood cultures. Other causes of culture-negative endocarditis include the
­fastidious ­g ram-negative bacteria of the HACEK group (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter,
Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and Bartonella spp. Each
of these three groups is responsible for up to 3% of endocarditis in England and Wales.
All patients with suspected IE must have a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which
detects valvular vegetations with a sensitivity of approximately 70–80%. If this is negative
or there is still a high index of clinical suspicion, a transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE)
is indicated, which has a sensitivity of 90–100%. If a prosthetic valve or intracardiac device
is present, a TOE is strongly recommended, as the sensitivity of the TTE is low. A follow-up
echocardiogram is required at the end of antibiotic treatment to assess valve and cardiac
function.
The mainstay of treatment is a prolonged course of antibiotics. About 50% of patients
will require surgical intervention to remove the infected area, as host defences in heart
valves are relatively ineffective. Reasons for surgical intervention are divided into 3 broad
groups:
1. Uncontrolled infection (not responding to antibiotic therapy, a perivalvular abscess,
PVE, most gram-negative and fungal IE)
2. Prevention of embolism (very large vegetations, signs of emboli)
3. Heart failure or severe valve regurgitation
KEY POINTS

• Infective endocarditis is infection of the inner lining of the heart, the endocardium.
• A causative organism is usually identified if blood cultures are taken before antibiotics are started.

• More than 80% of microbes responsible are gram positive, namely staphylococci,
oral streptococci and enterococci.

269

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 82
This patient has the features of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). Recent onset
fever and back pain suggest an upper UTI.
UTIs are classified by anatomy into lower and upper UTIs. Lower UTIs refer to infections
at or below the level of the bladder, and include cystitis, ­urethritis, prostatitis, and epididymitis (the latter three being more often sexually transmitted). Upper UTIs refer to infection
above the bladder, and include the ureters and kidneys. Infection of the urinary tract above
the bladder is known as pyelonephritis. UTIs are also classified as complicated or uncomplicated. UTIs in men, the elderly, pregnant women, those who have an indwelling catheter, and
anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract are considered to be complicated.
A complicated UTI will often receive longer courses of broader spectrum antibiotics.
Importantly, the clinical history alone of dysuria and frequency (without vaginal discharge)
is associated with more than 90% probability of a UTI in healthy women.
Urine dipsticks are one of the most widely used tests, although interpreting the results is
not simple. A positive result for both nitrites and leukocyte esterase has a higher sensitivity than a positive result for only one of the two. Nitrites are not normally found in the
urine but are produced by the action of certain (but not all) bacteria on urinary nitrate.
A positive leucocyte esterase test indicates the presence of neutrophils, a marker of infection.
This ­infection may be a UTI, but may also be caused by other infections of the genito-urinary
tract. Collecting urine for microscopy, culture and sensitivity (MC&S) is the gold standard
for diagnosing a UTI.
In women, a UTI develops when urinary pathogens from the bowel or vagina colonize the
urethral mucosa, and ascend via the urethra into the bladder. During an uncomplicated
symptomatic UTI in women, it is rare for infection to ascend via the ureter into the kidney
to cause pyelonephritis.
Risk factors for a UTI include being female (shorter urethra that is close to the anus), previous UTI, a urinary catheter, intercourse (which promotes movement of organisms up the
urethra), use of spermicides, and new sex partners.
UTI in men is uncommon, and usually occurs secondary to an underlying structural
or functional abnormality of the urogenital tract resulting in obstruction to urine flow.
The c­ ommonest of these is prostate enlargement.
Bacteria causing UTI have enhanced virulence through structures such as P. fimbriae,
which promote attachment to the uroepithelium. Escherichia coli causes 80–90% of
­community-acquired UTI. By contrast, only 40% of healthcare-associated UTIs are caused
by E. coli. The remainder are largely due to other enteric gram-negative bacteria such as
Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia and Pseudomonas species.
Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcal aureus and enterococci may also cause
­healthcare-associated UTIs.
Most healthcare-associated UTIs are associated with the use of urinary catheters. Each day
the catheter remains in situ, the risk of UTI rises by around 5%. Thus inserting catheters
only when absolutely needed, and ensuring they are removed as soon as possible, can prevent
these. In catheterized patients, the catheter becomes colonized with organisms sticking to
its surface. These ascend into the bladder more easily as the urethral defences are bypassed.
270

Case 82: Burning sensation when passing urine

Proteus species is associated with kidney stones as it produces the enzyme urease, which
converts urea into ammonia, subsequently making the urine more alkaline, favouring stone
development.
Complications of a UTI include:
• Recurrent cystitis in women, caused by reinfection rather than dormancy of pathogens in the uroepithelium or by ineffective treatment. There is no association
between recurrent urinary tract infection and urinating habits, use of tampons,
precoital or postcoital voiding patterns and daily fluid intake.
• Pyelonephritis, caused by bacterial migration from the bladder (via the ureters) to
the kidneys. This may be life threatening or lead to permanent kidney damage if not
promptly treated.
• Sepsis, which can be caused by bacteria entering the blood stream.
Up to 40% of uncomplicated lower UTIs in women will resolve spontaneously without antimicrobial therapy. The use of antibiotics in this cohort is controversial when taking into
account the side effects of antibiotics and their effect on normal flora. If prescribed, antibiotics
for uncomplicated lower UTIs should be narrow-spectrum, such as trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin. Resistance to trimethoprim is very high in certain areas. Complicated and upper
UTIs require a longer course of a more broad-spectrum antibiotic such as ­co-amoxyclav,
quinolones or aminoglycosides.
KEY POINTS

• Escherichia coli causes 80–90% of community-acquired UTI.
• Urine dipsticks are widely used, but their results must be interpreted with caution
as a significant number of false positive and false negative results can occur.

• An uncomplicated lower UTI is treated with a narrow-spectrum antibiotic for a
•

short course. A complicated or upper UTI requires a longer course of a broadspectrum antibiotic.
Most healthcare-associated UTIs are associated with the use of urinary catheters.
Each day the catheter remains in situ, the risk of UTI rises by around 5%.

ANSWER 83
Dyspnoea, productive cough, fever and raised inflammatory markers point towards a lower
respiratory tract infection (LRTI). The common LRTIs presenting in the community are
acute bronchitis, acute exacerbations of COPD and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
Acute bronchitis involves infection of the large airways, namely the tracheobronchial tree.
More than 90% of the time, this is due to either upper respiratory tract viruses (rhinovirus,
coronavirus) or lower respiratory tract viruses (influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus). Bacterial causes account for <10% of acute
bronchitis.
Acute exacerbation of COPD occurs as a sudden worsening of COPD symptoms with
increased purulence and volume of sputum.
Pneumonia is infection of the lung tissue, including alveoli and terminal bronchioles. It can
be classified as lobar or broncho-pneumonia, depending upon its anatomic distribution.
Classically, lobar pneumonia occurs in a single lobe and is limited by the anatomic boundaries of that lobe, while bronchopneumonia is patchy, bilateral and not limited by anatomy.
Distinct from bronchopneumonia, multi-lobar pneumonia can occur when the infection
affects more than one anatomically-defined lobe.
The incidence of CAP in the general community is 5–11 per 1000 of the population, with
higher incidence in patients who are asplenic, immunocompromised, diabetic or alcoholic.
The incidence is also higher in children younger than two years and adults more than
65 years old. In the elderly population of the UK, CAP is a leading cause of death from
infection.
Up to 40% of all CAP is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, most commonly in winter.
Other causes include Haemophilus influenzae (10%,); atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma
pneumoniae (11%, occurring in epidemics in winter every four years) and Chlamydophila
pneumoniae (13%); and viruses (13%). Staphylococcus aureus may cause CAP in those with
risk factors such as HIV infection or recent influenza infection. Although less common than
bacterial causes, viruses such as influenza virus can also be responsible for causing viral
pneumonia.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a colonizer of the upper respiratory tract and
invasion into the lower respiratory tract requires either reduced host defence or increased
bacterial evasion of the host immune system. All pathogens have virulence factors encoded
by genes that enhance survival in the respiratory epithelium. Pneumococcus has over 100
genes encoding virulence factors, the strongest of which is the polysaccharide capsule. This
helps the bacterium to evade phagocytosis by inhibiting the complement cascade of the innate
immune system and preventing mucosal clearance by cilia. Examples of reduced defence
include immune suppression such as damage to the respiratory cilia from recent influenza or
smoking, older age, and HIV.
Once in the lower respiratory tract, inflammation and damage to the mucosa leads to fluid
accumulation in the alveoli, which reduces the surface available for respiration, therefore
resulting in hypoxia. This alveolar fluid is what is seen on the chest radiograph as consolidation.
To establish the severity of disease, predict mortality and guide treatment, clinical judgement
and severity scoring systems have been used to good effect. In the UK, the British Thoracic
Society (BTS) recommends the use of the CURB-65 score. The score awards one point for
274

Case 83: A bit short of breath

each of Confusion, Urea >7 mmol/L, Respiratory rate >30/min, low systolic (<90 mmHg) or
diastolic (<60 mmHg) Blood pressure, and age 65 years or older. This score stratifies patients
according to increasing risk of mortality or need for hospital admission. A score of 0 is associated with 0.7% mortality, score 1 = 3.2%, score 2 = 13%, score 3 = 17%, score 4 = 41.5%, and
score 5 = 57%. Hospitalization is generally required for a score of 2 or above, which occurs in
around 40% of patients with CAP.
Microbiological identification is crucial before antibiotic treatment. For patients with moderate or high severity CAP (CURB-65 score of 2 or more), the BTS recommends collecting
blood cultures and sputum samples for MC&S and a pneumococcal urine antigen test. Blood
cultures are required as pneumococci can cause invasive disease that has a higher morbidity and mortality than pneumonia alone. Molecular testing (PCR) of respiratory samples is
preferable to serological investigations for atypical pathogens and viruses. All culture samples should be collected prior to commencing antimicrobial therapy to avoid false negative
cultures.
Penicillin is the treatment of choice for a fully sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. Macrolides are used in penicillin-allergic patients. Increasing resistance, however, has
led to the need to use more broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or respiratory
quinolones. A pneumococcal vaccination is offered to high-risk patients.
KEY POINTS

• Pneumonia involves infection of the alveoli and terminal bronchioles. It can be
classified as lobar or broncho-pneumonia.

• Up to 40% of all CAP is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, most commonly
•

in winter. Streptococcus pneumoniae has a propensity to cause invasive disease,
which has a higher mortality than pneumonia alone.
Penicillins or macrolides are commonly used to treat pneumococcal pneumonia,
depending on susceptibility of the isolate.

CASE 84:

UNHAPPY CAMPER

A 27-year-old woman presents with a two-day history of flu-like symptoms, headache, joint
pains and generalized tiredness. She hadn’t noticed any rash.
She lives in London and went camping in the Lake District with a group of friends two weeks
ago. They went on extended walks in areas of long grass and because it was hot, walking in
sandals and shorts most of the time. Some of the group noticed ticks on their legs at the end
of a day’s walking and removed them promptly.

Examination
Temperature 39.8°C, respiratory rate 16, pulse 142 beats per minute, blood pressure 121/92.
She is found to have a bull’s eye or ‘target-like’ rash with clearing around the central area
on her posterior upper arm, as shown in Figure 84.1. She also has some cervical lymphadenopathy. She doesn’t remember removing any ticks from her arm during the trip. There
are no other lesions found. Although she complains of joint pains, no significant pathology is found on musculoskeletal examination. Aside from the tachycardia, her cardiorespiratory examination is normal. She has no signs of meningitis or other nervous system
involvement.
INVESTIGATIONS
Routine blood investigations are all within normal range.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 84
Given the travel history, tick exposure and typical rash, the most likely diagnosis is Lyme
disease. Most people present 3–30 days after the bite with flu-like symptoms and a typical
expanding, circular, target-like rash, which if left untreated will disappear within weeks to
months. This is early, localized Lyme disease.
The typical rash, called erythema migrans, is red and expands around the site of the
tick bite. Parts of the rash clear as it expands, leaving the typical ‘target’ or ‘bulls-eye’
lesion.
Other causes of similar lesions include:
• Erythema multiforme, which is caused by a cell-mediated immune reaction to drugs
(antiepileptics, antibiotics, anaesthetic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)
or infections (e.g. herpes, mycoplasma). Usually presents with a generalized blotchy
itchy rash.
• Ringworm (tinea) infection, a fungal infection occurring anywhere on the body. Its
appearance is raised and scaly, and it is very itchy.
• Pityriasis rosea, a viral rash common in young women. Lesions are oval, slightly
raised, mainly on trunk and have a beige/brown colouring. They have a central
clearing and are usually itchy. Rash is symmetrical on the body and often referred
to as ‘fir tree’ in appearance.
Lyme is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere,
occurring in North America, Asia and Europe. It is caused by a spirochete (spiralshaped bacterium), Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted by the bite of the hard-bodied tick,
Ixodes.
Transmission occurs during feeding when the tick injects the spirochete into the skin at the
bite site. This is slow and transmission is unlikely to occur unless the tick remains feeding
for at least 36 hours. Rapid removal of ticks can prevent disease. The nymphs are tiny (poppy
seed) so close inspection is needed to make sure they are removed. Most infections are due to
bites by nymphs as they are hard to see.
The spirochetes in the skin multiply, spreading outwards from the infection site. The immune
reaction to the bacteria in the skin causes the typical circular rash, identifying the spreading
bacteria.
Diagnosis is based on clinical and epidemiologic criteria, including visiting a known endemic
area, exposure to ticks and a typical rash. Unfortunately not all cases give a definite history
of tick exposure, and not all rashes are typical in nature. Laboratory tests may be necessary
to confirm the diagnosis.
The most commonly used test is serology screening for antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi. Antibodies will be produced only after exposure to the spirochete. If tested too
early the result can be negative, as it takes weeks to produce enough antibodies to be
­measured. A second sample 2–4 weeks later will show ‘sero-conversion’ from a negative
to positive result, implying recent infection. The test can also be ‘falsely’ positive, that is,
have a positive result in a person without infection. This occurs because the test crossreacts with other infections or diseases, such as syphilis, glandular fever, and rheumatoid
arthritis. All positive results require repeat testing to confirm the result. Polymerase chain
280

Case 84: Unhappy camper

reaction (PCR) can be used to test for Borrelia burgdorferi DNA in specimens of skin or
joint fluid.
If left untreated, spirochetes will invade the bloodstream and spread to other sites. This is
termed early generalized Lyme disease and is characterized by
• Lyme arthritis, which usually affects the knees
• Nervous system effects, including meningitis, facial nerve palsy or other neuropathies with shooting pains
• Carditis, with abnormal heart rhythms
If still untreated or inadequately treated this can develop into late persistent Lyme disease
with destructive lesions and chronic, severe symptoms.
Treatment is with antibiotics, the type and duration depending on age of patient, presentation and severity of the disease. The antibiotics commonly used are doxycycline, amoxicillin
or ceftriaxone.
Exposure to infectious agents is prevented by avoiding tick bites and wearing long socks,
trousers and long sleeves, using insect repellents, and quickly removing ticks before they are
able to transmit infection. Vaccination is not available.
KEY POINTS

• Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in the northern hemisphere, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.

• Clinical and epidemiologic criteria are often enough to make a diagnosis if typical.
•
•

Early Lyme disease most commonly presents with flu-like symptoms and erythema
migrans.
Serology is the laboratory test of choice, but repeat tests may be needed if done
too early in the infection, and confirmation of positive tests are needed to exclude
false positive reactions.
Prevention of Lyme disease requires public awareness of avoiding tick bites, and
early tick removal.

DIARRHOEA IN AN ELDERLY MAN

An 80-year-old man living in a care home presents to the Emergency Department with a
four-day history of cramping abdominal pain and watery, non-bloody diarrhoea. He denies
vomiting and states his diarrhoea has been worsening with five episodes of loose stool in the
past 24 hours. All of his meals are provided by the care home. No other care home residents
are symptomatic. He has no recent travel history.
He is being treated for a catheter-associated urinary tract infection with co-amoxyclav by his
GP. He had colon cancer, for which he had a partial colectomy one year ago. His medication
includes aspirin and a proton pump inhibitor.

Examination
Temperature 38.1°C, oxygen saturation 95%, respiratory rate 18, pulse 112, blood pressure
100/65 mmHg.
He has signs of mild dehydration. His abdomen is mildly distended and tender but there are
no signs of guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are active. There is no organomegaly. His urinary catheter is draining straw-coloured urine. Rectal examination reveals
a large prostate and diarrhoeal stool with no evidence of blood.

283

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 85
The most likely cause of this elderly gentleman’s watery, non-bloody diarrhoea is Clostridium
difficile bacterial gastroenteritis given the very high peripheral white cell count and raised
inflammatory markers (C-RP) associated with the following risk factors: recent hospital
admission, living in a care home, antibiotic therapy, bowel surgery and being on proton
pump inhibitors. Important negative features of the history include no travel, not eating-out
and no illness in other care home residents.
C. difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is carried in the gut of some people.
It causes disease (pseudomembranous colitis) through production of toxins that damage the
colonic mucosa. In severe disease it can lead to toxic megacolon, bowel perforation and death.
The differential diagnosis of watery diarrhoea includes:
• Viral – enterovirus, rotavirus (usually in children) and norovirus (in which vomiting is almost always present)
• Bacterial – Campylobacter spp., C. difficile, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella sp.,
Shigella sp. (usually bloody diarrhoea), Vibrio cholera (associated with contact or
travel to endemic areas)
• Parasitic – Giardia lamblia (appropriate travel history required) or cryptosporidium
in the immunocompromised or young children
• Toxins (which have the shortest incubation period after exposure) – staphylococcal
food poisoning, Bacillus cereus toxin or enterotoxogenic E. coli
• Non-infectious causes – alcohol excess, lactose intolerance or inflammatory bowel
disease
Investigations of watery diarrhoea must include a stool sample sent for:
• MC&S for bacterial causes
• PCR testing looking for viral causes
• Ova, cysts and parasites
• C. difficile toxin testing as only toxin-producing strains cause disease. Culture
methods for C. difficile are slow and no longer used for diagnosis.
Blood cultures are taken to exclude urinary sepsis and gram-negative sepsis. The latter could
indicate a perforation of the gut or leakage of bowel contents that would indicate severe
colonic disease.
Treatment is based on removing as many risk factors as possible and treating with oral antibiotics (metronidazole or vancomycin) depending on severity of disease and local hospital
policy. In severe or life-threatening cases, surgical management may also be required (colectomy). In chronic or recurrent cases, alternate therapy includes probiotics, faecal enemas
and fidoxamicin.
Prevention is by eliminating risk factors thereby reducing the likelihood of developing
disease. Reduced transmission from person to person requires hand washing with soap
and water after every contact with a patient having diarrhoea. Alcohol hand rub does
not destroy the spores and is therefore not sufficient to prevent spread. All patients with
C. difficile should be isolated because its spores are hardy and easily contaminate the
environment. This is why environmental cleaning plays an important role in controlling
outbreaks.

287

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 86
Differential diagnosis of a unilateral swollen knee/monoarthritis:
1. Septic arthritis
2. Crystal-induced arthritis
a. Gout – uric acid crystals
b. Pseudogout – calcium pyrophosphate crystals
c. Other – calcium oxalate
3. Osteoarthritis
4. Reactive arthritis (autoimmune). Reaction to infection in another part of the body,
e.g. Reiter’s syndrome. Usually more than a single large joint involved
5. Traumatic arthritis
6. Haemarthrosis – bleeding into the knee. Occurs with minor trauma in haemophiliacs
Examination of the joint fluid is often required to aid the diagnosis. The gold standard for
diagnosis of septic arthritis is joint aspiration to identify an organism. In some instances this
may be difficult and image-guided aspiration is recommended. The samples should be sent
for microscopy, culture and sensitivity, TB culture (if clinically indicated) and molecular
testing (PCR) if the patient has already started antibiotics. The microscopy will give an initial
result of the cell count and a gram stain. The cell count will identify whether white blood
cells (indicating inflammation or infection) or red blood cells (indicating haemarthrosis)
are present. The gram stain may identify organisms present in the fluid. Specialized microscopy is required to look for crystals. Microscopy is fairly quick and cheap. However, it is not
very sensitive in identifying the pathogen (50% sensitivity). These initial results could guide
empiric therapy while waiting for culture results for a more targeted therapy. In instances
where antibiotics are given prior to the aspiration, organisms may be seen but will not grow
on the culture media. When this occurs, molecular tests (e.g. 16s PCR) could help identify
the organism.
In this patient, aspiration was performed and the microscopy showed a high white blood
cell count and gram-positive cocci in clusters and chains. Culture results the next day grew
Staphylococcus aureus. Microscopy for crystals was negative.
Septic arthritis is an infection of the joint space, and is most often mono-articular. It carries
significant morbidity to the patient and could lead to the destruction of the infected joint. It
can also extend into the bone, leading to osteomyelitis. Septic arthritis is most commonly
due to bacterial infection, but may occasionally be caused by mycobacteria, fungi or viruses.
There are many predisposing factors for septic arthritis and these include age, prosthetic
joints, diabetes mellitus, underlying arthritis and recent procedures to the affected joint. The
commonest route of infection is haematogenous spread; however, direct inoculation of bacteria to the joint following procedures or trauma is also common. Septic arthritis is caused
by many pathogens, the commonest of which is S. aureus, followed by streptococci. In sexually active young adults it is important to consider gonococcal arthritis caused by Neisseria
gonorrhoeae. The usual presentation is that of a painful, warm, red and swollen joint, the
commonest site being the knee.
Treatment of septic arthritis requires appropriate surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy.
Treatment with antibiotics is usually for a prolonged period. Patients are usually kept for a
minimum of two weeks of parenteral antibiotics that are then switched to an oral option for
288

Case 86: A painful knee

a further two weeks. Duration will vary depending on pathogen isolated and response to
treatment.
Radiography is usually normal on admission. However, it must always be done to monitor
changes and to have a point of comparison. Surgical drainage and washout also form part of
the management to reduce the burden of infection in the joint.
KEY POINTS

• Septic arthritis is an infection of a joint, usually caused by S. aureus and usually
mono-articular.

• Predisposing factors for septic arthritis include age, prosthetic joints, diabetes
mellitus, underlying arthritis and recent procedures to the affected joint.

• The most common route of infection is haematogenous spread.

Case 87: A pain in the ear

CASE 87:

A PAIN IN THE EAR

A 55-year-old woman presents with a painful left ear, having returned from France one week
ago, where she swam in the local river on a daily basis. Since returning, she has noticed an
itch in her left ear and has regularly tried to relieve it using cotton ear buds and later eardrops
from the pharmacy. This itch turned into an ache and she noticed the cotton ear bud looked
a ‘dirty brown’. The ache worsened and she now also has what feels to her like a ‘blocked ear’.
She has no history of headache, facial weakness, difficulty swallowing or fever.
The patient has no significant medical history.

Examination
General examination was unremarkable. She was apyrexial and had no cervical
lymphadenopathy.
Examination of the left ear reveals a red and swollen external auditory canal with a yellowish
crusting discharge. The auditory canal is narrowed but the tympanic membrane is visible and
looks normal. The pain is made worse by pulling on the pinna (earlobe) and pushing on the
tragus of the left ear. There is no redness, swelling or tenderness on any other area of the ear
or surrounding tissues.
Her voice is normal and she has no abnormalities of her cranial nerves.
INVESTIGATIONS
Microbiology
Swabs of the external auditory canal were sent for MC&S and fungal culture. Culture grew
a mixed growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Fungal
­culture was negative.

Questions
1. What is the clinical diagnosis?
2. What are the predisposing factors and commonest cause of this condition?
3. What is the treatment?

291

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 87
The diagnosis is acute otitis externa (AOE), also known as ‘swimmer’s ear’. AOE is distinguished from chronic otitis externa by the pathogenesis and duration of symptoms, with the
former of 3–6 weeks duration and the latter >3 months. Otitis externa is defined as inflammation of the external auditory canal, usually with secondary infection. It is similar to ­cellulitis
of skin and soft tissue elsewhere. It is a common condition and is responsible for up to 20%
of referrals to ENT clinics.
This patient has a number of predisposing factors which put her at risk of developing AOE:
regular exposure to water (swimming); trauma to the external auditory canal from foreign
bodies in the ear, namely cotton ear buds; and ear drops (especially if used after being previously opened). Eczema or other inflammatory skin conditions can predispose to chronic or
recurrent infection.
Most cases of acute and chronic OE are caused by bacterial infection, the commonest pathogen being P. aeruginosa. Another common bacterium is S. aureus. Fungal infection such as
Candida sp. and Aspergillus niger may be found in the chronically infected external ear canal.
The pathogenesis of AOE is related to many factors coming together at the same time. Earwax
has a protective mechanism in the ear by protecting against water and keeping the pH slightly
acidic in order to inhibit bacterial growth. Removal of the wax by cleaning reduces this protective mechanism. Cleaning the ear, earphones and hearing aids can also cause trauma,
increasing the risk of infection. Water exposure, alkaline eardrops and soap also act to reduce
the protective acidity. Other factors such as eczema, allergies and excess sweating have also
been associated with AOE. The pathogenesis of chronic otitis externa is usually secondary
to chronic irritation from a chronically draining otitis media with a perforated eardrum.
Treatment is therefore aimed at treating the otitis media.
Treatment of the acute episode is with a combination of aural toilet (medical ear cleaning)
and topical antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics are indicated only if the infection extends beyond
the ear canal to surrounding structures. Topical steroids reduce inflammation and can be
combined with topical antibiotics.
Complications of AOE include recurrent infection and chronic otitis externa. The most
severe complication is malignant otitis externa, which is a necrotising extension of infection
into the surrounding tissue and bones at the base of the brain, with possible further extension
to the cranial nerves and brain. This complication is more common in the elderly, diabetics,
immune compromised and those on radiotherapy. Treatment of this complication requires
long-term systemic antibiotics and possibly surgery to remove infected bone.
KEY POINTS

• Acute otitis externa (‘swimmer’s ear’) is characterized by localized itching, reduced

292

hearing, and pain, especially on moving the pinna and tragus (with or without a
discharge).
The most common pathogen causing AOE is P. aeruginosa.
Pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes removal of protective earwax, trauma
and excessive moisture in the ear canal.
Treatment of AOE is topical antibiotics.

Case 88: A red eye

CASE 88:

A RED EYE

A 27-year-old man presents with a red and painful left eye. He complains that when he
wakes in the morning the eyelid of his left eye is stuck together and he has noticed his eyelid
looks a bit swollen. He says a few days ago he felt an irritation, and thought he might have
something in his eye, but couldn’t see anything. He doesn’t remember any specific trauma to
the eye. He hasn’t been swimming and hasn’t used any eye drops recently. He has noticed a
few people at work with ‘pink eye’ but hasn’t had intimate contact with any of them. He says
his vision is normal, although bright light is uncomfortable, and he hasn’t noticed any redness or rash on his face other than inside his eye. He has had no urethral discharge and is in
a monogamous sexual relationship. He has no significant medical history.

Examination
General examination was unremarkable. He is apyrexial and his vital signs are normal.
As shown in Figure 88.1, his left eye is noted to be sensitive to light on examination. There is
a watery discharge present. The conjunctiva is erythematous and mildly oedematous with a
few small subconjunctival haemorrhages in the periphery. There is no membrane present on
the conjunctiva. He has pre-auricular lymphadenopathy, but no submandibular or cervical
lymph nodes are palpable.

293

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 88
An acute red eye can be caused by many conditions and a history and examination should
guide the differential diagnosis. The following are common causes to consider.
1. Acute conjunctivitis, which can be viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic, mycobacterial
or chlamydial
2. Other eye conditions
a. Anterior uveitis – inflammation of the anterior structures of the uvea (the pigmented vascular inner layer of the eye comprising the iris, ciliary body and
choroid)
b. Corneal ulcer
c. Acute closed-angle glaucoma
d. Trauma with subconjunctival haemorrhage
3. Systemic conditions presenting with red eyes
a. Allergic conjunctivitis – other signs of atopy should be present
b. Measles – commonly presenting with rash, coryza, conjunctivitis and cough
c. Episcleritis and scleritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease and connective tissue diseases
The most likely diagnosis is an acute viral conjunctivitis, commonly known as ‘pink eye’.
It is unilateral on presentation but often spreads to infect the other eye. In its mildest form it
is associated with a watery discharge, redness of the eye and eye irritation, but not significant
pain. If severe pain is present other diagnoses should be sought.
The commonest cause of conjunctivitis is viral which is often associated with pre-auricular
lymphadenopathy. Adenoviruses, coxsackieviruses and herpes viruses (HSV, VZV) are the
commonly associated viruses.
In this case a more specific diagnosis to consider is acute epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis,
caused by specific strains of adenovirus. It spreads by contact or respiratory fomites and
occurs most notably in schools, places of work and institutions, where it can lead to significant outbreaks. It is more severe than other forms of adenoviral conjunctivitis and can cause
marked eye pain and damage to both the conjunctiva and cornea that can lead to permanent
scarring.
Bacterial conjunctivitis differs clinically in that there is usually a muco-purulent discharge
and matting of the eyelids; lymphadenopathy is uncommon and there is often an associated
traumatic process predisposing to infection.
The common bacterial causes include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and
Streptococcus pneumoniae, the latter two being more common in children than adults.
Neisseria gonorhoeae causes a severe conjunctivitis and is associated with conjunctivitis in
neonates born to infected mothers and sexually active adults. There is copious discharge,
swelling of the conjunctiva, marked pain and (atypically for bacterial conjunctivitis) preauricular lymphadenopathy. Chlamydia trachomatis is also associated with neonatal and sexually transmitted conjunctivitis. This causes a milder infection with less discharge and pain
in the eye, but can lead to severe complications and corneal scarring with associated visual
defects. In neonates it is associated with chlamydial pneumonia and therefore will require
systemic as well as topical treatment.
Most cases of conjunctivitis are viral and investigation is not necessary unless there are
complications or the infection is non-resolving. If this is the case, or if bacterial (or other
294

Case 88: A red eye

non-viral) cause is suspected, appropriate swabs should be sent to the laboratory for MC&S
and/or molecular testing (PCR) for viruses and Chlamydia sp.
Investigation is always indicated in neonatal conjunctivitis, as distinguishing between C. trachomatis, N. gonorhoeae and more common bacterial causes determines treatment of the
neonate and the mother and partner(s).
Most cases of viral conjunctivitis resolve spontaneously without any treatment. In more
severe disease such as acute epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis treatment is aimed at relieving
symptoms and preventing spread. Patients are infectious for approximately 10–14 days after
onset. If vision is affected, topical steroids may be helpful, but steroids should be prescribed
only after consultation with a specialist as these can worsen the infection. If a membrane is
present removal of this prior to the steroids may improve vision, but may lead to superficial
bleeding on removal.
Bacterial and chlamydial conjunctivitis should always be treated with appropriate antibiotics. In most cases topical treatment is sufficient. The exceptions are that of neonatal
C. ­trachomatis, as mentioned above, and less common causes such as chronic bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections.
Prophylaxis against neonatal conjunctivitis with topical agents is common practice as the
sequelae of untreated infection can be severe. In the UK this has been replaced by antenatal
screening, but is still commonly used in countries with a high prevalence or no resource for
antenatal screening.
KEY POINTS

• Acute viral conjunctivitis is the commonest cause of inflammation of the eye. The
commonest organisms are adenovirus, coxsackievirus and herpes viruses.

• Symptoms include localized itching and irritation, redness and eye discharge.
• Treatment other than symptomatic relief is often not required as most viral con-

junctivitis resolves spontaneously. Bacterial and chlamydial conjunctivitis should
always be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

CASE 89:

CHILD WITH A RASH

A three-year-old child is brought into the GP with a rash on her face, arms, legs and body.
The mother said it started on the face four days ago and spread to the limbs and then trunk
over a few days. The child has a fever and is very irritable with poor feeding. She is up to date
with her scheduled vaccinations and has been healthy since birth, which involved an uncomplicated, full-term vaginal delivery.

Examination
As shown in Figure 89.1, there is a maculopapular rash on the face, trunk, buttocks and limbs
with a more extensive, symmetrical papular rash on the cheeks in a butterfly distribution.
The rash on the body is coalesced in a ‘lacy’ pattern. There are no petechiae present. There is a
mild coryza and pharyngeal erythema but no lesions, rash or petechiae on the palate or buccal
mucosa. There is no conjunctivitis present. Temperature is 37.7oC and heart rate 110 beats/min.
There is no lymphadenopathy or signs of meningeal irritation. The chest is clear and abdomen soft and non-tender.

ANSWER 89
There are a number of possible causes of childhood rashes occurring at this age. The nature
of the rash and the accompanying signs and symptoms should help narrow the differential
diagnosis. Historically, common childhood rashes were classified according to ‘numbers’, as
in the table below.
Common childhood causes of a maculopapular rash with no vesicles and no petechiae
or purpura
Disease

Common features

Measles (first disease)

Prodrome – Coryza, cough, conjunctivitis. Rash on
face, neck and shoulders. Koplik’s spots on mucous
membranes. Vaccine-preventable.

Scarlet fever – Group A
streptococcus (second disease)

Sore throat, generalized rash with perioral sparing,
strawberry tongue, skin peeling following rash.

Rubella (third disease)

Rapidly fading lacy rash begins on face and spreads to
trunk and limbs. Suboccipital lymphadenopathy.
Vaccine preventable.

Duke’s disease (fourth disease)

Unknown cause.

Erythema infectiosum (fifth disease)

Slapped cheek rash, lacy rash, anaemia.

Roseola infantum / Exanthem
subitum (sixth disease)

Pink rash beginning on trunk and spreading out to
face, neck and limbs. Sore throat and red eyes.

Kawasaki’s disease

Need to exclude this non-infectious cause.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is erythema infectiosum caused by parvovirus B19.
The age of the child, typical rash and anaemia fit with this aetiology. The child is fully vaccinated, and therefore measles and rubella are unlikely causes, although there is always the
slim chance of vaccine failure.
Parvovirus B19 infection results in varying manifestations depending on the presence of
certain underlying conditions. Infection may be totally asymptomatic. The commonest presentation is erythema infectiosum, a mild rash illness which is more common in children
than in adults. The rash usually lasts 7–10 days. It is also known as ‘slapped cheek’ disease as
the facial rash appears red as if both cheeks have been slapped.
Infection is associated with an arthropathy in adults more commonly than in children, where
it causes a syndrome similar to rubella with fever, rash and marked joint pain. The arthropathy is more prominent in small joints and lasts 1–3 weeks.
Parvovirus B19 is an erythrovirus, infecting red cell progenitor cells in the bone marrow,
resulting in blockage of red blood cell synthesis. In healthy adults and children this is only of
minor clinical significance and recovery of production occurs when the virus clears. This anaemia is more significant in certain groups of patients where it can lead to significant outcomes.
Complications are due mainly to the anaemia in vulnerable patient groups:
• In pregnant women infection in the 1st trimester can lead to anaemia and cardiac
failure in the foetus. If not treated (foetal blood transfusion) this can lead to hydrops
foetalis (abnormal fluid distribution from intravascular to extravascular compartments) and death of the foetus.
300

Case 89: Child with a rash

• In the immunocompromised a chronic infection and chronic anaemia can occur as

the immune system is not able to clear the infection. Their lack of ability to produce
IgM may lead to false negative serology tests and this group of patients should be
tested by molecular methods. Importantly, they remain infectious as the virus is not
eradicated.
• In those with underlying haematological disorders such as sickle cell disease or thalassaemia, infection can cause a transient aplastic crisis. These patients already have
a reduced red cell count (due to decreased production or increased destruction), and
the anaemia caused by infection pushes them into a severe aplastic crisis.
The pathogenesis of the rash and arthropathy is thought to be immune mediated through
serum antibodies and immune complexes. Direct infection of the skin and synovial tissue
may also contribute.
Diagnosis is usually made with a positive IgM serology for parvovirus B19. In immunocompromised patients who may not produce IgM, molecular (PCR) testing looking for viral DNA
is required to diagnose infection.
In healthy adults and children no treatment is necessary, as symptoms will resolve spontaneously. In the immunocompromised, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may replace
the missing immunity and assist in clearing the infection. This is not always effective as it
relies on the IVIG containing IgG to parvovirus B19. Approximately 60% of adults have had
infection and therefore antibodies. In aplastic crisis a red cell transfusion may be necessary.
In pregnancy intrauterine transfusion may be required to treat hydrops foetalis.
KEY POINTS

• Erythema infectiosum is a common childhood infection caused by parvovirus B19.
• The commonest presentation is a mild rash which begins on the face and spreads
•
•
•

to the neck, trunk and extremities. The rash is often described as ‘lacy’ in appearance and lasts 7–10 days.
In adults there is often an associated arthropathy lasting 1–3 weeks that makes
rubella and rheumatoid arthritis common differential diagnoses.
Treatment other than symptomatic relief is not required for healthy adults and
children.
Significant complications secondary to anaemia can occur in pregnant women,
immune compromised and those with underlying haematologic disorders.

CASE 90:

PELVIC PAIN

A 28-year-old teacher presents with vague lower abdominal pain. She also complains of mild
pelvic discomfort on intercourse and some post-coital spotting.
She has no diarrhoea, bloating or change in bowel habits. Her menstrual cycle is normal and
regular. She does not complain of vaginal discharge or itching and has no dysuria or frequency. She is sexually active and is in a monogamous relationship. She uses the oral contraceptive pill and has otherwise unprotected intercourse with her partner. She has no children
and is not currently pregnant. She has no significant medical history and is otherwise fit and
healthy.

Examination
She is afebrile and her cardiorespiratory parameters are normal. There is no ­lymphadenopathy
or jaundice present.
Her abdomen is soft with mild tenderness and guarding in the left iliac fossa. There is no
rebound tenderness and no masses can be felt. Internal pelvic examination reveals a feeling
of fullness in the left iliac fossa and mild cervical motion tenderness. There is no vaginal discharge present and no blood on the glove.
INVESTIGATIONS
Radiology
Abdominopelvic ultrasound shows oedema and thickening of the left fallopian tube and

303

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 90
Her signs and symptoms are due to chlamydial infection of her fallopian tube, or salpingitis.
Infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and/or ovaries with surrounding inflammation is
known collectively as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
Differential diagnoses of appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cyst, ovarian tumour,
ovarian torsion, uterine fibroids and enteritis need to be considered.
PID is most commonly a sexually transmitted disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or
Chlamydia trachomatis. It begins in the lower genital tract as a cervicitis or urethritis, which
may be asymptomatic or present with a discharge and dysuria. If untreated it spreads upwards
to the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries, causing PID. As in this patient it can present with
abnormal uterine bleeding, abdominal or pelvic pain, but is often asymptomatic and known
as the ‘silent disease’.
Not all PID is sexually transmitted. Other routes of infection include postpartum and
post-instrumentation of the uterus or fallopian tubes, intra-uterine device related, and
haematogenous.
Chronic inflammation causes scarring of the reproductive organs, which can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancies and chronic pelvic pain. A rare complication occurs when the
infection spreads outside the genital tract to the peritoneum with associated scarring. If this
spreads as far as the liver it can cause a peri-hepatitis on the liver surface with adhesions to
surrounding structures. This is known as Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome. If a woman is pregnant with PID, this infection can cause neonatal eye and lung infections.
Treatment with antibiotics should cover both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Treatment
should be according to the most recent guidelines and under expert advice as resistant gonococci have emerged. Other sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV, should be tested for.
Sexual partners should also be treated, even if asymptomatic. Safe sexual practice with the
use of condoms reduces the risk of spread. Because of its often silent nature, Chlamydia
screening programmes have a role to play in diagnosis, reducing transmission and preventing complications.
KEY POINTS

• Infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and/or ovaries with surrounding inflammation is known as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

• PID is most commonly a sexually transmitted disease caused by N. gonorrhoeae
and C. trachomatis.

• PID can present with abnormal uterine bleeding, abdominal or pelvic pain, but is
often silent.

• Chronic inflammation causes scarring of the reproductive organs, which can lead
to infertility, ectopic pregnancies and chronic pelvic pain.

• Treatment of individual and all sexual partners is indicated, even if asymptomatic.

Case 91: A painful swollen jaw

CASE 91:

A PAINFUL SWOLLEN JAW

A 32-year-old woman visits her dentist complaining of pain on the left side of her jaw. Over
the past few weeks she has noticed increasing discomfort and some swelling in the jaw. She
put it down to healing from a dental procedure until she noticed a pustule over the site of pain
that has now begun to ooze a purulent fluid.
She has not lost weight and is not diabetic, immune suppressed or on any medication.

Examination
Temperature 38oC. Blood pressure and heart rate are within normal range. Her left jaw looks
swollen and dark reddish in colour with a purulent liquid draining from a lesion under the
angle of the jaw. The lesion feels firm and irregular to the touch. It is not painful and not
obviously fluctuant. There is also a small lesion inside the mouth draining a similar purulent
liquid. There is no local lymphadenopathy.
INVESTIGATIONS
Radiology
Radiograph of the jaw shows soft tissue swelling in the area of the lesion.
CT scan of the jaw shows an irregular abscess with a sinus draining externally. There is
evidence of invasion of the mandible (Figure 91.1).
Microbiology
Microscopy of the drained pus reveals ‘sulphur granules’. Gram stain of crushed granules
shows beaded branching gram-positive rods. Culture was negative after 24 hours.
Histopathology
Sulphur granules containing gram-positive branching bacteria in the periphery of the
granules are seen (Figure 91.2).

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 91
Branching gram-positive bacteria seen on gram stain from a lesion on the jaw is highly
­suggestive of cervicofacial actinomycosis. Actinomycosis is a chronic and slowly progressive
infection caused by branching, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria of the genus Actinomyces,
the most common species being Actinomyces israelii. This bacterium is normally present
in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal and female genital tracts, but causes disease if it enters
tissues following an injury. A. israelii is an anaerobic bacterium that grows very well in deep
tissues where oxygen levels are low. Actinomycosis is characterized by abscesses, draining
sinuses, fistulae and tissue fibrosis. Cervicofacial actinomycosis, also known as ‘lumpy jaw’,
is the commonest presentation of this condition (50–70%) and is most often associated with
dental manipulation, trauma and poor oral hygiene, the tissue damage allowing penetration
of the bacteria. Other primary sites of infection include the chest, abdomen and the pelvis in
women. Central nervous system (CNS) infection which is secondarily infected due to local
or distant spread can present with abscess formation, meningitis, meningoencephalitis or an
actinomycoma. As it is usually of gradual onset, it should be considered in the diagnosis of
chronic meningitis.
Actinomycosis can mimic other diseases, such that the differential diagnosis includes malignancy, fungal infection, TB, lymphoma, abscesses and Nocardia infection (gram-positive
oral flora).
Diagnosis requires suspicion of the infection, as it is a rare condition. Clinical presentation
of a chronic, indolent disease with a mass and draining sinuses, which may be recurrent or
progressive, should suggest the diagnosis. Anatomically it can be cervicofacial as in the case
above, or less commonly thoracic, abdominal, pelvic, or CNS. Pelvic infection in women is
most often associated with the use of an intra-uterine contraceptive device (IUCD).
Blood tests are non-specific and may show raised inflammatory markers. Imaging is nonspecific, especially if early in the disease. CT and MRI may show an abscess or sinuses, but
these are ­non-specific. Histopathology samples may show sulphur granules, which are colonies of organisms arranged in a mass. Gram staining of these can demonstrate gram-positive
branching bacteria. Other stains that show the bacteria are Gomorimethenamine silver and
giemsa. Direct fluorescent antibody staining can be used for rapid identification.
Microbiology is the definitive diagnostic tool as all others are non-specific. Culture of
Actinomyces sp. from the clinical specimen is needed to confirm the diagnosis. As the organism is anaerobic, it needs to reach the lab quickly to ensure it gets cultured in the correct conditions. They are s­low-growing organisms and need to be kept in culture for up to three
weeks.
Appropriate specimens are pus, tissue and sulphur granules if visible. Swabs are not useful,
as a gram stain cannot be performed from a swab. Gram stain will reveal branching, beaded
gram-positive rods.
Newer molecular technologies such as PCR and 16s rRNA sequencing may be useful if
­culture is negative, for identifying the isolate at the species level.
Complications occur as the diagnosis is often missed or made late in the infective process.
The most common complication is extension of the infection into local structures such as
surrounding muscle or bone and invasion of local soft tissue leading to fistulae and sinuses.
Dissemination to distant structures is rare but can occur if left untreated.
308

Case 91: A painful swollen jaw

Treatment is with antibiotics with or without surgery. Historically, prolonged (6–12 months)
high-dose penicillin was used in all cases. More recently, broader spectrum antibiotics have
been used for varying periods of time depending on site of infection, response to treatment
and species of Actinomyces isolated. It is best to discuss each patient with microbiology or
infection specialists.
While antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment, surgery may be needed to remove infective
tissue in cases that do not respond to medical treatment, when extensive sinuses or fistulae
are present, when there is extensive necrosis or abscesses, or when malignancy cannot be
excluded.
KEY POINTS

• Actinomycosis is a chronic, slowly progressive, destructive infection caused by the

•
•

anaerobic gram-positive bacterium Actinomyces sp., most commonly Actinomyces
israelii.
Actinomycosis presents as cervicofacial (most common), thoracic, abdominal, pelvic or CNS pathology.

diagnosis, which can take up to three weeks.
Treatment often involves prolonged antibiotic treatment and occasionally surgery.

Case 92: Traveller’s diarrhoea

CASE 92:

TRAVELLER’S DIARRHOEA

A 25-year-old woman presents with a three-week history of explosive, loose, watery diarrhoea
that started ten days after she returned from a holiday in Nepal. She drank bottled water while
there, but brushed her teeth with tap water and had ice in her drinks. She opens her bowels at least
five times a day and has increased flatulence. Her stools are foul smelling and float in the toilet
bowl. There is no blood in the stool. The diarrhoea is associated with cramping central abdominal pain. Her appetite is unchanged, there is no vomiting, but she has noticed some weight loss.
Her past medical history is unremarkable. She does not take any regular medications.

Examination
She is haemodynamically stable and not dehydrated. Her abdomen is slightly distended but
is soft and non-tender to palpation. There is no organomegaly and the liver is not tender to
palpation. Auscultation reveals normal bowel sounds.
INVESTIGATIONS
Bloods
Haematology and renal and liver function tests are within normal range. Inflammatory
markers are not raised.
Radiology
Abdominal x-ray showed mildly dilated loops of bowel but no evidence of obstruction.
Microbiology
No pathogens isolated from stool MC&S. Stool ova, cysts and parasites (OCP) reveal multiple cystic structures measuring 10 x 10 micrometers. These are smooth-walled and oval
(Figure 92.1).

Questions
1. What are the causes of diarrhoea in a returning traveller?
2. What is the diagnosis in this case?
3. How is this treated and can it be prevented?
311

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 92
Travellers’ diarrhoea is an encompassing term of the syndrome of diarrhoea occurring in
­travellers. It is the commonest health issue affecting returning travellers. It can be caused
by one (or more) of a number of different organisms including bacteria, viruses and parasites. Common causes include bacteria such as Escherichia coli (ETEC), Campylobacter sp.
and Salmonella sp., protozoa such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia sp., and viruses such as
norovirus. Less common causes of diarrhoea in travellers include dysentery (Shigella sp.) and
cholera (Vibrio cholera).
TD is usually acquired through ingesting contaminated food or drinking water. The
travel destination and clinical symptoms will assist in determining the likely underlying
pathogen(s). Small bowel infection usually causes a watery diarrhoea while large bowel invasion presents as a dysentery (bloody diarrhoea) or colitis.
Given the chronic nature of the watery diarrhoea and the travel history in this case, the cause
is more likely parasitic. The differential diagnosis would include giardiasis, or if immunocompromised, cryptosporidiosis. There may be more than one pathogen associated with TD
and full investigation for bacteria, parasites and viruses should be performed.
The patient’s stool sample (Figure 4.8) contains cysts of Giardia lamblia. Bacterial culture
is negative. This microbiological diagnosis fits with the clinical picture of watery diarrhoea, foul-smelling steatorrhoea (fatty, floating stools) and abdominal cramps. Giardia
is most prevalent in developing countries on account of poor sanitation. However, it also
occurs in developed countries where water treatment is not adequate. G. lamblia is a protozoan parasite acquired from ingestion of cysts in contaminated water or food, or by the
fecal-oral route. Once in the small intestine they excyst, releasing trophozoites that bind
to the small intestinal wall. Here they cause damage leading to reduced absorption of solutes, which causes an osmotic diarrhoea, malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins,
resulting in steatorrhoea.
Diagnosis is by stool microscopy looking for ova, cysts and parasites. This should be requested
on all patients with travellers’ diarrhoea even if another pathogen is isolated, as multiple
infections may occur. The cyst and trophozoite stages are both seen in the stool and will be
detected in 90% of cases if stool samples are collected on three separate days.
Several drugs can treat giardiasis, including albendazole, tinidazole and metronidazole. The
close contacts of the patient should also be screened for giardiasis.
There is no vaccine against giardiasis. Prevention of giardiasis, and other causes of travellers’ diarrhoea, is best done using good food and water hygiene practices. Avoid drinking tap water, or using it to brush teeth or make ice. If this is not possible, boil or treat
the water before use. Drinking bottled or tinned water and drinks is preferred. Eating hot,
well-cooked food and avoiding street food, undercooked food or food that has been left
standing will reduce the risk. Avoid raw foods such as salads or unwashed fruits. Washing
your hands before eating is essential, which can be done using soap and water or alcoholbased hand gels.

CASE 93:

FEVER IN A RETURNING TRAVELLER

A 27-year-old Ghanaian woman presents to the Emergency Department with a three-day
­history of rigors, headache, nausea, and vague lower abdominal pain. She has no significant
past medical history, but is eight weeks pregnant with her first child. She is in a monogamous relationship and denies any risky sexual contact or drug use. She lives in London, and
returned from a trip to Ghana one week ago.
She did not take malaria prophylaxis, as she is pregnant and was staying with her family in
the city. She doesn’t recall any bites, but was aware of the presence of mosquitoes in the environment. She ate food prepared by her mother or other family members on most occasions,
although she did eat at some local take-away restaurants. She is not aware of anyone else in
her household being similarly ill. She had no history of rash, joint pains, diarrhoea, jaundice,
dysuria or respiratory symptoms. She does have urinary frequency that she put down to her
pregnancy.

Examination
Temperature 39.8°C, blood pressure 99/60 mmHg, pulse 142 beats/min. There was no rash,
no petechiae, no jaundice and no lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of either mosquito or tick bites. Her ENT examination was normal.
General examination revealed some lower abdominal tenderness with some guarding. The
uterus was not palpable. There is no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or other masses in
the abdomen. Respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable aside from
the tachycardia.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 93
Given the symptoms, signs, results and travel history it is crucial to consider both travelrelated and non-travel-related infections. In this case malaria, typhoid, hepatitis, dengue,
­yellow fever, schistosomiasis and meningococcal disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis, as well as urinary tract infection (UTI). Acute HIV seroconversion illness
should always be considered as a differential in sexually active people.
Relevant investigations include:
• Full blood count and clotting screen, as bleeding can occur in the haemorrhagic
fevers (Dengue and yellow fever), meningococcal sepsis, malaria (owing to low
platelets) and hepatitis (if severe liver dysfunction occurs).
• Liver function tests, as jaundice may occur in malaria, typhoid, hepatitis, dengue, yellow fever, schistosomiasis and meningococcal disease if there is severe sepsis.
• Abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, nausea, raised bilirubin, abnormal liver
function tests require hepatitis studies.
• Further specimens and tests suggested.
• Urine MC&S for lower abdominal pain, fever, and frequency to rule out a UTI.
• Travel plus fever requires blood cultures to exclude typhoid (abdominal pain,
endemic area, fever, low platelets, low white blood cells), and meningococcal disease
(endemic area, fever, low platelets).
• Abdominal pain and tenderness, anaemia, and raised bilirubin requires a stool sample for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens.
• Travel to endemic area associated with fever, low platelets, low white blood cells
and a raised LDH necessitate a malaria film. In this case microscopy of thick and
thin blood smear (Figure 93.1) displays multiple ring-form trophozoites inhabiting a
single, normal-sized erythrocyte, consistent with Plasmodium falciparum infection.
• Serum analysis for dengue was negative but is an important test because of the
endemic area, fever, low platelets, and low white blood cells.

Case 93: Fever in a returning traveller

Malaria is an acute febrile illness. In a non-immune individual, symptoms appear seven days
or more (usually 10–15 days) after the mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache,
chills and vomiting – may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within
24 hours, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness often leading to death.
Worldwide malaria infects approximately 250 million and kills approximately 1 million people per year. The majority of infection occurs in young children living in the tropics (mainly
sub-saharan Africa, Middle East, India and South America), with the most deaths occurring
in sub-Saharan Africa. There are five Plasmodium species that cause malaria in humans.
P. ­falciparum and P. vivax are the most common, with P. falciparum being the most deadly.
The others are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi. Five percent of patients are infected with
more than one species. For P. vivax and P. ovale relapses can occur weeks to months after the
primary infection.
Transmission of the parasite occurs when the female Anopheles mosquito bites a human,
releasing sporozoites from its salivary glands into the blood. These sporozoites enter hepatocytes where they incubate for 2–3 weeks. During this time they reproduce asexually to
produce merozoites. Eventually the hepatocytes burst, releasing a mass of merozoites that
rapidly invade erythrocytes, where further replication and release takes place. Every 48–72
hours, the erythrocytes burst to logarithmically increase the parasite burden. Clinically this
correlates with a peak in fever every 48–72 hours, known as periodicity. This periodic fever
often alternates with feeling cold and shivering. This process can result in severe anaemia.
Pathologically, erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum are able to adhere to and block the
post-capillary blood vessels of several organs. This process can result in cerebral malaria
and multi-system end-organ failure. Other complications of persistently high parasitaemia
include blackwater fever (haemoglobinuria), which is a result of severe red cell destruction
that produces dark urine with renal failure.
Malaria is more frequent and more complicated during pregnancy, especially in a first pregnancy. There is increased risk of maternal anaemia, respiratory complications and death from
severe malaria. Miscarriage, stillbirth and intrauterine growth retardation are complications
of maternal anaemia and placental infection. Prophylaxis and treatment in pregnancy is also
more complicated as some of the drugs used are contraindicated, owing to insufficient safety
data or because they cause severe side effects.
The first-line treatment of pregnant women is quinine. Hypoglycaemia is a complication
of both quinine and the malarial parasite, is more common in pregnant women. Neither
Coartem nor atovaquone-proguanil is recommended for use during pregnancy in the UK.
Doxycycline is always contraindicated in pregnancy, and clindamycin should be used as a
second drug together with quinine.
KEY POINTS

• P. falciparum is the most virulent species of human malaria.
• Malaria often presents with fever and non-specific symptoms and should always
be considered in a traveller returning from a high risk area.

• A thick blood film is best for screening and a thin blood film for species identifica-

•

tion. Characteristically P. falciparum demonstrates a signet-ring-shaped parasite
surrounded by a thin cytoplasm ring. Multiple ring forms in a single erythrocyte is
also characteristic.
Malaria infection is potentially fatal and should be treated urgently with expert
input.

ANSWER 94
Headache, fever, neck stiffness, photophobia and confusion suggest the diagnosis of meningitis or ­encephalitis. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is the most common differential but is usually
more acute in onset, and is associated with loss of consciousness and ‘stroke-like’ symptoms.
Encephalitis may present like meningitis in the early stages but progresses to confusion,
altered mental states, altered behaviour and speech or motor abnormalities. Subdural haematoma is unlikely in the absence of trauma. A cerebral abscess or tumour is likely to present
with localizing neurological signs depending on the site of the lesions. Migraine should be
considered, but unless there is a past history this is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.

The clinical picture and the CSF finding of high protein, low glucose and neutrophilic
­leucocytosis are most suggestive of bacterial meningitis (more specifically N. meningitidis, a
gram-negative intracellular diplococci).
320

Case 94: A spot of confusion

N. meningitidis is a normal inhabitant of the nasopharynx and is transmitted from person
to person by secretions from the upper respiratory tract. Increased rates of meningococcal carriage occur in smokers, overcrowded households, military recruits and adolescents.
Immunity is induced by carriage, and therefore established carriers do not usually develop
invasive disease. The risk of invasive disease following acquisition varies with environmental, host and strain factors. The incubation period of meningococcal disease is 2–10 days.
Meningitis is the most common presentation of invasive meningococcal disease and results
from haematogenous dissemination of the organism.
Of the serotypes of N. meningitidis, six (A, B, C, W135, X, and Y) are the most important
clinically. Worldwide distribution of serotypes varies markedly, with type A being most
prevalent in Africa and Asia but almost absent in North America and Europe, where type
B is commonest. Following introduction of the meningococcal C conjugate vaccination in
1999, there was a marked fall in disease caused by serogroup C strains. The quadrivalent vaccination (A,C,W135,Y) is recommended for high-risk exposures, such as attending the Hajj.
Investigations to confirm N. meningitides on CSF and/or blood include:
• Blood and CSF for gram stain and cultures
• Bacterial PCR. A negative blood culture does not exclude a bacterial cause in this
patient, as he was treated with antibiotics before blood cultures were taken. Bacterial
PCR looks for bacterial DNA in the CSF or blood.
• Antigen testing of blood or CSF may provide confirmation in a patient with a clinically suspicious presentation.
• Nasopharyngeal swab looking for carriage as this site is less affected by antibiotics
than others.
Investigations looking for other pathogens are:
• Viral PCR for herpes viruses, enterovirus and adenovirus.
• TB culture and PCR
• Cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) – Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that commonly
causes meningitis in HIV-positive patients. It usually occurs when the patient is
immune suppressed with a CD4 count of below 100. This was not tested in this patient.
Treatment of meningitis is considered a medical emergency and the first dose of antibiotics
should be given within 30 minutes of presentation. Empiric treatment should cover the common causes of meningitis for the age and underlying conditions of the individual patient.
Meningococcal disease and bacterial meningitis are both notifiable diseases, and notification must be sent to the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Close contacts (family, household,
medical staff) will be assessed to determine whether prophylaxis is required. This is usually reserved for ‘intimate’ contacts, where there is contact with patient secretions. Patients
admitted to hospital should be isolated to prevent the spread of infection.
KEY POINTS

• The common causes of meningitis differ in different age groups and risk groups.
•
•
•

In healthy adults and adolescents the commonest causes are S. pneumoniae, N.
meningitidis and enterovirus.
Typical CSF findings in various forms of meningitis may be helpful in diagnosis.
Treatment of meningitis is an emergency and antibiotics should be started as soon
as the diagnosis is suspected.
Meningitis is a notifiable disease.

Case 95: Congenital infection

CASE 95:

CONGENITAL INFECTION

A 28-year-old primigravid woman attends her local antenatal clinic for her routine 20-week
visit. Her booking bloods taken at her 12-week visit were checked and found to be normal.

Examination
General examination was within normal limits. There was no evidence of a rash or arthritis.
INVESTIGATIONS
Imaging
The ultrasound reveals some placental thickening, low estimated foetal weight and
microcephaly.

Further history after ultrasound results
She works as a preschool teacher and denies any recent history of illness. On detailed questioning she admits to having a flu-like illness about six weeks ago. She denies having had any
rash, cold sores, genital lesions, discharge or diarrhoea. She has a history of chickenpox as a
child and has had her MMR vaccines. She doesn’t smoke and has not drunk alcohol during
her pregnancy. She doesn’t have any pets at home. Her diet is healthy and she doesn’t eat any
undercooked meat or unpasteurized dairy products.

Questions
1. What are the causes of congenital infection and which of these agents could cause
this ultrasound result?
2. What tests can be done on the mother at this stage to determine the cause, and how
would you interpret these results (see table in answer section)?
3. What tests can be done on the foetus at this stage to determine the cause?
4. How should this be managed during pregnancy and after delivery?

323

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 95
Congenital infections are infections acquired in utero or during delivery. Traditionally
these were known by the acronym TORCHES, representing Toxoplasmosis, Other, Rubella,
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), HErpes simplex (HSV) and Syphilis. The ‘Other’ infections include
varicella-zoster virus (VZV), parvovirus B19, coxsackievirus, and HIV.
These infections have some common presentations, but also distinctions between them, and
clinical findings should be used to guide testing. In this case the pathogens likely to cause the
ultrasound findings include toxoplasmosis, CMV, HSV and VZV.
Maternal blood was tested for CMV, rubella, VZV, HSV and toxoplasma antibodies. Her
booking bloods were compared with her current blood results:

On booking bloods IgG was positive for rubella, HSV and VZV indicating previous exposure. The negative rubella, HSV and VZV IgM suggests exposure was not recent. For rubella
and VZV this implies immunity. HSV IgG does not necessarily provide immunity as it does
not distinguish between HSV-1 and 2. Similarly there is still the risk of reactivation of latent
HSV virus. When compared to bloods taken at this visit, there is evidence of seroconversion
for CMV IgG, suggesting primary infection has occurred between these two samples. The
IgM is positive supporting recent infection.
CMV is a ubiquitous herpes virus that usually causes a mild or asymptomatic infection in the
immune competent. Occasionally primary infection causes a syndrome of infectious mononucleosis, similar to that caused by Ebstein–Barr virus (EBV), with features such as sore
throat, fever, fatigue, petechial rash, hepatitis, splenomegaly, haemolysis and atypical lymphocytes. It is commonly acquired through sharing saliva, although is also spread through
blood, semen, breast milk and vaginal fluid. It is an infection of childhood, particularly in
less-developed countries, where over 90% are infected in childhood compared to around 40%
in developed countries. Like all herpes viruses, infection can re-activate, although this tends
to only occur in immune-compromised states.
In primary CMV infection during pregnancy, the risk of foetal infection is about 33%.
Intrauterine CMV infection occurs mainly as a result of placental infection following
maternal viraemia. If infected, there is a 20–25% chance of developing sequelae, 10–15%
324

Case 95: Congenital infection

observable at birth, with 5–10% presenting later in infancy. While congenital CMV can
occur at any stage of pregnancy risk of sequelae is highest if infection occurs in the first
trimester.
Confirming infection in the foetus is best made with amniocentesis looking for CMV DNA
in the amniotic fluid, confirming the foetus is excreting virus. The amniotic CMV DNA
viral load is important in picking up those who would otherwise be asymptomatic at birth.
Certain features on foetal ultrasound may be suggestive, but are not definitively diagnostic,
the most classic being periventricular cerebral calcifications.
Postnatal diagnosis in symptomatic babies would show some of the following signs. If symptomatic at birth the mortality rate is about 5%:

• Growth retardation
• Haematological sequelae
• thrombocytopenia and purpura
• hepatosplenomegaly
• lymphadenopathy
• Neurological sequelae
• poor tone
• seizures
• microcephaly
• chorioretinitis
• cerebral calcification (classically periventricular)
• deafness (can be a late manifestation and is the most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss)

• Pneumonitis
• Colitis
• Hepatitis

Sequelae in those presenting later in childhood are typically hearing defects or impaired
intellectual performance.
Although most pregnant women with primary CMV will deliver an unaffected f­oetus,
the option of termination should always be discussed. Routine use of antivirals in
immune-competent people is rarely indicated, and none have been shown to reduce perinatal t­ ransmission. Data on use of antivirals in the treatment of intrauterine infection is
lacking.
At delivery this neonate was noted to be small with microcephaly. He was jaundiced,
had a papular rash and enlarged liver and spleen. Cranial ultrasound showed the intracerebral calcifications and large ventricles. Blood, urine and CSF were taken for routine
testing. He had thrombocytopaenia and raised liver enzymes. CMV IgG and IgM were
both ­positive. In neonates a positive IgG often represents maternal antibodies that have
­t ransferred transplacentally. IgM, however, is too large to pass through the placenta so it
usually _­represents active or recent infection. Urine, blood and CSF CMV DNA PCR were
all positive.
In neonates, antiviral treatment with ganciclovir is controversial, as it has significant bonemarrow-suppressing side effects. It is indicated only in symptomatic congenital CMV, where
it cannot cure the infection, but can slow its progress.

Case 96: A chronic cough

CASE 96:

A CHRONIC COUGH

A 28-year-old postgraduate student who recently arrived in the United Kingdom presents to
his GP complaining of cough productive of yellow sputum. He does not complain of haemoptysis or shortness of breath. When questioned he also mentions some night sweats and loss of
weight over the past two months. His symptoms failed to improve despite taking two previous courses of antibiotics prescribed by his doctor in India. He smokes 40 cigarettes a day and
drinks moderate amounts of alcohol. He has no other past medical history. He denies having
any contacts with the same symptoms.

Examination
Temperature 37.9oC, pulse 102 beats/min, blood pressure 110/60 mmHg. He is noted to have
a previous BCG scar on his left arm. Examination of the neck shows bilateral supraclavicular
lymphadenopathy. Ear, nose and throat examination is normal. Chest auscultation reveals
bronchial breathing and an expiratory wheeze in the right upper lobe. He had a slightly tender liver but no evidence of jaundice or other signs of liver disease.
INVESTIGATIONS
Radiology
He was sent for a chest x-ray which shows right upper lobe consolidation, possibly some
left upper lobe changes and a full hilar region suggesting enlarged lymph nodes.

327

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 96
Differential diagnosis includes:
• Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) – common presenting trio of chronic cough, night
sweats and weight loss
• Lymphoma – lymphadenopathy, weight loss and night sweats
• Bronchiectasis/COPD – secondary to his smoking history
• Lung cancer – patient is young for this diagnosis, but has smoking history and
would fit signs and symptoms
• Recurrent right upper-lobe pneumonia
Patients who are suspected of having active PTB must have a posterior-anterior chest
radiograph. This is to reveal typical changes found in TB, which classically includes
enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes and mid- or upper-lobe consolidation or
cavitation.
At least three sputum samples should be sent for acid fast bacilli (AFB) TB microscopy and culture. In a positive microscopy test (Figure 96.1) the TB bacillus displays
a red stain resulting from its wall retaining the acid of the stain, thus called ‘AcidFast’. If it is not possible to obtain spontaneously produced sputum, the patient should
be referred for a ­bronchoscopy where the lungs are washed out in an attempt to find
the b
­ acillus. If r­ espiratory samples come back negative but you still have a high index
of s­ uspicion, immune-based tests could be performed. These include the Mantoux test
or the more recent interferon gamma (IGRA) tests, and are a sign of previous exposure
to TB. They are relatively non-specific and do not distinguish between active and past
infection.
The gold standard for diagnosis is culturing the causative organism. This takes a long time,
as the organism is slow growing. Historically this took up to 40 days of culture in specialized media, but newer systems have reduced this time, and culture may be positive within
two weeks. Culture positivity is important in order to obtain antibiotic susceptibilities

Case 96: A chronic cough

of the TB isolate. Molecular testing (PCR) can be performed looking for TB DNA in the
sample; however, sensitivity is not high enough to rule out the diagnosis if a test is negative. Molecular testing does not provide full susceptibility results which are important for
treatment.
TB can cause a disseminated illness and is not necessarily confined to the respiratory tract.
Other presentations of TB include lymphadenitis, meningitis, bone and joint infections, and
gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract infections. Microbiological samples should be taken
from appropriate sites.
TB is spread from person to person through the air. When a person with infectious p
­ ulmonary
TB coughs or sneezes, tiny particles containing M. tuberculosis are expelled. These particles,
called droplet nuclei, are about 1 to 5 microns in diameter and can remain suspended in the
air for several hours. If another person inhales air that contains these droplet nuclei, they
reach the alveoli and transmission of infection may occur. Not everyone who is exposed to
an infectious TB patient becomes infected. The risk depends on how infectious the patient is,
the duration of exposure, the virulence of the TB strain and the immune status of the contact
person.
In the alveoli, some of the tubercle bacilli are killed, but a few multiply and disseminate.
Bacilli may reach any part of the body, including areas where disease is likely to develop,
such as upper portions of the lungs, kidneys, brain and bone. The spread and multiplication
is stopped within 2–8 weeks by the bodies’ immune response. At this time, the person has
what is known as latent TB infection (LTBI). LTBI means that bacilli are in the body but the
immune system is keeping them under control and inactive.
Some people with LTBI develop TB disease. TB disease develops when the immune system
cannot keep the bacilli under control and they begin to multiply rapidly. The risk of developing TB disease is highest in the first two years after infection.
If active PTB is suspected and the patient is very unwell, treatment should be commenced
without waiting for the culture results. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient should be transferred to the care of a physician with experience of managing pulmonary TB. If hospital
admission is needed, patients should be admitted to a single isolation room under respiratory
precautions, and if suspicion of drug resistant TB exists, they should be admitted to a negative pressure side room. This is to reduce spread of infection to others. All patients with TB
should have an HIV test performed. All close contacts should be screened to see if transmission has occurred.
The standard treatment regimen comprises quadruple therapy with rifampacin, isoniazid,
ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Pyrazinamide and ethambutol are stopped after two months
and rifampacin and isoniazid continued for a further four months, to complete six months
in total of treatment for pulmonary TB. Treatment with multiple drugs is used to reduce the
development of resistance in the TB bacillus during treatment. TB should never be treated
with only one antibiotic.

331

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 97
Patients with a history of IVDU are at risk of acquiring blood-borne viruses and should be
investigated for HIV and viral hepatitis.
This patient’s results show mildly elevated ALT, AST and bilirubin, and a normal ALP. This
suggests hepatocyte damage rather than an obstructive jaundice. The enzymes are only
mildly raised, suggestive more of chronic than acute hepatic process.
Viral serology testing excludes HIV and hepatitis C infection but confirms the presence of
hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B infection is spread parenterally, sexually and vertically.
It has an incubation period of approximately three months, after which the symptoms of
acute hepatitits occur. In the majority of cases this is cleared by the immune system. In 5–10%
of infected persons, failure to clear the virus occurs and a chronic infectious state ensues.
Hepatitis B infection is also causally associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C
virus is a widely spread RNA virus with similar transmission routes to hepatitis B, although
mainly spread parenterally through blood in transfusions (before screening) and needle
sharing (tattoos, IVDU). Patients with hepatitis C are more prone to develop a chronic infection and cirrhosis than those infected with other forms of hepatitis.
Serological markers are the mainstay of diagnosis of viral hepatitis (Figures 97.1 and 97.2).
After acute infection the first marker to appear in the blood is HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface
Antigen) and looking for this antigen is the initial test done when screening for hepatitis
B infection. It is part of the surface protein and reflects the presence of the virus in the
blood. It is positive in acute and chronic infection, and only becomes negative if the infection is cleared. If it is positive for longer than 6 months, the infection is classed as a chronic
infection.
Anti-HBs, an antibody to this surface antigen, is produced as the HBsAg wanes. It represents
late acute infection or past infection and the clearance of surface antigen. Positive anti-HBs
can also represent vaccination as Hep B vaccine contains recombinant HBsAg. In chronic
infection, when HBsAg remains positive, anti-HBs will not be produced.
The nucleocapsid of the virus is reflected in two antigens, HBcAg and HBeAg.
Core antigen (HBcAg) is not measurable as it remains inside the virus, but both IgM (AntiIgM) and IgG (anti-HBc) antibodies to HBcAg are produced and can be measured. As with
other infections, IgM is produced during acute infection and will also remain positive in
chronic active hepatitis as the virus is still present. It will disappear once core antigen is no
longer present, that is, once the virus has been cleared. IgG, on the other hand (as with other
infections), will be produced throughout infection and remain positive after recovery as a
marker of previous infection. IgG antibodies therefore do not distinguish between recent,
chronic or previous infection. If negative, however, they exclude hepatitis B infection.
HBeAg, which is a soluble part of the core anitgen, can leave the virus and can therefore be
measured. Its presence reflects actively replicating virus and it will disappear when the virus
stops replicating. A positive result therefore indicates acute infection or chronic active infection, implying actively replicating virus and thus high infectivity. Analogous to Anti-HBs
and HBsAg, anti-HBe is produced as HBeAg wanes, and reflects the ceasing of active viral
replication. A positive result for anti-HBe represents previous infection, or chronic, nonactive hepatitis B.

This patient’s results therefore suggest a chronic, non-active hepatitis B infection, also known
as a carrier state. A viral PCR for HBV DNA should be done in all chronic infections to
evaluate for viral replication. A liver biopsy should be considered in chronic hepatitis with a
positive HBV DNA.
The other hepatitis viruses include hepatitis A–E and G (GB-V). Despite their structural differences and modes of transmission they all target the liver cells. The vowels (A and E) are
transmitted via the faecal-oral route, are usually associated with travel and cause an acute
infection presenting as gastroenteritis and hepatitis. They do not cause any chronic disease.
Most patients with hepatitis B will resolve their infection without any specific treatment.
Patients in whom treatment is recommended include those who have evidence of viral replication. Treatment options currently include interferon and antiviral agents. Patient e­ ducation
is very important as prevention of transmission to other people can be achieved only by collaboration with the patient.
333

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

Prevention of infection is best achieved through vaccination, which is recommended for all
at risk, such as healthcare workers, emergency service workers, IVDUs, household members
of carriers, post-exposure prophylaxis if non-immune, travellers to high risk areas, and those
on renal dialysis. The vaccine contains the HBsAG and is prepared by recombinant DNA
technology. It is usually given in three doses over a period of six months; however, this can
be expedited to two months for patients at high risk of infection. It is important to test for
seroconversion after vaccination as some people do not produce antibodies and are therefore
not protected.
KEY POINTS

• Intravenous drug users are at risk of acquiring blood-borne viruses and should be
investigated for HIV and viral hepatitis.

• Hepatitis B is spread parenterally, sexually and vertically. It has an incubation
period of approximately three months, after which the symptoms occur.

• HBsAg is the first marker to appear after acute infection and the first test done

when screening for hepatitis B. Anti-HBs appears in late acute infection and
remains positive. It can also represent immunity from vaccination as Hep B vaccine
contains recombinant HBsAg.
Most patients with hepatitis B will resolve their infection without any specific treatment. In 5–10% of infected persons, failure of clearance of the virus occurs and a
chronic state ensues. It is also causally associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Prevention of infection is best achieved through vaccination, which is recommended for all at risk.

food-borne pathogens, dengue, arboviruses and hepatitis should be considered. HIV should
also be considered if risk is established. It is important not to exclude non-travel-related
­common infections, such as urinary tract infection, inflammatory bowel disease and cholecystitis, that might present similarly.
The blood culture result narrows the diagnosis to conditions caused by a gram-negative
­bacteraemia. From the above, typhoid and paratyphoid are most likely, but it could still be a
common pathogen such as E. coli secondary to a non-travel-related cause.
Enteric fever (sometimes known as typhoid fever) is caused by the gram-negative pathogens
Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi. Transmission of the infection is via
the faecal-oral route, and the disease is more common in areas where water, food and hand
hygiene is poor. Humans are the only known reservoir for S. enterica Typhi and S. enterica
Paratyphi.
It presents in young adults with a high-grade fever, abdominal pain and a relative bradycardia, as is seen in this patient. One would expect a faster heart rate with such a high temperature; however, this is not the case in this patient. In addition, patients usually also present
with a relatively low or a normal white cell and platelet count. Impaired liver function tests
are also a common finding.
While uncommon, severe complications can occur. These include intestinal haemorrhage
from congested Peyer’s patches, intestinal perforation, encephalitis, neuropsychiatric symptoms and metastatic abscesses.
Patients who are suspected of having typhoid fever should be started on antibiotics, which
can be oral or intravenous depending on their clinical condition. Prior to commencing therapy, however, blood and stool cultures should be sent to the microbiology laboratory. Initial
choice of therapy depends on the susceptibility patterns of the pathogen in the area it was
acquired, as some geographic regions have high resistance to certain antibiotics. Intravenous
ceftriaxone is currently the treatment of choice. Oral options for treatment include ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, but should be prescribed only once testing has confirmed they are
sensitive. The duration of treatment varies from 7 to 14 days.
The fever usually resolves within four days of appropriate therapy, but may last longer.
Prolonged fever is not necessarily a sign of complicated disease.
As salmonellae are highly infectious, all patients should be admitted to an isolation room
and enteric precautions undertaken to prevent spread of the infection to other patients.
Health authorities responsible for public health and epidemiology, such as the Public Health
England, should be notified.
Following ingestion, the organism reaches the intestinal mucosa, where it attaches to the
M cells of the Peyer’s patches, which have a wide array of molecules that assist in the attachment and invasion of the intestinal barrier. The organism causes systemic infection by crossing the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier to invade the macrophages at the submucosal space.
Despite the hostile environment within the macrophage, they are able to survive and replicate.
The inflammatory response mounted by the host is partially due to activation of the innate
immune response.
336

Case 98: Gram negative bacteraemia

A small number of people, called carriers, recover from typhoid fever but continue to carry
the bacteria. Both ill persons and carriers shed Salmonella Typhi in their faeces (stool). Stool
should be tested to ensure clearance of carriage, especially in those working as food handlers
or with vulnerable groups of people.
This patient could have benefited from vaccination prior to travel. Two types of vaccine are
currently available for typhoid, a live oral attenuated vaccine and a parenteral polysaccharide
vaccine. They protect only against S. Typhi and not against S. Paratyphi, so food hygiene
precautions as well should be recommended to all travellers to endemic areas.

CASE 99:

A GROIN SWELLING

A 42-year-old intravenous drug user (IVDU) is admitted to hospital complaining of fever
and a painful left groin. She has been injecting for a number of years and has had multiple
hospital admissions for infected injection sites. She is currently injecting into the left groin.
She denies any other symptoms.

Examination
She is underweight and has poor personal hygiene. She has a fever (temperature 39.2oC), her
pulse is 130 beats/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg. Respiratory and cardiovascular examinations are unremarkable and her abdomen is soft and non-tender. Her arms are
scarred from previous injecting, and her skin shows evidence of excoriations from chronic
scratching. A left inguinal swelling is noted, being hot, red and painful to the touch. There is
cellulitis surrounding the swollen area.
Routine bloods and blood cultures are taken and she is started empirically on IV benzyl penicillin and flucloxacillin for her abscess and cellulitis. Surgery is planned to drain the abscess.

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 99
An abscess is a localized collection of pus (neutrophils) that is a result of the inflammatory response to a bacterial infection or a foreign body. Certain bacteria are more likely to
result in abscesses, such as staphylococci. The immune system reaction to the bacteria is
protective and tries to prevent the infection spreading. This results in a collection of bacteria.
This inflammatory cells and debris. This presents as an area of fluctuance and pain, usually
with surrounding cellulitis and overlying skin erythema and heat. There may also be associated systemic signs such as fever, raised inflammatory markers and bacteraemia. The most
common causes of skin and soft tissue infection are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus
pyogenes.
Both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes cause invasive disease and significant
morbidity and mortality. Invasive disease may take the form of severe spreading skin and
soft-tissue infection (including necrotising fasciitis), disseminated infection and toxic shock
syndrome.
Imaging of the groin should be performed to exclude deep-seated infection that may be present, such as a pelvic or thigh abscess or osteomyelitis. Imaging of the surrounding tissue is
needed to exclude necrotising fasciitis if the pain is severe or cellulitis continues to spread
despite adequate treatment.
Staphylococcus aureus is associated with pus- and abscess-forming infection of skin and soft
tissues, especially if medical devices such as cannulae or catheters are present. It is also the
cause of significant infections of bone and joints, heart and other organs to which it disseminates. A more serious form of infection, such as necrotising pneumonia, necrotising fasciitis
and severe sepsis, occurs in strains possessing the genes for Panton–Valentine leukocidin
(PVL) toxin. Aside from the presence of medical devices, invasive disease does not require
risk factors and occurs in young, otherwise healthy individuals.
Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is most commonly associated with ‘strep throat’ and skin and
soft-tissue infection such as impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis. Less common complications
include necrotising fasciitis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Invasive disease occurs most commonly in people with risk factors, such as
extreme age, recent childbirth, IVDU, alcoholism, diabetes, cancer and immune suppression.
Abscesses are best treated by incision and drainage to remove the source of infection.
Penicillin or flucloxacillin is appropriate treatment for GAS, but MRSA will not be adequately
treated. If GAS infection is severe, the antibiotic clindamycin should be added. Aside from
killing the bacterium directly, it has an added effect of reducing toxin production, therefore
reducing much of the toxin-mediated tissue damage associated with severe disease.
MRSA is a Staphylococcus aureus strain that is resistant to the ß-lactam group of antibiotics, which include penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. It is often resistant to
other groups of antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides, macrolides and quinolones, making it more difficult to treat. It causes the same infections as meticillin-sensitive S. aureus
(MSSA). Treatment for MRSA has a limited range of antibiotics including the glycopeptides
(e.g. ­vancomycin), linezolid, daptomycin, tetracyclines, fucidic acid and rifampcin, often
used in combination to reduce the risk of further resistance developing. The patient’s antibiotic treatment should thus be changed to include one of these, some of which will also treat
the GAS. An example of a treatment regimen would be vancomycin plus clindamycin.
340

Case 99: A groin swelling

MRSA colonization and infection is also treated with a decolonization regime to attempt
to reduce the burden of MRSA present, and to reduce the risk of developing further infection. This regimen includes an antiseptic body wash and nasal application of an antibiotic or
antiseptic.
Both MRSA and GAS can spread between patients and from patients to staff, causing outbreaks. To prevent this, this patient should be admitted into a single room for isolation.
Precautions to reduce the risk of spread include the use of personal protective equipment
(PPE) for any health care worker having contact with her or her immediate environment. The
PPE includes the use of gloves and aprons, and face protection if aerosols are to be generated,
such as for wound dressings and suctioning. Hand washing with soap and water or decontaminating hands with an alcohol-based hand rub is recommended before and after contact
with her or her immediate environment.
Among the many virulence factors of cell surface antigens, capsule, adhesins, and t­oxins,
are the group known as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPE), previously called
­erythrogenic toxins. These SPE (A,B,C) act as superantigens, in that they are able to directly
and n
­ on-specifically stimulate T cells of the immune system, resulting in massive cytokine
­production, leading to fever, muscle lysis, severe sepsis and shock. In S. aureus the same
­process occurs in response to the exotoxin toxic-shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1).

Case 100: Urethral discharge

CASE 100:

URETHRAL DISCHARGE

A 24-year-old man is referred to the local genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic. He has
been complaining of recent onset of dysuria and has also noticed a yellowish urethral discharge. He denies any constitutional symptoms, frequency or haematuria. He has not noticed
any rash, conjunctivitis or joint pains. His background history is unremarkable. He is heterosexual with a number of sexual partners, and admits to practising unsafe sex.

Examination
General examination is normal. There is a small amount of muco-purulent discharge evident
from the urethra, which was mildly erythematous around the meatus.
There is no rash visible, nor any evidence of genital ulceration or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
The testes and prostate are non-tender and not enlarged.
Urine and urethral swabs are taken for investigation. Due to his risky sexual behaviour,
blood is taken for syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B. A list of his sexual contacts is requested for
contact tracing.

3. How would you manage this patient?

343

100 Cases in Clinical Pathology

ANSWER 100
The differential diagnosis of a urethral discharge is classically divided into gonococcal
­urethritis (GU) and non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU).
GU is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the gram-negative diplococcus Neisseria
gonorrhoeae. There is generally a short history of dysuria and a thick urethral discharge
occurring after a recent contact. In women the presentation can be slower, and may be asymptomatic. Disseminated infection occurs if the organism spreads to the systemic circulation.
This is characterized by fever, rash and suppurative arthritis.
NGU presentation tends to be more indolent, with a 3–4-week history being usual. The dysuria and discharge are less prominent, and the discharge is more watery than for GU. Causes
of NGU include:
• Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common cause of sexually transmitted infection
reported in the UK, especially in young adults and adolescents. Symptoms may
come and go over several weeks, and it may appear to spontaneously resolve in
some. It may also be asymptomatic, especially in women. There is co-infection with
N. gonorrhoeae in about 20% of patients, and empiric treatment will usually treat
both these infections simultaneously.
• Mycoplasma genitalium, emerging as a common cause of NGU, and is more commonly symptomatic than C. trachomatis. It is more difficult to diagnose and is
therefore sometimes treated empirically.
• Trichomonas vaginalis infection, a common cause of vaginitis in women and also
an important source of urethritis in men. A 22% urethral prevalence was found
among male partners of women with known trichomonal infection. The condition
should be suspected in patients with symptoms but little or no discharge on physical
examination.
• Ureaplasma urealyticum, more recently thought to be a cause of NGU. It may
account for 10–40% of NGU cases and is sexually transmitted.
• Herpes simplex virus infection, most often associated with painful superficial genital ulcers that are usually visible on the external genitalia.
• Prostatitis, especially in older men with enlarged prostates, predisposing to obstruction and infection. Minor penile discharge may be present. Symptoms of urinary
outflow obstruction and perineal discomfort may be the predominant symptoms.
No test is currently 100% sensitive or specific for N. gonorrhoeae. Routine urine MC&S culture media does not support its growth. Options for diagnosis of urethritis are microscopy,
culture and molecular tests:
• Microscopy: staining of the urethral discharge is helpful in looking for pus cells as
well as the typical intracellular, bean-shaped diplococci of N. gonorrhoeae. If a gram
stain is performed the bacteria will look pink in colour (gram-negative). Microscopy
has a sensitivity of 90–95% in symptomatic men for N. gonorrhoeae. Sensitivity is poor
for endocervical (<50%), rectal and throat swabs, and in asymptomatic men (50–75%).
• Culture: using specific selective media, N. gonorrhoeae will grow if plated soon after
the specimen is taken. It is a fragile organism and a delay in the specimen reaching
the lab will result in a false negative culture, as it will have died en route. Thus some
GUM clinics plate the specimens directly onto culture plates in the clinic. It is not
practical to culture for Chlamydia or Ureaplasma because it is technically difficult,
takes two to three days to get a result, and is expensive.
344

Case 100: Urethral discharge

• Molecular tests: Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is the standard diagnostic

and screening test used for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. It is >96% sensitive
even on asymptomatic cases and can be performed on swabs from any site as well as
urine samples from men. Sensitivity on urine samples from women is significantly
lower than from an endocervical swab and is not recommended.
N. gonorrhoeae has become significantly resistant to a spectrum of antibiotics. There are no
longer any oral antibiotics that can be recommended alone for first-line treatment with the
certainty of curing the infection. First-line treatment for uncomplicated gonococcal infection is currently a single dose of parenteral ceftriaxone with oral azithromycin. The azithromycin is thought to have a synergistic effect with the cephalosporin, and is also used to try
to delay emergence of resistance to the cephalosporin. Testing for cure and contact tracing is
recommended after treatment.
KEY POINTS

• GU causes a mucopurulent urethral discharge in men and endocervical infection
in women.

• NGU presentation tends to be more indolent, with less prominent dysuria and
more watery discharge than GU. The commonest cause of NGU is C. trachomatis.

• NAAT is the current standard test for symptomatic and asymptomatic
N. gonorrhoeae.

• N. gonorrhoeae is becoming multi-drug resistant, with current recommendation
for treatment of uncomplicated infection being parenteral cephalosporin with oral
azithromycin.

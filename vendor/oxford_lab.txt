Introduction

Approach to investigation
Why do tests?
Patients seldom present to their doctors with diagnosesrather, they
have symptoms or signs. The major challenge of medicine is being able to
talk to the patient and obtain a history and then carry out a physical examination looking for pointers to their likely underlying problem. Our elders
and, some would argue, betters in medicine had less tests available to
them then we have today, and their diagnoses were often made solely
from the history and examination. Of course, they would claim that their
clinical acumen and skills were greater than ours and that we rely too
heavily on the huge armoury of laboratory and other investigations available today. This, in part, is probably true, but we cannot ignore the fact
that advances in science and technology have spawned a bewildering array xxi
of very useful and sophisticated tests that help us to confirm our diagnostic suspicions.
By test we mean the measurement of a component of blood, marrow
or other body fluid or physiological parameter to determine whether the
patients value falls within or outside the normal range, either suggesting
the diagnosis or, in some cases, actually making the diagnosis for us.
Factors affecting variable parameters in health
Many measurable body constituents vary throughout life. For example, a
newborn baby has an extremely high haemoglobin concentration which
falls after delivery; this is completely normal and is physiological rather than
pathological. A haemoglobin level this high in an adult would be pathological since it is far outside the normal range for the adult population.
Factors affecting measurable variables

Age.
Sex.
Ethnicity.
Altitude.
Build.
Physiological conditions (e.g. at rest, after exercise, standing, lying).
Sampling methods (e.g. with or without using tourniquet).
Storage and age of sample.
Container used, e.g. for blood sample, as well as anticoagulant.
Method of analysis.

Reference ranges (normal values)
These are published for most measurable components of blood and other
tissue and we have included the normal ranges for most blood and CSF
analytes at the end of the book.

What makes a test useful?
A really good test, and one which would make us appear to be outstanding doctors, would be one which would always be positive in the
presence of a disease and would be totally specific for that disease alone;
such a test would never be positive in patients who did not have the disorder. What we mean is that what we are looking for are sensitive tests
that are specific for a given disease. Sadly, most tests are neither 100% sensitive nor 100% specific but some do come very close.
How to use tests and the laboratory
Rather than request tests in a shotgun or knee-jerk fashion, where every
box on a request form is ticked, it is far better to use the laboratory selectively. Even with the major advances in automation where tests are
batched and are cheaper, the hospital budget is finite and sloppy
requesting should be discouraged.
Outline your differential diagnoses: what are the likeliest diseases given
the patients history, examination findings and population the patient
comes from?

xxii

Decide which test(s) will help you make the diagnosis: request these and
review the diagnosis in the light of the test results. Review the patient
and arrange further investigations as necessary.
The downside of tests
It is important to remember that tests may often give normal results even
in the presence of disease. For example, a normal ECG in the presence of
chest pain does not exclude the occurrence of myocardial infarction with
100% certainty. Conversely, the presence of an abnormality does not necessarily imply that a disease is present. This, of course, is where clinical
experience comes into its ownthe more experienced clinician will be
able to balance the likelihood of disease with the results available even if
some of the test results give unexpected answers.
Sensitivity & specificity
Sensitivity

% of patients with the disease and in whom the test is
positive

Specificity

% of people without the disease in whom the test is
negative

Quick-fix clinical experience
This simply does not exist. Talking to patients and examining them for
physical signs and assimilating knowledge gained in medical school are
absolute requirements for attainment of sound clinical judgement. Those
students and doctors who work from books alone do not survive effectively at the coal face! It is a constant source of irritation to medical students and junior doctors, when a senior doctor asks for the results of an
investigation on the ward round and you find this test is the one that
clinches the diagnosis. How do they do it? Like appreciating good wine
they develop a nose for it. You can learn a great deal by watching your

Approach to investigation
registrar or consultant make decisions. This forms of basis of your own
clinical experience.

Laboratory errors and how to avoid
them
It is a fact of life that the sophisticated automated analysers in current use
are not 100% accurate 100% of the timebut they come pretty close. In
order to keep errors to a minimum, precautions need to be taken when
sampling biological material, e.g. blood.
Minimising spurious results using blood samples
2 Use correct bottle.
2 Fill to line (if anticoagulant used). This is less of a worry when vacuum
sample bottles are used since these should take in exactly the correct
amount of blood, ensuring the correct blood : anticoagulant ratio. This xxiii
is critical for coagulation tests.
2 Try to get the sample to the lab as quickly as possible. Blood samples
left lying around on warm windowsills, or even overnight at room temperature, will produce bizarre results, e.g. crenated RBCs and
abnormal-looking WBCs in old EDTA samples.
2 Try to avoid rupturing red cells when taking the sample (e.g. using
narrow gauge needle, prolonged time to collect whole sample) otherwise a haemolysed sample will be received by the lab. This may cause
spurious results for some parameters (e.g. [K+]).
2 Remember to mix (not shake) samples containing anticoagulant.
Variations in normal ranges in health
As discussed earlier, most of the normal ranges for blood parameters discussed in this book are for non-pregnant adults. The reason for this is that
blood values, e.g. Hb, RCC are high in the newborn and many FBC, coagulation and other parameters undergo changes in pregnancy.

in a specific area of the abdomen. In the history enquire specifically about
2 change in bowel habit 2 weight loss 2 associated pain.
Generalised swelling
Consider
2 Fat.
2 Fluid.
2 Faeces.

2 IVU to assess for renal tract calculi/pathology.
OHCM pp50, 462.

Alteration of behaviour
This is usually reported by a relative or friend rather than by the patient.
Often the patient will have little or no insight into the disease and taking a
history can be difficult. In addition to a full general and neurological physical examination a mental state examination is required.

1 Symptoms & signs

Anaemia
Reduced Hb, no specific cause implied (and not a diagnosis, so dont be
complacent): 9 <13.5g/dL, 3 <11.5g/dL. Often associated with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, poor concentration, shortness of breath
and dizziness. Older patients may experience palpitations and exacerbation of angina, congestive cardiac failure or claudication.
Signs
Pallor of conjunctivae and skin creases, nail pallor and koilonychia
(spoon-shaped nails, rare finding in severe chronic iron deficiency),
angular cheilitis and glossitis. Difficult to gauge anaemia from skin signs
alone.
Causes
Two common approaches to assess anaemia.
1. Red cell dynamics
2 4 RBC loss/breakdown, e.g. haemolysis (congenital or acquired) or
bleeding.
2 5 red cell production, e.g. vitamin/mineral deficiency, marrow suppression/infiltration, myelodysplasia, haemoglobin disorders (e.g. thalassaemia), chronic disease, renal failure.
2. Red cell indices
Microcytic/hypochromic

Macrocytic

Normocytic, normochromic

5 MCV, 5 MCHC
E.g. Fe deficiency, thalassaemia,
anaemia of chronic disease
4 MCV
Reticulocytosis (polychromasia on
blood film), B12/folate deficiency,
chronic liver disease, hypothyroidism,
alcohol, myelodysplasia
6 MCV & MCHC
Anaemia of chronic disease (e.g.
chronic infection, inflammatory disease
or malignancy), acute blood loss, renal
failure, myeloma

Investigations
FBC and film

Assessment of RBC indices helps direct investigation as above.

Microcytic
2 Check iron stores (ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor assay). Note:
ferritin is 4 in acute inflammation and may be misleading. Iron/TIBC no
longer used for assessment of iron deficiency ( p176).
2 Consider thalassaemia screening if not iron deficient.

If iron deficient assess dietary history (vegetarians) and look for risk
factors for blood loss and increased demands.
Premenopausal womenassess menstrual losses.
Pregnancy/infants/adolescence consider physiological (4 requirements).
All others: look for source of blood loss. GI tract is most common
source. Consider OGD and/or colonoscopy guided by symptoms and
barium studies.

Macrocytic
2 Reticulocyte count.
2 Serum B12 and red cell folate levels.
2 If folate deficient: assess dietary history and physiological requirements.
2 If B12 deficient: rarely dietary cause alone, usually an associated
pathology. Pernicious anaemia is the most common cause: check parietal cell antibodies (90% patients with PAare +ve, but seen in other
causes of gastric atrophy, especially in older individuals) and/or intrinsic
factor antibodies (+ve in only 50% with PA but specific). Consider ileal
disease and malabsorption.
2 LFT s.
2 Thyroid function.
Normocytic
2 Blood film.
10 2 ESR.
2 Renal function.
2 Consider myeloma screen in older adults (Igs, protein electrophoresis,
urine BJP. Skeletal survey of value if paraprotein or BJP).
2 Autoimmune screen to exclude connective tissue disease.
Haemolysis screen
2 FBC , MCV (4 due to reticulocytosis).
2 Blood film (spherocytes, polychromasia, bite cells and red cell fragmentation).
2 Reticulocyte count.
2 Bilirubin and serum LDH .
2 Haptoglobins (absent in haemolysis).
2 DAT (old term is direct Coombs test).
Consider
2 Congenital haemolytic anaemias: membrane defects, enzyme deficiencies (e.g. G6PD, pyruvate kinase).
2 DIC /microangiopathic haemolysisDIC screen.

Ankle oedema
Swollen ankles are a very common complaint. Is the swelling unilateral or
bilateral? Does it pit with digital pressure? Is there associated breathlessness? Is there ascites?
Causes of unilateral ankle oedema
2 Chronic venous insufficiency (especially post-DVT ).

Milroys disease ( OHCM section 19).

Causes of bilateral ankle oedema
2 Right ventricular failure2 to chronic lung disease.
2 Congestive cardiac failure (CCF )cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, etc.
2 Hypoalbuminaemianephrotic syndrome, hepatic cirrhosis, proteinlosing enteropathy, malnutrition (starvation or malabsorption),
(gravity).
2 Dependent oedema (immobility).
2 DrugsCa2+ channel blockers, NSAIDS .
2 Idiopathic/cyclical oedema syndrome.
2 Pregnancy.
2 Wet beriberi (rare in Western societies but commoner in Africa).
Essential investigations
2 U&E .
2 LFTS .
2 Urine dipstick for proteinuria.
2 Urine protein/creatinine ratio or 24h urine protein excretion.
2 CXR .
2 12-lead ECG .
2 Echocardiogram.

Consider
2 Liver USS .
2 Doppler studies of leg veins.
2 Contrast venography.
2 Filariasis serology/blood film.
2 Xylose breath test.
2 OGD with small bowel biopsy.
iAll the causes of unilateral ankle oedema may also cause bilateral
oedema.

Anorexia
This describes a loss of appetite for food, and is associated with a wide
range of disorders. In fact, anorexia is a fairly common consequence of
underlying disease, and represents a general undernourishment. Anorexia
per se is associated with increased morbidity especially when present in

11

Page 12

patients undergoing surgery; post-operative infection is commoner, as is
prolongation of the hospital stay.
The extent to which it will be investigated depends on the general status
of the patient, presence and duration of any symptoms or signs. Clinical
judgement will help!
Causes
2 Anorexia nervosa.
2 Depressive illness.
2 Stress.
2 Cancers: any, including carcinoma of stomach, oesophagus, metastatic,
leukaemia or lymphoma.
2 Drugs, including chemotherapy.
2 Radiotherapy.
2 Renal failure.
2 Hypercalcaemia.
2 Infections.
2 Cigarette smoking.
Investigations
2 Full history and examination.
2 FBC looking for anaemia or non-specific changes seen in underlying
disease.
12 2 ESRmay be elevated in inflammatory disorders.
2 U&E .
2 LFT s.
2 Serum Ca2+.
2 CXR (e.g. lung cancer, TB , etc.).
2 Cultures of blood, sputum, urine, stool if pyrexial and/or localising
symptoms or signs.

Anuria
Anuria denotes absent urine production. Oliguria (<400mL urine/24h) is
more common than anuria. A catheter must be passed to confirm an
empty bladder.
Causes
2 Urinary retentionprostatic hypertrophy, pelvic mass, drugs, e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, spinal cord lesions.
2 Blocked indwelling urinary catheter.
2 Obstruction of the ureterstumour, stone, sloughed papillae (bilateral).
2 Intrinsic renal failureacute glomerulonephritis, acute interstitial
nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, rhabdomyolysis.
2 Pre-renal failuredehydration, septic shock, cardiogenic shock.
An urgent ultrasound of the renal tract must be performed and any physical obstruction relieved as quickly as possible, directly (urethral catheter)
or indirectly (nephrostomy). iiRenal function and serum electrolytes must
be measured without delay.

Ataxia is an impaired ability to coordinate limb movements. There must
be no motor paresis (e.g. monoparesis) or involuntary movements (e.g.
the characteristic cog-wheel tremor in Parkinsons disease is not ataxia).
Ataxia may be
2 Cerebellar.
2 Vestibular.
2 Sensory.
Note: Many forms of ataxia are hereditary (but are uncommon).
Hereditary causes
2 Friedreichs ataxia.
2 Ataxia telangiectasia.
2 Spinocerebellar ataxia.
2 Corticocerebellar atrophy.
2 Olivopontocerebellar atrophy.

Bradycardia
If the heart rate is <60 beats/min, the patient, by definition, has a bradycardia (an arbitrary definition). Bradycardia may be transient, chronic or
intermittent. A slow pulse can be physiological (in trained athletes) but
may also be indicative of potentially serious cardiac disease.
Bradycardia may result from
2 Increased vagal tone.
2 Decreased sympathetic drive.
2 Cardiac drug therapy is a prominent cause, e.g.
 -adrenergic blockers (Note: -blocker eye drops (used in treatment of glaucoma) may be systemically absorbed causing bradycardia).
 Digoxin (AV block).
 Diltiazem.
 Verapamil.
 Amiodarone (Note: may also cause iatrogenic hypothyroidism).
iInjudicous combinations of these drugs may lead to serious bradycardia
or heart block. Consider self-accidental or deliberate self-poisoning
(includes opiates).
Other causes
2 During normal phases of sleep.
2 After fever (typhoid).

As a reflex response in hypertension (nephritis/phaeochromocytoma).
Complicating acute inferior myocardial infarction (usually transient).
Transientvasovagal, sick sinus syndrome.
Hypothyroidism (sinus bradycardia).
Increased intracranial pressure, e.g. cerebral tumour.
Hypothermia (Note: myxoedema coma).
Obstructive jaundice.
Hyperkalaemia (severe).
Phaeochromocytomawith hypertension (-adrenergic effect; rare
tachycardia more common).
Anorexia nervosa.

A thorough history and examination is mandatory (e.g. dizzy spells, blackouts; preceding or intercurrent chest pain; headache and other causes
include 4 intracranial pressure 4 ICP); cardiac amyloid, myocarditis, diphtheria, Chagas disease ( OHCM section 15).
Investigations
2 12-lead ECG look for junctional rhythm or heart block (1st degree,
2nd degree or complete); atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular
response (may be difficult to distinguish clinically from sinus bradycardia).

16

If there is a history of chest pain check cardiac enzymes
2 Serum creatine kinase (if >6h of onset of MI ).
2 Serum troponin I (if >8h of onset of symptoms).
2 Continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm on CCU .
Further investigations will be determined by ECG and clinical features
2 Check core temperature with low-reading thermometer
(?hypothermia).
2 J waves on ECG .
2 U&E .
2 TFT s (?hypothyroid).
2 LFT s (if cholestatic jaundice).
2 24h ECG, e.g. in suspected sick sinus syndrome.
2 Cranial CT if 4 ICP strongly suspected, e.g. if papilloedema.
OHCM pp88, 118.

Breathlessness
Dyspnoea is the perception of breathlessness and may be exertional or,
when more advanced, occur at rest. It may only occur when lying down
(orthopnoea). Is the breathlessness a recent development? Is it episodic?
Ask how far the patient can walk without stopping (often an unreliable
history) and how many pillows he/she uses in bed at night (in
orthopnoea). Look for digital clubbing, central cyanosis and chest wall
deformities.
Pulmonary causes
2 Pneumonia, e.g. bacterial, viral.

Bruising
Easy bruising is a common complaint and warrants careful assessment of
onset and nature. Recent onset of spontaneous and unusual bruising or
bleeding may suggest a serious acquired defect. A lifelong history of
bruising and bleeding (e.g. post-tonsillectomy, dental extraction or
surgery) may imply a congenital defect. Family history may be informative.
Examine: skin, mouth, dependent areas and fundi for mucocutaneous
bleeding and purpura (non-blanching haemorrhages into the skin).
Platelet causes
2 Thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction (e.g. aspirin).
2 Marrow failure, infiltration, ITP , DIC , hypersplenism, drugs or alcohol.
Vascular causes
2 Congenital, e.g. Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome.
2 Acquired, e.g. senile purpura, vasculitis (Henoch Schnlein purpura,
infection), diabetes, corticosteroid therapy, scurvy, connective tissue
diseases.
Coagulopathy
2 Congenitalmucocutaneous bruising is suggestive of a platelet-mediated defect (e.g. von Willebrands disease, Glanzmanns thrombasthenia) rather than clotting factor deficiency (e.g. haemophilia A and B).
2 Acquired, e.g. DIC , vitamin K deficiency.

duration of onset. Careful examination of the affected leg should be
extended to a full examination, particularly of abdominal and cardiovascular systems.
Causes
Venous and lymphatic
2 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT ).
2 Superficial thrombophlebitis.
2 Varicose veins.
2 Post-phlebitic limb (post-DVT ).

2 Pregnancy: increased dependent oedema but note also an 4 thrombotic risk and DVT should be excluded.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
Usually affects lower limb and can extend proximally into iliofemoral veins
and IVC with higher risk of associated PE and higher incidence of postphlebitic limb. Occasionally seen affecting upper limb but this is atypical.

Note: A typical presentations of cardiac ischaemia are well recognised; the 12-lead ECG may be
normal at presentation of acute cardiac ischaemia. Sometimes a period of observation in hospital
is required to exclude serious pathology. Increased availability of specific cardiac muscle protein
(troponin I or T) helps to stratify risk in patients with acute coronary syndromes.
Care should be taken to ensure that blood for estimation of cardiac enzymes (total CK or the
specific myocardial isoenzyme, CK-MB) is not taken too early, i.e. before a significant elevation can
occur (serum CK rises at 36h and peaks at ~24h after the onset of acute MI). Repeated testing
after an appropriate interval may be required.
The severity of pain is not always a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the disease. For
example, acute MI in patients with diabetes of long duration may present with minimal pain
(attributed to autonomic neuropathy). Conversely, severe chest pain may result from
oesophageal acid reflux.

OHCM pp76, 770.

Clubbing
Digital clubbing can affect fingers or toes. There is an increase in the soft
tissue so that the distal phalanx becomes larger in all directions. The angle
22 between the nail and the nail bed is lost, the nail becomes curved, both
longitudinally and laterally, and there is increased sponginess of the nail
bed.

1 Symptoms & signs
iIn the UK, driving regulations prohibit driving for 4 weeks after a simple
faint. If a cardiac or neurological cause is suspected driving must cease
until investigated and treated.

Dysarthria & dysphasia
Dysarthria is difficulty in articulating words. The patient may complain of
slurred speech. Dysphasia is a difficulty in the formation of speech due to
interference with higher mental function. These disturbances often occur
together, most commonly in the context of a stroke.
Damage to Wernickes area causes a receptive dysphasia. Speech may be
fluent but meaning is lost. Damage to Brocas area causes an expressive
dyphasia. Speech is non-fluent and the patient is aware they are not using
the right words.
Causes of dysphasia include stroke (usually with right hemiparesis, arm
more affected than leg) or space-occupying lesion. Psychosis, especially 31
schizophrenia, may cause a similar pictureso-called word salad.
Causes of dysarthria
2 Stroke (internal capsule or extensive lesion of motor cortexacute).
2 MND .
2 Mid-brain or brainstem tumour.
2 Parkinsons disease.
2 Cerebellar disease (haemorrhage, infarct, multiple sclerosis, hereditary
ataxia, alcoholic or paraneoplastic degeneration).
2 Syringobulbia (chronic, progressive).
2 Neuromuscular (myasthenia gravis, dermatomyositis, myotonic dystrophy).
2 Acute alcohol or drug intoxication.
Dysarthria may be more obvious when the (English-speaking!) patient is
invited to say Baby hippopotamus, British constitution, etc.
Investigations
2 Cranial CT scan.
2 Venous plasma glucose.
2 ESR .
2 Serum lipids.
2 12-lead ECG .
2 Echocardiogram.
2 Carotid doppler studies (especially if bruit).
2 CXR .
2 LFT s.
Less commonly
2 Serum muscle enzymes (polymyositis).
2 Autoimmune profile.

Dysphagia
Dysphagia is difficulty in swallowing. The patient may have associated
odynophagia (painful swallowing) or regurgitation of food (immediate or
delayed?). Elicit whether the dysphagia is for liquid, solids or both. Is it
intermittent or progressive? Are there associated symptoms?
A careful physical examination is mandatory. Pay special attention to the
lower cranial nerves; search for lymph nodes in the supraclavicular fossae.
Palpate the thyroid and percuss for retrosternal enlargement.
Causes
2 Oesophageal carcinoma.
2 Benign oesophageal stricture secondary to chronic acid reflux.
2 Barretts oesophagus.
2 Achalasia or diffuse spasm.
2 Stroke (bilateral internal capsule CVA spseudo-bulbar palsy).
32 2 Oesophageal web (+ iron deficiency anaemia = Plummer Vinson
(Patterson Kelly Brown) syndrome).
2 Pharyngeal pouch.
2 Muscular problem (myasthenia gravis, dermatomyositis, myotonic dystrophy).
2 Bulbar palsy (MS , MND , poliomyelitis).
2 Scleroderma (including CREST syndrome
OHCM section 11).
2 Infection (usually acute pain on swallowing).
2 Mediastinal mass (goitre, carcinoma of the bronchus, enlarged left
atrium, aortic aneurysm).
Investigations
2 FBC .
2 ESR .
2 Upper GI endoscopy.
2 Barium swallow.
2 CXR .
2 Oesophageal manometry studies (
p353).
2 Cranial CT or MRI (if neurological signs).
2 Acetylcholine (AC h) receptor antibodies and Tensilon (edrophonium).

1 Symptoms & signs

Facial pain
Is the pain unilateral or bilateral? Is it constant or intermittent? Are there
precipitating factors or trigger points?
A full examination of the head and neck is required in addition to a
detailed neurological and systemic examination.
Causes
2 Trigeminal neuralgia (TN ).
2 Temporal arteritis (TA). iiRisk of visual loss (
OHCM section 11).
2 Herpes zoster (shingles or post-herpetic neuralgia).
2 Dental caries, sepsis.
2 Sinusitis.
2 Temporomandibular joint dysfunction.
2 Cluster headache.
2 Glaucoma.
2 Angina pectoris.
2 Tonsillitis.
2 Syringobulbia.
2 Atypical facial neuralgia.
2 Migraine.
Investigations
2 ESR urgent in suspected TA .
2 Temporal artery biopsy if TA strongly suspected. (iiMust be performed rapidlywithin daysif steroid treatment is commenced.
However, do not withhold corticosteroid therapy for this reason!)
Because of skip lesions, false negative biopsies may be encountered.
Be guided by the full clinical picture rather than reliance on a single
test.
2 Plain radiographs or CT imaging of frontal or maxillary sinuses.
2 MRI to exclude MS , basilar aneurysm, trigeminal schwannoma, neurofibroma as causes of TN.
2 MRI of cervical spinal cord to exclude syringobulbia if pain is accompanied by brainstem signs.
Headache (p43).
OHCM pp5859.

Faints
The circumstances surrounding the faint, collapse or blackout are often
good clues to the cause. The history of an eyewitness can be particularly
valuable.

Simple (vasovagal) faint
2 Hot room, crowded, emotional, painful circumstances.
2 Occurs whilst standing (or sitting).
2 Brief loss of consciousness.
2 Classic stigmata of generalised tonic-clonic epilepsy are usually absent.
Cardiac cause
2 Chest pain, palpitations, breathlessness may precede collapse.
2 Brief, rapid loss of consciousness; prompt recovery in transient
arrhythmia.
2 Classic sequential pallor, cyanosis and flushing in Stokes-Adams attacks.
Neurological cause
2 Limb or facial weakness, dysphasia, etc.
2 Central cyanosis, tonic-clonic convulsions.
2 Gradual return to normal level of consciousness, e.g. post-ictally.
iRemember hypoglycaemia (neuroglycopenia).
A detailed physical examination, paying particular attention to cardiovascular and neurological systems, should be performed.
Postural blood pressure response should be carefully recorded (i.e. after
lying supine for at least 5min and again on standingcare to avoid col34 lapse in patients with marked postural hypotension).
2

A 12-lead ECG should be performed in all adults.

Other investigations as clinically indicated
2 24h ambulatory ECG .
2 Echocardiogram (to exclude aortic stenosis if murmur audible).
2 Tilt table test (
p322).
2 Carotid doppler studies.
2 V/Q scan (if any suspicion of pulmonary embolism).
2 Cranial CT .
2 EEG .
Consider cough- or micturition-, effort- or carotid sinus syncope syndromes. In the UK, regulations prohibit driving for 4 weeks after a simple
faint. If a cardiac or neurological cause is suspected driving must cease
until appropriately investigated and treated.
OHCM p334.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO or PUO)
Defined as T >38.3C on several occasions lasting 3 weeks or more. It is
very important to take a full history and consider infectious contacts,
recent travel abroad, recent surgery and dental treatment, sexual history
and risk factors for HIV.

Take a careful history, preferably from a witness as well as the patient.
Most lay persons will recognise a generalised tonic-clonic fit. However,
the occurrence of a few epileptiform movements in patients with syncopal episodes ( Faints p33) may cause diagnostic uncertainty.
Be sure to ask about
2 Aura preceding episode. iTemporal lobe epilepsyolfactory or gustatory auras (not necessarily followed by convulsions).
2 Loss of consciousnesshow long? Often overestimated by witnesses!
2 Tongue biting.
2 Focal or generalised convulsive movements. Note: A clear history of a
tonic-clonic fit commencing in a limb and progressing to a more generalised convulsion is highly suggestive of a structural intracerebral lesion;
cranial imaging is mandatory.
2 Central cyanosis (tonic phase).
2 Urinary incontinence.
2 Injuries.
2 Post-ictal confusion.
2 History of trauma.
2 Alcohol intake. Remember: alcohol withdrawal fits as well as acute
intoxication.
2 Drug historyprescribed and recreational.
2 History of insulin-treated diabetes or type 2 diabetes treated with oral
secretagogues, i.e. sulphonylureas, repaglinide, nateglinide. Note that
36
metformin and thiazolidinediones as monotherapy do not cause significant hypoglycaemia.
A full general and neurological examination is needed,
specifically including
2 Fever.
2 Meningism, i.e. nuchal rigidity, +ve Kernigs sign (meningoencephalitis).
2 Cutaneous rash or ecchymoses (?bleeding diathesis).
2 Evidence of head trauma (preceding fit or as a consequence).
2 Signs of chronic liver disease.
2 Focal neurological deficit. iThird nerve palsy in intracranial space- occupying lesion (SOL), including aneurysm of the posterior communicating
artery. Sixth nerve lesion may act as a false localising sign in 4 ICP.
2 MedicAlert bracelet (history of epilepsy or diabetessearch personal
belongings).
Bilateral extensor plantar reflexes can occur after a generalised fit without
a structural brain lesion and there may be a transient hemiparesis (Todds
paresis).
Causes
2 Epilepsy (
OHCM section 10).
2 Hypoglycaemia (acute, severe, history of diabetes?).
2 Hyponatraemia (usually <110mmol/L or rapid development).
2 Hypocalcaemia (
OHCM section 17).
2 Hypomagnesaemia (may accompany hypocalcaemia).
2 Hypophosphataemia (rare).
2 Alcohol withdrawal. iiRisk of associated hypoglycaemia.
2 Discontinuation of anticonvulsant medication.
2 Infectionviral encephalitis or bacterial meningitis. iiConsider

2 Serum or urine drug screen.
Pseudo-seizures may be encountered in patients with atypical recurrent
fits (usually long history of epilepsy) and this is unlikely in an adult presenting with a first fit. In UK, the national driving license authority prohibits
driving for 12 months following a first fit.
OHCM p364.

Galactorrhoea
Denotes inappropriate breast milk production, i.e. in the absence of pregnancy. The most common cause is hyperprolactinaemia (4 PRL) due to a
pituitary microprolactinoma of <10mm diameter ( p132). Prolactinomas
(usually macroadenomas) may cause galactorrhoea in men.
Note: Other disease in the pituitary region, certain drugs and several systemic disorders may be associated with 4 PRL ( OHCM section 9).
Causes
Normoprolactinaemic galactorrhoea
2 This has been described in pre-menopausal women occurring after the
conclusion of:
 Treatment with the combined contraceptive pill.

 Breastfeeding (for >6 months afterwards).
Increased sensitivity of lactogenic tissue prolactin (PRL) is postulated
but the mechanism remains uncertain. In part, this may reflect difficulties that can arise in determining whether PRL is persistently elevated.
Menstrual disturbances have been described.

Hyperprolactinaemia
2 The differential diagnosis and investigation of hyperprolactinaemia is
considered on p132.
Investigations
2 Serum PRL (Endocrinology & Metabolism
p132).
2 Repeated measurements under controlled conditions may be required
since PRL is a stress hormone and may be increased by venepuncture.
Note: If 4 PRL is confirmed, further investigations to exclude causes other
than prolactinoma are required.
2

Pituitary imaging (CT, or preferably, MRI) and visual field testing
(Goldmann) may also be indicated if a macroprolactinoma is suspected
(PRL concentrations usually very high).

Note: If there is doubt about the nature of the nipple discharge further
specialised investigations may be required on the fluid, including:
38 2 Casein.
2 Lactose.
2 Microscopy.
Clear fluid may result from benign breast disease.
Note: Bloody discharge should prompt urgent specialist investigations to
exclude carcinoma of the breast:
2 Mammography.
2 Biopsy.

Gout
Gout is a disease of deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in tissues and relates to hyperuricaemia. Hyperuricaemia is due to an
imbalance between purine synthesis and uric acid excretion. Episodes of
acute gout may be precipitated by alcohol, trauma, dietary changes, infection, chemotherapy or surgery. More common in men and very rare in
pre-menopausal women.
Clinical features
2 Inflammatory arthritis, classically a monoarthritis or oligoarthritis
affecting 1st MTP joint of foot but can affect any joint including the
spine.

Tophiurate deposits in tendons, ear pinna and joints.
Urolithiasis and renal disease.

Investigation
2 ESR (may be 4).
2 Urate crystals demonstrated in synovial fluid or tissuesnegatively
birefringent on polarised light microscopy.
2 Serum urate (not always 4 in acute episode, and normal urate level
does not exclude the diagnosis).
2 XR soft tissue swelling and punched out bony erosions.
2 AIP (to exclude rheumatoid).
2 Microscopy of synovial fluid (Gram stain and culture).
Treatment
Acute episode
2 NSAID s, colchicine, intra-articular steroids or oral steroids.
2 Avoid precipitating factors and purine-rich foods.
2 Urate lowering therapy indicated for tophi, recurrent attacks and
urine/renal disease, e.g.
 Allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor).
 Probenecid (uricosuric).
Note: Asymptomatic hyperuricaemia is more common than gout and a
high serum urate with coexistent arthritis is not necessarily due to crystal
deposition. Consider important other causes especially infective arthritis
and pseudo-gout.
Pseudo-gout
Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition causing acute arthritis or chondrocalcinosis. Crystals are weakly +ve birefringent on polarised light
microscopy. Associations include old age, dehydration, hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, haemochromatosis, acromegaly, rheumatoid
arthritis and osteoarthritis.
OHCM p404.

Gynaecomastia
Gynaecomastia is benign bilateral hyperplasia of glandular and fatty breast
tissue in the male. The balance between androgens and oestrogens is
thought to be of importance in the pathogenesis; many conditions may
influence this ratio. Most commonly, it appears transiently during normal
puberty (detectable at some stage in ~50% cases). Gynaecomastia may
also be caused by specific endocrine disease or be associated with certain
chronic diseases. Treatment with certain drugs is a common cause (~30%
of cases) and arises via several mechanisms. Investigations will be guided

39

Page 40

by the individual circumstances. A careful drug history and thorough physical examination are required, particularly in the post-adolescent period.
When indicated, and after excluding causes such as congenital
syndrome and drug therapy, investigations are principally
directed at:
2 Excluding endocrine carcinoma (rare).
2 Identifying associated chronic diseases.
Note:
2 Simple obesity is not usually a cause of true gynaecomastia, i.e. the
glandular element is not increased.
2 4 Serum prolactin (PRL ) in isolation does not cause gynaecomastia.
2 Unilateral, eccentric breast enlargement should prompt exclusion of
breast carcinoma (rare).
Causes include
2 Physiological states (transient):
 Newborn.
 Puberty.
 Advanced age.
2 Klinefelters syndrome (47, XXY ; mosaics).
2 Secondary hypogonadism, e.g mumps orchitis.
2 Androgen resistance syndromes, e.g. testicular feminisation.
40 2 4 Tissue aromatase activity (converts androgens to oestrogens).
2 Oestrogen-producing tumours:
 Leydig cell tumour.
 Sertoli cell tumour.
 Adrenal carcinoma.
2 Chronic liver disease.
2 Chronic renal failure.
2 Panhypopituitarism.
2 Tumours producing human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG ).
2 Drugs: oestrogens (prostatic carcinoma, transsexuals), spironolactone,
cimetidine, digoxin, cytotoxic agents, marijuana.
2 Hyperthyroidism (4 serum sex-hormone-binding globulin, SHBG ).
2 Primary hypothyroidism.
2 Cushings syndrome.
2 Carcinoma of bronchus.
2 Idiopathic.
Investigations
2 Testosterone.
2 FSH .
2 LH .
2 LFT s.
2 TFT s.
2 Oestradiol.
2 -hCG .
2 PRL .
2 SHBG (affinity of SHBG is higher for testosterone than for oestrogens,
therefore 4 SHBG causes disproportionate 5 in free testosterone
levels).
2 Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS ).

Haemoptysis
This describes coughing up blood or blood-stained sputum, and can vary
from faint traces of blood to frank bleeding. Before embarking on investigations it is essential to ensure that the blood is coughed up from the respiratory tract and is not that of epistaxis or haematemesis (easily
confused).
Causes
2 Infective, e.g. acute respiratory infection, exacerbation of COPD .
2 Pulmonary infarction, e.g. PE .
2 Lung cancer.
2 Tuberculosis.
2 Pulmonary oedema.
2 Bronchiectasis.

Goodpastures syndrome, microscopic vasculitis, trauma, haematological disease (e.g. ITP or DIC).
Investigations
2 Colour of blood provides clues (pink frothy in pulmonary oedema,
rust-coloured in pneumonia).
2 Check O2 saturation.

Headache
Facial pain (p33).
Headache is an extremely common complaint. Most patients self-medicate and only a small proportion will seek medical advice. Headache may
be acute or chronic, constant, recurrent or gradually progressive. It may
arise from structures within the cranial vault or from external causes
( OHCM section 7).
Causes differ according to age; temporal arteritis is very uncommon in
patients under ~55 years, for example. Migraine may be associated with
classic features ( OHCM section 7). Remember to enquire about the 43
combined oral contraceptive pillmay exacerbate migraine. Tension
headaches predominate.
Causes in adults include
2 Tension headache (very common; usually recurrent and stereotyped).
2 Migraine. Although common, many patients who believe they have
migraine probably have tension headaches. Classic migraine predominantly affects adolescents and young adults.
2 Cluster headaches.
2 As part of a generalised viral illness, e.g. flu.
2 Causes of 4 ICP (
OHCM section 7).
2 Acute infective meningitis (bacterial, viral most commonly).
2 Encephalitis (most commonly viral, e.g. herpes simplex).
2 Intracerebral haemorrhage.
2 Post-traumatic (common).
2 Intracerebral tumour (primary or secondary, benign or malignant).
2 Acute subarachnoid haemorrhage.
2 Subdural haematoma.
2 Acute glaucoma.
2 Acute sinusitis.
2 Rubeosis iridis (secondary glaucoma in patients with advanced diabetic
eye disease).
2 Trigeminal neuralgia.
2 Referred pain, e.g. from dental caries or sepsis.
2 Arterial hypertension; malignant or accelerated phase; essential hypertension is rarely the cause of headache.
2 Temporal arteritis (TA ). iiVisual loss preventable with prompt corticosteroid therapy ( OHCM section 7).
2 Venous sinus thrombosis.
2 Benign intracranial hypertension (mimics intracerebral tumour).

Heart failure
Heart failure may be acute or chronic. The prevalence of heart failure in
the elderly is ~10% in industrialised nations.
The term heart failure includes the clinicopathological
syndromes of
2 Congestive cardiac failure.
2 Left ventricular failure/pulmonary oedema (these terms are not synonymous!).
2 Right heart failure (including cor pulmonale).
The concepts of pre-load and after-load are helpful in considering the
pathophysiology of heart failure.
Note
2 Fluid overload in CRF is sometimes misinterpreted as evidence of
cardiac failure.
2 The development of arrhythmias, e.g. AF (
OHCM section 5) may
precipitate heart failure in predisposed patients.
2 Anaemia and thyrotoxicosis (iamiodarone!) may exacerbate cardiac
syndromes including heart failure.

Hepatomegaly
Measure liver edge below the (R) costal margin after percussing out the
upper and lower borders. Bruits may be heard in hepatoma and a friction
rub may occur with malignant deposits. Other signs may suggest the
underlying diagnosis (see below).
Common causes
2 CCF .
2 Malignant deposits.
2 Hepatitis/cirrhosis (usually alcoholic or infectious, e.g. EBV , viral
hepatitis).
Foreign residence?
If so, consider amoebic and hydatid cysts, schistosomiasis, malaria.

Hypertension
Hypertension is very common; the diagnosis is arbitrary and requires
repeated measurements using a reliable method. Thresholds for therapeutic intervention vary according to:
2 The presence of other risk factors for CVD.
2 Hypertension is common in patients with type 2 DM (up to 70%) in
which it is regarded as part of the insulin resistance syndrome (syndrome X) of 4 CVD risk.
2 Evidence of target organ damage (myocardium, kidneys, etc.). Note
that in assessment, the sensitivity of tests should be borne in mind.
Thus, sensitivity for detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) =
echocardiogram > 12 lead ECG > clinical examination.
2 The prevalence of hypertension 4 with age. Obesity, excessive etOH
and a high salt, low K+ diet are associated with higher BP. Racial associations (e.g. higher prevalence in African-Caribbeans, African-Americans
cf. white Europeans) are well recognised. A family history of hypertension and premature CHD should be sought.
2 Some uncommon causes of hypertension, e.g. Conns syndrome, are
potentially curable. Others, e.g. phaeochromocytoma, are potentially
lethal if unrecognised.
2 Accelerated or malignant hypertension is uncommon, but may cause
severe target organ damage. A detailed history and thorough physical
examination are mandatory in all patients.
2 iiNumerous pitfalls in the simple process of measuring BP !
Causes
Essential hypertensionby far the most common cause (>90% of cases).

Secondary causes
2 Acute or, more commonly, chronic renal disease.
2 Coarctation of the aorta.
2 Eclampsia (acute).
2 Endocrine disease (Cushings syndrome, Conns syndrome, phaeochromocytoma, acromegaly, diabetic nephropathy, primary hypothyroidism,
hyperthyroidism, primary hyperparathyroidism).
2 Inherited syndromes (rare), e.g. Liddles syndrome, some forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, glucocorticoid suppressible hyperaldosteronism.
2 Drugscorticosteroids, NSAID s, combined contraceptive pill, erythropoietin, liquorice, carbenoxolone.
Investigations may be required in the following
2 Confirming the diagnosis of sustained hypertension.
2 Determining the cause of hypertension.
2 Assessing the severity of target organ damage.
2 Calculating risk of CVD for the individual (this guides the need for
pharmacological intervention). Published tables are available.
2 If endocrine or renal cause suspected seek an expert opinion at an
early stage before embarking upon detailed investigations.
Routine investigations
2 ECG (LVH , ischaemia, hypokalaemia of Conns, diuretic Rx).
48 2 CXR (cardiac size, LVF, rib notching of coarctation).
2 Echocardiography (more sensitive in detecting LVH ).
2 U&E .
2 Venous plasma glucose; fasting or casual. Unsuspected type 2 DM is
relatively common in middle-aged/elderly. Degrees of glucose intolerance more common if a sensitive diagnostic test, i.e. OGTT used.
2 ESR (e.g. autoimmune renal disease).
2 Serum lipid profile.
2 Serum uric acid (may be elevated in hypertension, renal impairment.
Hyperuricaemia is a putative CVD risk factor).
2 Urinalysis (protein, glucoseless sensitive in detecting glucose intolerance than blood glucose testing, microscopic haematuria).
2 MSU (exclude infection if there is proteinuria).
2 Urine microscopy (castshyaline or granular).
2 24h urinary protein or
2 Urinary albumin/creatine ratio (
p442) if proteinuria on dipstick
testing.
Confirmation of diagnosis or attainment of BP targets
2 24h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM ) in selected cases, e.g. suspected
white coat hypertension. The evidence base for ABPM is less robust
than for conventional BP measurements using the sphygmomanometer.
2 Self-monitoring of BP by patients at homethis is becoming more
popular and may provide useful complementary information.
Endocrine hypertension
2 Renin/aldosterone studies (consult local endocrine laboratory).
2 Investigations for Cushings syndrome (
p111).
2 Investigations for acromegaly.
2 Urinary catecholamines/metabolites.

1 Symptoms & signs

Indigestion
This term is often loosely used by patients to describe a variety of symptoms. These are often regarded as representing relatively minor and
usually intermittent pathology. However, serious pathology, e.g. carcinoma of the stomach, may present as a vague complaint of indigestion.
The symptoms may be retrosternal or abdominal. A detailed history is
essential, focusing on features that raise the probability of serious
pathology, e.g. dysphagia and weight loss.
Examination should include a search for the following signs,
particularly in the middle-aged and elderly patients
2 Anaemia (especially iron deficiencycommon).
2 Ascites.
2 Troissiers sign (malignant involvement of left supraclavicular lymph
nodes due to carcinoma of the stomachrare).
Note: The presence of associated pathologies, e.g. pernicious anaemia
( OHCM section 7)4 risk of stomach cancerwill alter the threshold
for more detailed, expert investigation. Carcinoma of stomach is more 51
common in Japanese.
Peptic ulceration may have classic elements that point to the diagnosis.
Non-ulcer dyspepsia is very common and is often treated empirically with
antacids, H2 receptor antagonists or H+ pump inhibitor drugs. The clinical
challenge is to identify the patient for whom more detailed, and often
invasive, investigation is indicated.
Alternative causes, e.g. cardiac ischaemia, should be considered in the differential diagnosis; similarity of the symptoms between cardiac and upper
gastrointestinal disorders are well recognised and sometimes pose considerable diagnostic difficulties.
Causes include
2 Oesophageal acid reflux.
2 Hiatus hernia.
2 Inflammatory disease.
2 Peptic ulcer disease of duodenum or stomach.
2 Biliary colic (usually distinctive clinical features).
2 Malignancy of oesophagus, stomach or rarely small intestine.
2 Cardiac symptoms, usually ischaemia.
2 Irritable bowel syndrome.
2 Symptoms arising from other structures within the chest or abdomen.
Investigations
2 FBC .
2 U&E .
2 ESR .
2 Upper GI endoscopy  tissue biopsy.
2 LFT s.

Barium swallow and meal (for oesophageal disease).
CLO test for Helicobacter. pylori.
Urea 13C breath test for H. pylori.

If diagnosis remains uncertain consider
2 CT abdomen (discuss with radiologist).
2 Serum gastrin (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,
OHCM p738).
2 24h ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring.
2 Oesophageal manometry (oesophageal motility disorders).

Irregular pulse
An irregular pulse may be detected by the patient (perceived as palpitations or dropped beats), more commonly, by a health care professional.
It may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, acute, intermittent or chronic.
An irregular pulse may arise from a variety of pathological causes, most
52 frequently coronary heart disease (CHD), or be an isolated finding, e.g. socalled lone atrial fibrillation (AF) for which no cause can be identified.
Investigations are directed towards
2 Determining the nature of the arrhythmia.
2 Elucidating its cause.
2 Identifying associated pathologies that:
 Might influence treatment, e.g. presence of left atrial hypertrophy
(may reduce chances of long-term restoration of sinus rhythm after
DC cardioversion for AF; contraindications to anticoagulation).
 May exacerbate the symptoms, e.g. anaemia.
2 Establishing global risk of CVD (lipids, presence of DM , hypertension,
as indicated).
Note: AF is very common, especially in the elderly (prevalence approaches
10% in over 80s in UK).
Causes
2 Multiple ventricular or atrial ectopic beats (very commonoften
asymptomatic).
2 AF (common but may be paroxysmal).
2 Atrial flutter with variable atrioventricular block (common).
2 Complete heart block (uncommonmay be transient following inferior MI).
Note: Remember drugs as a cause or aggravating factor, e.g. theophylline
or other -adrenergic stimulants (ectopic beats).
Initial investigations
2 12-lead ECG .
2 U&E .

FBC.

Consider
2 Continuous inpatient cardiac monitoring (e.g. if acute or associated
with MI, heart failure).
2 CXR (heart size, valvular calcification, etc., (
p497503).
2 24h cardiac tape.
2 Echocardiography (to identify predisposing or associated structural
lesions of valves and myocardium, LV function, etc.).
2 Investigations for CHD if indicated, e.g treadmill test for suspected
CHD.
2 Elucidate cause of AF (TFT s, GT , etc.).

Jaundice
This defines the yellow discoloration of the sclerae, mucous membranes
and skin that occurs when bilirubin accumulates. Bilirubin is the major bile 53
pigment in humans, and is produced as an end-product of haem catabolism. Jaundice usually only becomes noticeable when the serum bilirubin
>3060mol/L.
Causes
2 Can be pre-hepatic, hepatic or post-hepatic.
2 Haemolysis.
2 Hepatitis (viral, drugs, alcohol).
2 Pregnancy.
2 Recurrent cholestasis.
2 Hepatic infiltration.
2 Stones in the common bile duct.
2 Carcinoma of the bile duct, head of pancreas or ampulla.
2 Biliary strictures.
2 Sclerosing cholangitis.
2 Pancreatitis.
Investigations
2 FBC (?haemolysis).
2 Clotting screen (often deranged in liver disease).
2 LFT s.
2 Viral serology for HAV , HBV and HCV .
2 USS abdomen.
2 Consider ERCP .

Although we have provided a large list of possibilities common sense
should be used in determining the cause. For example, an 80-year-old
woman with axillary lymphadenopathy is unlikely to have cat-scratch
disease! Common things are common.

Myocardial infarction
Classically, the presentation is with severe, acute, central crushing chest
pain that may radiate into the arm (especially7left) and/or the neck;
associated with systemic features including sweating, nausea ( p59) and
dyspnoea (if LVF).
Note: Occasionally, an acute MI may be clinically silent, e.g. in patients
with long duration DM. Atypical symptoms, e.g. non-classic pain or presentation as collapse or acute confusional state in the elderly.
Classic 12-lead ECG changes ( OHCM section 5) comprise ST elevation of
2mm in consecutive lateral leads or 1mm elevation in the limb leads). Less
commonly, a posterior MI is evident as an R wave in V1 and V2 leads and
deep ST depression in the anterior leads. Sometimes ECG changes are
absent at presentation or presentation is late and an MI is diagnosed by a
raised serum makers of myocardial damage, notably troponin I and/or LDH
(remains for 23 weeks). Check for pathological Q waves.

Other causes of cardiac chest pain must be excluded
2 Aortic dissection (
OHCM section 5) may mimic an MI especially if
the dissection involves the right coronary artery (leading to ST elevation in the inferior leads, II, II and AVF). Severe tearing pain radiating to
the inter-scapular area is suggestive. If the diagnosis is considered likely
perform urgent echocardiography and consider:
1. Spiral CT of thorax
2. MRI of thorax
2

Acute pericarditis may need to be excluded by the history, the ECG
classically demonstrating saddle-shaped ST elevation. T wave inversion and low voltages (if pericardial effusion) are also recognised; the
ESR may be markedly raised.

Note: Transient pericarditis is a complication of acute MI within days;
Dresslers syndrome may occur several weeks later (may be associated
with systemic symptoms and positive serum antimyocardial antibodies).
Additional investigations
These are required after the diagnosis has been made and thrombolysis
started if the criteria for treatment are met

p307).
2 ABG s (if LVF or cardiogenic shock).
2 Echocardiogram (if LVF , chordae tendinae rupture, aortic dissection or
acute VSD suspected).
2 Early angiography with view to 1 angioplasty or CABG in selected
patients (specialist cardiology opinion requiredmay be indicated if
response to thrombolysis is inadequate).
2 Risk factors for an MI should be assessed to guide 2 prevention measures.
2 Serum lipid profile (

2 Venous plasma glucose (Note: acute MI may be associated with transient hyperglycaemia ( p144 for investigations and management)).
2 Vasculitis screen, if the history suggestive (rare cause of MI ).
2 Echocardiogramto assess LV function.
Tests that are usually done as an outpatient are
2 Exercise tolerance testif significant ST changes occur during exercise
or in recovery, or if the time tolerated on the treadmill is limited,
referral to a cardiologist for consideration of angiography might be
appropriate ( p529). Assess the BP response to exercise (a fall is a
poor prognostic sign).
2 Adenosine stress tests may be performed if physical disability limits exercise. Radioisotope scanning can help identify any reversible ischaemia
( p561). Discuss indications with nuclear medicine department.
2 Coronary angiography is the gold standard and will demonstrate
coronary artery architecture, plaque distribution and LV function
( OHCM p92).

Nausea
The so-called vomiting centre is located in the medulla oblongata and is
stimulated by the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the 4th ventricle. There
are many causes of acute and chronic nausea. These can be divided into
gastrointestinal (GI) causes and non-GI causes.
GI causes of nausea
2 Food poisoning (viral, bacterialcommon).
2 Acute and chronic gastritis (remember Helicobacter pylori).
2 Peptic ulceration.
2 Biliary and renal colic.
2 Inflammatory bowel disease.
2 Cholecystitis.
2 Appendicitis.
2 Pancreatitis.

Nystagmus
An involuntary oscillatory or (more commonly) rapid jerking movement
of the eyes that is rhythmic and repetitive. It results from acute or chronic
lesions of the eight cranial nerves, brainstem or cerebellum. The slow
phase is pathological, the rapid rhythmic jerking phase (used arbitrarily to
define the direction of nystagmus) being a corrective response. Nystagmus 61
to the right describes the direction of the quick phase. Such saw tooth
nystagmus may be evident in the horizontal or vertical plane (including
downbeat nystagmus of foramen magnum lesions) or as oscillations
around a central point (e.g. in albinism).
Jerk nystagmus may be graded in severity depending on whether it occurs
2 Only in the direction of directed gaze.
2 When eyes are in the midline or
2 Is present even on looking in direction contralateral to the rapid movement.
Note: Nystagmus (or more correctly, nystagmoid jerks) may be induced by
inappropriate testing, often being present at the extremes of gaze. Do not
ask patient to follow visual target beyond ~30 of midline when testing at
the bedside.
In unilateral causes
Cerebellar nystagmus
Greatest when gaze directed towards the side of the destructive lesion.
Vestibular nystagmus
Greatest away from the side of the lesion.
Pathological nystagmus
May be due to labyrinthine and vestibular lesionsoccurs in one direction
only. If visual fixation is removed, nystagmus becomes worse.
Central lesions
Including brainstem lesions caused by e.g. tumour, MS; cerebellar lesions
or medial longitudinal fasciculus lesions leading to internuclear ophthalmoplegia ( OHCM section 10) with ataxic nystagmus.

Page 62

Investigations
2 Positional nystagmus may be investigated by using the Hallpike
manoeuvre ( OHCM section 10). Abrupt alteration of the spatial
position of the head (from supine, with head below the bed, rapidly to
a sitting position) will induce nystagmus. This will demonstrate benign
positional vertigo (common), vestibular disorders or brainstem lesions.
2 Audiometry (specialised investigation).
2 Auditory and visual evoked potentials (VEP s) may be pathologically
reduced in MS. Examination of CSF may reveal oligoclonal bands.
2 MRI to include brainstem. (Upbeat nystagmus will suggest a midbrain
lesion and downbeat nystagmus will suggest a foramen magnum
lesion.) MRI is superior to CT for demonstrating cerebellopontine
angle lesions. Gadolinium enhancement is used to investigate acoustic
neuromas.
2 Ototoxicity can be caused by some drugs such as gentamicin and
phenytoin. Acute poisoning with alcohol or barbiturates may cause
transient nystagmus. Chronic alcoholism can lead to permanent cerebellar damage. Excessive doses of anticonvulsant drugs, e.g. phenytoin,
are a common causemeasure serum concentrations of drug.

1 Symptoms & signs
Aetiology
The great majority of obese subjects have no identifiable metabolic or
hormonal defects and detailed investigation is rarely indicated. A chronic
imbalance of the equation with energy intake (dietary calories) on the one
hand and expenditure (resting metabolic rate + physical activity) on the
other is thought to be responsible. Reduced levels of habitual activity
allied to an abundance of energy-dense foods appears to account for the
current pandemic of obesity and related disorders:
2 Impaired glucose regulation.
2 Type 2 DM .
2 Dyslipidaemia.
2 Hypertension.
2 CVD .
2 Osteoarthritis.
2 Impaired physical functioning.
2 Gout.
2 4 Surgical risk.
2 Depression.
2 Certain cancers, e.g. bowel, breast.
Weight gain tends to occur in middle age; 3 are more at risk than 9.
Socioeconomic factors are also important.
Specific causes
Genetic
E.g. Prader-Willi syndrome, Laurence-Moon (Biedl-Bardet) syndrome.
Single gene defects
E.g. mutations of leptin (provides feedback from adipocytes to hypothalamus about body fat stores) or its hypothalamic receptor (very rare).
Hypothalamic lesions
Lesions which damage the ventromedial nucleus (the satiety area) may
lead to obesity.
Lesions include
2 Trauma.
2 Tumourscraniopharyngiomas and astrocytomas.
2 Inflammationsuch as TB and meningitis.
2 Infiltrationhistiocytosis and sarcoidosis.
Cushings syndrome
With buffalo hump and central obesity.
Hypothyroidism
Disputed unless severe myxoedema, but hyperthyroidism is associated
with unphysiological weight loss.
Insulinoma
Often associated with moderate weight gain; rare.

Pancytopenia
Pancytopenia (5Hb, 5WBC and 5platelets) may occur because of bone
marrow failure (hypoplasia) or inefficient production (MDS) or peripheral
destruction of cells or sequestration (splenomegaly/hypersplenism).
iiPancytopenia usually means something is seriously wrong.
Bone marrow assessment is necessary to establish whether the marrow is
hypocellular or hypercellular in the face of peripheral blood pancytopenia.
If hypercellular, the cause may be an infiltrative process (due to
66 leukaemia/carcinoma, granulomatous disease, fibrosis-myelofibrosis,
osteosclerotic-osteopetrosis, increased macrophages-haemophagocytic
syndromes due to viral infections). Causes of hypoplastic bone marrow
failure may be hereditary (e.g. Fanconis anaemia) or acquired (e.g. drugs).
Critically ill patients may develop pancytopenia for multiple reasons
(sepsis, haemorrhage, DIC).
Investigations
2 FBC , film (aplastic anaemia usually presents with 5 lymphocyte count
but minor morphological changes).
2 Reticulocytes (5 if production failure).
2 Serum vitamin B12, folate (megaloblastic anaemia can be associated
with pancytopenia).
2 Serology for EBV , hepatitis A, B, C, HIV (associated with aplastic
anaemia).
2 Serology for parvovirus infection (if pure red cell aplasia also consider
lymphoma, thymoma).
2 ANA (lupus).
2 NAP score (4 in aplastic anaemia).
2 Check for lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly.
2 CXR (bronchial carcinoma, sarcoid, tuberculosis, lymphoma).
2 USS/CTS to assess lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly (pancytopenia may
be due to hypersplenism and portal hypertension).
2 Hams test for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH ) or cell
marker analysis of CD55 and CD59.
2 BM aspirate and cytogenetics (myelodysplasia is a clonal disorder).

1 Symptoms & signs

Paraesthesiae
This may be described by the patient as an abnormal sensation of aching,
pricking, tickling or tingling commonly in the extremities or face. Often
described as feeling like pins and needles.
The selection of investigations will be determined largely by the history
(transient? chronic?), the surface anatomical site of the abnormal sensation
and associated symptoms or precipitating factors (e.g. clear history of
hyperventilation).
The common causes include the numbness or tingling associated with
pressure on the peripheral nerves such as caused by sleeping awkwardly
on an arm (Saturday night palsy of the radial nerve), or chronic or recurrent pressure, e.g. on the ulnar nerve at the elbow.
If paraesthesiae is persistent, consider the following conditions,
depending on the distribution of the symptoms
2 Carpal tunnel syndrome (with radiation proximally along forearm;
worse at night).
2 Peripheral neuropathy (DM , alcohol, drug-induced,
OHCM section
10).
2 Sciatica (reduced straight leg raising).
2 Meralgia paraesthetica (lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh).
2 Lateral popliteal palsy (common peroneal nerve).
Other less common causes include
Peripheral neuropathy due to
2 DM .
2 Vitamin B1 or B12 deficiencies.
2 Chronic renal failure.
2 Chronic hepatic failure.
2 Malignancy.
2 Neurotoxic drugs:
 Vinca alkaloids.
 Metronidazole.
 Nitrofurantoin.
 Isoniazid (pyridoxine-dependent).
2 Environmental toxins.
2 Hypothyroidism.
2 Guillain-Barr syndrome (acute).
2 Certain porphyrias.
2 Multiple sclerosis.
Acute hypocalcaemia causes a characteristic perioral paraesthesia and can
be due to many causes including 1 and 2 hypoparathyroidism and
alkalosis.

General investigations
2 ABG s (acute or chronic acid-base disturbances leading to alterations in
ionised Ca2+).
2 Serum calcium (not all laboratories measure ionised Ca2+).
2 Serum PTH (uncuffed sample).
2 Serum magnesium (see below).
2 Venous plasma glucose.
2 Vitamin B12 (and other investigations in suspected chronic peripheral
neuropathy).
If serum calcium or magnesium concentration is low, identify cause
2 Chronic GI loss (fistula, excessive diarrhoea, bowel obstruction).
2 Chronic renal loss (diuretic drugs, intrinsic renal disease).
2 Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA ); total body magnesium may be low but
this very rarely causes symptoms.
Additional investigations
2 Urinary [Mg2+].
Consider
2 USS abdomen/renal tract and subsequent GI investigations.
2 U&E .
2 Nerve conduction studies.
2 TFT s.
2 IGF -1, GH response during 75g OGTT (if features of acromegaly

present; p104).

Peripheral neuropathy
The patient will complain of numbness in the hands and feet that progresses proximally in a distribution classically termed glove and stocking.
Different aetiologies lead to a motor, sensory or mixed sensorimotor
picture.
Common causes
2 Idiopathic (50%, most common).
2 Diabetes mellitus.
2 Vitamin B12 deficiency (may occur in absence of anaemia).
2 Vitamin B deficiency (e.g. alcoholics).
2 Vitamin E deficiency.
2 Carcinomatous neuropathy.
2 Drugs, e.g. isoniazid, vinca alkaloids, cisplatin, dapsone, gold, metronidazole.
2 Paraproteinaemias (e.g. MGUS or myeloma).
Rarer causes
2 Amyloidosis.
2 Uraemia.
2 Collagen vascular diseases, e.g. rheumatoid, SLE , PAN .
2 Endocrine disease, e.g. myxoedema, acromegaly.
2 GuillainBarr syndrome.
2 Infections, e.g. tetanus, leprosy, diphtheria, botulism.
2 Sarcoidosis.
2 Hereditary, e.g. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

OHCM pp326, 378.

Petechiae and thrombocytopenia
Spontaneous bleeding in the absence of trauma is uncommon with platelet
counts >20  109/L. However, bleeding is much more likely if the throm- 69
bocytopenia is not immune in origin (e.g. aplastic anaemia, acute
leukaemia, drug-induced, chemotherapy, myelodysplasia).
Thrombocytopenia may be inherited or acquired (e.g. DIC). As for pancytopenia, these may be classified as due to a failure of production, increased
consumption in the peripheries (DIC, ITP) or due to abnormal tissue distribution (splenomegaly).
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) may be 1 or 2 (e.g. lymphoma, lupus, HIV).
Drugs (e.g. heparin) and blood transfusion (post-transfusion purpura) may
cause severe thrombocytopenia.
Investigations
2 FBC , film:
 Inherited causes may be associated with giant platelets.
 Morphological abnormalities may suggest MDS.
 Red cell fragments suggest thrombotic microangiopathies, e.g. TTP.
2 LDH (4 in TTP and lymphoproliferative disorders).
2 Serum vitamin B12, folate (megaloblastic anaemia can be associated
with 5 platelets).
2 ANA , autoimmune screen, immunoglobulins (lupus, hyperthyroidism).
2 Virology (HIV , EBV , viral hepatitis, CMV ).
2 Clotting screen (DIC ).
2 Lupus anticoagulant, cardiolipin antibodies (antiphospholipid antibody
syndromes).
2 Platelet serology for drug- or transfusion-related causes.
2 Bone marrow assessment to establish whether thrombocytopenia is
due to a bone marrow production problem or due to peripheral con-

Page 70

sumption (discuss with haematology team: depending on degree of
thrombocytopenia, other haematological findings and age of patient, a
marrow may not be required).
Pitfalls
Thrombocytopenia due to HIV infection must be considered especially
in all younger adults. Not worth checking platelet-associated IgG or IgM
since these are elevated in thrombocytopenia caused by immune and
non-immune mechanisms, so add no useful information.

Plethora
A plethoric appearance is typically seen in association with polycythaemia
but may also be mistaken for a normal outdoors complexion or cyanosis.
Patients with haematocrits above the normal reference range may or may
not have an increased red cell mass (real or relative polycythaemia respectively).
Investigations
2 FBC , film (repeat FBC as sampling errors can falsely cause elevations of
Hb; PRV may be associated with neutrophilia, basophilia or 4 platelets).
2 Measurement of red cell mass may be necessary to confirm true polycythaemia.
70
 Investigations are then aimed at establishing whether real polycythaemia, if documented, is due to a 1 bone marrow abnormality
(PRV) or a 2 disorder (e.g. respiratory disease).
2 Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score (may be raised in PRV ). Seldom
used now ( NAP score (p216)).
2 Cobalamin and urate (may be raised in PRV ).
2 ESR/CRP (acute phase reactants may suggest secondary causes).
2 Blood gas analysis, oxygen saturation, carboxyhaemoglobin levels (2
polycythaemia due to respiratory disease, smoking).
2 Biochemistry (urea, creatinine; renal disease).
2 Erythropoietin (4 in 2 causes).
2 USS abdomen (renal cysts, liver disease, uterine fibroids and other
malignancies may inappropriately secrete erythropoietin; also check
for splenomegaly in PRV).
2 Sleep studies (obstructive sleep apnoea, supine desaturation).

including disorders of platelets and blood vessels.
Causes
2 Congenital, e.g. OslerWeberRendu syndrome (= hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia), connective tissue (Ehlers-Danlos), osteogenesis
imperfecta, Marfans.
2 Severe infection (septic, meningococcal, measles, typhoid).
2 Allergic, e.g. HenochSchnlein purpura.
2 Drugs, e.g steroids.
2 Miscellaneous, e.g. senile purpura, scurvy, factitious.
2 Thrombocytopeniaany cause (immune, marrow infiltration, deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate, myelofibrosis, DIC, TTP/HUS).
Investigations
2 FBC (looking for platelet abnormalities and presence of leukaemic cells
or other signs of infiltration).
2 Coagulation screen (looking for factor deficiencies, DIC , etc.).
2 Bleeding time using template device (good test of platelet function, but
discuss with haematology registrar first).

Recurrent thrombosis
The pathogenesis (and hence causes) of thrombosis reflect abnormalities
in the dynamics of the circulation, the blood vessel walls or the blood constituents (Virchovs triad). A hypercoagulable or thrombophilic risk factor
is an inherited or acquired disorder of the haemostatic mechanisms, which
may be associated with an increased likelihood of a thrombotic event
(venous or arterial) or recurrent thrombosis. This concept of risk factors
for thrombosis is analogous to that for heart disease, and similarly for
most patients multiple causal factors operate.
Hereditary thrombotic disease may be suggested by a positive family
history but should be tested for if the venous thrombotic events occur in
the absence of acquired causes, at a younger age, at unusual sites
(e.g. mesenteric) or as recurrent thromboses.
Investigations in recurrent thrombosis (including if on warfarin)
Inherited thrombophilia screening
2 Deficiency of factors, e.g. protein C, protein S or antithrombin.
2 Abnormal protein (FVL ).
2 Increased procoagulant (PT , VIII ); others (homocysteinuria).
2 Consider occult malignancy (PSA in 9, pelvic USS in 3).
2 FBC (myeloproliferative disorder, PNH ).
2 Biochemistry (cardiac disease, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome).
2 ESR/CRP (ulcerative colitis).

Waldenstrms).
2 Serum Igs and protein electrophoresis.

Rigors

76

Fever is due to a resetting of the anterior hypothalamic thermostat, is
mediated by prostaglandins (hence aspirin is beneficial), and is most commonly caused by infection. Large variations in temperature may be accompanied by sweats, chills and rigors. An undulant fever may suggest
Hodgkins disease or brucellosis. B symptoms define fever (>38C), night
sweats (drenching), weight loss (>10%) and suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma. (Fever is unusual in CLL in the absence of infection.)
Investigations
2 FBC , film (Hodgkins disease is associated with anaemia, neutrophilia,
eosinophilia, lymphopenia).
2 LDH (4 in lymphoma, non-specific test).
2 Microbiological tests, blood/urine cultures (also consider pyogenic
infection and abscesses in more unusual sites, e.g. renal).
2 Antigen detection tests for specific pathogens.
2 CXR (tuberculosis, lymphoma).
2 ANA (connective tissue disease).
2 BM aspirate/trephine may be necessary as part of leukaemia and lymphoma work-up.
Pitfalls
Not all fever is caused by infection.
OHCM pp58, 550, 554, 556.

Short stature
The assessment of short stature can be a long and difficult process.
Constitutional short stature is the most common cause. Psychosocial
disease must be considered, but extensive investigation is required to rule
out organic disease. If no cause is found, a period of observation may make
the underlying cause apparent. Specialist evaluation should be undertaken
in all cases.

Stridor
Stridor denotes a harsh respiratory added sound during inspiration. It may
be a high-pitched musical sound similar to wheeze but arises from constriction of the larynx or trachea. Stridor may be aggravated by coughing.
Note: Progressive breathlessness accompanied by indrawing of intercostal
spaces and cyanosis indicates severe laryngeal obstruction with risk of
sudden death.
In young children
Because of the smaller size of the larynx and trachea in children, stridor
may occur in a variety of conditions.

2 Acute epiglottitis.
2 Inhaled foreign body, e.g. peanut (commoninhalation further down
the respiratory tract, usually into the right main bronchus, may
produce localised wheeze or distal collapse, p503504).

Suspected bleeding disorder
Bleeding problems present a considerable challenge. Patients may
present with simple easy bruisinga common problemor catastrophic post-traumatic bleeding. The best predictors of bleeding risk
are found in taking an accurate history, focusing on past haemostatic
challenges (e.g. tonsillectomy, teeth extraction, mensesespecially at
time of menarche), and current drug history (e.g. aspirin). The history
may also help delineate the type of defect. Platelet bleeding (e.g. throm82 bocytopenia) starts at the time of the (even minor) haemostatic insult
but if controlled by local pressure tends not to recur. Bleeding due to
coagulation factor deficiency tends to be associated with internal/deep
muscle haematomas as the bleeding typically occurs in a delayed fashion
after initial trauma and then persists.
Inappropriate bleeding or bruising may be due to a local factor or an
underlying systemic haemostatic abnormality.
iAcquired causes of bleeding are much more common than inherited causes.
Causes of bleeding include
2 Surgical.
2 Trauma.
2 Non-accidental injury.
2 Coagulation disorders.
2 Platelet dysfunction.
2 Vascular disorders.
Clinical features
History and presenting complaint. Is this an isolated symptom? What type
of bleeding does the patient havee.g. mucocutaneous, easy bruising,
spontaneous, post-traumatic. Duration and time of onset?recent or
present in childhood. Menstrual and obstetrical history are important.
Systemic enquiry
Do the patients symptoms suggest a systemic disorder, bone marrow
failure, infection, liver disease, renal disease?
Past medical history
Previous episodes of bleeding, recurrent?ITP, congenital disorder.
Exposure to trauma, surgery, dental extraction or pregnancies.

1 Symptoms & signs
Family history
First degree relatives. Pattern of inheritance (e.g. autosomal, sex-linked). If
family history is negative this could be a new mutation (one-third of new
haemophilia is due to new mutations).
Drugs
All drugs cause some side effects in some patients. Bleeding may result
from thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction. Dont forget to ask about
aspirin and warfarin.
Physical examination
Signs of systemic disease
Is there any evidence of septicaemia, anaemia, lymphadenopathy 
hepatosplenomegaly?
Assess bleeding site
Check palate and fundi. Could this be self-inflicted? Check sizepetechiae
(pin head); purpura (larger 1 cm); bruises (ecchymoses; 1 cm).
Joints
Swelling or other signs of chronic arthritis.
Vascular lesions
Purpuraallergic, Henoch-Schnlein, senile, steroid-related, hypergammaglobulinaemic, HHTcapillary dilatations (blanches on pressure), vasculitic lesions, autoimmune disorders, hypersensitivity reactions.
Investigations
2 FBC , film, platelet count, biochemistry screen, ESR , coagulation screen.
2 Special tests, e.g. BM for 1 haematological disorders; radiology, USS .
2 Family studies.

Suspected stroke
A stroke denotes an acute neurological deficit. Strokes may vary in presentation, from a rapidly resolving neurological deficit to a severe permanent or progressive neurological defect (e.g. multi-infarct disease).
Neurological deficits persisting >24h are referred to as a completed stroke
cf. transient ischaemic attack (TIA). With a suspected stroke, a full history
and general physical examination are mandatory. Risk factors for cerebrovascular disease should be sought, including a history of hypertension
(commonmajor risk factor), DM (commonmajor risk factor) and dyslipidaemia. Ask about recent falls or trauma. Hemiparesis can occur as a
post-ictal phenomenon or a result of migraine or hypoglycaemia (see
below). Hysterical or functional paralysis is also seen but should not be
confidently assumed at presentation. Neuroanatomical localisation of the
deficit and the nature of the lesion(s) requires appropriate imaging.
Clinical hunches may sometimes be misleading.

Page 84

Note: The post-ictal state may be associated with temporary (<24h) limb
paresis (Todds paralysis) in focal epilepsy (suggests structural lesion
cranial imaging is mandatory)
General investigations
2 FBC (polycythaemia, anaemia).
2 U&E .
2 ESR .
2 Protein electrophoresis (if hyperviscosity syndrome suspected, e.g.
44 ESR).
2 ECG (atrial fibrillation, IHD statins reduce risk of stroke in patients
with previous MI).
2 CXR (cerebral metastases from bronchogenic carcinoma?).
Specific risk factors
2 Venous plasma glucose. Note: Severe hypoglycaemia, e.g. insulininduced or 2 to sulphonylureas, may mimic acute stroke. Always
check capillary fingerprick glucose concentration to exclude this possibilityeven if there is no history of DM. Take venous sample in fluoride-oxalate tube (+ serum for insulin concentration) if hypoglycaemia
confirmed. (See p144 for further details of investigation and treatment.) Hyperosmolar non-ketotic diabetic coma may also be misdiagnosed as stroke (plasma glucose usually >50mmol/L with pre-renal
uraemia.
84 2 Thrombophilia screen (if indicated by clinical or haematological features).
2 Lipid profile (not an immediate investigation; secondary prevention, see
above).
2 Blood cultures (if SBE or other sepsis suspected. Note: cerebral
abscess).
Imaging
2 Cranial CT scan ( IV contrast).
2 Echocardiogram (if mural thrombus, endocarditis suspected).
2 Carotid doppler studiesmay not be indicated if surgical intervention
(endarterectomy) is unlikely because of poor prognosis, e.g. dense
hemiplegia or coma.
Consider alternative diagnoses including
2 Primary or secondary brain tumour (may present as acute stroke;
search for primary).
2 Cerebral abscess (usually clear evidence of sepsis).
2 Cerebral lupus (ESR , autoantibodies).
OHCM pp346, 348, 526.

Sweating

Tachycardia
Patients with tachycardia (heart rate >100 beats/min) may be asymptomatic. Tachyarrhythmias may, however, present with palpitations, chest
pain, breathlessness or collapse. When investigating the causes of tachycardia, others causes should be sought apart from cardiac disease.
Anxiety, certain drugs and infection may cause tachycardia. Ventricular
tachycardias are usually more serious than supraventricular tachycardias.
However, cardiac decompensation may occur with either if there is
already a compromised myocardium, e.g. due to ischaemic myopathy, or
structural lesions, e.g. severe aortic valve disease.
Causes of tachycardia
2 Physiologicalexercise, pregnancy.
2 Drug-induced-adrenergic agonists, amphetamines.

Tinnitus
Tinnitus is a common symptom in which the patient perceives a sound,
often chronic and distressing, in the absence of aural stimulation. It usually
manifests as a ringing or buzzing in the ears. Tinnitus may occur as a
symptom of nearly all disorders of the auditory apparatus. Psychological
stresses may be relevant in some cases.
Causes include
2 Acoustic trauma (prolonged exposure to loud noise, e.g. gun shots,
amplified music).
2 Barotrauma (blast injury, perforated tympanic membrane).
2 Obstruction of the external auditory meatus (wax, foreign body, infection).
2 Otosclerosis.
2 Menires disease.
2 Drug-induced ototoxicity.
2 Gentamicinmay be irreversible.
2 Acute salicylate toxicity.

2 Cranial MRI (following specialist advice).
OHCM p338.

Unstable angina
Unstable angina is characterised by a sudden change in the pattern of
exertional angina. Angina may be experienced with minimal physical
activity. Rest pain or pain awakening the patient from sleep (decubitus
angina) or prolonged or recurrent pain at rest may be a warning of
impending myocardial infarction (MI).
Features supporting the diagnosis
2 Known coronary heart disease (CHD ).
2 History of premature CHD in a 1 relative.
2 Presence of risk factors for coronary heart disease.
2 Smoking.
2 Hypertension.
88 2 DM.
2 Hyperlipidaemia.
2 Premature menopause.
If the 12-lead ECG does not show typical features of ischaemia,
consider other causes of chest pain
2 Pulmonary embolism.
2 Aortic dissection.
2 Pneumothorax.
2 Oesophageal spasm.
2 Acute pericarditis.
2 Pleurisy.
2 Costochondritis.
Note: A normal 12-lead ECG does not exclude the presence of severe
CHD. The patients history should not be dismissed. Minor degrees of
myocardial damage can be detected by specific serum protein markers
(troponins, p306). If raised, this places the patient in a higher-risk category.
General investigations
2 12-lead ECG look for ST segment depression or T wave inversion.
2 Serum markers of myocardial damage:
 CK may be elevated >6h after the onset of myocardial damage.
 Troponin I (or T) is elevated 8h after onset of myocardial damage.
Particularly helpful if ECG is normal and CK is not elevated but
strong suspicion of acute coronary event.
2 FBC .
2 Venous plasma glucose.
2 Serum lipid profile.

Wheeze
Wheezes (rhonchi) are continuous high-, medium- or low-pitched added
sounds audible during respiration. Typically they are loudest on expiration
in asthma and may on occasion be heard without a stethoscope. The
implication is reversible or irreversible airway obstruction. If wheeze is
audible only during inspiration this is termed stridor, implying upper respiratory obstruction. An important distinction must be made between
monophonic and polyphonic wheezes and whether wheeze is localised to
a single area or is heard throughout the thorax.
Polyphonic wheeze
Wheezes with multiple tones and pitch. The commonest causes of
wheeze (usually recurrent) are:
2 Asthma.
2 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ; often audible during
both phases of respiration).
Fixed monophonic wheeze
A wheeze with a single constant pitch. Implies local bronchial obstruction,
usually due to:
2 Bronchogenic carcinoma
2 Foreign body.
Note: Stridor is a harsh form of monophonic wheeze arising from upper
airway obstruction ( Stridor (p81)).

Guiding principles of
endocrine investigation
Investigations for endocrine disease have caused a lot of confusion in the
minds of clinicians (many still do!). Tests have come and gone over the
years and have been adopted with varying degrees of enthusiasm by specialist centres. In particular, there is often confusion over which tests to
do, what procedures to follow and how to interpret the results. In some
areas (e.g. Cushings syndrome), controversy persists among the experts.
In others, a clear consensus approach exists.
Here are some useful general principles:
1. Use dynamic testsrather than random (untimed) sampling where
the hormone under investigation is secreted in infrequent pulses (e.g.
growth hormone, GH) or levels are easily influenced by other factors
(e.g. cortisol varies markedly with stress levels and has a marked circadian rhythm)see table (pxx).
In general
If you are suspecting a LOW leveldo a STIMULATION test (to see
if it stays LOW)
If you are suspecting a HIGH leveldo a SUPPRESSION test (to see
if it stays HIGH)

100 2. Use the correct collection methode.g.

ACTH OR insulin levels
require rapid separation of the sample and prompt freezing (20C);
urinary catecholamines require a specific acid preservative in the collection container. Timing of sampling may also be critical. Label
samples carefully, including time of collection! Check procedures with
the local laboratory. Many units will have protocols for endocrine
investigations.
3. Do tests in the right sequencee.g. ACTH levels can only be interpreted once the cortisol status is known. In many cases simultaneous
samples are required for interpretation, e.g. PTH with calcium for
hypo/hyperpathyroidism, glucose with insulin for insulinoma.
4. Normal results may be abnormal depending on the activity of the
hormone axis under investigation. Interpretation of the absolute levels
of hormones in isolation may be highly misleading. For example, a
serum PTH within the normal range in the presence of hypocalcaemia
suggests hypoparathyroidism; normal LH AND FSH levels in the presence of a very low serum testosterone concentration suggest pituitary
failure. In both instances, the regulatory hormone concentration is
inappropriately low. Thus, the level of the regulatory hormone (or
releasing factor) must be considered in the light of the simultaneous
level of the target hormone or metabolite.
5. Results may vary according to the lab assaye.g. different prolactin
assays cross-react very differently with macroprolactin (
Galactorrhoea (p132)). Reference ranges also vary between labsinterpret your tests according to your local labs normal range. Some individuals have a heterophile interfering antibody that affects the results

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
of many radioimmunoassays. Resist discarding clinical evidence in
favour of a numerical value.
6. Beware of interfering medicatione.g. inhaled beclomethasone can
suppress serum cortisol levels, administered hydrocortisone (cortisol)
is detected by the cortisol assay, synthetic androgens and oestrogens
can appear to cause low serum testosterone/oestrogen (not detected
in the testostrone/oestrogen assay); some anti-emetics and antipsychotics can raise circulating prolactin levels; carbenoxolone or
liquorice may cause hypokalaemia. Always ask patient for a full medication list (including herbal remedies and other self-medication).
7. Take a family historyfamilial forms of many common endocrine
problems exist which require important changes in management
approach, e.g. familial hypercalcaemia may suggest MEN-1 or MEN-2
requiring a different form of parathyroid surgery and a risk of phaeochomocytoma (MEN-2).
Endocrine tests are generally expensive and should not be performed
unnecessarily or outside of standard protocols. Dynamic tests may have
cautions and contraindications and can be hazardous if used inappropriately. A high degree of organisation and close liaison with the lab is
required to perform these tests in a way that can be clearly interpreted.
Dynamic tests should ideally be performed in an endocrine investigation
unit. Chemical pathologists (clinical biochemists) and other lab staff generally have great experience with performing and interpreting endocrine
testsseek their advice wherever possiblebefore embarking on tests

2 Post-cranial irradiation.
2 Following pituitary irradiation.
2 Metastases to pituitary (especially breast).
2 Post-surgery.
2 Empty sella syndrome (occasionally).
2 Sheehans syndrome (infarction with post-partum haemorrhage).
Symptoms & signs
Often very vague, e.g. tiredness, normocytic anaemia (easily missed).
Combined with impotence or ammonorrhoeavery suggestive. Other
clues, loss of body hair (especially axilliary), reduced shaving, hyponatraemia, growth failure in children. Diabetes insipidus is not a feature as
ADH can be secreted directly from the hypothalamus. Also signs of
space-occupying lesion: bitemporal hemianopia (rarely optic nerve compression, homonymous hemianopia), headache (esp. following apoplexy),
III, IV, V1, V2 or VI cranial nerve lesions, CSF rhinorrhoea. Occasionally
galactorrheoa following pituitary stalk compression by tumour (disconnection).
Note: Generally GH is lost first, then LH/FSH, and ACTH/TSH last. With
any degree of hypopituirism, GH secretion is usually affected.
Investigations
See flow chart. Note that the short synacthen test ( Protocols (p162)) is
only suitable for testing the hypothalmo-pituitary adrenal axis if pituitary
failure is of long standing (>6 weeks) allowing time for adrenal atrophy to
occur.

103

Alternative investigations
GH stimulation tests including GHRH administration, GHRH + synthetic
GH-releasing peptides, IV arginine test, IV glucagon test (causes nausea),
oral L-dopa test (also causes nausea) and IV/oral clonidine test in children.
However, the reliability of these tests has not been confirmed and the ITT
( Protocols (p155)) remains the gold standard. Combined anterior pituitary testinggiving LHRH, TRH, ACTH and GHRH ( Protocols (p158))
no clear advantage of this approach has been demonstrated and the
results of the LHRH test in particular are difficult to intepret in prepubertal children. Long (depot) synacthen testrarely required (

Investigations
A random growth hormone is not helpfulmay be high in normal
people.
2 Perform a standard 75g oral GTT with glucose and growth hormone
measurements at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120min.
2 If no growth hormone values are <2mU/L then the diagnosis of
acromegaly is confirmed.
2 A random insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1 ) level should be measured and compared to laboratory normal ranges corrected for age.
This can be used as a screening test but IGF-1 assays vary in reliability.
IGF-1 levels should be raised in all cases of acromegaly but levels can
be affected (reduced) by fasting and systemic illness.
2 The vast majority (99%) of cases of acromegaly are due to pituitary
tumours. If a pituitary tumour is not seen on MRI scanning yet
acromegaly is confirmed, a GHRH level should be requested to
exclude ectopic production of this polypeptide by non-pituitary
tumours stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary.
2 For follow-up of treated cases of acromegaly, IGF-1 levels (more
sensitive) and nadir of growth hormone in a series of 4 estimations
over 2h is a reasonable approach.
2 Life expectancy appears to return to normality when the nadir of GH
values is <5mU/L.

Polydipsia & polyuria:
diabetes insipidus
First line tests
It is relatively common for patients to report excess thirst or increase
need to pass urine. The flow chart and table summarise the causes.
Prostatism and urge incontinence resulting in urinary frequency should be

105

distinguished by history taking as the patients do not have thirst. Then
the first step is to identify straightforward causes such as drugs
(diuretics), diabetes mellitus, hypercalcaemia, hypokalaemia and chronic
renal failure. A glucose tolerance test should not be required to diagnose diabetes mellitus as the renal threshold for glucose needs to be
exceeded (~10mmol/L) to cause polyuria and there should be glucose in
the urine.

Causes of polyuria/polydipsia

Diabetes mellitus

Diabetes insipidus (cranial or nephrogenic)

2

High Ca2+

2

Low K+

Chronic renal failure

Primary polydipsia (including dry mouth, e.g. Sjgrens)

Second line tests
Subsequent tests aim to distinguish diabetes insipidus from primary polydypsia (compulsive water drinking). A carefully supervised water derpivation test should be performed ( Protocols (p159)). However, it is not
always easy to arrive at a conclusive diagnosis. Serum sodium levels are
helpful as diabetes insipidus is unlikely if Na+ <140mmol/L. Morning spot
urine osmolality after overnight water restriction (not shown on chart) is
occasionally useful: values >600mOsmol/L make significant degrees of dia106 betes insipidus unlikely. Measuring 24h urine volume is also useful as
volumes over 3L are likely to be pathological. However, obligate urine
volumes as low as 2L could still cause the patient to complain of polyuria.
In such borderline cases, the distinction between partial diabetes insipidus,
normality and primary polydipsia can be very difficult. Guidance on interpretation of the second line tests including the water deprivation test is
given in the table. Note that primary polydipisa may be a psychiatric condition but can also occur in patients with a dry mouth (e.g. Sjgrens syndrome, anticholinergic drugs) or who have been previously encouraged to
drink regularly to help their kidneys.
Distinction between partial cranial diabetes insipidus and habitual (psychogenic) water drinking is complicated by the fact that drinking very high
volumes over time may wash out the renal medullary concentrating gradient. In this situation a plasma vasopressin level at the end of the water
deprivation test may be very helpful to distinguish lack of vasopressin from
a lack of vasopressin action. 24h urine volume is also helpful as volumes of
less than 3L/day are unlikely to cause renal wash-out. Clues to primary
polydipsia include an initial plasma osmolality (and serum Na+) that is low,
plasma osmolality rises to >295mOsmol/L and thirst is not abolished by
DDAVP despite a rise in urine osmolality. Note that full blown cranial
diabetes insipidus results in urine volumes around 500mL/h (12L/day).

**Osmolalities are all expressed in mmol/L.

If all else fails
In cases of doubt, a carefully supervised therapeutic trial of DDAVP
(desmopressin) can be useful to distinguish diabetes insipidus from
primary polydypsia ( Protocols (p160)). This should be done as an inpatient as there is a risk of significant hyponatraemia in habitual water
drinkers. The principle is that patients able to regulate water intake
according to their thirst (diabetes insipidus) should not develop a hypoosmolar plasma. In primary polydypsia, the urine volume will fall and the
urine concentrating gradient will gradually recover. However, if the
patient continues to drink due to their psychological drive rather than
their thirst, they will become water overloaded and hypo-osmolar.
An additional valuable test to distinguish partial diabetes insipidus from
primary polydypisa is hypertonic saline infusion testing, which usually
requires access to a plasma vasopressin assay but has been used with
urinary vasopressin levels (see references). MRI scanning typically shows

diabetes insipidus. However, this sign is not helpful in distinguishing
more subtle degree of diabetes insipidus from other causes.

Hyponatraemia (including SIADH)
Hyponatraemia is a very common clinical problem. Figure 2.3 shows a
flow chart for investigation. If patients are on diuretics, further evaluation
is usually not possible. The diuretic will need to be discontinued. If this is
not possible, the hyponatraemia is likely to be attributable to an underlying condition (cardiac, renal or liver failure). Pseudo- or dilutional
hyponatraemia is important to exclude at an early stage (see table below).
A careful clinical assessment should be made of volume status including
identification of oedema, fluid loss (e.g. diarrhoea, fistula leakage) and signs
of dehydration including postural drop in blood pressure. A urine sodium

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
and TSH estimation is useful at this stage (see Fig. 2.3). Note that the most
important diagnosis not to miss is hypoadrenalism as this can be fatal if
untreated. Clinicians should have a low threshold for performing a short
synacthen test (see Protocols (p162)). Hypoadrenalism due to pituitary
failure may not be accompanied by hyperkalaemia, hypotension or hyperpigmentation and can easily be missed.

The diagnosis can be made if hyponatraemia persists in patients not on
diuretics, without oedema who have normal renal, adrenal and thyroid
function. Volume status should be normal and urine Na+ is normally
>20mmol/L. A specific cause is frequently not found or there may be a
combination of precipitating factors (see table below). In the elderly, a state
of chronic SIADH is relatively common and usually explains hyponatraemia persisting for many years without any other apparent cause.
Affected individuals should be encouraged to drink less than a litre a day
(5 cups or less), to only drink if they are thirsty and avoid exacerbating
factors (see table).

Hypothyroidism

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
The following features of SIADH/hyponatraemia are often
underappreciated
1. Other than a chest x-ray, there is no requirement to search for an
underlying malignant cause. If there is underlying malignancy it is usually
extensive, very apparent and incurable (e.g. extensive small-cell carcinoma of the lung).
2. The urine osmolality does not have to be high. In individuals drinking
large volumes of fluid, a urine osmolality as low as 250mOsmol/L (i.e.
less than plasma) may be inappropriately concentrated reflecting true
SIADH.
3. Conditions previously diagnosed as sick cell syndrome are now
thought to represent SIADH in ill patients.
4. Water intoxication is usually the combination of SIADH and excessive
fluid intake. Healthy patients drinking to excess can rarely exceed the
renal capacity to excrete a water load (~12L/day) and hence do not
become hyponatraemic. A degree of SIADH is required for potomaniacs (excess water drinkers) to become hyponatraemic.
5. The post-operative state contains many precipitants to SIADH
(nausea, pain, opiates, pneumonia) and ADH secretion is promoted by
hypovolaemia from blood loss. The administration of 3L of intravenous fluid a day post-operatively therefore frequently results in
hyponatraemia.
6. Symptoms of hyponatraemia such as drowsiness, coma or fits are
dependent on the rate of fall of serum Na+ not the absolute value.
Patients who are alert with Na+ <125mmol/L have clearly been chronically hyponatraemic and their serum sodium requires only gentle correction. However, a very rapid fall in serum Na+ to <130mmol/L 111
(typically due to massive infusion of hypotonic fluid into the bladder)
may cause coma and needs to be corrected as a medical emergency
with hypertonic saline.

Obesity/hypercortisolism
Endocrinologists are frequently asked to determine whether there is an
underlying cause in patients who are obese. Secondary causes of obesity
are listed in the table. A long history of obesity typically going back to
childhood is characteristic of constitutional obesity and further investigation other than thyroid function is rarely necessary. However, obesity may
result in effects suggestive of hypercortisolism, e.g. striae, central obesity,
rounded facial features, mild hyperandrogenism in women, buffalo hump,
hypertension and hyperglycaemia. Rapidly progressive obesity, marked
hypertension, hypokalaemia, proximal muscle weakness, poor sleep,
osteoporosis/vertebral collapse and marked hirsutism or acne are more
suggestive of hypercortisolism and require further investigation.
Hypothalamic damage is usually apparent from the history.

Drugs, e.g. antidepressants

The optimal approach to the diagnosis of hypercortisolism (Cushings syndrome) is probably the most controversial subject in endocrinology.
Endocrinologists who have seen many cases of Cushings syndrome have
seen exceptions to every rule, and the episodic nature of ACTH and cortisol secretion means that low values can occur even in disease. True
cyclical Cushings disease also occurs but is rare.
Diagnosis consists of two phases
1. Does the patient have hypercortisolism or not?
2. What is the cause of the hypercortisolism? Phase 1 must be completed
first as phase 2 tests can only be interpreted if hypercortisolism is
present.
Investigation of hypercortisolism phase 1
Does the patient have hypercortisolism?
Patients being investigated for hypercortisolism should look Cushingoid.
Depression and alcoholism may cause abnormal tests for hypercortisolism
representing a true hypercortisolaemic state and hence are
112 without
termed pseudo-Cushings syndrome. Such depressed patients often do
not appear cushingoid and alcoholism should be identifiable clinically and
biochemically. If there is a high degree of suspicion of hypercortisolism in
a depressed patient, midnight cortisol levels <140nmol/L or a negative
result on dexamethasone-CRH testing ( Protocols (p161)) may be helpful
in excluding the diagnosis. Note that iatrogenic or factitious Cushings syndrome is usually due to a steroid other than hydrocortisone and characteristically results in a suppressed hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.
Four tests are used to determine whether a patients does have
hypercortisolism
1. 24h urinary free cortisol collections (UFC). Three collections with
simultaneous creatinine excretion estimation are ideal. If the creatinine
excretion varies >10% between collections, the samples are not true
24h collections and should be repeated. If two or more collections
have a value >3 times the laboratory upper limit of normal (e.g.
>800nmol/24h), then the diagnosis of hypercortisolism is secure.
Patients with intermediate values should have repeat sampling after
several weeks or additional tests. Steroids, adrenal enzyme inhibitors,
statins and carbamazepine must be discontinued prior to testing. False
positives can be caused by pregnancy, anorexia, exercise, psychoses,
alcohol and alcohol withdrawal.
2. Low dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDST). This can be preformed overnight or over 2 days ( Protocols (p161)), the latter having
less false-positives. Some authorities believe it adds little to UFCs as

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
when cortisol secretion is high, the UFC is clearly raised, but in times
when it is intermediate, the LDST may be normal. It is a useful outpatient screening test ( Overnight protocol (p161)) in individuals who
cannot reliably collect 24h urine samples.
3. Midnight cortisol levels. High serum cortisol levels (>200nmol/L) measured between 2300 and 0100h indicate loss of diurnal rhythm and
although inconvenient, are one of the best tests of hypercortisolism.
Samples should be taken via an indwelling cannula in as relaxed state as
possibly, preferrably during sleep. Values <140nmol/L make hypercortisolism very unlikely. Late evening salivary cortisol levels in an oupatient setting can be used where the assay is available.
4. Dexamethasone-suppressed CRH test ( Protocols (p161)). This is a
modification of the LDST which has been said to have a specificity of
100% for hypercortisolism. Experience suggests that exceptions still
occur.
Summary
In patients who appear Cushingoid, 3 x UFCs should be performed (note
causes of false +ves). If these give equivocal results additional tests are
required including further UFCs, midnight cortisols and a formal 2-day
LDST followed by CRH.
Investigation of hypercortisolism phase 2: what is the cause of
the hypercortisolism?
The common and rare causes of hypercortisolism are summarised in the
tables below, along with useful clinical features. Approximately 65% of
cases are due to a pituitary adenoma (Cushings disease), 20% are due to 113
an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma and 10% to ectopic ACTH production.

These are the 3 main causes to be distinguished using a combination of the
tests shown below. Distinction between a pituitary adenoma (which may
not be visualisable on MRI) and a small indolent tumour (typically lung car114 cinoid) represents the greatest challenge. Despite extensive investigation,
the cause will remain uncertain in some of these cases.
Investigations
1. Plasma ACTH level (separate and freeze immediately). Undetectable
plasma ACTH levels are strongly suggestive of an adrenal tumour.
However, ACTH secretion is intermittent and two suppressed values
with simultaneous high cortisol levels (>400nmol/L) are preferrable
and should prompt adrenal CT scanning.
2. High dose dexamethasone suppression test ( Protocols (p162)).
Greater than 90% suppression of basal urine free cortisol levels is
strongly suggestive of a pituitary adenoma. Lesser degrees of suppression are seen with ectopic ACTH.
3. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS). This is an excellent diagnostic
tool but requires expert radiological support and should only be performed in tertiary referral centres. 100mg IV of CRH is also given via a
peripheral vein while sampling to ensure active secretion of ACTH
during the test. ACTH levels are compared between the inferior petrosal sinus on both sides, and a peripheral vein. Sampling is performed
at 15, 0, +15 and +30 min after CRH injection. Ratios >2 (ideally >3)
post-CRH are strongly suggestive of pituitary-dependent disease. Risks
include failure to enter the sinus, and sinus thrombosis.
4. Imaging. Pituitary and adrenal imaging should not be performed
without biochemical testing as non-functioning tumours of the pituitary
and adrenal are common (false +ves) and conversely functioning pituitary tumours are often be too small to be visualised by MRI (false ve).
However, if the findings are consistent with the biochemical tests this is
useful supportive evidence. Patients with findings suggestive of ectopic

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
ACTH production should have thin-slice CTs of the chest looking for a
bronchial adenoma and MRI scanning of the pancreas for an islet

tumour. 111Indium-labelled octreotide scanning may also be useful in
locating small tumours.
5. Plasma CRH levels. Very rarely ectopic ACTH syndrome is actually
due to ectopic CRH production stimulating ACTH from the pituitary
(see table). Raised plasma CRH levels may be diagnostic in this condition.
Additional tests include
2 Metryapone test. Here the adrenal enzyme blocker metyrapone is used
to lower cortisol levels. Pituitary adenomas respond by increasing
ACTH production but ectopic sources of ACTH do not. The test can
also be used to confirm that ACTH levels are truly suppressed in
adrenal tumours (rarely nececssary).
2 Peripheral CRH test. ACTH levels are measured before (30, 15min)
and +15 and +30min after injection of 100mg IV of CRH into a peripheral vein. A rise in ACTH levels of >34% is suggestive of a pituitary
adenoma. The addition of 5mg IV of desmopression improves the
response rate and reduces false negatives.

95% of cases of hypertension are essential hypertension with no specific
underlying cause. If hypertension is very marked, occurring in younger
patients, difficult to control with drugs, episodic/fluctuating, recent-onset,
familial, associated with recurrent hypokalaemia or has associated features
(see table) then an underlying cause should be excluded.

Figure 2.5 provides a flow chart for further investigation. At least 3 separate blood pressure readings should be obtained24h BP monitoring may
be useful where white coat hypertension is suspected.
The majority of secondary causes of hypertension can be rapidly excluded
by the investigations shown in the first box Fig. 2.5. If the results are
normal or the only abnormality is a low potassium, then the possibilities of
hyperaldosteronism or renal artery stenosis remain to be distinguished
from essential hypertension. Further investigation should be driven by the
severity of the hypertension, the (young) age of the patient and the difficulty in obtaining control with drugs.
Investigation of renal artery stenosis/high renin levels
Selective renal angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing renal
artery stenosisother imaging methods can miss the diagnosis. Renal
duplex scanning in experienced hands is a useful non-invasive test. Isotope
renography ( captopril) and digital subtraction angiography can generate
false negatives. 3D MR angiography is a promising non-invasive alternative.
High renin levels associated with hypertension (off drugs) in the absence
of renal artery stenosis should prompt a search for juxtaglomerular cell
tumour of one kidney. Note that the presence of hypertension is essential,
as many conditions associated with low or normal blood pressure can
result in appropriate hyper-reninaemia (e.g. diuretics, cardiac, renal or

liver failure, hypocortisolism, hypovolaemia). High renin levels can also
occur in essential hypertension.
Investigation of hyperaldosteronism
Hypertension with persistent hypokalaemia, raises the possibility of hyperaldosteronism which may be due to a variety of causes (see table below).
Note that investigation for hyperaldosteronism is also appropriate with K+

levels in the normal range, if other investigations are negative and hypertension is marked, difficult to control or in a younger patient. The optimal
approach to investigation remains controversial and equivocal cases frequently occur. If there is marked hypokalaemia of recent onset, a 24h
urinary free cortisol (and review of medication) is indicated to exclude
recent-onset hypercortisolism (usually due to ectopic ACTH production)
in which Cushingoid features have not yet become apparent. True hyperaldosteronism is never due to a malignant lesion, so that if hypertension
can be medically controlled, it is not always necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis of aetiology. Published guidelines for investigation are often
ambiguous. A detailed practical scheme is therefore provided here (Fig.
2.6).
Establishing hyperaldosteronism
The initial investigation is an upright renin/aldosterone ratio, performed
when the patient has been upright or sitting (not lying) for at least 2h. The
sample needs to be taken to the laboratory and frozen immediately.
Ideally, the patient should be on no anithypertensives other than blockers (e.g. doxazosin) as most drugs can affect interpretation of the
test results (see table, p121). This is difficult to achieve in subjects with
very marked hypertension. Combination antihypertensive therapy and
spironolactone cause most confusion. An undetectable renin with an
unequivocally high aldosterone level makes the diagnosis very likely. A
normal or raised upright renin excludes hyperaldosteronism. Borderline
results should be repeated off interfering medication and after potassium

low renin with a normal aldosterone can be seen in essential (low renin)
hypertension. Refer to the laboratory for normal and diagnostic ranges.
Additional tests (e.g. renin after sodium restruction/frusemide, aldosterone after captopril, sodium loading or IV saline) are used in specialist
centres but their exact role in testing remains unresolved.

Investigating the cause of established primary hyperaldosteronism
There are 5 causes of established primary hyperaldosteronism with suppressed renin and high aldosterone (see table, above). Surgery (unilateral
adrenalectomy) is indicated for adenoma (65% of cases), the unusual
renin-responsive adenoma and the rare cases of unilatral hyperplasia but
not for bilateral hyperplasia (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, 30% of
cases) or the rare, familial glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism

Fig. 2.7 Identifying the cause of established primary hyperaldosteronism.

If hyperaldosteronism is established and a nodule is visible on CT/MRI
imaging, it is reasonable to proceed to unilateral adrenalectomy/excision
of the nodule. If no nodule or bilateral nodules are seen, then adrenal vein
sampling is the most useful test to determine whether surgery should be
performed. Aldosterone levels after glucocorticoid administration or
genetic testing for the chimeric CYP11B1/CYP11B2 gene should be performed beforehand to exclude GRA (see table, pxxfamily members may
be only mildly hypertensive, making family histories unreliable).
Unfortunately, the right adrenal vein cannot be catheterised in up to 25%
of cases and there is a risk of precipitating adrenal haemorrhage.
Postural studies identifying a >50% rise in aldosterone comparing recumbent and 24h of standing/walking suggest idiopathic hyperplasia, but a
small renin-responsive adenoma not visible on CT could give similar
results.

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
Investigating the cause of apparent mineralocorticoid excess
Rarely, investigation reveals low renin and low aldosterone levels in the
presence of hypertension, hypokalaemia and alkalosis. There are 5 causes
of this (see table, p121). A 24h urinary free cortisol estimation will rapidly
exclude recent-onset, aggressive hypercortisolism. Repeated enquiry
should be made for drug and liquorice product ingestion. The remaining
causes may be diagnosed by urinary cortisol/cortisone ratio (11 OH
steroid dehydrogenase deficiencyoften referred to alone as apparent
mineralocorticoid excess) or other appropriate changes in urinary and
plasma cortisol metabolites (e.g. raised DOC levels11 hydroxylase or
17 hydroxylase deficiency) or responsiveness to amiloride (Liddles syndrome).
Phaeochromocytoma
Phaeochromocytoma is rare but an important diagnosis not to misscan
result in fatal hypertensive crisis especially during surgery or after inadvertent  adrenoreceptor blockade without  blockade. It can be sporadic
(90%) or be the first clue to a familial syndrome (see table, p121).
Approximately 10% of cases are extra-adrenal, 10% multiple and 10%
malignant. 90% of cases have sustained or paroxysmal hypertension but
paroxysmal attacks of some nature are a feature of only 55% of cases.
Pure adrenaline-secreting lesions can occasionally cause hypotension.
They are always intra-adrenal. Phaeochromocytoma needs to be excluded
in cases of incidentally found adrenal masses.
24h urinary catecholamine estimations (collect into an acidified container)
have now replaced measures of catecholamine metabolites (VMAS,
metanephrines) as they are more sensitive and specific. A single clearly
positive estimation in the presence of hypertension is usually sufficient. If
non-diagnostic, sampling initiated immediately after an attack should
provide the answer. Mild 4 can be seen in anxiety states, and with very
small lesions detected in the follow-up of familial, recurrent disease.
Causes of false positive results include methyldopa, levodopa, labetalol,
clonidine withdrawal, intracranial events (e.g. subarachnoid haemorrhage,
posterior fossa tumour) or metabolic stress (e.g. hypoglycaemia, myocardial infarction). Measurement of plasma catecholamines and stimulation
tests are now largely obsolete.
Once the diagnosis is established,  blockade (typically with increasing bd
doses of phenoxybenzamine) should be established before invasive investigation. The tumours are usually large (>2cm) and bright on T2-weighted
images. CT/MRI scanning therefore identifies virtually all adrenal lesions.
Radionuclide scanning with 131I MIBG is useful to confirm activity if more
than one adrenal nodule is present and to identify extra-adrenal lesions
where no adrenal lesion is seen. Note that extra-adrenal phaeochromocyThakker RB, Oparil S. (2001) Primary aldosteronism: a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment.

Hypokalaemia
Persistent hypokalaemia (<2.5mmol/L) can cause muscle weakness,
cramps, tetany, polyuria, exacerbate digoxin toxicity and predispose to
cardiac arrhythmias. The majority of cases are due to the common causes
(see table below) and are relatively easy to diagnose. However, puzzling
cases where none of these features are present occur and prompt further
investigation. A flow chart is shown below Fig. 2.8.

Note the importance of identifying the presence of acidosis and hypertension. Occult diuretic and purgative use should always be borne in mind.
The commonest cause of persistent hypokalaemia with no other cause
presenting in adulthood is Gitelmans syndrome, an asymptomatic congential disorder which can usually be separated from the rare, more severe
Bartters syndrome (which usually presents neonatally or in early childhood), by low serum Mg2+ levels.

Artefactual and common causes need to be excluded of which renal
failure is the most important (see table below). If these fail to reveal a
cause, then hypoadrenalism (which can be life-threatening), isolated mineralocorticoid deficiency and type IV renal tubular acidosis need to be

Hypoadrenalism is suggested by concomitant hyponatraemia, hypotension

synacthen testing ( Adrenal failure (p127)). Note that hyperkalaemia is
not a feature of secondary (pituitary) hypoadrenalism since aldosterone
production is maintained by the renin-angiotensin system. Type IV renal

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
tubular acidosis is common in patients with diabetes. It is associated with a
renal tubular dysfunction as well as mildly impaired glomerular function.
Serum creatinine is usually at or above the upper limit of normal. It is a
state of hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism. Renin/aldosterone testing is
suggestive but there is no definitive test. Isolated mineralocorticoid deficiency is usually congenital (e.g. due to aldosterone synthase deficiency),
but can be acquired (e.g. HIV disease) and aldosterone resistance (pseudohypoaldosteronism with high aldosterone levels but biochemical mineralocorticoid deficiency) has been described. High renin and low
aldosterone levels would be expected.
OHCM pp262, 694

Adrenal failure
Hypoadrenalism is often insiduous in clinical onset. However, it is an
important diagnosis to make as it can be life-threatening especially at times
of stress. The key is to have a high index of suspicion. Primary adrenal
failure is suggested by hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypotension
(including postural), malaise, weight loss, nausea, abdominal pain and skin
pigmentation. In pituitary (secondary) adrenal failure, hyperkalaemia,
hypotension and pigmentation are absent and malaise may be the only
feature. Signs/symptoms of gonadal failure (e.g. loss of libido, reduced 127
shaving or amenorrhoea) are often associated features with pituitary
failure. Basal cortisol levels can be misleading as they may be high in the
morning and low in the evening. Nonetheless, a random cortisol level
>550nmol/L excludes the diagnosis and is a useful test in patients undergoing severe stress/illness (e.g. in ITU).
iWhere there is a strong suspicion of adrenal failure, treatment must not
be delayed pending investigation. A short synacthen test or random cortisol should be performed immediately and treatment commenced with
steroids awaiting results. Alternatively, treatment with dexamethasone,
0.5mg daily (which does not cross-react in the cortisol assay) can be used
and then discontinued for the day of testing. Patients on other forms of
glucocorticoid therapy should discontinue treatment on the morning of
the test and ideally 24h beforehand (12h for hydrocortisone or cortisone
acetate). Mineralocorticoid replacement need not be discontinued.
Short ACTH (synacthen) test
The standard test for adrenal failure is the short ACTH test ( Protocols
(p162)). In recent years there has been interest in the low dose (1g or
0.5g) test. Although this appears to detect more minor cases of hypoadrenalism, the clinical significance of defining these differences remains
uncertain.
For secondary (pituitary) adrenal failure, alternative tests include the
insulin stress test ( Protocols (p155)) and the metyrapone test

( (p115)). However, these tests involve applying a stress and carry a risk
in patients who are profoundly hypoadrenal. They are only indicated in
patients within 6 weeks of pituitary surgery or a pituitary insult, where
hypotrophy of the adrenal cortices has yet to develop.
Test to distinguish primary vs. secondary adrenal failure
In the context of known pituitary disease and with failure of other pituitary
hormones, adrenal failure can be assumed to be secondary (pituitary) in
origin. Where isolated adrenal failure is identified, primary adrenal failure
is most likely and suggested by increased skin pigmentation and hyperkalaemia.
Three additional tests can be used to confirm the level of adrenal failure
1. Anti-adrenal antibodies (anti-21 hydroxylase antibodies). These antibodies are present in around 70% of patients with autoimmune adrenalitis (Addisons disease), the commonest cause of primary adrenal
insufficiency. However, they can also be present without adrenal failure
in patients with other autoimmune conditions.
2. Basal plasma ACTH. This is usually the only additional test required.
High levels are seen in primary adrenal failure, normal or low levels
are be seen in secondary adrenal insufficiency. Note that the sample
must be taken and separated immediately at least 24h after the last
dose of a short-acting glucocorticoid (e.g. hydrocortisone) to avoid
pharmacological suppression. Patients on longer acting steroid, may
have to have the test repeated more than 24h after cessation of the
steroid if the result is equivocal.
3. Long (depot) ACTH test. Chronic stimulation with ACTH can recover
function in adrenal glands that have have failed because of lack of pituitary ACTH but not in primary adrenal failure. This is given in the form
of ACTH in oil on 2 consecutive days ( Protocols (p163)), or as an
128
infusion over 48h. With the advent of reliable ACTH assays, this test is
rarely indicated.
Additional diagnostic tests
While the majority of cases of primary hypoadrenalism are due in developed countries to autoimmune disease, there are multiple other rare
causes. These should particularly be considered where adrenal failure
occurs in childhood and/or is associated with neurological disease or
hypogonadism (see table, p129).

Amenorrhoea
Amenorrhoea is often separated into primary (never menstruated) and
secondary (cessation of periods after menarche) amenorrhoea, but many
causes are shared between the two categories. Structural assessment of
the genital tract should be performed earlier in investigation of primary
amenorrheoa. Investigation of oligomenorrhoea is similar to secondary

amenorrhoea. Menorrhagia and intermenstrual bleeding are due to different causes, often gynaecological in origin. Irregular periods can fall into
either category, depending on whether it actually refers to intermenstrual
bleeding or variably spaced (anovulatory) periods. A plan of investigation
is shown in Fig. 2.9.
In secondary amenorrhoea, it is helpful early on to identify primary ovarian
failure (e.g. due to Turners syndrome, premature ovarian failure, radiation, mumps orchitis, radiation, chemotherapy or non-45X gonadal dysgenesis) characterised by high gonadotrophins (LH, FSH). Where the
gonadotrophins are equivocal or low, amenorrhoea due to hyperprolactinaemia or thyrotoxicosis should be excluded but the commonest diagnosis is chronic anovulation due to polycystic ovarian syndrome. In this
condition, the ovaries still produce oestrogen resulting in a positive progesterone withdrawal test: 10mg of medroxyprogesterone is given daily for
5 days and the test is positive if any menstrual bleeding occurs in the following week. If the test is negative, a pituitary (e.g. pituitary tumour) or
hypothalamic (e.g. stress, anorexia nervosa, systemic illness or weight loss)
cause resulting in profound oestrogen deficiency must be considered.
Infertility
Detailed assessment of infertility is beyond the scope of this text and is
best referred to a specialist in this area. However, the general physician
can take the following basic steps, always remembering that the couple
should be assessed together as the problem may lie with the man, the
woman or a combination of both:
1. Semen analysis of the male and where possible a post-coital test to
confirm that live semen are delivered to the vaginal tract.
2. If amenorrhoea is present in the female, investigate as in Fig. 2.9.
130 3. If female is menstruating, determine if the cycles are ovulatory, e.g. by
day 21 progesterone levels or home measurement urinary dipstick of
the LH surge.
If live semen are delivered and ovulation is occurring, then structural
damage or chlamydial infection in the female genital tract is likely and will
require gynaecological assessment.

Hirsutism/virilisation (raised
testosterone)
Hirsutism refers to an increase in androgen-dependent terminal hairs in
the female, typically over the face/chin, lower abdomen, arms and legs and
around the areola of the breast. Virilisation reflects much higher androgen
levels and comprises the features shown in the table below. Over 20% of
women have more androgen-dependent hair than they consider to be
normal. In >95% of cases, this is associated with androgen levels in the
female normal range or slightly elevated in association with polycystic
ovarian syndrome. Some drugs such as cyclosporin, diazoxide, minoxidil
and androgenic steroids can also cause hirsutism. A history of recent
onset (<6 months), rapidly progressive hirsutism, particularly when associated with features of virilisation and a testosterone level of >5nmol/L,

Galactorrhoea (hyperprolactinaemia)
Galactorrhoea is always due to prolactin. Rarely, it can occur with prolactin levels in the normal range and regular menses, but usually is associated with mildly raised levels and amenorrhoea in females or very
elevated levels in males. There is no link with breast sizegynaecomastia

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
in males is associated with excess oestrogen. Once dopamine-blocking
drugs (major tranquillisers and antiemetics but not antidepressants), depot
progesterone administration and hypothyroidism have been excluded, all
patients should have pituitary imaging to exclude a large tumour pressing
on the pituitary stalk (Fig. 2.11). Very high prolactin levels (>10,000iu/L)
are invariably associated with prolactinomas. Nipple manipulation (e.g. to
check if galactorrheoa has ceased) and chest wall trauma (including shingles) can also stimulate prolactin levels.
Asymptomatic raised prolactin
If prolactin is found (accidentally) to be persistently >1000iu/L but menstruation is normal and there is no galactorrhoea, consider the possibility
of macroprolactin. This is a circulating complex of prolactin and
immunoglobulins of no biological importance but gives a high reading in
the prolactin assay and the result often varies widely between assays. If the
lab is alerted to a mismatch between prolactin levels and clinical picture,
they can easily screen for this with a PEG precipitation. Stress and epileptic
fits can result in transiently raised prolactin levels insufficient to cause
galactorrhoea.

Impotence alone (without loss of libido) can also be caused by neurovascular and psychological causes (e.g. diabetes, spinal damage, urological
surgery, atheroslerosis of the aorta, drugs, stress and psychosexual dysfunction). Note that very low levels of testosterone (at least <5nmol/L,
typical normal range 1030nmol/L) are required to result in symptoms.
Mild reductions are common especially in the elderly and are rarely of
importance.

suspected male hypogonadism requires

2 Thyroid function.

2 Testosterone.
Hyperprolactinaemia or thyrotoxicosis if present need to be treated on
their own merits. If the testosterone level is clearly low, high
gonadotrophins point to testicular failure (e.g. testicular surgery, irradiation or trauma, chemotherapy, crypto-orchidism, previous orchitis,
gonadal dysgenesis including Klinfelters syndrome XXY). Low
gonadotrophin levels with a clearly low testosterone point to a hypothalamic or pituitary cause (systemic illness, pituitary tumour). If no cause is
found for hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, the likely cause is Kallmans
syndrome, especially if associated with anosmia.
OHCM p306.

Gynaecomastia
Gynaecomastia results from an excessive effect of oestrogens or a raised
oestrogen/testosterone ration. Causes are summarised in the table below.
True gynaecomastia should be associated with palpable breast tissue and
distinguished from apparent breast enlargement due to obesity. Though
very rare, the most important diagnoses to exclude are hypogonadism,
testicular and lung tumours.

Delayed puberty
Definition
Puberty is considered delayed in girls if there is no breast development by
age 13 (or menses by age 15) and in boys if there is no testicular enlargement by age 14. Note that 3% of normal children will fall into these categories.
Clinical features & initial investigations
A detailed history and examination is required for overt systemic disease,
psychosocial stress, anorexia nervosa and to assess the childs height,
pubertal features (pubic hair, testicular size, breast growth, menses) and
any dysmorphic features (e.g. features of Turners syndrome). Where possible growth rate should be calculated from sequential height measurements over at least 6 months.
If no obvious cause is identified, baseline investigations should
include
2 LH & FSH .
2 TSH , FT4 , prolactin.

2

FBC, U&E, HCO3-, CRP, antigliadin/endomysial antibodies for occult

systemic disease.
Bone age.

This should enable the child to be placed in one of 5 categories
1. Raised LH/FSH (primary gonadal failure).
Causes: Turners syndrome, Kleinfelters syndrome, ovarian/testicular
injury. Proceed to karyotyping (should be performed in all girls with
delayed puberty as Turners syndrome may not be apparent).
2. Short, low LH/FSH, overt systemic disease.
Causes: asthma, anorexia nervosa, social deprivation, generalised
illness, treatment for cancer including cranial irradiation, dysmorphic
(Noonans syndrome and others).
3. Short, low LH/FSH, occult systemic disease.
Causes: hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinaemia, renal failure, renal
tubular acidosis, coeliac disease, Crohns disease.
4. Short, low LH/FSH, no systemic disease.
Causes: constitutional delay of puberty, hypothalamic/pituitary disease.
5. Not short, low LH/FSH.
Causes: Kallmans syndrome (if anosmia present) or isolated
gonadotrophin deficiency. Cannot reliably distinguish from constitutional delay of puberty. Observe.
The investigation of children who fall into the commonest category, short,
low LH/FSH, no systemic disease is summarised in Fig. 2.12. The onset of
puberty after a period of observation is reassuring but continued observation is required to ensure the process proceeds to completion including a
growth spurt. If not, further investigation for disorders of steroidogenesis,
androgen insensitivity, skeletal dysplasia, premature gonadal failure and in
136 the female, genital tract abnormalities and polycystic ovarian syndrome
are indicated.

Short stature
Evaluation of children who are below the 3rd growth centile for
age or particularly small for their family should include
2 Height for age (percentile).
2 Mid-parental height (for girls mean of fathers height minus 12.6cm +
mothers; for boys add 12.6cm to mothers height).
2 Bone age (to assess growth potential/height prediction).
2 Observation over 36 months to determine growth velocity.
Children of short (but normal) parents who are growing normally can be
observed. Dysmorphic children require further evaluation/specialist
assessment. Children who are short for their parental heights (low predicted height), particularly if growing slowly and short children of
pubertal age who have not entered puberty should be investigated as for
delayed puberty. Referral for paediatric endocrinological assessment is
advised.

Precocious puberty
Definition
Puberty is considered premature if multiple signs including accelerated
growth rate and bone age appear by age 8 in girls or age 9 in boys. Note
that isolated breast development (premature thelarche) or pubic hair
(premature adrenarche) are benign conditions if no other evidence of
puberty appears. True precocious puberty requires urgent investigation to
determine the cause and avoid irreparable loss of final adult height. In girls,
it is often idiopathic but not in boys.

Other CNS diseases, e.g.
hydrocephalus, trauma

McCune-Albright syndrome,
hypothyroidism, follicular cyst (female)

Investigations
Precocious puberty is confirmed by pubertal levels of sex steroids (oestradiol, testosterone). Testicular enlargement (or ovarian enlargement on
ultrasound) and detectable LH/FSH levels suggest central precocious
puberty and CT/MRI scan of the brain is indicated. Gonadal enlargement
can also be seen with testitoxicosis, hCG-producing tumours, hypothyroidism and McCune-Albright syndrome. Further investigation should be
performed in combination with a paediatric endocrinologist.

Thyroid function testinggeneral
In the majority of cases, thyroid function testing and interpretation is
straightforward. However, the following points should be borne in mind.

138 Which first line test?TSH
TSH levels are the most sensitive indicator of thyroid dysfunction but
cannot be used in patients with pituitary disease. TSH used alone as a first
line test will miss (levels normal) unsuspected cases of secondary
hypothyroidism and some laboratories therefore combine TSH and T4 as
first line tests.

Which tests?T4/T3
Free T3 and T4 tests (FT3, FT4) are now more reliable and preferred
(though more expensive) to total T3 or T4 measurements. Interference in
the assays does occur but is increasingly rare. Total thyroid hormone
levels are markedly influenced by changes in binding proteins (e.g. due to
pregnancy, oestrogen-containing contraceptives).
Thyroid autoantibodies
These are markers of autoimmune thyroid disease. Antithyroid microsomal antibodies have been identified as antithyroid peroxidase (ANTITPO) antibodies. Antimicrosomal antibodies are much more sensitive than
antithyroglobulin antibodies and are present in around 4580% of Graves
disease and 8095% of Hashimotos disease/atrophic thyroiditis.
Increasingly, labs are measuring anti-TPO directly as their only antibody
test. Note that anti-TSH receptor antibodiesthe cause of Graves
diseaseare difficult to measure and not routinely assayed. Although they
are the most reliable test for diagnosing Graves disease, currently their
Dayan CM. (2001) Interpretation of thyroid function tests. Lancet 357, 619624.

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
only definite indications are to determine the cause of thyroid disease in
pregnancy and the post-partum period and assess the risk of neonatal thyrotoxicosis.
Tests should agree
To confirm thyroid dysfunction at least two thyroid function tests and in
cases of doubt all three (TSH, FT3, FT4) should be performed. The results
of the tests should be in agreementif not, assay interference (heterophile antibodies, anti-T4 or anti-T3 antibodies present in the serum) or
unusual causes should be suspected.
Avoid thyroid function testing in systemically unwell patients
In very ill patients, especially in intensive care, a pattern of sick euthyroidism is often seen, with low TSH levels, low free T3 levels and sometimes low free T4 levels. Accurate interpretation of true thyroid status is
impossible. A raised free T3 level in a very ill patient suggests significant
hyperthyroidism and a very raised TSH (>20mU/L) with undetectable free
T4 levels suggests profound hypothyroidism. Other changes should be
interpreted with extreme caution and the tests repeated after recovery.
OHCM pp292, 294.

Hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis)
Clinical features
Hyperthyroidism is rare in childhood but affects all adult age groups.
Classic features include weight loss despite increased appetite, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, heat intolerance, anxiety, agitation, tremor and
proximal weakness. Lid-retraction and lid-lag can be seen in any cause of
hyperthyroidism but proptosis, periorbital oedema, chemosis, diplopia and
optic nerve compression only occur in association with Graves disease
(thyroid eye disease), or occasionally associated with pretibial myxoedema and thyroid acropachy. In the elderly, presentation with isolated
weight loss or atrial fibrillation is common. Raised alkaline phosphatase
and sex hormone-binding globulin, leucopenia and rarely hypercalcaemia
are recognised associations.
Thyroid function testing
An undetectable TSH level and a 4 free T3 level are required to diagnose
hyperthyroidism. In milder cases, T4 levels may be in the normal range
(T3 toxicosis). Normal TSH levels with 4 T4 and T3 are seen in TSHsecreting pituitary tumours (very rare) or in patients with thyroid
hormone resistance (also very rare).
Investigation of cause (see Fig. 2.13)
Under the age of 40, Graves disease is the commonest cause. After this
age, Graves disease, toxic nodular goitre and toxic nodule all occur.
However, a short history (1 month) of symptoms raises the possibility of

139

self-resolving (transient) thyroiditis, a diagnosis supported by neck pain
and raised ESR (viral/subacute/De Quervains) or occurrence in the first 9
months post-partum (post-partum thyroiditis). Transient thyrotoxicosis
can also occur in patients with subclinical autoimmune thyroiditis (silent
thyroiditis). When thyroid eye disease is present, no further tests are
required to diagnose Graves disease. If not, antithyroid antibodies (e.g.
anti-TPO antibodies) and isotope thyroid scanning can be useful to distinguish possible causes. No uptake is seen in transient thyroiditis. Excess
thyroid hormone ingestion rarely causes very marked thyrotoxicosis
unless the active form (T3) is taken (T3 tablets or dessicated thyroid
extract).
Iodine
Iodine has multiple and conflicting effects on the thyroid. Potassium iodide
inhibits release of thyroid hormones from the gland and thyroid hormone
biosynthesis (Wolff-Chaikoff effect) promoting hypothyroidism. However,
escape from these effects occurs in most individuals in a few weeks. In
patients with a multinodular goitre, excess iodine (e.g. in amiodarone or
radiographic contrast media) can result in thyrotoxicosis by excess provision of substrate (Jod-Basedow effect).
Amiodarone
Has 3 main effects on the thyroid hormone axis: (1) inhibits T47T3 conversion, which in the pituitary can result in a mild rise in TSH (reduced
thyroid hormone action), (2) can induce hypothyroidism, usually in the
first year of treatment, (3) can induce hyperthyroidism either via the JodBasedow effect in patients with multinodular goitre or by a destructive
thyroiditis in healthy glands. Thyrotoxicosis can occur at any time after
commencing therapy and can be very difficult to treat.

140 Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy
Significant hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is generally due to Graves
disease. Mild hyperthyoidism, particularly in association with hyperemesis
gravidarum in the first trimester, is often due to a cross-reaction by the
very high hCG levels with the TSH receptor (gestational thyrotoxicosis).
In the post-partum period, thyrotoxicosis may be due to post-partum thyroiditis (self-resolving) or a recurrence of Graves disease (requires treatment). Measurement of anti-TSH receptor antibody levels may be
indicated to distinguish these possibilities.
Thyroid storm
This is defined as severe thyrotoxicosis with confusion/delirium not
explained by other factors. There is no definitive test and levels of thyroid
hormone are not higher than in other individuals with no features of
storm. Severe agitation, tachycardia and hyperpyrexia are usually seen.
Usually precipiated by infection, trauma or surgery, especially to the
thyroid gland. Very rare but tends to occur in individuals who have been
poorly compliant in the first few weeks of drug therapy for thyrotoxicosis.
Anti-TSH receptor antibody testing
This test is not routinely available in most labs. Although it is positive in
>90% of cases of Graves disease, in most cases it does not alter clinical
management. Indications include distinguishing gestational thyrotoxicosis
or post-partum thyroiditis from Graves disease, indicating the risk of
neonatal thyrotoxicosis and (controversial) predicting recurrence after a
course of thionamide drug therapy.

Hypothyroidism
Clinical features
Classic clinical features of hypothyroidism include weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, constipation, memory loss, lethargy/slow
thought/slowing up, menorrhagia, periorbital/facial oedema, loss of outer
two-thirds of eye brows, deafness, chest pain and coma. Rarely seen
nowadays as thyroid function tests are easy to perform and detect the
disease usually at an earlier stage. Weight gain, dry skin and lethargy are
frequently reported, but even in biochemically hypothyroid individuals can
only confidently be ascribed to thyroid status if they reverse on treatment.
Biochemical diagnosis
4 TSH with T4 in the normal range is referred to as subclinical hypothyroidism. 4 TSH with 5 T4 is overt hypothyroidism. 5 T4 with TSH in the
normal range may be due to pituitary failure (2 hypothyroidism) and if

141

persistent requires pituitary function testing. See Fig. 2.14 for other patterns of thyroid function tests.
Differential diagnosis (causes)
In iodine sufficient countries, the vast majority of spontaneous hypothyroidism is due to autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimotos disease if goitre
present, atrophic thyroiditis if goitre absent)antithyroid antibodies
present in 8090% of cases. Other common causes are post-thyroidectomy, post-radioiodine therapy and side effects of amiodarone or lithium.
Rarer causes include treatment with cytokines (e.g. interferons, GM-CSF,
interleukin-2), vast excess iodine intake (iodine drops, water purifying
tablets), congenital hypothyroidism (caused by a variety of genetic defects,
should be detected by neonatal screening programme), iodine deficiency
(urinary iodide excretion <45g/day, commonest cause worldwide esp.
mountainous areas, S Germany, Greece, Paraguayendemic goitre),
thyroid-blocking substances in the indigenous diet (goitrogens esp. in brassicas and cassava, e.g. in Sheffield, Spain, Bohemia, Kentucky, Virginia,
Tasmaniaendogenous goitre without iodine deficiency), Pendreds syndrome (mild hypothyroidism with sensineural deafness due to Mondini
cochlear defect, positive perchlorate discharge test). For transient
hypothyroidismsee below.
iiDiagnostic catches
4 TSH and 5 T4 always represents hypothyroidism. If the TSH alone is 4
and the T4 is not even slightly low, a heterophile antibody interfering in
the TSH assay may be present in the patients serum. This is especially
likely if there is no change in TSH level after thyroxine treatment but the
T4 level rises (confirming compliance with tablets). For unusual patterns of
thyroid function tests, see Fig. 2.14. Note that within the first 13 months
142 (or longer) after treatment of hyperthyroidism, profound hypothyroidism
may develop with a 5 T4 but the TSH may still be suppressed or only
mildly raised due to the long period of TSH suppression prior to treatment. Raised TSH alone with disproportionate symptoms of lethargy may
be seen in hypoadrenalism. If suspected treat with steroids first as thyroxine
may precipitate an Addisonian crisis.
Transient hypothyroidism
Transient or self-resolving hypothyroidism, often preceded by hyperthyroidism, is seen in viral thyroiditis, after pregnancy (post-partum thyroiditis) and in some individuals with autoimmune thyroiditis (positive
antithyroid antibodies). Treatment temporarily with thyroxine is only
required if the patient is very symptomatic. Thyroid function should return
to normal within 6 months. Hypothyroidism may also be transient in the
first 6 months after radioiodine therapy.
Subclinical hypothyroidism
A raised TSH (<20mU/L) with normal T4/T3 is very common and seen in
510% of women and ~2% of males. It is usually due to subclinical autoimmune thyroid disease and is frequently discovered on routine testing. In
randomised trials, ~20% of patients obtain psychological benefit from
beginning T4 therapy, in many others it is probably truly asymptomatic. If
antithyroid antibodies are detectable, the rate of progression to overt
hypothyroidism is ~50% at 20 years, but higher than this with higher
initial TSH levels. If the TSH alone is raised with negative antibodies (or
the TSH is normal with raised antibodies alone), overt hypothyroidism
develops in 25% at 20 years. A reasonable approach is a trial of thyroxine

TSH >10mU/L, and observing the TSH level at 612-monthly intervals in
asymptomatic patients with TSH <10mU/L.
Hypothyroidism and pregnancy
Overt hypothyroidism is associated with poor obstetric outcomes. Recent
evidence suggests that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with a
slight reduction in the babys IQ and should be treated. Many authorities
advocate screening for hypothyroidism in all antenatal patients as early as
possible in pregnancy. Patients on T4 need to increase their dose by 50g
from the first trimester of pregnancy. Maternal thyroxine can compensate
for fetal thyroid failure in utero but congenital hypothyroidism must be
detected at birth (screening test) to avoid mental retardation developing.
Where the mother and fetus are both hypothyroidmost commonly due
to iodine deficiencymental retardation can develop in utero (cretinisim).
Note that mothers with positive antithyroid antibodies and/or subclinical
hypothyroidism have a 50% chance of developing (transient) post-partum
thyroiditis.
OHCM p296.

Diabetes mellitus
Glycosuria
Urine testing is a valuable pointer to diabetes mellitus (DM) but is insufficient to establish the diagnosis. Although modern glucose oxidase test
strips are free from interference by other reducing substances, glycosuria
144 does not always indicate DM; the converse also pertains. Thus, glycosuria
has low sensitivity and specificity.
Causes of glycosuria
2 DM .
2 Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT ).
2 Lowered renal threshold for glucose (esp. pregnancy, children).
Note: Fluid intake, urine concentration and certain drugs may influence
results
The diagnosis of DM relies on the demonstration of unequivocally
elevated blood glucose levels that can be
2 Casual (random)usually the first line investigation.
2 Fasting plasma glucose (FPG )an alternative to a casual reading.
2 75g oral glucose challengeif necessary.
iNeither the confirmation nor exclusion of DM should rest on measurement of longer term indicators of glycaemia such as glycated haemoglobin
or fructosamine. Although of high specificity, these tests are not sufficiently standardised nor do they have sufficient sensitivity. False negative
results are particularly likely with less marked degrees of hyperglycaemia,
especially in subjects with IGT or IFG.
Blood glucose
A blood glucose measurement is the essential investigation in the diagnosis of DM. A glucose-specific assay is required. An appropriate sample
must be collected, usually venous plasma (in a tube containing fluoride

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
oxalate as an inhibitor of glycolysis) and the sample tested without undue
delay in an accredited laboratory.
Reagent test strips
Although convenient and readily available, reagent test strips for monitoring of capillary glucose (even when used in conjunction with a calibrated reflectance meter) are unsuitable for diagnosing DM; a
confirmatory laboratory measurement must therefore always be performed. In the absence of typical symptoms the diagnosis should be confirmed by a repeat measurement on a separate day; this may be either a
casual or FPG sample.
iConfirmation of the diagnosis is especially important in asymptomatic
individuals.
An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is rarely required to confirm the
diagnosis and should not be regarded as a first line investigation. The
OGTT is time consuming, requires trained staff and is less reproducible
than FPG.
Revised diagnostic criteria for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus
Random plasma glucose
>11.1mmol/L
FPG
> 7.0mmol/L
iThe diagnostic FPG is lower than the previous National Diabetes Data
Group (1979) and WHO (1980, 1985) criteria which specified a diagnostic 145
fasting plasma glucose >7.8mmol/L.
The 1997 criteria introduced the new intermediate category of impaired
fasting glucose (IFG) defined as:
2

FPG 6.16.9 mmol/L.

False +ve diagnoses may arise if the subject has prepared inadequately (see
table below). This possibility is more likely following the reduction in the
diagnostic threshold for diabetes based on FPG in the 1997 revised criteria.

Preparation for a fasting blood test
Refrain from any food or drink from midnight before the morning of the test.
Water only is permitted.
Regular medication can generally be deferred until the blood sample has been
taken.
The appropriate sample is taken between 0800 and 0900h the following
morning.
This preparation is also required for a 75g oral OGTT or for measurement of fasting blood
lipids. Fasting blood tests should be avoided in insulin-treated patientsrisk of
hypoglycaemia.

Impaired glucose tolerance
The diagnosis of IGT can only be made using a 75g oral glucose tolerance
test; a random blood glucose measurement will often point to the diagnosis when other results are non-diagnostic.
This category denotes a stage intermediate between normal glucose levels
and DM ( OHCM, section 9). By definition, plasma glucose levels are not
raised to DM levels so typical osmotic symptoms are absent. Although
subjects with IGT are not at direct risk of developing chronic microvascular tissue complications, the incidence of macrovascular complications
(i.e. CHD, CVD, PAD) is increased. Presentation with one of these conditions should therefore alert the clinician to the possibility of undiagnosed
IGT (or type 2 DM). Note that a proportion of individuals who are diagnosed by an OGTT may revert to normal on re-testing.
Impaired fasting glucose
If an OGTT is performed, the 120min glucose concentration must be
<7.8mmol/L. This category is also usually asymptomatic. To date, crosssectional studies suggest that IGT and IFG may not be synonymous in
terms of pathophysiology and long-term implications.
Oral glucose tolerance test
The OGTT (see table below) continues to be regarded as the most robust
means for establishing the diagnosis of diabetes in equivocal cases. The
WHO suggests that only when an OGTT cannot be performed should the
diagnosis rely on FPG. OGTTs should be carried out under controlled
conditions after an overnight fast.

146

Oral glucose tolerance test
Anhydrous glucose is dissolved in 250ml water; flavouring with sugar-free
lemon and chilling increase palatibility and may reduce nausea. The subjecrt sits
quietly throughout the test.
Blood glucose is sampled before (time 0) and at 120min after ingestion of the
drink, which should be completed within 5min.
Urinalysis may also be performed every 30min although is only of interest if a
significant alteration in renal threshold for glucose is suspected.

The interpretation of the 75g glucose tolerance test is shown in the table
below. These results apply to venous plasma. Marked carbohydrate depletion can impair glucose tolerance; the subject should have received adequate nutrition in the days preceding the test.
Effect of intercurrent illness on glycaemia
Patients under the physical stress associated with surgery, trauma, acute
MI, acute pulmonary oedema or stroke may have transient 4 of plasma
glucoseoften settles rapidly without antidiabetic therapy. However, the
hormonal stress response in such clinical situations is liable to unmask
pre-existing DM or to precipitate DM in predisposed individuals. Blood
glucose should be carefully monitored and urine tested for ketones.
Sustained hyperglycaemia, particularly with ketonuria, demands vigorous
treatment with insulin in an acutely ill patient.

Notes:

diabetes are >6.1mmol/lL (fasting) and 11.1mmol/L (120min). The range for impaired fasting
glucose based on capillary whole blood is >5.6 and <6.1mmo/L.

Acute myocardial infarction ( OHCM section 5)
Hyperglycaemia at presentation is associated with a higher mortality
even in subjects with previously undiagnosed DM; tight metabolic control
using an intravenous insulin-dextrose infusion (followed by subcutaneous
insulin) significantly reduced mortality in a recent multicentre Swedish
study.
Stroke ( OHCM section 10)
Hyperglycaemia on admission may be associated with a poorer outcome;
however, there is no clinical trial evidence to date that intensive control of 147
hyperglycaemia improves prognosis.
Re-testing is usually indicated following resolution of the acute illnessan
OGTT at a 46-week interval is recommended if glucose levels are equivocal.

Potential diagnostic difficulties of DM
Type 1 DM
2 This is diagnosed principally on clinical and biochemical features
( OHCM section 12). The presence of serum islet cell antibodies
(ICA, in ~3060% of patients) at diagnosis may confirm the diagnosis.
The proportion of patients testing positive for ICA 5 with increasing
duration of type 1 DM. If there is doubt, treat with insulin if indicated
on clinical and biochemical criteria; the need for insulin can be considered at a later date. However, discontinuation of insulin can be disastrous in patients with type 1 DM. The decision to stop insulin should
be made only by an experienced diabetologist. iA ve test for ICA
does not necessarily exclude type 1 DM.
2 Other humoral markers of autoimmunity, e.g. anti-GAD65 antibodies,
anti-insulin antibodies, are generally only available in research laboratories.
2 Stiff man syndrome: rare condition presenting as a progressive spastic
paraparesis with polyglandular endocrine involvement ( p246). AntiGAD65 antibodies are present; approximately 30% of patients develop
insulin-requiring DM.
2 MODY : a small percentage of young patients with relatively minor
hyperglycaemia and no ketonuria, will prove to have relatively
uncommon inherited forms of DM, e.g. MODY. Such patients often
receive insulin therapy from diagnosis, the assumption being that they
have type 1 DM. Prerequisites for the diagnosis include:
 A family history with an autosomal dominant inheritance.
 Diagnosis under the age of 25 years.
148
In some subtypes of MODY (glucokinase mutations; MODY 2), good
glycaemic control may be maintained life-long without insulin or even
oral antidiabetic agents. The exception is pregnancy; insulin may be
required temporarily in order to ensure optimal controloral antidiabetic agents should be avoided. The diagnosis of MODY may be confirmed by molecular genetic testing although presently this is not
widely available. Appropriate counselling is required. Seek expert
advice through your local hospital diabetes unit.
2 Early-onset type 2 diabetesIn recent years there has been a dramatic
increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in younger patients (children and adolescents) from non-white ethnic minorities. This may
present diagnostic difficulties but some pointers suggest the diagnosis:
 Obesity is usually a prominent feature.
 Serum autoantibody tests for type 1 DM are negative.
 A skin marker of insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans) may be
present.
If in doubt, it is usually safer to treat younger patients with insulin; this is
especially true if ketosis is present.

Monitoring diabetic control
Self-testing by diabetic patients
Self-testing of urine and/or capillary blood glucose testing can readily be
performed by the majority of patients. Measurements of longer term gly-

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
caemic control are laboratory-based or require specialised techniques
generally suitable only for use in a hospital clinic.
Urine testing
Glycosuria: Semiquantitative testing for glucose using reagentimpregnated test strips by patients is of limited value. Urinalysis
provides retrospective information over a limited period of time. Other
limitations:
2 The renal threshold for the reabsorption of glucose in the PCT is
~10mmol/L on average but varies between individuals. Subjects with a
low threshold will tend to show glycosuria more readily, even with
normal glucose tolerance (renal glycosuria). Children are particularly
liable to test positive for glucose. The renal threshold is effectively
lowered in pregnancy. Conversely, a high threshold, common among
the elderly, may give a misleadingly reassuring impression of satisfactory control. Fluid intake and urine concentration may affect glycosuria.
Renal impairment may elevate the threshold for glucose reabsorption.
2 Delayed bladder emptying, e.g. due to diabetic autonomic neuropathy
( OHCM section 9), will reduce the accuracy of the measurements
through dilution.
2 Hypoglycaemia cannot be detected by urinalysis.
Ketonuria: Semiquantitative test strips for acetocetate (e.g. Ketostix)
are available for patients with type 1 DM. Useful when intercurrent
illness leads to disturbance of metabolic control. The presence of
ketonuria on dipstick testing in association with hyperglycaemia 149
indicates marked insulin deficiency (absolute, or more commonly,
relative). Increased doses of insulin are indicated in such circumstances
to avert more severe metabolic decompensation (DKA, see below and
OHCM section 21). Occasionally, patients with type 2 DM develop
ketosis during severe intercurrent illness, e.g. major sepsis. Neither
Ketostix nor Acetest tablets detect 3-hydroxybutyrate (although
acetone is detected by Acetest). Occasional underestimation of the
degree of ketonaemia using these tests is a well-recognized, albeit
uncommon caveat of alcoholic ketoacidosis ( OHCM section 9).
Self-testing of blood glucose
Self-testing of capillary blood glucose obtained by fingerprick has become
an established method for monitoring glycaemic control. Frequent testing
is a prerequisite for safe intensive insulin therapy such as that employed in
the DCCT. Enzyme-impregnated dry strip methods are available which can
be used in conjunction with meter devices to improve accuracy. Most are
based on the glucose oxidase reaction:
Glucose + O2 7 Gluconic acid + H2O2
Glucose
oxidase
The hydrogen peroxide generated by the reaction reacts with a reduced
dye in the test strip producing an oxidised colour proportional to the
amount of H2O2 formed. This reflects the amount of glucose that was oxi-

dised. In most strips, blood cells are excluded by a layer within the strip.
Thus, the glucose concentration in capillary plasma is measured.
Adequate training and a system of quality control are important; even
when trained health professionals use such systems in clinics or hospitals
misleading results are possible, particularly in the lower range of blood
glucose results. Where there is doubt, an appropriate sample (in a tube
containing the glycolysis inhibitor fluoride oxalate) should be collected
immediately for analysis by the clinical chemistry laboratory. However,
acute treatment of hypoglycaemia, where indicated, should not be
delayed.

Laboratory assessment of
glycaemic control
Glycated haemoglobin
HbA1c (comprises 6080% total glycated haemoglobin, HbA1) is formed
by the slow, irreversible, post-translational non-enzymatic glycation of the
N-terminal valine residue of the  chain of haemoglobin. In retina and
renal glomerulus this process is implicated in the pathogenesis of the longterm complications of diabetes ( OHCM section 9). The proportion of
HbA1c : total haemoglobin (normal non-diabetic reference range approximately 46%) provides a useful index of average glycaemia over the preceding 68 weeks. The result is disproportionately affected by the blood
glucose levels during the final month before the test (~50% of value).
Average HbA1c levels collected over a longer period (i.e. years) provide an
150 estimate of the
risk of microvascular complications. Sustained high concentrations identify patients in whom efforts should be made to improve
long-term glycaemic control.
In patients with type 1 DM, a landmark randomised, controlled clinical
trial (the DCCT) confirmed a causal link between degree of metabolic
control and the development and progression of microvascular complications of diabetes (especially retinopathy) and neuropathy. Consensus
panels in the USA and Europe have suggested targets for HbA1c of
approximately 78% for most patients (if circumstances and frequency of
hypoglycaemia allow). By contrast, tight glycaemic control may be contraindicated by advanced complications, e.g. clinical nephropathy with
renal impairment. It is recommended that HbA1c should be measured
every 6 months in younger patients with type 1 DM. Pregnancy requires
monthly monitoring of HbA1c concentrations (although other measures
may be preferable in pregnancysee below: fructosamine). Blood can be
collected by venesection ahead of the clinic visit (in primary care, by the
hospital phlebotomy service or even by a nurse in the community if necessary). Alternatives include rapid assays for use in the clinic, or self-collection in advance of a fingerprick sample (in a capillary tube or on filter
paper) which is mailed to the laboratory.

Goldstein DE, Little RR, Lorenz RA et al. (1995) Tests of glycemia in diabetes Diabetes Care 18,
896909.

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
Limitations of HBA1c measurements
Although glycated haemoglobin levels are a reliable indicator of recent
average glycaemic control they do not provide information about the daily
pattern of blood glucose levels; this supplementary information required
for logical adjustment of insulin doses is derived from home blood glucose
monitoring (see below). More recent changes in glycaemia (i.e. within the
preceding 4 weeks or so) will influence HbA1c level more than glucose
levels 12 or more weeks ago.
Spurious HbA1c levels may arise in states of
2 Blood loss/haemolysis/reduced red cell survival (low HbA1c).
2 Haemoglobinopathy (
OHCM section 16).
2 4 levels of HbS.
2 4 levels of HbF (high HbA1c).
Uraemia due to advanced diabetic nephropathy is associated with anaemia
and 5 RBC survival thereby falsely lowering HbA1c levels.
Fructosamine: refers to protein-ketoamine products resulting from the
glycation of plasma proteins. The fructosamine assay measures glycated
plasma proteins (mainly albumin) reflecting average glycaemia over the
preceding 23 weeks. This is a shorter period than that assessed using
glycated haemoglobin measurements and may be particularly useful
when rapid changes in control need to be assessed, e.g. during
pregnancy. Levels can be misleading in hypoalbuminaemic states, e.g.
nephrotic syndrome ( OHCM section 8). Some fructosamine assays 151
are subject to interference by hyperuricaemia or hyperlipidaemia.
Measurements of fructosamine are less expensive than glycated
haemoglobin assays; this may be an important consideration for some
laboratory services. The methodology is suitable for automation and
rapid results can be obtained for use within a clinic attendance obviating
the requirement for a prior blood test.

iiDiabetic emergencies: diabetic
ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic
syndrome & lactic acidosis
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) should be considered in any unconscious or
hyperventilating patient. The hyperosmolar non-ketotic (HONK)
syndrome is characterised by marked hyperglycaemia and dehydration in
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group. (1993) The effect of intensive
treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulindependent diabetes mellitus. NEJM 329, 977986; UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group. (1998)

352, 837853.

the absence of significant ketosis or acidosis. Lactic acidosis (LA)
associated with metformin is uncommon. A rapid clinical examination and
bedside blood and urine tests should allow the diagnosis to be made
( OHCM, section 12). Treatment (IV rehydration, insulin, electrolyte
replacement) of these metabolic emergencies should be commenced
without delay (see reference for details).
Confirm diagnosis by bedside measurement of
2 Capillary blood glucose (glucose-oxidase reagent test strip;
p144).
2 Urinary dipstick for glucose and ketones (e.g. Ketostix). Note: nitroprusside tests detect acetoacetate, but not 3-hydroxybutyrate. This
may be relevant in some circumstances, e.g. alcoholic ketoacidosis (see
below). Venous plasma may also be tested for ketones.
2 Urine for nitrites and leucocytes (UTI ).
Venous blood for urgent laboratory measurement of
2 Plasma glucose (fluoride-oxalate; itrue euglycaemic DKA is rare).
2 U&E (arterial K+ can be measured by some gas analysers). Plasma Na+
may be depressed as a consequence of hyperglycaemia or marked
hyperlipidaemia.
2 Plasma creatinine (imay be falsely elevated in some assays by DKA ).
2 Plasma lactate (if indicatedcan also be measured by some gas analysers). Indicated if acidosis without heavy ketonuria is present. LA is a
complication of tissue hypoxia (type A) and is a rare complication of
metformin treatment in patients with type 2 DM (type B).
2 Plasma osmolality in HONK either by freezing point depression or
calculated: 2  [plasma Na+] + [plasma K+] + [plasma glucose] +
[plasma urea].
2 FBC (non-specific leucocytosis is common in DKA ).
152 2 Blood cultures (signs of infection, e.g. fever, may be absent in DKA).
2 ABG s (corrected for hypothermia) for:
 Arterial pH, bicarbonate, PCO2 and PO2 (if shock or hypotension).
Repeat laboratory measurement of blood glucose, electrolytes, urea at 2,
4 and 6h and as indicated thereafter. Electrolyte disturbances, renal
impairment or oliguria should prompt more frequent (12 hourly) measurements of plasma K+. Capillary blood glucose is monitored hourly at
the bedside.
iAvoidance of hypokalaemia and hypoglycaemia are most important
during therapy.
Other investigations, as indicated
2 CXR .
2 Microbial culture of urine, sputum, etc.
2 ECG (acute MI may precipitate metabolic decompensation; note that
serum transaminases and CK may be non-specifically elevated in DKA).
2 Sickle cell test (in selected patients;
OHCM section 13).
2 Venous plasma PO3
4 (if there is respiratory depression).
iPerformance of investigations should not delay initiation of treatment
and transfer to a high-dependency or intensive care unit.
A severe metabolic acidosis in the absence of hyperglycaemia (or other
obvious cause of acidosis such as renal failure) raises the possibility of

Alcoholic ketoacidosisthis occurs in alcoholics following a binge.
Alterations in hepatic redox state may result in a misleading negative
or trace Ketostix reaction. A similar caveat may occasionally be
encountered when significant LA coexists with DKA. Venous plasma
glucose may be normal or 4.

iAnion gap ( p432) >15mmol/L. Normally, the anion gap (<10mmol/L)
results from plasma proteins, SO42, PO34 and lactate ions. When the anion
gap is increased, measurement of plasma ketones, lactate, etc. usually confirms the aetiology.

Investigation of hyperlipidaemia
Primary dyslipidaemias are relatively common and contribute to an individuals risk of developing atheroma (e.g. CHD, CVD). Prominent examples include familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCHL, ~23% of UK
population) and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH, UK incidence 1 in 500). Major hypertriglyceridaemia also predisposes to pancreatitis. The key features of familial FH, FCHL and diabetic dyslipidaemia are
considered later.
Investigations
Although many subtle alterations in plasma lipids have been described,
therapeutic decisions rest on measurement of some or all of the following
in serum or plasma (plasma being preferred since it can be cooled rapidly):
2 Total cholesterol (may be measured in non-fasting state in first
instance since levels are not greatly influenced by meals).
2 Triglycerides (after 12h fast).
2 Low-density lipoprotein (LDL )-cholesterol (calculated using the
Friedewald formula when triglycerides are <4.5mmol/L):

153

LDL-cholesterol = total cholesterol  HDL-cholesterol  triglycerides
2

HDL-cholesterol (regarded as the cardioprotective subfraction
HDL particles are synthesised in the gut and liver and thought to be

involved in reverse transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to
the liver where it can be excreted as bile salts.
Notes on sampling in relation to lipoprotein metabolism
2 Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) are measured after a ~12h overnight
fast in order to clear diet-derived chylomicrons.
2 Alcohol should be avoided the evening prior to measurement of
triglycerides (can exacerbate hypertriglyceridaemia).
2 A weight-maintaining diet is recommended for 23 weeks before
testing.
2 Lipid measurements should be deferred for 23 weeks after minor
illness and 23 months after major illness, surgery or trauma since cholesterol may be temporarily 5 and triglycerides 4. Following acute
myocardial infarction it is generally accepted that plasma cholesterol is
reliable if measured within 24h of the onset of symptoms.
2 The effects of certain drugs on lipids should be considered (see table).
2 Glycaemic control should be optimised wherever possible before measuring plasma lipids in patients with diabetes.
Important additional considerations are
2 Day-to-day variabilitygenerally, decisions to treat hyperlipidaemia
should be based on more than one measurement over a period of 12
weeks.
154 2 Exclusion of secondary hyperlipidaemiamany common conditions,
drugs and dietary factors can influence plasma lipids (see table).
2 Family members should also have their plasma lipids measured if a
familial hyperlipidaemia is suspected in a proband.
Both cholesterol and triglycerides may be affected to some degree by
these factors, but one often predominates. Pre-existing primary hyperlipidaemias may be exacerbated.
Clinical features
E.g. xanthelasma, tendon xanthomas, etc. should always be sought. A
detailed family history, drug history and medical history (for diabetes and
other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension) should always be
obtained. Certain endocrine disorders, impaired hepatic or renal function
can influence circulating lipid composition and cardiovascular risk. A classification of the major familial dyslipidaemias is presented in the table below
(p.156).
i Specialist advice should be sought in the management of major or resistant hyperlipidaemias.

Test protocols
Insulin tolerance test (insulin stress test)
Indication: suspected ACTH or GH deficiency.
Contraindications: patients with epilepsy, coronary heart disease (check
ECG).

Children: use no more than 0.1U/kg. Considerable care should be
exercised; the test should only be performed in a centre with expertise.
Alternatives: short synacthen test for hypocortisolism; stimulation tests
for growth hormone deficiency ( see p104).
Preparation: patient fasting overnight. Bed required (though day case
procedure). Patient must be accompanied home and may not drive.
OMIT morning hydrocortisone or other steroid hormone replacement
if patient is taking this and previous days growth hormone. Physician
must be present throughout the test. Requires written consent.
Procedure: early morning outpatient test in fasting patient. Indwelling
venous cannula and constant medical supervision required throughout.
Cannula is kept patent by running saline infusion with three-way tap for

sampling. Discard initial 23mL when each sample is taken. Label all
samples clearly with time and patient details. Near-patient testing
glucometer required.
1. Take baseline blood for glucose, cortisol and GH. Check IV access
working well. Review test with the patient and explain symptoms
he/she is likely to experience (see 5 below).
2. Draw up 25mL of 50% dextrose for immediate administration IF
REQUIRED.
3. Give soluble (regular) insulin as an intravenous bolus in a dose of
0.15U/kg after an overnight fast. Consider 0.1U/kg (lower dose) if suspected profound hypocortisolism. iThis appears a very small dose,
e.g. typically around 10 units. CHECK DOSE CALCULATION CAREFULLY. Usually an insulin syringe is used to draw it up and then transfer
it to a 2mL syringe containing saline.
4. Take blood at 15min intervals (0, 15, 30, 45, 60min) for glucose, cortisol and GH.
5. Observe for symptoms and signs of hypoglycaemia. First sign is usually
profuse sweating. Patient may then be aware of symptoms such as palpitations, hunger, paraesthesiae. This typically occurs 3045min into
the test. Check near-patient glucose to confirm <3.5mmol/L. Continue
to talk to and reassure patient. If patient becomes very drowsy or
unrousable then given 25mL of 50% glucose. This does not invalidate
the test as the hypoglycaemic stimulus has already occurred. Continue
blood sampling at standard times.
6. If patient has not experienced hypoglycaemia by 45min and nearpatient glucose is >4mmol/L, give a further intravenous bolus of
0.15U/kg or 0.3U/kg if patient known to be very insulin resistant (e.g.
acromegalic). Repeat sampling at 15min intervals for 60min after this
second bolus.
7. At end of procedure (usually 60min), give IV 25mL dextrose if patient
158
still has symptoms of hypoglycaemia.
8. Give patient a meal including complex carbohydrate (e.g. sandwiches
or lunch) and observe for a minimum of 1h further before accompanied discharge.
Unwanted effects: severe hypoglycaemia with depressed level of
consciousness or convulsion requires immediate termination of test
with 25mL of 50% dextrose IV. Repeat if necessary and follow with 5 or
10% dextrose infusion. Continue to collect samples for hormone and
glucose measurements.
Interpretation: test is only interpretable if adequate hypoglycaemia is
achieved (<2.2mmol/L). Normal maximal cortisol response
>550nmol/L. Normal GH response >20mU/L. Impaired responses (if
hypoglycaemic stimulus adequate) denote corticotrophin (assuming
adrenal glands are normal) or GH deficiency or both. Peak GH response
<10mU/L is sufficient to consider GH replacement; peak GH response
<5mU/L is severe growth hormone deficiency.

Combined anterior pituitary function
testing
Indication: assessment for anterior pituitary hypofunction.
Contraindications: previous reaction to stimulatory hormones.

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
Alternatives: insulin tolerance testing for GH and adrenal axis;
metyrapone test for adrenal axis.
Preparation: test usually performed in morning for basal sampling.
Procedure: IV cannula inserted. Basal blood samples taken for cortisol,
oestradiol (3) or testosterone (9), free T4 and IGF-1. Hypothalalmic
hormones are given sequentially intravenously each as a bolus over
around 20s: LHRH 100g, TRH 200g and ACTH 250g. Additionally
GHRH (1g/kg body weight) may be given. (Reduce doses in children.)
Samples are drawn at 0, 20, 30, 60 and 120min for LH, FSH, TSH
cortisol and prolactin. If GHRH is given, samples are drawn at the same
time points for GH.
Interpretation: normal values as follows:
TRH:
Suspect secondary hypothyroidism if peak response (at
20min) <20mU/L (Note: low levels also seen in
hyperthyroidismensure free T4 or total T4 not raised).
ACTH:
Peak cortisol response >550nmol/L at 30 or 60min.
LHRH:
Peak LH/FSH response 25  basal value.
LH:
Peak at 20min, FSH later.
GHRH:
Normal GH peak response >15mU/L.

Water deprivation test
Indication: diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI) and to distinguish cranial
and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Contraindications: none if carefully supervised. For correct interpretation, thyroid and adrenal deficiency should be replaced first.
Interpretation in the presence of diabetes mellitus and uraemia can be
difficult.
Alternatives: morning urine osmolality of >600mOsmol excludes
significant degrees of DI. No other definitive test for diabetes insipidus.
Patient preparation: usually an outpatient procedure. Correct thyroid and
adrenal insufficiency in advance. Renal function and blood glucose should
have been checked in advance. Steroid and thyroid hormone replacement
should be taken as normal on the day of the test. If the patient is on
DDAVP, omit the dose on the evening before the test (or if not possible,
halve this dose). Free fluids, but not too excess, up to 0730h on the day of
the test. No alcohol on the night before the test or in the morning of the
test. Light breakfast but no tea, coffee or smoking on the morning of the
test. Empty bladder before attending for the test.
If urine volume is <3L/day (mild cases), ask patient to have no fluids or
food from 1800h on the evening before the test (prolonged water deprivation test).
Requirements for test: accurate weighing scales. Supervision for the
whole test (up to 8h). DDAVP for injection (2g). Immediate access to

159

serum electrolyte, plasma and urinary osmolality assays. Access to a
plasma AVP (ADH) assay desirable.
Procedure: 0730h
1. Weigh patient and calculate 97% of body weight.
2. Mark this target on the chart.
3. No food or fluid for next 8h.
4. Insert cannula for repeated blood sampling and flush.
0800h
5. Obtain plasma for Na+ and osmolality and urine for osmolality.
6. Then collect urine hourly for volume and osmolality and plasma every
2h for Na+ and osmolarity.
7. Weigh patient before and after passing water if unobserved.
8. If patient loses 3% body weight, order urgent plasma osmolality and
Na+.
9. If plasma osmolality >300mOsmol (Na+ >140mmol/L) stop test, allow
patient to drink and give DDAVP (see below).
10.If plasma osmolality <300mOsmol, patient may have been fluid overloaded before test and water deprivation can continue.
11.Stop test at 8h (4pm) and take final recordings of urine and plasma.
12.Save an aliquot of plasma for vaspressin levels in case of difficulties in
test interpretation.
13.Ideally urine osmolalities will have reached a plateau (<30mOsmol rise
between samples).
14.Now give 2g DDAVP IM (or 20g intranasally) and collect urine
samples only for a further 2h. Allow free fluids at this stage.
Interpretation: normal response: plasma osmolality remains in the range
280295mmol, urine osmolality rises to >2  plasma (>600mOsmol). If
urine volumes during water deprivation do not reduce and yet the
160 plasma does not become more concentrated (rising osmolality) and
weight does not fall, suspect surreptitious drinking during test. For
interpretation of abnormal results see table (p107).

Diagnostic trial of DDAVP
Indication: distinction of partial diabetes insipidus from primary
polydipsia.
Contraindications: cardiac failure. Current diuretic use (test
uninterpretable). Note that this test may precipitate severe
hyponatraemia in primary polydipsia and should be preformed in an
inpatient unit with clinical and biochemical regular review.
Preparation: admission to assessment unit. First line tests for
polydipsia/polyuria should have been performed (see text).
Procedure:
1. 24h urine volume, morning urine osmolality, weight, fluid intake (as far
as possible), serum osmolality, Na+, urea and creatinine should all be
performed daily and the results reviewed the same day.
2. Subjects should have access to fluid ad libitum but should be reminded
that they should only drink if they are thirsty.
3. After an initial 24h period of observation, desmopressin (DDAVP) is
administered at a dose of 2mg bd SC for 3 days.

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
4. Stop test if serum Na+ falls to <130mmol/L.
Interpretation: reduction in urine volume to <2L/day, 4 in urine
osmolality to >600mOsmol/L without fall in serum Na+ to
<140mmol/L suggests central diabetes insipidus. Reduction in urine
volume with no increase in urine osmolality >600mOsmol/L and
without a fall in serum Na+ suggests partial nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus. Limited reduction in urine volume, with some increase in
urine osmolarity but a fall in serum Na+ suggests primary polydipsia.

Low dose dexamethasone suppression
test
Indication: to distinguish hypercortisolism from normality. The
dexamethasone suppressed CRH test is believed to have less false
positives in cases of alcholic or depressive pseudo-Cushings syndrome.
Patient preparation: patients should not be on oral steroids or drugs
that increase steroid metabolism.
Overnight dexamethasone suppression test: 1mg dexamethasone is
taken PO at midnight. Serum sample for cortisol is taken the following
morning between 0800 and 0900h.
Interpretation: serum cortisol should suppress to <140nmol/L (usually
<50nmol/L). Values 140175nmol/L are equivocal and suggest a 2-day 161
test should be performed. 1015% false +ve rate.
2-day low dose dexamethasone suppression test (preferred):
dexamethasone 0.5mg is given PO every 6h for 8 doses (2 days) starting
in the early morning. Ideally tablets are taken strictly at 6-hourly
intervals (0600, 1200, 1800, 0000h) which may necessitate an inpatient
stay. A 24h collection for urine free cortisol is taken on the second day
of the test and serum cortisol is measured at 0600h on the 3rd day, 6h
after the last dose. IV administration of dexamethasone can be used if
there are concerns over absorption or compliance.
Interpretation: serum cortisol 6h after the last dose should be
<140nmol/L, usually <50nmol/L. Urinary free cortisol on the second
day should be <70nmol/L, normally <30nmol/L. The 2-day test strictly
performed has less false +ves than the overnight test.
Dexamethasone suppressed CRH test: dexamethasone 0.5mg is given PO
every 6h for 8 doses (2 days) but starting at midnight and ending at
0600h. Tablets are taken strictly at 6-hourly intervals (0000, 0600,
1200, 1800h) which may necessitate an inpatient stay. Last dose is taken
at 0600h and an injection of CRH (100g IV or 1g/kg) is given at
0800h. A blood sample for cortisol is taken at 0815h (i.e. 15min later).
Interpretation: serum cortisol level should be <38nmol/L (normal).
Yanovski JA, Cutler GB, Chrousos G et al. (1993. Corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation
following low-dose dexamethasone administration: a new test to distinguish Cushings syndrome
from pseudo-Cushings states. JAMA 269, 22322238.

High dose dexamethasone suppression
test
Indication: to distinguish between patients with Cushings disease
(ACTH-secreting pituitary tumour) and ectopic ACTH production in
patients with established hypercortisolism.
Patient preparation: as low dose test except that the test can be
performed immediately following the 2-day low dose test.
Procedure:
1. 2  24h urine free cortisol collections are made to calculate the mean
basal 24h urine free cortisol.
2. Baseline serum cortisol measurement is also taken before the first dexamethasone dose, ideally at 0600h. If the low dose test is performed
first, the baseline values (urine and blood) must be taken prior to the
low dose test (i.e. any doses of dexamethasone).
3. Dexamethasone 2mg is given PO every 6h for 8 doses (2 days) starting
in the early morning. Ideally tablets are taken strictly at 6-hourly intervals (0600, 1200, 1800, 0000h) which may necessitate an inpatient stay.
4. A 24h urine collection for urinary free cortisol (final) is taken on day 2
and a blood sample is taken for (final) cortisol 6h after the last dexamethasone dose (0600h on day 3). Creatinine excretion should be
measured and compared between urine samples to confirm true 24h
collections.
Interpretation: % suppression of basal cortisol is calculated as:
(basal cortisolfinal cortisol)/basal cortisol  100.

162 The same calculation is made for basal and day 2 urine free cortisol.
50% suppression is suggestive of pituitary-dependent disease. 90%
suppression increases the likelihood (strict criteria). Thymic carcinoids
and phaechromocytomas releasing ACTH are source of false positives.

Short synacthen test
Indication: suspected adrenal insufficiency. Will not detect recent-onset
secondary adrenal insufficiency.
Contraindication: asthma/allergy to ACTHrisk of allergic reaction (can
be performed with careful medication supervision of patient).
Preparation: patient must not take hydrocortisone on the morning of
the test as this will be detected in the cortisol assay. The test can be
performed on low dose dexamethasone but the morning dose should
be omitted until after the test. May have some value in patients on
higher dose steroid therapy to indicate the degree of suppression of
adrenocortical function.
Procedure: 250g of synthetic ACTH (synacthen) given IM or IV. Blood
taken at times 0, 30 and 60min for serum cortisol. A value at any time
>550nmol/L makes the diagnosis very unlikely.

2 Endocrinology & metabolism
Low dose test: the test can be performed with a very low dose of ACTH
(e.g. 1g). This may detect more subtle degrees of hypoadrenalism but
the clinical significance of these findings remains uncertain.

Long (depot) ACTH test
Indication: distinguishing 1 and 2 adrenal failure.
Patient preparation: a short synacthen test should be performed prior
to the test to diagnose adrenal failure. If patient is on steroid
replacement, change to dexamethasone 0.5mg/day.
Procedure: blood is taken at 0900h for basal cortisol. 1mg of depot
synthetic ACTH (synacthen) is then given IM on 2 consecutive days and
blood collected 5h after each dose (1400h). A final cortisol sample is
taken at 0900h on the 3rd day.
Interpretation: serum cortisol should rise to >1000nmol/L on the last
day and, if adrenal failure previously indicated by a short synacthen test,
such a rise indicates secondary adrenal failure (pituitary/hypothalamic
cause inc. suppressive drugs).

Full blood count (FBC)
Called complete blood count (CBC) in the USA.
Before the advent of modern haematology blood analysers the blood
count consisted of a Hb concentration (estimated using a manual colorimetric technique), a white cell count and manual platelet count. Other
parameters such as MCV had to be mathematically calculated (derived)
using the measured variables Hb, RCC and PCV.
Modern analysers use a variety of methods to provide a huge range of FBC
variables including electronic impedance, laser light scatter, light
absorbance and staining characteristics. The resultant FBC provides measured variables such as Hb, PCV and RCC along with derived (mathematically) MCV, MCH and MCHC. These machines also provide automated
platelet counts and a 5-part differential WBC.
Sample: peripheral blood EDTA; the sample should be analysed in the
laboratory within 4h, if possible.
Main parameters measured
1. Hb concentration.
2. Red cell count (RCC).
3. MCV.
4. MCH.
5. MCHC.
6. Haematocrit (Hct) or PCV.
7. Red cell distribution width (RDW).
8. White cell count.
9. WBC differential.
166 10.Platelet count.
Some machines are even more sophisticated and will measure reticulocyte
counts in addition to determination of reticulocyte Hb and MCV.
Role of the FBC
Why ask for a FBC? How will this aid the diagnosis or management of the
patient? The FBC assesses several different parameters and can provide a
great deal of information. The red cell variables will determine whether or
not the patient is anaemic. If anaemia is present the MCV is likely to
provide clues as to the cause of the anaemia. The white cells are often
raised in infectionneutrophilia in bacterial infections and lymphocytosis
in viral (but not always so). Platelets (size or number) may be abnormal
either as a direct effect of underlying blood disease or may simply reflect
the presence of some other underlying pathology. Most of us take a somewhat cursory glance at the FBC when the report arrives on the ward or in
clinic, but a more detailed look may reveal a great deal more!

FBC parameters
Haemoglobin concentration (Hb)
Units: g/dL or g/L (Europe uses SI units; the USA still uses g/dL or
grams%).

hence adult 9 has higher Hb, PCV and RCC than adult 3.
Red cell count (RCC)
Unit:  1012/L.
Most clinicians pay little attention to the red cell count but this parameter
is useful in the diagnosis of polycythaemic disorders and thalassaemias (the
latter results in the increased production of red cells that are smaller than
usual and contain low quantities of haemoglobin, i.e. are microcytic and
hypochromic).
Causes of a low red cell count include
2 Hypoproliferative anaemias, e.g. iron, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies.
2 Aplasias e.g. idiopathic or drug-induced (dont forget chemotherapy).
2 Parvovirus B19 infection-induced red cell aplasia resulting in transient
marked anaemia.

Haematocrit or PCV
These are not entirely synonymous terms (but they are, more-or-less). If
blood is placed in a microcapillary tube and centrifuged the red cells are
spun down to the bottom, leaving the plasma above. The RBCs will
occupy about 40% of the blood in the tubethe blood will have a PCV of
0.4 (or 40%). The Hct is similar, but derived, using automated blood counters.
PCV unit: litres/litre (although the units are seldom cited on reports).
High PCV
2 Polycythaemia (any cause).
Low PCV
2 Anaemia (any cause).
Red cell distribution width (RDW)
Measures the range of red cell size in a sample of blood, providing infor168 mation about the degree of red cell anisocytosis, i.e. how much variation
there is between the size of the red cells. Of value in some anaemias:
e.g. 5 MCV with normal RDW suggests  thalassaemia trait.
5 MCV with high RDW suggests iron deficiency.
(Probably noticed more by haematology staff than those in general medicine!)

White cells
The automated differential white cell count is provided as part of the FBC.
The red cells in the sample are lysed before the white cells are counted. A
typical FBC will show the total white cell count and the 5-part differential
white cell count, broken down into the 5 main white cell subtypes in peripheral blood which include:
2 Neutrophils.
2 Lymphocytes.
2 Monocytes.
2 Eosinophils.
2 Basophils.

3 Haematology
Normal ranges are provided inside front cover.
The printed FBC usually shows the % of each type of white cell but unless
the absolute WBC (as  109/L) is known this % count is of little value.
iAs a general rule ignore the % countyou cannot detect abnormalities
such as neutropenia unless you have the absolute values.
Abnormalities of the WBC, e.g. neutrophilia, neutropenia, etc. are
discussed in OHCM p632.

Platelet count
Unit:  109/L.
Normal: 150400  109/L.
Platelets (thrombocytes in the USA) are the smallest cells in the peripheral
blood. Traditional counting methods using a microscope and counting
chamber have been replaced by automated counting on most standard
haematology analysers.
Platelet distribution width (PDW)
This is analogous to the red cell distribution width (RDW) and provides 169
information about the range of platelet size in a blood sample.
2

2

The PDW will be high if there are giant platelets in the presence of
normal sized platelets, e.g. essential thrombocythaemia (one of the
myeloproliferative disorders).
The PDW will be normal in a reactive thrombocytosis (where the
platelet count is increased but they are all of normal size).

Platelet clumping
This is seen as an in vitro artefact in some individuals. Platelets clump in
EDTA and the blood analyser will report spurious thrombocytopenia. The
actual in vivo count is entirely normal, and the platelets function perfectly
normally. Taking the blood into a citrate or heparin tube will usually show
the patients platelet count to be normal. The presence of even a small
blood clot in an EDTA sample may also reduce the platelet count (the
haematology technical staff will usually check to see whether the sample
contains a small clot before sending out the report).

Peripheral blood film
Examining a stained peripheral blood smear under the microscope allows
the examination of red cells, white cells, and platelets. In addition the

04OHCI-03(165-240)

8/16/02

Page 170

blood film will help detect parasites (e.g. malaria, trypanosomes) or
abnormal cells in the blood.
When to request a blood film examination
The Haematology lab will usually examine a peripheral blood film if the
patients indices are abnormal (unless there has been no major change
from previous FBCs). If you suspect an underlying blood disorder you
should request a film. Note: The lab staff may not make a film if the indices
are completely normal.
Method
A fingerprick blood sample may be spread onto a glass slide (the phlebotomists may do this for you), air-dried, fixed and stained. Alternatively,
a drop of EDTA blood may be treated in the same manner (the haematology lab staff will make the film). Beware: old EDTA samples produce
strange artefacts such as extreme red cell crenationfor this reason, if a
film is required it should be made from a fresh blood sample.
Sample: EDTA (as fresh as possible).

should be roughly the size of a small lymphocyte nucleus. Many disease
and deficiency disorders alter the RBC appearance by either reducing its
haemoglobin content, or altering the membrane such that characteristic
morphological abnormalities are produced. Examples include target cells,
sickle cells, bite cells, burr cells and many others (see table opposite). Most
of the morphological features are not absolutely specific for one particular
disorder, but rather they suggest a range of conditions which may be associated with the RBC feature. This should prompt you to look for conditions which might account for the abnormality.
iPay attention to the peripheral blood film comment (inserted on the
report by the haematology lab staff, or automated blood counter)it
should help you decide which tests to carry out next. Conversely, cryptic
lab comments like anisopoikilocytosis noted do not help the clinician
much. (Note: aniso = unequal, poikilo = varied.)

White blood cell morphology
In much the same was as RBC morphology provides clues about underlying disease, so too does microscopical examination of stained peripheral
blood WBCs. Modern counters enumerate WBCs and our greater
reliance on modern technology means that visual inspection of blood films
is becoming a dying art. A well-stained blood film may provide the diagnosis much more cheaply.

2 Underlying leukaemiaare there any leukaemic blasts* present?

How old is the patient?
2 Viral illnesses often produce bizarre films in children but beware of
complacency (acute leukaemia may be the cause).
2 MDS and malignancies like CLL and CML are diseases of older individuals.
Is the patient well?
2 May be worth repeating FBC and film to see if abnormalities have
resolved.
2 If patient unwell or has lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly then
underlying disease must be excluded.

Assessment of iron status
Introduction
The anaemia of iron deficiency is caused by defective synthesis of haemoglobin resulting in red cells that are smaller than normal (microcytic) and
contain reduced amounts of haemoglobin (hypochromic). The diagnosis of
iron deficiency anaemia is generally straightforward but it may be confused
with that due to the anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) or other
hypochromic anaemias (see table, p179).

3 Haematology
Iron plays a pivotal role in many metabolic processes and the average
adult contains between 3 and 5g of iron of which two-thirds are present in
the O2-carrying molecule, haemoglobin. Somewhat surprisingly, there is
no specific excretion mechanism in humans. Iron balance is controlled at
the level of gut absorption, and relies on two iron-sequestering proteins,
transferrin (iron transport and recycling of iron) and ferritin (safeguards iron
entry into the body, and maintains surplus iron in a safe and readily accessible form).
Ferritin
This is the primary iron-storage protein consisting of 24 apoferritin
subunits forming a hollow sphere (each can hold up to 4500 Fe
atoms).
Haemosiderin
Haemosiderin, located predominantly in macrophages, is a water-soluble
proteiniron complex with an amorphous structure.
Transferrin and its receptor
Transferrin contains only 4mg iron and is the principal iron transport
protein with more than 30mg iron transported round the body
daily. Synthesis of transferrin is inversely proportional to the body iron
stores, with increased transferrin concentration when iron stores are
reduced.
The transferrin receptor (TfR) is a disulphide-linked dimer composed of
two identical 85kDa subunits. The serum TFR concentration is elevated in
iron deficiency. However, sTfR may also increase in any condition in which 177
there is increased erythropoiesis, e.g. haemolytic anaemias, thalassaemia,
polycythaemia vera and other myeloproliferative disorders.
Assessment of iron status
Several parameters are available
2 Haemoglobin concentration.
2 Serum ferritin.
2 Serum iron and transferrin (as total iron binding capacity, TIBC ).
2 % hypochromic cells in peripheral blood.
2 Red cell protoporphyrin assay (not widely available).
2 Bone marrow aspirate (stained for iron)the gold standard.
2 Soluble transferrin receptor assay (sTfR).
Remember, iron deficiency is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon. In progressive deficiency there is a gradual loss of iron with subtle alterations of
iron-related parameters during which the red cells may look entirely
normal. In the initial stages of developing iron deficiency macrophages
become depleted of iron and the serum ferritin 5 to the lower end of the
normal range; during this latency period the Hb is normal. As the deficiency progresses plasma iron levels 5 and TIBC 4. Free RBC protoporphyrin levels 4 as it accumulates, and eventually hypochromic RBCs
appear in the peripheral blood. At this stage a full blood count will usually

show 5 Hb, MCV, MCH and MCHC, and the peripheral blood film will
show microcytic hypochromic red cells.
Confirmation of simple iron deficiency anaemia
2 Hb 5.
2 Serum ferritin will be 5.
Beware: serum ferritin is an acute phase protein and may be normal or
even 4 in inflammatory, malignant or liver disease. During the inflammatory response the iron/TIBC are unlikely to be of any value (iron 5
and TIBC will be 5). If an inflammatory process is suspected, an alternative test is required, e.g. sTfR, which is not affected by inflammatory
disorders.

Assessment of B12 & folate status
Measurement of the serum B12 and red cell folate levels is necessary in the
investigation of macrocytic anaemia and certain other situations (see
below). Serum folate levels are an unreliable measurement of body stores
of folatethe red cell folate level is probably more meaningful.
B12 unit: ng/L.
Serum & red cell folate units: g/L.
Sample: clotted blood sample (serum B12 and folate) and peripheral
blood EDTA (red cell folate).
Deficiency of either vitamin leads to megaloblastic anaemia where there is
disruption of cell division in all actively dividing cells (includes the bone
marrow and gut). In the marrow there is nuclear : cytoplasmic asynchrony
where the nuclei are immature despite a mature well-haemoglobinised
cytoplasm. In the peripheral blood there may be anaemia, often with pancytopenia; the red cells show oval macrocytic changes with basophilic stippling and occasionally nucleated red cells. Neutrophils typically become
hypersegmented (they have >5 lobes).
Until recently, B12 and folate assays were tedious microbiological assays
but these have now been replaced by automated techniques using
radioisotopic methods which allow large numbers of samples to be
batched and tested fairly cheaply.
Deficiency of B12 or folate do not always cause macrocytic
anaemia
In the past, deficiency of B12 or folate were synonymous with macrocytic
180 anaemia but deficiency of either vitamin may present without anaemia or
macrocytosisremember, these are late features of the disease.
However, in most cases of deficiency the marrow will show characteristic
megaloblastic change (nuclear asynchrony with giant metamyelocytes).
iDeficiency of B12 may cause neurological problems in the absence of anaemia.
Whom should you test?
2 Patients with GIT disease, glossitis, abnormalities of taste, previous
surgery or radiotherapy to stomach or small bowel.
2 Neurological disease, e.g. peripheral neuropathy, demyelination.
2 Psychiatric disturbance, e.g. confusion, dementia.
2 Malnutrition, e.g. growth impairment in children; vegans.
2 Alcohol abuse.
2 Autoimmune disease of thyroid, parathyroid or adrenals.
2 Patients with family history of pernicious anaemia.
2 Others, e.g. drugs that interfere with vitamin absorption or metabolism
such as nitrous oxide, phenytoin, etc.
Look for blood film abnormalities
iB12 & folate deficiencies produce similar clinical and laboratory features.
2 Oval macrocytes.
2 Hypersegmented neutrophils (also seen in renal failure, iron deficiency
and MDS).
Which test next?

patient will require treatment.
Detecting tissue deficiency
The most reliable method is probably the measurement of serum homocysteine (accumulates in vitamin B12 and folate deficiency).

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
This simple but very useful qualitative test measures how fast a patients
red cells fall through a column of blood. It is a sensitive but non-specific
182 index of plasma protein changes which result from inflammation or tissue
damage. The ESR is affected by haematocrit variations, red cell abnormalities (e.g. poikilocytosis, sickle cells) and delay in analysis, and is therefore
less reliable than measurement of the plasma viscosity. The ESR is affected
by age, sex, menstrual cycle, pregnancy and drugs (e.g. OCP, steroids).
The ESR is widely used in clinical medicine and despite attempts (by
haematology departments) to replace the ESR with the plasma viscosity
the ESR has remained in use and appears to retain a valuable place in the
armoury of disease diagnosis and monitoring.

Plasma viscosity
This test is a sensitive but non-specific index of plasma protein changes 183
which result from inflammation or tissue damage. Provides much the same
information as the ESR. The ESR and PV tend to rise in parallel but the PV
is unaffected by haematocrit variations (e.g. severe anaemia or polycythaemia) and delay in analysis up to 24h, and is therefore more reliable
than the ESR. It is not affected by sex but is affected by age, exercise and
pregnancy. It is constant in health and shows no diurnal variation. There is
a suggestion that the PV may be a more sensitive indicator of disease
severity than the ESR.
Sample: peripheral blood EDTA. The sample is centrifuged and the
plasma removed.
Normal range: 1.501.72CP (or MPA/s at 25C).
High and low plasma viscosity
High PV generally signifies some underlying pathology; low PV can be
ignored.
Note: Despite the advantages outlined the PV has not been adopted by all
medical staff (who still prefer the ESR as a measure of inflammation). The
PV is better for monitoring hyperviscosity syndromes, e.g. Waldenstrms
macroglobulinaemia.

Tests for glandular fever
This infection is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Infected cells produce
so-called heterophile antibodies (these are IgM molecules that agglutinate
horse and sheep RBCs but do not agglutinate ox RBCs and do not react at
all with guinea-pig RBCs).
There are various kits available that can detect the presence of heterophile antibodies and in the right clinical context will confirm a diagnosis
of EBV infection. The Monospot test is probably the commonest in
current use. The Paul-Bunnell test was the first to demonstrate the presence of heterophile antibodies in patients with EBV infection.
Clinical features
Glandular fever often affects young adults (1225 years) and results in
malaise, fever, tonsillitis, petechial haemorrhages on palate and lymphadenopathy. Splenomegaly is fairly common. A similar clinical picture is
seen in CMV, Toxoplasma and early HIV infections.

Investigation of haemolytic anaemia
The normal red cell has a lifespan of ~120 days. Anaemia resulting from 5
RBC lifespan is termed haemolytic. May be inherited or acquired and the
basic underlying mechanisms may involve abnormalities of the RBC membrane, RBC enzymes or haemoglobin.
Extravascular vs. intravascular
Extravascular haemolysis implies RBC breakdown by the RES (e.g. liver,
spleen, and macrophages at other sites) while intravascular haemolysis
describes RBC breakdown in the circulation itself. There are many investigations available which will help determine the predominant site of
destruction, which in turn will help define the underlying cause of haemolysis, which is why we do the tests in the first place.
Detection of haemolysis itself
The main question is whether the patients anaemia is due to haemolysis
or some other underlying mechanism such as blood loss, marrow infiltration, etc.

Reticulocytes
These are immature RBCS formed in the marrow and found in small
numbers in normal peripheral blood. They represent an intermediate maturation stage in marrow between the nucleated RBC and the mature RBC
(the reticulocyte lacks a nucleus but retains some nucleic acid). Measuring
the number of reticulocytes in the blood may help determine whether the
anaemia is due to 5 RBC production. The reticulocyte count is also a
useful measure of response to haematinic (iron, B12 or folate) replacement
therapy.

Serum haptoglobins
Haptoglobins (HP) are plasma proteins synthesised by the liver, whose
function is the removal of free plasma haemoglobin. Hp molecules bind

free Hb and are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system for degradation. HpHb complexes do not appear in the urine because their large size
prevents them passing through the renal tubules.
The HpHb complex is cleared by the reticuloendothelial system at a rate
of 15mg/100mL/h which means that even very mild haemolysis will cause
the disappearance of Hp from the circulation. The serum haptoglobin
should be measured in patients with suspected intravascular haemolysis.
However, the Hp level is frequently reduced in patients with extravascular
haemolysis, and the Hp level cannot be used to determine whether the
basic haemolytic process is intra- or extravascular. It should generally be
accompanied by estimation of the serum methaemalbumin, free plasma
haemoglobin and urinary haemosiderin.
Sample: clotted blood.
Normal range: (expressed as Hb binding capacity in mg/dL):
30250mg/dL.

Serum bilirubin
Two forms are found: prehepatic bilirubin (unconjugated) and bilirubin
conjugated to glucuronic acid (conjugated). Generally serum bilirubin
levels are 1750mol/L in haemolysis (mainly unconjugated). Beware:
serum bilirubin levels may be normal even if haemolysis is present; a level
>85mol/L suggests liver disease.

3 Haematology
The serum bilirubin may be modestly 4 (e.g. 2030mol/L) in dyserythropoietic disorders such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency or myelodysplasia, due to ineffective erythropoiesis where the RBCs are destroyed in
the marrow before ever being released into the circulation.

Urobilin & urobilinogen
Urobilinogen is the reduced form of urobilin, formed by bacterial action
on bile pigments in the GI tract. Faecal and urinary urobilinogen 4 in
haemolytic anaemias.

Urinary haemosiderin
Usage
The most widely used and reliable test for detection of chronic intravascular haemolysis. Results from the presence of Hb in the glomerular filtrate.
Principle
Free Hb is released into the plasma during intravascular haemolysis. The
haemoglobin binding proteins become saturated resulting in passage of
haem-containing compounds into the urinary tract of which haemosiderin
189
is the most readily detectable.
Method
1. A clean catch sample of urine is obtained from the patient.
2. Sample is spun down in a cytocentrifuge to obtain a cytospin preparation of urothelial cells.
3. Staining and rinsing with Perls reagent (Prussian blue) is performed on
the glass slides.
4. Examine under oil-immersion lens of microscope.
5. Haemosiderin stains as blue dots within urothelial cells.
6. Ignore all excess stain, staining outside cells or in debris, all of which
are common.
7. True +ve only when clear detection within urothelial squames is seen.
Cautions
An iron-staining +ve control sample should be run alongside test case to
ensure stain has worked satisfactorily. Haemosiderinuria may not be
detected for up to 72h after the initial onset of intravascular haemolysis so
the test may miss haemolysis of very recent onsetrepeat test in 37
days if ve. Conversely, haemosiderinuria may persist for some time after
a haemolytic process has stopped. Repeat in 7 days should confirm.

Plasma haemoglobin
In health, haemoglobin is contained within RBCs but during intravascular
haemolysis excessive quantities of Hb may be released from ruptured
RBCs. Normally haptoglobins mop up free Hb. If there are insufficient haptoglobins to cope with the free Hb, the kidneys clear the Hb leading to
190 haemoglobinuria. Some Hb may be broken down in the circulation to
haem and globin; haem can bind to albumin producing methaemalbumin
(7methaemalbuminaemia).
iThe finding of free Hb in plasma is highly suggestive of intravascular
haemolysis.

sending sample).

Red cell membrane disorders

Hereditary spherocytosis
Hereditary elliptocytosis

Red cell enzyme disorders

G6PD deficiency

Haemoglobin disorders

Sickle cell anaemia
Thalassaemia

Pyruvate kinase deficiency

Red cell membrane disorders
Hereditary spherocytosis
This is the best known inherited membrane abnormality leading to a
reduced red cell lifespan and sometimes severe anaemia. Inheritance is
usually autosomal dominant, and there is often a positive family history.
Osmotic fragility test
Principle of the test
The test measures the ability of red cells to take up water before rupturing (lysing). This is determined by the volume : surface area ratio.
Normal red cells can 4 their volume by up to 70% before lysing (because
they are disc shaped, and have the capacity to take in extra water easily).
Spherocytic red cells have an 4 volume : surface area ratio and are able to
take up less water than normal red cells before lysing (they are spheres
and as such they are full already).
Sample: EDTA (need normal control sample sent at the same time).

RBCs are incubated in saline at various concentrations. This results in
cell expansion and eventually rupture.
Normal RBCs can withstand greater volume increases than spherocytic
RBCs.
A positive result (confirming HS) seen when RBCs lyse in saline at near
to isotonic concentration, i.e. 0.60.8g/dL (normal RBCs will simply
show swelling with little lysis).
Osmotic fragility is more marked in patients who have not undergone
splenectomy, and if the RBCs are incubated at 37C for 24h before
performing the test.

test in conjunction with a history, blood film and family studies (HS is
inherited as an autosomal dominant, so one of the parents and some
siblings should be affected).

Red cell enzyme assays
Numerous red cell enzymes are responsible for maintaining the integrity
of the RBC in order to allow it to function efficiently in O2 delivery and
CO2 removal. RBC enzyme defects lead to shortened RBC survival (i.e.
haemolysis) and anaemia. Although there are numerous enzymopathies
that may cause haemolysis, the most useful starting assays are for G6PD
and pyruvate kinase.
Of course, one should start by taking a detailed history from the patient,
asking about previous haemolytic episodes, family history, ethnic origin
and possible drug toxicities.
Sample: fresh EDTA or heparin. The enzymes are stable for 6 days at
4C and 24h at 25C.
Methods: these are too numerous and complex to list here.
Essentially there are 3 methods for analysis of G6PD
2 Brilliant cresyl blue decolorisation test.
2 Methaemoglobin reduction test.
2 UV spot test.

Page 194

Normal range: varies between laboratories (check with your local lab).
Pitfalls: during a haemolytic episode in patients with G6PD deficiency
the oldest RBCs are destroyed first. Younger RBCs (and especially
reticulocytes) have higher levels of the enzyme than older cells. It follows
therefore that if the enzyme level is assayed during an acute episode the
G6PD level obtained may be falsely normal. This will rise further as
reticulocytes pour into the peripheral blood, as happens during recovery
from the acute attack. It is better to wait until the acute attack is over
and the patient is in steady-state.

Haemoglobin abnormalities
There are 2 main classes of haemoglobin abnormalities.
Abnormality

Example

Structural Hb variants

Sickle haemoglobin, HbD, HbE

Imbalanced globin production

Thalassaemias (, , etc.)

Structural haemoglobin variants
If the amino acid change results in an electrical charge difference, this may
be detected by protein electrophoresis (separates proteins on the basis of
charge). Investigation requires full clinical history, FBC, blood film and Hb
electrophoresis.
Thalassaemias
 thalassaemia is diagnosed from the blood indices, blood film, HbA2 and
194 HbF levels. For  thalassaemia the investigation is more complex requiring
DNA analysis to detect  globin deletions. Globin chain synthesis, which
examines the ratio of  :  globin production, is performed less with the
advent of DNA-based methods.

Haemoglobin analysis
Haemoglobin electrophoresis
Electrophoresis is an electrical method for separating molecules on the
basis of size (for DNA fragments) or overall electrical charge (for proteins). Hb electrophoresis allows the separation of different Hbs providing
they have differing charges (Hb molecules with the same charge will move
together on the gel and cannot be distinguished). The methods used take
advantage of the fact that amino acid side chains on the globin molecules
can be ionised. The net overall charge of a protein depends on the pH of

the solution it is in and the pKs of the amino acids (the pK is the pH at
which half the side chains are ionised).
Electrophoretic methods used
2 Cellulose acetate (at pH 8.6).
2 Citrate agar (at pH 6.0).
2 Isoelectric focusing (IEF ).
2 High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC ).
Due to space limitations each of these methods will be discussed only
briefly. Other texts deal with this topic in considerable detail.
Sample: peripheral blood EDTA.
Cellulose acetate
This test is commonly performed in the diagnosis of abnormal haemoglobin production (haemoglobinopathies or thalassaemia). Because some
Hbs have the same net charge they will run together, e.g. HbS will run in
the same band as HbD and HbG, and HbC will run with HbE. To resolve
these bands electrophoresis is next carried out at acid pH.
Citrate agar
This is similar to cellulose acetate where Hbs are separated at an acid pH
(pH 6.0) to separate out Hbs that run together at alkaline pH.
Isoelectric focusing
This is a high resolution method for separating different Hb molecules.
The basic principle of the test relies on the fact that all proteins and amino
acids have a pH at which their net charge is zero. This is termed the iso- 195
electric point. At this pH there is no net movement in the presence of an
externally applied electric field. The Hb molecules are subjected to a pH
gradient. This method has the advantage of high resolution but is more
expensive than standard electrophoresis.
High-performance liquid chromatography
This chromatographic technique has been around for 20 years or more,
and is being increasingly used for analysis of haemoglobin molecules.
Haemoglobins are passed through a matrix column and eluted from the
column at varying times, during which their absorbance is measured.
Detection of standard haemoglobin variants is simple; the advantage of
HPLC is that novel haemoglobin variants can also be detected, and HPLC
can separate proteins that cannot be resolved using other means. HPLC is
more expensive than all the techniques mentioned above.
When should you request these tests?
Haemoglobin analysis is usually carried out:
2 When the MCV is 55 but Hb normal or slightly 5.
2 In patients from ethnic groups known to be associated with high levels
of haemoglobin disorder, e.g. sickle or thalassaemia.

197

Sickle solubility test
Sickle Hb is the result of a point mutation in the  globin gene resulting in
a glu7val switch at position 6 of the  globin protein. Sickle haemoglobin
(HbS) forms long filaments (tactoids) reducing its solubility when O2
tension is reduced. This forms the basis of the sickle solubility test.
Sample: any anticoagulant.
The patients blood is mixed with sodium dithionite solution and left to
stand. A positive sickle sample should be used as a control. When the
tubes are examined a clear solution implies that there is no sickle Hb; a
turbid solution confirms the presence of sickle Hb in the patients sample.
i A positive result will be obtained for sickle carriers (HbAS) and sickle
cell homozygotes (HbSS). If a positive result is obtained Hb electrophoresis must be carried out to determine whether the patient is a
carrier or has homozygous sickle cell anaemia.

Molecular diagnosis of sickle cell disease
This is useful for prenatal diagnosis. The  globin genes of the fetus are
amplified using PCR (cells are obtained by amniocentesis or CVS) and
digested with a bacterial restriction enzyme, e.g. Mst II. If the sickle mutation is present no digestion will occur (the mutation removes the restriction site).
Neonatal haemoglobin screening
2 Obtain blood from neonate (e.g. heel prick) in babies at risk of sickle
or  thalassaemia major (e.g. mother has gene for HbS, C, DPunjab, E,
OArab,  or  thalassaemia).
2 Universal neonatal screening is generally used in areas where there is a
high incidence of haemoglobinopathy.

Estimation of haemoglobin A2 (a2d2)
Normal adults have 3 types of haemoglobin: HbA, HbA2 and HbF. HbA
(22) is the major Hb and HbA2 is a minor adult haemoglobin, which is
very useful for the diagnosis of  thalassaemia trait. HbA2 levels are 4 in
the heterozygote (carrier state) and is a specific test for this genotype. The
test is carried out using a column chromatography method.

Estimation of fetal haemoglobin (HbF)
HbF makes up >50% of the total Hb at birth but decreases to ~5% by 5
months of age (as  chain production is replaced by  chains). HbF levels
may be raised in some haemoglobinopathies.
Sample: EDTA.

2 Sickle/+ thalassaemia (some cases).
2 Sickle/0 thalassaemia (some cases).
2 Juvenile chronic myeloid leukaemia.
2 Multiple myeloma (uncommon and never measured).
2 Acquired aplastic anaemia.

Haemoglobin H bodies (b4)
HbH, consisting of a tetramer of  globins (4), is found in  thalassaemia.
The  chains form tetramers due to the relative lack of  globins with
which to pair. The demonstration of HbH allows the detection of  thalassaemia trait (either   /   or  /) and HbH disease (  /  ).
Method
The HbH body test involves staining RBCs with brilliant cresyl blue; HbH
bodies are seen as large dark inclusions in the red cells.

Sample: fresh EDTA.
i Note: The presence of HbH confirms  thalassaemia but the absence of
HbH bodies does not exclude the diagnosis.

Heinz bodies
These are red cell inclusions made up of insoluble denatured globin
protein. Heinz bodies are seen when the RBCs are stained with methyl
violet stain.
Sample: fresh EDTA.
Interpretation: Heinz bodies are seen close to the RBC membrane.
These are normally removed by the spleen and are therefore more
frequent following splenectomy.
Causes of Heinz bodies
2 Oxidative haemolysis:
 Chlorates, phenacetin, other drugs.
 G6PD, PK deficiencies and other enzymopathies.
2 Unstable haemoglobins.
Sevitt S et al. (1973) Acute Heinz-body anaemia in burned patients. Lancet 2, 471475.

Testing for unstable haemoglobins
Globin gene mutations may lead to amino acid substitutions that render

200 the haemoglobin molecule unstable, leading to haemolysis. Most muta-

tions causing unstable Hb are autosomal dominant and >80% affect the 
chain. Affected individuals are heterozygotes. Heinz bodies in RBCs are
intracellular Hb precipitates. Unstable Hbs can be detected electrophoretically or using the heat precipitation test, in which lysed RBCs
are heated to 50C for 1h.
Sample: fresh EDTA.
Interpretation: normal fresh haemolysates should be stable for 1h at
50C. If there is an unstable Hb a precipitate will be seen in the tube.
Examples
2 Hb Kln.
2 Hb Gun Hill.

Molecular tests for diagnosis
of thalassaemia
Although most haematology labs can diagnose  thalassaemia trait and 
thalassaemia major, there are occasions when molecular tests are

04OHCI-03(165-240)

8/16/02

10:24 AM

Page 201

3 Haematology
required, e.g. antenatal diagnosis where a couple are at risk of having a
child with  thalassaemia major or hydrops fetalis (absence of  globin,
usually lethal). In addition, the diagnosis of  thalassaemia is difficult and
requires DNA analysis either using Southern blotting or PCR amplification
of globin genes.
b thalassaemia
There are >100  globin mutations now known but fortunately each population tends to have its own group of mutations (this avoids having to test
for all known mutations). It is important that you include the ethnic group
on the request form since this will assist the lab who will then screen for
mutations commonly found in the ethnic group of the patient. Details of
these mutations can be found in the beta and delta thalassemia repository.
Methods used for molecular diagnosis of b thalassaemia
The methods used are complex and outwith the scope of this small book
(see references below).
How the ARMS PCR technique works
2 This is amplification refractory mutation system PCR .
2 Specific point mutations are known for the  globin mutations.
2 PCR primers are designed to bind with the mutated sequence.
2 If the patient has the mutation there will be PCR amplification.
2 If the patient lacks the mutation there is no binding of the primers to
the patients DNA, and no amplification.
2 So, a band on the gel means the mutation is present (and the reverse is
trueif the band is absent then that particular mutation is absent).
Other techniques including reverse dot blots and DNA sequencing are
sometimes needed if ARMS PCR fails.
Methods used for molecular diagnosis of a thalassaemia
Whereas  thalassaemia is usually the result of point mutations (single
base changes), the  thalassaemias are usually the result of deletions of
chunks of DNA in the region of the  globin genes. Southern blotting is
useful in detecting deletions since the DNA band sizes after digestion with
restriction enzymes will differ to the wild type (i.e. normal).
UK Haemoglobinopathy Reference Laboratory
This is based at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (UK). Difficult cases
(e.g.  thalassaemia) can be sent to this lab (after discussing the case first);
they will perform  globin gene analysis and send a detailed report containing the genotype of the patient. See end of chapter for contact details
( p238).

Acquired haemolytic anaemias
Determining the cause of haemolytic anaemia can be a complex process.
Having excluded inherited disorders of haemoglobin, RBC membrane or
enzymes we are left with a diverse group of disorders with a common
phenotype of increased RBC destruction (and 5 RBC lifespan).
Immune
2 Autoimmune (primary, or 2 to SLE or CLL ).
2 Alloimmune (e.g. transfusion reactions, haemolytic disease of the
newborn).
2 Antibody can be warm (IgG) or cold (IgM usually).
RBC damage
2 Drugs.
2 Poisons.
2 Burns.
RBC fragmentation syndromes
2 DIC .
2 TTP/HUS .
2 March haemoglobinuria.
Investigations
There is little point investigating the cause of haemolytic anaemia until you
have shown that haemolysis is actually occurring.
Look for the acquired cause
2 FBC and peripheral film:
 Spherocytes (suggests warm antibody; also present in HS).
 4 WBC, e.g. might suggest underlying lymphoproliferative disorder
202
such as CLL.
 RBC fragments (suggests physical damage to the RBC, e.g. MAHA,
TTP/HUS, burns, March haemoglobinuria, mechanical heart valves).
 Parasites, e.g. malaria.
 Infections, e.g. Clostridium, Bartonella, Babesia.
2 Antiglobulin test (DAT ):
 IgG or IgG + complement (C3d) on RBC.
 DAT is usually +ve in immune-mediated haemolysis.
2 Renal function (abnormal in TTP/HUS ).
2 Coagulation screen (DIC with RBC fragmentation).
2 LFT s (abnormal in Zieves syndrome).
2 USS for splenomegaly.
2 Cold agglutinins:
 IgM, usually against I or i proteins, RBC membrane proteins.
2 Hams test or immunophenotype if suspect PNH .

Hams acid lysis test
This is a test for the rare acquired red cell membrane disorder called
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) which relies on the
exquisite sensitivity of red cells to lysis by normal plasma constituents. Its
pathophysiology is complex and involves an abnormality of the red cell

membrane in PNH making it prone to complement-mediated lysis and
episodes of marked intravascular haemolysis leading to free haemoglobin
in the urine (haemoglobinuria).
Principle
2 Abnormal sensitivity of RBC s from patients with PNH to the
haemolytic action of complement.
2 Complement is activated by acidification of the patients serum to pH
of 6.2 which induces lysis of PNH red cells but not normal controls.
Sample: EDTA, heparin, citrate, oxalate.
Result: +ve result indicates PNH.
Specificity: highsimilar reaction is produced only in the rare
syndrome HEMPAS (a form of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type
II) which should be easily distinguished morphologically.
Sensitivity: lowas the reaction is crucially dependent on the
concentration of magnesium in the serum.
Beware: may be +ve in the rare congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia
(CDA) type II also called HEMPAS (hereditary erythroblast
multinuclearity with positive acidified serum).

Alternative tests
2 Sucrose lysisan alternative method of complement activation is by
mixing serum with a low ionic strength solution such as sucrose.
Sensitivity of this test is high but specificity is lowi.e. the opposite of
the Hams test.
2 Immunophenotypic detection of the deficiency of the PIG transmembrane protein anchors in PNH cells is becoming a more widely used
alternative. Monoclonal antibodies to CD59 or CD55 (DAF) are used
in flow cytometric analysis. The major advantage is that the test can be
performed on peripheral blood neutrophils and platelets which are
more numerous than the PNH red cells.

Bleeding time
This is a test of primary haemostasis, and mainly of platelet function in vivo,
rather than a laboratory test. You will generally need to arrange this test
through the haematology department who will carry out the test for you.
Procedure
A disposable spring-loaded blade is used to make 2 incisions of fixed
depth into the skin of the forearm whilst a sphygmomanometer is inflated
to 40mmHg. Blood from the incisions is mopped up using circular filter
paper (care needs to be taken to avoid disturbing the clot which forms on
the cut surface).
Normal range: up to 7min (varies depending on method used; >9min is
abnormal). Longer in 3.
Uses: best screen for acquired or congenital functional or structural

204 platelet disorders. If bleeding time normal and history is negative (i.e. no
major bleeding problems in past) this excludes an underlying platelet
disorder.
Precautions
iDont carry out bleeding time if platelet count is <100  109/L (will be
prolonged). Aspirin will interfere with testask patients to stop aspirin 7
days before test carried out.
Causes of prolonged bleeding time
2 Low platelet count.
2 Platelet function defect (acquired, e.g. aspirin, paraprotein, MDS ).
2 von Willebrands disease.
2 Vascular abnormalities, e.g. Ehlers-Danlos.
2 Occasionally low factor V or XI.
2 Afibrinogenaemia.

coagulation deficiencies, liver disease and DIC. The PT is also the main
monitor for coumarin therapy (e.g. warfarin), expressed as a ratiothe
international normalized ratio (INR). The test measures the clotting time of
plasma in the presence of a tissue extract, e.g. brain (thromboplastin). The

This is a test of the intrinsic coagulation system, and depends on contact
factors + factors VIII, IX and reactions with factors X, V, II and I. The APTT
is sensitive to circulating anticoagulants (e.g. lupus anticoagulant) and
heparin.
Sample: citrate.
Uses

Is there an inhibitor present?
The APTT will be long if there is an inhibitor such as the lupus anticoagulant present This can be determined by mixing the patients plasma with an
equal volume of normal control plasma and repeating the APTT. If the
APTT is long because of an inhibitor it will not fully correct when normal
plasma is added. However, if the APTT is long because of a deficiency it
will correct with the normal plasma.

D-dimers
D-dimers are produced during polymerisation of fibrinogen as it forms
fibrin. Measurement of D-dimer levels is more specific for this process
than the older FDP (fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products) test and is 207
now being used to detect the presence of DIC and other coagulation disorders. The test measures fibrin lysis by plasmin and is a sensitive indicator
of coagulation activation (e.g. such as that seen in DIC). The assay uses a
monoclonal antibody specific for D-dimers; it will not cross-react with fibrinogen or fibrin.

venepuncture sites, post-operatively and spontaneously. Diagnosis
requires FBC, clotting screen and evidence of rapid consumption of fibrinogen. Classic (acute) DIC, where the test results fit the bill, is easy to

Platelet function tests
These are specialised tests carried out by the coagulation laboratory for
the investigation of patients with suspected platelet dysfunction. Because
of their complexity, the platelet function tests will not be described in
detail here.
Patients generally present with bleeding or bruising problems and have
had normal coagulation results. Because of the labour-intensive nature
and cost of these assays you will need to arrange these tests after discussion with your local haematology medical staff.
Sample: blood collection needs to be optimal with non-traumatic
venepuncture, rapid transport to the lab with storage at room
temperature and testing within a maximum of 23h.
Current tests
2 Platelet count.
2 Morphology.
2 Adhesion.
2 Aggregation.
2 Platelet release.
2 Bleeding time.

Platelet count
Normal range 150400  109/L. Adequate function is maintained even
when the count is <0.5 normal level, but progressively deteriorates as it
drops. With platelet counts <20  109/L there is usually easy bruising and
petechial haemorrhages (although more serious bleeding can occur).
Morphology
Large platelets are biochemically more active; 4 mean platelet volume
(MPV >6.5) is associated with less bleeding in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Altered platelet size is seen in inherited platelet disorders.
Platelet adhesion
Adhesion to glass beads now rarely performed in routine lab practice, but
potentially useful in vWD diagnosis.
Platelet aggregation
Most useful of the special tests is performed on fresh sample using aggregometer.
Aggregants used
2 Adenosine 5-diphosphate (ADP ) at low and high concentrations.
Induces 2 aggregation waves: primary wave may disaggregate at low
concentrations of ADP; the second is irreversible.
2 Collagen has a short lag phase followed by a single wave and is particularly affected by aspirin.
2 Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA ) is carried out at a high
(1.2mg/mL) and lower concentrations and is mainly used to diagnose
vWD.
2 Arachidonic acid.
2 Adrenaline (epinephrine), not uncommonly reduced in normal people.

210

Platelet release
ELISA or RIA are used to measure the granule proteins -thromboglobulin
(-TG) and heparin neutralising activity (HNA). These are sensitive
markers of platelet hyper-reactivity and beyond the scope of the routine
laboratory.
Practical application of tests
Their main role is in diagnosis of inherited platelet functional defects. In
acquired platelet dysfunction secondary to causes such as renal and
hepatic disease, DIC and macroglobulinaemia, platelet function is rarely
tested.

Thrombophilia screening
Thrombophilia describes acquired or inherited disorders that predispose
to arterial or venous thromboembolism (VTE). Thrombophilia should be
suspected when the blood clot affects an unusual site, the patient is young,
has recurrent thrombotic episodes, or has a strong family history of VTE.

Which patients should be screened for possible thrombophilia?
2 Arterial thrombosis, e.g. patients <30 years, without obvious arterial
disease.
2 Venous thrombosis:
 Patients <40 years with no obvious risk factors.
 Unexplained recurrent thrombosis.
 VTE and family history of thrombosis in first degree relatives.
 Unusual site, e.g. mesenteric, portal vein thrombosis.
 Unexplained neonatal thrombosis.
 Recurrent miscarriage (3).
 VTE in pregnancy and the OCP.
Screen
2 Exclude medical causes (check ESR , LFT s, AIP , fasting lipids).
2 FBC (exclude thrombocytosis).
2 Clotting screen for acquired defects (PT , APTT , LA/ACL , 4 fibrinogen).
2 Screen for inherited thrombophilia:
 First line PC, PS, AT, APCR.
 Check for presence of the factor V Leiden mutation in APCR +ve
patients (DNA analysis).
 Consider testing plasminogen, factor XII, homocysteine levels, prothrombin variant.
2 DNA analysis for prothrombin gene mutation.
Thrombophilia investigations are time-consuming and expensive and you
should discuss with the local haematology medical or lab staff before
sending samples. Note: Some thrombophilia tests cannot be carried out in 211
the acute phase of a VTE event or while the patient is taking warfarin.

Bone marrow examination
This is a key investigation in haematology. It may be diagnostic in the
follow-up of abnormal peripheral blood findings, and is an important
staging procedure in defining the extent of disease, e.g. lymphomas. It is a
helpful investigative procedure in unexplained anaemia, splenomegaly or
selected cases of pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO).
Preferred sites: posterior iliac crest is the usual site (allows aspirate
and biopsy to be obtained). The sternum is suitable only for marrow
aspiration.
The marrow aspirate provides
2 Cytology of nucleated cells.
2 Qualitative and semiqualitative analysis of haematopoiesis.
2 Assessment of iron stores (if Perls iron stain used).
2 Smears for cytochemistry (helps in the diagnosis of leukaemias).
Marrow cells can also be used for
2 Chromosomal (cytogenetic) analysis.
2 Immunophenotype studies using monoclonal antibodies.
Marrow trephine biopsy provides information about
2 Marrow cellularity.
2 Identification and classification of abnormal cells.
2 Immunohistochemistry on infiltrates.

Contraindications
None, other than physical limitations, e.g. pain or restricted mobility.
Avoid sites of previous radiotherapy (inevitably grossly hypocellular and
not representative).
Procedure
1. BM aspiration may be performed under LA alone, but short acting IV
sedative (e.g. midazolam) is preferred when trephine biopsy is performed. GA used in children.
2.Place patient in (L) lateral position, or use right if he cannot lie on left
side.
3.Infiltrate skin and periosteum over the posterior iliac spine with local
anaesthetic.
4.Make a small cutaneous incision before introducing the aspirating
needle, which should penetrate the marrow cortex 310mm before
removal of the trocar.
5.Aspirate no more than 0.51mL marrow initially (to avoid dilution of
sample with blood).
6.Make smears promptly (it will clot rapidly!).
7.If further samples are needed, e.g. for immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, etc. these can be aspirated after making initial slides.
8.For trephine biopsy use Islam or Jamshidi needle.
9.Advance the needle through the same puncture site to penetrate the
cortex.
10.Remove the trocar and, using firm hand pressure, rotate the needle
clockwise and advance as far as possible.
11.Remove the needle by gentle anticlockwise rotation.
12.Following the procedure apply simple pressure dressings.
213
13.Minor discomfort at the location may be dealt with by simple analgesia
such as paracetamol.

Cytochemistry tests (leukaemias)
These staining methods have been around for many years (for decades
they were all that was available), but remain extremely useful in the diagnosis and classification of leukaemias. Modern technologies such as flow
cytometry and nucleic acid analysis have refined leukaemia and lymphoma
diagnosis but the examination of well-stained cytochemistry bone marrow
smears remain the cornerstone of good haematology practice.

214

After performing a bone marrow aspirate and spreading the material onto
glass slides, the air-dried unfixed microscope slides are passed to the cytochemistry lab who will fix and stain the slides according to the likely diagnosis (stains for AML differ to those for ALL, for example). Positive results
with particular stains will point to a specific diagnosis. This will then be
augmented by flow cytometric or molecular assays.

Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase
Uses
This is a cytochemical stain used to demonstrate the presence and quantity of the neutrophil enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Historically the NAP
score was of value in differentiating reactive states from myeloproliferative disorders, such as CML, polycythaemia rubra vera, etc.now more
often features in examination MCQs! (Note: sometimes termed leucocyte
alkaline phosphatase, LAP.)
Procedure
Best performed on fresh blood films, made without the use of anticoagulant. EDTA samples may be used but are less satisfactory. The film should
be made, air dried, fixed and then stainedall within 30min. Positive NAP
activity is indicated by the presence of bright blue granules in the neutrophil cytoplasm (the nucleus is stained red).
Scoring: films are scored from 0 to 4 on the basis of stain intensity:
0
negative, no granules seen
1
weak positive, few granules
2
positive, fewmoderate numbers of granules
3
strongly positive
4

simpler tests such as ESR for assessment of disease activity. Occasionally
of value in a patient with aplastic anaemia who is developing PNHthe
NAP score is seen to fall (both of these are very rare disorders). NAP
score has been replaced in most hospitals by flow cytometry and other
methods.

Blood transfusion
Due to space limitations it is inappropriate to go into major details about
the investigations used in transfusion medicine. However, we have provided the more important tests in current use which include:
2 Blood group & antibody screen.
2 Cross-match (compatibility test).
2 Direct antiglobulin test (DAT ).
2 Antiplatelet and antineutrophil antibody testing.

Safe transfusion practice
Each year patients are transfused with the wrong blood. The commonest
error is clerical and generally involves the cross-match sample being taken
from the wrong patient and so the compatibility test is performed on the
wrong sample. Occasionally the staff carrying out the transfusion connect
the blood up to the wrong patient. In any event, the result varies from no
symptoms to shock and possible death.
How to minimise errors
2 First, ask yourself: does this patient really need to be transfused with
blood or blood products (e.g. FFP, platelets, etc.)? For example, a postoperative patient who is asymptomatic with a Hb of 9g/dL probably
does not require red cell transfusion. Use clinical judgement in helping
decide whether or not to proceed with transfusion.
2 Before taking the blood sample check that you are taking blood from
the correct patientask for his/her name and check the identity
bracelet.
2 Label the patients blood bottle at the bedside (i.e. no prelabelling of
bottles:
 Many transfusion labs insist on 1, 2, 5, 6 & 7 and either 3 or 4 from:

217

1. Surname & forename (correctly spelt)
2. DOB
3. Hospital/A&E/new NHS number
4. First line of address
5. Sex
6. Time and date blood taken
7. Signature of person taking blood
2
2

Ensure details on form match those on the bottle.
Complete the request form properly:
 State what is required (e.g. 2 units of packed cells, etc.).
 Detail any previous transfusions, reactions, antibodies (if known).
 Let the lab know when you want the blood or blood product.

ii Sticky patient labels are fine for forms but are not suitable for specimen bottles, and are usually not accepted by transfusion labs. Transfusion
specimens should be labelled by handat the bedside.

If this sounds cumbersome and bureaucratic:
Remember many people die annually because they are transfused with
the wrong blood. In most cases clerical error is to blamepeople have
filled out bottles in advance and failed to check patient identity.

218

Transfusion reactions
Rapid temperature spike (>40C) at start of transfusion indicates transfusion should be stopped (suggests acute intravascular haemolysis).
If slow rising temperature (<40C), providing patient not acutely unwell,
slow IVI. Fever often due to antibodies against WBCs (or to cytokines in
platelet packs).

ii Immediate transfusion reaction
Intravascular haemolysis (7haemoglobinaemia & haemoglobinuria).
Usually due to anti-A or anti-B antibodies (in ABO mismatched transfusion). Symptoms occur in minutes/hours. May be fatal.

Background
If a Rhesus (D)-negative mother has a baby that is Rh (D) +ve she may
develop antibodies (maternal anti-D) against fetal red cells. This may result
in fetal red cell destruction termed Rhesus haemolytic disease of the
newborn, a serious haemolytic disorder which is seen less today due to
greater understanding of the underlying mechanism and our ability to
prevent it. Sensitisation to the fetal red cells occurs when fetal RBCs enter
the maternal circulation, e.g. at birth or through obstetric manipulations,
e.g. amniocentesis, previous pregnancies, etc.
Fetal RBCs in the mothers circulation can be detected and quantified (in
mL) using the Kleihauer test, which exploits the resistance of fetal red cells
to acid elution (acid washes adult Hb out of the mothers red cells but the
fetal RBCs contain HbF which is not washed out). The Kleihauer test
should be performed on all RH (D) ve women who deliver a RH (D) +ve
infant.
Fetal cells appear as darkly staining cells against a background of ghosts
(these are the maternal red cells). An estimate of the required dose of
anti-D can be made from the number of fetal cells in a low power field.
Sample: maternal peripheral blood EDTA.
Calculating the volume of fetal RBCs in the maternal circulation
Basically, a calculation is made by the laboratory staff based on the
number of fetal RBCs seen in the Kleihauer film. The actual calculation is:
1800*  ratio of fetaladult RBCs  4 3 (correction factor)

222

for example, if there are 1% fetal RBCs in maternal circulation
1800  1100  4 3 = 24mL
*1800 is the maternal red cell volume

A 4mL bleed (i.e. 4mL fetal RBCs) requires 500IU anti-D given IM to the
mother with a further 250IU anti-D for each additional mL of fetal RBCs.
Dont panic!
The lab carrying out the Kleihauer test will tell you the volume of fetal
RBCs detected since they will count the cells and do the calculation for
you. After this you will need to calculate the dose of anti-D to give the
mother but if you are unsure either discuss with the haematology medical staff
or contact your local transfusion centre and they will help you with the
dosing. Most obstetric units will have anti-D protocols which should be
available on the ward.

Erythropoietin assay
Erythropoietin (Epo) is the hormone produced largely by the kidney that
drives red cell production. The typical anaemia found in renal disease is a
result of failure of Epo production. Epo assays are of value in renal medicine and haematology. For example, in the assessment of polycythaemic
states an 4 Epo level may be appropriate (e.g. in hypoxia where the body
is attempting to increase O2 availability to tissues) or inappropriate (e.g.
some tumours). The Epo assay is carried out using a radioimmunoassay
method and is not available in all haematology laboratories (may need to
be sent to another hospital or lab).
Normal range: 3525mu/mL, steady state level, no anaemia. May rise
to 10,000mu/mL in hypoxia or anaemia.
Causes of 4 Epo (appropriate)
2 Anaemias.
2 High altitude.
2 Hypoxia:
 Lung disease.
 Sleep apnoea syndromes.
2 Cyanotic heart disease (e.g. R7L shunts).

Immunohaematology
Immunohaematology is the study of the effects of the immune system on
the blood and its components. This includes red cells, white cells, platelets
and coagulation proteins.
Tests for antiplatelet and antineutrophil antibodies
These tests are usually requested by the haematology department for
patients with either thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, respectively.
These assays are used to detect the presence of specific antibodies against
platelet or neutrophil antigens on the cell surface.
Antibodies may be alloantibodies (e.g. antibody produced by the mother
against fetal antigens) or autoantibodies, which are antibodies produced
by the patient against his/her own antigens.
Antiplatelet antibody tests
Generally platelet immunofluorescence tests (PIFT) or monoclonal antibody immobilisation of platelet antigens (MAIPA) are used. These are
useful for detecting even weak antibodies or where there are only a few
antigenic sites per cell.

Disorders with neutrophil-specific alloantibodies

Primary autoimmune neutropenia.
Secondary:
 SLE.
 Evans syndrome (AIHA + 5platelets).
 Lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g. CLL).
 Immune dysfunction (e.g. HIV, GvHD).

Elegant though these tests are, they are actually not useful in clinical practice for the diagnosis of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia where the
cause is autoimmune since these are largely clinical diagnoses (plateletassociated IgG or IgM may be high in autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
However, it may also be high in non-immune causes of thrombocytopenia). Where these tests are of value is in the neonatal setting where
the neonate has low platelets or neutrophils.

Uses
2 Diagnosis and classification of leukaemias and lymphomas.
2 Assessment of cellular DNA content and synthetic activity.
2 Determination of lymphocyte subsets, e.g. CD4 + T cells in HIV infection.
2 Assessment of clonality.
2 Allows identification of prognostic groups.
2 Monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD, the lowest level of
malignancy that can be detected using standard techniques).
Terminology and methodology
Cell surface proteins are denoted according to their cluster differentiation
(CD) number. Most cells will express many different proteins and the
pattern of expression allows cellular characterisation. Monoclonal antibodies recognise specific target antigens on cells. Using a panel of different
antibodies an immunophenotypic profile of a sample is determined.
Immunophenotyping is used in conjunction with standard morphological
analysis of blood and marrow cells. The antibodies are labelled with fluorescent markers and binding to cell proteins is detected by laser. For each
analysis thousands of cells are assessed individually and rapidly. Some antibodies can detect antigens inside cells.
Sample: heparin
Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs)
These are so-called because they are derived from single B lymphocyte
cell lines and have identical antigen binding domains (idiotypes). It is easy
225
to generate large quantities of MoAbs for diagnostic use.

Cell populations from e.g. PB or BM samples are incubated with a
panel of MoAbs, e.g. anti-CD4, anti-CD34 which are directly or indirectly bound to a fluorescent marker antibody.
Sample is passed through a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)
machine.
FACS instruments assign cells to a graphical plot by virtue of cell size
and granularity detected as forward and side light scatter by the
laser.
Allows subpopulations of cells, e.g. mononuclear cells, in blood sample
to be selected.
The reactivity of this cell subpopulation to the MoAb panel can then
be determined by fluorescence for each MoAb.
A typical result for a CD4 T lymphocyte population is shown:

Cytogenetics
Uses
2 The study of chromosomes.
2 Looks at the number of chromosomes in each cell.
2 Detects structural abnormalities between chromosome pairs.
Chromosome abnormalities may be constitutional (inherited) or acquired
later in life. Cytogenetic analysis of chromosome structure and number
has been used for many years for the study of disorders such as Downs
syndrome. Acquired chromosomal abnormalities are found in malignancies, especially haematological tumours. The analysis and detection of
cytogenetic abnormalities is known as karyotyping. Because of the complexity of this subject area we will concentrate on two main areas where
chromosome analysis is of value.
2

Prenatal diagnosis of inherited disorders:
 Detection of common aneuploidies (gain or loss of chromosomes).
 Detection/exclusion of known familial chromosome abnormalities.

Detecting acquired chromosome abnormalities for:
 Diagnosis of leukaemia subtypes, e.g. t(15;17) characteristic of AML
M3 subtype.
 Markers of prognostic information in a variety of diseases such as
leukaemias, e.g. t(9;22), in acute leukaemias, N-myc amplification in
neuroblastoma.
 Monitoring response to treatment (in CML the Philadelphia chromosome, t(9;22), should disappear if the malignant cells are killed).

Principal indications for cytogenetic analysis are therefore
2 Haematological malignancies at diagnosis (assuming the bone marrow
is infiltrated).
2 Infiltrated solid tumour tissue at diagnosis.
2 Patients with equivocal morphology (e.g. type of leukaemia not clear
using microscopy and other markers).
2 FISH analysis when required in certain treatment protocols, e.g. MRC .
2 Confirmation of disease relapse.
2 Accelerated phase or blast crisis in CML .
Cytogenetic assays are expensive (around 250 for a leukaemia or lymphoma karyotype) and if there is any doubt as to whether the test is indicated we would suggest you discuss the case with one of your seniors or
the cytogenetics staff. Arranging karyotyping before or during pregnancy is
generally carried out by the obstetrician in charge of the womans care.

Chromosome anatomy
Two chromosomes are shown. Note the banding pattern which helps
identify individual chromosomes, along with position of the centromeres
(mitotic spindle attaches to these during cell division), short (p) and long
(q) arms, and telomeres (chromosome ends).

Cytogenetics: prenatal diagnosis
This allows both the detection of genetic diseases associated with specific
chromosomal abnormalities, thereby offering the possible prevention of
an affected child. With the advent of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the
first trimester, karyotyping can be done at an early stage of development.
Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis allows abnormalities to be detected
even before implantation has occurred.
Sample: amniotic fluid (1516 weeks gestation).
Tests available
2 -fetoprotein level.
2 Chromosome analysis.
2 Biochemical tests, e.g. acetylcholinesterase.
Sample: CVS (912 weeks gestation).
Tests available
2 DNA analysis.
2 Chromosome analysis.
2 Biochemistry tests.
Procedure (brief)
1. Cells are obtained using amniocentesis, CVS or fetal blood sampling.
228 2.
Cells are cultured in medium.
3. Cell division is arrested at metaphase using e.g. colchicine.
4. Chromosomes are spread onto slides and stained.
5. Chromosomes are examined directly using light microscopy or with
the aid of a computerised image analysis system.

create characteristic banding patterns along the chromosome. The
regions and bands are numbered, e.g. p1, q3, etc.
Common abnormalities
2 Whole chromosome gain, e.g. trisomy 8 (+8).
2 Whole chromosome loss, e.g. monosomy 7 (7).
2 Partial gain, e.g. add9q+, or partial loss, e.g. del5q .
2 Translocationmaterial exchanged with another chromosome; usually
reciprocal, e.g. t(9;22)the Philadelphia translocation.
2 Inversionpart of chromosome runs in opposite direction, e.g. inv(16)
in M4Eo.
2 Many translocations involve breakpoints around known oncogenes, e.g.
bcr, ras, myc, bcl-2.
Molecular cytogenetics
2 Molecular revolution is further refining the specific abnormalities in the
genesis of haematological malignancies.
2 Techniques such as FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridisation) and PCR
(polymerase chain reaction) can detect cryptic abnormalities.
230 2 Bcr-abl probes are now used in diagnosis and monitoring of treatment
response in CML.
2 IgH and T cell receptor (TCR ) genes are useful in determining clonality
of suspected B and T cell tumours, respectively.
2 Specific probes may be used in diagnosis and monitoring of subtypes of
acute leukaemia, e.g. AML, e.g. PML-RARA in AML M3, t(9;22), t(12;21),
and 11q23 rearrangements in paediatric acute lymphoblastic
leukaemias.

Uses
Tissue typing patients (to ensure compatibility between donor and
recipient) who are undergoing transplantation to reduce the likelihood of
rejection or graft-versus-host disease in the following types of transplant:
2 Heart.
2 Lung.
2 Liver.
2 Kidney.
2 Bone marrow.
2 Stem cells.

The gene complex is subdivided into 2 regions
Class 1
The A, B and C loci.
These proteins are found on most nucleated cells and interact
with CD8+ T lymphocytes.
Class 2
Comprised of DR, DP, DQ loci present only on B lymphocytes,
monocytes, macrophages and activated T lymphocytes.
Interact with CD4+ T lymphocytes.
2

2
2

Class 1 and 2 genes are closely linked so one set of gene loci is usually
inherited from each parent though there is a small amount of crossover.
There is ~25% chance of 2 siblings being HLA identical.
There are other histocompatibility loci apart from the HLA system but
these appear less important generally except during HLA matched
stem cell transplantation when even differences in these minor systems
may cause GvHD.

Typing methods
Class 1 and 2 antigens were originally defined by serological reactivity with
maternal antisera containing pregnancy-induced HLA antibodies. There
are many problems with the technique and it is too insensitive to detect
many polymorphisms. Molecular techniques are increasingly employed
such as SSP. Molecular characterisation is detecting vast class 2
polymorphism.
Importance of HLA typing
2 Matching donor/recipient pairs for renal, cardiac and marrow stem cell
transplantation.
2 Degree of matching more critical for stem cell than solid organ transplants.
2 Sibling HLA -matched stem cell transplantation is now treatment of
232
choice for many malignancies.
2 Unrelated donor stem cell transplants are increasingly performed but
outcome is poorer due to HLA disparity. As molecular matching
advances, improved accuracy will enable closer matches to be found
and results should improve.
Functional tests of donor/recipient compatibility
2 MLC (mixed lymphocyte culture)now rarely used.
2 CTL P (cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor assays)determine the frequency of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the donor directed against the
recipient. Provides an assessment of GvHD occurring.
HLA-related transfusion issues
2 HLA on WBC and platelets may cause immunisation in recipients of
2
2
2

blood and platelet transfusions.
May cause refractoriness and/or febrile reactions to platelet transfusions.
Leucodepletion of products by filtration prevents this (the National
Blood Service removes the WBCs at source routinely nowadays).
Diagnosis of refractoriness confirmed by detection of HLA or plateletspecific antibodies in patients serum.

Southern blotting
This technique has been around since the mid-1970s. It explained much
about the physical structure of genes and was a major advance in the diagnosis of many single gene disorders. The method is simple and elegant, but
time-consuming. Not used as much today with the advent of PCR technology. Southern blotting relies on the physical nature of DNA whereby
single strands are able to recognise and bind to their complementary
sequences (Fig. 3.21).
Sample: EDTA sample (heparin can be used but beware inhibitory effect
on PCR amplification; if any chance PCR required, send EDTA).
Procedure
1. Genomic (i.e. total) DNA is extracted from WBC in EDTA blood
sample.
2. DNA is digested with bacterial restriction endonucleases (enzymes
cleave DNA at specific sequenceseach enzyme recognizes a different
DNA sequence).
3. After digestion of the DNA, the fragments are separated on the basis
of size using agarose gel electrophoresis (smallest fragments travel the
farthest).
4. The fragments are transferred to a nylon membrane and fixed perma- 233
nently to the membrane using UV light.
5. Membranes are probed using specific (known) gene probes that are
radioactively labelled using 32P.
6. The location of specific binding is detected by placing the membrane
next to radiographic film (standard x-ray film).
7. The film is developed using standard techniques and the autoradiograph generated will show bands corresponding to the position of
binding of the labelled probe.
8. Fragment sizes are calculated and the presence or absence of mutations are worked out by determining whether enzyme cutting sites
have been lost through mutation.
Applications
2 Historically many diseases caused by single base changes (loss of
restriction enzyme cutting site) have been diagnosed using Southern
blotting.
2 Globin gene disorders:
 Sickle cell anaemia (mutation in  globin gene).
 Thalassaemia (mutations or deletions in  or  globin genes).

PCR amplification of DNA
The ability to use an enzyme to amplify specific DNA sequences has revolutionised modern diagnostic pathology. Whereas Southern blotting might
take up to 1 week to produce a result, PCR can do the same thing in 23h!
PCR is now in routine use in the analysis of oncogenes, haematological
malignancies, general medicine, infectious disease and many other specialties. Because the system amplifies the starting DNA up to a million-fold
there need only be one cell as starting material; in practice much more
DNA is required but because of the extreme sensitivity of the technique
PCR has been used in forensic medicine where there may be only a few
cells available for analysis (e.g. blood or semen stain).

3 Haematology
Advantages
2 Requires very little DNA .
2 DNA quality does not matter (can be highly degraded, e.g. with age
and still be amplifiedDNA from Egyptian mummies has been amplified).
2 Rapid results.
Disadvantages
2 Expensive, but less so than it used to be.
2 DNA sequence of the gene of interest must be known in order to
design the short PCR primers (oligos). With the near completion of
the Human Genome Project this is less of a problem now.
2 Highly sensitive, and contamination of samples may occur (DNA fragments float through the air constantly; if these drop into the reaction
tube a false +ve result may be obtained).
Procedure (in brief)
2 Two short DNA primers on either side of the gene of interest bind to
the fragment of interest.
2 The region between the primers is filled in using a heat-stable DNA
polymerase (Taq polymerase).
2 After a single round of amplification has been performed the whole
process is repeated.
2 This takes place 30 times (i.e. through 30 cycles of amplification)
leading to a million-fold increase in the amount of specific sequence.
2 After the 30 cycles are complete a sample of the PCR reaction is run
on agarose gel and bands are visualised.
2 Information about the presence or absence of the region or mutation
of interest is obtained by assessing the size and number of different
PCR products obtained after 30 cycles of amplification.
Applications
2 PCR is currently used to amplify immunoglobulin genes, HIV loci,
tuberculosis genes and many other targets that are of use in molecular
medicine (cystic fibrosis, haemophilia, thalassaemia, sickle cell disease
and many others).
2 PCR can be used to quantitate m RNA species in blood samples and
tissue samples. Allows gene activity to be measured.

In situ hybridisation & FISH
Like PCR and other techniques, in situ hybridisation and FISH are conceptually simple techniques that rely on the ability of a DNA probe to find
its counterpart on a chromosome, bind, and if a fluorescent tag is present

it will light up the region of binding (this modification is termed fluorescence in situ hybridisation, or FISH). These techniques have evolved from
standard cytogenetic analysis of metaphase chromosomes in which
metaphase chromosomes were prepared on glass slides to which specific
labelled probes were applied.
Sample: discuss with your local cytogenetics or haematology lab (they
will have specialised medium for maintaining cells from blood or marrow
so that they will divide and be suitable for hybridisation studies).
In situ hybridisation
The location of binding of the probe is detected by visualising the signal
produced after coating microscope slides with photographic emulsion,
which generate a black area around the probe which is labelled with 32P.
FISH

A further modification based on the original principles, whereby specific
gene probes are hybridised to chromosomes without the need for
metaphase preparations (interphase cells can be used). Instead of 32P the
probes are labelled with fluorescent dye and hybridisation may be
detected as red, blue or other coloured dots over the cells.
Applications of FISH
2 Used in the analysis of trisomies (chromosome gains) and monosomies
(chromosome losses) associated with leukaemias and lymphomas. The
presence of trisomy is detected as three fluorescent dots within the
cell whilst monosomy is seen as a single fluorescent dot within the cell.
2 FISH has been used widely within paediatric leukaemias, such as ALL ,
where abnormalities of chromosome number are common.

Autoimmunity and complement
Introduction
Tissue damage associated with autoimmune activation can be termed
organ specific if tissue damage is confined to individual organs or nonorgan specific if there is multi-organ involvement. Although associated
disease mechanisms involve both the humoral and cellular immune mechanisms, humoral autoimmunity is the best characterised with regard to
investigations, and laboratory tests are based upon:
2
2
2

The detection or quantification of autoantibodies, typically IgG antibodies.
The measurement of complement components.
The detection of changes in concentration of non-specific inflammatory
markers.

What the relationship is between these antibodies and the disease mechanism is usually debatable and only in a few instances, e.g. antiglomerular
basement membrane antibody, is there direct pathological involvement
between the antibody and the disease. In most instances, e.g. rheumatoid
factors, the presence of antibodies should be seen as good diagnostic
markers of the likelihood of the disease being present.

Detection of autoantibodies
Autoantibodies are detected by immunochemical techniques. Test
samples are reacted with target antigens in representative tissue or as
purified or recombinant preparations. Common techniques used are
immunofluorescence, particle agglutination, immunodiffusion, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, ELISA and
related assays and radioimmunoassays.
Endocrine disease
Gastric parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies
Autoimmune gastritis (type A) and pernicious anaemia (PA) are associated
with antibodies to gastric parietal cells (GPC) in intrinsic factor (specificity
90%). GPC may also be found (40%) in other organ-specific autoimmune
diseases, e.g. autoimmune thyroid disease, and may also be present in
elderly patients without autoimmune disease (1015%).
Antigen on parietal cell subunit of H+ and K+-ATPase. Intrinsic factor
antigen 70kDa glycoprotein secreted by parietal cells of gastric mucosa.
Intrinsic factor antibodies may be type 1, a blocking antibody (in 70% with
PA), or type 2, a binding antibody (in ~35% PA).
Antibodies associated with diabetes mellitus
There are many autoantibodies associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus
(type 1 DM). Their clinical application is limited but they may have a use in
predicting disease in relatives of patients with type 1 DM. Positive
response to 2 or more of the following markers is associated with a high
incidence of onset of type 1 DM within 57 years.
Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody
GAD is the enzyme converting glutamic acid to -aminobutyric acid and is
2

244

involved in the control of release of insulin from the secretory granules.
Islet cell antibody
Antibodies are reactive with whole islets and with increasing -cell
destruction their levels fall such that they are not usually seen after the
first year of disease. Prevalence at diagnosis is 75%, first degree relatives
25%, general population 0.4%.
2

Insulin antibody
Prior to administration of exogenous insulin, these antibodies are present
in 40% of newly diagnosed patients with type 1 DM. Titres diminish once
-cell destruction is advanced. May be seen in other autoimmune polyendocrinopathies.
2

Sperm antibody
Considered specific and characteristic of immunological infertility. In direct
agglutination tests if greater than 40% of the sperm are coated with particles a diagnosis of immunological infertility due to antisperm antibodies is
highly probable.

4 Immunology
Steroid cell antibodies
Present in Addisons disease, autoimmune endocrinopathies, premature
ovarian failure and gonadal failure.
Antigen: cytochromic P450 enzymes in the steroid biosynthetic
pathways.
Thyroid antibodies
May be primary, pathogenic antibodies or secondary antibodies which may
be useful as a diagnostic marker.
Primary thyroid antibodies
Thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAB) are useful in the diagnosis of
Graves disease. Anti-TRAB is seen in 5080% of Graves. Does not distinguish between stimulatory and inhibitory antibodies, which can only be
achieved by a functional or bioassay.
Secondary thyroid antibodies
Major autoantibodies associated with autoimmune thyroid disease are
thyroglobulin (TG) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). The TPO antibody is
the more clinically relevant and often seen at high titre in 8095% of
patients with Hashimotos thyroiditis, but also seen in patients with
Graves disease (5080% intermediate titre).
OHCM p409.

Gastrointestinal disease
245
Autoantibodies associated with coeliac disease
Coeliac disease is gluten-sensitive enteropathy. There is abnormal
immunological responsiveness to wheat protein, -gliadin. IgA--gliadin
and IgG and IgA-endomysial antibodies are sensitive and specific markers
for coeliac disease and IgA-endomysial antibodies are the antibody of
choice for primary screening for coeliac disease. -gliadin antibodies are a
useful adjunct in the assessment of children with suspected coeliac disease
and may be used to monitor the efficacy or compliance with a gluten-free
diet. IgA deficiency must obviously be excluded in patients under
investigation.
Autoantibodies associated with liver disease
Antibodies associated with autoimmune liver disease are mitochrondrial,
smooth muscle (SM) and liver/kidney microsomal (LKM) antibodies.
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) may also be seen. The titre of the antibodies is of clinical significance.

Heart disease
Cardiac muscle antibodies are associated with myocarditis, idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy, rheumatic carditis and Dresslers syndrome.
Antigens include adenine nucleotide translocator protein, cardiac
myosin and tropomyosin.

Skin disease
Skin antibodies are used in investigating bullous skin diseases. There are
two types:
2 Intra-epidermal/desmosome antibody (pemphigus antibody)associated with all forms of pemphigus.
2 Basement membrane zone antibody (pemphigoid antibody)associated predominantly with bullous pemphigoid. Present in serum of
7090% of affected individuals.

Complement
The complement system consists of three sections, the classical pathway,
the alternate pathway and the terminal lytic sequence. The glycoprotein
components are number C1 through C9 and the system is completed
with a number of inhibitory and regulatory proteins. Activation of the classical or alternate pathways feeds into the central biological event which is
the attachment or fixation of the third component C3. The activation of
activates the terminal lytic sequence causing cell damage and
252 C3
inflammation.
Clinical assays
The function of complement can be assayed by the lysis of red cells; individual components can be measured and evidence for activation of the
complement system can be obtained by detecting breakdown products.
Complement (CH50)
Clinical uses of complement assays
2 Monitor overall complement activity.
2 Screen for complete defects of components other than C3 and C4.
2 A variation of the assay can be used to determine the functional
integrity of the alternate pathway (AP50).
Complement C3 and C4
Low concentrations indicate either increased consumption or decreased
synthesis.
Increased consumption can be due to
2 Antigenantibody complex can activate the whole of the complement
system. C3 and C4 will be low.
2 Endotoxin or other microbial product activation of the alternate
pathway. C3 low, C4 normal.

4 Immunology
Decreased synthesis
Congenital homozygous deficiencies of C3 and C4 are rare. Heterozygous
states are not uncommon. There is an increased incidence of C4
heterozygosity in association with SLE and type 1 DM.
Clinical use in which C3 and C4 concentrations may be useful
2 Renal disease, joint disease and multi-system disorders with evidence
of vasculitis, e.g. SLE and also severe systemic infection.
2 Low complement is suggestive of active disease.
2 Low C3 and normal C4 concentrations may be seen in patients with
Gram ve septicaemia, some forms of glomerulonephritis (e.g. acute
nephritis) and sub-acute or chronic proliferative and mesangiocapillary
nephritis.
In patients with recurrent infections, complement concentrations and
CH50 should be measured as genetic and acquired defects can sometimes
present as immunodeficiency. A low CH50 should be followed with specific complement component measures to identify any deficiency.
Other complement investigations
Complement allotypes: MHC markers of certain diseases, confirmation of
hereditary complement deficiency status.
Complement activation products: anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a &
C5a
Limited userelatively unstable and non-specific.
Complement C3 nephritic factor (C3 NEF)
If C3 concentration is 5 and C4 normal, the presence of C3 NEF in a
253
patient with renal disease is suggestive of mesangiocapillary nephritis.
C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 INH)
Hereditary angio-oedema is due to the deficiency of C1 esterase
inhibitor and is the most frequent of the inherited complement component deficiencies. Functional C1 INH may be needed in acquired angiooedema.

Immunoglobulins
The monomeric immunoglobulin molecule is composed of two identical
heavy chains (G, A, M, D and E) and two identical light chains ( and ).
Immunoglobulins are variants of this basic structure.
Measurement of serum concentrations of IgG, A & M
These are useful in:
2 Diagnosis and monitoring of primary and secondary immunodeficiency.
2 Monitoring of patients receiving immunoglobulin replacement therapy.
2 Diagnosis of B cell malignancy.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses
IgG has four subclasses:
IgG1
IgG2
IgG3
IgG4

6070%
1420%
48%
26%

Reference ranges are age-related. Viral antibody responses are mainly
IgG1 and IgG3, whilst antibody to parasitic antigen is usually IgG4. In children polysaccharide antibody responses are mainly IgG1, whereas in adults
they are IgG2.
Clinical uses
IgG subclass deficiency.
Total IgG is usually within the age-related reference range.
Sub-class assays may be useful to define an isolated sub-class deficiency
in patients with multiple recurrent infections in whom total IgG is not
deficient.

Monoclonal immunoglobulins
paraproteins
254 Proliferation of a single clone of B cells results in single heavy chain class,

light chain type and idiotype. This is called a paraprotein. Immunoglobulin
fragments produced by tumour cells are more common in malignant conditions. Both serum and urine analysis is important. Most frequently seen
paraprotein in urine is called the Bence Jones protein.
Clinical uses
2 Paraprotein assays are necessary for identifying B-cell tumours.
2 Monitoring benign and malignant paraproteins.
Immunoglobulin E
IgE exerts its activity only when bound to blood basophils or tissue mast
cells. When antigens bind to membrane, specific IgE mediators are
released from these cells resulting in immediate hypersensitivity reactions.
An 4 serum IgE concentration suggests atopy, atopic tendency or parasitic
infestation.
Clinical conditions associated with 4 total serum IgE

Studies of immune paresis
Immunodeficiency may be primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired)
and may also occur transiently in infancy. It can occur at any age. Primary
immunodeficiencies may occur with:
2 Predominant antibody defects.
2 Predominant cell mediated immunity defects.
2 Deficiencies associated with other defects.
Investigations
Cellular and humoral immunity investigations may be carried out and
humoral assays may include those for functional antibodies in response to

255

infection or challenge. Mannose binding lectin deficiencies ( Complement
(p252)) are generally associated with increased risk of infection in children.

Cryoproteins
Cryoproteins precipitate when serum or plasma is cooled and re-dissolved when warmed. Cryoproteins may be due to the presence of mixed
cryoglobulins, polyclonal with monoclonal components, monoclonal cryoglobulins, cryofibrinogens and cold agglutinins (poly and monoclonal).
Clinical uses
Cryoprotein studies should be carried out in patients showing clinical
manifestations which include cold intolerance associated with pain in
exposed areas, Raynauds phenomenon and skin abnormalities including
purpura, urticaria and ulcers and renal impairment.

Introduction to infectious diseases
Everything about microscopic life is terribly upsetting how can things so small be so important? (Isaac
Asimov192092).

Throughout history, infectious diseases have had a huge impact on the
human species. Although they are present in human populations at all
times to some degree, and indeed modern societies sometimes almost
forget that infections exist, the effects of epidemics remain noticeable and
spectacular. Furthermore, almost the only new diseases that come along
are infectionssome of the 21st centurys most pressing problems are
pathogens which have only appeared in the 20 years prior to this book being
written (e.g. HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis E, Helicobacter pylori, new variant
CJD), though golden oldies such as tuberculosis, pneumococcus and
malaria are still merrily doing the rounds.
As we enter the 21st century several factors are serving to increase the
relative importance of infection over other areas of medicine. New infections are continually emerging, antimicrobial resistance is increasing,
numbers of immunosuppressed patients are increasing as a consequence
of improving therapies for hitherto untreatable diseases (cancer, transplantation, etc.), international travel and migration is increasing, and there
is a growing fear of bioterrorism. Accordingly, many diseases currently
considered tropical, and hence too remote and exotic to be much of a
problem in London or New York, are likely to become increasingly important in differential diagnosis lists throughout the developed world.
It is always worth bearing in mind that infectious diseases are often treatablein a differential diagnosis it is always better to consider treatable
options above non-treatable options, hence infection-related possibilities
should enter a differential diagnosis wherever appropriate. Furthermore,
some infectious diseases have major public health consequencese.g.
258 MDR-TB, MRSA, VHF, HIV, hepatitis Cand it is always worth making
special consideration of them if only because of the potential for spread to
other human beings.
Infection is a great mimic
Infectious diseases present a clinical challenge
The same infectious disease is often capable of causing a wide variety of
clinical pictures (e.g. tuberculosis, syphilis and HIV disease have many manifestations). This is not so surprising when one considers that identical
twins (etc.) apart, every human being on the planet is completely different,
hence individually tailored responses to a bewildering variety of infecting
agents should be expected rather than come as a surprise.
Some clinical syndromes can be caused by many quite different pathogens.
Good examples might be pneumonia, cellulitis and endocarditis.
Furthermore, some infectious diseases can resemble non-infectious diseases. For example, syphilis can cause a variety of rashes (including good
imitations of lichen planus and of the palmo-plantar pustulosis of Crohns
disease), amoebic colitis can resemble ulcerative colitis, a brain abscess

5 Infectious & tropical diseases
can resemble a brain tumour, and tuberculosis of the vertebral column
can resemble metastatic malignancy. Getting it wrong can be catastrophic
for the patient.
Other diseases can mimic infections
Non-infectious diseases can resemble infection. Examples include gout of the
first metatarso-phalangeal joint rather than cellulitis, cervical lyphadenopathy
due to lymphoma rather than tuberculosis, familial Mediterranean fever as a
cause of PUO, SLE leading to Libman-Sachs endocarditis, and an inflammatory carcinoma of the female breast resembling a pyogenic breast abscess.
Again, getting it wrong can be catastrophic for the patient.
The importance of epidemiological factors
Epidemiological infection can be crucial in determining which, if any, infectious problems are an issue in a given patient.
Geography: this is very important.
Some infections are common the world over and include
2 Salmonella infections.
2 Pneumococcal pneumonia.
2 Gonorrhoea.
2 Thrush (candidiasis).
2 Tuberculosis.
2 Influenza.
2 Epstein-Barr virus.
2 HIV .
2 Hepatitis C.
2 Herpes simplex.
2 Threadworm (Enterobius).

Fig. 5.1 The importance of taking a geographic history. Malaria, which can be
life threatening, is a very common disease in many parts of the world (see
map), but is not indiginous to most parts of the developed world. Making a
diagnosis depends heavily upon the clinician eliciting the clues in the patients
history. Even if they have been taking antimalarial drugs, a patient who has been
on holiday to Kenya, Thailand, or Brazil may die if the disease is not diagnosed.
Clinical suspicion should lead to blood lms (on 3 consecutive days) and a
platelet count. Bear in mind that the patient may not have been taking adequate
prophylaxis, may have been missing tablets, or may not have been absorbing
them.

Some infectious diseases are only common in the developing world, e.g.
2 Malaria.
2 Diphtheria.
2 Rheumatic fever.
2 Enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid).
2 Hepatitis E.
2 Poliomyelitis.
2 Rabies (although Eastern Europe has significant disease).
2 Viral haemorrhagic fever (aka VHF , e.g. Lassa fever).
2 Onchocerciasis (river blindness).
2 Schistosomiasis.
2 Leishmaniasis.
2 Ascariasis.
2 Cutaneous myiasis (e.g. tumbu fly).
Some infectious diseases are common in some parts of the developed
world but not in other parts of the developed world, and include
2 Lyme disease.
2 Babesiosis.
2 Histoplasmosis.
2 Hydatid disease.
2 Anisakiasis.
Indeed, only certain areas of the USA, for example, are endemic for
2 Lyme disease.
2 Coccidioidomycosis.
2 Babesiosis.
2 Histoplasmosis.
The Andromeda strain phenomenon (with all due credit to Michael
Crichton MD) should be borne in mind. The disease in front of you might
be the first ever presentation! Almost the only significant new human diseases that will appear in the future will be infectious diseases, and they will
keep appearing till the end of the human species.

260 Sexual and drug-taking activity: searching and personal questions may need
to be asked. For example, HIV disease may not be suspected until a
married man with three children admits to physical expression of
bisexuality, or an anaesthetist with a hepatitis illness admits to injecting
opiates recreationally. The patient may have a headache and photophobia
because of HSV-2 infection acquired from a new regular partner. It may
not be immediately obvious that the fever, rash and hypotension in a
woman may be related to her tampon usage (toxic shock syndrome), yet
menstruation can be a difficult subject to discuss in some cultural settings.
It is not in the best interests of a patient that these sorts of issues are not
broached if they are thought to be clinically relevant.
Social and professional: pets, hobbies and jobs may well be important.
The patient with pneumonia and a budgie could have psittacosis. The
tropical fish salesman with a chronic rash on his hand could have
Mycobacterium marinum infection (aka fish tank granuloma). The
jaundiced volunteer cleaning out canals at weekends could have
leptospirosis related to contact with rats.
Assessing the patient
Medicine is not easy, or everyone would be doing it! The recognition of an
infectious disease in a patient (or the absence of one) goes far beyond the
petri dish, the microbiology bench and PCR testing technology.

5 Infectious & tropical diseases
Assessment should include
2 Detailed history.
2 Full physical examination (including temperature).
2 The generation of a differential diagnosis.
2 Laboratory tests.
2 Non-invasive procedures (including radiological tests where appropriate).
2 Invasive procedures.
2 The making of a definitive diagnosis (wherever possible).
When considering the possibility of an infective process, one should
always consider the basic infection groups
2 Bacteria (including primitive forms).
2 Mycobacteria.
2 Fungi.
2 Viruses.
2 Protozoa.
2 Helminths.
2 Prions.
2 Myiasis.
When assessing a patient, it can be helpful to think in terms of
Syndromedo the signs and symptoms link up into a specific picture
(e.g. glandular fever, infective endocarditis, a shocked asplenic patient
with possible overwhelming pneumococcal septicaemia, the unilateral
discharging neck mass caused by tuberculosis)?
Pathologye.g. is the weight loss due to specific pathologies, such as
tuberculosis (curable) or HIV (treatable)?
Systematicallywork through the systems and ask if an infection could
be responsible for the clinical feature(s) that is (are) being observed.
261
Examples might include
2 Premature dementia and CJD .
2 Dyspepsia and gastric MALT oma due to Helicobacter pylori.
2 Fever in a returning traveller and malaria.
2 An infective process in a site that is not immediately obvious, such as
testicular infection, dental sepsis, a cervical spine abscess.
Where has the patient been? What have they been getting up to?
2 The strange perianal lesion with granulomatous features may be leishmaniasis picked up sitting on the beach in Malta.
2 The increasingly bizarre behaviour manifested by a 40-year-old businessman who regularly visits Eastern Europe without his wife could be
meningovascular syphilis.
2 Haematuria in a 22-year-old medical student may be due to the
Schistosoma haematobium infection he acquired swimming in Lake
Malawi while on an elective.
2 HIV -2 may be the cause of a glandular fever-like illness in an oil
company worker having recently returned from West Africa.
2 A febrile illness in a holidaymaker returning from Kenya could be
Plasmodium falciparum malaria if they had only been taking a chloroquine/proguanil combination for prophylaxis.

Paratyphoid and typhoid fevers are suggested by a history of possibly
drinking contaminated water in Morocco.
Brucellosis must be considered after visiting a farm in Turkey and
drinking unpasteurised milk.
Massive and unremitting pruritus in a 28-year-old VSO returnee from
Cameroon may be due to onchocerciasis.
The diagnosis might be righte.g. tuberculosis or pneumococcal
meningitisbut the TB may be resistant to isoniazid/rifampicin (ask
about travel history, e.g. to Pakistan) or the pneumococcus to
penicillin.

Sexual history
e.g. HIV, syphilis,
PID, herpes simplex,
etc.

Travel history
(holidays, business,
military, etc.)
e.g. malaria, VHF,
Legionnaire's disease,
gastroenteritis, etc.

Infection and history taking

Investigations available to the ID physician
(or general physician assessing a patient with a possible infectious disease)
Many tests will be performed with a view to making a diagnosis.
Investigation of a patient should be rational and evidence-based wherever
possible. As with any other branch of medicine, the history and examination will point the way, although the interrogative armamentarium of the
infectious diseases and tropical medicine physician is enormous.
Results will emerge which, while not producing a diagnosis as such, will
nevertheless require following up. For example, low C5 levels in recurrent
meningococcal septicaemia may need immunological assessment. IgG deficiency leading to recurrent pneumonia may require regular infusions of
 globulins. A low CD4+ cell count, which is not due to HIV infection,
could be a feature of sarcoidosis.
Making a diagnosis alone is not the only issue at stake. Some tests must be
done if a patient is going to be treated safely. Examples might include:
G6PD levels before administering primaquine for hypnozoite eradication;

5 Infectious & tropical diseases
TB cultures for antibiotic sensitivity prior to starting empirical therapy;
exclusion of pregnancy before using certain antibiotics such as doxycycline
and ciprofloxacin. Other tests relate to the fact that some infectious diseases are dangerous to others: a prime example of this would be multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, which is potentially dangerous for the population at large and needs to be identified (or at least suspected wherever
appropriate) and treated in an isolation unit.

Investigating the infectious
diseases/tropical medicine case
Patient history and examination
2 Generate a differential diagnosis.
2 Consider, as appropriate, all major groups of infecting/infesting organisms (bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, helminths, prions,
myiasis).
2 Decide on and gather most appropriate specimens for the infectious
agents under consideration (there are many useful books and web sites
to assist here).
Available diagnostic techniques include
Serology ( Serology (p265)).
Direct detection
Microscopy:
 Direct: e.g. faecal parasites ( iodine), cutaneous fungi, urinary
microfilaria in onchocerciasis.
 Special stains: these include Gram, acid/alcohol-fast, Calcofluour
white, silver stain, immunofluorescence (e.g. for some viruses, and
polyvalent direct fluorescence, or DF, for Legionella).
 Electron microscopy: for viruses and other pathogens as appropriate (e.g. aspirate from vesicle for herpes varicella-zoster,
Whipples disease in jejunal biopsy material).
2 Presence of toxin (e.g. Clostridium difficiledemonstration of a cytotoxin in a stool sample using a specific cytotoxic assay).
2 Antigen detection (
Serology (p265)).
2 Molecular assays (
Molecular diagnostics (p279)): these include gene
probes, amplification assays (e.g. polymerase chain reaction, or PCR).
2

Culture
Possible and desirable on almost any tissue, aspirate, bodily fluid, etc. For
maximum yield of useful information, expert and appropriate collection of
specimens from body surfaces, of fluids normally considered sterile, and of
non-sterile fluids is critical.
2 Identification through special growth media (e.g. McConkey agar, thioglycolate broth).

Identification by biochemical reactions (often available as commercial
identification panels or key tests, e.g. catalase test, coagulase test).
Identification with specific antisera (by agglutination, Quellung reaction,
or fluorescent antibody tests).
Identification using molecular-based methods (e.g. specific probes,
restriction enzyme patterns, DNA sequencing).
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, if indicated.

Other tests as appropriate: see appropriate sections
2 Biochemistry.
2 Culture and sensitivity.
2 Haematology.
2 Immunology.
2 Molecular tests.
2 Radiology.
2 Serological tests.
2 Stool & bowel contents.
2 Tissue biopsy and deep aspiration specimens.
2 Other tests.

Investigation of pyrexia of unknown
origin (PUO)
This is not an uncommon problem in hospital medicine. There is a huge
potential differential diagnosis.
PUO is best defined as

A body temperature 38.3C centrally (rectally) for 3 weeks or longer
without the cause being discovered, despite extensive investigation for at
least 1 week.

264

Assessment should include
Observation of the fever pattern
2 iSome conditions, such as typhoid and malaria, may exhibit characteristic fever patterns.
Complete and repeated detailed history, with emphasis on the recognised
differential diagnosis including
2 Travel history.
2 Antimalarial usage.
2 Vaccination history.
2 Past use of medical services in foreign parts may be especially important (e.g. blood transfusions, splenectomy post-trauma, needlestick
assaults).
2 Drug-using history (including illicit drugs and especially injecting).
2 Exposure to certain agents and/or animals (e.g. pet ownership, occupational risk of animal contact, such as veterinary medicine, nursing,
farming, meat packing).
2 Hobbies (e.g. cave spelunking is linked to histoplasmosis and canal
fishing to leptospirosis).
2 Sexual history (and risk taking).

5 Infectious & tropical diseases
2

Menstrual history.

Complete and repeated physical examination, including re-evaluation of
previous findings, e.g.
2 Check the skin, eyes, nail beds, lymph nodes, heart and abdomen.
2 A new sign, such as cardiac murmur, may have developed over time.
The judicious use of repeated tests is also critical, depending upon the
context
2 Laboratory and radiological tests, taking into account new data, e.g.
blood cultures, blood films, autoantibody screen, radiological findings.
2 Non-invasive procedures, taking into account new data, e.g. genitourinary assessment, such as high vaginal swab.
2 Invasive procedures, e.g. liver biopsy, bone marrow biopsy,
laparoscopy, Waldeyers ring assessment by otolaryngologist.
The common groups of causes of a PUO in an adult are
Infections.
Connective tissue diseases.
Occult neoplasms (especially leukaemia and lymphoma).

pulmonary emboli, drugs, rheumatological (Stills disease, temporal
arteritis, SLE, vasculitis), atrial myxoma, factitious fever, Munchausens syndrome, Munchausens syndrome by proxy.
With improved non-invasive and microbiological techniques, most cases 265
of PUO are found not to be caused by infections but rather by other systemic diseases, such as sarcoidosis, SLE and temporal arteritis. However,
there are also infectious diseases capable of causing prolonged fever that
should always be considered and factored into the assessment because
they are often treatable and/or transmissible to others and will have
serious consequences if missed.

Serology
Immunological methods are in wide usage to detect pathogens present in
clinical samples. Serology refers to the laboratory usage of antigenantibody reactions for such diagnostic purposes. This testing methodology is
based on the knowledge that antigenantibody reactions are very specific.
Diagnosis is arrived at by detecting antibody or antigen in blood and/or
other bodily fluids, or by the identification of pathogens in culture.
Both DIRECT and INDIRECT serological tests exist.

Indirect serological techniques employ antigenantibody reactions to
detect specific antibodies manufactured in response to an antigen or
antigens on an infecting pathogens surface and circulating in the
patients blood or present in other body fluids (such as saliva). Some
are non-specific (e.g. cold agglutinins, VDRL, monospot), others are
specific to given pathogens.
Direct serological techniques employ antibodies to detect specific
antigens. Because this technique can be used to identify and type
cultured organisms ( Culture techniques p270), it not only has
individual clinical value but also has important epidemiological
applications. Indeed, the identification and typing of organisms is
extremely valuable in the public health scenario, such as with the study
of outbreaks.
Hepatitis B (HBV) is a good example of an infection where both antigen
and antibody profiles are diagnostically, therapeutically, prognostically
and epidemiologically important:
2 Antibody detection of specific antibody, e.g. antihepatitis Be antigen
(anti-HBe antibody), antihepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs antibody).
2 Antigen detection, e.g. hepatitis B e antigen (HB eA g), hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg).

A wide variety of methodologies for assessing antibody response are available, such as immunofluorescence, agglutination and ELISA (enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay). This is a complex subject and beyond the range of
this book.

Sub-classification of organisms, through serogrouping, is very valuable epidemiologically, e.g. while investigating an outbreak of meningococcal
(Neisseria meningitides) disease, if the culprit is determined to be type C,
vaccination can be utilised to control the outbreak (if it is a type B outbreak, there is currently no vaccine available).
In the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) technique, a fluorescent monoclonal antibody is used to react with an antigen specific for a given
organism (e.g. herpes simplex virus) and a positive result will be detected
microscopically. If the fluorescent antibody does not react with the
antigen, the antibodies will be washed off the slide and the antigen will not
fluoresce.
General principles
1. Elevated specific IgM levels indicates a new infection.
2. Elevated specific IgG levels indicates a new or a previous infection.
3. Increasing IgG (rising titre) when two samples (paired sera) are taken
with an appropriate intervening interval between them indicates a
new infection or re-infection. Diagnosis (as indicated by seroconversion) necessitates a diagnostic antibody titre or a four-fold increase in
antibody titre.
4. Seroconversion is said to have occurred in situations 1 and 3.

 http://www.clinical-mycology.com/

Note: Some tests, such as complement fixation (CF) antibody assays for

268 antibodies to coccidiomycosis, are specific and do not require proof of
rising levels. They can accordingly provide indispensable confirmatory evidence for a diagnosis of coccidiomycosis as well as an indication of the relative risk of extrapulmonary dissemination. In chronic meningitis, a
positive CF for anti-coccidioidal antibodies in the CSF often provides the
only definite diagnostic indication of the need for aggressive antifungal
therapy. Otherwise, most tests for antifungal antibodies, are of limited
usefulness at present.

Antigen tests
Antigen measurement is achieved through techniques such as complement fixation and immunodiffusion. A variety of bodily fluids can yield
diagnostically-useful antigens, including serum, urine, CSF and fresh
stoolthe choice depends upon the clinical context.

Culture techniques
Microorganisms exist in nature as mixed populations. Diagnosis of an
infection means identifying the relevant pathogen in the face of this
plethora of pretenders to the crown. Furthermore, different organisms
can cause the same disease (a good example would be pneumonia) and
yet require very different treatment and management and have different
prognoses. While some specimens (e.g. stool, sputum) contain extremely
large numbers of a variety of organisms, some specimens (e.g. blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine) should be sterile unless infected or contaminated
during their collection.
Microbial culture assists with the aetiological diagnosis of a bacterial,
fungal, protozoal or viral illness by enabling identification and susceptibility
testing of the isolated organism(s). Bacterial culture was the first to evolve,
but useful data on other pathogenic groups can also be obtained through
the use of culture-based methodologies (although options for treatment
are currently more limited for viruses and fungi than for bacteria).
Furthermore, culture of viruses and fungi usually takes longer than most
bacterial culture, therefore the data obtained is most valuable for the late
confirmation of the diagnosis or for epidemiological purposes (e.g. for predicting the appropriate constituents for a polyvalent influenza vaccine).
This account is by no means comprehensive. For greater depth, the reader
is directed towards the major texts on the subject of microbiological
culture.
Bacteria
Three major steps are involved in extracting pure cultures from a diverse
population of microorganisms and identifying a pathogen.
1. An isolation plate is createdto do this, the mixture must be diluted
until the various individual microorganisms have been dispersed far
270 enough apart on an agar surface so that, after incubation, they will form
visible colonies isolated from the colonies of their neighbours. This can
be accomplished through several mechanical techniques, such as the
streak plate method, the pour plate method and the spin plate
method. Specialised culture media (such as selective media, differential
media, enrichment media, and combination selective and differential
mediaa great many exist) may be used to supplement mechanical
techniques of isolation. Culture can be aerobic or anaerobic (Note:
specimens for the isolation of anaerobic pathogens require special care
as anaerobic bacteria die in the presence of oxygen. Such specimens
should therefore be transported in a reduced container).
2. A pure culture is createdto achieve this, an isolated colony will be
selected out and aseptically picked off the isolation plate for
transferring to a new sterile medium. Accordingly, following incubation
all the organisms in the new culture will be descendants of the same
organism.
3. The organism can then be identified through various manoeuvres:
2 The colony appearance.
2 The microscopic appearance.
2 The staining responses (e.g. Gram +ve vs. Gram ve).

5 Infectious & tropical diseases

The use of a range of biochemical tests designed to uncover characteristics typical of a particular organism, e.g. catalase reaction, sugar fermentation.
The use of antisera (direct serology) for culture confirmation of certain
organisms:
 Agglutination and latex agglutination tests are used on colonies to
identify Escherichia coli 0157, Streptococcus pneumoniae, serogroups
of Neisseria meningitidis, Shigella and Salmonella, Lancefield groups of
-haemolytic streptococci and serotypes of Haemophilus influenzae.
 Detection of specific antigens by DFA (direct fluorescent antibody)
staining can be used to identify colonies of Streptococcus pyogenes,
Bordetella pertussis and the species and serotypes of Legionella.
 The Quellung reaction, a technique which employs specific antisera
to interact with capsular polysaccharides of Streptococcus pneumoniae, can be used to confirm the identification of the pneumococcus
as well as to determine the serotype of the cultured organism.

Ideally, specimens for bacterial culture should be taken BEFORE antibiotics are administered. Clearly this may not always be feasible but the
information yield may well be less than ideal.
Antibiotic sensitivity
Once a bacterium is isolated, it can be cultured in the presence of an
antibiotic or antibiotics to assess if it is susceptible to that agent or not (i.e.
resistant). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest
antibiotic concentration at which the microorganism under assessment
shows no visible growth in vitro. The reporting of MICs can provide the
clinician with precise information regarding the infecting bacteriums
degree of antibiotic susceptibility and enable him/her to avoid antibiotics
to which the organism shows resistance. When this data is linked up with
the clinicians knowledge of the site and severity of the infection and the
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the various antibiotics available, a rational choice of the most appropriate antibiotic(s) can
272 then be made that best suits the individual patients needs.
For organisms exhibiting unusual resistance patterns, susceptibility panels
using methodologies such as broth microdilution, gradient diffusion,
and/or disc diffusion have been created to assist clinicians.
 http://www.aruplab.com/guides/clt/tests/clt_a-62.htm#1142466

On occasions, this data will need to be linked to testing of blood levels for
some antibiotics (e.g. gentamicin, vancomycin, cycloserine). Although its
value is not universally accepted, the serum bactericidal test (SBT) can be
utilised to determine whether concentrations of the antibiotic in a
patients serum are capable of killing the infecting microorganism in a particular clinical scenario (e.g. bacterial osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis,
immunocompromised patients suffering from unusual infections, situations
where unusual drug combinations are being used).
 http://www.aruplab.com/guides/clt/tests/clt_a-79.htm#1144958

Viruses
Viral culture is very different from bacterial culture. Viruses require a very
different type of medium for the organism to grow in, cell cultures, and
viral growth is recognised through the cytopathic changes that appear in

5 Infectious & tropical diseases
cell culture. New techniques appear regularly, particularly rapid culture
techniques.

normal monkey kidney tissue culture. From Grist NR et al. (1987) Diseases of
Infectionan Illustrated Textbook, Oxford University Press, Oxford.

The appropriate type of specimen to collect, the best means of transport,
and the most appropriate cell culture to use will vary with the particular
virus suspected, the specimen site and the time of the year.
2 The choice of specimen is very important: numerous viruses enter via
the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, yet that virus may compromise multiple or distant tissues and organs.
2 Swabs can be used to collect a variety of specimens from the body surfaces for viral detection, such as the nose, the throat, the eye, the skin
and the rectum. Deeper specimens, such as blood and CSF, will be
appropriate for some viruses. Different viruses will need different collection approachesfor example, heparin, citrate and EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) are all acceptable for the detection of CMV
by culture or by antigenaemia testing, but for some other viruses only
citrate should be used if they are to be cultured. Issues like the temperature during transport of specimens must be taken into account.
2 Unlike many bacterial or fungal pathogens, the time of year is important to keep in mind when making a diagnosis of certain viral diseases.
For example, enteroviruses (such as poliomyelitis) circulate almost
exclusively in the summer months and influenza likewise circulates
during the winter months, so these viruses are unlikely to cause problems during other seasons of the year.
2 Timing is important when collecting specimens for viral detection.
They should be collected as early as possible after the onset of symptoms as once viral shedding ceases, culture will be impossible and
serological and molecular techniques may be the only way of diagnosing the viral pathogen.
2 Some viruses as yet cannot be culturede.g. viral agents of diarrhoea
(caliciviruses, astroviruses and coronaviruses), hepatitis (HCV, HBV).

Cell culture techniques enable detection of a wide range of viral
pathogens and can allow for dual or mixed viral infections to be diagnosed
(which are common). Once specimens arrive at the laboratory, they are

5 Infectious & tropical diseases
processed and inoculated into a variety of cell cultures that support the
growth of common viral isolates, and inoculated cell cultures are then
observed daily for the development of a viral cytopathic effect. Viruses
vary in their cell culture requirements, and laboratories must use more
than one cell line for culture. For example, when attempting to identify a
respiratory viral pathogen, influenza and parainfluenza viruses favour replicating in primary cell lines such as primary Rhesus monkey kidney (RhMK)
cells while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenoviruses prefer heteroploid cell lines such as human epidermoid larynx carcinoma (Hep-2)
cells.
Among the newer viral culture techniques are shell vial spin amplification
cultures. These offer a more rapid turnaround time than traditional viral
cultures for detection of the more common respiratory viruses and some
other agents. Rather than having to examine for a cytopathic effect, fluorescein-labelled monoclonal antibodies are unemployed to detect antigens of replicating viruses. This system can be utilised for detecting CMV,
HSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, adenovirus and RSV, and
can detect, for example, HSV in as little as 1 or 2 days.
Laboratory assays for antiviral susceptibility testing include phenotypic and
genotypic assays. Phenotypic assays require growth of the virus in vitro, and
are useful for HSV and CMV for aciclovir and ganciclovir, respectively.
Viruses for which in vitro culture systems are not available, such as HCV
and HBV, cannot be tested with these types of assays, and in these circumstances genotypic assays ( Molecular diagnostics (p279)) may be
available and useful.
Fungi
Unlike bacterial and viral diseases, in skilled hands direct microscopy can
often be used with a high degree of confidence to diagnose fungal infec- 275
tions (this being based on the distinctive morphological characteristics of
the invading fungi (e.g. tinea) and/or the judicious use of special stains such
as Calcofluor white). However, histopathological diagnoses should be
confirmed by culture wherever possible. Conversely, although diagnoses
are usually made by isolating the causative fungus (e.g. from sputum, urine,
blood, bone marrow or biopsies from infected tissues), the presence of a
fungus in a culture does not mean that it is invading the tissues (e.g.
Candida isolation from sputum), and an aetiological role can be established
with certainty only by confirmation of tissue invasion. There are also a
range of serological tests available for systemic mycoses ( Serology
(p265)), but few provide definitive diagnoses by themselves.
Fungal culture techniques are similar to the bacterial scenario. They are
most useful for detecting the dimorphic fungi, which manifest both
mycelial and yeast forms. This group includes Candida spp., Cryptococcus
neoformans, Blastomyces dermatidis, Histoplasma capsulatum and
Coccidioides immitis. Rates of colony growth vary extremely widely, e.g.
Coccidioides immitis may appear after 1 day, while Histoplasma may take a
month or more. Special culture media, such as Niger seed agar, may be
required.

Identification requires skill and experience and is based mainly upon the
microscopic appearance of the hyphae and the appearance and arrangement of the spores. Definitive diagnosis of a dimorphic fungus may require
inoculation into a living creature, such as a mouse, to convert the agent
into the parasitic (i.e. yeast) form.
Protozoa
Protozoa of the genera Acanthamoeba and Naegleria may cause fatal CNS
disease. Acanthamoeba spp. are free-living amoebae associated with keratitis; they may also cause a granulomatous encephalitis. Another freeliving amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, is able to cause an acute fulminant
meningoencephalitis, usually associated with a history of swimming in
freshwater lakes or brackish water. In suspected cases, CSF and other suspicious clinical material may be cultured on a non-nutrient agar plate
seeded with a lawn of a Gram-negative bacteria (such as E. coli).
Pathogenic amoeba can be identified microscopically.

Collection of specimens
Principles of good specimen collection
2 Good-quality specimen and clinical information produces the most
valuable data.
2 Optimal time of collection: e.g. if at all possible, take bacterial specimens before administering antibiotics.
2 Collect the optimal type of specimen wherever possible: e.g. pus is
preferable to a pus swab.
2 Acquire expertise in specimen collection: ensure minimal contamination by normal flora (e.g. mid-stream specimen of urine (MSU), use of a
tongue depressor for throat swab collection).
2 Freshness of specimens: rapid transport to the laboratory is essential
(especially for anaerobic organisms, and for hot stools for parasite
276
diagnosis).
2 Collect the appropriate number of specimens at the appropriate intervals: e.g. paired antisera should be taken at least 16 weeks apart if a
diagnostic rising titre is to be demonstrated.
2 Be aware of biological hazards: category 3 organisms (e.g. tuberculosis,
Burkholderia pseudomallei, hepatitis C, HIV) and category 4 organisms (e.g.
viral haemorrhagic fever, possible bioterrorism cases such as smallpox).
Surface specimens include
Anal/anorectal: e.g. gonococcus (Neisseria gonorrhoeae).
Cervical swab: e.g. HSV, gonococcus, HPV.
Ear swab: e.g. otitis externa, otitis media, bacterial and fungal infections.
Foreign bodies: almost always infected if causing trouble! (includes
iatrogenic FBs, such as arthroplasties, cardiac valves, pacemakers,
ventriculo-peritoneal shunts, etc.). Foreign bodies in the ear, nose or
vagina can lead to prolonged (and often unpleasant) discharges.
Genital ulcers: dark ground microscopy for syphilis organisms. Also
chancroid, Entamoeba histolytica.

5 Infectious & tropical diseases
Indwelling catheters: these represent a breach of the integrity of the
skin or mucosal surface. Include urinary catheters, intravenous
cannulae, portacaths, etc. If a catheter is thought to be the source of an
infection, cultures should be set up, and if the catheter or cannula is
removed, this should be sent for culture.
Laryngeal swab: can be useful for tuberculosis.
Nasal, pharyngeal, gingival and throat: e.g. meningococcus,
Staphylococcus aureus carriage, streptococcal infections, pertussis,
adenovirus. Naso-pharyngeal aspirates are useful diagnosing for
influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) through direct
immunofluorescence (DIF) tests and culture. In lepromatous leprosy, a
swab from the anterior nares may reveal acid-fast bacilli indicative of
this infection.
Ophthalmic: e.g. bacterial conjunctivitis, adenovirus, rabies (from
corneal impressions1. For trachoma, direct fluorescein-labelled
monoclonal antibody (DFA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) of
conjunctival smears is useful.
 http://www.emedicine.com/OPH/topic118.htm

Skin: 2abscessculture for bacteria and other, unusual, organisms;
2dermal scrapings, nail clippings: fungal infections (tineaincludes
pedis, capitis, cruris, versicolor forms); 2petechial rash scrapings:
meningococcus (occasionally gonococcus).
Throat: e.g. Candida albicans, diphtheria, gonococcus, croup organisms.
Urethral: e.g. Chlamydia, gonococcus.
Vagina (high vaginal swab): e.g. Staphylococcus aureus in toxic shock
syndrome (including toxin testing), Gardnerella, gonococcus.
Normally sterile fluids include
Amniotic fluid: bacterial infection can cause premature delivery, and
rDNA was detected by PCR ( Molecular diagnostics (p279)) in samples
from 15 (94%) of 16 patients with positive amniotic fluid cultures2.
From the fetal point of view, hydrops fetalis can be caused by congenital
infections (CMV, parvovirus B19, toxoplasmosis, syphilis and Chagas'
disease), and making a diagnosis may involve analysis of amniotic fluid
with cultures, PCR, etc.
Ascites: always consider tuberculosis (consider laparoscopy for
biopsying peritoneal lesions for culture as well as histology,
Gastrointestinal tract investigations (p284)). In some instances, bacterial
(especially pneumococcal) infection is a possibility.
Blood: multiple samplings at separate times from separate body sites
may need to be taken, such as in endocarditis. For some organisms and
pathologies, an extended period of culture may be needed. Aerobic
bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi all come into the
frame.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): possibilities include e.g. meningococcus,
pneumococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, tuberculosis, fungi (e.g.

277

Cryptococcus neoformans), viruses (
specimens (p287)).

Tissue biopsy & deep aspiration

Ejaculate (semen): if the semen contains a high number of leucocytes,
this may be an indication of either infection or inflammation. White
blood cells are considered significant if more than one million are found
in each millilitre of the ejaculate. STDs such as gonorrhoea or
Ureaplasma, and prostate infections come into the differential diagnosis.
Schistosoma haematobium (bilharzia) may cause haemospermia, and be
found in ejaculate3. Acute mumps orchitis can be associated with loss of
spermatozoa.
Ocular fluids (intra-): include aqueous humor, vitreous humor. Bacterial,
fungal and parasitic problems can affect the interior of the eye.
Pericardial fluid: the most common organisms will include
staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae,
meningococci and tuberculosis.
Pleural fluid: numerous pathologies, including underlying bacterial
pneumonia, tuberculous pleurisy, parasitic infections (such as
strongyloidiasis) and fungal diseases (such as histoplasmosis).
Synovial fluid (joint aspirate): bacterial infections can be very destructive
and the options are legion. Tuberculosis must always be borne in mind.
Viral arthritides are usually self-limiting and treatment is supportive.
Urine: standard culture and sensitivity, e.g. midstream specimen (MSU),
catheter specimen (CSU) useful for diagnosing cystitis, pyelonephritis,
prostatitis, etc. (prostatic massage may be helpful for improving
diagnosis of prostatic infections); EMU (early morning urines) for
tuberculosis and a terminal specimen for Schistosoma haematobium
(bilharzia).
Normally infected fluids include
Pus: e.g. abscess contents (such a collection can exist in almost any site
278 in the body), wound swab/aspirates, drainage swabs. Usually bacterial
(consider both aerobic and anaerobic options), but amoebic and
hydatid options need to be considered when the lesion is in the liver.
Saliva: normally contains a wide range of commensal flora. Cannulation
of a parotid gland duct may yield a specific pathogen that is causing a
problem in that gland.
Sputum: includes tracheal aspirate, induced sputum (obtained with
physiotherapy assistance) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which may
be needed in sicker patients unable to produce sputum or in conditions
where copious sputum production may not be a feature (such as
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV infection). Culture and sensitivity
assists with identifying a vast range of organisms, including and especially
tuberculosis (always ally sputum culture to direct microscopy).
Stool: vast range of uses ( Gastrointestinal tract investigations (p284)).
Includes Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, E. coli 0157, typhoid and
paratyphoid, Plesiomonas shigelloides, rotavirus, enteroviruses, etc. Hot
stools (from patient to the microbiology bench in less than 1h) are
needed for amoebae, strongyloides larvae, etc.

Molecular diagnostics
Molecular diagnostics represents a growing and constantly changing area
of medicine. Currently, these tests are expensive and are often only available in larger or specialist laboratories, but their potential power is considerable and simplification of the technology involved will increasingly
place them within the reach of an ever-wider range of clinical laboratories.
While a full understanding of these complex technologies can present
some conceptual difficulties to the average clinician, they are destined to
become an increasingly important part of mainstream clinical practice. For
example, in the setting of HIV/AIDS, viral load and anti-retroviral drug
resistance are considered mainstream tests, while examination of the CSF
for JC virus DNA by PCR is the method of choice for the diagnosis of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy.
The areas of greatest value include
2 Detection and quantification of viruses to monitor therapy, e.g. HCV ,
HIV, HBV, CMV.
2 Detection of slow-growing organisms, e.g. TB , atypical mycobacteria.
2 Diagnosis of pathogens which are potentially too dangerous for the
laboratory staff to handle, e.g. viral haemorrhagic fever, smallpox.
279
2 Detection of organisms killed by antibiotics prior to culture samples
being taken, e.g. meningococcal sepsis.
2 Detection of organisms that cannot be cultured, e.g. hepatitis C virus
(HCV).
2 Detection of unusual diseases, e.g. helminthic diseases, fungi.
2 Detection of toxins elaborated in small quantities by bacteria, e.g. toxic
shock syndrome toxins.
2 Where it is wished to quantify the level of an infection (e.g. viral load
in HIV disease).
2 Detection of mutations manifesting resistance to antimicrobial agents
(genotypic resistance testing), e.g. HIV, CMV, TB. Unlike phenotypic
assays, the major drawback of genotypic assays is that they can detect
only resistance caused by known mutations, but unlike phenotypic
assays there is no requirement for the virus to be cultured.
2 Elucidation of pathogens that are as yet undiscovered.
Available molecular techniques include
PCR (polymerase chain reaction): this test uses probes to look for the
presence of the genes of infecting organisms. Essentially the PCR technique is a primer extension reaction for amplifying specific nucleic

2

280

acids in vitro. In this way a short piece of DNA (the target sequence)
can be amplified around one million fold, which enables its nucleotide
sequence to be established and the organism it came from to be determined.
 There are numerous PCR tests available now, and it is particularly
valuable for hepatitis C (including for genotyping), HIV and TB. A
universal eubacterial PCR (for genus and species identification of
prokaryotes) and universal fungal PCR (genus and species identification of fungi) are available. HBV DNA quantification is accomplished
through PCR.
 Choosing the appropriate sample for the application of PCR testing
is very important (e.g. biopsy of possible Kaposis sarcoma lesion
and KSHV (HHV-8); BAL fluid and PCP; small bowel biopsy and
Whipples disease; CSF and meningococcal disease or herpes
simplex virus).
LCR (ligase chain reaction): LCR works through specific probe amplification through the use of DNA-ligase. To date, this has found greatest
value in Chlamydia infection.
TMA (transcription mediated amplification): TMA uses an isothermal
amplification system. Amplified telomerase products are RNA and
these are detected using a non-isotopic hybridization protection (HPA)
system. Quantitative analysis is based on the principle of differential
hydrolysis of the bound and free probe. Identification of HCV, tuberculosis, gonococcus and Chlamydia are among its potential uses.
Branched chain DNA (BDNA): a signal amplification methodology able
to quantify HIV RNA levels.
NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based amplification): a quantitative test
for HIV RNA. It also has value with CMV.
Hybridisation with nucleic acid probes: this detects specific ribosomal
RNA, and is most widely used for culture confirmation of an organism
(e.g. fungi, mycobacteria).

Sequencing: organisms are identified by direct sequencing of amplified
gene fragments. This has been applied to tuberculosis, Helicobacter
pylori, enteroviruses and HIV (for assessing drug resistance).
Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP): restriction enzymes
are used to cut up DNA into pieces, and the fragments are then subjected to gel electrophoresis (such as Southern blotting). The patterns
produced can be used to identify organisms; this has other uses
outside, but relevant to, infection medicine. For example, RFLP has
been used for hepatitis C, adenovirus, tuberculosis, lymphoma and
sickle cell disease.

Haematology
Many infectious diseases manifest haematological changes that are diagnostically valuable.
Blood film: the blood smear examination provides general data on the
size and appearance of cells as well as data on particular cell segments,
while pathogens may be seen, e.g. malaria, trypanosomiasis, babesiosis,
borreliosis, bartonella, filaria (time of day the blood is taken may be
significant in this condition), haemolysis and evidence of hyposplenism.
Thick and thin blood films should be considered, especially where malaria
is concerned, and to exclude this potentially lethal condition it is
recommended that at least three blood films each taken 24h apart should
be performed. Blood films are also useful in assessing if a patient has
developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)see below.
Bone marrow examination: useful in e.g. culture (for TB, brucellosis and
typhoid), microscopy (for leishmaniasis), establishing cell line integrity
(e.g white cell abnormalities). An aspirate is generally very useful for
culture purposes and for establishing what cells are present in the
marrow, but a trephine is needed if structural information is needed
(e.g. to establish if granulomata suggestive of tuberculosis are present).
Coagulation studies, fibrin degradation products, D-dimers: useful where
DIC is suspected. DIC is a common association of severe sepsis
(especially meningococcal disease). Coagulation abnormalities are also
present in conditions such as viral haemorrhagic fevers, Plasmodium
falciparum malaria, rickettsial diseases, etc. D-dimers may assist with the
diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis, although this is not universally
accepted.
Cold agglutinins: a haemagglutination-based test. Can be caused by
Mycoplasma pneumoniae (most commonly), influenza A, influenza B,
parainfluenza and adenoviruses.
Differential white cell count in peripheral blood: useful associations include
(1) eosinophilia and parasitoses, (2) neutrophilia and bacterial sepsis,

281

(3) neutropenia and atypical pneumonias, (4) atypical lymphocytes and
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), (5) neutropenia and pyrexia.
ESR: together with the C-reactive protein (

Biochemical tests (p286)),
the rate of erythrocyte sedimentation is sensitive to the extent of a
bodys response to a lesion or disease. The ESR is important for
pointing to the possible existence of an organic disease, but a normal
result does not exclude the presence of disease. An elevated ESR points
to the need for additional investigations and, if elevated, is very useful in
monitoring the course of a disease.
Ferritin levels: reduced in iron deficiency, such as that associated with
hookworm infestation of the bowel (Ancyclostoma duodenale, Necator
americanus) or Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis. Serum iron and
TIBC may be helpful ( Biochemical tests (p286)).
Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase: useful in the rational therapy of
benign malarias, such as Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale (a deficiency will
cause therapeutic problems with primaquine usage to kill the
hypnozoite phase and prevent relapse).
Haemoglobin level and red cell parameters (especially MCV): useful in
e.g. anaemia of chronic infection, haemolysis, iron deficiency
(microcytosis) associated with hookworm infestation of the bowel or
Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis, macrocytosis due to vitamin B12
deficiency with Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm) infestation.
Haemolysis screen (including reticulocyte count): may be abnormal in e.g.
DIC, EBV, viral haemorrhagic fever, E. coli 0157 gastroenteritis,
rickettsial infections, dengue, gas gangrene. Haptoglobin levels can be
useful ( Biochemical tests (p286)).
Monospot test (Paul Bunnell test): diagnostic of EBV infection.
Sickling test: uncovers sickle cell disease, known to be associated with
Salmonella osteomyelitis, chronic leg ulcers, etc.

282 Thrombocytopenia: characteristic in some conditions, e.g.

HIV disease,

Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

Vitamin B12 levels: reduced in Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm)
infestation, tuberculosis of the terminal ileum, etc.

Radiology
Plain x-rays
2 Chest: the potential diagnoses are legion. They include pneumonia, TB ,
pleural effusion/empyema, bronchiectasis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), tropical eosinophilia and other parasite-related diseases
(e.g. paragonimiasis), occupational risks for infections (e.g. silicosis and
TB), post-varicella calcification.
2 Plain abdominal x-ray: e.g. bowel dilatation, perforation, calcification
of adrenal glands and lymph nodes (e.g. TB, histoplasmosis), babies
head sign of schistosomal bladder calcification.
2 Dental radiological studies: occult dental sepsis.

Elsewhere: e.g. limbs for osteomyelitis, skeletal muscles for calcified
cysticercosis lesions, joints for Charcot changes (such as in syphilis).
ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography): an upper
gastrointestinal endoscopic approach, using contrast medium and radiographs to define the anatomy of the biliary tree and pancreatic duct.
Useful for HIV-associated biliary tree disease (including porta hepatis
nodal lymphoma), parasites (e.g. Clonorchis sinensis, Ascaris lumbricoides)
and pancreatic disease such as tuberculosis.
IVP (IVU, intravenous pyelography or urography): defines the renal
anatomy. Renal infection such as pyelonephritis, renal calculi, malignancy or anatomical abnormalities (including congenital) leading to
recurrent infections.

More sophisticated imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including with contrast enhancement
2 Cranial: variant CJD or V CJD (exhibits bilateral pulvinar high signal),
encephalitis, rabies, sagittal sinus thrombosis.
2 Elsewhere in the body: defining solid lesions, fluid-filled lesions, etc.
2 MRCP (MRI utilised with ERCP ): further defines the hepatopancreaticbiliary tree anatomy.
Computed tomography (CT) including with contrast enhancement
2 Cranial: e.g. brain abscess, paranasal sinus disease, middle ear disease,
orbital sepsis, cysticercosis, mastoid air cells.
2 Chest: e.g. cardiac lesions (possibly with associated endocarditis risk),
mediastinum (e.g. lymphadenopathy, including retrosternal), lung
lesions such as bronchiectasis, lung abscess, other non-infectious
pathologies.
2 Abdomen: delineates intra-abdominal abscesses and abnormalities in
retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes, defects in the spleen,
liver, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas and pelvis.
2 Spiral CT scan: e.g. useful for defining pulmonary emboli as a cause of
PUO.
Ultrasound
2 Abdomen: evidence of pancreatic, liver, renal and biliary tree/gallbladder abnormalities (e.g. abscess, hepatic cyst, presence or absence
of spleen, ascites, gallstones, etc.).
2 Thoracic: pleural effusion, empyema (can assist with drainage).
2 Echocardiography: to help exclude the cardiac vegetations of endocarditis, TB pericarditis (with effusion), myocarditis. Note that both
transthoracic and transoesophageal (TOE) approaches are available,
each yielding data of differing value in different situations.
2 Doppler studies of blood vessels: to exclude deep vein thrombosis
(DVT), such as in the legs.
2 Biopsy: to specifically pick out an area for sampling, e.g. liver lesion,
lymph node, mediastinal mass.
2 Drainage: to specifically pick out an area for draining, e.g. liver abscess,
pleural effusion.

283

Radionuclide scanning
2 Indium (111 In)-labelled granulocyte scan: helps localise many infectious
or inflammatory processes (i.e. deep sepsis).
2 Technetium bone scan: bone and joint sepsis.
2 Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scan: to exclude pulmonary embolus as
cause of PUO, to delineate consolidation, abscess, bronchiectasis, etc.
PET (positron emission tomography)
2 Has enormous potential for locating localised infective processes,
especially in the brain. Limited availability at time of writing.

Gastrointestinal tract investigations
Biopsy-based
Duodenal biopsy (Crosby capsule and endoscopic methods,  electron
microscopy): e.g. Whipples disease, giardiasis, cryptosporidium, strongyloidiasis.
Gastric biopsy: Helicobacter pylori.
Laparoscopy: useful to exclude tuberculosis and other infections in the
presence of ascites (biopsies should be sent for both histology and for
culture and sensitivity). ( Culture techniques (p270)).
Liver biopsy:

Tissue biopsy and deep aspiration specimens (p287).

Oesophageal biopsy: e.g. candidiasis, cytomegalovirus (e.g. in advanced
HIV disease).
Sigmoidoscopy and bowel biopsy: e.g. amoebiasis, pseudomembranous
colitis (Clostridium difficile infections), exclusion of idiopathic colitis and
Crohns Disease.
GI contents-based

284 Baermann concentration technique: the method of choice for the
detection of Strongyloides stercoralis.

Duodenal aspirate: e.g. giardiasis, cryptosporidium, strongyloidiasis.
Enterotest (string test): e.g. giardiasis, cryptosporidium, strongyloidiasis.
Hot stools:

Culture techniques (p270).

Salivary amylase: mumps.
Stool culture and sensitivity:

Culture techniques (p270).

Stool microscopy: for ova, cysts, parasites (e.g. for protozoa such as
amoebae, helminths such as Ascaris lumbricoides).
Stool electron microscopy: especially good for viruses, such as rotavirus.
Stool chromatography: Clostridium difficile toxin
Sellotape (adhesive) strip test: for the threadworm, Enterobius vermiformis.
To perform this test, roll some clear adhesive tape around 4 fingers of a
hand, sticky side out, while an assistant spreads the buttocks. In good
lighting, identify the involved perianal area, and apply the with tape 12
times to the affected perianal area. Place the tape on a slide with the clean
side downwards, trim the tape, label the slide and send to the laboratory.

5 Infectious & tropical diseases
Toxin tests: the definite diagnosis of botulism is the examination of
faeces for the organism and toxin (EMG is also helpful): Clostridium
difficile, E. coli 0157.
GI tract function
D-xylose absorption test: for malabsorption syndromes, such as
Whipples disease and tropical sprue.

Immunology
Immunology is a rapidly advancing field. Some immunological tests are
very valuable in the assessment of patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity
tests are dealt with elsewhere ( Other tests (p291)).
Complement (especially terminal complements C5 to C9): deficiencies
lead to a tendency to recurrent meningococcal sepsis, pneumococcal
disease, etc.
Differential white cell count ( Haematology (p281)): neutropenia is
associated with bacterial sepsis.
Immune globulins: deficiencies lead to recurrent infections (some cases
may be hereditary). Levels may also be 4IgM tends to be high in
brucellosis, malaria, trypanosomiasis and toxoplasmosis.
Splenic dysfunction: indicated by a history of surgical removal (this may
not always be clear!) or of a condition associated with hyposplenism
(e.g. coeliac disease/dermatitis herpetiformis), an abnormal blood film, 285
and an absent spleen on abdominal imaging. This state may be
associated with recurrent meningococcal infection and life-threatening
pneumococcal sepsis. Once diagnosed, the patient will need
appropriate vaccinations and advised to always carry a warning card
and/or wear a MedicAlert bracelet or similar.
T cell subsets: the absolute CD4+ (T4) cell count and the CD4+/CD8+
(T4/T8) cell ratio is of value. HIV disease, tuberculosis and sarcoidosis
are associated with reduced CD4+ cell levels, HIV with a reversed
CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio. Underlying lymphoma may be hinted at by
suggestive cell markers.
Cytokine studies: these are currently experimental but the field is
gathering pace.

Biochemical tests
A number of biochemical tests are useful in the diagnosis and assessment
of a range of infectious illnesses.

a-fetoprotein (AFP): 44 in hepatocellular carcinoma (associated with
HCV and HBV). Note: Much higher AFP than in other causes of
hepatocellular damage.
Arterial blood gases: assessment of sepsis, assessment of pneumonia.
CA-125: 4 in peritoneal tuberculosis.

C-reactive protein (CRP): together with the ESR, a valuable method for
monitoring infections (although it is elevated in connective tissue
conditions and neoplastic disease). CRP is an acute phase reactant, 4 in
bacterial infections and reduced in viral infections.
Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level: 4 in Legionella pneumophila
infection1. Also raised with zidovudine (AZT) usage in HIV disease.
Glucose metabolism: diabetes mellitus is a common association of
infection. Consider performing a fasting glucose level, an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) or checking haemoglobin A1c levels.
Haptoglobin levels: part of the haemolysis screen ( Haematology
(p282)). Iron levels (serum iron), total iron binding capacity (TIBC): iron
5 (TIBC 4) in iron deficiency, such as that associated with hookworm
infestation of the bowel (Ancyclostoma duodenale, Necator americanus) or
Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis. Serum ferritin may be helpful.
Lactate levels: may be 4 in the HIV-associated mitochondrial toxicity
syndrome. Also high in severe sepsis syndrome.
Lipid abnormalities (cholesterol, triglycerides): HIV drug toxicity.
Liver function tests: abnormalities are present in many conditions, e.g.
hepatitis, leptospirosis, yellow fever, antimicrobial drug toxicity (e.g. in
tuberculosis).
2 Alkaline phosphatase (AP ): in the serum of healthy adults, AP mostly originates from the liver (in children and adolescents, growing bone is a
significant source). Biliary obstruction, which is often associated with
286 2 sepsis, leads to an increase in the serum concentration of AP.
Bilirubin: determination of the bilirubin levels (and the relative levels of
conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin) is of great importance in the
differential diagnosis of jaundice.
2 gGT: an increase in the serum concentration of GT is the most sensitive indicator of liver damage.
Pancreatic amylase level: 4 with pancreatitis in e.g. mumps (consider
also salivary amylase), toxicity with antiretroviral drugs (e.g.
dideoxyinosine or DDI).
Pleural fluid analysis: analysis for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are
useful (as well as albumin, total protein and amylase). An exudate, which
implies infection in the differential diagnosis, is defined by at least one of
the following criteria: pleural fluid/serum total protein ratio >0.5, pleural
fluid/serum LDH ratio >0.6, or pleural fluid LDH >two-thirds of upper
limits of normal of serum LDH.
Pregnancy test: some infections, such as varicella, genital herpes
(simplex) and tuberculosis, are often more serious in pregnancy. The
use of some antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines, is
relatively contra-indicated in pregnancy.

5 Infectious & tropical diseases
Serum Na+ levels: hyponatraemia is strongly associated with
Legionnaires disease1.
Synacthen test: tuberculosis and histoplasmosis can damage the adrenal
glands, leading to an Addisonian state.
Vitamin D levels: if deficient, this may lead to difficulties with resolving
tuberculosis infections (consider checking levels in patients with dark
skins, especially those with a culture of wearing clothing over most of
their skin).

aspects. Med J Aust 160, 274277.

Tissue biopsy & deep aspiration
specimens
Whatever part of the anatomy they are taken from, biopsy specimens
should be evaluated both histopathologically (with specialised stains used
wherever appropriate) and by culture for bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi,
viruses and prions (utilising specialised culture techniques where appropriate).
Bone marrow biopsy
Haematology (p281). Important for tuberculosis, brucellosis, typhoid,
leishmaniasis.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
While the main objective of a lumbar puncture is usually to obtain fluid
for microscopy, culture and sensitivity, there are numerous other useful
tests that can be performed. The opening pressure should be between
1020cmH2Oinfective and other processes will alter this. While the
usual approach to obtaining CSF is through a lumbar puncture, if the
pressure is high a cisternal puncture can be performed instead. In
neonates, foramenal puncture is a possibility.
Along with the Gram-staining process and microscopy, other tests to consider include a complete blood cell count and differential, measurement of
glucose and protein levels, Ziehl-Nielsen staining for tuberculosis, and
bacterial, mycobacterial, viral and fungal cultures. On occasions, other
tests that might be considered include:
2 A wet mount (for amoebae such as Acathamoeba;
Culture techniques
(p270)).
2 PCR for herpes simplex virus, herpes varicella-zoster and enteroviruses
( Molecular diagnostics (p234, 279)).
2 Antibodies to specific pathogens (viruses such as arboviruses;
Serology (p265)).
2 An India ink capsule stain (for cryptococcosis).

Cryptococcal antigen ( Serology (p265)).
VDRL for syphilis ( Serology (p265)).
14-3-3 protein, a specific protein marker present in the CSF of patients
with vCJD.
Xanthochromia to help exclude subarachnoid haemorrhage.
Cytology to help exclude carcinomatous meningitis.
Assessing comparative CSF protein-cellular levels if Guillain-Barr syndrome (a recognised association of infections such as Campylobacter gastroenteritis) is being considered.

Liver biopsy
This procedure is very useful for many reasons. The indications are
numerous and include assessment of viral hepatitis (especially HBV and
HCV, including possible cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma), assessment of PUO (including tuberculosis) and determining if a patient has a
medication-induced liver disease. On less than 1% of occasions does the
liver biopsy overestimate the amount of hepatic damage.
The biopsy is commonly preceded by an ultrasound examination of the
liver to determine the best and safest biopsy site. Sometimes the biopsy is
conducted under ultrasonic guidance. Coagulation status should be
optimal at the time of biopsying.

Assessing Hepatitis C
(HCV)
1. Counsel and test for
antibodies to HCV.

288

2. If antibody-positive,
test blood for HCV RNA
(the hepatitis C PCR
test)
3. If PCR-positive, organise liver
ultrasound and biopsy, and check hepatic
enzymes and coagulation profile.
Histology looks at inflammation, focal
necrosis, bridging necrosis and fibrosis,
and the histological appearance is scored,
e.g. Knodell score (X/22).

5. If score is low (e.g. Knodell
score < 6/22), observe patient
regularly, watch HCV RNA levels,
re-biopsy liver at 23 years.

Vaccinate against HBV & HAV.
Watch -fetoprotein levels.

4. If score is high (e.g. Knodell
score  6/22), consider treatment
for HCV. Vaccinate against HBV & HAV.

Fig. 5.9

The risks of the traditional liver biopsy (not performed under ultrasound
guidance) include: 2 pain (1 in 5 patients) 2 haemorrhage (1 in 500
patients) 2 bleeding to such an extent that a patient may require transfusions or surgery (1 in 1000 patients) 2 pneumothorax and/or puncture of
the gallbladder, kidney or bowel (1 in 1000 patients) 2 death (1 in 5000
patients) ( http://pages.prodigy.com/hepc/hepc6.htm). Equivalent figures are
not currently available for ultrasonic-guided liver biopsy, but the technique
is well established.

5 Infectious & tropical diseases
Liver biopsy material should always be subjected to microbiological
culture as well as to histological assessment.
Lymph node sampling
The likely pathologies depend upon whether or not the lymphadenopathy
is regional or generalised, and upon the site.
Biopsy: for histology and culture, especially for tuberculosis, for tropical
infections such as chancroid, and for other relevant infections such as the
cat scratch fever agent, Bartonella henselae. If regional, the differential
diagnosis varies with the site; if intra-abdominal, for example, TB, Yersinia
enterocolitica and adenovirus will come into the picture.
Fine needle aspirate (FNA): generally as useful as full biopsy for culture
purposes, but no structural information available (similar to the aspirate
vs. trephine issue in bone marrow sampling; Haematology (p281)).
Respiratory samples
Sputum tests
2 Microscopy: can perform direct microscopy (e.g. for Aspergillus spp., eggs
of paragonimiasis), Gram stain, ZN, PCP (silver staining needed).
2 Induced sputum: e.g. for TB , PCP .
2 Tracheal aspirate: used in ill individuals. May produce similar material.
Bronchoscopy
2 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL ): useful for TB and other mycobacteria,
PCP, fungi, melioidosis, resistant bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas), RSV,
paragonimiasis. Lung biopsy: useful for TB and other mycobacteria, PCP
(needs silver staining), fungi, melioidosis, resistant bacteria (e.g.
Pseudomonas), RSV paragonimiasis.
Open lung biopsy
2 When it is not feasible to obtain intrathoracic tissue by less invasive
means.
Pleural disease: effusion, empyema, biopsy
Consider e.g. tuberculosis, pneumococcal sepsis, underlying neoplasm
(and rarer conditions, like strongyloidiasis, which will come up from time
to time). Biochemical analysis of pleural fluid can help ( Biochemistry
(p286)). An empyema will have a high white cell count, a high protein, a
low pH, LDH changes compatible with an exudate, and, possibly, organisms visible and/or culturable within the fluid. A pleural biopsy can be
obtained with an Abrahams needle, but pleuroscopy may have developed
into a better option in recent times.
 http://blue.temple.edu/~pathphys/pulmonary/pleural_disease.html

Skin biopsy
Biopsy and hair sampling
2 Useful in numerous ways, including e.g. TB , Kaposis sarcoma (caused
by HHV-8 and associated with HIV), onchocerciasis (see below), the
aetiology of warts (common viral warts versus molluscum contagiosumthe distinction can be important in view of the therapeutic

289

2

options and the potential for malignant change in some sites, such as
the female cervix).
The identification of pathogenic arthropod parasites, such as myiasis
(the invasion and feeding on living tissues of humans or animals by
dipterous larvae, such as that of the tumbu fly), scabies, lice, ticks and
chigger fleas, depends on the offending agent being seen and correctly
recognised or the appropriate specimen (e.g. excision biopsy) being
taken and examined histologically.

Skin snips
2 Filarial infestations: examination of skin snips will identify microfilariae
of Onchocerca volvulus and Mansonella streptocerca. Skin snips can be
obtained using a corneal-scleral punch, or more simply a scalpel and
needle. The sample must be allowed to incubate for 30min to 2h in
saline or culture medium, and then examined microscopically for
microfilariae that would have migrated from the tissue to the liquid
phase of the specimen.
 http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Filariasis.asp?body=Frames/A-F/Filariasis/body_Filariasis_page2.htm

Nodulectomy is also of value, as is examination of the eye with a slit lamp.
2 Leprosy: acid-fast bacilli are present in the skin.
2 Ebola virus: These have diagnostic value.
 http://www.uct.ac.za/microbiology/promed21.htm

Other tissues and collections are numerous and include
2 Bone infection/abscess/osteomyelitis: consider e.g. pyogenic sepsis, TB ,
atypical mycobacteria, sickle cell disease, ectopic ova of schistosomiasis. The history is important, e.g. with a history of fight trauma to a
hand, anaerobic bony infection may be more likely.

toxoplasmosis (in HIV infection).
Cervix: HPV.
Joint infections: aspirate synovial fluid and consider e.g. pyogenic sepsis,
TB. An acute attack of gout (diagnosed through identifying the birefringent crystals of sodium urate) can mimic an acute infective arthritis and
should be excluded.

B, obstruction of biliary tree by Ascaris lumbricoides or liver flukes such
as Clonorchis sinensis.
Muscle biopsy:
 Cardiac: may point towards a myocarditis or Chagas disease.
 Skeletal: may be used to identify parasites, including e.g. trichinosis,
cysticercosis.
Nerve biopsy: peripheral nerve biopsy (e.g. posterior auricular nerve)
may reveal tuberculoid leprosy.
Ocular:
 Vitreous humor: e.g. intraocular infections, including fungal, HSV,
HVZ, pyogenic bacterial.

Paranasal sinus aspirates: e.g. bacteria, fungal (such as mucomycosis).
Pericardial biopsy: particularly important for establishing a diagnosis in
a chronic pericarditis, e.g. tuberculosis, fungal.
Peritoneal infection: via laparoscopic tissue sampling and ascites sampling ( Gastrointestinal tract investigations (p284)).
Splenic aspiration: useful in the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (kalaazar) by microscopic examination and culture and demonstration of
the organism.

Other tests
Dermatological tests
2 Tuberculosis skin tests: measure delayed hypersensitivity. The Mantoux
test usually involves the intradermal injection of 10 tuberculin units of
purified protein derivative (PPD), and the response is quantified. The
reaction is read at 4872h. They are most useful epidemiologically,
their individual clinical value being relatively limited. Multiple puncture
techniques (the Heaf and Tine tests) are likely to be more convenient
for large group study.
2 Casoni test: an immediate hypersensitivity skin test employed to detect
sensitisation to hydatid antigen (Echinococcus granulosus). No longer
used.
2 Histoplasmin test: a positive intradermal skin reaction to histoplasmin
291
(the histoplasmin test) may be the only sign of past infection with
Histoplasma capsulatum. The main value is epidemiological. A similar
skin test exists for Coccidioides immitis.
2 Mazzotti (DEC ) test: for filariasis. This test relied on the intense pruritic response induced by microfilariae after treatment with the antifilarial agent diethylcarbamazine (DEC). Used in a minute quantity, it can
nevertheless be associated with side effects, ranging from mild discomfort, fever, headaches and intolerable pruritus to tachypnoea, tachycardia, and even pulmonary oedema. Pre-treatment with antihistamines
and corticosteroids may lessen the discomfort. Rarely used now.
2 Schick test: for assessing susceptibility to diphtheria. A small amount of
diphtheria toxin is injected into the skin; in individuals with low levels
of specific antibody the injection will produce an area of redness and
swelling, indicating that vaccination is needed. When the patient is
immune to diphtheria, serum antibody to diphtheria toxin will neutralise the injected toxin, and no skin reaction will develop. The test is
hardly used.
2 Skin testing for antibiotic allergy: this can be performed in the same
way as for other allergens.

Ophthalmology
2 Slit lamp examination: in the hands of an expert, this technique can
help with the diagnosis of infective and parasitic ocular problems, e.g.
uveitis (syphilis, Reiters syndrome), Onchocerca volvulus larvae, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, candidiasis.
Cardiac
2 Electrocardiography (ECG ): serial ECG s can be of value in rheumatic
fever, pericarditis, myocarditis and toxic shock syndrome. The ECG is
also of value in conditions where the cardiac conduction mechanism
has been damaged, such as in Chagas' disease (American trypanosomiasis) and with a valve root abscess in severe infective endocarditis. In
cholera and enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid), the cardiac rate
will often be slower than one might anticipate for the degree of fever.
2 Echocardiography:
Radiology (p282).
Neurological
EEG: may help with making a diagnosis of encephalitis (e.g. in patients
with HSV encephalitis, the EEG may exhibit focal unilateral or bilateral
periodic discharges localised in the temporal lobes), of brain abscess or
of cerebral cysticercosis. It may also be of value in VCJD.
2 Lumbar puncture: material for culture and sensitivity can be obtained,
but much additional information is also gathered, for example, the
opening pressure is usually elevated in infections ( Tissue biopsy &
deep aspiration specimens (p287)).
2 EMG : offers rapid bedside confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of botulism. It shows a pattern of brief, small, abundant motor unit potentials. In Guillain-Barr syndrome (a recognised association of infections
such as Campylobacter gastroenteritis), the EMG is helpful with
excluding primary muscle disease.
2 Nerve conduction studies: helpful with diagnosing neuropathies (e.g.
HIV, leprosy, Guillain-Barr syndrome).
2

292

Pulmonary
2 Pulmonary function tests: bronchial hypereactivity can be assessed for
(often provoked by infection) and interstitial lung disease checked for
(which can include, for example, tuberculosis, fungal infections, etc.).
Narcotics and anabolic steroids screen
If positive, these may point towards occult drug use and a concomitant
risk of blood-borne viruses (HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis B). VCJD has
been transmitted through anabolic steroid injecting.

2

Antibiotic plasma concentration monitoring
Some drugs are toxic if the plasma levels rise too high and their use is
futile if the levels are too low (indeed, this may promote the development of resistant bacteria, etc.). Monitoring serum drug levels ensures
that plasma drug levels remain within the therapeutic range.
Antimicrobial drugs that may require this approach include gentamicin,
netilmicin, vancomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, cycloserine, amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine,
ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole.

Clinical investigation in action
Endocarditis
Endocarditis is a deep-seated infection that behaves like a deep-seated
abscessindeed, an abscess can form adjacent to an infected cardiac valve
or shunt. The diagnosis of endocarditis involves thoughtful clinical assessment, including whether or not there is a history of injecting drug use, and
requires multiple blood cultures and cardiac assessment. Assess clinically
for likelihood, e.g. background of injecting drug use, congenital heart
disease, prosthetic valves, rheumatic fever, scarlet fever. May manifest
changing cardiac murmurs over a period of time, as well as a number of
additional signs.

Tuberculosis
Consider pulmonary versus extrapulmonary disease and other epidemiological parameters, and factor into the assessment.
2 Establish diagnosis/aetiology:
1 radiological evidence (depends on what sites are, or appear to be,
involvedcan generate hard or soft data),
2 bodily fluids (e.g. sputum, early morning urines, gastric washings)

Fig. 5.10 Caseating granulomata are the principle histological feature of
tuberculosis together with acid-fast bacilli (detected using the Ziehl-Neelsen
stain). In any tissue affected by tuberculosis, caseating garanulomata may be
present and are accordingly of immense assistance diagnostically.
2

Prevention: notify cases to public health authorities. Contact tracing.

iTuberculosis and biopsies: in any biopsy of any tissue, the possibility of
extrapulmonary TB should be borne in mind. If histology is performed,
caseating granulomata may be seen, and appropriate staining for acid-fast
bacilli (such as the Ziehl-Neelsen stain) may reveal the presence of TB
organisms. Wherever possible, appropriate cultures for TB should also be
set up, both for diagnostic and for drug sensitivity purposes. Molecular
techniques, including gene probes and PCR, will increasingly augment the
diagnostic armoury for TB in the future.
Malaria (fever in the returning traveller)
Always consider malaria in the febrile individual returning from overseasa detailed geographical history and malaria prophylaxis history is
essential. Always consider the possibility of a coexistent second diagnosis
(especially in P. falciparum infestation), such as Salmonella septicaemia (socalled algid malaria).

2 haemoglobinopathyassess for sickle cell disease,
3 assess the very ill patient thoroughly for possible cerebral malaria
(includes LFTs, blood film for haemolysis, coagulation status, CXR,
ECG, arterial blood gases, glucose levels, lactate levels, etc.). Note
that severe falciparum malaria can present as a diarrhoeal illness.
Assistance with therapy:
1 G6PD levels,
2 tests of hearingdeafness can occur with quinine.
Prevention: avoid blood donation.

Jaundice (acute)
Jaundice can be pre-hepatic, post-hepatic or a combination of both.
Epidemiological factors are important (drug injecting, travel, unsafe food,
unsafe sex, job, hobbies, vaccination history, alcohol, prescribed medications, herbal remedies, etc.). The patient may have a chronic liver disease
(e.g. hepatitis C) which has only just been recognised through an acute
exacerbation. Always remember Courvoisiers law (distended gall bladder
in a patient with obstructive jaundice means cancer) and Charcots triad (the
characteristic presentation of acute cholangitis, with biliary colic, jaundice
and spiking fevers with rigors). Haemolysis may lead to jaundice without 295
liver disease being present.

2 clotting screen,
3 -fetoprotein levelsmay suggest hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis C and hepatitis B infection.
Assistance with therapy:
1 HIV testingif appropriate: co-infection with HIV, HCV and HBV an
increasing problem world-wide,
2 ethanol assessmentGT levels, 4 MCV,
3 molecular tests: PCR testing for HCV, circulating DNA levels in
HBV,
4 antigenshepatitis B.
Prevention:
1 notify cases to public health authorities; safe sex education; safe
drug-injecting education possible once viral diagnosis of HCV, HBV
and/or HIV established,
2 assess family, sexual partners, etc. for possible infection (HIV, HBV,
HCV) and/or need to vaccinate (HBV),
3 vaccination strategies: HBV, HAV as appropriate.

Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea can be acute versus chronic, or acute on chronic. For example,
a gastroenteritis illness may uncover pre-existing inflammatory bowel
disease, such as Crohns disease, or malabsorption (such as coeliac disease
or pancreatic insufficiency). Drugs such as opiates can lead to overflow
diarrhoea. Also bear in mind that where there is one bowel pathogen,
another one might be present. Antibiotic resistance is common among
some bowel pathogens. Diarrhoea can appear infective, but, for example,
might be endocrine in origin (e.g. carcinoid syndrome, Zollinger-Ellison
syndrome, medullary carcinoma of thyroid), while the possibility of bowel
cancer must always be borne in mind. Note that the presence of
Streptococcus bovis in blood cultures is ALWAYS highly indicative of the pres296 ence of a bowel cancer until proven otherwise. Irritable bowel disease is
being increasingly diagnosed. Malaria can present as diarrhoea (see earlier).
2 Establish diagnosis:
1 examine stools,
2 keep stool chart on ward.
2 Establish aetiology:
1 stool culture and sensitivity,
2 stool microscopy for ova, cysts and parasites,
2 sigmoidoscopy and biopsy,

4 staphylococcal enterotoxin (food poisoning),
6 string test,
7 malabsorption screen including antigliadin/antiendomysial antibodies,
8 serology for Yersinia, amoebic, strongyloidiasis, typhoid.
2 Assess clinical status:
1 haematology: white cell count,

5 deficiencies: with problems where malabsorption is a possible
problem, vitamin, iron, etc. deficiency, etc. must be investigated.
Assistance with therapy: antibiotic sensitivity testing.
Prevention: notify cases to public health authorities; isolate as necessary.

Pneumonic illness
Pneumonia is multi-aetiological. If recurrent, this throws up certain diagnostic possibilities that must be considered. Many epidemiological considerations are important, such as travel history, occupation, pet keeping,
hobbies, sexual activity, etc. Oslers triad of rigors, pleuritis and rustcoloured sputum is said to be characteristic of pneumococcal pneumonia.

Assess clinical status:
1 arterial blood gases,

3 pulmonary function tests if appropriate.
Assistance with therapy:
1 antibiotic sensitivity testing,
2 if recurrent: consider tuberculosis testing (see earlier), HIV testing,
immunoglobulin levels (to check for deficiency), assessing for hyposplenism, checking terminal complement levels (C5C9).
Prevention:
1 notify appropriate cases to public health authorities (e.g. Legionella,
tuberculosis); isolate as necessary,
2 vaccination strategies: influenza, Pneumococcus, Haemophilus
influenzae B (HiB),
3 cessate smoking if relevant.

Meningitic illness (headache and photophobia)
Meningitis can be extremely serious, particularly bacterial, mycobacterial,
fungal and protozoal forms, but viral meningitis is generally less serious.
Meningitic infection is often mimicked by much less serious infections,
such as urinary tract infection (especially in women), throat infections
(ASO, monospot), atypical pneumonias and sinusitis (especially ethmoidal,
sphenoidal). A similar picture can also be generated by a subarachnoid
haemorrhage. Meningococcal infection can be life-threatening without

297

ever causing meningitis. If a bacterial meningitis is recurrent, certain diagnostic possibilities must be considered. Brain abscess (think of injecting
drug use, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency, etc.) and, under
certain circumstances, encephalitis can present in a similar fashion to
meningitic illnesses. Where the patient has a marked petechial rash and a
history of travel to Africa, Ukraine or South America, even viral haemorrhagic fever (particularly the Congo-Crimean variety) comes into the
picture.

Establish diagnosis/aetiology:
1 lumbar puncture (LP)/cisternal puncture/foramenal puncture (in
neonates): for CSF pressure, microscopy, bacterial and mycobacterial culture (including special cultures, e.g. for Listeria), viral culture,
biochemistry (e.g. protein, glucose), differential cell count, viral
PCR, xanthochromia, India ink stain, cryptococcal antigen testing,
2 CT scan of head: sometimes necessary to help exclude raised
intracranial pressure prior to performing LP (cisternal puncture and
foramenal puncture possible in skilled hands); to exclude paranasal
sinusitis, mastoiditis, brain abscess,
3 CXR and assessment for atypical pneumonia if appropriate (see
earlier),
4 NPA (see earlier),
5 petechial rash sampling: aspirate material from a fresh purpuric
lesion using a small-needle insulin syringe, and culture,
6 molecular: meningococcal PCR (blood and CSF), pneumococcal
PCR (blood and CSF),
7 serology: urine and blood for cryptococcal antigen; blood for pneumococcal antigen; urine for mumps antigen; ASO, antibodies to
EBV, Cryptococcus,
8 nasopharyngeal swab for meningococcus,
9 stool for enteroviral culture,
10monospot test for EBV.
Assess clinical status:
1 CT scan/MRI scan of head: assess for raised intracranial pressure,
exclude SAH (xanthochromia), sagittal vein thrombosis; exclude
skull fracture, especially of cribriform plate (this can lead to recurrent pneumococcal meningitisif there is a nasal drip, test fluid for
glucose to exclude presence of CSF as CSF contains glucose),

2 vaccination strategies: meningococcus A and C, pneumococcus,
influenza, HIB,
3 history of skull fracture: may need neurosurgery, etc.
Urethritis (with or without haematuria)
Pain on micturition can simply represent a urinary tract infection, or there
may be a sexually transmitted disease such as gonorrhoea present. More
exotic problems can be relevant to the case if the patient has been travelling. The sexual and travel history is therefore important. Renal calculi can
produce clinical pictures resembling infection, as can dermatological condition such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Urinary tract infections are
more common during pregnancy.

Red painful swollen lower leg
One of the most difficult things in medicine is to distinguish effectively
between a distal deep venous thrombosis and cellulitisand a combination of both! Sometimes the problem is in the tissues, and sometimes in

1. A detailed travel history
and a high index of suspicion
are essential in making the
diagnosis of VHF. A recent
travel history to an area
where one of these viruses
are known to be particularly
prevalent is suggestive,
particularly Africa (e.g.
Uganda and Ebola, Nigeria
and Lassa) and South
America  the incubation
period ranges from 3 to 21 days,
depending upon the variety.
Many VHF cases presenting
together may suggest a
bioterrorism attack.

2. VHFs are severe febrile
illnesses that can be
complicated by a
haemorrhagic tendency,
petechiae, hypotension
(and even shock), flushing
of the face and chest, and
oedema. Constitutional
symptoms such as
headaches, myalgia,
vomiting and diarrhoea
may occur. Some VHFs
manifest particular features
not shared by the others.

300

5. Almost always, the true
diagnosis will not be a VHF,
but they must be considered
where appropriate. Strict
adherence to isolation and
infection control precautions
has prevented secondary
transmission in almost all cases.
Biohazard

3. Once suspected, VHFs
are category 4 pathogens,
so precautions for
healthcare workers must
be instituted and the case
notified to the proper
authorities. Isolation
measures and barrier
nursing procedures are
indicated (Marburg,
Ebola, Lassa and CongoCrimean HF viruses may
be particularly prone to
aerosol nosocomial spread),
usually in a special infectious
diseases/tropical medicine
unit staffed with clinicians
with expertise in the field.
Intensive supportive care

the joints (even gout and pseudogout can look like cellulitis) or the bone
(osteomyelitis). Ulceration may be present on the legs. Venous and arterial insufficiency may complicate the pictureinfected legs in older people
can be very difficult to treat with antibiotics alone. Recent long-haul air
travel may point more towards thrombosis, but swollen legs with compromised veins easily get infected! Although rare, syphilis, yaws and
Mycobacterium ulcerans can cause leg ulcers that are potentially amenable
to treatment. Pyoderma gangrenosum can resemble infection of the leg,
but is associated with non-infectious systemic diseases.

Prevention:
1 treat diabetes if present,
2 treat other underlying conditions if present,

Vesicular rash
Many vesicular rashes are infective, many are not. In particular, the distribution of the rash should be carefully assessed and joint assessment and
management with a dermatologist is often valuable. If atopic, eczema herpeticum comes into the picture. Staphylococcal impetigo can cause vesiculation. If there is a relevant travel history, rickettsial pox and monkey pox
(and, if militarily-orientated, even smallpox, a known bioterrorism candidate organism!) come into the picture. Erythema multiforme, which often
has an infective basis but can also be produced by medications, can
produce a vesiculating rash (so check the mouth, eyes and genitalia, and
determine the medication history). Non-infective blistering conditions
include dermatitis herpetiformis (coeliac disease), pompholyx and pemphigus.

Ambulatory electrocardiography
Clinical indications
The indications for ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) or Holter
monitoring have broadened with an increasing awareness of the importance of arrhythmias coupled with improved design of the available monitoring devices1. AECG recordings can be used to document the presence,
complexity or absence of arrhythmias, and their correlation with patientperceived symptoms. Documenting abnormalities of the ST segment in
patients with silent ischaemia and heart rate variability in the risk stratification of patients with CHD may also be clinically useful.
Indications for AECG recording include
Assessment of symptoms that may be related to disturbances of heart
rhythm
2 Altered consciousness (dizziness, pre-syncope, syncope, other neurological events).
2 Palpitation.
2 Intermittent breathlessness.
2 Unexplained chest pain.
2 Fatigue, sweating, etc.
Assessment of risk in patients without symptoms of arrhythmia
2 After myocardial infarction.
2 Congestive heart failure.
2 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
2 Systemic hypertension.
2 Pre-operative patient assessment.
2 Screening in other patients.
Efficacy of anti-arrhythmic therapy
2 Assessment of pacemaker and AICD function.
2 Monitoring for myocardial ischaemia.
2 Assessment of paediatric patients.

304 Contraindications
None. The use of AECG in asymptomatic patients or routine population
testing is not however recommended.
Patient preparation
With devices that require the application of skin electrodes, meticulous
preparation of the skin is important if high quality, artefact-free recordings
are to be obtained. The skin under the electrode should be shaved if necessary, abraded and cleansed with an alcohol swab in an attempt to
reduce the electrical resistance of the skin. The patient is supplied with a
diary for recording the temporal relationship and nature of symptoms
occurring during the AECG. Typically, a recording continues for 24h,
although continuing the recording for up to 72h can increase the yield.
Procedure
Conventional AECG recorders are battery powered, lightweight portable
devices that continuously record two or three bipolar leads on conventional magnetic cassette tape. More recently, solid-state memory devices
have begun to replace conventional tape technology which is prone to
jamming, tape stretch or fracture. Contemporary tape analysis systems are

6 Cardiology
computer based, and allow a trained technician to select segments of ECG
that demonstrate abnormalities of heart rhythm (Fig. 6.1) or the ST
segment which can be correlated with symptoms noted in the dairy by
means of an internal timing channel. Additional data generated by current
technology include automatic counts of abnormal beats, minimum and
maximum rates, incidence and duration of ST segment depression, etc.
Patient-activated event recorders (e.g. Cardiomemo) can be used where
symptomatic episodes are rare or infrequent; these usually involve a solidstate loop recording that can be transmitted by the patient to a central
(hospital-based) receiving station via a standard telephone line for later
analysis. Alternatively, implantable loop recorders (e.g. Reveal) are
inserted in a small subcutaneous pocket and can continuously monitor the
ECG for period of 12 years, without the need for additional electrodes;
these devices are particularly useful for discriminating between infrequent
episodes of cardiac or neurally mediated altered consciousness (e.g.
Stokes-Adams attacks vs. epilepsy).

Fig. 6.1

ECG showing ventricular tachycardia.

Possible results
Symptoms (e.g. dizziness, syncope) in association with an arrhythmia sufficient to reduce cardiac output and therefore cerebral perfusion allow the 305
patient to be offered specific targeted therapy (e.g. permanent pacing,
anti-arrhythmic medication). In the absence of symptoms or demonstrable
arrhythmia, it is important to persist with repeated, and if necessary more
prolonged, AECG testing. Consideration of using an alternative recording
method (e.g. Cardiomemo, Reveal device) may be appropriate. The yield
of the AECG in the patient presenting with syncope is low (~5%).
Palpitation accounts for 3050% of indications for outpatient AECG monitoring, with an arrhythmia documented in up to 45% of symptomatic
recordings. The identification of arrhythmias in high-risk subsets (e.g. postmyocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy) will determine the need
for further investigation (e.g. cardiac catheterisation, electrophysiological
testing) or treatment (e.g. AICD, drug therapy). Risk stratification following acute myocardial infarction can be improved by combining a
number of tests (e.g. echo-derived ejection fraction, AECG, SAECG, treadmill exercise test, etc.).
The AECG is a useful technique to detect and monitor myocardial
ischaemia using the analysis of ST segment changes. In that up to 80% of
episodes of myocardial ischaemia (ST segment 5) are asymptomatic, the

AECG is ideally suited to record such episodes, and contemporary play-

back machines can analyse and quantitate these changes automatically.
There remains doubt as to the importance of such changes when found in
the normal population.
Advantages over other tests
Cheap, simple and repeatable. The only method, other than chance
observation on a cardiac monitor, of correlating ECG findings and
symptoms.
Ancillary tests
In the investigation of the patient with possible arrhythmias, additional
treadmill exercise testing, tilt table testing or electrophysiological testing
may be helpful.
Pitfalls
Symptomatic correlation of abnormalities recorded on the AECG is an
important prerequisite of interpretation of the significance of abnormalities found on the recording. An appreciation of findings frequently seen in
a normal population is fundamental if an excess of false positive recordings are to be avoided. Normal findings include sinus bradycardia, particularly during sleep, with rates as low as 30 beats/min, sinus arrhythmia,
sinus arrest (with pauses of up to 3s), sinoatrial exit block, second-degree
AV (Wenckebach) block, wandering atrial pacemaker, junctional escape
rhythm, and premature atrial and ventricular ectopics. In an elderly population the criteria of normality are even broader.

Cardiac enzymes
306 Clinical indications
Cardiac enzymes (markers of myocardial damage) should be measured in
any patient presenting with prolonged (<15min) ischaemic sounding chest
pain. The management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS)
(Fig. 6.2), and the diagnostic criteria for acute myocardial infarction have
recently been redefined 14.
Indications for measurement of cardiac enzymes include
2 Patients presenting with ACS (unstable angina, non ST -segment elevation myocardial infarction, Q-wave myocardial infarction).
2 Patients presenting with chest pain when the diagnosis of ACS is in
doubt.
2 Routinely following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI ).
2 Routinely following surgical revascularisation (CABG ).
Procedure
Venous blood is drawn from the patient on presentation and at 12, 24, 48
and 72h after the onset of symptoms.

Possible results
Myocyte necrosis is detected biochemically when intracellular macromolecules leak from myocytes into the peripheral circulation. Myoglobin and
the creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB), both non-specific markers,
are released within 2h. CK-MB2, a subform (isoform) of CK-MB 5MHZ has
a higher sensitivity and specificity. The troponins (cTnT and cTnI) are part
of the calcium-sensitive apparatus that regulates the interaction of actin
and myosin within cardiac myocytes; troponins are specific for myocardial
cell injury but may not be detectable for 612h (Fig 6.2). Other classic
markers (AST, LDH) are unreliable and should not be used in the diagnosis 307
of myocardial damage.
The most sensitive early marker for myocardial infarction is CK-MB2
(91%) followed by myoglobin (78%), thus a normal CK-MB2 subform at 6h
reliably excludes infarction. At 10h, the cTnI sensitivity is 96% with a specificity of 93%.
Interpretation
The diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is usually
obvious from the appearance of the ECG, and is subsequently confirmed
by elevated cardiac enzymes. Formerly, a subgroup of high-risk patients
with unstable angina was recognized (also called minimal myocardial
damage) with elevated levels of cTnI and cTnT, but normal CK-MB. These
have now been reclassified as having sustained a non-ST-elevation
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). It is estimated that ~30% of patients presenting with ACS in the absence of ST elevation would previously have
been diagnosed as unstable angina, but have in fact suffered myocyte

necrosis (NSTEMI) using an elevation in cTnT (>0.1g/L) as the discriminator.
Advantages over other tests
Cardiac enzyme estimation allows risk stratification in patients presenting
with ACS and also determines the need for further inpatient investigation
(e.g. diagnostic coronary arteriography). When used in conjunction with
serial ECGs, cardiac enzyme elevation is diagnostic of acute myocardial
infarction.
Ancillary tests
The results of cardiac enzyme estimations should always be interpreted in
conjunction with the clinical history (including the presence of other
medical conditions) and serial 12-lead ECGs. Prognostic risk stratification
can be improved by combining enzyme estimation with risk factors and
findings on clinical examination (Figs. 3 & 4), or with the results of treadmill exercise testing ( pp314). Myocardial infarction can also be
detected by contrast ventriculography, myocardial perfusion imaging
( p561) and dobutamine stress echocardiography.
Pitfalls
Patients presenting very early following myocardial infarction may have
normal cardiac enzymes. Myoglobin and CK-MB may be detected as early
as 2h, but cTnI and cTnT may not be significantly increased for 12h.
Troponins may also be released in acute myocarditis, pericarditis and in
patients with renal failure. Diagnosis of reinfarction (or extension) may be
impossible if relying on the troponins alone as they may remain elevated
for up to 14 days after the initial attack.

Quantifying the severity of valve pathology in a patient undergoing
CABG.

Interventional procedures
2 Mitral balloon valvuloplasty.
2 Device closure (PFO , ASD , VSD ).
Contraindications
With experienced operators, there are few contraindications to TOE;
they include:
2 Oesophageal pathology:
 Stricture (undilated).
 Tumour.
 Tear, fistula, rupture.
 Severe oesophagitis.
 Varices.
2 Dysphagia of unknown origin.
2 Instability of the cervical vertebrae.
2 Uncooperative patient.
2 Fasting <4h (relative).
Patient preparation
Patients should be fasted for at least 4h. A detailed history is obtained
from the patient, including previous difficulties with swallowing, the presence of oesophageal or other upper gastrointestinal pathology, or drug
allergy. Dentures and other dental prostheses are removed, and intravenous access obtained. O2 saturation, ECG and blood pressure are monitored throughout the procedure, and full resuscitation facilities should be
available. The larynx is sprayed with xylocaine 4% and the patient is
sedated with intravenous midazolam (2.57.5 mg). Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for TOE.

311
Procedure
Following patient preparation, the TOE probe is introduced through the
pharynx and down the oesophagus via the mouth. Once the probe passes
the pharynx, passage through the oesophagus and on to the stomach is
usually achieved without difficulty. The TOE probe is interfaced with a
conventional cardiac ultrasound machine. In structure, the probe is somewhat similar to an endoscope, without the fibreoptic cables and suction
channel. Adult probes vary from 27 to 45cm in length, with a diameter of
1014mm. The ultrasound transducer is situated at the tip of the probe,
typically a 5mHZ multi-element array, capable of rotation, flexion, advance
and withdrawal. Images are recorded in standard views from the oesophagus and stomach.
Possible results
With the wide variety of indications for TOE, a detailed description of the
imaging results obtained is beyond the scope of this book. TOE is invaluable in the assessment of the patient with valvular heart disease (particularly those with infective endocarditis), identifying sources of systemic
embolism, confirmation of complex anatomy in congenital heart disease,

and the analysis of results from surgical procedures. Serial examinations
allow the natural history of a condition to be followed, and intervention to
be timed with confidence.
Interpretation
iTraining and accreditation in TOE is a necessary prerequisite to skilful
and safe performance. Operators should be skilled in TTE, and then introduced to the technique of oesphageal intubation. Specialist training in cardiology (UK) requires a minimum of 500 TTE and 75 TOE studies.
Advantages over other tests
TOE is the most sensitive test for detecting the source of systemic thromboembolism; despite the frequent request for a TTE, this investigation has
such a low sensitivity for this indication that such a request should be
declined. There are no competing techniques offering advantages in the
assessment of atrial and valvular pathology. Aortic pathology (e.g. dissection) can also be investigated using CT scanning ( pp521), MR scanning
( p522), or aortography. TOE offers high sensitivity and specificity,
portability, rapid acquisition speed, no contrast, no radiation and low cost
compared with the other imaging modalities, although this group of
patients requires a high degree of operator skill and expertise.
Pitfalls
Successful intubation and imaging is achieved in at least 98% of patients; an
inability to pass the probe is most commonly related to operator inexperience or lack of patient cooperation, rather than oesophageal pathology.
Major complications (death, oesphageal perforation, malignant arrhythmia,
congestive heart failure, laryngospasm) occur in less than 0.3% of patients,
and often result from the presence of unexpected oesphageal pathology
(e.g. tumour). Minor complications (transient hypoxia, hypotension, bronchospasm, arrhythmia) occur in less than 3% of patients.

Electrophysiological testing
Clinical indications
Electrophysiological (EP) testing is used as an adjunct to non-invasive tests
(e.g. resting and exercise electrocardiography, AECG) in the diagnosis of
arrhythmias, the assessment of drug and device therapy, and as an integral
part of therapeutic radiofrequency catheter ablation procedures1.
Indications for EP testing include:
Bradyarrhythmias: assessment in the following symptomatic patient
groups:
 Sinus node dysfunction.
 AV (His-Purkinje) block.
 Intraventricular conduction delay.
 Left or right bundle branch block.
 Guide to device therapy (permanent pacing).
2 Tachyarrhythmias:
 Narrow QRS complex tachycardia (e.g. atrial flutter, AVRT,
AVNRT).
 Broad QRS complex tachycardia (e.g. VT).
2

6 Cardiology
 Non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. VPBs, non-sustained
VT).
 Prolonged QT syndrome.
 Unexplained syncope.
 Survivors of cardiac arrest (near-miss sudden death).
 Guide to drug therapy.
 Guide to device therapy (AICD).
 During radiofrequency ablation.
Contraindications
EP testing is not indicated in patients in whom more simple tests (e.g.
ECG, AECG) have documented an abnormality that correlates with symptoms or is in itself worthy of intervention. EP testing is rarely indicated in
asymptomatic patients unless there is a significant family history (e.g.
arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia).
Patient preparation
EP testing in adults is usually undertaken with a combination of sedation
and local anaesthesia. As the procedures may be prolonged (>6 h), intravenous access should be available for rehydration. In the absence of an
indwelling arterial line, non-invasive blood pressure is monitored, together
with oxygen saturation via a finger probe. EP procedures are performed in
a fully equipped (preferably bi-plane) cardiac catheterization laboratory
with experienced personnel, full resuscitation facilities, and a computerbased EP machine capable of displaying and storing data.
Procedure
Under fluoroscopic guidance, multipolar electrode catheters are introduced into the heart via the femoral and/or the subclavian vein (Fig. 6.3).
Electrodes are positioned adjacent to various structures within the cardiac
chambers to record local electrical activity. Signals from multiple leads are
recorded simultaneously to demonstrate the activation sequence and to
determine the effect of extra stimuli on the genesis of arrhythmias. Once 313
an arrhythmia is induced, the activation sequence can be mapped with a
view to radiofrequency accessory pathway ablation or modification.

Fig. 6.3

Intracardiac electrodes.

Possible results
By measuring conduction times, refractory periods and the effects of extra
stimuli, atrial and ventricular pacing, the anatomic substrate for arrhythmias can be determined; for example, the presence of an AV nodal reentry pathway. Programmed electrical stimulation techniques are used to
determine the likelihood of an underlying ventricular arrhythmia causing
symptoms.
Advantages over other tests
The role of EP testing in the management of bradyarrhythmias is limited
and offers little over and above more simple investigations (e.g. AECG, tilt
testing). EP testing is unique in correlating electrical activity with intracardiac anatomy prior to therapeutic ablation. The initiation and termination
of ventricular arrhythmias determines the applicability of device technology (e.g. AICD) to a particular patient.
Ancillary tests
EP testing usually follows assessment by more simple investigations (e.g.
resting and exercise ECG, AECG). In many patients structural heart
disease is excluded or confirmed by means of echocardiography, MR
imaging, cardiac catheterization and coronary arteriography.
Pitfalls
EP testing now tends to be focused on identifying a specific problem,
which frequently involves identifying and treating an arrhythmia substrate
with guided radiofrequency catheter ablation. The limitations and reproducibility of tests of conduction and refractoriness, as well as extra stimulus and serial drug testing are well appreciated.

Exercise testing
314 Clinical indications
1

Exercise testing is the most frequent non-invasive test used in the assessment of the patient presenting with chest pain: more particularly, to determine the presence or absence of prognostically important coronary heart
disease. The exercise test should be regarded as a natural extension of the
clinical examination, allowing the physician to assess the overall physiological response to exercise including the appearance of the patient during
exercise, the time of onset and the development of symptoms, the
haemodynamic response to exercise, and observed changes on the ECG
provoked by exercise.
Indications for exercise testing include
2 Assessment of objective exercise tolerance.
2 Nature of symptoms limiting exercise (chest pain, fatigue, breathlessness, etc.).
2 Evaluation of haemodynamic response to exercise.
2 Document ST segment changes occurring with exercise or during the
recovery period.
2 Evaluation of exercise-induced arrhythmias.

Patient preparation
Patients are advised not to smoke, eat or drink for 3h prior to the test. In
most patients, cardioactive medication (e.g. b-blockers, calcium antagonists, long-acting nitrates) should be discontinued 48h before exercise
testing. Patients are advised to wear comfy clothes and shoes (e.g.
trainers).
Procedure
Both the bicycle ergometer and treadmill exercise testing have been used
in the assessment of cardiac patients; disadvantages of the bicycle include 315
an inability to cycle in some patients, premature muscle (quadriceps)
fatigue, and the relatively low level of exercise achieved. Most of the data
from cardiac patients relate to treadmill testing, using either the Bruce or
modified Bruce protocol (see table below). Treadmill testing is applicable
to a wide variety of patient groups including children and the elderly, and
it also allows the physician rather than the patient to control the time of
completion of the test, and therefore the amount of work achieved.
Exercise tests should be supervised by experienced personnel (e.g. technician, nurse practitioner, physician) trained in advanced cardiopulmonary
resuscitation. A resting supine and standing ECG is recorded, together
with the resting blood pressure. Exercise is increased in 3min increments,
with further recordings of the ECG, pulse rate and blood pressure up to
and including symptom-limited peak exercise. Further recordings are
made each minute during the recovery period until the ECG, heart rate
and blood pressure have fallen back to pre-test levels. The exercise test
laboratory should be equipped with full resuscitation equipment including
a defibrillator.

316

Possible results
In patients with significant coronary heart disease, myocardial ischaemia is
reflected in ST segment depression, defined as horizontal (planar) or
downsloping ST segments D1 mV (100mV) or 1mm, 80ms after the J point
(Fig. 6.4). These changes are usually most apparent in the lead with the
tallest R wave, commonly V5. Upsloping ST segment depression, J point
depression, changes in T wave morphology and rate-dependent aberrancy,
do not reliably indicate ischaemia. Other indicators of myocardial ischaemia
include ST segment elevation, pseudo-normalization of inverted T waves
and an increase in R wave amplitude; some patients also exhibit a flat heart
rate response to exercise (chronotropic incompetence).
Interpretation
The earlier and more dramatic the ST segment shift, the more severe the
coronary disease, especially if the ECG changes occur in association with
symptoms (chest pain) or a fall in blood pressure. For the identification of
coronary heart disease, a positive test (using ST segment depression of
D1 mV) has a specificity ~77% and a sensitivity of ~68% for identifying a
50% luminal obstruction of a coronary artery. Exercise testing is useful in

the identification of high-risk coronary disease, with a specificity of ~66%
and a sensitivity of ~81% for multivessel disease, and a specificity of ~53%
and a sensitivity of ~86% for left main stem disease. The prognostic value
of exercise testing early after acute myocardial infarction is well validated
with a poor exercise performance, ST segment depression at a low workload and an abnormal blood pressure response all indicators of an adverse
prognosis. Many contemporary treadmill machines offer additional parameters (e.g. ST/HR slope, ST/HR index), which may significantly increase
the sensitivity of the test.
The relationship between the level of ST segment depression deemed significant and the likelihood of CHD is shown in Fig. 6.5. If 2mm ST segment
depression is taken as positive, rather than the standard 1mm, the sensitivity of the test is reduced, but the specificity is increased.

317

Advantages over other tests
Cheap, simple, non-invasive, reproducible and applicable to a wide population.
Ancillary tests
The sensitivity and specificity of routine treadmill exercise testing can
be increased by combining exercise with myocardial scintigraphy;
or, alternatively, undertaking dobutamine stress echocardiography.
Pitfalls
In patient subsets with a low incidence of coronary heart disease
(e.g. routine testing in asymptomatic individuals including the normal
population, as part of an insurance medical, pilots, etc,), the number of
false positive responses become significant, thereby reducing the specificity of the test. False positive tests are also more common in young
women.
Causes of a false positive exercise test result
2 Systemic hypertension.
2 Aortic stenosis.
2 Cardiomyopathy.
2 Valve disease (e.g. mitral valve prolapse, mitral and aortic regurgitation).
2 Bundle branch block (LBBB , RBBB ).
2 Pre-excitation.
2 Hyperventilation.
2 Hypoglycaemia.
2 Hypokalaemia.
2 Drugs (e.g. digoxin).
2 Anaemia.
Most of the post-infarct exercise test data relate to the pre-thrombolytic
era; there is some doubt as to the validity of these studies in determining
prognosis with contemporary treatment.
Exercise testing is safe with a major complication rate of 0.03%

318 (including death from fatal myocardial infarction or cardiac rupture);

non-fatal events occur in ~0.09% (myocardial infarction, successful
resuscitation from VF), and complex arrhythmias including VT in 1.4%.
Complications are more common in patients studied earlier after
myocardial infarction.

Signal-averaged electrocardiography
Clinical indications
Risk stratification of patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction
in terms of likelihood of developing sustained ventricular arrhythmias.

6 Cardiology
Signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG)1 has also been used to
investigate the presence of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia in
patients with known coronary heart disease or cardiomyopathy and unexplained syncope.
Procedure
A resting ECG is recorded in the supine position using an ECG machine
equipped with a SAECG capability. Signal averaging improves the signal to
noise ratio when the signals are recurrent and the noise is random; hence
muscle potentials can be removed with appropriate filtering. The SAECG
is commonly used to interrogate late ventricular potentials, typically
125mV in amplitude, which are in continuity with, and follow, the QRS
complex (Fig. 6.6); these late potentials are thought to represent delayed
and fragmented ventricular activation which may be the substrate for
micro re-entry leading to ventricular arrhythmias.
Possible results
Late potentials may be recorded in 010% of normal volunteers, 1530%
of patients early after a myocardial infarction with ventricular tachycardia,
and in 5090% of patients with a myocardial infarction complicated by
ventricular tachycardia. Early use of thrombolytics may reduce the incidence of late potentials.
Interpretation
The prognostic value of the SAECG in defining risk for development of
ventricular tachycardia or sudden death following myocardial infarction
gives a sensitivity of ~72%, a specificity of ~75%, a positive predictive value
of ~20% and a negative predictive value of ~96%.

Swan-Ganz catheterisation
Clinical indications
Although the safety of bedside right heart catheterization has recently
been questioned1, the application and indications for the technique have
been confirmed by the American College of Cardiology2.
There is general agreement that bedside right heart catheterization is
warranted in the following:
2 Differentiation between haemodynamic and permeability pulmonary
oedema.
2 Determining the contribution of impaired cardiac output in the patient
with concomitant COPD.
2 Differentiation between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic shock when
volume expansion has failed or is considered to be high risk.

2

Right-sided endocarditis.
Mechanical tricuspid or pulmonary valve prosthesis.
Right heart tumour or thrombus visible on echocardiography.
Swan-Ganz catheterisation cannot be recommended in the routine
management of patients with:
 Heart failure.
 Acute myocardial infarction.
 Patients undergoing surgery.

Procedure
2

2

A 6F sheath is inserted into a central vein (e.g. subclavian, internal
jugular, femoral) over a guide wire similar to the technique used for
the insertion of a CVP line.
Prior to insertion through the sheath, the triple lumen (Swan-Ganz)
catheter is flushed with 0.9% saline and the balloon inflated to check
integrity (see instructions for use). Typical catheters have one lumen
for balloon inflation, and two lumens to measure pressure and obtain
blood samples (one at the tip of the catheter and one 2530cm more

proximal), together with a thermistor at the tip for measuring cardiac
output. Bedside insertion of the catheter is usually performed without
fluoroscopic guidance.
The catheter is then attached to a pressure transducer, and then gently
advanced through the sheath for 20cm.
Blood is aspirated to confirm intravascular placement, and the balloon
is gently inflated with 1.5mL of air.
Pressure is monitored through the port connected to the tip, with
confirmation on the monitor of the characteristic pressures in the right
atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery (PA) and pulmonary artery
capillary wedge pressure (PACWP) (Fig. 6.7).
The catheter is advanced and secured in such a position to demonstrate the PA pressure when the balloon is deflated and the PACWP
when the balloon is inflated.
Blood samples for O2 saturation can be withdrawn from either the
proximal or distal port, and cardiac output calculated via the thermistor using the thermodilution technique.
Contemporary systems provide an interface that displays cardiac
output, cardiac index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, etc.

Possible results
The principle use of Swan-Ganz catheterisation is in the management of
the patient with heart failure, distinguishing between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic (hypovolaemic) shock. By measuring the indirect left atrial
pressure, left ventricular pre-load can be accurately determined following
which appropriate treatment can be instituted. The PACWP waveform is
similar in appearance and magnitude to the left atrial pressure, with a and
v waves and x and y descents. Volume expansion is appropriate if the
cardiac index is low (normal range 2.54.2 L/min/m2) in association with a
low PACWP (normal mean 9mmHg, range 412mmHg). If the cardiac
index is low and the PACWP is high (>15mmHg), the administration of
diuretics, vasodilator therapy, often in combination with inotropic
support, is appropriate. The systemic vascular resistance determines the

choice of pressor agent (e.g. dobutamine, adrenaline(epinephrine), noradrenaline(norepinephrine)).
Advantages over other tests
Swan-Ganz catheterisation provides unique haemodynamic data that can
be continuously measured, thereby monitoring the response to treatment
or other intervention.
Ancillary tests
Echocardiography (TTE & TOE) is the most important alternative or complimentary test to Swan-Ganz catheterisation. Echocardiography can give
important information on chamber dimensions, ventricular contractility,
valve dysfunction and septal rupture ( OHCM pp8489).
Pitfalls
Complications include those related to central venous access, catheterrelated infection, venous or intracardiac thrombus formation, infective
endocarditis and pulmonary infarction (01.3%). Minor arrhythmias
(ectopic activity) have been reported in 3060% of patients; sustained
ventricular arrhythmias are rare, usually occurring in patients with myocardial ischaemia or infarction. The risk of infection increases significantly if
catheters are left in situ for more than 4 days.

patients with cardiac disease J Am Coll Cardiol 32, 840864.

Tilt test
Clinical indications
Tilt testing1 is the only effective non-invasive technique available for investigating the patient with neurally mediated syncope (vasovagal syncope,
carotid sinus syndrome, micturition syncope) occurring in the absence of
322 structural heart disease. It may also be used when structural heart disease
is present, but is not thought to be the cause of the symptoms.
Patient preparation
Patients are fasted overnight, or for several hours before the procedure.
Venous access should be in place and parenteral fluids (0.9% saline) administered if necessary in an attempt to reduce false positive results from postural hypotension. Cardioactive drugs should be omitted for at least 24h.
Procedure
The procedure is carried out in a specially equipped laboratory which is
quiet, comfortable and dimly lit. The patient rests supine on the specifically designed tilt table (with foot support) for 2045min, during which
time a resting pre-test ECG is recorded in at least three leads, together
with non-invasive beat-to-beat blood pressure recordings. The patient is
then tilted head-up to 70 for a period of 45min, during which time symptoms, ECG and blood pressure are monitored continuously. In the
absence of a response, provocation with isoprenaline (as an intravenous
infusion starting at 1mg/min, increasing to 5mg/min if necessary) may

6 Cardiology
increase sensitivity. All tilt tests should be supervised by trained personnel
(e.g. technician, nurse practitioner, physician).
Possible results
A positive test is defined as syncope occurring as a result of neurally mediated hypotension and/or bradycardia. The temporal association between
altered consciousness and the haemodynamic change is fundamental to a
positive result. In the absence of symptoms, heart rate or blood pressure
changes alone do not constitute a positive result.
Responses include a fall in heart rate or asystole (cardioinhibitory
response); blood pressure fall with no associated bradycardia (vasodepressor); or both heart rate and blood pressure fall (mixed response).
Interpretation
Tilt testing is highly specific (~90%) for identifying neurally mediated
syncope, but the specificity is variable (~75%); reproducibility is in the
range 65 to 85%.
Ancillary tests
A typical clinical history (fainting in an emotional setting with warning in a
patient <60 years old in association with other autonomic symptoms, e.g.
sweating, nausea) has a low sensitivity in comparison with tilt testing.
Occasionally, ambulatory ECG or blood pressure monitoring may capture
spontaneous attacks of neurally mediated syncope; heart rate variability
and response to carotid sinus massage may also be used in assessing this
group of patients.

Basic liver function tests
Bilirubin
Breakdown product of haem. Serum estimations are mostly based on the
depth of a violet colour reaction when a diazo reagent is added to serum,
with (total bilirubin) and without (direct or conjugated bilirubin) the
presence of an accelerator, e.g. ethanol. Indirect or unconjugated
bilirubin is the difference between the total and direct values.
Isolated 4 bilirubin may be
Unconjugated
2 Haemolysis.
2 Ineffective erythropoiesis.
2 Immature bilirubin metabolism:
 E.g. physiological jaundice in neonate.
 Inherited defects in uptake or conjugation, e.g. Gilbert and CriglerNajjar syndromes.
Conjugated
2 Inherited defects in excretion:
 E.g. Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndromes.
2 4Bilirubin also results from hepatocellular disease and post-hepatic or
cholestatic disease (intrahepatic and extrahepatic), including drug toxicity.
Aminotransferases
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is a mitochondrial and cytoplasmic
enzyme in liver, and is also present in high concentration in cardiac and
skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas and red cells. Alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) is a cytoplasmic enzyme in liver, and as it is
present in a higher concentration here than in other tissues it is
considered more specific for liver damage. Aminotransferases are most
useful in the diagnosis (e.g. early stages of viral hepatitis) and monitoring
of hepatocellular disease, but can also be very high in acute cholestatic
disease (especially choledocholithiasis). Marked elevations may also be
seen in acute profound hypotension and acute cardiac failure. Levels
326 may be normal in compensated cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C and
chronic incomplete biliary obstruction. As a rough guide, AST>ALT in
alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, infiltrative liver disease and non-biliary
cirrhosis, while ALT>AST in viral and drug hepatitis, chronic hepatitis C
and cholestasis. AST increases in many non-hepatobiliary diseases.
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is present as a number of isoenzymes and is
found in the highest concentrations in bone, liver, kidney, intestine and
placenta. In liver, it is located in the microvilli of canaliculi and on the
sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes. ALP elevations are highest in
cholestatic disease and infiltrative disease; lower levels are seen in
hepatocellular disease. Isoenzymes can be distinguished, but a
concomitant rise in GT also indicates that the likely source of a high
ALP is hepatobiliary. ALP rises in many diseases other than those
involving the liver, e.g. bone lesions.
-glutamyl transpeptidase (GT) is a membrane-bound enzyme in many
tissues. It rises in almost all types of liver disease, and is highest in

7 Gastroenterology
intrahepatic cholestasis and hepatic malignancy (primary or secondary).
GT is useful in alcohol abuse, where an isolated elevation may occur
(presumably as a result of enzyme induction) even in the absence of significant liver disease. Levels return to normal within 1 month of abstinence.
However, sensitivity is limited (one-third of alcoholics may have normal
GT), and there is poor correlation between alcohol intake and serum
level.
Albumin can be a sensitive marker of hepatic functional capacity in
chronic disease, but it has a long half-life (~20 days) and many other
conditions are associated with low levels.

Other common liver biochemical tests
Globulins

1-globulins tend to be 5 in chronic hepatocellular disease. Most are 1antitrypsin and 55 or absent levels suggest AAT deficiency. 2- and globulins include lipoproteins and 4 in cholestatic disease; they may
help in distinguishing biliary and non-biliary cirrhosis. Polyclonal 4 globulin is common in chronic liver disease (especially autoimmune
hepatitis).
Immunoglobulins: IgG is 4 in viral hepatitis, and 44 in chronic hepatitis
and cirrhosis. IgM is 44 in primary biliary cirrhosis, and 4 in viral
hepatitis and non-biliary cirrhosis. IgA is 44 in alcoholic cirrhosis, and
this results in bridging or fusion of the  and  bands on an
electrophoretic strip.
Caeruloplasmin is an 2-globulin. It is the main copper-containing
plasma protein and has oxidase activity. It is also an acute phase
protein. Serum caeruloplasmin is an important diagnostic test in
Wilsons disease (hepatolenticular degeneration): 5 in 95% 327
homozygotes and 10% heterozygotes. Related biochemical diagnostic
tests are serum copper (5 total, 4 free fraction) and 4 24h urine
copper. 5 caeruloplasmin also occurs in severe non-Wilsons hepatic
failure, severe malnutrition, protein-losing enteropathy and nephrotic
syndrome. 4 levels are found in pregnancy, oestrogen therapy, active
non-Wilsons liver disease, biliary obstruction, some inflammatory and
malignant disorders.

1-antitrypsin (AAT) is the main 1-globulin. It is a serine proteinase
inhibitor (especially of elastase), and is also an acute phase protein. 5
levels result from a number of gene mutations by several mechanisms,
but liver damage only occurs in those phenotypes associated with
accumulation of AAT in hepatocytesclassically Pi (proteinase
inhibitor) Z, but also Pi Mmalton and Pi Mduarte. 4 levels are seen in
pregnancy, oestrogen therapy, inflammatory disorders.
-fetoprotein

OHCM pp496, 706.

Urinary bilirubin: bilirubinuria is normally absent and is also absent in
unconjugated 4 bilirubin; its presence suggests cholestasis or liver
disease, but there is a significant false ve rate. In acute viral hepatitis,
bilirubin may appear in the urine before the onset of jaundice. Dipsticks
impregnated with a diazo reagent allow rough and ready quantification.
Urinary urobilinogens are a product of the enterohepatic circulation;
give a purple colour with Ehrlichs aldehyde reagent (dipsticks
containing this reagent are available); and may be absent in complete
biliary obstruction. This test has been superseded by other serum tests
and imaging.

Tumour markers
-fetoprotein (FP)
A major plasma protein in the fetus, FP is present in very low levels in
the normal non-pregnant adult. 4 and 44 levels occur in >90% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 4 levels also occur in other liver diseases, e.g.
cirrhosis (~15%), HBsAg ve chronic hepatitis B, regeneration following
acute viral hepatitis, hepatic metastases, and in pregnancy (marked elevations may be seen in trisomy 21 and neural tube defects), choriocarcinoma
and gonadal teratoma. FP is useful in diagnosis and monitoring of
response to treatment of HCC, and in monitoring patients with chronic
hepatitis B or cirrhosis for development of HCC.
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
CEA is high in ~60% of colorectal carcinoma, especially in advanced
disease (80100% if metastasised to liver). It may also be high in bronchial
carcinoma, breast carcinoma and a variety of non-malignant conditions
including inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, pancreatitis, and in
some heavy smokers. It is insufficiently sensitive or specific for screening
for colorectal cancer, and has no diagnostic value. Levels tend to correlate
poorly with tumour bulk, which limits usefulness in monitoring, although a
rising level after a potentially curative procedure suggests recurrence.

328

Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9
CA19-9 may be useful in monitoring effects of treatment in pancreatic carcinoma, and possibly colorectal and gastric carcinomas.
Faecal occult blood
Indications
Suspected occult gastrointestinal haemorrhage (including potential
screening test for colorectal carcinoma).
Procedure
The most common method is a simple and inexpensive qualitative chemical test using guaiac-impregnated paper. Haem (in faecal blood) has
pseudoperoxidase activity and catalyses the release of a free oxygen
radical from hydrogen peroxide (in the developing solution), resulting in
the oxidation of phenolic chromogens (in guaiac) to quinones, and the
production of a blue colour. Faecal samples are collected from several
(e.g. three, consecutive) bowel actions, or following rectal examination.

7 Gastroenterology
Precautions
Avoid sample collection during menstruation, active haemorrhoids, anal
fissures, etc.
Results
In trials of faecal occult blood screening for colorectal carcinoma, the sensitivity of tests for detecting cancer presenting within 2 years was 3779%,
and the specificity was as low as 87%. More sensitive but less specific kits
are now available (e.g. Haemoccult Sensa, Haema-screen stat).
False positives
2 Diet containing animal haemoglobin or vegetable peroxidase (tests may
recommend exclusion of red meat and certain uncooked fruits and
vegetables for 3 days before and during collection period).
2 Aspirin and NSAID s; use of rectal drugs (Note: iron therapy should not
affect guaiac-based tests).
False negatives
2 GI lesions, including carcinoma, may bleed intermittently or not at all.
2 Insensitive for blood loss from upper GI tract, unless considerable
(haem is metabolised in the small bowel).
2 High dose vitamin C intake (reducing agent).
Other methods of detecting faecal occult blood
Qualitative immunochemical tests (e.g. HemeSelect) are specific for
human haemoglobin, thus minimizing dietary false +ves, but
nevertheless have a significant false +ve rate as they tend to react to
physiological quantities of faecal blood. They are also more expensive
and more complicated.
Quantitative tests include 51Cr-labelled red cells and radioassay of faecal
samples. The upper limit of normal is ~2mg Hb/g faeces.

Faecal osmotic gap
Indication
Unexplained chronic diarrhoea (not commonly used).
Principle
Diarrhoea may be divided pathophysiologically into secretory (pure examples: stimulant laxative abuse; some GI infections, e.g. E. coli, cholera; hormonal causes, e.g. VIPoma, carcinoid syndrome) and osmotic (pure
examples: osmotic laxative abuse, e.g. magnesium, lactulose; carbohydrate
maldigestion/absorption, e.g. lactose intolerance). Diarrhoea associated
with most GI diseases often results from a combination of both mechanisms. Faecal osmotic gap (FOG) is 5 in secretory diarrhoea and 4 in
osmotic diarrhoea.

Thin layer chromatography (TLC)
TLC of a random urine sample or loose faeces sample can detect

(phenolphthalein, bisacodyl) laxatives or their metabolites.
Phenolphthalein can also be detected by alkalinisation of urine or faecal
water with sodium hydroxide (production of red colour), but false ve
rate is high.
If faecal osmotic gap >100mOsmol/kg, measure faecal water magnesium
330 (>30mmol/L suggests magnesium abuse). Faecal water sulphate and phosphate may also be measured.

Diagnostic paracentesis
Indication
Ascites.
Procedure
2050mL of ascitic fluid is aseptically aspirated through a needle inserted
preferentially into the left lower quadrant of the abdomen below the
border of shifting dullness. Local anaesthetic may be used. Ultrasound
guidance may help in difficult cases. Complications (e.g. bowel perforation,
haemorrhage, infection) are rare.

Routine tests on ascitic fluid include
2 Appearance. Straw-coloured; bloody (malignancy, abdominal trauma
including recent surgery or invasive procedures such as paracentesis or
liver biopsy, or catastrophe, bloody tap); milky (chylous ascites
confirm if fat floats on standing and high triglyceride content: malignant
or inflammatory lymphatic duct obstruction, trauma, may be seen in
advanced cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome). Turbid fluid may indicate
infection.
2 Cell count.
2 Gram stain and bacterial culture. Yield is markedly improved if fluid
is inoculated into blood culture bottles at bedside.
2 Ziehl-Neelsen or auramine stain, and acid/alcohol-fast bacilli
culture.
2 Protein <25g/L suggests transudate (e.g. portal hypertension,
5albumin), >25g/L suggests exudate (e.g. malignancy, pancreatitis,
tuberculosis), but this is an unreliable method of classification. Hepatic
venous occlusion (Budd-Chiari syndrome) is usually associated with a
44 protein.

Percutaneous blind liver biopsy1
Do benefits of knowing histology (?alters treatment, ?clarifies prognosis)
outweigh risks to patient?
Indications
2 Acute hepatitis including ?drug-related (biopsy not usually needed in
typical acute viral hepatitis).
2 Chronic liver disease for diagnosis and monitoring.
2 Alcoholic liver disease.
2 Primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis (especially

for more advanced disease).
2 Focal liver lesion (avoid if resection considered).
2 Unexplained persistently abnormal LFT (isolated 4GT is not associated with major liver disease and is not an indication).
2 Unexplained hepatomegaly.
2 Liver transplantation, e.g. routine monitoring, rejection, recurrent
disease, CMV infection.
2 Pyrexia of unknown origin.
2 Infections, e.g. tuberculosis.
2 Storage disorders.
Contraindications

Coagulopathypercutaneous biopsy considered safe if platelets 60 
109/L and PT <4s prolonged (or INR <1.5). Outside these limits, consider platelet transfusion, vitamin K IV and FFP, as appropriate, or
other methods of biopsy (transvenous, plugged or laparoscopic).
Biopsy safe in haemophilics if factor deficiency corrected pre- and for
24h post-biopsy.
Tense ascites (high probability of failure, risk of uncontrollable haemorrhage into ascites)consider total paracentesis, or image-guided (no
increase in complication rate in presence of ascites), transvenous or
laparoscopic biopsy.
Hydatid cysts (risk of abdominal dissemination, risk of anaphylaxis)
USS-guided aspiration with small needle under albendazole cover
appears safe.
Amyloidosis (iirisk of haemorrhage).

Patient preparation
Liver imaging 1 month (identifies abnormal anatomy and focal lesions,
and defines borders in difficult cases, e.g. obesity, emphysema, cirrhosis).
2 FBC, coagulation profile, G&S (preferably 24h; 1 week if stable liver
disease); consider bleeding time (e.g. aspirin/NSAIDs, uraemia, paraproteinaemia).
2 Informed consent.
2 Prophylactic antibiotics for valvular heart disease or risk of septicaemia
(e.g. biliary sepsis).
2 Consider sedation (e.g. midazolam, diazepam), atropine.
2

Procedure
1. The liver borders of the supine patient are defined by percussion or
ultrasound.
2. Local anaesthetic is infiltrated in the mid-axillary line through the 8th
or 9th intercostal space down to the liver capsule (intercostal or
transthoracic approach).
3. The site of entry may be subcostal in hepatomegaly.
333
4. A small incision is made, and the biopsy needle is inserted and
advanced (slightly superoposteriorly to avoid the gallbladder) while the
patient holds his/her breath in expiration.
5. There are two main types of biopsy needle: cutting (e.g. Tru-cut) and
suction (Menghini); the latter is cheaper, smaller and involves less time
within the liver, with a lower complication rate but has a lower yield.
6. For histology, one sample is usually sufficient, but in situations where
the probability of sampling error is high, e.g. macronodular cirrhosis,
two samples may be taken without significantly increasing complications.
7. Post-biopsy, the patient lies on his/her right side or supine, and observations typically involve monitoring vital signs every 15min for 2h, then
every 30min for 2h, and then hourly for 2h.
8. If there are no problems at the end of this 6h period (most complications occur in the first 3h), the patient may be discharged, but should
have a responsible person to stay on the first night and should be able
to return to hospital within 30min.

9. Low-risk patients may thus be suitable for day case biopsy.
Complications

increase risk).

2 Puncture of other viscera (lung, colon, kidney, gallbladder) 0.010.1%;
intervention is rarely required.
2 Others: sepsis, anaesthetic reaction, biopsy needle breakage, intrahepatic arteriovenous fistula, seeding of tumour down biopsy track.
Ancillary tests
Special stains/dry weight estimations, e.g. for copper or iron overload.

Other methods of liver biopsy
Percutaneous guided liver biopsy
Undertaken during real time imaging of the liver by USS (or CT, MNR). It
is used in focal disease but its use in diffuse disease is more debatable: it
should enable sampling of thicker parenchyma and result in fewer complications.
Percutaneous plugged liver biopsy
Modification of a conventional biopsy using a Tru-cut needle, in which
the obturator containing the sample is removed, and gelatin or gel foam is
injected down the sheath as it is withdrawn. It is a safer alternative in
patients with significant coagulopathy where transjugular biopsy is unavailable.

334 Transvenous (transjugular) liver biopsy
A catheter introduced into the right internal jugular vein using the
Seldinger technique is guided under fluoroscopic control and cardiac monitoring through the right atrium and inferior vena cava into the hepatic
veins. The biopsy needle is then inserted into the catheter and, with the
patient holding his/her breath, rapidly advanced 12cm beyond the tip into
the liver. Tissue is retained by suction. Although usually performed via the
transjugular route, it may be done via a transfemoral approach.
Transvenous biopsy is remarkably safe.
Laparoscopic liver biopsy
Liver lesions found may be found incidentally at laparoscopy, but it is also
used in patients with significant coagulopathy where transjugular biopsy is
unavailable, and in patients with the combination of a focal liver lesion and
deranged coagulation.

7 Gastroenterology

Carbohydrate maldigestion &
absorption tests
D-xylose absorption test
No longer routinely used.
Indication
?Small bowel malabsorption.
Principle
D-xylose is a sugar that is normally almost completely absorbed in the
proximal small bowel, minimally metabolised by either the normal
microflora of the small bowel of man, and excreted unaltered in urine.
Procedure
An oral dose of D-xylose is given and urine is collected for 5h.
Results/Interpretation
Excretion of <22% of 5g dose (or <17% of 25g dose) is abnormal. The test
is sensitive for small bowel mucosal disease (e.g. coeliac disease) and
rarely gives false +ves in pancreatic disease (false +ves may however
occur as result of delayed gastric emptying, poor renal function or poor
urine output).
Disaccharidase (lactase) deficiency test
Lactose breath H2 test
Lactose maldigestion occurs as a result of lactase deficiency, which may be
primary (congenital or acquired) or secondary to a structurally abnormal
small bowel with loss of brush border membrane disaccharidases (e.g. gastroenteritis, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease). It may also
occur as a result of a short gut, enterocolic fistula or Billroth II anastomosis. Note: Most of the worlds adults (especially non-whites) are lactose
deficient but not intolerant.
335
Procedure
Test substrate: 50g lactose ( 2pints of milk; lower, more physiological,
doses have been suggested). Breath H2 is measured and the patient is also
monitored for the symptoms of lactose intolerance (bloating and distension, pain, borborygmi, flatulence, diarrhoea).
Advantages
2 Inexpensive.
2 Sensitive (90%).
2 Specificity may be 90%, especially if cut-off is increased from 20 to
30PPM.
Lactose tolerance test
Lactose (2mg/kg up to max. 50g) is given orally to fasted patient. Plasma
glucose is measured at baseline and at 30min intervals for 2h, and the
patient is monitored for provocation of symptoms. Failure of plasma
glucose to rise by 1.1mmol/L indicates a positive test, especially if accom-

panied by symptoms (repeat test with glucose/galactose to exclude
monosaccharide malabsorption). Sensitivity and specificity are lower than
breath H2 test. Test may be used with other disaccharides, e.g. sucrose.
Small bowel disaccharidase activity
Activity of lactase (and that of other disaccharidases, e.g. sucrose, maltose)
may be quantified directly in small bowel biopsy specimens. Test is limited
by considerable individual variation, and hypolactasia does not necessarily
mean lactose intolerance.
Breath hydrogen tests
Principle
H2 is normally derived exclusively from the metabolism of unabsorbed
carbohydrates by colonic bacteria and some yeasts (the normal bacterial
density of the small bowel does not produce significant amounts of H2).
~20% is absorbed across the mucosa and excreted in expired air.
Procedure
A carbohydrate substrate is administered orally. End-expiratory (alveolar)
air is sampled basally and at intervals (e.g. 2030min) for up to 3h, and
analysed using a H2 sensor.
Results/Interpretation
Basal breath H2 is usually 5ppm. A rise of 20ppm above basal is
regarded as a positive test. High basal concentrations may prohibit the
detection of significant H2 production from the test substrate, and may
occur as a result of fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate consumed
the previous evening, poor oral hygiene, malabsorption, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis.
Precautions
2 12h fast.
2 Careful oral hygiene, including no smoking.
Indications
2 Carbohydrate malabsorption (lactose).
2 Small bowel bacterial overgrowth (glucose, lactulose).
2 Measurement of mouth-to-caecum transit time (lactulose).

336

Fat maldigestion/absorption tests
Faecal fat
Procedure
Faeces are collected for several days: at least 3 days, preferably 5 days (to
account for considerable variation in day to day faecal output). Faecal
mass/volume and fat are quantified. Dietary fat intake should be known or
standardised, e.g. 70100g/day (individual fat intake varies enormously).
Faecal markers (isotopic or radio-opaque) improve accuracy and allow
reduction in collection period.
Results/Interpretation
Faecal fat of >6g/day (>18mmol/day) or dietary fat absorption of <93%
indicates fat maldigestion (parenchymal liver disease, biliary obstruction,
excess gastric acid, pancreatic disease, bile acid deconjugation by small

7 Gastroenterology
bowel bacterial overgrowth, bile acid malabsorption due to terminal ileal
disease/resection or cholestyramine) or fat malabsorption (small bowel
mucosal disease, abetalipoproteinaemia, lymphatic obstruction).
Advantages
2 Direct.
2 Quantitative.
2 Simple.
Disadvantages
2 Unpleasant for all concerned.
2 Needs to be conducted rigorously.
2 Cannot distinguish maldigestion and malabsorption.
2 Insensitive for mild pancreatic disease.
14

CO2 fat breath tests

Principle
Triglycerides are hydrolysed by pancreatic lipase into monoglycerides and
fatty acids. These are then incorporated into mixed micelles with bile constituents, absorbed, metabolised, and ultimately excreted as CO2.
Procedure
A 14C-labelled triglyceride (e.g. [14C]triolein) is ingested and breath 14CO2
is measured at intervals. With intact fat digestion and absorption, there is
a peak in breath radioactivity at 57h. This is repeated 2 weeks later with
a 14C-labelled free fatty acid (e.g. [14C]oleic acid) to differentiate between
maldigestion and malabsorption.
Advantages
2 Can distinguish maldigestion and malabsorption.
2 Good correlation with faecal fat test.
Disadvantages
2 Indirect.
2 Qualitative.
2 Involves radioisotope.
2 Insensitive for mild pancreatic disease.
Faecal microscopy
Faecal microscopy (for fatty acid crystals, neutral fat, soaps) is poorly validated and of dubious value.

Small bowel bacterial overgrowth
tests: 1
Glucose breath H2 test
Principle
Glucose is normally completely absorbed in the proximal small bowel,
and any rise in breath H2 is indicative of bacterial overgrowth.

337

Procedure
Test substrate: 5075g glucose.
Results/Interpretation
Variable sensitivity (6590%) and specificity (75100%). False ves
presumably result from variations in the particular microflora present,
with differing capacities for the metabolism of glucose (and other
substrates, e.g. lactulose, glycocholic acid and xylose, in other tests).
False +ves may occur in glucose malabsorption.
Lactulose breath H2 test
Test substrate: 1015g lactulose, a non-absorbed disaccharide. In
bacterial overgrowth, fermentation occurs not only in the colon but also
in the small bowel, resulting in an early (e.g. 40min) peak in breath H2.
The test may has also been used to measure oro-caecal transit time
(reference range: 30140min).
[14C]glycocholate breath 14CO2 test
A conjugated bile acid with the amino acid portion labelled ([14C]glycine in
glycocholate) is administered orally. Breath 14CO2 is measured discontinuously. Normally very little deconjugation occurs and the bile acid is
absorbed intact in the terminal ileum. In small bowel bacterial overgrowth,
deconjugation by anaerobic bacteria occurs, liberating [14C]glycine which
is absorbed and rapidly metabolised in the liver to 14CO2, which is then
excreted and detected in the breath. Sensitivity is similar to the glucose
breath H2 test, and the latter does not involve radioactivity. In terminal
ileal disease/resection, glycocholate reaches the colon where it is deconjugated by colonic bacteria. This false +ve result may be recognized by a
delayed breath radioactivity peak and the presence of faecal radioactivity.
[14C]D-xylose breath 14CO2 test
In bacterial overgrowth, a significant amount of a 1g oral dose of [14C]Dxylose is metabolised by aerobic Gram ve bacteria to 14CO2. This is
absorbed and excreted in breath. Again, this has no advantage over the
glucose breath H2 test, and involves the use of a radioisotope.

338

Small bowel bacterial overgrowth
tests: 2
Duodenal/jejunal juice aspiration
Procedure
Duodenal contents can be aspirated at gastroscopy (or jejunal contents
at enteroscopy), but this may miss bacterial overgrowth confined to the
distal small bowel. Jejunal and even ileal intubation, under fluoroscopic
control, may be required. Aspirated juice is cultured (anaerobic and
aerobic) and may be assayed for deconjugated bile acids or short-chain
fatty acids. Normal total bacterial count: <104105 cfu/mL in duodenum
and jejunum, <105109 cfu/mL in ileum (cfu: colony-forming units).
Advantages
Gold standard (but not without problems).

2

7 Gastroenterology

2

Direct.
High specificity, but sensitivity <60% (missed distal disease).

Disadvantages
2 Invasive.
Urinary indican
This test involves measurement of urinary excretion of indoxylsulphate
(indican), a bacterial metabolic product of dietary tryptophan. An alternative is phenols from dietary tyrosine. These tests cannot distinguish bacterial overgrowth from other causes of malabsorption.

Pancreatic exocrine function tests: 1
Pancreatic function tests are indicated when there is a clinical suspicion of
chronic pancreatic disease but imaging (AXR, USS, CT, ERCP) is normal or
equivocal. Currently no test is able to detect the earliest stages of pancreatic insufficiency. Invasive (tube) tests have largely been superseded by
simpler, safer, non-invasive (tubeless) tests.
Secretin and related tests
Principle
Maximal secretion of pancreatic juice and output of bicarbonate and
enzymes is related to the functional mass of pancreas.
Procedure
A tube is passed into the duodenum (beyond the ampulla of Vater) of
the fasted patient under fluoroscopic control. Suction is applied until
the duodenal content is clear. Secretin is administered IV and is usually
followed by cholecystokinin-pancreozymin, CCK-PZ (or its cheaper
amphibian analogue, cerulein). Bile may also be administered by tube
into the duodenum. Duodenal juice is collected.
339
Stimulation by secretin alone allows measurement of volume and bicarbonate secretion (enzyme secretion is inconsistent), but co-stimulation
with PZ also allows assay of pancreatic enzymes (e.g. trypsin). Bile administration prevents false +ve results caused by inadequate gallbladder contraction.
Results
Secretin-PZ test can have a sensitivity of >90%, and specificity of 90%.
Advantages
Gold standard.
Direct assessment of pancreatic function.

2
2

Disadvantages
2 Invasive.
2 Time-consuming, labour-intensive.
2 Expensive.

Lundh test
Procedure
Similar to secretin test except that stimulus is the Lundh test meal (15g
protein, 40g glucose, 18g fat, 300mL water). Activity of one or more
enzymes (e.g. trypsin, lipase) in duodenal juice is assayed.
Advantages
2 Physiological stimulus with integrated response.
2 Easier and cheaper than secretin-PZ.
Disadvantages
2 Less sensitive and less specific (false +ves may occur in small bowel
mucosal disease) than secretin-PZ test.

Pancreatic exocrine function tests: 2
BT-PABA test
Principle
N-benzoyl-l-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (bentiromide, BT-PABA, BTP)
is a synthetic tripeptide that is specifically hydrolysed by pancreatic
chymotrypsin in duodenum to yield p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). PABA
is absorbed and partly conjugated in the liver to various arylamines,
which are excreted by the kidneys.
The percentage recovery of PABA metabolites in the urine following oral
bentiromide is an indirect measure of chymotrypsin activity and thus pancreatic function. Recovery is also affected by individual variations in rate of
gastric emptying, small bowel absorption, hepatic conjugation and renal
excretion, and to control for these, PABA recovery is compared with
recovery of radiolabelled free PABA (or unlabelled p-aminosalicylic acid)
administered at the same time (or unlabelled free PABA administered on a
separate day).
Patient preparation
23 days beforehand: no pancreatic enzyme supplements; avoid
340 For
certain drugs (e.g. paracetamol, thiazides, sulphonamides,
benzodiazepines), and certain fruits and vegetables (e.g. apples,
cranberries, prunes, beetroot) that can interfere with the test.
Procedure
Patient is fasted from the night before and during the test, but a high
water intake is encouraged to ensure adequate urine output.
Bentiromide tablets (in a standard meal, e.g. Lundh, to stimulate
pancreatic secretion) and free [14C]PABA (in a drink) are ingested.
Urine is collected for 6h.
Results/Interpretation
Excretion index (or T/K ratio) is calculated as ratio of PABA recovery
(Test) to free [14C]PABA recovery (Kontrol). >0.75 is normal,
0.600.75 is equivocal (repeat or consider tube test), <0.60 is
abnormal. Sensitivity is ~75% (moderate and severe insufficiency),
specificity is ~90%.

7 Gastroenterology
Advantages
2 Non-invasive.
2 Relatively simple.
Disadvantages
2 Indirect.
2 May involve radioisotope.

Pancreatic exocrine function tests: 3
Pancreolauryl test
Principle
This is similar to PABA test. Fluorescein dilaurate (pancreolauryl) is an
ester that is specifically hydrolysed by pancreatic arylesterases, in the
presence of bile acids, to release fluorescein, which is then absorbed,
conjugated and excreted in urine.
Patient preparation
Patient need not fast, but must avoid pancreatic enzyme supplements,
vitamin B and some other drugs for 2 days beforehand.
Procedure
Pancreolauryl capsules (Test) are ingested in the middle of a standard
breakfast (50g white bread, 20g butter, one cup of liquid). A high liquid
intake is maintained. Urine is collected for 10h, and fluorescein
recovery is measured spectrophotometrically. The test is repeated one
or more days later with capsules of free fluorescein (Kontrol).
Results/Interpretation
T/K ratio of >0.30 is normal, 0.200.30 is equivocal (repeat or consider

tube test), and <0.20 is abnormal. Sensitivity and specificity are similar
to PABA test, but false +ves may also occur in the presence of
hepatobiliary disease as bile acids are necessary for pancreolauryl 341
digestion, and bacterial hydrolysis may result in a false ve in
overgrowth. A disadvantage is that it is a two stage test.
Faecal enzymes
Elastase-1 (E1) is a proteinase secreted by pancreatic acinar cells. It
remains largely undegraded during gut transit.
Procedure
E1 concentration in a random faecal sample is measured using an
immunoassay.
Results/Interpretation
Normal >200g E1/g faeces; moderate insufficiency 100200g/g;
severe insufficiency <100g/g. Good sensitivity. High specificity.
Concentration may be lowered in voluminous, watery faeces (false
+ve).

Advantages
2 Non-invasive.
2 Simple.
2 Unaffected by pancreatic supplements.
Disadvantages
2 Indirect.
2 Faecal test.
2 Expensive.
Chymotrypsin is another such stable pancreatic proteinase. Its activity in
faeces is measured by spectrophotometric assay of 4-nitroaniline
released from a synthetic pentapeptide. It is cheaper than faecal E1, but
has lower sensitivity and cannot be used if on pancreatic enzyme
supplements. It is a common screening test in children with cystic
fibrosis.

Invasive Helicobacter pylori tests
Indications
Assessment of H. pylori infection and antibiotic sensitivity. Invasive tests
are employed when endoscopy is to be performed on a patient to establish the underlying disease, e.g. peptic ulcer.
Patient preparation
For gastroscopy ( p346).
Procedure
Biopsies taken from within 2cm of the pylorus and also from the body of
the stomach if patient on proton pump inhibitor treatment. In general two
of the following tests are performed.

342 Rapid urease or CLO test
A biopsy sample is placed in urea solution containing phenyl red pH indicator changing colour from straw to purple when H. pylori infection is
present. It takes 24h before result can be said to be definitely ve, but
advantage is that a +ve result is often available within an hour before the
patient leaves the endoscopy unit.
Histology
Two samples fixed in formalin and stained with haematoxylin and eosin or
modified Giemsa stain. Characteristic spiral/curved shaped Gram negative
organisms seen in mucus layer. Useful where histological information of
mucosa also desired.
Culture
In micro-aerophilic conditions using chocolate agar. Can take several days
for H. pylori to grow in tiny opalescent colonies. Transport of biopsy to
culture plate within 30min is desirable. Useful where bacterial sensitivity
to antibiotics is required in treatment of resistant strains.

7 Gastroenterology
Pitfalls
False ve results occur in patients who recently (within 2 weeks) have
been taking antibiotic or proton pump inhibitor treatment.

Non-invasive H. pylori tests
Serology
Indications
Initial diagnosis of H. pylori infection.
Patient preparation
10mL venous serum sample.
Procedure
This is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measuring IgG to
H. pylori antigens. Several kits are available which allow 40 patient samples
to be assessed at the same time with the results being available in 3h.
Possible results/Interpretation
See table (p344) for test performance. Local validation recommended due
to regional variation of cut-off point.
False positives occur where patients have had successful H. pylori
eradication therapy within the last 2 years and also due to crossreactivity with antibodies to other organisms.
False negatives occur in elderly and immunocompromised patients.
Pitfalls
Avoid use in assessing eradication of H. pylori.
Ancillary tests
Rapid whole blood test and saliva test: useful in epidemiological studies
and in children although performance is poorer.
343
Faecal antigen test: measures H. pylori antigens in stool but its role and
value is under trial.

Patient preparation and procedure
Two tests are available 13C (stable isotope) and 14C (unstable isotope).
13C test (most commonly used):
2 Citrus drink given to delay gastric emptying followed by breath sample
collection into a test tube.
2 Carbon-labelled urea ingested with repeat breath sample half an hour
afterwards. The increase in labelled carbon dioxide exhaled is measured and indicates H. pylori infection.
2 Carbon dioxide measurements are performed by mass spectrometer,
but commercial laboratories will analyse breath samples sent by post.
Possible results/Interpretation
+ve test indicates active infection.
Pitfall
Assessment of eradication can only be carried out at least 1 month after
eradication therapy by definition. False ve results occur in patients
recently on antibiotics or proton pump inhibitor treatment within 2 weeks
and also in patients with previous gastric surgery.

 Dark red blood (colonoscopy).
 Bright red blood (flexible sigmoidoscopy).
2 Positive FOBs.
2 Pathological diarrhoea.
2 Abnormalities on barium enema.
2 Unexplained iron deficiency anaemia.

2 Stenting of malignant strictures.
2 Decompression of acute non-toxic megacolon and colonic volvulus.
2 Contraindications:
 Severe colitis.
 Acute diverticulitis.
 Suspected perforated bowel.
Patient preparation
Obtain informed consent and check.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy
Give phosphate enema 3060min before procedure.
Colonoscopy
4 days before examination stop iron tablets. Restrict to light meals with
low fibre, e.g. pasta, rice, egg, fish, poultry, yoghurt, mashed potato, jelly,
etc. Plenty of clear fluids but no food 24h before the procedure. Bowel
clear out is achieved with Picolax, 3 sachets taken divided throughout
the day before the morning procedure or 2 sachets the day before and 1
sachet in the morning of the afternoon procedure. In patients with
severe rectal bleeding, bowel preparation may not be required/desirable.
Procedure
The procedure is carried out in the endoscopy unit with the patient in left
lateral position and takes approximately 15min (flexible sigmoidoscopy)/30min (colonoscopy) to complete.

Metcalf JV et al. (1996) Incidence and causes of rectal bleeding in general practice as

Advantages over barium enema are: greater yield in pathology, ability to
obtain histological biopsies and application of therapy although virtual
colonoscopy which is currently under development may become useful
for screening and surveillance of polyps/cancer.

7 Gastroenterology
Pitfalls
2 These tests do not preclude PR examination. Need to differentiate which
patients need colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy or barium enema.
2 Failure to take biopsies in patients with diarrhoea but normal-looking
mucosa may miss microscopic colitis.
2 Risk of perforation if barium enema carried out within a few days after
biopsy of rectum/colon.
Other lower GI investigations
Proctoscopy is examination of the lower rectum and anal canal, e.g. for
haemorrhoids, fissures, fistulae.
Rigid sigmoidoscopy is used for examination of rectum for
proctitis/polyps or carcinoma. This procedure is commonly used in
outpatients but is greatly underused as an initial inpatient investigation
for diarrhoea or rectal bleeding. This is a simple procedure that can be
performed at the bedside and allows biopsy of the rectal mucosa. The
patient is positioned on the left side with knees drawn up. The
instrument is inserted into the anus in the direction of the umbilicus
with the aid of a lubricant for a few centimetres. Air is insufflated and
the instrument is guided by direct vision and directed towards the
sacrum and advanced usually to 15cm.

Enteroscopy
Principle
2 Push enteroscopy allows examination to the jejunum.
2 Sonde enteroscopy allows examination to the ileum.
2 Intraoperative enteroscopy allows complete examination of jejunum and
ileum.
Indications
Obscure GI bleeding or severe unexplained iron deficiency anaemia.
Abnormality found in jejunum/ileum on barium follow-through examination or abdominal CT scan.
2 Selected cases of chronic diarrhoea/malabsorption syndrome.
2 Selective indication as pathology in small bowel rare.

Preparation and procedure
As for OGD, but may need mild bowel clear-out in some cases.
2 Push enteroscopy (commonest procedure): allows tip angulation,
biopsy and therapy.
2 As per gastroscopy but position of patient as per ERCP . Use of overtube allows better intubation and procedure takes 3040min.
2 Sonde enteroscopy: slimmer endoscope without tip angulation or
therapy. Passed to second part of the duodenum with the aid of gas-

349

2

troscope. Balloon tip of endoscopy inflated which passes down the
small bowel with the aid of peristalsis. This can take several hours,
after which the balloon is deflated and withdrawn and examination is
performed which allows approximately 50% of the bowel lumen to be
viewed.
Intraoperative enteroscopy: under general anaesthetic with a push
enteroscope. The small bowel is concertined over the endoscope
allowing full examination down to the terminal ileum.

Advantages over barium examination include detection of vascular and
fine mucosal lesions which can be missed on barium examination and also
allows therapeutic intervention.
Results
The table shows the yield in small bowel pathology and missed lesions
elsewhere in patients with unexplained GI bleeding when enteroscopy was
carried out.

Advantages
2 Has replaced previous surgical intervention.
2 Allows therapeutic intervention over MRCP .
Ancillary tests
2 Assessment of bile for crystals.
2 Cytology for biliary/pancreatic strictures.
2 Manometry for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.

Oesophageal pH measurement
Indications
Assessment of suspected or established gastro-oesophageal reflux
disease:
2 In a patient with atypical symptoms, e.g. asthma, non-cardiac chest
pain.
2 Poorly controlled reflux disease.
2 Prior to antireflux procedure.
Preparation
Acid suppression therapy stopped 7 days prior to procedure and patient
fasted for 4h.
Procedure
A fine catheter is passed transnasally with the use of a local anaesthetic
spray so that the tip of the pH catheter is placed 5cm above manometrically determined lower oesophageal sphincter. This is linked to a data
recorder and is carried for a 24h period. The patient keeps a symptom
diary. The computer-generated report is produced which gives the following information.
Measurements
Percentage of time pH <4.
Number of reflux episodes.
Number of episodes longer than 5min.
352
Duration of longest reflux episode.
Correlation between symptoms and reflux episodes.

Interpretation
Values that lie outside the normal values shown below indicate significant
reflux but are subject to interpretation:
2 Reflux time upright <6.3%.
2 Reflux time supine <1.2%.
2 Total reflux time <4.2%.
2 Number of episodes of reflux <50%.
2 Reflux episodes longer than 5min <3.
2 Longest episode of reflux <9.2min.
Pitfalls
The values need to be taken together with clinical information to form a
full picture; investigation is not indicated for well-defined reflux
responding to appropriate therapy.

GI manometry
Indications
2 Determine the position of lower oesophageal sphincter in 24h pH
monitoring.
2 Prior to antireflux procedure.
2 Assessment of motility disorder giving rise to dysphagia or non-cardiac
chest pain.
Patient preparation
As per 24h monitoring.
Procedure
A multi-lumen catheter with several perfusion ports at various lengths
along the catheter is placed transnasally to beyond 40cm past the lower
oesophageal sphincter. The catheter is pulled back once the low
oesophageal sphincter is identified and pressure measurements are taken
throughout the length of the oesophagus with dry and wet swallows.
The following measurements are taken
Upper and lower sphincter and body basal pressure.
Peak pressure.
Duration, frequency and pattern of contraction.

Results
Achalasianon-relaxing hypertonic lower oesophageal sphincter with
atonic body.
2 Nutcracker oesophagushigh amplitude prolonged body contraction
but with normal peristalsis.
2 Diffuse oesophageal spasmprolonged body contractions simultaneously throughout the body.
2 Non-specific motor disordera mixture of normal body contractions
with incomplete propagation.
2

Pitfalls
Should not be used as initial test for atypical chest pain or other
oesophageal symptoms because of low specificity.
Anorectal manometry
The methodology is similar to oesophageal manometry.
Indications
2 Faecal incontinence.
2 Chronic constipation.
2 Pre-operatively for anorectal surgery.
Sphincter of Oddi manometry
A manometry catheter is used during ERCP.
Indications
Biliary type abdominal pain with abnormal LFTs  dilated common bile duct.
If sphincter of Oddi pressure is high, sphincterotomy may be beneficial.

353

Endoscopic ultrasound
Indications
2 Pre-operative staging for cancer (oesophageal, gastric, pancreatic,
ampullary, bile duct, colorectal and bronchial).
2 Assessment of submucosal lesions and prior to endoscopic resection.
2 Assessment of patient with suspected common bile duct stones.
2 Assessment of chronic pancreatitis.
2 Assessment of anal sphincter/faecal incontinence.
Preparation
As per OGD (no preparation for last indication). This is a relatively new
technique and requests should be discussed before it is carried out.
Procedure
Intubation as per OGD. The tip of the endoscope has an ultrasound transducer which provides a cross-sectional (360) or transectional (100)
scanning field. The endoscope is passed distally and then withdrawn as
ultrasound images are assessed.
Therapeutic interventions include
Fine needle aspiration.
Cyst aspiration.
Coeliac axis block.
Stent placement.

Results
The exact place of endoscopic ultrasound is being assessed with other
imaging modalities and it may replace other procedures although its role is
likely to be complimentary. By providing information for better local
staging, it will alter patient management.

Airway hyperresponsiveness test or
histamine/methacholine challenge test
Clinical indications
Suspected asthma.
Patient preparation
1. Explain procedure to patient.
2. Obtain informed consent.
3. Warn that wheezing and shortness of breath may occur and that a
bronchodilator may be given.
4. Baseline FEV1 measured.
5. Patient breathes in a nebulised aerosol of histamine (or methacholine)
of increasing concentrations. This stimulates bronchoconstriction in a
dose-dependent manner.
6. The FEV1 is measured after each dose.
7. Patient must remain in department for 30min following the procedure
to observe any delayed reactions.
Possible results
The % fall in FEV from baseline is plotted against the dose of inhaled histamine on a logarithmic scale. A doseresponse curve is constructed and
the provocation concentration (PC) of inhaled histamine required to
reduce the FEV1 by 20% (PC20) can be derived by linear extrapolation.
This figure has been arbitrarily chosen to assess degrees of bronchial reactivity for ease of comparison and safety.
Interpretation
Asthma suggested by PC20 <8mg/mL.
A direct relationship exists between the severity of asthma and requirement for medication and the PC20 value as an index of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
Non-asthmatic subjects almost always have a PC20 >8mg/mL.
Advantages over other tests
2 Easy to do.
2 Cheap.
356 2 Non-invasive.
2 Quick.
2 Reproducible.
2 Safe: bronchoconstriction may be reversed by inhaled b-adrenergic
agonist.
Contraindications
Documented cholinergic hypersensitivity, e.g. cholinergic urticaria or
angio-oedema or both.
2 Allergy to histamine/methacholine.
2 Unstable cardiac status, e.g. recent MI , arrhythmia or heart failure.
2 Pregnancy.
2 Severe baseline obstruction with FEV 1 <1.5.

Reduction in FEV1 from baseline (%)

Pitfalls
2 Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma is not a static phenomenon
and may vary widely from day to day.
2 May change quite markedly without any change in symptoms (and vice
versa).
2 Represents only one component contributing to the symptomatology
of asthma:
 Others include airway oedema and mucus hypersecretion.

Interpretation
Must be aware of the patients inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) at
time of sampling.
Advantages over other tests
2 Easy, quick, cheap.
2 No real alternative for assessing CO2 or acid-base balance.
358 2 Greater precision in upper ranges of SAO2 curve.

Pitfalls
If sample is to be analysed in a laboratory with >5min transit time it
should be kept in melting ice to slow the metabolic activity of the cells.
2 Avoid arterial puncture if possible in patients on anticoagulant therapy,
with bleeding disorders or who have received thrombolytics in
previous 24h.

Epworth test/Epworth sleepiness scale
(ESS)
Clinical indications
Screening tool for obstructive sleep apnoea. Measures general level of
daytime sleepiness.
Patient preparation
1. Ask patient to fill in questionnaire.
2. Subject rates on a scale of 03 the chances that, as part of his usual life
in recent times, he would doze in each of 8 different situations.
Use the following scale to choose that most appropriate number for each
situation:
0 = Would NEVER doze
1 = SLIGHT chance of dozing
2 = MODERATE chance of dozing
3 = HIGH chance of dozing
Situation
2 Sitting and reading.
2 Watching TV .
2 Sitting inactive in a public place (e.g. theatre or a meeting).
2 As a passenger in a car for an hour without a break.
2 Lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit.
2 Sitting and talking to someone.
2 Sitting quietly after lunch without alcohol.
2 In a car, while stopped for a few minutes in the traffic.
Possible results
ESS score is the sum of eight item scores and can range from 0 to 24.

Interpretation
Clinically normal score 10. Each ESS item gives an estimate of sleep
propensity in one of eight specific situations whereas the total ESS score

Exercise testing
Clinical indications
2 To confirm that reduced exercise tolerance exists.
2 To determine the degree of impairment and disability.
2 To investigate which system appears responsible for the reduction.
2 To evaluate treatment results.
2 To plan rehabilitation.
Patient preparation
1. Evaluate patients medical history for contraindications to test.
2. Warn patient of cardiovascular complications*.
3. Obtain written consent.
4. Patient to wear comfortable clothes and shoes.
5. Monitoring: ECG, O2 saturation, BP.
6. Exercise: treadmill/bike/free run on flat surface.
7. Steady state 512min walking test (usually 6min) or stepped stress test.
8. During a maximal exercise test the patient should be able to achieve
8590% of predicted maximum heart rate.

362

Contraindications to test
2 Unstable myocardium (recent MI , unstable angina, arrhythmias, severe
valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure).
2 Acute asthma.
2 Acute febrile illness.
2 Uncontrolled diabetes.
2 Systemic hypertension (systolic >200mmHg, diastolic >120mmHg).
Possible results
Cardiac response: ECG, BP, cardiac output and stroke volume response.
Ventilatory response: ventilatory limitation (reduced breathing reserve),
pattern of response, VT, minute volume, respiratory rate.
Gas exchange: arterial blood gases, A-a gradient, PaCO2.
Ventilatory (anaerobic) threshold: normal or 5.
VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake) normal or 5.
*Mortality = 1 per 10000 tests

8 Respiratory medicine
Interpretation
Useful in making the distinction between exertional dyspnoea secondary
to lung disease or fatigue secondary to cardiac dysfunction. In patients
known to have asthma, exercise test is +ve in 75% of cases with a single
treadmill run and 97% if the test is repeated in ve responders. A fall of
10% or more from baseline in PEFR or FEV1 suggests exercise-induced
asthma.
Advantages over other tests
Best assessment of exercise capacity. Adds to diagnostic accuracy quantitatively (measurement of work capacity, maximum VO2 and sustained
work capacity) and qualitatively (identification of the cause of exercise limitation).
Ancillary tests
2 Static lung function tests.
2 For asthma: histamine/methacholine inhalation challenges PEFR diary.
Pitfalls
2 Dependent on patient effort and compliance.
2 Not suitable for patients with severe objective measurement of respiratory impairment.
Complications
iBronchospasm: usually easily reversed with an inhaled adrenergic agent.
iCardiac arrhythmias/arrest: appropriate equipment and drugs should be
available in the exercise testing area. Personnel should be trained in basic
and advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Technician explains procedure to patient.
Mouthpiece in position, patient breathes in maximally and then out as
hard and fast as possible.
3 acceptable manoeuvres should be performed. Patients must perform
the test with maximal effort each time and the results should be similar
for each of the 3 attempts.

Interpretation
Particularly useful in recognising patients with narrowing of the central
airway (larynx and trachea). Narrowing at this site has greatest effect on
maximum expiratory flow and also on maximum inspiratory flow giving
rise to a characteristic appearance. Also identifies patients with reduced
elastic recoil (bullae, emphysema) or reduced airway lumen (asthma,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiolitis).
Oscillation of flow gives a saw tooth pattern. This usually signifies instability of the upper airway and has been observed in obstructive sleep
apnoea, thermal injury to the airway, bulbar muscle weakness, extrapyramidal neuromuscular disorders, upper airway stenosis/tracheomalacia and
snoring.
Advantages over other tests
Allows early detection of small airway diseasemore sensitive than

Gelb AF, MacAnally BJ. (1973) Early detection of obstructive lung disease by analysis of maximal
expiratory flow-volume curves. Chest 64, 749753.

8 Respiratory medicine
Guidelines to patients should include:
1. Perform the test standing (if possible).
2. Hold the meter lightly and do not interfere with the movement of the
marker.
3. Perform three tests each time and record the largest value.
Readings should be taken at various times throughout the day. Limiting the
patient to two readings in each day may aid compliance. In occupational
asthma 2-hourly peak flow readings are required during the day and
evening.
Possible results
2 Diurnal variability: as measured by the lowest PEFR value (usually on
waking) and the highest PEFR value (usually in the afternoon/evening).
2 Patient symptoms and PEFR can be examined together.
Interpretation
Diurnal variation is increased in patients with asthma compared to
normals (amplitude >20%), i.e. peak flow falls significantly overnight and in
the early morning.
Advantages over other tests
2 Cheap.
2 Saves time of respiratory physician and technician.
2 Reproducible.
2 Objective measure of response to treatment.

Pitfalls
2 Not all asthma exacerbations are associated with increased diurnal
368
variability.
2 Calculating diurnal variation can be complicated and tedious.
2 Time of recording or recent use of 2 agonist drugs may result in minor
changes in peak flow, but can cause large errors in diurnal variability.
2 Dependent on patient understanding, cooperation and accuracy.

Pleural needle biopsy
Clinical indications
Pleural effusion of unknown aetiology especially if TB or malignancy suspected. Note: May be combined with diagnostic and/or therapeutic pleural

8 Respiratory medicine
aspiration. In which case, obtain diagnostic fluid sample first, then do
needle biopsy, then follow with therapeutic aspiration.
Patient preparation
1. Informed written consent.
2. Patient sits with arms forward supported on table/pillows.
3. Posterior or mid-axillary approach.
4. Skin cleaned with iodine solution.
5. Lignocaine (1 or 5%) infiltrated in rib interspace: check pleural fluid
aspirated.
6. Stab incision with narrow scalpel.
7. Insert closed Abrams needle (requires firm pressure to be applied until
penetrates parietal pleura: take care not to apply too much force).
8. Attach 50mL syringe.
9. Twist open Abrams needle.
10.Aspirate fluid to ensure needle in pleural space.
11.Withdraw needle at angle to chest wall until side hole snags parietal
pleura.
12.Maintain lateral pressure and rotate to close hole thereby cutting
biopsy. Remove needle and extract biopsy tissue.
13.Repeat with samples taken from 3, 6 and 9 oclock (avoid the 12
oclock position to avoid the neurovascular bundle).
14.May require suture to close.
15.Apply dressing.
16.Obtain CXR post-procedure.
17.Place samples in formalin for histological examination and saline for
microbiological culture.
Possible results
2 Slivers of white pleural tissue.
2 Examine histology and culture for AFB s.
Interpretation
2 Malignant mesothelioma may be diagnosed on histology, especially
with addition of immunohistochemical methods looking at tumour cell
markers.
2 More sensitive than pleural fluid aspiration in diagnosing TB .
2 Carcinoma cells may arise from direct spread from lung primary or
represent secondary carcinoma. In either case, management is palliative.
Advantages over other tests
Easy, quick, cheap; more reliable than diagnostic pleural aspiration.
Less invasive than thoracoscopy for diagnosis of TB.

Polysomnography
Clinical indications
Note: Symptoms alone do not help predict which patient with sleep disturbance has obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).
2
2
2
2
2

Patients with low probability sleep disorder, e.g. snores with no other
features suggestive of OSA.
Patients with high probability sleep disorder, e.g. typical symptoms and
physiognomy. Need study for diagnosis and assessment of severity.
Known OSA: assessing treatment response.
Assessment of nocturnal hypoventilation syndromes, e.g. scoliosis.
Patients with unexplained sleepwake disorders.

patients who may have the sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Thorax 50, 883886.

8 Respiratory medicine
Possible results
Original diagnosis of OSA based on polysomnographyovernight
recording of sleep, breathing patterns and oxygenation. It is relatively
expensive and most centres use a combination of video to assess quality
of sleep, identify transient arousals and paroxysmal leg movement disorder (PLMD) and oximetry (to detect desaturation) plus some form of
measuring the breathing pattern to detect hypopnoea.
Interpretation
Obstructive sleep apnoea diagnosed in the context of multiple (typically
>15/h) hypopnoeic/apnoeic events occurring throughout the night and
resulting in desaturation.
Advantages over other tests
Demonstrates number of hypopnoeic (reduction in breathing) or apnoeic
(absence of breathing) events occurring per hour. May be used to monitor
effectiveness of treatment.
Ancillary tests
Epworth sleepiness score.
Pitfalls
2 Expensive.
2 Time-consuming.
2 Most sleep study systems are poorly validated therefore need expert
interpretation of results to consider false positives and negatives.
2 Patients need to sleep for >3h/night and have rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep.

Pulse oximetry
Clinical indications
2 Any acutely unwell patientavoids repeated blood gas measurements
provided that hypercarbia is absent.
2 Monitoring of long term oxygen therapy (LTOT )but not suitable for
initial assessment.
2 Assessment of nocturnal FiO2 and screening for sleep apnoea syndromeidentification of nocturnal desaturations.
2 Exercise walk test.
Patient preparation
1. Clean probe site (ear or finger).
2. Ensure good contact of probe with warm well-perfused skin.
3. Avoid nail-varnished fingers.
Possible results

Interpretation
2 Respiratory failure unlikely if O2 saturation >92% on air.
2 Provides almost immediate arterial oxygen saturation data.
2 Must know the inspired oxygen (FiO2) concentration the patient is
breathing.
Advantages over other tests
2 Non-invasive.
2 Easy, cheap.
2 Instantaneous.
2 Sensitive.
2 Portable.
Ancillary tests
Arterial blood gas sampling.
Pitfalls
Does not detect carbon dioxide levels.
If carboxyhaemoglobin or methaemoglobin are present in the blood in
elevated levels the pulse oximeter will give a falsely elevated reading
for the arterial oxygen saturation.
2 4 in jaundice.
2 Erroneous information if patient poorly perfused.
2 Excessive patient movement can give false readings.
2
2

Spirometry
Clinical indications
2 To evaluate symptoms, signs or abnormal test results.
2 Provide objective, quantifiable measures of lung function.
2 Evaluate and monitor disease.
2 Assess effects of environmental/occupational/drug exposures both
adverse (e.g. amiodarone) and beneficial (e.g. bronchodilators).
2 Pre-operative assessment.
2 Employment/insurance assessment.
2 Early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans in lung transplant patients.

372 Patient preparation

1. Explain what the test involves. Most respiratory technicians demonstrate technique to ensure maximal effort and cooperation of patient.
2. Patient must fully inhale before test.
3. Exhale into breathing tube. Must be maximal effort with no hesitation.
4. No cough/glottal closure in the first second.
5. Test must last at least 6s (up to 15s with obstruction).
6. No evidence of airflow leak/obstruction of mouthpiece.
Possible results
FEV1:

Forced expiratory volume in 1 s.
Test of mechanical function of the lungs.
Depends on size and elastic properties of the lungs, calibre of the
bronchial tree and collapsibility of airway walls.

FVC:

Forced vital capacity.

8 Respiratory medicine
Interpretation
At least three acceptable tracings should be obtained. Examine each
tracing to ensure adequate effort made by patient, that it is reproducible,
and that there are no artefacts.
FEV/FVC ratio:

Index of the presence/absence of airflow limitation.
Young and middle aged healthy non-smokers rate 75%.
Older normal patients ratio 7075%.

FEV/FVC 5:

Obstructive.
Classify severity using FEV, expressed as % of predicted
value, e.g. COPD, asthma.

FEV/FVC 6 or 4

Restrictive but need reduced TLC to confirm,
e.g. lung fibrosis, chest wall problems, pulmonary
effusion and oedema.

If used for monitoring purposes need adequate baseline study.

Advantages over other tests
2 Cheap, quick.
2 Bedside/outpatient test.
2 Reproducible.
Ancillary tests
Total lung capacity to confirm interstitial disease with restrictive
spirometry.
2 Pre- and post-bronchodilator studies: an increase of 15% in FEV 1 and
20% in FVC suggest reversibility.
2

Pitfalls
Need standardisation of normal data for height, weight, age, sex and
race.
2 Level at which a result may be considered abnormal is contentious,
usually accepted to be outside range of 80120% of mean predicted.
2 FEV may remain relatively normal in early stages of generalised lung
disease.

FEV/FVC ratio is good guide to presence or significant airway narrowing but as disease progresses, both will fall and correlation with
severity of disease is poor.
Variability (noise) is greater in pulmonary function tests than in most other
clinical laboratory tests because of the inconsistency of effort by patients.

Pitfalls
2 Sputum may be diluted by saliva.
2 Diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is not as robust as for small cell
lung cancer or adenocarcinoma. Needs careful cross referencing to
radiology and should be confirmed if possible with biopsies.
2 Negative results should not preclude further investigations if malignancy suspected.

Static lung volumes/whole body
plethysmography
375
Clinical indications
2 Differentiate between obstructive and restrictive disease patterns.
2 Identify and quantify trapped air (shown by 4 RV/TLC ratio).
2 Assess response to therapeutic interventions (e.g. drugs, radiation,
transplantation).
2 Identify presence and amount of unventilated lung.
2 Assess chronic lung disease (e.g. sarcoidosis, rheumatoid lung).
2 Pre-operative assessment.
2 Assessment of pulmonary disability.
Patient preparation
1. Ask patient to wear comfortable clothes.
2. Place mouthpiece securely in mouth with lips tight around it.
3. Breathe in a relaxed manner through spirometer system (nose clips
mandatory).

4. After total of 5 tidal breaths with consistent end-expiratory levels,
patient asked to maximally inspire to total lung capacity followed by
exhalation with encouragement to force out the last 515% of air.
5. A minimum of 2 attempts should be obtained.
6. More may be needed in the young and elderly to obtain reproducible
results.
Most accurate results are obtained with whole body plethysmography.
Possible results
Total lung capacity
Volume of air in the lungs at the end of full inspiration.
Residual volume
Volume of air remaining in the lungs after maximal expiration.
Vital capacity
The amount of air expired (or inspired) between maximum inspiration
and maximum expiration.
Functional residual capacity
The amount of air in the lungs at the end-tidal position.
Inspiratory capacity
The maximum amount of air that can be breathed into the lungs from the
end-tidal position.
Tidal volume
The volume of air inspired and expired with each breath.

e.g. asthma, emphysema, COPD

Causes of 5 FRC:

377
Interpretation
Only interpret if test is reproducible, i.e. if the 2 largest vital capacity
values are within 5% or 100mL (whichever is the larger).
VC may remain within normal range in some pulmonary disease, e.g.
emphysema.

5 VC: restrictive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
During the testing process, the patient is enclosed in a chamber equipped
to measure either pressure, flow or volume changes. Because all the gas in
the thorax is accounted for, this method is particularly useful in patients
with trapped gas, e.g. bullous emphysema.

Advantages over other tests
Reproducible.
Pitfalls
2 Patient cooperation essential: they must provide maximal effort and be
capable of understanding instructions.
2 Calibration should take place on a regular basis.
2 Risk of disease transmission between patients and between patient and
technician, therefore avoid if pulmonary TB suspected.

Sweat test
Clinical indications
Suspected cystic fibrosis (CF) in the context of
2 Bronchiectasis/recurrent chest infections.
2 Pancreatic insufficiency/diabetes mellitus.
2 Family history.
2 Fertility problems.
Patient preparation
1. Obtain informed consent: verbal usually sufficient but important to
discuss reasons for test and possible implications. Perform two sweat
tests simultaneously on each arm for greater accuracy.
2. Induce sweating by pilocarpine iontophoresis; a weak electrical current
aids penetration of pilocarpine into skin. Stimulated in this way, the
sweat glands of the forearm, previously washed and dried, secrete
sweat.
3. Collect sweat on preweighed filter paper (>100mg), then measure
eluted Na+ and Cl.

378

Possible results
2 9899% of children homozygous for CF have sweat Cl and Na+ levels
well >70 and 60mmol/L respectively.
2 Sweat Na+ concentrations tend to increase with age and show wide
variability between individuals.
2 Diagnostic accuracy is improved in borderline cases by a suppression
test using fludrocortisone.
Interpretation
A +ve test is virtually diagnostic of cystic fibrosis. This should lead to
counselling and genetic testing.
Equivocal results are defined as Na+ or Cl concentrations between 50
and 70mmol/L.
The diagnosis should never rest on the sweat test alone and should be
considered together with the clinical findings and laboratory evidence of
pancreatic insufficiency.
Advantages over other tests
2 Cheaper than genetic tests.
2 Assesses functional deficit therefore capable of detecting patients who
have rare variants of CF.

8 Respiratory medicine
Ancillary tests
2 Nasal potential difference.
2 Pancreatic function tests (3-day faecal collection).
2 Genetic studies.
Pitfalls
A wide discrepancy between the results from each arm suggests a
problem with technique.
2 Accurate interpretation of sweat tests requires knowledge of the agerelated changes in sweat Na+ and Cl concentrations and should be
done in a specialised centre.
2

False negatives
Inexperience of operator.
Low rates of sweating.
Poor skin preparation.
Poor iontophoretic contact with skin.
Faulty chemical analysis.

3. Basic monitoring: pulse oximeter and cardiac monitor.
4. Supplementary oxygen given if necessary.
5. Intravenous sedation: midazolam
6. An absolute prerequisite for thoracoscopy is the presence of an adequate pleural space (i.e. at least 610cm diameter)
7. If pleural effusion: drain using 3-way tap. Replace with equal quantity

2 Biopsy of parietal and visceral pleurahistology/culture esp. AFB s.
2 Pleural fluid 7 MC&S
7 cytology.
2 Therapeutic options: pleurodesis, coagulation of blebs, resection of fibrinous loculations in empyemas.
2 Drainage of large pleural effusions possible without risk of re-expansion pulmonary oedema due to rapid equalisation of pressures by
entrance of air into pleural space.

380

Interpretation
Macroscopic appearance of pleura may be diagnostic, e.g. TB, RA, scleroderma, metastatic disease.
Advantages over other tests
2 Better than blind pleural biopsy.
2 Able to obtain diagnosis in 7095% of cases.
2 Especially good at diagnosing TB .
2 Less invasive than thoracotomy.
2 Less expensive than thoracotomy: does not require a theatre or anaesthetist.
2 Done under sedation unlike VATS (video-assisted thoracic surgery)
which requires a GA and selective one-lung ventilation.
Ancillary tests
Diagnosis of mesothelioma improved with use of immunohistochemical
markers.

Patient preparation
2 Avoid smoking 6h prior and strenuous exercise 2h prior.
2 Allow 1530min for test.
2 Usually measured by single breath inhalation technique.
2 Patient breathes in air containing a known concentration of CO and
holds breath for 10s.
Possible results
2 Transfer factor (TLCO ).
2 Transfer coefficient (KCO ).
2 May need to correct for anaemia:

381

 Effect of mild anaemia (Hb >10g/dL) slight but becomes progressively more marked at lower values.
Interpretation

2 Obstructive lung disease, e.g. COPD , emphysema.
2 Diffuse interstitial lung disease, e.g. CFA , amiodarone lung.
2 Pulmonary involvement in systemic disease e.g. SLE , RA , Wegeners.
2 Cardiovascular disease e.g. pulmonary oedema, mitral stenosis, PE .
2 Others: anaemia, cigarette smoking.
4 in DLCO
2 Diseases associated with polycythaemia.
2 Pulmonary haemorrhage.
2 Diseases associated with increased pulmonary blood such as from left

2 Asthmatics (reasons not clear).
Advantages over other tests
Quick.
Relatively easy to perform.
Reproducible.

2
2
2

Pitfalls
Breath holding time may be difficult for some patients to achieve.
Calculation of TLCO is based on assumption that ventilation and diffusion are homogeneous in the entire lung. With unequal distribution of
ventilation and diffusion, the TLCO will be underestimated on the alveolar level.
2 With extrapulmonary lung restriction and consequent inability to
achieve full inspiration, KCO tends to be higher than normal.

Indications
2 Meningitis.
2 Encephalitis.
2 Polyradiculitis, polyneuritis.
2 Multiple sclerosis.
2 Myelitis.
2 Vasculitis.
2 Suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH ). Note: In general, a ve
CT does not exclude a SAH.
2 Suspected malignancy with meningeal involvement.
2 Assessment of CSF pressure:
 High (e.g. idiopathic or benign intracranial hypertension, BIH).
 Low (e.g. low pressure headache).
2 Therapeutic trials, e.g.
 BIH.
 Normal pressure hydrocephalus, NPH (not particularly helpful).
2 To seek specific antibodies/markers in CSF, e.g.
 HIV.
 Lyme (Borrelia).
 Syphilis.
 ACE (for neurosarcoid).
 Tumour markers.
Preparation
Decide exactly what investigations you want. If necessary, alert the
appropriate laboratories and organise transport of samples. In particular, samples for xanthochromia and cytology should be rapidly taken
to the laboratory to be spun down.
2 If the patient is also due to have a neuroradiological investigation with
contrast and LP is not urgent, delay LP until after scan as there may be
diffuse meningeal enhancement after the LP.
2 If the patient is extremely anxious, he may benefit from 510mg of oral
diazepam prior to the LP.
2

Procedure
1. Explain to the patient what you are about to do.
2. Arrange all your equipment on a sterile tray, including assembled CSF
manometer.
384 3. Position patient on his side, with back perpendicular to bed, at the
edge of a firm bed. Place head on one pillow. Draw knees up and place
one pillow between them.
4. Adjust height of bed so that you are comfortable.
5. Identify the bony landmarks. L3/L4 space is in line with the iliac crests,
and is most commonly used. L2/L3 to L5/S1 are also. If you like, mark
the target space with the imprint of your thumb nail. Take time over
these first three stages.
6. The insertion of the needle should be a sterile procedure. Clean the
skin over the lower back. Don sterile gloves and mask.
7. Insert a little (0.250.5mL) local anaesthetictoo much can obscure
the bony landmarks.
8. Pass LP needle horizontally into the space, with tip angled at about
1015 (toward the umbilicus), in the midline horizontal plane. At all
times, stylet should be fully inserted and bevel of needle facing up.

9 Neurology
9. Slight resistance should be felt as needle passes through ligamentum
flavum and the dura, and then a give as it enters the subarachnoid
space.
10.Slowly withdraw the stylet. CSF drops should appear.
11.If CSF does not appear, reinsert the style and slightly rotate the
needlethis sometimes frees it of obstructing nerve roots. A gentle
cough from the patient can also help.
12.If the needle encounters bone, or the patient complains of pains
shooting down the leg, check the position of the needle (is it in the
midline? Is it angled correctly?) and then withdraw it entirely.
13.Insert a fresh needle, correcting for any error noted above.
14.If this second pass is unsuccessful, withdraw needle and inform patient.
If he is happy for you to proceed, then attempt LP in another space,
repeating all steps from 4 down. Use a fresh needle.
15.If you fail again, explain to patient and seek a more experienced operator to perform the LP. Multiple failed attempts are painful and discouraging (to both you and your patient).
16.If a more experienced operator fails, ask your friendly radiologist to do
it under X-ray guidance, but give him the help he requests and precise
instructions about the samples required.
17.When CSF collection is complete, gently pull out the needle and place
a sterile dressing over the insertion site.
18.Allow the patient to mobilise shortly after the LP.
Measuring the CSF pressure
As soon as the CSF starts to flow, attach the pre-assembled manometer.
Wait until the CSF stops rising. If the patient is very anxious, or uncomfortable, a falsely raised opening pressure may be recorded. Sometimes
having the patient slightly relax his legs will help. Using the three way tap,
let the CSF run into your first pre-labelled tube (do not waste the CSF!).
Having collected all the CSF you require, if the opening pressure was elevated, note the closing pressure.
Collecting samples
2 As always, tailor your investigations to the clinical picture. If you are
just checking the CSF pressure, then no samples need necessarily be
collected. If you suspect a subarachnoid haemorrhage, collect three
samples in sequentially labelled bottles and send promptly to the labo385
ratory for quantitative estimation of xanthochromia and haemoglobin
breakdown products. If you are looking for evidence of malignant cells,
then at least one sample should be send to the laboratory promptly
for cytology.
2 To avoid contamination, allow the microbiology lab to split samples
rather than attempting this yourself.
2 Collect at least 10 drops in each bottle. The microbiology and cytology
laboratories in particular will thank you for greater volumes.
2 As soon as the CSF is collected, a blood sample should be obtained (if
necessary) for glucose and oligoclonal band detection.
Alternative positioning of patient
Sometimes there is a dry tap if the CSF pressure is too low to distend the
lumbar cistern. This can sometimes be overcome by performing the LP

with the patient sitting on a firm reversed chair, leaning forward to bend
over its back. This manoeuvre maximises the separation of the vertebrae.
Again the needle should be angled, slightly (10) upward relative to the
spine at that point. This position does not allow precise measurement of
CSF pressure.
Which needle to use?
22G usually appropriate. Needles with larger bores tend to cause a
greater CSF leak (and thus more headache). Some advocate even finer
needles, but these make the collection of CSF take too long. Blunt anaesthetists needles probably also reduce the risk of post-LP headache.
Clinical record keeping
Record what you did in the notes after the procedure (e.g. if more than
one pass was required; which space you used), the opening and closing
CSF pressure, and what investigations you have requested. Note the
appearance of the CSF (if normal, it will be clear and colourless). If the CSF
appears bloody, record this and whether the final bottle collected is
clearer than the first.
When not to attempt an LP
2 Risk of herniation:
 Space-occupying lesions.
 Non-communicating hydrocephalus.
 Cerebral oedema (if in doubt, cranial imaging should be performed
first).
2 Uncorrected bleeding diathesis/anticoagulant use.
2 Caution) if previous lumbar spine surgery or known anatomical abnormalities.
2 Local skin sepsis.
Complications and what to do about them
Headache
2 Usually starts within 24h of LP .
2 May last from a few hours to 2 weeks, but typically several days.
2 Probably related to persistent CSF leak via the dural tear; therefore
tends to have low pressure characteristics (frontal, worse on sitting
up, better on lying down). There may be mild meningism and nausea.
2 Treatment has traditionally involved bedrest, analgesia and the encouragement of plenty of fluids.
386 2 If nausea is a major problem, the patient may require IV fluids.
2 Rarely, if the headache is severe and persistent, then an anaesthetist
may place an autologous blood patch to plug the dural tear. Surgical
intervention is rarely required.
Low backache
2 A variety of causes of post-LP backache exist; these may usually be
treated conservatively.
Infection
2 Very rare if sterile technique is used. Occasionally may occur if the
needle passes through a region of infection. Meningitis typically
develops within 12h; very rarely there may be an epidural abscesses
or vertebral osteomyelitis. Treat with appropriate antibiotics and if
necessary surgery.

9 Neurology
Herniation
2 Uncal or cerebellar herniation may occur, particularly in the presence
of a posterior fossa mass. iiAn LP should not be performed if there
is suspicion of raised intracranial pressure without first obtaining
cranial CT or MR imaging.
2 Should the CSF pressure be found to be very high (300mm of CSF ),
even after relaxing patient, and in the absence of idiopathic (benign)
intracranial hypertension, manage as follows: nurse patient prone with
no pillow, raise foot of bed, start infusion of 20% mannitol at 1g/kg
over 20min, start neurological observation chart, arrange urgent CT of
brain and notify neurosurgeons. iiDo not instill saline into the subarachnoid space.
Haemorrhage
2 A traumatic tap may cause a little local bleeding, which is rarely of clinical significance. Patients with impaired clotting (remember warfarin) or
platelet function are at risk of more extensive bleeding, and LP should
not be attempted unless the coagulopathy is corrected. An arachnoiditis
or a spinal subdural or epidural haemorrhage may develop.

Rules of thumb
1. Pressure:
 4 by space-occupying lesions within the cranial vault, such as
387
oedema, masses, chronic inflammation.
 4 by increased central venous pressure, e.g. in the anxious patient
with tensed abdominal muscles.
 5 if the spinal subarachnoid space is obstructed, thus impeding CSF
flow.
2. Cells:
 Polymorphs (neutrophils): suggest acute bacterial infection.
 Lymphocytes & monocytes: viral and chronic infections or tumours.
 Eosinophils: tumours, parasites, foreign body reactions.
3. Glucose: 5 by non-viral processes causing meningeal inflammation.
4. Total protein: 4 by breakdown of the bloodbrain barrier.
5. Immunoglobulins specific to the CSF, i.e. without matching Igs in a
simultaneous blood sample: inflammation within the theca, e.g. MS,
infection, tissue damage.

Ultrasound
Ultrasound may be used in a variety of modes.
Mostly commonly used in neuroradiology
2 B mode: gives 2-dimensional images.
2 Doppler effect is used to assess alterations in the pattern (especially
velocity) of flow in vessels.
2 Duplex scanning combines B mode and Doppler.
Extracranial vessels
B mode
2 Can image from clavicle (common carotid bifurcation), and internal and
external carotids to angle of jaw.
2 Can image proximal and distal subclavian, and vertebral arteries.
2 Supraorbital artery (anterior circulation).
390 2 Fibrofatty plaques and thrombus on plaques not very echogenic therefore missable.
2 Fibrous plaques more echogenic.
2 Calcification in plaque is highly echogenic.
2 Can sometimes detect intraplaque haemorrhage or ulceration.
Note: Requires patient cooperation and considerable operator skill. High
grade stenosis can appear as total occlusion.
Doppler mode
2 Stenosis alters the normal pattern of velocities recorded.

9 Neurology
Duplex
2 Combination of anatomic and flow imaging more sensitive and specific
for clinically significant stenoses.
Comment
Use of carotid ultrasound: most commonly in the assessment of patients
with carotid territory ischaemic strokes or TIAs, who might be candidates
for carotid endarterectomy. Recent work suggests that there is little value
in performing such studies >2 years after a cerebral event. Irregular
plaques are more pathogenic.

2 Suspected cerebral vasculitis.
2 Delineation of other vascular abnormalities (e.g. arteriovenous malformations, AVM).
2 Delineation of tumour blood supply (occasionally).

Procedure
1. Catheter passed via femoral artery to carotid or vertebral artery under

Although CT and MRI give finer spatial details, angiography is still useful, e.g. delineating blood
supply of a tumour.

Myelography
Indications
2 Largely superseded by CT and especially MRI .
2 Still used in subjects in whom MRI is contraindicated (e.g. cardiac pacemaker, metallic implants, claustrophobia).
2 Can screen whole spinal cord and cauda equina for compressive or
expanding lesions.
2 Can visualise roots.
2 Spinal vasculature abnormalities.

392 Procedure
525mL of (usually water-soluble) radio-opaque contrast medium is
injected via an LP needle in the usual location (occasionally cisternal puncture is used). By tipping the patient on a tilt table, the whole spinal subarachnoid space may be visualised.
Complications
2 Those of LP .
2 Spinal arachnoiditis (after months or years), now rare with watersoluble contrast.
2 Acute deterioration if there is cord/root compression.
2 Direct neurotoxicity (3 in 10,000):
 Seizures, encephalopathy.
 Usually resolves in 48h.

Allergic reaction to contrast:
 Give dexamethasone 4mg 12 and 2h prior to investigation if known

Radionuclide scans
Gamma camera scanning
2 Give potassium perchlorate (to stop choroid plexus and salivary gland
uptake).
2 Then 99m - technetium labelled sodium pertechnetate IV .
2 Look at intracranial distribution with gamma camera from lateral, anterior, and posterior views.
What does it show?
2 Areas of increased vascularity.
2 Areas of BBB breakdown.
However it has been superseded by CT and MRI and is rarely available.
Positron emission tomography (PET)
Unstable positron-emitting isotopes (produced locally by a cyclotron or
linear accelerator) are incorporated into biologically active compounds.
The distribution of isotope shortly after IV administration is plotted. A
range of compounds may be labelled, such as ligands for specific neurotransmitter receptors. Commonly, PET is used to determine regional
cerebral blood flow.
Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
Stable radioactive isotopes are incorporated into biologically active
compounds.
2 Their distribution after IV administration is plotted.
2 These images often lack fine spatial detail.
2

Although the range of ligands available is limited, SPECT has certain advantages over PET:
2 Isotopes are stable and therefore a cyclotron or linear accelerator
need not be on site.
2 A labelled ligand can be given after a clinically important event, e.g. can
give agent and scan within 20min of the occurrence of a seizure.
Uses of PET and SPECT
PET is not widely available as a clinical tool. With the advent of functional
MRI (FMRI), the uses of PET in both clinical practice and in neuroscience
research may well become more restricted. SPECT is more widely available in clinical centres.

393

Clinical/research applications of PET and SPECT have included
Determination of regional cerebral blood flow, glucose metabolism and
oxygen utilisation
2 Hypometabolism may be seen following a stroke. The affected area
may exceed that with a demonstrable lesion on conventional CT or
MR imaging.
2 The epileptogenic focus may show interictal hypometabolism (ictal
hypermetabolism may be demonstrated with SPECT).
2 Regional hypometabolism may be seen in Alzheimers, Parkinsons and
related degenerative conditions.
2 Pseudodementia secondary to psychiatric disease such as depression
(with normal SPECT scans) may sometimes be differentiated from
dementia due to organic neurological disease (with regional hypoperfusion), although psychiatric diseases may themselves be associated
with regional hypoperfusion.
In vivo pharmacology (e.g. distribution of neurotransmitter receptors).

Cranial CT
Now widely available; it should be considered a basic neurological tool.
Look for
2 Disturbances in the normal anatomy of the ventricular system.
2 Skull base and vault.
2 Width of cortical fissures/sulci.
2 Midline shift.
2 Areas of abnormal tissue density.
2 Opacity or lucency of sinuses.
2 Normal flow voids.
High density (white) signal
2 Fresh blood.

9 Neurology
After administration of IV contrast medium, areas with a breakdown in the
bloodbrain barrier may enhance (appear white). This may reveal previously invisible lesions (isodense with the surrounding tissue). Especially
useful for tumour and infection.
Common patterns of enhancement include
2 Ring enhancement of tumours and abscesses.
2 Solid enhancement of meningiomas.
2 Meningeal enhancement with meningeal disease involvement.
CT of spine
MRI is usually preferable but plain CT can give information about the discs

and bony architecture. After myelography compressive lesions can be
demonstrated.
OHCM p394.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
imaging
For most applications, MRI is superior to CT, but has more restricted
availability.
Note: MRI is not safe in the presence of ferromagnetic materials
(e.g. certain prostheses, metal filings in the eye).
Most common sequences are T1 and T2, but increasingly other sequences
are being used clinically, such as FLAIR, proton density.
In general
2 T1 CSF is hypointense (black); fat and mature blood clot white.
2 T2 CSF is hyperintense (white).
MRI with enhancement

Intravenously administered gadolinium leaks through areas of damaged

raphy remains a gold standard for many purposes, MR angiography has
the advantage of being non-invasive and therefore safe. MRA images flow
rather than structure, and therefore may fail to pick up low flow abnormalities such as cavernous angiomas.
Uses
2 Assessment of patency of major arterial and venous vessels.
2 Visualisation of large (~3mm diameter) aneurysms.
Functional MRI (FMRI)
A recent development allows certain (indirect) indices of neural activity
(most commonly changes reflecting regional perfusion) to be imaged with
sufficient temporal resolution to be useful for both research and clinical
applications (although FMRI has been largely a research tool to date). As a
conventional MRI machine, albeit with special software, is required, it is
likely that FMRI will become a widely used clinical tool.
Clinical and research applications have included
2 Demonstration of the language areas prior to epilepsy surgery.
2 Demonstration of the functional anatomy of cognitive, sensory and
396
motor processes.

Nerve conduction studies
Sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and sensory conduction
velocity
Procedure
Orthodromic conduction velocity: electrically stimulates distal sensory
branches (e.g. index finger) and records the evoked sensory nerve action
potential (SNAP) proximally (e.g. over median nerve at wrist). The distance between the two sites (D) and the latency (L) of the onset of the
SNAP determine the sensory conduction velocity (D/L). The SNAP amplitude is also useful.
Antidromic conduction velocity: supramaximal electrical stimulation proximally; records distally (e.g. by a ring electrode on little finger). By varying
the position of the stimulating electrode, the conduction velocity in
various portions of the nerve may be ascertained.

Motor velocities are more commonly measured

Motor conduction velocity
Procedure
Supramaximally stimulate a peripheral nerve trunk at a proximal (p) and a
more distal (d) site. Record the time to the onset of the evoked muscle 397
response (CMAP) from each (Tp and Td), and the distance between them
(D). The motor conduction velocity between p and d is therefore D/(Tp-Td).
Typical values
2 Median nerve in forearm (to abductor pollicis brevis) >48m/s.
2 Ulnar nerve in forearm (to abductor digiti minimi) >48m/s.
2 Common peroneal nerve (to extensor digitorum brevis) >40m/s.
What does it mean?
See table below.
Distal motor latency
Latency from stimulation of most distal site on nerve to CMAP.

Typical values
2 Median nerve (wrist to abductor pollicis brevis) <4.1m/s.
2 Ulnar nerve (wrist to abductor digiti minimi) <3.8m/s.
2 Radial nerve (spiral groove to brachioradialis) <5m/s.
Note: These latencies include time taken for impulses to pass along the
most distal (unmyelinated) portion of the nerve, and for transmission at
the neuromuscular junction (therefore they may not be used to calculate
nerve conduction velocities). Compare with velocities elsewhere in the
nerve being studied.
What does it mean?
4 DML seen in:
2 Conditions in which the very distal segment of a nerve is compromised
(most commonly carpal tunnel syndrome).
2 Early demyelinating neuropathy (e.g Guillain-Barr Syndrome).
2 Chronic demyelinating neuropathy.
Compound motor action potential (CMAP)
The waveform, amplitude and area-under-the-curve of the CMAP reflect
the number of depolarised muscle fibres (e.g. reduced in axonal neuropathy and denervated muscle) and the temporal dispersion of conduction velocities in the motor neurones to them (e.g. increased in
demyelinating neuropathy).

What are your laboratorys current values?

Late responses
F wave:
2 If a motor nerve is stimulated, there are orthodromically directed
action potentials that may cause a response in the muscle (CMAP).
However, antidromically directed action potentials will also pass proximally towards the cell body. If these result in sufficient depolarisation
of the axon hillock, then a second orthodromic volley will pass down
the nerve. This may cause a second motor action potential (the F wave).
Therefore the F wave (i) does not involve synapses (other than the neuro-

9 Neurology

2

muscular junction of course) and (ii) depends on the integrity of the
whole axon.
It may be difficult to elicit.

Delay or absence of the F wave may reflect a lesion proximal to the site of
stimulation, in parts of the nerve that may be inaccessible to electrodes,
e.g. brachial plexopathy or thoracic outlet syndrome. May also be an early
feature in GBD.
H wave:
2 This is an electrical ankle jerk: submaximal stimulation of posterior
tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa causes trans-synaptic activation of
soleus, recorded as a CMAP.
2 Amplitude may be 5 by afferent or efferent problems, e.g. neuropathy
or radiculopathy.
Repetitive stimulation
Procedure
2 Stimulate a motor nerve with short trains of 24Hz while recording
evoked CMAPs.
Normal response
2 No change in CMAP potential.
In myasthenia gravis
2 >10% decrement in CMAP amplitude after 12 of stimulation.
2 After 1030 of voluntary contraction of the muscle, the CMAP returns
to normal.
In Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome
After voluntary contraction, or after rapid stimulation (2050Hz), the
CMAP amplitude, often initially small, increases by 25% (suggestive) or
100% (diagnostic). At a slow (3Hz) rate of stimulation, there is a response
decrement.

EMG
Procedure
2 A concentric needle electrode is usually used.
2 It is inserted into the muscle to be studied.
2 The difference in potential between the inner part of the electrode
and the outer core is amplified and displayed on an oscilloscope or
computer screen.
2 It is also displayed as an auditory signal, and experienced electromyographers as much listen to as watch the pattern of electrical activity.

Normal muscle is silent (electrically inactive) at rest (there is no spontaneous activity), although there will be a brief burst of activity when the
electrode is first inserted (the insertional activity).
The electrode can pick up electrical activity from muscle fibres within
about 0.5mm of its tip, therefore muscle fibres from several motor units
(each innervated by a different motor neurone) in this volume can contribute to the signal. However, with care, potentials from a single motor
unit may be recorded when a cooperative subject tries to exert the
muscle a little (the motor unit potential). With increasing muscular effort,
more muscle fibres are recruited, giving rise to the interference pattern.
Various nerve and muscle problems cause characteristic alterations to
these four patterns of activity
1. Insertional.
2. Spontaneous.
3. Motor unit potential.
4. Recruitment.
5. In addition, certain other patterns may be observed in certain diseases
(myotonia).
1. Insertional activity
2 Usually there is a brief burst of potentials which lasts <1.
2 Insertional activity is normal in upper motor neurone (UMN ) lesions
and most non-inflammatory myopathies.
2 It may be longer lasting in lower motor neurone (LMN ) lesions, inflammatory myopathies and acid maltase deficiency.
2 In myotonia, myotonic discharges occur (see below).
2. Spontaneous activity
2 Normal muscles at rest are silent.
2 This is also the case in UMN lesions, non-inflammatory myopathies
(unless secondary denervation has set in) and myotonia.
2 Fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves are seen in LMN lesions
and inflammatory myopathies. They occur in regular bursts of constant
amplitude (unlike activity related to voluntary contraction).
2 Fibrillation potentials are spontaneous APS in irritable, acutely denervated, muscle fibres. They are low amplitude brief negative potentials.
2 Positive sharp waves are brief positive potentials, followed by a negative wave. Typically they can be seen for 23 weeks after denervation,
but may persist.

400 3. Motor unit potentials (MUPS)
2

2

2

If the electrode is positioned quite close to the fibres of a motor unit
which is active during slight voluntary contraction, then a motor unit
potential may be recorded. In normal muscle (and in UMN lesions),
this waveform is triphasic, 510ms and has an amplitude of 0.51mV
(larger muscles have larger motor units).
In myopathies and muscular dystrophies, the motor units are smaller
and polyphasic. They tend to be briefer but in some cases last longer
than usual.
In denervated and then reinervated muscles (typically LMN lesions),
the size of individual motor units increases (as the surviving motor
neurones take over the muscle fibres previously innervated by now
absent other motor neurones). MUPs therefore are of greater amplitude and duration, and are polyphasic.

9 Neurology
In myotonia, myotonic discharges are seen.
Note: Up to 1520% of MUPs in normal muscle may be polyphasic.

2

4. Recruitment
2 Normally, as the strength of voluntary contraction increases, increasing
numbers of motor units are recruited, and these units tend to be
larger (Heinnemans size principle). The potentials due to these active
units overlap, and become difficult and finally impossible to tell apart
a full interference pattern, usually well below maximum voluntary
contraction.
2 In muscle diseases, a full interference pattern may be produced, but it
is of low amplitude. In weak muscles, there may be early recruitment
(i.e. recruitment of many motor units at low levels of voluntary contraction).
2 In denervated muscles, a full interference pattern may not be achieved,
because of the decreased number of motor units.
2 In UNM lesions, there is a lower frequency of normal MUP s.
5. Other phenomena: myotonia
High frequency repetitive discharges occurring after voluntary movement
or provoked by moving the electrode. The amplitude and the frequency
wax and wane, giving the auditory signature likened to the sound of a
Second World War dive bomber (or a motor cycle).
Note: Following the onset of a neuropathy, it may take at least 1014 days
for evidence of denervation to appear in the EMG, therefore a repeat
study after this time is often useful.
Single fibre EMG
A recording electrode with a smaller recording surface than usually used
samples a few muscle fibres from a single motor unit (supplied by a single
motor neurone). The variability (jitter) in the timing of action potentials
from different muscles should be less than 2025ms. Conduction block
during voluntary contraction may also be shown. These techniques are used
to investigate neuromuscular disorders and reinnervation in neuropathies.

EEG
The standard EEG is non-invasive. Electrodes are attached to the scalp
with collodion adhesive. Stable recordings may be made for days. Usually
they are arranged according to the international 1020 system. This is a
method for positioning electrodes over the scalp in an orderly and reproducible fashion. Additional electrodes can be applied to the scalp,
depending on the region of interest.
Standard recording conditions
Rest.
Hyperventilation for 35min, can activate generalised epileptiform
changes (and precipitate absence seizures):

401

2

2

 Can 4 frequency of focal discharge.
 Can 4 slow wave abnormalities.
Photic stimulation (a strobe light at 30cm with a frequency of
150Hz); this can produce several patterns of activity:
Photoparoxysmal response: bilateral spike or spike and wave discharges not time-locked to the visual stimulus, which may outlast the
visual stimulus by hundreds of milliseconds. Generalised, but may have
frontal or occipital predominance.
 Commonly seen in idiopathic generalised epilepsies.
High voltage occipital spikes, time-locked to the stimulus.
 Weakly associated with epilepsy.
Photomyogenic (photomyoclonic) responses: non-specific mostly
frontal spikes due to muscle activity.
 Associated with alcohol and some other drug-withdrawal states.
Sleep studies:
 Subject either stays awake the night before the recording or is
given a small dose of choral prior to the recording (sometimes
both).
 Subjects tend to show the earlier stages of non-REM sleep.
 These studies increase the yield of EEG abnormalities, including
epileptiform ones.
 By capture of natural sleep: certain seizure types are more
common in sleep (e.g. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy).
 Sleep deprivation itself increases the number of seizures and epileptiform changes.
Polysomnography (p407).

The normal EEG
There are a wide range of normal EEG phenomena. Some of the common
patterns in the awake adult are listed in the table below.
EEG abnormalities (not peri- or per-seizure)
2 A variety of EEG abnormalities may be seen outside the peri- or per2

402

2

seizure period.
Abnormalities in the EEG are not restricted to the appearance of
abnormal waveforms.
The loss, or redistribution in the scalp location, of normal background
activities is abnormal.

The classification of EEG abnormalities is complex. Below is a highly
simplified guide
1. General excess of slow waves: commonly seen in:
 Metabolic encephalopathy.
 Encephalitis.
 Post-ictal states.
2. Focal slow waves: commonly seen in:
 Large cerebral lesions (e.g. tumour, haematoma).
 Post-ictal states.
 Migraineurs.
3. Localised intermittent rhythmic slow waves: may be seen in:
 Idiopathic generalised and localisation related epilepsies.
4. Epileptiform abnormalities:

The terms alpha, beta, theta and delta are often used to describe the background activity but are also used to describe the frequency
of EEG activity.
Sharp activity may be a normal phenomenon.

403

 Spikes (if last <80ms) or sharp waves (80200ms) may be associated with slow waves.
 Consistently focal spikes suggest epilepsy with a focal seizure onset.
Note: 24% of non-epileptics have occasional spikes or sharps.
5. Repetitive stereotyped periodic complexes.
EEG patterns may show periodicity. These patterns may be epileptiform
or not, and may be focal or generalised. They are an abnormal EEG

feature, the interpretation of which depends on the clinical context.
Examples include
2 Burst suppression: bursts of generalised high voltage mixed waveforms,
alternating with generalised voltage suppression:
 Coma.
 Late stage status epilepticus (both convulsive and non-convulsive).
2 Triphasic waves over one or both temporal lobes:
 Common in herpes simplex encephalitis.
2 Periodic lateralised epileptiform discharges (PLEDS ) are localised sharp
or slow wave complexes 0.21s long, every 15s.
 Non-specific but suggest localised cerebral insult (stroke,
haematoma, tumour).
 Occasionally seen in migraine and focal epilepsies.
2 BIPLEDS are bihemispheric PLED s.
 Suggest more widespread insults, e.g. anoxia, encephalitis.
2 Bilateral or generalised high voltage complexes for 0.52s every 415s:
 Characteristic of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.
2 Triangular waves:
 Characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
 Not seen in VCJD may see a disorganised EEG without repetitive
complexes).
2 Runs of broad triphasic waves (1.53Hz).
 Severe metabolic encephalopathy (e.g. renal or hepatic failure).
2 Periodic spikes or sharp waves; bi or multiphasic morphology
(0.52Hz); usually generalisedsuggest severe encephalopathy, e.g.
 Herpes encephalitis.
 CJD (in setting of rapid dementia and myoclonus).
 Lithium intoxication.
 Post-anoxic brain injury.
 Tricyclic antidepressant overdose.

404

EEGs in epilepsy
Idiopathic (primary) generalised epilepsy (IGEs)
2 Generalised, bilaterally synchronous epileptiform discharges with virtually normal background.
2 Absence epilepsy: 3Hz spike and wave.
2 Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) : 6Hz multiple spike and wave.
Symptomatic (secondary) generalised epilepsy
2 More variable.
2 Interictal background activity: excess slow.

9 Neurology
2

Interictal epileptiform activity: irregular spikes or sharp and slow waves
1.54Hz. Usually generalised, but may show asymmetry or (multi) focal
features.

Localisation-related partial epilepsy
Interictal EEG is often normal, particularly if the focus is located deeply
(especially common with frontal foci).
2 There may be lateralised or localised spikes or sharp waves.
2

How to use the EEG
In suspected epilepsy
2 Routine EEG with photic stimulation and hyperventilation gives about
up to a 50% detection rate for interictal epileptiform abnormalities in a
subject with epilepsy (higher yield in primary generalised epilepsies
than in localisation-related epilepsies).
2 Sleep-deprived or choral-induced sleep recording: this may increase
the yield of EEG abnormalities to up to 6070%.
2 Consider 24h or longer ambulatory EEG , ideally with audio/video monitoring. Most useful in helping to determine the nature of the seizure in
a subject with frequent (e.g. daily) attacks.
In general, avoid reduction in antiepileptic drugs or drugs such as
pentylenetrazole to induce seizures, except in exceptional circumstances,
e.g. videotelemetry as part of workup for epilepsy surgery.
Note:
2 No interictal spikes does not imply no epilepsy.
2 Similarly, interictal spikes do not always imply epilepsy.
2 A negative ictal EEG does not necessarily imply a non-epileptic
(pseudo) seizure, especially in simple partial and some brief complex
partial seizures. Scalp electrodes may fail to record deep, especially
frontal, activity.
2 However, a tonic-clonic seizure with loss of consciousness should be
associated with an epileptiform EEG during the ictus. This EEG activity
may be obscured by muscle artefact, but post-ictal slowing may be
seen (see below).
2 The EEG may be slow after a tonic-clonic seizure for many tens of
minutes.
Note: The diagnosis of epilepsy is mainly clinical!
In established epilepsy
Classification (e.g. complex partial seizure (CPS) vs. absence).
Assessment of frequency of seizures (e.g. ambulatory EEG to assess
frequency of absence seizures).
2 Reduction in interictal discharges in some syndromes (e.g. absence,
photosensitive epilepsy) correlates with AED efficacy.
2
2

405

In focal cerebral dysfunction
Often not particularly helpful. Modern imaging studies usually provide
more information.
2 Small, deep or slow growing lesions often cause no effects.
2 Asymmetric voltage attenuation may be caused by a subdural
haematoma (or other fluid collection) overlying the cortex.
2 Direct grey matter involvement may cause alteration/loss of normal
EEG, or cause epileptiform discharges.
2 Subcortical white matter changes can cause localised polymorphic slow
waves.
2 Deeper subcortical lesions tend to produce more widespread slow
wave disturbances.
In CNS infections
CJD and subacute sclerosing panencephalilits (SSPE) have relatively
characteristic EEG associations.
2 Meningitis and encephalitis cases may show diffuse background disturbances and polymorphic or bilateral intermittent slow wave abnormalities.
2 Encephalitis usually causes more changes than meningitis.
2 Focal changes may be seen over abscesses and in cases of herpes
simplex encephalitis.
2

In dementia
2 To exclude some conditions such as toxic encephalopathy, non convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).
2 A few dementing conditions have characteristic EEG s (CJD , SSPE ).
2 Slowing of background frequency occurs in Alzheimers disease, but
values may overlap with those of the normal aged, therefore not very
helpful clinically.
In confusional states
Helpful in diagnosing NCSE (absence and complex partial status).
To exclude cerebral dysfunction.
Not very useful in psychiatric diagnosis per se, but an abnormal EEG in
a confusional state may help exclude psychogenic causes for an
apparent reduction in level of consciousness.

2
2
2

In toxic-metabolic encephalopathies
EEG always abnormal.
Diffuse slowing in mild cases.
Other abnormalities may develop in later stages.
Specific patterns may be seen in certain aetiologies.
406
Excess fast activity: barbiturate and benzodiazepine toxicity.
Triphasic waves: hepatic and renal failure, anoxia, hypoglycaemia,
hyperosmolality, lithium toxicity.
2 Periodic spikes or sharp waves: anoxia, renal failure, lithium and tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.
2
2
2
2
2
2

In coma
EEG, especially serial EEGs, provides an indication of degree of cerebral
dysfunction.
2 In general, any normal-looking EEG , spontaneous variability,
sleepwake changes, and reaction to external stimuli are relatively
good prognostic signs.
2

9 Neurology
2

2
2
2

An invariant, unreactive EEG is a poor prognostic sign; the pattern
however is not uniform, it may include periodic spikes of sharp waves,
episodic voltage attenuation, alpha coma, burst suppression.
May give some diagnostic clues, e.g. localised abnormalitysupratentorial mass lesion; persistent epileptiform dischargesstatus epilepticus.
Alpha coma: monotonous unresponsive alpha with anterior distribution seen after cardio/respiratory arrest is a poor prognostic feature.
Monotonous but partially reactive alpha may follow brainstem infarcts.

Invasive EEG techniques
These are generally restricted to specialist centres, most commonly used
in the pre-surgical workup of patients.
Foramen ovale electrodes, corticography (usually done by laying strips of
electrodes on the surface of the brain) and depth EEG (electrodes
implanted into the parenchyma of the brain) may be used, depending on
the region of interest. Sphenoidal electrodes are rarely used today, but
can give useful EEG information about the medial temporal structures.

Sodium amytal (Wada) test
Sodium amytal is injected into the R or L internal carotid artery. It is a
short-acting barbiturate, and temporarily causes hemispheric dysfunction
on the injected side. If injected into the left in most right-handers, the
ability to speak and continue to hold up the R arm is temporally impaired.
If speech is preserved following R-sided injection, it suggests normal leftlateralisation for language function. More complex testing may also be
undertaken during the period of hemispheric dysfunction, but it is usually
used to determine language dominance prior to certain neurosurgical procedures.
Polysomnography
2 This is the multimodal recording used in the analysis of sleep-related
disorders.
2 There is concurrent recording of EMG , EEG and EOG (electrooculographyeye movements), often with audiovisual channels. Other
physiological parameters may also be recorded, e.g. nasal air flow,
chest expansion.
Sleep is classically divided into 4 stages (14), of progressively deeper
slow wave sleep (SWS), and a fifth stage of rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep, characterised physiologically by bursts of rapid eye movements
(saccades).

There is progression through stages 1 to 4, and several episodes of REM during a typical nights
sleep. Polysomnography can be important in understanding the pathophysiology of the
insomnias, parasomnias and other sleep patterns.

Multiple sleep latency test
This is a diagnostic test for narcolepsy. Following a good nights sleep,
normal subjects typically enter REM sleep with a latency of >>10min
(usually ~90min). In narcolepsy the latency is <10min.

Sensory evoked potentials or
responses (EPs or ERs)
While many techniques and protocols have been developed in research
laboratories, there are only a few techniques in widespread clinical use. A
stimulus is delivered to the periphery, thus activating a sensory system and
evoking an electrical response over a more central, often cortical, area.
Multiple surface electrode recordings time-locked to the peripheral stimulus are recorded and averaged, to help eliminate ongoing random background noise from the sensory stimulus-evoked signal. Deviations of this
evoked potential or response (EP or ER) from the norm (especially in
latency and waveform) suggest pathology in the sensory pathway tested.
Visual EPs

408 Pattern-evoked VEP
An alternating chequerboard pattern (temporal frequency 12Hz) is presented to each eye individually. The EP is recorded over the occipital
(primary visual) cortex. Most commonly the first large positive wave,
called P1 or P100 (as it typically occurs at about 100ms), is studied.
A delayed, smaller or dispersed VEP indicates disease in the retinogeniculo-striate pathway (if severe refractive errors or cataracts have been
excluded), but most commonly affecting the optic nerve (a uniocular
deficit implies a lesion anterior to the optic chiasm) or at the chiasm.
Flash-evoked VEP
In subjects with very poor vision or fixation, and in the very young, a bright
flash may be used as the stimulus. This gives less reproducible results, particularly in the P100 latency.

9 Neurology
Common uses
The VEP is used in general to document intrinsic, inflammatory or compressive lesions of the optic nerve (or chiasm).
1. Suspected optic or retrobulbar neuritis.
2. In a patient with suspected MS, evidence of a VEP abnormality in an
asymptomatic eye would suggest a previous episode of an optic neuritis.
3. Evaluation of hysterical blindness (may need to use a strobe light stimulus if patient non-cooperative).
4. Evaluation of optic nerve function in compressive lesions such as dysthyroid eye disease, optic nerve glioma.
5. Follow up after surgery to decompress the optic nerve or chiasm.
6. Assessment of poor visual acuity in patients unable to cooperate with
usual testing. Vary the size of the chequerboard squares; subjects with
poor acuity will only have a VEP to the coarser patterns.
Somatosensory EPs
2 Stimulation site over a peripheral nerve, eg. ulnar or median at wrist,
common peroneal at knee, posterior tibial at ankle.
2 Record over Erbs point (above the medial end of the clavicle), C7 or
C2 vertebra, parietal cortex for arm stimulation; L1, C7, C2 or vertex
for leg stimulation.
2 Calculate absolute and interpeak latencies.
2 Need to show with nerve conduction studies (NCS) that distal parts of
the somatosensory pathways are conducting normally.
2 Assesses dorsal column not anterolateral (spinothalamic) tract pathways:
 E.g. stimulate median nerve at wrist, prolonged latency to Erbs
point; suggests brachial plexus (or more distal) lesion.
 Prolonged Erbs point to C2 latency suggests spinal cord lesion.
Uses
2 Diagnosis of plexopathies.
2 Evaluation of subclinical myelopathy in possible MS .
2 Evaluation of hysterical sensory loss.
2 Per-operative monitoring (e.g. during scoliosis surgery).
Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs, BAERs, BSAEPs)
Stimulus: rarefaction clicks of 50 or 100ms duration, presented
monoaurally at 10Hz at 6070DB above threshold (masking noise to
other ear).
2 Record over mastoid and vertex of skull.
2 Classic waveform has seven peaks, said to be generated by sequential
auditory nuclei:

VII

VIIIth nerve (must be present to interpret subsequent waves)
Cochlear nucleus (may be absent in normals)
Superior olive
Lateral lemniscus (may be absent in normals)
Interior colliculus (should be 50% or more of wave Is amplitude)
Medial geniculate (too variable for regular clinical use)
Auditory thalamocortical radiation (too variable for regular clinical
use)

409

Latency I to V (central conduction time) should be no more than 4.75ms.
The difference between left and right central conduction times should be
<0.4ms.
Uses
2 Hearing assessment, especially in children.
2 Evaluation in suspected MS and other myelinopathies (e.g.
adrenoleukodystrophy; MRI more important now).
2 Evaluation and detection of posterior fossa lesions (eg. acoustic neuromas; MRI more important now).
2 Evaluation of brainstem function (e.g. tumour, CVA s).
2 Evaluation of brainstem function in coma and brain death.
2 Per-operative, e.g. acoustic neuroma excision.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
2
2
2
2

Brief, high-current pulse produced in a circular or figure-of-eightshaped coil held over the scalp.
This induces a magnetic field with flux perpendicular to the coil.
This in turn produces an electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field.
The result is excitation or inhibition of the subjacent cortex
(depending on stimulus parameters).

Measurement of central motor conduction time
TMS over the motor cortex indirectly (presumably via synaptic activation of corticospinal neurones) causes a volley of activity in the corticospinal tracts. The latency of the EMG in, say, the abductor digiti
minimi may be measured.
2 May be used in cervical myelopathy and MS to show increased latency
of EMG in hand muscles evoked by TMS over the motor cortex. If the
EMG latency to more distal stimulation (e.g. at C7 over the spinal cord
and in the ulnar nerve) is normal, then an increased central motor conduction time may be inferred.
2 Latency may also be increased in other neurogenerative conditions.
2

Psychogenic limb weakness
Some authorities have used TMS to evoke muscle activity in paralysed
limbs in patients with psychogenic paralysis. This needs to be done in the
context of an holistic approach to the patient, aimed at dealing with any
psychological pathology.
Potential clinical applications
There have been many TMS studies; some that may prove useful as clinical
tests, e.g.
2 Determination of lateralisation of language function by repetitive TMS
(rTMS) prior to surgery for epilepsy.
2 Assessment of cortical excitability in certain epilepsy syndromes.
2 Assessment of decreased intracortical inhibition in dystonia.

Urodynamics
Flowmetry
2 Measurement of rate and amount of urine flow over time.
2 Allows calculation of parameters such as time to maximal flow,
maximum and mean flow rate, volume voided.
2 Post-micturition ultrasound can determine residual volume.
Cystometry (needs urinary catheterisation)
2 Measurement of intravesicular pressure during filling (usually at
50mL/min) or emptying. Typically bladder filling sensation starts at
about 100mL, and the bladder is full at 400600 mL (with no more
than a 15cm of water rise in pressure). Detrusor instability may cause
sharp rises in the pressure during filling.
2 During voiding, flow rate should be >15mL/min (9) or >20mL/min (3)
with pressures of <50cmH2O (9) or 30 cmH2O (3).

Edrophonium (Tensilon) test
Procedure
2 Explain the test to patient.
2 Select weak and/or fatiguable muscles to be assessed.
2 Attach ECG monitor.
2 Draw up 0.6mg atropine (for use if extreme bradycardia develops),
10mg of edrophonium in 5mL normal saline (A), 5mL normal saline (B)
and, saline flush.
2 Administer 1mL of test solution (A or B, ideally patient and administrating physician should be blinded to the nature of the solution).
2 If no adverse reaction, administer remaining 4mL.
2 Repeat with other solution (B or A).
Note: If the diagnosis of MG is clinically obvious, and the patient has
responded to pyridostigmine given empirically, there is little point in stopping this and performing an edrophonium test.
Interpretation
2 In myasthenia gravis, there should be a response within 3060s, which
should wear off in 24min.
2 There may be a response in LEMS , polymyositis and motor neurone
disease (MND).

Multi-system disorders
PNS and CNS are affected in many multi-system disorders; markers in
blood and other fluids and tissues for these are therefore commonly
requested in neurology patients.

also request 24h urinary copper excretion. Note: Slit lamp examination

Paraneoplastic antibodies
Certain neurological syndromes are paraneoplastic, i.e. due to remote
but non-metastatic effects of non-nervous system cancers. These paraneoplastic syndromes are rare, but important to recognise. In perhaps
50% of cases, the neurological symptoms may predate those of the cancer.

Genetic tests
The list of diseases for which we have specific genetic tests grows each
month. Individual single gene neurological diseases are rare, but there are
a lot of them, so about 0.1% of the population has one!
When might a neurologist refer to a clinical geneticist?
2 Genetic counselling of an index patient and his family.
2 Cytogenetic or molecular diagnosis.

2 Confirming a clinical diagnosis.
2 Identify carriers in the family.
What is done?
An ever-increasing range of diseases may be tested for. Some of these
tests may be routinely available at your local clinical genetics lab; others at
regional, national or even supranational centres. Other tests may be available on a research basis. It is clear, however, that tests for genetic
lesions or risk factors will become increasingly available. Rather than give
an, at best, partial list of readily available tests, we give a few examples
below of the kinds of tests that are available. The astute reader will spot
that different mutations within a given gene can give rise to different clinical phenotypes. Indeed, recent work has shown that the same mutation in
some genes can give rise to more than one phenotype: we clearly have a
418 great deal yet to learn about the genetics of neurological diseases!
Detection of deletions
2 E.g. in mitochondrial (mt)DNA in MELAS and MERFF .
2 E.g. of dystrophin gene in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies.
Detection of DNA rearrangement
2 E.g. PMP22 gene duplication in some case of Charcot Marie Tooth
disease type 1 (or hereditary motor-sensory neuropathy type 1,
(HMSN1); deletions within this gene cause hereditary neuropathy with
liability to pressure palsies (HNPP).
Detection of trinucleotide repeats

9 Neurology

2

So far, there in no overlap in the number of repeats in controls and
affected patients (except rarely in Huntingdons, in the region of 33 to
36 repeats).
Anticipation (more severe phenotype and earlier onset) often reflects
in increased number of repeats in the most recent generations (especially myotonic dystrophy).

familial hemiplegic migraine.

A variety of more time-consuming methods may be needed to
look at, for example, single base mutations
These involve fragmenting the DNA of the gene into manageable pieces,
then amplifying these so that there are multiple copies. Subsequently,
various methods may be used to detect fragments with abnormal
sequences, even if only differing at a single base from wild type. There are 419
several such techniques, constantly being refined, and many are restricted
to research laboratories.
2 However, molecular genetics is proceeding at a tremendous pace, both
in terms of the number of conditions with identified genetic lesions,
and the laboratory techniques for analysis.
2 High speed DNA sequencing will facilitate sequencing large pieces of
DNA.
2 Progress is being made on the analysis of polygenic diseases.
2 E.g. point mutations in the MPZ gene, which encodes for P0 , a component of the myelin sheath, have been found in some families with
Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1B.

Genetic risk factors
Another area of clinical genetics which is likely to become more important
is the detection of genetic risk factors for diseases. Certain allelic variants,
whilst not causing a disease in the traditional sense, may predispose an
individual to exhibiting a certain clinical phenotype, or alter the age at
which it might become apparent.
2 E.g. there are three allelic variants in the apolipoprotein E (APOE4 )
gene, e2, e3, e4. Homozygosity for e4 is likely to be a risk factor for
developing Alzheimers disease, and for developing it at an earlier age.
However, the majority of e4 homozygotes do not develop the condition (therefore it is not causative).
Detection of the presence of abnormal protein or altered levels
of normal protein
Immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting (western blots) on tissue
samples from the patient allow direct visualisation of the presence of
abnormal protein, or absence or reduced levels of normal protein, in a
variety of conditions. (These techniques are not genetic in the strictest
sense, but are often useful in genetic conditions.)
2 E.g. Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies have absent or
reduced levels of dystrophin in muscle biopsy samples.

catalogue of genetic diseases in man, giving data about the genotype,
mode of inheritance and the clinical phenotype of thousands of disorders

Biochemical tests
Some basic principles
Many autosomal recessive and X-linked metabolic diseases are caused by
reduced or absent activity of a specific enzyme, in turn due to a single gene
defect. In some there is a tissue-specific deficit:

420

2

E.g. McArdles (glycogen storage disease V): demonstrates absence of
phosphorylase activity in muscle biopsy (as only the myophosphorylase
isozyme is affected).

In other conditions, notably the lipidoses, the enzyme is deficient in many
tissues:
2

E.g. in Niemann-Pick diseases A and B, sphingomyelinase is deficient
in brain and spinal cord, but also in the gastrointestinal tract, liver,
spleen and bone marrow. Abnormal lipid metabolism can therefore
be demonstrated in relatively easily accessible tissue such as
fibroblasts.

9 Neurology
Not only may the absence or lower activity of an enzyme reduce the
amount of the product of the reaction it catalyses, it may lead to the accumulation of precursors in the metabolic pathway:
A (1)7 B (2)7 C(3)7 D
If enzyme (3) is reduced, A, B and C may accumulate, with lower levels of
D than usual being produced:
2 E.g. in acute intermittent porphyria, there is increased urinary excretion of  haemaminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen (intermediates
in the heme synthetic pathway) during an acute attack.
2 Decreased levels of porphobilinogen deaminase may be demonstrated
in erythrocytes, leucocytes and cultured fibroblasts.
Ischaemic forearm exercise test (ischaemic lactate test)
Procedure
1. Rest patient supine for 30min.
2. Draw a baseline lactate sample from a catheter in an antecubital vein.
3. Inflate sphygmomanometer cuff on that arm to above arterial pressure.
4. Subject squeezes a rubber ball in that hand until exhaustion.
5. Rapidly deflate cuff.
6. Take further venous samples at 30, 60 and 240s.
Results
Normally the venous lactate will rise by 2, 3 or even 4-fold; if it fails to rise
by 1.5-fold, then there is likely to be a glycogenolysis or glycolysis defect
(or the patient has not exercised sufficiently!):
2 E.g. in disorders of glycolysis and glycogenolysis the venous lactate fails
to rise in the ischaemic forearm exercise test.

Neuro-otology
Pure tone audiometry
Measure threshold for air and bone conduction at frequencies from 250 421
to 8000Hz.
Typical patterns
2 Conduction deafness BC > AC at all frequencies.
2 Sensorineural deafness AC = BC at all frequencies, but increasing deafness as frequency rises.
(AC = air conduction; BC = bone conduction)
More specialised tests
2 Tone decay.
2 Loudness discomfort.
2 Speech audiometry.
2 Acoustic impedance.

Caloric testing
Procedure
1. Inspect eardrum; if intact, proceed.
2. Place patient supine with neck flexed 30 (on pillow).
3. Irrigate external auditory meatus with 30C water (ice water if testing
for brain death).
4. Observe for (or record*) nystagmus.
5. Repeat after 5min with 44C water.
What should happen
1. Cold water induces convection of fluid in ipsilateral lateral semicircular
canal (LSCC).
2. There is less output from ipsilateral LSCC.
3. Imbalance of signals from the two LSCCs results in eye drift towards
the irrigated ear.
4. Fast phase contraversive movements correct for eye drift (hence nystamus with fast phase away from irrigated ear).
5. This nystagmus starts in about 20s and persists for 1min.
6. Warm water reverses the nystagmus.
Common pathological responses
Canal paresis
1. Reduced duration of nystagmus following irrigation on one side (with
cold or warm water).
2. Suggests ipsilateral peripheral or central lesion.
Directional preponderance
1. Prolonged nystagmus in one direction.
2. Suggests central lesion on side of preponderence or contralateral
peripheral lesion.
Combination of clinical examination, audiometry and caloric testing of the
vestibulo-ocular reflex will help localise a lesion (peripheral vs. central; L
vs. R).
Brainstem auditory evoked responses

*There are various techniques for recording eye movements. Although quite crude, electronystography has the advantage that it requires no instrumentation of the eyeball directly, allows
recordings in the dark or with closed eyes (thus abolishing visual fixation and other responses that
can interfere with the vestibulo-ocular reflex) and is relatively cheap.

Estimation of renal function
Serum creatinine
Creatinine is the non-enzymatic breakdown product of creatine and phosphocreatine (almost exclusively found in skeletal muscle). Daily production is constant in an individual. It is excreted mainly by filtration at the
glomerulus, but is also secreted to a certain extent (up to 15%) by the
tubules. Because of the secretory component, serum creatinine overestimates GFR, particularly at low GFR. Because of the reciprocal relationship
between clearance and serum creatinine, serum creatinine does not rise
outside the normal range until there has been a substantial fall in GFR, particularly in patients with low muscle mass (Fig. 10.1). However, in an individual patient, a progressive increase in serum creatinine over time, even
within the normal range, implies declining GFR. Wide variation between
individuals based on muscle mass, sex and age make serum creatinine an
imperfect screening test for renal failure.
Drugs, e.g. cimetidine, trimethoprim and pyrimethamine, can block the
secretory component. Ingestion of cooked meat and severe exercise
causes a rapid, temporary rise in serum creatinine.
A variety of formulae have been devised to incorporate age, sex and
weight differences to improve the ability of serum creatinine to predict
GFR.
The most popular formula is that of Cockcroft and Gault:
GFR = [140age (y)]  weight (kg)/serum creatinine (mol/L)]  1.23 (9)
GFR = [140age (y)]  weight (kg)/serum creatinine (mol/L)]  1.04 (3)

424

Serum urea
Urea is synthesised predominantly in the liver (by-product of protein
catabolism). Production is increased by high protein intake, catabolic
states, breakdown of blood in the gut lumen in GI bleeding and tetracycline, and may 5 in liver disease. Urea is freely filtered at the glomerulus
with variable reabsorption, which is influenced by extracellular volume
status. Intravascular volume depletion, diuretics, CCF, GI bleeding,
tetracyclines and renal failure cause elevated levels. Disproportionate rise
in serum urea compared to creatinine occurs in hypovolaemia and GI
bleeding. Reduced levels are seen in chronic liver disease and alcohol
abuse.
24h creatinine clearance
The patient is instructed to completely empty their bladder soon after
awakening in the morning, discard the urine and subsequently start the
clock on the 24h collection period. During this time all urine voided is collected in the container provided. At the end of 24h the patient empties
the bladder one last time, and the urine is saved. The time of the final
urine specimen should vary by no more than 10min of the time of starting
the collection the previous morning. The container is handed in and a
blood sample to estimate serum creatinine is taken. In some centres the
result obtained is normalised to the persons body surface area if the
height and weight are known and is expressed as mL/min per 1.73m2.

GfR
Fig. 10.1 Creatinine production is dependent on muscle mass which varies widely. Graph illustrates the theoretical relationship between GFR and plasma creatinine, ignoring effects of tubular
secretion of creatinine, which results in overestimation of GFR from plasma creatinine or measurement of creatinine clearance. Note that in a patient with low muscle mass, serum creatinine
does not rise outside the normal range until the GFR has fallen <30mL/min, whereas a patient
with higher muscle mass will reach the same level of creatinine at a GFR of 90mL/min.

425

The creatinine clearance is calculated as follows
Urine flow rate (mL/min)=
Urine volume (mL)/time of collection (min)
Creatinine clearance =
{Urine creatinine [mmol/L]/[plasma creatinine [mmol/L]}  urine flow rate [mL/min]

Since creatinine is excreted predominantly by filtration at the glomerulus,
and partly due to secretion by the tubules, the above formula overestimates GFR. The secretory component can be completely blocked by
cimetidine (400mg qds starting the night before commencing urine collection and continued till completion) to produce values closer to the true
GFR.
The most common source of error is an incomplete collection of urine or
incomplete bladder emptying. In spite of its inadequacies, creatinine clearance based on 24h urine collections and cimetidine-enhanced clearance
studies are cheap, easily repeatable, and widely available and can be done
in an outpatient setting. It will not replace more accurate estimates of
GFR, but precise measurements are rarely needed in clinical practice.
Cystatin C
Cystatin C, a 13kDa protein of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors, is produced by all nucleated cells at a relatively constant
rate. It can be assayed using efficient, enzyme-linked immunoassays.
Preliminary studies suggest serum cystatin C may be a more sensitive and
specific marker than creatinine for assessing impaired excretory renal
function. Minor reductions in GFR cause cystatin C levels to rise above
normal when serum creatinine is still within normal range.
Measurement of glomerular filtration rate
Indications
2 When accurate measurement of renal function is needed, as in clinical
research, to calculate dose of chemotherapy agents which have renal
excretion and in patients with abnormal muscle mass, e.g. paraplegics
with bilateral lower limb muscle wasting.
2 The gold standard for measurement of GFR is measurement of inulin
clearance: inulin is freely filtered, not protein bound, and not reabsorbed or secreted. However, measurement of inulin is difficult.
426
Radionuclide studies
Radionuclide studies are contraindicated during pregnancy and women of
childbearing age need to have a negative pregnancy test before proceeding
with the test.
A variety of radioisotope markers are available for estimating GFR. An
ideal marker should be safe, not extensively protein bound, be freely filtered but not secreted or reabsorbed by the tubule and should be
excreted only by the kidney. Inulin is the gold standard as it satisfies all the
above requirements. However since its administration and measurement
is cumbersome it is available only as a research tool.

The commonly used markers are 51Cr EDTA, 99mTc DTPA and 125I
iothalamate. Iothalamate is also available without radiolabelling and can
be measured by fluorimetry.
These substances are injected intravenously (SC in 125I iothalamate)
and after allowing for equilibration, plasma levels are measured at predetermined intervals. Plasma clearance and hence renal elimination is
calculated from the rate of fall of the substance from circulation.
51Cr EDTA has been the most extensively studied marker and is widely
available. Extensively used in Europe as a single injection technique followed by plasma sampling at 0, 90, 120, 150 and 240min.51Cr EDTA is
reliable even at low levels of renal function. Studies in humans suggest
renal clearance estimated by this method is ~10% lower than that of
inulin.
125I iothalamate is only slightly protein bound and studies suggest
clearance values similar to that of inulin. Unlike other markers it can
also be administered SC, and this allows for slow equilibration with

stable plasma concentrations. It is considered safe, but potential
problems of thyroid uptake necessitate pre-treatment with oral
iodine.
99mTc DTPA is also widely available. There is some evidence that renal
clearance can be estimated with a gamma camera placed over the
patient, without the need for plasma sampling. Also anatomical correlation to renal function, like information on relative contribution from
each kidney, can be obtained. 99mTc has a very short half-life, and radiation exposure is minimized. Protein binding can result in diminished
renal clearance.

Assessment of proteinuria
Proteinuria may result from 4 glomerular permeability or tubular disease,
causing 5 reabsorption of filtered protein or 4 excretion of tubular enzymes.
Severity of proteinuria is best measured by absolute protein excretion over
24h, rather than protein concentration (influenced by urine dilution). Although
dipstick tests are useful, they can be misleading, with false +ve (concentrated
urine) and false ve (dilute urine) results.
Indications for quantitation of proteinuria
Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome
Nephrotic syndrome is defined as triad of oedema, hypoalbuminaemia and
proteinuria >3g/24h. In a patient with oedema and hypoalbuminaemia it is
worthwhile obtaining a 24h urine protein, to confirm that these are indeed
due to renal disease. It is worthwhile measuring creatinine clearance on same
sample, and measurement of 24h urinary Na+ excretion may also help in planning management.
Prognosis of progressive renal disease
Proteinuria is one of the most potent risk markers for progressive loss of renal
function in renal disease, e.g. diabetic nephropathy, chronic glomerulonephritis
and reflux nephropathy. In addition, treatments that reduce proteinuria (e.g.
antihypertensive drugs, particularly ACE inhibitors) 5 rate of progression.
Because reduction of proteinuria is an important therapeutic aim, regular
assessment of the severity of proteinuria is important in monitoring the effects
of treatment.
Diagnosis of early diabetic nephropathy
Diabetic nephropathy is most treatable in its early stagescharacterised by an
428 4 in GFR, 4 albumin excretion, and then by hypertension. Microalbuminuria is
the term for pathologically increased albumin excretion below the limit of
detection of standard tests for proteinuria.
Quantitation of proteinuria
Gold standard is 24h urine collection for measurement of total protein or
albumin. Protein measurement is cheap but does not differentiate between the
various proteins present in urine. Proteinuria >300mg/24h is usually defined as
pathological, but patients with early diabetic nephropathy have total protein
excretions below this limit. Only when proteinuria >1g/24h is there a high suspicion of underlying renal disease. Albumin measurement is more expensive
but justified when the detection of microalbuminuria would alter managementeither in the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy or in the early detection of other forms of glomerular disease. An alternative is to measure the

10 Renal medicine
urine protein: creatinine ratio or albumin:creatinine ratio on a spot urine
sampleideally an early morning urine sample (because protein excretion 4
with activitysee below). Because creatinine is produced at a fairly constant
rate throughout the day and night, its concentration depends purely on daily
production rate and on urine dilution.
Assuming an average creatinine production of 10mmol/day (ignoring interindividual variation due to variation in muscle mass), a protein : creatinine
ratio of n mg/mmol allows estimation of the daily protein excretion as 10  n
mg/24h.
Diagnosis of postural proteinuria
Protein excretion 4 with activity and upright posture. In some individuals
increase is exaggerated, resulting in +ve dipstick tests for proteinuria and
even 4 24h urine protein excretion. This postural proteinuria has a nearly
completely benign prognosis. In patients with proteinuria who have no other
evidence of renal disease it is worth quantitating proteinuria separately in
urine collected while the patient has been recumbent overnight and in a
daytime specimen. This can either be done by measuring protein : creatinine
(or albumin : creatinine ratio for even greater accuracy) on both an early
morning urine and one taken after period of activity, or a 24h urine divided
into night-time and daytime aliquots. Normal protein excretion during the
night with increased protein excretion during the day indicates postural proteinuria.
Assessment of tubular proteinuria
Occasionally of value to detect the relatively low grade proteinuria that results
from tubular disease, e.g. Dents disease (rare genetic disorder caused by
mutation in a tubular chloride channel), which causes calcium stone formation
and tubular proteinuria. Other examples include screening for generalised
tubular dysfunction and for drug toxicity, e.g during treatment with platinum
derivatives. Tubular proteinuria is best diagnosed by measurement of specific
proteins whose presence in the urine result from tubular disease, e.g. retinol
binding protein (RBP), N-acetyl--D-glucosaminidase (NAG) or 1-microglobulin, either in 24h urine specimens or as ratios between the protein concentration and creatinine concentration.
Assessment of selectivity of proteinuria
The more severe the damage to glomerular permeability, the larger the
protein molecules which pass through the glomerulus in glomerular disease. 429
Measurement of the ratio of clearance of transferrin or albumin (a small molecule) to immunoglobulin G (a large molecule) can therefore be used as a
measure of selectivity, and is calculated as follows:
Albumin/IgG clearance = {(urine [IgG]  serum [albumin])/(serum IgG
 urine [albumin])}  100%
Transferrin/IgG clearance is calculated similarly.
A ratio of <0.16 indicates highly selective proteinuria.

In children, minimal change nephropathy causes selective proteinuria, whereas
non-selective proteinuria raises the possibility of an alternative type of renal
disease and might led to a recommendation of renal biopsy to avoid steroid
treatment when this would be unlikely to be of benefit. Measurement of selectivity in adults is of very limited use.
Detection and quantitation of urinary light chains (Bence Jones protein)
Measurement of urinary light chains requires specific immunoassays for light
chains and is performed on 24h urine samples as part of the regular assessment of disease activity in multiple myeloma. These tests are probably a less
reliable marker of disease activity in the presence of renal impairment.

Assessment of renal
tubular function
There are two main types of renal tubular diseases: those due to a single
defect, usually genetic, in solute secretion or reabsorption, and those due
to generalised tubular damage.
Screening tests for generalised tubular dysfunction test for
2 Renal glycosuria (dipstick or lab test for glucose in urine plus normal
plasma glucose).
2 Hypophosphataemia (can be followed by estimation of phosphate
reabsorption, see below).
2 Low molecular weight proteinuria (due to failure of tubular reabsorption plus increased release of proteins derived from tubular cells).
2 Normal anion gap metabolic acidosisserum bicarbonate, plus sodium
potassium and chloride to permit calculation of the anion gap (followed by tests to confirm renal tubular acidosis, see below).
2 Aminoaciduriadetected by amino acid electrophoresis on a random
urine sample.
2 Hypouricaemiaplasma urate may be low due to decreased tubular
reabsorption. (This can be followed by measurement of fractional
urate excretion, see below.)
Assessment of phosphate reabsorption
Occasionally useful in the differential diagnosis of hypophosphataemia, e.g.
in confirming the diagnosis of X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets.
Procedure
2 The patient is asked to fast overnight.
430 2 The overnight urine is discarded.
2 The next urine sample is obtained, together with a blood sample.
2 Both are analysed for phosphate and creatinine.
Fractional phosphate excretion is calculated as:
FEPO4 = CP/CCr = [serum creatinine  urine phosphate]/[urine creatinine
 serum phosphate]
this is the fraction of filtered phosphate which appears in the urine

Fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) is calculated as
1FEPO4

10 Renal medicine
TmP/GFR, the tubular maximum for phosphate reabsorption can be read
off a nomogram1, or can be calculated as follows:

If TRP<0.86, TmP/GFR = TRP  plasma phosphate
If TRP>0.86, TmP/GFR = {0.3 x TRP/[1  (0.8 x TRP)]}  plasma phosphate
Interpretation
The adult reference range for TmP/GFR is 0.801.35mmol/L. Higher
values of normal are seen in infancy and childhood2. Low values are seen
in X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets and in osteogenic osteomalacia,
both of which are thought to be due to overproduction or failure of inactivation of an as yet unidentified phosphaturic hormone, phosphatonin.
TmP/GFR is raised in hypoparathyroidism and reduced in hyperparathyroidism and by PTH-related peptide secretion.
Reduced phosphate reabsorption may also be seen in hypercalciuric stone
formers, but it remains difficult to be certain whether this is the primary
disorder, causing increased production of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D, or secondary to tubular damage as a result of renal stones.
Reduced phosphate reabsorption is also seen in a number of primary and
secondary disorders of renal tubular function.
Assessment of tubular urate handling
The relative contributions of production rate, glomerular filtration, presecretory reabsorption, secretion and post-secretory reabsorption to
control of plasma urate concentration cannot be dissected out without
complex tests involving selective pharmacological blockade of some of
these processes. However, it is possible to determine whether an
abnormal plasma urate concentration is due to abnormal production or
abnormal renal handling.
24h urinary urate production is increased in overproduction but normal
in patients whose hyperuricaemia is due to decreased excretion. (Note:
it is not decreased, because in underexcretion the steady state is
maintained at the expense of a raised plasma level.) If 24h urinary urate
is raised, the collection should be repeated on a low purine diet.
Fractional excretion of urate is calculated as:
{(urinary [urate]  plasma [creatinine])/(plasma [urate] 
[creatinine])}  100%

urinary

Normal values are dependent on age and sex but in adults are of the
order of 10%. High fractional excretion is a cause of hypouricaemia in
SIADH and several other conditions; low fractional excretion occurs in
primary gout but also in a familial syndrome of hypouricaemia with
early- onset gout and progressive renal failure.

Assessment of acid-base balance
Plasma HCO3 and Cl are the two major anions in extracellular fluid. The
major reason for measuring them is to assess acid-base status. Changes in
serum [HCO3] concentration reflect changes in acid-base balance, with a
5 in [HCO3] reflecting metabolic acidosis and an 4 reflecting alkalosis.
Plasma Cl is helpful in assessing the cause of acidosis or alkalosis.
iThere is no justification at all for performing an arterial puncture to
measure arterial pH as part of the assessment of metabolic acidosis or
alkalosisit can be adequately assessed from serum [HCO3]. Arterial
samples are needed when it is unclear whether the acid-base disturbance
is respiratory or metabolic in origin, or in mixed disturbances.
Plasma bicarbonate
The most reliable way to interpret plasma HCO3 is to use the acid-base
diagram (Fig. 10.4), which allows assessment of how much the change in
[HCO3] concentration is due to changes in CO2 excretion via the lungs
and how much to changes in [H+] or HCO3 wasting. In the absence of
significant respiratory disease it can often safely be assumed that any
change is due to metabolic causes, in which case low plasma HCO3 indicates increased H+ production (or, occasionally, increased HCO3 loss)
and vice versa. If arterial blood gases are obtained, the standard bicarbonate is a calculated value which indicates what the plasma HCO3
would be if CO2 excretion were normal, and is thus a way of allowing
assessment of whether there is a metabolic component to an abnormal
HCO3 concentration or whether it is solely due to the respiratory disturbance.
Remember that the kidneys compensate for respiratory disease and the
lungs for metabolic disease: for instance, metabolic acidosis causes hyperventilation, resulting in lower PCO2 and lessening the acidosis seen.
However, overcompensation does not occur.
Plasma chloride
Many laboratories omit plasma Cl assays from routine serum chemistry
measurements, but this measurement is helpful if a systemic acid-base
432 disturbance is suspected. As a useful oversimplification, low bicarbonate
with high chloride can be seen as accumulation of hydrochloric acid, which
can only result from altered renal handling of acid, as in renal tubular acidosis. If HCO3 is low with a normal or low Cl, some other acid must be
accumulating. More precision in deciding the cause of metabolic acidosis
can be obtained by calculating the anion gap.
The anion gap
The anion gap is the difference between the sum of the concentrations of
the positively charged ions routinely measured in plasma and the negatively charged ions:

10 Renal medicine
Anion gap = {[Na+] + [K+]}  {[Cl] + [HCO3]}
Obviously, the total positive charges in plasma must be balanced by the
same number of negative charges. The normal anion gap is caused by the
fact that there are more unmeasured anions in plasma (mostly albumin,
but including lactate, sulphate and others) than cations (including calcium
and magnesium). The concentrations of all of these ummeasured ions can
vary, so the normal range for the anion gap is wide; hypoalbuminaemia, for
instance, reduces the anion gap by 2.5mEq per 1g/dL fall in serum albumin.
The main use of calculation of the anion gap is in the differential diagnosis
of metabolic acidosis.
A high anion gap acidosis is caused by an abnormally high concentration
of an unmeasured anion, such as
2 L-lactate (reflecting anaerobic metabolism or hepatic dysfunction).
2 Salicylate (in aspirin poisoning).
2 -hydroxybutyrate (in diabetic ketoacidosis).
2 Glycolate and oxalate (in methanol poisoning).
2 Hippurate (in toluene poisoning, e.g. glue-sniffing).
2 D-lactate (from gut bacterial fermentation in blind-loop syndrome).
A normal anion gap acidosis may be caused by loss of bicarbonate or
failure of renal H+ excretion, for instance
2 Renal tubular acidosis.
2 High ileostomy losses (bicarbonate wasting).
2 Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
2 Urinary diversions, e.g. ureterosigmoidostomy (Cl/HCO3 exchange
and NH4+ reabsorption in the colonic segment).
Beware: in North America the anion gap is usually calculated as [Na+] 
{[Cl] + [HCO3]}, not including [K+] in the measured cations. This results
in a lower reference range for the anion gap. In addition, different laboratories use different assays for chloride. For these reasons, the local laboratory reference range for anion gap should be used.
In general, the anion gap is only useful when very high, confirming high
concentrations of an unmeasured anion. If the diagnosis is not already
obvious, this then justifies further investigation, including assay of plasma 433
lactate concentration.

Assessment of urinary acidification
Indications
Unexplained hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis.
Defects in the kidneys ability to excrete acid in the urine may lead to permanent systemic acidosis, or to systemic acidosis at times of increased

acid generation, depending on the severity of the defect. Acidification
defects may occur as part of generalised tubular disease or as isolated,
often genetically determined, alterations in function, most commonly of
cell surface ion pumps.
Ammonium chloride loading test
This test is regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of distal (type
1) renal tubular acidosis, where there is impaired excretion of fixed acid
into the distal tubule.
Procedure
2 The patient attends after an overnight fast, but is allowed to drink
water.
2 At the start of the test, a urine sample is sent to the laboratory for
measurement of pH and a plasma or serum sample is sent for measurement of bicarbonate. Because pH changes rapidly in urine exposed
to the air, the urine container should be filled to the top or the urine
sent in a stoppered syringe, and sent to the laboratory without any
delay.
2 If the urine pH is <5.4, this indicates normal acidifying ability, and there
is no need to continue with the test.
2 If the venous blood bicarbonate is low, with a urine pH >5.4, the diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis is confirmed.
2 If neither of these conditions is met, then proceed to give the patient
ammonium chloride, 0.1g/kg body weight, PO. Ammonium chloride is

given as capsules, is unpalatable, and frequently causes nausea and
vomiting, but this can be reduced if the capsules are taken slowly, or
with bread and honey. It is worth proceeding with the test even if the
patient vomits, as acidosis is often achieved; no more ammonium chloride should be given.
Urine samples are then collected hourly for the next 68h and sent,
protected from the air (as above), for pH analysis in the laboratory. If
any sample has a pH of 5.4 the test can be stopped, as this indicates
normal acidifying ability of the distal tubule.
At 3h after ingestion of ammonium chloride, a venous sample should
be sent for plasma bicarbonate measurement to ensure that acidaemia
has occurred.

Alternative tests of distal acidification
Rationale: the distal tubule reabsorbs sodium ions in exchange for
hydrogen ions. Frusemide, by increasing delivery of sodium to the distal
tubule, therefore causes a fall in urine pH. A fall in urine pH to <5.5
after frusemide confirms normal distal acidification ability, and may
spare the patient the unpleasantness of the ammonium chloride test.
The sensitivity of the test is increased in salt-avid states produced by
sodium restriction or fludrocortisone.
2 The patient attends after a light breakfast without caffeine.
2 Fludrocortisone 1mg is given, followed by frusemide 40mg an hour
later.
2 Drinking is discouraged unless the patient is very thirsty (very dilute
urine can invalidate the test).
2 Urine samples are collected for laboratory analysis of pH hourly, if
possible, for 45h. A fall in urine pH to <5.5 excludes a distal acidification defect.
Bicarbonate infusion test
This is the gold standard for the diagnosis of proximal (type 2) renal
tubular acidosis, which is characterised by impaired bicarbonate reabsorption. In this condition, urine pH may be <5.5 in untreated patients,
because at steady state serum bicarbonate levels fall to the point at which
filtered bicarbonate is reabsorbed, and distal acidification mechanisms are
intact.
Procedure
2 Sodium bicarbonate is infused IV at 0.51.0mmol/kg per hour. After
60min plasma bicarbonate is measured to confirm that this has risen to
>20mmol/L. Urine pH is measured hourly and urine bicarbonate measured, to allow calculation of the fractional excretion of bicarbonate:
FEHCO3 = {(urine [HCO3]  plasma [creatinine])/(plasma [HCO3] 

urine [creatinine])}  100%

2
2

Fractional excretion of bicarbonate is normally <15%.
A level of >20% confirms type 2 renal tubular acidosis.

435

Plasma potassium
Although most of the bodys potassium is intracellular, small changes in
extracellular potassium concentration can have major changes in membrane excitability. Hypokalaemia causes increased excitability, causing
atrial and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias; hyperkalaemia decreases
excitability, causing a characteristic pattern of ECG changes and eventually
causing asystole. Both hypokalaemia and hyperkalaemia can also be associated with skeletal muscle paralysis.
Plasma K+ concentration is influenced both by distribution across cell
membranes and by the balance between intake and excretion. Renal
excretion is dependent on renal function, urine flow rate and aldosterone.
Pseudohyperkalaemia
Caused by excessive release of K+ from cells after venepuncture, and
should be considered when hyperkalaemia doesnt fit with the clinical
picture. The laboratory should report the presence of visible haemolysis
(usually due to RBC trauma during difficult venepuncture), but pseudohyperkalaemia can also occur in the absence of visible haemolysis, as in:
2 Haematological malignancies causing a high white cell or platelet count.
2 Other causes of leucocytosis and thrombocytosis, e.g. leukaemoid
reactions, rheumatoid arthritis.
2 Familial pseudohyperkalaemia: rare disorder of RBC cation transport
leading to an increased rate of release of K+ from red cells at low temperatures.
Diagnosis can be confirmed by showing that plasma [K+] is normal in a
heparinised sample analysed immediately, and then by demonstrating that
delayed separation results in higher values being obtained.
Pseudohyperkalaemia with a normal WBC and platelet count can be
further investigated by measuring the rate of rise of plasma [K+] in samples
incubated at 37C and at 22C, and studying the effects of drugs that
affect cation exchange, e.g. thiazide diuretics and quinine. Artefactual
hyperkalaemia can be caused by fist clenching plus a venous tourniquet
during phlebotomy: plasma K+ can rise by as much as 2mmol/L.
Hyperkalaemia due to redistribution across cell membranes
Hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant genetic muscle
disorder caused by mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel. It presents in early infancy with attacks of paralysis associated with hyperkalaemia.

436 Other causes of release of potassium from tissues (including muscle)
include
2 Exercise.
2 Acidosis (particularly inorganic acidosis).
2 Muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis), e.g. crush injury, revascularisation of
ischaemic limb, prolonged unconsciousness following drug intoxication.
2 Burns.
2 Tumour lysis, e.g. after initiation of chemotherapy for haematological
malignancy.
2 Drugs, e.g. digoxin, depolarising muscle relaxants, -blockers.
2 Malignant hyperthermia.

10 Renal medicine
Hyperkalaemia due to altered external balance
2 4 ingestion is seldom able to cause hyperkalaemia on its own, but can
contribute to hyperkalaemia when combined with impaired excretion
of a potassium load.
2 5 excretion may be due to decreased glomerular filtration rate, 5 urine
flow rate, 5 aldosterone production, drugs which inhibit renal tubular
potassium excretion, or genetic defects in renal potassium excretion
(pseudohypoaldosteronism, Liddles syndrome).
2 In most cases the cause is obvious.
Investigation of unexplained hyperkalaemia
Serum creatinine, creatine kinase, bicarbonate.
Urine K+, creatinine, osmolality, allowing calculation of transtubular K+
gradient ( Urine potassium & chloride measurements (p438)): occasionally useful, for instance in confirming trimethoprim-induced inhibition
of K+ secretion.
2 Tests for type IV renal tubular acidosis:
 Normal synacthen test (to exclude Addisons disease).
 24h urinary aldosterone (low in type IV RTA).
 Plasma renin and aldosterone response to upright posture and
40mg frusemide (subnormal levels of both suggest hyporeninaemic
hypoaldosteronism).
 Correction of hyperkalaemia with oral fludrocortisone 0.1mg/day.
2
2

Pseudohypokalaemia
Can be caused by delayed separation of samples kept at warm ambient
temperatures, and is caused by continued uptake of K+ into cells. This
occurs more in heparinised samples than in those allowed to clot.
Hypokalaemia due to redistribution across cell membranes
Alkalosis.
Insulin treatment.
2-adrenergic stimulation (e.g. high dose nebulisers).
B12 therapy of pernicious anaemia.
Rapid cell division, e.g. acute leukaemia.
Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (precipitated by carbohydrate intake,
rest after exercise):
 Confirm diagnosis (under strict supervision) by infusing 2g/kg
glucose and 0.1u/kg insulin; consider referral for mutation analysis
of 1-subunit of calcium channel.
 Consider thyrotoxic hypokalaemic periodic paralysis in non-familial
patients, particularly of oriental background: check thyroid function
tests.

Urine potassium &
chloride measurements
Measurement of urine potassium concentration is occasionally useful in
the differential diagnosis of hyperkalaemia. The proportion of potassium
filtered at the glomerulus which is excreted in the urine is extremely variable, and is modulated by the distal tubule in response to aldosterone,
plasma potassium concentration, acid-base balance, urine flow rate,
sodium status, and other factors. The final concentration of potassium in
the urine also depends on urine dilution, controlled independently by
factors (e.g. ADH) controlling water excretion.
Low urinary K+ (<20mmol/L) with hypokalaemia is seen in
2 Gastrointestinal potassium loss, e.g. diarrhoea, laxative abuse, villous
adenoma, high ileostomy output, enterocutaneous fistula, ureterosigmoidostomy.
2 Dietary deficiency.
2 Skin losses, e.g. burns, severe eczema.
High urinary K+ (>20mmol/L) with hypokalaemia and normal blood
pressure is seen in
2 Vomiting (K+ is exchanged for hydrogen ions: acid-base preservation
takes precedence)note: urinary chloride will be low.
2 Diuretic use, abuse and conditions which mimic diuretic use, e.g.
Bartters syndrome, Gitelmans syndrome.
2 Tubular damage causing potassium wasting, e.g. renal tubular acidosis
types 1 and 2.
2 Diabetic ketoacidosis.
High urinary K+ (>20mmol/L) with hypokalaemia and high blood pressure
is seen in
2 Hyperaldosteronismadrenal adenomas, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.
2 Apparent mineralocorticoid excess.
2 Liddles syndrome.
Transtubular potassium gradient
This is a calculation that is promoted in the USA, but not widely used in
the UK or Europe. The main purpose is to distinguish hyperkalaemia
caused by decreased aldosterone action from hyperkalaemia due to effective volume depletion. The principle is that correcting for urine dilution,
by using the ratio of plasma and urine osmolality, allows estimation of the
urine potassium gradient in the cortical collecting duct, after the main site
438 of potassium secretion (which is influenced by aldosterone) but before the
main site of urine dilution or concentration (which is influenced by ADH).
The index is only valid when the urine is concentrated, i.e. the urine osmolality exceeds the plasma osmolality, and when urine sodium concentration is >25mmol/L. It is calculated as follows:
TTKG

= {urine [K+]/(urine osmolality/plasma osmolality)}/plasma [K+]

TTKG can vary widely in healthy subjects, but is commonly around 79
2

Values <7 in a patient with hyperkalaemia suggest hypoaldosteronism.

10 Renal medicine
2

2
2

Values >7 in a hyperkalaemic patient suggest that aldosterone is acting
normally, and that hyperkalaemia is due to low urine flow, limiting the
rate at which potassium can be excreted.
Values <7 in hypokalaemic patients suggest extrarenal potassium loss.
Values >9 in hypokalaemic patients suggest renal potassium loss.

Urine chloride
This measurement is helpful in the differential diagnosis of otherwise
unexplained normotensive hypokalaemia. Urine chloride is low if
hypokalaemia is being caused by extrarenal sodium chloride or hydrogen
chloride losses, as seen in diarrhoea or vomiting respectively: in these conditions potassium is exchanged in the distal tubule for sodium or hydrogen
respectively, but chloride is conserved. Urine chloride is high when the
cause of hypokalaemia is inappropriate loss of potassium chloride, as in
diuretic use and in Bartters syndrome (the genetic equivalent of being on
permanent high dose loop diuretics) and Gitelmans syndrome (the
genetic equivalent of being on permanent high dose thiazide diuretics).
The distinction between the drug-induced and genetic causes can be very
difficult to make, but temporary withdrawal from diuretics causes intense
chloride retention and a very low urinary chloride concentration, which is
never seen in Bartters or Gitelmans syndromes. Repeated measurements
of urine chloride are therefore helpful in this situation, together with
screens for the presence of diuretics in the urine when urine chloride is
high.

Urine sodium concentration
In health, serum electrolyte concentrations are kept constant because
intake of electrolytes is balanced by excretion in the faeces and urine.
Renal excretion is tightly regulated to achieve this balance. These basic
principles imply that the urinary excretion of, for instance, sodium, is
nearly totally dependent on dietary intake of sodium. Because this is very
variable, there is no normal range of urinary sodium, or any other urinary
electrolyte. Measurements of urinary electrolytes therefore have to be
interpreted with great caution.
24h urine sodium excretion is a good marker, at steady state, for dietary 439
intake, and has been used in epidemiological studies of the relationship of
salt intake to blood pressure. Dietary sodium intake varies from as little as
10mmol/day in the Amazon rainforest to >400mmol/day in Westerners
living on processed foods. Current UK advice is to restrict sodium intake
to around 100mmol/day.
In clinical practice there are several reasons for measuring
sodium output, including
2 Calcium stone formers. Sodium and calcium excretion are linked, and
reduction of excessive salt intake results in a reduction in calcium
excretion.

2
2

Cystine stone formers. Similarly, cystine excretion is reduced by reduction of dietary salt intake.
During antihypertensive and antiproteinuric treatment. Salt restriction
amplifies the effects of ACE inhibitors in reducing not only systemic
blood pressure but also protein excretion in renal disease, and may be
more tolerable than diuretic treatment.

24h urine sodium is usually measured on a sample collected in a plain container. However, it can also be measured, by flame photometry, in a
sample collected into an acid container, and this is useful if calcium and
oxalate excretion are also being measured, for instance in stone formers.
Spot urine sodium concentration is of very limited value, because sodium
excretion varies considerably through the day and because it is normally
influenced by urine dilution and hence by recent water intake. However,
there are two situations in which it may be of value:
2 Acute renal failure. The normal response of the kidneys to underperfusion from hypovolaemia or hypotension is to retain salt avidly, urine
sodium concentration dropping to <10mmol/L. If urinary sodium concentration is this low in acute renal failure, this indicates normal ability
of the renal tubules to retain salt. Low urine sodium concentration is
seen in pre-renal renal failure; acute tubular necrosis results in loss of
tubular salt reabsorption and a higher urine sodium concentration. The
problem is that conditions other than underperfusion cause low urine
sodium (e.g. contrast nephropathy, rhabdomyolysis) and a high urine
sodium does not necessarily indicate acute tubular necrosisindeed, it
is seen in normal people. In any case, the measurement seldom has a
useful impact on management, which both in pre-renal failure and in
acute tubular necrosis is to restore renal perfusion by correcting hypovolaemia, hypotension and sepsis as quickly as possible.
2 Syndrome of inappropriate ADH . This diagnosis cannot be made in a
hypovolaemic patient, because hypovolaemia is a physiological stimulus
to ADH secretion. For this reason, the diagnosis cannot be made if the
urine sodium concentration is low ( p108).
Fractional excretion of sodium is calculated as
{(urine [sodium]  plasma [creatinine])/plasma [sodium]  urine [creatinine])}  100%
gives an index of avidity of sodium reabsorption independent of
440 This
changes in overall renal function. An FENa of <1% is seen in pre-renal
failure and >1% in acute tubular necrosis. However, this measurement is
prone to the same criticisms as that of urine sodium excretion.
Sodium wasting and sodium retaining states
Sodium wasting is caused by diuretics, Bartters syndrome, Gitelmans syndrome, and occasionally by renal tubular disease. It cannot be diagnosed
by measurement of urine sodium excretion alone, as at steady state this
equals sodium intake, but is diagnosed by finding clinical evidence of hypovolaemia without avid renal sodium retention.

10 Renal medicine
Sodium retention is caused by diseases causing effective hypovolaemia
(e.g. congestive cardiac failure), in which case the diagnosis is suggested by
oedema and the clinical signs of the underlying disease. However, sodium
retention can also cause hypertension without oedema, as in hyperaldosteronism, pseudohyperaldosteronism, chronic renal failure and inherited
disorders of renal tubular sodium excretion (e.g. Liddles syndrome).
Again, measurement of sodium excretion alone is not helpful in the diagnosis of these conditions.

Urine dipstick testing
Urine analysis is useful for screening patients with potential renal disease
and for serial assessment of patients with known renal pathology.
Many commercially available dipsticks rapidly test the urine for multiple
chemical contents. The sticks use reagent strips, which change colour, following a chemical reaction with an active constituent depending on the
presence (or absence) of a particular component.
Depending on the type of dipstick used, urine can be tested for
2 pH.
2 Specific gravity.
2 Haemoglobin.
2 Leucocyte esterases and nitrites.
2 Glucose.
2 Ketones.
2 Protein.
2 Urobilinogen.
The reagent strip is fully immersed in urine obtained by voiding or, if warranted, by urethral catheterisation, and the excess shaken off. The change
in colour, if any, is read after the time specified by the manufacturer 
usually 30s.
pH
Dipstick testing only gives a rough estimate of pH, because of the effects
of storage and reaction on exposure to atmospheric air on urine pH in
vitro. The dipstick contains a polyionic polymer bound with H+, which is
released on reaction with the cations in urine. Release of H+ causes 441
change in colour of a pH-sensitive dye. Normal pH varies between 4.5 and
8.0, depending on diet: vegetarians, in whom fixed acid ingestion is low,
commonly have alkaline urine. Urine infection with urease-producing
organisms also causes alkaline urine. Urine pH >5.5 in spite of metabolic
acidosis is seen in renal tubular acidosis. Urine pH is important in some
recurrent stone formers. For instance, uric acid solubility in urine is critically dependent on urine pH, and many uric acid stone formers are found
to have normal 24h urinary urate but highly acidic and concentrated urine
(e.g. as a result of high losses from an ileostomy). In patients with triple
phosphate stones, alkaline urine is commonly seen due to infection with
urea splitting organisms.

Specific gravity
Not accurate on dipstick testing. Non-ionic constituents including
albumin, glucose and urea are also estimated. Normal values: between
1003 and 1030, vary with the patients hydration status and hence urinary
concentration. SG 5 with age as the kidney loses its concentrating ability.
Fixed SG of 1010 is seen in chronic renal failure.
Haemoglobin
Reagent strips use peroxidase-like activity of haemoglobin to induce a
colour change in a dye linked to organic peroxide. Does not distinguish
haemoglobinuria from erythrocyturia and myoglobin. False +ve results are
obtained with myoglobin, contamination with menstrual blood and iodine.
Positive dipsticks for blood with absence of RBC on microscopy suggest
lysis of RBCs due to prolonged storage, myoglobinuria or haemoglobinuria. False ve results are seen with high dose vitamin C and rifampicin.
Leucocyte esterases and nitrites
The esterase method relies on esterases released from lysed WBC.
Esterases release pyrroles, which react with a diazonium salt on the dipstick resulting in a colour change. False +ve results seen in vaginal contamination. Presence of glucose, albumin, ketones, tetracyclines and
cephalosporins in the urine can give false ve results.
Most, but not all, uropathogenic bacteria convert nitrates to nitrites,
which react with a diazonium compound resulting in a colour change.
False ve results are due to frequent bladder emptying, prolonged
external storage and ascorbic acid. Some bacteria including N. gonorrhoea
and Mycobacterium TB do not convert nitrates.
Sensitivity and specificity of the above tests vary, and are not useful for
screening low-risk populations. However a ve test is useful in excluding
UTI in a patient with a high pre-test probability of infection.
Glucose
Most strips use the glucose oxidase/peroxidase method and can estimate
levels as low as 50mg/dL. Ketones, salicylate and ascorbic acid can interfere with results. Estimates all reducing sugars including fructose and
lactose. In the absence of concomitant hyperglycaemia, glycosuria is suggestive of proximal tubular disorders or, rarely, reduced renal threshold
for glucose.
Ketones
Acetoacetic acid is detected by the nitroprusside test. Ascorbic acid
442 results in false +ve result. Dipsticks do not detect beta hydroxybutyrate,
which comprises the largest ketone fraction in blood.
Protein
Binding of proteins to the dye indicators is highly pH dependent and the
indicators undergo a sequential colour change based on the concentration
of protein in the sample. Albumin binds at a pH of 58 and has the highest
affinity, so most commercially available dipsticks almost exclusively detect
only albumin. Sticks with sensitivity as low as 250mg/L are available currently. Dipsticks are thus cheap, reliable and give rapid semiquantitative
assessment of proteinuric renal disease. However, remember that these
tests measure concentration of protein, rather than absolute excretion;

10 Renal medicine
false negative tests are therefore possible in dilute urine caused by a high
fluid intake, and false positive tests may be obtained in highly concentrated
urine. At pH <5 or >8 results obtained by dipsticks are not accurate.
Immunoglobulin light chains (Bence Jones proteins) do not result in positive dipstick tests for proteinuria even when present in high concentrations.

Urine culture
There are numerous situations in which accurate diagnosis of UTI is
important. Sending an MSU is not, however, quite as simple as it sounds
and is not always the most appropriate test.
Obtaining a mid-stream urine sample
The aim is to obtain a sample of bladder urine, avoiding contamination by
cells or organisms on perineal skin. Men should retract the foreskin prior to
micturition; women should hold the labia well apart with the parted
fingers of one hand to allow the urine to exit directly from the urethral
meatus. The patient should be asked to begin to pass urine, and then,
without stopping passing urine, pass a sterile container into the path of the
urinary stream and collect a sample, before finishing passing urine normally. If a sterile foil container has been used to catch the specimen, the
specimen is then transferred into a specimen container and sent to the
laboratory.
Suprapubic aspiration of urine
In patients suspected of having bladder infection but in whom the results
of culture of mid-stream urines are equivocal, it may be necessary to
proceed to suprapubic aspiration (widely performed in paediatrics, but
not in adults). After skin preparation a fine needle (e.g. a lumbar puncture
needle) is introduced into the bladder by direct puncture just above the
symphysis pubis, and urine aspirated. Ultrasound can be used to confirm
that the bladder is full prior to the procedure.
Inout catheter urine specimens
Although bladder catheterisation carries a small (12%) risk of introducing
new infection into the bladder, this risk is sometimes justified by the 443
importance of obtaining urine direct from the bladder. A urethral catheter
is passed into the bladder, the first few millilitres discarded, and sample
collected.
Obtaining urine specimens from ileal conduits
Urine in ileal conduit bags is always contaminated by skin organisms, and
the culture of bag urine is not a useful way of diagnosing upper urinary
tract infection in patients with conduits. In patients suspected of having
ascending infection, a urine specimen should be obtained by passing a
catheter as far into the conduit as it will go.

Two glass test
This is a test for urethritis, and is performed when a patient presents with
dysuria or urethral discharge and a sexual history suggesting possible
recent infection. Culture of a urethral swab or of the urethral discharge
should also be obtained and sent for gonorrhoea testing (requires attendance at a sexual health clinic). Two urine samples are collected; the first
10mL passed and a mid-stream sample. Each is sent for culture; urethritis
is diagnosed when the bacterial count is highest in the first sample. The
first sample should also be sent for Chlamydia testing.
Stamey-Mears test
This test is performed for the diagnosis of prostatitis. A MSU sample is
obtained, and then the patient is asked to stop passing urine. The prostate
gland is massaged per rectum and expressed prostatic secretions
collected, followed by a final urine sample. In prostatitis, bacterial counts
are higher in the expressed prostatic secretions or the post-massage urine
sample than in the mid-stream sample.
Indwelling catheter urine specimens
Colonisation of the bladder is nearly inevitable within a fortnight of insertion of an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter. Unnecessary antibiotic treatment increases the selective pressure for the emergence of
antibiotic-resistant organisms and must be reserved for symptomatic
infection. There is no point in sending catheter specimens unless there is a
suspicion of symptomatic infection at the time. Surveillance samples sent
to predict which antibiotics should be used if the patient becomes symptomatic at a later time are unjustified, because the colonising organisms
may change over time. A fresh specimen of urine is obtained from the collection port into the collection pot. Samples should NOT be collected
from the reservoir into which the catheter drains.
Localisation tests
2 Occasionally it is justified to attempt to localise the site of infection to
the bladder or to one or other kidney.
2 The gold standard is to obtain samples from each ureter and from the
bladder during rigid cystoscopy under general anaesthesia.
2 The Fairley test requires passage of a urethral catheter followed by a
bladder washout with a wide spectrum antibacterial and a fibrinolytic
enzyme. Sequential samples of urine are then obtained. If infection is
present in the upper tracts, this will not have been affected by the
bladder washout, and organisms will be detected in the first specimen
obtained after washout, whereas if infection was confined to the
bladder, subsequent samples will be sterile.
444
2 Infection may be confined to one or other kidney as a result of
ureteric obstruction, or may be present within a renal cyst. In these situations, direct aspiration of urine under ultrasound control in the radiology department is necessary.
Microscopy and culture of urine
Once a sample has been obtained it is sent to a microbiology laboratory
for microscopy and culture.
Microscopy is required to assess pyuria (WBCs in the urine) and
contamination.

10 Renal medicine

2

Significant pyuria indicates inflammation within the urinary tract; if this
persists despite negative urine cultures the patient has sterile pyuria,
for which there are a number of causes, including infection with an
organism which does not grow on conventional culture media, e.g.
Chlamydia.
Pyuria plus a positive culture confirm the diagnosis of urinary tract
infection.
The absence of pyuria makes a urinary tract infection less likely, but
can occur in the early stages of infection or in the presence of a very
high fluid intake.
Contamination (in the female) is indicated by the presence of large
numbers of squamous cells, which usually come from the vaginal
wall; however squamous cells can occasionally come from the
bladder.

Culture and sensitivity are necessary to decide what treatment is
necessary and to differentiate contamination of the urine sample by
organisms outside the bladder from true infection.
2 A pure growth of a single organism to >105 colony-forming units
(cfu)/mL is the conventional criterion for urinary tract infection.
However:
2 Low counts of 102104cfu/mL can be associated with early infection,
and should be taken seriously in the presence of suggestive symptoms
in women.
2 Low counts in men are likely to represent true infection, because contamination is uncommon.
2 Genuine mixed growth may occur, in the presence of impaired urinary
drainage or a foreign body within the urinary tract.

Urine microscopy
Urine microscopy is a useful, quick, reliable, cheap and underused investigationthe liquid renal biopsy! Far more information can be obtained by
careful microscopy than is usually obtained in the microbiology laboratory,
where the priority is detection of significant urine infection.
Indications
2 Suspected urinary tract infection (
p443).
2 Suspected acute glomerulonephritis.
2 Suspected acute interstitial nephritis (requires staining for eosinophils).
2 Unexplained acute or chronic renal failure.
2 Haematuria (with or without proteinuria) on urine dipstick test.
2 Suspected urinary tract malignancy.
Procedure
A freshly voided, clean catch, mid-stream, early morning specimen is ideal.
The sample should be centrifuged and re-suspended in a small volume.
Although bright field microscopy will allow identification of most formed
elements in the urine sediment, phase contrast microscopy is useful for

445

detection of red cell ghosts, glomerular red cells and some other constituents. Staining of the urine sediment is not necessary for most purposes, but is useful for identification of eosinophils and malignant
cellsthis is usually performed in the cytology laboratory.
Haematuria
RBCs appear as non-nucleated biconcave disks. Even when urine is red in
colour or dipsticks positive for blood it should be examined for the presence of red cells. The differential diagnosis of haematuria is broad, but it is
broadly classified into glomerular (renal) and infrarenal causes. Transit of
red cells through the renal tubules causes osmotic changes in their shape
and size; dysmorphic or crenated red cells are best seen using phase
contrast microscopy, and may be missed altogether if bright field
microscopy is used. In experienced hands, detection of these glomerular
red cells strongly suggests a glomerular origin for haematuria, although
failure to detect these changes does not reliably indicate a lower urinary
tract cause of bleedingheavy haematuria in IgA nephropathy, for
instance, can result in large numbers of normal red cells in the urine.
Urine pH, concentration and storage can affect red cell morphology.
Leucocyturia
The presence of significant numbers of polymorphs (pyuria) in urine is
highly suggestive of urinary tract infection ( p443) but can also occur in
glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, and peri-ureteric inflammation,
for instance in acute appendicitis. The presence of leucocyte casts is
diagnostic of renal parenchymal infection (acute pyelonephritis).
Eosinophiluria is associated with acute allergic interstitial nephritis and
athero-embolic renal disease.
Other cells
Squamous epithelial cells are usually taken as indicative of vaginal contamination, but may also derive from the bladder and urethra. Occasionally
malignant cells arising from the lower urinary tract are picked up on
routine microscopy. Spermatozoa are also rarely seen.
Microorganisms
Identification of bacteriuria, in association with leucocyturia is very suggestive of infection. Organisms may be in chains or clusters and some are
motile. Fungi including yeast and protozoans including Trichomonas can
also be readily identified.
Casts
Casts are cylindrical bodies, which usually form in the distal tubule and
446 collecting duct. They consist of cells or cell debris held together by TammHorsfall protein. Staining and phase contrast microscopy improves identification and characterisation of casts, but results are operator dependent.
Extreme shaking or agitation can disintegrate casts.
Hyaline casts appear translucent and homogeneous and are present in
normal urine. Number may be increased in dehydration and
proteinuria.
Cellular casts especially red cell casts, always indicate significant
parenchymal renal disease. Red cell casts are strongly suggestive of
acute glomerulonephritis, but may occur in interstitial nephritis and
acute tubular necrosis as well.

10 Renal medicine
White cell casts are seen in acute pyelonephritis and acute interstitial
nephritis.
Granular casts are formed from cell debris and are seen in a wide
variety of renal diseases.
Waxy broad casts form in atrophic renal tubules and are seen in chronic
renal failure.
Crystals
A variety of crystals can be visualised and are of importance in stone
formers. A freshly voided sample should be examined as storage and temperature changes can affect type and number of crystals found. A large
number of calcium oxalate crystals are seen in hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria and ethylene glycol poisoning. Presence of a single crystal of cystine
is diagnostic of cystinuria as cystine is not a constituent of normal urine.
Phosphate crystals can form in normal urine as it cools, and are of no
pathological significance.

Investigations in patients with renal
or bladder stones
Not all renal tract stones are formed because of abnormal urine chemistry. They may also be formed because of stasis, e.g. in calyceal or bladder
diverticula. Infection (struvite) stones are the result of chronic infection
in the urinary tract with urease-producing organisms, which metabolise
urea to form an alkaline urine in which struvite readily precipitates.
Indications
Although up to 75% of patients who present with renal stones eventually
form a second stone, this may not be for 20 years. Most urologists therefore only refer patients for metabolic evaluation if there is a heightened
suspicion of an underlying metabolic cause.
Situations in which evaluation is definitely indicated include
2 Formation of stones in childhood or adolescence.
2 Recurrent stone formation.
2 Nephrocalcinosis (calcification in the renal parenchyma) as well as
stone formation in the collecting systems.
Radiology
Intravenous urography will usually have been performed during the
patients presentation with stone disease, but the films should be reviewed
to look for evidence of any cause of stasis within the collecting systems,
and in particular for medullary sponge kidney. Radiolucent stones can be
detected using ultrasound, intravenous urography or CT scanning, and can
be made of cystine, uric acid or xanthine. Staghorn calculi filling the collecting systems are most often struvite (infection) stones, but not

447

alwayscalcium oxalate stones can grow to similar size and shape, particularly in hyperoxaluria.
Stone analysis
Depending on the facilities in the laboratory, this may be qualitative or
semiquantitative. The purpose of analysis is to distinguish calcium stones
from cystine, urate and struvite stones, to pick up the rare types of stone,
and in addition to distinguish calcium oxalate from calcium phosphate
stones. The result of stone analysis should be used to guide further investigation. Stones can be obtained for analysis either at surgery, including
percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or by asking a patient to pass urine
through a fine sieve.
Spot urine tests
Amino acid analysis on a random sample of urine shows increased excretion of cystine, ornithine, lysine and arginine in cystinuria, and this finding
is sufficient to confirm a suspected diagnosis. However, measurement of
24h urinary cystine excretion is necessary for optimal management of this
condition.
Random urine calcium : creatinine and oxalate : creatinine ratios are used
in children to diagnose hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria, but are not as
reliable as 24h urine collections, which are preferred in adults.
24h urine collections
Collections must be made into an acidified container for measurement of
calcium and oxalate, and into a plain container for measurement of urate
(because acidification is necessary to prevent calcium binding to the plastic
surface of the urine container and to prevent in vitro generation of oxalate,
and because acidification precipitates uric acid crystals). Measurement of
sodium and citrate excretion can be made on either type of collection.
Calcium excretion is not a good predictor of stone formation (calcium
activity is less than concentration due to the presence in urine of anions
that form soluble complexes with calcium). However, marked 4 of
urinary calcium is a risk factor for stone formation.
Oxalate excretion correlates well with the risk of recurrent calcium
oxalate stone formation, even within the normal range. Marked
hyperoxaluria may result from enteric hyperoxaluria (4 colonic oxalate
absorption resulting from small bowel resection, jejunoileal bypass or
malabsorption), from excess dietary oxalate, or as a result of primary
hyperoxaluria (one of several metabolic defects causing increased
448 endogenous oxalate production).
Glycollate and L-glycerate should be measured in patients suspected of
having primary hyperoxaluria to allow differentiation between type 1
and type 2 hyperoxaluria. This investigation is only available in a few
laboratories.
Citrate excretion should be measured because citrate is a potent
inhibitor of calcium stone formation; correction of hypocitraturia with,
for instance, oral potassium citrate, reduces stone recurrence rate.
Sodium excretion (a good marker for dietary sodium intake) should be
measured in calcium stone formers and in patients with cystinuria,

10 Renal medicine
because reduction of dietary sodium intake results in decreased
excretion of calcium and cystine, respectively.
Cystine excretion should be measured in cystine stone formers. The aim
of treatment is to maintain the cystine concentration well below the
solubility limit for cystine (~1mmol/L at urine pH of 7). Worth asking
the patient to split the urine collection into day-time and night-time
aliquots to ensure that this target is met at night, when urine tends to
become more concentrated, as well as during the day.
Urinary phosphate measurement of is of no proven value in the
management even of calcium phosphate stone formers.
Tests of urinary calcium excretion
Tests performed after calcium restriction and following a high calcium test
meal have been used widely in the USA to differentiate absorptive from
renal hypercalciuria. These tests are necessary to define different phenotypes associated with hypercalciuria for research studies, but there is no
evidence that management strategies based on them have any advantage
over those based on simpler tests of urine chemistry.

Renal biopsy
Percutaneous renal biopsy is a valuable tool to establish diagnosis, suggest
prognosis and guide therapy in renal diseases. It also has a major role in
the management of a renal transplant recipient.
Definite indications (result likely to change management)
2 Nephrotic syndrome (in adults).

2 Renal involvement in multi-system disorders.
2 Diagnosis of renal transplant dysfunction.
Relative indications (result may change management or help to
define prognosis)
2 Non-nephrotic range proteinuria with or without haematuria.
2 Isolated haematuria.
2 Unexplained chronic renal failure.
2 Diabetic patient with renal dysfunction, particularly with features not
typical of diabetic nephropathy.

Procedure
1. Recent imaging of kidneys to document size and rule out obstruction is
mandatory. A recent normal platelet count, clotting profile and
informed consent is necessary.

10 Renal medicine
2. The procedure is performed where proper ultrasound facilities are
available and usually done under local anaesthesia. Sedation can be
given to an uncooperative or tense patient.
3. An attending pathologist or technician at the time of sampling to
comment on adequacy of tissue is very useful.
4. Biopsy with automated spring-loaded devices or a biopsy gun, under
ultrasound visualisation is considered ideal but techniques vary based
on availability of local expertise.
5. The patient lies supine and the kidney is identified with ultrasound.
6. The skin over the target area is prepared and anaesthetised with lignocaine.
7. A small cut in the skin is made using a scalpel. The kidney is localised
with a fine bore 21G lumbar puncture needle and local anaesthetic
infiltrated up to the level of the renal capsule. Either kidney can be
biopsied: all parenchymal renal diseases are bilateral. After suitably
protecting the ultrasound probe, the biopsy needle/gun is inserted
along the anaesthetised track under ultrasound guidance to the level of
the renal capsule, aiming to obtain a sample from the cortex of the
lower pole. The patient is asked to hold their breath while the biopsy
is taken.
8. The needle/gun is fired and subsequently withdrawn. The patient is
then allowed to breathe normally.
9. Two cores of tissue are usually taken; this may require three or four
passes with the biopsy needle. If an attending pathologist or technician
is present, they can comment on the adequacy of tissue by examining
the core for glomeruli using a hand held magnifying glass or a simple
microscope. If immunofluorescence is to be performed, part of one
core is placed in saline; the remainder is placed in formalin.
10.Following the biopsy the patient is turned supine and strict bed rest
enforced for a minimum of 6h. Vital signs are monitored every 15min
for 2h, every 30min for 2h and hourly thereafter. If no complications
are encountered at 6h the patient is allowed to mobilise. Most bleeding
complications occur within the first 8h, but bleeding can start up to 72h
after the biopsy. If macroscopic haematuria is present and does not
resolve within the observation period, discharge should be delayed.
OHCM p249.

Renal imaging
Contrast nephropathy
Renal toxicity due to radiocontrast agents may cause or exacerbate renal
impairment. Nephrotoxicity is due to a combination of local vasoconstriction and direct tubular injury. There is an increased risk in patients with
pre-existing renal impairment, diabetes, myeloma, hypovolaemia or effective hypovolaemia (e.g. congestive cardiac failure), and concurrent
administration of nephrotoxic medication including non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
Although usually reversible, contrast nephropathy can precipitate the

451

need for dialysis in patients whose renal function is already seriously
impaired. Non-ionic media, adequate hydration and acetylcysteine administered prior to the examination can reduce the risk in high-risk patients.
Details of the radiological investigation of the urinary tract appear on
pp451, 515, 565, 567, 569.
Choice of investigation
Unexplained renal impairment
When a patient first presents with renal impairment it is important to
decide whether this is acuteand therefore potentially reversibleor
chronic. Although the history, examination and blood tests may give some
clues, considerable doubt may remain.
All patients presenting with renal impairment should therefore undergo
2 Ultrasound:
 Hydronephrosis suggests obstructive nephropathy.
 Small, smooth, kidneys with increased echogenicity and decreased
corticomedullary differentiation suggest chronic parenchymal renal
disease, e.g. chronic glomerulonephritis.
 Irregular cortical scarring can be caused by reflux nephropathy, previous obstructive nephropathy (e.g. complicating renal stones) and
renal infarction from vascular disease or embolism.
 Renal asymmetry, particularly in a patient with known atherosclerosis elsewhere, suggests renal artery stenosis, although this can
just as commonly be bilateral.
 Renal enlargement can occur in acute tubular necrosis, renal vein
thrombosis and renal infiltration, e.g. in haematological malignancy.
2 Plain abdominal film (KUB kidneys, ureters, bladder):
 Nephrocalcinosis and urinary tract stones, particularly if outside the
renal pelvis can be missed on ultrasound.
Further radiological investigations, including renal angiography and isotope
scanning are sometimes helpful.
Suspected nephrolithiasis
IVU is the investigation of first choice: CT may be necessary, particularly
for radiolucent stones.

452

Investigation of haematuria
In patients over 40, and possibly in some younger patients, it is important
to exclude urinary tract malignancy. Ultrasound is the investigation of
choice for the detection of renal cell carcinoma, but will miss some transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis, which are best detected using IVU.
Investigation of suspected renal artery stenosis
In younger patients in whom fibromuscular dysplasia is suspected, conventional angiography should be performed. Atherosclerotic renal artery
stenosis can be reasonably assessed by contrast CT angiography or by
gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography.
Reflux nephropathy
Confirming this diagnosis can be important in counselling patients, as
reflux nephropathy is often inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.
Cortical scarring is best detected using a static DMSA renal scan. However,
there are other causes of cortical scarring. The diagnosis is best confirmed
by showing the combination of cortical scarring with underlying calyceal

10 Renal medicine
deformity on IVU. Demonstration of vesicoureteric reflux on direct or
indirect micturating cystourethrography is useful in infants and small children, but reflux commonly resolves with growth, so these tests are
seldom used in adults.
Obstructive uropathy
Although hydronephrosis demonstrated on IVU or ultrasound is usually
sufficient to confirm obstruction, it is possible to have obstruction without
much dilatation (e.g. complicating encasement by tumour). More commonly, there is uncertainty over whether dilatation of the collecting
system and pelvis is due to previous obstruction, now resolved, or continuing obstruction. In these situations the options are diuretic MAG3 renography, insertion of nephrostomy, or retrograde insertion of ureteric
stents. If doubt persists, a Whitaker test may be performed: this involves
infusion of saline at a constant rate through a nephrostomy tube and measuring the relationship between pressure and flow down the ureter.
Renal transplant dysfunction
The differential diagnosis usually lies between obstruction, ureteric leak,
rejection, acute tubular necrosis, nephrotoxicity and renal vein thrombosis. Depending on the centre, ultrasound with Doppler assessment of
renal blood flow (giving resistance index) or isotope renography may be
the investigation of first choice.

Renal bone disease
Parathyroid hormone
Indications
Diagnosis of primary, secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
Procedure
A heparinised sample is sent and separated within 4h of venepuncture.
There are a variety of radioimmunoassays available, and fragments of
parathyroid hormone (which accumulate in renal impairment) can
cross-react in some of these.
Other markers of bone biochemistry
Serum calcium is often normal even in patients with significant renal 453
disease, because a fall in serum calcium caused by reduced 1,25-(OH)2
vitamin D production results in an increase in parathyroid hormone secretion, returning serum calcium towards normal. Hypocalcaemia occurs
after parathyroidectomy or after treatment with bisphosphonates.
Hypercalcaemia occurs when the parathyroid hormone release loses sensitivity to serum calcium in tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
Serum phosphate is often increased in patients with renal impairment
due to impaired renal excretion of phosphate.

Serum total alkaline phosphatase rises in severe hyperparathyroidism
and in osteomalacia.
Serum bone alkaline phosphatase is a more sensitive marker of bone
turnover, but quantitative measurement is not widely available. If total
alkaline phosphatase is raised, alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be
measured as an indicator of whether the increase is of bone origin.
Serum vitamin D metabolites are seldom measured in routine clinical
management of patients with renal disease.
Serum aluminium and the desferrioxamine test
Patients with renal disease may be exposed to aluminium from contaminated water used for preparation of dialysate or by ingesting aluminium
hydroxide as an antacid or, rarely nowadays, as a phosphate binder taken
with meals. Because of the effects of aluminium on the brain, bone
marrow and bones it is important to monitor patients at risk for evidence
of aluminium accumulation.
Serum aluminium has to be taken into an aluminium-free glass tube.
Serum aluminium levels reflect current exposure, and do not give any
information about cumulative exposure. Serum aluminium levels may
be increased by iron deficiency. Levels above 60g/L (2.2mol/L) are
considered indicative of a dangerous level of exposure and should lead
to a review of treatment.
The increment in serum aluminium 24 or 48h after IV desferrioxamine is
a marker of aluminium load. The original protocol requires the use of
40mg/kg desferrioxamine; a rise in serum aluminium of >200g/L
correlates well with the presence of aluminium-related bone disease on
bone biopsy. Low dose protocols have also been described and
validated.
Skeletal survey
Severe hyperparathyroidism causes erosion of the terminal phalanges,
subperiosteal erosions, and in rare cases, brown tumours and pathological
fractures. Severe osteomalacia causes loss of bone density and Looser
zones (pseudo-fractures). These radiological signs are not commonly seen
in modern renal patients because biochemical monitoring allows earlier
detection of bone disease.
Transiliac bone biopsy
This is the gold standard for the diagnosis of renal bone disease, but is
not commonly used in clinical (as opposed to research) settings. However,
it can be useful particularly for the confirmation of aluminium-related
454 bone disease. For the maximum information to be gained from this invasive test, double tetracycline labelling should be performed.
Procedure
14 and 13 days before the procedure the patient takes a tetracycline
antibiotic, e.g. oxytetracycline 250mg qds, and 4 and 3 days before the
procedure a different tetracycline, e.g. demeclocycline 300mg bd. Under
general anaesthetic a transiliac core of bone, including both cortical surfaces, is taken and placed in absolute alcohol. The sample should be sent
to a laboratory specialising in the interpretation of bone biopsies in
patients with metabolic bone disease.

10 Renal medicine

Immunological tests in
renal medicine
Immune-mediated diseases can affect the kidney in isolation or as part of a
systemic disorder. Immunological tests commonly used to diagnose or
monitor progress of renal disease are discussed here.
Complement
Indications
Acute nephritic syndrome, renal failure with skin  neurological
involvement and suspected SLE, endocarditis or cryoglobulinaemia. The
normal complement system, its activation pathways and assay methods
are discussed elsewhere ( pXX). In relation to renal disease,
hypocomplementaemia is important and relative deficiencies of various
components can point to certain disorders.

C3 nephritic factor (C3Nef) is an IgG autoantibody that binds to and stabilises alternative pathway C3 convertaseC3bBb. This results in continuous activation of the alternative pathway with C3 depletion. It is detected
by ELISA. C3Nef is classically associated with type 2 membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis.
Immunoglobulins and serum electrophoresis for paraproteins
Indications
2 Suspected myeloma or other clonal B cell disorders.
2 Unexplained renal failure, with or without proteinuria, particularly in
patients >50 years.
2 Renal failure in association with hypercalcaemia.
Serum electrophoresis to identify a monoclonal immunoglobulin band is
useful, but should always be combined with tests for urinary light chains

455

(Bence-Jones protein), as some types of myeloma cause light chain proteinuria without a monoclonal band in the serum.
Measurement of serum immunoglobulin concentrations is of value in
patients with known myeloma, but is otherwise not useful in the assessment of patients with renal disease. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia
is seen in chronic infections, connective tissue disorders (e.g. rheumatoid
arthritis, Sjgrens syndrome), neoplasms and chronic liver disease.
Measurement of serum IgA concentration is of no value in the diagnosis of
IgA nephropathy.
Paraproteins are products of abnormal B cell clones and can be detected
in serum as monoclonal bands on immunoglobulin electrophoresis or in
urine as Bence-Jones proteins. Paraproteins may be whole immunoglobulins or heavy or light chains in isolation. Light chains are sufficiently small
to be filtered at the glomerulus, are not reabsorbed and are not picked up
on routine dipsticks. Bence-Jones proteins are light chains excreted in the
urine. Bence-Jones proteins precipitate on heating to 45C and redissolve
on boiling but are now detected by electrophoretic techniques.
Paraproteins can cause a number of different renal lesions, including
2 Myeloma cast nephropathy.
2 Light chain nephropathy.
2 AL amyloidosis.
2 Fibrillary/immunotactoid glomerulopathy (although this appearance is
more frequently not associated with a plasma cell dyscrasia).
Cryoglobulins
Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins, which precipitate on cooling and
redissolve on warming.
Cryoglobulinaemia should be suspected in
2 Renal failure with otherwise unexplained hypocomplementaemia or
positive rheumatoid factor.
2 Renal failure in association with skin and neurological involvement.
2 Unexplained proteinuria/renal failure in patients with clonal B cell disorders.
Meticulous attention to collection, transportation and assessment of the
sample is required: a serum sample must be kept at 37C and sent to the
laboratory for analysis immediately, having warned the lab that the sample
is on the way. False negative results are common due to improper han456 dling of the specimen.
Once a cryoglobulin has been found, further electrophoresis and
immunofixation allows identification of three distinct types:
2 Type 1 has a single monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA or IgM) and
is associated with monoclonal B cell disorders.
2 Type 2 has a monoclonal IgM directed against the Fc portion of IgG,
and the cryoprotein therefore consists of monoclonal IgM with polyclonal IgG. Tests for rheumatoid factor (i.e. anti-IgG antibodies) are
positive. This may be associated with haematological malignancy,
chronic hepatitis C infection or may be unexplained (essential).
2 Type 3 has polyclonal IgG and polyclonal IgM and occurs in chronic
infections (e.g. bacterial endocarditis, viral hepatitis), autoimmune dis-

10 Renal medicine
orders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, SLE) or may be unexplained
(essential).
Hypocomplementaemia, especially very low C4 levels due to classical
complement pathway activation is characteristic and helpful in diagnosing
active cryoglobulinaemic disorder. Renal disease can present as an acute
nephritic disorder or as nephrotic syndrome and is usually seen in association with skin and systemic involvement.
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)
These are autoantibodies directed against enzymes present in the cytoplasm of human neutrophils. They are present in nearly all patients with
small vessel vasculitis (including Wegeners granulomatosis, microscopic
polyangitis, renal limited crescentic GN and Churg-Strauss syndrome).
However, a negative ANCA does not rule out vasculitis, and false positive
tests occur, so the test is not a substitute for renal biopsy.
Indications
2 Suspected rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
2 Suspected pulmonary-renal syndrome.
2 Unexplained multi-system disease with or without renal involvement.
The test requires a serum sample. Immunofluorescent techniques using
alcohol-fixed human neutrophils are used as a screening test. In this test
the staining pattern may be described as cytoplasmic, cANCA or perinuclear, pANCA, depending on the distribution of fluorescence (reflecting
binding of the autoantibody in the serum to cytoplasmic constituents).
This test can be difficult to interpret in the presence of a strong antinuclear antibody.
Positive tests should be followed by an enzyme-linked immunoassay
(ELISA) to confirm the specificity of the autoantibody. A positive cANCA
is usually associated with autoantibodies against proteinase 3 (PR3), and
positive pANCA with myeloperoxidase (MPO).
Presence of PR3 or MPO-specific ANCA has a sensitivity and specificity of
greater than 90% for small vessel vasculitis. PR3-ANCA/cANCA is prevalent in Wegeners and MPO-ANCA/pANCA is seen more commonly in
renal limited crescentic GN and microscopic polyangitis, but there is considerable overlap. ANCA titres usually but not always correlate with 457
disease activity and can be used to monitor treatment and screen for
relapse.
Non-specific ANCAs are occasionally detected in association with systemic infection and other autoimmune disorders and are of little diagnostic value.

Antiglomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM
antibody)
Indications
2 Acute nephritic syndrome with or without lung haemorrhage.
Goodpastures syndrome is caused by an autoantibody against a component of type IV collagen which is only found in the glomerular basement
membrane and in the lung. It causes rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and, particularly in smokers and patients with other preexisting lung disease, pulmonary haemorrhage. The disease evolves
rapidly, and the earlier that it is diagnosed and definitive treatment started
(with plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids), the
better the outcome. Tests for circulating antiglomerular basement membrane are performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) using type IV collagen. A positive test in a patient suspected of
having the disease is sufficient evidence to proceed to treatment pending
confirmation by renal biopsy; a negative test is not sufficient to exclude
the diagnosis.
Antinuclear antibodies
Autoantibodies against a wide range of nuclear antigens occur in SLE,
Sjgrens syndrome, scleroderma and other connective tissue diseases.
These tests are described in detail elsewhere ( p250). Some of these,
particularly SLE and scleroderma, may involve the kidneys. It is unusual for
renal disease to be the first manifestation of SLE, but monitoring of complement levels and anti-dsDNA titres are valuable in monitoring the progression of disease. Scleroderma may present with a scleroderma renal
crisis, a syndrome of rapidly worsening renal function and severe hypertension that shares many characteristics with accelerated phase hypertension. In this setting, tests for the characteristic autoantigens (e.g. scl-70)
can help confirm the diagnosis.

General principles
Many poisoned patients recover without specific management other than
supportive care. A minority have life-threatening toxicity. In assessing the
poisoned patient it is important to ensure adequate airway, breathing and
circulation, take an adequate history and undertake a full clinical examination. Tablets, bottles, syringes, aerosol containers and other items found
with or near the patient should be retained, although it is usually best to
analyse biological specimens (usually blood and/or urine) if analytical confirmation of exposure is required.
The role of blood or urine tests in toxicology
Close collaboration between analytical staff and clinicians is required if
anything other than the simplest toxicological analysis is to be useful.
Toxicological analysis using blood or urine is used to confirm the diagnosis
of poisoning when this is in doubt or for medicolegal purposes, to help the
management, in the diagnosis of brain death, or to work out the time to
restart chronic drug therapy. Few centres have full analytical toxicology
services and a toxicology screen rarely influences inpatient management,
with the exception of paracetamol, salicylate, lithium, digoxin and iron poisoning, and on occasions a drugs of abuse screen. Toxicological analysis of
blood plasma or serum is also of value if an extracorporeal method of
elimination such as haemodialysis is being contemplated. Any toxicology
screen should be tailored to that patients circumstances and the poisons
commonly encountered in that country. In Western Europe and North
America, most patients will have taken drugs, but pesticide poisoning, for
example, is common in less developed countries.
Plasma paracetamol, salicylates, lithium, digoxin and iron measurements in
blood are usually available on an urgent basis. For other patients, particularly those who present a complex clinical picture or who are unconscious, a 50mL sample of urine and a 10mL sample of heparinised blood
should be collected on admission and stored at 4C (7refrigerator). This
can be analysed later if it is felt the result will influence your management,
or is needed for medicolegal purposes (see below). Urine is useful for
screening, especially for drugs of abuse, as it is often available in large
volumes and often contains higher concentrations of poisons and their
metabolites than blood. The samples should be obtained as soon as possible after admission, ideally before drug therapy is initiated. Urine samples
usually provide qualitative results, e.g. detect the presence of amphetamines or benzodiazepines. Quantitative measurements in urine are of little
use because some compounds, such as benzodiazepines, are extensively
460 metabolised prior to excretion in urine.

Sample requirements
Plasma or serum is normally used for quantitative assays for drugs and
drug metabolites and in general there are no marked significant differences
in concentration between these fluids. Evacuated blood tubes and containers containing gel separators or softrubber stoppers are not recommended if a toxicological analysis is to be performed as plasticisers
(phosphates and phthalates) used in many such tubes may interfere with

11 Poisoning & overdose
chromatographic methods and volatile compounds such as carbon
monoxide or ethanol may be lost.
EDTA tubes are preferred for carboxyhaemoglobin assays and for mea-

surement of lead, and some other metals such as these are concentrated
in red blood cells. A fluoride/oxalate tube should be used if ethanol,
cocaine or benzodiazepines are being assayed, although special tubes containing 1% (W/V) fluoride are needed if enzymic hydrolysis of these and
other compounds is to be completely prevented.
The use of disinfectant swabs containing alcohols should be avoided, as
should heparin, which contains phenolic preservatives (chlorbutol, cresol)
and preservatives containing mercury salts (see table opposite).
Samples of medicolegal importance
A toxicology screen is helpful if murder, assault or child abuse is suspected.
Samples collected in such cases are often so important that they should be
kept securely at 20C or below, until investigation of the incident is concluded. Legal requirements mean that all specimens should be clearly
labelled with the patients family or last name and any forenames, the date
and time of collection and the nature of the specimen, if this is not obvious.
Strict chain of custody procedures should be implemented and the doctor
or nurse taking the sample should seal the bag with a tamper-proof device
and sign and date the seal. A chain of custody form must accompany the
sample and should be signed and dated by every person taking possession of
the sample. The sample should be secured in a locked container or refrigerator if left unattended before arrival at the laboratory.

Methods used in
analytical toxicology
A range of chromatographic and other methods such as radioligand
immunoassays are available for toxicological analyses. Plasma concentrations associated with serious toxicity range from micrograms per litre
(mg/L) in the case of drugs such as digoxin to grams per litre (g/L) in the
case of ethanol. Specialised labs used a combination of solvent extraction
and thin layer chromatography (TLC) together with gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) using either flame-ionisation or selective detectors such as
nitrogen/phosphorus detectors or mass spectroscopy (MS) as the basis for
a poison screen. It is unwise to use TLC without corroboration of results
by another method, e.g. GLC, because the resolution power of TLC is
limited and interpretation of chromatograms is subjective. A commercial
kit for TLC (Toxi-lab, Marion Laboratories) is supplied with a compendium
of colour plates but even so problems can arise in differentiation of compounds with similar mobility and colour reactions. The kit is aimed at the
US market and some common UK drugs are not included.
Spectrophotometry is commonly used to measure salicylates, iron and
carboxyhaemoglobin. However, UV spectrophotometry and spectrophotofluorimetry are often used as detectors for high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and in immunoassays. Spectrophotometric
methods and immunoassays often suffer from interference from metabolites or other drugs. Immunoassays have the advantage of long shelf life
and simplicity, but all require confirmation with a chromatographic
method if the results are to stand scrutiny. This is because immunoassays
for small molecules are often not specific, e.g. some urine amphetamine
immunoassays give positive results with proguanil, isoxuprine, labetalol,
tranylcypromine and phenylethylamine. The Syva Emit antidepressant
assay cross-reacts with phenothiazines after overdose. Chromatographic
methods have the advantage of selectivity and sensitivity and ability to
perform quantitative measurements, but are expensive. Generally, GLC is
still used to measure basic drugs and HPLC is used to analyse specific compounds/groups of compounds.
Modern methods of assay for heavy metals vary enormously. Isotope dilution mass spectrometry is a reference method. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry, with either flame or electrothermal atomisation is used
most widely. In the case of iron though, reliable kits based on the formation of a coloured complex are available.

462 There is wide variation in the units that various laboratories use to report
results. This has caused confusion and errors in treatment and great care
is needed to ensure that clinical interpretation is undertaken in full knowledge of the units used.

11 Poisoning & overdose

Brainstem death testing &
organ donation
Brain death cannot be diagnosed in the presence of drugs that mask CNS
activity. There is a rule of thumb, based on the pharmacological principle
that most drugs need five half-lives to be effectively eliminated from the
circulation, to allow four half-lives of any drug to elapse before declaring
death, or to allow at least 23 days for drug effects to wear off. Whether
this is satisfactory for patients with organ failure and hence impaired drug
elimination is unclear and often in such patients measurement of plasma
concentrations of residual drugs is required to determine whether brainstem death tests are valid or whether a drug could be interfering with the
results.
Selected donor organs from those who have died from poisoning by tricylic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, insulin, carbon
monoxide, cocaine, methanol and paracetamol have been used in transplantation. It is important to identify which organs act as reservoirs for
drugs and either not consider such organs, e.g. a liver from a paracetamolpoisoned patient, or take prophylactic precautions like N-acetylcysteine
administration in the case of donation of a heart from a paracetamol-poisoned patient.

Interpretation of arterial blood gases
in poisoned patients
Interpretation of blood gas values is covered in OHCM pp154, 684.
Essentially four patterns emerge, which may be mixed together.
Respiratory acidosis
Hypoventilation results in retention of carbon dioxide. This can occur
after an overdose with any drugs that depress the central nervous system
(CNS), e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, opioids and barbiturates.
Respiratory alkalosis
Hyperventilation with respiratory alkalosis is classically caused by aspirin
(commonly measured as salicylates). It can also occur in response to 463
hypoxia, drugs and CNS injury.
Metabolic alkalosis
Metabolic alkalosis is very uncommon in poisoning. Rarely it may result
from excess administration of alkali, e.g. deliberate alkali ingestion.

Jones AL, Simpson KJ. (1998) Drug abusers and poisoned patients: a potential source of organs
for transplantation? Q J Med 91, 589592.

Metabolic acidosis
This is the commonest metabolic abnormality in poisoning. If acidosis is
particularly severe (e.g. pH<7.2), this should raise the question of poisoning by ethanol, methanol or ethylene glycol. Measuring the anion gap
and osmolal gaps are helpful in further differentiation ( Ethylene glycol,
ethanol & methanol (p470)).

Amphetamines & derivatives (MDMA
(ecstasy), MDEA (eve), MDA (adam))
The following investigations should be considered in patients presenting
to hospital with acute amphetamine(s) intoxication.
Plasma urea and electrolytes and glucose
It is critical that at least one set of U&E are checked in every patient. Most
are profoundly dehydrated and require vigorous rehydration. Some
patients develop hyponatraemia, often after drinking excess water and
antidiuretic hormone secretion may be responsible for this ( OHCM
p692). Hypoglycaemia may occur.
Dipstick test of urine for myoglobin and subsequent serum
creatine kinase
A hyperthermic (serotonin-like) syndrome with autonomic instability and
rigidity, can develop leading to rhabdomyolysis. Dipstick testing of urine is
positive for blood as myoglobin is detected by the haemoglobin assay. This
is an indication that serum CK should be then be measured. If found to be
elevated, adequate rehydration is needed to avoid deposition in renal
tubules and incipient renal failure.
Full blood count
Rarely, aplastic anaemia (
(MDMA) ingestion.

OHCM p664) has been reported after ecstasy

Clotting studies
Disseminated intravascular coagulation ( OHCM p652) can occur, often
in the context of hyperthermia. Once liver damage ensues the INR/PT
( OHCM p648) will rise.
Temperature
Hyperpyrexia can lead to rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular
coagulation and hepatocellular necrosis. Risks relate to the time in hours
spent above 39C. A rectal thermometer is the most accurate measure of
464 temperature.
Liver function tests
Acute liver injury can occur with a rise in aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), often of several thousands.
iiNB Dont miss a hidden paracetamol overdosecheck paracetamol
levels in blood, from the earliest sample you have on that patient!
ECG
Cardiac arrhythmias are common and deaths, which occur soon after
ingestion, may be due to these. Arrhythmias are often supraventricular,
though ventricular ones also occur.

11 Poisoning & overdose
Urine tests
Urine tests, e.g. EMIT dipstick system or by immunoassay in the laboratory,
are sensitive and group specific for amphetamines and can confirm an
amphetamine has been ingested if that is in doubt, e.g. agitated patient in
A&E. Note: Amphetamine, MDMA, MDEA and MDA concentrations in blood
do not correlate with clinical signs and are of no value in management.

Anticonvulsants
These can be assayed in blood by gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC)
methods and in urine by thin layer chromatography (TLC) methods.
Carbamazepine toxicity
Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and its active metabolite 10, 11epoxide can be measured by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) but do not correlate at all well with the degree of toxicity. Thus
carbamazepine levels are seldom performed unless the diagnosis is in
doubt or there is concern about a therapeutic excess. The therapeutic
range is between 8 and 12mg/L (0.55.5 mg/L for the active metabolite,
10,11-epoxide). Toxicity has been seen with carbamazepine concentrations above 20mg/L (85mmol/L). Coma, fits, respiratory failure and conduction abnormalities have been seen with concentrations in excess of
40mg/L (170mmol/L).
An ECG should be performed in all but the most trivial carbamazepine
overdosage (e.g. >4 tablets) and inspected for the following:
2 First degree atrioventricular block.
2 QRS prolongation.
2 Loss of P waves.
The U&E should be checked as hyponatraemia and SIADH ( OHCM
p638) have been reported. Hypoglycaemia has also been reported.
Lamotrigine toxicity
Plasma concentrations of lamotrigine can be measured for compliance
purposes (therapeutic range 14mg/L; upper limit may be as high as
10mg/L) but are not of value in the overdose situation.
An ECG should be performed in all but the most trivial lamotrigine overdosage (e.g. more than four tablets) and should be inspected and
reviewed for QRS prolongation.
Valproate toxicity
Plasma concentrations of sodium valproate can be measured by HPLC but
do not correlate well with either with depth of coma or risk of seizures
after overdose. Thus valproate concentrations are seldom performed
unless the diagnosis is in doubt. The therapeutic range is 40100mg/L.
U&E and glucose should be measured as hypernatraemia, hypoglycaemia
and hypocalcaemia have been reported after valproate overdosage.

465

Phenytoin toxicity
Most patients with acute phenytoin poisoning do not require measurement of the plasma phenytoin concentration. An urgent phenytoin measurement may be helpful however in severe phenytoin poisoning where
charcoal haemoperfusion is contemplated, e.g. in the presence of deep
coma, respiratory depression and/or arrhythmias, particularly if the diagnosis is in doubt. Charcoal haemoperfusion is considered if the plasma
phenytoin concentration is rapidly rising towards or exceeds 100mg/L.
Patients with suspected chronic phenytoin toxicity as a result of therapeutic dosing should have their plasma phenytoin concentration measured. The therapeutic range is 1020mg/L. Routine measurements may
be useful to monitor anticonvulsant therapy or to time re-institution of
chronic therapy after overdose.

Benzodiazepines
Most patients who have taken an overdose with benzodiazepines just
sleep off the drug without sequelae within 24h. However, more severe
effects can occur when benzodiazepines are mixed with other drugs such
as tricyclic antidepressants, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory disease. Pulse oximetry is useful for monitoring the
adequacy of ventilation if significant CNS depression is present.
Generally, measuring benzodiazepine concentrations in blood or urine is
not of value in the management of benzodiazepine overdose patients.
Rarely a urine screen by EMIT (immunoassay) is undertaken to confirm
ingestion. Liquid chromatography simultaneously assays diazepam and its
polar metabolites, and postmortem blood concentrations of 5mg/L and
19mg/L have been found in fatalities.

Carbon monoxide
Carbon monoxide is the commonest cause of death by poisoning in the
UK. Those particularly at risk include patients with pre-existing cardiac or
respiratory disease.
COHb
A carboxyhaemoglobin concentration in blood confirms exposure and
should be measured urgently in all patients with suspected carbon
466 monoxide poisoning, including those with smoke inhalation. The space
above the blood in the sample tube (headspace) should be minimised.
Normally expected values for COHb are up to 5% in non-smokers and up
to 10% in smokers. However, after acute exposure the blood HbCO concentration does not indicate the severity of poisoning because HbCO
begins to dissociate from the moment of removal from the source of
exposure, and the rate of dissociation is also dependent on factors such as
oxygen administration in the ambulance. Thus the use of nomograms to
back-extrapolate to find the initial highest COHb is meaningless and
pointless. Management of the patient is determined by the clinical condi-

11 Poisoning & overdose
tion and also on circumstantial evidence such as the intensity and duration
of exposure, rather than a HbCO concentration per se, although a level of
>40% has been used as one criterion to guide the use of hyperbaric
oxygen. A patient should be administered high flow oxygen (e.g. 12L/min
through a tightfitting, e.g. CPAP, mask) until the COHb is <5% and clinical
signs of carbon monoxide poisoning such as impaired heel-toe walking and
fingernose incoordination have resolved.
Arterial blood gases
Any patient with suspected poisoning by carbon monoxide requires arterial blood gas analysis. Oxygen saturation monitors are misleading as they
read carboxyhaemoglobin as oxyhaemoglobin (HbO) and the true oxygen
saturation of the patient can only be determined by arterial blood gas
analysis.
ECG
An ECG should be performed in anyone severely poisoned (e.g. drowsiness or any neurological abnormality, chest pain or breathlessness) or
with pre-existing heart disease. ECG changes such as ST segment depression, T-wave abnormalities, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation and
arrest can occur. If ischaemia/infarction is seen on the ECG or suspected
clinically, the patient should also have cardiac enzymes sent.

Cocaine
Cocaine is snorted into the nose or injected intravenously.
Blood pressure monitoring
Patients with cocaine intoxication should have frequent measurements of
their blood pressure, as hypertension is a significant risk, and strokes or
myocardial infarcts have been widely reported. A Dynamap or equivalent
advice for repeated measurements is suitable.
ECG and cardiac enzymes
Cocaine-induced angina and myocardial infarction is common. ECG monitoring is advised for all but the most trivial exposure to cocaine.
Appropriate cardiac enzyme activity, i.e. CK, AST, LDH, should also be
performed in any patient with chest pain or ECG abnormalities. The predictive value of troponin T estimations in this condition has not been eval467
uated.
Urine or blood testing
Cocaine can be detected in urine by simple drugs of abuse screening
tests, e.g. EMIT testing. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy is more
specific and can be carried out on blood or urine. Metabolites of cocaine
(benzoylecgonine) can be detected in urine 23 days after exposure.
Cocaine is unstable in blood and samples are best taken into 1% w/v fluoride oxalate tubes if medicolegal sequelae are a possibility. Nasal insufflation of 106mg of the drug to 6 volunteers produced mean peak plasma

concentrations of 0.22mg/L at 0.5h and 0.61mg/L for the metabolite benzoylecgonine at 3h. Smoking 50mg in 6 volunteers produced mean peak
plasma concentrations of 0.2mg/L at 0.08h and 0.15mg/L for bezoylecgonine at 1.5h. Patients have survived plasma concentrations of 5.2mg/L but
usually fatalities are associated with cocaine/benzoylecgonine concentrations in excess of 5mg/L, depending on the route of use. The IV route is
the most dangerous.

Cyanide
Cyanide poisoning can occur by deliberate inhalation of gas, ingestion of
salts or by exposure in industrial fires.
Arterial blood gas estimation
Such measurements are essential to determine the oxygen saturation and
acid-base status of the patient.
Serum lactate
This is very helpful in confirming suspected toxicity. It is likely to exceed
7mmol/L in cases of significant exposure.
ECG
All patients should have an ECG. It should be examined for evidence of
ischaemic damage, e.g. ST depression, ST elevation, T-wave inversion.
Cyanide assay
Blood cyanide concentrations are rarely of use in emergency management
because they cannot be measured quickly enough. However, a sample
should be taken before antidote administration for assay at a later stage.
Cyanide concentrations of <0.2mg/L are normal; 1.02.5mg/L causes
obtundation and coma; and more than 2.5mg/L is potentially fatal.
iiNB Dicobalt edetate antidote should only be given if cyanide
poisoning is certain, i.e. a proper history is available, otherwise you will
kill your patient. Otherwise give oxygen, sodium thiosulphate and
sodium nitrite and/or hydroxocobalamin; these are antidotes that can
safely be given without certainty of cyanide ingestion. Excessive administration of sodium nitrite however can cause significant methaemoglobinaemia.

468

Digoxin
Patients who are already taking digoxin and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are more susceptible to digoxin toxicity after overdosage. Digoxin toxicity can also result from progressive renal impairment

Jones AL, Dargan PI. (2001) Churchills Pocketbook of Toxicology, Churchill-Livingstone, Edinburgh.

11 Poisoning & overdose
and hence reduced elimination of the drug or due to interactions with
other drugs such as amiodarone, calcium channel blockers or quinine, as
well as overdoses.
ECG
All patients with suspected digoxin poisoning should have a 12-lead ECG
and all symptomatic patients should be attached to a cardiac monitor.
Digoxin poisoning can cause virtually any type of cardiac arrhythmia. The
combination of heart block with tachyarrhythmia is very common.
Plasma digoxin concentration
Absorption of digoxin often peaks at 46h after ingestion. Its half-life is in
excess of 30h. Digitoxin is a structurally-related drug that has an even
longer plasma half-life (6 days). A digoxin measurement is a useful, but not
absolute, guide to toxicity as plasma digoxin concentrations correlate
poorly with the severity of poisoning, particularly early in the course of
acute poisoning. However it is desirable (though not essential) if antidigoxin Fab antibody fragments are to be used, as it is useful in calculating
the dose of fragments (see below), as well as confirming exposure. Plasma
digoxin concentrations cannot be interpreted after administration of
digoxin antibody fragments using normal assay procedures. Samples taken
to investigate probable chronic digoxin intoxication should be taken at
least 6h after dosing. They are not normally analysed urgently unless lifethreatening features of toxicity are present and use of antibody fragments
(Fab) is being considered. The therapeutic range for digoxin is
0.82.0mg/L.
Urea and electrolytes
It is important to ascertain if the patient has any renal impairment and
plasma creatinine and urea are helpful, though of course do not exclude
renal impairment completely. Hyperkalaemia is common in acute digoxin
overdose and may be severe, e.g. >7mmol/L. If possible a magnesium level
is helpful to exclude hypomagnesaemia, which contributes to risk of cardiotoxicity and is easily corrected.
Indications for Fab fragments and doses of Fab fragments
Severe hyperkalaemia (>6.0mmol/L) resistant to treatment with
insulin/dextrose infusion.
2 Bradycardia or heart block associated with hypotension.
2 Tachyarrhythmias associated with hypotension, especially ventricular
arrhythmias.

Fab antibody fragment administration should be considered in less severe
stages of poisoning in older patients and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

Ethylene glycol, ethanol or methanol
poisoning
A history of ingestion or the presence of a metabolic acidosis raises suspicion of poisoning with these substances. Calculation of the anion gap and
osmolal gaps is helpful in the assessment of such patients.
Anion gap
Calculating the anion gap =
([Na+] + [K+])  ([Cl] + [HCO3])
The normal anion gap is 12  2
Many toxins cause a high anion gap acidosis and these include
2 Ethanol.
2 Methanol (Note: the high anion gap is due to metabolites and may take
several hours to develop).
2 Ethylene glycol (Note: the high anion gap is due to the metabolites and
470
may take 624h to develop).
2 Metformin.
2 Cyanide.
2 Isoniazid.
2 Salicylates (aspirin).
This list can be further reduced by measuring the osmolal gap.
Osmolal gap
This is the difference between the laboratory estimation of osmolality
(Om) and calculated osmolality (Oc).

11 Poisoning & overdose
Calculating the osmolal gap =
Oc = 2([Na+] + [K+]) + [urea] + [glucose]
The osmolal gap is normally <10
Toxic causes of a raised osmolal gap include
2 Methanol.
2 Ethylene glycol.
2 Diethylene glycol.
2 Isopropanol.
2 Ethanol.
The acronym MEDIE can be a helpful mnemonic.
Ethylene glycol and methanol plasma concentrations
Often the diagnosis of ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning can be difficult because assays for these substances are not widely available. If possible, their measurement can help manage severe intoxication. Other
parameters may have to be used, i.e. anion gap, osmolal gap and arterial
blood gas analysis. A normal osmolal gap does not exclude poisoning with
ethylene glycol or methanol, but if the osmolal gaps and anion gaps are
both normal and the patient is not symptomatic, then significant ingestion
is unlikely to have occurred. In general, ethylene glycol or methanol measurements should not be carried out unless metabolic acidosis is present
and there is an anion gap.
Ethylene glycol and methanol concentrations in blood are useful to
confirm ingestion, and indicate when to stop antidotal treatment (with
ethanol or 4-methylpyrazole) and/or haemodialysis (>500mg/L, see below).
However, a low concentration may just mean that most of the parent
compound has been metabolised. Formate (i.e. the methanol metabolite)
levels can also be checked in patients who may have taken methanol.
Microscopy of urine for oxalate crystals
In suspected ethylene glycol poisoning, microscopy should be performed
to look for oxalate crystals; however they are only present in 50% of
cases, and often only many hours after ingestion. Treatment of a patient
should not be delayed or dependent upon looking for crystals.
Plasma ethanol concentrations
Plasma ethanol concentrations are usually not needed in patients who are
drunk unless there is doubt about the diagnosis, e.g. patients with a
widening osmolar gap or the patient is so severely poisoned that
haemodialysis is being considered for the ethanol poisoning. They are,
however, essential to guide appropriate use of ethanol as an antidote in
ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning (see below). Rarely, a plasma
ethanol measurement will be needed in child protection cases and such
sampling will need chain of custody and a specific (GLC) method by a specialist laboratory.

471

Antidotal therapy with ethanol
The dose of ethanol for treatment of ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning can be very difficult to predict because ethanol metabolism is variable and unpredictable. It is therefore important to frequently recheck the
blood ethanol concentrations on patients receiving an ethanol infusion.
The dose should be adjusted to achieve a blood ethanol concentration of
11.5g/L.
Indications for continued ethanol therapy are
2 Methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning with blood concentrations
>200mg/L.
2 Metabolic acidosis with pH<7.3.
2 Osmolal gap >10mOsmol/kg water.
2 Formate concentration >10mg/L.
2 Urinary oxalate crystals.
2 Severe symptoms.
Indications for haemodialysis in methanol or ethylene glycol
poisoning are
2 Methanol or ethylene glycol concentration >500mg/L.
2 Severe metabolic acidosis (pH<7.3) unresponsive to therapy, i.e. arterial blood gases are needed in all cases of high anion gap poisoning.
2 Renal failurehence it is essential to check plasma urea and electrolytes in all patients.
2 Presence of visual problems in methanol poisoning.
2 Formate concentration >500mg/L in methanol poisoning.
iHaemodialysis should be continued until the methanol/ethylene glycol
concentration is <200mg/L.

Iron
Serum iron concentrations
Serum iron concentrations should be measured urgently in all patients
who may have ingested more than 30mg/kg of elemental iron, unless no
symptoms have developed 6h or more after ingestion, and should be
taken at 4h and a further one at 68h after ingestion. One 200mg tablet of
ferrous sulphate contains 60mg elemental iron. If a sustained-release
preparation of iron has been taken, an initial serum iron concentration
should be taken. A blood sample taken later after ingestion may underestimate the iron as it may have already started distributing to tissues, i.e. in
472 a late presenting patient a low concentration cannot be interpreted, but a
high one indicates toxicity. If the antidote desferrioxamine is given before
4h have elapsed, it interferes with the colorimetric assay for iron and so a
serum sample for iron should be taken off before it is given. If atomic
absorption spectrophotometry is available for measurement of serum
iron, there is no interference from desferrioxamine.
It is essential to interpret the serum iron concentration result in the
context of the clinical state of the patient. If <55mmol/L (<300mg/dL),

11 Poisoning & overdose
mild toxicity is expected. If above 90mmol/L (500mg/dL), severe toxicity is
expected and treatment with desferrioxamine is necessary. Antidotal
treatment is also indicated for patients with iron concentrations
>55mmol/L if there is additional clinical evidence of toxicity, e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms, leucocytosis or hyperglycaemia. Antidotal therapy with
desferrioxamine is indicated without waiting for the serum iron concentration in patents with severe features (e.g. fitting, unconscious or
hypotensive). Desferrioxamine is usually continued until the urine has
returned to a normal colour, symptoms have abated and all radio-opacities of iron tablets on abdominal x-ray have disappeared. Urine free iron
estimation is the best test of when to stop chelation therapy with desferrioxamine, but is not widely available.
Working out if the patient needs a serum iron level checked
If a patient has ingested <30mg/kg body weight of elemental iron (a 200mg
ferrous sulphate tablet  60mg elemental iron) then no serum iron level is
required. If in doubt a plain abdominal x-ray will usually indicate if lots of
tablets are present. A serum concentration of <55mmol/L (<300mg/dL)
also indicates low risk (see above).
Abdominal x-ray
This is required in patients who have ingested in excess of 30mg elemental
iron/kg body weight. The AXR determines the need for gut decontamination either by gastric lavage or whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene
glycol. Undissolved tablets appear radio-opaque but they disappear once
dissolved, so the absence of radio-opacities does not exclude the possibility of toxicity.
Full blood count
This is needed in all cases of iron poisoning. A leucocytosis (>15  109/L)
is common with significant toxicity.
Blood glucose
Hyperglycaemia is common in serious poisoning.
Arterial blood gases
These should be checked in symptomatic or severely poisoned patients.
Metabolic acidosis is common.
Total iron binding capacity
This has no role in the assessment of acute iron poisoning.
What to do if estimation of serum iron concentration is
unavailable
If serum iron assay is not available, the presence of nausea, vomiting,
leucocytosis (>15  109/L) and hyperglycaemia (>8.3mmol/L) suggests
significant ingestion and the need for treatment with desferrioxamine.
OHCM p828.

Lead poisoning
Blood lead concentrations
Blood lead concentrations are used to confirm the diagnosis and decide
on whether chelation therapy is required. Samples are not urgent
(except in the case of suspected acute lead encephalopathy) and must be
taken into an EDTA tube. Normal concentrations are <100mg/L. Lead
causes changes in red cell and urinary porphyrins, but these are not measured routinely. A plain AXR should be performed in all children, particularly if there is a history of pica, to exclude ingested paint or lead foreign
bodies such as curtain pulls. Long bone x-rays in children may show lead
lines.
There are two agents used for chelation therapy in lead poisoning: (1)
intravenous EDTA (disodium calcium edetate) and (2) oral DMSA (2,3dimercaptosuccinic acid). Before use, chelation therapy should be discussed with a poisons centre. In general patients with a blood lead
concentration >450mg/L should be treated with chelation therapy and
removal from further exposure. Children with encephalopathy or a blood
lead concentration of >750mg/L require admission to hospital for urgent
chelation therapy.
Other essential investigations
Patients should also have a full blood count and blood film (for basophilic
stippling), urea and electrolytes, liver function tests and serum calcium
measured.

Lithium
Blood lithium concentration
Lithium is available as sustained-release, non-sustained-release tablets and
liquid. After ingestion of liquid preparations, plasma lithium concentrations
peak at 30min. With sustained-release preparations peak concentrations
occur at 45h. The plasma half-life is often in excess of 24h. Interpretation
of plasma lithium concentrations depends on the clinical circumstances of
exposure (see below). Do not take blood for lithium levels into a lithium
heparin tube!
Acute overdose in lithium nave patient
A single overdose in a lithium nave patient is of low risk. However, onset
of toxicity may be delayed for as much as 24h. Samples for lithium assay
474 should be taken at 6h post-ingestion and measured urgently. Consider
haemodialysis if plasma lithium concentration is >7.5mmol/L.
Chronic excess of lithium
Lithium toxicity can occur if the patient has been taking too high a dose, is
dehydrated, or if an interaction with thiazide diuretics, NSAIDs, ACE
inhibitors or tetracycline has occurred. Risk of toxicity is further enhanced
by the presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiac failure, renal failure or
schizophrenia. Blood for plasma lithium assay should be taken at presentation. Consider haemodialysis if the plasma lithium exceeds 2.5mmol/L.

11 Poisoning & overdose
Acute on chronic lithium poisoning
A patient taking lithium chronically who takes an acute overdose is at risk
of serious toxicity, because tissue binding of lithium is already high. The
plasma lithium levels should be measured urgently at 6h post-ingestion.
Lithium measurements should be repeated 612 hourly in symptomatic
patients until clinical improvement occurs. Consider haemodialysis if
plasma concentrations exceed 4mmol/L.
Indications for haemodialysis
Lithium is effectively removed by haemodialysis. It is indicated in all
patients with severe lithium poisoning, i.e. coma, convulsions, respiratory
failure or acute renal failure. Plasma lithium concentrations can also guide
the need for haemodialysis. Each hour of dialysis will reduce the plasma
lithium by 1mmol/L, but plasma lithium often rebounds after haemodialysis so the assay should be repeated at the end of dialysis and again 612h
later.
Urea and electrolytes
Hyponatraemia is common in lithium toxicity. It is also important to check
the serum potassium concentration and urea, as lithium is renally excreted
and renal failure delays its elimination.

Methaemoglobinaemia
Oxidising agents convert haemoglobin to methaemoglobin and this
renders it incapable of carrying oxygen. Common agents causing
methaemoglobinaemia include: dapsone, sulphonamides, trimethoprim,
chlorates, aniline dyes, nitrites, nitrates and local anaesthetic including lignocaine. The onset and duration of symptoms will depend on the agent.
Nitrites cause breathlessness and flushing within minutes of exposure but
dapsone may cause a methaemoglobinaemia several hours after ingestion
but the methaemoglobinaemia may then persist for days.
Essential investigations
Patients with suspected methaemoglobinaemia should have the following
2 Arterial blood gases.
2 Full blood count (especially if dapsone has been taken due to
haemolytic anaemia).
475
2 Blood methaemoglobin concentration.
Methaemoglobin can produce a normal PO2 in the presence of reduced
oxygen saturation. Pulse oximetry measures both methaemoglobin and
oxygenated haemoglobin, so can give false results.
Methaemoglobin estimation in blood
Measurement of blood methaemoglobin is required to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of poisoning. The measurement must be
done urgently when administration of the antidote (methylene blue) is

contemplated. Samples for methaemoglobin estimation need to be
analysed as soon as possible after collection, as if left to stand around the
methaemoglobin will be falsely low owing to a reduction by endogenous
methaemoglobin reductase. The severity of symptoms correlates roughly
with the measured methaemoglobin concentrations. Anaemia, cardiac or
pulmonary disease will lead to more severe symptoms at a lower
methaemoglobin level.

If the patient has severe clinical features of toxicity or if the blood

Classic features of opioid poisoning
2 Depressed respiration.
2 Pin-point pupils.
2 Coma.
2 Signs of parenteral drug use, e.g. needlemarks.
Toxicity can be prolonged for 2448h, particularly after ingestion of
methadone, which has a long half-life. The life-saving measure is prompt
administration of adequate doses of naloxone, before waiting for results of
any investigations.

476

Adequacy of ventilation
Oxygen saturation monitoring and/or arterial blood gas analysis demonstrates the adequacy of ventilation in those whose respiration has been
inhibited.
Drug screening
Qualitative screening of the urine (group-specific immunoassay) confirms
recent use. This may not detect fentanyl derivatives, tramadol and other
synthetic opioids.
Measuring opioids in blood with gas chromatography-mass
spectroscopy
This is sometimes required for medicolegal purposes, particularly where a
fatality or a child-care issue is involved. Plasma morphine levels as high as
0.3mg/L were observed in addicts taking IV doses of heroin (diamorphine)

11 Poisoning & overdose
of 150200mg. Postmortem morphine levels in heroin overdose deaths
vary depending on prior narcotic history but in general exceed 0.3mg/L.
Following a single oral dose of 15mg of methadone, plasma concentrations
peaked at 4h at 0.075mg/L and declined slowly (t12 = 15h) until 24h when
the concentration was still 0.03mg/L. Plasma methadone concentrations in
maintenance patients increases by approximately 0.26mg/L for every
1mg/kg increase in oral dose. Deaths are due largely to reduced tolerance
and blood concentrations of 0.41.8mg/L have been found postmortem,
though live patients with tolerance exceed these values. 8.75mg/70kg IV
morphine given to adults produces mean serum concentrations of
0.44mg/L at 0.5min, with rapid decline to 0.02 mg/L by 2h. Average morphine concentrations in fatalities range from 0.2 to 2.3mg/L, depending on
tolerance.
Paracetamol screening
Opioid tablets are frequently combined with paracetamol. All unconscious
patients should therefore have a plasma paracetamol measured.

Organophosphorus insecticides
Measurement and interpretation of AChE
Measurement of red cell cholinesterase (AChE) is useful in confirmation
of exposure to organophosphorus compounds such as insecticides or
nerve warfare agents, where this is suspected, e.g. restlessness, tiredness,
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating, hypersalivation, chest
tightness, miosis, muscle weakness and fasciculation. In general, clinical
features are more helpful than red cell cholinesterase measurements in
determining the severity of intoxication and hence the prognosis. There is
a wide degree of intersubject variation in cholinesterase activity and clinical effects (see table below).
Cholinesterase activity

Clinical effects

Approx. 50% of normal

Subclinical poisoning

2050% of normal

Mild poisoning

<10% of normal

Severe poisoning

The need for treatment with cholinesterase reactivators such as pralidoxime is largely judged by the occurrence of convulsions, fasciculation,
flaccid paralysis and coma. Such features rapidly reverse within 2030min
of pralidoxime administration, together with atropine. The need for
further therapy is guided by clinical improvement, together with monitoring of cholinesterase activity. It may take 90120 days for red blood cell
cholinesterase to recover to normal values.

477

Other vital investigations
An ECG should be carried out in all organophosphorus poisoned patients,
and urea and electrolytes and glucose should also be monitored. In those
with respiratory embarrassment or muscular paralysis, frequent assessment of tidal volume/peak flow rates and oxygen saturations are essential
in anticipating the need for intubation.
OHCM p829.

Paracetamol poisoning
Overview
iiParacetamol is the commonest drug taken in overdose in the UK.
Measurement of a plasma paracetamol concentration is essential for
assessing the need for antidotal treatment within 16h of a paracetamol
overdose and should be performed urgently in all patients with known or
suspected paracetamol overdose. It can be measured by a variety of assay
methods but HPLC is less susceptible to interference than some enzymebased assays. It should also be done urgently in patients with undiagnosed
coma, or where a history is unreliable. Routine measurement of paracetamol concentrations in awake patients who deny taking paracetamol is
unnecessary. For most patients, only a single measurement of paracetamol
concentration is indicated. It is important to err on the side of caution and
to give the antidote N-acetylcysteine if the blood paracetamol concentration lies near or just below the treatment line (Fig. 11.1) as stated timing
of the overdose may be inaccurate and other agents such as opioids may
slow gastric emptying.
If N-acetylcysteine is given within 12h of the overdose, it provides complete protection against liver injury and renal failure. Beyond 12h after
ingestion the protection is less complete and assessment of liver damage is
required. Paracetamol poisoning can be deceptive, as there is a latent
phase of many hours, where the patient remains well before liver damage
develops.

478

INR/PT
The most sensitive marker of prognosis in paracetamol poisoning is the
prothrombin time (PT) or INR. This often starts to increase within 2436h
of the overdose and peaks at 4872h. Once the INR/PT starts to improve,
this is a sign that hepatotoxicity is starting to improve and the patient will
not go on to develop acute liver failure. Approximately half of patients
with a PT of 36s at 36h post-ingestion will develop acute liver failure.
Plasma alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST)
These may begin to rise as early as 12h post-ingestion but usually peak at
7296h. AST or ALT values in excess of 10,000iu/L are not unusual and a
plasma ALT>5000iu/L is very suggestive of paracetamol poisoning (Fig.
11.2). Serum bilirubin may peak after the aminotransferase and this should
not lead to concern for patients in whom the INR or PT have begun to
fall. iiDo not correct abnormalities in PT or INR with FFP or cryoprecipitate unless life-threatening bleeding is taking place, otherwise the most
sensitive marker of how the patient is progressing will be lost.

Fig. 11.1 N-acetylcysteine treatment graph. Patients whose plasma paracetamol concentrations are above the normal treatment line should be
treated with acetylcysteine by IVI (or, provided the overdose has been taken
within 1012h, with methionine by mouth). Patients on enzyme-inducing drugs
(e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, rifampicin and alcohol) or who
are malnourished (e.g. in anorexia, in alcoholism, or those who are HIV-positive) should be treated if their plasma paracetamol concentrations are above
the high-risk treatment line. Note: If paracetamol ingestion has been staggered
(over some hours) serum levels may mislead: treat regardless, if significant amounts
have been taken. Reproduced with permission from Dr Alun Hutchings and the
Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine, 5th edition, Oxford University Press.

Other blood test abnormalities in paracetamol poisoning
Hypoglycaemia and metabolic acidosis are common. Early metabolic acidosis is often associated with very high plasma paracetamol concentrations, e.g. >400mg/L. Later, development of acidosis indicates incipient

479

acute liver failure and the need to urgently check ABGs, liver function tests
and INR/PT.
Pancreatitis with 4 serum amylase has been reported. 5 cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported.
Renal failure can occur in the context of hepatic failure, but also in its
absence (in 1 in 100 patients). It is treated with N-acteylcysteine and supportive measures, e.g. haemodialysis, if needed. Full recovery with supportive care is common.
Investigating the patient who has taken a paracetamol overdose
<4h ago
Ingestion of >150mg/kg paracetamol or a paracetamol-containing product
should be recognised as a hepatotoxic dose for most people. If ingestion
of this amount or more has occurred within the last 1h, activated charcoal
should be given orally (50g for an adult). Chronic alcohol ingestion (>14
units per week for 3, >21 units per week for 9), regular use of enzymeinducing drugs (e.g. anticonvulsants) or the presence of eating disorders
have been reported to reduce the ceiling of toxicity of paracetamol to
75mg/kg.
A plasma paracetamol should then be checked at 4h from the time of
ingestion, to determine the need for N-acetylcysteine treatment from the
treatment curve (Fig. 11.1). Very rarely, e.g. after ingestion of 4  500mg
tablets by an adult, a confirmatory plasma paracetamol level is not needed,
but in general it is cheap (approx 1) and safer to be certain by checking a
blood concentration.
Investigating the patient who has taken a paracetamol overdose
between 4 and 8h ago
A plasma paracetamol level should be checked as soon as possible to
determine the need for N-acetylcysteine antidote treatment from the
treatment curve (Fig. 11.1). iiUse high-risk treatment line for patient
with induced enzymes (e.g. anticonvulsants) or glutathione depletion (e.g.
eating disorders).
Investigating the patient who has taken a paracetamol overdose
between 8 and 24h ago
Start treatment with N-acetylcysteine straight away. Take blood for a
paracetamol level, INR/PT, creatinine and plasma venous bicarbonate (if
plasma venous bicarbonate is abnormal, check arterial blood gases).
Checks results and refer to graph to determine whether treatment with
480 N-acetylcysteine needs to be continued (i.e. is the plasma level above the
treatment line?) or can be stopped (below the line). iiBeyond 16h after
ingestion the sensitivity of the assay for paracetamol may be too low to
detect a treatable levelcheck and if in doubt, treat the patient with Nacetylcysteine! On completion of N-acetylcysteine, check blood INR/PT,
creatinine and plasma venous bicarbonate (if abnormal check ABGs). If the
patient is asymptomatic and the INR or creatinine is normal or falling discontinue the N-acetylcysteine. If the patient has symptoms (abdominal
pain or vomiting) or the INR or creatinine is rising, continue maintenance
N-acetylcysteine (50mg/kg in 500mL dextrose every 4h) until the INR
improves. iiContact a poisons centre/liver unit.

11 Poisoning & overdose
Investigating the patient who has taken a paracetamol overdose
>24h ago
It is too late for plasma paracetamol level estimation to be of any value.
Start treatment with the antidote N-acetylcysteine straight away, unless a
trivial amount has been taken. Take blood for baseline INR/PT, creatinine
and venous bicarbonate (if abnormal check ABGs).
If the patient is asymptomatic and the lab tests normal, discharge the
patient and advise to return if vomiting/abdominal pain develops. If the
blood results are abnormal, phone a liver unit/poisons centre for advice.
Investigating the patient in whom the timing of overdose is
unknown
Err on the side of treating the patient with the antidote N-acetylcysteine,
checking an INR/PT, creatinine, plasma venous bicarbonate (ABGs if
abnormal) at baseline and at the end of the first full course of treatment. If
abnormal contact liver unit/poisons centre for further advice.
Investigating the patient who has taken a staggered overdose
Determine if the patient is in an at-risk group (i.e. enzyme induction or
glutathione depletion) as discussed above. If the patient is not in an at-risk
group but has ingested >150mg/kg body weight over 24h they should
receive a full course of IV N-acetylcysteine. If they are in an at-risk group
and have ingested more than 75mg/kg body weight of paracetamol over
24h, they should receive a full course of N-acetylcysteine. There is no
point measuring a plasma paracetamol level in this group of patients,
unless the substance ingested is in doubt, and a not detected result may

Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning
Features of severe poisoning
Ingestion of >150, 250 and 500mg/kg body weight of aspirin, respectively, produces mild, moderate and severe poisoning, respectively.
Signs of serious salicylate poisoning include metabolic acidosis, renal
failure and CNS effects such as agitation, confusion, coma and convulsions. Death may occur as a result of CNS depression and cardiovascular collapse.
iiThe development of metabolic acidosis is a bad prognostic sign as it
also indicates increased CSF transfer of salicylate.
Plasma salicylate concentration
Plasma salicylate should be measured urgently in all but the most trivial
overdose, i.e. all those thought to have ingested >150mg/kg of aspirin or
any amount of Oil of Wintergreen. It should be performed at 4h postingestion, because delayed absorption of the drug renders such levels
uninterpretable before this time. As salicylates form concretions in the
stomach, which delay absorption, it is recommended that a salicylate level
is rechecked 34h after the first sample, to catch the peak salicylate concentration. There is no evidence for indiscriminate requesting of salicylate
concentrations in every unconscious patient (unlike paracetamol) or in
conscious patients who deny taking aspirin and who have no features suggesting salicylate toxicity. The plasma salicylate concentration is not an
absolute guide to toxicity, as paracetamol levels are in paracetamol poisoning, but should be interpreted together with clinical features and acidbase status of the patient.
Urinary alkalinisation ( OHCM p830) is indicated for patients with salicylate concentrations of 600800mg/L in adults and 450700mg/L in children and the elderly. Metabolic alkalosis is not a contraindication to
bicarbonate therapy as patients may have high base deficit in spite of an
elevated serum pH.

482
Haemodialysis is very effective at salicylate removal and correction of
acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities. It should be considered if the
plasma salicylate levels are >700mg/L in children and >800mg/L in adults.
Other indications for haemodialysis include resistant metabolic acidosis,
severe CNS effects such as coma or convulsions, pulmonary oedema and
acute renal failure.
Arterial blood gases
Acid-base problems are common in salicylate poisoning. Respiratory
centre stimulation causes respiratory alkalosis. Uncoupled oxidative phos-

11 Poisoning & overdose
phorylation and interruption of glucose and fatty acid metabolism by salicylates often causes a concurrent metabolic acidosis. Serial ABGs are
needed in severe salicylate poisoning.

Theophylline
Acute theophylline poisoning can carry a high mortality and its management is best guided by the Shannon severity grading scheme1, bearing in
mind that delayed effects tend to occur after sustained-release formulations have been ingested. Most patients who die have grade 4 poisoning
(recurrent seizures, ventricular fibrillation, EMD arrest), sometimes grade
3 poisoning (non-repetitive seizure, sustained VT, mean arterial BP
<60mmHg and unresponsive to standard supportive therapy) toxicity with
plasma theophylline concentrations >100mg/L (770mmol/L). The adult
therapeutic range is 1020mg/L.
Urea and electrolytes
It is vital to check the plasma K+ concentration frequently, as
hypokalaemia is a life-threatening complication of theophylline overdose
and the serum K+ concentration is a useful guide to severity. If
>2.5mmol/L the patient is less severely poisoned (grade 1) than if it falls
<2.5mmol/L (grade 2)1. Check blood glucose since hyperglycaemia is a
common complication.
Arterial blood gases
In potentially serious poisoning (e.g. ingestion of >20mg/kg body weight)
ABG analysis is helpful in optimising the acid-base status of the patient. An
initial phase of hyperventilation with respiratory alkalosis can be followed
by a further stage of metabolic acidosis.
Plasma theophylline concentrations
Measuring plasma theophylline concentrations confirms theophylline
ingestion where this is in doubt and is usually undertaken by HPLC. It is
also helpful in deciding when to employ charcoal haemoperfusion in seriously poisoned patients, particularly if plasma concentrations are
>100mg/L (770mmol/L) or are rapidly rising to approach this figure.
Charcoal haemoperfusion can be considered at lower concentration, e.g.
80mg/L, in the elderly or those with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease.
Charcoal haemoperfusion can also be decided on the basis of grade 3 or 4 483
severity grading alone, especially if administration of multiple doses of activated charcoal is not possible. However, for the vast majority of poisoned
patients, obtaining a plasma theophylline concentration does not guide
their management.
Therapeutic levels rarely exceed 20mg/L (155mmol/L). Theophylline peak
concentration in plasma may occur at 13h after ingestion of a standardrelease formulation. However, overdose is often with sustained-release
products and delayed absorption can result in delayed peak plasma concentration and toxicity, often 1224h later.

Urine testing for myoglobinuria & measuring serum creatine
kinase
Theophylline poisoning can be accompanied by rhabdomyolysis. Hence
the urine should be dipsticked and if found positive for blood a serum CK
should be obtained. This will then indicate that renal function should be
closely monitored and the urine should undergo alkalinisation.

Tricyclic antidepressants
The main risks of overdose with these drugs are CVS and CNS toxicity.
ECG
An ECG should be performed in all but the most trivial cases of overdose.
ECG abnormalities are common in moderatesevere poisoning and
include
2 QRS prolongation: >110ms in adults predicts the risk of ventricular
cardiac arrhythmias (and the need for IV sodium bicarbonate) and QRS
>160ms predicts the risk of fits. In children a QRS >110ms is
predictive of the risk of arrhythmias but not fits.
2 Note: ECG criteria are not the only factors assessing risk of arrhythmias, fits and acidosiselectrolyte disturbances contribute.
Supraventricular and potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias can occur.

Cardiac monitoring
This is essential if ingestion of >10mg/kg body weight has taken place. It is
seldom necessary beyond 24h after ingestion.
Arterial blood gas analyses
These should be done on all patients with marked symptoms and signs,
particularly those with a reduced Glasgow coma score. It should also be
performed on those with widened QRS or seizures, not least because
such patients are receiving intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy and a
pH of 7.5 should not be exceeded.
Plasma concentrations
This is of no value as plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants
correlate poorly with clinical features of toxicity.

The ESR is an indirect measure of acute phase protein concentration;
when 4 it causes red cell rouleaux formation and results in a faster
(higher) ESR. ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP) are both non-specific
guides to inflammatory activity, e.g. in RA and SLE. Normally ESR is
<20mm/h and CRP is <10mg/L.
A normal ESR generally excludes active inflammation. A falsely 5 ESR can
occur in sickle cell disease, anisocytosis, spherocytosis, polycythaemia and
heart failure. A falsely 4 ESR can result from prolonged blood storage or a
measurement error. ESR and CRP levels may be inappropriately 5 in some
patients (e.g. seronegative arthritis and SLE, respectively) and are not infallible markers of inflammation.
Liver synthesis of acute phase proteins changes in response to inflammation. Some proteins increase whilst others decrease. Those whose levels
fall are albumin, pre-albumin and transferrin.
An increased synthesis usually occurs rapidly (within hours) but varies in

488 degree. Both C3 and caeruloplasmin increase only a little, whereas others

such as fibrinogen and 1-antitrypsin increase two- to fourfold, and CRP
and serum amyloid A (SAA) protein increase several hundredfold.
Biochemistry
Diagnostically useful plasma biochemistry includes
2 Uric acid, which may be 4 in gout.
2 Urea and creatinine levels, which may 4 when there is renal
involvement.

Alkaline phosphatase and other tests of liver function, which may be
altered as a result of drug therapy with, for example, methotrexate.

Immunology
A number of markers of immune system function (e.g. antibodies, complement) that may be associated with specific diseases or disease groups can
be measured. Autoantibodies and complement tests are discussed here
because they are reliable and are commonly carried out ( Immunology
investigations p241).
Autoantibodies
Autoantibodies bind to a wide spectrum of antigens but their pathogenic
relationship to disease has not been determined in most cases. The presence of autoantibodies may be used clinically:
2 To confirm a diagnosis, e.g. rheumatoid factor (RF ) may confirm a diagnosis of RA.
2 Point to a diagnosis, e.g. antinuclear antibody (ANA ) may indicate a diagnosis of SLE.
2 To forecast disease, e.g. anticentromere antibodies are associated with
the development of systemic sclerosis.
2 To indicate an exacerbation of disease, e.g. anti-DNA is associated with an
exacerbation of SLE.
2 To suggest early treatment, e.g. coexistence of RF and reduced
immunoglobulin G (IgG) galactosylation in RA is associated with severe
disease later.
RFs are autoantibodies against antigenic determinants on the Fc
fragment of IgG. They may be IgM, IgG or IgA.
RF tests are also positive in:

regulation.

ANAs bind to cell nuclear components (DNA and RNA). Immuno-

fluorescent cell staining is a useful screening test for them, and their
specificity can be further defined by testing for the antibodies referred
to below.

The pattern of ANA immunofluorescence is valuable diagnostically, but is
not as specific as identification of a specific antigenantibody reaction.
Five patterns of immunofluorescent are commonly recognised:
homogeneous, peripheral, speckled, nucleolar and centromere.
2 A homogeneous pattern (antibody to nuclear protein) and a peripheral
pattern (antibody to DNA) are features of SLE.
2 A speckled pattern (antibody to extractable nuclear antigens, e.g.
ribonuclear protein) is seen in SLE, RA, systemic sclerosis and Sjgrens
490 2 syndrome.
A nucleolar pattern (antibody to nuclear RNA) is most common in systemic sclerosis.
2 A centromere pattern is seen in limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis.
ANA testing may also be +ve, usually of low titre, in <20% of patients with
chronic active hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis or lepromatous
leprosy.

12 Rheumatology
Complement
Total haemolytic complement, C3 and C4, are the factors usually measured to assess complement levels.
The main indication for these measurements is to diagnose SLE where
immune complex activation of the classical pathway is thought to cause a
reduction in these components. A genetic deficiency of the protein C2 is
associated with SLE.

Arthrocentesis
Arthrocentesis or joint puncture is safe and easy to perform.
Indications
2 To diagnose the cause of a joint effusion, particularly if there is a
monoarthritis, which could be due to infection.
2 To relieve pain by draining an effusion and injecting corticosteroids
and/or local anaesthetic.
Complications
Infection.
Worsening symptoms.

2 Viscosity.
Investigations when appropriate include
White cell count.
Gram stain, acid-fast methods and culture for bacteria (including
Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and fungi (synovial fluid culture in suspected
infectious arthritis should be accompanied by sputum, blood, urine and
faecal cultures to detect a further source of infection).
2 Crystal identification (using compensated polarised light microscopy to
detect urate and calcium pyrophosphate).

Synovial biopsy may be necessary to detect M. tuberculosis, and EMU cultures are useful for suspected renal tuberculosis.

491

Diagnostic imaging
Diagnostic imaging is often necessary to allow an accurate diagnosis in
rheumatology, and some techniques are more appropriate than others for
certain disorders.
Plain radiographs
Radiographs are the first and usually only imaging test needed to investigate arthritis. They can demonstrate changes occurring in all components
of the joint, and characteristic changes are seen, for example, in OA, RA
and AS. Serial radiographs can be useful as they will document disease
progression.
Ultrasonography
Ultrasound is a useful non-invasive technique especially for distinguishing
synovial cysts (e.g. popliteal cyst) from solid tissue and in the examination
of tendons (e.g. rotator cuff and biceps).
Computed tomography
Computed tomography (CT) is useful for visualising cross-sectional
anatomy of calcified tissue (e.g. cortical and trabecular bone) and may be
used to create a three-dimensional image.
Magnetic resonance imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable imaging tool. It works by
detecting hydrogen ion mobility when tissues are subjected to pulsed
radiowaves and a strong magnetic field causes them to emit a transient
signal, which can be identified in space and time. The magnetic fields are
known by their relaxation times, T1 and T2, which are characteristics of
the tissues being measured and have to do with the rate at which energy
is released by the magnetised tissue through which the pulse is passed.
MR imaging is especially useful for visualising organs in which there are
contrasts of tissues (e.g. the spinal cord). Different tissues have specific
hydrogen ion mobility in a magnetic field. Cortical bone contains virtually
no mobile hydrogen ions and gives a very low signal intensity, whereas fat
has a high signal intensity. Cortical bone is therefore better evaluated by
radiographs or CT.
MRI of the musculoskeletal system has been most useful for viewing the
spinal cord, intervertebral discs, hip joints and knee joints, and offers significant potential as it allows three-dimensional imaging and multiple plane
examination.

Skeletal scintigraphy
The typical radionuclide scan uses 99mtechnetium methylene diphospho492 nate complexes to detect physiological changes in the bone in contrast to
the anatomical changes depicted by plain radiographs and MRI.
An increased uptake of the isotope into the bone can result from many
causes including infection, tumour, fractures and synovitis. This type of
scanning is therefore non-specific and needs to be correlated with
radiographs and clinical findings. It is useful when clinical symptoms and
radiographs have proved inconclusive.

12 Rheumatology
67Gallium citrate and 111indium scans can be used to define sites of infection in bones and soft tissues, which appear as areas of increased uptake.

Single proton emission CT (SPECT), which provides cross-section imaging
in skeletal scintigraphy, and positron emission tomography (PET) are more
sensitive techniques, but have limited availability.

Arthroscopy
Arthroscopy is useful both diagnostically and therapeutically. Unlike
needle biopsy, it allows a direct view of the joint and synovial fluid, and
biopsy samples can be taken from multiple sites within the joint.
The joint most commonly examined by arthroscopy is the knee. The technique is often used to investigate trauma (e.g. sport injury). Most arthroscopies are carried out as day cases; the anaesthetic depending on the
extent of the procedure.
Histopathology
It may sometimes be necessary to take an organ biopsy to help make a
diagnosis, e.g.
2 Synovial membrane and bone biopsy in suspected infection.
2 Kidney biopsy in suspected SLE .
2 Liver biopsy in suspected iatrogenic and autoimmune liver disease.
2 Lung biopsy in suspected Wegeners granulomatosis.

Radiology & the role of imaging
The effective use of the radiology department relies on good communication between radiologists and their clinical colleagues. The overall aim
must be to target investigations efficiently in order to provide answers to
clinical dilemmas at minimal cost and radiation dose. The investigation of
neurological problems has been transformed by the advent of CT and MRI,
but these are not always locally available and CT in particular can add considerably to the radiation burden. Conversely, if a CT is likely to provide
the best answer and minimise overall costs by resulting in an early discharge then it should be the investigation of choice. It is helpful to consider plain films, contrast studies, ultrasound and then CT/MRI as a
hierarchy where plain films are requested as an initial investigation. This
hierarchy may be circumvented if a more expensive investigation is likely
to produce the definitive result. The following are important points to
consider:
1. Will the investigation alter patient management? I.e. is the expected
outcome clinically relevant? Do you need it?
2. Investigating too often or repeating investigations before there has
been an adequate lapse of time to allow resolution or to allow treatment to take effect. Do I need it now?
3. Would an investigation that does not use ionising radiation be more
appropriate, e.g. USS/MRI?
4. Failure to provide accurate clinical information and questions that you
are hoping will be answered by the investigation may result in an unsatisfactory outcome. Have I explained the problem?
5. Would another technique be more appropriate? The advances in radiology mean that discussion with a radiologist may be helpful in determining the best possible test.
6. Overinvestigating: are you taking comfort in too many tests or providing
reassurance to the patient in this way?

Plain x-rays
Wilhelm Roentgen discovered x-rays in 1895. X-rays form part of the
electromagnetic spectrum with microwaves and radiowaves lying at the
low energy end, visible light in the middle and x-rays at the high energy
end. They are energetic enough to ionise atoms and break molecular
bonds as they penetrate tissues, and are therefore called ionising radiation. Diagnostic x-rays are produced when high energy electrons strike a
high atomic number material. This interaction is produced within an xray tube. A high voltage is passed across two tungsten terminals. One
terminal (cathode) is heated until it liberates free electrons. When a high
voltage is applied across the terminals the electrons accelerate towards
the anode at high speed. On hitting the anode target x-rays are
produced.
The x-ray picture is a result of the interaction of the ionising radiation with
tissues as it passes through the body. Tissues of different densities are displayed as distinct areas depending on the amount of radiation absorbed.
There are 4 basic densities in conventional radiography: gas (air); fat; soft
tissue and fluid; and calcified structures. Air absorbs the least amount of
x-rays and therefore appears black on the radiograph, whereas calcified
structures and bone absorb the most, resulting in a white density. Soft
tissues and fluid have a similar absorptive capacity and therefore appear
grey on a radiograph.

Digital radiology
X-ray film is exposed by light photons emitted by intensifying screens sensitive to radiation transmitted through the patient. Storage phosphor technology uses photo-stimulable phosphor screens to convert x-ray energy
directly into digital signals. The increased dynamic range and image contrast of digital radiography compared with conventional film screen combinations and the facility to manipulate signal intensity after image capture
reduce the number of repeat exposures. This increases efficiency and minimises patient radiation dose. Digital images can be made available on a
local network for reporting by a radiologist or for review on a ward-based
computer. Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are efficient at image production and manipulation and in the storage, retrieval
and transmission of data. Initial costs are high and at present are limited to
a few centres in the UK.

Chest x-ray: useful landmarks
In order to interpret a plain PA or lateral CXR some knowledge of chest
anatomy and the major landmarks on the film is required. We have high-

497

lighted the major bony and soft tissue structures visible on the plain film in
order to make it easier to spot abnormalities.

Chest radiograph
The chest film is the most widely requested, yet most easy to misinterpret, investigation. Using a logical approach will avoid most pitfalls.
Initially assess technical quality
Projection
PA vs. AP will determine whether assessment of cardiac size is reliable.

13 Radiology
Posture
Erect films enable a more accurate assessment of the mediastinum since
the lungs are more expanded, and allow detection of airfluid levels,
pleural thickening and comment on the size of pulmonary vasculature.
Rotation
Look for the relationship of the medial ends of the clavicles to spinous
process at the same level; a common cause of unilateral transradiancy is
rotation.
Degree of inspiration
Ideally 6 ribs should be seen anteriorly, and 10 ribs posteriorly. If more,
this suggests hyperinflation (does the patient have asthma or COPD?). If
less (e.g. poor inspiratory effort, obesity or restrictive chest disorders)
there will be apparent cardiomegaly, increased basal shadowing and less
commonly tracheal deviation.
The heart and mediastinum
Sequentially consider the heart, mediastinum, lungs, diaphragms, soft
tissues (breast shadows) and bones. Remember to assess your review
areas: the lung apices, behind the heart, under the diaphragm and the
costophrenic angles.
Diaphragm: this should lie between the 5th to 7th ribs. If flattened,
consider hyperinflation. In 90% of cases the right is higher than the left
by 34 cm. Effacement of the interface between lung and diaphragm
suggests pleural or pulmonary pathology. Loss of smooth contour
suggests localised herniation (eventration). Peaks laterally may be due
to subpulmonary effusion.
Root of neck and trachea: the upper trachea is central with slight
displacement to the right inferiorly due to the oesophagus. Thickening
of the paratracheal line (>5mm) may imply nodal enlargement.
Mediastinum: the mediastinum should be central. The heart is normally
<50% of thoracic width. Mediastinal enlargement or widening is a nonspecific finding. The silhouette sign may help but a lateral film is helpful
for localisation. Based on location of mediastinal abnormality, possible
pathologies include:
2 Superior mediastinum: thymoma, retrosternal thyroid and lymphoma.
2 Anterior mediastinum: lymphoma (HD & NHL ), germ cell tumours,
thymoma, retrosternal goitres and Morgagni hernias (low).
2 Middle mediastinum: aortic aneurysm, bronchial carcinoma, foregut
duplication cysts (including bronchogenic/oesophageal) and hiatus
hernia.
Posterior mediastinum: neurogenic tumours, Bochdalek hernia, dilated
oesophagus or aorta.
Enlarged lymph nodes: may be seen in any compartment.
Hila: density should be equal, left is higher than the right by 515 mm. If
more disparity consider elevation due to fibrosis (e.g. TB, radiotherapy)
or depression by lobar or segmental collapse. Hilar enlargement may be

501

vascular (e.g. pulmonary arterial or venous hypertension) or due to
lymphadenopathy (e.g. sarcoidosis, lymphoma or TB). Hilar calcification
is seen in silicosis, sarcoidosis and treated lymphoma.

Lung disease
Lung opacities may be subdivided into several basic patterns.
Alveolar (air space) shadowingill-defined, non-segmental and with air
bronchograms. Large variety of causes:
2 Fluid7pulmonary oedema (cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic).
2 Fat7fat embolism.
2 Haemorrhage7trauma, coagulopathies, pulmonary haemosiderosis.
2 Cells7pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, sarcoidosis, alveolar cell carcinoma and infection (bacterial, fungal and viral).
Reticular (linear opacities)-associated obscuration of vessels and late
appearance of chest x-ray signs:
2 Collagen disorders.
2 Extrinsic allergic alveolitis.
2 Sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis.
2 Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.
2 Early left ventricular failure (LVF ).
2 Malignancy (lymphangitis carcinomatosis).
Nodular shadows: characterise according to their size and distribution:
2 If solitary exclude tumour.
2 Multiple:
 Granulomas (TB, histoplasmosis, hydatid).
 Immunological (Wegeners, rheumatoid arthritis).
502
 Vascular (arteriovenous malformations).
 Inhalational (PMF, Caplans syndrome).

13 Radiology

Patterns of lobar collapse
Lobar collapse may be complete or incomplete. The commonest cause is
obstruction of a central bronchus. The primary signs are opacification due
to lack of aeration and displacement of the interlobar fissures.
Secondary signs include
Elevation of the hemi-diaphragm (more prominent in lower lobe
atelectasis than upper).
2 Mediastinal displacement (tracheal displacement with upper lobe and
cardiac displacement with lower lobe atelectasis).
2 Hilar displacement: more prominent with upper lobe atelectasis than
lower.
2 Crowded vessels in the affected lobe.
2 Compensatory hyperinflation of remaining lung.

Barium studies
Barium suspension is made up of small particles of barium sulphate in a
solution. Due to its high atomic number it is highly visible on x-rays. The
constituents of individual suspensions vary depending on the part of the GI
tract being examined. The particles are coated to improve flow and aid
mucosal adhesion. When made up it comprises a chalky (sometimes
unpalatable!) suspension. Advantages include low cost, easy availability and
good assessment of mucosal surface.
Risks are more common in the context of
2 Perforation: if leakage occurs into the peritoneal cavity it can produce
pain and hypovolaemic shock (50% mortality). Long-term sequelae
include peritoneal adhesions.
2 Aspiration: in small amounts unlikely to have any clinical significance but
if pre-existing respiratory impairment or aspiration of larger amounts (i.e.
more than a few mouthfuls) the patient will need physiotherapy.
2 Obscuration: CT examination in the presence of a recent barium
examination will result in a poorly diagnostic study as high density
barium results in streak artefacts.
2 Barium impaction: rarely may exacerbate obstruction if barium collects and is concentrated above a point of obstruction.
Water-soluble contrast media
These are more expensive and provide inferior coating and contrast. They
include iodinated agents gastromiro and gastrograffin. Indications for their
use include:
2 Suspected perforation especially into the peritoneal cavity.
2 Meconium ileus.
2 To opacify bowel during CT examinations.
Risks include pulmonary oedema if aspirated and hypovolaemia, especially
in children. Both are a result of hyperosmolar effects. If aspiration is likely

505

Barium swallow
Plain films do not usually demonstrate the oesophagus unless it is very distended, e.g. achalasia. They may be useful in identifying an opaque foreign
body within the lumen. The barium swallow is the usual contrast examination to visualise the oesophagus. Rapid sequence films are taken with a fluoroscopy unit while the patient swallows barium (usually in the erect
position). Films are taken in an AP and oblique projection (to throw the
oesophagus clear of the spine) with the oesophagus distended with
barium (to demonstrate its outline) and empty to show the mucosal folds.
Normal anatomy
The oesophagus commences at C5/6. There are normal indentations on
its outline by the cricoid cartilage, the aortic arch, left main bronchus and
left heart.
Indications
These include the assessment of dysphagia, pain, reflux disease, tracheooesophageal fistulae (in children) and post-operative assessment where
there has been gastric or oesophageal surgery.
Contraindications
No absolute contraindications exist, but in all barium studies the quality of
the study relies heavily on patient cooperation and therefore immobile
patients who are unable to weight bear may only be suitable for limited
studies. The post-operative oesophagus is usually assessed with gastromiro or a non-ionic contrast.
Common disorders and patterns
Diverticulae: these include pharyngeal pouches (a midline diverticulum),
traction diverticulae (due to adhesions) or pseudodiverticulae; dilated
mucous glands seen in reflux or infective oesophagitis.
Luminal narrowing: strictures may be benign (e.g. oesophagitis, shown in
Fig. 13.12a, scleroderma, pemphigus, corrosives or infection) or malignant.
Webs: seen with skin lesions, e.g. epidermolysis or pemphigus, graftversus-host disease and the Plummer Vinson syndrome.
Mega-oesophagus: can be with associated obstruction as in malignant
strictures or without as in achalasia, diabetic neuropathy or Chagas'
disease (Fig. 13.12bd).
Ulceration/oesophagitis: may be due to gastro-oesophageal reflux
disease, infection, corrosives or iatrogenic. Findings include lack of
distensibility, fold thickening and mucosal irregularity.
Oesophageal tears: spontaneous, neoplastic, post-traumatic, iatrogenic
and following prolonged emesis. Look for pneumomediastinum, left
pleural effusion and features of mediastinitis.
506 Filling defects: foreign bodies, varices (proximal due to SVC
obstruction), distal (in association with portal hypertension), neoplasms
which may be benign as in leiomyoma or malignant. Most commonly
squamous cell carcinoma (95%).
Fold thickening: may be due to oesophagitis, varices or infiltration by
lymphoma.
Air/fluid level: commonest in hiatal hernias but also seen with a
pharyngeal pouch.

Barium meal
About 200mL of a high density (250% weight/volume), low viscosity barium
is used for a double contrast study which gives good coating without obscuration of mucosal detail. An effervescent agent is given to provide adequate
luminal distension. The gastric mucosa is characterised by rugae (parallel to
the long axis, 35mm thick) and area gastricae (nodular elevations 23mm
wide). The patient is fasted for about 6h to avoid food residue which may
cause diagnostic uncertainty. The techniques for coating the stomach and
projections are variable. A smooth muscle relaxant may be given as part of
the routine, particularly to assess the pylorus and duodenum.
Indications
Dyspepsia, weight loss, abdominal masses, iron deficiency anaemia of
uncertain cause, partial outlet obstruction and previous GI haemorrhage.
Contraindications
Complete large bowel obstruction.
Abnormal findings
Filling defects: these may be intrinsic or extrinsic. Carcinoma remains
the commonest cause of a filling defect in an adult (irregular,
shouldered with overhanging edges). If there is antral involvement there
may be associated outlet obstruction. Diffuse mucosal thickening and
failure to distend is seen with linitis plastica. Other causes include
gastric lymphoma, polyps (histology difficult to predict) and bezoars.

and metastases. Extrinsic indentation by pancreatic tumours or an
enlarged spleen may cause an apparent filling defect.
Fold thickening (>5mm) is seen in association with hypersecretion states
such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastritis and Crohns disease. It may
also be secondary to infiltration by carcinomas, lymphomas or
eosinophilia.
Outlet obstruction may be diagnosed by failure of the stomach to empty
<50% of the barium ingested at 4h. This may be seen in carcinomas but
also by scarring caused by chronic duodenal ulceration.
Hiatal hernia: herniation of the stomach into the chest occurs via the
oesophageal hiatus in the diaphragm. There are two types: in a sliding
hernia (more common) there is incompetence of the sphincter at the
cardia, often associated with reflux. Other sequelae include oesophagitis,
ulceration or stricture. In a rolling hernia the fundus herniates through the
diaphragm but the gastro-oesophageal junction remains competent.
Gastritis and ulceration: gastritis is characterised by small shallow barium
pools with surrounding lucent rings due to oedema. There are features
which may be used to distinguish benign from malignant ulcers on barium
studies. Ulcers are seen either as a crater or as a projection from the
luminal surface. Benign ulcers are commonly seen on the lesser curve
with smooth radiating folds which reach the edge of the ulcer crater.
Malignant lesions may have an associated mass, have a shallow crater and
an irregular contour. With the ease of availability of endoscopy, the use
of barium meals in diagnosing ulceration has declined. Endoscopy has the
advantage of being able to diagnose gastritis more accurately, assess ulcer
healing, make a histological diagnosis and more accurately assess the
post-operative stomach. However, early assessment of the postoperative stomach is radiologically performed to exclude complications
508 such as anastomotic leaks. A water-soluble contrast agent is preferred in
the early post-operative phase.

Small intestine
Small bowel follow-through: the patient drinks 200300mL of barium
(with metoclopramide to speed transit time). The single contrast

13 Radiology
column is followed by films at regular intervals until the barium reaches
the colon. Transit time is variable but the entire process may take 16h
depending on adequacy of bowel preparation. Films are taken at
intervals of approximately 20min initially, in the prone position which
aids separation of the loops. When the barium reaches the caecum spot
views of the terminal ileum are taken.
Small bowel enema (enteroclysis): this technique provides better
demonstration and mucosal detail, as there is rapid infusion of a
continuous column of barium directly into the jejunum. Methyl cellulose
is administered following the barium to provide double contrast. This is
achieved via a weighted nasogastric tube which is positioned at, or distal
to, the duodendojejunal (DJ) flexure. Disadvantages include poor patient
tolerance (related to intubation) and a relatively high screening dose.
Both techniques require the patient to be on a low residue diet beforehand.
Indications
The indications are the same for both techniques and include pain, diarrhoea, bleeding, partial obstruction, malabsorption, overgrowth syndromes, assessment of Crohns disease activity and extent, and suspected
masses. The small bowel enema may be preferred for assessment of
recurrent Crohns disease or complex post-operative problems but the
small bowel follow-through is otherwise routinely used.
Contraindications
Complete obstruction and suspected perforation.
Normal findings
The small intestine measures ~5m and extends from the DJ flexure to the
ileocaecal valve. The proximal two-fifths is the jejunum, the distal three- fifths
is the ileum. Normal calibre is 3.5cm for the jejunum and 2.5cm for the ileum
(up to 1cm more on enteroclysis). The valvulae conniventes are circular in
configuration and ~2mm thick in the jejunum and 1mm thick in the ileum.
Abnormal findings
Dilatation is indicative of malabsorption, small bowel obstruction (SBO)
or paralytic ileus. There may be accompanying effacement of the
mucosal pattern. When seen with fold thickening it may be due to
Crohns, ischaemia or radiotherapy. Mucosal thickening may be due to
infiltration by lymphoma or eosinophilia, adhesions, ischaemia or
radiotherapy.
Strictures are seen in Crohns disease and in lymphoma. There is usually 509
dilatation of the bowel proximally. Crohns disease causes skip lesions,
ulceration, strictures of variable length and a high incidence of terminal
ileal involvement. There may be associated ulceration, fold thickening
and fistulation.
Malabsorption: radiological investigation may reveal an underlying
structural abnormality. The findings in malabsorption include dilatation,
fold thickening and flocculation of barium.

Fig. 13.14 Small bowel enema (enteroclysis).

Cholangiography
Oral cholangiograms (OCGs) were used as first line investigations when
the clinical history suggested non-acute gallbladder disease. Ultrasound
has largely replaced it for the initial diagnosis of gallstones but OCG
remains superior in assessing the number and size of gallstones, cystic duct
patency and gallbladder function. The contrast is administered 14h prior
to the study. Failure to visualise the gallbladder may be indicative of
pathology if contrast has been taken and absorbed. The examination is
contraindicated in acute cholecystitis and is unlikely to be successful when
the serum bilirubin is >34mol/L (as the contrast media is excreted by the
liver, normal hepatocyte function is required for adequate elimination).
Intravenous cholangiography
This is rarely performed but may be useful in patients with biliary symptoms post-cholecystectomy or with a non-functional gallbladder. It is contraindicated in the presence of severe hepatorenal disease, as the side
effects related to the contrast media are considerable.
ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)

The biliary and pancreatic ducts are directly filled with contrast following
endoscopic cannulation and during x-ray screening. This has both a diagnostic and therapeutic role. It is particularly of value in the demonstration
of ampullary lesions and to delineate the level of biliary tree obstruction in
patients with obstructive jaundice. It allows sphincterotomy to be performed to facilitate the passage of stones lodged in the common bile duct.
PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography)
The biliary tree is directly injected with contrast following percutaneous
puncture of the liver. This is both diagnostic in defining a level of obstrucand therapeutic in biliary duct obstruction, as it may be used as a pre510 tion
cursor to a biliary drainage procedure or prior to insertion of a stent.
Contraindications include bleeding diatheses and ascites.

Other cholangiographic techniques
2 Per-operative cholangiogram in which the common bile duct (CBD ) is
filled with contrast during cholecystectomy to exclude the presence of
CBD stones.

T-tube cholangiogram: after operative exploration a T-tube is left in
the CBD for a post-operative contrast study to exclude the presence
of retained stones.
MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography): this is a noninvasive, relatively new technique where heavily T2-weighted images
are obtained without contrast administration. The bile acts as an
intrinsic contrast agent and stones are visualised as filling defects. The
accuracy of this technique remains to be fully verified and it may
replace the need for diagnostic ERCP although clearly not therapeutic
ERCP.

Fig. 13.16 MRCP (correlate with PTC images in same patient).

Barium enema
This is the technique of choice for evaluation of the large bowel. Barium is
run into the colon under gravity via a tube inserted into the rectum. The
column of barium is followed by air to achieve double contrast. Buscopan
(a smooth muscle relaxant) may be given to minimise spasm and optimise

511

mucosal relief. Bowel preparation prior to the examination (low residue
diet and aperients) is vital to ensure that there is no faecal material which
may mask mucosal abnormalities or be mistaken for small polyps.
Remember the examination is uncomfortable and requires reasonably
good patient cooperation and mobility. iDo not request this in frail or
elderly patients unless there is a good clinical indication. A rectal examination
or sigmoidoscopy is essential to avoid abnormalities being missed.
Single vs. double contrast
If evaluation of the colonic mucosa is not the primary aim then a single
contrast technique will suffice. This is applicable in children, where the
patient is uncooperative and where gross pathology is being excluded, and
in the evaluation of obstruction/volvulus or in the reduction of an intussusception.
Indications
Change in bowel habit, iron deficiency anaemia, abdominal pain, palpable
mass of suspected colonic origin, and weight loss of unknown cause.
Contraindications
Recent rectal biopsy, toxic megacolon or pseudo-membranous colitis.
Common findings
Solitary filling defect: polyps are classified according to histology. The
commonest are hyperplastic (no malignant potential, adenomatous
polyps are premalignant with the risk of malignancy increasing with size
(<5mm = 0%, >2cm = 2040%). Also found are adenocarcinoma
(increased risk in ulcerative colitis, polyposis syndromes, villous
adenoma), and less commonly metastases and lymphoma.
Multiple filling defects: polyps (polyposis syndromes or postinflammatory pseudopolyps), pneumatosis coli, metastases and
lymphoma.
Ulceration: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ischaemia, infection,
radiation and neoplasia.
Colonic narrowing: neoplasms (apple core lesion), metastases,
lymphoma, diverticular disease, IBD, ischaemia and radiation.
Dilatation: mechanical, e.g. proximal to neoplasm, volvulus or nonmechanical, post-operative ileus, metabolic and toxic megacolon.
Diminished haustration: cathartic colon, IBD and scleroderma.
Increased haustration
neoplasm and IBD.

Widening of the pre-sacral space (>1.5cm at S2): normal in up to 40%
but also seen in association with IBD, neoplasms, infection and

512 Colonoscopy
Remains a complementary technique and has the advantage of being both
therapeutic and diagnostic (e.g. biopsy, polypectomy, etc.). In elderly
patients CT with prior bowel preparation and air insufflation is less invasive and less arduous. CT colonoscopy (using 3D reconstruction of CT
images and software to simulate navigation of the inside of the colon) is
currently being evaluated.

13 Radiology

Plain abdominal x-ray (AXR)
The standard plain film is a supine AXR. Erect views have largely been
superseded and in the acute setting have been replaced by the erect chest 513
to show free subphrenic air. Furthermore, chest diseases such as myocardial infarction or pneumonia may simulate an acute abdomen. If there is
doubt regarding the presence of a pneumoperitoneum, consider a lateral
decubitus film (displays as little as 1mL of air).
Indications
Suspected obstruction, perforation, renal colic and toxic megacolon.

Contraindications
None but where abdominal pain is non-specific and not attributable to the
conditions listed above, an AXR is unlikely to be helpful.
Interpretation of the plain AXR
A normal patient will have variable amounts of gas in the stomach, small
bowel and colon. You can identify the stomach, as it lies above the transverse colon, has an air/fluid level in the erect view and has rugae in its
lumen. Large bowel calibre is variable; 5.5cm is considered the upper limit
for the transverse colon in toxic megacolon and 9cm for the caecum in
obstruction. Short fluid levels are normal. Fluid levels are abnormal when
seen in dilated bowel or if numerous. If the bowel is dilated distinguish
between small and large bowel by the features listed below.

Causes of bowel dilatation include mechanical obstruction, paralytic ileus
or a localised peritonitis (meteorism), e.g. adjacent to pancreatitis or
appendicitis.
Look for extraluminal gas
Gas in the peritoneal cavity: look for air under the hemidiaphragm,
outlining the falciform ligament or both sides of the bowel wall (Riglers
sign). If there is any doubt consider a lateral decubitus film. Causes
include perforation (ulcer, neoplasm), post-operative, following
peritoneal dialysis or tracking down from the mediastinum.
Air in the biliary tree: following sphincterotomy, gallstone ileus or
following anastomosis of CBD to bowel.
Portal vein gas: pre-morbid sign in the context of bowel infarction but
less sinister in neonates with NEC (necrotising enterocolitis) or
following umbilical catheterisation.
Gas in an abscess: look for displacement of adjacent bowel and an
air/fluid level.
Other causes include air in the urinary tract, necrotic tumours and
retroperitoneal gas.
Look for any soft tissue masses or ascites: the latter is detectable on plain

514 films if gross. There will be displacement of the ascending and descending
colon from the side walls with loops of small bowel seen centrally.
Look for abdominal or pelvic calcification: first localise the site. This may
require another view. The vast majority are clinically insignificant, i.e.
vascular calcification, pelvic phleboliths and calcified mesenteric nodes.
In the abdomen there may be pancreatic calcification (chronic
pancreatitis) or hepatic calcification (old granulomas, abscesses or less
commonly hepatomas and metastases from mucinous primaries).

13 Radiology
Gallstones are less commonly calcified and may contain central lucency
(e.g. Mercedes Benz sign), while renal and ureteric calculi commonly
calcify. Renal tumours and cysts rarely calcify and more widespread
renal calcifications may be seen in nephrocalcinosis due to a wide
variety of causes. In the pelvis, ovarian calcification (less common with
malignant masses and seen more often in association with benign
pathologies such as dermoids) is uncommon whilst uterine calcifications
due to fibroids commonly occur. Bladder wall calcifications may be seen
with bladder tumours, TB and schistosomiasis. Prostatic calculi and
calcifications are common and of no significance. Vas deferens
calcifications are seen in patients with diabetes.
Soft tissues: look at renal outlines (normally smooth and parallel to
psoas, should be between 23 vertebral bodies). Absence of psoas
margins may indicate retroperitoneal disease and haemorrhage.
Bones of the pelvis and lumbar spine: look for osteoarthritis, metabolic
bone disease (hyperparathyroidism, sickle cell anaemia), the rugger
jersey spine of osteomalacia and Pagets disease ( Lumbar spine &
pelvis (p526, 528)). Bony metastases may be lytic or sclerotic.

Fig. 13.19 Plain AXR showing evidence of
small bowel obstruction.

Radiology of the urinary tract
Plain abdominal film
Look for any urinary tract calcification: 90% stones are radio-opaque.
Other causes include hyperparathyroidism, medullary sponge kidney
and renal tubular acidosis.

than the right.
Assess bones of spine and sacrum for bony metastases or spina bifida

IVU

This provides a good overview of the urinary tract and in particular the
pelvicalyceal anatomy. Fluid restriction and laxatives are no longer necessary and in particular the former is to be avoided in diabetics, renal failure
and myeloma. Following the preliminary plain film, 300mg/kg of contrast
media is injected IV. The film sequence is varied according to the clinical
scenario. An immediate film shows the nephrogram phase and displays the
renal outlines. An increasingly dense delayed nephrogram is seen in acute
obstruction, acute hypotension, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and renal
vein thrombosis. A faint persistent nephrogram is seen with acute
glomerulonephritis and it may be delayed in renal artery stenosis (RAS).
Later films show the pelvicalyceal systems (pyelogram), ureters and
bladder.
Common abnormalities
Loss of renal outline: congenital absence, ectopic kidney, tumour,
abscess or post-nephrectomy (look for absent 12th rib).
Small kidney (unilateral): ischaemia (RAS), radiation or congenital
hypoplasia.
Small kidney (bilateral): atheroma, papillary necrosis or glomerulonephritis.
Large kidney (unilateral): duplex, acute pyelonephritis, tumour or hydronephrosis.
Large kidney (bilateral): polycystic kidneys and infiltrative disease such
as myeloma, amyloid and lymphoma.
Pelvicalyceal filling defect: smoothly marginated (clot, papilloma),
irregular margins (tumour, e.g. renal cell or transitional carcinoma),
intraluminal (sloughed papilla, calculus or clot), extrinsic (vascular
impression or cyst), irregular renal outline (scarring, e.g. in ischaemia,
TB, pyelonephritis or reflux nephropathy).
Ultrasound
May be used as an alternative or complementary examination with the IVU
and may be used to:
2 Demonstrate or exclude hydronephrosis especially in acute renal
failure (ARF).
2 Evaluate renal tumours, cysts and abscesses.
2 Follow-up of transplant kidneys and chronic renal disease.
2 Assess renal blood flow using Doppler.
2 Serial scanning in children with recurrent urinary tract infections.
2 Assess bladder morphology and volume, and the prostate.
2 Provide guidance for interventional techniques, e.g. renal biopsy and
nephrostomy placement.

516

CT and MRI
CT is more accurate for staging renal tumours, assessing retroperitoneal
pathology, staging bladder and prostatic tumours and may replace IVU

in some centres.
MRI is valuable in staging vascular involvement by renal carcinomas.
Dedicated pelvic coils and endoluminal coils show promising results in
staging bladder and prostatic carcinoma.

Micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG)
Following catheterisation of the bladder, contrast is introduced. This is the
technique of choice for defining urethral anatomy and gauging the presence/degree of vesicoureteric reflux in children.

517

Ascending urethrography
Contrast is injected directly into the urethra in males in the assessment of
urethral trauma, strictures and congenital anomalies such as hypospadias.
Retrograde pyelography
The ureters are catheterised (usually following cystoscopy in theatre) and
contrast injected under x-ray screening. Of value in urothelial tumours
and to define the site of obstruction, e.g. non-opaque calculi.
Angiography
A femoral approach with selective catheterisation of renal vessels. Main
uses include haematuria (look for AVMs), hypertension (RAS), in transplant donors (to define anatomy) and in renal cell carcinoma (where
embolisation is being contemplated).
Nephrostomy
Interventional radiology (p531).

Breast imaging
Breast cancer is a common problem (1 in 12 women). An NHS breast
screening programme is in place following the Forrest Report. Its aim is to
use imaging to detect early clinically occult carcinomas. It screens women
aged 5064 years on a 3-yearly basis (the detection rate is 50 cancers for
every 10,000 women screened).
Mammography
Technical factors: breast tissue has a narrow spectrum of inherent
densities and in order to display these optimally a low kilovoltage (KVP)
beam is used. It enhances the differential absorption of fatty, glandular
and calcific tissues. Dedicated mammographic units provide low energy xray beams with short exposure times. The breast is compressed to
minimise motion and geometric unsharpness. High resolution is
paramount in order to detect microcalcification (as small as 0.1mm). The
breast is a radio-sensitive organ so doses need to kept to a minimum.
Standard projections: these are the mediolateral oblique and
craniocaudal views. Adequacy of the lateral oblique view may be gauged

518

Fig. 13.22 Lateral oblique projection: shows a spiculated mass with distortion of
the surrounding parenchyma and overlying skin thickening, consistent with a breast
carcinoma.

13 Radiology
by the pectoralis major muscle which should be visible to the level of
the nipple, inclusion of the axillary tail, and inclusion of the
inframammary fold. Additional projections such as true lateral and
magnification views may be used to clarify abnormalities.
Mammographic signs: the breast parenchyma is made up of glandular
tissue in a fibro-fatty stroma. Coopers ligaments form a connective
tissue network. The amount of glandular tissue decreases with age, as it
is dense on mammography the suitability of the technique for detecting
pathology increases with age.
Primary signs of a malignancy
2 A mass with ill-defined or spiculate borders.
2 Clustered, linear or irregular calcification (which may occur in the
absence of a mass).
2 Secondary signs include distortion of adjacent stroma, skin thickening
and nipple retraction.
94% of breast carcinoma is ductal in origin.
Breast ultrasound: this largely forms a modality for assessment not
diagnosis or detection. It can, however, be used to evaluate nonpalpable masses, to determine internal architecture (solid vs. cystic), to
assess asymmetric density and as a primary imaging modality in young
women (<35 years). It is also used as a tool to guide intervention, i.e.
drainage of cysts and biopsy of suspicious lesions.
MRI: MRI remains a problem-solving tool in breast imaging at present.
Both MRI and ultrasound may be used to evaluate implants and their
integrity but MRI is the only modality that is sensitive in the evaluation
of intra-capsular implant rupture. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the breast
is also a sensitive method for detection of malignancy with reported
sensitivities in the region of 93%. It is especially useful to detect
recurrent breast carcinoma and where conventional techniques are
unable to help in the distinction from more benign lesions. Breast MRI is
also being advocated for screening young patients with a family
history/genetic risk of breast carcinoma.

Ultrasound
Ultrasound is a high frequency mechanical vibration produced by pizoelectric materials, which have the property of changing thickness when a voltage
is applied across them. It is an important tomographic modality and has
widespread applications in the abdomen, neck, pelvis and extremities. At 519
diagnostic levels there are no known damaging sequelae to tissues and
therefore it is safe for use in obstetrics providing invaluable imaging of the
developing fetus. Doppler USS is based on the principle that sound reflected
by a moving target has a different frequency to the incident sound wave. The
frequency shift is proportional to the velocity of the flowing material.
Doppler therefore not only enables detection but quantification of velocity.

Indications
USS is cheap, readily available, non-invasive and has high patient acceptability. It has a wide range of applications as listed below. There are also
no radiation implications.
Contraindications
None, but remember that USS is operator- and patient-dependent and
should be used as a problem-orientated modality, not as a total body
survey. It cannot be used to image air-containing structures or bone. The
resolution of the USS image is inversely related to the depth of penetration. Therefore image quality in obese patients is sub-optimal.
Applications
Head and neck: may be used for evaluation of the salivary glands,
thyroid, lymph nodes and palpable or clinically suspected masses.
Doppler is used to assess the carotid vessels and quantify degree of
stenosis/occlusion.
Chest (excluding breast): the use here is limited to palpable chest wall
lesions, assessment of pleural abnormalities, biopsy and drainage of
pleural effusions and is occasionally of use in directing a biopsy of
peripheral lung or mediastinal masses.
Abdomen & pelvis: this is the main use of USS. Useful for assessment of
solid organs, e.g. liver, kidneys, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, uterus/
adnexae and bladder. A full bladder is used as an acoustic window in the
pelvis. Retroperitoneal masses and lymph nodes may be visible depending
on patient habitus. USS is useful for directing biopsy of solid
organs/masses and for drainage of ascites, abscesses and collections.
Limbs: musculoskeletal USS has been revolutionised by advances in high
frequency probes which enable characterisation of soft tissue masses,
tendon-related pathology, rotator cuff lesions, masses, effusions and
collections. It is also used for vascular assessment and the diagnosis of
deep vein thrombosis.
Intracavitary transducers: these place the transducer as close as possible
to the area of interest. They include transvaginal, transrectal, urethral,
oesphageal and intravascular probes. They are usually high frequency
transducers that produce detailed high resolution images. Transvaginal
USS is more invasive than transabdominal scanning but is used in the

520

routine assessment of gynaecological disorders. It can also be used for
infertility monitoring, egg retrieval and the exclusion of suspected ectopic
pregnancy. Transrectal scanning is used for screening, assessment and
biopsy of suspected prostatic pathology. Endo-anal probes may be used
to assess morphology and characterise tears of the anal sphincter.
Contrast agents: ultrasound contrast agents are available as an additional
tool in diagnosis, although are not yet widely used. These are microbubbles which are stable over a period of time and may be used to
improve anatomical detail, assess tubal patency (hysterosalpingography), assess tumour vascularity and contrast enhancement.

Computed tomography (CT)
This technique differs from conventional radiography in that it is able to
visualise a vast spectrum of absorption values and therefore tissue densities. Furthermore, being a tomographic technique, the resultant image is
essentially 2D and overcomes the problem of confusing overlap of 3D
structures on plain film. The image is a grey scale representation of the
density of tissues (attenuation) as depicted by x-rays. Each image is made
up of a matrix of squares (pixels) which collectively represent the attenuation values of tissues within that volume (voxel). With conventional CT
separate exposures are made for each slice. Current scanners can acquire
data in a continuous helical or spiral fashion, shortening acquisition time
and reducing artefacts caused by patient movement. This improves overall 521
throughput and increases the likelihood of a diagnostic scan, particularly in
uncooperative patients. The volumetric data that is acquired may be
manipulated by image processing and displayed in a variety of techniques
including 3D reformats and virtual endoscopy.
The attenuation values are expressed on an arbitrary scale (Hounsfield
units) with water being 0, air being 1000 units and bone is +1000 units.
The range of densities displayed on a particular image can be manipulated
by altering the window width and level.

Prior to scanning the abdomen or pelvis dilute oral contrast is given to
opacify the bowel. Intravenous contrast is given to aid the problem-solving
process and differentiates vascular-enhancing lesions from surrounding
tissue.
Indications
There are a wide variety as detailed below. CT is often the most diagnostic
cross-sectional examination and more definitive than USS in many instances.
Contraindications
Due to the relatively high radiation dose, CT should be avoided in pregnancy. Artefact from indwelling, high density foreign material, e.g. hip
prosthesis, dental amalgam and barium, may limit the diagnostic quality of
the examination. Claustrophobia is less of a problem compared to MRI.
Applications
CNS/spine: CT remains the tool for primary diagnosis, pre-surgical
assessment, treatment monitoring and detection of relapse in many
CNS disease conditions. MRI is superior in the posterior fossa and
parasellar region and for assessment in multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and
tumours. Where MRI is not available it is useful for assessment of
degenerative spinal and disc disease. It is superior to MRI in the
assessment of head injury.
Orthopaedics/trauma: uses include diagnosis and staging of bony and
soft tissue neoplasms, and assessment of vertebral, pelvic and complex

13 Radiology
extremity trauma (e.g. tibial plateau fractures). It is also used in the
detection of loose bodies, assessment of acetabular dysplasia and
providing an answer in joint instability (especially in shoulders, wrists
and elbows where it may be performed as an adjunct to/in conjunction
with conventional arthrography).
Oncology/radiotherapy: staging of solid tumours, treatment planning and
the detection of relapse. CT is of particular value in obtaining whole
body scans in oncology due to the speed and ease of use with the
advent of spiral CT. CT is used for radiotherapy treatment planning to
allow more precise targeting of treatment.
Chest: indications include the staging of bronchogenic carcinomas,
characterisation of solitary nodules, diffuse infiltrative lung disease,
widened mediastinum/mediastinal masses and pleural abnormalities. With
spiral CT, pulmonary angiography has advanced the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli particularly when V/Q scanning is indeterminate or equivocal.
Abdomen: applications include the diagnosis of abdominal pathology which
may be of traumatic, neoplastic, inflammatory or infective origin. CT is
particularly useful for masses, pancreatic and hepatic disease, detection
of the site and nature of obstructive jaundice and the assessment of
abdominal trauma. It is also used in the pre-surgical assessment of
abdominal aneurysms and as an aid to interventional techniques
( p531).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
This is a non-invasive technique which displays internal structure whilst
avoiding the use of ionising radiation. The nuclei of certain elements align
with the magnetic force when placed in a strong magnetic field. These are
usually hydrogen nuclei in water and lipid (at clinical field strengths) which
resonate to produce a signal when a radiofrequency pulse is applied and
display anatomical information. Further discussion of the physics is beyond
the scope of this chapter.
T1-weighted images
2 Contrast is due to inherent T1 relaxation.
2 Provides good anatomical information.
2 Fat is displayed as high signal (white).
2 Distinction between cystic (black) and solid structures is possible.
2 Good evaluation of marrow signal.
2 The sequence of choice when evaluating enhancement, as gadolinium
administration makes structures of even higher signal intensity on
T1-weighted images.
T2-weighted images
Technique of choice for evaluating pathology.
Fluid is of high signal and therefore optimally displays oedema.
Improved soft tissue contrast allows evaluation of zonal anatomy of
organs such as the uterus and prostate.

MRA (magnetic resonance angiography)
MRI principles are used to exploit the properties of flowing blood. Images

generated display structures containing flowing blood with suppression of
all other structures. These principles can be further modified so that only
vessels with flow in a specific direction (i.e. arteries vs. veins are visualised).
MRA is currently being used in the evaluation of suspected cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease.
Indications
There are a wide variety of indications as summarised below. MR is especially useful in imaging the brain, spine, peripheral limbs and joints, neck
and pelvis as these structures are less prone to movement artefact. MR
has limited use in the chest and increasing use in the abdomen particularly
with regard to the liver, pancreas and adrenals.
Contraindications
These largely apply to patients with magnetically susceptible devices or
materials whose movement or loss of function can have deleterious consequences. These include cardiac pacemakers, metallic fragments and prosthetic heart valves. Relative contraindications include pregnancy (especially
the 1st trimester) and claustrophobia. MRI magnets are relatively confined
and even those that are not normally claustrophobic may be provoked.
Applications
The spine: MR imaging is superior to other techniques in displaying
anatomy and is the technique of choice in assessing disc disease, the
post-operative back, evaluating neural compression (benign or
malignant), in imaging acute myelitis, infection (such as discitis or
osteomyelitis) and excluding marrow infiltration.
CNS: imaging of the CNS is used to evaluate mass lesions,
hydrocephalus, white matter disease, leptomeningeal pathology,
cerebrovascular disease, degenerative disorders, and visual and
endocrine disorders such as pituitary dysfunction. In trauma/acute

Paediatric: the uses here include assessment of perinatal trauma/anoxic
injury, congenital anomalies and developmental delay. Within the spine
it is invaluable in the assessment of spinal dysraphism and progressive
scoliosis.
Musculoskeletal: along with CNS disease this is a major component of
the MRI workload. It has revolutionised musculoskeletal imaging and is
used to characterise meniscal pathology, ligamentous injury,
degeneration and the sequelae of trauma in the knee, shoulder, wrist
and ankle. Further uses include imaging mass lesions, assessing the
extent of infection and diagnosing early avascular necrosis.
Chest/cardiac: within the thorax MRI is useful for assessment of apical
lesions such as Pancoasts tumours, chest wall and brachial plexus
lesions and mediastinal masses. Cardiac applications are legion and fast
evolving; they include imaging of the great vessels to exclude
congenital/acquired aortic disease (including dissection) and the
diagnosis of pulmonary embolus.
Abdominal/pelvic MRI: within the abdomen MR is often a problemsolving tool and can be used to more confidently characterise focal liver
and pancreatic lesions as well as assess diffuse liver disease. It is also of
use in evaluating indeterminate adrenal masses. Within the pelvis uses
include the imaging of congenital anomalies as well as staging tumours
such as cervical, prostate and rectal tumours. There have been rapid
advances in techniques for imaging bowel-related pathology.
Interventional MRI: open MRI units image the patients in large bore or Cshaped units rather than the closed narrow tunnel used in conventional
units. They can therefore be used for claustrophobic patients and to
provide imaging guidance for interventional procedures. Disadvantages
include a low magnetic field strength (0.10.3T vs. 1.5T) and a limited
anatomical and spatial resolution due to their basic construct.

then perform the remainder of the cervical spine series (AP and open
526 mouth peg views), if patient mobility allows and high index of suspicion.
All 7 cervical vertebral bodies should be visualised (a large number of
cervicothoracic injuries are missed because of inadequate views). If not
seen request a specialised lateral view (swimmers). Then sequentially
evaluate:
Alignment: assess the following lines (Fig.13.28). They should be parallel
with no step-offs.

Bones: inspect C1 and C2. The anterior arch of C1 should be 3mm from
the dens in adults (5mm in children). The vertebral bodies should be
intact and they should be uniform in size and shape. Check disc spaces for
any inordinate narrowing or widening which may be post-traumatic.
Cartilage:
2 Soft tissues: look for abnormal widening or a localized bulge. 50% of
patients with a bony injury will have soft tissue thickening. The soft
tissues should be no more than one-third of a vertebral body until C4
and a vertebral body width thereafter.
2 The PEG views: do not mistake a superimposed arch of C1 or the
incisors as a fracture. Important points to remember are:
The lateral margins of C1 and C2 should align.
The spaces on either side of the peg should be equal (Fig. 13.28).
Remember: normal plain films do not exclude ligamentous injury.
In the routine setting cervical spine films are taken to exclude spondylosis
(disc space narrowing and osteophytes) and atlantoaxial subluxation
which results in long tract signs and cord compression (rheumatoid
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Downs syndrome).
Thoracic and lumbar spine
Degenerative disease is common with disc space narrowing, end plate
sclerosis and osteophyte formation. Wedge compression fractures are
common in the osteoporotic spine and need to be distinguished from the
more sinister causes (absence of paraspinal mass, posterior elements
spared). Multiple collapsed vertebrae are found in osteoporosis, neoplastic disease, trauma and histiocytosis X. Bone density may help narrow
the differential which includes increased (sclerotic metastases, lymphoma)
and decreased (acute infection, osteoporosis).
Spondylolisthesis is the subluxation of one vertebral body on another and
may be degenerative or due to bilateral pars defects (spondylosis). This is
a fracture/defect of the posterior elements of the vertebrae. On an
oblique view the posterior elements form a Scottie dog (with the pars
making up the collar). This may be a purely incidental finding, however if
severe can result in neuroforaminal stenosis. Plain films are insensitive in
the evaluation of disc disease. MRI is the investigation of choice for disc
disease and its neurological complications.

Pelvis
Pelvic fractures are complex and there are many classification systems
around. The pelvis should be regarded as being made up of three bony
rings. The SI joints and pubic symphysis are part of the main bony ring. A
528 fracture of one ring is frequently associated with a second ring fracture
(Fig. 13.29).
2
2
2

SI joints should be equal in width.

The superior surfaces of the pubic rami should align. The joint width
should be no more than 5mm.
The sacral foramina should form a smooth arc.

13 Radiology
2

Acetabular fractures are subtlelook for symmetry.

Bone texture: the pelvis is a common site for metastatic involvement
especially with urological malignancies, e.g. prostate (sclerotic
metastases) and myeloma (multiple lytic lesions). Pagets disease of the
pelvis may mimic sclerotic metastases but tends to be confined to one
hemipelvis and may expand or thicken bone.
Sacroiliitis: SI joint involvement is common in the seronegative arthropathies and is usually symmetrical in conditions such as inflammatory
bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis and hyperparathyroidism. More
asymmetrical change is seen in Reiters disease and rheumatoid arthritis. It
is characterised by initial erosion and widening of the joint resulting in
chronic sclerosis which has a preferential involvement of the lower onethird of the joint (iliac > sacral side).
Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral heads is an important finding but
is often advanced when plain film findings are seen. Radiographically
occult AVN may be detected on MRI or a bone scan. On plain x-ray it is
characterised by sclerosis, flattening and fragmentation of the femoral
head. Subchondral crescents are pathognomonic. AVN can also be a
sequel of trauma, but bilateral AVN is seen in conjunction with steroid
therapy, sickle cell disease and as part of Perthes disease.

Fig. 13.29 The pelvis is made up of bony rings: the main pelvic ring and two
smaller rings made up of the pubic and ishial bones.

Vascular intervention
Angiography is catheterisation of a vessel followed by subsequent opacification with a water-soluble iodine-containing contrast medium.
Catheterisation is usually performed using the Seldinger technique.
Indications include
2 Demonstration of arterial anatomy prior to surgery where this is likely
to influence surgical management.
2 To elucidate the nature of arterial disease, e.g. occlusions, stenoses,
thrombi, aneurysms and vascular malformations.
2 To identify the source of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.
2 To demonstrate tumour circulation (often prior to embolisation).

529

Contrast
Volumes used are variable depending on the area being imaged. The contrast agents are iodinated, non-ionic and of low osmolarity, resulting in
reduced toxicity. Nevertheless potential side effects include anaphylaxis,
hypotension, urticaria and bronchospasm. Patients particularly at risk
include those with a history of a previous reaction, iodine allergy and
atopy. Nephrotoxicity is a potential risk and may be exacerbated by dehydration. Contrast reactions are seen in 1/1000 patients. Risk of anaphylaxis
is 1/40,0000. Pre-medication with corticosteroids may reduce the incidence of reactions if contrast administration is essential, but this is not universally accepted.
Specific applications
These include pulmonary angiography (gold standard for detection of pulmonary emboli) which is highly invasive and therefore reserved for when
thrombolysis or embolectomy are being considered. Cerebral angiography is useful in the diagnosis of aneurysms, AVMs, tumour vascularity
and both intra- and extracranial vascular disease. Renal angiography is
selectively performed to diagnose renal artery stenosis and prior to
embolisation of tumours.
DSA (digital subtraction angiography) is a technique whereby there is
subtraction of the contrast-containing shadows from the initial plain films
(mask) resulting in an image containing opacified structures only. The
resulting images may be digitised and manipulated. The overall advantage
is smaller doses of contrast and smaller catheters may be used.

Therapeutic embolisation is used to selectively occlude arteries by
introducing a variety of materials via a catheter. Materials used include
metallic coil, gelatin foam and cyanoacrylate glue. This technique is used
at active bleeding sites, and to reduce tumour vascularity preoperatively in resectable tumours.
Vascular catheterisation is also used to selectively infuse vessels as with
thrombolytic treatment or rarely with cytotoxics. Vascular stenting is of
increasing use in coronary and peripheral vascular disease. IVC filters
are percutaneously placed via the femoral vein in the treatment of
patients with recurrent pulmonary emboli despite anticoagulation or
where anti-coagulation is contraindicated.

13 Radiology

Interventional radiology
Interventional radiology is a sub-speciality where a variety of imaging
modalities are used to guide percutaneous procedures. This may
obviate alternative surgical procedures and consequently result in
lower morbidity. Interventional procedures are usually carried out
under local anaesthesia and on an outpatient basis, thereby considerably reducing bed occupancy. There is a huge range of procedures
that are currently performed. The following is a limited list of some of
them.
Percutaneous biopsy: biopsy needle placement may be done under
fluoroscopy, CT, MRI and ultrasound. This provides non-operative
confirmation of suspected malignancy and with the aid of a tissue
diagnosis it is possible to accurately plan treatment. For histology a
1418G needle is used. With a fine aspiration needle (2022G)
material may be obtained for cytology. Using imaging guidance, there is
avoidance of damage to vital structures such as blood vessels, solid
organs and bowel loops. With chest biopsy there is a small risk of
pneumothorax.
Percutaneous drainage: with image guidance, surgical intervention may
be avoided by accurate placement of a drainage catheter. Calibre varies
from 8 to 14F depending on the nature of the underlying fluid. Regular
irrigation of the catheter may be necessary to ensure successful
drainage. Successful resolution may be impeded in the more complex
and multiloculated collections.
Drainage of the urinary system can be via double J stents which are
placed into an obstructed collecting system with the distal catheter tip
lying in the bladder. More short-term drainage is achieved via a
percutaneous nephrostomy. Here the obstructed kidney is punctured
under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance and a catheter placed in the

531

Fig. 13.31

renal calyx (preferably lower pole). This is the technique of choice in
the acutely obstructed or infected kidney.
Biliary system drainage: surgical outcome in patients with malignant bile
duct obstruction is often poor. This may be due to carcinoma of the
pancreas or cholangiocarcinoma. Biliary stenting alleviates obstruction
and improves quality of life. Stenting may be performed at ERCP or
percutaneously via antegrade puncture through the liver (PTC to
delineate the anatomy being performed first). Other GI interventions
include stenting/balloon dilatation of oesophageal strictures and
percutaneous gastrostomy insertion.
TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt) is a procedure
whereby a connection is made between the hepatic and portal veins to
reduce portal pressure in patients with portal hypertension. The
mortality is considerably lower than in acute shunt surgery, particularly
in the context of an acute variceal bleed which has failed to respond to
sclerotherapy.

Hands
There are specific patterns that may be seen in the hand as an indicator of
the underlying disorder. Some patterns are pathognomonic whereas
others are more non-specific.
1. Generalised osteopenia: osteoporosis, multiple myeloma and rheumatoid arthritis.
2. Coarsening of the trabecular pattern is common in haemoglobinopathies especially thalassaemia and Gauchers disease.
3. Periosteal reaction: (i) HPOA (hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy) associations include carcinoma of the bronchus, inflammatory
bowel disease and coeliac disease, (ii) thyroid acropachy, most
common on the radial side of the thumbs, and (iii) juvenile chronic
arthritis seen in about 25%.
4. Carpal abnormalities include short metacarpals (Turners syndrome,
pseudo- and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism), carpal fusion (inflammatory arthritis, RA & JCA, post-trauma), and look for syndactyly and
polydactyly.
5. Soft tissue changes, e.g. increase in soft tissue thickness/size seen in
acromegaly, localised increase seen in gouty tophi, nodes as in OA, soft
tissue calcification seen in CREST and scleroderma.
6. Joint disease: the hand x-ray above all may help in sorting out the type
of arthropathy and aid rheumatological management. The ABCS
approach is invaluable (see below).
Trauma
Two views are essential for ensuring no subtle injuries are missed. On a
532 PA view the spaces between the carpal bones and the carpometacarpal
articulations should be roughly equal (12mm). If a dislocation is present
then there is obliteration/overlap. Common injuries include Bennetts
fracture, a first metacarpal base injury extending into the joint surface with
dislocation at the carpometacarpal joint. Scaphoid fractures are the most
common (7590%) of carpal injuries. Because of the blood supply there is
a potential risk of osteonecrosis of the proximal pole.

Skull x-ray
Indications
The main indication is acute trauma although they are of limited use.
Occasionally the SXR is obtained as part of a skeletal survey in evaluation
of metabolic bone disease, endocrine disorders and in the assessment of
metastatic disease.
Contraindications
None, but if there is suspicion of underlying intracranial injury plain films
are unnecessary (see below).
Normal findings
The bones of the skull vault have an inner and outer table of compact
bone with spongy diploe between the two. Sutures are visible even after
fusion and should not be mistaken for fractures. Blood vessels may cause
impressions, as can small lucencies in the inner table near the vertex
caused by normal arachnoid granulations which can be mistaken for small
lytic lesions.
Trauma: skull x-rays are basic, widely available and yet potentially yield
the least information in the context of trauma. The presence or
absence of a skull fracture does not correlate with the presence or
extent of any intracranial injury. Up to 50% of films may be technically
unsatisfactory due to factors such as poor patient cooperation. With
the advent of CT this is the technique of choice for evaluation in acute
injury and neurological deficit. It allows a firm diagnosis to be made and
excludes other alternate diagnoses.
Fractures and associated findings: basic radiographs include a lateral
projection (obtained with a horizontal beam) and a further tangential
projection, depending on the site of injury.
Findings include
2 A linear fracture: well-defined margins, no branching and no sclerosis
(cf. vascular markings or sutures which have an undulating course and
sclerotic margins).
2 A depressed fracture: increased density due to overlapping bone;
those that are depressed by >5mm may lacerate the dura or cause
parenchymal injury and therefore need elevation.
2 A fluid level/pneumocephalus: implies an associated basal skull fracture
or dural tear.
Note: Pineal displacement is an inconstant finding and is not a reliable
method of assessing the presence of intracranial injury.
findings
534 Abnormal
Look for intracranial calcification then examine the pituitary fossa, review
bony density and look for focal areas of lysis and sclerosis.
2 Intracranial calcification: the majority is normal and of no clinical significance. However it may be of pathological significance; causes include
primary tumours such as meningiomas, craniopharyngiomas, arteriovenous malformations, tuberose sclerosis and infections such as toxoplasmosis.

Raised intracranial pressure: in practice plain film changes are only seen if
the condition is long standing. These include sutural widening (diastasis) and erosion of the lamina dura of the pituitary fossa.
Enlargement of the pituitary fossa (normal dimensions: height 611mm,
length 916mm). Expansion will result in a double floor, loss of the
lamina dura and elevation/destruction of the clinoid processes. The
vast majority of the lesions will be pituitary adenomas; other causes
include meningiomas and aneurysms.
Bone lysis: may be diffuse as in metastasis or myeloma. Large areas of
bone destruction are seen in histiocytosis X and in the active phase of
Pagets disease (osteoporosis circumscripta).
Bone sclerosis: may be localised as in meningiomas, depressed skull fractures or generalised as in Pagets sclerotic metastases, myeloma and
fluorosis.
Sutural widening: may be due to raised intracranial pressure, infiltration
by malignancy (neuroblastoma or lymphoma) or defective ossification
as in rickets.

Introduction to nuclear medicine
Nuclear medicine techniques use a carrier molecule, selected to target the
organ/tissue of interest, tagged with a gamma-emitting radioisotope. The
labelled drug (radiopharmaceutical) is given PO or IV. Its distribution is
then mapped in vivo using a gamma camera or, for non-imaging tests, in
vitro using a radiation counter.
Nuclear medicine procedures detect the earliest physiological response to
disease processes, generally before structural changes have taken place.
Scintigraphy is often more sensitive than conventional radiology in early
disease. Specificity varies depending on the radiopharmaceutical used and
characterisation of abnormalities relies upon pattern recognition within a
particular clinical setting. Anatomical detail is poor compared with conventional radiology, although tomographic cameras generate high resolution 3D images.
Nuclear medicine procedures are non-invasive and allow the whole body
to be imaged during a single examination. Absorbed radiation doses
depend on the radiopharmaceutical used but are usually in the same range
as diagnostic radiology. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to
nuclear medicine examinations except where likely clinical benefit far outweighs potential riske.g. lung perfusion imaging. Some radiopharmaceuticals are excreted in breast milk and additional precautions may be
advisable for lactating women.
Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals are used in tracer quantities and toxicity
is negligible. Individual hypersensitivity reactions are rare.
Specific information required when requesting nuclear medicine
tests includes
2 Patient identification details.
2 Examination requested.
2 Relevant clinical history including results of other investigations.
2 Pregnancy/lactation details where relevant.
2 Special needsvisual/hearing/learning difficulties; needle phobia.

Bone scintigraphy: bone scan
Indications
2 Tumour staginge.g. to assess skeletal metastases.
2 Bone pain.
2 Traumawhen radiographs unhelpful.
2 Prosthetic loosening, e.g. THR .
2 Infection.
2 Avascular necrosis (AVN ).
540 2 Pagets to assess extent.
Patient preparation
Should be well hydrated and continent.

14 Nuclear medicine

Fig. 14.1 Normal whole body 99mTc phosphate bone scan.

Fig. 14.2 Pagets diseaseright hemipelvis and distal femur.

Procedure
Inject 99mTc-phosphate complex IV. For suspected AVN or sepsis, image
immediately to assess vascularity. Otherwise, image 24h later. Whole
body views are required for metastatic screening. Tomography improves
anatomical definition and detection of small lesions, e.g. osteoid osteoma.
Results
2 Radiopharmaceutical uptake reflects osteoblastic activity.
2 Focal 4 uptake in sclerotic metastases, trauma or infection.
2 Diffuse 4 uptake associated with advanced metastases, Pagets and
metabolic bone disease.
2 5 uptake in acute AVN and lytic bone metastases.

Interpretation
Sensitive but non-specific. Interpretation relies on pattern recognition in
the clinical setting.
Advantages

long bones. Homogeneous uptake in liver and spleen.
Interpretation
Focal or generalised 5 skeletal uptake indicates marrow replacement
or infiltration with marrow displacement to distal femora and humeri.
2 Heterogeneous hepatic uptake is abnormal but non-specific.

Gastrointestinal bleeding: labelled red
cell imaging
Indications
Helps localise source of active GI haemorrhage when other techniques
(e.g. endoscopy or angiography) have failed.
Patient preparation
No recent contrast barium studies.
Procedure
Label red cells (in vitro or in vivo) using 99mTc pertechnetate. Abdominal
gamma camera blood pool imaging immediately and at intervals for up to
36h post-injection or until bleeding source is identified.
Results
Activity normally restricted to vascular compartment.
Interpretation
Any activity in gut lumen implies active haemorrhage. Serial images helpful.

547

Advantages
More sensitive and less invasive than angiography for intermittent
bleeding.
Pitfalls

Indications
Unexplained abdominal pain or GI haemorrhageafter endoscopy/contrast radiology.
Patient preparation
2 Starve for 4h.
2 H2 antagonist administration may improve specificity.
2 No recent barium studies.
Procedure
Inject 99mTc pertechnetate IV. Immediate and serial abdominal imaging
over 1h.
Results
Normal uptake in gastric mucosa.
Interpretation
Focal abnormal uptake appearing at the same time as the stomach implies
ectopic gastric mucosa (Meckels diverticulum) or, occasionally, duplication cyst. Commonest siteRIF.
Advantages
Non-invasive.
Pitfalls
False +ves due to activity in renal tractlateral images usually help.

Hepatobiliary scintigraphy
Indications

Procedure
2 Adults: IV injection 99mTc-labelled iminodiacetic acid complex (IDA ).
Gamma camera imaging over 1h.

549

2

Neonates: IV injection 99mTc IDA. Immediate dynamic imaging for 5min
then serial static images for up to 36h, or until activity reaches small
bowel lumen.

Results
Gallbladder and biliary tree normally shown with tracer excretion via
common bile duct into duodenum by 30min post-injection.
Cholecystokinin 0.5u/kg IV sometimes administered to stimulate gallbladder emptying.
Interpretation
2 Acute cholecystitis: absent gallbladder.
2 Obstruction, leak or reflux assessed visually.
2 Neonates: passage of activity into gut lumen excludes biliary atresia.
Quantification of T0 to T10 min images improves specificity for atresia
diagnosis.
Advantages
Non-invasive. Straightforward pattern recognition.
Pitfalls
Delayed IDA excretion in severe jaundice: bilirubin >300mol/L.

14 Nuclear medicine
Results & interpretation
Damaged red cells taken up by splenic remnants.
Advantages
Investigation of choice for detection of splenunculus.
Pitfalls
Enlarged left lobe of liver may obscure small splenic remnant.

Hepatosplenic scintigraphy
Indications
Liver space-occupying lesionsnow largely replaced by ultrasound, CT or
MRI.
Patient preparation
None.
Procedure
Tc colloid injected IV. Abdominal gamma camera images 30min postinjection.
99m

Results
Normal, homogeneous liver and spleen uptake.
Interpretation
Focal 5 uptake in space-occupying lesions. 4 spleen and bone activity in
portal hypertension. Focal 4 uptake in caudate lobe pathognomonic of
Budd-Chiari syndrome.
Advantages

Gastric emptying studies
Indications
Altered GI motilitydelayed or accelerated gastric emptying.
Patient preparation
Starved for 4h. Stop drugs likely to influence GI motility, e.g. opiates, domperidone.

551

Procedure
Milk study
Give radiolabelled milk drink orally. Image anterior abdomen immediately
and at 10min intervals for 1h. Generate computer-derived clearance
curves to calculate emptying half-time. Delayed thoracic image helpful to
exclude lung aspiration if clearance significantly delayed.
Dual isotope method
Give 99mTc-labelled standard meal with 111In-labelled water. Anterior
abdomen gamma camera imaging as before using dual isotope settings.
Generate solid and liquid phase clearance curves.
Results
Normal gastric emptying half-time (milk = 20min). Normal range for solids
is centre-specific, depending on standard meal composition.
Interpretation
Visual image evaluation and half-time calculation.
Advantages
Non-invasive and quantitative.
Pitfalls
Vomiting during study invalidates emptying time calculations.

Thyroid scintigraphy
Indications
2 Characterisation of thyrotoxicosisdiffuse toxic goitre (Graves
disease), toxic multinodular goitre (Plummers disease).
2 Autonomous nodule.
2 Acute thyroiditis.
Patient preparation
Thyroxine and iodine-rich preparations, e.g. iodine supplements, contrast
media, amiodarone, will block tracer uptake by the thyroid for up to 9
months. T4 should be withdrawn for 6 weeks; T3 for 2 weeks. Antithyroid
drugs can be continued.
Procedure
Inject 99mTc pertechnetate IV. Image after 1530min. Include anterior
thorax views if retrosternal extension is suspected. Neck palpation essential to assess function in discrete thyroid nodules.
Results
2 Uptake reflects function of the thyroid iodine trap.
552 2 Diffuse increased uptake in Graves disease.
2 Heterogeneous uptake with suppressed background activity indicates
toxic multinodular change.

Parathyroid scintigraphy
Indications
Localisation of parathyroid adenoma in proven hyperparathyroidism.
Patient preparation
Withdraw thyroxine or iodine-containing compounds (
(p553)).

Thyroid imaging

Procedure
Two radiopharmaceuticals given IV: either 123I iodide followed by 99mTc
sestamibi or 99mTc pertechnetate followed by 210thallous chloride. Image
anterior neck and mediastinum after each administration.
Results
Normal thyroid concentrates 123I, 99mTc pertechnetate, 99mTc sestamibi
and 201TL whereas parathyroid only concentrates 99mTc sestamibi and
201
Tl. Computer-assisted image subtraction:
[(thyroid + parathyroid)  thyroid] identifies abnormal parathyroid tissue.
Interpretation
Parathyroid adenoma shown as hyperfunctioning nodule(s).
Advantages
Good when other imaging fails, particularly for ectopic adenomas and
after unsuccessful neck exploration.
Pitfalls
Multinodular thyroid prevents subtraction analysis. False ves in multiple
parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia. Many surgeons still prefer intra
operative blue dye.

2 Phaeochromocytoma (imaging investigation of choice).
2 Neuroblastoma.
2 Carcinoid tumours.
2 Medullary thyroid cancer.
Patient preparation
Multiple known and theoretical drug interactions. Stop for >48h:
 Antidepressants: tricyclics, tetracyclics, MAOIS, serotonin re-uptake
inhibitors.
 Phenothiazines.

Procedure
Inject 123I mIBG slowly IV with blood pressure monitoring. Image posterior abdomen at 5min to identify renal outlines, then whole body imaging
at 1824h. Tomographic imaging may improve tumour localisationnot
always required.
Results
Physiological uptake at 24h in salivary glands, myocardium, liver and
normal adrenals with gut and renal excretion.

556 Interpretation
2

Intense 4 uptake in phaeochromocytomas, with suppressed activity in
the contralateral, normal adrenal and myocardium. Whole body

Diffuse bone marrow uptake common in stage IV neuroblastoma.

Advantages
Sensitive, non-invasive tumour localisation pre-operatively excludes multifocal and extra-adrenal tumours. Non-invasive treatment response monitoring in neuroblastomaavoids sampling errors compared with bone
marrow biopsy.
Pitfalls
Drug interactions causing false ve results. Dilated renal pelvis sometimes
confused with tumour uptake. Check with 5min renal image if in doubt.

Somatostatin scintigraphy
Indications
Localise and stage neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), e.g. carcinoid, insulinoma, gastrinoma, phaeochromocytoma and medullary thyroid cancer.
Patient preparation
None required. Prophylactic laxatives at time of radiopharmaceutical
administration accelerate gut clearance and improve image quality.

558

tumour with hepatic metastases.

14 Nuclear medicine
Procedure
Inject 111In-labelled somatostatin analogue (octreotide or lanreotide) IV.
Whole body gamma camera imaging at 24  48h, with tomography if necessary.
Results
Normal uptake in thyroid, liver, spleen, kidneys and RE system with gut
and renal excretion.
Interpretation
4 uptake in tumours expressing surface somatostatin receptors.
Tomography improves detection of small pancreatic and intra-hepatic
tumours.
Advantages
Tumour uptake predicts symptom response to somatostatin analogue
therapy. Image co-registration with CT or MRI improves localisation of
occult pancreatic NETs.
Pitfalls
Interpretation often hindered by gut excretion.

Radioiodine thyroid cancer imaging
Indications
Routine differentiated follicular thyroid cancer follow-up, after surgery and
131I thyroid remnant ablation.
Patient preparation
Need high TSH drive to stimulate 131I uptakestop T3/T4 replacement
for minimum of 2 (T3) or 6 weeks (T4) or give recombinant TSH. Avoid
iodine administration, IV contrast media, amiodarone ( Thyroid imaging
(p553)).
Procedure
Give PO/IV 131I sodium iodide. Whole body gamma camera imaging 27
days later.
Results
Physiological uptake in salivary glands. Occasional stomach and GI retention. Renal excretion.
Interpretation
Abnormal uptake indicates functioning thyroid metastasis. Anatomical 559
markers improve localisation.
Advantages
Detects residual tumour and identifies patients likely to benefit from
therapy.

Sentinel node imaging
Indications
Pre-operative assessment in breast cancer and melanoma. May have applications in head and neck, vulval and penile cancer staging.
Patient preparation
None required. Usually undertaken within 24h of planned surgery.
Procedure
Intradermal, subcutaneous or intratumoural injection of 99mTc-labelled
nanocolloid. Gamma camera imaging of draining lymph nodes to identify
sentinel node. Where surgery is undertaken within 24h, an intra-operative
gamma probe can be used to identify the sentinel node for staging excision
biopsy.
Results
Sentinel node usually identifiable 15min to 2h post-injection, depending on
the primary tumour location and injection technique used.
Interpretation
The sentinel node is the first lymph node identified on gamma imaging
or the node with the highest radioactive count rate using the gamma
probe.
Advantages
Accurate sentinel node identification avoids block node dissection, where
this is undertaken solely for tumour staging.
Pitfalls
May fail if local lymphatic channels have been disrupted by previous surgery.

Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)
Indications
In ischaemic heart disease.
1. Pre-angiography:
 When conventional stress testing fails, e.g. bundle branch block.
 Left ventricular hypertrophy.
 Atypical chest pain.
 Recurrent chest pain post-intervention. Good prognostic indicator.
2. Post-angiography:
 Assess functional significance of known stenoses.
 Identify critical vascular territory for intervention.

561

Patient preparation
2 Stop b-blockers 24h prior to stress study.
2 Sometimes helpful to withdraw all anti-anginal medication.
2 Assess optimal stress technique for individual patient, i.e. exercise or
pharmacological.
2 Attach 12-lead ECG.
2 Insert IV cannula.
2 Check baseline blood pressure.
Procedure
2-part investigation comparing myocardial perfusion during stress and at rest.
2 Stress test: treadmill or bicycle exercise to >85% maximum predicted
heart rate or adenosine 140g/kg/min IVI for 6minsometimes with
submaximal exercise or
Dobutamine 540g/kg/min in 5g/kg/min increments over 18min.
2 Inject radiopharmaceutical (201Tl, 99mTc MIBI (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) or 99mTc tetrofosmin) at peak stress.
2 Tomographic imaging immediately (201Tl) or 1560min post-injection
(99mTc compounds).
2 Rest study: Delayed image >4h after stress injection [201Tl] or second
radiopharmaceutical injection under resting conditions [99mTc MIBI,
99mTc tetrofosmin, 201Tl (2nd injection may improve sensitivity)].
Tomographic imaging as before.
Results
Myocardial uptake reflects radiopharmaceutical delivery and myocyte
function.
Interpretation
Infarction causes matched perfusion defects during stress and rest.
Inducible ischaemia creates a perfusion defect at stress which re-perfuses
at rest = reversible ischaemia. The severity, extent and number of
reversible defects are prognostically significant. A normal MPI study
implies risk of an adverse cardiac event <0.5% per annum.
Advantages
Non-invasive; relatively inexpensive compared with angiography.
Pitfalls
Less sensitive in multiple small vessel coronary diseasee.g. diabetes mellitus. Sensitivity depends on stress test quality.

Patient preparation
None, but avoid dehydration.
Procedure
99m
Tc DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) injected IV. Static anterior, posterior and posterior oblique images acquired 24h later.
Results
Visual image evaluation, assessing integrity of cortical outlines for scarring.
Quantitative computer image analysis is used to measure relative renal
function, i.e. the contribution of each kidney to overall GFR.
Interpretation
Cortical scars distort renal outline. Duplication may result in non-functioning upper moiety, usually due to obstruction, or scarred lower moiety,
secondary to vesicoureteric reflux. Relative renal function is usually 50:50
 5%.
Advantages
Sensitive for renal scarring; superior to ultrasound. Non-invasive.
Pitfalls
False +ves during or immediately after acute pyelonephritismay give
cortical defects that do not progress to scarring. Splenic impression at left
upper pole may be mistaken for scarring.

Dynamic renography
Indications
2 Assessment of renal drainagediscrimination between renal dilatation
and outflow obstruction.
2 Measurement of relative renal function.
2 Loin pain.
2 Post-pyeloplasty follow-up.
2 Renal artery stenosis
Captopril renography (p569).
Patient preparation
Good hydration essential. Empty bladder immediately before undertaking
study.
Procedure
1. Position patient supine or seated erect, with the camera behind.
2. Obtain good peripheral venous access. Bolus radiopharmaceutical
injection 99mTc MAG-3 (trimercaptoacetylglycine), 99mTc DTPA (dipentaacetic acid) or 123I hippuran followed by 1020mL saline flush.
567
3. Image immediately acquiring real time dynamic data for 2030min.
4. Diuretic administration is essential to distinguish dilatation from
outflow obstruction.
5. Post-voiding images are always required to assess the completeness of
bladder emptying and may improve drainage of the upper renal tracts
in high pressure systems.

Results
Visual inspection of renal size, perfusion, function and drainage.
Quantitative computer image analysis measures relative function, transit
times and generates drainage graphs.
Interpretation
Uptake and excretion of activity normally rapid. Dilated systems show
progressive pooling in the renal pelvis which empties following diuretic
568 challenge. Obstructed systems show progressive tracer accumulation with
no diuretic response, often associated with 5 function on the affected side.
Advantages
Sensitive, non-invasive, quantitative renal function assessment. Anatomical
imaging, e.g. IVU better for renal morphology, stones, etc.

14 Nuclear medicine
Pitfalls
Movement artefact, chronic renal failure and dehydration reduce data reliability. Renal drainage may be gravity dependentalways complete study
with an erect image. Drainage curves invalidated by radiopharmaceutical
extravasation.

Captopril renography
Indications
Diagnosis of renal artery stenosis (especially fibromuscular dysplasia) and
to predict response to revascularisation.
Patient preparation
Well hydrated. Baseline blood pressure. IV access. Stop ACE inhibitors for
48h prior to test.
Procedure
2 Perform standard dynamic renogram.
2 Repeat renogram 1h after oral captopril 25mg single dose PO .
2 Monitor blood pressurebeware hypotension.
Results
Perfusion pressure is maintained by angiotensin I/II in renal artery stenosis.
Captopril reduces perfusion pressure leading to fall in relative function
and delayed tracer uptake on affected side. Quantitative evaluation of R : L
renal function and time to peak activity in each kidney.
Interpretation
RAS due to fibromuscular dysplasiafall in relative renal function and

delayed time to peak renal activity >10min.
Advantages
Distinguishes generalised atherosclerosis (often poor blood pressure
outcome following angioplasty) from fibromuscular hyperplasia (good
angioplasty response).
Pitfalls
Severe hypotension.

Lung scan: ventilation/perfusion
imaging
Indications
2 Suspected pulmonary embolism.
2 Pre-operative lung function assessment.

569

Patient preparation
None required. Relative contraindication in right7left intracardiac
shunts; caution in severe pulmonary hypertension.
Procedure
2 Lie patient supine and inject 99mTc macroaggregates or albumin IV .
2 Obtain gamma camera perfusion images in 4 views.
2 Ventilation images are obtained in same projections by continuous
breathing of 81mKr gas (same day) or using 99mTc aerosol or 133xenon
gas (separate day).
Results
Homogeneous, matched ventilation and perfusion patterns.
Interpretation
Four abnormal patterns recognised:
1. Segmental perfusion loss with preserved ventilationpulmonary
embolism.
2. Segmental matched perfusion and ventilation losspulmonary infarction/infection.
3. Segmental/subsegmental ventilation loss with preserved perfusion
infection.
4. Non-segmental, patchy, matched perfusion and ventilation LOSS
COPD.
Advantages
Quick, non-invasive. Normal scan virtually excludes PE.
Pitfalls
Specificity reduced in underlying lung diseaseCOPD, asthma giving indeterminate results. False +ves with tumour, bullae, vasculitides, fibrotic lung
disease and old, unresolved PE.

Lung shunt studies
Indications
Suspected pulmonary AV shunting.
Patient preparation
None required.
Procedure
Inject 99mTc nanocolloid IV. Gamma camera lung, abdomen and head
imaging. Calculate relative uptake in lungs, kidneys and brain. Express as
fraction of cardiac output to quantify shunt fraction.
Results
Kidneys and brain not normally visible on lung perfusion imaging.

570 Interpretation

Abnormal extrapulmonary activity implies degree of shunting. Intensity of
uptake rises with shunt severity.

Interpretation
Slow clearance and failed regional node uptake in hypoplastic systems or
metastatic regional node infiltration, depending on clinical context.
Advantages
Technically easier than conventional (contrast) lymphographyavoids

Positron emission tomography (PET)
Indications
2 Oncology: tumour localisation; staging; assess treatment response,
detect relapse.
2 Cardiology: myocardial hibernation.
2 Neurology: cerebral blood flow; localise epileptogenic focus.
Patient preparation
Depends on pharmaceutical used and study undertaken. Commonest
tracer is 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (18F- FDG). Uptake influenced by plasma
glucose levels, insulin administered on sliding scale for maximal uptake
(optional).
Procedure
Fast for 6h. Tracer given IV in restful environment. Tomographic imaging
using dedicated PET scanner or modified gamma camera.
Results
Normal uptake in metabolically active tissuesbrain, myocardium, liver,
renal excretion.
Interpretation
2 Oncology: image co-registration with anatomical imaging essential.
Abnormal focal 18F FDG uptake implies residual, viable tumour.
2 Cardiology: myocardial metabolism compared with perfusion images.
Poor perfusion but persisting 18F FDG metabolism indicates hibernation.
2 Neurology: localise epileptogenic foci.
Advantages

574 Sensitive for metabolically active lesions. Invaluable for distinguishing
tumour recurrence from scarring/fibrosis.
Pitfalls
Limited availability. Expensive. Full potential not yet reached. False +ves in
infection, post-exercise striatal muscle uptake.

Non-specific gut retention reduced by laxative administration.
Results
Normal uptake in lacrimal glands, nasal mucosa, blood pool, liver, spleen,
testes, female perineum, breast.
Interpretation
2 Focal lymph node uptake in lymphoma and sarcoid distinguishes active
disease from post-therapy scarring/fibrosis.
2 In AIDS , 4 lung uptake indicates infectionPCP , CMV , mycobacteriumchest radiograph correlation essential.
2 4 activity in inflammatory bowel disease and focal sepsis; largely superseded by WBC imaging.
Advantages
Excellent, non-invasive marker of disease activity in lymphomabut likely
to be superseded by PET.
Pitfalls
Poor specificity. High radiation dose often difficult to justify when alternative techniques are available.

Dacroscintigraphy
Indications
Epiphora.
Patient preparation
None required.
Procedure
12 drops 99mTc-labelled DTPA or pertechnetate instilled into outer 575
canthus of each eye. Immediate dynamic gamma camera imaging for 20min
with delayed static scans as required.
Results
Normal rapid radiopharmaceutical clearance through nasolacrimal apparatus.

Interpretation
Delayed clearance implies obstructionlevel of dysfunction usually identified, i.e. punctum, lacrimal sac, nasolacrimal duct.
Advantages
Non-invasive. Avoids nasolacrimal duct cannulation (compared with
dacrocystography).
Pitfalls
Obstructed systems result in excess radiolabelled tears on cheek altering
drainage times.

14 Nuclear medicine
Procedure
Obtain 4060mL blood sample. Separate white cell layer and radiolabel in
vitro using 99mTc exametazine (HMPAO) or 111In oxine. Re-inject labelled
cells IV. Image 1 and 3h later (inflammatory bowel disease) or 2, 4 and 24h
for intra-abdominal sepsis/osteomyelitis. 99mTc exametazine (HMPAO)
preferred for routine imaging and inflammatory bowel diseaselower
radiation dose and earlier result than 111In oxine label.
Results
Physiological uptake in reticuloendothelial system. Variable GI and renal
excretion, depending on radiopharmaceutical used.
Interpretation
Focal 4 uptake indicates sepsis. Diffuse 4 gut uptake reflects extent and
activity of inflammatory bowel disease.
Advantages
Very sensitive in inflammatory bowel disease. Non-invasive, useful in sick
patients, e.g. acute exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease.
Pitfalls
2 False ves: leucopenia and poor white cell label, perihepatic and perisplenic collections obscured by normal liver and spleen uptake.
2 False +ves: physiological gut and renal activity.
2 Damaged white cells during labelling causing lung sequestration.

Glomerular filtration rate
measurement
Indications
Accurate GFR to monitor renal failure, cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunosuppression, e.g. cyclosporin.
Patient preparation
Well hydrated.
Procedure
IV injection of 51Cr EDTA or 99mTc DTPA.
Venous sampling 2 and 4h later.
Count plasma sample radioactivity in gamma counter. Correct for
height and weight.

2
2
2

Results
Normal GFR = 125mL/min.
Interpretation
5 values in CRF.
Advantages
More reliable and reproducible than creatinine clearanceavoids need
for urine collection.
Pitfalls
Accuracy depends on good injection techniqueavoid any extravasation.
Unreliable results in severe peripheral oedema.

Urea breath test
Indications
Helicobacter pylori detectiondiagnosis and confirmation of eradication.
Patient preparation
Stop antibiotics, H2 antagonists and, proton pump inhibitors for 24
weeks.
Procedure
Patient swallows urea drink labelled with 13carbon (stable isotope) or
14
carbon (radioactive isotope). Breath samples (CO2) collected over next
30min. Labelled CO2 measured by mass spectroscopy (13C) or liquid scintillation counting (14C).
Results
Normal range varies according to local protocol.

578

Interpretation
Increased exhaled CO2 levels imply abnormal urea breakdown by ureaseproducing bacteria in stomach, e.g. H. pylori.

14 Nuclear medicine
Advantages
Very sensitive marker of active H. pylori infection ( Serology (p268)).
Non-invasive ( Endoscopy (p346)) and avoids sampling errors. Good for
non-invasive monitoring of recurrent symptoms.
Pitfalls
Occasional false +ves in oral H. pylori infection.

B12 absorption studies
Indications
Vitamin B12 malabsorption; pernicious anaemia.
Patient preparation
Investigate before initiating B12 therapy where possible. Otherwise, avoid
B12 supplements for 1 month prior to investigation.
Procedure
Two techniques are available:
1. Administer 57cobalt-B12 PO. Measure retention using gamma camera
or whole body counter at 7 days. Normal retention >50%.
2. Give 1mg IM B12 then PO. Collect all urine for 24h. Measure 57CO-B12
excretion. Normal excretion 1440%. If normal results, B12 malabsorption is excluded. If abnormal, repeat whole procedure using 57Co-B12
and 100mg intrinsic factor PO. Calculate retention/excretion ratio for
57
Co-B12 + IF versus 57Co-B12 alone.
Results
Retention method
Normal ratio 57Co-B12 + IF: 57Co-B12 + IF <1.8.
Urinary method
Normal ratio 57Co-B12 +IF: 57Co-B12 + IF = 0.71.2.
Interpretation
2 5 57Co-B12 levels indicate B12 malabsorption.
2 Intrinsic factor corrects B12 absorption in pernicious anaemia, i.e. 57CoB12 + IF: to 57Co-B12 ratio rises.
Advantages
Non-invasive. Only available technique.
Pitfalls
Urine excretion methodincomplete urine collection invalidates result.
Severe GI atrophymay invalidate IF response.
579

Ferrokinetic studies
Indications
2 Unexplained, refractory anaemia.
2 Abnormal iron metabolism.
Patient preparation
None.
Procedure
Inject 59Fe-labelled transferrin IV.
Measure activity over liver, spleen, sacrum and heart using gamma
probe daily for 14 days.
2 Measure blood 59Fe clearance daily for 14 days.
2 Calculate plasma iron clearance, plasma iron turnover (mol/L/day)
and iron utilisation.
2 Organ 59Fe uptake/clearance curve identifies extramedullary
haemopoiesis.
2
2

Results
Normal plasma iron clearance half-time = 60120min.
Normal iron utilisation at 14 days = 80%.
Normal iron turnover = 70140 mol/L/day.

2
2
2

Interpretation
Haemolysis4 plasma iron turnover, utilisation and marrow activity.
Myelofibrosis4 splenic uptake compared with marrow.
Aplasiaprolonged plasma iron clearance, low utilisation and hepatic
accumulation.

2
2
2

Advantages
Only technique available for iron metabolism.
Pitfalls
Lengthy and labour-intensive. Consistent probe positioning essential for
accurate organ uptake curves.

Red cell survival studies
Indications
2 Haemolytic anaemia (to confirm 5 RBC survival, i.e. active haemolysis).
2 Localise abnormal red cell sequestration.
2 Predict response to splenectomy.
Patient preparation
None. Avoid blood transfusion during study.
Procedure

580 Label patients red cells with 51Cr chromate. Re-inject cells and measure
blood activity over 14 days using gamma counter. Measure activity over
liver, spleen and heart using gamma probe daily for 14 days.
Results
2 Normal red cell half-life >24 days.

14 Nuclear medicine
2

Equal fall in heart, liver and spleen counts with time.

Interpretation
Short red cell life confirms abnormal destruction. Ratio of counts in
liver : spleen indicates site of red cell destruction.
Advantages
Only available technique.
Pitfalls
Lengthy and labour-intensive. Sensitivity reduced by blood transfusion
during 14-day measurement period. Consistent probe positioning essential for accurate organ sequestration curves.

Red cell volume/plasma volume
measurement
Indications
Polycythaemia, to distinguish between true polycythaemia (4 RBC mass)
from apparent polycythaemia (5 plasma volume).
Patient preparation
Avoid recent therapeutic venesection. Less sensitive in patients already
receiving myelosuppressive therapy.
Procedure
Block thyroid using potassium iodide/iodate.
Obtain 10mL venous blood.
Separate plasma and red cells.
Radiolabel red cells using 99mTc/51Cr and plasma using 125I albumin.
Re-inject radiolabelled blood.
Obtain venous samples at 15 and 30min.
Count activity in blood samples compared with known standards using
gamma counter to establish plasma and red cell volumes.

2
2
2
2
2
2
2

Results
Compare measured red cell mass and plasma volume with predicted
values for height and weight.
Interpretation
Distinguish relative polycythaemia (due to 5 plasma volume) from genuine
elevation of red cell mass.
Advantages
Only technique available.
Pitfalls
Recent venesection or myelosuppressive therapy reduces test reliability.
Plasma volume measurement unreliable in severe peripheral oedema.

581

Bile salt deconjugation studies
Indications
Bacterial overgrowth; bile salt malabsorption.
Patient preparation
Starve overnight. Avoid antibiotics for 1 month before study.
Procedure
Give oral 14Ca-labelled glycocholic acid in water. Count 14CO2 activity in
breath samples over 6h using beta liquid scintillation counter.
Results
Glycocholate is deconjugated into 14C glycine and cholic acid by small
intestine bacteria releasing expired 14CO2. Correct result for age-related
variations in endogenous 14CO2 production.
Interpretation
4 14CO2 levels imply bacterial colonisation or bile salt malabsorption.
Advantages
Accurate. Only available test.
Pitfalls
False ves unusual.

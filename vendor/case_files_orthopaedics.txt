ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The clerkship curriculum that evolved into the ideas for this series was inspired by
two talented and forthright students, Philbert Yao and Chuck Rosipal, who have
since graduated from medical school. It has been a tremendous joy to work with
the excellent orthopaedic surgery residents and faculty members at Albany Medical
Center and Hospital for Special Surgery. They have been some of the most diligent,
astute, and wonderfully responsive group with whom I have collaborated. I am greatly
indebted to my editor, Catherine Johnson, whose exuberance, experience, and vision
helped to shape this series. I appreciate McGraw-Hill’s believing in the concept of
teaching through clinical cases, and I would like to especially acknowledge John
Williams, the director of editing. I am also thankful to Tania Andrabi for her excellent production expertise.
Without my dear colleagues Drs. Konrad Harms, Priti Schachel, and Gizelle
Brooks-Carter, this book could not have been written. At Methodist Hospital,
I appreciate Dr. Marc Boom, Dr. Judy Paukert, and Dr. Alan Kaplan. I also appreciate Debby Chambers, an excellent administrator, who is extremely supportive to the
mission of education. Most of all, I appreciate my ever-loving wife Terri and my four
wonderful children, Andy, Michael, Allison, and Christina, for their patience and
understanding.

INTRODUCTION

Mastering the cognitive knowledge within a field such as orthopaedic surgery is a
formidable task. It is even more difficult to draw on that knowledge, procure and
filter through the clinical and laboratory data, develop a differential diagnosis, and
finally form a rational treatment plan. To gain these skills, the student often learns
best at the bedside, guided and instructed by experienced teachers, and inspired
toward self-directed, diligent reading. Clearly, there is no replacement for education
at the bedside or operating room. Unfortunately, clinical situations usually do not
encompass the breadth of the specialty. Perhaps the best alternative is a carefully
crafted patient case designed to stimulate the clinical approach and decision making. In an attempt to achieve that goal, we have constructed a collection of clinical
vignettes to teach diagnostic or therapeutic approaches relevant to pediatrics. Most
importantly, the explanations for the cases emphasize the mechanisms and underlying principles, rather than merely rote questions and answers.
This book is organized for versatility: It allows the student “in a rush” to go quickly
through the scenarios and check the corresponding answers, while allowing the student who wants more thought-provoking explanations to go at a more measured
pace. The answers are arranged from simple to complex: a summary of the pertinent
points, the bare answers, an analysis of the case, an approach to the topic, a comprehension test at the end for reinforcement and emphasis, and a list of resources
for further reading. The clinical vignettes are purposely placed in random order to
simulate the way that real patients present to the practitioner. A listing of cases is
included in Section III to aid the student who desires to test his or her knowledge of
a specific area or who wants to review a topic, including basic definitions. Finally, we
intentionally did not primarily use a multiple-choice question format in our clinical
case scenarios because clues (or distractions) are not available in the real world. Nevertheless, several multiple-choice comprehension questions are included at the end
of each case discussion to reinforce concepts or introduce related topics.

HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS BOOK
Each case is designed to simulate a patient encounter with open-ended questions.
At times, the patient’s complaint is different from the most concerning issue, and
sometimes extraneous information is given. The answers are organized into four
different parts:

PART I
1.

Summary: The salient aspects of the case are identiﬁed, ﬁltering out the extraneous information. Students should formulate their summary from the case
before looking at the answers. A comparison to the summation in the answer
will help to improve their ability to focus on the important data while appropriately discarding the irrelevant information—a fundamental skill in clinical
problem solving.

xx

INTRODUCTION

2.

A Straightforward Answer is given to each open-ended question.

3.

The Analysis of the Case is composed of two parts:
a. Objectives of the Case: A listing of the two or three main principles that
are crucial for a practitioner to manage the patient. Again, the students are
challenged to make educated “guesses” about the objectives of the case upon
initial review of the case scenario, which helps to sharpen their clinical and
analytical skills.
b. Considerations: A discussion of the relevant points and brief approach to
the speciﬁc patient.

PART II
Approach to the Disease Process consists of two distinct parts:
a. Deﬁnitions: Terminology pertinent to the disease process.
b. Clinical Approach: A discussion of the approach to the clinical problem in
general, including tables, ﬁgures, and algorithms.

PART III
Comprehension Questions: Each case contains several multiple-choice questions,
which reinforce the material or introduce new and related concepts. Questions about
material not found in the text have explanations in the answers.

PART IV
Clinical Pearls: Several clinically important points are reiterated as a summation of
the text. This allows for easy review, such as before an examination.

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

Part 1. Approach to the Orthopaedic Patient
The transition from textbook learning to the application of information in a specific clinical situation is one of the most challenging tasks in medicine. It requires
retention of information, organization of the facts, and recall of a myriad of data in
precise application to the patient. The purpose of this book is to facilitate this process. The first step is gathering information, also known as establishing the database.
This includes taking the history; performing the physical examination; obtaining
selective imaging, such as plain x-rays; and ordering laboratory studies. Of these,
the historical examination is the most important and useful. Sensitivity and respect
should always be exercised during interactions with patients.

HISTORY
1. Basic information:
a. Age and sex: It may seem obvious, but the age and sex of the orthopaedic
patient is of tremendous diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic importance.
For example, a first-time shoulder dislocation in a male less than 20 years of
age is bound to recur at a rate of greater than 80%, whereas a first shoulder
dislocation in a female greater than 40 years of age will only recur approximately 10% of the time.
b. Chief complaint: What has brought the patient to your office? Urgent care
clinic? Trauma bay? Has the patient suffered an acute traumatic injury, or
has the patient been referred to you for chronic symptoms of several months
in duration? Perhaps the most common complaint to orthopaedic physicians
is pain. At a minimum, the acuity, severity, location, temporality, presence
of associated symptoms, and relieving and exacerbating factors for any complaint of pain should be noted.
• Acute trauma: In acute, high-energy traumatic situations, it is essential
to carefully follow Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol to
optimize patient survival and minimize morbidity. In many hospitals, traumatic scenarios are managed by emergency department physicians and
trauma surgical teams. Orthopaedic surgeons play a vital, if supportive, role
in acute life support management. After ensuring stability of the patient’s
airway, breathing, cardiovascular system, cerebral perfusion, and environment, the orthopaedist must work to stabilize major fractures, reduce dislocations, attenuate bleeding, provisionally irrigate contaminated lesions,
and assess neurovascular deficits.
• Mechanism of injury: In traumatic situations, whether low-energy falls from
standing height or high-energy motor vehicular collisions (MVC), orthopaedic physicians must make special note of the mechanism of injury. Both the
patient’s positioning during injury and the direction of forces acting on the
patient play a key role in the classification, treatment, and prognosis of many
different types of orthopaedic injuries. In fact, several fracture classification
systems are based on the very mechanism of injury, including high-energy,

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

3

high-mortality pelvic fractures and comparatively lower energy “everyday”
ankle fractures. For patients injured in MVCs, note whether the patient was
wearing a seat belt. Likewise, was the motorcyclist wearing a helmet? Does the
patient recall the accident, or did he or she lose consciousness? In the elderly
especially, a hip fracture may represent more than just a broken bone. Such
patients often fall as a result of syncope or presyncope, secondary to underlying cardiac and/or neurologic conditions. The fall may be the first presentation of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or Alzheimer dementia.
• Chronic symptomatology: In patients with chronic symptomatology,
the physician must work to carefully characterize the patient’s symptoms
with regard to acuity, severity, location, temporality, presence of associated symptoms, and relieving and exacerbating factors. At this point, the
clinician may begin to generate a list of differential diagnoses that further
inquiry, examination, and testing will narrow.
• Concomitant injuries: Does the patient have any other complaints? Does
the patient complain of neck pain after crashing the car? Is the patient
intoxicated? Patients under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or simply as
secondary to a sympathetic response to the injury, may not immediately recognize a painful injury. This is especially true in patients with multiple distracting injuries. When evaluating the cervical spine, it is essential to rule
out distracting injuries, as a painful broken femur may distract the patient
from a vague neck ache, the result of an unstable ligamentous injury.
c. Past medical history: First, any history of systemic illnesses such as diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and crystalloid, rheumatoid, and seronegative arthritis must be investigated. Primarily musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis and histories of fracture,
sprains, strains, tears, and infections should also be elicited.
d. Past surgical history: Does the patient have a history of fracture fixation, joint
replacement, spinal decompression, or other procedures, recent or distant,
that may influence his or her management? A detailed knowledge of previous orthopaedic treatments is paramount for planning new interventions. For
example, an acute periprosthetic femoral shaft fracture around a previous hip
replacement is treated differently from hip fracture in a native (normal) joint.
Although the patient without a history of joint replacement may benefit from
an intramedullary rod, the canal is partially occupied by the prosthesis in the
patient with the history of joint replacement, making intramedullary fixation
impossible without an extensive revision of components. For any patient
undergoing surgery on or around a previous orthopaedic implant, it is important
to obtain documentation of the type of implant used, its size, manufacturer, and
both when and by whom it was placed.
e. Family history: Inquire about a history a familial degenerative, metabolic
bone, or connective tissue disorders. In patients with arthritis, for example,
be certain to ask about a familial history of rheumatoid and autoimmune
diseases, as these conditions may have a familial predilection. Such information
may help target your differential diagnosis.

4

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

f. Social history: Does the patient abuse tobacco? Does the patient drink
alcohol? If so, how much and for how long? Does the patient use illicit
substances? Nicotine is a significant inhibitor of both wound and bone
healing; in a study of open tibial shaft fractures, injuries took almost
70% longer to heal in smokers versus nonsmokers. Nicotine also has
been shown to increase the rate of nonunion, or failed healing of bone.
Inquire about the patient’s vocation, hobbies, physical activities, and
hand dominance. A high-performance college athlete, for example, may
benefit more from an elective anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair
than a 53-year-old concert pianist who spends most of her time sitting.
The same concert pianist may require surgical reduction and fixation of
a nondominant comminuted distal radius fracture versus the same fracture in an 86-year-old nonambulator for whom cast fixation is adequate.
g. Allergies: Inquire about previous reactions to medications, and be certain to
distinguish between true hypersensitivity and adverse responses. A distant
memory of “stomach upset” from penicillin is not necessarily reason to compromise on an effective, first-line antibiotic.
h. Medications: As usual, careful documentation of medications both past and
present is important. Note dosages, durations of treatment, and indications
when unclear. Pay special attention to history of steroids, bisphosphonate,
anticoagulant, and antibiotic use, as these medications frequently influence
perioperative management.
i. Review of systems: A general review of symptomatology is important in assessing the orthopaedic patient. Has the patient with knee pain been experiencing
fevers and chills, suggestive of a septic joint? Has the patient concerned with
insidious back pain been experiencing unintended weight loss and night sweats,
representative, perhaps, of a vertebral body metastasis from an unknown primary
tumor? Such diagnoses may be missed if a review of systems is not performed.

PHYSICAL EXAM
1. Vital signs: Note the patient’s temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation. Height, weight, and body mass
index should also be considered.
2. General appearance: Note whether the patient is cachectic versus wellnourished, anxious versus calm, alert versus obtunded, comfortable versus
distressed. Also note the patient’s ambulatory status, gait, posture, and stance.
Some clinicians argue that the physical exam “begins in the waiting room” as
they observe patients make their way to the examination room.
3. A basic approach to the musculoskeletal examination of the extremities:
Based on 5 elements: inspection, palpation, range of motion, neurovascular
evaluation, and special tests.
a. Inspection: The examination of any extremity should begin with inspection
of the limb for gross deformities, open fractures, skin defects, rashes, blisters,
burns, lacerations, or any other traumatic sequelae. Carefully survey the skin

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

5

for tenting in the setting of displaced fractures, as protruding bone fragments
can quickly erode through the skin, creating a delayed open fracture. Inspect
for symmetry, atrophy, or gross defects such as dislocations, angulations,
and rotational deformities. Note that a small skin “poke hole” injury from a
femoral shaft fracture represents a deceptively large soft tissue injury, as the
femur fragments must violate several inches of thick muscle, fascia, and skin
to pierce the surface.
b. Palpation: Palpate long bones for regions of tenderness, step-off, crepitus, and
swelling. Palpate joints for tenderness, crepitus, and effusions.
c. Range of motion: Evaluate range of motion, first passively, with the examiner
moving the patient’s limb through a range of motion, then actively, with the
patient moving his or her own limb through a complete range of motion.
Always compare the affected extremity to the contralateral side.
d. Neurovascular evaluation: Sensation and vascularity should be assessed.
Check for palpable pulses distally and for capillary refill at the finger or toe
pads. Reflex testing may be performed when appropriate. When relevant,
strength should be graded on a scale of 0 to 5:
0. No visible or palpable contraction
1. Any flicker of motion or visible and/or palpable muscle contraction
2. Full range of movement out of the plane of gravity
3. Full range of motion against gravity only
4. Full range of motion against some resistance, but weaker than expected
5. Normal strength
e. Special testing: Special tests, or tests specific to a certain joint, bony region,
or pathology, may next be performed. Details for special physical exam tests
are discussed later within pertinent clinical cases.
4. A basic approach to the examination of the spine: The spine has a complex
arrangement of integrated bony, muscular, ligamentous, nervous, vascular, and
other structures; understanding its anatomy is paramount to performing an
effective examination. Although there is considerable overlap between a basic
extremity and basic spine examination, the difference in the spine exam is the
neurologic focus on nerve root distributions of function. For example, a finding
of thumb and index finger weakness and numbness may represent ipsilateral C6
or C7 nerve root compression to a “tunnel-visioned” examiner who is focused
on the spine. To a hand surgeon, however, such a finding may be the result of
an undiagnosed carpel tunnel syndrome. The key to a good examination and
evaluation is being able to recognize the differential diagnosis for a particular
finding and narrow its potential etiologies accordingly.
a. Inspection: Inspect the spine for gross deformities, curvatures, skin defects,
and other additional pathology. In settings of trauma, observe the skull, both
anteriorly and posteriorly for evidence of blunt trauma, which may represent hyperextension and hyperflexion cervical injuries, respectively. From
behind the patient, look for asymmetric scapulae, deviation from a plumb line
(a median vertical line dropped from C7 by suspending a weight on a string),

6

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

and observe for rib humps when the patient is in a forward-bend position. In
newborns and infants, observe for defects such as dimples or tufts of hair, which
are suggestive of underlying congenital abnormalities such as spinal bifida.
b. Palpation: Similarly, palpate the spine for abnormal curvatures, areas of stepoff or prominences, or regions of tenderness. In patients with complaints of
pain, make sure to determine whether the tenderness is localized over bony
spinous processes or over paraspinal musculature. The former is suggestive
of bone pathology such as fracture or tumor. This is especially important
when clearing the cervical spine (C-spine) in traumatic scenarios. Although
the focus here is orthopaedic pathology, one should assess for other organic
causes of back pain such as renal pathology, suggested by costovertebral tenderness. Sacroiliac tenderness, elicited with pelvic compression or a FABER
maneuver (positioning the hip in flexion, abduction, external rotation and
pushing on the knee may induce pain with sacroiliac pathology), is suggestive of seronegative spondylopathies, whereas rheumatoid arthritis may
cause tenderness of the intervertebral joints.
c. Range of motion: Outside of an acute trauma scenarios, the patient should be
taken through an active range of motion including forward flexion, extension, lateral (sideways) bending, and rotation. Decreased range of motion with
an absence of significant pain may be indicative of generalized degenerative
process. A substantially decreased range of motion may be indicative of ankylosing spondylitis. Passive or physician-guided ranging of motion should be
avoided in the cervical spine, as this may lead to iatrogenic injury.
d. Neurovascular evaluation: For patients with concerns of spine pathology, a complete and thorough neurologic exam must be performed and carefully documented. Strength, graded 0 to 5, and sensation, graded 0 to 2 (0 = insensate,
1 = impaired, 2 = normal), should be evaluated in the major myo-dermatomal
distributions of the bilateral upper and lower extremity. Tables I–1 and I–2
show common muscular, sensory, and reflexive distributions of the major
nerve roots supplying the brachial and lumbar plexuses, respectively. For
patients with acute traumatic injuries to the spine, it is essential that motor
and sensory function be examined bilaterally throughout the body and
carefully documented at the time of initial presentation. For patients undergoing workup for radicular pain, chronic back pain, or similar degenerative
processes, physical exam findings should closely correlate with radiographic
findings if one hopes to have successful surgical outcomes. Clinical correlation is paramount, as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine has a
notoriously high false-positive rate in elderly individuals.
e. Special testing: Details for specific physical exam tests are discussed later
within pertinent clinical cases.
5. Clearing the cervical spine: In the setting of high-energy trauma or in patients
who have suffered blunt trauma to the head or neck, the cervical spine must be
immobilized provisionally to prevent potentially catastrophic neurologic injury.
Even if a patient does not initially complain of head, neck, or radicular pain,
intoxication and other injuries may distract from the sometimes subtle pains of

unstable cervical bony or ligamentous injury. For this reason, protocols exist to
guide physicians in “clearing” the C-spine (ie, safely discontinuing provisional
immobilization when there is no evidence to suggest an occult cervical spine
injury). In general, the elements necessary for clearing the C-spine include an
absence of posterior neck tenderness, an absence of focal neurologic deficits, a normal level of alertness, an absence of intoxication, an absence of distracting injuries,
and the ability of the patient to perform an active range of painless neck motion.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
1. X-ray: Also known as plain films or radiographs. At a minimum, 2 images
are acquired, taken in planes perpendicular to one another. These are usually
anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral views. For traumatic injuries, x-rays of the
joint above and below an area of interest should be obtained. Additionally,
many types of specialty views are obtained, depending on the region of interest.
A common example is the Mortise view of the ankle—an AP view with 15
degrees of internal rotation—which shows a smooth, uniform space between
the tibia/fibula and the underlying talus. In ankle fractures, widening or disruption of this normally uniform space may clearly demonstrate injuries.

2. Computed tomography (CT): CT is essentially a series of x-rays, reassembled by a computer into 3-dimensional images or “slices.” CT plays an integral role in assessing complex anatomy such as acetabular and spine fractures
and comminuted fractures and is often more sensitive than plain x-ray in
diagnosis of nondisplaced or healing fractures. CT also plays a role in preoperative planning.
3. Magnetic resonance imaging: MRI is an indispensible tool for evaluating soft
tissue structures such as ligaments, tendons, menisci, and nerves. When set to a
T2-weighted signal, physiologic processes resulting in edema and tissue inflammation, such as infection, autoimmune processes, bone or soft tissue injury, and
spinal cord or disc pathology, can be clearly visualized. MRI avoids ionizing
radiation and is considered safe to use in the absence of ferromagnetic implants
such as certain types orthopaedic hardware or cardiac pacemakers.
4. Ultrasound: Useful for detecting effusions, guiding needles for aspiration, evaluating for soft tissue abscesses or hematomas. Like MRI, ultrasound avoids ionizing radiation; it is frequently used in pediatric imaging.
5. Nuclear medicine scans: Bone scans, typically performed after administration
of intravenous radioisotope technetium-99m, are a helpful tool for detecting bone pathology such as osteomyelitis, tumor, or healing fracture. After
injection, the radioisotope localizes to regions of increased bony metabolic
activity and is observable on specialized image detectors. Similarly, radioisotope-tagged white blood cells may be used in a similar fashion. Known as a
tagged white blood cell scan, this modality is especially sensitive for detecting
osteomyelitis.
6. Dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan: DXA scanning is a radiographic method of measuring bone mineral density used in the diagnosis and
management of osteoporosis.

LABORATORY TESTS
1. Preoperative laboratory testing: Patients suffering from high-energy traumatic injuries and patients undergoing elective orthopaedic procedures should
undergo basic preoperative laboratory testing. This generally includes a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, blood type and screening, and the
basic coagulation tests, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time.
2. Inflammatory laboratory studies: Patients in whom infection is suspected
should receive testing for an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and
C-reactive protein (CRP). These are 2 nonspecific inflammatory markers
that may be used to assist with the diagnosis of, and to assess the efficacy of
therapy in, chronic bone or joint infections. In patients undergoing workup
for autoimmune disease, basic laboratory studies should minimally include
ESR, CRP, rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated protein, antinuclear antibody, and possibly HLA-B27 testing. Referral to a rheumatologic specialist is
generally recommended.

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

3. Synovial fluid analyses: Frequently, orthopaedists are confronted with erythematous, swollen, and painful joints that must be aspirated to confirm a
diagnosis. Synovial fluid should be sent for Gram stain, culture of aerobic and
anaerobic organisms, crystal analysis, and synovial fluid cell counts, including
white blood cell counts. The presence of bacteria on Gram stain is typically an
indication for surgical irrigation and debridement of the joint, as bacteria in a
closed joint can rapidly and irreversibly damage cartilage and other synovial
structures. Crystal analysis may help with the diagnosis of gout (uric acid crystals) or pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate crystals). Crystalloid arthropathy
are typically managed nonoperatively.
4. Urine pregnancy test (a-human chorionic gonadotropin): In women of childbearing age, it is important to eliminate the possibility of pregnancy when considering surgery or when exposing patients to ionizing radiation from x-rays,
CT, or radioisotope scans.

Part 2. Approach to Clinical Problem Solving
There are typically 4 distinct steps that an orthopaedic surgeon takes to solve most
clinical problems systematically:
1. Making the diagnosis
2. Assessing the severity of the disease or injury
3. Rendering a treatment based on the severity of the disease or injury
4. Following the patient’s response to the treatment

MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis is made by careful evaluation of the database, analysis of the information, assessment of the risk factors, and development of the list of possibilities (the
differential diagnosis). The process includes knowing which pieces of information are
meaningful and which may be thrown out. Experience and knowledge help to guide the
physician to “key in” on the most important possibilities. A good clinician also knows
how to ask the same question in several different ways and to use different terminology
when appropriate. For example, patients at times may outright deny having any “current medical problems” but will deliver a laundry list of insulins, beta-blockers, or antidepressants when asked about their current medications. Reaching a diagnosis may be
achieved by systematically reading about each possible cause and disease. The patient’s
presentation is then matched up against each of these possibilities, and each potential
diagnosis is either placed high up on the list as a potential etiology or moved lower
down because of the disease’s prevalence, the patient’s presentation, or other clues. A
patient’s risk factors may influence the probability of a diagnosis.
Although orthopaedic trauma diagnoses are seemingly straightforward fracture
identifications, concomitant symptoms such as weakness or paralysis, paresthesias,
or pulselessness may complicate the diagnosis of a “simple” fracture. An intimate
appreciation for both anatomy and physiology is required to generate the differential

10

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

diagnosis, even in the setting of acute trauma—could the patient with a proximal
tibia/fibula fracture and an inability to extend his great toe be experiencing paralysis from common peroneal nerve entrapment; from decreased effort, secondary to
extreme anxiety and discomfort; from neurovascular compromise, secondary to an
acute compartment syndrome; or from a yet undiscovered concomitant lumbar spine
injury?
For the patient in the office complaining of several days of shoulder or knee
pain, a long list of possible diagnoses can be pared down to 2 to 3 most likely diagnoses based on physical exam, selective imaging, and laboratory tests. For example,
a woman who complains of left knee pain and has a history of a meniscal tear may
have degenerative joint disease; another patient who has left knee pain and recent
fevers and chills may have a septic joint infection. Furthermore, a patient complaining
of left knee pain and a history of chronic steroid use for her Crohn disease may not
have true knee pathology at all, but rather referred pain from avascular necrosis of
the ipsilateral hip.

ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE
After ascertaining the diagnosis, the next step is to characterize the severity of the
disease process; in other words, describe “how bad” a disease is. Most commonly,
with traumatic injuries such as fractures and dislocations, this is done using a variety
of classification schemes.
To students and residents unfamiliar with fracture classification systems, it may
seem overly “academic” to call the broken ankle a “Lauge-Hansen S/ER-IV” or
the broken hip an “AO 31-B2.” However, classification systems play an important
role in communicating the location, mechanism, and severity of an injury while
simultaneously guiding its treatment. Classification schemes allow injuries to be
standardized for research purposes and allow physicians to deliver more accurate
prognoses to patients. The attending physician, hearing that the on-call resident
has reduced and splinted an S/ER IV ankle fracture, can instantly picture this
severe injury and can tell the resident to admit the patient for operative fixation
the following morning.
Chronic orthopaedic conditions should be stratified in the same way. Degenerative joint disease of the hip may be mild in nature and effectively treated with
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and activity modification; or it
may be severe, with the patient all but demanding a steroid injection or even a
joint replacement.

TREATMENT BASED ON SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE OR INJURY
Both the treatment and prognosis for virtually any given orthopaedic diagnosis
relates directly to its severity. For example, a closed tibial shaft fracture may be
treated in a cast if its alignment after reduction falls within certain radiographic
parameters. That same fracture, should it shift even a few millimeters, may need an
intramedullary rod down its center, or a plate placed on its side, to hold the tenuous reduction. Had the skin over the fracture been damaged during the injury, it
would have required urgent operative irrigation and debridement with concomitant

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

11

intramedullary rodding or placement into an external fixator. Had there been
a segment of bone lost during the injury, the patient may have required several
staged procedures with vascularized bone grafting, soft tissue flapping, or even bone
lengthening through an Ilizarov apparatus.
Orthopaedics is a broad field, with treatments ranging from quick splint application in the office to extensive and invasive procedures such as pelvic fracture
reductions and internal fixation. An overview of some basic orthopaedic treatments and some of their most common indications follows. Details regarding orthopaedic treatment indications, techniques, and outcomes are discussed in the cases
that follow.

Nonoperative Treatments
An orthopaedic reduction means simply to manipulate the bone or joint in such
a way that anatomic positioning is restored. The principles of immobilization are
simple: Hold the bones or tissues in, or as close to, their anatomic state to optimize
healing and to minimize stresses on surrounding tissues. In their most simplistic
form, most reduction maneuvers involve application of both axial traction and force
in the direction opposite to that of the mechanism of injury. For a dorsally angulated
distal radius fracture, for instance, reduction is performed by pulling axial traction
and by applying volar-directed force to return the angulated carpus to its correct
position. In general, immobilization should stabilize the joint above and below a
fracture. One should always attempt to restore length, rotation, and angulation.
1. Casting and splinting: Defined as the application of plaster, fiberglass, or similar materials to immobilize a particular region of the body. Casts are generally applied circumferentially around an affected body part, providing more
rigid and more durable immobilization. Splints may span and partially cover a
region, but they allow tissues to swell and are easily removed. Several common
casting techniques are detailed below; splints are applied similarly to these
methods.
a. Short arm cast: Applied from below the elbow to just proximal to the metacarpal-phalange joints at the midpalmar crease. These are generally indicated for reducible distal radius fractures. Short arm casts may be extended
to a thumb spica cast wherein the thumb is immobilized up to the interphalangeal joint.
b. Long arm cast: Similar distally to a short arm cast, but extends to the proximal third of the humerus with the elbow in approximately 90 degrees of
flexion. Generally indicated in pediatric forearm fractures because, unlike
short arm casts, it prevents rotation of the forearm by locking the wrist in the
same plane as the arm. Long arm casts can also be extended to thumb spica
casts and are thereby used to treat nondisplaced scaphoid fractures.
c. Short leg casts: Extends from the tibial tubercle to just proximal to the metatarsal-phalange joints. Typically indicated in the treatment of stable ankle
fractures. In general, it is important to dorsiflex the ankle to neutral, or
90 degrees with respect to the tibia, as prolonged plantar flexion may result
in an equinus contracture of the Achilles tendon.

12

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

d. Long leg cast: Similar to a short leg cast, but extends to the proximal thigh.
Typically indicated in the treatment of nonoperative tibial shaft fractures.
Like long arm casts, this cast effectively blocks rotation of the extremity.
The knee should be immobilized in 5 to 20 degrees of flexion.
e. Hand splinting: For immobilization of almost all metacarpal and phalanx
fractures. The metacarpal-phalange joints should be immobilized between
70 and 90 degrees of flexion to prevent stiffening and contracture. Interphalangeal joints are immobilized in extension. Together, this is referred to as the
“intrinsic plus” position because it mimics the hand position achieved with
contraction of the hand intrinsic muscles.
2. Bracing:
a. Knee immobilizer: A prefabricated brace extending from the mid-thigh to the
mid-leg that holds the knee in near-complete extension. Typically used to
stabilize knee dislocations, patella repairs, minimally displaced tibia plateau
fractures, and postoperative arthroscopy patients.
b. Sarmiento (functional) bracing: Typically consists of 2 pieces of halfcylindrical shells that strap together circumferentially around the site of
a humeral shaft fracture. Often used as definitive treatment for humeral
shaft fractures.
c. Bledsoe bracing: Hinged braces that attach above and below a joint (typically
the knee or elbow) to allow motion in a single plane. The desired degree of
motion may be preset. For example, an elbow Bledsoe brace may be set from
0 to 90 degrees of flexion to protect from the extremes of flexion/extension as
well as preventing varus/valgus forces in a postoperative distal humerus fracture.
3. Traction: Historically, many types of lower extremity fractures were treated
with the patient in traction and on prolonged bedrest. Hip fractures and femoral shaft fractures, for example, are commonly displaced as a result of strong
muscular deforming forces. Problems with hygiene, skin breakdown, and the
difficulty of maintaining reductions made casting of these injuries nearly
impossible. Therefore, such injuries were treated in traction, or with a constant,
controlled axial force that pulls fractures into alignment. Because the skin can
only tolerate limited prolonged pressure before breakdown occurs, traction
pins were commonly employed. Placed through the distal femoral metaphysis
or through the proximal tibia, large-diameter pins could transmit the traction
forces necessary to counter deforming muscular contractions. Modern intramedullary rodding, prostheses, and generally improved surgical techniques have
antiquated most indications for traction. However, traction is still used provisionally for patients awaiting definitive surgical fixation or for patients who are
not medically fit to undergo major fixation procedures. Halo immobilization
and Gardner-Well tong traction are another form of skeletal traction still in use
today. With pins placed firmly into the skull, axial traction may be applied to
the spine to assist in the reduction of injuries such as spinal facet dislocations,
immobilization of unstable cervical spine injuries, and sometimes in pediatric
patients to help correct scoliosis.

13

Operative Treatments
1. Fracture fixation:
a. Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF): One of the mainstays of orthopaedic
trauma surgery. Applies to virtually any situation in which a fracture site is
directly opened and the bones reduced and fixated with a variety of implants
such as screws, plates, wires, cement, and sutures.
b. Intramedullary nailing: Similar to ORIF; however, the implant goes directly
through the medullary canal, not on the surface of the bone. Furthermore,
ORIF generally requires direct reduction of fracture fragments, whereas the
fracture fragments in an intramedullary nailing procedure are typically indirectly reduced. Patients are sometimes surprised to hear that their scars will
be nowhere near the site of their actual fracture.
c. External fixation: External fixation is a method of temporarily stabilizing
fractures and/or joints in the setting of hemodynamic instability, significant
swelling, significant soft tissue injury, or other contraindications to primary
fixation. Pins are typically placed in the cortices above and below a fracture
site and then connected to an external frame that holds the alignment until
definitive fixation may take place. These are commonly employed in multitrauma scenarios in which a patient with multiple long bone fractures and
other organic injuries needs quick, temporary stabilization. Of course, if the
reduction is well-aligned and the fixator remains in place long enough,
external fixation may be the definitive treatment.
d. Percutaneous pinning: A method of fixing fractures using thin wires placed
through the skin under x-ray fluoroscopic guidance. Commonly used in settings such as hand fractures or supracondylar pediatric humerus fractures.
Casts or splints are used in conjunction with pin placement to support the
immobilized bone. After adequate callus formation, pins are typically pulled
out through the skin without the need for further fixation.
2. Arthroplasty: Arthroplasty means the reconstruction of a joint. Common
orthopaedic arthroplasty procedures involve the knee, hip, and shoulder,
although implants are available for many other joints in the body. Arthroplasty
is typically performed on an elective basis and is used as elective treatment for
patients with severe degenerative joint disease and some cases of inflammatory
arthritis. Elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures may undergo
primary arthroplasty as definitive treatment for their fracture because attempted
repair of the fragments has a very high incidence of failure.
3. Arthroscopy: Arthroscopy simply refers to the minimally invasive technique of
using a camera to evaluate and treat intraarticular pathology. Common arthroscopic
procedures include diagnostic explorations, meniscal debridements, removal of
loose bodies, ligamentous repairs such as ACL reconstructions, and tendinous/joint
capsule reconstructions. Thanks to the minimally invasive approach, procedures
are often performed on an outpatient basis.

14

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

FOLLOWING THE RESPONSE TO TREATMENT
The final step in the approach to disease is to follow the patient’s response to
therapy. The “measure” of response should be monitored and documented. Some
responses are clinical, such as improvement, or lack thereof, in a patient’s subjective joint pain, activity level, range of motion, and strength. The physician must
be skilled at eliciting this subjective data in an unbiased and standardized manner.
Fractures, whether treated operatively or nonoperatively, are typically followed
with serial x-rays. Intervals between imaging often vary with regard to the nature
of the injury: A lateral malleolar ankle fracture treated in a cast is likely to remain
stable and may require only biweekly imaging until there is clear evidence of bony
healing. By contrast, a comminuted distal radius fracture treated in a cast has
a much greater propensity to collapse and may need close monitoring if it is to
be treated nonoperatively. Patients with conditions such as chronic osteomyelitis
may require 6 to 8 weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment, during which serial
ESR and CRP studies help the clinician determine the duration and efficacy of
treatment.

Part 3. Approach to Reading
The clinical problem-oriented approach to reading is different from the classic “systematic” research of a disease. Outside of isolated traumatic injuries, patients rarely
present with a clear diagnosis; hence the clinician-in-training must become skilled
in applying textbook information to the clinical setting. Furthermore, the reader
retains more information when reading with a purpose. In other words, one should
read with the goal of answering specific questions. Likewise, the clinician-in-training
should have a plan for the acquisition and use of the information. The process is
similar to having a mental “flow chart,” with each step sifting through diagnostic
possibilities, risk factors, therapies, and potential complications. There are several
fundamental questions that facilitate clinical thinking:
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What should be the next step?
• What is the most likely mechanism for this injury or condition?
• What are the risk factors for this injury or condition?
• How is the diagnosis confirmed?
• What is the best therapy?
• What complications are associated with this injury or condition and its
treatment?

WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY DIAGNOSIS?
The method of establishing the diagnosis has been covered in the previous section. One
way of attacking this problem is to develop standard “approaches” to common clinical

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

15

situations. It is helpful to recognize the most common presentation of a given disease.
For example, the most common cause of knee effusion is degenerative joint disease.
The clinical scenario would be something such as:
A 50-year-old overweight female is referred to your office with complaints of right knee
pain and swelling.
With no other information to go on, the student would note that this patient has a
painful knee effusion. Using “most common cause” information, the clinician would
make an educated guess that the patient has degenerative joint disease.
However, what if the scenario also included the following phrase?
The right knee is mildly erythematous and warm to the touch.
Now the most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory arthritis. Degenerative joint disease rarely presents with inflammatory signs such as localized redness or warmth.

WHAT SHOULD BE THE NEXT STEP?
This question is difficult because the next step has many possibilities; the answer may
be to obtain more diagnostic information, to stage the illness, or to introduce therapy.
The next step is often a more challenging question than “What is the most likely
diagnosis?” because there may be insufficient information to make a diagnosis, and
thus the next step may be to pursue additional diagnostic testing. Another possibility
is that there is enough information for a probable diagnosis, and thus the next step
is to stage the disease or to administer treatment. Hence from clinical data, a judgment must be rendered regarding where one falls on the “make a diagnosis → stage
the disease → treat based on stage → follow the response” continuum. Frequently,
students and training clinicians are taught to “regurgitate” information that someone
has written about a particular disease, but they are not yet skilled at determining the
next step. This talent is learned optimally at the bedside, in a supportive environment, with freedom to make educated guesses, and with constructive feedback. The
sample scenario that follows describes one’s thought process through a case of lower
back pain:
• Make the diagnosis: “Based on the information available, I believe that this
48-year-old male has a right-sided acutely herniated nucleus pulposus at L4-5.
This is based on right-sided lateral leg and shin paresthesias, an isolated EHL
weakness of 4/5, and a positive straight leg raise test.”
• Stage the disease: “I don’t believe that this is severe disease, since he does not
have progressive symptoms, bowel/bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, profound or bilateral weakness, or constitutional symptoms suggestive of infection
or malignancy.”
• Treat based on stage: “Therefore, my next step is to treat him with NSAIDs,
acetaminophen, activity modification, and a muscle relaxant.”
• Follow the response: “I want to follow the treatment by assessing his pain and
clinical exam. I will reassess him in 1 week.”

16

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

In a similar patient, when the clinical presentation is more immediately concerning—
for example if the patient were experiencing urinary retention and profound
weakness in his bilateral lower extremities—the next step would likely be diagnostic
in nature, such as an MRI of the lumbosacral spine to evaluate for cauda equina
syndrome. Finally, if given an MRI showing a large centrally-herniated lumbar disc,
the next step would be emergency surgical decompression.

WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY MECHANISM FOR THIS INJURY
OR CONDITION?
This question goes further than making the diagnosis, requiring the clinician to
understand the underlying mechanism behind the process. For example, a clinical
scenario may describe a 61-year-old female who becomes hypoxic during an intramedullary rodding procedure for a femur fracture. The surgeon must first recognize
fat embolism syndrome, which may occur intraoperatively during the intramedullary
reaming of long bones. Then, the surgeon must understand the process by which
the reamer disseminates the intramedullary fat into the bloodstream, leading to the
mechanical obstruction of pulmonary blood flow and the triggering of a secondary
inflammatory response in which platelets and erythrocytes aggregate and cause a
localized toxic injury to the pulmonary vascular endothelium. Students and junior
clinicians are advised to learn the mechanisms by which common injuries are created. Ankle fractures, for example, are often classified by the direction of the force
acting on the ankle and the position of the foot during injury. If the foot is supinated
during a low-energy external rotation injury, one is more likely to injure the lateral
malleolus or disrupt the lateral ankle ligaments. Conversely, if the foot is pronated
during the same external rotation injury, one is more likely to suffer injury to the
medial malleolus or deltoid ligaments.

WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR THIS INJURY
OR CONDITION?
Understanding the risk factors for certain conditions helps the practitioner establish
a diagnosis and determine how to interpret tests. For example, understanding the
risk for osteonecrosis after a 4-part fracture of the proximal humerus may direct the
surgeon to perform a primary shoulder hemiarthroplasty instead of fixing the fracture with plates, sutures, and screws. In an older individual with a history of osteoporosis, multiple medical comorbidities, and tobacco use, surgeons may opt to perform
a primary partial replacement instead of attempting fixation. In younger individuals
with the same injury, open reduction and internal fixation may be attempted, as
younger patients will typically have better bone stock and blood supply than their
older counterparts. Additionally, younger individuals have higher physical demands
than are typically tolerated by current shoulder prostheses.

HOW IS THE DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMED?
Although confirming the diagnosis of a traumatic fracture may be as simple as acquiring an x-ray of the affected bone, many injuries and diseases relevant to orthopaedics

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

17

have complicated workups and diagnoses that physicians-in-training must be familiar
with. In a young patient with complaints of snuffbox tenderness after a fall onto an
outstretched arm, obtaining x-rays of the wrist with scaphoid views is typically the next
step in diagnosis. However, what if the x-rays are negative, despite the telltale history
and physical exam findings? Occult fractures of the scaphoid are treated in spica casts
with follow-up x-rays at 1 to 2 weeks from injury to identify evidence of healing fracture. If symptoms persist despite negative films, an MRI or bone scan may be performed
to confirm the diagnosis of an occult fracture. Clinicians-in-training should strive to
know the indications for—and limits of—diagnostic tests, not just in the setting of
traumatic injuries, but for many types of common bone and joint conditions.

WHAT IS THE BEST THERAPY?
To answer this question, the clinician needs to reach the correct diagnosis and assess
the severity of the condition, and then he or she must weigh the situation to reach
the appropriate intervention. For the student and even junior-most residents, knowing exact steps of a surgical procedure is not as important as understanding the operative and nonoperative treatment options, identifying the best possible treatment,
and recognizing its potential complications. It is essential for the training surgeon
to be able to concisely and clearly verbalize the diagnosis and communicate his or
her rationale for a proposed therapy. A common error is for students and residents to
“jump” to a surgical treatment, almost like a random guess, and to therefore receive
only “right or wrong” feedback when all of the logical steps in the management
process are not completely understood. A guess at a proposed treatment may well
be correct, but for the wrong reason; conversely, the student’s “shot-down” answer
may actually be a very reasonable one, with only a small misstep in thinking along
the way. Injuries or conditions and their proposed treatments should be presented
in a stepwise, logical fashion so that feedback may be received at each decision
point.

WHAT COMPLICATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INJURY
OR CONDITION AND ITS TREATMENT?
Clinicians must be cognizant of the complications of a disease, so that they will
understand how to follow and monitor the patient. Sometimes, the training physician will have to make the diagnosis from clinical clues and then apply his or her
knowledge of the consequences of the pathologic process. For example, a woman
who presents with a comminuted both bone forearm fracture after a fall from a balcony is at significant risk for developing a compartment syndrome in the short term,
as well as developing forearm synostosis or complications from Volkmann ischemia
in the long term. Furthermore, the gold standard treatment—open reduction internal fixation of the radius and ulna with plates and screws—has several associated
complications of its own, including posttraumatic synostosis, infection, and neurovascular injury. Physicians must be mindful of the potential complications arising
from certain conditions or injuries—for example, which types of fractures are at
significant risk for developing, say, a compartment syndrome and thus need to

18

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

be monitored every few hours versus those that may be admitted and addressed
the following morning. A basic knowledge of complications after both operative
and nonoperative therapies for a variety of orthopaedic conditions is paramount.
Of course, whenever possible, potential complications should be discussed with
patients before intervention.

CLINICAL PEARLS


There is no substitute for a meticulous history and physical examination.



There are 4 steps to the clinical approach to the patient: making the diagnosis, assessing its severity, treating based on severity, and following the
response.



Remember to distinguish between pain, a subjective complaint, and tenderness, an objective finding on physical exam.



In virtually all trauma situations, the physician must never assess passive
range of motion for the cervical spine; active, or patient-driven, range of
motion for the cervical spine may be permitted in certain situations.



Herniated discs may present with a variety of nonspecific physical exam
findings such as tenderness to palpation over spinous processes, paravertebral musculature, the sciatic notch, and the sciatic nerve.



Be mindful of Waddell signs when examining a potentially malingering
patient. These include pain out of proportion (to light touch), a lack of contralateral hip extensor effort when attempting a straight leg raise, nonanatomic
distributions of symptoms, and exaggerated responses or overreactions.



To clinically clear the cervical spine after trauma, the patient must be
sober, without focal neurologic deficit, midline tenderness, or distracting
injury; have a normal level or alertness; and be able to actively range his or
her neck through a complete range of painless motion.



Casts, whether applied to an arm or a leg, should end short of the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, respectively. In general, the
patient should be able to move his or her fingers and/or toes within the cast.



When placing traction pins in the distal femur, one should start medially
to gain the most control over the pin near the superficial femoral artery.
When placing a proximal tibial traction pin, one should start laterally to
best control the pin around the common peroneal nerve.



Both nailing and rodding are interchangeable terms describing an intramedullary fixation technique. A technical difference does exist in that nails
are tapered at their end, whereas rods are cylindrical.

CASE 1
A 20-year-old, right-hand-dominant male athlete, the star wide receiver on his collegiate football team, had just caught the game-winning touchdown. As his teammates gathered around him to celebrate, they noticed that he was clutching his right
shoulder and appeared to be in a great deal of pain. Soon after, in the emergency
department (ED), he refused to let anyone move his right arm from its current position of slight abduction and external rotation. The team physician notes that the front
of his shoulder appears “full” and that the acromion is prominent in comparison with
the contralateral side. He has a strong radial pulse, and sensation to light touch is
intact throughout the whole extremity. He refuses a motor exam. An anteroposterior
(AP) radiograph of the shoulder is obtained by the ED and is seen in Figure 1–1.

ANSWERS TO CASE 1:
Anterior Shoulder Dislocation
Summary: A 20-year-old athlete sustained trauma to the right shoulder resulting in
obvious deformity and pain, with an AP radiograph of the right shoulder demonstrating a dislocation and osseous defect of the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head.
• Most likely diagnosis: Anteroinferior glenohumeral dislocation
• Radiographic abnormality: These plain films depict a right glenohumeral dislocation and a Hill-Sachs lesion, which is an indentation fracture of the posterolateral humeral head caused by impaction on the anterior glenoid rim after
anterior glenohumeral dislocation.
• Associated physical exam findings: Deltoid spasm/dysfunction, positive apprehension and/or crank test, 3+ sulcus sign, rotator cuff tear (especially in older
patients), clicking/catching during movement, positive load-shift test, Bankart
lesion, and other bony abnormalities of the humerus and/or glenoid rim.
• Best treatment: Prompt closed reduction, if acutely dislocated; nonoperative
immobilization in external rotation versus operative Bankart repair (open
or arthroscopic), possible bone fragment incorporation, and possible glenoid
augmentation, if indicated.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the anatomic structures that serve as stabilizers of the glenohumeral
joint.
2. Be familiar with the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and initial management
of anterior shoulder dislocations.
3. Understand the clinical indications for operative stabilization procedures.

Considerations
The 20-year-old football player has just sustained his third traumatic anterior
shoulder dislocation requiring urgent reduction. Although patients with a history
of repeated dislocations may recognize what has happened, a thorough history,
exam, and workup should be performed. Special attention must be directed to the
patient’s neurovascular exam—both before and after reduction—as the dislocation may cause neurovascular damage. This is more commonly observed in the
elderly. The decision of whether to obtain radiographs of the dislocated shoulder or
proceed directly to closed reduction is often governed by the unique circumstances
of each case. Individuals with a history of dislocations and high pain tolerance may
tolerate immediate reductions. Others may need sedation. After the joint is reduced
and the reduction confirmed radiographically, the next step should be to investigate

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

the patient’s history of recurrent shoulder dislocations. Factors such as time between
events, management of the initial dislocation, and circumstances surrounding each
dislocation are especially important. This information will guide both the short-term
and long-term management of the patient. The patient described in the vignette
would typically be a candidate for further workup and operative stabilization if clinically warranted.

APPROACH TO:
Anterior Shoulder Dislocation
DEFINITIONS
SHOULDER LAXITY: A clinical exam finding referring to the ability of the
humeral head to translate on the glenoid. Laxity varies significantly between individuals and is only considered pathologic if it is accompanied with additional symptomatology such as pain.
SHOULDER INSTABILITY: A pathologic state associated with painful, excessive translation of the shoulder. Instability, unlike asymptomatic laxity, should be
considered for treatment.
BANKART LESION: The most common sequelae of an anterior shoulder dislocation (up to 85% of cases). Bankart lesions are described as detachment of the anteroinferior labrum from the glenoid rim, accompanied by detachment of the inferior
glenohumeral ligament from its glenoid origin. Described as a bony Bankart lesion
when the glenoid rim itself fractures in lieu of a labral detachment.
HILL-SACHS LESION: An osteochondral depression in the posterior humeral
head caused by impaction of the head on the anterior glenoid during anterior dislocation. If severe, Hill-Sachs lesions may contribute to recurrent instability.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
The glenohumeral joint is the most mobile and most commonly dislocated joint in
the human body. Dislocations in the anterior direction are by far the most frequently
occurring, representing up to 90% of all shoulder dislocations. Posterior dislocations
are significantly less common and may be more insidious in presentation. Rarer still
are inferior dislocations (known as luxatio erecta) and superior dislocations.
The age distribution of anterior dislocations is bimodal in nature. An early peak
occurs among men in their second decade of life. Young males are also more likely to
have recurrent dislocations: Rates of as high as 90% have been reported in athletes
who suffer a dislocation before the age of 20 years. The latter peak represents women
in their sixth and seventh decades. Although this population group is less likely to
suffer a recurrent dislocation, they experience higher rates of associated injuries such
as rotator cuff tears, vascular injuries, and nerve damage.

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

Anatomy of the Glenohumeral Joint
The glenohumeral joint is a complex array of structures that act together to provide
the greatest range of motion of any joint in the human body. These structures can
be loosely divided into static and dynamic stabilizers. Static stabilizers passively support the humeral head in the glenoid; they include the congruence between the
humeral head and glenoid fossa, the labrum, glenohumeral ligaments, and the
joint capsule. Dynamic stabilizers describe the rotator muscles and periscapular
musculature.
Static Stabilizers: The glenoid fossa itself engages only a minor proportion of the
humeral head, analogous to a golf ball on a tee. The ﬁbrocartilaginous labrum
(attached circumferentially to the glenoid rim) helps deepen the glenoid concavity
by up to 50%. The anterior inferior attachment of the labrum to the glenoid is tight,
whereas the superior attachment is looser and attaches to the long head of the biceps
near its origin. Perhaps the most important static stabilizers are the glenohumeral
ligaments, particularly the anterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament.
A Bankart lesion refers to a traumatic separation of the inferior glenohumeral
ligament and labral complex from the glenoid rim. Disruption of this complex is a
well-recognized cause of recurrent anterior instability. A bony Bankart lesion refers
to avulsion of a portion of the glenoid rim attached to the anteroinferior labral complex during a traumatic anterior dislocation. The glenohumeral ligaments, along
with their attachments and specific functions, are listed in Table 1–1. Together,
these ligaments act to stabilize the shoulder in different arrays of flexion/extension,
abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotation. The joint capsule, aside from
providing structural support to the glenohumeral joint, additionally acts to maintain
a negative intraarticular pressure that helps “suck” the humeral head down into the
glenoid fossa.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

27

Dynamic Stabilizers: Dynamic stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint are the muscles
of the shoulder that contract in a highly coordinated fashion to produce smooth,
stable movement throughout normal ranges of motion. Speciﬁcally, these include
the rotator cuff muscles (subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor) as well as the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, pectoralis major, and the long head of
the biceps.

Clinical Presentation
The most common clinical presentation of an anterior shoulder dislocation is after
an acute traumatic event. Typically, the injury involves one falling on a shoulder
that is in extension, external rotation, and abduction (common in athletes like the
patient in Case 1). An additional mechanism of injury includes dislocations from
direct force to the posterior shoulder, which can also result in anterior dislocation.
In older patients or patients with a history of recurrent dislocations, the glenohumeral joint can be extremely unstable and may dislocate with minimal trauma or
even during sleep.
Physical Exam: Patients with acutely dislocated shoulders usually have obvious
physical deformity on visual inspection. Shoulders will appear “full” anteriorly and
may have a visual or palpable depression of the posterior shoulder. Active and passive range of motion is limited by signiﬁcant pain.
When presented with a patient who has had multiple episodes of dislocation,
there are several bedside maneuvers classically associated with the diagnosis of
anterior instability. In the apprehension test, the patient is placed in the supine
position and asked to place their arm in a comfortable position. The arm is then
gradually externally rotated and abducted by the examiner. A positive test is one in
which the patient exhibits apprehension or guards against this shift in position due
to the subjective feeling of instability—in other words, the patient anticipates a
potential for dislocation and resists further external rotation and abduction. Interestingly, actual pain is usually typically elicited with this maneuver. The relocation
test is performed concurrently with a positive apprehension test: When the patient
begins to exhibit guarding, a posteriorly applied force should relieve the sensation
of impending dislocation.
The load and shift test can be used to assess both anterior and posterior instability.
The examiner applies an axial load on the elbow to drive the humeral head into
the glenoid fossa and simultaneously applies an anterior and posterior force on the
humeral head with the remaining hand. Translation of the humeral head 0 to 1 cm
in either direction is considered mild, whereas translation of greater than 2 cm or
translation beyond the glenoid rim is considered severe.
Finally, the presence of generalized ligamentous laxity should be evaluated.
Signs of metacarpophalangeal hyperextension or elbow recurvatum are suggestive
of underlying pathologic conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and therefore
require an appropriate workup if present.
Radiographic Evaluation: A trauma series of a suspected anteriorly dislocated
shoulder should be obtained whenever possible. Obtaining an axillary view in the
acute setting is often difﬁcult as a result of extreme pain, even after copious narcotic

28

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

administration. In such instances, a Velpeau axillary radiograph may be obtained
by having the patient lean backward over an x-ray cassette and angling the caudally
directed beam downward from above the shoulder.
A pathognomonic radiologic finding for anterior glenohumeral dislocation is
the Hill-Sachs lesion, which describes an osteochondral indentation fracture of
the posterolateral humeral head. It is caused by the impaction of relatively soft
humeral head against the hard glenoid rim after a dislocation and can deepen
with recurrent events. These defects can be easily missed on AP radiographs. The
Stryker notch view is especially useful in detecting such lesions and is obtained
by having the supine patient place the palm of the hand of the affected extremity
on the crown of the head and directing the beam toward the coracoid process.
Magnetic resonance imaging remains the gold standard imaging technique for
evaluating soft tissue injuries associated with anterior dislocation and should be
obtained when planning an operative stabilization procedure outside.

TREATMENT
Closed Reduction
Closed reduction should be attempted as soon as the patient has been appropriately evaluated and images obtained. Multiple techniques for reduction have been
described in the literature. Sedation and/or analgesia serve both to reduce the
patient’s discomfort during the reduction as well as to relax the pericapsular musculature, thus allowing for easier reduction. The Stimson technique involves attaching
weights to the affected extremity with the patient in the prone position. The gentle
traction overcomes muscular spasm over a period of time and allows for reduction
to occur. The Hippocratic maneuver and traction-countertraction techniques
achieve reduction by combining traction with internal and external rotation movements. The most significant difference between these techniques is the method of
countertraction: In the Hippocratic maneuver, the practitioner places his or her foot
in the patient’s axilla to stabilize the body while he or she is pulling the affected arm.
In the traction-countertraction method, an assistant provides countertraction by
pulling on a sheet wrapped around the patient’s body from under the axilla. Postreduction films should always be obtained. If reduction proves extremely difficult and
does not occur after multiple attempts, soft tissues are likely interposed between the
humeral head and glenoid. In such instances, closed reduction is futile, and urgent
operative open reduction should proceed.
After closed reduction, the shoulder is typically immobilized using a sling or shoulder immobilizer. Some recent literature, however, has failed to clearly demonstrate
benefits of immobilization. More commonly agreed on is a gradual rehabilitation,
focused on increasing range of motion. Older patients generally are immobilized for
shorter periods of time.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

29

Operative Treatment
Absolute indications for operative treatment include failed closed reduction secondary to soft tissue interposition and significant glenoid bone loss. Biomechanical
studies have shown that stability decreases exponentially with bone defects of 6 to
7 mm or greater in size.
Relative indications for operative treatment include those with a history of recurrent dislocations, as well as the initial shoulder dislocation in the young, highly
active patient. The question of operative versus nonoperative management of the
latter subgroup of patients has been the source of multiple investigations. Studies
show an up to 90% recurrence rate in patients younger than 30 years of age managed
nonoperatively after their first dislocation.
The most commonly performed stabilization procedure is repair of the anteroinferior labral/inferior glenohumeral ligament complex, known as the Bankart repair
(open or arthroscopic). Other procedures include glenoid cavity deepening, tendon
transfers, and capsular shifts. Patients with traumatic dislocations who exhibit unilateral instability and in whom Bankart lesions are present should be considered for
surgical intervention—such scenarios are sometimes referenced by the mnemonic
TUBS (traumatic, unidirectional, Bankart, surgery). Conversely, the mnemonic
AMBRI is sometimes used to describe populations for whom rehabilitation is the
preferred initial treatment. AMBRI describes patients with a history of atraumatic
dislocations with multidirectional instability, involvement of bilateral shoulders
who should be initially treated by rehabilitation; however, if surgery is needed, an
inferior capsular shift should be considered. Simply put, TUBS and AMBRI are
mnemonics to describe the presentation and treatment of patients at either end of
the instability spectrum.

OTHER TYPES OF GLENOHUMERAL DISLOCATION
Posterior glenohumeral dislocations represent up to 15% of all shoulder dislocations.
In general, they are less symptomatic in the acute phase and are sometimes found
incidentally in the elderly during workup for unrelated pathology. They may also be
seen as the sequelae of strong involuntary muscle contractions such as those caused
by seizures or electric shock, when the strong pericapsular muscles responsible for
internal rotation (latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, and subscapularis) overpower
the relatively weaker external rotators. A reverse Hill-Sachs lesion may be seen on
the anteromedial aspect of the humeral head following posterior dislocation.
Inferior glenohumeral dislocations (luxatio erecta) are exceedingly rare and
classically present with a startling, pathognomonic clinical presentation. Luxatio
erecta occurs when the arm is forced into a frozen hyperabducted state—sometimes
referred to as the “Superman” position because of its likeness to the superhero’s
famous flight stance. With the humeral head forced inferiorly, deltoid and other
muscular attachments pull the arm into extreme abduction. Neurovascular compromise almost always accompanies this type of dislocation.

31

ANSWERS
1.1 D. The periscapular musculature stabilizes the glenohumeral joint during and
throughout its full range of motion, thus acting as dynamic restraints. The other
answers listed are static restraints.
1.2 C. The load and shift test is a bedside examination technique that can aid in
the diagnosis of anterior shoulder disability. Because it can be performed in various degrees of arm abduction, it can sometimes aid in identifying the speciﬁc
deﬁcient structure contributing to anterior shoulder instability.
1.3 B. The Stryker notch view provides an excellent view of the posterolateral
humeral head. Hill-Sachs lesions can be easily visualized with other views, however, especially if the defect is large (as seen in Figure 1–1).
1.4 C. Age has been shown to be the most consistent predictor of instability: in
young patients < 20 years of age, recurrent rates are reportedly as high as 80%
to 90%; in those > 40 years of age, rates drop precipitously to approximately
10% to 15%.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Anterior dislocations of the glenohumeral joint are the most common,
representing up to 90% of all shoulder dislocations.



When a true axillary radiograph cannot be obtained, a Velpeau axillary
radiograph should be preformed to evaluate a dislocated glenohumeral
joint.



Urgent closed reduction is critical in the setting of a dislocated shoulder,
with a thorough and well-documented neurovascular exam performed.



Both Bankart and Hill-Sachs lesions are seen concurrently with shoulder
dislocations and can contribute to recurrent instability.

CASE 2
A 32-year-old right-hand-dominant female was standing on a stool in her kitchen,
lost balance, and fell onto her outstretched right hand. She arrives at an urgent
care clinic and is complaining of pain and deformity about her wrist. She did not
sustain any other injuries and has no significant past medical history. Physical
exam reveals her right wrist to have intact skin, and it is swollen and ecchymotic.
She has significant tenderness to palpation about the wrist, which has a mild,
dorsally angulated deformity. There is no snuffbox tenderness. She readily flexes
her distal interphalangeal joints and abducts her fingers. She weakly extends the
thumb and fingers. There is brisk capillary refill throughout, and sensation is intact
in the median, radial, and ulnar nervous distributions. Anteroposterior (AP) and
lateral wrist films are obtained and can be seen in Figure 2–1.

ANSWERS TO CASE 2:
Distal Radius (Colles) Fracture
Summary: A 32-year-old, right-hand-dominant female sustained a wrist injury after
falling on an outstretched hand. She has pain and a dorsally angulated deformity
about the distal radius. Wrist x-rays show an intraarticular distal radius fracture with
concomitant ulnar styloid fracture.
• Most likely diagnosis: This is an intraarticular distal radius fracture that
involves the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) with a concomitant ulna styloid
fracture. This may be classified as a Frykman type VI distal radius fracture.
• Additional injuries to be concerned: Scaphoid fractures, radial head fractures
(Essex Lopresti), elbow dislocation, proximal humerus fractures, shoulder dislocations, and clavicle fractures.
• Initial treatment: All displaced fractures should undergo closed reduction. A
hematoma block with or without sedation provides analgesia for closed reduction. The goals of reduction include anatomic repositioning of fragments for
healing, limiting postinjury swelling and pain, and relieving compression on
median nerve and other surrounding neurovascular structures.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the anatomy of the distal forearm and proximal wrist.
2. Be familiar with basic treatment options for distal radius fractures with regard to
both nonoperative and operative management.
3. Recognize potential complications arising from initial injuries and their treatments.

Considerations
This 32-year-old patient sustained an injury to her dominant hand from a fall.
Because the patient will be focused on her wrist, it is important to remember to
evaluate the entire extremity, focusing on areas of potential injury such as the snuffbox, elbow and radial head, shoulder, and clavicle. If warranted by mechanism, full
trauma workup should be initiated. A careful history should elucidate whether the
patient suffered a simple mechanical fall or whether there were underlying etiologies
behind her accident, such as syncope or gait instability. Examination of the skin is
important to ensure that there is not an open fracture that would necessitate urgent
operative debridement and washout. Next, a careful neurovascular exam needs to be
performed. Extension of the thumb by the extensor pollicus longus should be evaluated because the tendon can be trapped or lacerated as it passes the Lister tubercle.
Particular attention should be paid to the median nerve. Carpal tunnel compression
symptoms are common secondary to forced hyperextension of the wrist, as well as

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

35

local hematoma formation, impingement by fracture fragments, and increased compartment pressures.
Finally, after a complete and thorough exam is performed and documented, the
fracture should be immobilized, regardless of whether it meets requirements for operative fixation. This is typically performed by cast or splint immobilization.

APPROACH TO:
Distal Radius Fracture
DEFINITIONS
COLLES FRACTURE: An eponym originally describing extraarticular fractures
of the distal radius. More commonly used today as a lay term for any dorsally angulated distal radius fracture.
SMITH FRACTURE: An eponym for volarly angulated distal radius fractures,
most commonly incurred after a fall or blow to the dorsum of the wrist. This is sometimes referred to as a reverse Colles fracture.
CHAUFFEUR FRACTURE: An avulsion fracture of the radial styloid, historically as the result from hand-cranked automobiles in which engine backfire forced
the crank back into the chauffeur’s hand. Also known as a “backfire” or Hutchinson
fracture. Today these result from falls onto outstretched hands, with axial compressive force driving the scaphoid into the radial styloid as the wrist is both ulnarly
deviated and dorsiflexed.
BARTON FRACTURE: A shear fracture of the volar or dorsal lip of the distal
radius, resulting in dislocation or subluxation of the wrist, most commonly in the
volar direction.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Anatomy and Mechanisms of Injury
The distal radius consists of the metaphysic, or metaphyseal region, as well its articulating surfaces, which include the scaphoid facet, lunate facet, and the sigmoid
notch. The metaphysics flares distally, and its cortical bone becomes thin, especially
at its dorsal and radial aspects. Thin bone at this region is prone to comminution,
and therefore, many distal radius fractures eventually collapse dorsoradially,
despite initial anatomic reductions.

Radiographic Evaluation
Several distal radius and ulna measurements are helpful in evaluating the severity
of injury and can later be used to assess reduction. Although these values are wellestablished, they can vary greatly between individuals. If doubt exists regarding
the adequacy of alignment, contralateral comparison views should be obtained.
Figures 2–2 and 2–3 are AP and lateral radiographs of normal wrists, respectively,
showing measurements of the following alignment parameters:

Figure 2–2. An AP plain radiograph of a normal wrist showing the radiographic measurements: radial
inclination (A), radial length (B), and ulna variance (C).

Figure 2–3. A lateral plain radiograph of a normal wrist with measurement of palmar tilt (D).

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

37

1. Radial inclination (normally 23 degrees). Measured on an AP wrist film as the
angle between a line drawn from the radial styloid to the medial corner of radius
and a line drawn perpendicular to long axis of radius.
2. Radial length (normally 12 mm). Measured on an AP wrist film as distance in
millimeters between the tip of the radial styloid and most distal point of the ulnar
head of the radius.
3. Ulnar variance (normally ± 0-2 mm). On AP: distance between medial corner
of the articular surface of the radius and most distal point of articular surface of
the ulnar head.
4. Dorsal/palmar tilt (normally 11 degrees). On true lateral: angle between line
perpendicular to the long axis of radius and line from most distal points of volar
and dorsal lips of radius. Palmar tilt is the most important parameter to restore, as
it has the greatest bearing on functional outcome.

Classiﬁcation
Several distal radius fracture classification schemes exist, including informal descriptive classifications to formal systems based on mechanism (Fernandez classification)
or extent of articular involvement (Frykman classification). Often, fractures of the
distal radius are described with regard to whether the fracture is open or closed, intraor extraarticular with regard to the radiocarpal joint and/or the DRUJ, whether
the fracture is comminuted or simple, the direction of displacement if present, and
whether there is an associated ulna styloid fracture.

TREATMENT
Nonoperative Treatment
Closed reduction and cast immobilization is the mainstay of treatment. All displaced distal radius fractures should have attempted closed reduction, regardless
of severity. If swelling is significant or if superficial skin injury is present, fractures may be initially splinted with delayed casting. Nondisplaced fractures may be
cast in situ, typically with a short arm cast. If the fracture remains stable with the
acceptable radiologic parameters discussed previously, then fractures may be treated
definitively with a cast. Acceptable parameters for active, healthy patients include
restoration of palmar tilt, a neutral tilt or up to 10 degrees of dorsal angulation, restoration of radial length within 2 to 3 mm of the contralateral wrist, the absence of
intraarticular stepoff > 1 to 2 mm, and less than a 5-degree loss of radial inclination.
Close follow-up with serial radiographs is necessary, as some fractures have a tendency to collapse. As mentioned, even the most anatomic of reductions may collapse
in the setting of dorsal comminution and other types of metaphyseal comminution
or bone loss. For low-demand, elderly patients in whom the risks of surgery outweigh
the benefits, fractures may be treated definitively with a cast, splint, or brace.

Operative Treatment
Several modes of operative treatment exist, including plate fixation, percutaneous pinning, and even external fixation. The current mainstay of treatment is an

38

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

open-reduction internal fixation with plate and screws that may be placed either
dorsally or volarly. Surgical indications include metaphyseal instability, especially
with comminuted dorsal-medial cortices; intraarticular fractures with articular step
off > 1 to 2 mm or significant comminution; open fractures; DRUJ instability; or
secondary loss of reduction with loss of radial inclination of > 5 degrees, loss of
radial length of > 2 to 3 mm, or dorsal angulation > 10 degrees. Additional relative
indications include bilateral fractures, an impaired contralateral extremity, and
associated carpal fractures.

OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS
Several factors are associated with elevated risk of re-displacement after closed
reduction of a distal radius fracture. These include patient age > 80 years, significant
displacement before initial reduction, significant metaphyseal comminution, and
immediate displacement after reduction requiring multiple attempted reductions.
Malunion is a significant complication after nonoperative treatment. Malunion
can lead to negative effects on radiocarpal mechanics, loss of motion, and pain at
the DRUJ. Acute carpal tunnel syndrome that does not resolve soon after reduction
may lead to median nerve damage.
Posttraumatic osteoarthritis is a common sequelae of all intraarticular fractures
and correlates strongly with inadequate articular reduction. Anatomic restoration of
the articular surface is paramount for long-term functional success.
Complex regional pain syndrome (CPRS) may develop. Cardinal features of
CPRS include abnormal or neuropathic pain, temperature changes, abnormal localized diaphoresis, joint stiffness/atrophy/swelling, and bone changes. Tendon rupture
and tenosynovitis can occur, most frequently involving the extensor pollicus longus
(EPL) tendon. A higher risk of EPL rupture is associated with dorsal plating versus
volar plating when surgical fixation is performed, because prominent dorsal plates
may lead to repetitive wear on the tendon, leading to eventual rupture. EPL rupture
may also occur in the absence of internal fixation, because callus formation from
even minimally displaced fractures and vascular disruption may lead to gradual tendinous attrition and eventual rupture.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
2.1 A 27-year-old right-hand-dominant man sustains a right distal radius fracture
after a trip and fall. He is treated with closed reduction. Which radiographic
parameter has the greatest bearing on functional outcome?
A. Radial height
B. Radial inclination
C. Ulnar variance
D. Palmar tilt
E. Bauman angle

2.2 A 50-year-old engineer suffers a comminuted distal radius fracture that fails an
initial attempt at cast immobilization. He undergoes elective open-reduction
internal ﬁxation of the fracture with a dorsal plating technique. Which tendon
is most likely to rupture after dorsal plate ﬁxation of a distal radius fracture?
A. Flexor carpi radialis
B. Extensor pollicus longus
C. Abductor pollicus longus
D. Extensor pollicus brevis
E. Extensor digitorum
2.3 A 52-year-old female fell from her bicycle while trying to light a cigarette while
navigating a busy intersection. She suffers a right-sided, dominant distal radius
fracture. The fracture is closed and simple, extends into the radiocarpal joint,
and is almost 100% displaced dorsally. On additional radiographs, she has a
small, nondisplaced fracture of her ipsilateral radial head. Which of the following, if present, is associated with the highest risk of displacement after closed
reduction and cast immobilization?
A. Intraarticular involvement
B. Age > 50 years old
C. The severity of prereduction dorsal displacement
D. Ipsilateral fracture of the radial head
E. Tobacco history

ANSWERS
2.1 D. Although radial height, radial inclination, and ulnar variance are important
reduction parameters for the successful nonoperative treatment of distal radius
fractures, palmar tilt has been shown to have the greatest bearing on long-term
functional outcomes. Bauman angle is found in the pediatric elbow and is most
commonly used to assess supracondylar fractures. Bauman angle is measured
between the axis of the humeral shaft and the physis of the lateral condyle.
2.2 B. The extensor pollicus longus has been shown to be more prone to rupture
with dorsal plating than the ﬂexor carpi radialis, abductor pollicus longus, extensor pollicus brevis, and the extensor digitorum. EPL rupture is thought to occur
secondary to repetitive wear of the tendon on a prominent plate. Although
several different methods are described, irreparable EPL ruptures may be treated
with transfer of the redundant extensor indicis proprius to the thumb to regain
thumb extension.

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

2.3 C. Of the several factors associated with re-displacement after closed reduction
of distal radius fractures, the severity of initial displacement is likely the most
signiﬁcant. Additional risk factors include patient age > 80 years (not 50 years),
signiﬁcant metaphyseal comminution (she had a simple, 2-part fracture), and
immediate displacement after reduction requiring multiple attempted reductions (not mentioned in the vignette). Intraarticular involvement, positive
tobacco history, and even concomitant fractures have not been clearly associated with a high risk of failed closed reduction.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Distal radius fractures are amongst the most common fractures treated
in the United States at more than 650,000 cases per year.



Patients with distal radius fractures may have incurred more than a simple wrist injury, especially in high-energy trauma scenarios. It is therefore essential to assess similarly injured structures such as the scaphoid,
radial head, shoulder, and clavicle.



The incidence of distal radius fractures as the result of simple falls mirrors that of hip fractures. Both may be evidence of osteopenia or osteoporosis, and patients at risk should be worked up accordingly.

CASE 3
A 33-year-old male patient is brought to the emergency department (ED) by ambulance after a high-speed motor vehicle collision (MVC) that occurred approximately 2 hours ago. He was the unrestrained passenger in a car that was traveling
approximately 65 miles per hour (mph) when it rear-ended a pick-up truck. There
was a prolonged extrication at the scene. On arrival to the ED, the patient is writhing in pain on the gurney, complaining of right hip pain. His vital signs are within
normal limits, and a trauma workup reveals deformity to the patient’s right lower
extremity, but no other injuries. On examination, the patient’s right hip is slightly
flexed, adducted, and internally rotated. Although he cannot extend his hip, he is
able to extend his great toe, as well as dorsiflex and plantarflex his foot. His right
lower extremity is warm and well perfused with brisk pulses; sensation to light
touch is also grossly intact. The patient denies any prior medical or surgical
history. An anteroposterior (AP) plain radiograph of the pelvis is shown (Figure 3–1).

ANSWERS TO CASE 3:
Posterior Hip Dislocation
Summary: A 33-year-old male patient is brought to the ED 2 hours after a high-speed
MVC and prolonged extrication complaining of right hip pain. On exam, his right
lower extremity is slightly flexed, adducted, and internally rotated. It is neurovascularly intact. An AP radiograph of his pelvis identifies a right hip dislocation.
• Most likely diagnosis: Posterior dislocation of the right hip
• Mechanism of injury: Axial load on a flexed hip (a dashboard injury)
• Next step in therapy: Emergent closed reduction within 6 hours to decrease
the risk of femoral head osteonecrosis and sciatic nerve injury

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the diagnostic approach to hip dislocations.
2. Understand that a native hip dislocation is an orthopaedic emergency.
3. Be familiar with the technique used to reduce a dislocated hip.
4. Know the postreduction workup and management.
5. Know the complications associated with hip dislocations.

Considerations
This 33-year-old male patient presents to the ED with a right hip dislocation 2 hours
after a high-speed MVC. The first priority is a trauma workup, applying advanced
trauma life support (ATLS) principles. This patient has no other injuries, and therefore, the next step must be to evaluate the imaging obtained to rule out an associated femoral neck fracture, followed by emergent reduction. It is imperative that
the orthopaedist perform a complete and well-documented physical examination,
noting any neurovascular compromise or other injuries to the right lower extremity before reduction. Successful reduction is dependent on the ability of ED physicians to perform conscious sedation with good muscle relaxation. If they are unable
to do this, the patient may require reduction in the operating room under general
anesthesia. A repeat AP pelvis radiograph should be obtained to confirm reduction,
followed by a computed tomography (CT) scan through the acetabulum. This will
evaluate for a concentric reduction and the presence of any intra-articular fragments
and associated fractures of the femoral head and acetabulum. After reduction, the
patient’s hip should be ranged and assessed for stability and a repeat neurovascular
exam performed. The patient must be counseled on the risk of osteonecrosis of his
hip, the high association of this injury with other injuries (ipsilateral knee injuries
are common), and hip precautions.

APPROACH TO:
Hip Dislocation
DEFINITIONS
OSTEONECROSIS (AVASCULAR NECROSIS): Process by which bone tissue
dies due to either a temporary or permanent disruption to the bone’s blood supply. It
is associated with excessive steroid use, sickle cell disease, alcoholism, deep diving
(caisson disease), Gaucher disease, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be
posttraumatic, such as after a hip dislocation, or idiopathic in nature.
HIP PRECAUTIONS: Restrictions designed to prevent posterior dislocation
of the hip. They are applied after total hip arthroplasty performed via a posterior
approach as well as after native posterior hip dislocations. The precautions prohibit
patients from crossing their legs, bending their hip past a 90-degree angle, and twisting their hip inward.
ALLIS MANEUVER: One of several described methods by which to reduce a dislocated hip. The patient is placed in the supine position, and the pelvis is stabilized
by an assistant applying pressure. The physician then applies in-line longitudinal
traction to the femur followed by gentle flexion of the hip to 90 degrees. Internal
and external rotation of the hip ensues, with continued traction until reduction is
achieved. Reduction is often signified by an audible and palpable clunk.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiology and Mechanism of Injury
Posterior hip dislocations are caused by high-energy mechanisms and comprise
greater than 90% of all native hip dislocations (Figure 3–2). They are referred to as
dashboard injuries because of their high association with motor vehicle accidents in
which the patient is subjected to an axial load on a flexed hip occurring when the
knee is driven violently into the dashboard. Other causes include falls and athletic
injuries. In all of these instances, the hip is positioned in a flexed, adducted, and
internally rotated position (Figure 3–2). Anterior dislocations, which are uncommon and comprise fewer than 10% of hip dislocations, occur via an external rotation and abduction force and are not discussed.

Anatomy
The inherent stability of the hip joint is provided by its ligamentous, bony, and
muscular architecture, as well as the labrum. Its main blood supply is via the medial
femoral circumflex artery, with other contributions from the lateral femoral circumflex artery, artery of the ligamentum teres (obturator), and the inferior and superior
gluteal arteries. The sciatic nerve lies close to the hip joint, exiting anterior to the
piriformis in the greater sciatic notch.

Initial Management, Diagnosis, and Classiﬁcation
Given their high-energy mechanisms, ATLS protocol must be followed in the initial
management of the patient presenting with a hip dislocation. After this, a complete physical exam is performed, and in the setting of a posterior hip dislocation,
the position of the patient’s affected extremity is often telltale. The limb will be
flexed, adducted, and internally rotated. Neurologic and vascular status must be
documented. An AP pelvic radiograph should be obtained and will confirm the
diagnosis. With posterior dislocations, the femoral head appears smaller than its
contralateral side, joint congruency is lost, and the lesser trochanter difficult to
visualize as a result of the internal rotation of the femur. The femoral neck of the
affected side must be adequately visualized and evaluated for fracture, as this would
change the treatment plan and require operative intervention.
The Thompson and Epstein classification for hip dislocation is one of the most
widely used, based on radiographic characteristics, and is described in Table 3–1.

Treatment and Postreduction Management
A hip dislocation is an orthopaedic emergency, and closed reduction attempts must
be performed as soon as possible to reduce the period of avascularity to the hip. It
must be reiterated, however, that adequate imaging be obtained before any reduction attempts to rule out an ipsilateral femoral neck fracture. Reduction can be performed in the ED if conscious sedation and muscle relaxation can be achieved. If
adequate sedation and relaxation is unattainable in the ED, the hip must be reduced
in the operating room under general anesthesia.
There are many described reduction techniques for posterior dislocations,
including the Allis and Bigelow maneuvers and the East Baltimore lift. In the Allis
maneuver, which requires the patient to be supine on the table, the patient’s pelvis
is stabilized by an assistant applying pressure. The physician then applies in-line longitudinal traction to the femur followed by gentle flexion of the hip to 90 degrees.
Internal and external rotation of the hip ensues with continued traction until reduction is accomplished. Reduction is often signified by an audible and palpable clunk.
A repeat AP pelvic radiograph must be obtained to confirm a successful reduction.
Once this is confirmed, the hip should be ranged gently to assess stability and
a CT scan performed to evaluate for a concentric reduction, the presence of
intraarticular fragments, and the presence of femoral head and acetabular fractures.

46

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

Posterior acetabular wall fractures with > 40% wall disruption lead to an unstable
hip, whereas it remains stable when < 20% of the wall is disrupted. An irreducible
hip dislocation, which is caused by bony or soft-tissue interposition within the joint,
requires emergent open surgical intervention to reduce the pressure on the hip’s articular cartilage and subsequent risk for avascular necrosis. A nonconcentric reduction
may also require open operative intervention or skeletal traction for the same reasons
seen with irreducible hips.
If the hip is found to be clinically and radiographically stable after reduction, an
abduction pillow or knee immobilizer must be used to prevent inadvertent movements by the patient that could compromise reduction and cause recurrent dislocation. Strict hip precautions should be enforced at all times and prohibit patients
from crossing their legs, bending their hip past a 90-degree angle, and twisting their
hip inward.
There is no one specific approach to rehabilitation after a hip dislocation, and
the patient’s weight-bearing status and need for postreduction traction or bed rest
are controversial and surgeon dependent.

Complications
The risk of developing posttraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head is what
makes hip dislocations an orthopaedic emergency. The critical time to reduction,
which in theory will restore blood flow to the femoral head, has not been definitively determined. However, it is thought that a greatly increased risk of avascular
necrosis occurs with a delay in reduction of greater than 6 to 12 hours. It is important to note that those who incur hip dislocations via higher energy mechanisms are
more likely to develop osteonecrosis as a result of greater initial damage to the
surrounding blood supply. Osteonecrosis commonly occurs within 2 years. Other
complications include development of posttraumatic arthritis, sciatic nerve palsy,
and recurring dislocations. Furthermore, many patients presenting with hip dislocations have other significant systemic injuries as well as ipsilateral knee and bony
injuries.

3.2 A 28-year-old man is about to be discharged from the hospital after a motor
vehicle collision in which he sustained a right hip dislocation. Before leaving,
he asks to review what positions he can and cannot place his hip. You explain
to him that posterior hip precautions prohibit:
A. Leg crossing
B. Flexing the hip to greater than 90 degrees
C. Twisting the hip inward
D. Hip extension
E. A, B, and C
3.3 A 41-year-old woman sustains a left posterior hip dislocation. After a successful
attempt at closed reduction in the emergency room using conscious sedation,
what is the next step in management?
A. CT scan of the hip and pelvis
B. Hip spica cast application
C. Further evaluation of hip stability via an exam under anesthesia in the
operating room
D. Femoral skeletal traction pin

ANSWERS
3.1 C. The traumatic hip dislocation in this case is due to a dashboard injury in
which the forces are ﬁrst transmitted through the knee en route to the hip.
Thus the possibility of a concurrent ipsilateral knee injury should be explored
through careful clinical examination and possibly magnetic resonance imaging.
3.2 E. Choices A, B, and C are posterior hip precautions. Hip extension is not and
can be performed by those who have had a posterior dislocation or have undergone hip replacement via a posterior approach. However, it is considered an
anterior hip precaution and therefore should not be done in those who undergo
hip replacement via an anterior approach or who have dislocated anteriorly.
3.3 A. The next step in management after reduction of a posterior hip dislocation
is obtaining a CT scan to evaluate for damage (ie, fracture or impaction deformity) to the femoral head and acetabulum. Furthermore, a CT scan will identify
an incongruent reduction and free intraarticular joint fragments. Such ﬁndings
may require additional intervention.

CASE 4
A 76-year-old Caucasian female is brought to the emergency department (ED) with
complaints of left groin pain after stumbling and falling in the hallway of her home.
Previously she ambulated without assistance, but she states that now she cannot
bear weight on her left leg. Although she did not lose consciousness, she recalls
feeling “a little light-headed” before she fell. She has no other complaints or pains.
She takes several medications for a history of cardiac arrhythmias, including warfarin. On physical exam, the patient is laying comfortably in the stretcher with her
left leg held in slight external rotation. She reports pain with gentle passive rotation of her hip. There is a slight ecchymosis over her left greater trochanter. She
readily dorsi- and plantarflexes her left ankle and flexes and extends her toes; her
sensation is intact throughout her leg. Gentle palpation of all other joints is negative for tenderness or notable deformity. Her temperature is 98ºF, blood pressure
134/88 mmHg, and heart rate is 155 beats/min. An electrocardiogram shows a
rapid, erratic ventricular rate without discernible p waves. Initial laboratory tests
show a hemoglobin and hematocrit of 11.5 g/dL and 35.0%, respectively, and an

ANSWERS TO CASE 4:
Femoral Neck Fracture
Summary: A 76-year-old woman complains of left hip pain after suffering a presyncopal fall onto her left hip. She suffers a nondisplaced femoral neck fracture.
• Most likely diagnosis: Anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the left hip showing a fracture that extends obliquely across the femoral neck. The femoral head
is not significantly displaced from the femur, but impacted into the neck and
rotated away from the midline. This results in a valgus deformity.
• Treatment options: Although treatment options always include nonoperative
management—historically treated with prolonged bed rest and traction—
fractures of the femoral neck are best treated surgically. Basic methods include
fixation with screws and hip arthroplasty.
• Additional concerns: The patient’s elevated INR puts her at risk for significant perioperative bleeding, especially if she requires hip prosthesis placement.
Furthermore, her history of unsteady gate and dizziness requires a thorough

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

51

workup for presyncope. Her cardiac comorbidities, age, and additional aspects
of her history place her at risk for multiple perioperative complications. Anesthesia, internal medicine, and/or cardiology are often consulted for assistance
with perioperative risk management.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Distinguish different types of femoral neck fractures and their classifications.
2. Determine the appropriate treatment options for various types of femoral neck
fractures with regard to patient age, comorbidities, and prior activity level.
3. Understand the mechanics and anatomy of the hip with special regard to its
blood supply.
4. Be familiar with the complications associated with femoral neck fractures.

Considerations
This mechanism of injury—a low-energy, direct fall onto the great trochanter—is
perhaps the most common cause of hip fracture in elderly patients. The affected
extremity may be shortened and externally rotated with displaced fractures; however, in neck fractures that are nondisplaced, physical signs may be subtle and limited to pain with weight bearing or with movement, especially rotation, of the hip.
Femoral neck fractures are not usually associated with neurovascular injury unless
accompanied by other injuries; these should be of greater suspicion in younger
patients who have sustained hip fractures from high-energy mechanisms.
This patient exhibits many risk factors for an insufficiency fracture of the hip,
including her postmenopausal age, female sex, white race, and history of tobacco use.
Despite these risk factors, however, the patient maintained a fairly active lifestyle,
ambulating and participating in many daily activities; such activity levels help guide
expectations and treatments.
Additionally, this patient has atrial fibrillation that is not rate-controlled on
presentation. Her anticoagulation status, secondary to warfarin use, precludes all
but the most drastic of surgical interventions. The patient’s elevated INR must be
reversed before invasive procedures are performed. An unstable cardiac history of
arrhythmias or valve replacements necessitates careful evaluation and optimization before surgery, balancing the importance of anticoagulation with perioperative
bleeding. Fortunately, this patient’s nondisplaced neck fracture need not be fixed
in an emergent manner; however, some types of nondisplaced hip fractures, as discussed below, demand a more prompt, emergency fixation to preserve blood supply
to vulnerable bone. During her hospitalization, this patient should have her presyncopal symptoms and coagulation addressed by her medical team.
Preoperative risks must be addressed quickly and minimized when possible, as
many studies show improved patient outcomes with early (< 4 days in some studies) versus delayed surgical interventions. Advantages include reduced hospital
stays, risks of pulmonary complications, venous thromboembolism, and pressure
ulceration.

52

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

APPROACH TO:
Femoral Neck Fracture
DEFINITIONS
AVASCULAR (OSTEO)NECROSIS (AVN): Bone death secondary to inadequate blood supply. May be idiopathic; secondary to biological, chemical, or physical
insults; or, in femoral neck fractures, the result of traumatic loss of vascular supply.
CALCAR FEMORALE: Dense, vertically oriented bone originating in the posteromedial portion of the femoral shaft under the lesser trochanter. It radiates laterally toward the posterior aspect of the greater trochanter, reinforcing the femoral
neck posteroinferiorly.
INTRACAPSULAR FEMORAL NECK: This term refers to the area of the femoral neck that is located within the joint capsule. Anteriorly, the capsule attaches
to the intertrochanteric line. Posteriorly, it attaches 1 to 1.5 cm proximal to the
intertrochanteric line at the base of the neck.
EXTRACAPSULAR FEMORAL NECK: This term refers to the more distal area
of the femoral neck, which is located outside the joint capsule. This predominantly
metaphyseal region has excellent blood supply and therefore has a comparatively
low risk of nonunion/AVN.
CROSS-TABLE LATERAL X-RAYS: A radiographic view that allows perpendicular assessment of the femoral neck without need for manipulation of the
affected extremity. It is obtained by flexing the contralateral hip out of the x-ray
plane and obtaining x-rays perpendicular to the femoral neck.
HEMIARTHROPLASTY: A surgical procedure that replaces the femoral portion
of the hip joint; the femoral head and neck are removed and replaced with a prosthesis containing a femoral head component that swivels in the remnant acetabulum.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Anatomy
The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint consisting of the femoral head articulating
with the acetabulum. The femoral neck is characterized by a 120 to 135-degree
angle formed between the femoral neck and femoral shaft in the coronal plane and
15 to 25 degrees of anteversion, or forward rotation, in the sagittal plane. The predominantly cortical bone in the femoral neck has a highly organized arrangement,
with trabeculae oriented in the direction of major stress forces across the hip joint.
In adults, blood supply to the femoral neck and head is primarily through the
medial circumflex femoral artery, a branch of the deep femoral (or profunda femoris)
artery. Additional supplies are from the lateral femoral circumflex artery and the
foveal artery, which travels through the ligamentum teres directly into the femoral
head. Both circumflex femoral vessels form an extracapsular anastomotic ring at the
base of the femoral neck and then penetrate the capsule to become intracapsular,
thereby ascending to supply the head. Unlike the shaft of the femur, the intracapsular

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

53

portion of its neck is devoid of periosteum; all healing must therefore occur through
endosteal means, which necessitates an intact blood supply. It is critical to restore
anatomic alignment in displaced fractures and to stabilize nondisplaced fractures to
prevent future compromise to blood supply.

Mechanism of Injury
High-energy trauma, regardless of age, sex, or comorbidity, may cause femoral neck
fractures. In the elderly or debilitated, however, femoral neck fracture most commonly occurs secondary to low-energy falls, either directly through forces on the
greater trochanter, which transmits a force onto the femoral neck, or from forceful
external rotation of the limb. Additional mechanisms include the repetitive loading forces experienced by athletes that gradually weaken portions of bone over time
and manifest in stress fractures. Similar stress fractures may occur in patients with
osteoporosis.

Evaluation and Diagnosis
In the setting of high-energy mechanisms, advanced traumatic life support protocols
should be initiated to evaluate for any life-threatening injuries. With low-energy
mechanisms such as a fall from standing, the patient should be evaluated for additional acute injuries such as head, cervical spine, or limb trauma. In patients without a history of acute trauma, other causes must be evaluated, including repetitive
load cycling, particularly in physically active males and females with osteoporosis
secondary to medical conditions including anorexia nervosa and renal or endocrine
disorders.
The affected extremity should be evaluated for shortening, rotation, and neurovascular integrity. In some cases, physical signs may be very subtle. Gentle range of
motion of the hip may elicit pain. Radiographic evaluation should use both an AP
pelvis and a cross-table lateral image of the involved side. When history and physical exam are clinically suggestive of fracture despite normal x-ray findings, magnetic
resonance imaging or bone scan may reveal occult fractures.

Classiﬁcation
Femoral neck fractures are described using a variety of methods, including classification by anatomic location, by displacement of the fracture fragments, or by the
vertical angulation of the fracture lines.
Anatomic Descriptors: Simple anatomic descriptors include the following:
Subcapital fracture: An intracapsular fracture located at the junction between the
femoral head and neck.
Transcervical fracture: An intracapsular fracture extending across the mid-portion
of the femoral neck.
Basicervical fracture: An extracapsular fracture located at the base of the femoral
neck. Although this fracture is anatomically located within the femoral neck, it is
often treated as an intertrochanteric fracture because of the biomechanical forces
across this fracture.

Type I

Valgus impacted, incomplete fracture

Femoral head is discontinuous with the femoral neck
and remains located in acetabulum with its trabecular

Garden Classiﬁcation: Describes fractures based primarily on the degree of displacement noted in the AP radiograph. The risk of avascular necrosis and nonunion
is predicted to be higher with increasing grade. The orientation of trabecular bone
of the head with regard to that of the acetabulum is helpful in distinguishing these
fracture types. Table 4–1 outlines the definitions and radiographic features of the
Garden classification of femoral neck fractures.
Pauwel Classiﬁcation: Fractures are categorized according to the angle that they
form with the horizontal plane: grade I, 0 to 30 degrees; II, 30 to 70 degrees; and
III, > 70 degrees. At low angles, the forces of weightbearing are perpendicular to
the fracture line and actually assist healing by compressing the pieces together to
promote bone growth. As the angle increases, however, these forces become shear
forces, exacerbating displacement of the pieces or failure of fixation. Pauwel type III
fractures are thus associated with significant instability and high risks of nonunion
and avascular necrosis. The stability of a fracture pattern no doubt influences the
method of its treatment.

TREATMENT
Regardless of fracture type, the goals are almost universal: Minimize patient discomfort, restore hip function, and allow mobilization as early and safely as possible.
Although most nondisplaced extremity fractures are treated with nonoperative
immobilization, the difficulties of effective, comfortable, or practical immobilization of the hip are almost insurmountable. Furthermore, in the rare cases of nonoperative hip fracture treatment, subsequent displacement rates are as high as 40%.
Nonoperative management is therefore reserved for only those absolutely medically
unfit for surgery or severely demented and pain-free nonambulators.

Nondisplaced Fractures
Internal Fixation: Surgical ﬁxation of nondisplaced fractures is most commonly
achieved with cancellous lag screws percutaneously placed through the femoral
neck. Typically, 3 screws are inserted in an inverted-triangular conﬁguration, ﬁrst

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

using thin K-wires placed under x-ray ﬂuoroscopy, which are then replaced by cannulated, or hollow, screws inserted over the wires. Care should be taken to avoid
starting the screws distal to the level of the lesser trochanter, as the extreme tension
forces on this side of the bone would be prone to stress riser forces and propagation
of fracture.
General indications for percutaneous pinning include impacted and nondisplaced femoral neck fractures (ie, Gardner I or II fractures or those with low Pauwel
angles [type I]). In situ screw fixation is contraindicated, however, in patients
with pathologic fractures or severe osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis; such
patients should be alternatively managed with prosthetic replacement.

Displaced Fractures
Fracture Reduction and Fixation: There are a variety of surgical treatment options for displaced fractures, which vary signiﬁcantly with regard to patient age,
previous activity level, and comorbidities.
In young, otherwise healthy individuals, displaced transcervical or subcapital
fractures pose a unique challenge. Here, prompt reduction of the femur is essential
to restoring blood flow to support adequate healing. Femoral neck fractures in young
individuals are generally considered an orthopaedic emergency, as risks of osteonecrosis may increase with increasing time until reduction. Reductions, too, must be
anatomic to maximally preserve the blood supply.
Reduction in displaced neck fractures is typically achieved by externally rotating
and flexing the hip under gentle traction to disengage fragments, then internally
rotating to approximate the ends. Reduction must be evaluated by AP and crosstable lateral views. If prompt reduction is achieved, percutaneous pins, using the
methods previously described, may be used to fix the unstable reduction. If reduction cannot be achieved using these closed methods, open reduction and internal
fixation should be performed. Such constructs may be performed with sliding-screw
or fixed-angle devices. If there is significant comminution, extensive damage, and
stripped vasculature and soft tissue support, or significant comminution of the femoral neck, especially in the compression load-bearing calcar femorale region, the risks
of AVN are high.
Arthroplasty: In elderly patients, patients with limited ambulatory status (those
who previously ambulated with walkers or crutches or were wheelchair bound), and
patients with underlying signiﬁcant arthritis or osteoporosis, arthroplasty is generally the treatment of choice. By replacing the femoral head and neck, arthroplasty
eliminates the risks of nonunion, avascular necrosis, and hardware failure that may
be a consequence of internal ﬁxation. Arthroplasty may be total (a replacement
of both the acetabular cup and the femoral neck and head) or hemi (meaning the
replacement of the femoral components placed into a native acetabulum). Hemiarthroplasty prostheses may be unipolar, involving a static implant that swivels in
the acetabular cup, or, more commonly, bipolar, which provide an extraarticulating
junction between the femoral head shell and inner ball. Although total arthroplasty
is the most extensive and invasive option, it may afford the highest level of function
to elderly albeit healthy individuals who previously maintained active lifestyles.

56

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

Complications
Femoral neck fractures impose a high mortality risk in the elderly population, reaching up to 30% at 1 year. Surgical treatment with internal fixation carries its own
risks, most commonly:
Nonunion: Displaced femoral neck fractures generally take longer to heal, often
6 months or longer. The total rate of nonunion is reported to be 6%.
Hardware failure: This complication is most commonly reported concomitantly
with nonunion and may require a conversion arthroplasty to fix.
Avascular necrosis: This tends to be a delayed complication, more commonly a
complication of fractures displaced at presentation. AVN may not be evident until
at least 2 years postoperatively. Conversion total arthroplasty is preferred over hemiarthroplasty, as the acetabulum often also exhibits degenerative changes due to collapse of the femoral head.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
4.1 A 42-year-old man complains of right hip pain after being ejected from an allterrain vehicle. He denies neurologic changes or other symptoms. His right leg
does not appear to be shortened or externally rotated. Right hip radiographs
demonstrate a complete, nondisplaced transcervical fracture. What is the most
appropriate treatment for this patient?
A. Nonoperative observation with pain control, limited weightbearing, and
close follow-up
B. Percutaneous pinning
C. Bipolar hemiarthroplasty
D. Total hip arthroplasty
4.2 A 66-year-old avid cross-country skier sustains a displaced femoral neck fracture
after a fall down an icy embankment. What is the best treatment option for this
patient?
A. Bipolar hemiarthroplasty
B. Open reduction internal fixation
C. Unipolar hemiarthroplasty
D. Nonoperative treatment with close follow-up
E. Total hip arthroplasty

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

57

4.3 A 72-year-old man sustains a completely displaced, subcapital femoral neck
fracture after tripping over a step on a neighbors porch. Awake and lucid in the
ED, he is most likely to assume which of the following positions for his fractured
extremity?
A. Flexion and external rotation
B. Extension and external rotation
C. Flexion and neutral rotation and flexion
D. Extension and neutral rotation
E. Flexion and internal rotation

ANSWERS
4.1 B. The patient’s young age and fracture severity are the major determinants of
management. Of the surgical options listed, percutaneous pinning is the least
invasive option in the setting of nondisplaced fractures. Regardless of displacement, closed reduction with internal ﬁxation is the recommended choice of
treatment in this age group. Arthroplasty is more commonly performed in the
elderly population.
4.2 E. Given the presence of a displaced femoral neck fracture in an elderly patient,
arthroplasty (options A, C, and E) is indicated. Given this patient’s previously
active lifestyle, total hip arthroplasty, option E, would best restore this patient
to his previous level of function.
4.3 A. Patients with intracapsular pathology of the hip tend to hold their extremities in a position of external rotation and ﬂexion. This patient has suffered
subcapital fracture of the femoral neck, which is an intracapsular injury, thus
resulting in hematoma formation and increased pressure within the hip socket.
In a position of external rotation and ﬂexion, the volume of the hip socket is
greatest, and thus patients ﬁnd relative comfort in this position. Additionally,
children with septic arthritis of the hip will assume this position, as pain from
pressurized inﬂammatory responses is similarly minimized.

CLINICAL PEARLS


In the absence of absolute medical contraindications to surgery, the great
majority of hip fractures are treated operatively.



Despite significant improvements in the ability to surgically treat hip fractures and manage medical comorbidities, the mortality of hip fractures in
patients ≥ 80 years of age is upward of 30% within 1 year from fracture.

CASE 5
An 81-year-old white woman is brought to the emergency department (ED) with
complaints of right hip pain after losing her balance while using the sink in her
bathroom. Currently she is unable to bear weight on her right leg. She denies
losing consciousness, feeling light-headed, or having chest discomfort or palpitations before the fall. She states her leg just “gave out.” She did not hit her head.
Before her injury, she ambulated with the assistance of a cane. The patient lives
alone and was unable to move herself to a phone to call for help and was not
found until almost 36 hours after the fall occurred. She has no other complaints
of injury. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis,
and a history of a proximal humerus fracture 9 months prior. On exam, the patient
is lying with her right leg slightly shortened and externally rotated. She experiences significant pain with gentle passive rotation and palpation over her hip.
Her skin, as well as motor and sensory function, are intact throughout her right
lower extremity. Palpation of all other joints is negative for tenderness or notable
deformity. Her temperature is 98ºF, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, and heart rate
is 105 beats/min. Electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia. An anteroposterior
(AP) radiograph of the right hip is obtained (Figure 5–1).

ANSWERS TO CASE 5:
Intertrochanteric Hip Fracture
Summary: An 81-year-old woman complains of right hip pain after falling from
standing and suffering a right intertrochanteric fracture.
• Most likely diagnosis: Right intertrochanteric fracture
• Treatment options: Intertrochanteric femur fractures are best treated surgically.
The goal is stable internal fixation to allow early weightbearing and mobilization. Fixation implant choices include cephalomedullary hip screws, sliding hip
screws, and, to a lesser extent, prosthetic replacements or external fixators. Like
femoral neck fractures, nonoperative management is reserved only for patients
whose medical comorbidities put them at excessive risk for surgery.
• Additional medical concerns: This patient was found collapsed, many hours
after her fall. She has been without oral intake for this entire time. The patient
must be evaluated for dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, nutritional deficits,
pressure ulcers, potential rhabdomyolysis and associate acute kidney failure, and
hemodynamic instability, as intertrochanteric fractures may be associated with
a large amount of blood loss into the thigh.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify and characterize intertrochanteric hip fractures with regard to their stability.
2. Be familiar with the basic treatment options available for fixation of intertrochanteric fractures.
3. Understand the significance of hip fractures on mortality rates.

Considerations
This patient suffered a low-energy fall from standing, with a direct impact onto her
great trochanter. This represents the most common mechanism for intertrochanteric hip fractures, which are most commonly seen in elderly female patients.
On physical exam, it is important to look at the position of the affected extremity. With displaced fractures, the extremity may be shortened and externally rotated.
In nondisplaced fractures, conversely, physical signs may be subtle or simply limited
to pain with range of motion of the hip and an inability to bear weight. Intertrochanteric hip fractures are not commonly associated with neurovascular injury or
open fractures; however, evaluation for such characteristics is essential. In younger
patients with intertrochanteric fractures secondary to high-energy mechanisms,
neurovascular and associated injuries are more common. Such patients, of course,
should undergo a complete and thorough advanced traumatic life support workup
before orthopaedic injuries are addressed.
Several studies have shown improved patient outcomes with prompt surgical intervention for hip fractures; however, medical comorbidities must first be evaluated. In
this case, the patient should be treated for dehydration and potential electrolyte imbalances and worked up for a potential rhabdomyolysis. Hip fractures are associated
with increasing age (> 70 years), female sex, and low bone mass. Intertrochanteric
fractures are the most common pattern, accounting for approximately 50% of all
hip fractures, with femoral neck fractures being the second most frequent. Other
common osteoporosis-related fractures include fractures of the vertebral bodies, distal
radius, and proximal humerus. Hip fractures may also be seen in younger patients
after high-energy injuries such as motor vehicle accidents and falls from height.

APPROACH TO:
Intertrochanteric Fracture
DEFINITIONS
INTERTROCHANTERIC: The region between the greater and lesser trochanters of the proximal femur. This area is extracapsular, is made up of predominantly
cancellous bone, and has an abundant blood supply.

62

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

SLIDING HIP SCREW: An extramedullary device that consists of a lateral side
plate and a femoral head lag screw. The lag screw is not fixed into the side plate,
allowing a controlled collapse at the fracture site. This creates compression over the
fracture site and may promote healing.
CEPHALOMEDULLARY NAIL: An intramedullary device that combines features of an intramedullary nail and a sliding hip screw. Cephalomedullary nails are
frequently employed in unstable and reverse obliquity fracture patterns.
REVERSE OBLIQUITY: A type of unstable fracture pattern characterized by an
oblique fracture line extending from the medial cortex proximally to the lateral
cortex distally.
TIP-APEX DISTANCE: The sum of the distances from the tip of the lag screw to
the apex of the femoral head on the AP and lateral radiographic views. The measurement is expressed in millimeters. A measurement of less than 25 mm has been
shown to minimize the risk of screw cutout.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Anatomy
The femoral head is connected to the shaft by the femoral neck, which projects
medially to the shaft at an angle of 120 to 130 degrees. The greater trochanter projects superiorly and laterally above the neck–shaft junction. The lesser trochanter
is located at the inferior junction of the neck and shaft on the posteromedial side
and is the site of insertion for the iliopsoas muscle. The 2 trochanters are connected
posteriorly by a crest of thickened cancellous bone, known as the intertrochanteric
crest. The piriformis and short external rotators insert along here. A strong plate of
vertically oriented bone called the calcar femorale is located posteriorly between
the lesser and greater trochanters. Intertrochanteric fractures may displace secondary to the pull of the musculotendinous attachments on their respective fragments:
Greater trochanter fragments may be abducted and externally rotated by the gluteus
medius and short external rotators, whereas the shaft will be displaced proximally,
medially, and posteriorly by the adductors and hamstrings.

Mechanism of Injury
Low-energy falls from standing account for more than 90% of hip fractures in
patients > 50 years of age. Fractures secondary to high-energy mechanisms commonly affect men less than 40 years of age.

Evaluation and Diagnosis
Patients most commonly present with pain in the proximal thigh and inability to
ambulate after a fall. The affected extremity should be evaluated for shortening, rotation, and neurovascular integrity. Pain with log rolling or axial loading of the hip has
a high association with occult fracture. Radiographic evaluation should include an
AP pelvis x-ray and AP and cross-table lateral x-rays of the affected side. A traction
film or an internal rotation view may assist in the visualization of subtle fractures. If
a fracture is observed to extend beyond into the subtrochanteric region—defined as

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

63

the region 0 to 5 cm below the lesser trochanter—full-length femur films should be
acquired, as such facture patterns often require larger, longer intramedullary devices
that should be planned preoperatively. When there is sufficient clinical suggestion
of fracture despite normal x-ray findings, magnetic resonance imaging may be useful
in establishing the diagnosis.

Classiﬁcation
The Evans classification system divides intertrochanteric fractures into stable and
unstable fracture patterns. In stable fracture patterns, the posteromedial cortex is
intact or has minimal comminution, and thus it may still function to buttress against
fracture collapse. In unstable fracture patterns, the posteromedial cortex is often too
comminuted to prevent collapse of the fracture fragments, and fractures may fall
into varus and retroversion without appropriate fixation. Intertrochanteric fractures
with subtrochanteric extension are similarly unstable secondary to their propensity
to collapse. Reverse obliquity is a special type of unstable fracture pattern in which
the fracture line extends from the proximal medial to the distal lateral intertrochanteric region. In reverse obliquity fractures, the distal fragment may displace medially
secondary to both sheer forces and musculotendinous deforming forces if proper
fixation is not obtained.

TREATMENT
Nonoperative Treatment
Nonoperative treatment should be considered only for patients who are nonambulatory without significant pain and those for whom surgical treatment carries an unacceptable risk of mortality. Nonsurgical management is associated with increased
mortality rate, pneumonia infections, urinary tract infections, joint contractures,
deep vein thrombosis, decubitus ulcers, and dementia.

Operative Treatment
Like femoral neck fractures, operative fixation is the standard of care for the vast
majority of intertrochanteric fractures. Unlike nondisplaced femoral neck fractures,
however, intertrochanteric fractures do not necessarily demand urgent operative
intervention, because the abundant blood supply to the intertrochanteric region
makes complications such as nonunion and avascular necrosis relatively rare. That
stated, fracture fixation should ideally occur within the first 24 to 48 hours after
fracture, as this lowers the risks associated with prolonged hospitalization and
immobilization. The goal of surgery is to provide stable internal fixation to allow
full weightbearing and early mobilization. The most common implants used include
sliding hip screws and cephalomedullary nails.
Sliding Hip Screws: Before development of the cephalomedullary nail, the sliding hip screw was the most commonly used device for both stable and unstable fracture patterns. There are many sliding hip screw designs, but all consist of a side plate
ﬁxed to the lateral cortex of the femur and a lag screw placed into the femoral head.
The lag screw should be inserted so that it is within 1 cm of subchondral bone and

64

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

in a central position in the femoral head. Central placement should be assessed on
both lateral and AP views. A tip-apex distance of less than 25 mm is ideal and associated with a decreased incidence of screw cutout. Recent literature has demonstrated
that sliding hip screws have a higher rate of failure when used on unstable fracture
patterns, especially reverse obliquity fractures. Sliding hip screws continue to have
excellent outcomes in stable fracture patterns, however, with results that are at least
equivalent to those of cephalomedullary nails. Theoretically, sliding hip screws allow
a greater collapse and thus compression of fracture fragments as compared to cephalomedullary devices, a characteristic that is often desirable in the treatment of stable
intertrochanteric fracture patterns.
Cephalomedullary Nails: This device combines features of a sliding hip screw with
an intramedullary nail. Advantages include its ability to be inserted percutaneously
with limited blood loss, limited fracture exposure, and decreased soft tissue damage. In addition, owing to its intramedullary location, these devices are subjected
to lesser bending moments, resulting in its theoretical increased resistance to varus
forces. There are several variations of the cephalomedullary nail, but all consist of an
intramedullary nail and a femoral head component. The femoral head component
generally consists of one or more screw or blade devices that ﬁx within the center
of the femoral head and neck and then interlock distally with the intramedullary
nail component. Insertion of the intramedullary nail may be performed through
the piriformis fossa or through the greater trochanter. Piriformis nails are typically straight, as the piriformis fossa falls directly in line with the medullary canal of
normal femurs; trochanteric nails have a slight lateral curve that allows them to
be passed through the greater trochanter and then directed down the medullary
canal. Cephalomedullary nails are best suited for unstable intertrochanteric fractures,
including those with subtrochanteric extension, reverse obliquity, and comminuted
posteromedial cortices. When combined with a long intramedullary component,
cephalomedullary nails may also be used in the treatment of subtrochanteric fractures
(ie, fractures occurring 0-5 cm distal to the lesser trochanter).

Complications
Intertrochanteric fractures, like femoral neck fractures, are associated with a high
mortality rate, even when prompt operative fixation is achieved. After fracture,
patients have an increased relative risk of mortality that is at least double that of
their age-matched peers. Mortality rates range from 8.4% to 36% within the first
year after hip fracture.
Loss of fixation is a complication seen with intertrochanteric fractures. This most
commonly results from varus collapse of the proximal fragment with superior cutout
of the lag screw from the femoral head. The incidence of fixation failure is reported
to be as high as 20% in unstable fracture patterns. As stated, cutout may be significantly reduced when the tip-to-apex distance is < 25 mm.
Nonunion is rare, occurring in fewer than 2% of patients. It is most common in
patients with unstable fracture patterns. Due to the highly vascular nature of intertrochanteric bone, however, nonunion and avascular necrosis are significantly less
common after fixation in intertrochanteric fractures than in femoral neck fractures.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
5.1 A patient with an intertrochanteric hip fracture undergoes open reduction and
sliding hip screw application. Postoperative radiographs demonstrate that the
lag screw is inferiorly and anteriorly positioned in the femoral head, with a tipapex distance of 44 mm. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
A. Lag screw cutout
B. Lag screw loosening
C. Nonunion
D. Periprosthetic fracture
E. Lag screw breakage

A. Total hip arthroplasty
B. Bipolar hemiarthroplasty
C. External fixation
D. Sliding hip screw
E. Cephalomedullary nail fixation
5.3 Which of the following most typically represents the patient demographic and
scenario in which intertrochanteric femur fractures occur in the United States?
A.
B.
C.
D.

High-speed motor vehicle ejection accident in a 26-year-old man
Fall from standing in a 69-year-old woman
Fall from 3-story balcony in a 56-year-old man
Soccer-related internal rotation twisting injury in a 19-year-old woman

E. Twenty-year-old male pedestrian struck by a vehicle directly over the
greater trochanter

ANSWERS
5.1 A. A tip-to-apex distance of less than 25 mm is associated with a decreased
cutout rate of femoral head lag screws.
5.2 E. A reverse oblique intertrochanteric hip fracture is optimally treated with
cephalomedullary nail ﬁxation. Patients treated with a sliding hip screw for
reverse-obliquity fractures have a much higher failure rate, nearly 56% in one
study compared with 3% in the intramedullary nail group. Total hip arthroplasty, bipolar hemiarthroplasty, and external ﬁxation are very rarely used treatment options for intertrochanteric fractures. Arthroplasty is never ideal for an
otherwise healthy 49-year-old woman.

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

5.3 B. Although each of these mechanisms could result in an intertrochanteric
femur fracture, elderly women with low-energy mechanisms most typically suffer these fractures. The average age of intertrochanteric fracture is 66 to 76 years,
with published female-to-male ratios ranging from 2:1 to 8:1.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Suspect a hip fracture in any patient presenting with a foreshortened leg,
held in flexion and external rotation.



Low-energy falls from standing account for greater than 90% of hip fractures in patients > 50 years of age.



The stability of intertrochanteric fractures depends chiefly on the integrity
of the posteromedial cortex of the proximal femur, a thick area of vertically oriented cortical bone that buttresses against fracture collapse.

CASE 6
A 61-year-old woman with a previous right total hip replacement presented with severe
left hip osteoarthritis and underwent a left total hip replacement. The patient was
doing well and walking pain-free, when at 4 months postoperatively, she tripped while
stepping off a curb and landed directly onto her left side. She did not lose consciousness and only complained of left hip and groin pain and was not able to ambulate after
the fall. She was taken to the emergency department for evaluation. Her past medical
history is noncontributory, and her surgical history is as previously noted. Findings on
physical exam include pain with axial loading and internal/external rotation of the left
hip. Her skin is intact, and she has good sensation to light touch and motor function
through the L4-S1 distribution. She does not have any tenderness to palpation around
the knee or distally. She has 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. An anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the left hip is obtained (Figure 6–1).

ANSWERS TO CASE 6:
Periprosthetic Hip Fracture
Summary: A 61-year-old woman with a recent left total hip replacement sustained a
fall and injury to her left hip. Plain films of the left hip show a periprosthetic femur
fracture.
• Most likely diagnosis: Left periprosthetic femur fracture.
• Additional considerations: After identifying the fracture pattern and location,
the 2 most important aspects to consider are the stability of the prosthetic femoral stem and the quality of the remaining bone stock.
• Best treatment: Revision of the femoral component to a cementless, porous
coated long stem that bypasses the fracture by at least 2 cortical diameters. Fracture fixation is also required with cables, a plate, and/or strut graft.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand what to look for on radiographs in the setting of a periprosthetic
fracture, including fracture location, prosthesis fit, and bone stock.
2. Understand the Vancouver classification system of periprosthetic hip fractures
and how it can be used to guide the appropriate method of treatment.
3. Be familiar with the basic treatment options for periprosthetic hip fractures.
4. Recognize potential complications arising from their treatment.

Considerations
This patient is a 61-year-old woman who sustained a fall and a left periprosthetic femur fracture. Although the patient presented complaining of left hip
pain and sustained no other obvious injuries, it is important to rule out concomitant injuries, including head trauma or other musculoskeletal injuries.
A thorough neurovascular examination of the left lower extremity, including
sensory, and vascular assessments of the foot and ankle is mandatory. Movement of the hip, quadriceps, and hamstring may be limited as a result of pain,
but a thorough assessment of the distal musculature should be performed. In
addition, key questions regarding the patient’s functional status before the fall
may provide valuable insight: Was the patient able to ambulate without assistance? Did the patient have any thigh pain before the fall (which may indicate
the presence of an already loose femoral component)?
Given the patient’s inability to ambulate, she should be admitted to the hospital
for definitive management of her fracture. An appropriate medical workup should
be performed, including a chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests before
proceeding to the operating room. The medical team performing risk stratification

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

69

of the surgery should understand that revision surgery will likely require a prolonged
operative time and increased blood loss versus a primary, elective total hip arthroplasty. The orthopaedic team must preoperatively plan the surgical procedure and
ensure that all implants and options that may be used are readily available. Most
important, the patient must understand that in revision hip surgery, both the
rates of postoperative dislocation and infection are increased compared with
primary hip surgery.

APPROACH TO:
Periprosthetic Hip Fracture
DEFINITIONS
PERIPROSTHETIC FRACTURE: A break in the bone surrounding a joint
replacement prosthesis.
POROUS COATING: In total hip replacement, cementless implants commonly
have a region where the surface is covered in microscopic pores, which enhances
bone ingrowth for implant fixation.
SUBSIDENCE: In the setting of a total hip replacement, refers to the femoral
stem migrating distally after initial implantation, indicating a high likelihood of
a loose stem.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
As the number of patients in the population living with a total hip arthroplasty
continues to rise, the incidence of periprosthetic fractures also continues to increase.
Patients with total hip replacements span a wide age range, with elderly patients
being at increased risk for low energy falls, whereas younger, more active patients
may be at risk for higher energy trauma. The Mayo Clinic Joint Replacement Database reported the largest series of periprosthetic hip fractures and noted an incidence of 1% (238 of 23,980) in primary hip arthroplasties and 4% (252 of 6349)
in revision hip arthroplasties, although the overall incidence has been reported to
be as high as 18%. Periprosthetic hip fractures can occur both intraoperatively and
postoperatively, and it is key to accurately classify these fractures to determine the
appropriate treatment plan. The most critical consideration is to determine the stability of the implant, as simple fixation of a fracture surrounding a loose femoral stem
is likely to fail as a result of implant subsidence.
Risk factors for periprosthetic hip fractures are similar to those of the general
population. In the elderly, low-energy falls, particularly in the setting of osteoporosis
or inflammatory arthropathy, can lead to periprosthetic fractures. Another consideration pertains to the type of femoral component fixation and the use of either
a proximally or fully-porous coated implant. Currently, the majority of femoral

70

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

stems in primary total hip arthroplasty are implanted using cementless fixation, in
which the femoral stem has a proximal porous coating, allowing bony ingrowth and
fixation at the proximal aspect of the stem. This enables the stress from weightbearing to be transferred from the femoral head, through the proximal bone and calcar of
the femur, and then distally through the native femoral shaft. With these wedge-fit
tapered designs, proximal fractures may occur. With cylindrical fully-porous coated
stems, distal “split” fractures can occur.

Clinical Presentation
Patients typically present with a low-energy mechanism of injury, such as a fall from
standing, and have pain in the hip and femur, with or without the ability to ambulate.
It is key to determine any other sites of injury, including head trauma, and whether or
not the patient had any shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, or symptoms
indicating a cardiac or neurologic cause of their injury. Any symptoms in the lower
extremity before the injury should also be noted, along with signs of start-up thigh
pain (pain initiated with ambulation on rising from a chair) that may indicate a
loose femoral stem.
Prior surgical records and reports should be obtained to determine the prior
surgical approach, implant type and size, and any perioperative complications
including infection. The presence of prior infection should raise concerns of an
active infection, and further testing should be performed to rule out infection such
as hip aspiration, or cultures obtained intraoperatively. Of note, normal laboratory markers for occult infection such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
C-reactive protein can be falsely positive in the setting of a fracture and thus are
of limited utility. As always, a thorough medical history should be obtained. A
detailed examination of the affected lower extremity, including a complete neurovascular examination, and assessment of prior incisions and skin integrity should
be performed. In addition, any leg length discrepancy should also be noted to assist
with preoperative planning.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of a periprosthetic hip fracture can typically be made using standard
radiographs. Radiographs should include an AP of the pelvis, AP and lateral of the
hip, and AP and lateral of the femur. Visualization of the entire femur is critical to
assess the presence and distal extent of the fracture. To determine the stability of the
implant, comparison to prior radiographs is useful to assess any increase in periprosthetic bone loss or implant subsidence that may suggest component loosening. With
cementless femoral implants, the point at which the metal stem narrows proximally
to become the femoral neck is typically aligned with the proximal, medial aspect of
the native femur. If this point on the femoral stem migrates distally (or a fracture
causes the medial aspect of the native femur to migrate proximally or displace),
then the femoral stem is loose and needs to be revised. It is critical to assess both the
acetabular and femoral components for both position and signs of loosening, as signs
of acetabular loosening may warrant revision of the acetabular component during
concomitant fixation of the femur fracture. Ultrasound, computed tomography, and
magnetic resonance imaging are not routinely required.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

TREATMENT
The treatment of a periprosthetic hip fracture is guided by the Vancouver classification system (Table 6–1). Type A fractures include fractures of the greater trochanter (AG) and lesser trochanter (AL). Greater trochanter fractures are stable when
minimally displaced, but may require surgical treatment with a plate if displaced
proximally. Lesser trochanter fractures can often be treated nonoperatively. However, if a significant portion of the calcar is involved, leading to destabilization of the
stem, then revision of the femoral stem with fixation of the calcar/lesser trochanter
with cables or supplementary plate fixation surrounding the greater trochanter is
required.
Type B fractures occur around or just below the tip of the femoral stem. A B1
fracture occurs around a well-fixed stem and can be treated with plates and screws
and possibly cortical strut allografts and cables. A B2 fracture occurs around or just
below an unstable stem, and thus revision of the femoral stem is required. Typically,
long porous-coated cementless stems are used to bypass the fracture and to achieve
distal fixation. In addition, the fracture fragment is fixed using plates, cables, or cortical strut allografts. A B3 fracture is distinguished from a B2 fracture, as B3 fractures
possess insufficient bone stock. Therefore, B3 fractures are also treated with femoral
component revision and fracture fixation, but often require special techniques such
as bone grafting or implantation of a proximal femoral replacement.
Type C fractures occur well below the femoral prosthesis and thus are treated
with fixation of the fracture itself, without revision of the femoral or acetabular
components.

Complications
Complications after the treatment of periprosthetic hip fractures include failure of
the fracture to heal appropriately (nonunion), failure of femoral stem fixation
(commonly owing to misdiagnosis of the initial stability of the stem), infection,
dislocation, thromboembolic complications, and medical morbidity and mortality
related to the surgical treatment itself.

6.2 A 75-year-old woman who is 2 years removed from a right total hip arthroplasty
sustains a fall and a nondisplaced greater trochanter fracture. The femoral stem
appears stable on both anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the hip and
femur. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?
A. Open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture using a greater trochanter plate and cables
B. Resume all activities as tolerated, with no restrictions
C. Weightbearing as tolerated, but with no passive adduction past midline and
no active abduction of the lower extremity
D. Nonweightbearing to the right lower extremity
6.3 A 79-year-old woman undergoes successful treatment of a Vancouver B2 periprosthetic femur fracture with a long porous-coated cementless stem, cables,
and a cortical strut allograft. Which of the following complications is she at an
increased risk for as compared with those patients who have undergone primary
total hip arthroplasty?
A. Infection
B. Dislocation
C. Deep vein thrombosis
D. A and B
E. A, B, and C

ANSWERS
6.1 C. This patient sustained a periprosthetic left femur fracture. Because the stem
appears stable proximally with no fracture extending proximally and no radiolucency surrounding the stem, this is likely a Vancouver B1 fracture. Vancouver
B2 fractures would be similarly at the tip of the prosthesis, but would involve
a loosened stem. Vancouver A fractures involve 1 of the 2 trochanters. Type C
fractures occur distal to the prosthesis.
6.2 C. This patient sustained a nondisplaced greater trochanter fracture (AG) and
thus should initially be treated conservatively. The patient can continue to
be weightbearing as tolerated, but should observe hip abduction precautions
(movements that may cause the greater trochanter fracture to displace). The
patient should receive sequential radiographs, and if the fracture demonstrates
worsening displacement, then open reduction internal fixation of the fracture
can be considered.
6.3 E. Revision hip surgery, particularly in the setting of a periprosthetic fracture,
is extremely challenging. Unfortunately, the results are often less satisfactory
than those seen with elective primary hip replacement. Postoperative complications occur more frequently in this setting and include infection, dislocation,
and deep vein thrombosis, in addition to nerve palsy, cortical perforation, and
fracture.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The incidence of periprosthetic hip fractures continues to rise as a result
of the increasing number of patients in the population with total hip
arthroplasties.



Radiographs of the entire femur must be obtained to assess the presence
and entire extent of the fracture, along with stability of the femoral stem.



Key aspects to consider regarding the classification and treatment of periprosthetic hip fractures are the stability of the femoral stem and the quality of the remaining bone stock.



If the femoral stem is suspected to be unstable or loose, revision of the
femoral stem should be performed, as fixation of a fracture in the setting
of a loose femoral stem often leads to fracture nonunion and implant
failure.

CASE 7
A 26-year-old African American male athlete reports to clinic after injuring his knee
the night before while he was practicing squats and dead lifts for his upcoming
weightlifting competition. He states he felt a “pop” as he began to stand during
his second set of squats. He complains of intense pain and an inability to lift his
leg or bear any weight on it. These symptoms began immediately after the pop.
During the physical examination, the patient is found to have pain with palpation just below the patella. Although he is found to have good quadriceps tone,
he is unable to perform a straight leg raise. All motor and sensory findings are
otherwise normal. It is decided that radiographs should be obtained, which subsequently show patella alta. His past medical history and review of systems are
otherwise unremarkable.

ANSWERS TO CASE 7:
Patellar Tendon Rupture
Summary: A 26-year-old African American male athlete who is a competitive
weightlifter injured his left knee while performing dead lifts in the gym. He felt a
pop in his knee and reported pain with considerable swelling to the anterior aspect.
He has pain with palpation over the inferior pole of the patella and is unable to
perform a straight leg raise, even though he has good quadriceps tone. All motor
and sensory findings are otherwise normal. An x-ray identifies patella alta. His past
medical history and review of systems are otherwise unremarkable.
• Most likely diagnosis: Patellar tendon rupture
• Treatment: Surgery for patellar tendon repair within 2 weeks. Before surgery, he
is to ice and elevate his leg to help diminish the local swelling. The leg should
be braced in extension to minimize further gapping and proximal retraction of
the patella. After surgery, the leg will be protected in extension followed by
gradual, progressive range-of-motion exercises.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the causes of patellar tendon rupture.
2. Understand the prevalence of the injury.
3. Be familiar with the populations that are most often affected.
4. Understand the therapy options.

Considerations
This is a 26-year-old African American male athlete who has presented with a story,
physical exam, and radiographic findings consistent with a patellar tendon rupture.
Although his story identifies repetitive microtrauma as the likely cause of his patellar
tendon rupture, other predisposing factors must be investigated. In the setting of a
competitive weightlifter, such as this gentleman, anabolic steroid use as a contributing factor should be contemplated. Because this is an acute rupture in a healthy
young adult, surgical repair is indicated within 2 weeks from the date of injury.
Surgical technique will vary based on the location of the rupture. Because most
tears occur at the osseotendinous juncture between the tendon and inferior pole of
the patella, bone tunnels and heavy suture will likely be required. It is also important
to note that although no palpable gap was felt below the inferior patellar pole on
physical exam, this would not be an uncommon finding.

APPROACH TO:
Patellar Tendon Rupture
DEFINITIONS
TENDINITIS: A term describing tendon inflammation.
TENDINOSIS: A term referring to chronic inflammation of a tendon, in which
damage occurs at the cellular level. It is thought to be caused by repetitive microtrauma that increases the chance of a tendon rupture.
JUMPER’S KNEE: A phrase used to describe patellar tendon pathology, including tendonitis and tendinosis. These conditions typically occur in athletes involved
in jumping sports such as basketball and volleyball and are therefore referred to as
Jumper’s knee.
BLUMENSAAT LINE: A line drawn along the roof of the intercondylar notch on
a lateral radiograph with the knee in 30 degrees of flexion. This line should intersect
the inferior border of the patella. In patella alta, which occurs in the setting of a
patella tendon rupture, the distal pole of the patella is elevated above this line.
INSALL-SALVATI RATIO: Determined on a lateral radiograph and is the length
of the patella tendon/length of the patella (the greatest diagonal length). The relationship should be 1.0. A ratio of 1.2 or more indicates patella alta, whereas a ratio
of less than or equal to 0.8 indicates patella baja (seen in the setting of a quadriceps
tendon rupture).
EXTENSOR MECHANISM OF THE KNEE: A network consisting of the quadriceps musculature, quadriceps tendon, patella, patellar tendon, tibial tubercle, and
adjacent soft tissues that serves to extend or straighten the knee joint with the leg
elevated and to stabilize the knee joint when the foot is planted on the ground.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiology
The patella’s role in the extensor mechanism is to establish a mechanical advantage
in knee extension by increasing the moment arm of the quadriceps muscle. For the
patellar tendon to rupture, an eccentric and violent quadriceps contraction must
occur with the knee partially flexed. Less frequently, penetrating trauma can cause
a tear. Ruptures can be classified as complete or incomplete and as intrasubstance or
as occurring at the insertion site of the tendon onto the inferior pole of the patella
(an avulsion-type injury). Tendon avulsion from the tibial tuberosity is encountered
less frequently.
It is uncommon for the patellar tendon to rupture in healthy tendon, and when
it does, it is most commonly due to repetitive microtrauma. Although there is no
clear age or sex predisposition for this injury, it is more commonly seen in those with
an underlying disease that causes weakness in the tendon, predisposing it to rupture.
Such diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, lupus, gout, and chronic renal
insufficiency. The tendon may also become weakened from anabolic steroid use or
chronic use of corticosteroid medication injected directly into the tendon.

80

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

Physical Examination
The patient typically presents with a gross deformity of the knee, which includes an
effusion and proximal retraction of the patella when compared with the contralateral, normal knee. Palpation may reveal an intrasubstance defect or one at its inferior pole. With an acute tear, the patient will have difficulty weightbearing, and the
knee may buckle or feel as if it is going to “give out.” When asked, the patient may
recall an audible “pop” that had occurred at the time of injury and may be unable to
perform a straight leg raise. However, one’s ability to perform a straight leg raise does
not completely rule out the presence of a patellar tendon rupture. In certain cases,
the tendon can be ruptured while the adjacent medial and lateral retinacula of the
knee remain intact, enabling the patient to perform some active extension. In such
cases, the patient will, however, likely lack several degrees of terminal extension.

Radiographic Diagnosis
Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs are usually sufficient in confirming
the diagnosis. The Blumensaat line and the Insall-Salvati ratio are derived from
the lateral radiographs and aid in identifying both quadriceps and patellar tendon
injury (Figure 7–1). At times, it may be useful to obtain a lateral radiograph of the

A

line (A), and the Insall-Salvati ratio is approximately 1.0 (B/C).

81

contralateral knee for comparison. In equivocal cases in which diagnosis is unclear,
ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used. MRI can distinguish
complete from partial ruptures, assist in determining the size of the tear, and also
identify any concomitant injuries.

TREATMENT
Nonoperative treatment is limited to incomplete ruptures in which normal or nearnormal knee extension is present. In such cases, management consists of immobilization with the knee in full extension for 4 to 6 weeks. Acute, complete tears
require surgical repair unless there is a medical contraindication. It is ideally performed within 2 weeks of the initial injury to prevent further tendon retraction,
scar formation, and muscle atrophy. Midsubstance tears are repaired end to end with
a heavy nonabsorbable suture. However, ruptures most commonly occur at the osseotendinous juncture, a location that is not amenable to end-to-end repair. In this setting,
the patellar tendon is reattached to its insertion using bone tunnels and heavy suture.
The repair can be augmented with a cerclage suture, as is often done for midsubstance tears, in patients with systemic illnesses that have predisposed them to
rupture (ie, diabetes), or in those who will likely undergo aggressive early postoperative range-of-motion exercises. Postoperative rehabilitation protocols vary from
surgeon to surgeon. A common practice is to immobilize the leg in extension for
10 to 14 days, followed by progressive, protected range of motion. Isometric quadriceps
strengthening may begin immediately postoperatively. The return to full activity
could take up to 6 to 12 months. Furthermore, the patient will be allowed to return
to sports only after a complete return of strength and range of motion has occurred.
Chronic ruptures are more difficult to repair and typically result in less favorable outcomes, as tendon degeneration and contraction make end-to-end apposition difficult
to achieve. Surgery involves extensive mobilization of the tendon, lysis of scar tissue,
and at times the use of an interposition flap or graft to bridge the gap and achieve a
complete repair. This is a technically more demanding procedure and is less than ideal.

Complications
Complications include wound infection, patellofemoral arthritis, rerupture, and
loss of knee motion. Difficulty in attaining full extension is most commonly due to
quadriceps atrophy, highlighting the importance of early postoperative quadriceps
strengthening.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

7.2 Which of the following structures is not part of the knee’s extensor mechanism?
A. Quadriceps tendon
B. Patella tendon
C. Biceps femoris
D. Tibial tubercle
7.3 A 55-year-old male slips on a patch of ice and falls on a hyperflexed knee. He
reports hearing a “pop” during the fall and was unable to bear weight on the
knee immediately after the injury. He has a large knee effusion on examination
and is unable to perform a straight leg raise. You appreciate his patella baja on
radiographic examination and an Insall-Salvati ratio of 0.7. What is the likely
diagnosis?
A. Patellar dislocation
B. Quadriceps tendon rupture
C. Patellar tendon rupture
D. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear

ANSWERS
7.1 C. Sports such as basketball, football, soccer, and volleyball place high eccentric loads on the extensor mechanism and are associated with patellar tendon
rupture. Primary surgical repair is always indicated for complete, acute tears.
7.2 C. The biceps femoris is not part of the extensor mechanism, but instead performs
knee flexion. The other muscles are part of the knee extensor mechanism.
7.3 B. The differential diagnosis for any patient with a history of recent trauma to
the knee and an inability to straight leg raise must include both quadriceps and
patellar tendon ruptures. In patients older than 40 years, such as this patient,
quadriceps tendon ruptures are more common; patella tendon ruptures are more
frequently seen in patients younger than 40 years. The diagnosis of a ruptured
quadriceps tendon is also supported in this patient by the radiographic finding
of patellar baja and an Insall-Salvati ratio of less then 0.8. Both ACL and acute
dislocations of the patella occur after noncontact pivoting injuries, making such
diagnoses unlikely in this patient. Although physical exam may reveal large
knee effusions in such patients, they should not lose their ability to actively
straight leg raise.

ANSWERS TO CASE 8:
Tibial Plateau Fracture
Summary: A 43-year-old man sustained a direct, high-energy injury to his left knee.
Plain films of the left knee show a split depression of the medial condyle without
lateral condylar involvement.
• Most likely diagnosis: Left tibia medial plateau split fracture, or a Schatzker IV injury
• Additional injuries: Meniscal tears, collateral and cruciate ligamentous injuries, peroneal nerve, popliteal artery injury (typically associated with medial
plateau fractures), and compartment syndrome are soft-tissue injuries associated
with tibial plateau fractures.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the anatomical and mechanistic principles behind the Schatzker
classification of tibial plateau fractures.
2. Be familiar with basic treatment options for tibial plateau fractures.
3. Recognize potential complications arising from both the initial injuries and their
treatments.

Considerations
This patient sustained a high-energy, direct impact injury to the region immediately below his right knee. In addition to his medial plateau fracture, he is
at significant risk for several additional injuries, including collateral ligament
complex, peroneal nerve injury, and popliteal artery injury. Medial meniscal
tears may occur in up to 50% of plateau fractures, most commonly occurring
with medial plateau injuries; likewise, lateral meniscal injuries are associated
with lateral plateau fractures. Ligamentous integrity should be evaluated. A careful
neurovascular evaluation is also essential. Although this patient has palpable pulses
distal to his injury, a pulseless limb must be evaluated with Doppler probe and/or
ankle-brachial index measurements (normal > 0.9). Should audible Doppler
waveforms be absent or diminished compared with the uninvolved side, vascular
surgery should be consulted and the patient will likely require arteriography to
evaluate the integrity of the popliteal artery.
Although this patient sustained no other obvious injuries, his mechanism warrants a complete and thorough physical exam, typically performed by a trauma team,
with careful examination of all extremities and the axial skeleton performed by an
orthopaedist. Although some tibial plateau fractures may be immobilized and sent
away from the emergency department for outpatient follow-up, the high-energy
nature of this injury necessitates admission to the hospital. As an inpatient, frequent
leg compartment checks may easily be performed to ensure this patient does not
develop a compartment syndrome. Intimal damage to the popliteal artery may take
up to 48 hours to become symptomatic.

APPROACH TO:
Tibial Plateau Fracture
DEFINITIONS
TIBIAL PLATEAU: Term describing the weightbearing area of the proximal tibia.
It is composed of the concave medial plateau and smaller convex lateral plateau.
These regions are separated by the intercondylar eminence.
SCHATZKER CLASSIFICATION: A widely used classification system for tibial
plateau fractures that helps orthopaedic surgeons with assessing the initial injury,
formulating a management plan, and predicting prognosis. The classification divides
tibial plateau fractures into 6 types.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Anatomy and Mechanisms of Injury
The tibial plateau is the predominantly cancellous region of bone that articulates
with the distal femur. It includes the relatively larger, stronger, and more concave
medial plateau and the relatively weaker, smaller, and more convex lateral plateau.
Medial plateau injuries, therefore, typically result from higher energy mechanisms,
which are defined as falls from greater than 12 feet or sudden-impact mechanisms
such as motor vehicle collisions or bumper versus pedestrian events. Lateral plateau
injuries, conversely, may occur from low-energy falls from standing in elderly osteoporotic patients. The direction and magnitude of fracture force, in addition to the
underlying quality of bone, determine the fracture pattern.

Classification
The Schatzker classification is commonly used to describe tibial plateau fractures.
They are classified in the following way:
Type I

Lateral split

Type II

Lateral split depression

Type III

Lateral pure depression

Type IV

Medial plateau split and/or depression

Type V

Bicondylar

Type VI

Metaphyseal-diaphyseal disassociation

Schatzker I through III fractures are generally considered low-energy injuries,
whereas IV through VI injuries are high-energy injuries (Figure 8–2). Young adults
with strong bone typically exhibit split fractures and have increased propensity to
suffer ligamentous damage; older patients with osteoporotic bone are more inclined
to suffer depression and split-depression patterns in the absence of ligamentous damage. Medial injuries (type IV) are considered by some authors to represent transient
knee dislocations that have spontaneously reduced; the incidence of neurovascular
injury is thus higher with these events.

Radiographic Evaluation
In addition to the AP and lateral films mentioned previously, oblique views of the
proximal tibia (40 degrees of internal and external rotation) should be obtained to
better visualize the fracture. Computed tomography may be helpful in evaluating
depressions and comminution for preoperative planning. Magnetic resonance imaging may be used to evaluate menisci and ligamentous damage.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

89

TREATMENT
Low-energy, nondisplaced, or minimally displaced fractures may be treated nonoperatively. Patients typically receive a hinged knee brace for 8 to 12 weeks and may gradually progress to partial then full weightbearing. Nonambulating patients, patients
with severely osteoporotic bone, or those not medically fit for surgery may receive
similar management. Indications for surgical fixation generally include Schatzker
IV through VI fractures as well as I through III fractures exhibiting articular stepoff greater than 3 mm, condylar widening greater than 5 mm, or instability with
varus or valgus stress. Typical procedures include open-reduction internal fixation,
or, for cases in which a satisfactory closed reduction is achieved, percutaneous screw
fixation. Depressions of the articular surface often require bone grafting to fill the
voids. Depressions may be filled with autogenous bone graft, allogenic bone graft, or
bone substitutes, the strongest of which is calcium phosphate cement.
Often, patients with tibial plateau injuries have sustained additional severe and
life-threatening injuries that make them unfit for lengthy surgical procedures. These
patients may benefit from temporary but fast external fixation that preserves the
length and anatomical alignment of the tibia and allows for definitive fixation at
a later date. Temporary external fixation is indicated similarly in patients whose
severe soft-tissue swelling prohibits immediate surgical fixation.

Outcomes and Complications
Degenerative joint disease or posttraumatic arthritis of the knee is a common complication, often occurring 5 or more years after the initial injury. The incidence
of arthritis is increased with significant cartilaginous or ligamentous injury and
malalignment of the knee’s mechanical axis or articular incongruity after repair.
Additionally, Schatzker VI fractures, with their characteristic separation of metaphysis from diaphysis, may exhibit nonunion or malunion at this junction.

department with complaints of left wrist and knee pain. He reports landing on

A. Increased chance of lateral plateau injury, increased chance of pure depression fracture, and increased chance of ligamentous and/or meniscal damage
B. Increased chance of medial plateau injury, increased chance of pure depression fracture, and increased chance of ligamentous damage
C. Increased chance of lateral plateau injury, increased chance of split fracture,
and increased chance of ligamentous damage
D. Increased chance of medial plateau injury, increased chance of split fracture,
and increased chance of ligamentous damage

and decreased chance of ligamentous damage

8.3 A 44-year-old woman is involved in a high-speed motor accident and suffers a
right-sided tibial plateau fracture. She is neurovascularly intact, and her compartments are soft. She has no other significant injuries, except for a minor
concussion and several broken ribs. Which of the following, if present, is an
indication for operative fixation?
A. Articular step-off 5 mm
B. Lateral meniscal tear on follow-up MRI
C. ACL tear on follow-up MRI
D. Condylar widening < 3 mm
E. Ipsilateral ankle fracture

ANSWERS
8.1 C. Given this young patient’s relatively strong bone, he is most likely to sustain
a split fracture with ligamentous injury, as compared with elderly people with
softer bone, who typically sustain depression-type injuries without ligamentous
damage. Furthermore, given the axial/valgus (knee inward) force as described in
his fall, he is most likely to exhibit a lateral split type injury.
8.2 D. This is a bicondylar split fracture, or a Schatzker V. Schatzker IV, V, and
VI fractures are typically treated with open-reduction internal fixation in the
absence of significant swelling or other contraindications.
8.3 A. Indications for operative fixation for tibial plateau fractures include highenergy plateau injuries (Schatzker IV through VI) or any plateau fracture with
articular step-off greater than 3 mm, condylar widening greater than 5 mm, or
instability with varus or valgus stresses. Concomitant ACL, meniscal, or even
ankle fractures are not necessarily indications for fixation if the reduction is
adequate and the fracture is immobilized.

CLINCAL PEARLS


High-energy tibial plateau injuries (Schatzker IV, V, VI) are frequently associated with significant comorbidities, including compartment syndrome
and neurovascular injury in the affected extremity. Advanced trauma life
support protocol in such situations must be followed.



Upwards of 50% of plateau fractures are associated with meniscal tears;
ACL injuries are found in approximately 30% of injuries.

ANSWERS TO CASE 9:
Open Tibia Fracture
Summary: A 34-year-old man presents to the ED with a grossly deformed left leg
status post a motorcycle accident in which he crashed into a pickup truck. There is
an open and grossly contaminated tibia fracture, as road debris was initially found in
the wound. His left lower extremity is neurovascularly intact. Although tachycardic,
his other vital signs are within normal limits and he appears hemodynamically stable. No other injuries are noted.
• Most likely diagnosis: Open tibia and fibula fracture
• Next steps in management: Emergency room management including tetanus
prophylaxis, administration of intravenous antibiotics, provisional irrigation,
wound dressing, fracture splinting, and operative planning
• General operative approach: Wound debridement and fracture stabilization
with an understanding of the potential need for secondary operations for skin,
soft tissue, and bone reconstruction

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the stages of care for open tibia fractures.
2. Know how to classify open fractures (Table 9–1).
3. Understand the role of emergency room management, antibiotics (Table 9–2),
and operative intervention.
4. Be familiar with the potential risks and complications of open fractures.

Considerations
This 34-year-old man presented with an open left tibia and fibula fracture after a
motorcycle accident. The first priority should be for evaluation and treatment of
life-threatening injuries by the ED and trauma physicians, as dictated by advanced
trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. After identification and treatment of such
injuries, orthopaedic assessment of the limb should ensue and includes evaluation of
the soft tissue damage and neurovascular status. History, dimensions, and location of
the open wounds must be documented. Obtaining a photograph may also be helpful
during the initial exam.
In the ED, tetanus prophylaxis and intravenous antibiotics should be administered immediately (Table 9–2). Provisional lavage of the wound with an adequate
quantity of sterile saline should be performed. Any contaminants such as dirt and
grass should be removed from the wound before it is covered with a sterile dressing.
Fracture reduction should occur with placement in a well-padded splint. The limb’s
neurovascular status should be documented before and after alignment. Pending
stable labs and clearance by the trauma team, this patient should ideally be taken to
the operating room within 6 to 8 hours from the time of injury for wound debridement and fracture stabilization.

APPROACH TO:
Open Tibia Fracture
DEFINITIONS
OPEN FRACTURES: Fractures that communicate with the outside environment.
These complex injuries involve both the bone and surrounding soft tissues and mandate management strategies focused on prevention of infection, fracture union, and
restoration of function.
GUSTILO AND ANDERSON OPEN FRACTURE CLASSIFICATION:
Classification system incorporating the amount of energy, severity of soft tissue
injury, and degree of contamination for determination of fracture severity.
ZONE OF INJURY: A concept describing the true dimensions of the wound, as
opposed to simply the skin wound, which may only be a small opening through which
the true wound communicates with the exterior. This is often seen in fractures that
have significant muscle coverage, such as femoral and humeral shaft fractures.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

97

VACUUM-ASSISTED WOUND CLOSURE (VAC): The gold standard for
temporary management of open fracture wounds. It exposes the wound bed to a
mechanically induced negative pressure in a closed system that facilitates granulation
tissue formation while removing fluid from the extravascular space, reducing edema
and improving microcirculation.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Initial Assessment
Open tibia fractures are high-energy injuries. As such, identification of other lifethreatening injuries is vital. Once these injuries have been identified and adequately
treated, attention must be directed toward the traumatized extremity. History and
physical exam should focus on mechanism of injury, neurovascular status of the
extremity, compartment syndrome, size of the soft tissue defect, periosteal stripping,
fracture pattern, bone loss, and contamination. This knowledge will help to classify
the fracture, determine treatment, and establish prognosis. Of note, the degree of
soft-tissue damage and contamination is important in classifying open fractures
(Table 9–1).
It is important to recognize that the diagnosis of open fractures can be missed, as
seen when a small puncture wound is the only defect or when a wound is located
posteriorly and the examining physician fails to inspect the limb circumferentially.
Plain radiographs can also be used to aid in this diagnosis and may depict fracture
comminution, displacement, bone loss, and/or subcutaneous air.
Emergency room management of an open tibia fracture requires a team-oriented
approach between orthopaedic, ED, and trauma staff. Gross contaminants such as
leaves and grass must be removed from the wound, and irrigation with sterile saline
solution should be performed. There is no consensus regarding optimal volume,
delivery method, and irrigation solution. After provisional lavage, a dry sterile
dressing should be applied and not be removed until the operating room. The tibia
should be reduced and placed in a splint. Tetanus prophylaxis, if necessary, must be
administered and intravenous antibiotics given (Table 9–2).
Systemic antibiotics must be started as soon as possible, as a delay of >3 hours
increases the risk of infection. Although duration of antibiotic therapy is controversial, most physicians who treat open fractures believe that it should be limited
to 3 days. At wound closure, or after any major surgical procedure, an additional
3-day course of antibiotics should be given. Local therapy, in the form of antibioticimpregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads, can be inserted into the fracture wound
or inside the bone defect. This is often reserved for select grade II and III injuries.

Operative Intervention
Primary surgery ideally occurs within 6 to 8 hours from the time of injury. However,
there are little data to support this timeline. In the operating room, a more thorough
examination of the wound occurs, with a determination of the true zone of injury.
Irrigation and debridement is performed, as the presence of nonviable tissue and
foreign objects promotes bacterial growth. The ultimate goal is a clean wound with
viable tissue and no infection. In significantly contaminated wounds, additional
debridement may be necessary after 24 to 48 hours.

98

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

After wound care, the fracture reduction and fixation occurs. The decision to
temporarily versus definitively stabilize the fracture depends on the general condition of the patient, extent of injury and fracture pattern. In the setting of an open
tibia fracture, fixation options include temporary external fixation and intramedullary nailing. Regardless of whether temporary or definitive fixation is chosen, the
goals are to restore the tibia to its normal length and alignment, as this reduces
dead space and hematoma volume. The stabilization provided will also prevent
additional damage from mobile bone fragments and promote healing. With the
exception of cases with heavy bacterial contamination, significant soft tissue damage, or vascular injury (grades IIIb and IIIc), intramedullary nailing is preferable.
The current standard of care for open fracture wounds is for them to be initially
left open, with delayed wound closure within 2 to 7 days. This is done to facilitate
additional drainage and debridement and to prevent anaerobic conditions. Initial
coverage of the wound includes sterile dressings and vacuum-assisted wound
closure (VAC).

Secondary Surgery
Definitive fracture management may occur at a later date if only temporary fixation was
performed with an external fixator. This is done when swelling has subsided and the
condition of the soft tissues has improved. Soft tissue and skin coverage should occur
within 7 days. Infection risk increases in wounds left open for longer periods of time.

Risks and Complications
The major risk associated with open fractures is infection, which can lead to amputation, loss of function, delayed union, malunion, or nonunion. Delayed union and
nonunion are more common in open than closed fractures. The frequency of all of
the preceding risk factors increases with the severity of the initial injury. Prolonged
immobilization may also occur, not only because of the open fracture, but also
because of other associated injuries that may have been incurred. The patient must
understand these risks and that multiple surgeries may be necessary. Appropriate
rehabilitation is crucial in regard to optimizing outcomes of open fractures.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

9.2 What antibiotic should the patient in question 9.1 receive?
A. Vancomycin
B. Penicillin
C. Levaquin
D. Cefazolin
E. Cephalexin
9.3 A 70-year-old woman is brought to the trauma center with a significantly
deformed right lower extremity with a 4-cm wound over the posteromedial portion of her leg. She is found to have a Gustilo and Anderson type 3A fracture.
Which of the following interventions has been shown to decrease the risk of
infection at the fracture site?
A. Irrigating with high-pressure pulsatile lavage
B. Immediate prophylactic antibiotic administration
C. Application of a wound VAC of the soft tissue defect in the ED
D. Operative debridement within 6 to 8 hours of injury

ANSWERS
9.1 A. This is a Gustilo and Anderson type I fracture. There is a simple fracture
pattern in the setting of clean, <1-cm wound.
9.2 D. Type I fractures should receive an intravenous first-generation cephalosporin
such as cefazolin (Table 9–2). Vancomycin, penicillin, and Levaquin are not
cephalosporins. Cephalexin, although a cephalosporin, is an oral antibiotic and
thus is not indicated for an open fracture.
9.3 B. The duration to beginning of antibiotic administration and adequate surgical debridement of the wound are the only factors definitively shown to reduce
infection and improve outcome in open fractures. Although traditional recommendations include surgical irrigation and debridement within 6 to 8 hours of
injury, there is no literature to support this time window. There is also no evidence to support pulsatile lavage over gravity flow. Finally, in this setting there
is also no role for wound VAC application in the ED.

CASE 10
A 68-year-old right-hand dominant woman presented to the emergency room with
a chief complaint of right shoulder pain and loss of motion. Earlier that morning,
she sustained a mechanical fall onto her right side after slipping on a patch of ice. She
denied any head strike or loss of consciousness and denied pain besides that
in her right shoulder. Her past medical history is remarkable for osteoporosis and
hyperlipidemia. She did sustain a left wrist fracture 5 years earlier, which was treated
with a cast. She currently takes alendronate and simvastatin. She has no past surgical
history. On examination, she appears in pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits.
She has significant ecchymosis of her right upper arm. Her sensation is intact in her
right arm within the radial, ulnar, median, and axillary nerve distributions. She has
5/5 strength in her biceps, triceps, wrist flexors, wrist extensors, and all finger flexors
and extensors, as well as the interossei muscles. She is unable to forward flex or
abduct her right shoulder. She has significant pain with any passive range of motion
of the shoulder. The remainder of her exam is within normal limits. A single portable
radiograph is obtained of the right shoulder and is shown in Figure 10–1.

ANSWERS TO CASE 10:
Proximal Humerus Fracture
Summary: A 68-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis and previous fragility
fracture presents with acute-onset right shoulder pain after a mechanical fall. Her
exam is remarkable for an ecchymotic right arm and the inability to move her right
shoulder due to pain. She is neurovascularly intact distally.
• Most likely diagnosis: The most likely diagnosis is a fracture of the proximal
humerus. Other diagnostic considerations for acute shoulder pain following
trauma includes fractures of the shoulder girdle (clavicle, scapula), glenohumeral dislocation (aka shoulder dislocation), acromioclavicular dislocation
(aka shoulder separation), and acute rotator cuff tear.
• Next diagnostic step: The next step in diagnosis requires appropriate plain
radiographic imaging of the right shoulder to confirm the exact fracture pattern and exclude other injuries including glenohumeral dislocation. This
should include at a minimum an anteroposterior view, a scapular Y view and
an axillary view. It is critical to obtain an acceptable axillary view in order to
rule out dislocation of the glenohumeral joint. Based on the AP radiograph
presented, this is a valgus impacted, three part proximal humerus fracture
with displacement of the greater tuberosity and humeral head.
• Next step in therapy: Sling immobilization of the right shoulder is the next
step with consideration of operative treatment depending on the amount of
displacement.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the typical patient demographics and mechanism of injury associated
with proximal humerus fractures and understand what constitutes an appropriate
workup for this injury.
2. Understand the Neer classification and deforming forces for proximal humerus
fractures.
3. Be familiar with the various treatment options for proximal humerus fractures.

Considerations
This 68-year-old female presented with right shoulder pain and loss of motion following a mechanical fall. The differential diagnosis must include fracture, shoulder
dislocation, rotator cuff tear, and/or a combination of these injuries. A thorough
physical exam and appropriate imaging studies will help distinguish these conditions.
The exam is crucial, as both proximal humerus fractures and shoulder dislocations
are associated with nerve injury.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

103

Once exam and imaging confirm the diagnosis of a proximal humerus fracture,
the orthopaedic surgeon must decide the appropriate treatment, which includes
both nonoperative and operative modalities. The patient’s general condition, functional status, comorbidities, and the specific type of proximal humerus fracture will
factor into the clinical decision-making. In the ED, a sling is typically satisfactory for
initial stabilization. However, in the setting of a concurrent glenohumeral dislocation, attempts to reduce the humeral head may also be required.

APPROACH TO:
Proximal Humerus Fracture
DEFINITIONS
OSTEOPOROSIS: The most common metabolic bone disease, characterized by
a loss in skeletal mass resulting in microarchitectural changes and increasing bone
fragility.
PROXIMAL HUMERUS FRACTURE “PART”: Based on the Neer classification
of proximal humerus fractures. A proximal humerus is composed of 4 potential parts:
the head or articular surface, the greater tuberosity, the lesser tuberosity, and the shaft.
To be considered a “part,” each fragment must be displaced at least 1 cm or 45 degrees.
Deforming forces are applied to each part as a result of its respective muscular attachments. The greater tuberosity part is displaced by the supraspinatus and infraspinatus
pulling it posteromedially, the lesser tuberosity part is displaced by the subscapularis
tendon pulling it medially, and the shaft part is typically deformed in an apex anterior
and abducted position by the insertions of the deltoid and pectoralis major.
NONUNION: Failure of the ends of a fractured bone to heal. Prevalence of
nonunion with proximal humerus fractures is approximately 1% but is increased
with certain fracture patterns, particularly surgical neck fractures with significant
translation.
AVASCULAR NECROSIS: Death of osteocytes secondary to compromised blood
supply. Avascular necrosis can occur after proximal humerus fractures if the blood
supply to the humeral head has been sufficiently damaged. The head is predominantly
supplied by the anterolateral ascending branch of the anterior humeral circumflex
artery, but also receives some blood supply from the posterior humeral circumflex.
This occurs most commonly after 4-part fractures. Avascular necrosis ultimately results in articular surface collapse and shoulder arthritis, which may require surgical
interventions, including shoulder arthroplasty.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
Proximal humerus fractures account for 4% to 5% of all fractures. They typically
appear in a bimodal distribution; younger patients are typically male, and their

104

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

fractures are a result of high-energy trauma (including motor vehicle accidents, falls
from significant height, or gunshot injuries). Older patients who sustain this injury
are much more likely to be postmenopausal women who have experienced a lowenergy mechanism, such as a trip and fall from standing height, like the patient in
this case.
Not surprisingly, there is a significant association with osteoporosis and proximal
humerus fractures. The loss of trabecular microarchitecture and bone mass causes
a significant increase in bone fragility of the humeral head, placing it at risk of
fracture even with low-energy trauma. The association of osteoporosis and proximal humerus fractures is supported by the fact that the vast majority of proximal
humerus fractures occur in females and individuals older than 50 years. In fact, some
studies have shown that proximal humerus fractures more reliably correlate with
bone fragility than do spine, hip, or wrist fractures, which are all widely regarded as
classical sites of fragility fracture.
An uncommon etiology leading to proximal humerus fracture that must be
excluded is malignancy. This may include benign and malignant primary bone
tumors, as well as metastatic disease. Compared with nonpathologic fractures, these
are extremely rare, but must be recognized if present, as this can drastically change
patient management.

Clinical Presentation
Patients with a proximal humerus fracture will present with pain, swelling, and
ecchymosis of the involved shoulder. They may or may not be able to move their
shoulder depending on the amount of pain they have, which may be a function of
how displaced their fracture is (eg, a nondisplaced fracture may be less painful than
a 4-part fracture). Typically, patients will cradle the affected arm at their side.
As stated earlier, most patients presenting with a proximal humerus fracture will
be older (>50 years old) and are more likely to be female. The most common mechanism is a mechanical fall. Younger patients will likely require a more violent mechanism of injury to sustain a fracture, unless an underlying metabolic bone disease is
present. The history should focus on discerning the mechanism of injury and also
identifying any risk factors for fracture (history of prior fracture, osteoporosis, corticosteroid use, immunocompromised status, history of malignancy or prior radiation).

Diagnosis
A thorough physical examination is the first step in diagnosis. Discerning a proximal humerus fracture from other bony and soft tissue injuries to the shoulder based
on exam alone can be difficult, but some signs might point toward an alternative
diagnosis. This includes deformity and crepitus of the clavicle, which would suggest
a clavicle fracture, as well as deformity at the acromioclavicular joint, suggesting an
acromioclavicular dislocation, or external rotation of the arm, suggesting anterior
glenohumeral dislocation. Examining the entire shoulder girdle for wounds indicating an open fracture is mandatory. A good exam also assesses for the presence
of a neurovascular injury. Injury to the axillary artery occurs in fewer than 5% of
all cases, but is more likely with severe injuries (4-part fractures). An appropriate
workup should include assessment of capillary refill and palpation of the radial

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

pulse; Doppler ultrasound and angiography should be used on an as-needed basis
when clinical suspicion is sufficiently high. Nerve injuries are also uncommon but
possible, as the infraclavicular brachial plexus and peripheral nerve branches lie
anteromedial to the humeral head. Nerve injuries are more common with fracture dislocations and fractures involving the surgical neck. An isolated axillary
nerve injury is most commonly seen with a greater tuberosity fracture-dislocation
as a result of its anatomic proximity. Sensory and motor testing of the axillary nerve
(motor = deltoid, sensory = lateral aspect of upper arm), as well as the median
(motor = FDP [flexor digitorum profundus] to index, sensory = palmar aspect thumb
to half of ring finger), ulnar (motor = interossei, sensory = palmar aspect of small
and half of ring finger), and radial (motor = wrist and digit extensors, sensory =
dorsal aspect of first webspace) nerves should be routinely undertaken to rule out
a neurologic injury.
Plain radiographs are essential to the diagnosis of a proximal humerus fracture.
An adequate plain radiographic examination should include an AP, scapular Y,
and an axillary view at a minimum (Figure 10–2). Poor or incomplete radiographs should not be tolerated. Advanced imaging may be necessary in certain
cases. Computed tomography scans can be helpful in certain circumstances; they
may be helpful to better understand the global fracture pattern, determine the
amount of tuberosity displacement or tuberosity comminution, or determine the
presence of an intraarticular “head splitting” component. Although rotator cuff
tears are uncommon in combination with proximal humerus fractures, magnetic
resonance imaging can be performed to evaluate the condition of the rotator cuff
or any other soft tissues.
The most common classification system in use for proximal humerus fractures is the Neer classification. This system divides the proximal humerus into
4 potential parts. This includes the head (created by a fracture through either the
anatomic or surgical neck), the greater tuberosity, the lesser tuberosity, and the
shaft. A fragment is considered a “part” if it is displaced greater than 1 cm (0.5
cm if it is the greater tuberosity) or by 45 degrees by its muscular attachments
(greater tuberosity = supra and infraspinatus; lesser tuberosity = subscapularis;
shaft = pectoralis major and deltoid). Thus a fracture with minimal displacement (regardless of how many fracture lines are present) is considered a 1-part
fracture. A 2-part fracture is most commonly an isolated displaced fracture at
either the surgical neck or greater tuberosity; much less common 2-part fractures
(although possible) include a displaced fracture through the anatomic neck or
lesser tuberosity. The most common 3-part fracture involves displaced fractures
through both the greater tuberosity and surgical neck. A 4-part fracture involves
displacement of both tuberosities, the head and the shaft. Although this classification system is not perfect, it does serve as a means of describing the fracture
and providing rough guidelines for treatment.

TREATMENT
After examining the patient, the very first step in treatment is immobilization. This
consists of a simple sling or shoulder immobilizer. This enhances patient comfort
and may serve as definitive treatment in some cases. If a concomitant glenohumeral

107

dislocation is also present, then prompt closed reduction should be performed as
soon as feasible with the assistance of local anesthesia and/or sedation.
Determining the definitive treatment for a proximal humerus fracture requires
careful consideration on a case-by-case basis. Not only must the fracture characteristics be considered, but also the global assessment of the patient. A demented
90-year-old nursing home patient will perhaps require a different treatment plan
compared with a healthy 30-year-old, even if their fracture patterns are similar.
However, in general, the following treatment algorithm can be used to guide treatment for closed fractures.
One-part fractures ã sling for 2 weeks followed by progressive range of
motion with close follow-up. This is an appropriate treatment for approximately
80% of all proximal humerus fractures.
Two, 3, and valgus impacted 4-part fractures ã open reduction internal fixation (particularly in younger patients). This allows for restoration of the native
anatomy and early range of motion. Isolated avulsion fractures of the greater tuberosity with greater than 5-mm displacement should be treated surgically as well
because of the risk of malunion leading to subacromial impingement of the displaced
greater tuberosity. Of note, percutaneous pinning and intramedullary nailing are
other operative interventions less commonly employed.
Fractures with significant risk of AVN (4-part fractures, head-split fractures,
displaced anatomic neck fractures in the elderly) ã prosthetic replacement with
humeral head hemiarthroplasty. This avoids the risk of avascular necrosis and
allows for early range of motion.
Open fractures and fractures with associated vascular injury should always be
treated operatively with irrigation and debridement, repair of any vascular injury,
and then fracture treatment as appropriate given the fracture pattern.
In general, clinical outcomes with open-reduction internal fixation are superior
to hemiarthroplasty. Every effort should be made to treat displaced fractures with
open reduction internal fixation unless there are a prohibitive amount of risk factors for a poor outcome with this modality (poor bone stock, high risk of AVN, poor
nutritional status/healing potential, very low demand patient).

Complications
Stiffness: Loss of motion of the glenohumeral joint is a common occurrence after a
proximal humerus fracture. This can occur subsequent to both operative and nonoperative treatment. Shoulder stiffness can be limited by instituting range-of-motion
exercises as soon as the fracture pattern permits.
Nonunion: Most common with displaced surgical neck fractures treated nonoperatively. This can be treated with open-reduction internal fixation if no arthritis is
present, with or without bone graft.
Malunion: Usually the result of inadequate closed or open treatment of displaced
surgical neck or greater tuberosity fragments. When healed in a position of malalignment, bony impingement, poor motion, and weakness can result. This can be treated
with an osteotomy, and internal fixation if no arthritis is present.

Avascular Necrosis: The humeral head receives its blood supply from the anterior
and posterior humeral circumflex arteries. Direct injury to these vessels or fracture
displacement that disrupts the intraosseous blood supply can result in avascular
necrosis. This is most commonly seen after 4-part fractures. Clinical manifestations
include insidious onset of shoulder pain months to years after the initial trauma.
Radiographic examination typically reveals subarticular collapse of the head. This
can be treated with prosthetic joint replacement (hemiarthroplasty or total shoulder
replacement).

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
10.1 A proximal humerus fracture has the following morphology. There is 1.5-cm
displacement at the surgical neck and fracture lines involving both the greater
and lesser tuberosities, but without displacement. According to the Neer classification, what would this fracture be classified as?
A. One part
B. Two part
C. Three part
D. Four part
E. None of the above

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?
A.
B.
C.
D.
E.

Hemiarthroplasty

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

ANSWERS
10.1 B. Two-part fracture. Only the humeral head fragment is displaced (>1 cm),
at the surgical neck. The tuberosity fragments are nondisplaced and thus not
considered “parts.” This means that the fracture has a shaft part and a head
part, making it a 2-part fracture.
10.2 C. AP, scapular Y, and axillary view. Anything less than these views is insufficient, and the patient should be sent back for appropriate radiographs.
10.3 A. Sling immobilization followed by early range of motion. This is a 1-part
fracture in an elderly patient. This does not require operative intervention.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Most proximal humerus fractures occur in older individuals as a result of
low-energy trauma.



Radiographic evaluation of the shoulder must include an AP, scapular Y,
and axillary view, at a minimum.



The most commonly used classification for proximal humerus fractures
is the Neer classification. This is based on the number parts that are displaced (>1 cm or 45 degrees angulated).



The majority of proximal humerus fractures are minimally displaced and
can be treated nonoperatively with sling immobilization followed by early
range-of-motion exercises.



Displaced 2- and 3-part as well as valgus impacted 4-part proximal
humerus fractures are best treated operatively with internal fixation
(particularly in younger patients).



Unreconstructable fractures or fractures at risk of developing avascular
necrosis (four part fractures, head splitting fractures) should be treated
with hemiarthroplasty.

CASE 11
A 31-year-old competitive cyclist reports right shoulder pain after falling during
a race. He presents to your office with his right arm guarded and held close to
his body. He did not lose consciousness and denies other injuries. Findings on
physical examination include a visible “bump” over his right clavicle without skin
breakdown. He has intact sensation to light touch in his axillary, radial, ulna, and
median nerve distributions. His motor examination of the extremity is normal
below the shoulder, but passive and active motion at the shoulder itself is limited,
secondary to pain. He has a palpable radial pulse. An anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the injury site is obtained (Figure 11–1).

ANSWERS TO CASE 11:
Clavicle Fracture
Summary: A 31-year-old cyclist fell from his bicycle directly onto his right shoulder. An
AP shoulder radiograph reveals a midshaft clavicle fracture that is angulated superiorly.
• Most likely diagnosis: This is a right midshaft clavicle fracture, specifically, an
Allman group I injury.
• Concerns for additional injuries: Given the proximity of the brachial plexus
and subclavian vessels to the clavicle, a careful neurovascular exam must be
performed to rule out injury to these vulnerable structures.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the anatomy of the clavicle with regard to its ligamentous, muscular,
and neurovascular relationships with the thorax and upper extremity.
2. Understand the indications and options for the treatment of clavicle fractures.
3. Understand the differences in outcomes for operative versus nonoperative management of clavicle fractures.

Considerations
Clavicle fractures are common, comprising approximately 5% to 10% of all fractures. They may be in isolation, as experienced by the cyclist in this case, but are
also found in high-energy, poly-traumatic events such as motor vehicle accidents.
Such patients are more likely to have thoracic cage injuries, scapula fractures, and
pneumo- or hemothoraces. Low-energy mechanism injuries such as simple falls are
unlikely to be associated with other fractures or intrathoracic injury.
Although the patient in the vignette sustained an isolated injury, careful
attention must be focused to the neurovascular status of the extremity. The
subclavian vein runs directly between the subclavius muscle and the first rib.
Posterior to the subclavian vein lie the subclavian artery and brachial plexus.
The plexus is closest to the clavicle in its midportion and is at greatest risk for
injury at this location.

APPROACH TO:
Clavicle Fracture
DEFINITIONS
SERENDIPITY VIEW: A radiographic image of the sternoclavicular joint
obtained like an AP chest film with 40 degrees of cephalic tilt. Typically used to
assess the sternoclavicular joint.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

113

ZANCA VIEW: An AP radiographic image of the shoulder performed by centering the x-ray beam over the acromioclavicular joint with 15 degrees of cephalic tilt.
Good for assessing the distal clavicle and the acromioclavicular joint.
SUPERIOR SHOULDER SUSPENSORY COMPLEX: A conceptual bone
and soft-tissue complex comprising the glenoid, coracoid process, coracoclavicular
ligaments, distal portion of the clavicle, acromioclavicular joint, and acromion
process. Together, these structures form a supportive, stable ring from which the
arm is suspended.
FLOATING SHOULDER: This may occur when two or more components of the
shoulder suspensory complex (most commonly a concomitant clavicle and ipsilateral scapula neck fractures) are injured. Represents a theoretical increase in instability and displacement of the glenoid that, at least historically, was considered an
indication for operative fixation.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Anatomy and Mechanism of Injury
The clavicle is an “S”-shaped bone with its medial portion apex anterior and its
lateral portion apex posterior. It is wider in the axial dimension laterally where it
forms the acromioclavicular joint. The clavicle acts as a strut connecting the upper
extremity to the axial skeleton. It functions as part of the suspensory complex of
the upper extremity and has multiple muscular and ligamentous attachments. The
major muscular attachments include the sternocleidomastoid, which originates at
the superomedial aspect of the clavicle; the pectoralis major, which originates anteriorly and inferomedially; the trapezius, inserting posteriorly and superolaterally; and
the deltoid, originating anteriorly and inferolaterally. The medial articulation of the
clavicle, the sternoclavicular joint, is supported by sternoclavicular (SC) ligaments.
Its lateral articulation, the acromioclavicular joint, is supported by acromioclavicular
(AC) ligaments. Additional attachments include the coracoclavicular ligaments,
composed of both the conoid and trapezoid ligaments and considered the suspensory ligaments of the upper extremity, providing vertical support to the AC joint.
Clavicle fractures are deformed by the following forces:
• The sternocleidomastoid displaces the proximal fragment superiorly and
posteriorly.
• The pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi displace medially, pulling the shoulder
toward the midline and resulting in clavicle shortening.
• The weight of the arm displaces the distal fragment inferiorly.
• Such forces result in the typical presentation: the distal fragment being inferiorly displaced and medially shortened. A superficial bony “bump” may be appreciated on physical exam as a direct result of this mechanism.

Radiographic Evaluation
Standard AP radiographs are generally sufficient to evaluate and treat clavicle fractures. Additional Serendipity and Zanca views may help further evaluate proximal

114

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

and lateral clavicle fractures, respectively. A computed tomography (CT) scan may
be beneficial in assessing clavicle fractures when the fracture pattern is unclear or if
the fracture is intraarticular. CT may also be performed later in follow-up to assess
bony healing.

Classification
Clavicle fractures are commonly classified using the Allman classification as later
modified by Neer. Allman originally divided the clavicle into 3 anatomical groups,
based primarily on frequency of injury: middle, distal, and proximal. Neer subsequently sub-characterized group II fractures based on integrity of the coracoclavicular ligaments.
• Group I: Middle third of clavicle (approximately 80% of fractures)
° May be nondisplaced or displaced (>100% displacement; ie, no cortical
contact between ends)
• Group II: Distal third of clavicle (approximately 15% of fractures)
° Type I: Distal clavicle fracture with the coracoclavicular ligaments intact
° Type II: Coracoclavicular ligaments detached from the medial fragment with
the trapezoid ligament attached to the distal fragment
° Type IIA: Both conoid and trapezoid attached to the distal fragment
° Type IIB: Conoid detached from the medial fragment
• Group III: Proximal third of clavicle (approximately 5% of fractures)

TREATMENT
Most clavicle fractures are successfully treated with simple immobilization in a
sling or a figure-of-eight bandage for 4 to 6 weeks. During immobilization, active
range of motion of the elbow, hand, and wrist is allowed to preserve joint motion.
Passive range of motion and active assisted range of motion of the shoulder are typically initiated at approximately 2 to 3 weeks. There are no significant differences
in outcomes after sling immobilization versus figure-of-eight bandages.
Surgical management of clavicle fractures is controversial. Absolute indications
for operative intervention include open fractures, skin tenting with the potential
to progress to open fracture, and associated neurovascular injuries. Relative indications for surgical fixation include displacement or shortening greater than 2 cm,
significant fracture comminution, the presence of a floating shoulder, or bilateral
clavicle fractures. Common fixation methods include plate and screw fixation and
intramedullary pinning.
Postoperatively, the patients are allowed to perform pendulum exercises or gentle active ranging of the suspended arm with a limited motion arc for 2 weeks. At
6 to 8 weeks, muscular strengthening exercises may begin if follow-up radiographs
show signs of healing. A full return to sports is generally not recommended until
12 weeks postoperatively.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

115

When deciding between operative versus nonoperative management, there is
an increasing amount of evidence supporting operative intervention for displaced
midshaft clavicle fractures, especially in young, active patients. Potential benefits
to operative management include decreased time to bone union, decreased rates of
non- or malunion, and a faster return to work. To some patients, cosmetic factors
may influence decision making. Patients, for instance, may prefer a permanent visible “bump” between partially displaced but united fractures versus prominent scars
and palpable hardware from surgical intervention.

Complications
Adverse outcomes associated with management of clavicle fractures include nonunion, malunion, posttraumatic arthritis at the AC joint, infection with surgical
intervention, and refracture. A common complication of surgical management is
chronic irritation from prominent hardware: Plate and screw constructs placed
on the superior aspect of the clavicle are notorious for needing removal in up to
30% of patients.

A.
B.
C.
D.

Allman group I, type IIA
Allman group II, type I

Allman group I, type II B

ANSWERS
11.1 D. The best initial imaging choice to evaluate clavicle fractures is an AP view
of the clavicle with Zanca views to further evaluate distal clavicle fracture
pattern.
11.2 C. Displacement and comminution have been shown to increase risk of nonunion in nonoperative management. There are no significant differences
between outcomes when using sling immobilization versus a figure-of-eight
bandage.
11.3 B. This is a right distal clavicle fracture (group II) with coracoclavicular ligaments intact (type I): an Allman group II, (Neer) type I. Allman group I and
III fractures describe the middle and proximal clavicle, respectively, and do
not apply to this distal clavicle injury. Because the injury is medial to both
coracoclavicular ligaments, they are intact, and thus it is a type I and not type
II group II injury.

The clavicle is distinct in being the first bone in the body to ossify (fifth
week in utero) and the last to fuse its ossification center (22-25 years).

CASE 12
A 26-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of right
ankle pain, swelling, and an inability to walk after twisting his ankle in a soccer
tournament. He remembers making a quick cut before experiencing sharp pain
and hearing a “crack” while falling to the ground. Physical exam reveals a swollen
and ecchymotic right ankle with tenderness directly over the medial and lateral
malleoli and over distal fibular at the level of the ankle joint. His skin is swollen,
but intact. He is neurovascularly intact and has a strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
Examination of the proximal leg is unremarkable. He has no past medical history.

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

ANSWERS TO CASE 12:
Ankle Fracture
Summary: A 26-year-old man suffered an acute twisting injury to his right ankle,
resulting in pain, swelling, and an inability to bear weight.
• Most likely diagnosis: Fractures of both the lateral and medial malleoli,
together known as a bimalleolar ankle fracture.
• Next step in management of injury: Administration of analgesia, systemic
and/or intraarticular, and attempted closed reduction. Depending on the degree
of swelling, the patient may be cast or splinted.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and appropriate
initial management of ankle fractures.
2. Know which radiographic studies to order and how to evaluate them.
3. Be familiar with the classification systems used to describe ankle fractures and
recognize how different mechanisms of injury produce predictable fracture
patterns.
4. Have a basic understanding of stable versus unstable ankle fractures.

Considerations
This patient presented with a twisting injury that resulted in ankle pain, swelling,
and an inability to bear weight. Ankle fractures tend to occur in predictable patterns, depending on the magnitude and direction of force and the position of the
foot during injury. Common ankle fracture classification schemes are derived from
mechanisms of injury, and thus obtaining a careful history is helpful to understanding and treating the injury. Physical examination should include a visual inspection
of the skin to rule out an open injury, to evaluate swelling or blistering, and to evaluate for signs of displacement or dislocation. A full neurovascular evaluation of the
foot and ankle is mandatory.
In addition to ankle pain and swelling, this patient has tenderness over both
medial and lateral malleoli and cannot bear weight—3 signs that are suggestive of
fracture rather than ligamentous sprain. X-rays should therefore be ordered. The
most common initial radiographic study is a 3-view ankle series. Given this patient’s
closed, minimally displaced bimalleolar fracture, casting or splinting (splinting
is used in the setting of significant swelling or blistering) is the most appropriate
next step.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

121

APPROACH TO:
Ankle Fracture
DEFINITIONS
LATERAL MALLEOLUS: The distal portion of the fibula that articulates with
the talus and provides lateral stability to the ankle joint.
MEDIAL MALLEOLUS: The distal medial projection of the tibia that articulates
with the talus and provides medial stability to the ankle joint.
TIBIAL PLAFOND: The distal weightbearing articulating surface of the tibia
that, together with both malleoli, comprise the mortise.
MORTISE: The bony arch formed by the articulation between malleoli and the
plafond, which serves to constrain the wedge-shaped talus and allows the hinge-like
motion of the ankle.
SYNDESMOSIS: This describes the ligamentous complex connecting the distal
fibula and tibia. It helps stabilize the ankle mortise.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Anatomy
The ankle is a complex hinge joint consisting of articulations between the distal
tibia, the distal fibula, and the talus that are held in place by a complex ligamentous
system. The lateral malleolus forms the lateral portion of the ankle joint and is surrounded by the strong tibiofibular ligament complex and the syndesmotic ligament
complex. These ligament structures prevent the distal tibia from separating from the
fibula and provide the majority of ankle stability in external rotation. Distally on
the lateral side of the ankle, the talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments provide
resistance to inversion and anterior translation of the talus. The anterior talofibular
ligament is the most commonly injured ligament in ankle sprains. On the medial
side, the medial malleolus is the origin of the deltoid ligament, which provides
medial ligamentous support to the ankle and is the primary medial stabilizer against
lateral displacement of the talus.

Examination
Clinical evaluation of a suspected ankle fracture is necessary to ensure accurate
diagnosis. First, this should include a description of the mechanism of injury. This
provides insight into the position of the ankle and the forces acting on it at the time
of injury. Obtaining a thorough medical history is essential, as comorbidities such
as additional injuries, obesity, hypercoagulable states, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease may affect treatment options. Evaluate the extremity closely for skin
punctures or lacerations that may communicate with the ankle joint or with fracture
fragments. Both open joints and open fractures are considered surgical emergencies
and should be treated accordingly. An obvious deformity may represent a dislocation; reduction should be performed as soon as safely possible. As always, a complete
circulatory and neurologic evaluation should be performed and clearly documented.

122

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

Radiographic Evaluation
After examining a patient, one must decide whether radiographs are needed for further evaluation. The Ottawa Ankle Criteria can aide in this process. The criteria
state that x-rays should be ordered if there is malleolar tenderness and:
• Bone tenderness along the distal 6 cm of the posterior edge of the tibia or tip of
the medial malleolus, or
• Bone tenderness along the distal 6 cm of the posterior edge of the fibula or tip
of the lateral malleolus, or
• An inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department
for more than 4 steps
This algorithm demonstrates a sensitivity of nearly 100% for detecting ankle
fractures and may reduce unnecessary x-ray exposure by up to 40%.
When appropriate, radiographic evaluation of the ankle should consist of a
3-view ankle series. This includes an AP view, a mortise view (oblique), and a
lateral view. The mortise view is important for evaluation of the joint space. It
is obtained by internally rotating the affected extremity 15 degrees on an AP
view so that the x-ray beam becomes perpendicular to the transmalleolar axis. In
a normal ankle, the mortise should show a smooth, evenly spaced gap between the
plafond and malleoli and the talus (Figure 12–2A). This view is useful to determine
the stability of the ankle based on several measurements. The first is the medial clear
space (Figure 12–2C). This represents the joint space between the medial malleolus
and the talus. In normal individuals, this distance should be 4 mm or less and should
be equal to the space between the tibial plafond and the talus. Greater than 4 mm
implies a lateral shift of the talus and possible ankle instability. Next is the talocrural
angle, which is determined by drawing a line through the distal articular surface of
the tibia and a line through the distal-most aspect of the medial and lateral malleoli
(Figure 12–2B). This angle should be 83 degrees ± 4 degrees and is used to judge fibular length. The tibiofibular clear space may also be measured and should be less than
6 mm (Figure 12–2D). It represents the distance between the medial wall of the fibula
and the incisural (posterolateral) surface of the tibia; a space greater than 6 mm suggests syndesmotic injury. If syndesmotic injury or malleolar injury is suspected, but not
radiographically obvious, the examiner may obtain stress radiographs of the ankle
after appropriate analgesia is administered. Most commonly, in the setting of a lateral
malleolar fracture with concern for medial injury, the examiner stresses the ankle by
dorsiflexing and externally rotating the foot, and a mortise image is obtained.

Classification
Various classification systems exist for ankle fractures. The two most commonly
employed are the Weber and the Lauge-Hansen classification systems.
The Weber classification separates ankle fractures based on the location of the
fibular fracture. The degree of instability is determined based on the location of
the fracture. Weber A fractures describe a fracture that is distal to the syndesmosis.
These are typically avulsion injuries and are usually stable. Weber B fractures occur
at the level of the syndesmosis and often extend proximally, laterally, and posteriorly.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

Figure 12–2. Mortise view of normal ankle showing the (A) mortise, (B) talocrural angle, (C) medial
clear space, and (D) tibiofibular clear space. (Courtesy of Timothy T. Roberts, MD)

These typically result from external rotation. Fifty percent of Weber B fractures are
associated with tearing of the anterior tibiofibular ligament and are unstable in such
instances. Weber C fractures occur above the level of the syndesmosis and often
occur with the foot in pronation at the time of injury; they are almost always associated with a medial ankle injury, whether ligamentous or bony.
The Lauge-Hansen classification describes the mechanism of injury and can be
roughly correlated with the Weber system. As mentioned, this system uses 2 variables
to classify the fracture pattern: the position of the foot at the time of injury
(pronation versus supination) and the direction of the deforming force (external
rotation versus abduction or adduction). Four patterns are described: supinationadduction (SAd), supination-external rotation (SER), pronation-external rotation
(PER), and pronation-abduction (PAb). Each pattern has a relatively consistent
sequence of injury, as depicted in Figure 12–3. Although seemingly complex, the
fracture patterns follow simple rules: In supination injuries, the supinated foot has a
relaxed deltoid ligament but taut lateral ligaments, thus regardless of external rotation or adduction forces, the initial injury begins laterally and progresses medially,
depending on the degree of force, quality of the bone, and so forth. Conversely,
the pronated foot has a tense deltoid ligament, and initial injury begins medially
with either a medial malleolus fracture or a rupture of the deltoid ligament. Injuries

then progress proximally and laterally to the fibula, where they become analogous
to Weber C injuries. Remember that the most common pattern of injury is the SER
type, which correlates typically with a Weber B pattern.

TREATMENT
As with any periarticular fracture, the treatment goals for ankle fractures are to
restore anatomic alignment of the joint. Additional goals include restoring or maintaining fibular length and the correct rotation of the joint. After reduction of a
closed fracture, cast application or splint stabilization followed by delayed casting
may be definitive treatment. The success of these nonoperative treatments depends
primarily on the stability of the fracture. Physical exam findings, together with
radiographic analysis, determine stability. Stable ankle fractures include those presenting without widening of the mortise joint space. After reduction, minimally
displaced fractures with an intact syndesmosis and mortise may be treated with immobilization and nonweightbearing in a short leg cast or splint for 4 to 6 weeks.
Open fractures or dislocations that cannot be reduced require urgent surgical
treatment.
In general, patterns of injury that have widening of the syndesmosis, an
increased medial clear space, or frank subluxation or dislocation of the talus
should be treated initially with reduction and splinting followed, when possible,
by surgical fixation. Ideally, fractures should be fixed in the acute setting before
significant swelling occurs; however, if the soft tissues surrounding the ankle become
too swollen, closure of the skin after internal fixation may not be possible. When
significant swelling or blistering is present, fixation should be delayed until swelling
subsides. This may take several days to weeks.

Complications
As with most articular injuries, a loss of range of motion is expected to some degree.
Posttraumatic arthritis may result if the ankle heals with articular incongruity.
Arthritis is fortunately rare, however, when the ankle heals in an anatomic position.
Finally, the rate of loss of reduction in closed-treated fractures is reportedly as high
as 25%. For this reason, close follow-up with serial radiographs to assess reduction
and healing is essential in the subacute care of ankle fractures.

12.2 A 50-year-old male presents to the emergency department with right ankle
pain, an inability to bear weight, and swelling over the lateral malleolus. The
patient states that he twisted his ankle tripping down a flight of stairs and
is complaining of “throbbing” lateral ankle pain. X-rays show a minimally
displaced lateral malleolus fracture (Weber B) with a medial clear space of
3.5 mm. During your initial physical exam, palpitation of the medial malleolus also elicits tenderness. About which additional injury should you be
concerned?
A. Fracture of the talar neck
B. Tear of the deltoid ligament
C. Fracture of the calcaneus
D. Tear of the anterior talofibular ligament
12.3 A 26-year-old athlete twists her right ankle while diving for a soccer ball during her tenure as goalie for a local travel league. She suffers a bimalleolar,
minimally displaced closed ankle fracture. Her skin is soft and minimally swollen, and she is neurovascularly intact. Which of the following fracture characteristics is most predictive of a need for surgical fixation?
A. Degree of initial fibular fracture displacement
B. Presence of an avulsion fracture of the medial malleolus
C. Level of the fibula fracture
D. Position of the talus in the ankle mortise
12.4 A 20-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department (ED) after
falling off of his mountain bike. He last ate 2 hours ago, about 15 minutes
before he fell. He complains of left ankle pain and has a markedly deformed
ankle with exposed bone protruding through the skin. What is the single most
important and immediate step in the treatment of this injury?
A. Thorough irrigation and debridement of gross contamination from the
wound
B. Reduce and splint the fracture in ED
C. Administer intravenous antibiotics and a tetanus shot/booster when
applicable
D. Place nasogastric tube and proceed to the operating room for surgical
stabilization

ANSWERS
12.1 C. Maisonneuve fractures, a type of pronation external rotation fracture, have
a characteristic high fibular spiral fracture with a disrupted syndesmosis and
tibia–fibula interosseous membrane. The medial malleolus (or deltoid ligament) is also disrupted. High fibular fractures (above the level of the syndesmosis) define Weber C fractures. Weber B fractures occur at the level of the
syndesmosis, and Weber A fractures occur below it.

128

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

12.2 B. A tear or rupture of the deltoid ligament would be of concern in this
patient. The question tells you that the mortise is intact (clear space of 3.5
mm) on x-ray; however, because the patient has tenderness over the medial
malleolus, there must be concern for injury to the deltoid, which could result
in an unstable ankle.
12.3 D. Although all of the factors here may influence the decision to surgically
reduce and fix an ankle fracture, the position of the talus in the mortise is the
single most important factor. Remember that widening of the ankle mortise
indicates instability and is itself a surgical indication. Initial displacement is
not as important as postreduction positioning.
12.4 C. Although urgent irrigation and debridement and provisional stabilization
are important, administration of intravenous antibiotics within 6 hours of
injury has been demonstrated to be most beneficial in reducing complications
associated with open fractures.

CLINICAL PEARLS


When examining a patient with an ankle injury, always perform a complete
physical exam, including palpation of the lateral and medial malleolus,
and a complete neurologic and vascular exam.



When ordering ankle radiographs, obtain AP, mortise, and lateral views
at minimum.



On the mortise view, look for signs of instability. Remember that the
medial clear space should be no wider than 4 mm and should be equal to
the rest of the mortise clear space.



Surgery is indicated in unstable ankle fractures and any open injuries.

A 55-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation develops a sudden sharp pain
in his right leg. He presents to the emergency department, where he is found
to have a cold right foot and calf, as well as nonpalpable pulses below the knee.
The patient is taken to the operating room approximately 8 hours after the onset
of the pain. He undergoes an embolectomy of a popliteal artery clot without
complication. In the recovery room, however, he begins complaining of intense
right foot and calf pain that continues to escalate, despite copious analgesia.
When you evaluate the patient, he complains of 10/10 pain in his foot and calf
that is constant, sharp, and without relief. On physical exam, his right lower leg
is pale in comparison with the left and firm to touch. Palpable posterior tibial and
dorsalis pedis pulses are present bilaterally. He experiences excruciating pain with

ANSWERS TO CASE 13:
Acute Compartment Syndrome
Summary: A 55-year-old man who initially presents with 8 hours of acute lower
extremity ischemia develops sharp, constant pain after undergoing successful
embolectomy. The patient has a pale, firm, painful leg and foot with palpable pulses.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute compartment syndrome.
• How to confirm the diagnosis: Measure compartment pressures in the leg.
• Appropriate treatment: Emergency surgical fasciotomies to relieve elevated leg
compartment pressures.
• Major complications: Rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinemia can cause renal
failure. Additionally, if ischemia is prolonged, it can lead to significant tissue
damage causing diminished limb function, muscle contractures, and possible
limb loss.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathophysiology underlying compartment syndrome as well as
the clinical signs and symptoms of the condition.
2. Describe the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to compartment syndrome.
3. Understand the complications caused by the direct effects of elevated compartment pressures, as well as complications from myoglobinemia.

Considerations
The patient’s history of prolonged lower extremity ischemia should raise the concern for the development of a compartment syndrome. Although most frequently
associated with trauma, a number of nontraumatic injuries can also lead to the
development of a compartment syndrome, such as reperfusion or rhabdomyolysis.
This patient had an acute thrombosis of his popliteal artery with subsequent ischemia
to his lower leg and foot for 8 hours. Many advocate performing prophylactic fasciotomies in any patient whose ischemia time, from an injury such as this one, exceeds
4 to 6 hours. Although the patient does not present with all of the classic “5 Ps”
(see “Definitions” in the next section) it is rare to see a patient who in fact has all
5 signs and symptoms. The presence of all “5 Ps” typically represents a severe and
advanced stage of compartment syndrome. The presence of palpable pulses should
not impede your diagnosis of a compartment syndrome if other clinical findings suggest the diagnosis. Loss of pulses is typically the last sign and requires a significant
intra-compartment pressure. Waiting for the patient to lose pulses will result in a
more extensive injury to the compartmental muscle and nerves as well as increasing
the risk for and severity of renal damage.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

131

APPROACH TO:
Compartment Syndrome
DEFINITIONS
COMPARTMENT SYNDROME: A clinically diagnosed condition of increased
intra-compartmental pressure within a closed space, causing reduced tissue perfusion
and subsequent tissue necrosis.
5 Ps: Five signs and symptoms classically found in patients with compartment syndrome, including: pain out of proportion to exam, paralysis, paresthesias, pallor,
pulselessness. Sometimes poikilocytosis (coolness) is considered a sixth “P”.
RHABDOMYOLYSIS: Breakdown of muscle that leads to intravascular leakage of
electrolytes and proteins, including myoglobin.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Compartment syndrome results from an increase in tissue pressure within a
confined fascial space that limits any expansion of the compartment’s volume to
compensate for the increase in pressure. As the pressure rises, the compartment’s
pressure eventually exceeds the capillary perfusion pressure, causing impaired
oxygen delivery to tissue and subsequent tissue damage. Irreversible cellular
damage, which results in breakdown of the intracellular organelles and cellular
membranes, leads to leakage of intracellular electrolytes, including phosphorous,
potassium, and myoglobin, as well as the activation of inflammatory cascades.
This results in further swelling and tissue edema that, in turn, results in even further
compartment pressure elevation. Rhabdomyolysis, the rapid breakdown of damaged
muscle, may lead renal failure and dangerous electrolyte imbalances such as hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. Hyperkalemia relates directly to intracellular potassium
leakage; hypocalcemia indirectly results from the release of phosphate ions that bind
and sequester available calcium.
Although compartment syndrome exists in both acute and chronic forms, it is
typically thought of as an acute process. For the purpose of this discussion, acute and
chronic forms of this syndrome are discussed separately.

Acute Compartment Syndrome
Although compartment syndrome is frequently associated with closed fractures, particularly comminuted fractures of the upper or lower extremities, it can be caused
by any process that leads to impaired tissue perfusion. Additional causes of compartment syndrome include external compression such as constrictive casting, hematomas, arterial or venous thrombosis, intravenous (IV) infiltration, and leakage
of fluid into the interstitial space (Table 13–1). Although not common, improper
positioning for surgical procedures (especially prolonged positioning in lithotomy or
Trendelenburg positions) can lead to impaired venous return and subsequent compartment syndrome.
The most common fractures associated with the development of compartment
syndrome are closed tibial fractures, followed by forearm fractures. Some series

report the incidence of compartment syndrome after closed tibia fractures to be
approximately 20%. Physicians must be highly suspicious of compartment syndrome
in the patient who develops increasing pain following closed reduction and immobilization. Significant pain with passive stretching of the toes (or fingers, in a forearm injury) should warrant removal of the cast or splint and careful reassessment for
compartment syndrome.
Compartment syndrome is a clinical diagnosis based on signs and symptoms
in the appropriate clinical setting. Although the syndrome is classically described
by the “5 Ps”, it is rare to find a patient who has all 5 (or 6 if you include coolness)
of these signs and symptoms. None of the “5 Ps” are pathognomonic for this condition, and therefore diagnosis of compartment syndrome is primarily a clinical
diagnosis. For example, pain, which typically represents the first clinical complaint,
is extremely nonspecific. Pulselessness, which is a late finding and does not occur
until the compartment pressures are significantly elevated, may be a baseline finding
in patients with peripheral vascular disease. An additional physical exam finding
that is frequently seen with compartment syndrome is pain on passive movement of
the muscles within the effected compartment.
Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by directly measuring the compartment pressures using either a side-port needle or a slit catheter (Figure 13–1). Compartment
pressures within 30 mmHg of the patient’s diastolic blood pressure warrant emergency operative intervention. Although compartment pressure measurements are
extremely useful in confirming the diagnosis of compartment syndrome, it is primarily a clinical diagnosis, and therefore measurement of compartment pressures should
not delay surgical intervention if the clinical picture is clear. Additionally, many
advocate for prophylactic intervention with fasciotomies to prevent the development of a compartment syndrome if there has been greater than 4 to 6 hours of limb
ischemia.
Surgical intervention is performed via an operative fasciotomies. Depending on
the extent of injury and tissue edema, the overlying skin can either be closed at the

time of surgery or can be closed once the edema has decreased. This will sometimes
require the use of skin grafts at a later date. In most cases, the fasciotomies are performed through 2 skin incisions that are positioned so that all fascial compartments
can be decompressed. In the leg, fasciotomies involve releasing the anterior, lateral,
superficial, posterior, and deep posterior compartments (Figure 13–2). Fasciotomies
of the thigh involve release of the medial, anterior, and posterior compartments. In
the arm, proximal fasciotomies involve releasing the anterior and posterior compartments, whereas forearm fasciotomies require opening the dorsal and volar compartments with extension into the carpal tunnel and mobile wad compartment located
on the radial aspect of the forearm (Figure 13–3). Fasciotomies are generally not
performed after 48 hours unless there is remaining function documented within the
muscles of that compartment. Amputation may be necessary in these settings.
When performing fasciotomies, it is important to ensure that the fascial openings
are long enough to fully decompress the muscle within. If the underlying injury is severe
and the openings are inadequate, compartment syndrome can recur. Failure to appreciate this fact can easily lead to further tissue damage and subsequent complications.
The cellular damage that occurs from prolonged compartment syndrome leads
to release of potassium, phosphorous, and myoglobin. Evaluation of the degree of
muscle damage and breakdown can be followed with serial measurements of creatine
phosphokinase (CPK), which serves as an indirect gauge of the degree of myoglobinemia. Myoglobin, the oxygen storing molecule of muscles, can crystallize within
the renal tubules and lead to significant renal injury. Management of this severe
myoglobulinemia primarily involves aggressive hydration with IV fluids with a
goal of maintaining urine output of approximately 100 mL/hr or >1 mL/kg/hr.
Some advocate for IV fluid supplementation with sodium bicarbonate with the
goal of increasing the pH of urine and increasing the solubility of myoglobin to
reduce crystallization and subsequent renal damage.

Patients with rhabdomyolysis also require continuous cardiac monitoring, as the
hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia associated with muscle breakdown can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Depending on the degree of hyperkalemia, patients may require
further medical interventions, including calcium chloride or calcium gluconate for
myocardial protection as well as insulin/glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and polystyrene sulfonate, a potassium binder.
Outcomes after the development of acute compartment syndrome are largely
determined by the severity of the inciting injury, the timing of diagnosis, and the
extent and severity of tissue damage. Although the majority of patients who sustain
renal injury from rhabdomyolysis will eventually have a full recovery of renal function, rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney injury is associated with a mortality rate as high as 20%. Furthermore, requirement for intensive care unit admission
in the setting of rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury is associated with a mortality rate reaching nearly 60%.

Chronic Compartment Syndrome
Although compartment syndrome is most commonly seen and discussed as an acute
process, it can also exist in a chronic form. The chronic form of compartment syndrome is an exercise-induced phenomenon that results in recurrent pain with activity and relief with rest. The chronic form of this syndrome is not typically associated with significant muscle necrosis nor renal damage. A diagnosis of chronic
compartment syndrome is confirmed by measuring intra-compartment pressures
before and after exercise. Treatment options include surgical fasciotomies for pain
relief and increased exercise tolerance, prolonged periods of rest in conjunction with
modifying the offending activity or exercise routine, and continuing with current
exercise routines despite the pain and discomfort that they cause. Those who elect
to defer surgical intervention or lifestyle modification should be made aware that
chronic compartment syndrome can on occasion develop into an acute compartment syndrome.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

13.2 A 55-year-old woman is noted to have a traumatic injury to her right thigh.
Which of the following is most sensitive for the diagnosis of compartment
syndrome?
A. Pulselessness
B. Pallor
C. Pain
D. Paresthesias
13.3 A 22-year-old roofer is brought into the ED due to hyperthermia. The urinalysis is positive for blood, and the serum CPK is markedly elevated. The patient
is noted to likely have compartment syndrome and rhabdomyolysis. What is
the appropriate infusion rate for IV hydration for this patient?
A. 4 mL/kg/% body surface area affected
B. 4 mL/kg/hr for the first 10 kg + 2 mL/kg/hr for the next 10 kg + 1 mL/kg/hr
for each subsequent kilogram
C. Titrated to urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/hr
D. Titrated to urine output of 1 mL/kg/hr

ANSWERS
13.1 D. A urinalysis that is positive for blood does not distinguish between
myoglobin and hemoglobin. A microscopic urine exam is necessary for a
definitive diagnosis. In a patient with myoglobinuria, a microscopic evaluation will fail to show the presence of red blood cell (RBC) casts or intact
RBCs. Gross myoglobinuria can lead to an abnormal coloration of the
urine and is typically described as “cola colored.” Hematuria and renal cell
carcinoma would be expected to produce urinalysis and microscopic exam
that are positive for RBCs, whereas nephritic syndrome would be expected
to have RBC casts.
13.2 C. Pain, typically severe and even out of proportion to the injury, represents
the first and most sensitive symptom of compartment syndrome. Pain, however, is extremely nonspecific. Pulselessness represents a very late finding, and
therefore the finding of a palpable pulse should not exclude compartment syndrome in your differential diagnosis.
13.3 D. IV fluids should be titrated to maintain urine output greater than 1 mL/
kg/hr to minimize the risk of myoglobin precipitation within the renal tubules
and minimize the extent of kidney injury. Choice A represents a modification
of the Parkland formula used in burn management (4 mL/kg/body surface area
of second- and third-degree burns). Choice B represents the calculation of
maintenance IV fluid. Choice C represents the typical urine output goal for
most patients.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Compartment syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. Although measurement
of compartment pressures can be used to confirm the diagnosis, treatment should not be delayed for compartment pressure measurements if
the diagnosis is clear.



Pulselessness is typically a late sign, and treatment should not be delayed
until it is present.



Incomplete and/or inadequate fasciotomies can result in a subsequent
redevelopment of a compartment syndrome.



Ischemia lasting greater than 4 to 6 hours typically requires prophylactic
fasciotomies to prevent development of a compartment syndrome.



Compartment pressures within 30 mmHg of the patient’s diastolic pressure are indicative of compartment syndrome and require emergency
operative intervention.

(ED) with severe left forearm pain. Her mother states that the girl had been
playing on their trampoline with some friends when she fell, landing on her outstretched left hand 1 hour ago. On examination, the girl is in obvious discomfort,
and although her forearm is moderately swollen, the skin is grossly intact. The
forearm is deformed, and she is exquisitely tender to palpation toward the distal
aspect. When asked, she will gingerly flex and extend her wrist. However, she will
not supinate or pronate. The radial pulse is palpable, and brisk capillary refill is

ANSWERS TO CASE 14:
Pediatric Both Bone Forearm Fracture
Summary: A right-hand-dominant 8-year-old girl presents with left forearm pain
and deformity after landing on her outstretched left hand following a fall from a
trampoline. Motor, sensory, and vascular exams are all normal. Radiographs reveal
distal one-third diaphyseal fractures of her radius and ulna.
• Most likely diagnosis: Both bone forearm fracture (BBFF).
• Preferred treatment: Closed reduction and application of a long-arm cast.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the mechanism of injury associated with fractures of both the radius
and ulna in children.
2. Know the proper radiographic imaging to obtain in the setting of a BBFF.
3. Know the indications for both nonoperative and operative treatment of pediatric
BBFF.

Considerations
This 8-year-old girl presents with pain and deformity of her left forearm after falling onto her outstretched hand while playing on a trampoline. Her severe pain and
obvious deformity must make the clinician very suspicious for a fracture, specifically
a BBFF. An additional physical examination finding that also supports this diagnosis
is her refusal to supinate and pronate her forearm. Fortunately, this is not an open
injury and she is neurovascularly intact. Plain radiographs of the forearm confirm
a BBFF. The images obtained include views of both the wrist and elbow on the
anteroposterior (AP) view, which do not appear to be fractured. Ideally these joints
would also be included on the lateral radiograph as well. Because the girl has no
specific complaints or exam findings concerning for either a wrist or elbow injury, no
further imaging of these joints is needed. Most pediatric forearm fractures, including the BBFF sustained by this girl, can be managed nonoperatively as a result
of the significant remodeling potential of children’s bones. In this case, closed
reduction and long-arm casting is the treatment of choice.

APPROACH TO:
Pediatric Both Bone Forearm Fracture
DEFINITIONS
BOTH BONE FOREARM FRACTURE: A fracture involving both the radial
and ulnar shafts. They are classified in a descriptive fashion, based on the level

142

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

(distal, middle, proximal third) and the pattern (greenstick, plastic deformation,
complete, comminuted).
GREENSTICK FRACTURE: A fracture in which partial bony continuity is preserved. In other words, a break that does not violate all cortices. Greenstick fractures
are unique to children and can be thought of as an intermediate between a bending
deformation of soft pediatric bone and a complete fracture.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Mechanism of Injury
Forearm fractures are the most common pediatric fractures associated with
trampolines and the second most common fractures seen with falls from monkey
bars (supracondylar fractures are first). It is usually a fall onto an outstretched
hand that leads to a BBFF, with rotation influencing the location of the radius
and ulna fractures. For example, when a fall is accompanied by minimal torsion or rotation, the fractures of the radius and ulna are likely to be at the same
level. If the forearm is rotated during the injury, the radius and ulna usually
fracture at different levels.

Classification
Classification is usually descriptive and based on the level of the fractures (distal,
middle, proximal third) and the pattern (greenstick, plastic deformation, complete, comminuted). Many believe that the more proximal the forearm fracture,
the more difficult it is to treat. Fracture pattern can also influence treatment
options. While greenstick and complete fractures are usually amenable to closed
reduction and casting, comminuted fractures in both the radius and ulna may
require surgical plate fixation. A buckle fracture, which will look like a “speed
bump,” never occurs in isolation in the shaft but may accompany plastic deformation or greenstick fractures. A radial or ulnar shaft buckle fracture, which may
appear like a “speed bump” on radiographs, almost never occur in isolation. They
are typically accompanied by plastic deformation or greenstick fractures in the
other forearm bone.

Workup
Physical examination and plain radiographs (anteroposterior and lateral views) of
the involved forearm comprise the initial workup. Dedicated x-rays of the wrist
and elbow should be obtained only if clinical suspicion for injury at those joints
exists. On examination, soft tissue integrity, areas of tenderness, and any deformity
should be noted. Range of motion at both the elbow and wrist should be assessed,
as should forearm supination and pronation. Motor, sensory, and vascular exams
should also be performed. A useful way to evaluate motor function distal to the
injury is by asking the patient to perform the hand gestures from the game “rock,
paper, and scissors.” Median nerve function is observed via the “rock” gesture;
radial nerve function via the “paper” gesture; and ulnar nerve function via the
“scissor” gesture.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

143

TREATMENT
Both nonoperative and operative interventions have the identical goal: to achieve
healing within established anatomical and functional guidelines. In growing children, this must be done while taking into account the remodeling that occurs. Several mechanisms affect bone remodeling in children. The distal radial epiphysis
will correct angular deformity at approximately 10 degrees per year, independent
of age, as long as the physis remains open. As the bones lengthen through growth,
remodeling will lead to decreased angulation. Bone remodeling also occurs through
intramembranous apposition on the concave side and resorption on the convex side
of bone. This is best accomplished in children, who inherently have thick periosteum. Of note, children older than 11 years are less effective at correcting bone
angulation than younger children.
Most pediatric both bone forearm fractures are amenable to nonoperative treatment with reduction, if displaced, and long-arm casting. Young children with less
than 5 to 10 degrees of angulation do not require reduction. The following criteria
serve as age-dependent guidelines:
• For ages < 6 years, up to 15 degrees of angulation and 5 degrees of rotation
can be accepted.
• For ages 6 to 10 years old, less than 10 degrees of angulation is preferred, as is
end-to-end apposition; bayonet apposition is not ideal but may be acceptable.
• For ages ê 12 years, no angulation or rotation can be accepted.
• For ages ê 6 years, rotational deformity is never acceptable.
Long-arm casting of BBFFs includes placing a proper interosseous mold, supracondylar mold, and appropriate padding. A complete and proximal BBFF should be
immobilized in supination. This position allows the distal forearm to align with the
proximal fracture fragments, which have been pulled into supination by the now
unopposed biceps and supinator muscles. Fractures of the middle third of the radius
should be immobilized in neutral wrist rotation, since at this level, the supination
forces on the proximal fragments are neutralized by the pronator teres that remains
proximally attached. Fractures in the distal third should be immobilized in pronation to similarly neutralize the effect of the pronator quadratus distally. After acceptable reduction and application of a long-arm cast, the patient is followed with x-rays
at 1- to 2-week intervals.
When there is an open fracture or acceptable reduction cannot be achieved,
open reduction and internal fixation, rather than casting, is the preferred treatment.
Many operative techniques have been described and include plate fixation, flexible
intramedullary stabilization, and percutaneous pinning.

COMPLICATIONS
Complications after treatment of BBFFs include redisplacement and loss of reduction (the most common short-term complication, typically secondary to inadequate
cast molding), stiffness, refracture, malunion, delayed union/nonunion, radioulnar

144

synostosis resulting in complete loss of forearm rotation; neurapraxia (median nerve
most commonly), muscle and tendon entrapment, compartment syndrome, and
infection.

14.3 A 13-year-old girl sustains a both bone forearm fracture after a fall. Which of
the following statements is most accurate regarding the radiographic evaluation of anatomic forearm alignment after reduction?
A. On the AP radiograph, the ulnar styloid and the coronoid process are
oriented 270 degrees apart.
B. On the AP radiograph, the radial styloid and tuberosity are oriented
180 degrees apart.
C. On the lateral radiograph, the ulnar styloid and the coronoid process are
oriented 90 degrees apart.
D. On the AP radiograph, the radial styloid and tuberosity are oriented
90 degrees apart.

ANSWERS
14.1 C. A middle-third diaphyseal BBFF with 12 degrees of angulation in an
8-year-old is amenable to closed reduction and long-arm casting. In children
6 to 10 years old, less than 10 degrees of angulation is ideal and should be
accomplished with closed reduction in this patient. The extremity should
be immobilized in a neutral position via a long-arm cast, as the fracture is in
the middle third.
14.2 B. As bones lengthen through growth, remodeling also occurs and leads to
decreased angulation. Thus B is the correct answer. The distal radial epiphysis
will correct angular deformity at approximately 10 degrees per year, not 20, as
A states. Intramembranous apposition on the concave side and resorption on
the convex side of bone lead to remodeling, the opposite of that stated in C.
Lastly, children older than 11 years are less effective at correcting bone angulation than younger children, making D incorrect.
14.3 B. After proper reduction, the radial styloid and tuberosity are located
180 degrees apart. On lateral radiographs, the ulna styloid and the coronoid
are 180 degrees apart.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Classification of BBFFs is usually descriptive and based on the level of
the fractures (distal, middle, proximal third) and the pattern (greenstick,
plastic deformation, complete, comminuted).



Ipsilateral wrist and elbow regions should be included on the standard
forearm x-rays obtained when working up a BBFF. However, if clinical
suspicion is high for additional injury to either of those joints, then dedicated wrist and elbow films must be obtained.



Most pediatric both bone forearm fractures are amenable to nonoperative treatment with reduction, if displaced, and long-arm casting.



The amount of angulation and rotation that can be tolerated is age dependent, with less tolerance with increasing age.



When there is an open fracture or acceptable reduction cannot be
achieved, open reduction and internal fixation, rather than casting, is the
preferred treatment.

CASE 15
A 6-year-old female presents to the emergency department complaining of left
arm pain after falling from the monkey bars. She says she lost her grip and fell
directly onto an outstretched hand. She has difficulty flexing her forearm. Her past
medical and surgical histories are unremarkable. On examination of her left elbow,
there is a “dimpling” of the skin in the antecubital fossa, with mild swelling around
the elbow. She will not allow any range of elbow motion secondary to pain. With
encouragement, the patient can extend her wrist and fingers and can spread her
fingers apart. She has difficulty, however, flexing her thumb interphalangeal (IP)
joint and flexing her index and middle fingers at the distal interphalangeal (DIP)
joint. Sensation is intact throughout her left arm. Radial pulses are 2+. Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral plain films of the elbow are obtained (Figure 15–1).

ANSWERS TO CASE 15:
Supracondylar Humerus Fracture
Summary: This is a 6-year-old healthy girl with left elbow pain after falling 5 feet
from the monkey bars. There is dimpling in the antecubital fossa and mild swelling about the elbow. She has a motor deficit in her ipsilateral flexor pollicis longus
(FPL) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) of the index and middle fingers.
• Most likely diagnosis: Extension-type supracondylar fracture.
• Why children are most prone to this injury: Between 5 to 8 years of age,
pediatric humeri undergo remodeling in which the AP diameter of the distal
humerus becomes relatively thin. With forced extension, a taut, thick anterior
elbow joint capsule resists stretching as the olecranon engages the olecranon
fossa. This places great stress on the supracondylar region, potentially resulting
in extension-type fracture.
• Appropriate imaging: AP and lateral views of the elbow are essential. Additional imaging of the entire extremity is indicated for pediatric patients with
symptoms that cannot be entirely localized to the elbow.
• Physical exam findings: This patient has obvious palsies for the FPL and the
FDP of the index and middle fingers, which, in addition to the pronator quadratus, are the muscles typically innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve
(AIN), a branch of the median nerve. The AIN is the most commonly affected
nerve with extension-type supracondylar fractures.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical presentation of supracondylar fractures.
2. Understand the potential complications of supracondylar injuries.
3. Understand the treatment options for supracondylar fractures, their indications,
and their potential complications.

Considerations
This patient has suffered an isolated, 100% displaced, closed extension-type
supracondylar fracture. Priorities include adequate initial pain control, careful
neurologic exam, and prompt immobilization. Neurologic exams should always be
carefully performed and documented both before and after any form of manipulation.
With 100% displaced fractures such as with this patient, it is highly likely that
closed reduction with percutaneous pinning or open reduction with fixation will
be required to stabilize the fracture. For this reason, steps to prepare the patient
for the operating room should begin as soon as the diagnosis is made. Obtain an
efficient but thorough medical history; be sure to inquire about the patient’s last
meal or fluid intake and to alert the OR of the potential case.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

149

Additionally, the presence of an AIN palsy complicates treatment. Neurologic
deficit may be seen in up to 10% to 20% of closed supracondylar fractures, yet the
great majority of these injuries resolve spontaneously without operative nerve exploration. Although controversial, attempts may be made to close reduce this fracture
in the operating room with possible percutaneous pin fixation. If closed reduction
cannot be achieved, open reduction must be performed; at this point, exploration of
the nerve may be indicated.

APPROACH TO:
Supracondylar Humerus Fracture
DEFINITIONS
ANTERIOR HUMERAL LINE: A radiographic line drawn along the anterior
humerus on lateral radiographs of the elbow. In normal elbows, this should intersect
the middle third of the capitellar ossification center.
POSTERIOR FAT PAD SIGN: A radiographic lucency located immediately posterior to the elbow on lateral elbow radiographs when a joint effusion is present.
Normally, this small pad of posterior fat is radiographically invisible because it is
hidden within the olecranon fossa; however, with elbow effusions, the distended
joint brings the fat pad into view. In the setting of trauma, a posterior fat pad sign is
up to 70% sensitive for an intracapsular fracture.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
Supracondylar fractures are the most common pediatric elbow fractures, accounting
for approximately 55% to 75% of all pediatric elbow fractures. These injuries occur
most frequently in the nondominant hand of children between 5 and 10 years of age.
There is a slight male predominance. Supracondylar fractures may be either extension type or flexion type, depending on the mechanism of injury. Extension-type
injuries are by far the most common, representing up to 98% of all cases.

Mechanism of Injury and Relevant Anatomy
The supracondylar region is located directly above the articular condyles of the distal
humerus and consists of an area of cancellous bone encased within a thin cortex.
This region is especially susceptible to injury, as significant remodeling occurs
roughly between the ages of 5 to 8 years of age. A thick anterior joint capsule resists
stretch when the elbow is hyperextended. As the olecranon engages the olecranon
fossa, significant stress is placed on the relatively thin supracondylar region, resulting
in potential extension-type fracture. Extension-type supracondylar fractures result
most frequently from a fall on an extended forearm, which may result posterior
displaced or posterior angulation (ie, apex anterior) of the distal fragment. A direct
fall on the posterior region of a flexed elbow is the most common mechanism for
flexion-type supracondylar fractures.

150

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

History and Physical Exam
The physician should suspect a fracture in any child who exhibits pain or reluctance
to move the affected elbow. Close inspection should evaluate for open fracture.
In the setting of local laceration, when one is unsure if the joint is violated, the
elbow may be injected with normal saline and observed for extravasation to rule
out an open joint injury. A complete neurovascular exam should be obtained,
evaluating pulses and capillary refill distally with comparison to the unaffected
side. Next, sensory distributions of the radial nerve (first dorsal webspace), medial
nerve (palmar side of index finger), ulnar nerve (palmar side of fifth digit), and
musculocutaneous nerve (lateral aspect of forearm) should be evaluated, as well
as motor evaluation of the median, AIN, radial, and ulna nerves. Neurovascular
exams must be repeated and carefully documented after reduction or manipulations of any kind.

Radiographic Evaluation
Radiographs of the pediatric elbow are among the most complex and difficult-tointerpret images in all of orthopaedics. At 5 to 10 years of age, roughly the age
at which children are most prone to supracondylar fractures, there are six immature
ossification centers that eventually fuse to form the mature elbow. The order
of ossification for the six ossification centers may be memorized by the acronym
“CRMTOL”—capitellum, radial head, medial epicondyle, trochlea, olecranon, and
lateral epicondyle. Conveniently, these begin to ossify at approximately 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, and 12 years of age, respectively.
Radiographic evaluation of the entire affected extremity is recommended when
symptoms cannot be clearly localized to a single, specific point. As stated, AP and
lateral views of the elbow are essential. When obtaining lateral films of the elbow,
external rotation must be avoided, as this can displace the fracture.
Classically, supracondylar fracture radiographs will have a positive posterior fat
pad sign, indicative of joint effusion from a fracture. The sensitivity of the posterior
fat pad sign is > 70% in the setting of trauma without visible fractures lines. Anterior and superior fat pad signs are less sensitive. Additional radiographic assessment
should include confirmation that the radial head aligns with the capitellum in all
views. Finally, the anterior humeral line should bisect the middle third of the capitellum; in displaced extension-type injuries, the capitellum can fall posterior to the
anterior humeral line.

CLASSIFICATIONS AND TREATMENT
Extension-type supracondylar fractures are classified by the Gartland classification,
which is based primarily on the degree of displacement.
• Type I fractures: nondisplaced
• Type II fractures: displaced with minimal angulation/rotation, posterior cortex
is intact
• Type III fractures: complete displacement

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

151

The majority of supracondylar fractures that are neither open nor complicated by
neurovascular injury are treated with careful reduction followed by long-arm cast or
splint immobilization. Nondisplaced, or type I fractures, are treated with a long-arm
cast with the elbow flexed between 60 and 90 degrees for a minimum of 2 to 3 weeks.

Reduction
Type II and Type III fractures require careful reduction, which may be performed by
hyperextending at the elbow with simultaneous traction, followed by flexion at the
elbow while simultaneously applying posterior force to the reduced fragment to prevent
it from slipping. Long-arm cast immobilization should follow. Both type II and III
fractures that are unstable on reduction may benefit from percutaneous pinning,
which should be performed under anesthesia in the operating room. Type III fractures
may not always be reducible by closed methods, and therefore, open reduction and
pinning or internal fixation may be necessary to achieve stabilization.

Complications
Neurovascular injury can have an incidence rate as high as 7% to 10%, typically
secondary to excessive traction during injury or nerve/vessel entrapment at the fracture site. Fortunately, the majority of nerve injuries are neurapraxias—self-limited,
physiologic (not structural) nerve dysfunctions that typically resolve spontaneously.
With extension-type injuries, the AIN is the most commonly affected nerve.
With flexion-type injuries, conversely, the ulnar nerve is the most commonly
affected nerve.
The ulnar nerve is also especially prone to iatrogenic injury due to its prominent,
superficial location over the lateral epicondyle. During cross-pinning fixation for
type II and type III injuries, great care must be taken to avoid trauma to the nerve
when placing medial-to-lateral pins. For this reason, many surgeons simply avoid
placing medial-to-lateral pins and instead achieve fixation with 2 or more lateral-tomedial percutaneous pins in parallel. Although biomechanical studies have demonstrated that cross-pinning techniques achieve stronger fixation than parallel pins,
the clinical outcomes are essentially equivalent between the techniques.
Although rare (< 1% in isolated supracondylar injuries), it is important to
evaluate for developing compartment syndromes. Concomitant vascular injury is
uncommon with supracondylar fractures, occurring in fewer than 20% of displaced
fractures—or approximately 0.5% of all cases. Typically, the brachial artery is
impinged or lacerated at the fracture site, or it can become compressed secondary to
swelling in the antecubital fossa. If pulses are absent on examination, but the hand
is warm to touch with brisk capillary refill, the arm may be closely monitored. If the
patient’s hand is cool to touch with markedly pale digits compared with the unaffected
side, emergency compartment release and/or angiographic studies may be indicated.
Finally, cubitus varus, sometimes referred to as a “gunstock deformity,” may
result from inadequately reduced supracondylar fractures that heal with a malunion.
This is typically a cosmetic, not functional, complication, and its incidence has been
dramatically reduced with the widespread use of percutaneous pinning (2% with
residual deformity) versus casting alone (8% with residual deformity).

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
15.1 A 10-year-old girl reports right elbow pain after a fall while running from a
school bully. She has no other injuries and refuses to move the elbow out of
fear of pain. Radiographs are notable for a positive fat pad sign, but show no
obvious fracture line. Contralateral images of the left, unaffected elbow are
obtained for comparison. Which of the following elbow apophyses is the last
to appear on elbow radiographs?
A. Trochlea
B. Lateral epicondyle
C. Medial epicondyle
D. Radial head
E. Olecranon
15.2 An 8-year-old boy falls from the playground slide on a flexed left elbow and
suffers a flexion type, fully displaced closed flexion-type supracondylar fracture. He complains of some finger numbness in the emergency department,
but will not let anybody close enough to examine his arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this fracture?
A. Brachial artery
B. Anterior interosseous nerve
C. Radial nerve
D. Ulnar nerve
E. Radial artery
15.3 A 5-year-old boy falls from a highchair during a rowdy game of “Go Fish” and
falls onto an outstretched right hand. He presents to the emergency department with complaints that he can’t move his arm. X-rays reveal a Gartland
type III extension-type supracondylar fracture. His fingers are warm and well
perfused, but no radial pulse is palpable. On careful examination, with which
of the following motions is he most likely to have difficulty?
A. Wrist extension
B. “Thumbs up”
C. “A-okay” sign
D. Thumb-small finger opposition
E. Fanning out his fingers

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

153

ANSWERS
15.1 B. The lateral epicondyle should be the last apophysis to ossify in normal skeletal development. Generally, the order and age for elbow apophyseal ossification is capitellum, radial head, medial epicondyle, trochlea, olecranon, and
lateral epicondyle, which ossify at approximately 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 years of
age, respectively.
15.2 D. Although the anterior interosseous nerve is most commonly injured in
extension-type supracondylar fractures (by far the most common type of supracondylar fracture), the ulnar nerve is more commonly injured in flexion-type
supracondylar fractures. The brachial artery is potentially injured, albeit rarely,
with flexion-type injuries. The radial artery does not branch until the brachial
artery trifurcation, which occurs distal to the elbow. Radial nerve injury is the
second most common form of nerve injury in extension-type fractures.
15.3 C. The “A-okay” sign, made by flexing the thumb and index finger to make
a ring, tests thumb IP flexion and index finger DIP flexion, 2 tasks specific to
the AIN. The AIN is most commonly injured in extension-type supracondylar
fractures. “Thumbs up” and wrist extension are functions of the radial nerve—
the second most commonly injured nerve with extension-type injuries.
Finger fanning is a function of the intrinsic finger abductors of the ulnar nerve.
Thumb and small finger opposition relies mostly on the thenar eminence
(pollicis opponens), which is innervated by the recurrent median nerve.

CLINICAL PEARLS


There is a seasonal distribution of supracondylar fractures in children,
with the great majority occurring during summer-time play.



X-rays of the pediatric elbow are complex and often difficult to interpret
due to the variability of ossification centers. Images of the contralateral,
normal elbow are often helpful for comparison.



The presence of a posterior fat pad sign on lateral x-ray is helpful in determining the presence of a fracture or intraarticular pathology when no
fracture line is obvious.

CASE 16
An 8-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents with
a 48-hour history of left thigh swelling and irritability. They also state that the
child has been barely moving his left lower extremity over this time. The parents
do not recall any injury or recent trauma. After further discussion, the mother
does recall that approximately 2 days ago, the child fell from the changing table
(~3 feet off the ground) onto the carpeted floor of their apartment. On examination, the child is developmentally appropriate but irritable. His left thigh is swollen and exquisitely tender. He will not move his leg. You also note several other
bruises on the child’s right arm. Radiographs are taken (Figure 16–1).

ANSWERS TO CASE 16:
Child Abuse
Summary: An 8-month-old boy presents with a 48-hour history of irritability and
left thigh swelling. The parents at first deny any recent trauma but then recall
the child falling from his changing table 2 days prior. On examination, the thigh
is swollen and the child is irritable. You also note bruising of the right upper
extremity. Radiographs of the left femur reveal a spiral fracture and an older
proximal tibia fracture.
• Most likely diagnosis: Physical abuse.
• Next step: Skeletal survey.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize orthopaedic injuries associated with child abuse.
2. Know the proper workup for suspected child maltreatment.
3. Understand the importance of reporting suspected child abuse.

Considerations
The proposed mechanism of injury, a fall from a changing table only 3 feet off the
ground, is unlikely to cause a femur fracture. Furthermore, the spiral nature of
the fracture is inconsistent with the mother’s story, as these fractures typically
result from twisting injuries and not simple falls. Additional concerns include
the bruising observed on the child’s right upper extremity, the older proximal
tibia fracture, and the mother’s delay in seeking medical attention for 2 days from
the initial accident. Many pediatricians who frequently encounter child abuse
advocate for clinicians to assume that any long bone fracture in a child under
3 years of age is child abuse until proven otherwise. Therefore, it is imperative
that after a complete skeletal survey of this child to assess for other bony injuries,
this case be reported to children’s protective services for suspected abuse.

APPROACH TO:
Child Abuse
DEFINITIONS
SKELETAL SURVEY: Dedicated radiographs of every anatomic region of the body
used to look for signs of previous and/or acute injuries when abuse is suspected.
Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral images of the axial skeleton and frontal projections of each extremity are included.

CHILDREN’S PROTECTIVE SERVICES: Local governmental agency responsible for conducting civil investigations of children alleged to have been abused or
neglected.
THE CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT: Defines
child abuse as “at a minimum, any act or failure to act resulting in imminent
risk of serious harm, death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse, or
exploitation of a child by a parent or caretaker who is responsible for the child’s
welfare.”

CLINICAL APPROACH
Each year more than 1 million children are the victims of abuse or neglect, and
more than 1200 of them die as a result of the abuse. Although health care providers
are mandated to report all cases of suspected abuse as dictated by civil statutes, the
diagnosis is rarely straightforward. It often requires consideration of sociobehavioral
factors and clinical findings. Fractures are the second most common presentation of
physical abuse after skin lesions. It is therefore pivotal that the orthopaedist understand the signs of nonaccidental trauma to increase the likelihood of recognition
and proper management.

General Considerations
A thorough history and complete general and orthopaedic examination is necessary in cases of suspected child abuse. An abused child may be either overly
passive or overly aggressive. Irritability, hyperactivity, and destructive behavior may all be observed on exam. Age-appropriate questions must be asked.
Leading questions should be avoided. The parents’ behavior may also provide
clues regarding whether this is a case of abuse. Red flags include a vague history that lacks detail, providing an injury mechanism inconsistent with the
physical findings, or parents who are hostile or too casual during questioning
( Table 16–1 ).

CHILD ABUSE

Comprehensive Study Guide. 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2010:Fig. 290-4.)

Musculoskeletal Features
Approximately one third of children who are victims of nonaccidental trauma
require orthopaedic care, with fractures most common in younger children due
to the vulnerability of their developing skeletons and defenselessness. Although
multiple fractures in various stages of healing are very common in abused children,
many will present with only 1 fracture.
Long bone (femur or humerus) fractures are the most commonly fractured bones
in child abuse. Certain types, such as the midshaft spiral femur fracture, were once
thought of as indicative of nonaccidental trauma. However, studies have found
that no specific fracture pattern in the femur is pathognomonic of abuse and that
all patterns can be observed. Fractures of the hands, feet, and clavicle are uncommon in abuse, as are physeal fractures. The lone exception is transphyseal fractures
of the distal humerus in children less than 1 year old. Metaphyseal fractures are
less common than diaphyseal injuries, but are very concerning for physical abuse
(Figure 16–2).

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND WORKUP OF
SUSPECTED ABUSE
Any condition that can lead to bruising, fracture, or periosteal changes must be
considered in the differential diagnosis of child abuse. Biomechanical testing for

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

159

metabolic markers for bone disease (ie, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphate,
copper, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D) should be performed.
Osteogenesis imperfecta may present like nonaccidental trauma and should also
be investigated with genetic testing and biochemical analysis. When bruising
is present, a complete blood count, differential blood count, and coagulation
studies must be performed. Occasionally, children with leukemia, hemophilia,
or other hematologic disorders are brought in for suspected abuse due to multiple bruises. Other rare pediatric conditions that can present like abuse include
Caffey disease, rickets, and congenital syphilis. It is important to note that
the practitioner must also always consider accidental trauma and normal radiographic variants as potential causes of the clinical presentation of a patient for
whom abuse is suspected.
A skeletal survey should be used in addition to imaging of obvious deformities to
detect other acute or healed fractures in potentially abused children. The American
Academy of Pediatrics Section on Radiology recommends a mandatory survey in
all cases of suspected abuse in children less than 2 years of age. In those between
2 and 5 years of age, a skeletal survey should be done based on clinical indications. In children older than 5 years, the skeletal survey has minimal value.
Radionuclide bone scanning for detection of physical abuse is controversial and
should be reserved for use when skeletal surveys are negative despite high suspicion
for abuse. Additionally, a repeat skeletal survey 2 weeks after initial presentation
may reveal injuries not evident in the initial survey in cases with high suspicion for
abuse.

MANAGEMENT
In most states, physicians are required to report suspected cases of child abuse based
on reasonable suspicion of nonaccidental trauma or maltreatment. Reporters are
immune from civil and criminal liability, even if it is ultimately determined that
no abuse has occurred.
The treatment of abuse fractures is identical to those incurred accidentally and
are typically amenable to closed, nonoperative treatment. However, the orthopaedic
management of the abused child is only one component of treatment, and a teamoriented approach is essential. This includes pediatricians, other subspecialists, and
social workers.
When the orthopaedist is the first physician to see a potentially abused child,
communication with the nearby emergency department or local child abuse
agency must be swiftly initiated. Hospital admission is often required to care for
the acute injuries and to provide a safe environment where a full workup can be
conducted.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
16.1 A 3-year-old girl presents shortly after a right arm injury. The patient’s father
reports that he was playing with his daughter by swinging the girl in circles
while holding on to her arms when she suddenly complained of pain in the left
arm. The patient immediately held the injured arm close to her body with the
help of her noninjured arm. Which of the following is most accurate regarding
this injury?
A. Represents child abuse
B. Requires a skeletal survey
C. Is a common accidental injury
D. Is inconsistent with the described mechanism of injury
16.2 Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) may present similarly to child maltreatment.
However, there are features of OI that may help differentiate the 2, including
blue sclera and osteopenia. Which of the following is another distinguishing
feature?
A. Polydactyly
B. Patent foramen ovale
C. Multiple fractures in the setting of minimal trauma
D. Dental involvement
16.3 The pediatrician of a 2-year-old girl orders a skeletal survey because of suspected abuse. The imaging identifies multiple fractures, including the right
humerus, left tibia, and right femur. Because it is important to distinguish
between those that are acute versus those that are older and already healing,
the pediatrician calls her colleagues in the Orthopaedics Department, who
reviews with her the age-based features of fracture healing. At what point does
new periosteal bone formation become apparent on plain radiographs?
A. 4 to 14 days
B. 1 to 2 months
C. 1 year
D. Within hours

ANSWERS
16.1 C. This case represents a nursemaid’s elbow, which is caused by a traction
force on an outstretched arm. This is a common accidental injury in which
the patient presents with a slightly flexed and pronated arm. The injury is
reduced by flexion and supination of the patient’s forearm with concurrent
pressure over the radial head. A successful reduction should return the patient
to full use of the arm immediately.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

161

16.2 D. Multiple medical conditions can present similarly to nonaccidental
trauma, including OI. This autosomal dominant genetic disease often presents with multiple fractures in the setting of minimal trauma. However,
distinguishing features include osteopenia, blue sclera, family history, and
dental involvement. Polydactyly and a patent foramen ovale are not typical
features of OI.
16.3 A. To estimate the age of a fracture, it is important to know the age-dependent
radiographic features of healing fractures. Listed below is a timeline for the
appearance of various radiographic features:
Days 2 to 10: Soft tissue swelling subsides
Days 4 to 14: New periosteal bone formation becomes apparent
Days 10 to 21: Loss of definition of fracture line, presence of soft callus
Days 14 to 42: Presence of hard callus
Months 3 to 12: Fracture remodeling

CLINICAL PEARLS


Although multiple fractures in various stages of healing are very common
in abused children, many will present with only 1 fracture.



Any condition that can lead to bruising, fracture, or periosteal changes
must be considered in the differential diagnosis of child abuse.



The American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Radiology recommends
a mandatory survey in all cases of suspected abuse in children less than
2 years of age.



A team-oriented approach to the abused child is crucial and involves
pediatricians, subspecialists, and social workers.

CASE 17
A 13-year-old African American male patient presents to the emergency department with pain in his left knee after falling on his side during a soccer game. He is
unable to ambulate and is in significant discomfort. His mother states that he has
been experiencing several weeks of pain in his left knee before his fall, but x-rays
and repeated exams of his knee at his primary care physician’s office had failed
to demonstrate any pathology. The patient has no known past medical history.
He denies fevers, chills, and recent illness, and he recalls no history of traumatic
injury to his left lower extremity. On examination, the child is obese and is comfortable after administration of appropriate analgesia. His left lower extremity is
held in slight external rotation. His knee is without effusion and has a full range
of painless motion. Motion at the hip, however, is painful, especially with passive
internal/external rotation. He is neurovascularly intact throughout his bilateral
extremities. Exam of the right lower extremity is unremarkable. Laboratory studies
are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 7.3 mIU/mL
(normal 0.6-5.5 mIU/mL). An anteroposterior (AP) pelvis and bilateral frog-leg
lateral views are shown in Figures 17–1 and 17–2, respectively.

ANSWERS TO CASE 17:
Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE)
Summary: A 13-year-old obese, African American male presents with several weeks
of left lower extremity pain, exacerbated by a recent fall. Exam demonstrates left
hip pathology that is referred to the knee. Additionally, the patient has previously
undiagnosed hypothyroidism.
• Most likely diagnosis: Left slipped capital femoral epiphysis.
• Historical risk factors: Obesity, male, African American, adolescence, with
concomitant endocrinopathy (hypothyroidism).
• Next appropriate step: Percutaneous screw fixation.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the presentation of SCFE.
2. Understand the workup for SCFE and patient population.
3. Be familiar with the treatment for SCFE and its potential long-term complications.

Considerations
This is an overweight, African American male adolescent with a history of pain in
his left knee. Up to 46% of patients with SCFE will present initially with complaints
of distal thigh or knee pain. It is essential to recognize that hip pathology can often
be referred to the distal thigh or knee. Complaints of knee pain should warrant
complete and thorough physical exam, and typically radiographic evaluation, of
the ipsilateral hip. Patients with SCFE typically present with an externally rotated,
subtly foreshortened lower extremity, with a markedly decrease range of painful
internal rotation.
Hip x-rays should include, at a minimum, an AP view of the pelvis as well as
lateral views of each femoral head and neck, typically achieved through a frog-leg
lateral view. Although this patient’s SCFE is clearly visible on both AP and lateral
films, early SCFE lesions are often subtle and are generally apparent on lateral views
before they are obvious on the AP.
Patients with newly diagnosed SCFE lesions should be immediately made nonweightbearing on the effected extremity. Complete workup for SCFE secondary
to underlying medical conditions should be performed, including initial laboratory testing for TSH, a complete metabolic panel, and a complete blood count.
Patients undergoing potential operative fixation should always receive blood type
and screening and coagulation (prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time)
studies.

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

APPROACH TO:
Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE)
DEFINITIONS
OSTEONECROSIS: The cellular death of bone, typically resulting from a prolonged disruption of blood supply.
STABLE SCFE: Defined simply by the patient’s ability to ambulate, even with crutch
assistance. Less than 10% of patients with a stable SCFE develop osteonecrosis.
UNSTABLE SCFE: Defined as SCFE in patients who are unable to ambulate.
These patients have a high incidence of osteonecrosis, upward of 50%.

CLINICAL APPROACH
SCFE (often pronounced “skiffy”) is a disorder of adolescence in which a fracture—
or, technically, a disruption—occurs through the growth plate of the femoral head.
The epiphysis, or region of developing bone above the growth plate (physis), is
therefore mobile and tends to “slip” from the neck of the femur under the repetitive
loading of body weight. The “slipping” process is actually a misnomer, however, as
it is not technically the epiphysis that slips from the femur, but rather the femur
that displaces from the anatomically stable epiphysis.

Epidemiology
SCFE typically affects children between 10 and 17 years of age, occurring at an
average of 13.4 years for boys and 12.2 years for girls. Its prevalence in the United
States is 10 in 100,000 people annually. SCFE has a slight male-to-female predominance of 3:2 and occurs at increased incidences of 2.2 in patients of African ancestry, 4.5 in those of Pacific Islander ancestry, and 0.1 for North African and Indian
subcontinental ancestry, versus 1.0 for white controls. Racial differences are closely
related to average adolescent body weights.

Pathogenesis
As stated, SCFE is a failure of the physis, with separation of the epiphysis from the
proximal femoral metaphysis. Biomechanical factors such as obesity, femoral retroversion (increased posterior angulation of the femoral neck), and increased physeal
obliquity (an increasingly angulated growth plate that is vulnerable to shearing forces
when body weight is loaded) all contribute to physeal weakening. In younger children, the physis is protected by a perichondral ring that resists shearing forces. This
protective ring weakens in adolescence, however, and increases the risk of SCFE.
SCFE occurs during puberty, when rapid cellular expansion is occurring at the
physeal zone of hypertrophy. Failure is thought to occur at this slightly weakened
zone of rapid, immature expansion. Finally, hormonal and endocrine changes are
associated with SCFE, but the mechanisms by which they contribute to the disease
process are not fully understood. There are data to show that hypothyroidism,
growth hormone supplementation, and hypogonadism increase one’s risk of SCFE.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

167

Radiology
The direction of a typical “slip” causes the femur to fall into varus, extension, and
external rotation. Typically, the epiphysis tends to move posteriorly first, a translation that is most apparent on frog-leg lateral views. With the femurs externally
rotated, abducted, and flexed, an unobstructed lateral view of the femoral neck
shows early posterior displacement of the epiphysis. For this reason, frog-leg lateral
images are considered most sensitive for the diagnosis.
Several radiographic measurements can be made to diagnose and grade SCFE.
The Klein line, or a line drawn parallel to the superior femoral neck, should intersect the epiphysis in normal individuals. In patients with advanced slips, however,
the Klein line contacts the edge of, or is superior to, the migrating epiphysis. The
metaphyseal blanch sign of Steel is a blurring of the proximal femoral metaphysis
that may be visualized on an AP pelvis film. This is caused by overlapping of the
normal metaphysis with the posteriorly displaced epiphysis.

CLASSIFICATION
Although several classification schemes exist, the most practical and prognostically relevant classification divides the disease into stable and unstable SCFE.
SCFE stability is defined simply by whether or not the patient is able to tolerate
weightbearing on the affected extremity. Stability includes those who are able to
partially weight bear with crutches. Patients with unstable SCFE are so uncomfortable with movement of the hip that they refuse to ambulate. Up to 50% of
patients with unstable SCFE have an incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral
head.

TREATMENT
Intervention should occur as soon as the diagnosis is made. For patients with mild
or moderate stable disease, in situ fixation is the method of choice. Attempts to
forcefully reduce the deformity are not recommended; however, sometimes the slip
will spontaneously reduce or improve when the patient is positioned for surgery.
Regardless, the goal or treatment is to stabilize the slipped epiphysis, as remodeling
often occurs and patients can tolerate a certain degree of residual external rotation. Single-screw percutaneous fixation is the most common mode of treatment,
although double-screw fixation techniques are sometimes performed. For singlescrew fixation, the goal is to place the screw through the middle of the epiphysis and perpendicular to the growth plate. Patients with stable slips are typically
allowed to bear weight after fixation. Bilateral fixation may be indicated in patients
with underlying endocrinopathies, even if the contralateral hip is asymptomatic
and without radiographic evidence of the disease. Although controversial, some
authors also advocate for the prophylactic pinning of the contralateral hip in
children less than 10 years of age with unilateral SCFE or in those with open
triradiate cartilage. The impetus behind prophylactic fixation of the unaffected
hip stems from the elevated rates at which young children and patients with endocrinopathies develop bilateral disease.

168

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

In patients with unstable SCFE, there is significant controversy over whether
reduction manipulations should be employed versus in situ fixation, whether capsulotomy or arthrocentesis should be performed versus no joint decompression, and
whether single- versus multiple-screw fixation techniques should be used. Most surgeons advocate relatively urgent treatment in these patients, as greater than 24 hours
between acute injury and fixation may be associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis. A common treatment regimen for unstable SCFE involves single-screw
fixation after joint aspiration to relieve intracapsular pressure and promote vascular
perfusion. These patients are generally made nonweightbearing with crutches for
6 to 8 weeks postoperatively.

Complications
Osteonecrosis is a severe, debilitating complication, for which risk is increased with
unstable SCFE, delayed surgical fixation of acute unstable SCFE, attempted reduction manipulations, and improper placement of pins, specifically in the posteriorsuperior femoral neck, leading to disruption of vasculature. Osteonecrosis is initially
managed with nonweightbearing, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and gentle
range-of-motion exercises. When severe, however, reconstructive intervention may
be necessary. Slip progression after initial fixation is another potential complication that, fortunately, occurs in only 1% to 2% of patients after single-screw fixation. Although double-screw fixation may theoretically reduce this complication,
elevated potential risks of osteonecrosis with multiple-screw fixation favors singlescrew techniques for most surgeons.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
17.1 A 13-year-old boy is referred to your office with a right-sided SCFE after
workup over several weeks by his pediatrician for insidious right knee pain.
On exam, he has obligatory external rotation with hip flexion and is refusing
to bear weight. His TSH is 8.5 mIU/mL. Which of the following is the most
appropriate treatment for this patient?
A. Percutaneous pinning of the right hip
B. Open reduction and capsulotomy of the right hip with plate and screw
fixation
C. Percutaneous pinning of the left hip
D. Percutaneous pinning of bilateral hips
E. Administration of levothyroxine with follow-up TSH levels in outpatient
setting and bed rest until resolution of pain

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

169

17.2 Through which of the following physeal zones does the disruption in SCFE
typically occur?
A. Reserve zone
B. Proliferative zone
C. Hypertrophic zone
D. Zone of provisional calcification
17.3 An 8-year-old obese girl of Pacific Island ancestry is referred to your office
for a right-sided unstable SCFE lesion after a fall while playing kick-ball. She
had no previous pain in this extremity. On examination, she has an externally rotated right lower extremity that is severely painful with passive range
of motion. Frog-leg lateral x-rays show a displaced right SCFE lesion with a
normal-appearing left femoral head. Which of the following factors is indication to prophylactically fix this patient’s left hip?
A. Obesity
B. Age
C. Unstable nature of the right-sided SCFE
D. Acute, traumatic right-sided SCFE without preexisting symptoms
E. Pacific Island ancestry

ANSWERS
17.1 D. Bilateral percutaneous screw fixation is appropriate in this patient due
to the patient’s history of undiagnosed hypothyroidism. His right hip, most
urgently, requires fixation, but the presence of endocrinopathy is a generally
accepted indication for additional fixation of the unaffected contralateral
side. Management of hypothyroidism is important in this patient, but bed rest
is generally an unsuitable treatment for SCFE.
17.2 C. SCFE classically occurs through the zone of hypertrophy, a region of rapid
cellular expansion during the adolescent growth spurt that is especially vulnerable to shearing injury.
17.3 B. Indications to prophylactically fix the contralateral hip in a patient with a
unilateral SCFE lesion are limited to patients with obvious endocrinopathies
and those younger than 10 years of age or with open triradiate cartilage. This
patient’s age is reason enough to strongly consider preemptively pinning the
left hip. Her obesity and ethnicity are risk factors for SCFE; however, they are
not indications for prophylactic fixation. The unstable and acute nature of
her SCFE lesions does not necessarily correlate with a need for prophylactic
intervention.

170

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

CLINICAL PEARLS


Remember that hip pathology can often be referred to the distal thigh or
knee and thus a complete exam of both joints is essential. Almost 50% of
SCFE patients present with distal thigh or knee pain.



Percutaneous single-screw in situ fixation is the treatment of choice
for SCFE.



Prophylactic fixation of the contralateral hip, regardless of whether or not
it is symptomatic, is generally advocated in patients with SCFE secondary
to endocrinopathies or in SCFE patients younger than 10 years at presentation. Admittedly, this is controversial.

CASE 18
A young couple’s 14-month-old daughter is referred to the pediatric orthopaedic
clinic by their general pediatrician because of a limp they noticed when their child
ambulates. The parents cannot recall an inciting event or specific day that this
began and deny any recent trauma. They state that their daughter does not appear
to be in pain when she walks and has had no recent illnesses or sick contacts.
The child is in good health and has met all developmental milestones up to this
point, including taking her first steps at 9 months and walking independently at
12 months. Of note, this is the parent’s first child. Although the pregnancy was
uncomplicated, the child was ultimately delivered at full term via cesarean section
as a result of a breech presentation. The parents also state that ultrasonography
for “some type of hip problem” was performed at 5 weeks of age and was normal.
On exam, the left leg appears shorter than the right. Additionally, a greater degree
of hip abduction is noted on the right versus the left.

ANSWERS TO CASE 18:
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip
Summary: An otherwise healthy 14-month-old girl is brought to the clinic by her
parents due to a limp. On exam, the left hip has decreased abduction compared
with the right, and the left leg is shorter than the right. The parents state that this
is their first child and that she was born full term via cesarean section as a result of a
breech presentation. She has met all developmental milestones to this point. They
also recall an ultrasound for “some type of hip problem” performed at 5 weeks of age
that was negative.
• Most likely diagnosis: Developmental dysplasia of the left hip (DDH).
• Next step in workup: Anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the pelvis.
• Treatment: Closed reduction of the left hip under general anesthesia followed
by spica cast placement.
• Diagnostic maneuvers in the newborn: Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the “classic” history and presentation of DDH.
2. Know the diagnostic approach to DDH.
3. Understand treatment and how it differs based on patient’s age.
4. Appreciate the complications associated with DDH.

Considerations
This 14-month-old child has a constellation of findings concerning for left hip
pathology. The differential diagnosis of a limp in this age group must be considered
here and includes both infectious and noninfectious causes. The former includes conditions such as a septic hip or osteomyelitis, whereas the latter includes transient
synovitis, trauma, and DDH. Per the patient’s family, the patient has had no recent
illness or been exposed to any sick contacts, making infectious causes and transient
synovitis unlikely. The parents also deny any recent trauma. When entertaining the
diagnosis of DDH in this patient, the birth history is significant, as DDH risk factors include female sex, breech presentation, and first-born status; this patient has
all of these. The parents also state that an ultrasound done when their daughter was
5 weeks old, presumably to evaluate for DDH, was negative. This should not deter
the orthopaedist from a diagnosis of DDH, as diagnosis can be delayed for multiple
reasons, including late development of the pathologic changes associated with it.
The same can be said for negative physical exam findings for DDH during the initial
newborn screening, which is performed on all infants and includes the Ortolani and
Barlow tests. Because of the significant long-term complications of DDH, a complete
workup must ensue, with treatment initiated as soon as possible.

APPROACH TO:
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip
DEFINITIONS
DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP: Term describing a spectrum of
developmental abnormalities of the hip joint that lead to subluxation and dislocation, predisposing patients to the development of early degenerative changes.
TRENDELENBURG GAIT: An abnormal gait associated with hip abductor
weakness (ie, gluteus medius). It is characterized by the dropping of the pelvis on
the unaffected side of the body at the time of heelstrike on the affected side. This
lasts until heelstrike on the unaffected side, at which time lateral protrusion of the
affected hip occurs. This gait can be seen in children with DDH.

knees in the supine position so that the ankles touch the buttocks (Figure 18–1).

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

If the knees are not level, the test is considered positive and indicates a possible congenital hip malformation. The test is also known as the Allis sign.
ORTOLANI AND BARLOW SIGNS: Two maneuvers used to evaluate for DDH.
The Ortolani exam is a reduction maneuver that restores normal hip joint anatomy,
whereas the Barlow exam is a provocative maneuver that detects an unstable hip
(Figure 18–1). These tests may be negative beginning at 3 months of age, despite
DDH being present, due to the development of soft-tissue contractures.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiology
DDH is the most common orthopaedic abnormality in newborns and is the result of
a disruption in the normal relationship between the acetabulum and femoral head.
The incidence of DDH is reported anywhere from 1 to more than 35 per 1000 live
births. DDH is most common in Native Americans and is also seen in whites. It is
rare in African Americans. It is considered a multifactorial trait and is more common in females (females comprise ~80% of cases), firstborn infants, and those
born in the breech presentation. The risk for DDH is increased 12-fold if a firstdegree relative has it.
The neonatal hip is unstable because of the undeveloped muscle, ligamentous
laxity, and easily deformed cartilaginous surfaces comprising the joint. This relative
instability, coupled with any positioning in utero that may stretch the hip capsule
(as seen with the excessive flexion and adduction in a breech presentation), will
predispose the neonate to subluxation or dislocation. The left hip is more frequently involved because the left femur is adducted against the mother’s lumbosacral spine when in the left occiput anterior (most common) intrauterine position.
Instability results as less femoral epiphysis is contained by the acetabulum.
The femoral head displaces posteriorly and superiorly because of the pull of the
gluteal and hip flexor muscles. When subluxated, this causes an asymmetric pressure that leads to a dysplastic, progressive flattening of the posterior and superior
acetabular rim and medial femoral head. When dislocated, the normal, concentric
motion seen at the hip joint is lost, and the joint surfaces become dysplastic with a
deformed and shallow configuration.

Diagnosis
Physical exam and imaging are the mainstays of diagnosis. In the newborn, the
Ortolani and Barlow tests are performed as part of the standard newborn screens.
In the Ortolani maneuver (Figure 18–1), the examiner will feel the dislocated hip
reduce as the flexed hip is abducted while the greater trochanter is lifted anteriorly.
A positive sign is a “clunk” that is often heard and felt as the femoral head reduces
anteriorly into the acetabulum. In the Barlow maneuver (Figure 18–1), the infant’s
thigh is flexed and adducted as the examiner applies a posteriorly directed pressure.
It is positive if the hip dislocates from this. Another diagnostic maneuver is the
Galeazzi test, which identifies a dislocated hip via a difference in knee levels when
the patient’s knees are flexed in the supine position so that the ankles touch the
buttocks. This test can be used for diagnosis in older patients, unlike the Ortolani

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

and Barlow maneuvers, which are rarely helpful after 3 months of age because of the
development of soft-tissue contractures. Other physical exam findings consistent
with DDH include asymmetric or limited abduction of the dysplastic hip (approximately < 70 degrees from the midline), asymmetric thigh folds and buttock creases,
and leg length discrepancies in which the shorter leg is indicative of dysplasia. Once
a child can walk, a Trendelenburg gait may be observed, as may a leg length discrepancy with asymmetric toe-walking on the affected side. A waddling, wide-based
limp may suggest bilaterally dislocated hips.
Radiography and ultrasonography are used for confirming the diagnosis. In the
newborn, ultrasound is very sensitive and provides a dynamic view of the cartilaginous femoral head and acetabulum. However, it should be used only after 4 to
6 weeks of age because of the initial hip laxity associated with birth and concern
for overdiagnosis. Furthermore, imaging should only be used on infants with a risk
factor or physical findings concerning for DDH. Universal screening of newborns
with ultrasound is not cost effective and would also lead to overdiagnosis. Plain
radiographs cannot distinguish the cartilaginous components of the hip joint and
should therefore only be performed when children are at least 4 to 6 months old,
which is when the ossific nucleus of the femoral head can be seen on radiographs
(it appears on ultrasonographic images at 12 weeks). Several lines and angles can
be drawn on AP pelvic radiographs to identify DDH (Figure 18–2).

is the angle between Hilgenreiner line and a line joining the acetabular center (triradiate) with the

angle between Perkins line and a line joining the lateral edge of the acetabulum with the center of
the femoral head. It is a measure of lateral subluxation that becomes smaller as the hip subluxates
laterally. Normal is 20 degrees or greater. (Reproduced, with permission, from Skinner HB. Current

176

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

TREATMENT
The goal of treatment for DDH is to reestablish a concentric relationship between
the femoral head and acetabulum. It must begin as soon as the diagnosis is made to
decrease the risk of aseptic necrosis and permanent dysplastic changes and depends
on the patient’s age. From 0 to 6 months of age, treatment involves splinting
the hips in flexion and abduction, which is achieved with a Pavlik harness
(Figure 18–3). In this position, a dislocated hip may spontaneously reduce over
several weeks. The harness is used for 6 to 8 weeks or until normal hip anatomy
develops. If concentric reduction is not achieved after 2 to 4 weeks, other treatment
should be administered, such as closed reduction with spica casting. Closed reduction under general anesthesia with spica cast application is a treatment option for
ages 6 to 18 months, as the infants are too large and strong to be controlled by a
Pavlik harness. An arthrogram is used during this procedure to confirm a concentric
reduction before cast application. The spica cast typically remains on for 12 weeks.
If unable to obtain a concentric reduction at this time, open reduction techniques
may be necessary. After 18 months of age, the femoral head and acetabulum will
have developed abnormally, and open reduction is required to maintain reduction.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

177

When DDH is untreated after 2 years of age, bony procedures involving either
the acetabulum (ie, Salter, Pemberton, and Dega osteotomies), femur (ie, femoral
varus derotational osteotomy), or both are required and attempt to create an environment conducive to remodeling to a more normal joint.

Complications
Ischemic necrosis is the most severe complication of DDH and can occur despite
treatment. It results from compression of the vasculature supplying the capital
femoral epiphysis and extreme direct pressure on the femoral head. Increased
rates of ischemic necrosis are seen with forceful or excessive abduction, repeat
surgery, and multiple attempts at closed reduction. Diagnosis is made based on
radiographic findings, including the failure of the ossific nucleus of the femoral
head to develop within 1 year after reduction, broadening of the femoral neck
1 year after reduction, and an increased density and fragmentation of an ossified
femoral head.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
18.1 A 15-month-old girl presents to your office for evaluation of her right hip.
Which of the following is most associated with a diagnosis of developmental
hip dysplasia?
A. Negative Barlow maneuver

D. Increased hip abduction
18.2 Which of the following is associated with developmental dysplasia of the

dysplasia of the right hip is treated in a Pavlik harness with the hips flexed
to 90 degrees and abduction of 50 degrees. An AP radiograph of the pelvis at
4-week follow-up shows that the hip remains dislocated. What is your next
step in management?
A. Continue treatment as is; the hip should reduce within the next
2 weeks
B. Closed reduction with hip arthrogram and hip spica casting
C. Open reduction with femoral shortening osteotomy
D. Open reduction with pelvic acetabular osteotomy

178

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

ANSWERS
18.1 B. There are many maneuvers used to diagnose DDH, including the Ortolani
and Barlow tests. However, they are rarely helpful after 3 months of age because
of the development of soft-tissue contractures. Therefore, in older children one
must rely on other exam findings. This includes asymmetric and limited hip
abduction on the affected side.
18.2 D. Polydactyly is not associated with DDH. However, being the firstborn,
female, and/or breech at birth are.
18.3 B. A 6-month-old infant who has failed treatment of DDH with a Pavlik
harness after 2 to 4 weeks should be treated with closed reduction of the hip
and spica casting. Continued treatment with the harness may lead to posterior
acetabular erosion, a severe and devastating consequence. Both femoral and
pelvic osteotomies are unnecessary in this patient and are often reserved for
those 2 years of age and older with untreated DDH.

CLINICAL PEARLS


DDH is considered a multifactorial trait and is more common in females
(females comprise ~80% of cases), firstborn infants, and those born in
the breech position.



The risk for DDH is increased 12-fold if a first-degree relative has it.



Diagnosis involves several exam maneuvers, including the Ortolani,
Barlow, and Galeazzi tests.



Plain radiographs cannot distinguish the cartilaginous components of the
hip joint and should therefore only be performed when children are at least
4 to 6 months old, which is when the ossific nucleus of the femoral head can
be seen on radiographs (it appears on ultrasonographic images at 12 weeks).



The goal of treatment for DDH is to reestablish a concentric relationship
between the femoral head and acetabulum.



Treatment is age-dependent and includes use of a Pavlik harness when
patients are < 6 months old, closed reduction and spica casting when
patients are 6 to 18 months old, and open reduction when patients are
> 18 months of age. After 24 months of age, reconstructive osteotomies
involving the femur and/or acetabulum are often required.



Ischemic necrosis is the most severe complication of DDH and can occur
despite treatment.

CASE 19
A 56-year-old obese man presents to the emergency department for a 2-day history of progressive pain, swelling, and inability to bear weight on his right knee.
The patient denies a history of recent trauma, prior knee surgery, sick contacts,
or similar symptoms in the past. The patient states he has had fevers and chills
over this time. His past medical history is notable for poorly controlled non–
insulin-dependent diabetes and alcohol abuse. He is febrile with a temperature of
102.7°F and has an elevated heart rate of 110 beats/minute. His blood pressure is
160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate is 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation is 100%
on room air. Examination of the knee demonstrates a swollen, erythematous, and
diffusely tender right knee that is warm to palpation with painful and limited passive range of motion. Radiographs of the knee are negative for an acute fracture
or dislocation but do show an effusion. The patient’s laboratory values include a
white blood cell (WBC) count of 19,100 cells/μL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) of 48 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 20 mg/L. Blood cultures are
pending.

ANSWERS TO CASE 19:
Septic Knee
Summary: A 56-year-old man with medical history significant for obesity, diabetes,
and alcohol abuse presents to the emergency department febrile and tachycardic
with a 2-day history of right knee pain, swelling, and an inability to bear weight. He
denies any trauma or previous right knee surgery. Radiographs show an effusion but
no fracture or dislocation of his right knee. Additionally, his WBC, ESR, and CRP
are all elevated. Blood cultures are pending.
• Most likely diagnosis: Septic arthritis. However, the differential diagnosis also
includes crystalline arthropathies (ie, gout, pseudogout) inflammatory arthridites (ie, rheumatoid, psoriatic, and reactive arthritis), tumor, occult fracture,
Lyme disease, and osteoarthritis.
• Next diagnostic step: Obtaining joint fluid aspirate for analysis, including a cell
count with differential, Gram stain, glucose level, and crystal analysis.
• Initial treatment: Intravenous antibiotic therapy (after obtaining blood cultures and joint fluid aspirate) and operative irrigation and drainage.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with the multitude of diseases and conditions that can present similar
to a septic joint.
2. Understand the appropriate workup for septic joint.
3. Know the treatment for a septic joint.

Considerations
This 56-year-old male developed a grossly swollen, erythematous, and painful right
knee with an inability to bear weight over the prior 48 hours. He is also febrile to
102.7°F and tachycardic. His laboratory values are abnormal and are representative
of an acute infectious or inflammatory process. Furthermore, the patient’s history of
poorly controlled diabetes makes him vulnerable to systemic infection. The suspicion for a septic right knee in this patient must be high. Given the history of alcohol
abuse, gout is a possibility. However, his fevers and chills again favor an infectious
cause of his knee pain and swelling. The patient has no history of inflammatory arthridities, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and this diagnosis is unlikely. A diagnosis of
Lyme disease should always be considered in the differential for septic arthritis, but
is more likely in the setting of a positive tick exposure history where the disease is
endemic. Synovial fluid aspirate from this patient’s right knee will likely be consistent with septic arthritis (Table 19–1), at which time intravenous antibiotics must
be started and operative irrigation and drainage performed.

APPROACH TO:
Septic Knee
DEFINITIONS
SEPTIC ARTHRITIS: An orthopaedic surgical emergency most commonly
caused by bacterial seeding of a joint.
OSTEOMYELITIS: An infection of bone that can cause a septic arthritis or occur
as a sequela of it.
ARTHROCENTESIS: Term describing the process by which synovial fluid is
obtained; also referred to as joint aspiration.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Septic arthritis most commonly occurs in the knee, followed in frequency by the
hip, elbow, ankle, and, least commonly, the sternoclavicular joint. It typically occurs
after bacterial seeding of the joint, but can also be caused by fungi and viruses. The 3
predominant ways by which this occurs are through direct inoculation from trauma
or surgery, contiguous spread from an adjacent osteomyelitis, or in the setting of
bacteremia, which is more likely to arise in immunocompromised and hospitalized
individuals who have recently undergone invasive procedures.
Septic arthritis causes rapid and irreversible articular hyaline cartilage destruction in the involved joint due to the release of proteolytic enzymes from the

bacteria as well as host synovial cells, chondrocytes, and inflammatory cells.
Cartilage damage occurs within 8 hours of bacterial inoculation of the joint.
Certain bacteria produce proteolytic enzymes such as collagenase, elastase, hyaluronidase, lipase, and lipoproteinase, which lead to cartilage destruction. Bacterial virulence factors also contribute to cartilage destruction. An example is
the coagulase produced by Staphylococcus aureus, the most common pathogen
responsible for bacterial septic arthritis (Table 19–2). It is believed that the coagulase impairs intracapsular vascular supply due to small vessel thrombosis. The
subsequent increased intracapsular pressure impedes an effective host immune
response.

Clinical Presentation and Workup
Most patient’s with septic arthritis present with a relatively acute onset of a hot,
swollen, and tender joint with restricted and limited range of motion and weightbearing. Systemic signs, such as fevers and chills, may also be present. In patients
with concurrent bacteremia, they may appear toxic.
Radiographs are useful for ruling out other acute processes that can cause joint
effusions, such as fractures and dislocation. Ultrasound is useful for confirming
effusions in large joints such as the hip and for guiding aspirations. Magnetic
resonance imaging will also show joint effusions and can also detect adjacent
osteomyelitis.
Laboratory findings consistent with a septic joint include an elevated WBC with
a left shift, ESR >30 mm/hr, and a CRP >5 mg/L. Although an elevated peripheral
WBC count with increased number and percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes is indicative of infection, the absence of an elevated WBC does not rule out
infection. Both ESR and CRP are acute-phase response markers that are elevated
in the presence of infection and/or inflammation. CRP rises within a few hours of
infection, reaching values up to 400 mg/L within 36 to 50 hours. It normalizes
within 1 week after initiation of appropriate treatment. ESR rises within 2 days of
the onset of infection and continues to rise for 3 to 5 days after appropriate antibiotic

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

183

treatment is instituted. It normalizes after 3 to 4 weeks. Blood cultures should also be
obtained, as bacteremia can cause septic arthritis.
Joint fluid aspiration is the gold standard for diagnosing a septic joint and helps
guide antibiotic treatment and determine the need for operative intervention. It
should be analyzed for cell count with a differential, Gram stain, culture, glucose
level, and crystal analysis (Table 19–1).

TREATMENT AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
Only after obtaining blood cultures and a joint aspirate should broad-spectrum,
empiric antibiotic therapy commence. With organism speciation and antibiotic
sensitivities, more focused antibiotic treatment and duration can be determined.
Depending on institutional availability, consultation with infectious disease specialists often proves invaluable in assisting with the management of these oftentimes complicated clinical cases. Because of the rapid and irreversible cartilage
damage, the diagnosis of septic arthritis requires emergent operative irrigation
and drainage.
A septic joint can quickly lead to bacteremia or a systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS), particularly in the immunocompromised patient. Thus, beyond
orthopaedic evaluation and intervention, it is essential as a practitioner to recognize the signs of systemic compromise (ie, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, end
organ damage) when evaluating a patient for a septic joint.
Bacterial septic arthritis has a reported mortality of approximately 10%. Patient
outcome depends not only on the type of organism involved and the general health
of the individual, but also on the speed and decisiveness with which the diagnosis
is made.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
19.1 A 70-year-old man with a history of osteoarthritis presents to the emergency
department with a 2-day history of right knee pain and swelling. He has no
history of similar symptoms. He denies trauma, fever, or pain in any other
joints. On examination, he is afebrile. The right knee is swollen, erythematous, and painful with passive range of motion. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. An arthrocentesis is performed, which shows purulent
fluid and a leukocyte count of 90,000/μL with 90% neutrophils. No crystals
are seen on polarized microscopy. Gram stain and culture are pending. What
is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?
A. Gout
B. Pseudogout
C. Rheumatoid arthritis
D. Septic arthritis

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

19.2 A 40-year-old intravenous drug user presents to the emergency department
with a 2-day history of right knee pain with associated swelling and erythema.
The patient is febrile with a holosystolic murmur at the right lower sternal border. Complete blood count reveals a leukocytosis. Blood and synovial
fluid cultures are sent, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are started. Synovial
fluid analysis is pending. What is the most likely pathogen causing these
symptoms?
A. Neisseria gonorrhoeae
B. Staphylococcus aureus
C. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
D. Borrelia burgdorferi
19.3 A 50-year-old woman diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis many years ago
presents to your clinic with acute on chronic left knee pain. Her knee pain
has been well controlled with anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy. She denies
recent trauma, fevers, or rash. She is afebrile, and examination of the knee
reveals swelling and pain with passive range of motion. What is the next most
appropriate step in managing this patient’s symptoms?
A. Intraarticular steroidal injection
B. Add methotrexate
C. Add nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
D. Arthrocentesis

ANSWERS
19.1 D. Although the patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with a septic
joint, one must consider other causes of a joint effusion in the early stages of
the workup. However, the arthrocentesis, which yielded gross pus, makes a
septic knee the most likely of the answer choices.
19.2 B. Gram-positive bacteria remain the most common cause of septic arthritis. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for the majority of culture-positive septic
arthritis, especially within certain patient subgroups such as hemodialysis
patients and intravenous drug abusers. The predominance of S. aureus in
septic arthritis has remained unchanged for many years.
19.3 D. The most appropriate next step would be arthrocentesis to rule out a joint
infection. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have consistently accounted
for a high percentage of patients with septic arthritis. These patients may
be predisposed to septic arthritis because of poor clearance of bacteria from
abnormal joints or because of phagocytic defects acquired secondary to drugs
or disease.

CASE 20
A 62-year-old female is referred to your office for a 3-week history of right foot
pain. The patient denies recent trauma to the area, but states she had her second
toe amputated by her podiatrist 6 months ago, secondary to an infection she contracted “from a pebble in [her] shoe.” Although her foot had healed, she has begun
experiencing a recurrence of pain in this area, despite a change in footwear and
diligent monitoring of her feet for ulcers. She admits to mild fevers over the past
10 days, but denies other symptoms. On further history, the patient has type 2
diabetes mellitus. She admits that she stopped seeing her primary care physician
last year since he started prescribing “painful insulin shots” for her. On physical
exam, erythema is noted at the plantar-medial aspect of her right forefoot. This
region is warm to the touch, mildly edematous, and firm, but without any obvious fluctuance or drainage. She has chronic neuropathies in her toes and feet,
bilaterally. Recent laboratory results from her primary care provider’s office are
remarkable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.4 thousand/μL, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) of 55 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 65 mg/L.
An anteroposterior (AP) x-ray and a T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) of the right foot are shown in Figures 20–1 and 20–2.

ANSWERS TO CASE 20:
Osteomyelitis
Summary: A 62-year-old woman with uncontrolled diabetes and peripheral neuropathy presents with atraumatic, insidious right foot pain, 3 weeks in duration. She
has mild systemic symptoms (fever) and has experienced similar symptoms in the
past for which she underwent an amputation of her second toe.
• Radiologic findings: This AP radiograph of the right foot shows chronic bone
and soft tissue loss in the second ray, consistent with the patient’s history of
osteomyelitis and toe amputation. There is significant soft tissue swelling over
the head of the first metatarsal and base of the great toe. There is also significant
bony erosion in this region, with a loss of normal cortical bone, periosteal elevation, and lytic changes consistent with osteomyelitis. On T2-weighted MRI,
the head and distal shaft of the first metatarsal are hyper-resonant, consistent
with edema and inflammation in the region. There is also adjacent hyperintensity of the soft tissues medial to the great toe, consistent with soft tissue inflammation and possibly an abscess collection.
• Most likely diagnosis: Osteomyelitis of the first ray.
• Predisposing factors: Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral
neuropathy, and history of previous osteomyelitis.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis and recognize its clinical and
radiographic presentation.
2. Be familiar with the differential diagnoses for, and diagnostic workup of,
osteomyelitis.
3. Be familiar with basic treatment options for osteomyelitis, both operative and
nonoperative.

Considerations
This patient presents with a soft tissue infection that has progressed to involve
the underlying metatarsal bone. She has a history of uncontrolled diabetes and
neuropathy. As a risk factor for osteomyelitis, neuropathies predispose patients
to microtrauma because the body’s pain-protective response to skin-damaging
repetitive wear is lost. Previously, this patient’s neuropathy left her susceptible
to skin ulceration from a pebble in her shoe, which wore through the protective dermal barrier and introduced bacteria into the soft tissues overlying the
second metatarsal. Poorly controlled diabetes impedes the body’s wound healing and infection-fighting capabilities, rendering diabetics susceptible to bacterial colonization, particularly in their feet. Radiographic studies should be used

190

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

to further investigate and diagnose osteomyelitis: plain radiographs, computed
tomography (CT) scans, MRI, WBC scans, and/or bone scans are used to make the
diagnosis. In this patient’s case, plain x-rays clearly show erosive bony changes in
the first ray, while T2-weighted MRI shows edematous changes in the bone and
surrounding soft tissues consistent with osteomyelitis. This patient has an elevated
ESR and CRP, which are elevated in more than 90% of cases of osteomyelitis. An
elevated WBC count, although positive in many types of infections and inflammatory states, is only positive in approximately 40% of cases.
Once the diagnosis is made, the patient should be admitted to the hospital and
intravenous antibiotic therapy should commence. If deep tissue or bone biopsy
can be easily obtained, and if the patient remains stable, antibiotic therapy may be
delayed until biopsies or aspirations are acquired. This is especially true in patients
for whom osteomyelitis represents one in several possible diagnoses or when
osteomyelitis is occurring in particularly difficult to debride regions such as
vertebral bodies. Biopsy before antibiotic administration optimizes the chance that
an adequate sample of bacteria will be acquired for culture and that an appropriate,
targeted antibiotic agent may be selected. Unstable patients with evidence of sepsis,
however, should receive prompt systemic antibiotic treatment, regardless of whether
biopsy can be performed. An additional caveat involves the culturing of superficial
tissues, as these cultures tend to grow out benign, typical skin flora, which sometimes leads to the unnecessary and misdirected treatment.
For this patient, with extensive involvement of deep tissues, surgical drainage
and debridement should be performed. Amputation may also be considered. Intravenous antibiotic therapy typically continues for 4 to 6 weeks, with infectious disease consultation useful for assistance with antibiotic selection and management.

APPROACH TO:
Osteomyelitis
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE OSTEOMYELITIS: Presence of bacteria or infectious pathogens in bone
or bone marrow without the chronic histologic changes described below. Defined
in some literature as a bone infection lasting less than 6 weeks. Acute osteomyelitis
most commonly occurs in children.
CHRONIC OSTEOMYELITIS: May be defined by histologic changes such as the
presence of a sequestrum or an involucrum, or by duration of infection greater than
6 weeks. Chronic osteomyelitis is characterized by the presence of bacterial biofilm
and bacterial resistance to host defenses and antibiotic agents and often requires
surgical debridement and long-term systemic antibiotic therapy.
BIOFILM: An aggregate of microorganisms embedded within an adherent polysaccharide matrix that provides bacterial immunity to host cellular defenses and
antiobiotic agents.
SEQUESTRUM: A region of devitalized bone that serves as a nidus for continual
infection; a hallmark of chronic osteomyelitis.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

191

INVOLUCRUM: The formation of new, reactive bone around an area of septic
necrosis; another hallmark of chronic osteomyelitis.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Osteomyelitis is an infection of bone or bone marrow. This highly variable disease
may be classified as acute versus chronic, hematogenous versus contiguous, and with
or without vascular compromise (Lee and Waldvogel classification). Osteomyelitis
may also be classified by its location and extent (Cierny and Mader classification).
Osteomyelitis can result from a continuous spread of an infection from soft tissue
or joints, trauma causing direct bacterial inoculation into bone or adjacent soft
tissues, or hematogenously spread from an infection elsewhere in the body.
Patients with vascular diseases, poorly controlled diabetes, and those in states
of immunocompromise are at elevated risk for developing acute osteomyelitis.
Immunocompromised individuals are also at risk for developing chronic osteomyelitis.
Other risk factors for chronic osteomyelitis include history of intravenous drug
abuse and failure of treatment of acute osteomyelitis.
Osteomyelitis can be caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses. By a great majority, the most common causative agents are bacterial, with Staphylococcus aureus
being the most commonly identified offending organism. Other common inoculants
include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci,
enterococci, and propionibacteria. Salmonella species are commonly identified
pathogens in patients with sickle-cell anemia; however, staphylococcal species are
still most common in these patients.

Diagnosis
Osteomyelitis may present as an occult infection in patients of all ages. Its most common presentation is in patients with deep bone pain and without significant systemic
symptoms. When systemic symptoms are present, fever and chills predominate. Soft
tissues surrounding an infection may be edematous, warm, and erythematous.
Patients may present with a history of recent trauma or infection or with a history of
an invasive procedure. Osteomyelitis should be included in the differential diagnosis
of other musculoskeletal pathologies such as gout, ischemia, arthritis, neuropathy,
and degenerative disc disease in the spine. Delay in diagnosis and treatment of acute
infection may lead to chronic osteomyelitis, a relapsing and remitting indolent infection characterized by intermittent pain attacks and systemic symptoms.

Radiographic Evaluation
Plain radiographs should be obtained before more advanced imaging is considered.
On plain films, acute osteomyelitis may be identified by cortical bone destruction
with a surrounding area of periosteal elevation. Acute osteomyelitis will typically
have a lytic, or radiolucent, appearance, whereas chronic infections may be distinguished by the presence of a mixed lytic and blastic, or radio-opaque, appearance. Radiographs are not sensitive for osteomyelitis, however, as up to 30% to
40% of bone destruction must occur before osteomyelitic changes are visible on

192

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

plain x-rays. Symptoms of the disease typically are present before x-ray changes are
apparent.
MRI with intravenous (IV) gadolinium contrast is far more sensitive for diagnosing
osteomyelitis. MRI offers a clear view of soft tissue pathology and is currently the gold
standard in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Be wary that in the presence of metallic
implants, the sensitive/specificity of MRI is decreased; in such situations, IV contrast
CT scans may be helpful in elucidating bony pathology.
Finally, radioisotope tagged WBC scans are very specific for osteomyelitis and
are often used to follow treatment progression. Bone scans may be used in a similar
fashion, but are less specific.

TREATMENT
Acute osteomyelitis, typically presenting in children and IV drug abusers with
erythematous and painful limbs, requires prompt antibiotic therapy, often 4 to
6 weeks’ duration. Such patients may not require surgical debridement, but should
be followed closely to ensure successful therapy.
Chronic osteomyelitis also requires long-term IV drug therapy, but typically
requires additional open surgical procedures to debride necrotic tissue, drain
abscesses, and remove sequestra or nonviable bone serving as nidi for bacteria.
In chronic osteomyelitis, IV antibiotic is typically administered for 4 to 6 weeks
and may be administered in an outpatient setting once a patient has been stabilized. In patients with extensive disease or immunocompromised states, longer
courses of IV drug therapy may be indicated. Initial antibiotic coverage should be
broad, with tailored antibiotic selection once, and only if, reliable bacterial cultures and drug sensitivities are available. Initial antibiotic selection must cover S.
aureus, the most commonly identified pathogen in osteomyelitis. In patients with
a history of recent hospitalization, initial therapy must cover methicillin-resistant
S. aureus, a prevalent nosocomial infection. Serial CRP and ESR studies, although
not especially specific for osteomyelitis, are sometimes followed as markers for successful treatment.
In addition to a thorough surgical debridement, several adjunctive surgical
treatments may be indicated, including the placement of antibiotic-eluting polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) beads. PMMA, the same bone “cement” used in
the implantation of joint prostheses, may be mixed with antibiotic agents such
as gentamycin, molded into round beads or fashioned into an antibiotic spacer,
and placed into the debrided cavity. After resolution of infection, the beads are
typically removed.
The placement of orthopaedic implants such as screws, plates, rods, and prostheses pose a special challenge to the orthopaedist, as artificial implants may serve as a
nidus for chronic infection. In such cases, the surgeon must weight the benefits of
removing infected hardware with the risks of losing stability or function. As a general rule, infected hardware should be removed when possible.

Outcomes and Complications
Musculoskeletal infection that has been treated with antibiotics and surgical debridement can lead to functional deficit in the given extremity. This is dependent on the

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

193

amount of tissue debrided and if vital structures have been violated and destabilized.
When this occurs, it is usually in an attempt to perform a limb-salvage procedure,
as both patients and surgeons try to avoid amputation if at all possible. However, in
the setting of severe and recurrent musculoskeletal infections, amputation may be
the only means by which to permanently eradicate the infection.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
20.1 A 34-year-old, HIV-positive male presents to the emergency department (ED)
with complaints of several weeks of neck pain. The patient admits to using
recreational drugs, but does not willingly discuss what substances he uses. He
has recently begun feeling numbness in his bilateral hands and states he is
now unable to properly write with a pen. On exam, he has point tenderness
along the lateral aspect of his neck. An MRI is obtained, showing edema and
prevertebral swelling in his C3 and C4 vertebrae. There is T2-weighted hyperresonance of the C3-4 disc space, with swelling posterior to C3 that is impinging on the cord. What is the best treatment for this patient?
A. Inform the patient that he should follow up as an outpatient for further
workup.
B. Physical therapy and warm compresses, as the patient has no symptoms
of myelopathy.
C. Admit to the hospital promptly for antibiotic therapy and evaluation for
surgical intervention.
D. Bone scan and CT scanning of the chest abdomen and pelvis to evaluate
for other lesions.
E. Biopsies to classify the lesions and determine their source.
20.2 A 44-year-old truck driver is almost 1 year in recovery from knife wound to his
left distal thigh after an altercation at a local bar. He had initially been treated
with debridement in the ED and wound closure and was treated with a short
course of oral antibiotics. He was neurovascularly intact after the injury. He
presents now to your clinic with serous drainage through a sinus tract on the
medial aspect of his distal thigh. The area is erythematous and edematous and
is mildly tender to palpation. He has been able to bear weight on it, but states
that it is causing increasing discomfort while trying to drive his truck. Plain
radiograph films are obtained and are equivocal. An MRI is also obtained
and shows a region of hyperintensity in the metaphysis of the distal left femur
surrounding an area of hypointense bone. What is the best treatment for this
patient?
A. Long (14-day) course of oral antibiotics with close follow-up
B. Needle biopsy and targeted oral antibiotics
C. CT scan of the affected extremity
D. Needle biopsy and IV antibiotics
E. Surgical debridement and IV antibiotics

20.3 A 12-year-old African American male with a history of sickle cell disease
is admitted to the hospital with severe left upper extremity pain and fevers.
Blood cultures are obtained, and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics and fluid
resuscitation are initiated. What is the most likely causative organism in
this patient?
A. Viral infection
B. Salmonella
C. Streptococcus species
D. Staphylococcus aureus
E. Escherichia coli

ANSWERS
20.1 C. This patient has osteomyelitis of the cervical spine with discitis at
C3-4, and evidence of epidural abscess. Given the patient’s myelopathic
state, the patient should be admitted immediately to the hospital and IV
antibiotic therapy should begin promptly, ideally after a biopsy is obtained.
If symptoms do not remit on broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, or if
myelopathy worsens, prompt surgical evacuation of the abscess should be
performed.
20.2 E. This patient has history and radiographic findings consistent with a chronic
osteomyelitis. The region of bone involved on MRI is consistent with a
sequestrum that must be surgically debrided. After culture, broad-spectrum
IV antibiotics should be initiated and targeted according to susceptibility
testing of the cultures. Although needle biopsy may help target the appropriate organism, it is insufficient to effectively eradicate the infection. Similarly
antibiotics alone, whether oral or broad-spectrum IV, are insufficient without
a thorough surgical debridement.
20.3 D. Although Salmonella species are commonly associated with sickle cell
patients with osteomyelitis, the most common causative agent is actually
S. aureus. Escherichia coli and streptococcal species infections also occur in
these populations; however, they are less common. Viral osteomyelitis is
exceedingly rare.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Osteomyelitis is sometimes referred to as the “great imitator” because it
can radiographically mimic almost any neoplastic or inflammatory process.



Osteomyelitis must destroy 30% to 40% of a given region of bone before
it is evident on plain x-ray.



Elevated WBC counts are found in only 40% of patients presenting
with chronic osteomyelitis; elevated CRP and ESR are found in approximately 90%.



Acute osteomyelitis usually requires prolonged IV antibiotic therapy.
Chronic osteomyelitis generally requires surgical debridement as well as
prolonged antibiotics.

CASE 21
An otherwise healthy, right-hand-dominant, 25-year-old man is seen in the emergency department after slipping on the front steps of his house 2 days ago.
He states that he landed on an outstretched right upper extremity and immediately
began experiencing shoulder pain. He has been unable to move his shoulder since
the fall and has had his arm in a sling that a friend gave him. On physical exam,
you note no ecchymosis, abrasions, or any other deformity. However, shoulder
range of motion, especially internal rotation, is significantly limited. Anteroposterior,
axillary, and scapular-Y radiographs of his right shoulder reveal no abnormalities.
The patient is most concerned about his ability to return to his competitive tennis
league by next week, as he is playing for the club championship.

ANSWERS TO CASE 21:
Rotator Cuff Injury
Summary: An otherwise healthy and active 25-year-old man slips and lands on his
right shoulder. He is unable to raise his arm and has limited active range of motion.
Neurovascular examination is normal. Radiographs are negative for a fracture and
dislocation.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute tear of the rotator cuff.
• Imaging studies of choice: Plain radiographs must always be obtained first in
the setting of acute trauma to the shoulder, as has been done here. When rotator
cuff tear (RCT) is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should also be
performed. It is extremely accurate (93%-100%) in detecting full-thickness tears
and can evaluate tear size, tendon retraction, muscle atrophy, and related intraarticular pathology. However, it cannot be used in patients with pacemakers,
aneurysm clips, metal in the eye, or other metal implants within the body.
• Treatment: The appropriate treatment for an acute, full-thickness RCT in an
otherwise healthy and physically active young patient is primary repair.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand rotator cuff anatomy.
2. Properly diagnose a rotator cuff tear.
3. Be familiar with treatment options for rotator cuff tears.

Considerations
This 45-year-old man sustained an injury to his right shoulder after slipping on his
front steps. He presents with pain and weakness of the right shoulder in the setting
of normal radiographs. This constellation of findings is concerning for an acute RCT.
A complete history and physical exam of the neck and involved extremity must
be done. Although active range of motion is typically decreased because of pain and/or
weakness, passive range of motion is expected to be normal. Shoulder strength in
elevation, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation should be assessed,
and specific provocative maneuvers can be performed to evaluate the individual
muscles of the rotator cuff (Table 21–1, Figure 21–1).
An MRI, which is the gold standard for diagnosis of RCTs, should be obtained
(Figure 21–2). However, if a contraindication to MRI exists, an arthrogram or ultrasound can be done. MRI in this patient will confirm an RCT. Given the patient’s
described mechanism of a hyperabduction/external rotation injury during a fall, he
has likely torn his subscapularis tendon.
Although nonoperative management is appropriate for some people, this patient
will benefit from a rotator cuff repair, as he is young and active.

Table 21–1 • PROVOCATIVE MANEUVERS USED TO EVALUATE SPECIFIC
MUSCLES OF THE ROTATOR CUFF
Lift-off test (subscapularis)

The patient’s arm is internally rotated with the elbow
flexed to 90 degrees and hand held posteriorly at
the waist with the palm facing out. The patient then
attempts to move his arm away from his body against
pressure from the examiner. The test is positive if
the patient experiences pain or weakness during this
maneuver.

Empty can test (supraspinatus)

The patient’s arm should be held in 90 degrees of
elevation in the plane of the scapula, with the elbow
extended, upper extremity internally rotated, and
the forearm pronated. This results in the patient’s
upper extremity in a thumbs-down position, as if he
were emptying a can. In this position, the examiner
stabilizes the shoulder while applying a downward
directed force on the arm. The patient will try to resist
this force. The test is positive if the patient experiences
pain or weakness with resistance (Figure 21–1).

Infraspinatus test

The patient stands with his arm at the side with the
elbow at 90 degrees and the arm internally rotated to
45 degrees. The examiner applies a medial rotation
force that the patient resists. Pain or the inability to
resist further internal rotation indicates a positive test
for infraspinatus pathology.

APPROACH TO:
Rotator Cuff Tears
DEFINITIONS
ROTATOR CUFF: A confluence of 4 muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres
minor, and subscapularis) that arise from the scapula and insert on the humeral
head. The main functions of the rotator cuff are to stabilize the glenohumeral joint
and to rotate the humerus outward.
ROTATOR CUFF TEAR: A common cause of shoulder pain that can involve an
individual tendon or a combination of tendons. The supraspinatus is the most commonly torn rotator cuff tendon.
ROTATOR CUFF ARTHROPATHY: A condition of the shoulder in which glenohumeral arthritis develops secondary to a chronic, irreparable rotator cuff tear.
It is typically seen in older individuals with loss of shoulder motion and strength.
SUBACROMIAL IMPINGEMENT: Term used to describe the process and continuum by which rotator cuff tendons become irritated and inflamed as they pass
through the subacromial space. This is secondary to impingement of the humeral
head and rotator cuff beneath the coracoacromial (CA) arch of the shoulder. With
the arm in neutral position, the greater tuberosity (where the supraspinatus inserts)
lies anterior to the CA arch. With forward flexion and internal rotation, the subacromial bursa and supraspinatus tendon become entrapped between the anterior
acromion/coracoid and greater tuberosity.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Shoulder Anatomy and Biomechanics
The shoulder complex is comprised of the glenohumeral (GH), sternoclavicular (SC),
acromioclavicular (AC), and scapulothoracic (ST) joints (Figures 21–3 and 21–4).
There is a 2:1 ratio of shoulder motion between the GH and ST joints (ie, 180
degrees of abduction consists of 120 degrees of GH motion and 60 degrees of ST
motion). Both static stabilizers (ie, bony structures, labrum, joint capsule, ligaments)
and dynamic stabilizers (ie, rotator cuff, periscapular muscles) help in maintaining

congruity and providing GH joint stability. Static stabilizers can function in the
setting of intrinsic muscle damage and neuromuscular injury, whereas the dynamic
stabilizers cannot. Table 21–2 outlines the muscles vital to shoulder function.
The rotator cuff helps to maintain a stable fulcrum for shoulder motion via its
role as a dynamic stabilizer of the glenohumeral joint. The cuff balances the force
couples in the coronal and transverse planes. In the coronal plane, the inferior
rotator cuff (infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis) balances the support moment
created by the deltoid. In the transverse plane, the anterior cuff (subscapularis)
functions to balance the moment created by the posterior cuff (infraspinatus and
teres minor).

Etiology
The incidence of RCTs ranges from 5% to 40% and increases with age. Of note,
55% of asymptomatic patients ≥ 60 years of age will have rotator cuff pathology

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

203

evident on MRI. RCTs should be thought of as part of a continuum of disease
involving the shoulder. The continuum includes subacromial impingement, subcoracoid impingement, calcific tendonitis, rotator cuff tears, and rotator cuff arthropathy.
Tears can be acute, iatrogenic, or secondary to chronic degenerative changes.
Acute avulsion injuries include subscapularis tears in younger patients after a fall
and supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and/or teres minor tears in those older than 40
years after a shoulder dislocation. Overhead throwing athletes are susceptible to
cuff tears secondary to the high tensile forces that the rotator cuff is subjected to
during the deceleration phase of throwing. Iatrogenic injuries are commonly seen
after repair failure of the subscapularis tendon after an open anterior shoulder surgery. Chronic degenerative tears are seen in older patients and typically involve the
supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and/or teres minor.

Presentation and Diagnosis
Patients with RCT present either after an acute trauma and inability to move
the arm and shoulder (ie, shoulder dislocation or fall) or with the insidious onset
of symptoms such as night pain and difficulty performing overhead activites.
Physical examination of the shoulder should begin with inspection of the skin
for scars, atrophy, swelling, droop, and scapular winging. Palpation of the bony
prominences and muscles of the shoulder girdle should be done next. The patient
should then be placed supine, at which time active and passive range of motion
of both shoulders is assessed. Planes of motion to be evaluated include forward
elevation (150-180 degrees is considered normal), abduction, internal rotation
to vertebral height (T4-8 is considered normal), internal rotation at 90 degrees
of abduction, external rotation at side, and external rotation at 90 degrees of
abduction. A neurovascular exam of the entire upper extremity should also be
done, as should the specific tests that isolate the individual muscles of the rotator
cuff (Table 21–1).
Imaging studies are ordered based on the findings from the history and physical
exam, with plain radiographs the first ones obtained. Findings on plain x-ray
associated with rotator cuff pathology include calcific tendonitis, proximal
migration of the humerus (seen with chronic RCT), or a hooked acromion.
MRI, when obtained, evaluates muscle quality and the tear size, tear shape,
and degree of tendon retraction. Other findings on MRI consistent with RCT
include muscle atrophy, medial biceps tendon subluxation (indicative of a subscapularis tear), and cysts in the humeral head (seen in the majority of patients
with a chronic RCT).

Classification
Classification of cuff tears can be done based on anatomical location, tear size,
amount of cuff atrophy, tear shape, thickness, and chronicity. Partial-thickness
tears often appear as fraying of an intact tendon, whereas full-thickness tears are
through-and-through. These can be small pin-point defects, large buttonhole tears
(the tendon still remains attached to the humeral head and thus retains function),
or tears in which the tendon is completely detached from the humeral head. When
classified by chronicity, they can be described as acute (due to a sudden, powerful

204

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

movement or trauma), subacute, or chronic (develops over a longer period of time,
seen in individuals who frequently participate in overhead activities).

TREATMENT
Rotator cuff tears can be managed via both operative and nonoperative means.
The patient’s age, activity level, overall health, cuff status (ie, size and age of tear,
amount of retraction, muscle quality), and presence of GH arthritis must be considered when determining the best treatment for a given patient. In general, young,
active patients presenting with an acute tear and a primary complaint of weakness
are best treated with early surgical repair, whereas older patients complaining of
pain in the setting of chronic, degenerative tears are most responsive to nonoperative treatment.
Nonoperative treatment includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
(NSAIDs), activity modifications, subacromial corticosteroid injections, and
physical therapy. Corticosteroid injections into the subacromial space are done with
failure of other conservative modalities for greater than 4 to 6 weeks. The goal of
these injections is to decrease pain. They may be repeated after several months if
initially effective. However, the patient should receive no more than 3 injections
per year. Physical therapy focuses on aggressive rotator cuff and periscapular muscle
strengthening.
Operative repair of an RCT can be done through either open or arthroscopic
approaches, which have been shown to have equivalent results. With both techniques, the goal is to restore the native tendon(s) insertional footprint area on the
tuberosities. It is thought that a larger, more anatomic footprint improves healing
and the mechanical strength of the repair. Biologic healing of the cuff is estimated
to take approximately 8 to 12 weeks; this is the rate-limiting step for recovery. Anatomic footprint restoration is often achieved with double-row suture techniques. Of
note, animal models have failed to show increased repair strength with the addition
of a trough in the greater tuberosity.
Complications after rotator cuff repair include recurrence, deltoid detachment
(with open procedures), acromiclavicular joint pain, axillary nerve injury, and
suprascapular nerve injury. Worker’s compensation patients report worse outcomes with higher postoperative disability and lower satisfaction.
There are several procedures that may be performed at the time of rotator cuff
repair or as independent operations before repair. Subacromial decompression is
done if impingement is thought to have contributed to tendon irritation and
tearing. AC joint resection is performed via distal clavicle excision in patients whose
AC joint is tender to palpation and painful. A long head of the biceps tenotomy
(detachment of the tendon origin from the labrum or glenoid) or tenodesis (releasing of
the tendon origin and suturing it to the proximal humerus) is done in patients with
a symptomatic biceps tendon.
Irreparable and massive rotator cuff tears require special consideration. In patients
with this but an otherwise normal GH joint, tendon transfer can be performed with
the goal of restoring overhead function. For irreparable or chronic subscapularis tears,
pectoralis major transfer is performed. For large tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, a latissimus dorsi transfer is performed. In this procedure, the latissimus

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

205

is attached to the cuff muscles, subscapularis, and greater tuberosity. The given
extremity is then immobilized in a brace for 6 weeks in 45 degrees of abduction and
30 degrees of external rotation. Of note, the best candidate for a latissimus dorsi
transfer is a young laborer.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
21.1 A 45-year-old man has a fall from his motorcycle and is complaining of shoulder pain. Radiographs are negative for fracture and dislocation. On exam, you
note a positive lift-off test. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Teres minor tear
B. Supraspinatus tear
C. Infraspinatus tear
D. Subscapularis tear
21.2 An 80-year-old man sustained an anterior shoulder dislocation 2 weeks ago.
He was reduced in the emergency department acutely and has been treated
in a sling by his primary care physician. Radiographs after reduction appear
normal. He now presents with severe pain and weakness of his shoulder. What
is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Continued anterior subluxation of the humerus
B. Rotator cuff tear
C. Cervical spine radiculopathy
D. Proximal humerus fracture
21.3 A 65-year-old woman presents to the clinic complaining of worsening pain in
her left shoulder that is most severe at night. She is an avid swimmer and states
that she has been unable to swim for the last 3 weeks because of the pain. She
denies any recent trauma and has brought plain radiographs of her shoulder in
3 views (ordered by her internist) with her, which are negative. You suspect a
torn rotator cuff and order an MRI. However, the patient tells you that she cannot have one, due to her pacemaker. Which of the following imaging modalities is the most appropriate for this patient?
A. Ultrasound
B. PET scan
C. Arthrogram
D. Additional plain radiographs

ANSWERS
21.1 D. A positive lift-off test is consistent with a subscapularis injury. In this maneuver, the patient’s arm is internally rotated, the elbow flexed to 90 degrees, and hand
held posteriorly at the waist. If the patient experiences pain or weakness as he
tries to move his arm away from his body against resistance, the test is positive.

206

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

21.2 B. Forty percent of patients older than 60 years with a shoulder dislocation
will have a concomitant RCT. However, it is also important to recognize that
even in the absence of trauma, RCT is very common in older individuals.
Sixty-five percent of patients older than 70 years have a full-thickness RCT.
21.3 C. Arthrograms are used when MRI is contraindicated. They improve sensitivity
and specificity in the diagnosis of an RCT. It is a fluoroscopic examination
of the shoulder joint after the introduction of contrast media into the joint.
Extravasation of the dye from the joint would support the clinical diagnosis
of an RCT. Although ultrasound is also an alternative imaging modality in
the setting of a contraindication to an MRI, an arthrogram is a better choice.
There is no role for PET scans in the diagnosis of RCT. Additional plain radiographs will likely be of no benefit unless the originals are of poor quality.

CASE 22
An 18-year-old female athlete presents after injuring her right knee during a soccer
game. She states that she was running for a ball downfield when she planted her
right foot to cut inside a defender, heard a “pop,” and fell to the ground in pain.
She was unable to leave the field on her own power. Over the next 10 to 15 minutes,
her right knee swelled considerably compared with her left. She was placed into
a knee immobilizer by her trainer and presents to your office the day after the
injury.
On physical exam, the patient has a significant effusion and holds her knee in
approximately 10 degrees of flexion; she is unable to flex past 90 degrees. She is
uncomfortable and guarding throughout your examination. Her knee is aspirated,
and 40 mL of blood is extracted. She is more comfortable after this and her range
of motion is improved. She has no joint line tenderness. Her knee is stable to
varus and valgus stress. On Lachman exam, there is significant anterior translation compared with her left, uninjured knee without a firm end point. Anterior
drawer testing reveals increased tibial translation, whereas posterior drawer testing shows symmetric posterior translation.

ANSWERS TO CASE 22:
Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
Summary: An 18-year-old female soccer player presents 1 day after injuring her right
knee after a noncontact pivoting injury during a soccer game. She had immediate
pain and quickly developed an effusion. She was unable to leave the field under her
own power. Arthrocentesis produced a large hemarthrosis. She has no joint line
tenderness. Lachman and anterior drawer tests are positive. Her knee is stable to
varus and valgus stress.
• Most likely diagnosis: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture.
• Confirmatory physical finding: Positive Lachman test.
• Imaging: Knee x-rays followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
• Treatment: ACL reconstruction after regaining knee motion.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the anatomy and function of the ACL.
2. Understand the pertinent physical exam findings, differential diagnosis, and
confirmatory imaging modalities for ACL injury.
3. Be familiar with the rationale for nonoperative and operative treatment of ACL
injuries.

Considerations
This 18-year-old female athlete presents with concern for an ACL injury. The
mechanism, a noncontact pivoting injury with the foot firmly planted on the
ground, is consistent with this. The “pop” she heard, coupled with the rapid development of a joint effusion, also supports this diagnosis. In the office it is important
to obtain a reliable physical exam, which can be impeded by a hemarthrosis, as
seen in this case. Joint effusions are painful, limit both active and passive range of
motion, and complicate the practitioner’s ability to accurately perform a complete
exam of the knee. After aspiration, the patient’s range of motion improves, and
Lachman and anterior drawer tests are found to be positive. The next step in the
workup includes plain radiographs and an MRI. The ACL tear must be confirmed
and associated fractures and other injuries ruled out. After this, a treatment plan
can be established.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO:
Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction
DEFINITIONS
LACHMAN TEST: The most reliable and clinically sensitive physical exam
test for detecting an ACL tear. To perform the test, place the patient supine on
the exam table with the knee in approximately 30 degrees flexion. The examiner
should place one hand behind the tibia with the thumb on the tibial tuberosity.
The other hand is placed on the patient’s thigh. As the tibia is pulled anteriorly,
an intact ACL should prevent forward translation on the femur. When the ACL is
intact, a firm end point is observed. Findings consistent with a positive Lachman
test include anterior tibial translation with a soft end point, more than 2 mm of
anterior translation compared with the contralateral knee, and greater than 10 mm
of total anterior translation.
ANTERIOR DRAWER TEST: Test performed to evaluate for ACL injury. The
patient is placed supine with the hip flexed to 45 degrees and the knee to 90 degrees.
The examiner should sit on the patient’s feet and grasp the tibia, pulling it forward
(or backward in the posterior drawer test, which is used to diagnose posterior cruciate ligament [PCL] injury). Increased forward tibial translation and end point laxity
suggest a ruptured ACL (increased posterior translation suggests a PCL injury).
PIVOT SHIFT TEST: Test used to assess rotational stability of the knee. It is
performed by applying slight distal traction on the extended leg with a valgus and
internal rotation force then applied. In this position, the tibia will be subluxated
anteriorly in an ACL-deficient knee. The knee is then flexed to 30 degrees, at which
time the iliotibial band transitions from a knee extensor to flexor, helping to reduce
the subluxated tibia. General anesthesia is often required to perform this test in the
acute setting because of pain and guarding.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
ACL injuries are highly publicized and researched. They comprise nearly half of
all knee ligament injuries and are more common in the young, athletic population,
with 70% occurring secondary to sporting activities. Skiing and soccer have the
highest risk of ACL rupture, with female athletes being 2 to 8 times more likely to
tear their ACL than men.

Anatomy and Biomechanics
The ACL originates from the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle and travels
obliquely, inserting on the tibia in the anterior aspect of the intercondylar eminence
of the tibia (Figure 22–1). This location is adjacent to the anterior insertion of the
lateral meniscus. It is made up of 2 distinct components, the anteromedial (AM)
and posterolateral (PL) bundles, which are named for their tibial insertions. The
ligament is intraarticular but extrasynovial and receives its blood supply from the

middle geniculate artery. The ACL is approximately 33-mm long and 11 mm in
diameter. It can resist a load of approximately 2200 newtons.
The primary function of the ACL is to restrict anterior translation of the tibia
relative to the femur. Secondarily, it provides a restraint to tibial rotation and
varus or valgus stress. The AM bundle is the larger of the 2, is tighter in flexion,

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

211

and provides the majority of the restraint against anterior translation of the tibia
on the femur, particularly at mid-ranges of knee flexion. The PL bundle is more
taut in extension and plays a greater role in countering rotational forces.

Differential Diagnosis
The history given by the patient of an injury occurring during a cutting move, the
audible “popping” or tearing sensation, and large postinjury effusion represent a classic
presentation of an ACL tear. Included in the differential diagnosis are patellar
dislocation, meniscal injury, posterior cruciate ligament injury, and osteochondral
fracture. Most of these diagnoses can be confirmed with a thorough physical exam.
An arthrocentesis of the affected knee can also add information, as the presence of
fat within the fluid suggests a fracture, as opposed to a pure hemarthrosis, which is
seen in a multitude of knee injuries.

Physical Exam
Physical exam of any joint should begin with simple inspection. Range of motion
is assessed, and lack of extension can suggest a locked knee from a meniscal tear
or loose body. The joint lines are palpated for presence of pain that would suggest
meniscal injury. Varus and valgus stability is assessed at 0 degrees and 30 degrees
to confirm the integrity of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments. The ACL
is examined using the Lachman test. This is performed by attempting to translate
the proximal tibia anteriorly with respect to the distal femur with the knee held
in 30 degrees of flexion. This tests the translation of the tibia as compared with
the noninjured knee as well as evaluating for a firm end point. The anterior and
posterior drawer tests examine the ACL and PCL, respectively. The knee is flexed
to 90 degrees, and translation anteriorly (anterior drawer) of the proximal tibia
assesses the ACL, whereas posterior translation (posterior drawer) assesses the PCL.
Care must be taken to recognize any posterior sag of the tibia before performing
the anterior drawer test, as this would indicate a PCL injury and ultimately lead
to a false-positive anterior drawer. The pivot shift test is another sensitive test for
ACL rupture and assesses the secondary rotatory restraint of the ACL. In the acute
setting, this is quite painful and is most often used intraoperatively during an exam
under anesthesia.

Imaging
Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views of the knee should be the first imaging studies
obtained to rule out any associated fractures. This includes tibial eminence fractures,
which can mimic a ligamentous injury, and the “Segond fracture,” which is a lateral
capsular avulsion fracture that is considered pathognomonic for an underlying ACL
injury. Merchant, or “sunrise,” views are special views of the patella that evaluate
the bony architecture of the patellofemoral articulation for fracture or dislocation.
After initial radiographic evaluation, MRI of the injured knee is highly sensitive and specific in confirming injury to intraarticular structures (Figures 22–2A
and 22–2B). In addition to visualizing the ligaments, the MRI allows for evaluation
for chondral injuries and bone bruises, which can also be indicative of ligamentous
injury. The menisci may also be evaluated for injury with an MRI.

TREATMENT
Rationale for Treatment
ACL-deficient patients complain of their affected knees frequently “giving out.” This
recurrent instability prevents the majority of these patients from reaching their preinjury level of activity and places them at an increased risk for meniscal and chondral
injuries. The development of arthritis in ACL-deficient knees compared with those
that undergo reconstruction is controversial, as some authors have found that the
patients with ACL-reconstructed knees have more long-term degenerative changes.
Factors influencing the treatment of ACL-deficient knees include patient age,
functional demand, instability, expectations, and associated injuries. Many orthopaedic surgeons also prefer that patients regain knee range of motion before performing a reconstructive procedure. In general, patients younger than 30 years of
age should undergo surgical reconstruction, whereas those older than 30 years
of age should undergo an initial period of rehabilitation followed by reevaluation. In the latter setting, reconstruction is indicated in the presence of recurrent
instability. Repair of concurrent meniscus tears, cartilage lesions, and/or associated
ligamentous injuries often mandates ACL reconstruction, either at the same time or
as a later staged procedure, to attain good outcomes. For example, meniscus repairs
in ACL-deficient knees do not heal and therefore should be done in conjunction
with ACL reconstruction. Additionally, posterolateral corner (PLC) and posteromedial corner (PMC) injuries that are undiagnosed or untreated in the setting of an
ACL tear are common causes of ACL reconstruction failure.

Nonoperative Treatment
Nonoperative treatment of ACL injuries involves activity modification, bracing,
and physical therapy. Activities that require cutting and jumping, such as basketball
and soccer, should be replaced with straight-ahead activities, such as biking and running. Braces do not replace a native, intact ACL. However, there are specific ACL
braces that can provide symptomatic comfort. Physical therapy focuses on hamstring
strengthening and can have good functional outcomes.

ACL Reconstruction
Early efforts for the treatment of the ACL-deficient knee focused on primary repair
of the ligament. However, mid- and long-term outcomes were poor, which led to
the development of a variety of intra- and extraarticular autologous soft tissue and
synthetic augmentation procedures. These treatments were also found to have poor
long-term outcomes and increased complications. There are several theories regarding why primary repair was ineffective and pertain to the ACL’s location within the
knee joint. As an intraarticular structure, synovial fluid prevents the formation of a
fibrin blood clot that bridges the tear. The torn ends of the ligament subsequently
fibrose, and end-to-end healing does not occur.
Because primary ACL repair is ineffective, current operative treatment involves
arthroscopically assisted reconstruction in which bone tunnels are placed at the
ACL’s tibial insertion and at the femoral origin. A soft tissue autograft or allograft is
ultimately passed through these tunnels. Classically, a bone-patellar tendon-bone

214

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

autograft has been used for primary reconstructive procedures, with allograft
reserved for older patients, multi-ligamentously injured knees, and revision
cases. Although autografts are healthy, living tissue, they risk donor site morbidity.
Conversely, allografts do not cause donor site morbidity but have variable tissue
quality and carry the low risk of disease transmission (ie, hepatitis C and human
immunodeficiency virus). More recently, quadrupled hamstring autografts have
gained favor with the advancement of fixation techniques. This involves harvesting
of the distal gracilis and semitendinosus tendons at their pes anserine insertion and
doubling them over themselves to create 4 strands. This technique is inherently
stronger than a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, but its initial fixation to bone is
not as strong. Other graft options include Achilles tendon and tibialis anterior
tendon allograft. Some surgeons perform a double-bundle reconstruction, as there is
thought that this more closely simulates normal knee kinematics. However, doublebundle reconstruction is a significantly more complex procedure, and more clinical
data must be presented proving its superiority over the more classic, single-bundle
reconstruction techniques before it is deemed the standard of care.

Complications
The goal of ACL reconstruction is restoration of normal knee kinematics. However, one
of the most common complications after ACL reconstruction is loss of motion—
specifically, development of a flexion contracture. The causes of this include arthrofibrosis, cyclops lesions, improper graft tensioning and placement, and inadequate
postoperative extension bracing. A cyclops lesion is a hypertrophied remnant of the
native ACL on the tibia, which results in the inability to attain full extension and
may also cause anterior knee pain. These patients often present 4 to 6 months after
reconstruction with an inability to achieve full extension. Arthroscopy is diagnostic
and the lesion can be excised, which usually resolves the problem. Aberrant graft positioning may lead to loss of motion and early graft failure. A graft placed anteriorly to
its normal axis of rotation will make it tight in flexion and thus limit it. A graft placed
too posterior will limit terminal extension, as it becomes too tight in extension.
Other complications of ACL reconstruction include infection, graft donor site
morbidity, and the development of complex regional pain syndrome, formerly
known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy.

Postoperative Care and Rehabilitation
The goal of postoperative rehabilitation is to reduce swelling, maintain patellar
mobility to limit anterior knee pain, and regain full range of motion of the knee.
Strengthening exercises revolve around the quadriceps, which atrophy quickly after
surgery, and the hamstrings. Isometric hamstring and quadriceps contractions are
appropriate and do not place excessive stress on the graft. Closed chain exercises
(foot planted) should be emphasized. Open chain quadriceps strengthening must be
avoided, in addition to isokinetic quadriceps strengthening during early rehabilitation.
Joint motion promotes healing, and full passive extension should be allowed early in
rehabilitation. Most patients are placed in a knee brace locked in extension postoperatively and are allowed to bear weight on it as tolerated, with crutches for comfort.
In general, return to full sporting activities is not advised until at least 5 months

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

215

after surgery. Pain and swelling must have subsided, full range of motion achieved,
and quadriceps and hamstring strength close to that of the normal knee (80% and
90%, respectively). It is important to recognize that specific rehabilitation protocols
vary from surgeon to surgeon and that these are only general guidelines.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
22.1 A 22-year-old male basketball player presents with a swollen, painful left knee.
He was on a fast break and as he began to jump for an alley-oop, he felt his
knee give out and he collapsed to the floor. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Patello-femoral dislocation
B. Medial collateral ligament injury
C. Hamstring strain
D. Anterior cruciate ligament injury
E. Posterior cruciate ligament injury
22.2 A 28-year-old female professional skier presents with an exquisitely tender,
swollen right knee after a crash during a training run for the alpine downhill.
She is unable to bear weight. Knee radiographs reveal an avulsion fracture off
of the lateral tibial plateau, but are otherwise unremarkable. What is the most
likely positive physical exam finding?
A. Posterior drawer
B. Lachman test
C. McMurray test
D. Patellar apprehension
E. Exam will be unremarkable
22.3 Nonoperative rehabilitation for an ACL-deficient knee should include which
of the following?
A.
B.
C.
D.
E.

Quadriceps strengthening
Straight leg raises
Leg presses
Short distance sprints
Hamstring strengthening

22.4 Where is the primary restraint to anterior translation of the tibia at mid-ranges
of knee flexion?
A. Posteromedial bundle of the ACL
B. Posterolateral bundle of the ACL
C. Anteromedial bundle of the ACL
D. Anterolateral bundle of the ACL
E. Both bundles function identically throughout all knee ranges

216

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

ANSWERS
22.1 D. The history provided describes a noncontact injury to the knee during an
acceleration-deceleration/pivoting move with the patient experiencing a feeling of giving way in his knee. The player quickly accumulates a knee effusion
and has significant pain. These findings are characteristic descriptions of an
ACL injury. The Lachman test is diagnostic for this injury, and an MRI would
confirm the diagnosis.
22.2 B. Skiing, along with soccer, is strongly associated with ACL injury. The
patient presents after a crash with an effusion and inability to bear weight.
Knee radiographs demonstrate a lateral capsular avulsion fracture (Segond
fracture). This is pathognomonic for an ACL injury. The Lachman test, performed by translating the tibia anteriorly with the knee in 30 degrees of flexion and assessing for a firm end point, is highly sensitive for an ACL injury.
22.3 E. When treating a patient with an ACL-deficient knee nonoperatively, rehabilitation should consist of aggressive hamstring strengthening.
22.4 C. The ACL is the primary restraint to anterior translation of the tibia with
respect to the femur. It consists of 2 bundles, the anteromedial and posterolateral bundles. The anteromedial is the largest of the 2 bundles and functions as
the primary restraint to anterior translation in the mid-ranges of knee flexion.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The ACL originates from the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle
and travels obliquely, inserting on the tibia just anterior to and between
the intercondylar eminences of the tibia.



The primary role of the ACL is restraining anterior translation of the tibia
with respect to the femur. It is a secondary restraint to tibial rotation.



ACL tears are caused by noncontact pivoting injuries with the foot firmly
planted on the ground. They are commonly seen in soccer players and
skiers.



Nonoperative treatment is typically reserved for older, sedentary patients
and is based on a rehabilitation protocol encouraging aggressive hamstring
strengthening, bracing, and activity modifications.



The goal of ACL reconstruction is restoration of normal knee kinematics.



ACL reconstruction is the treatment of choice for young, active patients.

ANSWERS TO CASE 23:
Meniscal Tears
Summary: A 28-year-old healthy man who sustained a right knee twisting injury
during a pickup football game presents with right knee pain. His exam is significant
for a moderate effusion, medial joint line tenderness, positive McMurray and Apley
tests, and a stable ligamentous exam.
• Most likely diagnosis: Tear of the medial meniscus.
• Differential diagnosis: Osteoarthritis, loose body, patellar subluxation or dislocation, osteochondritis dissecans, articular cartilage lesions, tibial plateau
fractures, ligamentous injury, pes anserine bursitis, and fat pad impingement
syndrome.
• Next diagnostic step: Plain radiographs of the knee, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
• Next step in therapy: Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, with resection to a
stable, smooth rim of meniscus. Meniscal repair is also a possibility, depending
on the location of the tear.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the typical patient demographics and mechanism of injury associated with meniscal tears.
2. Be familiar with the treatment options for meniscal pathology.

Considerations
This is a 28-year-old man who presents after an injury to his right knee sustained
during a pickup football game. The history and physical exam are very typical for
meniscal pathology. This includes his twisting mechanism of injury, pain, lateonset joint effusion (versus a sudden-onset effusion, which may indicate isolated
or concomitant anterior cruciate ligament tear), and medial joint line tenderness.
Additionally, 2 meniscus-specific tests, the McMurray and Apley tests, are positive
(Figure 23–1). Although the patient’s history and examination are consistent with
an acute meniscal injury, the orthopaedist must also be familiar with patients
presenting with symptoms indicative of the more chronic “degenerative” and
“complex” meniscal tears. In the setting of a meniscal tear, radiographs and
potentially MRI should be obtained. Treatment, which consists of either operative
or more conservative measures, is patient specific, with multiple factors determining
the ideal approach.

Examination. 9th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2009:Fig. 13-24.)

APPROACH TO:
Meniscal Tears
DEFINITIONS
MENISCI (MEDIAL AND LATERAL): Fibrocartilaginous (predominantly type
I collagen) structures within the knee joint that increase contact area, distribute
load (50%-70% in extension and 85%-90% in flexion), absorb shock, and play a
role in joint stability and proprioception. Removing the entire meniscus decreases
the overall knee contact area and subsequently results in increased stress throughout
the knee, pain, and degenerative joint disease. The medial meniscus is larger and
more oblong than the lateral meniscus. It is also an important secondary stabilizer
to anterior tibial translation and is thus essential for stability in an anterior cruciate
ligament (ACL)-deficient knee.
VASCULAR ZONES: The meniscus is divided into thirds based on vascularity.
The peripheral third is the most vascularized and deemed the “red-red” zone. The
middle third, referred to as the “red-white” zone, has an intermediate vascularity.
The inner third, or the “white-white” zone, is avascular.
MCMURRAY TEST: Flexion and rotation of the knee. To test the medial meniscus, the examiner flexes the knee, places a hand on the medial or posteromedial
joint line of the knee, and then brings the knee from flexion to extension while
externally rotating the leg. To test the lateral meniscus, the examiner places a hand
on the lateral joint line and applies an internal rotation force to the leg. A positive
test is found with a palpable “clunk” at the joint line and occurs as the torn meniscus
displaces. It is the most specific test (98%) for a meniscal tear but is only 15%
sensitive.
APLEY TEST: The patient is prone with the knee flexed to 90 degrees.
A downward compressive force is applied by the examiner through the lower leg
while laterally rotating the lower leg. Pain during this maneuver is indicative of
a meniscal injury.

222

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiology
Meniscal tears have an incidence of 60 to 70 cases per 100,000 people per year and
occur with a male predominance of approximately 3:1. Tears can be divided into 2
etiologies: those occurring in younger patients and caused by an acute, twisting,
or rotational force and those seen in older patients with menisci vulnerable to
injury secondary to underlying degenerative changes of the knee.

Diagnosis
A thorough history and physical exam is the first step in diagnosis, and patients
with meniscal pathology may describe an acute injury or a more indolent onset of
symptoms. Patients may have recurring knee effusions, medial or lateral joint line
tenderness, posterior knee pain, and/or mechanical symptoms, such as locking and
clicking.
The physical exam includes observing the patient’s gait, knee alignment,
symmetry, and use of assistive devices. Palpation and evaluation of the patella
for tenderness and laxity, palpation of the medial and lateral joint lines, the pes
anserinus, medial and lateral collateral ligaments, tibial tubercle, and Gerdy
tubercle should also be done. Range of motion (both hip and knee) must be assessed
and compared with the contralateral side, as should a ligamentous (ACL, posterior
cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, lateral collateral ligament) exam. Of
note, a torn lateral meniscus is the most commonly associated meniscal injury in
the setting of an acute ACL tear, whereas the medial meniscus is most commonly
torn in the setting of a knee with a chronic ACL deficiency. Crepitus or locking
should also be noted.
Two tests commonly used for the evaluation of meniscus-specific pathology are
the McMurray and Apley tests (Figure 23–1). Both have a high specificity but poor
sensitivity. Joint line tenderness remains the most sensitive test (74%) for a meniscal injury. Childress sign (Squat test) can also be used and is positive when the
patient, who attempts to squat and walk like a duck, feels pain, is unable to squat all
the way down, and feels a snap or click from the knee (Figure 23–1).
Plain radiographs should be the first imaging obtained. This includes bilateral
weightbearing posteroanterior (PA) views, 45-degree flexion PA views, 20 degrees
of flexion in patellofemoral view, and a lateral radiograph. MRI is used to confirm
the physical exam findings concerning for a meniscal tear and will identify the tear
pattern and displacement (Figure 23–2). It has an accuracy of approximately 95%
in diagnosing tears.

TREATMENT
Treatment of meniscal tears is patient- and tear-specific and varies from nonsurgical, conservative measures to resection, repair, or transplant. Nonsurgical treatment
includes ice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intraarticular corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. Indications include asymptomatic,
partial-thickness tears less than 5 to 10 mm in length.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

black meniscus. (Courtesy of Heidi Chumley, MD)

Surgical options include meniscal repair, open and arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, and meniscal transplant. Meniscal repair is reserved for acute tears in
the “red-red” zone of a nondegenerative meniscus. Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is the current standard of care for most tears and can relieve pain and
eliminate mechanical blocks to motion while preserving as much healthy tissue as
possible. Indications include symptomatic radial or longitudinal tears, patients who
have failed nonoperative management, displaced bucket-handle tears, tears creating a mechanical block, and symptomatic discoid lateral meniscus. Patients with
severe degenerative joint disease may be candidates for knee replacement. Meniscal
allograft transplant is indicated in a select group of young patients who have failed
prior partial or total meniscectomy with minimal degenerative changes.

Complications
Because the meniscus is responsible for the distribution of load and shear forces
across the knee, the initial meniscal injury as well as its management (ie, partial
or total meniscectomy) can increase the contact pressures between the femur and
tibia, accelerating the progression of degenerative joint disease. Additionally, repairs
can fail and infections can occur, either postoperatively or after an intraarticular
injection.

to his right knee. He has a negative Lachman exam and a positive McMurray
test. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Longitudinal vertical lateral meniscus tear
B. ACL injury
C. PCL injury
D. Bucket-handle medial meniscus tear
E. None of the above
23.2 Which of the following physical examination maneuvers is the most sensitive
in the diagnosis of a medial meniscus tear?
A. Apley test
B. McMurray test
C. Medial joint line tenderness
D. Lachman test
E. Pain with valgus stress
23.3 A 20-year-old soccer player sustained a twisting injury to his knee approximately 1 month ago. He complains of continued medial-sided knee pain with
occasional locking and catching. MRI findings are consistent with a tear of
the medial meniscus. What physical exam finding is classically seen with this
injury?
A. Positive anterior drawer test
B. No end point with varus stressing of the knee
C. Palpable pop when bringing the flexed knee to extension while internally
rotating the leg
D. Palpable pop when bringing the flexed knee to extension while externally
rotating the leg

ANSWERS
23.1 D. The patient has a bucket-handle medial meniscus tear after an acute injury.
Such tears are associated with knee locking and a block to full extension.
These tears are more common in young patients, often associated with ACL
tears, and are the most commonly missed meniscal tear on MRI.
23.2 C. Although the McMurray and Apley grind tests are commonly used to aid
in diagnosis, joint line tenderness to palpation has been shown to be the most
sensitive physical exam finding for meniscal injury.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

225

23.3 D. A positive McMurray test in the setting of a medial meniscus tear is the
presence of a palpable pop as the knee is brought from a flexed to extended
position while externally rotating the leg. C describes a positive McMurray
test for a lateral meniscus tear. A and B do not describe tests for meniscal
pathology, but instead the anterior cruciate ligament and the lateral collateral
ligament, respectively.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Meniscal tears are most accurately diagnosed by history and physical
exam, with joint line tenderness being the most sensitive indicator of a
meniscal tear.



Two tests commonly used for the evaluation of meniscus-specific
pathology are the McMurray and Apley tests, both of which have a high
specificity and low sensitivity.



MRI has an accuracy of approximately 95% in diagnosing tears.
Asymptomatic, partial-thickness tears less than 5 to 10 mm in length
are typically treated nonoperatively.



Indications for arthroscopic partial meniscectomy include symptomatic
radial or longitudinal tears, patients who have failed nonoperative
management, displaced bucket-handle tears, tears creating a mechanical
block, and symptomatic discoid lateral meniscus.

ANSWERS TO CASE 24:
Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injury of the Elbow
Summary: A 21-year-old right-hand dominant college baseball pitcher presents with
a 1-month history of right elbow pain during overhead throwing activities and complaints of decreased athletic performance. On examination, he has focal tenderness
over the medial epicondyle and the flexor pronator mass, as well as reproducible
pain with a valgus stress applied to the right elbow.
• Most likely diagnosis: Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) tear.
• Next diagnostic step: Standard radiographs with or without “throwers series.”
• Next step in therapy: UCL reconstruction.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Review relevant elbow anatomy and biomechanics as it pertains to the throwing
athlete and recognize common associated pathology in athletes who present with
UCL tears.
2. Discuss a diagnostic approach to UCL injury in throwing athletes, including
common physical exam findings and the specific role of standard and advanced
imaging techniques.
3. Be familiar with the available treatment modalities and the primary principles of
nonoperative (physical therapy) and operative management (UCL reconstruction).

Considerations
The UCL is composed of 3 distinct bundles, namely the anterior bundle, the posterior
bundle, and the oblique bundle (ie, transverse ligament). The anterior bundle serves as
the primary stabilizer to valgus stress when the elbow is in a flexed position. To understand the contribution of the UCL to elbow stability during throwing, it is important to
be familiar with the 6 phases of the baseball pitch. These highly coordinated phases
include the (1) wind-up, (2) early arm-cocking, (3) late arm-cocking, (4) acceleration,
(5) deceleration, and (6) follow-through phases. Valgus force generated at the elbow during the throwing motion is highest during the late cocking and early acceleration phases.
Throwing athletes place significant functional demands on the UCL, and repetitive overuse can result in chronic injury to the ligament. These injuries were once
considered career-ending; however, improved understanding of elbow biomechanics
and throwing kinematics has resulted in successful clinical outcomes in the majority
of patients who undergo surgical reconstruction of the UCL. The 21-year-old baseball pitcher in this clinical scenario developed a UCL tear from repetitive valgus
force placed on the UCL during pitching. Overhead throwing can produce forces
that exceed the ligament’s tensile strength, thus resulting in ligament rupture and
debilitating medial elbow pain. UCL reconstruction is the principal procedure to
restore valgus stability and relieve medial elbow pain in the setting of UCL injury.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

229

APPROACH TO:
UCL Injury of the Elbow
DEFINITIONS
LIGAMENT: A dense connective tissue structure comprising primarily type I
collagen with the primary function of restricting joint motion (ie, stabilize joints).
VALGUS STRESS: Refers to a force at the elbow that is produced with outward
angulation (ie, away from the body’s midline) of the distal segment of the arm.
TENSILE STRENGTH: A measure of a material’s ability to resist a specific
force that tends to tear it apart. It is expressed as the maximum stress/force that
the material can withstand without disruption.

CLINICAL APPROACH
When obtaining a history from a throwing athlete who presents with medial elbow
pain, it is important to obtain specific information regarding the athlete’s sport
(baseball, softball, javelin, etc.), level of participation, and any recent changes in
the athlete’s training routine (ie, increase in pitch count, types of pitches thrown).
In general, patients can present with an acute tear of the ligament, characterized by
the sudden onset of medial elbow pain accompanied by a “popping” sensation, or
with chronic overuse injuries, which are typically characterized by persistent bouts
of pain during pitching and complaints of decreased throwing accuracy, velocity,
and stamina. Most patients report significant pain during the late cocking and
early acceleration phases of throwing, as it represents the phase at which the
ligament experiences the greatest amount of valgus stress. Mechanical symptoms
such as locking or catching during elbow motion can represent associated pathology,
including olecranon osteophytes or intraarticular loose bodies. Ulnar nerve pathology typically manifests as specific neurologic complaints, including numbness and
tingling that radiates to the ring and small fingers.
Physical exam should begin with inspection of the elbow to detect the presence
of an effusion. If a UCL injury is suspected, the ligament should be palpated along its
anatomic course from the medial epicondyle (origin) to the sublime tubercle (insertion) located on the ulna. Any tenderness within this area can represent significant
injury to the ligament or the flexor-pronator musculature. Both passive and active
range of motion should be compared with the opposite extremity, as it is common to
observe slight elbow flexion contractures in the dominant extremity. Several physical
examination tests can be used to specifically test the integrity of the UCL. The
valgus stress test is performed with the arm stabilized against the examiner and
the elbow flexed to 30 degrees (Figure 24–1). Valgus stress is then gently applied at
the elbow to detect any abnormal widening at the ulnohumeral joint and/or reproduction of painful symptoms. The “milking maneuver” is performed with the elbow
flexed beyond 90 degrees, as the contralateral arm is used to grasp the thumb and
generate a valgus force at the elbow (Figure 24–2). If the patient reports pain with
this test, a UCL injury should be suspected. The moving valgus stress test is performed with the examiner applying a valgus torque at the elbow in full flexion and

This test is highly sensitive (100%) and specific (75%) for UCL injury.
Several basic and advanced imaging studies can be used to facilitate accurate
diagnosis and guide proper treatment in any athlete who presents with a suspected
UCL tear. Routine diagnostic imaging should begin with standard AP and lateral radiographs of the elbow. A “throwers series,” which includes two oblique
radiographic views in internal and external rotation and an oblique axial view
with the elbow in 110 degrees of flexion, can also be obtained to look for subtle
associated pathology (ie, osteophyte formation, radiocapitellar osteochondritis dissecans, intraarticular loose bodies). Lastly, stress AP radiographs (x-rays obtained
with valgus stress applied to the elbow) of both the injured and uninjured elbows
can be used to detect any subtle differences in ulnohumeral widening secondary to
UCL disruption. Advanced imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
can help identify ligament thickening from chronic overuse injury or more obvious
full-thickness tears. Magnetic resonance arthrography obtained with intraarticular

232

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

injection of gadolinium can aid in the diagnosis of partial undersurface tears of the
ligament.
Some UCL tears can successfully be managed with a structured rehabilitation protocol. Early phases of rehabilitation include strict rest from all throwing
activities and reduction of pain and inflammation with ice and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID). Gradual flexor-pronator strengthening exercises are
incorporated, along with a progressive throwing program once all painful symptoms
have resolved.
Surgical reconstruction of the UCL is indicated when patients demonstrate
continued symptoms after a trial of structured rehabilitation. UCL reconstruction
should only be performed in high-demand, throwing athletes who are willing to
participate in an extensive postoperative rehabilitation program. When indicated,
reconstruction involves securing a tendon graft to the humerus and ulna. Several
techniques have been described, all of which provide good to excellent results in
approximately 85% of cases. Common techniques used include the modified Jobe
technique and the docking technique. It is clear that a muscle-splitting approach
and minimal surgical manipulation of the ulnar nerve can limit postoperative morbidity and complications.
The main complications to beware of include damage to the ulnar or medial
antebrachial cutaneous nerve during surgical dissection, ulnar or epicondylar
fracture during tunnel drilling, and postoperative elbow stiffness from inadequate
rehabilitation. In general, athletes can expect to return to competitive throwing
12 months after surgery if the shoulder, elbow, and forearm are pain-free and full
range of motion has been restored.

overhead throwing. He is diagnosed with a UCL tear after physical examination and MRI. What anatomic structure is the primary stabilizer to valgus
stress at the elbow?
A. Anterior bundle of the UCL
B. Transverse ligament
C. Radial head
D. Flexor pronator mass
24.2 A 17-year-old baseball pitcher presents with medial elbow pain during overhead throwing. He is diagnosed with a UCL tear after physical examination
and MRI. During what phase of throwing is he most likely to complain of
medial elbow pain?
A. Follow-through
B. Deceleration
C. Acceleration
D. Wind-up

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

233

24.3 A 21-year-old javelin thrower is diagnosed with a full-thickness UCL tear.
On presentation, he complains of numbness and tingling in the ring and small
fingers. Which muscle group would he be most likely to have motor weakness
in as well?
A. Brachioradialis
B. Extensor carpi ulnaris
C. Abductor digiti minimi
D. Palmaris longus

ANSWERS
24.1 A. The anterior bundle of the UCL is the primary stabilizer to valgus stress at
the elbow.
24.2 C. Throwing athletes typically complain of medial elbow pain during the
acceleration phase of throwing. Valgus force generated at the elbow during
the throwing motion is highest during the acceleration phase.
24.3 C. The patient is experiencing ulnar nerve paresthesias. If the patient had
associated motor symptoms, they would manifest as weakness within the
abductor digiti minimi. The other answer choices are not muscles innervated
by the ulnar nerve.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The anterior bundle of the UCL is the primary stabilizer to valgus stress
at the elbow.



Patients with UCL injuries typically report medial elbow pain during the
acceleration phase of throwing.



The most sensitive and specific clinical test for UCL injury is the moving
valgus stress test.



A muscle-splitting surgical approach and minimal manipulation of the
ulnar nerve can limit postoperative morbidity to the flexor pronator mass
and the ulnar nerve.



Ulnar nerve transposition can be performed in conjunction with UCL
reconstruction if patients demonstrate significant pathology related to
the nerve (ulnar nerve subluxation or motor weakness).

CASE 25
A 45-year-old musician comes to the office complaining of a 3-month history of
neck pain that radiates into his right arm. It is “electric” in nature, spontaneously
sending a shooting sensation down his arm. Last week, he noted weakness in his
right arm with elbow flexion. His pain is relatively constant and is accompanied
by some loss of sensation in his thumb and index finger. He is finding it difficult
to play the piano with his right hand. The patient gains some relief by lying down,
but states that occasional bouts of “shooting” pain are interfering with his sleep.
He denies other systemic complaints, such as fevers and chills. His past medical
and surgical history is unremarkable except for a 20-pack-year smoking history.
On physical exam, gait testing demonstrates a fluid, nonataxic, nonantalgic gait.
Neck range of motion is decreased with lateral bending and axial rotation to the
right side, and neck extension is uncomfortable. Right shoulder range of motion is
pain-free. Neurologic testing demonstrates marked weakness with resisted elbow
flexion (4/5) and shoulder abduction and forward flexion (4/5) with full strength
in all other right upper extremity muscle groups. He has a decreased bicipital
reflex as compared with the unaffected side. Capillary refill is brisk. No lesions,
ecchymosis, or erythema is present in the arm or hand. Examination of the left
upper extremity and both lower extremities are within normal limits. Plain radiographs of the cervical spine and right shoulder are obtained and show no acute
pathology, revealing only mild degenerative changes.

ANSWERS TO CASE 25:
Herniated Nucleus Pulposus of the Cervical Spine
Summary: A 45-year-old male smoker presents with 3 months of electric-like pains
beginning in his neck and radiating down his right arm. He has weakness in his
biceps. Radiographs reveal only mild cervical spondylosis.
• Most likely diagnosis: Cervical radiculopathy due to a herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP).
• Next step in therapy: Nonoperative (conservative) management with overthe-counter medications including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and possibly muscle relaxants. Short courses of
oral corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone (Medrol) dose packs, are also
an option. Brief courses of low-dose narcotics for breakthrough pain may be prescribed, and recommendations for stretching exercises and application of cold
and/or warm compresses may be given. Smoking cessation is indicated, as tobacco
and nicotine use has been associated with the pathogenesis of degenerative
changes in the disk and HNP.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Develop a diagnostic approach to cervical neck pain.
2. Understand the workup for radiculopathic pain.
3. Be familiar with the natural history of HNP and the indications for surgery.

Considerations
This 45-year-old man developed neck pain insidiously. Although he has slight
weakness, he does not have any symptoms requiring urgent intervention. A careful
history eliminates the possibilities of radiculopathy as secondary to trauma,
infection, or other inflammatory neoplastic processes. The physician must be sure
to localize the pathology to the cervical spine, as ipsilateral shoulder and upperextremity pathologies such as brachial plexus injury or peripheral nerve entrapment may present similarly. On physical exam, strength, sensation, and reflexes
are tested in all applicable myotomal and dermatomal distributions of the bilateral
upper and lower extremities. This patient exhibits mild weakness consistent with
a right-sided C6 nerve root pathology. Special tests, like the Spurling test, help
diagnose nerve root compression at the cervical level. Plain radiographs, although
not always necessary on first presentation, are relatively inexpensive and painless
and are a simple and convenient way to evaluate for processes other than an HNP,
such as fracture or facet arthropathy.
Given this patient’s history, radiographs consistent with only mild degenerative
changes and physical exam findings that include weakness with resisted elbow flexion,
positive Spurling test, and blunted biceps reflex, he likely has a C6 radiculopathy due

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

237

to a C5-6 HNP. There is no clear consensus on whether further imaging is necessary in
this patient. Indeed the great majority of patients with spinal radiculopathies experience a spontaneous resolution of symptoms with little more than over-the-counter
therapies. Because this patient has yet to try NSAIDs and other conservative treatments, he may be trialed on such therapies before further workup is performed.
Should the patient experience a dramatic worsening of symptoms or simply a failure
to improve on this regimen, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his cervical spine
should be obtained.

APPROACH TO:
Cervical Radiculopathy
DEFINITIONS
RADICULOPATHY: Clinical findings of sensory or motor dysfunction in the distribution of a specific nerve root. Radiculopathies are typically caused by nerve root
compression.
HOFFMAN SIGN: A physical exam finding suggestive of upper motor neuron
dysfunction in the upper extremity. Hoffman sign is elicited by repeatedly “flicking”
the tip of the patient’s index or middle finger and observing for reactive flexion of
the thumb or fingers. It is analogous to the Babinski sign of the lower extremities.
SPURLING SIGN: A physical exam finding elicited with neck extension and
rotation toward the affected side. The test is positive when the pattern of radicular
pain into the upper extremity is reproduced. Spurling sign is highly suggestive of a
cervical spine etiology for upper-extremity pain and should be negative in situations
in which radicular-like symptoms are caused by brachial plexus or peripheral nerve
compressive etiologies.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Anatomy and Pathophysiology
The most common disk level of the cervical spine responsible for radiculopathic
pain is C6-7, which typically manifests as symptoms attributable to C7 nerve root
dysfunction. A disk herniation at the C5-6 level is the second most common location in the cervical spine.
Cervical radiculopathy is thought to result from several mechanisms. Most
commonly, acute nerve compression occurs from direct nerve root impingement
by herniated soft disc material. Typical locations for HNP in the axial plane are
posterolateral to the disc space and medial to the uncovertebral joint. Here, the
disc-restraining posterior longitudinal ligament and annulus fibrosis are absent,
and there is little to restrain an expanding disc when it is placed under pressure. Herniations here typically impinge on the exiting nerve root (ie, the C7
root at C6-7 and the C6 root at C5-6). A second mechanism for cervical nerve
root compression may result from chronic disc height loss and hypertrophy of the

238

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

uncovertebral joint, which is consistent with aging and degenerative disease. Discal height loss may be accompanied by bulging of the disc material or uncovertebral hypertrophy posteriorly against the spinal canal and nerve roots, leading to
compression. Similar height loss and degeneration may cause stenosis within the
neuroforamina, leading to compression of the exiting nerve root. At least in the
acute setting, herniated disc material is thought to be inflammatory in nature
and has been associated with the production of inflammatory mediators including
interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6, substance P, bradykinin, tumor necrosis factor α, and
prostaglandins.

History and Physical Exam
A thorough history and physical exam should be performed, with special attention to the origin of the patient’s symptoms. A history of traumatic onset may
suggest fracture or traumatic disc herniation. A history of neoplastic processes
or systemic inflammatory states may be suggestive of nerve compression secondary to tumor growth, pathologic fracture, or epidural abscess. Patients may complain of fever, chills, weight loss, or nocturnal malaise in the setting of radicular
pain and neurologic dysfunction. In such cases, workup should include advanced
imaging of the cervical spine (typically an MRI) and laboratory studies such as
white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. If
lesions are suggested or suspected, a more generalized exam for metastatic disease
involving computed tomography (CT) or nuclear scanning may be required. Common symptoms consistent with HNP of the cervical spine include complaints of
occipital headaches; neck pain, worse with motion; and pain in the neck, shoulder, and arms. Root compression often manifests with paresthesias in the affected
extremity. It is important to realize, however, that there is a significant overlap
and variance in the dermatomal distributions of nerve roots. Therefore, paresthesias associated with single-nerve root compression may not always follow the
textbook dermatomal maps.
On exam, motor strength is graded on a 0 to 5 scale. Sensory testing should
evaluate for both dorsal column and spinothalamic tract function by evaluation of
positional and pain/temperature sensations, respectively. Evidence of upper motor
neuropathy should be ruled out. For detailed instruction on performing the spinal
exam, please refer to the “Approach to the Orthopaedic Patient” section, located
near the beginning of this text.

Differential Diagnosis
Before a clinical diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy can be made, several other disease processes must be considered and then ruled out. Most notably, brachial plexus
injuries and peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes of the upper extremity may
closely resemble the sensory and motor symptomatology of nerve root compression.
Other sources of radicular-like symptoms include degenerative changes, stenosis,
and space-occupying lesions, such as abscesses or tumors. The presence of upper
motor neuron signs (suggested by a positive Hoffman sign or gait changes) would
point to either a cervical stenosis causing cord compression or other neurologic
conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

239

Imaging
Once fractures and other pathology are ruled out by plain x-ray, MRI may be considered a next step in the further workup of cervical radicular pain. It must be
stated again, however, that because the great majority of these patients experience
a spontaneous resolution of symptoms, not every patient presenting with radicular
symptoms needs to undergo urgent MRI. In patients with unremitting pain that
has failed conservative management, continued or progressive weakness, neurologic decompensation, or bowel or bladder changes, MRI is the gold standard to
evaluate spinal cord and root compression in the absence of contraindications.
On T2-weighted MRI, cerebrospinal fluid is bright and clearly distinguishes areas
of compression and patency. In patients for whom MRI is contraindicated, most
commonly those with pacemakers or interventions for intracerebral aneurysms, CT
myelography may offer a clear visualization of the spinal cord and roots.

TREATMENT
Nonoperative Treatment
Acute cervical radiculopathy typically has a self-limited course. In fact, 75% of
these patients improve without surgical intervention. The first line against cervical
radiculopathic pain should be NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen. NSAIDs play a distinct role in attenuating the painful local inflammatory response resulting from disc
herniations and their inflammatory effects on nerve roots and may decrease pressure
around affected nerve roots. Low-dose narcotic analgesics, although not commonly
recommended for chronic treatment, may be necessary to control acute pain that is
refractory to NSAIDs and acetaminophen. Adjunctive treatment with muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine may help decrease associated painful muscle spasms
and may decrease narcotic requirements in certain patients. Although current literature fails to demonstrate their clear efficacy, brief courses of oral corticosteroids are sometimes prescribed to decrease inflammatory responses to HNP.
Adjunctive therapies such as physical therapy, massage therapy, and the application
of heat or ice packs are not strongly supported by the literature, but may be used if
helpful to the patient.
When conservative measures fail, epidural steroid injections may offer some
transient relief but have not been shown to alter the natural history of the disease
process. Localized steroid injections may have an anti-inflammatory effect on irritated
nerve roots and may play a role in the inhibition of pain pathways. The true efficacy
of epidural injections is debated and varies greatly between individuals.

Surgical Treatment
When nonsurgical treatment fails to relieve symptoms, or if neurologic deficits progressively worsen, surgical decompression may be necessary. As a general rule, surgical approaches to the cervical spine should be directed “where the pathology
is.” Because herniation originates in the disc space, an anterior surgical approach is
preferred in the setting of central and posterolateral anterior compressive pathology.
Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is the most common surgical treatment for cervical HNP. For isolated single-level nerve root compression, posterior

240

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

approaches to the cervical spine may be used if the pathology is accessible through
the neural foramen. Posterior laminoforaminotomy relieves pressure on the nerve
root by unroofing the neuroforamen and allowing the root to decompress. This
technique preserves motion between vertebral levels because the disc is left intact,
and thus fusion of vertebral segments is unnecessary. Surgical outcomes for relief of
radicular pain range from 80% to 90% with either anterior or posterior approaches.
Lastly, a relatively new and controversial technique in the treatment of singlelevel disease is cervical disc arthroplasty (replacement). Although limited in both
application and supporting data at this time, this promising procedure may offer
the best of both worlds: preserving motion between segments while allowing for a
thorough discectomy and decompression.

Complications
Although ACDF procedures typically have good outcomes, they are not without
potential complications. The anterior approach to the cervical spine puts several
vulnerable neurovascular structures at risk, including the recurrent laryngeal nerve
(1% risk of injury with ACDF) and, to a lesser degree, the hypoglossal nerve, vagal
nerve, and the carotid arteries. Horner syndrome is “classically” characterized by
ptosis, anhidrosis, and miosis and results from injury to the sympathetic chain,
located laterally to the longus colli muscles at the C6 level. Finally, pseudarthrosis,
or the failure of bony fusion, may occur at rates as high as 5% to 10% for singlelevel fusions. Rates dramatically increase to 30% to 40% for multiple-level fusions,
but few pseudoarthroses are actually symptomatic or require revision work. Tobacco
and chronic corticosteroid use is a significant risk factor for the development of
pseudoarthrosis.

A. C5
B. C6
C. C7
D. C8
E. T1
25.3 A 42-year-old construction worker has experienced 8 weeks of unremitting
left biceps weakness, wrist extensor weakness, and both pain and numbness in
his index finger and thumb. His pain is especially bad when turning his head
to the left. He has tried oral steroids, opiates, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, acupuncture, and a local steroid injection 3 weeks ago; all have failed to provide
adequate relieve. He states his biceps and wrist weakness is getting worse, as
he is now unable to lift even a glass of water with his left arm. MRI confirms
HNP at the left-sided C5-6 neuro foramen. What is the next best step in the
management of this patient?
A. Repeat corticosteroid injection at C5-6 level
B. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) of C5-6
C. Increasing oral steroid dosing
D. Prescribing a hard collar for neck immobilization
E. CT scan and/or bone scan to rule out fracture or other injury

ANSWERS
25.1 E. This patient has a C6-C7 HNP affecting the C7 nerve root, which is classically responsible for elbow extension and wrist flexion. The triceps reflex is
most commonly associated with C7 nerve root pathology, making E the correct answer choice.
25.2 D. Grip strength and sensation to the small and sometimes ring fingers are
classically attributed to the C8 nerve root, most often affected by C7-T1 disc
herniations.
25.3 B. ACDF of C5-6 disc with fusion is an effective and highly successful procedure for patients with clearly defined symptomatology and imaging consistent
with pathology. This patient has progressive neurologic changes consistent
with a well-defined dermo/myotomal distribution. He has failed conservative therapy; increasing steroid dosing and even additional steroid injection
are unlikely to help. Further imaging is unnecessary given the consistency
between his symptoms and MRI and a lack of suspicion for further injury.

CASE 26
A 43-year-old obese man presents to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of 12 hours of right leg pain and “tingling” in his left foot. Yesterday he was
helping his neighbor carry a sofa up a flight of stairs when he experienced sudden
“lightning-like” pain in his back that radiated down his legs. He went home and
took acetaminophen before bed. This morning, he awoke with worsening back
and left leg pain, and he was startled to notice weakness in his left foot and ankle.
Now, in the ED, he reports an almost complete inability to move his left foot and
a burning, constant pain throughout both legs. Physical exam reveals decreased
motor strength in his left lower extremity, notably 2/5 extensor hallucis longus
and foot dorsiflexor strength. He is unable to plantar flex this foot. His left hip and
knee extensors are 5/5 in strength, as are all major muscular groups of his right
lower and bilateral upper extremities. He has normal patellar reflexes bilaterally,
but an Achilles reflex is only present on his right side. Sensation testing demonstrates decreased sensitivity to light touch and pin-prick stimulation in the perianal regions, perineum, and posterior thighs, bilaterally. The dorsum and plantar
aspects of the left foot are similarly insensate. Digital rectal examination demonstrates decreased tone, and the patient is surprised to learn that his underwear
is damp with urine. Bladder scan demonstrates a retained volume of 1100 mL.
Vascular examination reveals warm and well-perfused skin with palpable dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.

ANSWERS TO CASE 26:
Cauda Equina Syndrome
Summary: This is a 43-year-old man who presents with a 12-hour history of progressively worsening lumbosacral back and left leg pain, weakness, and sensory loss that
began after he tried to lift a heavy object. He is experiencing bilateral lower extremity
and perianal paresthesias, with significant weakness in his left lower extremity,
diminished left-sided reflexes, decreased rectal tone, and urinary retention.
• Most likely diagnosis: Cauda equina syndrome (CES) secondary to herniated
nucleus pulposis (HNP), most likely at the L4-5 level.
• Most common causes: Compression of the cauda equina secondary to lumbar disc herniation, primary tumors or metastatic disease, infections, stenosis,
hematomas, and ischemic insult.
• Management of CES: Pain control, placement of urinary catheter, MRI of
lumbosacral spine to confirm diagnosis and to identify region of compression,
and, if positive, emergency surgical decompression of cauda equina.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the presentation of cauda equina syndrome (CES).
2. Understand the anatomic and pathophysiologic bases of this condition.
3. Be familiar with the management of CES and understand its outcomes.

Considerations
Low back pain is one of the most common complaints in EDs and primary care
offices in the United States. Although back pain is disconcerting, even debilitating,
to patients, very few patients presenting with acute-onset pain—0.05% by
some estimates—require urgent operative intervention. CES is one such urgent
indication. This patient’s symptoms, although mild at first, rapidly developed into
a syndrome including sciatica, lower-extremity sensorimotor loss, and bowel and
bladder dysfunction. This rapid progression of symptoms demands urgent and
careful attention by knowledgeable physicians, as delayed intervention can result
in devastating consequences if left untreated for greater than 24 to 48 hours.
After adequate pain relief, a complete and thorough medical history should assess
for factors that make the patient prone to cauda equina, such as a history of symptoms
of radicular disease, previous spinal surgery or injections, trauma, infection, the use
of anticoagulants, or previous spine pathology. Potential spine fractures should be
ruled out, because this patient’s symptoms began as he was undergoing significant
axial loads that may have caused vertebral fractures with cord compression. Next, a
thorough physical exam should be performed and must include the often-neglected
assessment of sensation, motor, and reflexive function of the perianal and rectal

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

regions, including evaluating the presence or absence of normal tone. For detailed
instruction on performing the spinal exam, please refer to the “Approach to the
Orthopaedic Patient” section, located near the beginning of this text.
The next step in this patient’s workup includes urgent acquisition of appropriate
imaging, either through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral
spine or computed tomography (CT) myelography in the presence of contraindications to MRI. MRI serves to elucidate the cause and location of the cauda equina
compression, as well as to guide the surgical approach (anterior or posterior)
and the need for potential arthrodesis (in the setting of instability attributable to
trauma, infection, or tumor). In this case, axial and sagittal T2-weighted images, seen
in Figure 26–1, demonstrate a large, posteriorly herniated disc at the L4-5 level extruding paracentrally and laterally on the left side. Roots caudal to this level show varied
levels of dysfunction consistent with midline compression of the descending lumbosacral roots. Plans should be made for urgent passage to the operating room, as permanent
neurologic damage may result from delayed decompression of the cauda equina.

APPROACH TO:
Cauda Equina Syndrome
DEFINITIONS
SCIATICA: A referred pain syndrome in the buttock, leg, and/or foot distributions
of the sciatic nerve, caused by compression of either the sciatic nerve itself, or its
individual lumbosacral roots.
ANAL WINK REFLEX: A normal reflex of anal sphincter contraction, elicited by
stroking the skin lateral to the anus. Absence of this reflex may suggest dysfunction
of the S2-4 nerve roots.

246

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

LOWER MOTOR NEURON LESION: Any lesion that disrupts the function of
the motor nerve fibers between the anterior horn of the spinal cord and its innervated muscles. Characterized by hypotonia, hypo- or areflexia, flaccid paralysis or
weakness, fibrillations, and fasciculations. By contrast, upper motor neuron lesions
affect motor nerve pathways between the cerebral motor cortex and the spinal cord
and are characterized by hypertonia, hyperreflexia, and spastic paralysis.

CLINICAL APPROACH
CES is an uncommon and relatively rare condition that accounts for fewer than 1 in
2000 patients who present with lower back pain. This condition is associated with a
large space-occupying lesion within the lumbosacral spine that impinges on the loose
terminal roots of the spinal nerves within the spinal canal. These roots form the cauda
equina, or “horse’s tail” in Latin, so named for their likeness to the equine appendage. Diagnostic criteria for CES include 1 or more of the following: (1) bladder
and/or bowel dysfunction—typically retention in its early stages, (2) reduced sensation in the saddle area, or (3) sexual dysfunction, with possible motor/sensory/
reflex deficit in the lower limb. Signs and symptoms of CES develop in less than
24 hours from a given insult in more than 85% of reported cases. Nerve root compression in CES most commonly results from a herniated lumbar disc, but is thought
to represent only 1% to 6% of all operative lumbar HNP cases. Risk factors for HNP
include obesity, male sex, age greater than 40 years, and history of spine disorders. Less
common etiologies of CES include compression by a tumorous growth, infection and
abscess formation, spinal stenosis, hematoma formation, and inflammation.

Anatomy and Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of CES is complex and not fully understood. In adults, the
spinal cord terminates between the L1 and L2 vertebrae body, below which the
cauda equina descend as a collection of peripheral nerve roots to the L1 to coccygeal
levels. These roots are thought to be especially vulnerable to compression because
they are only protected by a single layer of endoneurium, whereas most other peripheral nerves and indeed the spinal cord itself are surrounded by an epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium. Compression and damage to the cauda equina can lead
to diffuse lower motor neuron lesions, resulting in uni- or bilateral sciatica, lower
extremity weakness, saddle anesthesia (resulting from insult to the S2-4 roots), and
bowel and bladder dysfunction (also primarily the S2-4 roots).
Patients presenting with back pain and bowel or bladder dysfunction should
raise immediate flags for the possibility of CES. Neurogenic bladder dysfunction,
characterized by urinary retention more often than incontinence, is an essential
symptom of CES. In normal urinary bladder physiology, the detrusor urinae muscle
is responsible for contracting the bladder during voiding and is controlled by the
parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) via S2, S3, and S4 nerve roots. During
urinary voiding, the PNS directs detrusor contraction with simultaneous relaxation
of the internal urinary sphincter. When damage to the S2-4 nerve roots occurs,
the bladder cannot contract or release through the sphincter, and thus overflow
incontinence develops. Postvoid residual volume should be obtained in patients in
whom CES is suspected.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

247

The S2-4 nerve roots also provide sensation to the saddle region, including the
perineum, buttocks, and posteromedial thighs. A complete rectal examination,
including testing for an anal wink reflex and a bulbocavernosus reflex, should be
performed on CES patients. Patients presenting with both saddle anesthesia and
urinary incontinence—suggestive of extensive insult to the sacral roots—have been
found to have poor prognosis with regard to long-term bladder function.

Radiologic Evaluation
After a thorough history and physical exam, urgent diagnostic imaging should be
performed. Plain radiographs are of limited value in the diagnosis of CES, but may
be useful to evaluate for alternate pathology such as a fracture, dislocation or subluxation, tumor, or infection. Diagnosing lumbar disc herniation in CES requires a
CT or MRI. MRI is the gold standard for evaluating patients because it allows for
detailed visualization of the spinal canal, disc spaces, nerve roots, and visualization
of any potential space-occupying lesion within the canal or foramina. If MRI is
contraindicated or unavailable, CT myelogram is the next best study to evaluate
for CES. In addition to confirming the diagnosis, advanced imaging is helpful for
preoperative planning for decompression.

TREATMENT AND OUTCOMES
In patients without absolute medical contraindications, CES is treated with emergent
surgical exploration and nerve root decompression. A variety of surgical procedures
and techniques are performed in the treatment of CES, ranging from minimally invasive micro-discectomies to extensive multiple-level bilateral laminectomies, discectomies, and occasionally arthrodeses. No significant evidence, however, supports the
superiority of any one procedure. It is generally thought that surgical decompression
should occur within 24 to 48 hours of CES diagnosis to prevent further neurologic
decline and to improve chances of recovery. There is evidence to suggest that
patients treated more than 48 hours after diagnosis had significantly decreased
odds of recovering complete sensory, motor, sexual, urinary, and rectal function.

26.2 A 55-year-old man presents with low back pain and right “foot drop” 72 hours
after straining his back trying to shovel snow from his driveway. He denies bowel
or bladder changes. Sensation is intact throughout his bilateral lower extremities and perianal region, with the exception of some numbness to light touch
across the dorsum of his right foot. He has a weak extensor hallucis longus and
tibialis anterior (3/5) on his right side, but otherwise full strength in his bilateral
low extremities. Straight leg raise is positive on his right side, sending “electric
shock” sciatic pain down to his foot. He takes warfarin for atrial fibrillation, and
his international normalized ratio (INR) is 2.5. He has no additional symptoms,
nor medical history. What is the next step in the management of this patient?
A. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 24 hours
B. Emergency MRI, if not contraindicated, of lumbosacral spine
C. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, activity modification, and physical therapy
D. Urgent reversal of INR with vitamin K and/or fresh-frozen plasma and
preoperative planning including making the patient nothing by mouth
(NPO), acquiring preoperative laboratory studies, chest x-ray, and electrocardiogram (ECG)
E. Epidural steroid injection
26.3 A 44-year-old woman suffers a fall while rock climbing, landing on her buttocks and falling forward. Despite prolonged airlift to the ED, she is hemodynamically stable. She complains of bilateral pain in her legs, distal to her
knees. She has profound weakness in her bilaterally extensor hallucis longi
and gastrocsoleus complexes and has marked saddle anesthesia. MRI shows a
large, midline herniated disc, compressing each of the traversing nerve roots
and entire cauda equina below its level, but sparing the exiting nerve roots.
Which disc is most likely involved in this injury?
A. L2-3
B.
C.
D.
E.

L3-4
L4-5
L5-S1
S1-2

ANSWERS
26.1 B. This patient has acute symptoms of CES. Although MRI of the lumbosacral spine is the ideal study to confirm this diagnosis, this patient’s pacemaker
may be a contraindication to MRI. In such situations, CT myelography is the
next best option. When performed for CES evaluation, MRIs should focus on
the lumbosacral spine, not the chest and abdomen, and gadolinium contrast is
usually unnecessary. Although steroids and/or NSAIDs and physical may play
a role in treatment of acute HNP, they are not the first line in the treatment of
CES. Likewise, this patient may require metastatic workup, but this is not the
priority in the acute management of CES.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

249

26.2 C. This patient’s history and presentation is consistent with an isolated,
acutely HNP at L4-5. Although his motor and sensory deficits are concerning,
the majority of patients will experience resolution of symptoms with nonoperative conservative management including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, physical
therapy, and activity modification. Although an MRI may be helpful in making this diagnosis, it is not emergently indicated, as this patient does not have
evidence of CES or other pathology that would require emergency, extensive
workup, or surgical intervention. Epidural steroid injection is not the first line
of treatment for an acute HNP, but may offer some relief in patients with
refractory symptoms. Generally, epidural injection should not be performed
with a significantly elevated INR.
26.3 C. This patient has weak extensor hallucis longi (L5 nerve root), weak gastrocsoleus complexes (S1), and saddle anesthesia (S2-4). She has normal
function above this level, suggesting that the L5 nerve roots and those below
are affected. An injury at L4-5 that spares the exiting roots (L4) but affects the
traversing roots (L5) and those below (S1-5) would be most consistent with
these symptoms. Remember the sacral spine does not have interbody discs, as
it is fused.

CLINICAL PEARLS


CES is defined by a characteristic cluster of symptoms, including low
back pain, sciatica, lower extremity sensorimotor loss, and bowel and
bladder dysfunction.



CES is treated with urgent surgical decompression, unless there is an
absolute contraindication to surgery.



CES is a surgical emergency! Preparations for urgent operative intervention should begin as soon as the diagnosis is suspected.

CASE 27
A 34-year-old male construction worker arrives in the emergency department (ED)
after a 25-foot fall at a construction site 3 hours ago. The patient landed on his feet
and then fell backwards and was unable to stand after the accident. He is complaining of right ankle and low back pain, as well as numbness and tingling in both
legs. He has no prior medical history. On exam, the patient is hemodynamically
stable with vital signs within normal limits. His right heel is swollen and tender,
but the skin is intact. He has midline tenderness in the upper lumbar spine and
substantially decreased sensation to light touch in his bilateral proximal thighs
and extending distally. Rectal exam demonstrates decreased rectal tone, as well as
decreased but intact perianal sensation. Bulbocavernosus reflex is absent, as are
his bilateral patella and Achilles reflexes. Plain films and a computed tomography
(CT) are acquired by the ED and are shown in Figure 27–1.

ANSWERS TO CASE 27:
Lumbar Burst Fracture
Summary: A 34-year-old healthy male construction worker presents to the ED
with apparent injuries to his right heel and lower back after a fall from 25 feet. He
landed in an upright, standing position. Furthermore, he has evidence of loss of
sensation and tingling in his legs and perineal region and substantial weakness in
both legs. The lack of a bulbocavernosus reflex (ie, the reflexive contraction of the
anal sphincter when the glans penis is pinched or a Foley catheter is pulled) means
that the patient is in spinal shock. He was unable to walk after his injury, which
may be secondary to spinal cord injury and/or an additional injury to his heel.
• Spine fracture: This patient has a lumbar spine burst fracture.
• Common mechanism of injury: Lumbar spine burst fractures are commonly
the result of high-energy axial loading, most often from a fall from a height or a
motor vehicle collision.
• Next diagnostic step: Neurologic changes in the setting of spinal fracture
should warrant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate involvement of
the spinal cord and/or roots. Given the high-energy fall, this patient will also
need a minimum of an anteroposterior (AP) or posteroanterior (PA) chest
x-ray, an AP pelvis x-ray, C-spine imaging (x-rays and/or CT scans), and x-rays
of the right ankle, given the heel tenderness and swelling on examination.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn how to grade spinal cord injury with regard to sensation and muscle
strength.
2. Understand the definition, diagnosis, and prognosis of spinal shock, and understand its role in the management of patients with acute neurologic injuries.
3. Know the diagnostic approach to acute injuries of the lumbar spine, and identify
“red flags” for serious injuries requiring immediate surgical intervention.

Considerations
This 34-year-old male sustained an injury to his lumbar spine, based on both the
presence of tenderness in the lumbar region and his motor and sensory examination.
Additional injuries must be excluded through imaging of the entire spinal axis.
Although there are multiple types of spine injuries that could result in the neurologic
deficits seen in this patient, the type of mechanism (axial load) and level of neurologic
deficit suggest that he has sustained lumbar burst fracture at or around the region
of L1. This is confirmed by the lateral radiograph and axial CT shown in Figure 27–1.
The presence of a neurologic deficit suggests that fracture fragments or displaced
soft tissues have compressed or directly injured the spinal cord and/or its roots.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

253

This patient’s injury is at the L1 level; the spinal cord typically ends somewhere
between the top of L1 and bottom of L2, so this patient could have an injury either
to the end of his spinal cord (known as the conus medullaris) or to the nerve roots
traveling to the legs from the conus medullaris (known as the cauda equina). Because
the patient demonstrates evidence of spinal shock, however, we can reason that he
has likely suffered injury to his conus medullaris. Spinal shock does not occur at
injury levels distal to the cord.
Several other orthopaedic injuries are characteristic of high-energy axial loading
mechanisms, including calcaneus fractures, femoral shaft and neck fractures, vertical shear pelvis fractures, and lumbar spine injuries. This patient has a swollen and
tender heel, likely consistent with a calcaneus fracture. Further workup and management of this extremity injury is also required.

APPROACH TO:
Lumbar Spine Fracture
DEFINITIONS
CONUS MEDULLARIS: The caudal end of the spinal cord, beneath which
nerves to the lower extremities and pelvis travel in their individual roots. The conus
medullaris is typically located between L1 and L2, although substantial variation in
its location emphasizes the importance of locating this structure for every patient
undergoing surgery on the upper lumbar spine to verify its location.
CAUDA EQUINA: The collection of nerve roots beneath the conus medullaris
that transmit signals from the spinal cord to the lower extremities and pelvis. The
nerve roots making up the cauda equina are independently mobile and can thus
tolerate a greater degree of spinal canal compression before injury when compared
with spinal levels adjacent to the spinal cord itself.
BURST FRACTURE: A type of vertebral fracture characterized by injuries to 2 or
3 “columns” of the vertebrae: the anterior column, including the anterior two thirds
of the vertebral body and the anterior longitudinal ligament; the middle column,
including the posterior third of the vertebral body and the posterior longitudinal
ligament; and the posterior column, including the facet joints, lamina, spinous processes, and interspinous ligaments. Burst fractures may injure the neural elements if
the posterior aspect of the vertebral body is pushed backward into the spinal canal.
This is known as retropulsion.
COMPRESSION FRACTURE: Similar to burst fractures, these axial loading
injuries involve fracture of the vertebral body; however, compression fractures only
involve the anterior column or anterior portion of the vertebral body. They are
inherently more stable than burst fractures and do not typically result in neurologic
deficit, as the fracture does not propagate into the spinal canal.
CHANCE FRACTURE: A spinal injury in which a flexion-distraction mechanism results in injury to all 3 spinal columns. Injuries may propagate through the
vertebral bony elements or result in partial or complete ligamentous disruption, with

254

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

forces instead tearing through the interspinous ligaments and disc space. These injuries have a high incidence of both intra-abdominal and neurologic injuries and are
associated with seatbelt restraints during violent deceleration.
SPINAL SHOCK: A temporary state of paralysis, sensory loss, and complete
absence of reflexes below the level of a spinal cord injury. Spinal shock typically
lasts 24 to 48 hours and ends when cord-mediated reflexes return, specifically the
bulbocavernosus reflex.

CLINICAL APPROACH
History and Physical Exam
Lumbar spine trauma is often the result of high-energy mechanisms, and thus all
patients should undergo a complete and thorough trauma evaluation. After the
patient has been stabilized—both hemodynamically and physically—a complete
history must be obtained, including the timing and mechanism of injury, symptoms
immediately after the injury and on arrival to the ED, and whether the patient was
moved after the initial injury. The practitioner should be wary of progressive neurologic changes, both since the initial injury and throughout the workup period in the
ED. Serial examinations are essential.
After an efficient history is obtained, physical exam should be performed. With
the patient supine, motor strength, graded 0 through 5, is tested in the upper and
lower extremities. A sensory exam is then performed to define sensory deficits
according to nerve root dermatomes. Instructions on how to perform a complete
motor, sensory, and reflex testing on patients with suspected spinal injuries are found
in the first section of this text, “The Approach to the Orthopaedic Patient.”
After neurovascular examination of the extremities, the patient is then rolled onto
his or her side so that the entire spine can be palpated for regions of tenderness, crepitus, or step-off, and a rectal exam is performed. Log-roll precautions are employed to
prevent further injury to a potentially unstable spine. During the rectal exam, the
patient is asked whether they can sense that an exam is being performed, rectal tone
is evaluated (absent, decreased, or intact), and the patient is asked to bear down as if
he or she is having a bowel movement to test volitional contraction of the external
sphincter. Finally, the bulbocavernosus reflex is tested by either pinching the glans
penis or pulling on the Foley catheter and noting whether the anal sphincter contracts.
If a patient has a spinal cord-level injury, has an absent bulbocavernosus reflex, and
is less than 48 hours from injury, he or she is considered to be in spinal shock.
In such situations, recognize that neurologic deficits may improve or resolve completely.
Patients who have a return of this reflex or patients who are more than 48 hours from
injury and have complete loss of neurologic function below the level of injury are
considered to have a complete spinal cord injury. They are thus unlikely to regain any
function below this level. Note that the bulbocavernosus reflex is only relevant for
spinal cord-level injuries and not for injuries that affect the cauda equina.

Imaging
After plain radiographs of the entire spine are obtained, areas of potential injury
should undergo further imaging. CT is helpful to define bony injury and plays an

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

255

essential role in surgical planning. MRI is useful for evaluating spinal cord compression or edema, individual nerve roots, and intervertebral discs and assessing for
ligamentous and other soft-tissue injuries. MRI is also helpful in evaluating sequelae
from direct injuries such as hematoma formation, which may result in cord compression and neurologic injury.

TREATMENT
Initial treatment consists of stabilization, immobilization, pain and spasm control,
and possibly administration of steroids. Although its true efficacy is controversial,
high-dose intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone may be indicated for patients with
nonpenetrating spinal cord injury who have presented within 8 hours of injury.
Theoretically, steroids attenuate the deleterious inflammatory processes that lead to
secondary nervous injury after primary spinal cord trauma.
The treatment of lumbar fractures depends on the stability of the fracture.
Although the exact definition is disputed, unstable fractures generally include
those with marked neurologic compromise or complete 3-column disruption
(whether bony or ligamentous) or those at risk of significant progression to
deformity.

Nonoperative Treatment
Patients with compression fractures or burst fractures without neurologic injury
and with anatomic or near anatomic alignment may be definitely treated in a
well-fitted brace. Compression fractures do not generally need surgical stabilization if they have less than 30 degrees of kyphosis or less than 40% to 50% loss of
height anteriorly. Stable burst fractures may be treated with the same criteria and
should have no greater than 40% of spinal canal compromise by retropulsed bony
fragments. Chance fractures may be treated nonoperatively if they are bony in
nature and are without significant deformity (ie, result in < 15 degrees of kyphosis). Purely bony, minimally displaced Chance fractures are amenable to nonoperative treatment because the large surface area of cancellous bone involved in
the fracture has a significantly greater chance of healing than their equivalent
ligamentous ruptures.

Operative Treatment
Generally, patients with unstable burst fractures must undergo surgical decompression and stabilization. Patients with evidence of a neurologic injury with preservation
of some function should undergo urgent decompression of compressed neural
elements and stabilization of fractured vertebral levels, preferably within 12 hours
of the injury to maximize chance of neurologic recovery. Patients without a neurologic injury may require surgical stabilization if imaging demonstrates unsatisfactory alignment or evidence of instability, as defined previously. Chance fractures
are inherently unstable and require surgical stabilization if they are ligamentous in
nature, accompanied by neurologic compromise, or result in deformity of greater
than 15 degrees of kyphosis. All patients with unstable injuries must be immobilized
in a brace until they are able to undergo surgery.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
27.1 A 44-year-old cab driver is involved in a high-speed, head-on collision. In the
ED, he is hemodynamically stable and has full neurologic function of his
lower extremities. He is complaining of severe lower back pain. Radiographs
and CT imaging are acquired of his lumbar spine. Which of the following
findings is indicative of an unstable lumbar burst fracture that may need
surgical stabilization?
A. 50% loss of vertebral height at the level of injury
B. 20 degrees of kyphosis at the level of injury
C. 30% of canal compromise
D. Injury to the anterior and middle spinal columns only
E. Injury to the posterior column only
27.2 A 43-year-old woman who fell from a third-floor balcony presents to the ED
with bilateral foot numbness as well as 2/5 bilateral extensor hallucis longus
(EHL) function and absent plantar flexion. Radiographs demonstrate an L5
burst fracture with 40% retropulsion and 30% loss of height. On further
history, the patient states she fell 4 days ago and finally sought care because
she was experiencing decreasing sensation in her groin and can no longer
void. What is the next most appropriate step in management?
A. IV high-dose corticosteroids
B. Epidural steroid injection
C. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), bedrest, and appropriate bracing
D. Surgical anterior decompression with fusion
E. Surgical posterior decompressive lumbar laminectomy without fusion
27.3 A 56-year-old male rock climber falls 8 feet from a ledge and lands on his
buttocks. He arrives 6 hours later in the ED and complains of lower back pain.
He is completely neurologically intact. Imaging of his lumbar spine shows
an L3 burst fracture involving both anterior and middle columns with 30%
loss of height anteriorly and minimal retropulsion. He has no other injuries.
What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
A. IV steroids and appropriate bracing
B. Low-dose narcotics, NSAIDs, and appropriate bracing
C. Surgical decompression with fusion
D. Further imaging must be obtained, including an MRI to rule out spinal
cord injury
E. Reassurance and activity modification

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

257

ANSWERS
27.1 A. Lumbar burst fractures are considered unstable and indicate surgical stabilization if they involve all 3 columns, result in > 40% to 50% loss of height
or > 30 degrees of kyphosis, or have > 40% canal compromise. Burst fractures
by definition are not exclusive to the posterior elements.
27.2 D. Although there are details suggesting that this patient’s burst fracture may
be stable (ie, only 40% retropulsion and only 30% loss of height), her progressive neurologic symptoms are indication for surgical intervention. E is incorrect because it does not address the fracture or provide stabilization, as would
an anterior decompression and fusion. Local epidural steroids do not address
the fracture. IV steroids are controversial; however, they are not indicated
greater than 8 hours from injury.
27.3 B. This patient has a stable burst fracture involving only the anterior and middle
columns without significant loss of height or angulation. The appropriate treatment is pain control (narcotics are appropriate given his acute painful injury)
and brace immobilization. Because the injury is stable and because he has no
neurologic disruption, he does not necessarily need surgical stabilization, nor
does he need extensive, expensive imaging such as an MRI. The patient may
be reassured and should certainly refrain periodically from rock climbing, but
requires a minimum of brace immobilization until the fracture has healed.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Patients with injuries secondary to axial-loading mechanisms should be
evaluated for additional associated injuries, such as calcaneus fractures
and lumbar burst fractures.



A careful physical exam, including testing of the bulbocavernosus reflex,
gives valuable information about whether neurologic injury has occurred
and whether or not the patient is in spinal shock.



Patients with incomplete neurologic injuries (preservation of motor or
sensory function below the level of the injury) should undergo urgent
decompression and stabilization of the injury to maximize the likelihood
of neurologic improvement or preservation.

ANSWERS TO CASE 28:
Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
Summary: A healthy 12-year-old girl presents with mild back pain, shoulder
asymmetry, and a 7-degree rotational deformity of her thoracic spine. She has
recently experienced menarche and has no other complaints. Neurologic exam
is unremarkable.
• Most likely diagnosis: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).
• Next diagnostic step: Standing 36-in posteroanterior (PA) and lateral spine
radiographs.
• Treatment options: Observation, brace treatment, surgical spinal fusion.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the common presentation and characteristics of patients with AIS.
2. Recognize pertinent negatives that distinguish idiopathic scoliosis from scoliosis
caused by other etiologies.
3. Consider the factors that lead to the decision making in the treatment algorithm
of scoliosis.

Considerations
This 12-year-old girl depicts a classic presentation of a patient with AIS, a disease
characterized by both abnormal curvature and rotation of the spine from an unknown
cause. This is an otherwise healthy adolescent, like most patients with idiopathic
scoliosis. This patient is also female, representing the 8:1 female-to-male ratio of
patients with scoliosis large enough in magnitude to require treatment. Often, concerns of both patients and parents are not of pain or dysfunction, but of cosmetic
appearance. Shoulder, trunk, and flank asymmetry can be very noticeable and can
significantly harm the self-image of the patient. The goals of treatment are to prevent long-term complications of cardiovascular and pulmonary dysfunction, which
tend to present later with curve progression in adulthood. Surgical intervention in
adults carries greater risk of morbidity.
In addition to her deformity, the patient’s complaints of back pain should not be
ignored. Although rare, physicians must first rule out potential pathologic causes of
scoliosis, as AIS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Both the history and physical exam,
with judicious use of radiologic and laboratory studies, should be used to evaluate for
other potential causes of back pain, including osteomyelitis, discitis, spondylolysis,
disc herniation, or even skeletal and mesenchymal-derived tumors.
Several red flags may arise in the workup of a patient with scoliosis that warrant further evaluation, including history of fever or constitutional symptoms,
unexplained weight loss, neurologic abnormalities, pain unrelated to activity, and/or

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

261

pain at night. Idiopathic scoliosis is typically characterized by thoracic dextroscoliosis, or a right-sided thoracic curve. Particular attention should be paid
to atypical curve patterns such as levoscoliosis (left-sided curve), juvenile-onset
deformities (< 10 years of age at time of diagnosis), hyperkyphosis (a sharp posterior-facing or “hunchback” curve), and large curves without rotational deformities.
Spinal deformity can be the initial presenting complaint for patients with central
nervous system anomalies such as Arnold-Chiari malformations, syringomyelia,
diastematomyelia, tethered cords, or central nervous system tumors. Neuromuscular scoliosis is the second most common type of scoliosis, following AIS, and
often occurs in patients with cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and other neurologic disorders. Scoliosis may also occur secondary to underlying genetic diseases
such as neurofibromatosis, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, or as secondary to previous spine trauma. On occasion, subclinical
neuromuscular diseases such as mild cerebral palsy and Charcot Marie Tooth disease can remain unrecognized into adolescence but be an underlying cause of scoliosis. Alterations in the neurologic exam, unexplained pain, and atypical curve
patterns should raise suspicion that the spinal deformity is not idiopathic. In such
situations, the physician must obtain further diagnostic imaging such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire spine and/or ultrasound exams to evaluate
for common congenital correlates to malformed vertebrae (ie, renal ultrasound,
cardiac echocardiogram).

APPROACH TO:
Scoliosis
DEFINITIONS
SCOLIOSIS: Defined by greater than 10 degrees of curvature of the spine in the
coronal plane. Although measured on a 2-dimensional x-ray, scoliosis is typically a
3-dimensional process with rotational deformities. It is commonly measured using
the Cobb method.
KYPHOSIS: A deformity in the sagittal plane characterized by apex-posterior
curvature of the spine. A small degree of kyphosis is normal and should measure
between 20 and 40 degrees in the thoracic spine.
COBB ANGLE: The angle subtended by lines drawn through vertebral endplates
at each point of curve inflection. Cobb angles are typically measured on standing
full-length spine x-rays.
PEAK GROWTH VELOCITY: The skeletal growth spurt usually seen early in
the second decade of life. Progression of scoliosis curves is at highest risk during
this time.
RISSER SIGN: The ossification of the iliac apophysis, seen on coronal radiographs.
Graded from 0 through 5, based on quartiles of the total length of the iliac crest with
ossified from lateral to medial. Ossification is a marker of skeletal maturity and can
thus be used to determine the likelihood of curve progression.

262

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
Scoliosis is defined by greater than 10 degrees of spinal curvature in the coronal
plane; less than 10 degrees of curvature is termed spinal asymmetry. Although it
is typically observed on 2-dimensional x-rays, scoliosis is actually a 3-dimensional
rotational deformity of the vertebral column. Although adolescent idiopathic
scoliosis is the most commonly seen presentation of scoliosis, it is a diagnosis of
exclusion. To diagnose scoliosis, less common, but more insidious, causes must be
investigated.
The etiology of scoliosis is best described as multifactorial. Hereditary studies
have shown an increased incidence of scoliosis within families, but penetrance is
variable. Several genes have been implicated in the etiology for scoliosis, but clinical results are inconclusive for a single gene responsible for the condition. Similarly,
hormonal and neuromuscular etiologies have been implicated, but current research
has failed to demonstrate conclusive independent causation.

Clinical Presentation of Scoliosis
The majority of patients with AIS present with complaints of cosmesis. Only in cases
of severe curve magnitude (≥ 80 degrees) is evidence of cardiovascular or pulmonary
dysfunction seen in adolescents. Often, patients’ curves have first been observed
by classmates, physical education teachers, school nurses, or found incidentally on
routine exams by pediatricians. Pain associated with scoliosis is common in adulthood but is rare in adolescence. Complete gestational and birth history as well
as neurologic developmental milestone achievement should be reviewed, along with
a detailed physical and neurologic exam at the initial visit. Radiographic imaging
should be performed at regular intervals to monitor for progression of the curve with
consideration given to the cumulative radiation dose to which the patient will be
exposed.

TREATMENT
Treatment is defined by the likelihood of curve progression during both adolescence
and adulthood. Most AIS patients are healthy and active despite sometimes pronounced deformities. When discussing the natural history of scoliosis with patients
and their families, the consequences of curve progression into adulthood and its
effects on cardiopulmonary health must be discussed. Such dysfunctions are often
absent in the asymptomatic adolescent, but may manifest later in life with significant morbidity.
Generally, AIS patients with curves of less than 20 degrees are managed with
clinical observation and intermittent radiographic follow-up if the curve is at high
risk of progression. Brace treatment is indicated for AIS patients with curve magnitudes of 25 to 40 degrees and who are still growing. Patients most likely to benefit
from bracing include premenarchal girls, girls or boys in or before their peak height
velocity, or girls or boys with less than 50% of iliac apophysis ossification (ie, Risser
stage of 0, 1, or 2). As stated, curve magnitude increases at the greatest rate during the
period of peak growth velocity. Remember to discuss with patients that the realistic

goal for brace treatment is not to correct the spinal curvature, but to prevent it
from increasing in magnitude. The best prognostic indicator for successful scoliosis
bracing is the ability to immediately improve the prebracing radiographic curve by
50% when the first brace is applied. Braces must be worn at a minimum of 16 to
23 hours per day, and, not surprisingly, patient compliance is a considerable issue.
AIS curves greater than 50 degrees are a potential indication for spinal fusion
surgery. Natural history studies of AIS suggest the greatest increased risk of progression
into adulthood when curves are beyond 50 degrees. The primary goal of AIS surgical
treatment is to halt the progression of deformity by achieving a solid fusion of the
spine. Additional surgical goals include the sparing of spinal motion segments wherever possible, obtaining a pain-free spine, and correcting as much of the curvature
as is safely possible. Surgical spinal fusion typically involves a combination of bone
grafting and instrumentation to fix the curved spine into a rigid structure. Surgical
approaches may be posterior, anterior, or combined in cases of severe disease. Instrumentation used to hold the fusion may include rods, pedicle screws, hooks, wires,
and other implants (Figure 28–1).

Complications
Spinal fusion procedures are often long, painful, and highly morbid procedures with
significant blood loss, requiring transfusion and/or the use of intraoperative blood salvage techniques. Early wound infection (1%-2%), pseudoarthrosis (1%-2%), painful
prominent hardware, and hardware breakage are described complications. The most
devastating but rare complication is iatrogenic neurologic injury. Intraoperative

264

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

neurologic monitoring may help prevent this. A crankshaft phenomenon may occur
when an immature spine is fused posteriorly, but continues to grow anteriorly, causing the expanding spine to spiral around the posterior fusion. This may be prevented
with concomitant anterior fusion.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
28.1 A 10-year-old healthy girl is referred to your office after testing positive for
scoliosis during a schoolwide screening. Physical exam is unremarkable except
for absence of her abdominal reflex on the right side. Standing 36-in scoliosis
radiographs show a 25-degree levoscoliosis curve with minimal rotation and
hyperkyphosis. She is Risser 0 developmental stage on x-ray. What is the next
step in management?
A. Reassure and observe with clinical and radiographic examination in 3 to
4 months
B. Fitting for a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO)
C. Obtain a bone scan
D. Obtain an MRI of the entire central nervous system
E. Book patient for spinal fusion after obtaining appropriate consent
28.2 A 15-year-old male athlete presents for evaluation of shoulder asymmetry
pointed out by his football teammates. His mother had never noticed the discrepancy until now but is very concerned. The boy has a 15-degree right-sided
trunk rotation on the Adam forward-bending test. His neurologic examination is unremarkable. Thirty-six inch PA standing scoliosis radiographs show
a 60-degree right thoracic curve and shoulder elevation 2 cm greater on the
right than left. What is the next step in management?
A. Trial nonoperative treatment with a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO)
B. Reassure and observe patient with repeat clinical and radiographic evaluation in 3 to 4 months
C. Obtain an MRI of the entire central nervous system
D. Obtain a bone scan and laboratory studies for evidence of underlying
pathology including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein,
and complete blood count
E. Book patient for spinal fusion after obtaining appropriate consent
28.3 A 15-year-old girl has asymptomatic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Her parents ask you how debilitated she might be compared with her peers who do not
have scoliosis. Which of the following is true regarding the natural history of
idiopathic scoliosis?
A. Difficulty with pregnancy
B. Increased risk of developing cancer
C. Acute or chronic back pain
D. Athletic limitations

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

265

ANSWERS
28.1 D. Atypical curve patterns require MRI evaluation of the spine and central
nervous system for workup of underlying pathology. Bone scans, although useful for diagnosing infection or subacute bony injury, are not sensitive to other
potential pathology etiologies. Bracing and observation are inappropriate
without first ruling out a pathologic etiology.
28.2 E. Spinal fusion is indicated in curves measuring greater than 50 degrees.
Although workup with MRI or laboratory studies is necessary when patients
have evidence of pathologic etiology for scoliosis, patients without concerning symptoms do not require such an extensive workup. This patient’s curve is
too great in magnitude to be managed with observation or with bracing.
28.3 C. Scoliotic patients have been found to have more acute or chronic back
pain, as well as cosmetic concerns. Pregnancy complications, athletic limitations, and an increased cancer risk are not associated with AIS.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning physicians must rule out potential congenital, neuromuscular, traumatic, or
syndromic etiologies before making the diagnosis.



The risk of scoliosis curve progression is greatest during early adolescence when the peak growth velocity occurs.



Among many non-AIS causes of back pain in adolescents are discitis,
herniated disks, osteoid osteoma, lymphoma, and spondylolysis.



Scoliosis bracing is indicated for adolescents in their peak height velocity
or those who have not yet reached their peak height velocity, as well as
patients with significant curve magnitudes (> 25-40 degrees) and those
in Risser 0 through 2 stages of skeletal maturity.



Spinal fusion surgery is generally indicated for patients with progressive
curves greater than 50 degrees.

CASE 29
A 47-year-old right-hand dominant female presents to the clinic with a 2-month
history of intermittent numbness and tingling in her right hand, specifically the
index and middle fingers. She often finds the symptoms worst when using her
computer and when driving home. Her symptoms are significantly affecting her
career as a journalist. She also complains of pain in the same distribution that
wakes her up almost nightly. She denies any history of trauma. Her past medical
history is significant only for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), which is well controlled with oral agents. She does not smoke and drinks 1 or 2 glasses of wine
on occasion, and her body mass index is 32 kg/m2. Physical examination reveals
a slightly overweight but otherwise healthy-appearing female. Both of her upper
extremities appear normal, with no obvious signs of trauma. On her right hand,
there is a palpable 2+ radial pulse and a normal Allen test. Two-point discrimination is measured at 8 mm on both the radial and ulnar borders of the index
and middle fingers as well as the radial border of the ring finger. There is normal
(< 5 mm) 2-point discrimination on the ulnar border of the ring finger and on both
sides of the small finger. Sensation in the palm is normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 29:
Carpel Tunnel Syndrome
Summary: A 47-year-old woman with a history of well-controlled type 2 DM has
complaints of worsening numbness and tingling in her right hand for 2 months. She
works as a journalist, spending much of her time on a computer. She has no history
of trauma and is otherwise healthy. Vital signs are normal, and physical exam is
remarkable for decreased 2-point discrimination on her index and middle fingers,
as well as the radial side of her ring finger.
• Most likely diagnosis: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
• Diagnostic testing: An electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction studies
may help confirm the diagnosis. EMG studies may show an increase in motor
and/or sensory latency across the wrist. Up to 10% of patients with clinical
symptomatology, however, have normal EMG studies.
• Initial management: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), if not
contraindicated, and night splinting are the best initial management strategy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathoanatomy responsible for carpal tunnel syndrome.
2. Describe the physical exam findings of carpal tunnel syndrome.
3. Recognize underlying conditions (both physiologic and pathologic) that may
predispose one to carpal tunnel syndrome.
4. Distinguish carpal tunnel syndrome from other diseases or conditions that may
mimic its presentation.
5. Understand the conservative and surgical treatment options for carpal tunnel
syndrome and their indications.

Considerations
For any patient with acute neurologic complaints isolated to an extremity, it is
important to first rule out trauma as an underlying cause. This patient denies a
history of trauma, is without significant medical comorbidities, and appears reliable, so further imaging is unlikely to aid the diagnosis. In patients with complicated, unclear, or unreliable histories, radiographs may help eliminate several causes
of neurologic symptoms such as fractures, deformities, congenital abnormalities,
masses, and other lesions.
There are other conditions that may mimic carpal tunnel syndrome, but can
often be distinguished with a thorough physical exam and history. Traumatic conditions such as a distal radius fracture or scaphoid fracture may present with some
symptoms that overlap with those of carpal tunnel syndrome, but would likely

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

269

be discovered with adequate workup. More proximal nerve pathologies such as
cervical radiculopathy or proximal median nerve compression should have additional findings not found in isolated carpal tunnel syndrome, such as paresthesias
in the thenar distribution, and would not have positive test findings on provocative tests aimed at eliciting symptoms within the carpal canal (ie, Phalen, Tinel,
and Durkan signs). Cubital tunnel syndrome has similar pathology and presentation to carpal tunnel syndrome, but in a different nerve distribution. If the
patient fails conservative management, carpal tunnel release surgery is very effective at alleviating symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. If performed early, surgical decompression can prevent permanent denervation of the thenar muscles
and halt further deterioration of symptoms. In many operative cases, sensation is
restored and symptoms resolve. With regard to operative technique, the results
from open and endoscopic surgery are comparable.

APPROACH TO:
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
DEFINITIONS
CARPAL TUNNEL: A narrow canal in the volar (palmar) wrist that typically
contains the median nerve, superficial and deep finger flexor tendons, and the long
flexor tendon of the thumb.
GUYON CANAL: Also known as the ulnar tunnel, this volar wrist canal is located
just ulnar (medial) to the carpal tunnel and contains the ulnar artery and ulnar
nerve. Compression within this tunnel can lead to a similar syndrome to carpal tunnel, with symptoms instead found in an ulnar nerve distribution.
MEDIAN NERVE COMPRESSION SYNDROME: A spectrum of compression
neuropathies of the median nerve with varying names and symptoms, depending
on the location of pathology. When the nerve is compressed proximally, most commonly between the two heads of the pronator teres muscle, it is called pronator
teres syndrome, and is characterized by volar hand and forearm numbness as well as
potential weaknesses in the thumb flexors and distal flexors of the index and middle
fingers. The median nerve can be compressed in several key locations, the most
distal of which is in the carpal tunnel.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Relevant Anatomy
The carpal tunnel can be described exactly as it is named—as a tunnel (or canal)
passing through the wrist. Understanding the anatomy of the canal, including its
borders and its contents, is key to understanding the basis of carpal tunnel syndrome.
The carpal canal is formed by the transverse carpal ligament volarly (palmar), the
scaphoid and trapezium radially, and the hamate and triquetrum ulnarly. Within
the canal passes the median nerve and 9 flexor tendons: 4 tendons of the flexor

270

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

digitorum profundus (FDP), 4 tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS),
and the single tendon of the flexor pollicis longus (FPL).
The median nerve is responsible for sensation to the volar (palmar) surface of the
thumb, index finger, long finger, and the radial (lateral) half of the ring finger. The
sensation of the palm and thenar eminence is normal in carpal tunnel syndrome
because the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve arises proximal to the carpal
tunnel and crosses the wrist superficial to the transverse carpal ligament to give sensation to the palm. In most instances, the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve
comes off the median nerve distal to the nerves coursing within the canal, so that
compressive effects on the median nerve may also affect the recurrent motor branch.
Decreasing the effective size of the canal (ie, prolonged or repetitive wrist flexion/
extension, etc) or increasing the relative size of the canal’s contents (ie, flexor tendon inflammation/swelling) can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. This explains why
many patients with carpal tunnel syndrome complain of worsened symptoms at
night, as it is thought that most people sleep with their wrists in a flexed position.

Diagnosis
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, meaning the diagnosis is based primarily on history and physical exam findings, with adjunctive tests such as EMG
studies used to confirm—but never make—the diagnosis. Physical exam findings
such as decreased sensation and 2-point discrimination in the distribution of
the median nerve at the fingers with sparing of sensation of the thenar eminence and palm are pathognomic for carpal tunnel syndrome. Tinel sign involves
percussion over the median nerve at the wrist, and Phalen sign involves holding the
wrist in flexion for 1 minute. Both tests are positive if they result in reproduction of symptoms. The Durkan test, or carpal tunnel compression test, is
performed with the examiner holding pressure over the patient’s carpal tunnel,
while distracting the patient. Reproduction of symptoms within 30 seconds of
compression is considered positive. Although the patient in this case does not
describe weakness or atrophy of the thenar musculature, a decrease in pinch/grip
strength may occur in more advanced stages of carpal tunnel syndrome.
EMG studies may help clarify the diagnosis of CTS. Such studies may demonstrate a latency and/or asymmetry between the affected and nonaffected hands.
Many normal physiologic and/or pathologic conditions may promote the onset of
carpal tunnel syndrome. These include, but are not limited to, pregnancy, type
2 DM, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and hypothyroidism. The mechanisms by which
these conditions cause carpal tunnel syndrome are not fully understood. However,
each condition is thought to promote a state of inflammation and thus elevated
pressure within the carpal canal. Patients should be evaluated for potential underlying causes of carpal tunnel syndrome. Underlying etiologies, if present, must be
addressed prior to operative treatment.

TREATMENT
When carpal tunnel syndrome is diagnosed, the most conservative mode of
treatment is attempted first. Nighttime symptoms are often the result of the

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

271

naturally-flexed position of the resting wrist. Removable splints that hold the
wrist in neutral, the position in which the carpal tunnel is least compressed,
are usually effective at reducing symptoms. Additionally, anti-inflammatories
(NSAIDs) are an effective treatment option. In patients whose symptoms are
not sufficiently relieved by these options, corticosteroid injections directly into
the carpal tunnel may be an option. Local steroid therapy may provide transient
relief; however, symptoms often return. Note that there is prognostic value to
such therapies, as patients who respond well to steroid injections have a greater
chance of successful relief from surgery.
The definitive treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome refractory to conservative
management is a carpal tunnel release. This involves releasing the transverse carpal
ligament using either a direct open or endoscopic technique. Carpal tunnel release
is a relatively fast outpatient procedure with generally low complication rates and
excellent outcomes.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
29.1 A 43-year-old health care worker complains of nocturnal wrist pain and has
significant pain when pressure is applied to her volar wrist for more than
10 seconds. Which of the following structures is not usually contained within
the carpal tunnel?
A. Tendon(s) of FDP
B. Tendon(s) of FPL
C. Palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve
D. Tendon(s) of FDS
E. Motor fibers of the median nerve
29.2 A 52-year-old retired woman is referred to your clinic with complaints of
numbness and tingling in her left (dominant) hand worse at night for the
past 3 months. She also complains of significant fatigue and 10-lb weight gain
over the same period of time. She denies any medical history and takes no
medications. On exam, she is overweight and appears somewhat lethargic,
but appears healthy otherwise. On her left hand she has decreased 2-point
discrimination on her index and middle fingers. Her grip strength is normal,
and she has no thenar atrophy. What is the next best step in management of
this patient?
A. Left hand carpal tunnel release
B. EMG/nerve conduction velocity studies of left upper extremity

29.3 A 56-year-old postmenopausal woman is seen in the clinic with complaints
of mild numbness and tingling in her right hand, most notably in the index
and middle fingers. She takes medication for osteoporosis but is otherwise
healthy. Her history is unremarkable except for a wrist fracture after a fall
onto her right hand 2 years ago that was fixed with open reduction internal
fixation. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated. Physical examination
in the office reveals a well-healed surgical incision on the volar aspect of her
wrist, normal grip strength, and no sensory deficits. X-rays reveal hardware in
adequate alignment, with evidence of bony union at a previous distal radius
fracture site. What is the next best step in her management?
A. Provision cast immobilization and follow-up x-ray for occult refracture
B. MRI of right wrist
C. Emergency surgical release of transverse carpal ligament
D. NSAID administration with close follow-up
E. Serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, complete blood
count, and wrist aspiration, with cytologic analysis, Gram stain, and culture
of aspirate

ANSWERS
29.1 C. The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve is given off approximately 5 cm proximally to the carpal tunnel in most patients. This explains
why patients with carpal tunnel syndrome typically have sparing of sensation of the thenar/palmar aspect of the affected hand. The motor fibers of the
median nerve branch off distally to the tunnel, and as a result, patients may
exhibit weakness and/or atrophy of the thenar musculature. The 9 flexor tendons of FDP, FDS, and FPL are all contained within the carpal tunnel.
29.2 D. The patient in this question does exhibit symptoms of carpal tunnel
syndrome. However, her history and physical exam also point strongly to
undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Further workup and treatment of her metabolic condition should be performed before intervention of her carpal tunnel
symptoms.
29.3 D. Distal radius fractures and subsequent fixation are associated with a number of potential complications, including iatrogenic carpal tunnel syndrome of
variable severity. In this case, the patient does have postoperative symptoms
that are consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, but they are mild and intermittent. Acute or emergency carpal tunnel release is not indicated. There are
no signs of infection or refracture, and cast immobilization may exacerbate her
symptoms. MRI of the wrist would not likely provide any new information.
The correct choice would be conservative management with close follow-up
to monitor for change in symptoms.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

273

CLINICAL PEARLS


The carpal tunnel is an effectively closed space, containing the median
nerve, among other structures. Any reduction in volume of this finite
space can lead to increased pressure upon, and thus dysfunction of, the
median nerve. This results in carpal tunnel syndrome.



Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, made by history and physical
exam findings; adjunctive tests such as EMG studies may be used to
confirm, but never make, the diagnosis.



Other neurologic conditions or injuries may be differentiated from carpal
tunnel syndrome by thorough history and physical exam, including exact
localization of motor and sensory symptoms.



Conservative management should always be attempted before operative
treatment of CTS. If conservative management fails, surgical carpal tunnel
release is performed with either open or endoscopic techniques. Both methods are associated with excellent outcomes.

CASE 30
A 45-year-old right-hand dominant woman presents to the orthopaedic hand
clinic with a 6-month history of right hand numbness and tingling. She denies
any trauma or inciting incident but reports that she noticed the numbness and
tingling after waking up one morning. The symptoms come and go throughout
the day and are worse in the night time, waking her up 3 to 4 times a week. Over
the past month, her symptoms have gotten progressively worse, with some days
of constant numbness. She denies any symptoms in her neck, shoulder, or arm.
She denies any pain. She reports feeling weaker in her right hand, especially with
opening a bottle or buttoning her shirt. Over the last few months, her right hand
has fatigued faster than her left.
On physical exam, she has full active range of motion of her neck, right shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers. Focused exam of her right upper extremity reveals
no gross deformity or muscle atrophy. She has ulnar deviation of her small ringer.
There is no erythema, ecchymosis, or effusions. She localizes her numbness to
her ring and small fingers and cannot discern whether the symptoms are dorsal
or volar. On strength testing, she has 5/5 strength of her biceps, triceps, wrist
extensors/flexors, thumb extensors/flexors, and flexors of her index and middle
finger. She has 3/5 strength of her hand intrinsics and the flexors of her ring and
small finger. She has normal sensation to light touch but decreased sensation to
pinprick over the volar and dorsal ulnar aspect of her hand. She has a 2+ radial
pulse and normal Allen test. Elbow, wrist, and hand radiographs are negative for
any pathology.

ANSWERS TO CASE 30:
Cubital Tunnel Syndrome
Summary: A 45-year-old right-hand dominant woman presents with 6 months of
right hand numbness, tingling, and now weakness. She denies any history of trauma
or specific inciting event and states that her symptoms have worsened over the
last month. On exam there is no gross deformity or muscle atrophy of her right
upper extremity, but weakness of her intrinsics and ring and small finger flexors is
observed. She also has decreased sensation to pinprick over the volar and dorsal
ulnar aspect of her hand.
• Most likely diagnosis: Cubital tunnel syndrome.
• Affected muscles: Flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), hand intrinsics (lumbricals for
ring and small finger, dorsal interossei, palmar interossei), hypothenar muscles
(palmaris brevis, abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi, flexor digiti
minimi), flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) for ring and small finger, adductor
pollicis, deep head of flexor pollicis brevis.
• Next diagnostic step: Electrodiagnostic testing.
• Treatment options: Nonsurgical options include bracing, activity modifications,
and physical therapy, whereas surgery involves ulnar nerve decompression at the
cubital tunnel.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the anatomy of the ulnar nerve and the potential sites of compression.
2. Understand the physical exam findings and electromyelogram (EMG) analysis
associated with ulnar nerve entrapment.
3. Know the treatment options for cubital tunnel syndrome.

Considerations
This 45-year-old woman presents complaining of symptoms concerning for an
entrapment neuropathy. The first priority is to perform a thorough history, which
will help in narrowing down the possible diagnoses. This patient denies any trauma
or inciting event, and her symptoms (right hand numbness, tingling, and weakness), which have become more constant over the last month, typically wax and
wane throughout the day and are most severe at night. Given this history, the practitioner must consider the entrapment neuropathies of the upper extremity in the
differential diagnosis. This includes carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndromes.
A focused physical exam of the right upper extremity will further aid the clinician
in determining the diagnosis. This includes ruling out cervical spine pathology that
can cause similar symptoms, as well as a brachial plexopathy. In this specific case, for
which ulnar nerve entrapment is likely, plain radiographs should be obtained and

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

277

electrodiagnostic testing performed. Treatment options can then be discussed pending confirmation of the diagnosis of cubital tunnel syndrome.

APPROACH TO:
Cubital Tunnel Syndrome
DEFINITIONS
TINEL TEST: A way to detect irritated nerves. It is performed by lightly tapping or
percussing over a given nerve to elicit a sensation of “tingling” or “pins and needles”
in the distribution of the nerve.
FROMENT SIGN: A test for ulnar nerve palsy that specifically assesses the action
of the adductor pollicis (ulnar nerve innervated). The patient is asked to hold a
piece of paper between the thumb and index finger. Normally, as the examiner
attempts to pull the paper away, an individual will be able to maintain a hold on the
paper with little or no difficulty. However, the patient with ulnar nerve palsy will
flex the thumb via the flexor pollicis longus (innervated by the anterior interosseous
branch of the median nerve) to try to maintain a hold on the paper.
WARTENBERG SIGN: A sign noting the position of abduction and extension
assumed by the small finger in the setting of cubital tunnel syndrome.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Anatomy
Cubital tunnel syndrome, the second most common upper-extremity compressive neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome, is a term used to describe symptoms
related to ulnar nerve compression and/or traction around the elbow. Cubital tunnel
syndrome includes any ulnar neuropathy in the mid-arm to mid-forearm.
The ulnar nerve is the terminal branch of the medial cord of the brachial plexus
(C8-T1). The nerve courses between the medial head of the triceps and the brachialis muscle before coursing posterior to the medial epicondyle and entering the
cubital tunnel. The tunnel’s anatomic borders are as follows: Anterior, medial epicondyle; posterior, olecranon; floor, medial collateral ligament; roof, arcuate
ligament. After leaving the cubital tunnel, the ulnar nerve passes into the forearm
between the 2 heads of the FCU and exits under the deep flexor pronator aponeurosis. At this point it lies deep to the FDS and FCU and superficial to the FDP.
There are several major sites at which the ulnar nerve often becomes compressed
(Figure 30–1):
1. Arcade of Struthers: Band of fascia connecting the medial head of the triceps
with the medial intermuscular septum, approximately 7 to 10 cm proximal to the
medial epicondyle
2. Medial intermuscular septum
3. Medial head of triceps: Can become hypertrophied in bodybuilders

4. Medial epicondyle: Can cause compressive or traction forces via deformity from
a prior supracondylar fracture (Tardy ulnar nerve palsy owing to development of
progressive valgus deformity associated with these fractures) or osteophytes in an
arthritic elbow
5. Arcuate ligament: The roof of the cubital tunnel
6. Osborne fascia: This is the proximal fibrous edge of the FCU and most common
site of ulnar nerve compression
7. Epicondylar groove: A shallow groove increasing risk of ulnar nerve subluxation;
a site where external compression can occur from leaning on a flexed elbow for
prolonged period of time
8. Anconeus epitrochlearis: Accessory muscle arising from medial olecranon and
triceps and inserting on the medial epicondyle; seen in 10% of patients undergoing cubital tunnel release
9. Deep flexor pronator aponeurosis

Physical Exam
Patients often present with poorly localized numbness and tingling in their hand.
At times they are able to localize the symptoms in an ulnar nerve distribution.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

279

The symptoms can be occasional or constant and exacerbated by elbow flexion.
With longstanding ulnar nerve compression, patients may have wasting of their
intrinsic muscles and hand weakness. An intrinsic minus or claw hand (hyperextension of the metacarpal phalangeal joints and flexion of the proximal and distal
interphalangeal joints) may result from longstanding compression. Look for a Wartenberg sign (ulnar deviation of the small finger)—patients complain of inability to
put their hand in their pocket or their small finger getting caught on things. Patients
may have weakness of their pinch and compensate by flexing the thumb interphalangeal joint during pinching (Froment sign).
Patients may complain of medial elbow pain and have a positive Tinel test (exacerbation of the ulnar hand numbness by tapping on the ulnar nerve). It is important
to do a thorough neck and shoulder exam to rule out nerve compression proximal
to the elbow. This includes cervical range of motion to evaluate for associated pain
and/or radiculopathy. Range the elbow and evaluate for ulnar nerve subluxation.
The functional range of motion of the elbow is 30 to 130 degrees. The normal
carrying angle is 7 to 15 degrees. Sensation in the hand should also be examined.
Radiographs of the elbow should be evaluated for osseous causes of compression
(ie, osteophytes). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although not typically indicated, can identify space-occupying lesions or edema within the nerve. Electrodiagnostic testing, which includes EMG and nerve conduction studies, is the gold
standard to evaluate for ulnar neuropathy. Nerve conduction studies are considered
positive if the motor conduction velocity across the elbow is less than 52 m/s, increased
distal sensory latency of greater than 3.2 ms, and motor latencies of greater than
5.3 ms. Of note, abnormal EMG results are associated with poor surgical outcomes.

TREATMENT
To determine the appropriate treatment for a patient with cubital tunnel syndrome,
the following considerations must be taken into account: patient compliance, worker’s
compensation, occupation, age, comorbidities, duration of symptoms, and severity
of symptoms. Additionally, the orthopaedist must be certain that other causes of the
patient’s symptoms have been ruled out and that concurrent carpal tunnel syndrome
(present in 40% of patients with cubital tunnel syndrome) is not present, which
often requires simultaneous release.
For patients with mild cubital tunnel syndrome, nonsurgical options can alleviate
symptoms and help prevent long-term nerve damage. A splint that keeps the elbow
at approximately 70 degrees of flexion, especially when worn at night, can alleviate symptom exacerbation. Physical therapy (PT) that works on nerve mobilization
and gliding, in addition to activity modification, can also aid in symptom relief.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as soft elbow padding can
also be used.
For patients with constant numbness/tingling, muscle atrophy, muscle weakness,
or severe slowing of conduction velocity, surgical intervention is recommended.
Surgery includes decompressing the nerve with or without transposition. This is
achieved via in situ decompression (decompressing the nerve and leaving it where
it is), subcutaneous transposition (moving the nerve anterior to the medial epicondyle), intramuscular transposition (moving the nerve into an area surrounded by the
flexor-pronator muscles), submuscular transposition (moving the nerve under the

280

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

flexor-pronator muscles), and medial epicondylectomy (removing part of the medial
epicondyle). The cubital tunnel can also be released endoscopically.
Most cases of cubital tunnel syndrome requiring surgical intervention can
be treated with in situ decompression. There are inherent risks with nerve transposition, including compromised blood supply, nerve scarring, injury to adjacent
structures, and a longer incision. Studies have shown that in situ decompression
is adequate for most patients and has equivalent outcomes to decompression with
transposition. Patients with a hypermobile nerve will likely benefit from moving the
nerve to a new location.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
30.1 A 40-year-old left-hand dominant man presents with an 8-month history
of left hand numbness, tingling, and now weakness. On exam, you note a
positive Froment sign. The patient subsequently undergoes electrodiagnostic
testing, which is consistent with cubital tunnel syndrome. The cubital tunnel
is formed by which structures?
A. Anterior, lateral epicondyle; posterior, olecranon; floor, medial collateral
ligament; roof, arcuate ligament
B. Anterior, medial epicondyle; posterior, olecranon; floor, medial collateral
ligament; roof, arcuate ligament
C. Anterior, lateral epicondyle; posterior, olecranon; floor, lateral collateral
ligament; roof, arcuate ligament
D. Anterior, medial epicondyle; posterior, humerus; floor, medial collateral
ligament; roof, arcuate ligament
30.2 A 50-year-old man complains of numbness and tingling along his right small
finger. Elbow flexion reproduces the numbness and tingling. Physical therapy
and splinting have failed to relieve the symptoms over the last 3 months.
Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?
A. In situ ulnar nerve decompression at the cubital tunnel
B. Ulnar nerve decompression at the cubital tunnel with anterior submuscular transposition
C. Ulnar nerve decompression at the cubital tunnel with anterior subcutaneous transposition
D. Continued physical therapy, splinting, and conservative management
30.3 An amateur bodybuilder presents with physical examination findings concerning for an ulnar nerve compression neuropathy. Which of the following
anatomic locations is more commonly associated with ulnar nerve compression in bodybuilders as compared with the regular population?
A. Osborne fascia
B. Arcuate ligament
C. Medial epicondyle
D. Medial head of the triceps

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

281

ANSWERS
30.1 B. The cubital tunnel is formed by the medial epicondyle anteriorly and the
olecranon posteriorly. The medial collateral ligament forms the floor, and the
roof consists of the arcuate ligament.
30.2 A. The patient has cubital tunnel syndrome that has failed conservative management. In situ decompression of the ulnar nerve is less invasive and has clinical
outcomes equivalent to that of decompression with transposition. Decompression
with transposition has also been shown to have higher complication rates.
30.3 D. All of the choices are possible sites of ulnar nerve compression, even in
bodybuilders. However, hypertrophy of the medial head of the triceps in this
population can cause ulnar neuropathy. This is an uncommon site of compression in the general population.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Cubital tunnel syndrome includes any ulnar neuropathy in the mid-arm
to mid-forearm.



The anatomic borders of the cubital tunnel are as follows: Anterior,
medial epicondyle; posterior, olecranon; floor, medial collateral ligament;
roof, arcuate ligament.



Nerve conduction studies are considered positive if the motor conduction
velocity across the elbow is less than 52 m/s, increased distal sensory
latency of greater than 3.2 ms, and motor latencies of greater than 5.3 ms.



Conservative management of cubital tunnel includes splinting, NSAIDs,
elbow padding, and PT.



Operative interventions include ulnar nerve decompression with or without
transposition and/or medial epicondylectomy.

CASE 31
A 64-year-old, right-hand dominant male is referred to your office with complaints
of progressive hand stiffness and deformity over the past 2 years. The small finger
of the right hand is most affected. The left hand is also affected, but not as severe.
He denies any history of trauma or previous hand problems, and he has no complaints of pain, nor finger locking or clicking. His father had similar problems with
his hands.
The patient’s past medical history includes high cholesterol and blood pressure.
More than 5 years ago, he underwent surgery for early-stage colon cancer, and
since then has been cancer-free. He currently does not drink alcohol, although he
drank heavily during his younger years. He is of English-Irish decent.
Examination of both hands reveals nodules and skin thickening in the palm
along the small finger ray. The right small finger metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint
is fixed at 45 degrees of flexion, and the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is
fixed at 20 degrees. There is no redness, tenderness, edema, or pain with passive
flexion. The left hand has a nodule and cord with a resting flexion contracture of
the small finger of 20 degrees that is improved with passive extension. Additionally, examination of his left foot reveals nontender nodules along the first ray proximal to the metatarsal head.

ANSWERS TO CASE 31:
Dupuytren Disease
Summary: This right-hand dominant, 64-year-old male patient has a progressive soft
tissue condition leading to digital flexion deformity or contracture. The stiffness is
associated with decreased functionality. The contracture in the right hand is not
passively correctible.
• Most likely diagnosis: Dupuytren disease.
• Most appropriate treatment: Collagenase injection(s), needle aponeurotomy, or
surgical fasciotomies, depending on the extent of disease and surgeon preference.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the clinical presentation, etiology, risk factors, anatomic features,
and pathoanatomy of Dupuytren disease.
2. Be familiar with basic treatment options and associated complications.
3. Identify criteria to guide choice of treatment.
4. Recognize prognostic factors for recurrence and poor outcome.

Considerations
This patient presents with progressive right small finger stiffness and deformity.
His MCP joint is fixed in 45 degrees of flexion and his PIP joint is fixed in 20 degrees
of flexion. His deformity (see Figure 31–1) is most obvious as he tries to extend
all his fingers. Furthermore, the patient denies any locking symptoms, and there is
no redness, tenderness, edema, or pain with passive flexion. The differential diagnosis for digital flexion contractures includes Dupuytren disease, trigger finger(s),
stenosing tenosynovitis, ganglion cysts, soft-tissue masses, hyperkeratosis, intrinsic joint disease, and traumatic scarring. Despite this broad differential, there
are several components of this patient’s presentation that favor a diagnosis of
Dupuytren disease. These include a family history of similar pathology, a history
of heavy alcohol use, being of Northern European decent, and presence of similar, nontender nodules in his left foot. After the clinical diagnosis of Dupuytren
disease is made, treatment options can be considered, including nonoperative and
operative modalities.

APPROACH TO:
Dupuytren Disease
DEFINITIONS
DUPUYTREN DISEASE: A benign fibroproliferative disorder involving the palmar and digital fascia.
SPIRAL CORD: An arrangement of abnormal fibrous tissue associated with PIP
joint flexion contractures. Spiral cords can displace digital neurovascular bundles
centrally and volarly (palmar superficially), making them especially prone to injury
during surgical release.
DUPUYTREN DIATHESIS: Refers to patients with an aggressive form of the
disease, manifesting with early onset, rapid progression, frequent bilaterality, and/or
involvement of the radial digits.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiology and Anatomic Features
Dupuytren disease is a benign fibroproliferative disorder involving the fascia of the
hand and fingers, most commonly involving the ring and small fingers. It can present
locally as a nodule in the palm or a dimple in the skin crease. Dupuytrens may then
progress distally to involve the joints of the fingers.
The exact etiology remains unclear, although a strong genetic predisposition
exists. It occurs more commonly in males of northern European descent. Dupuytren
disease has been associated with tobacco and alcohol use, diabetes, epilepsy, chronic

286

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

pulmonary disease, prior myocardial infarction, human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection, trauma, and tuberculosis. However, idiopathic presentation is most
common.
The pathophysiology of Dupuytren disease is not completely understood, but
has been found to involve abnormal proliferations of myofibroblasts, cells normally responsible for producing contractile scar tissue when the body attempts to
close a wound. In Dupuytrens, hyperactive myofibroblasts deposit disproportionate
quantities of extracellular collagen that form collections of fibrous bundles.
Additionally, the deposited fibrous matrix is itself abnormal, consisting of greater
concentrations of relatively thick and immature collagen type III, versus the
mature collagen type I that is found in normal fascia. Dupuytren disease develops in 3 distinct stages: (1) the proliferative stage, in which abnormal numbers
of oversized myofibroblasts are produced, (2) the involutional stage, in which
abnormal concentrations and quantities of collagen type III are deposited, and
(3) the residual stage, in which the myofibroblasts disappear, leaving behind
their dense fibrous deposits. Simply put, Dupuytrens results from a pathological
triggering of tissue healing in the absence of inciting trauma. Thick scar-like
deposits of abnormal collagen coalesce into the characteristic Dupuytren nodules
and cords.
Structural anomalies result from contraction of the collagenous palmar fascia and
overlying skin and fingers. Normal structures involved in the disease process include
the pretendinous band, natatory band, spiral band, Grayson ligament, retrovascular
band, and lateral digital sheet. These normal structures, or bands, when diseased,
become cords and are thereafter referred to as the pretendinous cord, central cord,
lateral cord, spiral cord, abductor digiti minimi cord, and intercommissural cord of
the first web space. Spiral cords lead to PIP contractures and receive special attention for putting the neurovascular bundle at risk by displacing it more centrally and
volarly as the PIP joint contracture increases.
The natural history and risk for progression for a single individual remain indeterminable. Patients with Dupuytren diathesis have a more aggressive form of the
disease that is associated with onset before age 40 years, bilateral hand involvement,
thumb and index finger contractures, and fibrotic disease of the feet and penis.
Patients need to be informed that recurrence is as high as 40% to 50%. When the
fibroproliferative disease results in permanent curvature of the penis, it is known as
Peyronie disease; similarly, if it involves the plantar foot, it is known as Ledderhose
disease.

Clinical Presentation and Evaluation
Patients may present early or with mild forms that manifest as a tender palmar
nodule (arising over a pretendinous band), skin dimpling, or a palpable cord. Classic
features include fixed finger flexion deformities that impair function of daily
living or work and indicate more advanced disease. There can be fixed flexion
of either or both the MCP and PIP joints. (The distal interphalangeal joints are
rarely involved and, when they are, are believed to result from formation of the
retrovascular cord.) Disease involvement occurs most often in the ring and little

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

287

fingers, with decreasing order of frequency in the long, thumb, and index digits. It
is bilateral in 45% of patients.
Dupuytren disease is diagnosed clinically. Flexion contractures are rarely subtle.
MCP flexion may result from a pretendinous cord or a spiral cord. Limitation in
finger abduction is frequently present and results from involvement of the web
space and the presence of a natatory cord. Fixed flexion of the PIP joint may arise
from contracture of the central cord that continues from a pretendinous cord in
the palm that extends into the finger. Involvement of the thumb may manifest as
contracture of the web space in addition to a fixed flexion contracture.

TREATMENT
The indications for surgery include functional impairment such as inability to
wear a glove, reach into pockets, or securely hold or grasp objects. Physical exam
criteria include a positive tabletop test (the inability to place the hand flat on
a tabletop), MCP flexion contracture of greater than 30 degrees, and any PIP
flexion contracture.
Different surgical techniques have been described. These include percutaneous
needle aponeurotomy, limited fasciectomy, and total palmar fasciectomy. Total palmar fasciectomy has recently fallen from favor because recurrence rates after surgery
were no better than those of less extensive procedures and it was associated with
higher rates of wound complications. The open-palm technique of McCash leaves
the wounds open after surgery, resulting in diminished edema and hematoma formation and allowing for early postoperative motion. This historic technique was once
preferred for older patients at increased risk for stiffness; but because of wound complications and poor acceptance on the part of the patient, this technique has since
been abandoned. Skin coverage deficits are not uncommon after surgical treatment
and may be addressed with skin grafting, Z-plasty, or healing by secondary intention.
Nonoperative treatment of Dupuytren disease is evolving. In early stages, corticosteroid injections may provide some relief by softening and flattening prominent
or painful nodules. For more advanced disease, an injectable collagenase (clostridial collagenase histolyticum or Xiaflex, which was approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration in 2010) is receiving increasing popularity. This drug has been
shown to chemically dissolve the Dupuytren’s cord, allowing for the subsequent
manipulation necessary to mechanically disrupt the contracted tissue and correct
the flexion deformity.

Outcomes and Complications
The most common complications after collagenase injection include edema, bruising,
and redness localized to the site of injection. More serious but less frequent complications include flexor tendon rupture or neurovascular injury.
The most common complication after operative treatment is recurrence, with
long-term rates as high as 40% to 50%. Attention to postoperative therapy with
active range of motion and splinting is a major determinant of improved outcomes.
Potential complications include infection, digital neurovascular injury, complex
regional pain syndrome, hematoma, skin loss, and amputation.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
31.1 A right-hand dominant 48-year-old woman presents with worsening hand
stiffness and deformity. On exam, you note nodules and skin thickening in
the palm along the small finger ray. You ultimately diagnose the patient
with Dupuytren disease and begin discussing the specifics of this condition
with her. Which of the following statements regarding Dupuytren disease
is true?
A. Dupuytren disease is rarely bilateral.
B. Dupuytren disease is associated with pain.
C. Females are at greater risk than males.
D. Recurrence after surgery is as high as 50%.
E. Rapidly progressive disease suggests malignancy.
31.2 Which of the following patients with Dupuytren contracture would benefit
the most from total palmar fasciectomy?
A. 50-year-old police officer with ring and small finger involvement of only
the MCP joints
B. 70-year-old sedentary male with small finger involvement including the
MCP and PIP joints
C. 45-year-old female tennis player with ring and small finger involvement
including MCP and PIP joints
D. None of the above, as total palmar fasciectomy has fallen out of popularity
due to its associated recurrence rates and complications, as opposed to
regional, or limited fasciectomy
31.3 A 40-year-old man presents to your hand clinic with a diagnosis of Dupuytren
disease involving his left small finger. The patient was given this diagnosis
last week while at a routine follow-up appointment with your partner for his
right total hip arthroplasty. Your partner felt that you, a hand surgeon, would
be best equipped to manage the Dupuytren. After receiving this diagnosis, the
patient did an internet search on this condition and comes in today inquiring
about treatment with Xiaflex. Which of the following statements regarding
Xiaflex is most accurate?
A. This drug has been shown to chemically dissolve the Dupuytren cord.
B. Xiaflex is a time-tested and effective means of treating Dupuytren
disease.
C. Xiaflex is great because it has no known side effects.
D. Xiaflex can be purchased as an over-the-counter medication.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

289

ANSWERS
31.1 D. Patients with Dupuytren disease should be counseled about the high risk
for recurrence after surgery. Disease is frequently bilateral, most common in
middle-aged men of northern European descent, and not histologically malignant, although patients with Dupuytren diathesis or with a genetic predisposition may have a more clinically aggressive form with rapid progression and
high recurrence.
31.2 D. As stated in D, total palmar fasciectomy has fallen out of popularity as
a result of its associated recurrence rates and complications, as opposed to
regional, or limited fasciectomy.
31.3 A. Xiaflex has been shown to chemically dissolve the Dupuytren cord, allowing for the subsequent manipulation necessary to mechanically disrupt the
contracted tissue and correct the flexion deformity. Although data are promising, Xiaflex was only approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
in 2010. Serious side effects include tendon rupture, ligament damage, nerve
injury, and allergic reactions. Common side effects include swelling, bleeding,
bruising, pain, and/or tenderness at the injection site or hand.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Dupuytren disease is a clinical diagnosis, and imaging or laboratory tests
are needed only to assess or rule out other incidental conditions.



Treatment is indicated when the fixed contractures interfere with hand
function; standard criteria to provide treatment include the contractures
of the MCP of 30 degrees and any degree of fixed PIP flexion, but decision
to treat should be tailored to the patient.



Patients with aggressive disease should be warned that there is high
recurrence after treatment.



Patients should be informed of irreversible complications from treatment
including flexor tendon rupture, wound complications (eg, hematoma, infection), and injury to neurovascular structures.

CASE 32
A 60-year-old right-hand dominant woman presents complaining of 12 weeks of
right ring finger pain. She is an avid gardener but denies any injury. She notes
a clicking sensation when she moves her finger. She occasionally experiences
the finger “getting stuck” when she bends it and she has to use her other hand
to force the finger back into extension. She reports minimal pain at rest. The
pain does not awaken her at night, but she does note ring finger stiffness in
the morning. She denies swelling or redness. She has tried resting and limiting her gardening, and she has been taking ibuprofen. Her medical history
includes diabetes. On examination, the skin is intact and appears normal. There
is no atrophy, swelling, ecchymosis, or erythema. She has a full range of passive
and active motion of her fingers and wrist. There is tenderness over the palmar
aspect of the ring finger metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and palpable popping with active finger flexion and extension. Strength is 5/5 in finger flexion,
extension, and abduction/adduction. Sensation is intact to light touch. She has
2+ pulses and capillary refill is less than 2 seconds. Compression testing at the
carpal tunnel is negative, as is Phalen and Tinel testing. Hand radiographs show
intact joint spaces and normal alignment.

ANSWERS TO CASE 32:
Trigger Finger
Summary: A 60-year-old diabetic woman presents to the office with 6 weeks of right
ring finger pain, popping, and locking with no history of injury. There is tenderness
to palpation over the flexor tendons overlying the MCP joint and palpable triggering. There is full range of motion and good strength.
• Most likely diagnosis: Trigger finger.
• Next diagnostic step: Physical exam is usually sufficient to diagnose this condition. Further confirmation may be achieved with an injection of local anesthetic
into the flexor tendon sheath. This results in a temporary resolution of pain so
that triggering, if present, can be readily elicited.
• Next step in therapy: This patient has a 12-week history of symptoms and has
not seen improvement after rest, activity modification, and NSAIDs. The next
step is steroid injection into the flexor tendon sheath.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathoanatomy of trigger finger.
2. Appreciate the functions of the flexor tendons and the flexor pulley system and
how they relate to trigger finger.
3. Be familiar with the treatment options for trigger finger.

Considerations
This 60-year-old woman with finger pain and popping has tendon entrapment, also
known as trigger finger. The diagnosis can generally be made with a thorough history
and physical examination. It is important to rule out more serious causes for finger
pain, including infection or fracture. Infection would have associated swelling, erythema, and possibly constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills. Fractures result
from an injury and initially will have swelling and ecchymosis. These conditions
can easily be ruled out in this case by the history and exam. If doubt exists, plain
radiographs can be used to rule out fracture, arthritis, or underlying bony deformity.
Other common conditions should also be ruled out, including arthritis and carpal
tunnel syndrome. Arthritis is a common cause of joint pain and stiffness in the hand.
Examination will reveal tenderness over the joint. In this patient’s case, the tenderness is over the palmar aspect of the MCP joint. Anatomically, this region of the joint
is covered by the flexor tendons and pulley system. The radial and ulnar sides of the
MCP joint are more accessible to palpation and are nontender in this patient.
The severity of the mechanical symptoms in a patient with trigger finger should
be determined. Early on, some patients may complain of pain alone, whereas in
more advanced cases, patients may have significant popping and locking to the

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

point that the finger becomes fixed in a flexed position. This can lead to permanent
loss of motion in the finger if untreated.

APPROACH TO:
Trigger Finger
DEFINITIONS
TENOSYNOVIUM: Thin synovial lining surrounding tendons that provides
lubricating fluid and nutrition to the tendons.
PULLEY: Fibrous sheath through which the flexor tendon glides. The flexor tendon
sheath functions to improve mechanics and maintain the tendon against the metacarpal and phalanges. In each finger, there are 4 to 5 annular (circular) pulleys and
3 cruciate (crossing) pulleys that make up the tendon sheath (Figure 32–1).

There are 5 annular pulleys, A1 through A5, and 3 cruciate pulleys (C1-3). Triggering occurs when
there is narrowing at the A1 pulley. (Reproduced, with permission, from Brunicardi FC, Andersen DK,

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

TRIGGER FINGER (ie, tendon entrapment): Inflammation of the tenosynovium
and narrowing of the first pulley, resulting in pain and popping with finger movement.
FINGER FLEXOR TENDONS: Each finger has 1 tendon from the flexor digitorum
profundus, which attaches to the distal phalanx and flexes the distal interphalangeal
joint (DIP), and 2 slips (derived from a single tendon) from the flexor digitorum
superficialis (FDS), which attach to the middle phalanx and flex the proximal
interphalangeal joint (PIP). The thumb pulley system contains the flexor pollicis
longus and attaches to the distal phalanx, flexing the thumb interphalangeal joint.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
Tendon entrapment can occur in any finger or the thumb. It is also common to see
patients with multiple fingers affected. Trigger finger is most common in patients 55
to 60 years of age and is at least twice as common in women as in men. It is generally
thought to be a degenerative condition resulting from long-term repetitive use of
the hand, especially with repeated gripping or pinching. It is more commonly seen
in the dominant hand. Systemic factors that can cause or exacerbate tendon entrapment include diabetes, gout, and rheumatoid arthritis.
The flexor tendons glide through a series of fibrous pulleys (Figure 32–1) that make
up the tendon sheath. The pulleys act to constrain the tendons against the bone. This
increases the force transmission and allows tendon gliding with finger motion. There are
4 to 5 annular pulleys and 3 cruciate pulleys. The A2 and A4 pulleys are most critical
for function. The first pulley (A1) may become narrowed over time, leading to tendon
entrapment. The tendons are lined with a thin tenosynovium that provides lubrication
and nutrition. With repetitive use of the hand, the tenosynovium may become inflamed,
resulting in pain over the tendon aggravated by use (termed tenosynovitis). As the condition worsens, degenerative changes in the fibrous pulley occur, resulting in thickening and inflammatory cell infiltration. As the A1 pulley becomes more hypertrophied,
stenosis or narrowing occurs. This leads to a popping or catching sensation with finger
flexion and extension as the tendon bunches up and gets stuck in the pulley.

Clinical Presentation
In the early stages of the condition, pain is the primary complaint. Pain is reported
with activities that involve use of the hand, especially gripping or holding objects.
Most patients report minimal pain at rest but may experience sharp pain with aggravating activities. As the condition worsens, popping begins to occur with active
finger motion. The finger may begin to “catch” or temporarily get stuck and, in more
advanced cases, may lock in a flexed position, requiring assistance to force the finger
back in extension. Patients often complain of stiffness upon waking in the morning
and may note that the finger is locked in flexion when they wake up. There is generally no swelling, numbness, or tingling. However, some patients can feel a bump or
a nodule in the flexor tendons that is tender to the touch.
Physical examination usually confirms the diagnosis. The A1 pulley, which overlies the metacarpal head and can be felt as a bump at the base of each finger in the
distal aspect of the palm, is palpated and is very tender to touch in the setting of
trigger finger. There is generally no tenderness elsewhere. Next, range of motion
should be examined and is usually normal. In severe cases with chronic locking,

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

295

some patients may develop a flexion contracture where they cannot fully extend
the finger. The examiner should then palpate over the A1 pulley while the patient
actively flexes and extends the finger to check for popping. One may also note a
nodularity in the tendon as it glides with finger motion. A complete examination of
the hand and wrist should be performed to rule out other conditions.
Radiographs are routinely obtained to rule out other conditions including arthritis
and fracture. There are no radiographic abnormalities associated with trigger finger.
The diagnosis can be confirmed with an injection of local anesthetic into the
flexor tendon sheath. This will result in complete pain resolution.

TREATMENT
Conservative treatment is effective in most patients with a trigger finger. In early cases
with mild symptoms, simple activity modification, rest, and oral anti-inflammatories
may be effective. With more significant pain and popping and in more chronic cases,
the next step is usually a steroid injection into the flexor tendon sheath. Injections
have been reported to result in complete symptom resolution in 57% of cases, but
some patients may require more than one injection. Patients with systemic causes
for trigger finger such as diabetes have worse results with conservative treatment,
with success seen in less than 50%.
In cases that do not respond to conservative treatment, surgery is an option.
This involves surgically dividing the A1 pulley to relieve the tendon entrapment.
The A2 and other distal pulleys remain intact, and no function is compromised.
The success rate of surgery is very high (> 90% by most reports).

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
32.1 A 55-year-old woman presents with sudden catching and locking of her ring

usually adequate for the diagnosis, and further confirmation is not required in
most cases.
32.2 A. The flexor tendons glide through a series of fibrous pulleys that make up
the tendon sheath. The first pulley (A1) may become narrowed over time, and
as it becomes more hypertrophied, stenosis or narrowing occurs. This leads to
a popping or catching sensation with finger flexion and extension as the tendon bunches up and gets stuck in the pulley.
32.3 A. This patient has failed 2 injections, and other conservative treatments are
unlikely to be effective because of the associated diabetes. Surgical release of
the A1 pulley has a success rate of greater than 90%.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Trigger finger is caused by flexor tendon entrapment in a narrowed A1
pulley.



Trigger finger usually responds to conservative treatment.



A steroid injection into the tendon sheath is an effective treatment in
most cases and usually should be attempted before considering surgery.



Surgical release of the A1 pulley is very effective in most cases that do not
respond to conservative treatment.

CASE 33
A 43-year-old dentist presents to the clinic with debilitating left elbow pain and
stiffness. He states that his left elbow has been bothering him on and off for
several weeks but has recently been getting worse. He states that he has been having
trouble grasping and gripping objects and feels as if his hand is not working
properly. The patient is concerned because the pain and stiffness are beginning
to limit him in what he can do in his practice. On physical exam, he is found to
have pain on palpation of his lateral elbow and pain with resisted wrist extension
and radial deviation. There is minimal swelling present. All motor and sensory
findings are normal. His past medical history and review of systems are otherwise
unremarkable.

ANSWERS TO CASE 33:
Lateral Epicondylitis
Summary: A 43-year-old otherwise healthy dentist presents with left elbow pain
localized to its lateral aspect. The pain has progressively worsened over the last several weeks, and he now reports stiffness and difficulty with grasping objects. The
patient is found to have tenderness with palpation of the lateral epicondyle, specifically at the origin of the forearm extensors, as well as pain with resisted wrist
extension and pain with resisted radial deviation. All motor and sensory findings
are normal. Radiographs of the elbow are negative for any pathology.
• Most likely diagnosis: Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow).
• Initial treatment: Rest and activity modifications designed to avoid repetitive
movements that stress the wrist and forearm extensor tendons. Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can be prescribed, and icing may
provide symptomatic relief. A forearm band or “counterforce brace” that is
worn distal to the origin of the extensor group could be worn. Once pain has
subsided, stretching and strengthening of the forearm extensors should be performed to prevent recurrence of symptoms.
• Utility of a steroid injection: Corticosteroids, usually administered concurrently with a local anesthetic, into the area of maximal tenderness, have been
shown to be beneficial in achieving transient pain relief. However, multiple
corticosteroid injections may be associated with rupture of the extensor tendon
origin and/or lateral collateral ligament, both devastating complications.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the causes of lateral epicondylitis and the populations most affected.
2. Be familiar with the differential diagnosis for lateral epicondylitis.
3. Know the treatment options for lateral epicondylitis.

Considerations
This 43-year-old dentist presents with left elbow pain localized to the extensor origin at the lateral elbow. His history and physical exam are concerning for lateral
epicondylitis, more commonly known as tennis elbow. However, this diagnosis is
one of exclusion, and it is essential to rule out other possible injuries, such as a
radial and posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) entrapment syndromes, occult fractures, radial head arthritis, C6 and C7 nerve root compression, posterolateral plica,
and osteochondral loose bodies. Plain radiographs and physical exam are effective at
evaluating for such pathology. In this patient, exam findings that make the diagnosis

of lateral epicondylitis more likely include localized elbow tenderness at the origin
of the forearm extensors, pain with resisted wrist extension, and pain with resisted
radial deviation.

APPROACH TO:
Lateral Epicondylitis
DEFINITIONS
LATERAL EPICONDYLITIS: An overuse syndrome or tendinosis affecting the
lateral humeral epicondyle. It most commonly involves the extensor carpi radialis
brevis (ECRB) but may also involve the extensor digitorum communis (EDC).
Lateral epicondylitis is more commonly referred to as tennis elbow.
MAUDSLEY TEST: A test used to evaluate for tennis elbow. It is positive when
the patient experiences pain in the region of the lateral epicondyle during resisted
extension of the middle finger.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiology
Lateral epicondylitis is a condition that typically affects middle-aged men and
women, resulting in mild to severe discomfort and functional impairment. Although
it is also known as tennis elbow because of the vulnerability of tennis players to this
injury, javelin throwers, bowlers, swimmers, golfers, and pitchers are also susceptible because of the stress that is placed on the forearm and wrist extensor tendons
in those sports. Individuals whose vocational demands include repetitious upper
extremity movements, such as carpenters, plumbers, shoemakers, surgeons, and
musicians (ie, violinists), are also at risk of developing lateral epicondylitis. The
ECRB is most often implicated, but EDC involvement also occurs.
Although epicondylitis is commonly thought of as an inflammatory process, this is
a misconception; histology reveals neither acute nor chronic inflammatory changes,
but instead hyaline degeneration and vascular proliferation, typically at the ECRB
origin (Figure 33–1). These histologic findings have been termed angiofibroblastic
dysplasia. One proposed mechanism by which this occurs involves repetitive microtrauma to the ECRB with an incomplete healing and regenerative response.

Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis
On presentation, patients complain of pain and sometimes stiffness around the
lateral aspect of the elbow. They may also describe subjective feelings of tightness
in the forearm. It is usually the dominant arm that is affected, and it is rarely seen
bilaterally. Physical exam should include evaluation of range of motion at the
wrist and elbow, motor strength of the forearm extensor muscles, and palpation of
the radial head. Tenderness localized to the lateral epicondyle, where the extensor
muscles originate, is present on palpation, especially when the elbow is held in

extension, the forearm held in pronation, and the wrist held in flexion. Additionally,
both resisted wrist extension and resisted radial deviation may cause pain in the
region of the lateral epicondyle. The Maudsley test should also be performed and is
positive when the patient complains of pain in the region of the lateral epicondyle
during resisted extension of the middle finger. A lidocaine injection test can be
used to differentiate between tennis elbow and posterior interosseous nerve (PIN)
syndrome, an entrapment neuropathy that is commonly misdiagnosed as lateral
epicondylitis as a result of a similar constellation of symptoms. In the case of radial
tunnel syndrome, an injection given 4 fingerbreadths distal to the lateral epicondyle
will result in a temporary PIN palsy and in the setting of radial tunnel syndrome, a
temporary relief in pain. If the injection fails to provide relief, the diagnosis of lateral
epicondylitis is more likely and can be confirmed with transient pain relief from a
lidocaine injection at the origin of the ECRB tendon.
Imaging has limited utility in the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis and is most beneficial for ruling out other processes, such as arthritis or fractures. Plain radiographs
only rarely show soft-tissue calcification near the lateral epicondyle, which if present
would be suggestive of tennis elbow. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging
can be used to visualize the extensor tendons and elbow joint, but are only indicated
if the patient’s symptoms fail to improve after 3 months of conservative treatment.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

301

TREATMENT
Conservative, nonoperative treatment modalities are always attempted first,
with operative interventions reserved for refractory cases. Pain reduction is the
first treatment goal, and NASIDs, rest, and splinting are often trialled. Patients
should be advised to attempt to reduce performing strenuous activities that exacerbate their symptoms for at least 6 weeks. Wrist splints are particularly useful if
the elbow tenderness is exacerbated by resisted wrist extension. A counterforce
brace can also be used and functions as an inelastic cuff around the proximal
forearm against the extensor compartment that reduces the forces generated by
the muscles. Other conservative measures that may relieve pain include corticosteroid injections adjacent to the ECRB tendon and extracorporeal shock wave
therapy. More recently, injection of platelet-rich plasma has also shown some
promise in providing symptomatic relief. Once pain relief is achieved, extensor
compartment stretching and strengthening exercises should commence and will
help to prevent symptom recurrence.
Cases in which symptoms fail to resolve with 6 to 12 months of conservative
treatment can be treated with operative intervention, in which any degenerative, angiofibrotic tissue is debrided, and the ERCB, common extensor tendon,
and its aponeurosis are repaired if torn. Both open and arthroscopic techniques
have been described. Surgery is followed by a period of rest followed by progressive rehabilitation and strengthening. The major complication following
this procedure is posterolateral elbow instability, which results from excessive
debridement of collateral ligament and extensor muscle origins on the lateral
epicondyle.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
33.1 A 45-year-old carpenter has chronic pain and stiffness over the lateral aspect
of the elbow, especially when using a hammer. On exam, Maudsley test is positive. Which muscle attachment is likely to be involved?
A. Extensor carpi radialis longus
B. Brachioradialis
C. Extensor carpi radialis brevis

elbow?
A. Reactive hyperemia
B. Lateral epicondylitis

33.3 A 40-year-old woman who you have recently diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis wants to know her treatment options. Which of the following are
considered first-line interventions?
A. NSAIDs
B. Wrist splinting
C. ECRB debridement
D. Counterforce brace
E. A, B, D

ANSWERS
33.1 C. The extensor carpi radialis brevis is the most common forearm extensor
associated with lateral epicondylitis. The extensor digitorum communis has
also been implicated. The extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi
ulnaris can also be involved, but it is very rare.
33.2 C. The histologic term used to describe tennis elbow is angiofibroblastic
dysplasia. This is because tennis elbow results from hyaline degeneration
and vascular proliferation at the ECRB origin. Microscopic evaluation
shows fibroblast hypertrophy, disorganized collagen, and vascular hyperplasia.
Although tennis elbow is named lateral epicondylitis, it is not due to inflammatory processes.
33.3 E. Conservative measures used in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis include
rest, ice, NSAIDs, physical therapy, bracing, steroid injections, extracorporeal
shock wave therapy, and platelet-rich plasma. ECRB debridement with possible tendon repair is only performed after 6 to 12 months of failed conservative treatment.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow, is a diagnosis of exclusion.



The ECRB is most often implicated, but EDC involvement also occurs in
tennis elbow.



Exam findings consistent with lateral epicondylitis include point tenderness at the forearm extensor origin on the lateral epicondyle, pain with
resisted wrist extension, pain with resisted radial deviation, and a positive
Maudsley test.

CASE 34
A 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department (ED) by his basketball
teammates for evaluation of his right leg. The patient was playing a pick-up game
at the local gym earlier in the day, at which time he planted his right foot for a
jump shot and suddenly felt as though someone kicked him in the back of his leg,
although when he looked back no one was close by. The patient reports feeling
a “snap” in his calf, experiencing intense pain, and falling to the ground. In the
ED, his vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of his left lower extremity
reveals a palpable, tender “bulging” mass over his calf and a soft depression on
the posterior aspect of his heel. There is no bony tenderness of the left lower
extremity. On passive range of motion, there is increased dorsiflexion in the left
foot compared with the right foot. The patient cannot actively plantarflex his left
foot.

ANSWERS TO CASE 34:
Achilles Tendon Rupture
Summary: A 35-year-old man presents with left lower extremity pain after hearing
a “snap” in the back of his leg while planting his foot to take a shot during a basketball game. He states that it felt like someone kicked him. Immediately afterward he
noticed significant posterior heel swelling. He is unable to actively plantarflex his
foot. On exam, you note increased passive range of dorsiflexion on his left side when
compared with his right as well as a palpable defect in his Achilles tendon.
• Most likely diagnosis: Achilles tendon rupture.
• Next step in workup: Pain control, plain radiographs and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the left distal tibia and fibula and ankle if the diagnosis
is unclear. Ultrasound is an effective alternative modality for diagnosing an
Achilles tendon rupture if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated.
• Best treatment: Primary surgical repair.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand how to clinically diagnose an acute Achilles tendon rupture using
history and specific physical exam maneuvers.
2. Be familiar with treatment options, both nonoperative and operative, for managing
Achilles tendon ruptures.
3. Recognize the indications for various treatment options and understand their
respective advantages and disadvantages.

Considerations
Initial treatment for this 35-year-old man with a presumed Achilles tendon rupture
should focus on pain relief and placing the affected leg in a splint that ensures
immobilization in a plantarflexed position. The goal of this initial stabilization is
to restore the natural length of the musculotendinous unit disrupted by the injury.
The primary goal of treatment is to alleviate pain and restore function. There is
debate in the orthopaedic community regarding the best treatment modality for acute
Achilles tendon ruptures. Nonoperative treatment includes a period of 6 to 8 weeks
of splint or cast immobilization. Operative surgical treatments include open tendon
repair and minimally invasive suturing techniques to restore the length and integrity
of the torn tendon.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

307

APPROACH TO:
Achilles Tendon Rupture
DEFINITIONS
THOMPSON TEST: With the patient in the prone position, the examiner,
squeezes the posterior calf musculature (Figure 34–1). A positive Thompson test
occurs when there is an absence of plantarflexion in the affected extremity. The
disrupted musculotendinous unit is no longer able to plantarflex the foot on the
affected side. This is compared with the unaffected side.
ECCENTRIC CONTRACTION: A muscular contraction during which muscle
fibers actually elongate while firing due to overwhelming antagonistic forces. This
occurs because the forces that the muscle is trying to overcome are greater than
the force generated by the muscle body. Conversely, concentric contractions occur
when the muscle body shortens with contraction. In concentric contractions, the
force generated by the muscle is greater than the antagonistic forces applied to it.

produces plantarflexion of the foot (1). If the tendon is completely ruptured, this will not occur (2).

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
Diagnosis of Achilles tendon ruptures are increasing in incidence as more “weekend
warrior” athletes are pushing the limits of their typically sedentary and deconditioned bodies. Additionally, the medical community is becoming more aware of and
skilled at diagnosing the injury. This injury is commonly observed in men in their
fourth through sixth decades of life.

Pathoanatomy
The gastrocnemius and soleus muscle bodies are contained within the superficial
posterior compartment of the leg. These muscle bodies converge to form a common
Achilles tendon, which inserts on the posterior tuberosity of the calcaneus. This
musculotendinous unit acts to plantarflex the foot. The Achilles tendon most commonly ruptures when the gastrocnemius-soleus complex undergoes eccentric loading with the ankle dorsiflexed and the knee extended. Patients are usually able to
describe the incident in which they were pushing off or landing on a plantarflexed
foot. Most Achilles tendon injuries occur in a hypovascular watershed area located
approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to its insertion. Repetitive microtrauma to this
vulnerable hypovascular region is thought to predispose it to rupture.

Physical Exam
Along with the clinical history, the physical exam is key to diagnosing an Achilles
tendon rupture. Despite increasing awareness in the medical community, approximately 25% of Achilles tendon ruptures are initially misdiagnosed as ankle sprains.
Visual inspection of the affected extremities will likely reveal significant soft tissue
swelling in the heel region. A palpable gap, erythema, and/or a bulging muscle mass
may be noted after an acute rupture. The Thompson test (Figure 34–1) will aid
the clinician in establishing the diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture. Although
plantarflexion is frequently compromised, be aware that the patient may still exhibit
active plantarflexion due to the functions of the unaffected toe flexor and posterior
tibialis muscles.

Imaging
The diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Imaging studies are generally reserved for situations in which the physical exam is
inconclusive. Plain radiographs of the lower leg have limited use in diagnosing soft
tissues injuries but can adequately rule out any bony injuries and sometimes demonstrate soft tissue swelling. Ultrasound is another imaging modality that can be
useful. Although inexpensive, its utility is greatly operator dependent. MRI is the
gold standard imaging modality but is not necessary in a clinically obvious diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture (Figure 34–2). It may, however, be useful in discerning subtleties of partial or chronic Achilles tendon injuries. Of note, the American
Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guideline Summary for acute
Achilles tendon rupture states that “We are unable to recommend for or against the

routine use of MRI, ultrasonography, and radiography to confirm the diagnosis
of acute Achilles tendon rupture.” In other words, it remains a clinical diagnosis.

TREATMENT
The treatment for an Achilles tendon rupture is controversial and should be individualized to each patient. The primary goal is to reestablish the normal anatomy
of the muscle and tendon, in turn restoring function to the musculotendinous unit.
If the tendon is left to heal in either extreme of dorsiflexion or plantarflexion, the
mechanical functioning of the gastrocnemius-soleus complex with the tendon could
be compromised.
Nonoperative treatment is reserved for older, sedentary individuals with multiple
medical comorbidities that may compromise wound healing. It focuses on immobilizing the affected leg in a gravity equinus position that maximizes apposition
of the 2 ends of the ruptured tendon. Posterior splints, removable boots and short
leg casts for 6 to 8 weeks can all stabilize the foot in this manner. Gradual range
of motion and resistance exercises begin at 8 to 10 weeks. Such management lacks
the risks of surgery, which include infection, wound breakdown, and nerve injury.

310

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

However, the limitations of conservative management include suboptimal tendon
length after healing and diminished muscle function. Patients must be warned that
they will likely have residual weakness and that it can take up to 1 year before
maximal plantarflexion is achieved. Furthermore, some studies have shown an
increased re-rupture rate with nonoperative management.
Common indications for operative treatment include acute ruptures in young,
healthy, active individuals, and following re-rupture of previously immobilizationtreated Achilles ruptures. It can be accomplished via open and percutaneous techniques. The surgical approach is on the medial side of the Achilles tendon sheath.
The frayed edges are debrided, and the foot is positioned in equinus. Two heavy
nonabsorbable sutures are then woven through 3 to 4 cm of each tendon edge, using
a Bunnell or Kessler stitch technique. The repair can be augmented with lighter,
absorbable sutures or with the plantaris tendon if it is present. Although surgical
repair decreases re-rupture rate and increases maximal plantarflexion strength, it
does have risks and complications, including infection, skin sloughing and necrosis,
and sural nerve damage.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
34.1 A 28-year-old man with an acute Achilles tendon rupture is deciding between
operative and nonoperative treatment for his condition. Which of the following statements is true regarding operative treatment?
A. Lower infection rate
B. Lower incidence of tendon re-rupture
C. Decreased muscle strength
D. Increased sensation over the skin of the posterior calf
34.2 A 45-year-old man presents with severe ankle pain and an inability to bear
weight after tripping into a sand trap while golfing. Which initial diagnostic
test is most appropriate?
A. MRI
B. X-ray
C. Bone scan
D. Ultrasound
34.3 Achilles tendon rupture typically occurs during which type of muscle contraction?
A. Eccentric muscle contraction
B. Isometric muscle contraction
C. Concentric muscle contraction
D. Rhythmic muscle contraction

ANSWERS
34.1 B. Surgical repair is associated with a significantly reduced risk of re-rupture
when compared with nonsurgical treatment.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

311

34.2 B. In a patient with ankle pain and an inability to bear weight, potential fracture must first be ruled out. Although MRI is the gold standard for diagnosing
Achilles tendon ruptures, MRI, and similarly ultrasound, should be considered
only after other potential injuries are excluded. Bone scans are effective at
diagnosing occult bony abnormalities but rarely play a role in diagnosing acute
injuries about the ankle.
34.3 A. The Achilles tendon most commonly ruptures when the gastrocnemiussoleus complex is undergoing eccentric loading with the ankle dorsiflexed and
the knee extended.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Approximately 25% of Achilles tendon ruptures are initially misdiagnosed
as ankle sprains.



Signs and symptoms of an acute rupture include pain, swelling, and
ecchymosis around the heel, and a palpable gap in the tendon. Patients
classically recall a “popping” sensation during injury or describe the false
sensation of being struck on the heel with a blunt object.



The Thompson test is an effective physical exam maneuver used to diagnose Achilles ruptures.



While Achilles tendon rupture is a predominantly clinical diagnosis, imaging may be necessary in the setting of chronic symptomatology, potential
concomitant injuries, or unclear exam findings.

CASE 35
A 47-year-old woman complains of pain at the medial side of her ankle. She works
constantly on her feet as real estate agent. She says that she has had a relatively flatfoot
her whole life, but it has worsened over the last 3.5 years and believes that the arch
is collapsing. She says when she is in the shower it feels like the foot cups the floor.
She also has a bunion that seems to have progressed over time. It is dramatically
affecting her ability to walk and work. She has tried conservative care in the form of
an orthotic and an ankle brace, but the condition continues to worsen her quality of
life. On her exam, she has good ankle and subtalar range of motion. She has obvious increased heel valgus on the left side compared with the right. There is a sense
of fullness and pain to palpation over the medial aspect of the ankle. On sitting, she
can invert, evert, plantar flex, and dorsiflex the ankle with normal strength. However,
on standing, she has increased foot abduction, and the arch appears to be collapsed. She cannot perform a single heel raise on the left side but can do so
normally on the right side. She also has gastrocnemius tightness. The first ray is

ANSWERS TO CASE 35:
Adult Acquired Flatfoot Deformity
Summary: A 47-year-old woman presents with medial ankle pain and worsening
flat foot over the last 3.5 years. The patient has tried orthotics and an ankle brace.
On exam, she has increased heel valgus, decreased arch, and inability to single heel
raise, with pain over the medial aspect of the ankle.
• Most likely diagnosis: Adult acquired flatfoot deformity (AAFD; originally
known as posterior tibial tendon insufficiency).
• Imaging: Initial plain radiographs of the foot should be obtained in a weightbearing stance, including an anteroposterior (AP) view to evaluate the talonavicular coverage angle and a lateral view to evaluate the first tarsometatarsal
angle (Meary angle), the calcaneal pitch, and the alignment of the hindfoot.
Additionally, radiographs of the ankle should be obtained to evaluate for the
presence of a valgus tilt.
• Surgical treatment: Medializing calcaneal osteotomy with a flexor digitorum
longus transfer to the navicular. Other accessory procedures depend on the
nature of the deformity.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathophysiology behind the development of AAFD, and appreciate the bony, tendinous, and ligamentous anatomy implicated in its development.
2. Understand the nonoperative approach to patients with AAFD.
3. Appreciate the indications and purpose of each step in the algorithm for surgically treating AAFD.

Considerations
This 47-year-old woman has a history of a flatfoot that has worsened over time.
The medial arch pain is most likely caused by inflammation and tenderness of
the posterior tibial tendon. She has already failed a number of conservative treatments designed to maintain the foot in a more anatomic position. This includes the
orthotic, which gives arch support and also tilts the heel out of the valgus position.
Figures 35–1, 35–2, 35–3, and 35–4 comprise a standard radiographic workup for
AAFD. These radiographs demonstrate collapse at the medial arch (lateral view), a
forefoot abduction deformity (AP view), and increased heel valgus (ankle AP and
mortise views). An MRI is also very helpful and will show thickening of the posterior tibial tendon and failure of the ligaments of the medial arch. Surgical treatment
can be performed after failure of conservative treatment. This consists of a variety
of corrective osteotomies and tendon transfers in patients with flexible deformity as
present in this patient. Patients with rigid deformity are better served with selective
fusions of the hindfoot.

APPROACH TO:
Adult Acquired Flatfoot Deformity
DEFINITIONS
POSTERIOR TIBIAL TENDON: The major invertor of the hindfoot, which
has its origin along the posterior aspect of the leg and its insertion on the
navicular.
MEDIALIZING CALCANEAL OSTEOTOMY: Surgically cutting the calcaneal
bone from the lateral side, which is used to translate the posterior portion of the
bone attached to the Achilles in a medial fashion. The osteotomy is fixed by
2 screws passed axially up the long axis of the heel bone or calcaneus.
FLEXOR DIGITORUM LONGUS TRANSFER: A surgical rerouting of the
tendon, which normally attaches to the plantar surface of the base of the distal
phalanges of the 4 lesser toes, to the navicular to replace or enhance the action of
the posterior tibial tendon.
GASTROCNEMIUS RECESSION: This is a selective lengthening of the fascia just distal to the muscle body of the gastrocnemius that does not compromise
the soleus muscle and therefore lengthens the Achilles complex in a modest
fashion.
LATERAL COLUMN LENGTHENING: A surgical cut of the anterior/lateral
aspect of the calcaneus that is used to place a graft and move the forefoot out of
relative abduction.
SPRING LIGAMENT: The calcaneonavicular ligament, which is a sleeve of
tissue that extends from the calcaneus to the navicular and helps support the talar
head.
DELTOID LIGAMENT: The ligament connecting the medial malleolus to
the talus and calcaneus that helps to prevent the ankle joint from tilting into
valgus.
ARIZONA BRACE: A brace that incorporates a custom-made orthotic with a
lace-up ankle brace used to help control adult acquired flatfoot deformity.
HINDFOOT VALGUS: A malalignment of the heel with its base displaced laterally when viewed from behind.
FOREFOOT ABDUCTION: A relative position of the toes further away from the
midline of the body than normal.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
The true cause of the AAFD is not known. Generally, however, it is thought to
occur more commonly in women, particularly those who are ligamentously lax and
in those who are overweight, which places more strain on the posterior tibial tendon.
This tendon goes on to stretch and fail along with the ligaments that support the

318

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

arch, including the spring ligament. Patients generally complain of having a flatfoot their whole life, which worsens over time. It is thought that the hypovascular
nature of the tendon in the area of failure is a leading cause. This generally occurs in
women beginning in their fifties.

Clinical Presentation
Most patients present first with pain in the medial arch area. This corresponds with
the area of the posterior tibial tendon. They also note a decrease in the arch and the
position of their heel in more valgus. The foot generally begins to feel weaker. As
the disease progresses, pain may shift laterally. This is commonly because the heel
begins to impinge underneath the fibula.
The physical exam shows the patient to have a decreased arch with the heel
positioned in valgus. Patients commonly have an abducted forefoot. A helpful
diagnostic test is the single heel raise. Patients with posterior tibial tendon insufficiency are unable to raise their heel from the ground or, if they can do so, are
not able to fully invert the heel. Patients also commonly present with a bunion and
a tight gastrocnemius muscle, which occurs as the heel moves in the more relative
position of valgus and shortens the Achilles.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is commonly made based on the history. The inability to perform a
single heel raise is very suggestive as well. Radiographs indicate the location and
amount of deformity (Figures 35–1, 35–2, 35–3, and 35–4). On a lateral x-ray,
patients have a decreased first tarsometatarsal angle showing collapse on the inside
arch. The hindfoot alignment view generally shows that the heel is in relative position of valgus. AP x-rays show that the navicular bone moves lateral relative to the
talus, which suggests that there is forefoot abduction. An MRI can be helpful as well,
which shows not only enlargement and degeneration of the posterior tibial tendon,
but also failure of the spring ligament complex.
Once the diagnosis of AAFD is made, it can be classified. Classification into
4 stages of severity helps guide treatment and prognosis. In stage I, the foot and ankle
are without deformity, however there maybe pain from posterior tibial tendinosis. In
stage II, the flatfoot deformity is apparent, but it is flexible throughout, meaning, the
examiner can pull it into appropriate alignment. In stage III, the flatfoot deformity
becomes rigid and is uncorrectable by manipulation. Finally, by stage IV, there is an
additional rigid valgus tilt to the ankle due to compromise of the deltoid ligament.

TREATMENT
Treatment depends on the stage of the deformity. In general, those with stage I or no
deformity can be treated conservatively with an orthotic and relative rest. Patients
with stage II deformity generally are first approached with an orthotic, which gives
arch support, and a medial post, which is used to raise the inside aspect of the heel
and tilt the heel out of valgus. An ankle brace that is usually a lace-up or velcro
brace can be used to help stabilize the hindfoot. Commonly, patients must go on to
try an Arizona brace, which is a custom-made orthotic built in with an ankle brace.
Patients with stage III AAFD respond less favorably to orthotics and bracing given

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

319

that the deformity is rigid and not correctible. Stage IV generally also requires more
aggressive treatment, given the collapse that is occurring through the ankle unless
the patient is relatively asymptomatic.
Surgical treatment also depends on the stage. Surgery is rarely indicated for
patients without deformity or stage I. In stage II, a medializing heel slide is commonly performed, along with a transfer of the flexor digitorum longus tendon to
the navicular. If the posterior tibial tendon is very diseased, it can be resected.
A gastrocnemius resection, lateral column lengthening, and medial column procedures such as first tarsometatarsal fusion or osteotomy to the medial cuneiform
(Cotton osteotomy) can be also used. For stage III deformity, a fusion of the triple joint
complex, which includes the subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneal cuboid joint,
must be performed. In stage IV, the ankle must be addressed concomitantly with the
foot either through trying to reconstruct the deltoid, performing an ankle fusion, or
performing ankle replacement.

35.4 A 60-year-old man presents with a 2-year history of medial ankle pain and a
severe flatfoot deformity, which is correctable on physical exam. Which of
the following best describes the orthotic that may be used to help treat this
deformity?
A. Lateral posting and a first metatarsal well
B. Lateral posting with a metatarsal pad
C. Medial heel posting with arch support
D. A carbon-graphite insert with an extension to protect the great toe
35.5 A 52-year-old woman who is moderately obese and who has had flatfoot deformity her whole life is now presenting with worsening hindfoot pain, particularly around the medial aspect of her ankle. She has increased heel valgus on
exam with forefoot abduction and a decreased arch. She cannot perform a
single heel raise. MRI confirms a decreased arch and posterior tibial tendinosis.
Which of the following best describes the surgical treatment?
A. Lateralizing heel slide and a flexor digitorum longus transfer to the
navicular
B. Lateralizing heel slide and a deltoid ligament repair
C. Medializing heel slide with lateral column shortening through the
anterior calcaneus
D. Medializing heel slide with a flexor digitorum longus transfer to the
navicular

ANSWERS
35.1 B. The spring ligament connects the calcaneus and navicular, holding up the
talar head and helping support the medial arch.
35.2 D. The posterior tibia tendon inserts on the navicular. Its primary action is to
invert the hindfoot and can be assessed with the single heel raise test.
35.3 C. A flatfoot deformity that does not correct on exam is considered rigid and
therefore classified as stage III. Arthritis is commonly present.
35.4 C. A medial heel post helps tilt the heel out of valgus. The arch support helps
to maintain the medial arch. Metatarsal posts are generally used for pain under
the metatarsals, and the carbon-graphite insert above is generally used for
patients with arthritis in the great toe joint.
35.5 D. The heel must be cut and translated medially to bring the calcaneus out of
valgus. The flexor digitorum transfer to the navicular helps restores inversion
power to the foot.

CLINICAL PEARLS


AAFD usually is caused by failure of the ligaments supporting the medial
arch along with the posterior tibial tendon.



Patients with AAFD present with hindfoot valgus and an inability to do a
single heel raise.



Standard weightbearing radiographs often diagnose flatfoot deformity
due to decreased first tarsometatarsal angle on a lateral view, increased
forefoot abduction through the talonavicular joint on an anteroposterior
view, and a hindfoot alignment view showing increased heel valgus.



MRI can also show the failure of the posterior tendon and medial arch
ligaments.

Conservative treatment generally consists of orthotics and bracing.



Surgical reconstruction usually consists of an osteotomy of the calcaneus
and a tendon transfer in the foot in patients with flexible deformity.

CASE 36
A 37-year-old man arrives in the emergency department after a motorcycle accident
in which he hit a tree traveling at approximately 50 mph. He was helmeted and
denies any loss of consciousness. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, his heart
rate is 90 beats/minute, and his temperature is 99°F. He complains of significant
pain localized to his right foot. On physical exam of the right foot, the skin is found
to be intact. However, there is significant swelling over the dorsum of the foot as
well as plantar ecchymosis. His foot is tender, predominantly over the midfoot
and forefoot. The patient will not move his toes secondary to pain. His sensation
is grossly intact. The posterior tibial pulse is palpable, whereas the dorsalis pedis
pulse is only appreciated with a Doppler probe. Capillary refill of the toes is brisk
and less than 2 seconds. His pain does not worsen with passive dorsiflexion of
the toes.

ANSWERS TO CASE 36:
Lisfranc Injury
Summary: A 37-year-old man complains of severe right foot pain after a motorcycle accident in which he hit a tree at approximately 50 mph. On physical exam
of his foot, diffuse tenderness and dorsal swelling are noted, as is medial plantar
ecchymosis.
• Radiographs to order: Anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and 30-degree oblique views
of the right foot.
• Most likely diagnosis: Tarsometatarsal joint complex injury, commonly referred
to as a Lisfranc injury.
• Other considerations: Given the high-energy mechanism of injury, this
patient must be managed with strict adherence to advanced trauma life support protocol. A complete trauma workup and evaluation should be performed
before orthopaedic intervention for the left foot.
• Classification of Lisfranc injury: Although multiple classifications exist, none
have been proven to be useful for determining treatment or prognosis. One
commonly used descriptive classification describes homolateral, isolated, and
divergent patterns.
• Treatment: Open-reduction internal fixation when soft tissue swelling subsides.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with the general presentation of a Lisfranc injury.
2. Understand the workup and imaging studies required for diagnosis of a Lisfranc
injury.
3. Know the treatment options for and complications associated with Lisfranc
injuries.

Considerations
This patient’s history and presentation are common for an injury to the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joint complex. The diffuse pain and swelling, specifically over the
midfoot and forefoot, are consistent with a high-energy injury mechanism, such as a
motorcycle accident, which is often associated with Lisfranc injuries. Additionally,
the medial plantar ecchymosis is often thought to be pathognomonic for this injury.
The absence of a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse is likely due to the soft tissue swelling over the dorsum of the foot, another common finding. Although the patient’s
clinical picture is consistent with a Lisfranc injury, up to 20% of these initially go
undiagnosed. The swelling is concerning, as compartment syndrome of the foot can
be seen in association with injuries to the TMT joint complex. The practitioner

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

325

must carefully and serially examine the patient in this setting and even consider
measuring compartment pressures if they believe an acute compartment syndrome
is present. The orthopaedic workup of this patient should also include imaging of
the right foot, including AP, lateral, and oblique views. A secondary survey should
also be performed to rule out additional musculoskeletal injuries requiring care. In
the emergency department, this patient’s foot should be splinted, iced, and elevated
to control swelling, as the timing of potential operative intervention is dependent
on this. Soft tissue swelling can delay operative treatment of Lisfranc injuries by up
to several weeks. In addition to an orthopaedic surgery consultation, this patient
requires an evaluation by the trauma team; intracranial, thoracic, abdominal, and
spine injuries can be present concurrently.

APPROACH TO:
Lisfranc Injuries
DEFINITIONS
JACQUES LISFRANC: A field surgeon in Napoleon’s army. He described an amputation involving the TMT joint due to a severe gangrene that developed when a
soldier fell from a horse with his foot caught in a stirrup.
LISFRANC JOINT: This refers to the TMT joint complex, an osseous and capsule-ligamentous network that includes the 5 metatarsals (MTs), their articulations
with the cuneiforms and cuboid, and the Lisfranc ligament, a strong interosseous
attachment between the medial cuneiform and second MT.
LISFRANC INJURY: Refers to a spectrum of processes involving the TMT joint
complex, including both fractures and dislocation. It does not delineate a specific
injury.
HOMOLATERAL LISFRANC INJURY: All 5 metatarsals are displaced in the
same direction.
ISOLATED LISFRANC INJURY: 1 or 2 metatarsals are displaced from the others.
DIVERGENT LISFRANC INJURY: The metatarsals are displaced in both the
coronal and sagittal planes.
COMPARTMENT SYNDROME: A surgical emergency that occurs as a result
of increased pressure within a muscle compartment, at times compromising blood
flow and damaging nerves, muscle, and surrounding soft tissue structures. It is often
encountered in the setting of trauma and extremity fractures. Although a clinical
diagnosis, intracompartmental pressure measurements of greater than 30 mmHg or
a less than 30-mmHg difference between the patient’s intracompartmental pressure
and diastolic blood pressure are consistent with the diagnosis of compartment syndrome (see Case 13).

326

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

CLINICAL APPROACH
Anatomy
The Lisfranc joint divides the midfoot and the forefoot, forming an oblique line
running from the lateral aspect of the proximal forefoot to the medial aspect of
the distal forefoot. Bony elements provide the primary structural support to this
articulation, with ligamentous contributions adding additional stability. The 3 medial
MTs articulate with the 3 cuneiforms; the fourth and fifth MTs articulate with the
cuboid. The middle cuneiform–second MT articulation forms the keystone of the
arch, preventing mediolateral MT motion at the Lisfranc joint. This transverse arch
also prevents plantar displacement of the 3 medial MTs. The most significant and
strongest ligamentous structure is the oblique interosseous ligament, referred to
as Lisfranc ligament. Originating on the lateral surface of the medial cuneiform, it
passes in front of the intercuneiform ligament and ultimately inserts on the medial
aspect of the second MT base near the plantar surface.

Mechanism
Direct and indirect injury patterns can damage the Lisfranc joint. Direct mechanisms, most commonly crush injuries, are due to high-energy blunt trauma to the
dorsum of the foot. These often result in worse clinical outcome as compared with
indirect types, secondary to the associated soft tissue trauma. The indirect mechanism usually involves axial loading of a plantarflexed foot, external rotation on a
pronated forefoot, or an abduction stress to the midfoot. Indirect mechanisms are
stratified into high-energy and low-energy subtypes. Motor vehicle accidents are the
most common cause of high-energy Lisfranc injury. Low-energy injuries include
those incurred during athletic competition. The fracture pattern and direction
of dislocation in direct injuries are dependent on the force vector applied. Indirect
injuries are more predictable and most commonly involve failure of the weaker dorsal
TMT ligaments in tension with subsequent dorsal or dorsolateral MT dislocation.

Workup and Diagnosis
The diagnosis of high-energy Lisfranc injuries is straightforward; physical exam will
reveal swelling and many times obvious deformity, including widening or flattening
of the forefoot. Additionally, it might be an open injury with disruption of the skin
and subcutaneous tissue. TMT joint injury and intercuneiform disruption is suggested
in the presence of a gap between the first and second toes, known as a positive gap
sign. Although associated vascular injury is rare, it may be difficult to palpate a dorsalis pedis pulse secondary to swelling. The clinician must also consider a concurrent
compartment syndrome with severe swelling and pain with passive dorsiflexion of
the toes. If unsure, measurement of pressures is warranted.
In the setting of a low-energy injury, physical exam may only reveal a patient
with an inability to bear weight and possibly midfoot and forefoot swelling. Paying attention to the reported mechanism and the clinical appearance of the foot is
pivotal to making the correct diagnosis. An additional finding may be plantar arch
ecchymosis, which is considered pathognomonic for Lisfranc injury. To increase the
accuracy of diagnosis, various tests and stress maneuvers have been described to aid

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

327

in the diagnosis of subtle injury. Of note, pain on passive abduction and pronation
of the forefoot is suggestive of injury to the TMT complex.
Initial imaging to obtain include nonweightbearing anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and 30-degree oblique views of the foot (Figures 36–1A, 36–1B, and 36–1C).

C

Figure 36–1. (A) AP, (B) lateral, and (C) oblique radiographs demonstrating a divergent Lisfranc injury
of the right foot.

328

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

However, 50% of subtle Lisfranc injuries will have normal nonweightbearing imaging.
Thus to diagnose these injuries, a weightbearing film with both feet on a single
cassette or an abduction-pronation stress view should be obtained. Admittedly,
these are rarely obtained secondary to pain, necessitating a bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Computed tomography may be beneficial as a diagnostic
adjunct, as it is effective at delineating fractures.
On the AP radiograph, findings suggestive of a Lisfranc injury include incongruity
at the first and second MT joints, misalignment of the medial border of the second
MT and medial border of the middle cuneiform, and a diastasis of ê 2 mm between
the first and second MTs as compared with the contralateral foot (Figure 36–1A).
The oblique radiograph should show alignment of the medial border of the fourth
MT and the medial border of the cuboid in a normal foot (Figure 36–1C). Misalignment may suggest a TMT joint complex injury. Potentially seen on this view as well
as the AP is the “fleck” sign, as described by Myerson et al. It refers to the presence
of a small bony fragment between the base of the second MT and the medial cuneiform and represents an avulsion of either the proximal or distal attachment of the
Lisfranc ligament. The lateral radiograph will show flattening of the longitudinal
arch and/or dorsal displacement at the second TMT joint (Figure 36–1B). The fifth
MT is normally plantar in relation to the medial cuneiform. Flattening of the midfoot arch positions the medial cuneiform plantar to the fifth MT.

TREATMENT
Indications for both operative and nonoperative treatment exist, all with the goal of
reestablishing a painless and stable foot. Any disruption of normal anatomy warrants
surgical correction. Nonoperative treatment is limited to stable TMT joint complex
injuries and include those that are nondisplaced, without fracture, and stable under
radiographic stress examination. Treatment involves protected weightbearing in
a Cam Walker® boot, with frequent follow-up radiographs to ensure no change
in alignment. It takes approximately 4 months to recover from a nonsurgical
Lisfranc injury.
In unstable Lisfranc injuries, open-reduction internal fixation is performed
to restore anatomic alignment. Commonly, screw fixation is used to fix the first,
second, and third TMT joints, whereas the fourth and fifth may be pinned with
K-wires. Although this is one common approach to operative management, many
forms of fixation are available and depend on both the nature of the injury and the
surgeon’s preference. Although controversial, TMT joint arthrodesis is recommended
by some for purely ligamentous Lisfranc injuries. Traditionally, this procedure
was considered a salvage operation for failed ORIF and in cases of posttraumatic
arthritis. Postoperatively, protected weightbearing for 3 to 5 months and therapy
emphasizing passive midfoot range of motion are allowed. Regardless of the modality,
anatomic alignment is the standard to decrease the risk of posttraumatic arthritis,
chronic instability, and pain.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
36.1 A 40-year-old equestrian complains of right midfoot pain associated with difficulty ambulating for the last 2 days, when her foot got caught in a stirrup
while riding. Radiographs show a 4-mm diastasis between the first and second
metatarsals. What is the most appropriate treatment?
A. Open-reduction internal fixation
B. Nonweightbearing in a short leg cast
C. Weightbearing as tolerated in an aircast
D. Chevron osteotomy
36.2 A football player who is lying on the ground after being tackled attempts to
stand up. While he is still prone on the ground, another player falls directly on
his left heel. He immediately experiences midfoot pain and is unable to place
any weight on his left foot. In this setting, what should the team physician be
most concerned about?
A. High ankle sprain
B. Achilles tendon rupture
C. Lisfranc injury
D. Ankle fracture
36.3 A 54-year-old woman sustains a twisting injury to her foot. An AP radiograph
of the foot reveals a 4-mm diastasis between the first and second metatarsals.
Which structure connects the medial cuneiform to the base of the second
metatarsal?
A. Chopart ligament
B. Deltoid ligament
C. Lisfranc ligament
D. Spring ligament

ANSWERS
36.1 A. The patient has sustained an injury to her TMT joint complex. The
Lisfranc ligament, which connects the base of the second metatarsal to the
medial cuneiform, has been disrupted. Anatomic reduction of the Lisfranc
joint is necessary and in this case requires open reduction and internal fixation. Postoperatively, protected weightbearing for 3 to 5 months and therapy
emphasizing passive midfoot range of motion are allowed. Posttraumatic arthritis, midfoot instability, and pain are the long-term outcomes of a nonreduced
joint.

330

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

36.2 C. Lisfranc injuries are common in football players, with up to approximately
4% of American football players sustaining them each season. External rotation on a pronated forefoot is responsible for this and can lead to an unstable Lisfranc ligamentous injury. Other sports in which TMT joint complex
injuries are encountered include equestrian events and windsurfing, in which
the use of a stirrup can lead to one’s forefoot being abducted around a fixed
hindfoot. When this occurs, dislocation of the second metatarsal and lateral
displacement of the other metatarsals occurs.
36.3 C. This woman sustained a TMT joint complex injury, as evidenced by the
large diastasis between the first and second metatarsals. The most significant
and strongest ligamentous structure of the TMT joint complex is the oblique
interosseous ligament, more commonly referred to as the Lisfranc ligament.
Originating on the lateral surface of the medial cuneiform, it passes in front
of the intercuneiform ligament and ultimately inserts on the medial aspect of
the second MT base near the plantar surface. A, B, and D are incorrect—the
Chopart, or bifurcate, ligament provides stability to the calcaneocuboid joint;
the Deltoid ligament stabilizes the medial side of the ankle; and the Spring
ligament stabilizes the talonavicular joint.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The Lisfranc joint refers to the TMT joint complex, an osseous and capsuloligamentous network that includes the 5 metatarsals, their articulations
with the cuneiforms and cuboid, and the Lisfranc ligament.



Radiographic findings indicative of a Lisfranc injury include diastasis of
≥ 2 mm between the first and second MTs as compared with the contralateral foot, the fleck sign, flattening of the longitudinal arch of the foot,
and dorsal displacement at the second TMT joint.



The goal of both operative and nonoperative management of Lisfranc
injuries is restoration of the normal anatomy of the TMT joint complex.



Open-reduction internal fixation is the predominant surgical intervention
for unstable Lisfranc injuries.



Posttraumatic arthritis, chronic instability, and pain are the long-term
complications associated with inadequate and nonanatomic reduction of
the Lisfranc joint and its structures.

CASE 37
A 51-year-old man presents to the emergency department (ED) after falling 6 feet
from a ladder onto his left foot while moving heavy boxes. The patient has no
past medical history, works as a self-employed engineer, and is a nonsmoker. On
initial presentation, he complains of isolated left foot and heel pain. He states he
cannot bear any weight on his affected limb. Physical exam of the foot reveals no
open wounds, marked soft tissue swelling, ecchymosis, and tenderness to palpation. Sensation to light touch is grossly preserved, but his ankle and foot range of
motion is significantly limited by pain. Pedal pulses are palpable and symmetric
to the contralateral side. Initial radiographic evaluation with anteroposterior (AP),

ANSWERS TO CASE 37:
Calcaneus Fracture
Summary: A 51-year-old man presents with left foot pain, swelling, and ecchymosis
after a 6-foot fall. He is unable to bear weight on his left foot. Radiographs are consistent with a left displaced intraarticular joint depression calcaneus fracture.
• Most likely diagnosis: Displaced intraarticular joint depression calcaneus fracture.
• Additional studies: To further define the calcaneus fracture pattern and plan
for definitive management, an axial computed tomography (CT) scan of the
left calcaneus should be obtained. Coronal and sagittal plane reconstructions
are frequently useful as well. Physical exam of the spine with further imaging
is indicated, as there is a 10% incidence of associated spine injuries with calcaneus fractures. Although this patient complains of isolated foot pain, other
regions such as the ipsilateral hip and knee should also be examined for pain,
and if pain is present, appropriate radiographs of the affected area should be
obtained.
• Treatment options: Nonoperative with immobilization in a nonweightbearing
short leg splint or cast; open-reduction internal fixation.
• Potential complications: Wound complications/infection, calcaneal malunion,
peroneal tendon irritation, anterior ankle impingement, subtalar arthritis, calcaneocuboid arthritis.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the calcaneus fracture pattern using AP, lateral, and Harris radiographs.
2. Define and measure the Bohler angle and the critical angle of Gissane.
3. Recognize the fracture pattern on CT scan and apply the Sanders classification.
4. Understand the indications for open-reduction internal fixation.
5. Identify common complications of either nonoperative or operative treatment.

Considerations
On initial presentation of a fractured calcaneus, the patient’s chief complaint will
be pain about the hindfoot and an inability to bear weight on the affected limb.
Observation of the skin and soft tissues may reveal soft tissue swelling, ecchymosis, and fracture blisters. The limb must be fully uncovered and circumferentially
examined. A detailed motor and sensory examination should be performed. Because
of the violent nature of the axial heel loading, there often exist fine disturbances to
the plantar sensory nerves, which should be fully documented. A pulse exam must

336

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

similarly be documented. Any lacerations, typically medially, reflect an open calcaneal fracture unless proven otherwise. Open fractures, especially those associated
with contamination, should undergo emergent debridement and irrigation in the
operative theatre.
Extensive soft tissue swelling may also predispose the patient to compartment
syndrome of the foot. There are 9 compartments within the foot, which are individually defined by an inflexible investing fascia. As muscle swelling increases, the
closed spaces within the foot do not permit an increase in volume, and the individual
compartment becomes pressurized. This pressure head exceeds the venous outflow
pressure, which results in ischemia to the nervous and muscular components in a
time-dependent manner. The most common signs are increasing pain requirements
and pain on passive stretch, specifically great toe abduction and adduction. Diagnosis requires a coherent patient, not under the influence of excessive sedating medications. If the patient is unable to interact appropriately, pressure measurements may
be objectively obtained through needle manometry. If compartment syndrome is
present, the compartments must be emergently released via surgical fasciotomies.
In addition to the calcaneus fracture, the patient may present with additional
injuries. A thorough history and physical exam should be performed, with additional
imaging obtained as indicated. Approximately 10% of patients with calcaneus
fractures have associated spine injuries, and upward of 26% of patients have
other extremity injuries. Missed injuries can be avoided by a careful clinical and
radiographic evaluation of the coherent patient at the time of injury.

APPROACH TO:
Calcaneus Fracture
DEFINITIONS
INTRAARTICULAR: With respect to the calcaneus, a fracture that extends into
the subtalar joint. More specifically, a fracture that exists within the posterior facet
of the talocalcaneal articulation.
EXTRAARTICULAR: The fracture does not extend into the subtalar joint, particularly the posterior facet of the talocalcaneal articulation.
BOHLER ANGLE: An angle created from the intersection of 2 radiographic lines
observed on a lateral calcaneus x-ray. The first line connects the most cephalad
point of the calcaneal anterior process with the most cephalad point of the calcaneal
posterior facet. The second line connects the most cephalad point of the calcaneal
posterior facet with the most cephalad point of the calcaneal tuberosity. An uninjured calcaneus typically demonstrates an angle between 20 and 40 degrees.
CRITICAL ANGLE OF GISSANE: Another angle created from the intersection
of 2 radiographic lines observed on the lateral calcaneus x-ray. The first line runs
tangential along the superior aspect of the anterior process. The second line runs
tangential to the superior border of the posterior facet. A typical value for the uninjured calcaneus measures between 95 and 105 degrees.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

337

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiology
Fractures of the calcaneus typically result from high-energy trauma such as falls from
a height or motor vehicle collision and represent approximately 2% of all fractures.

DIAGNOSIS
Initial radiographic evaluation of a suspected calcaneus fracture should include an
AP of the foot, lateral of the foot, and a Harris axial projection, along with AP, lateral, and mortise views of the ankle. These radiographs will help classify the fracture
pattern, whether joint depression or tongue type. The diagnosis is most evident on
the lateral projection, which will demonstrate the degree of calcaneal compression
quantified by the Bohler angle (Figure 37–4). The degree of height loss has prognostic implications, with a smaller Bohler angle correlating with poorer functional
outcomes. CT will help identify each fracture line and fracture fragment. Reformats
in the coronal and sagittal planes parallel the findings in the Harris axial and lateral
views, respectively. Additional information can be obtained from the CT, including an
evaluation of lateral wall expulsion and peroneal tendon impingement or dislocation.
From the CT scan, the fracture can be classified according to Sanders. The posterior facet is divided into 3 fragments: lateral, central, and medial. With the addition of the sustentaculum, there are 4 defined fragments. The primary fracture line is
identified and the number of fragments created by the fracture line is noted. A letter
is assigned to where the fracture line crosses the posterior facet. The number and
location of posterior facet fracture lines have been demonstrated to correlate with
outcomes after surgical fixation, with poorer outcome measures associated with more
comminuted patterns. The collective information obtained by careful evaluation of
the radiographs and CT scan aid in definitive management and preoperative planning.

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

TREATMENT
Nonoperative
Nonoperative treatment consists of early ankle and subtalar range-of-motion
exercises and nonweightbearing for approximately 3 months. Initial management
consists of splinting the foot and ankle in neutral dorsiflexion to prevent an equinus
contracture, ice, elevation, and pain control. Once the swelling subsides, the splint is
removed while ankle and subtalar range-of-motion exercises are performed. Clinical
and radiographic follow-up is carried out at routine intervals to document healing.
Specific indications for nonoperative treatment include a nondisplaced fracture, a
patient too physiologically compromised to tolerate surgery, or a nonambulatory
patient. In addition, patients unable or unwilling to comply with postoperative
weightbearing restrictions are best managed nonoperatively. Factors that affect local
wound healing, such as a history of smoking, severe peripheral vascular disease, or
insulin-dependent diabetes, are relative contraindications to surgery.

Open-Reduction Internal Fixation
Historically, fractures of the calcaneus were treated nonoperatively by means of
re-impacting the fracture by striking the lateral heel with a hammer. Surgeons would
rather perform this procedure over open surgery because of fears over infection, malunion, nonunion, and need for amputation. With the development of aseptic techniques and the modern principles of reduction and fixation, calcaneal surgery could
be performed with an improved complication profile. A prospective, randomized,
controlled multicenter trial by Buckley et al warrants mention. In this study, 309
patients were prospectively randomized to either nonoperative or operative treatment and followed for a minimum of 2 years. Operative treatment demonstrated
improved outcomes in women, patients not receiving worker’s compensation, young
men (< 30 years of age), patients with a higher Bohler angle, patients with a lighter
workload, and patients with a simple displaced intraarticular fracture pattern.
Anatomic reductions also improved outcomes. Patients treated nonoperatively were
more likely to require late arthrodesis. As our understanding of the outcomes of
nonoperative and operative treatment improves, we can identify those patients best
managed by open-reduction internal fixation.
Once the decision has been made to proceed with open-reduction internal fixation, timing and surgical treatment goals must be discussed. Timing of surgery is an
important consideration. Calcaneal fractures are the result of high-energy trauma,
and the associated soft tissue injury is often extensive. Incisions across a compromised soft tissue envelope risk postoperative wound complications and deep sepsis.
Serous and hemorrhagic fracture blisters should be unroofed and treated with dry
bandages until epithelialization occurs. Despite signs of healing, the blister beds
should be avoided if possible. Before surgical intervention, the foot must achieve
soft tissue quiescence. This readiness of the soft tissues is indicated by the appearance of fine skin wrinkles with passive foot dorsiflexion, known as a positive “wrinkle test.” A waiting period of 10 to 14 days is common before proceeding to surgery.
Although waiting for an appropriate surgical window is critical, treatment within
the first 3 weeks is recommended to avoid a malunion. This is a situation in which

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

339

the fracture heals in an undesirable position. The malunited calcaneus is frequently
shortened and in varus.
The goal of surgical intervention is to anatomically restore the calcaneus. Critical components in this restoration include anatomic reduction of the posterior
facet and reconstitution of calcaneal height, width, and length. Medial and lateral
approaches to fixation have been described. An extensile lateral approach is most
often used. The vertical limb of the incision is made anterior to the lateral border of
the Achilles tendon and continued in a right angle fashion horizontally along the
border of the foot where the glabrous and plantar skin meet. This approach allows
for direct reduction of the anterior process, the posterior facet, and the tuberosity.
Kirschner wires can be used to temporarily hold the reduction, which should be
checked fluoroscopically and under direct visualization. Calcaneal height is checked
on the lateral view. Width and varus heel positioning is imaged on the axial view.
The reduction of the posterior facet is directly visualized and can be imaged through
the use of the Broden view. Once the reduction is satisfactory, the Kirschner wires
are replaced with screws or a combination of screws and plates for the final construct. Careful handling of the flap is crucial during wound closure to minimize the
risk of skin necrosis and wound complications. A Hemovac drain is typically left
in place and a splint applied in neutral dorsiflexion to prevent an equinus contracture. Postoperative radiographs and CT are performed to check the accuracy of the
reduction. The patient is made nonweightbearing for approximately 3 months, at
the discretion of the treating surgeon. During the healing period, range-of-motion
exercises for the ankle and subtalar joint can be initiated as soon as the incision
appears stable and healing. Postoperative follow-up is at routine intervals to document fracture healing. Good to excellent results can be achieved with an anatomic
articular reduction.

Complications
Subtalar Arthritis: Posttraumatic arthritis of the subtalar joint can develop after
both nonoperative and operative treatment. A nonanatomic articular reduction and
cartilage damage from the injury itself are the primary contributing factors. Patients
will primarily complain of pain. The pain is dependent on activity and worsens as
the day progresses. As a result of subtalar stiffness, patients will complain that it is
difficult to navigate over uneven walking surfaces. Radiographic evaluation with
standard x-rays and CT may reveal joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation,
and subchondral sclerosis. Injecting a local anesthetic into the subtalar joint and
documenting relief of symptoms can confirm the diagnosis. Nonoperative measures
include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, shoe wear modifications, or
custom orthoses. These measures should be tried before operative intervention is
considered. If nonoperative measures fail, operative treatment consists of a subtalar
fusion.
Wound Complications/Infection: The most common complication after openreduction internal fixation is related to the surgical wound. Wound complications
including dehiscence and infection have been noted to occur in up to 20% of
patients with closed fractures. The reported rates of deep infections and calcaneal

340

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

osteomyelitis range from 0% to 20% in closed fractures and from 19% to 31% in
open fractures. Cellulitis and superficial wound sloughs can be treated with dressing
changes and the administration of antibiotics. Persistent drainage or purulence
necessitates open debridement coupled with administration of antibiotics. In the
case of superficial infection, the hardware can be retained. If a deep infection is
noted or there is evidence of diffuse osteomyelitis at the time of open debridement,
the hardware must be removed. Patient selection, meticulous surgical technique,
and compliance with postoperative protocols can minimize the risks of wound
complications.
Calcaneocuboid Arthritis: Arthritis can develop after both nonoperative and
operative treatment secondary to an imperfect reduction of the anterolateral
fragment. Similar to the diagnosis of subtalar arthritis detailed previously, physical
exam, radiographs, and a trial injection can be performed to elucidate whether
the calcaneocuboid joint is the source of the patient’s pain. First-line treatment
is nonoperative with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, shoe wear
modifications, or custom orthoses. If nonoperative treatment fails, calcaneocuboid
fusion may be considered and is typically performed in conjunction with a
talonavicular and talocalcaneal fusion.
Peroneal Irritation: This occurs more commonly in patients managed
nonoperatively. During the axial loading event, the lateral wall often becomes
a separate fragment, which translates laterally. Both the peroneus longus and
brevis tendons traverse the lateral calcaneus in this region and are subjected to
compression and irritation. Dislocations or subluxations are common. Operative
treatment addresses both the lateral wall displacement and the peroneal tendon
instability. In operative cases, postoperative scarring or prominent hardware is more
frequently the culprit. The initial treatment is nonoperative with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications and shoe wear modifications or orthotics. Elective surgery
includes removal of hardware, lateral wall reconstruction, or exostectomy, along
with a peroneal tendon reconstruction. These procedures should be considered if
the patient is experiencing pain refractory to nonoperative measures.
Anterior Ankle Impingement: Anterior ankle impingement can occur after
nonoperative or operative treatment. The impingement is the result of loss of
calcaneal height and a decreased lateral talocalcaneal angle. With nonoperative
management or incomplete restoration of calcaneal height, the talus adopts a
pathologic horizontal position. The result is direct contact with the dorsal talar neck
and the anterior tibial plafond. On clinical evaluation, the patients present with pain
and restriction in ankle dorsiflexion. Often the examiner can feel a firm block when
the ankle is passively dorsiflexed. Surgical management can include exostectomy of
the talar osteophytes, but distraction subtalar bone block fusion is the preferred
procedure. The goal of this procedure is to restore the calcaneal height and thus
create an improved lateral talocalcaneal angle.
Calcaneal Malunion: Malunion can occur in both nonoperative and operative
management of calcaneal fractures. Varus angulation of the hindfoot is the
most common residual deformity. This usually occurs from a varus malunion of

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

341

the tuberosity. Treatment with subtalar fusion and a calcaneal osteotomy has been
described, with variations, by several authors. To plan the malunion repair, Stephens
and Sanders developed a CT classification for malunions. Type I involves a large
lateral exostosis with or without arthrosis of the subtalar joint and is treated with
peroneal tenolysis and a lateral exostectomy. Type II involves a lateral exostosis with
arthrosis across the subtalar joint and is treated with peroneal tenolysis, a lateral
exostectomy, and in situ subtalar fusion. Type III involves a lateral exostosis, severe
subtalar arthrosis, and varus or valgus angulation of the calcaneal body and is treated
with peroneal tenolysis, a lateral exostectomy, subtalar fusion, and a calcaneal
osteotomy.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
37.1 A 29-year-old man presents with significant right hindfoot swelling and pain
after a 25-foot jump from a cliff. Imaging confirms a comminuted intraarticular calcaneus fracture involving the posterior facet. As the treating physician,
you request that radiographs of the spine be obtained. What percentage of
patients with fractures of the calcaneus have associated spine injuries?
A. 10%
B. 30%
C. 50%
D. 80%
37.2 Which of the following factors is associated with worse outcomes after operative treatment of fractures of the calcaneus?
A. Female sex
B. Age < 30 years
C. Worker’s compensation
D. Bohler angle > 0 degrees
E. Simple articular fracture pattern
37.3 A 42-year-old man presents with a displaced comminuted intraarticular calcaneus fracture. On physical exam, there is extensive soft tissue swelling and
hemorrhagic blisters. The patient is splinted and discharged home, as the soft
tissues are not ready for open-reduction internal fixation. He returns to clinic
10 days later with clawing of his toes. What is the most likely explanation for
this finding?
A. Tendon laceration from displaced fracture fragment
B. Nerve injury from displaced fracture fragment
C. Compartment syndrome
D. Weakness secondary to pain and prolonged immobilization

342

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

ANSWERS
37.1 A. Approximately 10% of patients who present with calcaneus fractures
have associated spine injuries. A thorough history and physical exam, with
additional imaging as indicated, is important to avoid missed injuries.
37.2 C. A prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial by Buckley
et al followed 309 patients for a period of 2 to 8 years. Overall the outcomes
for nonoperative and operative management were not found to be different. After closer examination of the patient population, operative treatment
demonstrated improved outcomes in women, patients not receiving worker’s compensation, young men (< 30 years), patients with a higher Bohler
angle, patients with a lighter workload, and patients with a simple displaced
intraarticular fracture pattern. Anatomic reductions also improved outcomes.
Patients treated nonoperatively were more likely to require late arthrodesis.
37.3 C. Foot compartment syndrome is a known complication of calcaneus fractures.
There are 9 compartments within the foot, which are individually defined by
an inflexible investing fascia. As muscle swelling increases, the closed spaces
within the foot do not permit an increase in volume, and the individual compartment becomes pressurized. This pressure head exceeds the venous outflow
pressure, which results in ischemia to the nervous and muscular components
in a time-dependent manner. If this is unrecognized, nerve and muscle death
occur. This can result in contractures of the muscles in the affected compartments, which is evident on clinical evaluation.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Fractures of the calcaneus represent high-energy trauma with a significant incidence of associated spine and extremity injuries. A thorough history and physical exam are crucial at the time of presentation.



AP, lateral, and Harris radiographs should be ordered along with a CT
scan in the axial plane with sagittal and coronal reconstructions to evaluate the fracture pattern and plan for treatment.



Open-reduction internal fixation should be delayed until soft tissue swelling is reduced and blisters have epithelialized.



Wound complications including dehiscence and infection are the most
common problems associated with operative management.



Outcomes after operative treatment are best in women, non–worker’s
compensation cases, young (age < 30 years) men, higher Bohler angle
(> 0 degrees), patients with a lighter workload, and those with simple
articular fracture patterns.

CASE 38
A 19-year-old woman presents to the office complaining of dull right thigh pain
for the past 2 months. She denies any trauma or inciting events over that time.
The pain was initially present only while walking and after other physical activities
but has progressed and is present at rest. It now disrupts her sleep at night. She
is otherwise healthy and denies any fevers, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. On
physical exam, her right lower extremity is neurovascularly intact. Her knee has full
range of motion, and there is no warmth or erythema. However, you do note mild
swelling of her distal thigh and on palpation appreciate a mass in that region. An
anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the distal femur is shown in Figure 38–1.

Figure 38–1. AP view of the distal femur. Many of the radiographic features of this osteosarcoma
mark it as a malignant tumor. The abnormal area of mottled lucent and sclerotic tumor in the
metaphysis fades gradually into the shadows of surrounding normal bone. It is difficult to see where
the tumor begins and ends; there is a large soft-tissue mass adjacent to the bone (M). The periosteum has been unable to maintain a shell of mineralized new bone around this mass. The sclerotic
areas within the bone and the mineralized portions of the soft-tissue mass both have a relatively
amorphous, smudged appearance that is seen with calcified osteoid matrix. (Reproduced, with

ANSWERS TO CASE 38:
Osteosarcoma
Summary: This is a 19-year-old otherwise healthy woman who presents with a
2-month history of dull right thigh pain that was initially activity dependent but has
progressed and is now most severe at rest, especially at night. She denies any fevers,
chills, night sweats, or recent weight loss. A mass in her distal thigh is palpated on
examination. An AP plain radiograph illustrates a soft-tissue mass adjacent to a
mottled lucent and sclerotic lesion in the metaphysis of her right femur.
• Most likely diagnosis: Pathologic bone tumor, specifically osteosarcoma.
• Next steps in workup: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right lower
extremity, tissue biopsy, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, and a
bone scan.
• Treatment approach: Multidisciplinary approach ultimately dependent on
tumor grade and type of osteosarcoma.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the important history, physical exam, and radiographic findings
consistent with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma.
2. Know the essential components of the workup for a musculoskeletal lesion, specifically an osteosarcoma.
3. Appreciate the need for a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and how the
Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Staging System (MSTS, Enneking) influences it.

Considerations
There are many important clinical, radiographic, and pathologic findings that will
aid the orthopaedist in establishing the proper diagnosis in the setting of a likely
musculoskeletal tumor, as in this case. Diagnosis begins with the history and physical
exam. Concerning findings in this patient include her progression of pain symptoms,
to the point where it awakens her from sleep, and the presence of a palpable mass.
Age is another important consideration, especially for establishing an appropriate
differential diagnosis. Furthermore, some tumors have a sex predilection; osteosarcoma is more common in males. Laboratory tests are not typically diagnostic for
bone tumors, but may be helpful once a diagnosis is made. Imaging must begin with
at least 2 plain radiographic views of the lesion. An MRI is typically obtained after
and has become the imaging modality of choice for most musculoskeletal tumors.
Nuclear imaging and CT are also performed for evaluation of metastases, staging,
and surveillance. Biopsy of the lesion allows for histologic analysis, which determines tumor grade and significantly impacts treatment options and ultimate prognosis. After this workup, a multidisciplinary treatment plan can be developed in
conjunction with both the oncologist and orthopaedic surgeon.

APPROACH TO:
Osteosarcoma
DEFINITIONS
CODMAN TRIANGLE: A radiographic finding of new subperiosteal bone created when a lesion elevates the periosteum away from bone. Although it can appear
triangular, it is often a pseudotriangle on plain radiographs with a 2-sided appearance owing to tumor growing at a faster rate than the periosteum can expand.
MSTS (ENNEKING) STAGING SYSTEM: Most recognized staging system for
malignant bone tumors. It is based on tumor grade (low, high), extent (intracompartmental, extracompartmental), and the presence or absence of metastases. In general,
low-grade, localized tumors are stage I; high-grade, localized tumors are stage II; and
metastatic tumors (regardless of grade) are stage III. Each stage is further categorized
into type a and b subsets, representative of intra- versus extracompartmental disease,
respectively.
LIMB-SALVAGE SURGERY: A constellation of surgical procedures designed to
achieve removal of a malignant tumor and reconstruction of a limb with an acceptable oncologic, functional, and cosmetic result.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Osteosarcoma is the most common bone sarcoma, affecting approximately 560
children and adolescents annually in the United States. Its incidence peaks in the
second decade of life and is most commonly seen at sites of rapid bone turnover,
such as the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and proximal femur.
Although most cases of osteosarcoma are sporadic, those that carry the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1) or who have Li-Fraumeni syndrome
(p53 gene) are predisposed.
There are multiple subtypes of osteosarcoma, including low-grade, high-grade,
and telangiectatic intramedullary variants, as well as parosteal, periosteal, and highgrade surface types. This discussion pertains to the classic, most common subtype,
which accounts for approximately 80% of all osteosarcomas, the high-grade intramedullary osteosarcoma.
The history and physical exam are crucial in the initial diagnosis of osteosarcoma. A common presenting complaint is new-onset pain over several months duration; it may occur at rest, disrupt sleep, or only occur after physical activity. This
complaint must be investigated with due diligence by the clinician. Pain associated
with weightbearing or activity is typically due to an inflammatory process. However,
pain at rest or at night is biologic pain possibly secondary to the growth of a lesion in
bone. A patient with an osteosarcoma may also present with a palpable mass in the
extremity that is painful. Symptoms such as fevers, chills, weight loss, and fatigue
are late signs of disease.
After a physical exam, plain radiographs of the region in question must be
obtained. An osteosarcoma classically arises from the metaphyseal region of a
bone and appears as a mixed sclerotic and lytic lesion that can infiltrate bone and

surrounding cortex, causing a periosteal reaction and soft tissue mass. A Codman
triangle may be seen on radiographs (Figure 38–2). Plain radiographs concerning for
a malignant bone lesion require advanced imaging, such as an MRI, to evaluate for
surrounding soft tissue, neurovascular, and bone marrow involvement, as well as skip
lesions, which represent discontinuous metastases.
A biopsy of the lesion is required when the imaging, examination, and history are
consistent with a pathologic process; it is the only definitive means of determining
whether a tumor is benign or malignant. An orthopaedic oncologist must perform
the biopsy, which, if improperly obtained, can compromise the ability to perform
limb salvage procedures. Definitive osteosarcoma resection must include the biopsy
tract, as it too can be contaminated with tumor cells. In the setting of osteosarcoma,
histologic analysis often shows diffuse cellular atypia with nuclear pleomorphism
and “lacey” osteoid matrix production.
Laboratory testing is not diagnostic for osteosarcoma, but does play a role in its
workup and management. Before initiation of chemotherapy, laboratory values (ie,
complete blood count with differential, basic metabolic profile, renal and liver function values) must be obtained to provide a baseline assessment of organ function.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

349

Additionally, elevated alkaline phosphatase (up to 2-3 times the normal value) and
lactate dehydrogenase levels are considered poor prognostic factors.
Chest CT and bone scan evaluate for metastatic disease, which is the most
important prognostic and staging factor in osteosarcoma. In approximately 10% of
patients, pulmonary or lymph node metastases are detected at presentation. It is not
uncommon for osteosarcoma to have early hematogenous metastases. Micrometastases, which are undetectable with conventional imaging, are likely present in the
lungs in most patients on initial presentation and without appropriate treatment
will become evident on imaging within 1 to 2 years. A bone scan will be “hot” in
osteosarcoma, specifically in areas of tumor. Those areas of the body showing increased
metabolic activity must be further evaluated with imaging.
The majority of patients with osteosarcoma present as having Enneking stage
IIB disease at diagnosis. For most types, treatment is multimodal. Two to three
cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are commonly given before wide-margin surgical
resection is performed, which involves achieving the largest possible margin without
unnecessary functional sacrifice. Fortunately, approximately 90% of patients with
osteosarcoma are able to undergo limb salvage procedures and do not require
amputation. The excised segment of bone may be replaced with a prosthesis and/or
allograft. Postoperative chemotherapy is also typically used. Radiation is not used in
the treatment of osteosarcoma.
The overall 5-year survival rates of patients with osteosarcoma are 60% to 80%.
With the initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocols, 5-year survival rates
are almost 80% in patients with nonmetastatic disease and 10% to 20% in patients
with metastatic disease. In addition to elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactate
dehydrogenase, poor prognostic factors include metastatic disease at diagnosis, a
poor response to chemotherapy (defined as < 90% necrosis of resected tumor),
and pathologic fracture.

38.1 C. The distal femur is the most common location of osteosarcoma. This is followed by the proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and then the axial skeleton
(ie, spine and sacrum).
38.2 A. Poor prognostic factors include elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactate
dehydrogenase, metastatic disease at diagnosis, a poor response to chemotherapy (defined as < 90% necrosis of resected tumor), and pathologic fracture.
38.3 C. Histologic analysis of osteosarcoma often reveals diffuse cellular atypia
with nuclear pleomorphism and “lacey” osteoid matrix production. Other
malignant characteristics include stromal cells with atypia, a high nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio, and abnormal mitotic figures. A describes a Ewing sarcoma,
B a giant cell tumor, and D an aneurysmal bone cyst.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The history and physical exam are crucial in the initial diagnosis of osteosarcoma.



MRI is effective at evaluating an osteosarcoma because it can clearly
identify surrounding soft tissue, neurovascular and bone marrow involvement, and skip lesions, which represent discontinuous metastases.



Chest CT and bone scan are used to evaluate for metastatic disease.



The majority of patients with osteosarcoma present with Enneking stage
IIB disease at diagnosis.



Treatment commonly involves neoadjuvant chemotherapy, limb-salvage
surgery, and postoperative chemotherapy.



The overall 5-year survival rates of patients with osteosarcoma are 60%
to 80%.

CASE 39
A 73-year-old man is seen in the outpatient clinic with complaints of right knee
pain, 6 months in duration. He denies recent trauma and is otherwise without
significant medical problems. He states that over the past several years, he has
had a progressive “dull ache” in his knee. The near constant pain wakes him at
least 3 times per week. Last month, he started using a golf cart instead of walking
between holes and now borrows a friend’s cane when walking long distances. He
states that his right leg feels “unstable.” He denies fevers, weight loss, and recent
illnesses, and he takes only acetaminophen as needed for pain relief. Family history
is unremarkable. On physical exam of his right knee, there is no obvious effusion,
erythema, or drainage. He has joint line tenderness, most prominent on the lateral
aspect of his knee, and he exhibits a slight genu valgum. There is crepitus with
range of motion. A 5-degree flexion contracture is noted when he is fully extended,
and he can only flex the knee to 100 degrees. He is neurovascularly and ligamentously intact. He has brought an x-ray of his right knee, taken last month at his
primary care doctor’s office (Figure 39–1).

ANSWERS TO CASE 39:
Total Knee Arthroplasty
Summary: A relatively healthy 73-year-old man presents with progressive right knee
pain. His pain is severe enough that it has caused him to change his daily activities,
has caused him to start using a cane, and wakes him at night. Exam reveals crepitus,
lateral joint line tenderness, and a limited range of motion. He denies a history of
traumatic injury and exhibits neither signs nor symptoms of infection.
• Most likely diagnosis: Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) of the right
knee.
• Next diagnostic test: Obtain plain radiographs of bilateral knees, including
weightbearing posteroanterior and lateral views in approximately 45 degrees
of flexion, a tunnel or notch view, and Merchant (sunrise) views of the patellofemoral joint.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

355

• Next step in therapy: Conservative therapy including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, or selective COX-2 inhibitors); physical therapy is sometimes recommended to help
strengthen the muscles around the knee, including the hamstrings, gastrocsoleus complex, and quadriceps. Assistive devices such as canes, crutches, and
walkers can be used as well to offset some of the joint reactive forces stressing
the knee.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the presentation of DJD of the knee and understand the salient
aspects of patient history necessary to guide treatment.
2. Develop a standard treatment algorithm for DJD of the knee.
3. Understand the surgical options available for the treatment of knee arthritis.
4. Understand common potential complications after total knee arthroplasty.

Considerations
There are several differential diagnoses that must be considered in any patient with
nonacute traumatic joint pain. Common etiologies include osteoarthritis, also
referred to as degenerative joint disease (DJD), inflammatory arthritis, osteonecrosis,
and posttraumatic arthritis. Given this patient’s atraumatic history and his lack of
fevers, joint erythema, or other systemic inflammatory symptomatology, osteoarthritis is the most likely diagnosis. Specifics for workup of these alternate diagnoses are
considered later in this chapter. This 73-year-old male presents with signs, symptoms, and radiographic findings consistent with right knee osteoarthritis, specifically the lateral compartment. In a patient who has had no previous intervention
to address his symptoms, the first priority is pain relief. There are many options
for pain relief, including acetaminophen, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections, and
narcotics. Ideally, narcotics are reserved for short-term relief in individuals with
intractable pain, refractory to all other modalities. Following analgesia recommendations, attempts should be made to address pathologic changes in the mechanics of
knee. The available treatment options are bracing, physical therapy, and assistive
devices for ambulation. Other conservative modalities include intraarticular viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid analogues or derivatives (Synvisc®) and
corticosteroid injections.

APPROACH TO:
Osteoarthritis of the Knee
DEFINITIONS
ARTHROPLASTY: The surgical replacement and reconstruction of a functional
joint.
OSTEONECROSIS: The death of bone tissue secondary to impaired or disrupted
blood supply, often as the result of trauma or disease. Osteonecrosis is marked by
severe, localized pain and by structurally weakened bone that may flatten and collapse. This process is also known as aseptic or avascular necrosis (AVN).
POLYMETHYLMETHACRYLATE (PMMA): A synthetic polymer used commonly as cement for the implantation of knee and hip prostheses

CLINICAL APPROACH
Differential Diagnosis
As discussed, there are several causes of knee pain that must be considered before
the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is made. Like DJD, inflammatory arthropathies
such as gout, chronic septic arthritis, and rheumatologic processes may present
with insidious, atraumatic knee pain. Several conditions in this wide spectrum
of inflammatory diseases are discussed in greater depth elsewhere in this text. As a
general rule, however, if there is suspicion for underlying infectious, rheumatologic,
or crystalline process, further workup should be performed and includes obtaining
blood and synovial fluid samples. Although the specific laboratory tests to be ordered
are chosen on a case-by-case basis, general studies typically always obtained include
a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive
protein (CRP), and synovial fluid gram stain, crystal analysis, cell count and aerobic
and anaerobic cultures.
Avascular necrosis of the knee can also be a cause of this gentleman’s pain.
There are several etiologies of this condition. First, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the
knee, an idiopathic condition that commonly affects women older than 55 years,
is typically unilateral and affects only 1 condyle. The other causes include excessive alcohol use, sickle cell anemia, trauma, or corticosteroid use and usually affect
patients younger than 45 years. Both conditions may present with slow-onset knee
pain, sometimes worst at night, and typically affect the medial compartment. As
with DJD, these conditions may respond to arthroplasty when conservative treatments fail.
Finally, posttraumatic arthritis is an accelerated degenerative process of the knee
that results from previous damage to the knee’s articular surfaces. It is managed in
much the same way as DJD, with conservative measures first and arthroplasty for
end-stage disease.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

357

TREATMENT OF OSTEOARTHRITIS
Nonoperative (Conservative) Treatment
Despite the surgical focus of this text, it must be stressed that the initial management of DJD is almost always nonoperative. The conservative interventions
described previously are usually successful in attenuating patients’ DJD symptoms,
at least in the short term. How long, exactly, DJD can be managed nonoperatively
varies greatly between individuals. Several studies show significant short-term pain
relief and functional improvement using corticosteroid injections and viscosupplementation, but results, again, are unpredictable.
It is important to recognize that none of these aforementioned treatments are a
cure for DJD. Therefore, when discussing the natural history of osteoarthritis with
patients, it is important to explain that it will progress as long as they partake in
weightbearing activities. Because the lifespan of a prosthetic joint is finite—and
most prone to wear in younger, active individuals—arthroplasty interventions are
generally delayed until the patient can no longer tolerate conservative measures.

Operative Treatment
Once a patient has failed all conservative therapy, surgery may be indicated. There
are several surgical options available and include total knee arthroplasty, osteotomies, arthroscopic interventions, and unicompartmental arthroplasty.

Arthroscopy and Osteotomies
Arthroscopic interventions are reserved for young patients with mild, localized
disease in the setting of mechanical symptoms (ie, joint clicking, locking, or
instability). Arthroscopic treatments are guided at debridement, chondroplasty,
and removal of chondral loose bodies commonly found in osteoarthritic disease.
Arthroscopy also plays a diagnostic role in determining the severity of arthritic disease,
as some patients with advanced, debilitating arthritis may have deceptively benignappearing x-rays.
Another surgical option that does not involve prostheses are osteotomies, or
wedge-shaped bone cuts, that alter the alignment of the knee joint. When patients
present with disproportionately worn compartments, the alignment of the knee can
be altered to divert weightbearing pressures from the affected side. Ideal patients for
this procedure are younger than 50 years, with isolated unicompartmental disease
and a normal range of motion. They should also have competent ligaments, active
flexion beyond 90 degrees, and minimal evidence of a flexion contracture. A varus
or valgus osteotomy can be used to offload the lateral or medial compartments,
respectively. In general, varus-producing osteotomies are performed on the femur,
and valgus-producing osteotomies are performed on the tibia.

Arthroplasty
Before discussing total joint arthroplasty, it is worthy to mention the increasing popularity of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). This procedure is restricted
to patients with unicompartmental noninflammatory osteoarthritis, deformities of
less than 10 degrees (varus or valgus), and an intact anterior cruciate ligament.
Medial compartment replacement is by far the most commonly performed UKA, as
the prevalence of medial-sided arthritis far exceeds that of isolated lateral disease.

358

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

In the correct patient population, advantages of UKA over total joint replacement
include faster recovery, less rehabilitation, and smaller incisions.
The most commonly performed procedure for knee arthritis in the United States
is total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Typically, patients are older than 50 years, have
disease in all 3 compartments, and have experienced changes in their activity levels
secondary to pain. TKA involves a resurfacing procedure of the distal femur
and proximal tibia and typically the undersurface of the patella. The goals are to
reconstruct a stable knee with a functional range of motion, to restore knee alignment and smooth patella tracking, and to relieve pain. There are a great variety of
TKA prosthetic designs whose nuances extend beyond the scope of this discussion.
Most modern TKA systems, however, share these same goals, and indeed there is no
definitive evidence that supports the superiority of one modern TKA system over
another.

Complications
The common complications that are associated with TKA include infection, deep
vein thrombosis, aseptic loosening, osteolysis, periprosthetic fracture, failure of the
extensor mechanism, and postoperative stiffness or arthrofibrosis.
Infections in an artificial joint, although rare (< 1%), are one of the most devastating complications of TKA. Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) can present in a
multitude of ways. While some patients present with acute pain, swelling, and redness, others have a more insidious onset of symptoms. In general, any patient with
a TKA and new-onset pain should be evaluated for infection, amongst other causes
of pain. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies on physical exam findings, laboratory studies (ESR, CRP), and synovial fluid analysis. Although a positive gram stain
and/or cultures make the diagnosis easy, many times these tests are negative. When
this occurs, many believe that a synovial fluid white blood cell count of greater than
1100 cells/mL and a polymorphonuclear level of greater than 64% is consistent
with a PJI, regardless of gram stain and culture findings. The management of PJI
is challenging. In general, acute infections (defined as those of less than 3 weeks
duration) are treated with a surgical irrigation and debridement and polyethylene
exchange. Unfortunately, a PJI of greater than 3 weeks duration requires a complete
explantation of the total knee system, placement of an antibiotic-eluting spacer
where the total knee was, and 4 to 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. After this, a
replantation of the total knee may be performed.
Finally, patients undergoing total joint replacements are notoriously at risk for
deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVTs occur in up to 5% to 15% of patients undergoing arthroplasty and are considered the most common complication of TKA. Most
surgeons and hospitals go to considerable lengths to reduce DVT rates, including
frequent mobilization postoperatively, placement of sequential compression stockings and compression stockings, and the use of anticoagulation medications such as
postoperative heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin, aspirin, and several
other drugs. Unfortunately, despite significant efforts, the rates of DVT in arthroplasty patients remain relatively high.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
39.1 A 55-year-old construction worker presents to your office with complaints of
right knee pain, several years in duration. Examination of the right knee is
notable for a slight flexion contraction, painful range of motion (ROM), and
palpable crepitus during ROM. The left knee by comparison has a greater,
albeit limited ROM that is not painful. Standing radiographs show significant
medial and lateral compartmental joint space narrowing with sclerotic and
osteophytic changes in bilateral knees. He has not yet been treated for his
condition. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?
A. Right total knee arthroplasty
B. Right knee medial unicompartmental arthroplasty
C. Right knee lateral unicompartmental arthroplasty
D. NSAIDs and acetaminophen, recommend physical therapy
E. Bilateral knee total arthroplasties
39.2 A 52-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis is referred to
your clinic with right knee pain. For the past 3 years, her rheumatoid arthritis has been well controlled with a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug
(DMARD) regimen; however, she continues to have persistent knee pain.
On exam you note a comparatively varus right knee with a painful and limited ROM. She is ligamentously intact and is tender to palpation only on
the anteromedial aspect of her knee. Radiographs show significant narrowing
of the right knee medial compartment, with relative sparing of the patellofemoral and lateral compartments. There are sclerotic and cystic changes on
the medial aspect of her knee only. Having failed nonoperative interventions,
which of the following is the most appropriate surgical intervention for this
patient?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Right total knee arthroplasty
Right knee lateral unicompartmental arthroplasty
Right knee medial unicompartmental arthroplasty
Right knee corrective osteotomy

39.3 A 73-year-old woman is on postoperative day 3 for a total knee replacement.
The procedure was without complication, but as a result of postoperative
pain, she has been slow to mobilize. You are called to evaluate the patient
for increasing tachycardia (heart rate 115 beats/minute) and sudden-onset
tachypnea (respiratory rate 30 breaths/min). Blood pressure and temperature
are within normal limits. She has received a dose of intravenous morphine
30 minutes before your evaluation and currently states her pain is “only a
3/10.” Electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray are obtained and
demonstrate no acute changes or abnormalities. She is a smoker and has a
history of breast cancer. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Acute myocardial infarction
B. Pneumonia
C. Pulmonary embolism
D. Fat embolism
E. Blood loss anemia with secondary hypovolemia

ANSWERS
39.1 D. Nonoperative measures are almost always trialed before arthroplasty is performed for patients with DJD. Although this patient has radiographic degenerative changes, he is asymptomatic on the left, and thus bilateral TKA would
be contraindicated. The presence of bilateral compartment disease is a contraindication to unicompartmental arthroplasty should the patient fail conservative treatment.
39.2 A. Although this patient’s arthritis is confined to the medial space, the
presence of rheumatoid arthritis is a contraindication to unicompartmental
replacement. Corrective osteotomies may correct the patient’s varus alignment but do nothing to address the underlying joint pathology.
39.3 C. Pulmonary emboli (PE) are an unfortunate and not too uncommon complication of knee or hip arthroplasty. Most occur second to embolized DVTs,
which result from immobilizations, surgical trauma, insufficient postoperative
thrombus prophylaxis, and underlying risk factors, such as this patient’s history of tobacco use and malignancy. The next step should be a CT angiogram of the chest (the diagnostic gold standard) or a ventilation perfusion
scan. Although pneumonia and acute myocardial infarction may account for
her symptoms, they are less likely given the normal chest x-ray and cardiac
enzymes/electrocardiogram changes, respectively. Blood loss anemia with subsequent hypovolemic shock is also common; however, it is less likely given her
normal blood pressure. Fat embolism may occur in the setting of joint replacement procedures, but more often occurs intraoperatively or immediately postoperatively with placement of intramedullary components. Remember that
PEs rarely cause electrocardiogram changes and are not typically diagnosable
on regular chest x-rays.

CASE 40
A 65-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of
right “groin” pain that radiates to the buttock. She has noticed some mild pain in
her right hip for the past 2 years, but has had severe pain over the last 4 months.
She describes the pain as being “4/10” but at times can be an “8/10.” The quality
of the pain is a dull ache, and she denies any weakness, numbness, or tingling in
her leg below the knee; however, the pain recently has kept her from getting sleep
at night. She is currently using a cane for ambulation around her community and
has to rest every 4 to 5 blocks because of pain. She also notes difficulty putting on
her shoes and socks and getting in and out of the car. Her symptoms are refractory to ibuprofen and acetaminophen. She denies any recent trauma, infections, or
dental work. Vital signs are within normal limits. When she ambulates, she leans
her body to the right side during stance phase while maintaining a level pelvis.
When she is lying flat on her back, she is able to flex her right hip to 90 degrees
but has severe pain past this point. She has limited abduction of her right
hip compared with the left. She has 0 degrees of right hip internal rotation and
20 degrees of external rotation. When holding her left knee to her chest and
extending the right hip, the right posterior thigh does not fully lie on the exam
table. She has a negative straight leg raise bilaterally and is neurovascularly intact
in both lower extremities.

ANSWERS TO CASE 40:
Hip Osteoarthritis
Summary: A 65-year-old woman presents with a chief complaint of right “groin”
pain that radiates to the buttock. She is having difficulty performing activities of
daily living and sleeping, and her pain is not relieved by anti-inflammatory medications. She has not had a traumatic event or recent infections. On physical exam,
she has painful and limited range of motion of her hip, with a flexion contracture.
• Most likely diagnosis: Right hip osteoarthritis.
• Next diagnostic step: Anteroposterior (AP) pelvis radiograph and AP and lateral radiographs of the right hip (Figures 40–1 and 40–2).
• Nonoperative treatment options: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), physical therapy (eg, stretching and range-of-motion exercises,
modalities, pool therapy), and corticosteroid injections.
• Surgical treatment option(s): Total hip replacement.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the etiologies of arthritis.
2. Be familiar with the treatment options for hip arthritis.
3. Understand the indications for total hip arthroplasty.

Considerations
This 65-year-old patient presents with “groin” pain, which is the typical location
of pain that is coming from the hip joint. Patients often complain additionally of
radiating pain to the buttock, lateral thigh, or knee. Sometimes patients who have
hip arthritis will actually present with “knee pain.” This is called referred pain and is
thought to be caused by irritation of the obturator nerve or, less commonly, the femoral nerve. “Hip pain” can also be due to problems in the spine and pelvis. On physical exam, pain with resisted straight leg raise and resisted hip flexion and groin
pain with hip flexion and internal rotation are more commonly seen in hip disease
and less commonly with low back disease. This patient also had limitations in hip
range of motion, which is common with end-stage osteoarthritis. Although pain in
the hip can radiate down to the knee, lumbar spine disease (eg, sciatica) will often
radiate below the knee and into the foot. If the diagnosis is unclear or if the patient
has both hip and lumbar spine pathology, a diagnostic injection of anesthetic and
corticosteroids into the hip joint can be performed to determine whether the pain is
coming primarily from the hip. If the pain is alleviated with the injection, the pain is
likely coming from the hip. It is important to obtain a quality AP pelvis radiograph
as well as AP and lateral radiographs of the affected hip when there is concern for
arthritis (Figures 40–1 and 40–2). If the patient complains of radiating pain, AP and
lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine and/or weightbearing AP/lateral/Merchant
x-rays of the knee may be required.

APPROACH TO:
Hip Osteoarthritis
DEFINITIONS
OSTEOARTHRITIS: Progressive, degenerative disorder of the joints caused by a
gradual loss of cartilage and bone resulting in pain, stiffness, and bony overgrowth
REFERRED PAIN: Pain perceived in a body location other than the location of
pathology

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of end-stage arthritis in the community;
other types of arthritis include juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
posttraumatic arthritis, inflammatory arthritis (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), secondary arthritis from avascular necrosis, and septic arthritis. It is important to determine the etiology of the underlying arthritis, as this may affect surgical
decision making and postoperative management. Radiographs are often helpful in
determining the etiology of arthritis. Osteoarthritis will show evidence of asymmetric joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, and
subchondral cysts, whereas rheumatoid arthritis will demonstrate symmetric joint
space narrowing, bony erosions, and osteopenia. Osteoarthritis of the hip may also
occur secondary to previous traumatic injuries, developmental dysplasia of the hip,
osteonecrosis of the hip, and femoroacetabular impingement.

Clinical Presentation
The majority of patients who present with hip pain will not require surgery. As
with any painful condition, when taking a patient’s history, it is important to ask
(1) location of the pain, (2) whether or not the pain radiates to another location,
(3) alleviating or aggravating factors, (4) what the patient has tried to alleviate
the pain, (5) quality of the pain, (6) quantity of the pain, (7) duration of the pain,
(8) when the pain occurs, and (9) associated symptoms, including numbness, weakness, fevers, weight loss, involvement of other joints, and so forth.
As discussed, patients with arthritis (particularly osteoarthritis) present with
groin pain that can radiate to the buttock, lateral proximal femur, thigh, or knee.
Patients often describe the pain as a constant, dull ache that worsens with physical
activity and is relieved, at least partially, with rest. Patients often tolerate the pain,
taking anti-inflammatories or acetaminophen for many years. Often, what compels
patients to finally seek treatment is restricted motion that prevents them from
performing activities of daily living, including dressing and driving, or pain that
interferes with their ability to sleep.
On physical exam, they often have relatively normal vital signs (unless they have
an underlying medical condition) and ambulate with a coxalgic gait. A coxalgic
gait is when the patient lurches his or her torso to the affected side but keeps
the pelvis level. This is different from a Trendelenburg gait (a sign of hip abductor

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

367

weakness), in which the patient leans his or her torso to the affected side but the
pelvis is not level and is different from the antalgic gait seen with knee pathology, in
which the patient limits the amount of time he or she weight bears on the affected
knee during stance phase. As a result of loss of cartilage or bone, patients may have
a limb length discrepancy, which may also cause an abnormal gait. With the patient
supine, patients often have painful, restricted range of motion. A Thomas test,
in which the patient holds his or her unaffected knee to the chest and attempts to
extend the affected hip, can help the clinician to determine whether the patient
also has a hip flexion contracture. Patients with hip pathology also have pain with
resisted hip flexion and resisted straight leg raise. Radiographic evaluation of a
painful hip includes a quality AP pelvis radiograph (Figure 40–1) and an AP and
lateral radiograph (Figure 40–2) of the affected hip. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is rarely required to make the diagnosis of arthritis, but may be beneficial in
eliminating other causes of hip pain or to diagnose early cartilage loss.

TREATMENT
Total hip arthroplasty is one of the most successful procedures in medicine. Indications for total hip replacement in general terms are debilitating, end-stage arthritis
of the hip that limits activities of daily living. Orthopaedic surgeons generally evaluate pain, success (or lack of success) of nonoperative interventions, baseline function, mobility, and radiographic evidence of joint space damage in their decision to
recommend surgery. In addition, patients must have failed nonoperative treatment
interventions, including physical therapy (eg, stretching and range-of-motion exercises, modalities, pool therapy), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and intraarticular
corticosteroid injections.
A variety of implants and bearing surfaces are currently available. The most
common current bearing options include metal on metal, metal on polyethylene,
ceramic on ceramic, ceramic on-polyethylene, and Oxinium on polyethylene. With
each of the previously mentioned types of bearings, the femoral head is former and
the acetabular liner is latter. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type
of bearing surface. In older adults, the most commonly used bearing surface is metal
on polyethylene. In addition, both the acetabular and femoral components can be
cementless or cemented, depending on the patient’s age and bone quality and surgeon preference.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
40.1 A 58-year-old golfer presents to your office with complaints of progressive right
groin pain, 2 years in duration. Lately he has been having difficulty walking
between holes on the golf course. On examination, he is overweight, exhibits
an antalgic gait, and has markedly limited range of hip motion. Which of the
following choices will provide the most information to the orthopaedic surgeon regarding the presence of degenerative joint disease?
A. AP pelvis plain x-ray
B. CT scan of the pelvis
C. AP pelvis, AP, and lateral plain radiographs of the affected hip
D. AP and lateral comparison plain x-rays of the unaffected hip
E. MRI of the pelvis
40.2 A 68-year-old male active tennis player presents to your practice with a 4-year
history of left groin pain. His pain has been worsening over the last year, and
he is now unable to participate in the local singles league. He has moderate
relief with NSAIDs and acetaminophen in the past, but states these are no
longer fully effective. An orthopaedic spine surgeon has evaluated him in the
recent past for degenerative disc disease but only treated him with NSAIDs
and prednisone for what he recalls as a “slipped disc.” On exam, the patient
has a limited range of hip motion and pain with internal rotation. Straight leg
raise above 70 degrees causes pain to radiate down his leg. X-rays show mild
degenerative changes in his bilateral hips. What is the next best step in management of this patient?
A. Left total hip arthroplasty
B.
C.
D.
E.

Left hip hemiarthroplasty
Immediate referral back to his spine surgeon for further workup
Intraarticular corticosteroid injection
Continue NSAIDs and acetaminophen, recommend physical therapy,
and add a low-dose narcotic for daily pains

40.3 A 63-year-old obese woman is referred to your office for evaluation for arthritis,
diagnosed on x-rays ordered by her primary care physician. The patient complains that she gets left hip pain when power-walking with her dog. She states
she has an aunt who had relief of chronic pain from a hip replacement last
year and wants you to perform the same “miracle operation.” A careful history,
physical exam, and appropriate imaging confirm the diagnosis of left hip osteoarthritis. Which of the following is not an appropriate first-line treatment?
A. Activity modification
B. Weight loss
C. Physical therapy for quadriceps strengthening
D. Intraarticular steroid injection
E. Total hip arthroplasty

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

369

ANSWERS
40.1 C. AP pelvis, AP hip, and frog-leg lateral radiographs are the standard films to
obtain of the hip when evaluating a patient for degenerative joint disease. CT
scans and MRI are typically unnecessary in the setting of osteoarthritis.
40.2 D. It is unclear by this question whether his symptoms are from osteoarthritis or spinal pathology. In these situations, intraarticular corticosteroid
injections may play a diagnostic role in addition to being therapeutic. The
simultaneous injection of lidocaine or similar local anesthetics should provide
near-immediate relief of symptoms if his pain is arthritic in nature. Although
referral and/or consultation with a spine surgeon is appropriate, this patient
may well have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip and should not be simply
sent to see someone else. Although NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and physical
therapy play an important role in his therapy, they do not necessarily provide
the diagnostic evidence needed to determine the source of his pain; secondary,
chronic narcotics should almost never be used in the treatment of degenerative joint disease. Of course, total hip arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty should
not be performed until the surgeon is certain of the underlying diagnosis and
has exhausted nonoperative treatments when effective.
40.3 E. Activity modification, physical therapy (especially that directed at quadriceps strengthening), weight loss, and intraarticular steroids are all first-line
nonoperative treatments for osteoarthritis. Total hip arthroplasty is reserved for
patients who have failed conservative measures and whose arthritis is adversely
affecting their ability to accomplish activities of daily living.

The most common cause of end-stage hip arthritis in the United States
is osteoarthritis.



Most patients with intraarticular hip pathology present with groin pain
that may or may not radiate to other locations around the hip joint or the
knee.



If it is unclear whether or not a patient is having hip, back, or pelvis pain,
a diagnostic intraarticular injection of anesthetic and corticosteroids may
help elicit the source of the underlying pain.



Standard radiographic imaging of patient with hip arthritis includes an
AP pelvis radiograph and an AP and lateral radiograph of the affected hip.



First-line therapies for degenerative disease of the hip are almost always
nonoperative in nature. They include interventions such as physical
therapy (eg, stretching and range-of-motion exercises, modalities, pool
therapy), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and intraarticular corticosteroid injections.

CASE 41
A 63-year-old left-hand dominant man presents to your office with complaints of
progressive left shoulder pain. He reports a remote history of blunt trauma to the
shoulder, sustained after a fall from a ladder. After that fall, the patient returned
to his job at the post office despite mild residual discomfort with activity. Recently
the pain has been more persistent, and he is having difficulty handling parcels at
work. He reports loss of sleep due to night pain and has had no relief with steroid
injection provided by his primary care physician. On examination, the patient is
overweight, with symmetrical appearance of the shoulder musculature. He can
raise his left arm to the level of his shoulder in forward elevation and can abduct
60 degrees. He has external rotation of the shoulder to approximately 10 degrees
and can internally rotate to reach his low lumbar region. His left arm strength at
the extremes of motion is only mildly diminished relative to his right, but his left
arm range of motion is markedly restricted. There is palpable crepitus overlying
the shoulder. He is neurovascularly intact. X-rays are obtained of the left shoulder demonstrating significant glenohumeral joint space narrowing with mild flattening of the humeral head. Osteophytes are present on the glenoid rim and on
the inferior articular surface of the humerus. The anteroposterior view shows the
humeral head to be concentrically aligned with the glenoid without evidence of
proximal migration.

ANSWERS TO CASE 41:
Shoulder Arthroplasty
Summary: A 63-year-old left-hand dominant man presents with posttraumatic
degenerative changes of the left shoulder and significant disability. Examination
demonstrates intact rotator cuff function. X-rays of the left shoulder demonstrate
significant glenohumeral joint space narrowing with mild flattening of the humeral
head. Osteophytes are present on the glenoid rim and on the inferior articular
surface of the humerus. The anteroposterior view shows the humeral head to be
concentrically aligned within the glenoid without evidence of proximal migration.
• Most likely diagnosis: Posttraumatic arthritis of the glenohumeral joint.
• Interventions: Nonoperative interventions include steroid injections, physical
therapy, and pharmacologic agents (anti-inflammatories, analgesics). Operative
interventions include hemiarthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty, or reverse
total shoulder arthroplasty.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the relevant anatomy of the shoulder musculature, bony anatomy,
and related biomechanics.
2. Identify the key features of radiographic evaluation of the shoulder anatomy.
3. Understand the surgical options for treating advanced degenerative joint disease
of the shoulder and the clinical considerations that guide treatment decisions.

Considerations
This is a 63-year-old left-hand dominant man who presents with degenerative
changes of the left shoulder. Clinical findings must be considered in the context of
the patient’s overall functional demands on the shoulder, his overall health status,
and his degree of symptoms. On exam, irreparable or chronic rotator cuff deficiency
necessitates reverse-total shoulder arthroplasty to enable elevation or abduction of
the arm. For low-demand patients lacking rotator cuff function, hemiarthroplasty
(replacement of the humeral head) may relieve pain but is unlikely to increase functional range of motion. With rotator cuff function intact, as it is in this patient,
either standard total or hemiarthroplasty is possible, depending on the degree of glenoid arthritis. Significant glenoid involvement necessitates additional resurfacing,
and total shoulder arthroplasty may be performed provided that there is sufficient
glenoid bone remaining to support the implant.

APPROACH TO:
Shoulder Arthroplasty
DEFINITIONS
SHOULDER HEMIARTHROPLASTY: Prosthetic replacement of the humeral
head.
TOTAL SHOULDER ARTHROPLASTY: Prosthetic replacement of the
humeral head in combination with prosthetic resurfacing of the glenoid.
REVERSE TOTAL SHOULDER ARTHROPLASTY: Prosthetic resurfacing of
both the glenoid and humeral articular surfaces with reversed placement of the ball
and socket components. The hemispherical ball component is fixed to the glenoid,
and the humeral head is replaced with a cup prosthesis.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Shoulder Anatomy and Normal Glenohumeral Biomechanics
The shoulder joint is comprised of the glenohumeral articulation and the surrounding soft-tissue envelope including the joint capsule, associated ligamentous
structures, and the rotator cuff musculature. The glenohumeral joint functions as
a ball-and-socket joint and enables significant mobility but is inherently unstable
due to the relatively small size of the glenoid and minimal congruence afforded by
its shallow concavity (Figure 41–1). Muscles acting across the joint to move the
extremity create force vectors that tend to displace the glenohumeral articulation.
To prevent dislocation, the joint is stabilized by both static and dynamic forces that
counteract the displacing forces to permit coordinated motion of the joint.
Static stabilizers include the glenoid labrum, the joint capsule, the glenohumeral
ligaments, negative intraarticular pressure or adhesive fluid properties, and the glenoid concavity and joint version. Degenerative process and traumatic injury to these
structures can result in significant and disabling functional pain, joint laxity, or gross
instability. The glenoid labrum is a fibrocartilaginous ring around the periphery of
the glenoid that doubles the depth of the concavity. Similarly, integrity of the joint
capsule and its associated ligamentous structures provide additional constraints to
joint displacement at varying positions of the arm. Adhesive fluid properties and
negative intracapsular pressure resist joint dislocation or distension. Alterations
in synovial fluid production or quality can affect the physiology of articular tissues
and is related to several pathologic processes. Degenerative wear or trauma to the
bony anatomy of the glenohumeral joint surfaces can result in chronic pain and joint
instability due to an insufficient or distorted glenoid surface or distorted and asymmetric humeral head.
Dynamic stabilizers of the shoulder include periscapular muscles, the biceps tendon, and the rotator cuff musculature. Periscapular muscles function to reposition
the glenohumeral joint in a mechanically advantageous orientation by coordinating
scapulothoracic and glenohumeral motion. Thus, normal kinematics of the shoulder
requires normal neuromuscular function in addition to unimpaired motion at

the scapulothoracic, glenohumeral, acromioclavicular, and sternoclavicular joints.
Dysfunction of these structures impairs coordinated motion, results in compromised
biomechanical function at the glenohumeral joint, and predisposes to traumatic injury and accelerated degenerative wear. The function of the long head of the biceps
tendon in shoulder stabilization is controversial. Although some studies have shown
increased joint laxity in the absence of an intact biceps tendon, functional evaluations have not demonstrated significant clinical differences. In contrast, the muscles
of the rotator cuff are the primary stabilizers of the glenohumeral articulation during
arm motion. The principal function of the rotator cuff is to compress the humeral
head against the glenoid and resist shear forces generated by the pull of muscles acting across the joint (eg, the deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, teres major,
and biceps brachii). In particular, deltoid contraction during arm elevation tends
to pull the humeral head proximally, and the rotator cuff is required to depress the
head and permit the glenohumeral articulation to act as a fulcrum for arm elevation
during deltoid contraction (Figure 41–2).

Rotator Cuff Muscle Function and Testing
The rotator cuff muscles all originate from the scapula and insert along the margin
of the humeral head articular surface on the greater and lesser tuberosities. The subscapularis muscle originates from the entire anterior surface of the scapular body,
and its tendon passes anterior to the humeral head to insert on the lesser tuberosity.

Figure 41–2. Coronal section of the shoulder illustrating the relationships of the glenohumeral joint,
the joint capsule, the subacromial bursa, and the rotator cuff (supraspinatus tendon).

The subscapularis contributes to joint stability by helping to prevent anterior dislocation of the shoulder joint, and contraction results in internal rotation of the arm.
The supraspinatus and infraspinatus originate from the posterior scapular body
above and below the scapular spine, respectively. Their tendons become confluent
at their insertion on the superolateral aspect of the humeral head. They prevent
proximal humeral head migration during deltoid-mediated arm elevation and are
essential for any arm flexion or abduction. The teres minor muscle originates from
the lateral border of the scapular body and passes posterior to the humeral head
to insert on the posterior aspect of the greater tuberosity. The teres minor creates
an external rotation force on the arm. Rotator cuff testing is achieved by assessing
the isolated functional integrity of the four rotator cuff muscles on physical exam.
Deficiencies noted on exam suggestive of surgically correctable tears are generally
confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For patients requiring shoulder
arthroplasty for painful arthritis or irreparable fracture of the humeral head, the
integrity of the rotator cuff and the patient’s functional status determine the
appropriate procedure.

Radiographic Evaluation
Radiographic imaging should proceed stepwise. Initial imaging for painful shoulder
conditions should be initiated with plain radiographs. Anteroposterior (AP) imaging will demonstrate joint space, articular surface degeneration, any proximal head
migration suggestive of a large tear or significant attenuation of the superior rotator
cuff, and superior or inferior osteophytes. Lateral (scapular Y) images permit careful
inspection of the anatomy of the acromion. This is useful when rotator cuff impingement is a concern based on history or exam. An axillary view will show glenoid

376

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

version (orientation), glenoid bone loss, and anterior or posterior osteophytes.
Computed tomography (CT) scans provide the most detail about bony anatomy
and can be invaluable in preoperative planning for arthroplasty. MRI is used when
the integrity of the rotator cuff is uncertain or additional soft-tissue pathology is
being investigated.

TREATMENT
Nonoperative Treatment
Nonoperative therapy for glenohumeral arthritis includes activity modification,
physical therapy, steroid injection, and analgesics.

Total Shoulder Arthroplasty
Total shoulder arthroplasty is indicated for symptomatic degenerative shoulder conditions in patients with an intact rotator cuff. Because the glenohumeral
articulation is relatively unconstrained, significant sheer forces are created at the
joint when muscles acting across the joint are used. In the absence of the dynamic
and coordinated counterforce generated by rotator cuff function, these shear forces
would result in malposition of the humeral head during arm motion, eccentric forces
across the prosthetic articulation, and eventual glenoid component loosening. For
this reason, total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is contraindicated in the setting of
irreparable rotator cuff deficiency. TSA is also contraindicated in the setting of
significant glenoid erosion or irreparable glenoid bone loss from trauma or arthritis
because of the technical requirements involved in glenoid prosthetic resurfacing
and implant fixation. The benefits of TSA also require that the patient have intact
brachial plexus and deltoid muscle function.

Shoulder Hemiarthroplasty
Shoulder hemiarthroplasty is appropriate when there is symptomatic shoulder
arthritis without significant glenoid involvement. This can occur after traumatic injury
to the humeral head (eg, with dislocation), avascular necrosis (eg, with sickle cell
disease or steroid use), or primary osteoarthritis. Similarly, hemiarthroplasty can be
used as the initial procedure to address comminuted multipart fractures of the proximal humerus that are unlikely to have a good outcome with primary fracture repair.
With mild degenerative changes of the glenoid, gentle recontouring of the articular surface can sometimes permit arthroplasty without requiring glenoid prosthetic
resurfacing. Hemiarthroplasty is also appropriate for select patients with chronic
rotator cuff deficiency who have very low functional demands and painful shoulder
arthritis. In these patients, humeral head replacement and excision of osteophytes
can provide significant symptom improvement, although objective shoulder function may be adversely impacted due to the muscular deficiencies.

Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty
Low-demand patients with painful arthritis who lack rotator cuff function
can benefit from reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. The absence of rotator cuff function results in pseudoparalysis of the arm. When attempting to raise

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

377

the arm, the deltoid contraction causes the entire humerus to slide proximally
because the rotator cuff cannot maintain the humeral head position in the glenoid.
The result is that the arm slides up and down the body, but remains at the side.
Reversing the ball and socket configuration of the implants so the cup is on the
humerus and the ball is on the scapula changes (ie, medializes) the center of rotation of the shoulder joint and provides a fulcrum for the arm to pivot on. This
allows the deltoid to raise the arm despite the absence of rotator cuff function.
Reverse shoulder arthroplasty can restore function but has significant limitations
and is considered a salvage procedure for patients older than 70 years with intact deltoid function but irreparable rotator cuff tears and limited preexisting shoulder function. The complication rate is increased relative to standard shoulder arthroplasty.

Technical Considerations
An AP radiograph will generally reveal degenerative arthritis (including osteophytes
or joint space narrowing from cartilage thinning) and can demonstrate proximal
humeral head migration, indicating rotator cuff deficiency. An axillary view will
demonstrate any posterior glenoid erosion, which is the most common bony
glenoid deficiency with osteoarthritis of the shoulder. CT scans provide excellent
anatomic detail and can allow precise determination of bony erosion and glenoid
version (or mechanical orientation). MRI is helpful in determining rotator cuff
anatomy, acuity of injury, and degree of muscular atrophy.
The deltopectoral approach for shoulder arthroplasty takes advantage of an
internervous plane between the axillary nerve (supplying the deltoid muscle) and the
medial and lateral pectoral nerves (supplying the pectoral muscles). The subscapularis tendon is the only musculotendinous structure that has to be cut before opening
the joint capsule anteriorly, and it must be carefully repaired at the end of the case to
allow for internal rotation and to keep the humeral head from dislocating anteriorly.
Component size and position must be carefully evaluated to ensure effective
muscle function at the shoulder, maintain biomechanical joint stability, and avoid
painful motion. Component version (ie, axial rotational orientation) must be determined with consideration given to preoperative anatomy and assessed intraoperatively in relation to the distal extremity.

Rehabilitation
Early postoperative rehabilitation is limited by the subscapularis tendon repair and
healing. Patients are initially maintained in a shoulder immobilizer to support the
arm and maintain a position of internal rotation. External rotation is avoided to
prevent damage to the subscapularis tendon repair. Therapy is initiated with passive
range of motion exercises (eg, shoulder pendulums) that progress to active assisted
and active stretching before starting a strengthening regimen.

Complications
Complications include component loosening, failure of the subscapularis tendon
repair, component malposition, postoperative stiffness, dysfunction or instability due
to improper soft-tissue balancing, periprosthetic fracture, heterotopic ossification,
or infection.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

379

ANSWERS
41.1 D. The patient is elderly but lives independently and would likely suffer significant disability and decreased quality of life without intervention. No mention
is made of medical comorbidities that would contraindicate surgical consideration. She has a long-standing history of rotator cuff deficiency that would
be irreparable because of its chronicity and consequent muscular atrophy and
tendon retraction. The lack of a functional rotator cuff is a contraindication
to total shoulder arthroplasty. The patient could benefit from a reverse total
shoulder arthroplasty to address both the irreparable proximal humerus fracture and the rotator cuff deficiency. A shoulder hemiarthroplasty would also
be appropriate, as it would address her fracture and permit an approximate
return to baseline function, but it would not improve her ability to elevate her
arm like a reverse arthroplasty would.
41.2 B. The deltopectoral approach to the shoulder requires that the subscapularis
be divided near its tendinous insertion onto the proximal humerus to expose
the anterior joint capsule before arthrotomy and to enable wide exposure for
arthroplasty. At the end of the procedure, the subscapularis must be repaired
to permit active internal rotation and to prevent anterior dislocation of the
humeral head. Postoperatively, patients are immobilized with their arm internally rotated to prevent tension from being applied to the subscapularis repair
by active or passive forces. Postoperative anterior shoulder dislocations can
occur in conjunction with rupture of the subscapularis repair from trauma or
failure of the repair.
41.3 C. This patient has degenerative joint disease of the shoulder with osteoarthritic changes involving both the humeral head and the glenoid. There is no
evidence of rotator cup arthropathy, given his good active range of motion
and the reduced humeral head on x-ray. Therefore, the surgical choices come
down to hemi- versus total arthroplasty. Because there are long-standing
degenerative changes to the glenoid in addition to the humeral head, this
patient would more likely benefit from a total shoulder arthroplasty.



Understand the function of the rotator cuff in normal glenohumeral biomechanics as a dynamic counter to shear forces that act to destabilize the
joint, and recognize the particular importance it plays in depressing the
humeral head to permit deltoid-mediated overhead motion.



Reverse total shoulders are only appropriate in low-demand patients with
disability resulting from glenohumeral arthritis in the setting of rotator
cuff deficiency.



Hemiarthroplasty is appropriate for symptomatic humeral head arthritis
or irreparable proximal humeral head fractures, but will not address rotator cuff insufficiency.

CASE 42
A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity
presents complaining of a painful right elbow, which awoke him from sleep the
morning of his presentation. He denies any recent trauma. The pain is localized to
the right elbow, which he notes is warm and extremely tender to even the lightest
touch. The pain is much worse when he moves his arm at the elbow. He had no
relief with acetaminophen. He has not had fevers, and he does not have pain in
any other joints. He reports that he has had similar episodes of joint pain in the
past affecting his left first toe and right ankle; he hasn’t had an episode in more
than a year, however. He recently started taking a daily baby aspirin and routinely
takes hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin. The patient is obese and claims to be
a social drinker, typically consuming 5 to 7 glasses of red wine per week. On exam,
he is afebrile, with vital signs within normal limits except for some mild hypertension. His right elbow is swollen, erythematous, warm, and exquisitely tender to
palpation, with a decreased range of motion secondary to pain. An effusion is
appreciable in the elbow. The remainder of the joint exam is unremarkable, and
there is no erythema extending beyond the elbow. No tophi are identified. Arthrocentesis of the right elbow is performed, and 5 mL of cloudy-yellow aspirate is
obtained. The sample is positive for negatively birefringent monosodium urate
crystals. No organisms are identified on a Gram stain, and the fluid is sent for
culture. The patient’s serum uric acid level is 8 mg/dL, and his renal function is
normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 42:
Gout
Summary: A 55-year-old man with a history notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and likely acute intermittent gout presents with acute monoarticular
arthritis of the right elbow. He takes a daily baby aspirin and is on hydrochlorothiazide. The exam is remarkable for an afebrile obese male with a tender, warm, and
swollen right elbow with decreased range of motion and no tophi. His labs are
remarkable for monosodium urate crystals (MSU) seen on microscopy and an
elevated serum uric acid level. His normal renal function will be important when
considering treatment options.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute gout flare.
• Diagnosis to exclude: Septic arthritis.
• Acute treatment: Several treatment options are available and include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or oral prednisone. Colchicine is
an alternative agent. Intraarticular steroid injections are also an option.
• Long-term management: Allopurinol, a type of xanthine-oxidase inhibitor, is
helpful in the prophylaxis of future gout flares.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the basic differential diagnosis of an acute monoarticular inflammatory
arthritis.
2. Know the workup of acute monoarticular inflammatory arthritis.
3. Understand the natural history of gout.
4. Be familiar with medications used in the acute management of gout flares.
5. Be familiar with the chronic management of gout.

Considerations
Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in men older than 40 years. Like
most individuals who suffer from gout, this patient is a middle-aged man (age and
sex being nonmodifiable risk factors) with comorbidities that included obesity,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (all modifiable risk factors). He presented with
the acute onset of a monoarticular arthritis. He was found to have an elevated uric
acid level, which is the strongest risk factor for gout, but it is not always present
in the setting of an acute flare. Normal levels may vary by age and laboratory, but
levels greater than 6.8 mg/dL are associated with decreased systemic solubility of
uric acid and thus increased risk of gout. Medications such as thiazide diuretics,
including hydrochlorothiazide, and low-dose aspirin (eg, baby aspirin) have also been

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

383

associated with gout. The patient described prior episodes of arthritis that were most
likely gout flares, including a classic presentation with podagra, or gout of the first
metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint.

APPROACH TO:
Gout
DEFINITIONS
PODAGRA: Gout affecting the first MTP joint.
MONOSODIUM URATE CRYSTALS: Seen in synovial fluid of joints affected
by gout.
CALCIUM PYROPHOSPHATE DEHYDRATE CRYSTALS: Found in synovial fluid of joints affected by pseudogout.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Differential Diagnosis
Crystal-induced arthritis can be due to MSU crystals, as in gout, or calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystals, as in pseudogout. The 2 are distinguished using polarized microscopy, which reveals negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals in
gout and positively birefringent crystals in pseudogout. The crystals in pseudogout
may be a number of different shapes. Septic arthritis may also present as acute monoarticular arthritis and must be excluded with Gram stain and culture of the synovial
fluid. Other causes of acute monoarticular arthritis include inflammatory conditions
(eg, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis), infections (eg, Lyme disease), osteoarthritis,
sickle cell disease, and traumatic injury.

Risk Factors
There are a number of risk factors for gout other than hyperuricemia; they include
purine-rich diets or those incorporating large quantities of alcohol (especially wine
and beer), physical inactivity, being postmenopausal, renal impairment, treatment
with diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide), obesity, and family history (particularly in
young men or premenopausal women). Hospitalization itself is a risk factor for gout
flares. Notably, gout and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share many risk factors, and
hyperuricemia has been shown to be an independent risk factor for CVD either via
direct effect of uric acid or indirectly through associated systemic inflammation.

Workup of Crystal-Induced Arthropathy
Although the history and physical exam can be helpful, the gold standard for
diagnosis of crystal-induced arthropathy is arthrocentesis with crystal analysis.
Clinical practice varies, however, and some physicians are comfortable enough with
a typical story (eg, podagra, an elevated uric acid level, and response to treatment)
to confidently treat gout without crystal analysis. The absence of crystals on synovial

384

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

fluid analysis rules out crystal-induced arthropathy; as a corollary, the presence of
crystals makes the diagnosis of crystal-induced arthropathy likely but does not rule
out other conditions, specifically septic arthritis. Notably, in-between episodes of
gout flares, arthrocentesis of previously affected joints in individuals not on uric
acid-lowering medications will demonstrate crystals and a mild inflammatory
aspirate. A Gram stain and culture of synovial fluid are necessary to rule out septic
arthritis; be aware that a negative Gram stain does not rule out a septic joint per se,
so one is often left to rely on clinical suspicion. Synovial fluid cell counts in crystalinduced arthropathy are typically between 30,000 and 50,000 cells/lL but may
be greater. In pseudogout, plain films of the affected joint may demonstrate chondrocalcinosis, or mineralization of the articular cartilage, visible on plain x-rays. In
severe gout, plain films may show “punched out” lesions, or lytic lucencies near the
articular surfaces, as well as overgrowth of the adjacent periosteal membranes.

Natural History of Gout
Humans suffer from gout because we lack the enzyme uricase and either overproduce
or under-excrete uric acid (90% of patients with gout). The progression of gout is
stratified into 3 phases. The first involves asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Of note, not
all patients with hyperuricemia will develop gout. The second phase encompasses
the acute, intermittent gout flare. It is characterized by involvement of a single
joint, which may be different with subsequent flares. Symptoms typically last for
7 to 10 days. The third stage is chronic tophaceous gout, in which patients have
persistent symptoms worsened by acute episodes of often polyarticular arthritis, as
well as crystal deposition (tophi) in joints and soft tissue (eg, the ear lobes). A discussion of secondary gout is beyond the scope of this chapter but may be seen in
conditions such as myeloproliferative disease, in which high cell turnover leads to
hyperuricemia.

Acute and Chronic Medical Management of Gout
Basic dietary strategies (ie, avoiding beer and meats) can reduce uric acid levels,
but not enough to prevent recurrent gout attacks. Thus, patients typically require
medical therapy once the acute episode has resolved, which will lower serum uric
acid levels. The patient, such as the one described here, likely has acute intermittent
gout and is currently suffering from an acute gout flare. Now is not the appropriate
time to initiate uric acid–lowering medications, as this can worsen precipitation of
gout crystals. There are many options for treatment of gout flares, and the choice of
one over the other is often dictated by the patient’s comorbidities (ie, renal failure),
especially in the hospitalized patient. The goal of treatment in the acute setting is
to control pain and reduce disability. The sooner that treatment is initiated, the
faster the resolution of symptoms occurs.
A randomized clinical trial performed in the outpatient setting demonstrated the
equivalence of oral corticosteroid and the NSAID naproxen for the treatment of an
acute gout flare in terms of pain management. No NSAID has been demonstrated
to be more effective than any other; their use is limited by gastrointestinal and renal
toxicity and should be avoided in patients with a history of myocardial infarction,
heart failure, or renal disease. Oral prednisone (or other oral corticosteroids) may

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

385

be administered with a starting dose of 40 to 60 mg/day for several days followed
by a 10- to 14-day taper or, alternatively, several days of 40 to 60 mg/day without
a taper. Oral corticosteroids may lead to or worsen preexisting hyperglycemia and
may affect mood and appetite; chronic steroid therapy has more severe side effects.
Intraarticular corticosteroid injection of a large joint affected by gout is also reasonable if there is no suggestion of a septic joint. Adrenocorticotropic hormone
may be administered parenterally and is also effective, although it is less commonly
used than other treatment options. Colchicine is typically used when prednisone
and/or NSAIDs cannot be administered. Colchicine possesses a narrow therapeutic
window, and side effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. When used appropriately, it can be very effective, although it often has a slower onset to action than
NSAIDs or steroids. Debate exists over the optimal dosing regimen for colchicine in
the treatment of acute flares. Colchicine should be avoided in patients with renal
or hepatic disease. The use of intravenous colchicine is rare. For patients in whom
none of these medicines can be administered safely, immobilization and pain management with opioids and ice are often the only options until the flare resolves on
its own (typically approximately 7 days).
Several weeks after the patient’s acute episode has resolved, it is reasonable to
initiate a uric acid–lowering agent (goal uric acid < 6 mg/dL), as is typically done
in patients with a history of gout flares or tophi (clinically or radiographically) and
hyperuricemia. Using uric acid–lowering agents will help prevent the transition in
this patient from acute intermittent gout to chronic tophaceous gout and reduce the
incidence of flares. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to reduce uric
acid levels. It must be dose-adjusted in renal impairment and has been associated
with potentially fatal hypersensitivity reactions. For those who fail allopurinol or
experience a hypersensitivity reaction, febuxostat is available; it is also a xanthine
oxidase inhibitor. Probenecid is a uricosuric agent that inhibits renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid; it is also used as a uric acid–lowering agent. Pegloticase is an
expensive recombinant form of uricase administered via infusion and carries a risk of
infusion reaction. It is important to use either colchicine or NSAIDs as prophylaxis
against acute gout flares during the first 6 months of uric acid–lowering therapy. If
uric acid–lowering agents cannot be used, daily colchicine may be used for indefinite
prophylaxis.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
42.1 A 55-year-old man has had 2 gout attacks in the last year, most recently about
6 weeks ago. His serum uric acid level at today’s visit is 9.3 mg/dL. He has been
on daily colchicine prophylaxis since his last gout attack. He drinks socially,
enjoying a “gin and tonic” once or twice a week. His body mass index is 24 kg/m2,
and he has no currently painful joints on examination. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
A. Advise him to reduce the amount of alcohol he drinks.
B. Advise him to lose weight.
C. Advise him to discontinue colchicine and begin allopurinol.
D. Advise him to continue colchicine and begin allopurinol.
E. Advise him to discontinue colchicine altogether.
42.2 You are asked to see a 70-year-old woman with a swollen right knee that is
warm and tender. You perform an arthrocentesis and observe positively birefringent rhomboid-shaped crystals on polarized microscopy. The Gram stain
shows no organisms, and the synovial fluid culture grows no organisms. Which
of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Gout
B. Pseudogout
C. Rheumatoid arthritis
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus
42.3 Which of the following is a false statement regarding the causes of hyperuricemia?
A. The most common cause of hyperuricemia is under excretion.
B. Myeloproliferative disorders are a secondary cause of uric acid overproduction.
C. Primary under excretion of uric acid is related to hereditary excretion
defects.
D. Ethanol increases urate production and increases urate excretion.

ANSWERS
42.1 D. Allopurinol should be started as prophylaxis and should be initiated while
taking colchicine or an NSAID to prevent a gout flare. Urate-lowering treatments, such as allopurinol, should not be administered during an acute attack.
Although weight loss and decreasing alcohol consumption are generally helpful in the management of gout, this patient is not overweight and does not
admit to consuming an excessive amount of alcohol. Stopping colchicine
without a prophylactic agent raises his risk of future flares.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

387

42.2 B. Pseudogout is caused by calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystals, which
are weakly birefringent positive on polarized microscopy. Pseudogout most
commonly affects the knee and, unlike gout, is more common in women than
men. Polyarticular gout and pseudogout may mimic rheumatoid arthritis. The
lack of symmetry, prolonged morning stiffness, positive serologies, and systemic symptoms may help differentiate polyarticular crystal arthropathy from
rheumatoid arthritis.
42.3 D. Ethanol increases urate production but decreases urate excretion. Ninety
percent of hyperuricemia is due to under excretion of uric acid. It is now
known that primary underexcretion of gout is related to hereditary defects
that involve the transport of uric acid in renal tubules. Renal insufficiency as
well as drugs and toxins are secondary causes of uric acid under excretion.

CLINICAL PEARLS


An elevated serum uric acid level is the strongest risk factor for gout but
may not be present during an acute flare.



The gold standard for the diagnosis of crystal-induced arthropathy is
arthrocentesis with crystal analysis.



Septic arthritis must be considered when assessing the patient with acute
monoarticular arthritis.



Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.



Uric acid–lowering agents must not be initiated during an acute flare and
should be coadministered initially with colchicine or NSAID prophylaxis.

CASE 43
An otherwise healthy 45-year-old woman presents to your clinic complaining of
bilateral wrist pain. Over the last 4 weeks she has noticed that her wrists have
been swollen and warm, and she has had difficulty completing tasks (eg, cleaning,
turning door knobs) as a result of pain. The pain is particularly bad in the morning, when she also notices that both wrists are extraordinarily stiff; it typically takes
at least 60 minutes for the stiffness to improve, and running them under warm
water often helps. She has also felt quite fatigued. She recalls no recent viral-like
illness, rashes, or sick contacts. She has been using ibuprofen every day for the
pain with some relief of her symptoms, but she has developed an upset stomach
as a result. On your exam, you find that both wrists are swollen, warm, and generally boggy. When you rotate her hand at the wrist she complains of exquisite pain
that limits the range of motion. When you evaluate the small joints of her hands,
you note multiple swollen, tender, and warm proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints that have a restricted range of motion because
of pain. The remainder of her exam is unremarkable. She has a 20 pack-year smoking history. She does not recall a family history of arthritis or other connective
tissue disease.

ANSWERS TO CASE 43:
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Summary: A premenopausal woman presents to you with a several-week history of
a debilitating symmetrical polyarthritis that is associated with prolonged morning
stiffness and fatigue. Her exam demonstrates active synovitis, without findings to
suggest extraarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis. She has had no recent
viral illness, reports no significant family history, and has a significant smoking history. Her exam has no findings that would suggest an alternative diagnosis.
• Most likely diagnosis: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
• Laboratory testing: Standard laboratory tests include erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor titer, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) titer. Of these, anti-CCP is the most specific
for rheumatoid arthritis.
• Hand x-rays: In RA patients with aggressive, advanced, or insufficiently treated
disease, x-rays of the hands (and feet) often reveal juxtaarticular erosions
(Figure 43–1B) and joint space narrowing (Figure 43–1C), which are both
progressive and irreversible. X-rays early in the disease course may be normal
(Figure 43–1A) or may show evidence of osteopenia.
• Extraarticular manifestations of RA: Rheumatoid nodules, ocular symptoms
(eg, keratoconjunctivitis, scleritis), vasculitis, cardiac disease (eg, pericarditis,
valvular heart disease, conduction abnormalities), neurologic disease (eg, nerve
entrapment, mononeuritis multiplex), pulmonary disease, anemia, and cutaneous findings

• Medication to begin: Methotrexate for long-term management of RA, with
close reassessment of effectiveness, recognizing the potential need to switch or
add medications

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with the general presentation and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.
2. Be familiar with the use of rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, and radiology in the
diagnosis of RA.
3. Understand the basic approach to treating rheumatoid arthritis.
4. Understand the prognosis of patients with RA.

Considerations
Rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogeneous group of systemic diseases characterized by
a symmetric inflammatory polyarthritis that, if untreated, leads to joint erosions,
disability, and a shortened life expectancy. It is more common in women than men,
people of northern European and North American ancestry, and people older than
65 years of age. The annual incidence of RA is estimated to be 0.5 per 1000 persons.
This patient has a fairly characteristic presentation of RA, with indolent symmetrical
polyarthritis primarily affecting smaller joints and a history of prolonged morning
stiffness. Notably, our patient had no recent viral-like illness to suggest a related
polyarthritis, which may be difficult to distinguish from RA. She has a history of
smoking, which in population studies has been identified as a risk factor for RA.

APPROACH TO:
Rheumatoid Arthritis
DEFINITIONS
DISEASE-MODIFYING ANTI-RHEUMATIC DRUGS (DMARDs): A diverse
group of medications unified by their shared ability to reduce inflammation and
prevent disease progression. Methotrexate is the most commonly used DMARD.
BIOLOGIC DMARDs: DMARDs that are developed and produced in live cell
systems. Examples include tumor necrosis factor inhibitors such as infliximab and
etanercept.
TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR: A cytokine in the inflammatory cascade that is
overexpressed and overproduced in rheumatoid arthritis.

392

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

CLINICAL APPROACH
Differential Diagnosis
When evaluating a patient with inflammatory polyarthritis, differential diagnoses
include connective tissue disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease, vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); crystalinduced arthropathy; viral-induced arthritis such as those caused by hepatitis
C and parvovirus B-19; and seronegative spondyloarthropathies such as psoriatic
arthritis. The history and physical exam can often help guide your assessment.
Laboratories such as RF and anti-CCP, as described later, may suggest RA but can
also be positive in other connective tissue disorders. A high antinuclear antibody
(ANA) titer may suggest an alternative or overlap syndrome that includes SLE.
People who regularly interact with children, such as schoolteachers, may be at risk for
parvovirus B-19, whereas intravenous drug users are at increased risk for hepatitis C;
antibody assays are available for both conditions. Primary osteoarthritis is a noninflammatory arthritis, although secondary osteoarthritis may occur secondary to
inflammatory joint diseases.

Diagnosis
Obtaining a detailed history of the disease process is paramount in accurately
diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. Early in the disease, smaller joints (eg, PIPs, MCPs,
metatarsophalangeals [MTPs], wrists) are affected; with time, larger joints including
the knees, ankles, and elbows may be affected. The distal interphalangeal (DIP)
joints are almost always spared in RA. Often, there is symmetric joint involvement
(both within a single joint and when comparing both sides of the body), and patients
describe prolonged morning stiffness (> 60 minutes). Early disease is characterized
by joint inflammation, whereas untreated, late disease is notable for joint deformity.
A number of different sets of criteria have been developed to diagnose patients with
rheumatoid arthritis. One set of guidelines relies on a point system based on joint
involvement, serology, acute phase reactants, and the duration of symptoms.

Role of Serologies and Radiology in RA
RF is an antibody (typically immunoglobulin M) targeted against the Fc portion
of immunoglobulin G, which is positive in most patients at some point in their
disease course. The sensitivity and specificity of RF are estimated to be 66% and
82%, respectively; bacterial endocarditis, older age, and other conditions have been
associated with a weakly positive RF. Anti-CCP antibodies are also found in patients
with RA, with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 95%, respectively. Typically,
anti-CCP positive patients suffer from more severe disease and are less likely to
achieve remission, as are those with high RF titers. Approximately 50% to 85% of
patients with RA are positive for RF, anti-CCP, or both during their disease course;
some patients never test positive for RF or anti-CCP, and others test positive before
experiencing any symptoms. Radiographs early in the disease may show periarticular osteopenia but the more common finding is juxtaarticular bone erosion and
symmetrical joint space narrowing (as compared with asymmetric narrowing in
osteoarthritis). The role of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound in the
assessment of RA is still being defined.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

393

Extraarticular Manifestations of RA
Because 50% of patients are affected by extraarticular manifestations of RA at some
point, patients should periodically be assessed for such involvement. Sjogren syndrome,
which is characterized by dry eyes and mouth, is the most common extraarticular manifestation. Rheumatoid nodules are found on pressure points (eg, elbows) in patients
with RA, typically those positive for rheumatoid factor; they are firm, nontender, and
adherent to the periosteum. Complaints of dyspnea or difficulty breathing should raise
concern for associated interstitial lung disease. As with other chronic inflammatory
conditions, RA patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

TREATMENT
The primary goal of treatment is remission with no evidence of active disease. Based
on studies of historical cohort data, 5% to 15% of patients achieve drug-free remission, but many patients will relapse. At a minimum, treatment should limit the
severity of disease and disability, leading to an improvement in the patient’s quality
of life. Frequent (every 2-3 months) reassessment of disease activity is necessary to
determine treatment effectiveness. The key to treating rheumatoid arthritis is
the early initiation of DMARDs, particularly methotrexate. Thus, nearly all patients
with RA are started on methotrexate at diagnosis unless contraindicated, in which
case sulfasalazine or leflunomide may be substituted. Alternatively, for more severe
disease, multiple DMARDs (eg, methotrexate and leflunomide) may be initiated
simultaneously to gain control of disease activity, or biologic DMARDs may be
introduced.
The addition of biologic DMARDs (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors,
anti-CD20 therapy, anti-interleukin 1 therapy, T-cell costimulator modulators, and
anti-interleukin 6 therapy) to the rheumatologist’s armamentarium represents a
milestone in RA treatment because of their effectiveness, but the precise role of
biologics, especially in early disease, is controversial, and the aim of numerous active clinical trials. Of the biologics, TNF inhibitors are typically reached for first
and combined with a classic DMARD (eg, methotrexate). The biologics, as a class,
are not benign and carry increased risk of infection (eg, usual infections as well as
reactivation of tuberculosis and viral hepatitis).
Factors to consider when initiating treatment include the severity of the illness,
medication cost, and the risk of side effects. Management of flares may be undertaken
with short courses of high-dose steroids to bridge to DMARDs, with an emphasis on a short course to limit side effects (eg, osteoporosis, diabetes, glaucoma).
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) limit pain as well as inflammation in flares but are limited by gastrointestinal intolerance and an increased risk
of cardiac disease. Analgesics may be useful for the management of severe pain, but
their use should also be minimized.

PROGNOSIS OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENTS
Advances in our knowledge of the natural history of RA and the development of
more sophisticated treatment modalities have led to significantly improved outcomes in RA. Without treatment, RA is typically a progressive disease that will

394

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

leave patients disabled with chronic pain and at increased risk for other conditions,
such as cardiovascular disease, the most common cause of death in RA patients.
Evidence suggests that the severity of RA may be lessening; it is not clear whether
this is because more patients with mild disease are being identified, because of new
drug development, or because of more aggressive treatment strategies. A number
of conditions have been associated with RA, including infection, osteoporosis,
lymphoproliferative disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Reducing risk factors for
these comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease, is important to improving
life expectancy in patients with RA.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
43.1 A 38-year-old woman is referred to your office with bilateral wrist, MCP, and
PIP pain. Her pains are worst in the morning and become tolerable after taking ibuprofen. She complains of mild subjective fevers but has no other constitutional symptoms and no remarkable family history. Anti-CCP and RF titers
are positive. A diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is made, and she is started on
a DMARD regimen. How do you counsel her regarding her life expectancy?
A. She has no different life expectancy than age-matched controls.
B. She has a longer life expectancy than age-matched controls.
C. She has a shorter life expectancy than age-matched controls because of
increased risk of infection.
D. She has a shorter life expectancy than age-matched controls because of
premature atherosclerosis in the setting of systemic inflammation.
43.2 You are working in a hand clinic and see a large population of patients with
preexisting diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis. Which of the following patients
do you expect to have a more aggressive form of rheumatoid arthritis?
A. A 45-year-old woman who is positive for RF and anti-CCP.
B. A 65-year-old woman who is positive for RF and negative for anti-CCP.
C. A 60-year-old man who has a low positive ANA titer, a negative RF, and
a negative anti-CCP.
D. A 60-year-old woman with a negative RF and a negative anti-CCP.
43.3 A 50-year-old woman presents to your office with complaints of morning pains
in her PIPs, MCPs, and wrists. After positive serologic testing, the diagnosis
of rheumatic arthritis is made. Which of these treatment regimens is most
appropriate?
A. Ibuprofen 800 mg orally every 8 hours until symptoms improve
B. Methotrexate 15 mg orally once weekly and prednisone 40 mg orally
daily, with a short taper of prednisone
C. Etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously every week
D. Prednisone 40 mg orally once daily until symptoms improve

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

43.4 A 62-year-old woman with a 15-year history of rheumatoid arthritis is seen
in your office for follow-up. Her symptoms are predominantly located in her
bilateral MCPs and PIPs and have been moderately controlled on a DMARD
regimen. Follow-up x-rays of her hands are obtained. Which of the following radiographic descriptions is most commonly associated with rheumatoid
arthritis?
A. Asymmetric joint space narrowing
B. Symmetric joint space narrowing and juxtaarticular bone erosions
C. Multiple fractures of different stages of healing
D. Bone erosion with an overhanging edge
E.

Radio-opaque depositions throughout the joint space and mild joint effusion

ANSWERS
43.1 D. Patients with RA have a shorter life expectancy, thought to be related to
systemic inflammation, which causes premature atherosclerosis. Life expectancy in RA patients, however, is likely improving as our management of
RA becomes more aggressive and new treatment options are introduced. RA
patients are at increased risk of infection, especially with some treatments, so
it is important to administer the flu vaccine annually, as well as the pneumococcal vaccination.
43.2 A. The presence of RF and anti-CCP antibodies are both associated with more
severe disease. A low titer ANA in most patients without additional symptoms to suggest an alternative diagnosis is likely of no immediate significance.
43.3 B. Steroids should not be used for extended periods of time but are useful to
gain quick control of disease activity as a bridge to a DMARD, such as methotrexate, which is appropriate chronic therapy. Generally, TNF inhibitors, such
as etanercept, and other biologic DMARDs are not used as first-line therapy
except in severe disease. High-dose NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, are not suitable monotherapy for RA, as they do not slow the progression of disease and
carry potentially severe side effects.
43.4 B. Symmetric joint space narrowing and juxtaarticular bone erosions may be
seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Very early in the disease course, periarticular
osteopenia may be noted, or the joint may appear normal. In gout, x-rays
may show bone erosions with an overhanging edge, suggestive of both atrophy
and hypertrophy. Similarly, osteoarthritis may cause osteophyte growth with
an overhanging edge–like appearance. Asymmetric joint space narrowing is
seen in joints affected by osteoarthritis. Radio-opaque depositions throughout the joint space is descriptive of chondrocalcinosis, a radiographic finding
most often associated with pseudogout. In pseudogout, radio-opaque calciumpyrophosphate crystals are deposited in the joint and cause inflammatory
states that may lead to joint effusions.

CASE 44
A 5-year-old African American boy is referred to your office for management of
a nondisplaced right middle-third clavicle fracture after a witnessed fall from
standing. He complains of mild pain over the clavicle, but has no other complaints.
He has no history of previous fractures nor any other significant past medical
history. His mother states that she strongly believes in “natural” medicine and is
relieved when you explain her son will not need surgery on his clavicle. On further
discussion, you learn that the entire family abides by a strict vegan diet and that
his family has recently moved to the area from Minnesota. On physical exam, the
patient is below the 10th percentile for both height and weight. He is appropriately
tender over the right middle clavicle. There is no skin tenting or neurovascular
dysfunction in the right upper extremity. Additional findings include bilateral outwardly bowed knees and a mild spinal kyphosis. His sclerae are white. The child’s
right arm is placed in a sling, and a prescription for low-dose acetaminophen with
codeine is written.

ANSWERS TO CASE 44:
Rickets
Summary: This is a 5-year-old child with a nondisplaced clavicle fracture. He is well
below height and weight averages for his age and has evidence of malnutrition and
poor bone quality, including bilateral genu varum and kyphosis.
• Most likely diagnosis: Nutritional rickets.
• Risk factors for nutritional rickets: Decreased vitamin D intake from diet
(vegan diet), dark skin tone, and decreased exposure to direct sunlight (previously living at northern latitudes).
• Next appropriate diagnostic studies: The next appropriate step is to obtain
serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Radiographic survey should include images of
the bilateral upper and lower extremities, skull, abdomen/pelvis, and chest.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the basic pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and radiographic
signs of rickets.
2. Understand the differences between nutritional and nonnutritional rickets.
3. Be familiar with the basic management of rickets and recognize when referral to
subspecialists is necessary.

Considerations
The presence of a clavicle fracture in infants and young children grossly below
norms of height, weight, and/or head circumference should alert examiners to the
possibility of an underlying diagnosis of rickets or metabolic bone disorders. Further
historical elements that are concerning for a diagnosis of rickets include poor diet,
limited exposure to sunlight, and dark skin tone. Examiners should be sure to ask
about previous history of fractures, familial history of metabolic bone diseases, and,
as always, carefully evaluate pediatric patients with fractures for the possibility of
physical abuse. Although this child presented with a clavicle fracture, a complete
and thorough physical examination of all 4 extremities, spine, and skull should be
performed. Careful examination of this patient revealed bilateral genu varum and
kyphosis—significant findings that may have been missed if the examiner had only
examined the symptomatic right upper extremity.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

399

APPROACH TO:
Rickets
DEFINITIONS
OSTEOPENIA: Diffusely decreased bone mineral density (BMD) that can be diagnosed on plain x-ray. Defined formally by the World Health Organization as exhibiting a T-score between –1.0 and –2.5 on dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
scanning.
OSTEOMALACIA: Defective mineralization of osteoid (the organic component
of bone) affecting both children and adults. Osteomalacia is referred to as rickets
when found in patients with open skeletal growth plates.
GENU VARUM: Outward (lateral) bowing about the knee. Considered a normal
physiologic finding in patients with mild bowing up to 3 to 4 years of age, but is
considered pathologic in older children.
GENU VALGUM: Inward bowing about the knee; sometimes referred to as
“knock-knees.”

CLINICAL APPROACH
Rickets is a nonspecific term that refers to a variety of pediatric disorders in which
there is defective mineralization of bone. This leads to bone deformities such as
bowing and growth retardation. Osteomalacia is a similarly generalized term describing the defective mineralization process of osteoid; when present in pediatric
populations (or patients with open physes), it is referred to as rickets.

Etiologies and Pathophysiology
Rickets is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D—whether secondary to inadequate
dietary intake, inadequate production from insufficient exposure to sunlight, defects
in metabolic pathways, or genetic defects leading to an aberrant biochemical
response to vitamin D.
Regardless of etiology, insufficient vitamin D in rickets leads to insufficient circulating concentrations of calcium and/or phosphorous, 2 minerals that comprise
the inorganic components of healthy bone. Osteoid, or the organic collagenous scaffold of bone, becomes incompletely mineralized. As a result, bones are therefore
“soft” and prone to bowing (chronic bending deformities typically in the long bones
of the lower extremities), compression (commonly seen in vertebral bodies, leading
to kyphosis), and fracture.

Nutritional Rickets
Rickets may be divided into nutritional and nonnutritional types. Nutritional
rickets, perhaps more appropriately labeled vitamin D-deficient rickets, results from
inadequate intake or inadequate production of vitamin D, secondary to insufficient
exposure to sunlight. Vegan diets are notoriously implicated in rickets, as strict followers avoid almost all natural dietary sources of vitamin D, including fish, eggs,
meats, and dairy. Patients who have been exclusively breast-fed without vitamin D
supplementation are also at risk, because human breast milk alone is not a sufficient

400

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

source of vitamin D. Similarly at risk are children living in northern regions (latitudes northward of New York City) and dark-skinned children whose abundance of
melanin can shield the catalytic effects of ultraviolet light in the dermal production
of previtamin D3 from its cholesterol derivatives. Previtamin D3 is a precursor to the
active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This hydroxylation process—the pathway by which vitamin D becomes biochemically active—occurs next
in the liver, and finally in the kidneys. Renal and/or hepatic failure, therefore, can
also lead to rickets. Figure 44–1 depicts the metabolic pathways by which vitamin D
is synthesized and activated.

Nonnutritional Rickets
Nonnutritional rickets refers to a group of several genetic disorders affecting enzymes
responsible for vitamin D metabolism. Although many mutations have been described, the most common form of nonnutritional rickets is familial hypophosphatemic rickets, caused by an X-linked mutation resulting in defective phosphate
transport in the renal tubules. As a general rule, management should be referred to
pediatric endocrinology specialists, as these diseases often have complex workups
and disease-specific therapies.

Clinical Findings
Greenstick fractures after minimal trauma may be a heralding sign of rickets.
Ambulatory toddlers often present with vague bone pain, waddling gate, and/or angular bowing of the lower extremity long bones with “genu varum,” or outwardly
bowed knees. Older children may instead exhibit genu valgum, or “knocked knees.”
Additional findings include pectus deformities and exaggerated curvatures of the
spine marked by increased thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. Patients with
severe forms of the disease may even exhibit generalized muscular weakness, tetany, or
“floppiness” in infants, secondary to decreased concentrations of circulating calcium.

Laboratory and Radiographic Findings
All patients with histories or physical exams suspicious for rickets should receive laboratory testing for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcium,
phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Patients with nutritional rickets will
typically have findings of normal-to-low levels of serum calcium, low phosphate, low
vitamin D, and increased levels of alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone.
Radiographs of long bones typically show bowed diaphyses with widening of
metaphyses. Metaphyses may also appear “cupped,” with a central area of depression and are frayed at the periphery. Generalized osteopenia may be evident. Finally,
chest x-ray may reveal rachitic rosary, or a beaded-like appearance of the ribs, secondary to heterogenous enlargement of the costal cartilage.

Management
Patients with nutritional rickets respond largely to dietary vitamin D supplementation.
Breast-fed infants are recommended to receive oral supplementation with 400 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily and/or increased sunlight or ultraviolet light
exposure. For infants, exposure to a half-hour of sunlight per week in the summer while
wearing only a diaper, or 2 hours per week while clothed, is considered sufficient.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants may benefit
from vitamin D supplementation until they are able to drink 500 mL of vitamin
D–fortified milk or formula daily. As stated, patients with nonnutritional rickets
should generally be referred to a pediatric endocrinologist for further workup and
management. In patients undergoing workup for surgical correction for long bone
deformities, it is essential that the disease is metabolically stable.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
44.1 A 6-year-old girl is seen in your office with complaints of insidious bilateral
leg pain, 3 months in duration. She is otherwise healthy and is fair-skinned
and freckled. Because of a strong family history of skin cancer, her parents
rarely let her play outside. On physical exam, she exhibits mild genu valgum,
or “knocked-knees.” Plain radiographs are obtained. Which of the following is
a radiographic feature likely to be seen?
A. Diffuse ground-glass opacities in the femoral diaphyses
B. “Rugger jersey” appearance of spine on lateral chest x-ray
C. Physeal widening of the proximal and distal tibiae
D. Dense metaphyseal lines of the proximal and distal tibiae
44.2 A mother and her 2 young sons are referred to your clinic. Although the
mother appears normal, both boys are noticeably short and exhibit marked
genu varum. The mother states that their father exhibits similar symptoms.
Following workup, a diagnosis of familial primary hypophosphatemia (FPH) is
made. This cause of nonnutritional rickets results from which of the following?
A. X-linked dominant mutation in PHEX gene
B. Autosomal dominant mutation in PHEX gene
C. Recessive mutation in vitamin D receptor gene
D. X-linked mutation in vitamin D receptor gene
44.3 A 13-year-old female with a history of celiac disease is referred to your clinic
with complaints of generalized bone pain and weakness, as well as recent complaints of occasional muscle spasms. On exam, she is noted to have poor dentition, bowed long bones, and mildly tender areas of costochondral swelling.
Laboratory testing will likely show which of the following?
A. Increased serum calcium, decreased phosphate, increased alkaline phosphatase
B. Decreased serum calcium, decreased phosphate, increased alkaline phosphatase
C. Decreased serum calcium, decreased phosphate, decreased alkaline phosphatase
D. Increased serum calcium, increased phosphate, increased alkaline phosphatase

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

403

ANSWERS
44.1 C. Nutritional rickets, which includes rickets secondary to inadequate
sunlight exposure, may produce radiographic findings of physeal cupping and
widening, generalized osteopenia, and genu varum or valgum. Physeal widening is caused by abnormal mineralization at the growth plate or chondroid
calcification. This leads to a build-up of chondroid at the physis, which gives
the appearance of widened physis on radiographs. A “rugger jersey” spine is
seen in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic renal failure or osteopetrosis. Dense metaphyseal banding may be indicative of lead
poisoning or heavy metal deposition. Ground glass opacities are a relatively
nonspecific finding, sometimes seen in fibrous dysplasia.
44.2 A. FPH is the most common form of nonnutritional vitamin D–independent
rickets. It is caused by an X-linked dominant mutation in the phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidase, or PHEX, gene. This mutation causes an excessive excretion of phosphate in the renal tubules.
44.3 B. Many patients suffering from gastrointestinal disorders have an elevated
risk for developing nutritional rickets, due to malabsorption of vitamin D,
a fat-soluble vitamin. Decreased absorption of vitamin D leads to a subsequent
decrease in serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations. Decreased serum
calcium and phosphorous will cause the increase in alkaline phosphatase.

CLINICAL PEARLS


In developed countries, nutritional rickets is uncommon.



Clavicle fractures in infants grossly below weight, height, and/or head
circumference norms should alert the examiner to the possibility of an
underlying diagnosis of rickets.



Common radiographic findings of rickets include bowed long bone
diaphyses with “cupped,” “frayed,” or widened metaphyses. Chest x-ray
may reveal rachitic rosary, or a beaded-like appearance of the ribs.

CASE 45
A 60-year-old white woman presents for a 6-week postoperative follow-up after
intramedullary fixation of her intertrochanteric femoral neck fracture. She sustained the fracture after she tripped in her kitchen. In clinic, she gives a history of
a low-energy distal radius fracture 5 years ago. She also believes that she recently
has become shorter. Her family history is significant for multiple fractures in her
mother and sister. She had an early menopause at the age of 40 and did not
receive hormone replacement therapy. She has no other significant past medical
history and is otherwise in good health. Physical exam reveals a 52-inch tall frail
elderly woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 19 kg/m2. Her height has decreased
by 2.5 inches over the past several years. She has a significant kyphosis of her
thoracic spine and an unsteady gait. Her surgical wound is healing well.

ANSWERS TO CASE 45:
Osteoporosis
Summary: A 60-year-old postmenopausal woman presents after sustaining multiple
fragility fractures. She has a family history of fractures in first-degree relatives. She
recently lost height and has significant kyphosis of the thoracic spine.
• Most likely diagnosis: Osteoporosis.
• Investigations: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), complete metabolic panel, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and urine collagen
N-telopeptide crosslinks (NTX).
• Initial treatment: Physical therapy, calcium and vitamin D supplementation,
and bisphosphonates.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and underlying conditions leading
to fragility fractures.
2. Develop a comprehensive approach to patients with osteoporosis including
history, physical exam, appropriate laboratory investigations, and DXA.
3. Be aware of potential nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments to prevent future fragility fractures.

Considerations
This case presents a postmenopausal woman who has suffered a low-energy hip fracture: a devastating sequelae of osteoporosis. According to the most recent statistics,
50% of patients who sustain a hip fracture will never attain their previous functional status, and 25% will die within the first year after the fracture. The annual
cost of all osteoporotic fractures is as high as $18 billion; yet, as is the case with this
patient, 80% of patients who have had a previous fragility fracture do not receive
treatment for osteoporosis. The patient in this case has several risk factors that
warrant an osteoporosis workup and treatment: female sex, white race, personal
history of a previous fragility fracture, history of fracture in a first-degree relative,
low BMI, and early menopause. Menopause leads to an increased risk of osteoporosis
as a result of the loss of estrogen’s suppressive effects on osteoclast-mediated bone
resorption. Activation of osteoclasts results in rapid loss of bone mineral density
(BMD), increasing the patient’s risk of fracture. Furthermore, because estrogen is
synthesized in peripheral adipose tissue, the patient’s low BMI results in even lower
estrogen levels. Being frail could indicate poor nutrition and potentially inadequate
calcium and vitamin D intake, further increasing her risk of fracture. Her kyphosis
and loss of height are also common complications of osteoporosis owing to compression fractures of the spinal vertebrae.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

407

To prevent future fractures in this patient, a baseline DXA and lab investigations
should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of primary osteoporosis and rule out
secondary causes. Serum calcium and vitamin D must be corrected with daily supplementation. Fall prevention needs to be addressed to decrease this patient’s risk
of future fracture. Pharmacologic treatment is indicated, and bisphosphonates are
first-line agents. Bone markers are then used to monitor bisphosphonate treatment.

APPROACH TO:
Osteoporosis
DEFINITIONS
FRAGILITY FRACTURES: Fractures after low-energy trauma such as a fall from
standing height or less.
DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA): The standard tool to
measure BMD for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Bone mass is reported as a real density, which is then compared with both age-matched adults (Z-score) and young
healthy adults (T-score). Z and T scores represent standard deviations from the
mean established by the comparison group. Bone density is characterized by the lowest value at the spine, femoral neck, trochanter, or total femur. T-score values of 0 to
–1 are considered normal; –1 to –2.5 indicates osteopenia; lower than –2.5 indicates
osteoporosis.
PRIMARY OSTEOPOROSIS: A skeletal disorder characterized by compromised
bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture that occurs in individuals
as they age or after menopause
SECONDARY OSTEOPOROSIS: Osteoporosis due to an underlying cause of
bone loss and structural deterioration that can be treated, such as an endocrine
abnormality, medication, or neoplastic condition. Table 45–1 outlines the causes of
secondary osteoporosis.
FRAX: A fracture risk assessment tool developed by the World Health Organization, which merges BMD and clinical risk factors to establish a 10-year fracture risk.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology of osteoporosis
Bone strength is determined by 2 factors: bone quantity and quality. Bone quantity is
assessed by DXA, which measures BMD. Bone quality, on the other hand, is a function of the microarchitecture and mineral and collagen composition of the extracellular matrix. In general, bone undergoes a dynamic process of renewal that involves
coupling of both bone resorption and formation, known as bone remodeling. Bone
remodeling, or turnover, is the principal factor that controls both the quality and
quantity of bone in the adult skeleton.
Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and the structural deterioration
of bone tissue, which leads to bone fragility and an increased susceptibility to fractures.

In osteoporosis, there is an imbalance between osteoclast-mediated bone resorption
and osteoblast-mediated bone formation. High-turnover osteoporosis is characterized by an increased activity of osteoclasts, leading to bone loss and an abnormal
bone microarchitecture. This is the most common form of osteoporosis and occurs in
postmenopausal women or in patients with hyperparathyroidism. In low-turnover
osteoporosis, a reduction in osteoblastic activity leads to reduced bone formation.
This type of osteoporosis is seen in the elderly or after interventions that inhibit
the activity of osteoblasts, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or corticosteroids.
Any other underlying condition that disturbs the balance of bone remodeling can
potentially lead to osteoporosis (Table 45–1).

Patient Evaluation
Osteoporosis is frequently recognized when a patient seeks medical attention for
back pain, fragility fracture, or loss of height or spinal deformity due to vertebral
compression fractures. Once osteoporosis is suspected, the patient should be evaluated with a comprehensive medical history and physical examination. The primary
aim of the patient history is to identify modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors
(Table 45–2).
Findings on physical exam may include spinal deformities such as exaggerated
thoracic kyphosis, loss of height from osteoporotic compression fractures (often
> 2 inches), and clinical signs of potential collagen disorders such as joint laxity, skin
hyperextensibility, blue sclera, translucent teeth, and other skeletal abnormalities.
Also, gait and balance should be examined to assess for increased risk of falls.
DXA is currently the reference standard for BMD measurement. Determining
BMD at the spine and hip is needed to confirm the diagnosis of osteoporosis, assess
the rate of BMD loss, and predict future fracture risk. The National Osteoporosis
Foundation (NOF) recommends DXA screening for all women over 65 years of
age and men over 70 years regardless of risk factors, or younger postmenopausal
women with one or more risk factors.

Laboratory testing is performed to rule out secondary causes of osteoporosis,
assess the severity of the disease, and establish baseline data to measure the response
to therapeutic interventions. Serum calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D],
and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are measured to rule out osteomalacia, vitamin D
deficiency, and hyperparathyroidism. Other tests include thyroid and renal function
tests and a 24-hour urine calcium. Bone turnover can be assessed by measuring biochemical bone markers, categorized as markers of bone formation or bone resorption
(Table 45–3). Bone markers are also used to measure response to treatment.

TREATMENT
Nonpharmacologic Treatment
The goal of treatment in patients with either osteoporosis or a fragility fracture is to
prevent future fractures. Nonpharmacologic treatment to ensure proper bone health
is crucial for every orthopaedic patient (see Figure 45–1). Calcium supplementation
has been shown to decrease fracture rates and is recommended for all osteoporotic
patients. Vitamin D has been shown to be important in maintaining calcium homeostasis, preventing falls and even improving muscle function. Serum monitoring
of 25(OH)D and PTH levels is done to ensure that 25(OH)D levels are maintained

in the normal range and to prevent elevations in serum PTH. In addition to optimizing calcium and vitamin D levels, physicians should focus on eliminating modifiable
risk factors such as smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and recurrent falls. Fall
prevention requires a multifactorial approach that addresses vision deficits, balance
and gait abnormalities, cognitive impairments, and dizziness. It is also important to
eliminate medications that can affect alertness and balance.

Pharmacologic treatment
According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), indications for pharmacologic treatment include men and postmenopausal women age 50 and older
presenting with a hip or vertebral fracture, a T-score of –2.5 or below, or low
bone mass (T-score between –1.0 and –2.5) accompanied by a high probability of
future fracture as determined by the FRAX. Pharmacologic treatment for osteoporosis can currently be divided into 2 categories: antiresorptive and anabolic agents.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

411

Antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates diminish rapid osteoclast-mediated
resorption, whereas anabolic agents such as teriparatide build bone by stimulating
osteoblast activity. Although both antiresorptive and anabolic agents have demonstrated antifracture efficacy, bisphosphonates are considered the first-line treatment
for patients with osteoporosis.
Bisphosphonates have been proven to be effective in reducing fractures, improving BMD, and normalizing elevated serum bone markers. In patients with a fragility
fracture, it is considered ideal to begin bisphosphonate treatment between 2 and
12 weeks after the fracture to ensure increased callus size and strength in healing.
Bisphosphonates can be given orally, but can cause gastrointestinal complications,
which may require intravenous delivery in some patients. It is important to normalize serum calcium and vitamin D before initiating bisphosphonate treatment, as a
common electrolyte abnormality attributed to bisphosphonates is hypocalcemia.
Teriparatide is a recombinant human parathyroid hormone and is the only
approved anabolic agent for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Teriparatide can lead to an increase in BMD at the lumbar spine and reduce the risk
of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. Although no consensus exists on when to
treat osteoporosis with teriparatide, it should be considered in patients with continued bone loss or fragility fractures despite antiresorptive therapy, or patients
with low turnover osteoporosis. Teriparatide is contraindicated in patients with
active metastatic skeletal disease, or patients with high risk for developing osteosarcoma, including patients with active Paget disease or a history of skeletal radiation.
Currently, treatment is recommended for up to 24 months, followed by bisphosphonate therapy to maintain the improvement in BMD.
Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Because of its side-effect profile, raloxifene is
likely best used in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are unable to tolerate bisphosphonates, have no vasomotor symptoms or history of venous thromboembolism, and have a high breast cancer risk score. Other therapies for the treatment
of osteoporosis include hormone therapy and calcitonin, which are not as effective
as the first-line medications.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
45.1 A 65-year-old white woman presents to your clinic after her first DXA. Her
spine T-score is –2.2, and her right femoral neck T-score is –2.9. What is the
best next step to reduce her risk of future fractures?
A. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation
B. Raloxifene
C. Calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates
D. Calcium, vitamin D, and teriparatide
E. Bisphosphonates

412

CASE FILES: ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY

45.2 A 70-year-old woman was prescribed alendronate for treatment of her osteoporosis. She presents to the clinic with a chief complaint of severe nausea, acidity, and heartburn after taking her medication. She had a history
of gastrointestinal reflux disease and an “irritable stomach.” Her NTX:Cr
(N-telopeptide:creatinine) ratio was 45 (therapeutic range, 20-30). What is
the most appropriate treatment option for this patient?
A. Risedronate
B. Ibandronate
C. Zoledronate
D. Teriparatide (PTH)
E. Raloxifene
45.3 A 58-year-old osteoporotic woman presents with persistent hypocalcemia
after 3 months of adequate treatment with calcium and vitamin D. Today
her corrected calcium is 8.7 (normal range: 8.8-10.2 mg/dL), vitamin D of
35 (normal range: 30-100 ng/mL), and PTH of 100 (normal range: 10-65 pg/
mL). A 24-hour urinary calcium test is ordered. Additionally, which of the
following tests should be part of her metabolic workup?
A. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
B. Fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C
C. 24-hour urinary creatinine
D. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) or anti-endomysium
antibodies
E. None of the above
43.4 A 78-year-old woman with known history of osteoporosis sustained a lowenergy rib fracture. Despite the fact that she has been on alendronate for 4
years, her DXA T-score continues to decline. She is currently being treated
conservatively with pain management. What is the appropriate next step in
managing her osteoporosis?
A. Stop alendronate.
B. Lower the dose of alendronate.
C. Switch to risedronate.
D. Stop alendronate and start teriparatide.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

413

ANSWERS
45.1 C. Because bone density is characterized by the lowest T-score at any site,
the patient’s femoral neck T-score places her in the osteoporotic range. The
NOF recommends pharmacologic therapy for patients with T-scores below
–2.5. Bisphosphonates are the first line of treatment and therefore should be
initiated in this patient. Because bisphosphonate therapy can cause hypocalcemia, calcium and vitamin D should be corrected and monitored. Raloxifene
(choice B) remains inferior to bisphosphonates, as it has not shown to reduce
risk of hip fractures. Teriparatide (choice D) is currently reserved as a “rescue”
drug for patients who fail bisphosphonate therapy.
45.2 C. Oral bisphosphonates include alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate.
In patients who have no underlying gastrointestinal sensitivity, side effects
from oral bisphosphonates are uncommon. However, in subjects with a moderate history of gastrointestinal intolerance, side effects are much more common and may approach 20%. These adverse effects include irritation of the
esophagus, acid eructation, nausea, and heartburn. Therefore, all patients are
advised to take oral bisphosphonates on an empty stomach and wait at least
30 minutes in an upright position (sitting or standing) before eating or drinking. Because this patient is experiencing severe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms
while on alendronate, she should be treated with an intravenous bisphosphonate to bypass the GI tract. From the choices given, only zoledronate (choice C)
is given intravenously. The NTX is relatively high, indicating inadequate
suppression of bone turnover due to poor compliance. Intravenous zoledronate can correct the NTX within a few days.
45.3 D. Calcium is one of the major constituents of bone and, coupled with
vitamin D has been shown to reduce the risk of fractures. The Institute of
Medicine recommends 1000 to 1500 mg/day of daily calcium intake. The
calcium management in this case, however, poses a challenge. The patient
continues to have low serum calcium levels despite receiving adequate calcium and vitamin D. In such cases, further laboratory investigation is needed
to rule out conditions or disorders that may increase urinary excretion or
impair calcium absorption from the gut. Testing should include 24-hour urine
calcium excretion and serologic studies to investigate for malabsorption disorders such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy (choice D). TSH (choice A) is
not directly involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis. Testing for diabetes
is not indicated in this scenario, as diabetes is unlikely to account for these
malabsorption-related findings.
45.4 D. This case is an example of a patient who sustained a fragility fracture while
on bisphosphonate therapy. Moreover, her DXA T-score continued to decline
despite bisphosphonate therapy. In such cases, stopping the bisphosphonate
and starting teriparatide to stimulate bone remodeling is recommended. Also,
teriparatide stimulates callus formation, thus enhancing fracture healing and
potentially reducing the rate of delayed union or nonunion.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Careful evaluation of all patients with a fragility fracture will enable the
orthopaedic surgeon to identify the cause of fracture and implement a
treatment plan that can prevent subsequent fractures in this vulnerable
population.



DXA is the standard tool to measure BMD for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. A T-score between –1.0 and –2.5 indicates osteopenia, and below
–2.5 indicates osteoporosis.



Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is important for maintaining
bone strength, enhancing muscle strength, preventing falls, and reducing
the risk of fractures.



Bisphosphonates are the standard treatment for osteoporosis, whereas
teriparatide is reserved for patients at high risk of fracture with declining
BMD despite bisphosphonate therapy.

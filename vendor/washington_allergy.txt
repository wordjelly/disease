Chairman’s Note
t is a pleasure to present the new edition of The Washington Manual ™
Subspecialty Consult Series: Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology
Subspecialty Consult. This pocket-size book continues to be a primary
reference for medical students, interns, residents, and other practitioners
who need ready access to practical clinical information to diagnose and
treat patients with a wide variety of disorders. Medical knowledge
continues to increase at an astounding rate, which creates a challenge for
physicians to keep up with the biomedical discoveries, genetic and
genomic information, and novel therapeutics that can positively impact
patient outcomes. The Washington Manual ™ Subspecialty Consult Series
addresses this challenge by concisely and practically providing current
scientific information for clinicians to aid them in the diagnosis,
investigation, and treatment of common medical conditions.
I want to personally thank the authors, who include house officers,
fellows, and attendings at Washington University School of Medicine and
Barnes Jewish Hospital. Their commitment to patient care and education
is unsurpassed, and their efforts and skill in compiling this manual are
evident in the quality of the final product. In particular, I would like to
acknowledge our editors, Drs. Andrew L. Kau and Shirley Joo, and the
series editors, Drs. Tom De Fer and Katherine Henderson, who have
worked tirelessly to produce another outstanding edition of this manual. I
would also like to thank Dr. Melvin Blanchard, Chief of the Division of
Medical Education in the Department at of Medicine at Washington
University School of Medicine, for his advice and guidance. I believe this
edition of the Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Subspecialty Consult will
meet its desired goal of providing practical knowledge that can be directly
applied at the bedside and in outpatient settings to improve patient care.

Preface
his is the second edition of the Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology
Subspecialty Consult, which incorporates many significant updates to
the prior edition, reflecting current clinical practices and understanding of
allergic and immunologic diseases. Since its inception nearly 70 years ago,
the Washington Manual ™ has been written with the goal of conveying
relevant and up-to-date medical information in a clear and concise
manner. Like the first edition, this edition of the Allergy, Asthma, and
Immunology Subspecialty Consult was written in the tradition of the
Washington Manual ™, with the intent of informing the reader about
current practice in allergy and immunology.
The content of this second edition was written by the residents, fellows,
and staff of the Washington University Department of Medicine. We have
written this manual as a reference tool for interested interns, residents,
medical students, and primary care physicians. Fellows-in-training and
other health care professionals will also find it to be a succinct but
thorough reference tool.

1 Approach to the Allergic Patient
Seth M. Hollander
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
The term allergy is credited to the pediatrician Clemons von Pirquet who
in 1906 used it to describe an “altered biologic reactivity.” This was not
only in reference to immunity against disease but also to
hypersensitivity leading to tissue damage.1
The modern definition of allergy is an overreaction or abnormal response
of the immune system to innocuous substances.1

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
As with most disorders in medicine, the most important component in
diagnosing allergic disorders is taking a thorough history.
Identify the symptom location, character, and frequency, as well as the
alleviating and exacerbating factors.
Exacerbating or alleviating factors:
Seasonal variation of symptoms
Prior response to medications
Reactions to specific and nonspecific exposures
Pets.
Smoke, irritant fumes. Smoke, irritant fumes. Smoke, irritant fumes.
Smoke, irritant fumes.
Perfume.
Change in temperature.
Food, medications, etc.
Environmental History
Common relevant environmental exposures exacerbating symptoms may
13

not be obvious to the patient.
Typical questions that may help to identify relevant exposures include:
Location of home: Rural, urban, suburban.
Work exposures.
Hobbies, sports, etc.
Presence of water damage at home or work place or visible mold.
Presence of pets.
Age of mattress/bedding.
Age of carpeting at home.
Family History
Allergic diseases have a strong hereditary link.
A parental history of allergic rhinitis increases a 6-year old’s odds of
allergic rhinitis by 1.84 (1.16–2.94).2
A parental history of asthma increases a 6-year old’s odds of asthma by
2.72 (1.19–6.18).2
A maternal history of eczema or atopy increases a 6-month old’s risk of
eczema by 1.58 (1.01–2.47) and 1.99 (1.43–2.78), respectively.3
Food Allergy History
While allergies to food are thought to be much more common in
children, they are also seen in adults in comparable numbers.4
Food allergies are often implicated, (with a prevalence of 3–35%), 4
more often than they are proven to be true (actual prevalence rate of 1–
10.8% after oral food challenge4,5). A thorough history can lead to
appropriate testing, which may further help to confirm or exclude
suspected foods.
Physical Examination
General Appearance
Nasal congestion can lead to a “nasal” or “adenoidal” sounding voice as
well as mouth breathing.
Nasal tissue edema may lead to compression of the draining veins under
the eyes. This can manifest as dark regions under the eyes often called
“allergic shiners.”
Infraorbital folds or Dennie–Morgan lines may be present.
Patients may be observed to rub upward across their nose with the palm
of the hand. This is known as the “allergic salute” and may cause a
transverse line across the lower portion of the nose or nasal crease.
14

Head and Neck
Eyes are commonly noted to have conjunctival injection and watering
due to allergic disease.
Common allergic features of the nose include swollen, edematous
turbinates that are pale blue in color.
Presence of nasal polyps which often appear like clear whitish sacs
hanging from the underside of a turbinate.
Close examination of nasal septum to assess presence of perforations or
deviations.
Tympanic membranes may be dull with the presence of effusion behind
them.
Flexible rhinoscopy is helpful in looking closer at the turbinate
anatomy and vocal cords to assess for the presence of nasal polyps,
sinusitis, or vocal cord dysfunction.
Pulmonary
A thorough lung exam is required, including auscultation of all lung
fields, to listen for any evidence of wheezing or an increased expiratory
phase.
If wheezing cannot be heard during a standard exam, a forced expiratory
maneuver may be helpful.
Skin
Urticaria, or hives, is a maculopapular erythematous eruption in the
cutaneous tissues. These can range from pinpoint size to multiple inches
in diameter and are typically pruritic and blanch with pressure.
Angioedema is edema of the subcutaneous tissue; nonpruritic and
often painful.
Dermatographism is the tendency to form a wheal and flair response
when firm pressure is applied to the skin.
Atopic dermatitis is associated with allergic disease. This presents as
dry, scaly, pruritic patches occurring at typical locations depending on
the age of the patient.

Diagnostic Testing
As with all testing, the results must be interpreted with appropriate clinical
context as to distinguish between sensitization and symptomatic allergy.
Skin Testing
15

This is the most rapid and specific method to test for allergic sensitivity.
Two methods are commonly used, and both are discussed in Chapter 8:
Epicutaneous testing.
Intradermal testing.
In Vitro Tests
In vitro testing (radioallergosorbent test [RAST] and ImmunoCAP) is
designed to screen for the presence of allergen-specific immunoglobulin
E (IgE) in the patient’s serum.
These methods have lower sensitivity and specificity compared to
epicutaneous skin testing but are helpful in instances where skin testing
cannot be performed.
Pulmonary Testing
When a history of breathing difficulties, wheezing, or coughing is
reported, pulmonary function tests are often needed to evaluate for
asthma.
Occasionally a plain chest radiograph is helpful.
When standard pulmonary function tests are normal, but there is still a
high suspicion for asthma, modifications may be needed as follows:
Exercise spirometry.
Bronchoprovocation challenge (i.e., methacholine or mannitol).

2 Basic Immunology Underlying Allergic
Reactions and Inflammation
Jennifer M. Welch and Andrew L. Kau
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definitions
The immune system is responsible for protecting us from bacterial, viral,
fungal, and helminthic pathogens. At the same time, the immune
system must remain tolerant to self-derived antigens, antigens present
on commensal organisms, proteins in food, and antigens present in the
environment.
Autoimmunity results when there is loss of immunologic tolerance to
“self”-antigens.
Allergy is the result of loss of tolerance to environmental or food
antigens (also called allergens).
Immunodeficiency describes the lack of appropriate immune
response to a pathogen that results in recurrent infection.
Components of the immune system include the innate and adaptive
systems.
Innate Immune System
The innate immune system comprises lymphoid-derived cells (e.g.,
neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, etc.), nonlymphoid tissues (e.g., epithelial cells), and proteins capable of
pathogen recognition.
Innate immune cells are able to identify pathogens through pattern
recognition receptors (PRR) that distinguish conserved features of
pathogens,
termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMP).
Adaptive Immune System
Cellular immunity, or cell-mediated immunity, consists of the
response mediated by T cells.
Types of CD4+ T cells are classified by the type of cytokines that they
17

express:
TH1 cells express cytokines such as interferon-γ and help respond to
bacteria, viruses, mycobacteria, and some parasites.
TH2 cells express cytokines like interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13 and
protect from parasitic infections. Inappropriate activation of the TH2
response is associated with allergy.
Tregs (or regulatory T cells) are a subset of T cells that mediate
tolerance to both self-antigens and exogenous antigens. They express
immunoregulatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor
(TGF)-β.
Humoral immunity is mediated by antibodies produced by B cells.
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is present primarily in the serum and helps
protect from viral and bacterial pathogens.
IgA is produced primarily on mucosal surfaces, protects against
pathogens on the mucosal surface, and helps maintain homeostasis
with colonizing microbes.
IgE is thought to protect from parasitic infections and is responsible for
allergic reactions.
TABLE 2.1 HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS

Classification
Gell–Coombs

provides

a

classification
18

for

immune-mediated

hypersensitivity reactions and is divided into four types that are shown in
Table 2-1.

Etiology
Allergy develops when B cells are stimulated to produce IgE antibody to
an environmental or food antigen.
The hygiene hypothesis was formulated to help explain the increase
of allergic disease in developed countries over the past few decades. It
postulates that reduced exposure to infections in early childhood due to
improved living standards, hygiene, and smaller family size results in
less TH1 stimulation and thus an increase in TH2-mediated diseases.
Children living in rural areas with heavy exposure to animals have a
lower prevalence of allergy and asthma compared to children living in
the same area without exposure to animals.1
Antigens that mediate allergic reactions (also called allergens)
comprise a wide variety of molecules, including chemicals and proteins
commonly encountered in a person’s environment. Examples include
dust mite, pollen, and animal dander. Some chemicals are able to elicit
an immune response by binding to self-proteins creating a hapten–
carrier conjugate. This is seen in penicillin allergy.
IgE is a 190 kD immunoglobulin found in minute amounts in the serum.
It circulates as a bivalent antibody, and in pathologic conditions, such as
parasitic infection or severe atopy, these levels can rise in the serum.
IgE is synthesized by B cells that are activated and differentiated into
plasma cells that secrete IgE.
Activation of B cells to make IgE requires IL-4 or IL-13 as a helper
signal that is secreted by TH2 helper CD4+ cells.
Once secreted, IgE binds to Fc receptors on tissue mast cells to
sensitize these cells to allergens.
There are two main types of IgE receptors, a high-affinity Fc
receptor called FcεRI and a low-affinity Fc receptor called FcεRII. The
high-affinity receptor is located on mast cells, basophils, dendritic
cells, eosinophils, and Langerhans cells.
The high-affinity FcεRI receptor is composed of α-chain that
binds to the Fc portion of IgE, a β-chain and two γ-chains that are
involved with intracellular signaling. Eosinophils do not contain the
β-chain.
19

The presence of IgE increases FcεRI expression on the surface of
mast cells. Individuals with higher IgE levels need a smaller trigger
for mast cell activation.
The allergic response is composed of two phases: Immediate and late
phase.
The immediate response occurs when antigen binds to mast cell–
associated IgE (which is bound to the surface of the mast cell by its
high-affinity receptor, Fc εR1). This causes cross-linking of IgE and
stimulates mast cell to release its preformed granules. This reaction
can appear within 5–10 minutes after the administration of antigen
and usually subsides in an hour. The wheal-and-flare response seen
during allergy skin testing (see Chapter 8) is an example of an
immediate allergic response.
The late-phase reaction is mediated by cytokines and lipid
mediators produced by mast cells along with neutrophils, eosinophils,
basophils, and TH2 T cells recruited to the site. The late-phase
reaction occurs 2–4 hours after the immediate response, and the
inflammation is maximal by 24 hours before it subsides. Late-phase
allergic inflammation can be reduced with corticosteroids but not
antihistamines.
Mast cells arise from CD34+ bone marrow progenitors and migrate as
immature cells to peripheral tissue where they mature near blood
vessels, nerves, and beneath epithelia. Mast cells vary in shape and
have round nuclei with cytoplasmic granules containing acidic
proteoglycans that bind to basic dyes.
Activated mast cells are a key component to allergic reactions. They
secrete various mediators that are either stored pre-formed in
granules or synthesized upon activation.
Pre-formed granules consist of biogenic amines (histamine),
neutral proteases (tryptase, chymase, carboxypeptidase), acid
hydrolases, proteoglycans (heparin, chondroitin sulfate), and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α. These are released within minutes of crosslinking of surface-bound IgE.
Histamine acts upon release on the four different histamine
receptors. Its actions are short lived, because it is rapidly removed
from the extracellular space.
Through the H1 receptor, histamine causes smooth muscle
20

contraction
(bronchospasm),
pruritus,
vasodilation,
and
vasopermeability. This creates the wheal- and-flare response on
the skin.
The H2 receptor is responsible for gastric acid secretion and
increased mucus production in the airways.
The H3 receptor is found in the nervous system and controls the
release of histamine and other neurotransmitters.
The H4 receptor aids in chemotaxis of mast cells.
Tryptase is found only in mast cells and is a marker of mast
cell activation. Tryptase cleaves fibrinogen and activates
collagenase causing tissue damage. Tryptase is found in two forms,
α-tryptase and β-tryptase.
α-Tryptase is constitutively secreted. Levels are elevated in the
disease mastocytosis.
β-Tryptase is released upon mast cell degranulation. It is stabilized
by heparin. Blood level peak 30 minutes after anaphylactic reaction
but may remain above baseline level for 6–12 hours after inciting
event.
Synthesized mediators are made by mast cells minutes to hours
after activation and include arachidonic acid metabolites and
cytokines.
Lipid metabolites are created from arachidonic acid via the
cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase pathways and are mediators in
allergic reactions.
Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is synthesized through the
cyclooxygenase pathway. PGD 2 acts on smooth muscle cells to
mediate vasodilatation and bronchoconstriction. It also promotes
neutrophil chemotaxis.
Leukotrienes are created via the lipoxygenase pathways.
Leukotriene C4 (LTC 4) is made by mucosal mast cells and is
degraded to LTD 4 and LTE 4. These are important mediators of
asthmatic bronchoconstriction. In addition, they also increase
vascular permeability and mucus secretion.
Platelet-activating factor (PAF) causes bronchoconstriction,
vascular permeability, relaxes vascular smooth muscle, and can
activate leukocytes. PAF has a short half life as it is rapidly
21

destroyed. It received its name as it causes rabbit platelet
aggregation.
Mast cell synthesized cytokines that contribute to allergic
inflammation include the following:
IL-3 induces mast cell proliferation.
IL-4 and IL-13 promote IgE isotype switching and mucus secretion.
IL-5 activates and induces eosinophil proliferation.
IL-6 promotes B-cell differentiation.
TNF-α activates endothelial expression of adhesion molecules that
aid in leukocyte recruitment.
Mast cells can be stimulated to release their mediators by:
Allergens binding to surface IgE on mast cells causing cross-linking.
Cross-linking describes the process of simultaneous engagement of
multiple IgE Fc receptors necessary for signaling.
Antibody binding to IgE or FcεR1 receptor causing cross-linking.
Histamine releasing factors that include chemokines such as
macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1, complement factors C3a
and C5a, and neuropeptides like substance P.
Drugs (morphine, codeine) and IV contrast dye.
Physical stimuli such as pressure, heat, cold, and sunlight.
Basophils are a blood granulocyte with a similar function and structure
to mast cells.
Their name is derived from the ability of their granules to bind to basic
dye. Basophils can synthesize many of the same mediators as mast
cells.
Basophils also express FcεR1 receptor and can be activated by antigen
binding to IgE.
Basophils make up less than 1% of blood leukocytes. They are
normally not present in tissue, but may be recruited to sites of
inflammation.
Eosinophils are a blood granulocyte that is commonly involved in
allergic diseases.
Eosinophil maturation is promoted by granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-3, and IL-5. They are normally seen in
peripheral tissue and are recruited to sites of inflammation mainly in
the late-phase reaction.
Their granules contain basic proteins that bind to acidic dye.
22

Eosinophils have receptors for IgG, IgA, and IgE. Once activated,
eosinophils produce major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein,
and eosinophil peroxidase, which are toxic to bacteria, helminths, and
normal tissue. They can also release lipid mediators that aid in the
allergic response.

3 Allergic Rhinitis and Sinusitis
K. Lindsey B. McMullan

RHINITIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
One of the most common chronic diseases, allergic rhinitis (AR) is
characterized by rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, postnasal drainage,
nasopharyngeal itching, and sneezing.
AR symptoms are caused by environmental allergens.
The prevalence of AR is increasing.
Rhinitis includes AR, nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), and nonallergic rhinitis
with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES).

Definition
AR is allergen-driven mucosal inflammation.
AR must contain one or more of the following symptoms:1
Nasal congestion
Sneezing
Itching
Rhinorrhea
Postnasal drip
For rhinitis to be classified as allergic, the patient must have evidence
of immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization to an allergen by skin
testing or radioallergosorbent test (RAST).
Other associated symptoms include palatal pruritus, pruritus of the ear
canals, ocular pruritus and watering, and some patients have anosmia or
reduced sense of smell.
Nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) is not mediated by IgE.
There is nasal mucosal inflammation.
Symptoms are similar to AR usually without itching.
No sensitization to allergens is demonstrated.
NARES is NAR with eosinophilia syndrome.
24

Symptoms are very similar or identical to AR.
There is no IgE sensitization to allergen.
Large numbers of eosinophils are present on nasal smear (may be
>20%).
Patients tend to be middle-aged and often have paroxysmal
exacerbations.
Patients are at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea.1

Classification
Allergic rhinitis can be classified into seasonal, perennial, and
episodic.
Seasonal AR: Patients have signs and symptoms of AR occurring in
only one or more seasons, but not year round. They are sensitized to
seasonal allergens such as trees, grasses, or weeds.
Perennial AR: Patients have signs and symptoms of AR throughout
the year, though they may also have seasonal exacerbations if they
are sensitized to seasonal allergens.
Allergens typically include dust mites, molds, pet dander, or insects.
Symptoms must be present >2 hours/day, >9 months out of the
year.
Episodic AR: Patients have signs and symptoms of AR to allergens
they are sensitized to, but which are not present regularly in their
environment. An example would be a patient who has symptoms
when visiting a friend who has a cat, but the patient does not come
into daily contact with the cat.1
Mixed rhinitis: Patients have a combination of AR and NAR.

Epidemiology
AR affects between 10 and 30% of all adults.1
Mixed rhinitis affects 44–87% of patients with rhinitis.1,2
In 2002, the financial burden in the US (direct and indirect costs) was
estimated at $11.58 billion.1
Prevalence ranges from 3 to 19%.
80% of AR develops before age 20.
Equal male and female distribution among adults.
Adults have a higher prevalence of perennial AR and children have a
higher prevalence of seasonal AR.
25

Etiology
Allergens: Sensitization to aeroallergens may occur even in the first 2
years of life.1
Anatomic causes of rhinitis include septal deviation, foreign bodies,
adenoid hypertrophy, choanal atresia, and tumors.

Pathophysiology
AR is caused by specific IgE-mediated reaction to environmental
allergens.
Mast cells and basophils located on the superficial mucosa of the
respiratory tract have specific IgE bound to its cell membrane. When
allergens bind and cross-link the IgE, cellular degranulation occurs.
Mast cells degranulate and cause release of pre-formed mediators and
newly synthesized mediators that cause the allergic reaction.2
Preformed mediators include histamine, tryptase, chymase,
kininogenase, heparin, and other enzymes.
Newly formed mediators include prostaglandins, leukotriene (LT) C4,
LTD4, and LTE4.
Nasal congestion is typically a late-phase response.
Eosinophils release mediators causing tissue damage in the late phase
response.1
Priming occurs with prolonged allergen exposure resulting in repeated
late-phase responses even with very small exposures—inflammatory
mediators continue to be released and symptom resolution may lag
behind the decrease in pollen.1
NAR causes include hormonal, vasomotor, and medication-induced.

Risk Factors
Family history of atopy.
Serum IgE >100 IU/mL before age 6.
Higher socioeconomic status.
Presence of a positive skin prick test.1
First-born children are more likely to have AR.
Environmental risk factors include smoke exposure and allergen
exposure in infancy.

DIAGNOSIS
26

Clinical Presentation
Patients typically present with sneezing, rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, nasal
itching, and congestion.1
Other symptoms include itching of palate, conjunctiva, throat, Eustachian
tubes, and middle ear.
Ear fullness and popping, as well as pressure over cheeks and forehead
may be reported.
Occasionally, chronic cough may be the presenting symptom.
Often patients can associate the onset of symptoms to a particular
trigger.
Common comorbidities include:1
Asthma.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Nasal obstruction from severe nasal septal deviation.
Inferior turbinate hypertrophy.
Adenoidal hypertrophy.
Refractory sinusitis.
Allergic conjunctivitis.
History
History is the most important step in diagnosis.
Important elements of the history:
Frequency of symptoms.
Severity of symptoms (both past and present).
Relationship to past symptoms.
Length of time symptoms appear after triggers.
Triggers may be multiple.
Assess whether the symptoms occur at home and/or work on vacation.
Assessment of home environmental conditions should include:
Water damage or mold.
Pets.
Carpet.
Age of pillow and mattress, type of fillers.
What other irritants are nearby (e.g., farms, woods, and vacant lots)?
Are heat and air conditioning central?
Use of fireplace or humidifiers.
Are symptoms exacerbated by dusting or vacuuming the house?
27

Medications specifically inquire about:
Does the patient take aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), oral contraceptives, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)inhibitors, or β-blockers?
What are current and past medications used to treat AR?
Family history of atopic disease should be determined.
Quality of life should be assessed.
Ask about fatigue, learning and attention problems, and sleep
disturbance.
Ask about time missed from work or school.
Effect on quality of life is often under-recognized and inadequately
treated.1
Rhinorrhea should be described as predominately clear. Persistent,
colored rhinorrhea may indicate sinus disease.
Time frame of exacerbations should be established.
Are symptoms always worse on awakening?
Are there particular seasons that are worse?
Are symptoms completely gone during portions of the year?
Physical Examination
A thorough examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat should
be performed.
Note if findings are unilateral or bilateral.
Common findings in AR include:
Allergic salute is a crease across the bridge of the nose and is a
result of rubbing the nose.
Dennie’s lines are infraorbital creases.
Conjunctivitis may be present in those with ocular symptoms.
Allergic shiners are infraorbital hyperpigmentation secondary to
nasal congestion.
Turbinates are often edematous and pale. They may sometimes
appear blue.
Cobblestoning in the posterior oropharynx indicates post-nasal
drainage.
Ears should be evaluated for otitis or Eustachian tube dysfunction.
It should be noted whether septal deviation or nasal polyps are
present.
Care should be taken to ensure there is no sinusitis (see below).
28

Heart and lung examination should be performed. Note whether
wheezing is heard on lung examination.
The skin should be examined for signs of atopic dermatitis.
If septal perforation is present, differential diagnosis includes:
Inappropriate use of nasal medications.
Adverse effects of other nasal medications.
Intranasal narcotic abuse.
Previous surgery.
Systemic granulomatous disease.

Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of rhinitis is presented in Table 3-1.
TABLE 3.1 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR RHINITIS

Vasomotor rhinitis:
This is a type of NAR in which excessive vasomotor activity leads to
chronic nasal congestion.
The mechanism is not completely known.
Etiologies include odors, alcohol, spicy foods, emotions,
temperature change, and bright lights.
Drug-induced rhinitis:
Common offenders include ACE-inhibitors, β-blockers, ASA, NSAIDs,
oral contraceptives, phosphodiesterase-5-selective inhibitors, α29

receptor antagonists, and cocaine.
Hormonal rhinitis:
A type of NAR in which hormone altering events induce nasal
obstruction and hypersecretion.
Events include hypothyroidism, oral contraceptive use, and
pregnancy.
For pregnant women, symptoms usually appear during the second
trimester but disappear after delivery.
Rhinitis medicamentosa:
Occurs from prolonged use of intranasal decongestants.
Rebound congestion occurs and later nasal hypertrophy. This appears
as beefy, red mucosa.
Rhinitis medicamentosa will resolve on discontinuation of the agent.
Nasal polyps are outgrowths from the nasal passages.
Polyps typically start at the lateral wall and appear smooth, round,
pale, and gelatinous.
Growth likely occurs from eosinophil-associated growth factors found
in the eosinophils and immunoglobulins they contain.
The possibility of cystic fibrosis should be entertained if nasal polyps
are found in children.
Anatomic abnormalities should be considered, particularly in difficultto-treat rhinitis.
If cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is suspected, evaluate with
β-transferrin in nasal secretions.1

Diagnostic Testing
Skin testing and RAST testing are used to determine allergen
sensitization. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 8.
Purposes of serum IgE testing are three-fold: To provide evidence of
allergic basis, to confirm suspected allergens, and to determine
suspected sensitivity for avoidance measures and/or immunotherapy.1
Epicutaneous skin testing is preferred.
Testing to local trees, weeds, and grasses is usually performed. Testing
is also usually performed to molds and perennial allergens.
Laboratories
RAST testing is usually used only if skin testing is unable to be
performed.
30

The average sensitivity of serum-specific IgE assays is only 70–75%.1
Reasons for skin testing might be contraindicated include use of
antihistamines, extensive skin disease, and uncooperative patients who
are not able to sit still for 15–20 minutes.
Serum IgE and IgG subclasses are not used as diagnostic tools for AR.
Imaging
If anatomic abnormality or chronic sinusitis is suspected, a CT scan may be
helpful.
Diagnostic Procedures
Rhinoscopy may be used to:
Assess nasal passage structure.
Evaluate for nasal polyps and sinusitis.
Evaluate vocal chords.
Nasal provocation testing is rarely performed and is used primarily for
research purposes to confirm sensitivity to allergen.1

TREATMENT
When treatment with one class fails despite compliance, substitution of
another class should be considered.
If AR is mild, single-agent therapy or combination therapy may be used
in addition to avoidance measures.
For all intranasal preparations, patients should be instructed to spray
medication away from the septum to avoid irritation and perforation.

Medications
First Line
Intranasal steroids are the mainstay of therapy.
They are considered superior to all other medication choices for AR
because they help prevent both early and late-phase response.
Steroids for intranasal use include beclomethasone, budesonide,
flunisolide, fluticasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, mometasone,
triamcinolone, and ciclesonide.
Typical adult dose is two sprays in each nostril daily.
Patients with seasonal AR should start intranasal steroids at least 1
week before the onset of pollen season.
31

May be used on an as needed basis but this is not as effective as daily
use.
Systemic side effects are minimal.
Patients should be instructed on their proper use to prevent nasal
septum trauma.
Nasal examination in patients on nasal steroids should evaluate for
complications such as septal ulceration and perforation (rare).
Epistaxis may occur, and if frequent, discontinuation of the nasal
steroid should be considered.
Oral antihistamines are also commonly used.3
They reduce symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, sneezing, ocular
pruritus, and tearing.
They are less effective at reducing nasal congestion.
Nonsedating second-generation antihistamines include loratadine,
desloratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine, and levocetirizine.
First-generation antihistamines are not generally used for AR
secondary
to
their
sedating
properties.
These
include
chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, doxepin, and hydroxyzine.
Nasal antihistamines:
These may be as effective or superior to oral second-generation
antihistamines.1
They are generally less effective than intranasal steroids.
Examples include azelastine and olopatadine.
Second Line
Montelukast is approved for seasonal and perennial AR.
Intranasal cromolyn:1,3
Inhibits mast cell degranulation.
Onset of action is 4–7 days.
Effective for episodic AR.
Must be used four times daily for maximal effect.
Has a good safety profile.
Is not as efficacious as nasal steroids or nasal antihistamines.
Intranasal anticholinergics (ipratropium):1,3
Reduces rhinorrhea.
Not useful for nasal congestion.
Side effects include epistaxis and nasal dryness.
Use with caution in patients with glaucoma or prostate hypertrophy.
32

Nasal decongestants:
Cause vasoconstriction and improve nasal edema, but no actual effect
on the antigen-provoked nasal response.1
Should not be used as single agent.3
Continuous use should be limited to <5 days otherwise may lead to
rhinitis medicamentosa.3
Examples are oxymetazoline and phenylephrine.
Oral decongestants:
Are occasionally useful in selected patients.
Most products generally contain phenylephrine.
Chronic use of these agents is not recommended.3
Oral steroids:
Are rarely indicated in AR secondary to systemic side effects.
For severe, intractable nasal symptoms or if nasal polyps are present,
a 5- to 7-day course may be considered.
Immunotherapy (see Chapter 21):
Immunotherapy may be used for treatment of perennial and seasonal
rhinitis when a specific allergen has been identified.
Successful approximately 80% of the time.
Considered unsuccessful if the patient has no relief from symptoms
after 1 year of maintenance therapy.
Current recommendations suggest 3–5 years of therapy.

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Environmental modification:
Dust mite avoidance:
Dust mite proof covers for mattresses and pillows are designed to
help decrease the amount of dust mites and other allergens.
Vacuum with a HEPA filter.1
Wash linens in hot water.
Indoor humidity should be kept <50% to avoid growth of fungi and
dust mites.1
Hard surface flooring is preferable
Avoid contact with pets. For cat allergen, the cat may be confined to a
HEPA-filtered room.1
Pollen counts are highest on sunny, windy days with lower humidity.
Close windows and doors during pollen season.
33

Performing outdoor activity in the evening when pollen counts are
lower.
Mold exposure should be avoided at home.
To eliminate fungi, sources of moisture should be eliminated
initially.
Porous surfaces should be replaced.
Eliminate cockroaches (much easier said than done).
Wear a HEPA and pollen-proof face mask (e.g., N95) when allergens
cannot be avoided.
Nasal saline irrigations may help symptoms of chronic rhinitis.1,4

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Pregnancy
Symptoms of AR increase in one-third of pregnant patients.1
Both first- and second-generation antihistamines may be used. Cetirizine
is a pregnancy class B medication.
Oral decongestants should be avoided, particularly in the first trimester.
Other medications that may be used include intranasal steroids
(budesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone propionate, class B),
montelukast (class B), and sodium cromolyn (class B).
Immunotherapy may be continued without dose escalation during
pregnancy, but immunotherapy should not be initiated during
pregnancy.

Elderly Patients
Age-related changes such as cholinergic hyperactivity, anatomic
changes, or concomitant medication use may affect rhinitis.
Allergy is not a common cause of new onset rhinitis in persons >65
years.2
Intranasal steroids and ipratropium may be used safely.
If antihistamines are used, nonsedating agents should be chosen.2

COMPLICATIONS
Medical complications of improperly or untreated
rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and rhinitis medicamentosa.1
34

AR

include

Psychological impact can include depression, anxiety, low self-esteem,
and shyness.
Septal irritation or perforation may occur as a complication of incorrect
nasal steroid use.

REFERRAL
There are multiple indications for referral to an allergist-immunologist
(Table 3-2).
Consultation with an allergist-immunologist has been demonstrated to
improve outcomes such as compliance, quality of life, and patient
satisfaction.1
Patients that should be referred to an otolaryngologist for surgical
management include:1
Nasal obstruction from severe nasal septal deviation (septoplasty is
preferred over submucosal resection and has a high reported success
rate).
Inferior turbinate hypertrophy requiring reduction in patients who have
failed medical therapy.
TABLE 3.2 WHEN TO REFER TO AN ALLERGIST

Adenoid hypertrophy (adenoidectomy).
Nasal polyps which require removal (polypectomy).
35

Patients with complications from refractory rhinosinusitis (functional
endoscopic sinus surgery).

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Clinical improvement is a better measure for appropriate environmental
control than the amount of allergen concentration.1
Patients should be assessed 2–4 weeks after initiation of therapy.5
Single-agent therapy with intranasal steroids or combination therapy
with intranasal steroids and oral antihistamines is usually a good
starting point.
Oral antihistamines should be tried before leukotriene inhibitors.3
Intranasal antihistamines and leukotrienes are more appropriate for
those with seasonal AR.3
If one medication regimen does not seem to be effective, addition of
an agent or change to a different class may be warranted.

SINUSITIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Normal sinus function requires:
All sinus ostia must be patent.
Normal mucociliary function.
Normal local and systemic immune function.2
Rhinitis and sinusitis often coexist and rhinitis often precedes sinusitis.2,6

Definition
Sinusitis is simply defined as inflammation of one or more of the
paranasal sinuses.

Classification
Sinusitis is classified as acute, chronic, or recurrent.
No consensus standards exist for defining chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)
versus acute rhinosinusitis (ARS).
ARS is generally defined as symptoms for ≤1 month.
Nasal drainage must be purulent.2
36

Of note, acute sinusitis may last up to 12 weeks per episode.6
CRS consists of inflammation of the nasal passages lasting 12 weeks at
a minimum despite medical management.2
Recurrent sinusitis is characterized by >4 episodes of acute sinusitis
per year. 6 Patients with recurrent sinusitis may need evaluation for
immunodeficiency.

Epidemiology
Ninety to ninety-eight percent of episodes of sinusitis are preceded by an
acute viral upper respiratory infection.1
About 31 million people in the US have rhinosinusitis annually.2
Prevalence is estimated at 10–30% in Europe and 15% in America.6
Viral upper respiratory infections become bacterial
rhinosinusitis only in 0.5–2% of the population.2
Chronic sinusitis is associated with AR in 60% of adults.2
Increasing resistance to first-line therapies is well known and includes βlactamase production (gram-negative organisms) and alterations in
penicillin-binding proteins (gram-positive organisms).
More than one-third of Haemophilus influenza strains and virtually all
Moraxella catarrhalis strains are penicillin resistant.

Etiology
ARS is usually infectious, viral, bacterial, or fungal.2
Viruses are the most common cause of acute sinusitis.
The most common bacterial etiologies in acute sinusitis are the
following:
Streptococcus pneumoniae
H. influenza
M. catarrhalis
Staphylococcus aureus,
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and
anaerobic bacteria are more common in CRS, but CRS is more often
inflammatory.2
S. aureus is increasing in prevalence in sinusitis patients with nasal
polyps.2
Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently occurs in patients with cystic
fibrosis.
Sinusitis is less commonly a manifestation of systemic illness.
37

Pathophysiology
Acute sinusitis often develops when the sinus ostia are obstructed
leading to infection.
Conditions that disrupt mucociliary clearance of secretions and
promote ostial obstruction predispose patients to sinusitis including:
Rhinitis:
Ostial narrowing secondary to mucosal inflammation due to a viral
infection.
Chronic mucosal changes from allergic disease.
Nasal polyps.
Anatomic abnormalities.
Foreign bodies.
Problems with mucociliary transport:
Cystic fibrosis.
Primary ciliary dyskinesia.
Viral infections and other causes of inflammation may also result in
ciliary dysfunction.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is usually entirely clinical and the
differentiation between viral and bacterial infections can be difficult.
Multiple studies regarding the utility of symptoms and signs for
diagnosing acute sinusitis have sometimes reached differing conclusions.
A few have used the true gold standard (i.e., sinus puncture and
culture), but more have used a surrogate standard (e.g., sinus plain
films and CT). Radiography cannot differentiate viral from bacterial
sinusitis.
ARS symptoms within the first 7–10 days of illness typically indicate a
viral rhinosinusitis.2
Regarding ARS, The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and
Immunology (AAAAI) states the following (strength of recommendation
level C):7
Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis may be suspected when an upper
respiratory tract infection last longer than 10–14 days.
Bacterial infection is more likely with a history of persistent purulent
38

rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, and facial pain.
The prominent symptoms of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are nasal
congestion, purulent rhinorrhea, facial-dental pain, postnasal
drainage, headache, and cough.
Signs of ARS include sinus tenderness, purulent nasal discharge,
erythematous mucosa, pharyngeal secretions, and periorbital edema.
The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery
guideline indicates that ARS may be diagnosed by the presence of one
or both of the following:8
Up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal discharge accompanied by nasal
obstruction.
Facial pain-pressure-fullness.
Acute bacterial (rather than viral) rhinosinusitis is diagnosed when:
Symptoms or signs persist ≥10 days after the onset of upper
respiratory symptoms or
Symptoms or signs worsen within 10 days after an initial
improvement.
The American College of Physicians’ clinical practice guideline advises
the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be made in
those who:9
Have symptoms lasting ≥7 days and
Have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth and
Purulent nasal secretions.
Two or more of the following symptoms when present are helpful when
making the diagnosis of CRS in the setting of documented mucosal
inflammation:2
Mucopurulent nasal drainage (anterior and/or posterior).
Nasal obstruction or blockage.
Facial pain, pressure, and/or fullness.
Decreased sense of smell.
TABLE 3.3 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR SINUSITIS

39

Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis for rhinosinusitis is presented in Table 3-3.
Allergic fungal sinusitis:
Rare cause of chronic sinusitis.
The hallmark feature is the presence of sinus opacification due to
accumulation of “allergic mucin” that is thick, inspissated secretions
heavily laden with eosinophils, Charcot–Leyden crystals, and fungal
hyphae.
Diagnosis usually requires surgery to establish.2
Infectious fungal sinusitis:
More likely to be seen in immunocompromised patients.
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common cause of fungal sinusitis.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
If immunodeficiency is suspected, obtain a complete blood count (CBC)
with differential and quantitative immunoglobulin levels. Otherwise blood
tests are of little use.
Imaging
Imaging to confirm the diagnosis of acute uncomplicated rhinosinusitis is
usually not necessary.2,7–9
40

Radiography cannot readily differentiate viral from bacterial acute
sinusitis.
The limited sinus CT has become the most widely used radiographic
study for the diagnosis of sinusitis.
It is obtained in the coronal projection with cuts through the frontal
sinus, anterior ethmoid/maxillary sinuses, and posterior ethmoid and
sphenoid sinuses.
Allows for assessment of patency of the osteomeatal unit, the critical
confluence of drainage from the maxillary and anterior ethmoid
sinuses.
Imaging studies with CT usually reveal mucosal thickening and ostial
plugging if the sinusitis is chronic.
CT is the test of choice for chronic sinusitis.2
MRI is useful for evaluating allergic or infectious fungal sinusitis to rule
out soft tissue extension.
It is not good for evaluating mucosal thickening or bony deformities.
Should not be used as an initial imaging method.
Diagnostic Procedures
Skin prick testing evaluate for underlying AR may be performed.2
Edoscopically directed middle meatus cultures may be helpful in
adults.1
Rhinoscopy with the flexible fiber optic rhinoscope can help determine
nasal and sinus anatomy.
Biopsy is indicated if there is suspicion of a tumor or vasculitis. A biopsy
may also be helpful to confirm the presence of invasive fungal infection.
Ciliary function testing is indicated in the setting of recurrent otitis,
sinusitis, and pneumonia with bronchiectasis (primary ciliary dyskinesia
or Kartagener’s syndrome).
It is possible to do ciliary visual assessments, but a practical approach
in the office setting is the saccharine test.
Electron microscopy of nasal mucosal biopsy is the only way to
document abnormal cilia structure.
Nasal cytology:
Presence of eosinophils may indicate AR, NARES, aspirin sensitivity, or
nasal polyps.
Neutrophils are more indicative of infection.

41

TREATMENT
Most cases of ARS are caused by viruses and are expected to
significantly improve without antibiotic treatment within 10–14 days.
Treatment should, therefore, be symptomatic for those without clinical
signs suggestive of a bacterial infection.7
Trials of the efficacy of antibiotics in ARS have been of variable quality
and differing outcome measures. Most of the randomized trials did not
definitively enroll only subjects with bacterial infections. Nonetheless,
taken together, there does appear to be a modest benefit from
antibiotic treatment. Of significant note, many patients in the
control/placebo groups did spontaneously improve (on average 80%
improved vs. 90% with antibiotics).10
Uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis may be treated with or
without antibiotics.2,8–10
Patients without severe or prolonged symptoms may be managed
initially with symptomatic treatment alone and followed for
resolution. Worsening of symptoms during this time should prompt a
reconsideration of antibiotic therapy.
Those with initially severe symptoms or those with symptoms for >7
days after diagnosis are typically treated with antibiotics.
Individual clinical judgment should be exercised when making the
decision to forgo or prescribe antibiotic therapy.
Appropriate first-line antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bacterial
rhinosinusitis include amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and
azithromycin for 10–14 days.2,7–11 Significant differences between
groups of antibiotics, including newer more expensive ones, have not
been demonstrated.8,10–12
The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy is unclear.7
Alternative antibiotic therapy should be considered in patients who
worsen or do not improve during the initial 7 days of therapy. 2,7,8,11
Reasonable second-line choices include high-dose amoxicillin–
clavulanate, and oral fluoroquinolones and second- or third-generation
cephalosporins.
While evidence is somewhat limited, the addition of intranasal steroids
may have modest positive benefit in the treatment of ARS.2,7,13
There are no controlled trials of systemic steroids, and these are not
routinely recommended.
42

Analgesics should be prescribed to those with significant pain.8
Data to support the use of decongestants, antihistamines,
mucolytics/expectorants, and sinus irrigation are lacking, but they are at
least theoretically beneficial and often recommended.2,7
The treatment of CRS (i.e., ≥12 weeks), which is an inflammatory
condition often accompanied by infection, is a more complicated matter.
It may be associated with nasal polyposis or allergic fungal
rhinosinusitis, or neither. Multicomponent treatment is necessary.
Intranasal steroids are generally recommended for all patients.2,14
Oral steroids are sometimes used for severe symptoms.
Data regarding the use of antimicrobials in CRS are sparse; however,
the potential for an infectious contribution to chronic inflammation
seems clear. When there is an evidence of purulence, most clinician
will treat with an antibiotic. On the basis of microbiologic studies,
amoxicillin–clavulanate, clindamycin, or an oral fluoroquinolone are
reasonable choices.2,7,15 Duration of treatment is unclear, but 3
weeks is often recommended.
Nasal irrigation is frequently recommended.16
Patients with AR should be maximally treated as needed.
Surgical polypectomy may be indicated for severe polyposis.
Functional endoscopic sinus surgery is frequently done for refractory
CRS.

COMPLICATIONS
Rare but dangerous complications may occur when sinus disease extends
outside of the sinus cavity. These include orbital cellulitis, cavernous
vein thrombosis, brain abscess, meningitis, osteomyelitis, oral-antral
fistula, and mucocele.2,6
It should be remembered that Clostridium difficile colitis and candidiasis
can be a complication of prolonged antibiotic therapy.

REFERRAL
Indications for referral to an ENT surgeon are as follows:1,2,6
Evidence of anatomic defects by CT or physical examination, including
foreign bodies, and tumors.
Nasal polyps that obstruct sinus drainage despite medical treatment.
43

Persistent sinusitis despite aggressive medical management.
Sinus condition requiring biopsy.
Sinusitis complicated by extension into local structures.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Symptoms are expected to resolve between episodes of ARS.
If symptoms continue after one course of antibiotics, an alternative
antibiotic may be considered.
If symptoms have not resolved after multiple courses of antibiotics, CT
scan should be performed, and further workup for predisposing
conditions should be performed.

4 Asthma
Natalie Miller and Sarena Sawlani
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways
associated with airway hyperresponsiveness, which leads to
recurrent wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing.1
Variable, reversible airflow obstruction is a hallmark of asthma.
Reversibility can either be spontaneous or with treatment.
Asthma exacerbations are periods of worsening symptom between
periods of relative symptom stability.
Most childhood asthma is the result of atopic sensitization and is
considered part of the allergic diathesis.
Adult-onset asthma can not only be part of the spectrum of atopy but
can also result from other etiologies, such as occupational exposures.

Classification
Asthma classification is based on symptom severity at diagnosis (Table 41), control at follow-up visits and severity/frequency of exacerbations
(Table 4-2 ) (e.g., “moderate persistent asthma currently well
controlled”).2

Epidemiology
As of 2005, an estimated 32.6 million Americans (11.2% total
population) have a diagnosis of asthma sometime during their lifetime.1
Asthma prevalence has increased from 7.3 to 8.2% from 2001 to 2009.3
On the basis of 2004 estimate, approximately 300 million people of all
ages suffered from asthma. By 2025, it is also expected that over 400
million people will suffer from the disease per the Global Initiative for
Asthma (GINA).4
A correlation has been noted between the increase of asthma
prevalence with atopic sensitization, which can be seen by the
46

increase of allergic rhinitis and eczema.4,5
Asthma is a worldwide disorder but more common in developed
countries (e.g., Australia, New Zealand, US, Ireland, UK).
The hygiene hypothesis (see Chapter 2) suggests that the rising
prevalence of asthma in developed countries is due to the overall
decrease in viral and bacterial infections, which increase activation of
Th2 lymphocytes, which is associated with asthma and atopy. Also,
the increased use of antibiotic in children may alter the normal gut
flora in infants and increase the Th2 immune response.
Multiple studies have hypothesized that specific air pollutants have
been linked to asthma.6,7
TABLE 4.1 CLASSIFICATION OF ASTHMA SEVERITYA

TABLE 4.2 CLASSIFICATION OF ASTHMA CONTROLA

47

Exposure to nitrogen dioxide along with living in close proximity
(<50 m distance) to a major road has been associated with higher
rates of asthma risk and incidents.8
Chronic exposure to nitrogen dioxide from indoor gas stoves may be
associated with increase in asthma symptoms found in lower
socioeconomic groups.9
Diesel fuel exhaust particles have also been hypothesized to be
taken up by epithelial cells in the airway leading to allergic immune
responses.10
Socioeconomic considerations:
A higher rate of asthma prevalence has been seen in blacks than in
whites.11
In people living in poverty and the inner city, increased asthma
prevalence and mortality may be associated with the lack of
adherence to asthma treatment complicated by a decreased or lack of
access to medical care or insurance.12
Other risk factors include low birth weight secondary to maternal
tobacco use and tobacco exposure in the home.
In 2004, there were nearly half a million hospitalizations; 190,000 of
these were below age 15. Blacks were 3.4 times more likely than
whites to be hospitalized.
Mortality from asthma is relatively rare and has declined since 1999 to
four deaths per million.
The US initially had an increase in the annual death rate between the
48

years 1982 and 1995. However, since then, the death rate has
decreased.11
Deaths are higher in blacks, in all age groups, compared to whites.
Risk factors for fatal asthma in patients include major and minor risk
factors.
Major risk factors include:
A recent history of poorly controlled asthma (e.g., increase in daily
and/or nocturnal awakening due to shortness of breath or
wheezing, increased use of β2-agonist, and variation of peak flow
results).
A history of a near fatal episode of asthma (intensive care unit
admission and/or requirement of intubation previously).
Minor risk factors include aeroallergen exposure, aspirin/nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) exposure, cigarette smoke, illicit drug
use, genetic factors, multiple emergency department visits or
admissions
for
asthma,
multiple
oral
glucocorticosteroid
requirements, and poor medical adherence.

Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of asthma is complex and results from a combination
of factors including genetic, environmental, immunologic, and
developmental factors. Furthermore, asthma is likely a
heterogeneous disease with multiple pathways leading to airway
hyperresponsiveness. Nevertheless, airway narrowing causing
obstruction of airflow results in bronchoconstriction, which is the
dominant physiologic event leading to clinical symptoms.13
Airway inflammation is an important factor predisposing to
bronchoconstriction.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated inflammation is caused by antigenmediated crosslinking of IgE on the surface of mast cells resulting in
the release of inflammatory mediators (see Chapter 2).
Non–IgE-mediated inflammation in asthma is less well understood but
ultimately results in airway edema and inflammation. There are
multiple subtypes defined including aspirin-sensitive asthma and
neutrophilic asthma.
Airway diameter is decreased by edema, inflammation, increase in
mucous secretion (which, in turn, can lead to mucous plugging), and
49

structural changes.
Airway
hyperresponsiveness
can result
from
exaggerated
bronchoconstriction due to inflammation, neuroregulatory dysfunction,
and structural changes. Bronchoconstriction can be triggered in response
to various stimuli including tobacco smoke, weather changes, or
emotions.
Permanent structural changes from chronic inflammation result in
progressive loss of lung function that is not completely reversible by
therapy. Thickening of the sub-basement membrane, subepithelial
fibrosis, airway smooth muscle hypertrophy, mucous gland hypertrophy,
and hypersecretion all contribute to these changes.

Risk Factors
Atopy: Epidemiologic studies consistently show an association between
atopic sensitization and asthma, but the causal relationship is complex.1
Genetics: A combination of genetic susceptibility and an appropriate
environmental stimulus causes asthma. Genome-wide association
studies have identified over 100 genes associated with asthma. The
studies suggest that a complex interaction of genes combined with
environmental exposure(s) results in asthma.
Parental diagnosis of asthma increases the risk of asthma in an
offspring.
Twin studies show higher concordance rates in monozygotic twins.
Gender: In early childhood, male children are at a greater risk for
developing asthma, while in adolescents and adulthood females are at
greater risk.
Prematurity has been associated with the development of symptoms
consistent with asthma, both with and without a history of neonatal
respiratory distress, but the mechanism and its involvement with other
asthma risk factors are not known.
Passive tobacco smoke exposure: In utero exposure to tobacco
smoke affects airway responsiveness after birth. Children exposed to
secondhand smoke have an increased frequency of wheezing and
increased risk of more severe lower respiratory tract infection during the
first year of life.
Respiratory infections, especially respiratory syncytial virus and
parainfluenza, have been associated with childhood wheezing. While
50

follow-up studies are suggestive of a relationship with developing
asthma, definitive evidence is still lacking. Respiratory infections are
associated with asthma exacerbations.
The Asthma predictive index was established from the evaluation of
risk factor for persistent asthma and predicts development of persistent
asthma after 6 years of age.2
Recurrent wheezing in children 3 years of age or younger, and
One major criterion (parental asthma or physician diagnosed eczema
in patient) or
Two minor criteria (eosinophilia >4%, wheezing without colds, allergic
rhinitis)

Prevention
Identify precipitating factors such as exposure to allergens, irritants,
and viruses, and limiting exposure to these triggering factors is key to
preventing asthma exacerbations.2
Treatment of other comorbidities that can worsen asthma should be
optimized to reduce morbidity from asthma (e.g., conditions such as
allergic rhinitis, sleep apnea, sinusitis, and gastroesophageal reflux
disease).
Smoking cessation must be a priority for any individual with asthma.

Associated Conditions
Atopic diseases, including food allergy, eczema, and allergic rhinitis, are
frequently comorbid with asthma.
The atopic march denotes the successive development of food allergy,
eczema, allergic rhinitis, and asthma in childhood.
Samter’s triad is the co-occurrence of asthma, nasal polyps, and
aspirin sensitivity.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
The hallmark of asthma is recurrent
bronchoconstriction.
Asthma exacerbations can manifest with:
51

episodes

of reversible

Shortness of breath that is typically worsened with exertion.
Chest tightness or pain.
Wheezing which may be audible to the patient or caregiver, but
often time is not.
Cough that is often productive of inspissated secretions without being
related to an infection cause.
Some patients rarely wheeze but cough instead, especially children.
This is an important feature that should not be missed, because
patients with cough-variant asthma generally respond well to
therapy but often go undiagnosed.
Marked dyspnea and agitation in a patient who can speak in full
sentences should cause one to consider vocal cord dysfunction
(VCD).
Curschmann’s spirals are helical mucous plugs often observed in
asthmatic’s sputum.
Nocturnal awakenings with coughing or wheezing may be the
presenting symptom, especially in children. Nocturnal symptoms in a
patient who has previously had only daytime symptoms represent
disease progression.
Exercise-induced bronchospasm may also be the presenting
symptom. Consider asthma if a child cannot keep up with peers during
athletic activity secondary to coughing or wheezing.
Family history is frequently notable for the presence of atopic diseases.
Asthma triggers such as exercise, viral infections, environmental triggers,
smoke, should be identified during the history.
Environmental history should be carefully reviewed for potential allergen
exposures and should include:
Details about the home/work/school environment
Whether the patient has a seasonal or perennial profile of symptoms
Animal exposure
Smoking history
Physical Examination
Between acute exacerbations, asthmatic patients may have a completely
normal physical examination.
Vital signs can be normal, even during an acute exacerbation. Elevated
heart rate and respiratory rate are the most frequent abnormalities.
Oxygen desaturation tends to be a late sign in adults and indicates
52

impending respiratory failure.
General appearance can be an important indicator of severity. Inability
to speak in complete sentences, agitation, or lethargy are
alarming signs and should prompt immediate intervention.
Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat may show signs of
allergic disease or accessory muscle usage (especially in children).
Stridor or wheezing best heard in the neck suggests an
alternative diagnosis such as VCD or upper airway obstruction.
TABLE 4.3 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES OF ADULT ASTHMA

The lung examination frequently demonstrates high-pitched end
expiratory wheezing. In severe asthma exacerbations, wheezing
may not be heard at all and may indicate impending respiratory
failure.
Rhonchi or focal findings suggest a pulmonary infection that may have
triggered the exacerbation or, in the absence of fever, may represent
the tenacious secretions commonly seen in asthmatics.
Respiratory muscle alternans is the paradoxical movement of the
diaphragm with alternating abdominal and ribcage breathing. It
represents a patient in extremis and is more commonly seen in
children.
Other examination findings may include:
Intercostal retractions may be present during an exacerbation,
particularly in children.
Signs of Cushing’s syndrome secondary to exogenous steroid use.
Symptoms of other comorbid atopic conditions such as eczema.

Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of asthma in adults is presented in Table 4-3.
53

VCD is voluntary or involuntary adduction of the true or false vocal cords
resulting in dyspnea that can mimic asthma.
Up to 40% of asthmatics may exhibit VCD.
In addition to dyspnea, patients often present with a choking
sensation, dysphonia, and cough.
Wheezing heard best at the larynx is suggestive of VCD.
Pulmonary function test (PFT) flow volume loops may show flattening
of the inspiratory curve.
Diagnosis of VCD is made by direct visualization of the vocal cords
showing paradoxical movement during respiration.
Treatment consists of speech therapy. Early diagnosis is important to
avoid prolonged, unnecessary treatment, and some patients may also
benefit from psychiatric counseling.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Routine laboratory tests are usually normal in asthma but may
demonstrate neutrophilia if the patient is on steroids.
Arterial blood gas measurement may be indicated if a patient is in
danger of respiratory failure.
Most patients will have a respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation as
the patient works to increase minute ventilation.
A patient whose CO2 is normal or above normal during a severe
exacerbation is in danger of respiratory failure. This “normal” value
represents a patient who can no longer maintain a high minute
ventilation and has begun to tire out.
Imaging
An initial chest radiograph (CXR) of a pediatric patient who is wheezing
for the first time is necessary to rule out aspiration of a foreign body.
A CXR should also be obtained for any patient requiring admission.
CXR is rarely necessary in the outpatient setting for an established
asthmatic.
CXR may demonstrate:
Hyperinflation (flattening of the diaphragms).
Mucous plugging (linear atelectasis).
These findings may be indistinguishable from chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD).
54

CXR is particularly useful in patients who present with new-onset
wheezing, have other comorbidities (e.g., congestive heart failure,
COPD, or pneumonia), or have focal findings on examination.
One should also obtain a CXR when suspicion of a pneumothorax or
pneumomediastinum is present.
Diagnostic Procedures
PFT is an important component of asthma management (see Chapter
7).
While there is no single, definitive diagnostic test for asthma,
demonstration of reversible airway obstruction strongly supports the
diagnosis.
Methacholine challenge can be used to demonstrate airway
hyperresponsiveness when the question of asthma is in question.
Aeroallergen skin testing (see Chapter 8) will demonstrate positivity
to one or more allergens in atopic asthma and is often useful in guiding
therapy and counseling on allergen avoidance.

TREATMENT
Long-term goals for the management of asthma include reduction of risk
and impairment.2
Reduce risk of morbidity and mortality by:
Preventing exacerbations and minimizing emergency department
visits/hospitalizations.
Preventing permanent loss of lung function.
Minimizing side effects of pharmacotherapy.
Reduce functional impairment by:
Preventing day-to-day symptoms including coughing or shortness of
breath.
Minimizing use (≤2 days/week) of short-acting β2-agonists (SABAs) for
relief of symptoms (excluding pre-treatment for exercise-induced
asthma).
Maintaining normal activity levels to minimize interruption of exercise
and attendance at work/school.

Medications
Short-acting Medications
55

SABAs, such as albuterol or levalbuterol, are inhaled medications that
work through airway β2 receptors to relax the airway smooth muscle.
Used in all types of asthma for relief of acute symptoms.
Also indicated for use as pre-treatment in exercise-induced asthma.
Anticholinergics inhibit muscarinic cholinergic receptors and reduce
intrinsic airway vagal tone leading to bronchodilation.
Generally considered to be less effective in treating asthma symptoms
than SABAs.
Most commonly used in combination with a SABA for moderate to
severe asthma exacerbations and for those individuals who do not
tolerate SABA (e.g., tachyarrhythmias).
Systemic corticosteroids are administered either parenterally or orally
and are perhaps the most potent anti-inflammatory medications used to
treat asthma.
Primary indication in asthma is to treat moderate to severe
exacerbations.
Systemic steroids should be reserved for asthma exacerbations with
every effort made to transition to long-term controller medications.
A small subset of severe asthmatics with steroid-dependent asthma
are unable to tolerate withdrawal of steroids because of severe
respiratory symptoms.
The side effects of corticosteroids are multifold and include
neuropsychiatric disturbances, weight gain, glucose intolerance,
increased susceptibility to infections, avascular necrosis, growth
stunting, and adrenal insufficiency when used chronically.
Long-term Control Medications
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are mainstays of persistent
asthma therapy.
They are primarily anti-inflammatory, blocking late-phase reaction to
allergen, reducing airway hyperresponsiveness and inhibiting
inflammatory cell migration and activation.
ICSs have an onset of action of several days, and their maximal
activity is seen 2–3 weeks after initiation of therapy.
Therefore, ICSs should not be used as rescue medications.
Local side effects include dysphonia, throat irritation, and oral
candidiasis. Mouth rinsing after inhaler use may help prevent thrush.
Systemic side effects from ICSs are minimal in adults because of first56

pass metabolism in the liver.
Adrenal suppression is theoretically possible, but the risk of
symptomatic adrenal suppression is very small.
There is no clear link of ICSs to increased risk of osteoporosis.
Nevertheless, clinicians should consider screening individuals at risk
for osteoporosis who also need ICSs.
In children, ICSs are linked to a slightly delayed growth velocity.
This effect is considered transient, as it does not affect the final
adult height.
Long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) are long-acting inhaled medications
that are capable of providing bronchodilation for at least 12 hours (e.g.,
salmeterol and formoterol).
Studies have suggested increased mortality associated with LABA,
though this seems to be associated with LABA monotherapy.
LABAs should not be used as monotherapy, only as adjunctive
therapy with ICS for control of moderate persistent or severe
persistent asthma.14
Leukotriene modifiers are medications that alter the signaling or
synthesis of leukotrienes, which are lipid inflammatory mediators.
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) (montelukast and
zafirlukast) and a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (zileuton) are commercially
available.
They may be particularly effective in aspirin-sensitive asthma as
well as exercise-induced asthma.
Mast cell stabilizers act by preventing degranulation of mast cells.
Generally, these are older, less effective medications, and as such,
they are considered alternative treatments for mild persistent
asthma.
Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are examples of mast cell
stabilizers.
Theophylline is a methylxanthine drug that functions both as a
phosphodiesterase inhibitor and an adenosine receptor antagonist to
stimulate bronchodilation and reduce airway inflammation.
Serum levels of theophylline must be measured periodically as it has a
relatively narrow therapeutic range. Normal levels are 5–15 μg/mL.
Serious side effects include cardiac arrhythmia and seizure.
Anti-IgE therapy (i.e., omalizumab) is subcutaneously administered,
57

humanized, monoclonal antibody against human IgE. Expense limits its
usage to patients with moderate to severe asthma with demonstrated
sensitivity to perennial allergens.
Asthma Management
Acute exacerbation management (Table 4-4):2
The focus of treatment is to immediately alleviate symptoms.
Frequent need for oral corticosteroids should prompt re-evaluation
of therapeutic management.
Antibiotics are not routinely indicated for exacerbations unless there
are signs or symptoms of coincident infection.
Intravenous magnesium sulfate (2 g infused over 20 minutes) may
provide some benefit for patients with severe exacerbations.15,16
Long-term management:
A stepwise approach to increasing therapy is recommended (Fig. 4-1).
Asthma control should be reassessed periodically while on therapy and
treatment tailored to the level of control (Table 4-2).2
Step-down therapy should be considered when asthma is well
controlled to determine the minimum necessary medications.
Patient education is key to long-term asthma control.
Home peak-flow monitoring may be helpful in monitoring
asthma control, especially in patients who have difficulty assessing
their own symptoms.
Asthma action plans indicate a stepwise treatment plan tailored
to each individual patient. Typically, they indicate warning signs of
worsening symptoms such as a decrease in peak flow, along with a
therapeutic intervention.
Identify and recognize triggers so that patients are able to
implement environmental controls to reduce exacerbations.
Yearly influenza vaccination is recommended because asthmatic
patients are more susceptible to complications.

COMPLICATIONS
Status Asthmaticus
Defined as a severe exacerbation that fails to respond rapidly to
sympathomimetic agents.

58

TABLE 4.4 ACUTE ASTHMA EXACERBATION MANAGEMENT

Patients at risk for status are those who are on oral steroids, who
smoke, who have previously been intubated, who have been admitted
to an intensive care unit within the last year, and who frequently or
recently visited the emergency department.

59

Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a rare complication of
asthma and, more frequently, cystic fibrosis.

Blood Institute. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert

Asthma. NIH Publication 08-5846, Bethesda, MD, August 2007. HD, high

Aspergillus fumigatus is a common environmental mold that, in the
immunocompromised host, can cause invasive infections. It is also a
common allergen to which many atopic patients are sensitized that
contributes to both asthma and allergic rhinitis.
ABPA represents colonization (rather than infection) with
Aspergillus and subsequent development of Aspergillus
60

hypersensitivity.
This
results
in
bronchial
inflammation,
bronchiectasis, and respiratory complications.
A small subset of patients who have asthma progresses to intractable
ABPA and, often, oral corticosteroid–dependent disease.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Asthma During Pregnancy
Asthma control during pregnancy is variable with roughly one-third of
women improving, one-third remaining stable, and one-third
deteriorating.
Very few medications have been investigated for their safety during
pregnancy.
Budesonide is the only category B ICS (no evidence of risk to fetus).
SABAs appear to be relatively safe, though there may be a small
teratogenic risk to the fetus.
There is very little experience with LABAs in pregnancy, though animal
studies are reassuring.
High-dose systemic corticosteroids have been associated with
congenital malformations and low birth weight.
Poorly controlled asthma increases the risk to the fetus due to maternal
hypoxia.
Careful reassessment of asthma control medications before pregnancy
and discussion with the patient is necessary to minimize risk to the
fetus.

5 Occupational Asthma
Seema Mahale
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Occupational asthma (OA) is defined as variable airflow limitation and/or
bronchial hyperresponsiveness caused by exposures in the work place
setting.
OA also includes preexistent asthma that is worsened when exposed to
the work place.
There are two types of OA:
Sensitizer-induced OA, previously known as latent OA.
Irritant-induced OA, previously known as nonlatent OA.

Classification
Sensitizer-induced Occupational Asthma
Symptoms of asthma occur after a latency period of months to years
after initial exposure to sensitizing substance in the work place.
After the patient has been sensitized, airway reaction begins to develop
at levels of sensitizer that were previously tolerable. Typically, this is
an immunologically mediated reaction.
Different types of sensitizers are categorized by size:
High molecular weight (HMW): Agents >10 kD, commonly
inhaled proteins.
Low molecular weight (LMW): Agents <10 kD, haptenated
chemical.
Irritant-induced Occupational Asthma
Exposure to high levels of irritant agent can lead to reactive airways
dysfunction syndrome (RADS).
There is no latent period, and asthma symptoms occur within 24 hours
of exposure to the irritant substance.
Typical setting is an occupational accident that leads to exposure of
unusually high levels of irritant.
64

Diagnosis cannot be made in patients with preexisting asthma.

Epidemiology
It is estimated that 15–25% of de novo adult asthma is due to workrelated asthma.1,2
Prevalence of OA is difficult to assess, as there are not many prospective
studies. In addition, there are varying definitions of OA making it difficult
to gather data on the incidence of the disease.1
The most common occupations associated with OA are bakers, spray
painters, health care workers, hairdressers, and cleaners.3

Pathophysiology
There are more than 250 agents that have been identified to cause OA.
Table 5-1 is a list of commonly associated allergens causing OA.4
TABLE 5.1 AGENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA

Sensitizer-induced OA
HMW sensitizer:
Proteins
and/or
glycoproteins
act as antigens in an
immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mechanism. The allergen
occasionally can be well characterized. However, several sensitizers
are difficult to identify.1
This IgE-mediated response leads to similar pathology seen in
nonoccupational asthma (see Chapter 4), with bronchial wall
65

thickening, secondary eosinophilic infiltration, smooth muscle
hypertrophy, fibroblast proliferation of subepithelium and airway
obstruction.
LMW sensitizer:
LMW sensitizers can cause OA by both IgE and non–IgE-mediated
mechanisms.
LMW sensitizers can haptenate to host proteins and drive IgE
expression.
Cell-mediated mechanisms may underlie some immunologic
mechanisms to LMW sensitizers.
Irritant-induced OA
In contrast to sensitizer-induced OA, irritant-induced OA is caused by
direct toxic effects of these agents on airway tissues (see Table 5-1
for a list of common irritant agents).
Since these reactions are not immunologically mediated, prior
exposure is not necessary to induce pathology.
Exposure to high levels of irritant agents can lead to a cascade of events
involving the nonadaptive immunologic response.
Initially, there is injury to bronchial epithelial cells causing release
of inflammatory mediators and neurogenic inflammation. Nonspecific
macrophage activation occurs with mast cell degranulation.

Risk Factors
The most important risk factor is the level and duration of exposure
to agents capable of causing OA. High levels of exposure and long
duration of exposure lead to increasing likelihood of occurrence of OA.
Atopy is a risk factor for HMW allergens.
Patients that develop occupational rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis
are at increased risk of developing OA.
There is geographic variation to the incidence of OA. Similar substances
in different parts of the world are associated with different rates of OA.
This may be due to the variation in exposure, co-exposures, and in
recognition of disease.
Tobacco smoking.

Prevention
Primary prevention efforts should focus on implementing interventions
66

that reduce exposure to known OA-causing agents.4
In a facility where there is known sensitizers, new cases of OA can be
reduced by limiting ambient exposure to HMW sensitizers and by
identifying patients with new occupational allergic symptoms.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients present with symptoms of asthma including dyspnea, wheezing,
chest tightness, and cough.
Symptoms of rhinitis and conjunctivitis will often precede the
development of asthma.
In OA, these symptoms should be related to a workplace
exposure to a known OA-causing agent.
History should include details about occupational history and all
previous jobs held. The patient should also be asked about the use of
protective equipment.
Additional history will help differentiate OA from non–work-related
asthma, vocal cord dysfunction, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Differential Diagnosis
In addition to other diseases that can masquerade as asthma, other
respiratory diseases should be considered along with OA
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis can usually be distinguished from O.A
by radiographic findings, which often show ground-glass nodularities,
and pulmonary function testing (PFT) that typically shows restrictive
disease.
Bronchiolitis obliterans (“popcorn worker’s lung”) has been linked to
diacetyl exposure in the workplace.

Diagnostic Testing
Reversible airway limitation should be documented by spirometry and/or
bronchial reactivity challenge with histamine, mannitol, or methacholine.
In addition to establishing the presence of reversible airway obstruction,
the diagnosis of OA must be confirmed by the evidence of workrelated symptom worsening.
Objective data that can be used to link work place exposure to OA
67

include spirometry, peak flow, and immunologic testing.
Serial spirometry or peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) are often
used to demonstrate a temporal worsening of airway obstruction after
workplace exposures.
This approach is limited by patient compliance, but when used
correctly has a high sensitivity and specificity.
Typically, a patient with suspected OA will record serial flow rates for
2–4 weeks.
Ideally, the patient will measure PEFR four times daily: Morning, midshift, after work, and before sleeping.
One of those weeks includes a week away from work.
Patients with OA typically display the following pattern:1
Worsening of peak flow as the day progresses with improvement
over the weekend.
Progressively worsening peak flow as the work week progresses.
Improvement in peak flows during a week away from work or during
vacation.
Specific inhalation challenge can be used to demonstrate reversible
airway obstruction after exposure to a specific sensitizer.
During a specific inhalation challenge, the patient is exposed to a
specific sensitizer in a controlled environment.
This allows the physician to identify a direct causal relationship
between a sensitizer and airway obstruction.
Considered the gold standard in diagnosis of IgE-mediated OA.
Testing is limited by the necessity of trained personnel and emergency
equipment.
Immunologic testing can establish sensitization to a particular
sensitizer.
High negative predictive value, indicating that if a patient has a
negative test to a sensitizer that is a known work-related sensitizer,
then the patient likely does not have OA.
Useful mostly for HMW sensitizers since testing is dependent on IgEmediated reaction.

Demonstration of sensitization does not necessarily establish that the
tested agent is responsible for the patient’s respiratory symptoms
(specific inhalation challenge may be necessary).
A simplified diagnostic workflow for OA is presented in Fig. 5-1.

69

TREATMENT
The first-line and most important treatment for sensitizer-induced OA is
removal of the patient from the working environment.
Pharmacologic treatment of OA is the same as non–work-related
asthma. The same treatment guidelines and symptomatic control are
applied to the management of OA.
Pharmacologic treatment is second-line therapy after the removal
from the work environment.
Patients that continue to be exposed to sensitizer despite
optimal medications have poor outcomes due to chronic
remodeling of the airways.
Allergen immunotherapy is a treatment option for sensitized OA.
This therapy should only be used when a patient is unable to leave
the work environment and when a specific agent has been identified
as a cause of OA.4
Patients with irritant-induced OA do not need to be removed from their
working environment, but steps should be taken to prevent further
high level of exposure.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The socioeconomic impact of being diagnosed with OA can have a
lasting effect on the patient.
Continued exposure to offending occupational agent can lead to fatal
asthma exacerbation.4
Once a patient has stopped working at the offending work place, many
times they have difficulty finding new employment. This can further lead
to depression as the patient still has financial obligations.
In this setting, the specialty physician has a duty to be the patient’s
advocate in qualifying for disability or workman’s compensation.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients should be monitored approximately on a yearly basis after
removal from offending agents. There is evidence that patients may
have persistent symptoms even after leaving the work place.4
If patients are unable to leave the work place, more frequent monitoring
70

may be indicated based on the severity of symptoms.4

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Outcomes of patients with OA depend on the removal of exposure to
offending agent, duration of exposure, and severity of symptoms during
exposure.5
If the patient is no longer exposed to the offending agent, the prognosis
is excellent.

6 Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
Olajumoke O. Fadugba
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), previously called extrinsic allergic
alveolitis, is a disease caused by inappropriate immunologic
reaction to inhaled antigens, resulting in respiratory and systemic
symptoms.
Diagnosis is based on a history of antigen exposure, clinical features,
radiographic, laboratory, physiologic, and sometimes histopathologic
findings. It is a complex syndrome of varying intensity and natural
history and may mimic other chronic lung diseases such as sarcoidosis
and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Classification
Clinical presentation is classically characterized as acute, subacute, and
chronic depending on the intensity, frequency and duration of exposure,
and the severity of the host’s immune inflammatory response.
The three forms of the syndrome are not stages of a single disease
process, as patients with acute HP do not necessarily progress to chronic
disease, and patients who present with the chronic form may not have
the acute presentation.1

Epidemiology
The greatest risk factor for developing HP is exposure to inhaled
organic particles and chemical compounds. Contact with birds
(e.g., pigeons, parakeets), humidifiers, moldy wood, and other
environmental settings can increase risk (Table 6-1).2
Farmer’s lung was the first form of HP described in farmers of the early
20th century exposed to moldy straw and hay.
Genetic factors have also been postulated to contribute to risk.
Cigarette smoking may decrease the risk of HP in exposed
72

individuals.3
The incidence of HP varies depending on location, season, local
practices, and host response.
Estimates of the true prevalence and incidence of HP are largely
unknown because HP is rare, the lack of consistent clinical definition for
HP, and the few cohort studies on the incidence or prevalence of the
disease.

Etiology
There is a wide range of occupations and inhaled agents that can cause
HP (Table 6-1).2
Most antigens are organic, but some low molecular weight chemical
compounds can form haptens with serum albumin to create an antigenic
particle.3
Inhaled particles must be small enough (<5 μm) to reach the lung
parenchyma and trigger an immune response.
TABLE 6.1 EXAMPLES OF ETIOLOGIC AGENTS IN
HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS

73

The causative agents for HP continue to increase as societal practices
change.
Household mold has been increasingly implicated in causing HP.
Over the past decade, the incidence of humidifier lung has increased,
while farmer’s lung incidence has decreased.4

Pathophysiology
HP is an immune-mediated disease with possible roles for both antibody
and cellular immune responses.
The immune response to the inciting antigen can cause expression
of antibodies resulting in immune complex formation (type III
hypersensitivity).
74

High titer, antigen-specific, precipitating serum antibody to the
inciting antigen can result in complement fixation.
Presence of precipitating antibodies to specific antigen is an
important diagnostic markers of HP.
Cell-mediated mechanisms (type IV hypersensitivity) are also likely
to be contributing to disease.
Fixation of complement results in the recruitment of inflammatory
cells including lymphocytes and macrophages.
Once present in the lung tissue, these immune cells are thought to
secrete Th1 skewed cytokines, including interferon gamma, which
promotes persistent inflammation and granuloma formation.
Genetics may also influence the development of HP. Polymorphisms in
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and HLA haplotypes have been implicated
in pathogenesis.
Acute HP is characterized by a neutrophilic infiltrate, which is later
replaced by activated lymphocytes with a predominance of CD8+ over
CD4+ cells.
Subacute HP demonstrates non-caseating granulomas (demonstrating
less organization than in sarcoidosis).
Chronic HP may or may not show granulomas but demonstrates
interstitial fibrosis, particularly in the upper lobes of the lung.

Prevention
HP can be prevented by reducing exposure to causative agents and
using protective equipment.
Antigen reduction focuses on ridding environments of antigenic
particles:
Wetting compost before handling reduces dispersion of actinomycete
spores.
Using antimicrobial agents while processing sugar cane reduces mold
growth.
Facility design can reduce the chances of contamination of the work
environment:
Moisture plays a large role in indoor microbial overgrowth.
Humidity in buildings should be kept below 60%, carpeting should be
avoided in moist areas, and water in ventilating systems should not
be recirculated.
75

Protective devices: In circumstances where it is impossible to
completely eliminate environmental antigens, controls such as
respirators should be used.5

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Despite the diversity of inhaled agents that can cause HP, that there are
various diseases present with similar symptoms, suggesting that they
share pathogenic features.
Affected patients present with interstitial pneumonitis in one of the three
forms of the disease:
Acute HP: This form usually occurs within 4–6 hours of exposure. It is
the most easily recognized form and presents with fever, chills,
malaise, cough, and dyspnea without wheezing. Symptoms last
for hours to days and can be confused with viral or bacterial illness.
Physical examination often reveals tachypnea and fine inspiratory
crackles especially at the lung bases; wheezing is rarely heard.
Subacute HP: This is characterized by more gradual onset of lowgrade fever, cough, progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and
sometimes anorexia and weight loss. This may be superimposed
with acute episodes. Examination reveals tachypnea, lung crackles,
and sometimes cyanosis. This, like acute HP, is usually reversible with
the removal of antigen.
Chronic HP: This form often occurs with exposure to antigen for a
long period. It presents with insidious onset over a period of
months to years, with progressive cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and
weight loss. Examination may reveal cyanosis and if digital clubbing
is seen, suggests poor prognosis. This form is often disabling and is
usually irreversible.3

Differential Diagnosis
There are many diseases apart from HP that are associated with
inhalation of organic agents. Furthermore, other syndromes have clinical
or histologic features similar to HP.
Inhalation fever (e.g., metal fume fever): Occurs a few hours after
inhaling the substance; characterized by fever, malaise, myalgias,
76

headache, without significant pulmonary symptoms. This is self-limited
(usually within 24 hours) without long-term effects.6
Organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS): This, unlike HP, is a
nonimmunologic reaction to inhaled antigens. It is much more
common in farmers than HP and is caused by exposure to
mycotoxins or endotoxins produced by fungi found in moldy hay,
grains, and Fusarium-contaminated textile materials. Symptoms and
findings include fever, myalgias, cough, dyspnea 4–6 hours postexposure, leukocytosis, and normal lung function or mild restriction with
reduced diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO). Notably with
ODTS, serum precipitins are negative and there are no long-term
sequelae.7
Chronic bronchitis: This is much more common than HP in farmers.
The immune mechanism of HP and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease in nonsmokers is thought to be related.
Sarcoidosis: Both HP and sarcoidosis have lymphocytosis on
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and may demonstrate noncaseating
granulomas on lung biopsy. However, granulomas in sarcoidosis have
distribution in bronchial wall and perivascular locations while HP
granulomas have a centrilobular distribution. Also in sarcoidosis, there is
less lymphocytosis (around 50% vs. 70% in HP), with a predominance
of CD4+ cells as opposed to CD8+ T-cell predominance in HP, though
this distinction has recently been challenged.3
IPF: The chronic form of HP can be distinguished from IPF partly by
findings of centrilobular opacities and lack of lower lobe-predominant
fibrosis in HP.2

Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis of HP is based on history of exposure, clinical picture, imaging,
and physiologic findings.
Other testing may be useful in solidifying the diagnosis of HP or ruling
out other potential diseases.
Identifying the causative agent is particularly important to prevent
ongoing exposure.
Laboratories
Serum precipitins: Most patients with HP have precipitating
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies specific to the inhaled antigen.
77

These antibodies are often present in asymptomatic exposed people
as well; only 1–15% of people exposed to an offending antigen
develop the disease. Therefore, the presence of serum
precipitins simply indicates exposure and not necessarily
disease.
Absence of serum precipitins does not rule out HP because some
HP-associated antigens may not be present in the routine precipitin
panel and some antigens are still undiscovered.
There are several methods for detecting precipitins. The conventional
Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion test is limited in both sensitivity
and specificity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is
a preferred method, but also lacks standardization.1,3
Other laboratory tests:
Nonspecific laboratories such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),
C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) may be elevated in HP.
Serum IgE and eosinophils are not typically elevated.
Skin tests are not useful in the diagnosis of HP.
Imaging
Chest radiographs in patients with HP may be normal or show discrete
nodules or diffuse, poorly defined infiltrates in the acute or subacute
form of the disease. Chronic HP may show reticulonodular infiltrates,
fibrosis, or honeycombing.
High resolution CT (HRCT) in being increasingly used to aid the
diagnosis of HP.
Various changes can be seen including honeycombing, and fibrosis,
especially in chronic HP.
Centrilobular ground-glass opacities are a differentiating
feature of HP.
Additionally, pathologic changes in HP can demonstrate a
characteristic distribution:
Acute HP shows abnormalities more prominent in the lower
lung zones while chronic disease is manifested more in the
upper zones of the lung.
Most inhaled antigens deposit in the dependent (lower) lung
regions.
Lymphatic clearance of antigens in the upper zones is slower than
78

that in the lower zones of the lung. Therefore, with chronic antigen
exposure, the upper lung zones are more severely damaged.
Findings not usually associated with HP are lung cavities, hilar
adenopathy, and pleural thickening.1

Diagnostic Procedures
Inhalation Challenge
Inhalation challenge can be used to link HP symptoms to the suspected
antigen.
A patient can be exposed to the offending environment, after which
symptoms are observed. Alternatively, in a controlled environment (such
as a hospital), the patient is exposed to the suspected antigen via a
nebulizer.
Changes in clinical picture, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and chest
imaging are studied for 24 hours.
These tests are limited in utility as the inhalation protocols lack
standardization.3
Pulmonary Function Testing
PFTs cannot distinguish HP from other interstitial lung disease.
PFTs are used to measure functional impairment and can help guide
treatment (e.g., who should get corticosteroid treatment).
Characteristically, PFTs show a restrictive pattern with
decreased DLCO.
An obstructive pattern can predominate in more insidious forms of HP,
especially as emphysematous changes develop.
Mixed restrictive and obstructive defects can also occur.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage
BAL is an important tool in supporting the diagnosis of HP.
Neutrophils in BAL fluid increase early after antigen exposure.
The BAL fluid in the subacute and chronic forms of HP has
marked lymphocytosis, with the percentage of lymphocytes ranging
between 60 and 70% (normal is 6–8%).
HP typically demonstrates more CD8+ than CD4+ T cells with a
CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio of less than 1. This is in contrast to the BAL
fluid in sarcoidosis where CD4+/CD8+ ratio is usually 5:1 or greater.
Eosinophils are not increased (except in some advanced cases), but
79

mast cells and basophils can be increased.1,3
A normal BAL lymphocyte count essentially rules out active disease.
Lung Biopsy
Lung biopsy is sometimes needed to confirm the diagnosis of HP and can
be obtained by transbronchial means or surgically.
Lung biopsy should be reserved for patients with a very unusual
presentation or unexpected response to treatment, given the possible
morbidity associated with surgical biopsy.
Histopathologic findings include interstitial lymphocyte and plasma
cell infiltrates, small, poorly formed noncaseating granulomas,
and macrophages with foamy cytoplasm in the alveoli.
In chronic stages, peribronchiolar fibrosis can be seen. Schaumann
bodies (calcium and protein inclusions) within isolated Langhans giant
cells can also be seen.3

TREATMENT
The principles of HP management are twofold: Avoidance of antigen
exposure and glucocorticoids.
Avoidance of the offending antigen through environmental control is the
cornerstone of therapy in HP.
If antigen exposure is related to the patient’s job, avoidance can be
difficult because of the potential loss of livelihood.
Antigen can often persist at home despite removal of the primary
offending agent (e.g., birds). In such cases, professional control
measures and environmental modification may be sought.

Medications
Some patients benefit from corticosteroids, the only drugs currently used
for HP.
Indications for use are acute, severe, or progressive disease.
Glucocorticoids help to control symptoms but do not improve long-term
outcome.
The recommended regimen is 40–60 mg of prednisone or its equivalent
corticosteroid. Treatment duration is 1–2 weeks followed by a taper over
2–4 weeks.3,8,9

80

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The majority of patients with HP recover fully after they are
removed from the offending environment, and some recover
despite continued exposure.
Among the most well-studied types of HP, bird fancier’s lung has a worse
prognosis than famer’s lung.
Patients with chronic HP who have fibrosis or honeycombing on
HRCT or lung biopsy clearly have worse prognosis, and their
disease may be irreversible despite environmental control or
corticosteroid therapy.
The risk of mortality increases with lower DLCO, oxygen
desaturation following exercise (≤88%), and more severe
restrictive ventilatory defects on PFTs.

7 Pulmonary Function Tests
Ashley Emmert
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) include several different methods of
assessing the functional characteristics of an individual’s lungs. As such,
they are valuable adjuncts to the treatment and assessment of
respiratory diseases.
Common PFTs utilized in clinical practice include spirometry, lung volume
measurement, and the diffusion capacity.

Classification
Spirometry is a PFT that measures the dynamic airflow during the
respiratory cycle.
Commonly used abbreviations and values derived from PFTs are
shown in Table 7-1.
Flow volume loops can be invaluable in difficult diagnostic cases by
providing insight into functional characteristics of upper and lower
airways as well as possible functional defects due to extrathoracic
causes.
Lung volume PFTs measure the absolute capacity of a patient’s lungs.
Diffusion capacity measurement is a type of PFT that measures the
ability of the lung to transport gasses.

DIAGNOSIS
PFTs are obtained for various reasons.
Diagnosis:
Evaluate presence of pulmonary disease.
Evaluate symptoms of dyspnea, cough, or wheezing.
Screen for high-risk individuals (e.g., smokers or those with
occupational exposures).
83

Pre-operative evaluation.
Monitoring:
Assess response to bronchodilator therapy.
Follow progression of present pulmonary disease.
Assess for adverse reactions to drugs that may have pulmonary side
effects (e.g., amiodarone).
Assess pulmonary dysfunction in response to environmental
exposures.
Other:
Documentation of disability for insurance.
Assess for qualifications for rehabilitation programs.
TABLE 7.1 ABBREVIATIONS USED IN PULMONARY FUNCTION
TESTING

Follow-up spirograms are used mainly for monitoring purposes and can
be repeated at the physician’s discretion. For asthma patients,
guidelines recommend an initial diagnostic spirogram and at least one
annually for the management of therapy.
84

Diagnostic Testing
Spirometry is generally performed by one of two methods:
Open-circuit spirometry is generally cheaper to perform.
Closed-circuit spirometry allows more accurate measurement of the
functional residual capacity (FRC), but because the patient breathes
into the machine, maintaining good hygiene is a concern.
Normal baseline values for spirometry are dependent on various
factors including sex, age, weight, and height.
Spirometry is a patient effort–dependent test that requires the
understanding and cooperation of patients for accurate and
reproducible test results.
The minimum number of respiratory loops needed is three, and the
best forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital
capacity (FVC) of the three test values should be recorded and used
for interpretation.
The maximum recommended number for consecutive testing is
eight, because patient fatigue becomes a significant factor after
more than eight trials.
Criteria for acceptable spirometry from the American Thoracic
Society include1:
A smooth continuous exhalation for >6 seconds demonstrating a
plateau, defined as no change in the volume for at least 1 second
during expiration.
A satisfactory start of test without hesitation or false start.
Lack of artifacts such as coughing, glottic closure, early termination
of exhalation, or obstructed mouth piece.
Properly calibrated equipment without leak.
The reproducibility of lung function tests are important not only for
following the longitudinal trends but also to ensure that such tests
can be compared from one test center to the another. Criteria for
reproducibility include1:
The largest FVC should be within 0.15 L of the second largest FVC
value.
The largest FEV1 should be within 0.15 L of the second largest FEV1.
Additional spirograms (maximum of eight) should be obtained to
assure that the above criteria are met in at least three of the
maneuvers.
85

An algorithm for interpretation of PFTs is shown in Fig. 7-1.
FIGURE 7.1 Algorithm for interpretation of pulmonary function. DLCO,
diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide; FEV1, forced expiratory
volume in 1 second; FVC, forced vital capacity; MMEF, maximal mid
expiratory flow; PEF, peak expiratory flow; PO2, partial pressure of oxygen;
TLC, total lung capacity.

TABLE 7.2 SAMPLE PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS OF A PATIENT
WITH ASTHMA

86

Evidence of airway obstruction can be made with PFTs.
When airway obstruction is present, the values of FEV1 and FVC can
both be reduced, but FEV1 is disproportionately reduced compared to
FVC, thus giving a lower FEV1:FVC ratio.
The primary criterion for the diagnosis of obstruction is FEV1:FVC
<87% of predicted.
Occasionally, in the face of borderline FEV 1:FVC, earlier airflow
obstruction may be detected by forced expiratory flow (FEF) 25–
75%, the rationale being that earlier changes in airway obstruction
start in the smaller and peripheral airways. This is a nonspecific
finding and should not be used as a criterion for the diagnosis of
small airways disease.
In asthma, the primary functional abnormality is the presence of
reversible airway obstruction.
This can be demonstrated on spirometry by the measurement of
FEV1 and FVC before and after the administration of
bronchodilators.
Reversibility of >12% of FEV1 (or 200 mL increase from
baseline) supports a diagnosis of asthma. See Table 7-2 for sample
PFTs of a patient with asthma.
The absence of improvement after bronchodilator treatment does
not exclude reversible obstruction. Obstruction may be due to
inflammation, which may only be reversible after prolonged
antiinflammatory therapy.
In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema,
there is an obstructive pattern of PFTs with reduction in the ratio of
87

FEV1:FVC, but this obstruction is usually not responsive to
bronchodilator administration. See Table 7-3 for sample PFTs of a
patient with emphysema/COPD.
In contrast to asthma, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon
monoxide (DLCO) is often reduced in COPD.
In advanced disease air trapping becomes more evident—the total
lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) increase, resulting in
an increase in the RV:TLC ratio.
Restrictive lung disease is characterized by a decreased TLC
<70% of predicted.
FEV1 and FVC are usually proportionately reduced and, therefore,
will give a normal ratio of FEV1:FVC.
TABLE 7.3 SAMPLE PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS OF A PATIENT
WITH EMPHYSEMA/CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY
DISEASE

As the disease process progresses FVC may decrease faster than
FEV1 and, thus, can increase the ratio. See Table 7-4 for sample
PFTs of a patient with restrictive lung disease.
Restrictive defects are graded based on the severity of decrease in
TLC or vital capacity (VC).
Peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs) can be calculated from a
spirogram or measured with a hand-held peak flow meter.
Peak expiratory flows can be used to roughly diagnose asthma;
however, this is not a recommended practice.
88

The PEFR is used as an outpatient tool in measuring response to
therapy as well as monitoring early symptoms of exacerbation or
helping to identify provocative factors.
Normal values of PEFR are based on age, gender, and height.
In addition, there is a well-documented diurnal variation to the
peak flow values, with lowest values occurring in the early morning
on awakening and highest values obtained during 4–6 p.m.
It is important to obtain values in the mornings and the evenings.
Each measurement should be the highest value from three
consecutive maneuvers.
TABLE 7.4 SAMPLE PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS OF A PATIENT
WITH RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE

If there is 20% diurnal variation, this is a suggestion of airway
hyperresponsiveness and further treatment or testing should be
instituted.
Adult patients are able to correctly identify symptom exacerbations
before a decrease in the peak flow meter values. However, pediatric
patients and their parents report being symptom free until the peak
expiratory flow values are in the worrisome range.
Peak flow meters provide some valuable objective measurements to
follow and tailor therapy. Alert values are usually divided into three
zones: Green, yellow, and red.
Green: No symptoms (>80% of baseline maximal PEFR).
Yellow: Mild symptoms (50–80% of baseline maximal PEFR).
Red: Moderate to severe symptoms (<50% of baseline PEFR).
PEFR <80% of baseline usually signals need for contacting a physician
and possible escalation of treatment, either with an increasing
dose/frequency of β-agonist, a course of antibiotics, adjustment of
other medications, or a course of oral corticosteroids.
Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) can be documented via
89

bronchoprovocation with agents known to cause bronchial
constriction.2
BHR is a hallmark feature of asthma that is demonstrable in nearly all
patients with asthma.
Bronchoprovocation challenges are performed for:
Suspicion of asthma by history but nondiagnostic PFTs.
Assessing the relative risk for developing occupational asthma.
Evaluation of severity of occupational asthma.
Absolute contraindications for bronchoprovocation challenge are:
Severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 <50% predicted or <1 L).
Myocardial infarction or stroke within 3 months.
Uncontrolled hypertension with systolic blood pressure >200 or
diastolic blood pressure >100.
Known aortic aneurysm.
Relative contraindications include:
Moderate airflow obstruction (FEV1 <60% predicted or <1.5 L).
Inability to cooperate or follow directions for test.
Current use of cholinesterase inhibitor medication.
Pregnancy or breastfeeding (methacholine is considered category C
in pregnancy).
Medications that can decrease bronchial responsiveness are presented
in Table 7-5.
Methacholine, histamine, and mannitol challenges are commonly used
methods of testing BHR.
Methacholine is the agent of choice among many clinicians
because of the extensive clinical experience and reduced side
effects.
Histamine challenges can have systemic side effects, such as
headache, tachycardia, and flushing. Another disadvantage to
histamine is that tachyphylaxis can develop at higher
concentrations and with consecutive repeated exposures.
Mannitol challenge is a newer pharmacologic agent used to test for
BHR that is thought to induce hyperresponsiveness by changing the
osmolarity of the bronchial epithelial surface, resulting in mast cell
degranulation.
There are two methods for performing bronchoprovocation challenge:
In the 2-minute tidal breathing protocol, the patient is given
90

increasing doses of bronchoprovocation agent via nebulizer and
should breathe tidal breaths for exactly 2 minutes. FEV1 is
measured at the end of each 2 minutes and the highest FEV1 from
the acceptable volume loops is recorded. If the FEV1 changes by
<20% from the baseline, then the next dose is given. However, if
the FEV1 changes by >20% from baseline, then the test is
terminated, and patient should be assessed for symptoms. At the
conclusion of the test, inhaled albuterol is administered, and after
10 minutes, repeat spirometry is obtained.
TABLE 7.5 MEDICATIONS TO WITHHOLD BEFORE
BRONCHOPROVOCATION TESTING

In the five-breath dosimeter protocol, the patient is given a
nebulizer
with
dosimeter
attached,
and
doses
of
bronchoprovocation agent are administered after complete
91

exhalation. The patient takes slow (5 seconds), deep breaths
through the mouthpiece for a total of five breaths, which should be
completed in 2 minutes. FEV1 is measured approximately 30
seconds and 90 seconds after the fifth inhalation. These maneuvers
are repeated until FEV1 decreases by >20% or the maximal
concentration is reached. Once the test is terminated, inhaled
albuterol is administered and spirometry is repeated 10 minutes
later.
Measurement of response to the bronchial challenge can be
expressed in various ways.
Common methods include reporting the changes in FEV1, airways
resistance, maximum expiratory flow volume curves, or total
respiratory resistance.
The most widely used method in clinical practice is the
measurement of decrease in FEV1. This is reported in
conjunction with the provocative concentration 20 (PC20),
which is defined as the concentration of constrictor agent at which
FEV1 falls by 20% from baseline.
Positive test results (for methacholine) are usually defined as a
PC20 <8 mg/mL or 16 mg/mL. Methacholine is a nonspecific
bronchoconstrictor and can lead to bronchoconstriction in all people
when given in high enough doses. Whether the patient should be
diagnosed with asthma requires critical assessment of the pretest
probability and clinical suspicion. Asthmatic patients usually
have a positive response at concentrations lower than 8
mg/mL.
A negative test result (for methacholine) is defined as the
absence of bronchial constriction at concentration >16 mg/mL. A
negative test has a higher predictive value and rules out
the diagnosis of asthma.

Many clinical tests have been created to help detect specific antigen
sensitivities.
The most commonly used tests detect the presence of immunoglobulin E
(IgE) antibodies against known antigens and include skin testing and in
vitro measurements of IgE.
While testing can be very useful, it is not a substitute for a thorough
history as sensitization, that is, the presence of specific IgE antibody, is
not the same as allergy, which is sensitization leading to clinically
observed symptoms.

DIAGNOSIS
Immediate Hypersensitivity Skin Testing
Immediate hypersensitivity skin testing is an in vivo measure of the
presence of an antigen-specific IgE.
This is the most sensitive and cost-effective method to screen existing
IgE sensitivities that may be responsible for clinical symptoms.
The antigen is applied to the skin surface by different methods including
epicutaneous and intradermal methods.
The response recorded is due to immediate hypersensitivity and
manifests as a “wheal and flair” reaction.
The wheal is the area of swelling and edema surrounding the site of
allergen exposure.
The flair refers to the erythema around a site of allergen exposure
resulting from vasodilation.
Both are measured when assessing the allergic response through skin
testing.
Skin testing should be performed by a trained professional who is
94

familiar with possible adverse reactions and the implications of a
positive or a negative test result as it relates to the patient’s symptom
history and clinical picture.
Indications
Documentation of allergic sensitivity to the specific allergens in patients
with the following conditions1:
Asthma (both to aeroallergens and occupational allergens)
Rhinitis
Conjunctivitis
Food allergy
Certain drug allergies
Insect hypersensitivity
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
Local anesthetics
Skin testing is needed for choosing allergen immunotherapy extracts.
Epicutaneous Skin Tests
These methods introduce the antigen into the epidermis of the skin and
thereby activate any IgE-sensitized mast cells by the cross-linking of IgE
molecules present on the mast cell surface.
This, in turn, releases mediators from the mast cell, including histamine,
tryptase, chymase, and heparin.
Typically, the local reaction will be detectable by wheal-and-flare
reaction within 15 minutes. However, some sensitivities are not
detectable by this method, and further testing (i.e., intradermal skin
tests, see later) is needed.1
Preferred areas for testing are the back and volar aspect of the arm.
Epicutaneous skin tests include prick and puncture techniques.
Prick skin testing2:
The prick skin test is performed by placing a small drop of allergen
on the cleansed skin surface and passing a 25- or 26-gauge needle
through the antigen at a 45-degree angle.
The needle should be lightly pressed into the epidermis and then
lifted, creating a break in the epidermis without causing bleeding.
Test antigens should be placed >2 cm from one another.
Various hollow and solid bore needles and blood lancets are
available under different trade names.
95

Puncture skin testing2:
The puncture skin test is performed by placing a small drop of the
allergen extract on the cleansed skin surface and then puncturing
the skin with a device at a perpendicular angle, penetrating 1–1.5
mm into the skin.
Disposable commercially available devices made of plastic allow for
placement of multiple antigen test sites at one time.
Each test antigen site should be placed >2 cm apart.
Intradermal Skin Testing
Intradermal skin testing is more sensitive than the epicutaneous
skin tests, but it is generally only performed if the epicutaneous
test is negative.1
The test is performed using 25- to 27-gauge needles. A small amount of
allergen extract (0.02–0.05 mL; 0.02 mL in hymenoptera to avoid falsepositive) is injected intracutaneously, creating a small bleb 2–3 mm in
diameter.2
Spaces between each injection site should be >2 cm.
For patients with a negative prick–puncture test, the concentration of
extract for intradermal testing should be between 100- and 1,000-fold
more dilute than the concentration used for epicutaneous testing.1,2
Variability in test results is often due to common errors, which
include injecting too deeply, using too much extract, or causing
bleeding. Injecting the extract too deeply may hide the response,
thereby giving a false-negative result. On the other hand, use of too
much extract or bleeding from the prick or puncture may give falsepositive results.2
Test Controls
Positive controls2:
Histamine at 1 mg/mL for epicutaneous methods and 0.1 mg/mL for
intradermal skin testing is used.
A patient must have a positive response to the histamine control to
proceed with the skin testing.
Lack of an appropriate response to a positive control invalidates
skin testing results.
Possible causes of a negative response to a histamine control
include medications (see later) and certain skin conditions.
96

Mast cell degranulators, such as codeine or morphine sulfate, may also
be used as positive controls.
Negative controls2:
Diluents used to preserve the allergen extracts are used as negative
controls.
This will help detect any problems with technique, possible skin
irritation reaction, or dermatographism.
Interpretation of Skin Test Results
The immediate hypersensitivity reaction can be quantified by measuring
the diameter of the wheal and associated erythema (Table 8-1).3
Wheal size was found to be more specific than erythema size and to
correlate better to clinical symptoms.
The results should be measured at the peak of the reaction.1
The peak time for histamine reaction is 8–10 minutes.
The peak time for mast cell activators such as opiates is 10–15
minutes.
The peak time for most allergen is 15–20 minutes.
Positive reactions are any wheals that measure >3 mm in
diameter more than the negative control.
Contraindications
Skin tests should not be performed in patients who have had a recent
severe allergic reaction (i.e., anaphylaxis) because test results are
unreliable in these instances. Skin testing is usually postponed for 4–6
weeks after the acute event.
TABLE 8.1 GRADING SYSTEM FOR SKIN TESTING

97

Tests should not be performed on patients who have severe eczema
or dermatographism because of difficulty in interpreting the results.1
Intradermal testing is never performed for food allergy.1,4
Skin testing should be performed with extreme caution in patients with a
history of severe hypersensitivity reactions (i.e., to venom, foods, drugs)
and usually not while patients are on β-adrenergic blocking agents.1,5
Interfering Medications
Several medications can interfere with skin test results usually due to
antihistaminic effects.
The mean and maximum number of days of skin testing suppression
differs for each medication based on its pharmacologic properties.
While many medications can be stopped without major adverse effects,
stopping other medications such as tricyclic antidepressants and atypical
antipsychotics agents can lead to serious health consequences relating
to the condition that is being treated.
Table 8-2 includes a list of classes of medications and how long they
should be discontinued before testing.1
Less Common Forms of Skin Testing
Scratch skin test:
The scratch skin test is performed by making abrasions on the skin
and then applying the allergen extract to the site, allowing it to
diffuse through the skin.
Because of its poor standardization and reproducibility, this
method has fallen out of favor and is rarely used.
Prausnitz–Kustner test:
The Prausnitz–Kustner test is a passive transfer test and is of
historical interest only.
TABLE 8.2 DRUGS THAT INTERFERE WITH ALLERGY SKIN
TESTING

98

This test was the first method by which specific allergic sensitivities
were determined before the knowledge of IgE.
The serum of a patient with a specific allergy (e.g., to eggs) would be
taken and placed on the marked location on the skin of another,
nonallergic person.
That same spot would be challenged later with the allergen (e.g., the
egg protein) and a wheal-and-flare reaction would be observed.
Given the hazards of transmitting blood-borne disease from serum,
this test is no longer used.
Set point titration:
Set point titration is a method developed by Rinkel in which serial
dilutions of extract are tested using the intradermal method.
Dilutions of allergenic extract increasing in fivefold concentrations are
placed and observed for a wheal reaction.
A set point is defined as the testing dose that initiates an incremental
2 mm increase in the wheal with the fivefold increase in
concentration.
There is controversy over the scientific validity of this testing method.

In Vitro Testing of IgE
Total Serum IgE
99

The test measures total circulating IgE and not the amount of IgE
responsible for clinical symptoms.2
Total serum IgE can be helpful in identifying persons with high likelihood
of atopy but should not be used as a diagnostic or screening test
on its own.
Difficulty of applying total IgE levels is partly due to their variance with
age, especially in the pediatric population, and the considerable overlap
between normal and atopic individuals.
Thus, mildly elevated levels of IgE are not generally helpful.
Usually, levels that are >1,800 IU/mL indicate a likely diagnosis of
atopy, whereas levels <20 IU/mL make diagnosis of atopy unlikely.
Total serum IgE may be elevated in conditions in which the role of IgE is
well understood such as follows:
Asthma
Allergic rhinitis
Eczema
Anaphylaxis from drug, food, or venom
Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
Other conditions with increased total IgE of unknown significance
include:
Tobacco use
Alcoholism
Parasitic infection
HIV
IgE multiple myeloma
Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome
Churg–Strauss vasculitis
Hyper-IgE syndrome (Job’s syndrome)
Pemphigoid
Hodgkin’s disease
Omenn’s syndrome
Severe burns
TABLE 8.3 COMPARISON OF SKIN AND IN VITRO ALLERGY
TESTING

In Vitro Methods of Detecting Antigen-specific IgE
Antigen-specific IgE can also be detected using laboratory techniques.2
Advantages and disadvantages of in vivo (i.e., skin testing, see above)
and in vitro allergy testing can be found in Table 8-3.1,2
All in vitro tests of antigen-specific IgE use the principle of
immunoadsorption.
First, the antigen in question is bound to a solid phase (e.g., a paper
disk, cellulose sponge, or plastic microtiter well plate).
A patient’s serum is incubated with the solid phase.
After washing, a labeled anti-human IgE is incubated with the solid
phase.
After another washing, the amount of labeled anti-IgE is measured
and reported either in absolute IgE units or as a class score.
A class score of 0 is negative, scores in the range 0–1 are considered
indeterminate, and any score >2 is considered positive and should be
correlated with clinical history.
Older methods used radiolabeled reagents to quantify absorbed antigenspecific IgE. This method is called radioallergosorbent test (RAST), a
term that is still used to refer to any method of in vitro quantitation of
antigen-specific IgE.
Radiologic methods for quantitation of antigen-specific IgE have been
largely replaced by fluorescence-based methods.

Diagnostic Testing for Allergic Contact Dermatitis: Patch
Testing
The patch skin test is the most useful tool in identifying the cause of
allergic contact dermatitis.2
Unlike epicutaneous and intradermal skin testing, patch testing is a
measure of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or a cellmediated hypersensitivity reaction.1,2
101

The test artificially attempts to reproduce the patient’s clinical symptoms
and helps determine provocative antigens.2
It has limitations in that the sensitivity and specificity are only
70%, even when performed by the most experienced clinicians.
While antihistamines are not contraindicated, topical corticosteroids
should not be applied to the patch test site for several days before
testing. High dose oral corticosteroids (>20 mg/day of prednisone) may
also lead to false-negative results.
Oral corticosteroids should ideally be discontinued for 1 week
before testing, but sensitivity remains adequate even when chronic
oral steroids are used at a dose of ≤15 mg prednisone per day.
Methods
It is important to determine that the area of skin to be tested is without
irritation or inflammation.1,2
Small amounts of diluted testing materials are placed on small aluminum
disks and are placed on the patient’s back under nonocclusive dressing
with hypoallergenic tape. Each test material’s concentration should be
sufficiently dilute to minimize the chance of an irritant reaction.
Standard testing kits are also available commercially.
Two days after placing patch tests, the patient should return for
removal of the disks and grading of the test areas.
The patient should not bathe, shower, or participate in strenuous
activities until the test site is graded.
The patient should return for a late reading 4–5 days after
original application. The late reading will increase sensitivity because
some reactions may not be evident at the first reading.
Precautions
The application of the patch test may itself sensitize the patient or cause
a flare-up in an already-sensitized patient.1
Patients should be instructed to remove any patch that is causing severe
irritation. Repeated patch testing should be avoided.
Standardized concentrations of test material should be used to avoid an
inflammatory reaction, and thus a false-positive result.
Allergen Panels
Only 28 commercially prepared allergens are FDA-approved in the United
States.
102

There are several patch test kits containing these allergens; one is
described in Table 8-4.6 Note that one component is a negative control.
While the 28 commercially prepared allergens are convenient to use,
they only detect 25–30% of all cases of allergic contact dermatitis. As a
result, the North American Contact Dermatitis Group commonly tests for
65 allergens, but most of these are not FDA-approved and therefore
cannot be commercially purchased.1
Grading
Each reagent is graded on a scale of 0–3 as presented in Table 8-1.1
Grades 1+ and above are considered positive.
False-positive test results may be due to the following:
Skin may be hypersensitive to one of the antigens, and, therefore, the
entire back can become inflamed.
Irritation due to factors other than antigen (i.e., the tape used).
False-negative test results may be due to the following:
Concentration of antigen was too low.
Technical errors in applying the antigen patches.
Late reading at 3–7 days not performed.
Clinical Application of Test Results
It is important to remember that a positive patch skin test result
does not mean diagnosis of causative agent for contact
dermatitis.1
The antigen could be a secondary aggravating factor.
Positive test results should be correlated with clinical history, and, when
possible, the patient should avoid the antigens that caused a positive
reaction.

9 Urticaria and Angioedema
James A. Tarbox
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Urticaria and angioedema are commonly seen conditions of
heterogeneous origin.
A detailed history is the most important factor in determining etiology.
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is quite rare with initial screening showing
a low C4 level.
Nonsedating H1 antihistamines are the main stay of therapy.
While
acute
urticaria/angioedema
is
self-limiting,
chronic
urticaria/angioedema may last years without treatment.

Definition
Urticaria is defined as raised, round areas of edema (wheal)
surrounded by reflex erythema (flare) that involves only the superficial
dermis of the skin.
The lesions are usually pruritic and may develop rapidly. Any single
lesion does not ordinarily last >24 hours.
Angioedema extends into the deep dermis or subcutaneous tissue and
often affects areas of loose connective tissue, such as the face.
Angioedema may be uncomfortable or painful rather than pruritic,
especially when the viscera are involved, and can last for several
days.
Angioedema involving a patient’s larynx can threaten the airway and
lead to asphyxiation.

Classification
Although lesions of urticaria/angioedema are histologically the same
regardless of the cause, differences in etiology and therapy warrant the
classification into acute and chronic syndromes.
The syndrome is defined as acute if the lesions are of <6 weeks
duration.1
Chronic urticaria/angioedema has lesions that have lasted >6 weeks.
106

The syndrome lasts an average of 3–5 years, with 20% of patients still
symptomatic at 20 years.2
In recent years, it has been demonstrated that many patients with
chronic urticaria exhibit autoantibodies directed against the highaffinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor.
In addition to autoimmune urticaria, several physical urticaria
syndromes are important to define, because once diagnosed, no
further workup is usually necessary.

Epidemiology
15–24% of the US population will experience urticaria or angioedema at
some time in their life.1
Urticaria is often a symptom of another allergic disorder such as
anaphylaxis or food allergy.
When presenting as part of another allergic syndrome, urticaria is
generally considered a secondary diagnosis.
Most cases of isolated urticaria are mild and self-limited.
Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is common, affecting about 3% of the
population with an economic and social burden comparable to that seen
with severe coronary artery disease.3
Angioedema occurs in approximately 50% of the cases of chronic
urticaria, while about 10% of the individuals experience angioedema
without hives.4
Chronic urticaria is more common in adults and women.

Etiology
Acute Urticaria and Angioedema
Many infections, especially viral infections, may be accompanied by selflimited urticaria.
Allergic reactions to medications are a common cause of acute urticaria.
Penicillin and cephalosporin class IgE-mediated reactions.
Sulfonamides and platinum-based chemotherapy (i.e.,
oxaliplatin).
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the most
common cause of non–IgE-mediated reactions.
Food allergy is often associated with urticaria. Peanuts, tree nuts, and
shellfish are the most common causes in adults.
107

Insect stings.
Chronic Urticaria and Angioedema
Causes of chronic urticaria and angioedema include5:
CIU
Autoimmune urticaria: Autoimmunity to IgE receptor or IgE:
IgG against IgE or the IgE receptor is reported between 30 and
40%.6
Association with antithyroid antibodies
Physical urticarias and angioedema
Drugs
Food and food additives
Aeroallergens and contactants
Infections
Systemic immune-mediated diseases and vasculitis
If physically induced urticarias are excluded, the incidence of identifying
an external allergen responsible for chronic urticaria is <5%.6
Acquired Angioedema
B-cell lymphoproliferative disease
T-cell lymphoma
Multiple myeloma
Myelofibrosis

Pathophysiology
Acute Urticaria and Angioedema
Acute urticaria caused by a known exposure (e.g., drugs, food, stings) is
caused by cross-linking of antigen-specific IgE on the surface of
mast cells leading to inflammatory mediator release.
Histamine is the principal mediator of urticaria and angioedema;
however, many other mediators, such as prostaglandin D 2, leukotrienes
C and D, platelet-activating factor, and components of the complement
and coagulation cascades, can be involved. This complexity explains
why antihistamines sometimes may not be completely effective.
Although the mast cell is the major effector in all forms of
urticaria and angioedema, other cells, such as the basophil, are also
involved.
Urticaria and angioedema may also result from direct mast cell
108

stimulation (as in reactions to radiocontrast media or opiate drugs), as
well as components of the complement and arachidonic acid pathways.
Autoimmune Chronic Urticaria
Studies have shown a subset of patients with CIU have autoantibodies
directed against the high-affinity IgE receptor, IgE, thyroglobulin, or
thyroperoxidase.
In the majority of patients with CIU no etiology is identified.
Hereditary Angioedema
HAE is caused by lack or dysfunction of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) and is characterized by periodic attacks of angioedema that are
often, but not always, triggered by trauma (i.e., dental surgery).
The majority of patients possess an autosomal dominant mutation in
the gene encoding C1-INH.
Lack of C1-INH results in accumulation of bradykinin, which is the
main mediator responsible symptoms in HAE.
Acquired C1q Angioedema
Development of autoantibodies to C1q results in a clinical syndrome very
similar to HAE, but distinguishable by the lack of C1q.
Urticarial Vasculitis
Immune complex deposition within cutaneous blood vessels can result in
recruitment of complement and cause a leukocytoclastic vasculitis
manifesting as urticaria.

Associated Conditions
Urticarial vasculitis is associated with numerous conditions, including
collagen vascular disease, chronic hepatitis, Lyme disease, myelomas,
and cryoglobulinemias, as well as others.
Anaphylaxis
Thyroid autoimmunity

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Urticaria is characterized by the sudden appearance of wheals and/or
angioedema.7
109

A wheal consists of three typical features:
Central swelling of variable size, almost invariably surrounded by a
reflex erythema
Associated itching or, sometimes, burning sensation
Fleeting nature, with the skin returning to its normal appearance,
usually within 1–24 hours
Angioedema is characterized by:
Sudden, pronounced swelling of the lower dermis and subcutis.
Sometimes pain rather than itching.
Frequent involvement below mucous membranes.
Resolution that is slower than for wheals and can take up to 72 hours.
Acute Urticaria and Angioedema
Drug reactions: All current and recent prescription and over-thecounter medications and herbal supplements must be scrutinized.
The most common drugs causing hives are antibiotics and
opiate analgesics.
ACE inhibitors, nonselective beta-blockers, aspirin, and NSAIDs
may cause or exacerbate urticaria and/or angioedema.
There are sporadic cases of specific NSAIDs causing urticaria, but, in
general, all NSAIDs cross-react.
Food ingestions: Fish, milk, eggs, wheat, soy, nuts, and peanuts are
the most common foods causing urticaria, although a person may
develop an allergy to potentially any food (see Chap. 16).
Physical stimuli: Related to lesions (see the section on Physical
Urticaria Syndromes).
Evidence of infection: Viral hepatitis, mononucleosis, fungal
infections, helminthes (usually accompanied by high eosinophilia) have
all been associated with urticaria. There may be an association between
Helicobacter pylori infection and urticaria, but this relationship remains
controversial.
Aeroallergen: Rarely, patients with seasonal allergies experience
urticaria/angioedema during episodes of high exposure.
Recent sting or insect bite: See Chapter 15.
Food additives: Rare causes of urticaria/angioedema, but reactions to
some food additives and dyes have been reported (see Chapter 16).
Family history of similar lesions: Consider HAE or a familial urticarial
syndrome.
110

Review of systems for collagen vascular disease, hepatic disease,
autoimmune thyroiditis, lymphoproliferative disorders, and malignancy.
The latter two are associated with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency.
Chronic Urticaria
While it is rare to identify a causative antigen in chronic
urticaria, a complete history is essential to rule out environmental
exposures.
Chronic urticaria can occasionally be a symptom of an underlying
systemic disease such as autoimmunity or infection, so evaluating the
patient’s complete medical history is important.
Any single urticarial lesion usually lasts <24 hours.
If lesions last longer, consider urticarial vasculitis, delayed pressure
urticaria or an alternative diagnosis.
Hereditary Angioedema
Characteristic presentation is recurrent swelling beginning in
adolescence.
Can involve nearly any part of the body, including the larynx, and usually
lasts several days.
When involving the viscera, HAE can present similarly to small bowel
obstruction.
Episodes are virtually never associated with urticaria.
There will often, but not always, be a family history angioedema.
Physical Urticarias
Cold urticaria
Seen on cold, exposed areas of skin.
Fatalities have been reported from hypotension occurring while
swimming.
Secondary acquired cold urticaria is related to cryoglobulins resulting
from systemic disease (hepatitis B or C) or lymphoreticular
malignancy.
Cholinergic (heat) urticaria
Related to elevated core temperature from exercise, a hot shower,
or emotional stress.
Lesions are typically tiny and diffuse.
Occurs in approximately 15% of the population.
Severe forms may progress to angioedema and syncope although
111

lesions usually resolve if the patient “cools off.”
Dermographism
Literally “skin writing” is another common form of physical urticaria.
Affects approximately 4% of the population.
Can be elicited on examining by briskly stroking skin with tongue
blade or fingernail.
May confound ability to read allergen skin tests.
Lesions are transitory and respond to suppression with antihistamines.
Delayed pressure urticaria/angioedema
Unlike other physical urticaria, lesions appear 4–6 hours after the
stimulus of pressure.
Mediators are thought to be similar to late-phase reactants rather
than histamine.
Poorly responsive to antihistamines; systemic steroids may be needed
to control severely afflicted patients.
Vibratory urticaria
Rare disorder usually occurs in patients exposed to persistent
vibrations, such as drills or pneumatic hammers.
Solar urticaria
The history usually establishes the diagnosis of this very rare disorder.
Different categories depending on wavelength of light-producing
symptoms.
Aquagenic urticaria
This form of physical urticaria is exceedingly rare.
Patients react to a wet compress regardless of its temperature.
Other Urticarias
Exercise-induced urticaria
Different from cholinergic urticaria in that it is not related to core
body temperature.
Lesions are typically urticarial and progress to anaphylaxis.
In some patients, the ingestion of a specific food before exercise is
necessary (e.g., celery) to trigger the reaction, although eating before
exercise in general will worsen symptoms in most patients.
Urticarial vasculitis
Examination usually reveals lesions in dependent areas.
Other signs of vasculitis, such as petechiae and palpable purpura, are
often evident.
112

Lesions tend to last >24 hours and be more painful than pruritic.
Differential Diagnosis
Erythema multiforme minor: Lesions persist rather than wax/wane.
Lesions are usually preceded by a prodrome of constitutional symptoms.
Bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis: Initial
presentation may be similar but the formation of bullae rules out
urticaria.
Mastocytosis: Characteristic lesions of urticaria pigmentosa,
mastocytoma, and telangiectasia eruptive macularis perstans (TEMP)
(see Chap. 19).
Muckle–Wells
syndrome:
A
rare
autosomal
dominant
autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by sensorineural deafness,
recurrent urticaria, fevers, arthritis, and amyloidosis.
Schnitzler’s syndrome: Usually presents with chronic nonpruritic
urticaria, recurrent fever, and arthritis and is accompanied by a
monoclonal gammopathy.
Gleich’s syndrome (episodic angioedema with eosinophilia):
Characterized by episodic angioedema with findings of an IgM
gammopathy and eosinophilia on laboratory testing.

Diagnostic Testing
Acute urticaria
Cause of episode, if identifiable, is usually established by history.
When caused by a food or medication, the presence of an antigenspecific IgE, demonstrated by either in vivo or in vitro testing (see
Chap. 8), confirms diagnosis.
Food diaries may be helpful in direct specific IgE tests.
Autoimmune chronic urticaria
A subset of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria have
autoantibodies directed against the high-affinity IgE receptor,
thyroglobulin, or thyroperoxidase. The CU Index (anti-FcεRI
antibody) can be used to demonstrate the presence of
autoantibodies that potentially could cause chronic urticaria.
In some patients, autologous skin testing (using the patient’s serum)
is positive. However, this is not diagnostic, as these autoantibodies
can be seen in other disease states and in some normal patients.
Other laboratories often sent to rule out systemic illnesses causing
113

disease include: antithyroid antibodies against thyroperoxidase and
thyroglobulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), complete blood
count (CBC), urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), liver
function tests, and antinuclear antibodies (ANA).
Urticarial vasculitis: A punch biopsy is necessary to make the
diagnosis and will show leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
HAE: Diagnosis is made by an initial screening C4 level that is always
low and can drop to undetectable levels during an attack.
If the C4 level is low, obtain a C1 inhibitor level. In approximately 15–
20% of patients, the level is normal, but the protein is not functional,
and a functional assay must be performed.
Acquired angioedema: A low C1q level combined with low C1 inhibitor
and C4 levels warrants an investigation for an occult malignancy,
because this disorder is associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. It
is also rarely associated with connective tissue disease.
Cold urticaria: Test with an ice cube on forearm for 3 minutes; the
lesions seen on re-warming.
Cholinergic (heat) urticaria: Test by running vigorously in place for
10 minutes or submersion in warm water.
Dermographism: Briskly stroke skin with tongue blade or fingernail.
Note linear lesions from excoriation on exam.
Pressure urticaria/angioedema: Test with 15 lb weight in a sling
over forearm.
Vibratory urticaria: Test by holding patient’s forearm on a lab vortex
for 4 minutes or using a tuning fork.

TREATMENT
Urticaria and Angioedema
Choice of treatment depends on the etiology of the lesions. It may
involve avoidance (as in NSAIDs or opiates), treatment of an underlying
condition (such as thyroid replacement for autoimmune thyroiditis), or
medications.
Treatment for physical urticarias includes avoiding triggers of the
underlying disorder.
For both chronic and acute forms of urticaria angioedema, avoidance of
possible triggers, when identified, is a key to treatment.
114

Second-generation (nonsedating) H1 blocking antihistamines are firstline medication in treatment of symptomatic urticaria and angioedema
(Appendix A, Table A-1).
Self-injectable epinephrine should be prescribed for any patient with
airway compromising angioedema.
First-generation (sedating) H1 blocking antihistamines (Appendix A,
Table A-1) are often helpful, particularly if symptoms are worse at night.
Doxepin, a tricyclic antidepressant with strong antihistaminic effects, is
often used for nighttime symptoms.
The typical starting dose is 10 mg at bedtime.
Doxepin can be very sedating; caution regarding daytime somnolence
and slowed reaction times is warranted.
Second-line medications include the following:
H2 blocking antihistamines
Ranitidine: 150 mg twice daily
Cimetidine: 400 mg twice daily (use with caution because of
medication interactions)
Leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast)
Many patients with urticaria require more than one class of
medication to control their symptoms (e.g., H1 antihistamine in
combination with H2 antihistamines).
A short burst of prednisone can often eradicate symptoms but has
numerous, well-documented side effects. Therefore, steroids should be
used in severe cases or in cases refractory to antihistamines.
The dose and course should be high enough and long enough to
control symptoms.
Tapering steroids is not necessary to prevent adrenal suppression for
short courses but can be helpful to determine if symptoms have
remitted and to achieve the lowest effective dose.
Typical doses are 40–60 mg/day for severe exacerbations.
Patients should be adequately counseled regarding side effects
associated with steroids.
Cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor often used to prevent transplant
rejection, has been shown to have efficacy in treating both chronic
idiopathic and autoimmune urticaria.8
Cyclosporine should only be used by experienced clinicians.
CBC, complete metabolic profile (CMP), urinalysis, and cyclosporine
115

trough levels must be routinely monitored.
Dapsone, plaquenil, and other immunosuppressive agents have been
used with varying success for chronic urticaria refractory to other
treatments.

Hereditary Angioedema
The approach to treatment of HAE is distinct from allergic angioedema.
Acute management of HAE is directed at stabilizing the patient and
reducing the extent of swelling.
Angioedema involving the airway is a major mortality risk for patients
with HAE.
Elective intubation must be considered if swelling is involving the
airway.
Fluid resuscitation may be necessary due to third spacing.
Medications for acute HAE attacks include:
Human C1-INH (Berinert), which is a plasma-derived concentrate
of C1-INH, is an FDA-approved for treatment of acute abdominal or
facial attacks of HAE.9
Ecallantide (Kalbitor) is a reversible inhibitor of plasma kallikrein
that has been shown to be effective for acute attacks of swelling in
HAE.10
Debate exists regarding the use of fresh frozen plasma during an
acute attack, as this has been seen to worsen symptoms in a few
patients.
Epinephrine has often been used for attacks, but there are no
studies to support its efficacy.
The use of antihistamines and corticosteroids are of little
value.
Chronic treatment of HAE focuses on preventing angioedema episodes.
Synthetic androgenic steroids (danazol or stanozolol) increase the
synthesis of C1 inhibitor and can prevent angioedema episodes.
Despite having attenuated virilizing side effects, these agents can
have side effects and should not be used in pregnant woman.
Fibrinolytic agents (such as ε-aminocaproic acid) have also been
shown to ameliorate symptoms. Unfortunately, this therapy also
carries the risk of numerous side effects.
Human C1-INH (Cinryze) is also approved to help prevent
116

angioedema attacks in teenagers and adults with HAE.11

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The prognosis of urticaria depends on its etiology.
Patients with acute urticaria from an identifiable exposure have an
excellent prognosis with strict avoidance of the provoking antigen.
In cases of acute urticaria without identifiable cause, most patients have
resolution of symptoms within 6 weeks of onset. A small subset of these
patients will go on to develop CIU.
Most patients with CIU have eventual resolution of their symptoms—
usually over the course of years. Cyclosporine may speed the resolution
of chronic urticaria.
Patient with unexplained or difficult to manage acute
urticaria/angioedema and chronic urticaria/angioedema should be
referred to allergy and immunology for further management.

10 Atopic Dermatitis
Amanda Trott
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic skin disease of young
children, affecting 17% of US schoolchildren and a significant number of
adults.1
Both skin and immune system genes play a key role, and immune
defects may result in colonization and infection by microbial organisms.

Definition
AD is a chronically relapsing skin disease that is usually associated
with respiratory allergy. It involves the local infiltration of T H2 cells (see
Chapter 2), which is the same type of inflammatory response seen in
asthma and allergic rhinitis.
AD can result in significant morbidity, and the cause remains unknown,
although it is understood to involve a complex interrelationship of
genetic, environmental, immunologic, and epidermal mechanisms.

Epidemiology
AD affects a higher proportion of children than adults.
90% of patients with AD develop symptoms before the age of 5.1
The majority of children affected by AD appear to outgrow this
inflammatory skin disease.2
Multiple studies suggest that the population percentage affected by AD
is on the rise.
A Japanese study found a twofold increase in AD prevalence in 9- to
12-year olds when compared to similarly aged children examined 20
years earlier.3
This increased frequency is not unique to AD and is paralleled by
increase in the prevalence of other atopic diseases, such as allergic
rhinitis and asthma.
Possible reasons for this include greater exposure to pollutants and
119

indoor allergens, decreased breast-feeding, and increased awareness
of AD.

Etiology
Genetics of AD are complex, and research is evolving our understanding
of AD.
Compromise of the epidermal barrier, which can occur through various
mechanisms, is thought to lead to increased water loss and facilitates
entry of allergens and microbes.
Mutations in filaggrin, a protein involved in keratinization of the skin
and in barrier function maintenance, have been demonstrated to be a
major predisposing factor for a significant subset of patients with AD.4
Mutations in protease inhibitors (SPINK5) are also linked to AD. These
mutations are thought to lead an imbalance of proteolytic activity
that results in barrier compromise.5
Most patients with AD have an atopic predisposition and develop an
immunoglobulin E (IgE) response to common environmental allergens.
Elevated IgE and positive reaction to allergens upon skin testing are
seen in up to 85% of patients with AD.1
Atopy results in overproduction of TH2-type cytokines, resulting in
eosinophilia.
Allergic inflammation causes intrinsic hyperreactivity of
inflammatory cells resulting in lower threshold for irritation.
Exposure to food allergens and aeroallergens can cause exacerbations
in some patients with AD.
AD predominantly of the head and neck is often associated with
positive testing to certain fungal organisms and may improve with
antifungal therapy.
The majority of patients with severe AD have IgE against human
proteins (autoantigens).

Pathophysiology
The immunologic basis for AD is supported by evidence showing patients
with primary immunodeficiency disorders whose eczema either corrects
after bone marrow transplant, or who develop AD after successful
engraftment from an atopic donor.
Additionally, there are immunoregulatory differences seen in patients
120

with AD.6
T cells produce more interleukin (IL)-4 and express higher levels of IL4 receptor.
Increased numbers of TH2 cells secreting IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 after
allergen exposure, resulting in:
Inhibition of interferon (IFN)-γ production by mononuclear cells.
Increased IgE synthesis by B cells.
Migration, differentiation, and proliferation of eosinophils.
Inflammation in AD is characterized by:
Monocytes secreting more prostaglandin E2 and IL-10, both of which
inhibit IFN-γ (a TH1 cytokine).
Langerhans cells and macrophages infiltrating into the skin lesion with
surface-bound IgE. These cells do not typically have surface IgE in
patients without AD.
Neutrophils are absent in skin biopsies of AD, which is a result of
defective chemotactic activity. This partially explains the increased
frequency of cutaneous infections.
Activated eosinophils are typically prominent in chronic AD lesions.
Keratinocytes secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as thymic
stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), while also producing reduced amounts
of antimicrobial peptides.7
Reduced production of antimicrobial peptide and cytokines predisposes
patients to greater infection and colonization with Staphylococcus
aureus, viruses, and fungi.8
IgE has multiple roles in AD:
Immediate response of pruritus and erythema after allergen exposure
is a result of degranulation of mast cells bearing allergen-specific IgE.
Antigen presentation is potentiated by epidermal Langerhans cells
expressing IgE on their surface.
Chronic inflammation in AD is the result of multiple factors:
Repeated exposure to allergens leads to TH2-type cell expansion.
Monocytes in patients with AD have lower incidence of apoptosis,
which results in increased production of factors promoting TH2-type
inflammatory response.
Allergen-induced inflammation alters corticosteroid receptor binding
affinity, which blunts the antiinflammatory effects of corticosteroids.
Scratching injures keratinocytes, leading to their cytokine release and
121

attraction of cells to the inflammatory site.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
Atopic diseases tend to cluster in individuals and in families, so
careful history taking regarding such diseases is very helpful.
Major risk factors for AD include either a family or personal history of
atopic conditions, including AD, asthma, food allergy, and allergic
rhinitis.
These four conditions are often referred to as the “allergic march of
childhood.”
AD and food allergy typically appear first and reach their highest
prevalence within the first 2 years after birth.
Careful history taking for identification of environmental exposures
that worsen symptoms is an important part of the history.
Physical Examination
Unaffected skin usually appears dry.
There are no pathognomonic skin lesions.
Acute AD is intensely pruritic and manifests with erythematous
papules with excoriations, vesicles, and serous exudate.
Chronic AD demonstrates thickened skin with lichenification and
fibrotic papules.
Distribution is usually a characteristic feature of AD.
In infants the face, scalp, and extensor surfaces of extremities are
affected with sparing of the diaper area.
In children, involvement of the infragluteal area is common.
In older patients, involvement of the flexural folds of extremities,
hands, and feet are common.

Diagnostic Criteria
The diagnosis of AD is based on the presence of a constellation of
clinical features.
Major features:
Pruritus (presence critical for diagnosis).
Facial and extensor involvement in infants and children.
122

Flexural lichenification in adults.
Chronic or relapsing dermatitis.
Personal or family history of atopy.
Minor features:
Xerosis.
Cutaneous infections.
Nonspecific dermatitis of the hands or feet.
Ichthyosis.
Palmar hyperlinearity.
Keratosis pilaris.
Pityriasis alba.
Nipple eczema.
Anterior subcapsular cataracts.
Elevated serum IgE levels.
Positive immediate-type allergy skin tests.

Differential Diagnosis
Immunodeficiency should be considered, especially when AD presents in
infancy:
Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked
(IPEX) syndrome.
Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome.
Hyper-IgE syndrome.
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).
Chronic dermatoses can often be differentiated from AD by history:
Seborrheic dermatitis.
Contact dermatitis.
Nummular eczema.
Lichen simplex chronicus.
Infections:
Scabies.
HIV.
Malignancy:
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma should be ruled out in an adult without
history of childhood eczema.

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
123

Laboratory tests are of limited value in diagnosis and management of
AD. There are no definitive diagnostic laboratories for AD.
Total IgE is frequently elevated in AD (but may be normal).
Complete blood count (CBC) may show eosinophilia.
Food-specific IgE concentrations do not identify the type or severity of
the reaction and are therefore not very helpful in AD.
In vitro measurement of antigen-specific IgE may occasionally be
necessary if skin tests are not feasible or contraindicated (e.g., diffuse
skin lesions or strong history of food-induced anaphylaxis).
Diagnostic Procedures
Immediate hypersensitivity skin testing can be important in identifying
environmental allergens contributing to comorbid conditions such as
allergic rhinitis.
In scenarios where a food antigen is suspected of contributing to AD,
skin testing can be useful.
Negative testing with proper controls has a high predictive
value for ruling out a suspected allergen (i.e., excellent
negative predictive value).
In contrast, positive tests have a poor correlation with clinical
symptoms in suspected food allergen–induced AD.
Positive skin tests to foods suspected of contributing to AD should be
confirmed
with
a double-blind, placebo-controlled food
challenge, unless there is a history of anaphylaxis to the suspected
food.

TREATMENT
Medications
First Line
Corticosteroids work primarily as an antiinflammatory medication.
They are effective for reducing inflammation and pruritus in both the
acute and the chronic forms of AD.
The agent with the lowest effective potency should be used.
Although side effects of appropriately used low- to medium-potency
topical corticosteroids are infrequent, problems such as thinning of the
skin and hypopigmentation may occur, especially on the face and
intertriginous areas.
124

If a high-potency corticosteroid is indicated for a short time period, the
patient must be provided with a lower-potency option for maintenance
therapy to avoid flares.
Once control is achieved with a daily corticosteroid regimen, twice
weekly application of the corticosteroid to the previously
involved areas results in fewer relapses.9
Once daily treatment has shown to be effective with fluticasone
propionate as well as mometasone furoate.
Topical steroids are available in various bases, but ointments have
been shown to provide the best medication delivery while
preventing evaporative losses.
Inadequate prescription size leads to suboptimally controlled AD.
Topical steroids also decrease S. aureus colonization in patients with
AD.10
Systemic corticosteroids should be avoided, as they are often
associated with significant flaring after discontinuation.
Second Line
Topical calcineurin inhibitors:
These include tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream.
Although some patients complain of a transient burning sensation,
these medications are not associated with skin atrophy and are
therefore especially useful for treatment of the face and intertriginous
regions.
Studies have shown that treatment with pimecrolimus cream upon
early signs of AD results in a significantly decreased incidence of
flares and need for topical corticosteroid rescue.11
Tar:
Crude coal tar extracts have antiinflammatory properties that, when
used with topical corticosteroids in chronic AD, may reduce the need
for more potent corticosteroids.
Tar shampoos are often beneficial when the scalp is involved.
Oral cyclosporine A: Placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated
benefit of oral cyclosporine A in adults with severe AD.12
Azathioprine:
Azathioprine is a systemic immunosuppressive agent that has been
shown to be effective for severe recalcitrant AD.12
Its use is limited by a number of side effects and slow onset of action.
125

It is metabolized by thiopurine methyltransferase, so deficiency of this
enzyme should be ruled out before initiation of treatment.
Antiinfective Therapy
AD secondarily infected with S. aureus must be treated with 7–10 days
of either semi-synthetic penicillins or first- or second-generation
cephalosporins.
If the area involved is localized, topical mupirocin applied three times
daily for 7–10 days may be effective.
Intranasal application of topical mupirocin twice daily for 5 days may
reduce nasal carriage.
Disseminated eczema herpeticum should be treated with systemic
acyclovir.
Superficial dermatophytosis can usually be treated with topical
antifungal agents.
Antipruritic Agents
Systemic antihistamines and anxiolytics are especially useful
evening.
Doxepin binds histamine receptors and can be given to adults
bed.
Second-generation antihistamines have shown only modest
benefit in treating the pruritus associated with AD.
Topical antihistamines and topical anesthetics should be avoided
the risk of sensitization.

in the
before
clinical
due to

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Trigger Avoidance
Irritants are chemicals or other exposures that can nonspecifically
worsen AD (IgE-independent).
Use cleansers with minimal defatting activity and a neutral pH rather
than soaps.
Launder new clothing before wearing to reduce chemical content.
Use a liquid rather than a powder detergent and add an extra rinse
cycle.
Clothing should be cotton or cotton-blend and avoidance of occlusive
clothing is important.
Avoid temperatures resulting in sweating.
126

Shower and wash with a mild soap immediately after swimming in a
pool to remove pool chemicals, immediately followed by application
of moisturizer.
Nonsensitizing sunscreen should be used before sun exposure, and
products developed for use on the face are often best tolerated by
patients with AD.
Prolonged sun exposure can result in exacerbation due to evaporative
losses and sweating.
When a specific antigen is identified that worsens AD, allergen
avoidance can be effective.
If a specific food is implicated in a controlled challenge, avoidance
results in clinical improvement.13
90% of the food allergens found to exacerbate AD that include milk,
egg, peanut, soy, wheat, and fish.
Extensive elimination diets are a bad idea. Even patients with
multiple positive allergy tests are rarely clinically sensitive to more
than three foods on challenge.
Patients with dust mite allergen-specific IgE often demonstrate
improvement in their AD after taking measures to reduce dust mite
exposure.
Hydration
Skin hydration is essential since atopic skin shows enhanced water loss
and reduced water-binding capacity.
An effective method for improving skin hydration is to soak skin for 10
minutes in warm water, then apply an occlusive agent within a few
minutes to retain the absorbed water. For soaking of the face and neck,
apply a warm wet washcloth.
Bleach baths with one-half cup bleach per full bathtub have been
recommended to reduce skin infections.14
Moisturizers also have an important role in improving skin hydration.
Lotions have higher water content than creams, resulting in more
drying of the skin due to an evaporative effect.
Because moisturizers should be applied multiple times daily on a
long-term basis, cost is an obvious concern.
Petroleum jelly is an inexpensive option that is especially effective
as an occlusive to seal in water after bathing.

127

Wet-Wrap Dressings
These dressings work by cooling the skin, providing a barrier to
scratching, and enhancing penetration of topical corticosteroids.15
Wet-wrap dressings are most effective when covered with dry dressings
or clothing and is often best tolerated at bedtime.
Phototherapy
Ultraviolet (UV) light therapy can be useful for chronic recalcitrant AD.
Some patients benefit from moderate amounts of natural sunlight.
Photochemotherapy with oral methoxypsoralen followed by UV-A may be
helpful in patients with severe AD who do not tolerate topical steroids.

COMPLICATIONS
Eye:
Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is characterized by bilateral eye itching,
burning, tearing, and mucoid discharge. It can result in visual
impairment from corneal scarring.
Keratoconus is a conical corneal deformity due to persistent rubbing.
Left untreated keratoconus may lead to formation of anterior
subcapsular cataracts.
Hand: Nonspecific irritant hand dermatitis is common in AD; irritated
by repeated wetting.
Infections:
AD confers an increased susceptibility to viruses, including herpes
simplex virus (HSV), molluscum contagiosum, and human papilloma
virus (HPV).
Patients are also at risk for superimposed dermatophytosis.
S. aureus colonizes the skin of >90% of patients with AD, compared
to 5% of normal subjects. This can result in recurrent staphylococcal
pustulosis but invasive S. aureus infections are rare.

11 Allergic Contact Dermatitis
Olajumoke O. Fadugba
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Contact dermatitis is an eczematous rash that develops after the skin is
in contact with a topical offending agent. The agent may directly or
indirectly cause injury to the skin.
There are two categories of contact dermatitis, which include irritant
contact dermatitis (ICD) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).

Definition
ICD results from direct injury to the skin and is not
immunologically mediated. Typical agents that lead to this rash
include acids, bases, and exposure to chronically wet environment,
soaps and detergents.
ACD is an immunologically mediated reaction that requires an
initial exposure to a substance. The most common causative agents are
plants of the Rhus genus (poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac).

Epidemiology
Prevalence of ACD in the general population is 20%.1
Occupational ACD has a 12-month prevalence of 1,700 per 100,000
workers in one study.2

Pathophysiology
ACD results from a type IV hypersensitivity reaction (see Chapter 2) that
is mediated by a T-cell pathway. Unlike many allergic diseases, ACD
elicits a TH1 type of response.
There are two phases, which include a sensitization phase and an
elicitation phase.
Sensitization phase:
Sensitization begins when a topical antigen comes into contact with
the skin.
Typically molecules that are <500 Da result in ACD because the
131

insulting agent must be small enough to penetrate the horny layer of
the skin and enter into the stratum corneum.3
Once the antigen penetrates the skin, the antigen comes in contact
with Langerhans cells or other antigen-presenting cells.
Langerhans cells are then drained by the lymphatic system to local
lymph nodes where they become opposed to helper T lymphocytes.3
T cells then proliferate via clonal expansion and eventually memory T
cells are created.
The production of memory T cells can take 4–7 days, and an individual
can stay sensitized for several years.
Elicitation phase:
The elicitation phase begins when patients are re-exposed to the
allergen resulting in activation of local sensitized CD4+ T
lymphocytes.
Several proinflammatory mediators are activated such as interleukin
(IL)-1, IL-2, interferon (IFN)-γ leading to chemoattraction of
macrophages, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils to the area of
exposure. This leads to the typical eczematous rash associated with
contact dermatitis.

Risk Factors
Patients who have a history of atopic dermatitis or ICD are at increased
risk of developing ACD.
Also, patients with ACD are at increased risk of developing ICD in their
occupational environment.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
The most common chief complaint of patient presenting with ACD is
pruritus.
Many patients develop an erythematous rash that progresses to papules
after coming into contact with the allergen.
Symptoms typically develop 4–72 hours after exposure to the allergen.
The clinician should investigate over what course of time did the rash
develop and/or change, has the rash occurred before, where has the
132

rash occurred, if there is any improvement in the rash when the
patient is on vacation or away from work/home.
A thorough review of the patient’s occupation, travel, social, and medical
history is necessary to identify any possible exposures to common
allergens. This should include any leisure activities the patient partakes.
There are several allergens that commonly cause ACD and include the
f o l l o w i n g : Poison
ivy,
nickel,
fragrances,
latex,
paraphenylenediamine (found in dyes and rubber), and neomycin.2
Physical Examination
ACD can occur on any part of the body.
Areas of thin skin such as eyes, neck, and genitalia are the most
susceptible to ACD.
The areas that are most resistant to sensitization include the palms,
soles, and scalp.
The most characteristic feature of the rash is to occur at the site of
contact with the allergen.
The appearance of the rash depends on the time of presentation.
Initially, an area or erythema develops followed by eruption of papules
or vesicles.
Eventually the vesicle will involute and crusting and scaling will
develop.
Patients that are chronically exposed to an allergy develop
lichenification, painful fissuring, and thickening of the skin.
Distribution and pattern of the rash is very important to note on physical
examination as this provides clues as to which allergen contributes to
the rash.
Eczematous rash localized to earlobes or wrist indicates possible nickel
allergy found in jewelry.
Linear patterned rashes are usually caused by poison ivy.
Involvement of head and neck suggest possible cosmetics, hair dyes,
or relaxers.
If the rash is only found under areas where clothes are in contact
suggests a reaction to allergen found in textiles.
Undergarments and shoes are made of rubber products and patients
will have rashes located in these respective areas.
Systemically administered medications can cross react with topically
applied medications leading to generalized ACD.
133

Differential Diagnosis
Other conditions that can have an appearance similar to ACD include:2
Seborrheic dermatitis.
Nummular eczema.
Dyshidrotic eczema.
Atopic dermatitis (see Chapter 10).
ICD.

Diagnostic Testing
Patch testing can aid in the diagnosis of ACD.
Patch testing involves placing patch(es) containing a small amount of
the allergen on the patient’s back.
Commercially available preparations for patch testing that use
amounts of allergen considered to be nonirritating.
After a minimum of 48 hours and up to 7 days, the patch is removed
and the degree of inflammation (if any) is assessed.
A positive patch test is one where there is evidence of inflammation at
the patch site and indicates the patient has been sensitized to the
allergen.
Results of a patch test should be interpreted in the setting of the
patient’s history.
Often, the suspected offending agent is not available for patch testing.
In these cases, elimination of the trigger from the patient’s environment
can be diagnostic and therapeutic.

TREATMENT
The first-line therapy of ACD is to identify and avoid the triggering
allergen.
There are several topical medications that are used in order to treat
aggravating symptoms.

Medications
Localized acute ACD on the body can be treated with topical
corticosteroid creams such as triamcinolone or clobetastol.
Cream-based topical steroids are preferable as they have a more
drying effect than ointments.3
134

Caution should be used when using topical steroids as they can thin
skin.
Systemic steroids should be considered in severe cases of ACD that
involve large areas of skin.
Oral antihistaminic medications maybe needed during the first days of
starting either systemic or topical steroids, especially for patients having
difficulty sleeping secondary to severe pruritis.
All these medications are symptomatic treatments. To prevent the rash
from occurring, the patient should avoid triggering agents.

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Cool, moist compresses can provide a soothing effect to areas with
weepy lesions.3
Oatmeal baths can help in symptomatic control of ACD affecting large
areas of skin.3
Drying antipruritic lotions such as calamine lotion can be used on
localized ACD.
Topical antihistamines and anesthetics should be avoided as these
agents can lead to sensitization.

12 Ocular Allergic Disease
Gregg J. Berdy and Susan S. Berdy
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Ocular allergic diseases can be considered a spectrum of diseases ranging
from mild itching and redness associated with seasonal allergic
conjunctivitis to severe blinding sequelae secondary to atopic
keratoconjunctivitis.

Definition
Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated inflammation of the conjunctivae, clear
membrane that covers the sclera and lines the eyelids.

Classification
Ocular allergic conditions may be classified as follows:1
Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC)
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), palpebral or limbal
Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC)
Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC)

Epidemiology
Approximately 20–30% (60–90 million people) of the population of the
United States suffer from ocular allergic diseases.

Etiology
Genetic predisposition for atopy and formation of specific IgE after
exposure to environmental allergens.

Pathophysiology
SAC is the prototype of the group of diseases that begins as an
antigen–IgE antibody interaction on the surface of the
conjunctival mast cells.2
The allergen binds two separate IgE molecules, creating a dimer
formation (cross-linking) that initiates the chain of reactions on the mast
136

cell plasma membrane.
Cross-linking of the IgE causes the release of preformed mediators (e.g.,
histamine) and newly formed mediators produced via metabolism of
arachidonic acid (AA).
Metabolism of AA produces prostaglandins via the cyclooxygenase
pathway and leukotrienes via the lipoxygenase pathway.
Conjunctival surface contains both H1 and H2 histamine receptors.
Histamine binding to the H1 receptor results in symptoms of ocular
itching.
Histamine binding to the H2 receptors produces vasodilation of
conjunctival vessels.
Other mediators:
Eosinophils release major basic protein (MBP) that has been
demonstrated to cause epithelial toxicity.
Lymphocytes release interleukins that is involved in further
recruitment of inflammatory cells and their release of inflammatory
mediators.
T-lymphocyte abnormalities have been demonstrated in AKC
(TH1) and VKC (TH2).

Risk Factors
SAC:
Family history of atopy.
70% of patients have an associated atopic disease, such as allergic
rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis.
VKC:
Usually seen in children aged 4–18 years.
Boys are affected more frequently than girls.
Affected individuals usually live in warm to hot windy climate.
Strong family history of atopic disease.
AKC:
Chronic disease usually seen in patients aged 50–60 years.
Long history of eczema or atopic dermatitis.
GPC:
Chronic inflammatory disorder.
Exogenous materials causing chronic inflammation of the upper tarsal
conjunctival surface.
137

Most cases are secondary to soft contact lens wear, but ocular
prostheses and nylon sutures used in ophthalmic surgical procedures
may be an etiologic agent.

Associated Conditions
Allergic rhinitis
Asthma

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis can be made by taking a careful history and performing
epicutaneous skin testing with environmental allergens to either confirm
or exclude the presence of allergic sensitization.
Physical examination of the eyes, including assessment of the eyelids,
conjunctivae and quality of tears that are formed, and slit lamp
examination where warranted.

Clinical Presentation
History
SAC:
Bilateral red, itching eyes associated with tearing and burning.
Occasionally unilateral response may occur when there has been
hand-to-eye contact with allergen (e.g., cat dander).
VKC:
Typically young boy will present with marked itching associated with a
stringy, ropy mucus discharge.
Severe cases may be associated with photophobia, pain, and
decreased visual ​acuity.
AKC: Chronic year-round itching; associated with burning, light
sensitivity, ​tearing, and chronic redness of the eyes.
GPC:
Patients complain of chronic irritation, redness, and itching.
Decreased wearing time of contact lenses.
Increasing mucus discharge associated with pain, tearing, and
conjunctival ​redness.
Physical Examination
SAC:
138

Edematous and erythematous periocular tissues.
Conjunctiva with mild to moderate chemosis with mucous discharge in
the tear film.
Cornea is rarely involved.
VKC:
Edematous and ptotic upper eyelid.
Corneal examination may reveal superficial infiltrates and in severe
cases shield ulcers, which are epithelial defects with plaque-like
deposition of material at the base, centrally located just above the
visual axis.
Palpebral VKC:
Upper tarsal surface develops large raised cobblestone papillae,
which are pathognomonic of the disease.
Papillae appear injected and commonly have mucus strands running
in the crevices.
Limbal VKC:
Lid eversion reveals Horner’s points–Tranta’s dots.
These are aggregations of eosinophils and grossly appear as
gelatinous elevations with whitish inclusions located at the limbus.
AKC:
Eczematoid changes of the upper and lower eyelids, induration,
erythema, and scaling.
Slit lamp examination reveals marked plugging of the meibomian
gland orifices with purulent secretions and a concurrent poor
precorneal tear film.
Bulbar conjunctiva may show mild to moderate injection and changes
consistent with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) (dry eye).
Severe cases may result in conjunctival subepithelial fibrosis and
symblepharon formation.
Tarsal conjunctival surfaces usually reveal mild to moderate injection.
Corneal involvement in AKC may vary according to the severity of
disease.
In mild forms the cornea may show minimal punctate staining with
fluorescein dye.
Severe cases demonstrate marked surface irregularity with
epithelial desiccation associated with corneal neovascularization,
keratinization, and scarring.
139

GPC:
Examination may reveal minimal pathology.
Hyperemia and giant papillae may develop with chronic trauma to
the upper tarsal conjunctival surfaces.
Papillae are result of chronic collagen deposition and tend to be more
uniformly distributed, smaller, and flatter in appearance than those
seen in the cobblestone appearance of patients with VKC.
With disease progression, cornea may show diffuse punctate keratitis
or even corneal epithelial abrasions.

Differential Diagnosis
Viral conjunctivitis:3
Usually characterized by an acute onset of a unilateral red eye
associated with preauricular lymph node.
Patients complain of matting of the eyelids with clear to mucopurulent
discharge.
Examination of the tarsal conjunctivae reveals a follicular appearance.
Infection often spreads to the opposite eye 3–9 days later.
May have concurrent upper respiratory infection.
Bacterial conjunctivitis:
Usually characterized by an acute onset of a unilateral or bilateral red
eye associated with eyelid erythema.
Patients complain of matting of the eyelashes with yellow to green
purulent discharge.
Examination of the tarsal conjunctivae reveals a papillary appearance.
Chlamydial conjunctivitis:
Usually characterized by an indolent, chronic onset of at least 6 weeks
of a unilateral or bilateral mildly red eye.
Examination of the tarsal conjunctivae reveals a mixed follicular and
papillary appearance.
Noninfectious:
Contact dermatitis.
Drug-induced allergic contact dermatitis.
KCS, dry eye syndrome.
Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), blepharitis.

TREATMENT
140

Identify and remove the offending allergen.
Prevent circulating allergens from interacting with conjunctival mast
cells.
Diluting antigen load with tear substitutes.
Immunotherapy.
Suppress cellular and extracellular inflammation with concomitant
redness (vascular dilation) and chemosis (edema) using vasoconstrictor
agents, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and steroidal
agents.

13 Anaphylaxis
Sydney Leibel
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening multi-organ hypersensitivity
reaction of rapid onset.1
Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency.

Epidemiology
There are an estimated 700 fatal anaphylactic reactions per
year in the United States.
In many of these cases, epinephrine was unfortunately never
administered.
Incidence of 50–200 episodes/100,000 person/years. Lifetime prevalence
of 0.05–2%.2
True incidence is unknown due to under-diagnosis and under-reporting.

Etiology
Broadly, the causes of anaphylaxis are divided into immunoglobulin E
(IgE)-dependent and IgE-independent (formerly called anaphylactoid)
mechanisms.3
IgE-mediated mechanisms include:
Medications (Chap. 14)
Insect bites and stings (Chap. 15)
Foods (Chap. 16)
Latex (Chap. 17)
Allergen immunotherapy (Chap. 21)
Others (e.g., seminal fluid)
IgE-independent mechanisms:
Radiocontrast medium (Chap. 14)
Opioid medications
Vancomycin
Aspirin/nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Scombroid fish poisoning
145

Blood products (e.g., in immunoglobulin A-deficient patients)
Idiopathic
Mastocytosis can also manifest with anaphylaxis.

Pathophysiology
Anaphylaxis is a type I or immediate hypersensitivity reaction (Chap. 2).
It is elicited by the cross-linking of allergen-specific IgE bound to
the surface of mast cells and basophils by allergens leading to
the release of preformed and synthesized chemical mediators.4
Cross-linking promotes the immediate (5–30 minute) release of
granule-associated preformed mediators: Histamine, tryptase,
carboxypeptidase A, chymase, and proteoglycans.
In addition, there is synthesis of newly generated mediators:
Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, sphingosine 1-phosphate, platelet
activating factor, and cytokines interleukin (IL) 6, IL33, and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α over a period of 2–6 hours.
Other mechanisms include complement breakdown products (C3a, C4a,
C5a) and the contact system activation bradykinin.

Risk Factors
History of prior anaphylaxis.
Parenteral exposure to antigen is associated with higher risk of
anaphylaxis compared to ingestion.
Intermittent exposure to antigen.
Large dose exposure.
In children <15 years old, males are at higher risk. For adults, females
are at higher risk.
Adults are at higher risk for anaphylaxis due to penicillin and
Hymenoptera, whereas children are at higher risk for food-induced
anaphylaxis.
Atopy does not appear to increase the risk of anaphylaxis, but it may
place an individual at risk for more severe expressions of anaphylaxis,
including death.
β-blocker therapy places an individual at risk for a more severe
anaphylaxis reaction and may make resuscitation more difficult.

DIAGNOSIS
146

Clinical Presentation
The clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis are highly variable. Signs and
symptoms include any combination of the following (listed in order of
frequency) ranging from a mild to life-threatening severe reaction5:
Dermatologic (80–90%): Flushing, urticaria, angioedema, and
pruritus.
Respiratory (up to 70%): Rhinorrhea/sneezing, cough, choking,
stridor, wheeze, bronchospasm, and laryngeal edema.
Cardiovascular (up to 45%): Hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmia,
myocardial infarction, and syncope.
Gastrointestinal/genitourinary (up to 45%): Abdominal or uterine
cramping, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Although cutaneous symptoms are common in anaphylaxis, they are not
necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Similarly hypotension may not be
present (Table 13-1).1
Onset of symptoms is typically within minutes of exposure to antigen,
although in rare circumstances it can be delayed for hours.
Median time to symptoms/cardiovascular collapse is 30 minutes
for food exposure and 5 minutes for parenterally administered
agents.6
A diagnosis of anaphylaxis should be considered when there is an acute
onset of symptoms in two organ systems, especially in the setting of an
exposure to a possible provoking antigen.
If the patient has a known allergy to a particular allergen, hypotension
after exposure to that antigen is enough to make the diagnosis of
anaphylaxis.
A delayed reaction can occur in some individuals (biphasic
reaction), leading to recurrence of symptoms 4–8 hours after the initial
event.
TABLE 13.1 CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF ANAPHYLAXIS

147

Protracted anaphylaxis requiring many hours of active resuscitation
occurs in as many as 28% of patients.7
Risk factors for prolonged anaphylaxis are oral ingestion of the allergen,
onset of symptoms more than 30 minutes after exposure to the
stimulus, and lack of epinephrine administration.
Recurrent episodes of anaphylaxis without a known cause warrant
consideration of other diagnoses. Systemic mastocytosis (Chapter 19)
can present with recurrent anaphylaxis. Total tryptase will be elevated
persistently even when patient is asymptomatic.
If all other diagnoses are excluded, idiopathic anaphylaxis should be
considered.
Idiopathic anaphylaxis is a diagnosis of exclusion with no causative
factor identified and thought to be the result of nonimmunologic
mast cell activation.
Clinical presentation and treatment are the same as for anaphylaxis
due to known allergens.
Patients who have more than six episodes per year may be considered
for placement on maintenance prednisone therapy.

Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of anaphylaxis is presented in Table 13-2.
148

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
If the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is in question, it is possible to measure a
serum β-tryptase level after patient stabilization. Studies have shown
that increased levels of β-tryptase correspond to acute mediator release.
TABLE 13.2 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ANAPHYLAXIS

In the case of an insect sting anaphylaxis, β-tryptase blood levels are
maximal 15–120 minutes after anaphylaxis and decline with a half-life of
1.5–2.5 hours.8
β-tryptase levels are measurable for up to 8 hours after a putative
anaphylactic ​reaction.
Levels may not be elevated in food-mediated anaphylaxis.

Diagnostic Procedures
Skin Testing
Patients are often referred to an allergist after an episode of presumed
anaphylaxis. If a careful history unveils the causative agent,
confirmation can be performed with skin testing, in vitro, or challenge
testing (Chap. 8).
However, skin tests are not reliable for up to 4–6 weeks after an
episode of anaphylaxis due to expended mast cell
degranulation.
A single episode of anaphylaxis with no obvious causative antigen by
history does not warrant random skin testing or in vitro testing.
In vitro antigen-specific IgE can be tested immediately after an episode
of anaphylaxis but is less sensitive than skin testing.

149

TREATMENT
Regardless of severity, all anaphylactic episodes deserve treatment and
observation, as any mild reaction can rapidly degrade into a more
serious reaction.
For acute treatment, the initial assessment is paramount for prompt
recognition of symptoms and immediate institution of treatment (see
Fig. 13-1).
The first line of therapy is epinephrine, and it should be
administered immediately (Fig. 13-1).9
The patient may require cardiopulmonary resuscitation to support the
airway, maintain adequate oxygenation and circulation.
Treatment also includes long-term risk management.
Prepare for emergencies with an anaphylaxis emergency action
plan
(see www.aaaai.org) , autoinjector, and
medical
identification.
Take steps to reduce long-term risk: Assess and treat comorbidities
(asthma, cardiovascular disease, mastocytosis, and others); assess
for comedications such as nonselective β-blockers; and avoid known
allergens
(for
more
information,
see www.foodallergy.org,
www.latexallergyresources.org, and www.aaai.org).
FIGURE 13.1 Management of anaphylaxis.

Consider
allergen-specific
and
allergen
non-specific
immunomodulation. Allergen-specific includes immunotherapy with
insect venom and desensitization to β-lactam antibiotics, NSAIDs, and
150

others. For idiopathic anaphylaxis consider glucocorticoid treatment.

Medications
Epinephrine
Epinephrine is the only known medication that can prevent or
reverse obstruction to airflow in upper and lower airways and
prevent or reverse cardiovascular collapse.
Failure to inject epinephrine in a timely manner is reported to contribute
to fatality.6
There are no absolute contraindications to its use.
It should be administered immediately using a dose of 0.3–0.5
mg IM (0.3–0.5 mL of a 1:1,000 solution) in the anterolateral thigh
preferentially or upper extremity (deltoid).
Epinephrine dose may be repeated at 5-minute intervals as needed.
Smaller doses may be needed in the elderly (0.2 mg).
In children, the dose is 0.01 mg/kg (1:1,000) IM to a maximum of 0.5
mg with repeated doses every 5 minutes as needed.
Larger doses may be needed in patients receiving β-blockers. Glucagon
(1–2 mg IV push) may be needed in these patients.
Administration via central line (3–5 mL of 1:10,000 solution) or
through endotracheal tube (3–5 mL of a 1:10,000 solution diluted in
10 mL normal saline) may be necessary in cases of severe
hypotension or respiratory failure.
A continuous infusion of 1:10,000 epinephrine may be necessary in
patients with protracted symptoms.
Potential risks of IV epinephrine include myocardial ischemia
and infarction, arrhythmias, and hypertensive crisis.
A bolus of 100 μg/70 kg over a period of 5–10 minutes may be given
(1:10,000 concentration). A continuous infusion of 1–5 μg/min/70 kg
is usually sufficient to maintain systemic perfusion.
Glucocorticosteroids
Glucocorticosteroids do not have an immediate effect, and their
use is currently considered ancillary.
Glucocorticosteroids have the theoretical ability to prevent a relapse of
symptoms based on management of acute asthma and the abrogation
of the late-phase response. However, the ability to prevent an
anaphylactic biphasic reaction has not been proven in a controlled study.
151

Antihistamines
Antihistamines will also not have an immediate effect but may
shorten the duration of symptoms.
Diphenhydramine can be administered IV (25–100 mg over 5–10
minutes), IM, or PO. It can be given every 6 hours for 24–48 hours after
the reaction.
H2 antagonists (i.e., ranitidine, cimetidine) may also be added.10
Bronchodilators
In patients with asthma who are undergoing anaphylaxisassociated wheezing, epinephrine remains the first line of
therapy.
However, if wheezing persists, bronchodilators such as albuterol
(nebulized every 20 minutes or continuously) or theophylline may be
considered.

Nonpharmacologic Therapies
Airway Management
Airway management may require endotracheal intubation if marked
stridor or respiratory failure occurs.
Racemic epinephrine may be useful in treating laryngeal edema.
If laryngeal edema is severe and not immediately responsive to
epinephrine, consider cricothyroidotomy or tracheotomy.
Volume Expansion
Significant third spacing of fluid may occur in anaphylaxis and the
intravascular volume may decrease by up to 50%.
Volume expansion with IV fluids, beginning with a 500–1,000 mL bolus,
should be titrated to blood pressure and urine output.
Colloid solutions, such as albumin, may be beneficial in cases of
refractory hypotension or shock. The risk–benefit profile of each solution
should be carefully weighed, as albumin may precipitate pulmonary
edema and is rather costly.
Observation
Patients with mild reactions limited to flushing, urticaria, angioedema,
cramping, or mild bronchospasm should be monitored in the emergency
department for a minimum of 6–8 hours for possible biphasic reaction.
All other reactions warrant admission to the hospital for 24-hour
152

observation.
Prevention
Secondary prevention is predicated on identification and avoidance
of the inciting agent.
Accidental ingestion of allergic foods in the form of condiments and
prepared foods is a well-known hazard, particularly for food-allergic
children (Chap. 16).
If a known trigger is identified, a comprehensive avoidance
strategy and action plan should be provided to the patient.
Medical identification (i.e., bracelet) may help healthcare professionals
recognize a patient with a known history of anaphylaxis promptly.
Patients with a history of anaphylaxis due to food or
Hymenoptera sting should carry self-administered epinephrine.
Desensitization in the case of certain drugs or immunotherapy in the
case of venom (highly efficacious 95–98%) should be considered if
future exposure to putative agent is unavoidable.

14 Drug Allergy and Desensitization
Jennifer M. Welch
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
A drug allergy or hypersensitivity is a type of adverse drug reaction
(ADR).
An ADR is an undesired or unintended response that occurs when a drug
is given for the appropriate purpose.
Hypersensitivity should be used to describe objectively reproducible
symptoms or signs initiated by exposure to a defined stimulus
at a dose tolerated by normal persons.1
Allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction initiated by specific
immunologic mechanisms.1 This can refer to immunoglobulin E (IgE)or T-cell–mediated reactions.

Classification
ADRs can be divided into two groups: Predictable adverse reactions and
unpredictable adverse reactions.
Predictable adverse reactions are the most common and are
often dose-dependent and related to the pharmacokinetics of
the drug. Examples are over dosage, known side effects (e.g., nausea
with codeine), indirect effects (e.g., Clostridium difficile infection
resulting from clindamycin administration for a skin infection), and drug–
drug interactions.
Unpredictable adverse reactions are usually dose-independent
and unrelated to the drug’s pharmacokinetics.
Immune-mediated adverse reactions can be from various mechanisms.
They usually occur upon re-exposure to the offending drug.
Pseudoallergic reactions, formerly called anaphylactoid reactions, are
caused by IgE-independent degranulation of mast cells.

Epidemiology
155

A meta-analysis from studies conducted in the United States from 1966
to 1996 showed 15.1% of hospitalized patients experienced an ADR with
an incidence of 3.1–6.2% of hospital admissions due to ADRs.2
Overall mortality incidence from ADRs ranged from 0.14 to 0.32%.3
Allergic drug reactions account for 6–10% of all observed ADRs. The risk
for an allergic reaction is about 1–3% for most drugs. It is estimated
that about 5% of adults may be allergic to one or more drugs.4

Pathophysiology
High molecular weight (HMW) drugs, usually >4,000 Da, are large
enough to elicit an immune response without interacting with other
molecules.
Low molecular weight (LMW) drugs, usually <1,000 Da, can form
covalent bonds with a carrier protein, which can then elicit an immune
response. This drug–protein formation is also known as the hapten–
carrier complex.
In some cases, the metabolite of a parent drug creates the immune
response as it binds to another protein. The parent drug is referred to as
a prohapten.
A newer concept called p-i (pharmacologic interactions of drugs with
immune receptors) concept states that a drug which cannot covalently
bind to another protein can still elicit an immune response. This is
achieved by activating T cells through van der Waals interactions with Tcell receptors or major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs).5
Immune-mediated drug reactions occur because an immune
response is mounted against either drug or hapten–carrier.
The different immunologic mechanisms for a drug allergy are shown in
the Gell and Coombs classification of hypersensitivity as explained in
Chapter 2.
Type I reaction: IgE-mediated and immediate onset. Presents as
anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, asthma, and rhinitis.
Type II reaction: IgG antibody-mediated resulting in cytotoxic
destruction of cells; delayed onset. Includes immune cytopenias.
Type III reaction: IgG:antigen complexes with complement
activation. Onset delayed >1 week after drug exposure. Presents as
serum sickness, vasculitis, or drug fever.
Type IV reaction: T-cell–mediated and delayed onset. Divided into
156

four subtypes. Presents as contact dermatitis and various exanthems.
Anaphylactoid or “pseudoallergic” reaction is not IgE mediated but
results in the activation of macrophages and basophils. It is clinically
indistinguishable from anaphylactic reactions.

Risk Factors
Drug Factors
Size and structure: HMW drugs and the ability of a drug or its metabolite
to bind to carrier proteins make it more immunogenic.
Route of exposure: Cutaneous administration is the most immunogenic.6
Penicillin (PCN) is no longer available topically due to this reason. Once
sensitized, parental administration is associated more with anaphylaxis
than oral administration.
Dose, duration, and frequency: Increases in these three factors are more
likely to elicit an immune response than in a smaller dose, for a short
duration, and longer interval between therapy.
Patient-related Factors
Age and gender: Women are affected more frequently than men.
Genetic factors:
Atopy: Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic
dermatitis are not at increased risk for developing a drug reaction as
compared to the general public. However, they may be at an
increased risk to develop pseudoallergic reactions, in particular with
radiocontrast media (RCM).7
Acetylators: A person who is a slow acetylator is at increased risk for
ADR, such as developing drug-induced lupus (DIL) with hydralazine or
procainamide.
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type: There have been numerous
studies demonstrating certain HLA genes associated with increased
risk of drug allergy. For example, HLA-B*5701 is associated with a
hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. 8 Patients are now screened for
this gene before initiating abacavir for treatment of HIV.
Family history of multiple drug allergies.
Prior drug reactions.
Coexisting medical illness: Some medical conditions, especially
infections, predispose to an increased risk for ADRs.
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) hypersensitivity occurs
157

in 5% of HIV-negative patients and in 60% of patients with HIV.9
In the setting of Epstein–Barr viral infection, administration of
ampicillin produces a nearly universal maculopapular rash.10
Concurrent medial therapy: Patients treated with β-blocking agents
may be diagnosed with an allergic reaction later into the reaction. βblockade can impede treatment.

Prevention
Prevention is vital to reduce the incidence of allergic drug reactions.
It is important to only prescribe medications that are clinically essential.
Minimizing polypharmacy also decreases the incidence of allergic drug
reactions.
If an allergy to a drug is in question, use skin testing where possible to
further evaluate.
A graded challenge will help to further delineate if the drug can be safely
used at a therapeutic dose.
Patients who have had an allergic drug reaction should be informed of
the reaction and how to avoid further exposure, including the drug and
any agents that may cross-react. The patient may carry a card or
medical alert bracelet.
Patients that require retreatment with the same drug or class of drugs
have the following options:
Administer an alternative: This requires understanding the
structure of the offending agent and the alternative drug.
Administer a potentially cross-reactive drug under close
medical supervision. Skin testing may be performed, if available
and reliable, before the drug is given. If positive, then drug
desensitization may be indicated.
Graded dose challenge: This is performed by an allergy specialist in
the presence of resuscitative equipment to minimize risk.
Pretreatment protocols: Medications causing anaphylactoid
reactions may undergo premedication to reduce the incidence and
severity of a reaction when the drug is administered.
Perform desensitization: Used when a type I hypersensitivity
reaction is known, or when suspected, but no testing is available to
evaluate. The procedure is performed by a trained allergist in an area
with resuscitation equipment needed for anaphylaxis.
158

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
A thorough history is essential for making the diagnosis of an allergic
drug reaction.
Questions should be directed at establishing the following information:
Sign and symptoms: Where and what order did the symptoms begin,
progress, and resolve?
Timing of the reaction: From the first dose of suspected drug, to the
peak of the reaction, and resolution after discontinuing therapy.
Purpose of drug: Was it prescribed for the appropriate treatment and
can the signs and symptoms be explained by a concurrent illness?
Other medications the patient is receiving: This includes all over-thecounter drugs and dietary supplements.
Prior exposure to the drug or another drug in the same or related
class: If so, when was it given and what was the outcome?
History of other allergic drug reactions: Did the patient ever see an
allergist and receive skin testing? What was the reaction and how
long ago was the reaction?
Anaphylaxis is discussed in detail in Chapter 13. It is important to
remember that anaphylactoid reactions are indistinguishable from
anaphylaxis, but it is not an IgE-mediated reaction.
Urticaria and angioedema are discussed in detail in Chapter 9. An
example of a type I hypersensitivity and the second most frequent druginduced skin eruption.
Fixed drug reaction: Skin lesions that recur in the same area on
reexposure to a drug.
Typically the lesion is round and well delineated. Starts as an area of
edema, then becomes erythematous and darkens to a violaceous
colored area. The lesion is raised and non-pruritic.
Begins 30 minutes to 8 hours after re-exposure to the drug.
After withdrawal of the drug, the lesion will resolve in 2–3 weeks
leaving an area of desquamation and then hyperpigmentation.
Drugs commonly implicated in fixed drug reactions include
phenolphthalein, barbiturates, sulfonamides, tetracycline, and
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Serum sickness: A type III hypersensitivity reaction with soluble
159

immune complexes that activate the complement system.
Symptoms begin 6–21 days after administration of the drug and
include fever, malaise, skin eruptions (palpable purpura or urticaria),
arthralgias/myalgias, arthritis, lymphadenopathy, and leukopenia.
Once the offending drug is discontinued, symptoms resolve completely
in a few days to weeks depending on the severity.
β-lactams are the most commonly associated nonserum drug to cause
serum sickness.
Drug fever: May be the only manifestation of a drug allergy. Fever may
reach high temperatures.
Associated findings are leukocytosis, mild eosinophilia, elevated
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), transaminitis, and rash.
After withdrawal of drug, defervescence occurs with 48–72 hours. If
the drug is re-administered, fever recurs within hours. Diagnosis is
one of exclusion.
Maculopapular or morbilliform skin eruptions: The most common
drug-induced skin eruption.
Rash typically is symmetric beginning in areas of pressure and spares
the palms and soles.
It is confluent with erythematous macules and papules. Begins 4–7
days after initiating a drug.
Contact dermatitis: Discussed in further detail in Chapter 11, is a type
IV hypersensitivity reaction from exposure of a topically applied drug.
Erythema multiforme: A skin eruption that is generally self-limited.
Presents with a combination of macules, papules, vesicles, bullae, and
targetoid lesions.
Lesions are predominately on the extremities and involve the
palms and soles, but rarely the scalp or face.
Mucosal involvement is usually limited to the oral cavity. Rash
resolves in 2–4 weeks and may have residual hyperpigmentation.
Erythema multiforme major (Stevens–Johnson syndrome, SJS): A
more severe manifestation, characterized by fever, mucosal
involvement, and sloughing of <10% of the epidermis. Ocular
involvement is common.
Symptoms begin 1–3 weeks after starting the drug. Recovery can last
6 weeks. Mortality around 10% in severe cases.
Discontinuing the offending drug and starting high dose corticosteroids
160

reduce morbidity and mortality.11
If the putative drug is re-administered, symptoms will recur
and thus any drug challenge (including graded challenge) is
contraindicated.
Drugs that commonly cause SJS include sulfonamides, anticonvulsants,
barbiturates,
phenylbutazone,
piroxicam,
allopurinol,
and
aminopenicillins.
Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN): TEN is life-threatening and
characterized by fever, diffuse necrosis, and sloughing of >30%
of epithelial surface.
TEN has a mortality rate of up to 40%.12 There may be a benefit to
treat TEN with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).13
As with SJS, any drug challenge (including graded challenge)
with the offending agent is contraindicated.
Drugs associated with TEN include sulfonamides, allopurinol,
barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and NSAIDs.
DIL: Symptoms may not appear for months after initiating a drug.
Patient may experience fever, malaise, arthralgias, and pleurisy.
Unlike idiopathic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), it is rare to
have a butterfly malar rash, discoid lesions, oral ulcers, Raynaud
phenomenon, alopecia, and renal or neurologic involvement.
DIL is seen in older individuals with males and females equally
affected. It is a milder disease than SLE.
Patients have a positive ANA or antihistone antibody.
Symptoms resolve days to weeks after the drug is removed. Although,
symptoms may persist for months before disappearing.
Drugs with the highest risk of DIL are hydralazine, procainamide, and
quinidine.
Drug-induced hepatitis: Begins 1–5 weeks after initiating drug. Liver
damage may result from cholestasis, hepatocellular injury, or a mixture
of both.
Patient may develop icterus, fever, rash, and eosinophilia in addition
to abnormalities in the liver function tests.
Recovery can be expected after removal of the offending drug, if
irreversible cell damage has not occurred.
Commonly offending agents include halothane, phenytoin,
nitrofurantoin, allopurinol, phenothiazines, and sulfonamides.
161

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN): Symptoms start days to weeks after
initiating the drug. Associated with fever, rash, and eosinophilia.
Renal involvement includes mild proteinuria, microhematuria, and
eosinophiluria.
Renal insufficiency resolves once offending drug is removed.
Drugs seen in AIN are β-lactams (especially methicillin), rifampin,
NSAIDs,
sulfonamides,
captopril,
allopurinol,
methyldopa,
anticonvulsants, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, and proton pump inhibitors.
Hematologic manifestations: Usually appear without any other
symptoms, onset is quick, and resolve in 1–2 weeks after discontinuing
the drug. Drug-induced cytopenias are often due to type II
hypersensitivity. Commonly implicated drugs for the following cytopenias
are listed:
Eosinophilia can be caused by: gold salts, allopurinol, aminosalicylic
acid, ampicillin, tricyclic antidepressants, capreomycin sulfate,
carbamazepine, digitalis, phenytoin, sulfonamides, vancomycin, and
streptomycin.
Thrombocytopenia: gold salts, quinidine, sulfonamides, and
heparin.
Hemolytic anemia: PCN, cisplatin, tetracycline, methyldopa,
levodopa, mefenamic acid, procainamide, tolmetin, quinidine,
chlorpropamide, nitrofurantoin, probenecid, rifampin, streptomycin,
isoniazid, erythromycin, ibuprofen, triamterene, and phenacetin.
Neutropenia: sulfonamides, sulfasalazine, propylthiouracil,
semisynthetic
PCNs,
quinidine,
procainamide,
phenytoin,
phenothiazines, cephalosporins, and gold.

Diagnostic Criteria
Table 14-1 presents the clinical criteria for an allergic drug reaction.4
TABLE 14.1 CLINICAL CRITERIA OF ALLERGIC DRUG REACTIONS

162

Diagnostic Testing
Diagnostic tests for allergy are discussed in further detail in Chapter 8.
In vivo testing involves skin testing and test dosing the patient with the
suspected drug.
Prick and intradermal cutaneous tests help to measure an IgE
response. A patient with a positive wheal-and-flare response
identifies a drug that can cause anaphylaxis.
HMW drugs such as antisera, egg-containing vaccines, monoclonal
antibodies, latex, and toxoids can be used directly as skin testing
reagents.
It is important for patients to abstain from using antihistamines and
tricyclic antidepressants, which can interfere with the wheal-andflare response.
There is a refractory period of 2–4 weeks after an episode of acute
anaphylaxis where skin tests are invalid.
163

A negative wheal-and-flare test does not rule out a drug
allergy.
Patch testing can be used to asses for a type IV contact
hypersensitivity to topical agents.
A series of antigens are placed on the skin under occlusive dressing
and results read 48–72 hours later.
Graded dose challenge (or provocative test dosing) provides a
direct challenge to the patient to determine whether a suspected
drug caused the clinical manifestations.
Graded challenges are generally performed when there is low
probability of a true drug allergy.
However, this approach has the risk of a potentially serious adverse
reaction and must be performed by a person with experience in
managing hypersensitivity reactions.
In graded challenges, the dose of medication is incrementally raised
until therapeutic dose is achieved.
This approach minimizes the risk of an adverse reaction by exposing
the patient to progressively larger doses of the medication.
If a patient tolerates a graded challenge without any
adverse reaction, the patient does not have an allergy to
the medication. Future doses of the same medication can be
administered without further testing.
Oral administration of provocative test dosing has a lower risk of
serious adverse reaction than parenteral routes. When possible,
oral dose challenges are preferred over parenteral dose
challenges.
If the risk of an adverse reaction is felt to be too high to risk a
graded challenge, a drug desensitization can be performed.
Graded dose challenges are faster than desensitizations but carry a
higher risk of adverse reaction.
In vitro testing uses various laboratory tests to aid in the assessment of
drug allergy.
β-tryptase levels are elevated up to 8 hours after an anaphylactic
event. It is more sensitive than serum or urine histamine levels.
Decreases in total hemolytic complement (CH50) or C3 and C4 levels
can be seen in drug reactions involving complement activation.
Total IgE levels are not useful for drug allergy.
164

In vitro measurement of antigen-specific IgE can be helpful in
diagnosing drug allergy.
In general, measuring in vitro antigen-specific IgE is less sensitive
than skin testing.
It requires the knowledge of which drug metabolite is immunogenic
which is not known for many drugs.
In vitro antigen-specific IgE has been validated for the major
(penicilloyl) determinant of PCN, but not for the minor determinant.
The lack of an in vitro antigen-specific IgE to a drug does
not rule out drug allergy.

TREATMENT
Withdrawing the suspected culprit drug is the most important
step in managing an ADR.
For the drugs that are essential, switching to another non–cross-reacting
alternative agent is indicated.
Most ADRs due to allergy will resolve with discontinuation of the
offending agent.
Follow practice guidelines for treatment of anaphylaxis (Chap. 13),
urticaria, angioedema (Chap. 9), bronchospasm, and contact dermatitis
(Chap. 11).
Serum sickness reactions can be treated with antihistamines and
NSAIDs. Prednisone taper can be given for severe reactions.
SJS, drug fever, and DIL can be treated with corticosteroids.
In TEN, corticosteroids are not effective but IVIG may play a role.
Table 14-2 shows a commonly used premedication protocol for RCM.
Desensitization can help prevent reactions. This procedure is
performed only by a trained allergist in an area with resuscitation
equipment needed for anaphylaxis.
The drug is given in 15–10 minute intervals in half-log10 increments
until therapeutic dose is achieved.
Table 14-3 provides a sample desensitization protocol.14
The mechanisms underlying desensitization are not fully understood
b u t a successful desensitization will result in temporary
tolerance to the medication.
Patients will be tolerant to the medication only as long as the drug
continues to be given. In general, if the patient goes longer than
165

24 hours without a dose, then desensitization will need to be
performed again.
β-blockers should be withheld or tapered before procedure. Mild
skin reactions such as urticaria or pruritus may occur and can be
treated without discontinuing the procedure.
The choice to perform a graded dose challenge or desensitization
should be based on the assessment of an experienced clinician.

MEDIA

TABLE 14.3 PROTOCOL FOR ORAL PENICILLIN DESENSITIZATION

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Penicillin Allergy
PCN allergy is the most common cause of drug-induced
anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis has been reported to occur in 1:100,000 with serious allergic
reactions in 4.6 per 10,000 administrations.15
As many as 10% of hospitalized patients report a history of allergy to
PCN with many reporting a rash as the allergic reaction.
PCN reactions can be stratified by time course (Table 14-4 ). Immediate
(<1 hour) and accelerated reactions (1–72 hours) are IgE mediated.
The most frequently reported PCN allergy is a maculopapular rash, which
occurs in 2–3% of a treatment course. The next most common reactions
include urticaria, fever, and bronchospasm.
PCN requires conjugation with proteins to elicit an immune response
given its LMW.
167

The major antigenic determinant is a penicilloyl moiety formed by
PCN covalently binding to lysine residues in serum or cell surface
proteins. This occurs in approximately 93% of PCN molecules.
TABLE 14.4 PENICILLIN REACTIONS BY TIME COURSE

The minor antigenic determinants are all remaining PCN conjugates
(7%), which include penicillin, penicilloate, and penilloate.
Skin testing:
The major antigenic determinant can be tested with Pre-Pen. It was
withdrawn from the market in 2004 due to lack of a manufacturer, but
has been FDA approved again in 2009. Pre-Pen is the only FDAapproved skin test for drug allergy.
A standardized test for minor antigenic determinants is not
commercially available. A fresh solution of benzylpenicillin can be
used for skin testing.
Skin testing will not help to predict the occurrence of a non–IgEmediated ​reaction.
The predictive value of a history of PCN allergy and combination of
skin testing in determining PCN hypersensitivity shows that 19% of
patients with a positive history will have a positive skin test. In
patients with a negative history of PCN allergy, 4–7% had a positive
skin test. The incidence of reaction among skin test-negative subjects
is <1% when evaluating for minor antigenic determinants.16,17
Cross-reactivity:
The cross-reactivity between β-lactam antibiotics is variable and
largely determined by their side-chain structure attached to the βlactam nucleus.
Cephalosporins had higher cross-reactivity to PCN before 1980 as
cephalosporins were contaminated with small amounts of PCN.18 Risk
of a cross-reaction with a first-generation cephalosporin is 5–16.5%,
168

second generation is 4% and third or fourth generation 1–3%.19
Patients with amoxicillin allergy should avoid cefadroxil, cefprozil,
and cefatrizine as all these drugs share same R-group side chain.
Carbapenems have been known to have increased cross-reactivity
with PCN. Recent studies have shown that patients with a positive
PCN skin test and negative carbapenem skin test underwent a graded
carbapenem challenge, which did not result in any hypersensitivity
reactions.18
The monobactam aztreonam rarely cross-reacts with PCN.
Aztreonam does share an identical side chain as ceftazidime and are
highly cross-reactive.20
Desensitization: If there is no suitable alternative drug available and
the patient has a positive skin test, then desensitization has to be
performed. Table 14-3 shows a sample PCN protocol.

Sulfonamide Allergy
Allergies to sulfonamides are increased in patients with HIV compared to
the general population. TMP-SMX hypersensitivity occurs in 5% of HIVnegative patients and in 60% of patients with HIV.9
The most common reaction is a maculopapular rash that develops 7–
12 days after initiating the drug. This may be associated with a fever.
Urticaria can be seen, but anaphylaxis is rare. SJS and TEN are known to
be caused by sulfonamides.
Sulfonamide antibiotics have a p-aminobenzoic acid ring that is similar to
thiazides, furosemide, and sulfonylureas. Sulfonamides are metabolized
primarily by N-acetylation and secondarily by cytochrome P450 Noxidation.
Slow acetylators are at increased risk of drug reaction as they
preferentially metabolize sulfonamide antibiotics by N-oxidation
resulting in reactive nitroso metabolites which cause cellular damage
and react with protein to become immunogenic. This switch in
metabolism is due to decreased glutathione reductase, which is also
known to be diminished in HIV patients.21
There are no standardized skin tests to evaluate sulfonamide drug
allergy.
Slow and rapid desensitization protocols have been established for
sulfonamide allergy. A rapid protocol sample is listed in Table 14-5.22
169

Local Anesthetics
Patients often report ADRs to local anesthetics (LAs), but these rarely
represent a true allergy. The patient may have experienced a side
effect of the epinephrine given with the LA or a vasovagal reaction.
TABLE 14.5 ORAL SULFONAMIDE DESENSITIZATION PROTOCOL
(RAPID)

TABLE 14.6 CLASSES OF LOCAL ANESTHETICS

170

LAs are divided into two classes based on the structure. Table 14-6 lists
LAs.
p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing LAs (esters) cross-react with
one another.
Non–PABA-containing LAs (amides) do not cross-react with one
another or with PABA-containing LAs.
The reliability of skin test for LAs has not been defined.
If the LA causing the previous reaction is known, then choose another LA
that does not cross-react.
If the LA is unknown and the patient is to undergo a procedure, then
contact the practitioner to test the LA of choice. Multiple LAs can be
tested at once, such as one PABA-containing LA and two non–PABAcontaining LA.
Testing consists of epicutaneous skin testing using full-strength drug
with positive and negative controls then followed by intradermal testing
with 0.02 mL of drug diluted 1:100. If the skin testing is negative, then
testing proceeds with subcutaneous incremental challenge using 0.1 mL
of full-strength drug and graduating to 1 mL.23
It is important not to use a preparation containing epinephrine
or preservatives for skin testing. Epinephrine may cause falsenegative skin test and parabens may cause false-positive skin test.
Patients with a previous reaction should use preservative-free
preparations in the future.
If the reported allergic reaction was delayed in onset, then wait 24–48
hours to confirm a negative skin test before proceeding to challenge.
Then wait another 24–48 hours after incremental challenge before using
LA clinically.

15 Insect Allergy
K. Lindsey B. McMullan
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Insects cause several types of reactions in individuals in the United
States. Most stings produce a transient local reaction. A smaller subset
can develop serious or life-threatening reactions.1
The majority of stings that are caused by insects in the Order
Hymenoptera, which includes bees, yellow jackets (YJs), wasps,
hornets, and ants.
Evaluation of sting reactions must include type of insect, type of
reaction, necessity for auto-injectable epinephrine prescription, and
necessity for referral to an allergy and immunology specialist.

Definition
Hymenoptera (Latin for membranous wings) are insects with two pairs of
wings, antennae, and an ovipositor that is used to deliver the venom.
Families of interest include Apidae, Vespidae, and Formicidae.
Apidae include honeybees (HBs) and bumblebees.
Domestic HBs are usually found in commercial hives.
Wild HBs build their nests in buildings, tree hollows, or old logs. They
are typically not aggressive if not around their nests.
Usually stings are occupational. When they sting, a barbed stinger
with venom sac is usually left behind. Most other insects do not leave
a stinger, however, it is possible, so a stinger is not pathognomonic of
the HB.
Africanized HBs can be found in the Southwestern states including
California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Nevada. They attack in
swarms and are much more aggressive than the domestic HB.
Secondary to their swarming nature, many stings may occur causing a
toxic reaction.1
Vespidae includes YJs, wasps, and hornets.
YJs live in the ground, wall tunnels, logs, or crevices. They are
aggressive and responsible for most reported reactions. They
174

do not require much provocation for stinging, particularly around food.
Hornets have large paper-mâché nests that are often found in shrubs
or trees. They are aggressive and may chase once provoked.
Wasps have smaller hives in a honeycomb shape. These can be found
under eaves, patio furniture, and also in shrubs.
All three of these insects are attracted to human foods and can be
found at outdoor events or around garbage.1
Formicidae include fire ants and harvester ants.
Fire ants, particularly those in the genus Solenopsis, are most
commonly found in the Southeastern and south central states.
They are native to South America.
Solenopsis invicta venom causes a sterile pustule which is
pathognomonic for a fire ant bite.2
Formicidae differ from other Hymenoptera in that they do not have
wings and sting in a circular pattern that causes the pustule.

Classification
Local reactions are either small or large and immediate or delayed.
Typically the area is swollen, red, and painful.
By definition, a local reaction must be contiguous with the site of the
sting.
Immediate reactions occur within <4 hours.
Large local reactions are defined by a diameter >10 cm with
symptoms peaking in 24–48 hours.3
These reactions can last for 5–10 days and can be so large as to
include an entire extremity.
Cutaneous symptoms must be contiguous.
These reactions may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, and malaise.
Cutaneous systemic reactions are similar to large local reactions
except they are noncontiguous (e.g., a sting to the foot with a separate
reaction appearing on the hand in a noncontiguous fashion). Signs are
confined to the dermis and may include urticaria and angioedema.
Systemic reactions include both cutaneous systemic reactions and
anaphylaxis.
Multiple systems may be included: Cardiovascular (hypotension and
tachycardia), respiratory (bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, tongue
swelling, or throat swelling), neurologic (seizures), gastrointestinal
175

(GI) (nausea, emesis, diarrhea, abdominal pain).
Anaphylaxis generally requires two or more body systems to be
involved (see Chapter 13).
If bradycardia is present, a vasovagal reaction should be considered,
though anaphylaxis can occasionally present with bradycardia.4

Epidemiology
Systemic reactions in US adults have a prevalence of approximately 3%.
About 40 deaths occur in the United States each year secondary to
insect stings.1
Large local reactions occur more frequently and worldwide have a
prevalence of 2.4–10%.
Beekeepers have a higher prevalence, up to 38%.
Those who sustain a large local reaction have a 5–15% chance of a
systemic reaction if stung by the same type of insect again.3
Children ≤16 years old that have a cutaneous systemic reaction have
about a 10% chance of developing a systemic reaction if re-stung. The
following reaction is most likely to be cutaneous.1
Of those stung, about 30% will later be positive to venom-specific skin
testing or venom-specific serum IgE (sIgE) testing.5
YJ or HB will be positive on either skin testing or sIgE in 10–20% of all
adults.5 Of those evaluated for YJ or HB reaction, 30–50% will have a
positive skin test to both.6
Fire ants sting up to half of those they come in contact with each year.7

Pathophysiology
Reactions to insect bites are caused by different mechanisms.
Most immune-mediated reactions are IgE-mediated.
Other immune reactions have also been reported including the
following:
Serum-sickness–like responses.
Neuritis.
Encephalitis.
Glomerulonephritis.
Vasculitis.
When stung by multiple insects simultaneously, the venom may cause
a toxic reaction.
These reactions may appear clinically similar to anaphylaxis
176

and can cause death.
Multiple stings, particularly with Africanized HB or fire ants, can be
incited by disturbing a hive or nest.1
Components of venom which produce a damaging effect, but do not
necessarily induce IgE, include hyaluronidase, melittin, mast cell
degranulating peptide, mastoparan-C, histamine, dopamine,
norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and kinins.3,5
Venom allergens causing IgE reactions consist of proteins.
The major protein in HB is Api-m-1.
The major protein in YJ, Vespula vulgaris, is Ves-v-5.
The fire ant protein Sol-i-3 is similar to Ves-v-5.6
Fire ant venom (solenopsin) strongly inhibits myocardial contractility.
This is thought to be from the alkaloid portion of the venom (95%).
It has been postulated that heart failure after a large number of fire
ant stings could be secondary to this property of solenopsin.
The 5% of the venom that is protein leads to IgE-mediated reactions.7
Reactions to biting insects, such as mosquitoes, deerfly, and Triatoma
(kissing bug and bed bug) typically cause itching and not pain.
Their allergens generally come from salivary proteins and not venoms.
Anaphylaxis has been implicated in the deerfly and Triatoma.
Large local reactions are more typical of a bad reaction to a mosquito.
Vespids have significant cross-reactivity (YJ, hornet, wasp).
Different species in the same genera of ants will cross-react; however,
they do not have much cross-reactivity across genera [e.g., different
species of fire ant (Solenopsis) cross-react with each other but not
with harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex)].
HBs have very limited cross-reactivity with bumblebees.5

Risk Factors
Risk for systemic reaction is based on severity of previous reaction, type
of insect allergy, and time since previous reaction.
The more severe the reactions, the greater the chance a
subsequent reaction will be severe.
For an anaphylactic reaction, if the patient is re-stung in the next 9
years, risk of anaphylactic response is 60%. Without intervention, this
risk decreases to 40% if it has been 10–20 years since the previous
sting.
177

HB allergy confers a greater risk of systemic reaction compared
to other hymenoptera.5
Occupation and hobbies can put you at risk for stings.
Beekeepers have the highest risk.
Gardeners, campers, farmers, and horseback riders also are at
increased risk.
Risk for a sting also increases if you are in an outdoor area where food
is present.
Risk of systemic reaction is increased by the following4:
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
Baseline tryptase levels >5 ng/L.
Male sex.
Elevation of baseline tryptase is independent risk factor for severe
anaphylaxis to sting.8
There is higher risk of future anaphylaxis if a patient had a serum
sickness reaction, toxic reaction, had multiple stings at once, or had a
previous sting within a few weeks.

DIAGNOSIS
History is very important in helping to distinguish the type of insect.
Physical characteristics of the reaction help determine future risk and
what, if any, diagnostic workup needs to be pursued.
Hymenoptera allergy is confirmed through allergen-specific IgE testing.

Clinical Presentation
History
A key element of history is attempting to find out what insect stung the
patient.
Both the nature and location of the activity occurring at the time of
sting are important.
Any characteristics the patient can use to describe the insect are
helpful as well such as size, color, or whether a stinger was left in the
skin.
If the patient is able to actually bring in the insect, then an accurate
diagnosis can be made.
It is also important to note whether or not the patient actually saw an
insect, or if there is an insect bite on examination. This assists in
178

differential diagnosis as 25% of the general population have
sensitization to venom on random testing.5
Other important elements of history include assessment of:
Time from sting to reaction (latency).
Duration of the reaction.
History of previous stings (and by what insects).
A thorough history of the patient’s activities, hobbies, and other medical
problems will help tailor treatment.
Medical comorbidities and current medications can be prognostic. For
example, patients on b-blockers can have protracted anaphylaxis.
Physical Examination
Physical examination should focus on type of reaction (local or systemic)
and then further characterize (large local, cutaneous systemic,
anaphylaxis).
Cardiovascular collapse is responsible for 25% of fatalities. Important
signs include flushing, tachycardia, hypotension, and vascular
collapse/shock.
Respiratory obstruction is responsible for 60% of fatalities. Important
signs include lip, tongue, and/or throat angioedema, wheezing, stridor,
and respiratory distress or failure.
Cutaneous symptoms include pain and pruritus.
Signs include the distribution of swelling, contiguity of swelling,
flushing, urticaria, and whether or not there is angioedema of lip,
throat, or tongue.
Pustules present at the bite area are pathognomonic of fire ants.
Size of the swelling and contiguity are very important in determining
whether the reaction is local, large local, or systemic.
GI symptoms include nausea and abdominal cramping. Signs include
emesis and diarrhea.
Other general signs and symptoms to watch for are dizziness,
fainting, seizures, malaise, fever, fatigue, rashes indicative of vasculitis,
joint pain, renal, mental, or sensory complaints.
Evaluation for signs of secondary infection at bite site(s). Septicemia is
the cause of 2% of deaths.

Diagnostic Criteria
Correct classification leads to appropriate diagnostic workup, treatment,
179

and assessment of prognosis.
Large local reactions are >10 cm with symptoms peaking in 24–48
hours. Swelling and erythema must be contiguous.
Cutaneous systemic reactions have non-contiguous areas of swelling
and erythema.
Systemic anaphylaxis requires signs in two or more systems (e.g.,
swelling with erythema and hypotension).
To make a definitive diagnosis, venom-specific IgE testing by
either skin prick or radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) must be
performed and be positive in light of a convincing history.1

Differential Diagnosis
Other illnesses can be confused with an insect sting, particularly if the
insect was not seen.
Diagnoses to consider include the following:
Local:
Cellulitis
Vasculitis
Boils
Abscess
Systemic:
Vasovagal reaction
Myocardial infarction
Pulmonary embolism
Sepsis
Drug reaction
Food allergy
Other cause of anaphylaxis

Diagnostic Testing
Diagnostic testing focuses primarily on identifying the culprit insect so
that venom immunotherapy (VIT) may be instituted.
If the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is in question, a serum tryptase can be
drawn within 1–4 hours after the event and followed up after the patient
is stabilized.
Testing should be performed to all members of Hymenoptera
unless the patient can absolutely identify fire ant as the
stinging insect. If fire ant is identified, testing with venom to other
180

stinging insects is not indicated.1
Further diagnostic testing to identify type of insect is indicated in
anaphylaxis, systemic cutaneous reaction, and some large local
reactions.
Diagnostic testing typically begins with immediate hypersensitivity
testing with positive and negative controls. It is preferable to wait 3–
6 weeks after having a reaction before skin testing is performed
to prevent false negatives.
Skin prick testing can be performed to a number of insects.
In the United States testable venom proteins include yellow
hornet, white faced hornet, YJ, wasp, and HB.
Epicutaneous testing is followed by intradermal skin testing if the
results are negative.
Testing is considered positive if a response occurs at or before 1.0
μg/mL of venom or 1:500 wt/vol for fire ant extract.
The size of a positive skin test does not necessarily correlate to the
severity of the reaction.
If skin testing is negative and the patient has had a systemic reaction,
repeat skin testing should be performed at a return clinic visit, or in vitro
venom-specific sIgE testing should be performed prior to deciding that
VIT is not necessary.
Venom-specific sIgE testing should be used in lieu of skin testing in
patients with severe skin conditions or who are dermatographic. Skin
testing is preferable if possible as it is more sensitive.

TREATMENT
Medications
Immediate Therapy for a Sting
Local reactions are treated symptomatically.
Pain relief can be obtained with cold compresses and oral analgesics.
Oral antihistamines may help the itching.
Patients with large local reactions can also be treated with oral
antihistamines and analgesics.
In addition, oral steroids (40–60 mg tapered over 0–5 days) can be
prescribed if edema is spreading, limbs are not functioning properly, or
edema involves the lip or face.3,5
181

For anaphylaxis, epinephrine is the treatment of choice.
In a life-threatening situation, there is no contraindication for
epinephrine.1
If anaphylaxis occurs, the patient should be monitored for at least 3–6
hours for a late-phase reaction or protracted anaphylaxis, particularly
if they are taking b-blockers.
Glucagon may be helpful for patients on b-blockers.5
Auto-injectable epinephrine is available by prescription at doses of
0.3 mg administered IM or 0.15 mg administered IM. Individuals
weighing more than 30 kg should receive 0.3 mg dosing.
Individuals who are prescribed auto-injectable epinephrine should be
educated on how to use these devices properly.
Venom Immunotherapy
Table 15-1 summarizes who should receive VIT.
VIT is indicated in patients who have had a systemic reaction,
anaphylaxis, and in some patients who have experienced large
local reactions. Patients must have demonstration of venomspecific IgE either by skin or in vitro testing.
TABLE 15.1 GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR VENOM IMMUNOTHERAPY

VIT is a potentially lifesaving treatment for patients with systemic
reactions to Hymenoptera.
VIT decreases the risk of future systemic reaction to less than 5%.1
VIT is generally recommended for those older than 16 who have
experienced cutaneous systemic reaction.
Exceptions do exist if the parent desires VIT or if the patient is at high
risk for frequent or multiple stings.1
Patients who have large local reactions and work in an occupation or
182

participate in hobbies with high risk of multiple or frequent stings should
be considered for VIT.6
VIT is composed of the venoms (or whole body extract in the case of fire
ant) to which a given patient is allergic.
Components of VIT are determined by antigen-specific IgE testing.
All venoms a patient tests positive to are generally used.
VIT requires a commitment by the patient.
Injections are generally administered once weekly until a few weeks
after the maintenance dose is reached (100 μg venom or 0.5 mL of
1:100 wt/vol fire ant extract) after which dosing is spaced to 4-week
intervals.
It can take up to 28 weeks to reach maintenance assuming there is no
reaction to the treatments.
VIT should be continued for 3–5 years.
The decision of when to discontinue VIT is still being debated and
should be a decision between the patient and the physician based on
numerous factors such as type of insect, future risk of stings, and type
of reaction to insect sting.1,9
Reactions to VIT can be local or systemic.
The majority are local, though 5–15% can have systemic reactions.
Systemic reactions are more likely in those treated with HB and in
patients with underlying mast cell disease.
Pretreatment with oral antihistamines may help to reduce all
reactions.5
Secondary to the risk of severe reactions, VIT should be administered in
a medical office capable of treating anaphylaxis.
If a patient takes a b-blocker and an alternative medication is not an
option, extreme caution should be used when proceeding with VIT due
to the risk of decreased response to therapy for allergic reactions.1

Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Day-to-day preventive measures include the following:
Have a professional exterminate nests in the area.
Watch for new nests.
Avoid bright or floral clothing when outside.
Do not walk bare-foot outside.
If working outside, wear clothing that covers skin including gloves,
183

long pants/sleeves, head covering, socks with shoes.
Exercise caution in high-risk areas such as attics, bushes, or picnics.
Keep insecticides for use if a stinging insect is identified.
Those with a history of systemic reaction or anaphylaxis should:
Wear a medical alert necklace or bracelet.
Carry auto-injectable epinephrine.
It should be reinforced that this medication should be easily
available, and if sting occurs, its use should not be delayed.
Antihistamines are not a suitable substitute for epinephrine.
It is prudent to discuss an emergency plan and remind patients to go to
an emergency facility for monitoring if a sting occurs.
For those who might be candidates for VIT it is important to refer them
to an allergist-immunologist for venom-specific IgE testing.1

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Pregnant patients can still receive VIT if it has already been started prior
to pregnancy.
VIT should not be initiated during pregnancy secondary to risk of
effect of systemic reactions on the fetus.
Dose should be maintained and not escalated in those pregnant
women who are already on VIT.
The patient and physician should weigh the small risk systemic
reaction to VIT against risk of anaphylaxis to insect sting.
Elderly patients are at higher risk for severe anaphylaxis.6
The indications for VIT in children 16 years of age and younger differ
from adults.

REFERRAL
See Table 15-2 for indications for referral.
TABLE 15.2 INDICATIONS FOR REFERRAL TO ALLERGISTIMMUNOLOGIST

184

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Initial monitoring after a systemic reaction should be at least 3–6 hours.
Further care required can then be determined.
Patients with systemic reactions should be referred to an allergist–
immunologist for venom-specific IgE testing.
For those undergoing VIT, they will receive an injection weekly until
maintenance is achieved, and then be able to space out their injections.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The majority of deaths occur within 4 hours of the sting, though 10%
are delayed.
For those who are undergoing a systemic reaction, the greatest factor
determining prognosis will be use of epinephrine.
Prognosis is good for those undergoing VIT. It decreases the risk of a
systemic reaction to less than 5%.
For those who have had a systemic reaction and do not receive VIT, risk
for further systemic reaction can approach 60%.1
The severity of future reactions is predicted by the severity of past
reactions.
5–10% of those with large local reactions will have a systemic reaction
in the future.6

16 Food Allergy and Other Adverse Food
Reactions
Amanda Trott
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Adverse food reaction: Any abnormal reaction due to ingestion of a
food. This includes immunologic (allergy) as well as nonimmunologic
reactions (food intolerances, e.g., lactose intolerance).1
Food allergy (FA): Also referred to as food hypersensitivity, is an
adverse health effect arising from a specific immunologic response that
occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food. This includes both
immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and non–IgE-mediated immunologic
reactivity to specific foods.
IgE-mediated FAs are FAs mediated by IgE. This requires both the
presence of food antigen-specific IgE and the development of specific
signs and symptoms upon exposure to a specific food.
Non–IgE-mediated FAs are conditions that are immunologically
mediated processes with reproducible signs and symptoms on
exposure to a food but without IgE sensitization.

Classification
The various forms of FA are presented in Table 16-1.
Food intolerances are non–immune-mediated adverse reactions to
food. Intolerance may result from metabolic, toxic, pharmacologic, or
other causes.
Food-induced anaphylaxis is an IgE-mediated, rapid-onset, serious
systemic reaction which may result in shock and/or respiratory
compromise.
Gastrointestinal (GI) food allergies:
Immediate GI hypersensitivity: IgE-mediated FA with upper GI
symptoms within minutes (most commonly vomiting) and lower GI
symptoms that are either immediate or delayed up to several hours.
187

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): Localized eosinophilic inflammation
of the esophagus involving both IgE- and non–IgE-mediated
mechanisms. Symptoms include vomiting, reflux, abdominal pain,
dysphagia, and food impaction. Food avoidance frequently results in
resolution.
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: Like EoE, but involving portions of the
GI tract distal to the esophagus.
Dietary protein–induced proctitis/proctocolitis: Presents in
infants who seem healthy but have visible blood in the stool. This
process is generally non–IgE-mediated, and differentiated from other
GI food allergies with similar stool findings by lack of systemic
symptoms. There is no specific testing, so the causal role of food
allergens is inferred from a characteristic history on exposure.
TABLE 16.1 FOOD ALLERGIES

188

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES): Non–
IgE-mediated disorder presenting in infants with very severe vomiting
and diarrhea, most commonly caused by cow’s milk, soy, or grains.
Oral allergy syndrome (OAS): Localized IgE-mediated allergy to
fresh fruits or vegetables, with itching, tingling, and/or swelling of the
lips, tongue, roof of the mouth, and throat. This affects patients with
pollen allergy and is also referred to as pollen-associated FA
syndrome.
Cutaneous reactions to foods:
Acute urticaria: A common manifestation of IgE-mediated FA,
especially in the setting of anaphylaxis, with rapid development of
polymorphic, round, or irregularly shaped pruritic wheals after
ingestion of the problem food.
Angioedema: Typically IgE-mediated when food-induced and usually
in combination with urticaria. This is a nonpitting, nonpruritic, welldefined swelling of the subcutaneous tissues, abdominal organs, or
upper airway. Also a common feature of anaphylaxis.
Atopic dermatitis (AD): Because this disease involves complex
interaction between skin barrier dysfunction and environmental
factors, the role of FA in its pathogenesis remains controversial. In
some sensitized patients, food allergens can aggravate AD.
Acute contact dermatitis: A form of AD caused by cell-mediated
allergic reactions to chemical haptens in foods, resulting in pruritus,
erythema, papules, vesicles, and edema.
Contact urticaria: Can be either immunologic (IgE-mediated) or
189

non-immunologic (direct histamine release).
Respiratory manifestations: These are important components of
anaphylaxis but are uncommon in isolation.

Epidemiology
Food allergies are over-reported by patients, which is one of many
obstacles in establishing the true prevalence of FA.
Objective measurements are necessary to make an accurate FA
diagnosis.
Milk, egg, and peanut account for the vast majority of allergic
reactions in young children.
Peanut, tree nuts, and seafood account for the vast majority of
reactions in teenagers and adults.
The following data are drawn from a recent meta-analysis of 51
publications2:
Self-reported FA to cow’s milk, hen’s eggs, peanuts, fish, or crustacean
shellfish: 13% for adults, 12% for children.
When objective measures were employed, including skin test, serum
IgE, or food challenge, the overall prevalence dropped to 3% for all
ages.
US prevalence rates for specific foods1:
Peanut allergy: 0.4–0.8%.
Tree nut allergy: 0.4%.
Seafood allergy: 0.6% in children, 2.8% in adults.
Most children with FA will eventually tolerate cow’s milk, egg,
wheat, and soy but far fewer eventually tolerate peanut and
tree nuts.
Allergy to seafood most commonly develops in adulthood and
usually persists.
A high initial level of allergen-specific IgE to a food is associated with a
lower resolution rate over time.
The resolution of AD is a useful marker for the onset of tolerance to food
allergens.
A decrease in the level of allergen-specific IgE is often associated with
the ability to tolerate foods.

Pathophysiology
In the normal mature gut, about 2% of ingested food antigens penetrate
190

the GI tract barrier and enter the circulation.3
The majority of individuals develop what is known as oral tolerance to
these antigens, which is a state of immunologic unresponsiveness.
A failure to develop tolerance or a breakdown in this process results in
excessive production of food-specific IgE antibodies.
When food allergens penetrate the mucosal barriers and reach these
antibodies bound to mast cells or basophils, mediators are released,
which result symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity, including
vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction, and mucus secretion (type I
hypersensitivity).
These cells also may release cytokines and other mediators that
contribute to a late-phase response.
The clinical manifestations of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity are widely
variable but depend on various host and antigen factors.
As for non–IgE-mediated food reactions, pathogenic factors are not well
defined, but, like IgE-mediated FA, likely involve a break in oral
tolerance resulting in an inappropriate immune response to orally
ingested antigens.

Risk Factors
Biologic parents or siblings with existing, or history of, allergic rhinitis,
asthma, AD, or FA increase risk of FA.
Presence of AD, especially when severe with early onset, is associated
with increased risk of food sensitization.
Asthma is the risk factor most commonly identified with the
greatest severity of allergic reactions to foods.
Complementary factors that affect the absorption of a food allergen may
increase the severity of a reaction and should be taken into account.
These include concomitant alcohol consumption, use of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and exercise.

Prevention
The following are not recommended, as there is insufficient evidence to
support the idea that such practices prevent the development or clinical
course of FA:
Limited exposure to non-food allergens (e.g., dust, pollen, pet dander)
even for those patients considered to have increased risk for the
development of FA.
191

Routine FA testing prior to the introduction of allergenic foods.
Maternal diet restriction during pregnancy or lactation.
Use of soy infant formula instead of cow’s milk infant formula in at-risk
infants.
Delayed introduction of solid foods beyond 4–6 months of age.

Associated Conditions
Children with FA are 2.3 times more likely to have asthma, 2.3 times
more likely to have AD, and 3.6 times more likely to have respiratory
allergies than children without FA.1
Asthmatics that also have FA are more likely to have increased rates of
emergency department visits and hospitalization in an intensive care
unit for their asthma than non-food allergic asthmatics.
EoE is frequently associated with FA.
Exercise-induced anaphylaxis in adults is triggered by foods about onethird of the time, according to patient report.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Manifestations of an immune-mediated reaction to food can vary widely.
Most IgE-mediated reactions are considered to be immediate, meaning
they occur within minutes to a few hours.
Delayed responses occur within several hours to a few days and are
thought to involve cellular mechanisms.
Food-induced anaphylaxis (see Chap. 13) is the most common,
serious consequence of FA.
Typically IgE-mediated and believed to involve systemic mediator
release from sensitized mast cells and basophils.
Significantly under-recognized and under-treated.
Prompt recognition and management is essential to ensure a
favorable outcome.
Fatalities can occur within 30 minutes of exposure and usually result
from respiratory compromise.

Differential Diagnosis
Acute allergic reactions triggered by other allergens, such as medications
192

or insect stings.
AD flares triggered by other irritants.
Chronic GI symptoms due to reflux, infection, anatomical abnormalities,
or metabolic disorders.
Chemical and irritant effects of foods, such as gustatory rhinitis due to
neurologic responses to temperature or capsaicin.
Gustatory flushing syndrome is an erythematous band on the cheek in
the distribution of the auriculotemporal nerve, triggered by tart foods.
Food poisoning due to bacterial toxins or scombroid poisoning.
For those with eosinophilic GI disorders, other diagnoses such as
parasitic infections, GI reflux disease (GERD), systemic eosinophilic
disorders, and vasculitis should be considered.
Mental/behavioral disorders resulting in food aversion.
Pharmacologic effects such as tryptamine in tomatoes and food additives
may mimic allergic symptoms of the skin and GI tract.

Diagnostic Testing
Diagnostic testing is based on a comprehensive history, which should
suggest whether or not the reaction was IgE- or non–IgE-mediated. This
determines the kind of testing to pursue and the possible foods involved.
Testing should not be comprised of general broad panels of food
allergens.
Laboratories
Total serum IgE:
Although it is often elevated in atopic individuals, it not a sensitive
and specific test for FAs.
Obtaining this study for the purpose of providing a ratio of foodspecific IgE to total IgE offers no advantage over food-specific IgE
alone in the diagnosis of FA.
Food allergen-specific serum IgE:
Formerly measured using the radioallergosorbent test (RAST),
specific IgE levels are now measured by more sensitive
fluorescence enzyme-labeled assays.
Similar to skin prick text (SPT) in the sense that these tests are useful
in indentifying foods that may be provoking IgE-mediated food
allergic reactions but are not diagnostic of FA alone.
Very useful in detecting allergic sensitization, meaning the presence of
193

allergen-specific antibodies; sensitization does not always correlate
with clinical allergy.
Especially useful when SPT cannot be done, either due to clinical
contraindications or failure to discontinue antihistamines prior to the
test.
Studies support the idea that specific IgE antibody levels directly
correlate with likelihood of clinical reactivity.4
Mast cell and basophil mediators:
Histamine and tryptase are rarely used to support the diagnosis of
food-induced anaphylaxis.
Tryptase lacks specificity and may not be elevated in foodinduced anaphylaxis.

Diagnostic Procedures
Skin Prick Test
SPT assists in the identification of foods that potentially induce IgEmediated reactions but is not diagnostic of FA when used alone.
It reflects the IgE bound to cutaneous mast cells.
SPT has a low positive predictive value, as many patients have IgE
to certain foods without clinical FA.
When the patient provides a history very suspicious for FA, SPTs are
valuable in identifying the foods responsible, and therefore have high
sensitivity and a high negative predictive value in this clinical
setting.
Results are immediately available, making SPT the most commonly
performed procedure in the evaluation of IgE-mediated FA.
The patient must be off all antihistamine medications for 1 week
prior to the procedure to insure the reliability of the test.
Intradermal Tests
This method is not more sensitive than SPT in detecting food protein–
induced allergic reactions.
The risk of systemic adverse allergic reactions is greater compared to
SPT.
Intradermal tests are rarely indicated for the evaluation of FA.
Other
Oral food challenges:
194

The double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the
gold standard for diagnosing FA, but its use is limited by time
and expense.
Single-blind and open food challenges are frequently used to screen
patients for FA.
Should be designed and performed under medical supervision and
avoided in patients with a recent life-threatening reaction to a
particular food.
Food elimination diets:
Cutting out one or a few specific foods may be useful in the diagnosis
of FA, especially in the setting of non–IgE-mediated disorders such as
FPIES.
Prolonged elimination diets consisting of multiple foods are not
recommended.

TREATMENT
Medications
Epinephrine
Prompt and rapid IM epinephrine after onset of symptoms of anaphylaxis
is first-line therapy.
Benefits of epinephrine far outweigh the risks and delays in
epinephrine administration are associated with increased morbidity and
death.
Dosing:
Autoinjector (IM): 0.15 mg for individuals 10–30 kg; 0.3 mg for those
>30 kg.
Epinephrine IM 1:1,000 solution: 0.1 mg/kg, maximum dose of 0.3 mg.
The anterior-lateral thigh is the preferred injection site.
IV epinephrine is recommended for patients who do not respond to IM
epinephrine and whose fluid status may not be adequate for muscle
perfusion.
Repeated epinephrine dosing is required up to 20% of the time
and can be done every 5–15 minutes in patients with ongoing or
progressive symptoms.
After epinephrine administration, the patient should be transferred to an
emergency facility for observation for at least 4–6 hours and possible
195

further treatment.
Adjunctive Treatment
Epinephrine is the only first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, and there is
no substitute.
The following treatments are adjunctive, and there are little or no data
demonstrating their effectiveness:
Inhaled b2-agonist every 20 minutes or continuously as needed.
Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine 1–2 mg/kg/dose, maximum 50 mg
IV or oral (preferably liquid for ready absorption); ranitidine 1–2
mg/kg/dose, max 150 mg oral and IV.
Prednisone 1 mg/kg oral or methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV, maximum
60–80 mg for both.
Oxygen therapy.
Large volume IV fluids.
Recumbent positioning with lower extremities elevated.
In the hospital setting, vasopressors or glucagon can be given for
refractory hypotension.
Discharge Therapy
Epinephrine autoinjector prescription/instructions, allergen avoidance
education, follow-up with primary care physician, consider referral to an
allergist.
Adjunctive over the next 48–72 hours: Diphenhydramine every 6 hours,
ranitidine twice daily, and prednisone.
There are no medications that are currently recommended for the
prevention of IgE- or non–IgE-mediated food allergic reactions.
Milder Food Allergic Reactions
Symptoms such as flushing, urticaria, mild angioedema, or OAS can be
treated with antihistamines.
If progression is noted, epinephrine should be given immediately.
If the patient has a history of prior severe allergic reaction, epinephrine
should be given earlier in the course.
Immunotherapy for Food Allergy
While allergen-specific immunotherapy has been shown to improve clinical
symptoms of FA for some patients, it is not recommended at this time
because of the risk of severe reaction combined with unclear
196

long-term efficacy in preventing future food-allergic reactions.

Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Diet
Allergen avoidance is currently the safest strategy for managing
IgE-mediated and non–IgE-mediated FA.
Food allergen avoidance in patients with documented FA may reduce the
severity of associated comorbid conditions such as AD and EoE.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Vaccinations in Patients with Egg Allergy
Many vaccines are grown in chick embryos and may contain small,
variable amounts of egg protein.
The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and MMRV (measles, mumps,
rubella, and varicella) vaccines are safe in egg-allergic children, even in
those with a history of severe reaction to egg.
Influenza:
Either the inactivated or live-attenuated vaccine should not be given
to children with history of:
Egg-allergic symptoms with co-existent asthma or
Systemic anaphylaxis to egg.
Unless:
The vaccine contains <1.2 μg/mL of ovalbumin or
The patient has had a negative result on skin prick testing with the
vaccine.
In the case of positive SPT, the vaccine can be given but the dose
should be divided: One-tenth followed by the remainder if the initial
dose is tolerated.
Rabies and yellow fever vaccines should not be given to patients with
egg allergy, unless an allergy evaluation and testing to the vaccine has
been done.

PATIENT EDUCATION
Food Labeling
Patients with FAs and their caregivers must be educated on the
197

interpretation of ingredient lists on food labels to optimize trigger
avoidance.
In 2004, a law was passed by the US Congress requiring that products
containing any of the eight major food allergens must clearly
list them on the label in simple English. This includes peanut, tree
nuts, egg, milk, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish.

Emergency Management
Patients with FAs and their caregivers should be informed on the risk of
anaphylaxis and should be able to recognize signs and symptoms early.
Families should be equipped with the knowledge and skills to handle
such medical emergencies, including understanding of and ready access
to an anaphylaxis emergency action plan.
Epinephrine autoinjector teaching should be done in the office and the
clinician should ensure that the patients/caregivers are familiar with the
sequence of events according to the action plan.
Patients should wear medical identification jewelry or carry an
anaphylaxis wallet card.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Annual testing is reasonable to evaluate whether a patient has outgrown
allergy to those foods that are likely to resolve over time (e.g., milk,
egg, wheat, and soy), assuming the patient has not had a recent
reaction to those foods.
Testing for ongoing allergy to peanut, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish should
not be performed more frequently than every 2 to 3 years since allergy
to these foods is not typically outgrown quickly.

17 Latex Hypersensitivity
Eric Karlin
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Latex hypersensitivity refers to immunologic reactions, both
immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and cell-mediated, when sensitized
individuals are exposed to latex-containing materials.1
Latex allergy (LA), however, refers only to immediate hypersensitivity
reactions caused by exposure to products containing natural rubber latex
in persons with latex-specific IgE. Clinical reactions include urticaria,
asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, or even anaphylaxis.
Latex sensitivity is diagnosed in patients with elevated levels of latexspecific IgE or a positive latex skin test. It does not necessarily
indicate clinical allergy but rather the presence of a latex-specific
IgE.

Epidemiology
Although there was a dramatic increase in reported LA with the
institution of universal precautions in the 1980s, more recent years have
seen a decrease in the incidence of LA, likely due to improvements in
the manufacturing process and creation of latex-safe environments.
A recent meta-analysis has estimated the prevalence of latex sensitivity
to be between 0.5% and 5% for the general population and between
2.5% and 13% for health care workers.2
It is estimated that LA occurs in 4–5% of the health care worker
population, which is three times more prevalent LA than in the
general population.2
Increased prevalence of LA has been reported among patients with spina
bifida and those with a history of multiple surgeries early in life.3

Pathophysiology
Natural rubber is a highly processed plant product derived from the milky
200

sap of the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis.
The harvested rubber is then processed in one of two ways:
Most latex is coagulated by acid to create molded rubber products
such as catheters and pneumatic tires for vehicles.
Alternatively, latex may be ammoniated with the addition of
accelerators, antioxidants, and preservatives to create dipped latex
products.
Dipped latex products are used to create latex gloves and are thought to
carry the highest allergen content and cause most anaphylactic
reactions to natural rubber latex.
There are currently 13 known Hevea latex allergens, Hev b 1 through
Hev b 13, that have been identified using molecular techniques.1 Hev b
1 and Hev b 3 are major allergens for children with multiple congenital
anomalies, whereas Hev b 2, Hev b 4, and Hev b 5 are involved in LA
among health care workers.1
30–50% of patients who are natural rubber latex allergic show an
associated allergy to some foods, especially kiwi, banana, avocado,
peach, tomato, potato, and bell pepper. This association, known as the
latex-fruit syndrome, is due to cross-reactivity of epitopes between
phylogenetically similar plant proteins.4 Proteins involved include
chitinase, b-1,3-glucanase, profilin, and lipid transfer protein.4

Risk Factors
Risk factors for the development of latex hypersensitivity include atopy,
health care workers, non–health care workers with occupational exposure
to latex, and children with spina bifida or genitourinary abnormalities who
have undergone multiple surgeries.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common reaction to latex
products and is often confused with latex hypersensitivity.
It is a non-immunologic reaction causing erythema, scaling, and
fissures on the dorsum of the hand.
This condition is secondary to the irritant effects of repeated hand
washing, occlusion from sweat, and an alkaline glove pH.
201

Allergic contact dermatitis (see also Chap. 11) refers to a delayedtype hypersensitivity that occurs 1 or 2 days after contact with latex.
Patients present with erythema, pruritus, and vesicles with crusting on
the dorsum of the hands.
This response is a cell-mediated type IV hypersensitivity
reaction to additive oxidants and accelerator chemicals that are
used in the latex manufacturing process rather than Hev b antigens.5
Allergic contact urticaria is an IgE-mediated immediate-type
hypersensitivity to natural rubber proteins and is the most
common allergic reaction reported by health care workers who use latex
gloves.6 Patients present with urticarial lesions 10–15 minutes
after gloves are worn.
Rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma may occur when sensitized patients
inhale latex allergens adsorbed by cornstarch powder found in gloves.
This type I immediate hypersensitivity may induce ocular itching,
tearing, rhinitis, and wheezing.
Anaphylaxis has been reported when sensitive individuals are exposed
to latex products.
Although anaphylaxis is rare, most episodes occur during surgical
procedures, childbirth, gynecologic examinations, or dental
procedures.7
Anaphylaxis has also been associated with inhalational exposure.

Diagnostic Testing
Skin testing with natural rubber latex is widely performed in Europe
and Canada to identify those individuals sensitive to latex products.
Currently, no commercial skin test reagent is available in the
United States.8
Allergists in the United States have attempted skin testing by creating
their own reagents in the office using Hevea latex products.
Unfortunately, these products vary widely in their allergen contents
and systemic reactions have been reported with the use of these nonstandardized preparations.
Nevertheless, skin prick tests with latex extracts may be considered in
patients with a strong clinical history and negative serologic testing.9
Serologic testing for the detection of latex-specific IgE may be
performed when clinically indicated. None of the assays can
202

demonstrate complete diagnostic reliability and results must be
interpreted in the context of the clinical suspicion for LA.
Provocational challenge studies have been performed on patients
with negative results from serologic or skin prick testing when they have
strong clinical histories that support LA.
Various tests including closely monitored glove use, nasal provocation,
and inhalation challenge have been performed.6
The usefulness of these tests is limited by the widely varying allergen
contents of latex gloves from different manufacturers. For this reason,
many of these procedures are typically limited to research procedures
and are not used clinically.
Patch testing using a standard screening panel containing the additive
oxidant and accelerator chemicals that are used in the latex
manufacturing process may be used to help distinguish irritant contact
dermatitis from allergic contact dermatitis.10

TREATMENT
The mainstay of latex hypersensitivity and LA management focuses on
avoidance of latex products.
All latex-sensitive individuals should be educated on all personal and
medical products that may contain latex.
Because most IgE-mediated reactions to latex occur in health care
workers or latex-sensitive individuals undergoing medical procedures,
efforts have been placed to create “latex-safe” clinics and hospitals.
Prior to hospital admission and surgical procedures, screening
questions should be asked to identify patients with possible latex
sensitization (Table 17-1).
Once LA is detected, documentation and education regarding latex
avoidance is imperative.
Establishment of a “latex-safe” environment through creation of a
latex committee and establishment of an institutional program has
been widely successful in decreasing latex-induced symptoms.11
TABLE 17.1 SCREENING QUESTIONS FOR LATEX SENSITIZATION

203

TABLE 17.2 LATEX-CONTAINING PRODUCTS

It is recommended that all latex-containing products be removed from
all hospital environments of any patient with LA, and that a latex-free
operating room should be constructed for these patients.
The FDA has established guidelines for labeling of any medical devices
containing latex. A brief list of medical and household products that may
contain latex is given in Table 17-2.
Alternatives to latex gloves include vinyl, nitrile, neoprene, and
styrene gloves.
Vinyl gloves are similar in cost to latex gloves but are less protective
against viral penetration.
Neoprene and styrene gloves are used mostly for surgical purposes
and are five to ten times more expensive that latex gloves.
Nitrile gloves appear to be most comparable to latex gloves;
however, they are produced with the same accelerator used in the
production of latex gloves and may cause irritant or contact
dermatitis.
Immunotherapy for the treatment of IgE-mediated LA has been
204

studied using both subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual
immunotherapy. However, results have varied, and a high frequency of
adverse events was reported in multiple studies.12,13

18 Conditions Associated with Eosinophilia
Bob Geng
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Eosinophilia is defined as peripheral blood eosinophil count >0.5 ×
109 cells/L.
The term hypereosinophilia applies to >1.5 × 109 cells/L eosinophil
count in the peripheral blood.1

Classification
Allergic diseases: Atopic disease (allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma) and
drug-induced.
Infectious diseases: Parasitic (helminthes) and fungal (Aspergillus
spp.
[allergic
bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis
(ABPA)]
or
coccidioidomycosis).
Hematologic and neoplastic: Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES),
leukemia, lymphoma, tumor-associated mastocytosis.
Diseases with specific organ involvement: Skin, pulmonary,
gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, and renal disorders.
Immunologic reactions: Immunodeficiency and transplant rejection.
Endocrine disorders: Hypoadrenalism.
Miscellaneous disorders: Atheroembolic disease and serosal irritation.

Pathophysiology
Eosinophils are bone marrow–derived granulocytes involved in allergic
and nonallergic inflammation.
Average survival in the peripheral circulation ranges from 6–12 hours but
in tissue survival time increases to several weeks.
Eosinophils contain and can release large amounts of preformed
cytotoxic basic proteins from intracellular granules. They include
major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil peroxidase,
and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin.
207

Eosinophils can also produce superoxide, leukotrienes, and various
inflammatory cytokines.
These cytotoxic proteins are involved in the host defense against
parasites. However, when released near host cells, they can cause
significant
damage
by promoting inflammation, thrombosis,
angiogenesis, and connective tissue formation.
Eosinophil growth factor cytokines include interleukin (IL)-5, IL-3, and
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); the
elevation of these cytokines lead to eosinophilopoiesis and prolongation
of eosinophil survival time via inhibition of eosinophil apoptosis.
Diurnal variations of peripheral blood eosinophil count occurs with the
peak at night and trough in the morning—inversely proportional to the
circulating endogenous adrenocorticosteroid level.2
Peripheral blood eosinophil count is not always indicative of the degree
of eosinophil activity because they are primarily tissue-dwelling
cells. There can be several hundred times more eosinophils in particular
tissues than in the blood.2
The presence of increased amount of eosinophils in tissue usually
denotes a pathologic condition.
The arbitrary threshold of 1.5 × 109 cells/L has been classically used as
the peripheral blood level to suggest possibility of sufficient tissue
infiltration of eosinophils to cause target-organ damage. However, there
is no precise correlation between peripheral blood level and target organ
infiltration.1
Allergic disease is the most common etiology of eosinophilia in
North America, but parasitic infection is the most common etiology
globally.
Allergic disease and drug reactions are usually only associated with mild
eosinophilia (<1.5 × 109 cells/L); if the level of eosinophilia is above
that, it raises the possibility of more serious underlying conditions.
Specific mechanisms of disease processes will be discussed separately
under differential diagnosis.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
208

Medication history is very important since it may lead to the discovery of
a temporal relationship between the initiation of a new medication
with the onset of eosinophilia due to drug reaction.
Travel history: Since many eosinophilic disorders can be caused by
parasitic infections, it is essential to determine whether the patient
has traveled to any tropical environments or developing countries
particularly those that are endemic to certain parasitic infections
commonly associated with eosinophilia. The temporal relationship of the
travel and the onset of eosinophilia need to be determined.
Social history: Need to determine possible occupational or home
allergen exposures.
Review of systems: Since eosinophilic conditions can affect many organ
systems and can manifest in a myriad of syndromes, it is crucial to take
a detailed review of systems in order to assess for presence of
constitutional symptoms as well as any target-organ involvement or
damage.

Differential Diagnosis
Allergic Diseases
Allergic rhinitis is associated with nasal tissue eosinophilia.
Both nasal and blood eosinophilia can be associated with the nonallergic
rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES).
Chronic sinusitis is associated with both tissue and blood eosinophilia.
Both allergic and nonallergic asthma is associated with airway tissue
eosinophilia and allergic asthma is associated with blood eosinophilia.
Careful environmental and allergen history may reveal pertinent
exposures.
Medication-Induced Causes
Careful medication history is necessary for evaluation, especially any
new drugs.
Eosinophilia can occur independent of systemic manifestations or organ
dysfunction.
Interstitial nephritis:
Common offending agents include penicillin, nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cimetidine, sulfonamides, captopril,
allopurinol, diphenylhydantoin, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, aztreonam,
triazolam, and warfarin.
209

Eosinophiluria in acute interstitial nephritis is only 40–60% sensitive.3
Hepatitis: Minocycline, choline magnesium trisalicylate, halothane,
methoxyflurane, salicylazosulfapyridine, ranitidine, carbamazepine,
phenytoin, and sulfa antibiotics.
Pulmonary eosinophilia: Many antimicrobial agents, NSAIDs,
dantrolene (both pleural and blood eosinophilia).
Drug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms (DRESS):
DRESS can occur weeks after starting several types of medications
including aromatic anticonvulsants (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine,
and phenobarbital), dapsone, minocycline, sulfonamides, allopurinol,
and nevirapine.1,4
Common signs include lymphadenopathy, high-grade fever, and organ
involvement. Skin lesions are diffuse, progressively evolving, and
pruritic.
Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a systemic adverse reaction to
ingestion of substances containing L-tryptophan; pulmonary involvement
was noted in 50–60% of cases.
Toxic oil syndrome is associated with ingestion of oil contaminated
with denatured rapeseed oil.
Cytokine therapies: High doses of GM-CSF and IL-2 can lead to
eosinophilic myocarditis and biventricular thrombosis.5
Infectious Causes
Helminthic infections:
Eosinophilia may be a clue to the presence of helminthic infection.
Helminths that are sequestered within tissues or contained in the
intestinal lumen may not present with blood eosinophilia.
Occasional leakage of fluids from echinococcal cysts may lead to
transient increases in blood eosinophilia causing allergic response
and/or anaphylactic reactions.
In the United States, Strongyloides, Ascaris, Toxocara, and
Ancylostoma are the most common parasites causing pulmonary
infiltrates.
Strongyloides infection can be indolent for decades causing
eosinophilia. The use of corticosteroids for eosinophilia in patients
with occult infection may lead to disseminated, possibly fatal,
infection.
Most protozoan parasites do not elicit blood eosinophilia except for
210

Dientamoeba fragilis and Isospora belli.2
Fungal infections: ABPA and coccidioidomycosis.
Retroviral infections:
HIV with leucopenia leading to relative eosinophilia, medicationrelated, and adrenal insufficiency from opportunistic cytomegalovirus
(CMV) infection.
HTLV-1 infections.
Hematologic and Neoplastic Disorders
Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES):
Persistent eosinophilia of >1,500 cells/mL.
No identifiable parasitic, allergic, or eosinophilic syndrome etiology.
Signs and symptoms of organ involvement.
HES affects men more than women at ratio of 9:1 and generally
present from ages 20–50, but there are also pediatric cases.6
Common symptoms include fatigue, cough, dyspnea, myalgia,
angioedema, rash, fever, and retinal disease.
Organ systems affected include cardiovascular, cutaneous, neurologic,
pulmonary, GI, and hepatic.
Cardiac involvement of HES:
The pathogenesis involves stages.
First acute necrosis happens in the initial weeks of illness and
presents with endocardial damage, myocardial infiltration with
eosinophils and lymphocytes with formation of microabscesses.
During this acute setting patients may develop subungual and/or
conjunctival splinter hemorrhages.
Second, thrombus begins to form on the wall of the damaged
endocardium.
Lastly, the fibrotic stage occurs with scarring leading to restrictive
cardiomyopathy and entrapment of the chordae tendineae with
consequent development of valvular disease.
Neurologic involvement of HES:
Embolic strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) from
intracardiac thrombus formation can still occur even on warfarin
and antiplatelet agents.2
Behavioral changes may include confusion, ataxia, and memory loss
with upper motor neuron signs.
Peripheral neuropathy represents 50% of all neurologic
211

manifestations.
Leukemia:
Acute eosinophilic leukemia is a rare subtype of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML).
Eosinophilia can also be a manifestation of the M4E0 subtype of AML.
Eosinophilia can be a feature of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
as well.
It is generally not seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Lymphoma:
Peripheral blood eosinophilia can be seen in some patients with
Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
The involvement with Hodgkin’s disease is generally attributed to the
expression of IL-5 mRNA by Reed–Sternberg cells.
Certain B-cell lymphomas may be associated with eosinophilia.
Eosinophilia with eczema can be seen in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
Mastocytosis:
Peripheral blood eosinophilia is seen in approximately 25% of
systemic mastocytosis cases.2
See Chapter 19 for a more detailed discussion of mastocytosis.
Solid tumors:
Large cell nonkeratinizing cervical tumors.
Large cell undifferentiated lung cancer.
Various mucosal membrane squamous cell carcinomas.
Adenocarcinoma of the GI tract and uterus as well as transitional cell
carcinoma of the bladder can be associated with varying levels of
eosinophilia.
Dermatologic Disorders
Eosinophilia may be associated with general dermatologic
conditions including atopic dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus
vulgaris, psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiformis, herpes gestationis, and
chronic urticaria.
Eosinophilic panniculitis: Nodular lesions caused by infiltration of
eosinophils into the subcutaneous fat. This condition is often associated
with gnathostomiasis (also known as larva migrans profundus),
leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and erythema nodosum.
Episodic angioedema with eosinophilia: Presents with episodic
angioedema with eosinophilia, urticaria, pruritus, fever, and weight gain.
212

Serum IgM is often elevated. Excellent long-term prognosis and is
usually steroid-responsive.2
Kimura’s disease: Large subcutaneous masses on the head and neck
of Asian males associated with eosinophilia.
Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia: Similar to Kimura’s
disease but with smaller superficial lesions and can occur in any race.
Eosinophilic fasciitis (Shulman’s syndrome): Acute presentation of
swelling, erythema, and induration of the extremities often precipitated
by exercise. Blood eosinophil level is elevated. The major pathology
occurs in the subcutaneous tissues. MRI is the imaging study of choice
for diagnosis and monitoring.
Eosinophilic cellulitis (Well’s syndrome): Recurrent episodes of
cellulitis-like swelling of the extremities with minimal tenderness, no
warmth, and not responsive to antibiotic therapy. Peripheral blood
eosinophilia can be seen in half of the patients. The lesion generally
resolves spontaneously.2
Eosinophilic ulcer of the oral mucosa: Multiple ulcerated tender
lesions affecting the tongue that is often precipitated by trauma. The
lesions generally resolve spontaneously over a month.
Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis: Seen in HIV or other
immunosuppressed patients.
Recurrent cutaneous necrotizing eosinophilic vasculitis:
Eosinophilic infiltration of the lumen and vessel walls of small dermal
vessels. Eosinophilic vasculitis can be associated with connective tissue
disorders and hypocomplementemia. These patients generally respond
to steroid treatment and have good prognosis.2
Pulmonary Disorders
The pulmonary disorders associated with eosinophilia and their
relationship to asthma are presented in Table 18-1.
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia:
Insidious onset (>1 month) of cough, fever, night sweats, dyspnea,
weight loss. Less than one-third of patients have sputum production
or wheezing.
Male to female ratio is 1:2 and the peak incidence is in fifth decade of
life.2
Half of the patients have atopic disease and some patients have
comorbid asthma.
213

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP):
Acute onset between 1–5 days of cough, dyspnea, fever, pleuritic
chest pain, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and myalgias.
TABLE 18.1 PULMONARY DISORDERS WITH EOSINOPHILIA

Male predominant.
The exact etiology is unknown but AEP may be a form of acute
hypersensitivity reaction to inhaled allergens.
AEP has been associated with NSAIDs, antidepressants, new-onset
smoking, and parasitic infections.
Churg–Strauss syndrome:
Characterized by hypereosinophilia, systemic vasculitis, and asthma.
Asthma and eosinophilia may precede vasculitis in many of patients.
Vasculitis of small- and medium-sized vessels.
Classical clinical presentation consists of an asthma patient with sinus
disease, neuropathy, constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, and
fatigue), and vasculitis that may affect the skin, heart, GI tract,
kidney, or nervous system.
Cutaneous lesions include maculopapular erythematous rash,
petechiae, purpura or ecchymoses, and tender nodular lesions.
Diagnostic criteria are four out of the six following features: Asthma,
eosinophilia >10%, neuropathy, pulmonary infiltrates, sinus
abnormalities, and tissue eosinophilia on lung biopsy.7
Löffler’s syndrome (helminthic larval transpulmonary
migration):
The larva of Ascaris, hookworms, and Strongyloides transit through
the blood, penetrate into the alveoli and migrate through the airway
to enter the GI tract through the esophagus. The migration through
214

the airway generally takes place 9–12 days after the ingestion of
helminthic eggs. Ascaris is the most common parasite that causes
Löffler’s syndrome and is most likely to elicit symptoms.2
The typical clinical presentation (acute symptoms generally resolve
between 5 and 10 days) includes nonproductive cough, burning
substernal pain, rales, and wheezing.
Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia:
This is an immune response to the microfilarial stages of Wuchereria
bancrofti and Brugia malayi in the lung.
Endemic to Asia, Indian subcontinent, Africa, South America, and the
Caribbean.
The clinical presentation may include constitutional symptoms (e.g.,
weight loss, fever, night sweats, and fatigue), dyspnea, and asthma
symptoms (nocturnal cough and wheezing), and hemoptysis.
Drug- and toxin-induced eosinophilic lung disease:
Many drugs are associated with pulmonary eosinophilia including
methotrexate, nitrofurantoin, sulfa compounds, gold, salicylates, and
antiepileptics.
Toxic occupational exposures include aluminum silicate, sulfite
exposure in grape workers, and chemical fume exposure by rubber
workers.2
The clinical presentation ranges from simple pulmonary eosinophilia to
severe symptoms such as AEP.
ABPA is discussed in Chapter 4.
Pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma (PEG):
PEG is a rare fibro-inflammatory disease with interstitial infiltrates
composed of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and Langerhans cells.
It is thought to be a type of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, derived from
CD1+ and HLA-DR Langerhans cells.
Clinical presentation includes pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, weight
loss, fever, and hemoptysis.
Bone involvement may be associated with erosive lesions from
expansion of cells in the medullary cavity. PEG should be suspected
when patients develop insidious onset of cough in setting of these
bony lesions.
PEG is also association with cigarette smoking.2
Spontaneous pneumothorax has been associated with PEG.
215

Eosinophils are found in lesions, but it is not usually associated with
blood eosinophilia and not seen in the airways.
Spontaneous resolution has been seen but it may progress to
pulmonary fibrosis.
Bronchocentric granulomatosis:
Clinical presentation includes cough, fever, chest pain, and
hemoptysis.
Two-thirds of patients do not have asthma.
In nonasthmatic patients, there is an association with mycobacterial or
fungal infections.
Gastrointestinal Disorders
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE):
The presence of eosinophils in the esophagus is pathologic since
normal esophagus should not contain eosinophils.8
Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) can also be associated with
esophageal eosinophilia.
EE is associated with both food and aero-allergens.9
Eotaxin-3 is over-expressed in EE patients compared to the general
population and may contribute to the pathogenesis of EE.8
Patients present with vomiting, epigastric pain, dysphagia, and food
impaction.
It is more common in males.
EE differs from GERD in the following ways: High prevalence of atopy,
higher prevalence of food sensitization, commonly causes food
impaction, normal pH in the esophagus, involvement of the proximal
esophagus, higher level of eosinophils (>15/high-power field), and
elevated eotaxin-3.8
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis:
Generally of idiopathic etiology, but like EE it is associated with food
allergen sensitization.
Increased peripheral blood IL-4 and IL-5.10
It is associated with IgA deficiency.8
Patients present with vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody
stools, malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy, and gastric outlet
obstruction.
Eosinophilic colitis:
Generally not an IgE-mediated disease, possibly a T cell–driven
216

process; offending protein triggers in the diet have been implicated in
eosinophilic colitis of infants; pathogenesis is unclear.
Bi modal age distribution with the first peak around 60 days of age
and second peak around adolescence and early adulthood.8
The presentation consists of diarrhea (may be bloody), weight loss,
abdominal pain, and anorexia.
Other GI disorders associated with varying degrees of tissue
eosinophilia include Crohn’s, disease, ulcerative colitis, GERD, and
Helicobacter pylori infections.
Urinary Tract Disorders
Eosinophiluria may be present in the following conditions:
Drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis.
Urinary tract infection, a common cause of eosinophiluria (minimal
amount).
Rapidly progressive and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.
Eosinophilic prostatitis.
Bladder cancer.
Schistosomiasis with bladder involvement.
Eosinophilic cystitis:
Patients present with dysuria, hematuria, frequency, and suprapubic
pain.
It is more common in the pediatric population.
Its etiology is unknown.
Most patients have spontaneous resolution and an overall benign
course, but the condition is associated with possibility of bladder
carcinoma. Certain patients may develop renal failure and bladder
destruction.2
Dialysis:
Patients on hemodialysis may develop mild eosinophilia.
Patients on peritoneal dialysis may have episodic peritoneal
eosinophilia and possibly peripheral blood eosinophilia that may be
associated with infections.
Other
Hypoadrenalism:
Corticosteroids induce eosinophil apoptosis.
Adrenal insufficiency in the form of Addison’s disease, adrenal
217

hemorrhage, hypopituitarism leads to decreased levels of endogenous
corticosteroid production, thus, leading to peripheral blood
eosinophilia.
Atheroembolic disease may occur spontaneously or post-procedural.
Serosal irritation:
Dressler’s
syndrome
(post-myocardial/post-pericardiotomy
pericarditis).
Eosinophilic pleural effusions.
Eosinophilic ascites.
Primary immunodeficiency: In patients with hyper-IgE syndrome,
eosinophilia may be found in the peripheral blood, tissue, or sputum.
Transplant rejection:
Tissue infiltration of eosinophils is associated with acute allograft
rejection for lung, kidney, and liver transplants.
Eosinophilia of the blood and urine can be associated with both acute
and chronic rejection of kidney allograft.
With liver allograft rejection, peripheral and tissue eosinophilia may
have diagnostic and prognostic utility as well as monitoring of the
efficacy of rejection therapy.2
Tissue eosinophilia may be present in cutaneous graft-versus-host
disease.

Diagnostic Testing
General laboratory and diagnostic testing:
Comprehensive metabolic panel, absolute eosinophil count, and a
chest radiograph.
If a vasculitic syndrome is suspected, then antineutrophil cytoplasmic
antibody (ANCA) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) should be
obtained.
If parasitic infection is a possibility, then stool ova and parasite
evaluation as well as parasitic antigens and serologic testing should
be obtained.
Allergic disease: If there are symptoms of allergic rhinitis or asthma,
skin testing, and/or radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) for common
aero-allergens can be performed.
Medication induced: Careful medication history and documentation of
time course of drug use and initiation is necessary for evaluation,
218

especially any new drugs.
Infectious:
Stool studies are useful for enteric helminthes, but serologic testing is
more sensitive and necessary for most infections.
Serologic testing and/or lung biopsy are indicated for
coccidioidomycosis; skin biopsy may be helpful in disseminated
infection.
Serum total IgE level, Aspergillus-specific IgE level, and skin testing
for Aspergillus are used in ABPA.
HIV and HTLV-1 serologies.
Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES):
Myeloproliferative variant HES:
Elevated vitamin B12 level, splenomegaly, cytogenetic
abnormalities, and anemia may all be found.
Bone marrow biopsy may demonstrate extensive eosinophilic
involvement or myelofibrosis.
May possess a fusion gene encoding FIP1L1/PDGFRA (plateletderived growth factor alpha-receptor) protein expressing receptor
kinase activity.
FIP1L1/PDGFRA may be detected by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) for the CHIC-2 deletion.
Lymphoproliferative variant HES:
There may be clonal expansion of CD3-/CD4+ Th2-like lymphocytes
producing IL-5.2,11
Detection is by flow cytometry as well as T-cell clonality analyses.
IgE level may be elevated.
Cardiac involvement testing:
Troponin elevations may occur during in the acute setting.
Echocardiography may be useful in the later stages of disease.
Contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI has been shown to be sensitive in
detection of cardiac involvement at all stages of disease.
Pulmonary:
The radiographic findings of pulmonary disorders associated with
eosinophilia are presented in Table 18-2.
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia:
Peripheral blood eosinophilia in 90% of patients.12
219

IgE and ESR elevated in most patients.
Eosinophils and lymphocytes are found in bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) fluid.
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) may show diminished lung
volumes, expiratory flow rates, and diffusing capacity.
Acute Eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP):
Diffuse alveolar or alveolar–interstitial infiltrates are seen on chest
radiographs.
Peripheral blood eosinophilia generally peaks around 7–9 days after
presentation.
BAL eosinophils >25% or tissue eosinophilia seen on lung biopsy.
PFTs show decreased total lung capacity, decreased diffusing
capacity, and small airway dysfunction, but generally normal forced
expiratory volume at 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC)
ratio.
Churg–Strauss syndrome:
Peripheral blood eosinophilia, increased ESR, and elevated serum
IgE are usually seen.
A positive serum ANCA is seen in 40–60% of patients, usually
perinuclear-ANCA.
Löffler’s syndrome:
Radiographs show unilateral or bilateral nonsegmental densities
with indefinite borders; infiltrates are migratory and generally
resolve over a few weeks.2
TABLE 18.2 RADIOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF PULMONARY
DISORDERS WITH EOSINOPHILIA

220

Peripheral blood eosinophilia may not be detectable in the early
stage of pulmonary involvement but rises after several days of
symptoms and returns to baseline after several weeks.
Since it generally takes around 40 days for larva to mature into eggproducing adults, stool studies for helminthic ova are generally not
diagnostic.
Diagnosis is difficult to establish and requires finding larva in
respiratory or gastric secretions.
Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia:
221

Peripheral blood eosinophilia, elevated IgG and IgE, and antifilarial
antibodies are usually seen.
Eosinophilia is seen in BAL fluid.
Chest radiographs may show diffuse miliary lesions, consolidations,
cavitations, and reticulonodular infiltrates.2
Lung biopsy reveals eosinophilic infiltration in the early stages and
fibrosis in the later stages; microfilaria may be present.
Gastrointestinal:
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE): Esophageal mucosal biopsy (via
endoscopy), skin-prick testing for food and aero-allergens
sensitization, and delayed skin patch testing are all potentially useful.
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: Endoscopy with biopsy and skin prick
test to detect possible food allergies is necessary. Peripheral
eosinophilia may be absent in one-quarter of patients.8
Eosinophilic colitis: Colonoscopic biopsy, peripheral blood, and stool
may all show eosinophilia.
Eosinophilic cystitis:
Cystoscopy reveals hyperemic mucosa with nodular or elevated
regions.
Biopsy demonstrates eosinophilic infiltrates, IgA and IgE plasma cells,
and muscle necrosis. In more advanced disease fibrosis may be seen.
Pelvic CT may be necessary to rule out other conditions.

TREATMENT
Allergic Diseases
Detailed discussions of the treatment of allergic rhinitis are found in
Chapter 3 and for asthma in Chapter 4.

Medication Induced
Drug therapy suspected of causing eosinophilia does not need to be
stopped unless there is evidence of organ involvement.13
Treatment then requires discontinuation of the offending medication.
Time to resolution of eosinophilia after cessation of the drug is variable.

Infectious
Treatments for helminthic infections are beyond the scope of this chapter
222

but include mebendazole, albendazole, ivermectin, pyrantel pamoate, and
nitazoxanide.

Hypereosinophilic Syndrome
Therapy for HES is not necessary without organ involvement.
Initial treatment for patients without FIP1L1/PDGFRA mutation:
Trial of 60 mg/day or 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone to determine if blood
eosinophilia can be suppressed by steroids.
Steroid dose can be tapered gradually for maintenance.14
Prednisone-sensitive patients have a better prognosis.
Imatinib should be used for the myeloproliferative variant, especially
those with the FIP1L1/PDGFRA mutation.
The dosage generally ranges from 100–400 mg/day.2,15
Prospective studies show significant improvement in clinical and
hematologic markers after therapy.16,17
Second-line agents or steroid-sparing agents:
Hydroxyurea is the most frequently used second-line agent.14
Initial dose of 500–1,000 mg/day which can be increased to 2,000
mg/day.
Female patients need to be on contraception due to its teratogenic
effects.
Interferon (IFN)-a:
INF-a is postulated to inhibit eosinophil proliferation as well as the
inhibition of overall Th2 differentiation.18
Adverse effects include flu-like symptoms, depression, neuropathy,
thyroid dysfunction, and elevated liver enzymes.
Anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies:
Preliminary results have shown some effectiveness in
FIP1L1/PDGFRA-negative HES patients.19,20
Mepolizumab is currently only approved for case-by-case
compassionate use.
Reslizumab is not yet approved for use.
Anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies:
Target the surface protein CD52 that is expressed on eosinophils.
In one trial, 10 of 11 patients that were refractory to all other
therapies treated with alemtuzumab achieved normalization of
eosinophil counts in 2 weeks but most relapsed after 3 months.21
223

Bone marrow transplantation has been done for HES but experience and
evidence are fairly limited.

Pulmonary Disorders
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia:
Early treatment with corticosteroids is generally effective but disease
can be recurrent and may become refractory to corticosteroids.
Peripheral eosinophilia decreases between 12–24 hours post initial
therapy.12
Many patients achieve radiographic improvement in 60–72 hours after
therapy initiation.
Most patients require more than 6 months of therapy.
Recurrences were seen in 58% of patients after cessation of steroids,
so many patients might need long-term low-dose steroids.12
Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP):
Corticosteroids are very effective. Patients generally respond within
24–48 hours of high-dose therapy—tapering can be achieved over
several weeks.
Prognosis is generally good with prompt treatment; disease is
generally not recurrent.2
Churg–Strauss syndrome:
Treatment generally consists of high-dose corticosteroids.
Cyclophosphamide for slow responders or patients who relapse during
steroid taper.
Löffler’s syndrome: Acute symptoms generally resolve after 5–10 days
after starting antihelminthic therapy.
Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia: Diethylcarbamazine citrate is the
appropriate antifilarial therapy.
The treatment of ABPA is discussed in Chapter 4.
Drug- and toxin-induced eosinophilic lung disease is treated with
cessation of the drug or avoidance of the exposure. Corticosteroids can
be used in more severe cases.

Gastrointestinal Disorders
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE):
The primary treatment is avoidance of specific food and aeroallergens. Elemental formulas (amino-acid based) diets have been
shown to improve symptoms and reduce eosinophils.
224

Topical glucocorticoids must be swallowed to allow for deposition on
the esophageal mucosa.22
Anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies (mepolizumab) is currently being
studied for therapy in EE.
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis:
Avoidance of food allergens is indicated and possibly the use of
elemental formula diets.
Systemic and ingested topical corticosteroids (budesonide tablets
designed to deliver medication to the ileum) may be helpful.
Anti-IL-5 and anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies are being studied.
Eosinophilic colitis:
Treatment includes aminosalicylates and systemic and/or ingested
topical corticosteroids.
Antimetabolite therapies such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine
can be used in steroid-refractory cases.
Surveillance with routine upper and lower endoscopies is
recommended.
Prognosis of the adult onset disease is worse than the infantile type.8

Urinary Tract
Corticosteroids may lead to improvement of eosinophilic cystitis.
Acute interstitial nephritis is treated discontinuation of offending
medication and steroids may be necessary in severe cases.

19 Mastocytosis
Bob Geng
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Mast cells play a central role in acquired immediate hypersensitivity
reactions mediated through immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated release of
histamine and other inflammatory mediators.
Mastocytosis is the pathologic proliferation of mast cells resulting in
uncontrolled release of inflammatory mediators causing both cutaneous
and systemic clinical manifestations.1
It is a rare disease that can occur at any age ranging from infancy to
adulthood.

Classification
The classification of mastocytosis is presented in Table 19-1.2

Pathophysiology
Mast cells are generally found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
respiratory tract, lymphoid tissues and skin. They are long-lived and do
not generally circulate.
Mature mast cells have cytoplasmic granules containing histamine and
tryptase. Other components of granules include prostaglandin D2,
leukotrienes C4, D4, E4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, plateletactivating factor (PAF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-b, endothelin,
interleukin (IL)-3, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-16.3,4
Symptoms associated with mastocytosis are secondary to release of
mast cell mediators both within the tissues in which mast cells reside
and distantly via circulation of those mediators.1,3
Mast cells also display a vast array of antigens on their cell surface that
serve as regulators of cell activation/recognition as well as receptors of
various cytokines.
The proto-oncogene c-Kit encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase
receptor for stem cell factor (SCF) that is significantly expressed in
mast cells.
228

Point mutations of c-Kit such as D816V (most common), V560G,
D816Y, D816F, D816H, E839K, F522C are associated with around
93% of all patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM).3 The c-kit
mutation is not detected in all mastocytosis.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The vast majority (up to 90%) of adult and pediatric patients
with mastocytosis have dermatologic involvement. Affected areas
usually include trunk and thighs sparing the face, palms, and soles.1
Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) can be classified by their characteristic
presentation and appearance.
TABLE 19.1 CLASSIFICATION OF MASTOCYTOSIS

Urticaria pigmentosa (UP):
Small yellowish to reddish maculopapular lesions.
May present as nodules or plaques.
Spares the palms, soles, face, and scalp.
Rubbing can lead to urtication and erythema (Darier’s sign).
Pruritus worsened by temperature change, local friction, hot
beverages, spicy foods, and alcohol.
Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM):
A rare condition.
No discrete lesions—diffuse infiltration of the dermis.
Erythroderma of all the skin.
Onset before 3 years old.
Skin is prematurely aged, thickened with a yellowish-brown color
229

and peau d’orange texture.
Blisters can be associated with both UP and DCM in young children.
DCM can be associated with systemic disease and can lead to
complications such as hypotension and GI bleeding.
In children, CM usually appears prior to the first year of life in around
80% of patients, but is usually not associated with systemic disease.
Most will resolve spontaneously by puberty.5
Solitary mastocytoma (uncommon) presents as one reddish brown
maculopapular lesion or nodule with a positive Darier’s sign that often
occurs during the first 3 months of life that usually resolves during
childhood.1
Telangiectasia macularis eruptive perstans (TMEP) presents as
telangiectatic macules that occur on tan-brown colored skin. Affects
<1% of patients with mastocytosis. Usually only appears in adults,
but there have been cases reported in the pediatric population.1,3
Systemic mastocytosis (SM) clinical manifestations are the result of
mast cell mediator release and mast cell infiltration into involved organs
and tissues.
Owing to mast cell infiltration, organomegaly may be present (liver,
spleen, and lymph nodes), and cytopenias can occur.
Symptoms are nonspecific, but can include flushing,
dyspepsia,
diarrhea,
recurrent
syncope,
recurrent
anaphylaxis, bone pain, and fatigue.
Patients with severe anaphylaxis to stings should be screened for
mastocytosis
In aggressive forms of SM or in comorbid nonmast cell hematologic
malignancies, symptoms of weight loss and fever may be present.
Mastocytosis needs to be considered in the evaluation of flushing
syndromes especially with associated hypotension.
Systemic symptoms can occur in the absence of cutaneous symptoms.
SM is more common in adults than in children.
GI symptoms can be triggered or worsened by spicy foods, alcohol or
stress, and is second most common compared to cutaneous
symptoms.3
Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting occur.
One-third of SM patients experience malabsorption.
Caused by urticarial lesions in the GI tract, hypermotility, altered
230

intestinal secretion, or peptic ulcer disease.
Hepatic involvement may result in elevated alkaline phosphatase
and gamma-glutamyl transferase but rarely leads to serious
disease.3
Splenic involvement usually results in trabecular, fibrotic thickening.
Musculoskeletal manifestations include osteoporosis, pathologic
fractures, and nonspecific pains of unclear etiology. Bone discomfort
usually involves the long bones and can be associated with pathologic
fractures.
SM with associated clonal, hematologic nonmast cell lineage
disease (SM-AHNMD) can be seen in association with hypereosinophilic
syndromes as well as other hematologic disorders.
Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) and mast cell leukemia
(MCL) are very rare and carry a poor prognosis.

Diagnostic Criteria
The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for mastocytosis are
presented in Table 19-2.2

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Persistently elevated total serum tryptase level (>20 ng/mL) is
the most commonly used marker of SM.
Elevated plasma/urine histamine or histamine metabolites (Nmethylhistamine, methylimidazole acetic acid), urine prostaglandin D2
metabolites, plasma thromboxane B2, Il-6.
TABLE 19.2 WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DIAGNOSTIC
CRITERIA FOR MASTOCYTOSIS

231

Histamine level can be highly variable between different
individuals.
Alkaline phosphatase and serum aminotransaminases can be elevated
when there is hepatic involvement.
Genetic testing for c-Kit mutation may be done.
Urine level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and urine metanephrines to rule
out carcinoid and pheochromocytomas as other possible causes of
flushing and vascular instability.
Imaging
Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), skeletal survey, and bone
scans are often done for the evaluation of bone involvement.
Osteoporosis is a common sequela of indolent systemic mastocytosis
(ISM).
When there is concern of liver or splenic involvement, abdominal
ultrasound and/or CT may be done.
Diagnostic Procedures
Suspected mastocytosis should be confirmed by tissue biopsy.
Skin biopsy is usually preferred if the patient has cutaneous symptoms.
Histologically, mastocytosis characterized by diffuse infiltration of
mast cells in the dermis.
Mast cells stain positive with toluidine blue or Wright–Giemsa as well
as tryptase immunohistochemical analysis.
Bone marrow biopsy can be helpful if the patient does not have
cutaneous symptoms.
A negative biopsy finding does not rule out disease since mast cells
232

target organ effects could be secondary to mediator release rather than
direct tissue infiltration.1

TREATMENT
Medications
The mainstay of therapy is directed at control of symptoms from
mediator release.
Antihistamines:
H1 antagonists: Hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, loratadine,
fexofenadine, and cetirizine.
H2 antagonists: Ranitidine, cimetidine, and famotidine.
Can give one nonsedating antihistamine during the day and a more
potent antihistamine at night.
Mast cell stabilizers:
Gastric cromolyn formulations inhibit mast cell degranulation and are
effective in reducing GI symptoms.6
Ketotifen is an antihistamine and a mast cell stabilizer that can be
used but antihistamine properties are not more efficacious than
hydroxyzine.7
Leukotriene modifying agents may have some benefit.
Aspirin can improve symptoms through blockade of prostaglandin
synthesis but should be used with caution given the risk of triggering
anaphylaxis.
Patients with anaphylactoid reactions must be taught how to use selfadministered intramuscular epinephrine injections (0.3 mg, 1:1,000) and
must carry it with them at all times.
Oral glucocorticoids can be most effective in treating malabsorption,
ascites, hepatic fibrosis, and other GI symptoms but should be reserved
for refractory disease or acute episodes.8
Topical steroids may be used for cutaneous symptoms.
8-Methoxypsoralen with ultraviolet A phototherapy (PUVA) can be
used for cutaneous disease.9
Surgical excision of a solitary lesion may also be an option.
Cytoreductive therapy is only indicated for patients who present with
target organ damage from aggressive systemic disease.
Interferon-a2b is the first line agent.3,10
233

Cladribine is a nucleoside analog that decreases mast cell burden.11
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors:
Imatinib mesylate is approved by the FDA for ASM without D816V cKIT mutation (only <10% of all cases). In vitro studies
demonstrate that D816V c-KIT mutations confer resistance to
imatinib.1,3
Imatinib should also be used for patients who have concomitant
eosinophilia with the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion oncogene.8,12

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies
The first step in the therapeutic management of mastocytosis consists of
patient counseling and education regarding the disease and avoidance
of triggers that may lead to MC degranulation.
Physical stimuli include intense exercise, excessive sunlight, friction,
extreme temperatures, excessive pressure, and friction.8
Emotional distress can trigger degranulation.1,8
Multiple anesthetic agents have been implicated including lidocaine,
succinylcholine, D-tubocurarine, metocurine, doxacurium, atracurium,
mivacurium, rocuronium, thiopental, etomidate, enflurane, and
isoflurane.1
Other medications to consider include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), opiates, alcohol, vancomycin, a-blockers, thiamine,
aspirin, amphotericin B, quinine, and polymyxin-B.1,8
Contrast agents can provoke anaphylactoid reactions so all
mastocytosis patients should be pre-medicated with steroids and
antihistamines before receiving contrast. Gadolinium is not associated
with MC degranulation.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
CM has the best prognosis; most children with isolated UP will have
resolution by adulthood.3,5
The prognosis of ISM is generally good and patients can have normal life
expectancy. The probability of leukemic transformation is very low.1,13
The prognosis for ASM is generally poor with median survival of 41
months.1,13
For SM-AHNMD the prognosis is poor—median survival of 24 months, but
this depends on the associated hematologic disorder.1,13
234

MCL has a very poor prognosis, mean survival ranging from only 2–12
months.3,13,14

20 Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases
Sydney Leibel
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are inherited disorders of immune
system function that predispose affected individuals to increased rate
and severity of infection, immune dysregulation with autoimmune
disease, and malignancy.
Most cases of PID are diagnosed during infancy and childhood, thus
falling within the realm of pediatrics. However, a working knowledge of
the classification and manifestations of PID and familiarity with the basic
diagnostic and management strategies is beneficial for practitioners with
patients of all ages.
PIDs comprise more than 200 different disorders that affect the
development, function, or both of the immune system.1

Classification
PIDs are classified according to the component of the immune system
that is primarily involved as adopted by the World Health Organization
Scientific Group on PID.2
Humoral quantitative or qualitative defects in antibody production
(50–60% of all PIDs).
Cell-mediated T-cell deficiencies (5–10% of all PIDs).
Combined B- and T-cell deficiencies (20–25% of all PIDs).
Phagocytic cell or granulocyte disorders are defects in migration
or direct killing (10–15% of all PIDs).
Complement deficiencies, defects in the innate immune
system, and autoinflammatory syndromes (<4% of all PIDs).
Defects in adaptive immune responses include antibody deficiency
syndromes and combined immunodeficiencies (CIDs).
Defects of innate immunity comprise disorders of phagocytes, Toll-like
receptor (TLR)-mediated signaling, and complement.
A newly classified group of rare autoinflammatory conditions with
associated immunodeficiency.
237

A genetic defect has been identified for many PIDs. The majority
are X-linked or autosomal recessive.

Epidemiology
The most common PID is immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency. It
has a reported frequency of 1 in 333 among some blood donors.3
All other forms of PID are rare and have an overall prevalence of
approximately 1:10,000 live births.
A much higher rate is observed among populations with high
consanguinity rates or among genetically isolated populations.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
A history of recurrent, chronic, prolonged, complicated, severe,
or opportunistic infections in a patient without known
secondary
immunodeficiency
(i.e., malignancy, HIV/AIDS,
immunosuppressive therapy, malnutrition) should cause prompt
consideration for PID.4
Historical clues to the presence of PID are given in Table 20-1.
Given the rarity of PID and the cost and potential morbidity associated
with immunologic testing, a history compatible with PID is an absolute
prerequisite for embarking on a laboratory workup to confirm a clinical
diagnosis of PID.
Clinical presentation and the etiologic agents involved are the best clues
to the class of PIDs suspected (Table 20-2).
Types and patterns of infection:
Recurrent or chronic infections: An often-cited guideline is >6–8
upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) per year in the first
decade of life or more than one episode of pneumonia per
decade in adults. It is important to note, however, that children
exposed to frequent daycare and/or tobacco smoke may have up to
10 URIs per year. Also, any serious infection occurring twice in a child
or once in an adult should raise suspicion of presence of PID.
Prolonged duration of infections.
Severe or complicated infections: For example, severe varicella
238

complicated by pneumonia or hepatitis or bronchiectasis.
Infection with an opportunistic organism: For example,
Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Cryptococcus neoformans (in the absence of HIV/AIDS).
TABLE 20.1 HISTORICAL CLUES TO PRESENCE OF PRIMARY
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES

TABLE 20.2 COMMON PRESENTATIONS AND INFECTIOUS AGENTS
CLASSIFIED BY PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASE
SUBTYPE

239

The presence of certain features or constellations of signs should prompt
suspicion of PID, such as:
Cardiac disease, micrognathia, and hypocalcemia (DiGeorge
syndrome).
Thrombocytopenia and eczema (Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome).
240

Hypohidrosis, dental anomalies, alopecia (NEMO [nuclear factor-k-B
essential modulator] mutation, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia
with immunodeficiency).
Ataxia plus oculocutaneous telangiectasias (ataxia-telangiectasia
syndrome).
Elements of the history that can help in the diagnosis are:
Family member with documented PID or recurrent infections.
Unexplained early infant deaths.
Autoimmune disease.
Consanguinity.
Physical Examination
The physical examination findings of PIDs are presented in Table 20-3.
TABLE 20.3 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS IN PRIMARY
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASE

241

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
A complete blood count (CBC) with differential should be ordered
in all cases of suspected immunodeficiency.
A CBC may indicate lymphopenia; however, a normal WBC does not
exclude lymphopenia. This value consists of both lymphocytes and
granulocytes, which is why a differential is required.
Total lymphocyte count should be >1,200 cells/μL in adults, >3,000
cells/μL in infants.
Because T cells make up approximately 75% of the total lymphocyte
count, lymphopenia typically implies a decreased number of T cells.
Alternatively, leukocytosis may be present, which is a sign of
leukocyte adhesion defects.
242

Eosinophilia (>1.5 × 109/L) is present in hyper-IgE syndrome.
Thrombocytopenia (<70,000/μL) with small platelets is seen in
Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome.
Rule our cystic fibrosis and immotile cilia syndrome.
Cystic fibrosis presents with recurrent episodes of bronchitis, sinusitis,
and pneumonia and is associated with malnutrition, failure to thrive,
and steatorrhea.
If features of the disease are present, a sweat chloride screening
test should be performed.
>60 mEq/L is abnormal in children; >80 mEq/L in adults.
Sensitivity of this test is 80–85%.
If the clinical suspicion is high, but the sweat test is negative or
equivocal, genetic testing for cystic fibrosis transmembrane
regulator (CFTR) gene mutations should be performed.
Immotile cilia syndrome is characterized as an autosomal recessive
condition with recurrent upper and lower respiratory infections and
bronchiectasis.
Consider HIV infection in those with risk factors.
HIV antibodies are usually sufficient; however, in those with
decreased or absent immunoglobulin response obtaining and HIV viral
load is recommend.
Quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE) should be
interpreted according to age-related standards (see (Appendix B, Table
B-3)). Hypogammaglobulinemia is defined by immunoglobulin levels two
standard deviations below the mean for age.
Saline isohemagglutinins (anti-A, anti-B) are used to assess IgM
function.
Isohemagglutinins are normally lacking in persons with blood type AB.
Unreliable in infants <6 months of age or in individuals who have
received intravenous or subcutaneous γ globulin within 30 days.
Antibody response to immunization is a functional test for the
immune system. Pre- and post-immunization antibody titers should be
measured 3–4 weeks apart.
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (e.g., Pneumovax 23)
is more useful for impaired antibody production than proteinconjugated polysaccharide vaccines (e.g., Hib, tetanus, or Hibdiphtheria conjugates), though it is advised to measure responses to
243

both polysaccharide and protein-conjugated vaccines (see (Appendix
B, Table B-5) for reference values).
Antibody responses to carbohydrate antigens are typically poor in
children <2 years old.
Booster immunizations with repeat titers 3–4 weeks later may be
required in children and in adults with long intervals since previous
vaccination.
Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin tests are functional tests
of cell-​mediated immunity.
Only four antigens intended for assessing a person’s ability to elicit a
DTH response have been standardized for this use by the Mantoux
procedure: Tuberculin, coccidioidin, histoplasmin, and mumps.
Only a very small proportion of the population will react to tuberculin.
Sensitivity to coccidioidin and histoplasmin is restricted to endemic
regions.
In large trials conducted by the army medical centers, mumps,
Candida, and tetanus toxoid produced the highest proportion of
positive skin tests, although only mumps is standardized for anergy
testing.
T- and B-lymphocyte subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD16, and
CD56) and in vitro responses to mitogens should be measured by a
laboratory that provides age-matched normal control values (see
(Appendix B, Table B-6)).
Laboratory evaluation for specific immunodeficiencies:
Complement deficiency: Total hemolytic complement (CH50)
approaches zero in individuals with deficiency of any of the classic
complement pathway components except C9. C3 and C4 can be used
as a screening test.
Phagocyte
deficiency:
Flow
cytometry
assay
using
dihydrorhodamine (DHR) oxidation or the nitroblue tetrazolium test to
demonstrate failure of the normal respiratory burst in chronic
granulomatous disease.
DiGeorge syndrome: Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the
22q11 mutation that 90% of affected patients have.
Hyper IgE syndrome: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3) mutation is the most common mutation in the autosomal
dominant form of the disease.
244

Selected Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases
It is beyond the scope of this book to provide an in-depth review of the
clinical and laboratory features of PID. Table 20-4 summarizes the
immunologic profile and genetic defects associated with PIDs.1
X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
X-linked SCID is the most common form of severe combined
immunodeficiency (50–60%).5
Affected infants present within the first few months with frequent
episodes of diarrhea, pneumonia, otitis media, cutaneous infections, and
sepsis.
The disease is characterized by profound T- and B-cell
lymphopenia. There is an absence of T-cell proliferation, serum
immunoglobulins are low or absent, and there is minimal antibody
response to vaccination.
Physical examination may reveal small or absent lymph nodes, tonsils,
and adenoids. Growth may be normal at first but extreme wasting
usually develops. An absent thymic shadow may be noticed on chest
radiograph.
X-linked SCID is a pediatric medical emergency. Treatment includes
empiric antimicrobial coverage, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and
stem cell transplant. Bone marrow or other stem cell reconstitution is a
first-line, specific therapy for almost all forms of SCID. Patients who are
well nourished, uninfected, and younger than 6 months prior to
transplantation have the best outcomes.
Without stem cell reconstitution, it is rare for a patient with SCID to
survive.
TABLE 20.4 SUMMARY OF SELECTED IMMUNOLOGIC PROFILE
AND GENETIC DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH PID

245

246

IgA Deficiency
IgA deficiency is the most common PID, affecting 1:300–1:700
individuals.
Diagnostic criteria for selective IgA deficiency include a serum IgA
level <10 mg/dL (or below the level of detection) with normal levels
of other immunoglobulin classes and normal cellular immunity. Vaccine
responses are also usually normal.
The disease is more prevalent among persons with recurrent infections,
allergy, autoimmune disorders, and certain GI disorders like celiac
disease.
Clinical expression of IgA deficiency ranges from recurrent sinopulmonary
or GI infections to no symptoms.
IgA deficiency is difficult to diagnosis prior to the age of 2 given the
natural course of IgA antibody production (see Table 20-4).6
An estimated one-third of patients with IgA deficiency have serum IgE
antibodies to IgA that can cause anaphylaxis during transfusion of
blood products or IVIG.
247

Treatment of IgA deficiency is supportive, with antimicrobial therapy as
needed and treatment of autoimmune disorders. A small portion of IgA
deficiency patients go on to develop CVID, thus serum immunoglobulins
should be monitored over time.

Common Variable Immunodeficiency
Common variable immunodeficiency is a heterogeneous disorder
characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, severe
hypogammaglobulinemia, and diminished antibody responses.
It typically affects older children and adults and is classically diagnosed
during the second and third decade of life.
Clinical manifestations include recurrent sinopulmonary infections,
bronchiectasis, malabsorption, and diarrhea (usually associated
wi th Giardia lamblia infection). Some patients have respiratory tract
colonization with Mycoplasma or Ureaplasma organisms.
Autoimmune disease may also be present (e.g., pernicious anemia,
hemolytic anemia, polyarticular arthritis, lupus-like syndromes).
There is also an increased risk of lymphoreticular malignancy.7
Physical examination may reveal diminished lymph nodes and tonsilar
tissue, though there may be signs of lymphoid hypertrophy in the form
of lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly.
Serum IgG and IgA levels are usually low and most antibody responses
are poor or absent. B-cell subpopulation is typically normal.
Treatment is supportive, including IVIG.

TREATMENT
Pathogen avoidance is crucially important.
Early and judicious use of empiric antibiotics followed by culturedirected specific antibiotic treatment.
Consider fungal, mycobacterial, viral, or protozoan pathogens early in
management if infections is refractory to antibiotics.
IVIG (or subcutaneous IG) is paramount in the management of PID due
to antibody deficiency.
Mechanism of action. Commercially available preparations contain IgG
antibodies (pooled from >3,000 donors) in concentrations sufficient to
serve as replacement for IgG as well as trace amounts of IgA and
IgM.
248

Recommended starting dosage is 400–500 mg/kg every month.
Trough serum IgG level (target >500 mg/dL or higher if bronchiectasis
present) measured 4 weeks after IVIG infusion are used to guide
dosage and frequency.
The subcutaneous route can be used in stabilized patients for weekly
home use.
Adverse effects include fever, nausea, vomiting, and back pain. Severe
anaphylactic reactions rarely occur (possibly due to trace
amounts of IgA in the IVIG).
Aseptic meningitis and hemolytic anemia are also rare complications.
Treatment of aseptic meningitis treatment is supportive. Evidence in
lacking to support use of high dose steroids.
Stem cell transplantation has been used to correct the underlying
immune defects in SCID, chronic granulomatous disease, hyper-IgM
syndrome, and Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome.
Gene therapy and replacement enzyme therapy have been utilized
in SCID and may have further use in complement deficiency.
Parents of a child with diagnosed immunodeficiency may desire
evaluation to see if one or both parents carry the defect, in order to plan
for future childbearing. In X-linked diseases this can be accomplished by
x-chromosome inactivation analysis.
Blood products may elicit life-threatening graft-vs-host disease in
patients with cellular immunodeficiency and anaphylaxis in those with
antibody deficiency.
Live virus vaccines (e.g., measles/mumps/rubella, varicella, rotavirus)
should not be given to patients with PID or their family members.

21 Allergen Immunotherapy
James A. Tarbox
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Allergen immunotherapy (IT) is used in allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma,
stinging-insect hypersensitivity, and atopic dermatitis if associated with
aeroallergen sensitivity.
Standardized extracts should be used when available.
IT should only be performed by a specialist trained in allergy
and immunology.
Treatment needs to be tailored for the individual, with appropriate
concentrations of allergens for approximately 3–5 years duration.

Definition
IT is the administration of increasing doses of allergen extract to alleviate
symptoms associated with the causative allergen.

Pathophysiology
The mechanism of action of IT is complex and not yet well understood.
One current theory is that introduction of the allergen results in immune
modulation of the immune system that shifts the T-cell phenotype from
a TH2 toward a TH1 predominance (Fig. 21-1).1
T-regulatory cells producing interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth
factor (TGF)-b are increased in successful IT.2
Studies have shown that IT leads to:
Blunting of the usual seasonal rise in IgE antibodies over time.
Increase in serum IgA and IgG antibodies with change in subclasses
(increased IgG1 and IgG4).
Down-regulation of the cellular and inflammatory mediators of allergic
response.
Decrease in platelet-activating factor and histamine-releasing factor
levels.
Down-regulation of the low-affinity IgE receptor (Fcε RII).
251

Decrease in mast cell and eosinophil numbers in secretions.
Up-regulation of the counter-regulatory cytokines expressed by TH1
phenotype.

TREATMENT
Efficacy
The clinical efficacy of IT in allergic rhinitis has been well documented,
and IT has been shown to improve symptoms, reduce medications, and
provide long-term benefits even after cessation of therapy.3–5
FIGURE 21.1 Simplified schematic diagram of the TH1 and TH2
paradigm in allergic diseases. The TH2 profile is associated with the
allergic state and humoral immune responses, whereas the TH1 profile is
associated with cellular responses and a down-regulation in allergic
responses. Immunotherapy is thought to shift the T-cell phenotype from
TH2 toward TH1. A representation of cytokines involved in this is shown.
DC, dendritic cell; IL, interleukin; INF, interferon; T H0,undifferentiated Thelper cell; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.

Allergen-specific IT has the potential to alter the natural course of
252

allergic disease.6
IT improves asthma symptoms, decreases use of asthma medications,
and reduces bronchial hyper-reactivity.7
Long-term benefits of >12 years after discontinuation of therapy in
patients with allergic rhinitis have been documented.8,9
The quality of the extract used for successful IT is critical.10 The World
Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed the use of standardized
extracts whenever available in IT.11
Achieving optimal target doses of the causative allergen is also critical
for IT to be successful.
Table 21-1 provides recommended maintenance doses set forth by the
Joint Task Force for allergen IT practice parameters.12

Indications
IT is indicated for allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis, allergic reactions to
stinging insects, allergic asthma, and atopic dermatitis resulting from
sensitivity to aeroallergens.
It is not indicated for food or drug allergy, urticaria, or
angioedema.13
Criteria for initiating IT:
TABLE 21.1 ALLERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY RECOMMENDED
MAINTENANCE DOSES

253

Demonstration that the disease is IgE-mediated—epicutaneous
skin test is the preferred method.
Pharmacotherapy (e.g., antihistamines, decongestants, leukotriene
modulators, topical corticosteroids) and/or allergen avoidance
have not successfully controlled symptoms.
Indications for IT (any one of the following):
Insufficient symptom control with antihistamines, decongestants,
topical corticosteroids, and/or leukotriene modulators.
Undesirable side effects of pharmacotherapy.
Desire to avoid or reduce long-term pharmacologic treatment.
Patients with allergic asthma with mild-to-moderate disease (forced
expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] >70% of predicted) on
adequate pharmacologic treatment.
Hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera or fire ants and at risk for
anaphylaxis.
Allergic Rhinitis
Commonly cited reasons for initiating IT in allergic rhinitis11:
To prevent symptoms and improve quality of life.

To

reduce ongoing expenses for noncurative medication.
reduce side effects of antihistamines and decongestants.
reduce development/aggravation of allergic asthma.
reduce comorbidity due to recurrent sinusitis/otitis.
improve on the limited efficacy of allergen avoidance.

Allergic Asthma
In the past, the role of IT in allergic asthma had been controversial, but
two large meta-analyses confirmed effectiveness of IT in treating mildto-moderate allergic asthma compared to placebo.14,15
These studies demonstrated that patients treated with IT had
reductions in allergen-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness,
medication requirements, and overall symptoms.
Therefore, IT has been endorsed by the WHO for the treatment of
mild-to-moderate allergic asthma.11
Starting IT early in the course of allergic asthma may lead to decreased
use of medications and, perhaps, even an alteration in the natural
course of the disease.
Insect-Sting Hypersensitivity
Effectiveness of IT for venom hypersensitivity has been well established.
IT is indicated for patients with a history of anaphylaxis from venom.16
Patients with recurrent, large, local reactions are also candidates for
venom IT.17

Immunotherapy Protocols
Allergen IT needs to be individualized to the patient.
IT is traditionally given at weekly intervals while increasing the dose to
maintenance therapy.
Rush protocols (injections given daily) and cluster protocols (multiple
injections/day) are used more commonly in Europe. The exception is for
insect-sting hypersensitivity, in which rush protocols are used more
commonly.
Maintenance dosages for aeroallergens are usually given every 2–4
weeks.
Venom IT may be given every 8 weeks.
A sample schedule for perennial aqueous IT is given in Appendix C.
Allergen extract concentrations can be expressed as a weight per volume
255

ratio (w/v), protein nitrogen unit (PNU), or, the biologically active
measure, in allergen units (BAU).
The goal is to attain the highest tolerated dose; usually 6–12 μg per
injection of the major allergen is required.
A physician needs to be immediately available with proper
equipment on hand in case a severe reaction occurs.
The recommended injection site is the outer aspect of the upper arm
between the deltoid and triceps muscles.
Extracts are administered subcutaneously.
Oral antihistamines and leukotriene antagonists may be given to reduce
local ​reactions.
The patient should be observed for at least 20–30 minutes after
each injection.11 Life-threatening anaphylactic reactions after the
initial 30 minutes are rare. Fatalities are also rare.18

Duration of Treatment
Therapy is generally given for 3–5 years; however, the actual length of
time for treatment is unclear.
The recommendation of 3–5 years duration is based on data from venom
hypersensitivity and only one study of a single seasonal allergen (grass);
clearly, further studies need to be performed.3
If symptoms are well controlled after this time, IT may be stopped.
Some patients experience return of symptoms within 1–2 years after
cessation of IT; if desired, it may be restarted but needs to be
incrementally increased to the maintenance dose.
If clinical benefit from IT is not apparent after 1–2 years, IT should be
discontinued.

Side Effects and Risks
A physician needs to be nearby to treat potentially serious reaction to
IT.11
Local reactions to IT are common.
Significant local reactions are identified as an immediate redness and
swelling with wheal >2 cm in diameter or wheal lasting >24 hours.
Local reactions should be treated with oral antihistamine and local
application of cold packs.
If significant local reaction occurs, the next dose is reduced to the
previously tolerated dose.
256

Premedication with antihistamines may help reduce local reactions.
However, in venom IT, studies suggest that initial antihistamine
premedication might actually increase the efficacy of IT.19
Systemic reactions and anaphylaxis are rare but can occur.
A fatal systemic reaction occurs in approximately one of every
2 million doses of IT administered annually.18,20
Signs/symptoms of systemic reaction (one or more of the following):
generalized erythema and/or urticaria, pruritus, angioedema,
bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, and shock/cardiac arrest.
Systemic/anaphylaxis reactions should be treated with IM
aqueous epinephrine (0.3–0.5 mL of 1:1,000). (see Chap. 13).
To limit systemic absorption of the antigen, a tourniquet should be
placed above the injection site and released every 15 minutes.
Optionally, epinephrine 0.1–0.3 mL may also be given at the injection
site to further delay absorption of the antigen.
Proper emergency resuscitation protocol should be followed to ensure
patent airway and maintenance of adequate blood pressure.
Because of its more rapid onset, the preferred antihistamine is
diphenhydramine and it is given IV or IM.
IV hydrocortisone (5 mg/kg) may be used for severe systemic
reactions; however, corticosteroids have limited effect in the
immediate response. In general, they are used to prevent a latephase response, which may occur 4–12 hours after the initial
response and can be as severe.

Relative Contraindications and Special Considerations
IT should not be initiated in allergic asthma patients whose
asthma is unstable or poorly controlled. The risk of fatal or near
fatal events is much higher in this group.21
Ongoing treatment with a β-adrenergic blocker is a relative
contraindication for receiving IT. Patients receiving β-blockers are at
increased risk for a severe anaphylactic reaction that may be resistant to
epinephrine administration.
Discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
use should be considered before initiating venom IT due to the potential
increased risk of more severe anaphylaxis.22
Patients with a fever, an asthmatic with upper respiratory infection, a
257

wheezing patient, or a patient with significantly reduced pulmonary
function tests (peak expiratory flow rate [PEFR] <70% of predicted)
should wait for resolution of these symptoms to receive scheduled IT.
Strenuous exercise should be avoided immediately after an injection.
Women who become pregnant can continue their scheduled IT at lower
doses than normal. IT is not initiated in pregnant patients.
Tryptase levels should be measured in all patients before initiating
venom IT. Higher baseline tryptase correlates with an increased
risk of systemic reactions.23

Potential Reasons for Failure of Immunotherapy
Environmental modifications to control allergens are inadequate or
insufficient.
Significant or contributing allergen not recognized and omitted in IT
regimen.
Inadequate doses of major allergen in preparation (normally need 6–12
μg of the major allergen to be successful).
New allergies develop during treatment course.
Exposure to nonallergen triggers like cigarette smoke.
Original causative allergen is misdiagnosed.

REFERRAL
IT should be administered by a specialist trained in allergy and
immunology.

PATIENT EDUCATION
All patients should be provided and educated in use of self-injectable
epinephrine.
Patients should be educated regarding the possible signs and symptoms
of systemic reactions.
Before IT is started, the patient should be educated about the benefits
and risks of IT, as well as the methods for minimizing risks.
Realistic outcome from IT should also be discussed with each patient.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
258

Patients should be monitored for at least 20–30 minutes after
receiving IT for any adverse symptoms.
Patients should be seen for a follow-up visit with the physician at least
every 6–12 months. More frequent visits may be needed depending on
response to therapy, adverse reactions, modifications in dosage or
alteration in underlying allergic diseases.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
IT has been shown to significantly improve symptoms in patients with
allergic rhinitis, asthma, and venom hypersensitivity.
After 10 years, 15% of patients who underwent venom IT relapsed.24
